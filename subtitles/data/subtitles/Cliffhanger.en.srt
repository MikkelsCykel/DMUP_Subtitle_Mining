1
00:01:57,393 --> 00:02:00,385
Rescue 3.
Jessie, do you see him yet?

2
00:02:01,264 --> 00:02:03,323
Patience, my love, patience.

3
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:09,534
Wait a minute.
I think I have him sighted.

4
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:11,436
Frank, what's the word?

5
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:14,476
The word is we got him
over there.

6
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:21,313
Rescue 3, this is Rescue Center.
Over.

7
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:22,908
This is 3. Go ahead.

8
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:26,250
Jessie, we're getting general clearance
in the southeastern region of the park.

9
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:30,053
You will probably have sufficient
cloud base to get into the tower...

10
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:33,789
but please be advised you'll still
encounter strong winds and turbulence.

11
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:36,764
We would advise
against a winch rescue. Over.

12
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:40,291
Wilco, Center. I'll proceed
with wire cross trom opposite tower.

13
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,803
- Three out.
- Center out.

14
00:02:57,753 --> 00:03:01,086
Gabe, Hal's signaling he's okay.

15
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:03,919
Gabe?

16
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:07,225
Gabe, where are you?

17
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:09,321
I'm just hanging out, Jess.

18
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:11,931
Oh, my God.

19
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:19,764
I don't recognize the face,
but the butt does look vaguely familiar.

20
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:23,505
Hey, be careful,
or you'll embarrass old Frank.

21
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,047
It would take a heap more
than that, rock-jock.

22
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:27,673
Yeah.

23
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:07,951
Gabe?

24
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:10,288
They're below
the top of the tower.

25
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:12,350
They're on the ledge
just above you.

26
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:14,453
You got another few feet.

27
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:23,667
- Glad you could join us.
- Yeah, sure. Hi, Sarah.

28
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:25,070
Hi, Gabe.

29
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:27,701
So, how's the knee?

30
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:30,211
I think it's out.
No big deal.

31
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,942
I remember when you twisted it
getting out of that hot tub.

32
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,444
I thought it was
an old war wound from 'Nam.

33
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,488
Really? Hmm.

34
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:41,955
Rescue 3.

35
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:44,424
I've located a stranded climber.

36
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,257
Jessie, please send down
a transport line.

37
00:04:57,807 --> 00:04:59,741
So, tell me, how you teeling?

38
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:02,107
Fine, considering.

39
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:04,442
What do you say we take oft...

40
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,880
and leave this clown behind, huh?

41
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,178
Don't tempt me.

42
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:17,489
Rescue 3.

43
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,892
Please be advised
that Ranger Walker...

44
00:05:19,962 --> 00:05:22,123
is making advances
toward my girlfriend...

45
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:25,759
that's liable to get his ass kicked
right off this mountain.

46
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:28,030
Be informed Gabe makes advances
to me only...

47
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:30,971
or he'll be climbing down
4,000 teet and sleeping outside.

48
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,508
Baby, he lies.

49
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:09,609
- Is it really 4,000?
- Yeah, just about.

50
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:14,116
Hey, remember, whatever this guy says
about me, don't believe it, okay?

51
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:15,445
Thanks.

52
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:29,562
Okay. Come on over.

53
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:37,494
I know you're nervous, but
we've done this a hundred times, okay?

54
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:39,040
Mm-hmm.

55
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:45,540
Excuse me, Captain Hot Tub?

56
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,745
Keep your arms and legs
inside the vehicle at all times.

57
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:53,888
That's great, Hal.

58
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:57,417
That really inspires contidence.

59
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:07,632
So, how did this clown talk you
into climbing up to the tower?

60
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:10,001
He told me
it was better than sex.

61
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:11,664
Really?

62
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,570
You ready for the best ride
in the park?

63
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,671
Give me a second.
I'll let you know.

64
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,585
You look like hell.

65
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:34,959
He made it.

66
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,964
Ot course he did.

67
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:39,125
Really, there's nothing to it.

68
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:40,998
Okay, I can do this.

69
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,537
Sure you can.

70
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,869
I'm sorry
tor all the trouble, really.

71
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,431
- Oh, Sarah, don't worry about it.
- Thanks.

72
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,273
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, yeah.

73
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:55,479
- We're still on for dinner tonight?
- Of course we are.

74
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:56,984
Okay.

75
00:07:58,087 --> 00:08:00,214
Okay. You're ready now.

76
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:01,551
That's it.

77
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:07,158
Now, just sit
right down into it.

78
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:11,466
Come on, guys.
The wind's picking up.

79
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:15,433
Sarah, just keep
your eyes on me.

80
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:16,937
No, don't look-- Sarah.

81
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:19,566
Sarah, look at me.
That's it.

82
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:22,702
- Right.
- Just start to pull.

83
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:24,643
One hand after another.

84
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:28,149
You're doing great--
really, great. Keep goin'.

85
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:32,019
And just keep looking at me.

86
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:34,647
That's great!
You're starting to look like a pro.

87
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,452
Keep going.

88
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:38,390
That's it.
Nice and easy.

89
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:41,658
Hey, Hal, we're gonna
be out ot a job soon.

90
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,254
A little more, Sarah.

91
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:44,856
That's it.

92
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:47,866
One, two.

93
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:54,441
Oh, God!

94
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,341
Gabe! Gabe!

95
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,380
No!

96
00:08:58,447 --> 00:08:59,937
Hold on!

97
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:04,108
- I'm going to fall !
- No, you're not!

98
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:06,017
You're going to be okay!

99
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:10,525
- Can you reach the main line?
- No, I can't! I'm slipping!

100
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:13,892
- Gabe, can you keep the line steady?
- That clip's not gonna hold!

101
00:09:13,963 --> 00:09:16,898
I can't hold on !
Help me, please!

102
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:19,628
- Gabe, you have to go after her.
- No!

103
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:22,569
- Gabe, no!
- I'm coming out to get you!

104
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:26,438
It's not rigged for two. Keep it trom
swinging. I'll send out my harness.

105
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:28,477
No time!
I'm going tor her!

106
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:31,513
Gabe, shit! No!

107
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,275
Sarah, I'm coming tor you !

108

I can't hold on ! I'm slipping!

109
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:38,115
Hold on just a little bit longer!
I'm coming for you!

110
00:09:38,187 --> 00:09:41,418
Gabe, please hurry!
I can't hold on !

111
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,856
Don't look down.
Keep looking at me.

112
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:46,793
- That's it. Hold it.
- I'm trying!

113
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:50,528
It's breaking.
She's losing it.

114
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:54,695
Sarah ! He'll have you
in a second, baby!

115
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,238
Come on, baby!
Don't you give up!

116
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:01,440
Hurry, Gabe.
You're almost there.

117
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,842
- Keep going.
- I'm here, Sarah.

118
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:05,676
Sarah, I'm here.

119
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:08,549
I don't want to die!

120
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:11,882
Reach up and grab him!
Reach up!

121
00:10:11,954 --> 00:10:14,514
- Sarah, reach up!
- Come on, honey!

122
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,455
- Use your other hand!
- Reach up!

123
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,856
Hold on! Hold on !
I got you! I got you.

124
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:27,869
I can't hold on!
I'm going to die!

125
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:30,269
You're not going to die.

126
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,869
Don't you lose her, Gabe.

127
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:35,604
I got her. Reach up.

128
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:38,112
I'm slipping. I'm slipping!

129
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,446
- You can do it, Sarah.
- Hold her, Gabe!

130
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,281
Please don't let me tall.

131
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,548
Please, I don't want to die.

132
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:48,522
- You're not gonna die.
- I'm slipping!

133
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:50,752
Sarah, I got you!
Just reach up!

134
00:10:50,826 --> 00:10:52,953
I can't, Gabe!

135
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,428
You can do it.
Please, baby, just reach up!

136
00:10:55,497 --> 00:10:58,295
Hal ! Hal ! I'm slipping!

137
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,631
Gabe, man, don't you lose her!

138
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:03,171
- Don't you let her go!
- Don't let me tall.

139
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,505
I'm slipping!

140
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:09,066
Sarah, please.

141
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:11,078
No, I'm slipping! Gabe!

142
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:13,080
Gabe, don't let me tall !

143
00:11:13,148 --> 00:11:16,481
- No!
- Help me! I'm talling! Gabe!

144
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,826
No! Sarah, no!

00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:42,341
Jesus Christ.

146
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:07,258
Treasury Agent Mac Lamoore,
please contact D.A.U.

147
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:19,305
Lock 'em up.

148
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,718
Travers, we'll be fueled up
and ready to go in ten minutes.

149
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,981
Very good.

150
00:12:32,227 --> 00:12:33,819
Mr. Travers.

151
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:37,996

00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:44,567
Matheson has been transferred
from the Denver oftice to Frisco.

155
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,736
As a protessional courtesy
I was asked if he could hitch a ride.

156
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,302
Got plenty ot room.
Be glad to accommodate you.

157
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,348
- Appreciate it.
- You're the boss.

158
00:12:53,415 --> 00:12:56,077
Let's go. Matheson,
have you been totally brieted?

159
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:59,416
- I don't know about totally.
- Who the hell ever is?

160
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:02,321
It's the most protected shipment
we've got and the most useless.

161
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:04,416
These bills aren't even
in circulation.

162
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,621
$1,000 bills we're transporting are only
used for international banking exchange.

163
00:13:07,696 --> 00:13:09,425
You always transport
through the air?

164
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:12,126
Mostly. Armored cars can be hijacked,
trains derailed...

165
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:14,362
but nobody can touch us in tlight.

166
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:17,132
Haven't lost a bill in 12 years.
Don't jinx me now.

167
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:21,199
Treasury agents are the most
superstitious people in the government.

168
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:23,801
We should be.
Everybody wants what we have.

169
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:44,322
Gabe! Hey, man, Gabe!

170
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,629
- It's Gabe. He's back!
- I can see that.

171
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:50,162
Come on, man. Let's go!

172
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:12,583
How you doing, Gabe?

173
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:14,686
Dude, turn that down.

174
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:17,357
You guys.
How you doing, Brett, Evan?

175
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:20,401
Where you been?
You fall ott the planet or something?

176
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:23,802
- No, I've been working up in Denver.
- Work?

177
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:25,339
Don't say that word.

178
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,103
I hate work, even when
somebody else is doing it.

179
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,805
Gabe, we're tlying otf the tower today.
You should come with us.

180
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:35,509
Today's going to be the day
for a killer jump.

181
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:39,944
- No, thanks. Can't.
- Come on, man.

182
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:43,423
Don't tell me that job in Denver
made you scared ot heights?

183
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:50,793
You guys better watch out 'cause
some bad weather's comin' in, okay?

184
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:53,130
We like it extreme.

185
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:57,633
Hey, man, see you later, Gabe.
Good to have you back.

186
00:14:57,706 --> 00:14:59,731
Yeah, good to see you. Later.

187
00:14:59,808 --> 00:15:01,400
Peace.

188
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,227
How you doing, Jess?

189
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,726
Hello, Gabriel.

190
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:32,673
Got yourself a new horse?

191
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:38,713
- Where have you been?
- Just working.

192
00:15:40,182 --> 00:15:42,912
Atter the tuneral,
I just had to leave.

193
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,078
Had to leave?

194
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:48,679
Believe me, a lot of us
wanted to leave.

195
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:50,156
But you know what?

196
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:52,159
We stayed.

197
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,622
Jess...

198
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,960
a lot ot things fell apart
on that ledge.

199
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:01,627
I know.

200
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:04,604
But I don't think
you know how much.

201
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,437
Why can't you just believe
you did everything you could?

202
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,000
Did l? I don't know.

203
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:12,273
Maybe I shouldn't have
gone out on that line.

204
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,643
Maybe I panicked.
I don't know.

205
00:16:16,718 --> 00:16:18,811
I was there, remember?

206
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:21,185
You were the only one
who didn't panic.

207
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:24,885
Why don't you do us a tavor
and quit hording all the guilt?

208
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,919
You held on as long as you could.
And what about Hal?

209
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:32,797
What was Hal doing on the tower
with a girl who could barely climb?

210
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:35,666
I can't blame Hal tor anything.
It was me.

211
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:38,372
All me.

212
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,965
Well, give it up, Gabe...

213
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,568
because let me tell you something--
it doesn't get any better.

214
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:46,307
It doesn't get any better?

215
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,483
I really don't think
you understand.

216
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:54,989
- What?
- I don't think you understand.

217
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,991
I don't understand?

218
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,295
I think I'm the only one
that understands.

219
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:06,630
Believe me, there were times when I
didn't know what I wanted to do more--

220
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:09,330
hate you or love you.

221
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:13,531
But one thing I did know
and I still do know...

222
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:15,872
is I understand you.

223
00:17:29,024 --> 00:17:31,288
Did you come back to stay?

224
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,024
You didn't.

225
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,635
I can't.

226
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,074
I can't. Not here.

227
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,401
Jessie, I came back tor you.

228
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,177
And it you like,
I want you to come with me.

229
00:17:58,854 --> 00:18:03,723
You come back atter being gone for
almost a year and expect me to leave?

230
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:08,022
This is our home.

231
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,227
Now it's my home.

232
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,065
And I can't just pick up and go
for all the wrong reasons.

233
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,915
If you don't mind, I'd better
pick up the rest of my stuft.

234
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,645
You know where everything is.

235
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,914
I'm late for work.

236
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:49,695
Hey, big boy.

237
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,109
Roger, Five-Lima,
scattered, broken clouds...

238
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,415
20,000 feet with
a severe storm advisory.

239
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:07,614
Check the storm scope.

240
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,811
Travers says
you're being transterred.

241
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,904
Oh, yeah.
Moving up in the world.

242
00:19:48,997 --> 00:19:51,830
The forecast-- cloudy skies
with flurries today.

243
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,131
We can expect an inch of snow
and a high in the low 30s.

244
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:59,139
Overnight flurries will increase with
a total accumulation of three inches.

245
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,072
Tonight's low near 15.

246
00:20:01,143 --> 00:20:03,941
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time
tor another masterpiece.

247
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:05,502
Hiya, Jess.

248
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,016
Oh, I think old Frank
nailed it with that stroke.

249
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,915
What do you think?

250
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:13,079
I don't know.

251
00:20:13,155 --> 00:20:15,146
What do you see?

252
00:20:15,223 --> 00:20:16,520
Surprise me.

253
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,059
What usually eats a banana?

254
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:20,856
A monkey.

255
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,557
This is a picture
ot a banana eating a monkey.

256
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:26,123
- Nature in reverse.
- Where?

257
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:28,801
Right here.

258
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:34,369
Frank, you look like
a normal guy, but he's not...

259
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,137
are you, Frankie?

260
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:37,974
Hey, I'm an artist.

261
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,093
We're being tracked.

262
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:55,356
- Jetstar, three o'clock.
- Travers!

263
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,524
Stay put. Don't anyone
jump to conclusions.

264
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,634
- He's coming in too slow.
- No, we're going too tast.

265
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,836
We're too high. Give me 180 knots,
drop to 15,000 feet.

266
00:21:09,911 --> 00:21:11,742
You got it.

267
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:15,613
Christ. We're losing altitude
and slowing down. Get your weapons.

268
00:21:15,684 --> 00:21:18,517
What the hell are you doing?
I have jurisdiction on this jet.

269
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:23,286
Now I have jurisdiction.
I said get your weapons!

270
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:26,225
These are highly trained agents,
Mr. Matheson.

271
00:21:26,294 --> 00:21:30,253
I think you're overreacting.
Just calm down and give me the gun.

272
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:33,096
- You're out ot control.
- What the hell are you waiting for?

273
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,466
He's hijacking the shipment.

274
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,616
What the tuck was that?

275
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:12,668
- Move into position.
- Look alive, Kristel.

276
00:22:12,741 --> 00:22:15,073
Crossover transfer,
ten seconds and counting.

277
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:17,008
November 1-2-niner-five Lima...

278
00:22:17,078 --> 00:22:19,444
this is Jetstar
6-8-0 Tango-Tango.

279
00:22:19,514 --> 00:22:22,176
Is frequency secure? Over.

280
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,014
Roger, Tango-Tango.
This is Five-Lima. Go ahead.

281
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:29,022
We have visual contact. What is
your heading, speed and level? Over.

282
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,457
We're heading 0-8-0
and doing 2-5-0 knots level...

283
00:22:32,527 --> 00:22:34,995
at flight level 2-1-0-niner.

284
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,997
Five-Lima, we're opening up.

285
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:39,056
Rise and shine, gentlemen.
Let's make history.

286
00:22:39,134 --> 00:22:41,659
Roger, Five-Lima.
We'll begin closing.

287
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,761
Bring your speed back to 1-5-0.

288
00:22:43,838 --> 00:22:48,673
Commence descent to flight level 1-4-0
and turn right onto 2-6-0. Over.

289
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:54,647
We're level. Flight level 1-4-0
and steady, 2-6-0 degrees.

290
00:22:54,716 --> 00:22:56,650
The weather ahead
looks a bit threatening.

291
00:22:56,718 --> 00:22:58,709
Roger.

292
00:22:58,787 --> 00:23:01,517
- Travers, report your position.
- Ready to disengage tail cone.

293
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,181
Stand by.

294
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:12,532
- Tail cone's clear.
- Roger.

295
00:23:28,383 --> 00:23:30,544
Phase one complete.

296
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,484
Tango-Tango,
prepare to receive cable.

297
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:36,683
Tango-Tango standing by.

298
00:23:36,758 --> 00:23:38,692
Tango-Tango,
what's the turbulence back there?

299
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,129
She's all over the place. This thing's
got the response of a 747 at this speed.

300
00:23:43,198 --> 00:23:46,929
Sounds like fun. We're streaming the
drogue down. We'll see you in a minute.

301
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:49,561
Welcoming party's ready.
Good luck.

302
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:53,232
We're moving in to pick up
the drogue now. Tango-Tango out.

303
00:23:59,714 --> 00:24:01,511
I've got it.
Stand by, Kristel.

304
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,517
Standing by.

305
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:07,782
We're locked on.

306
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:09,949
Into the transfer position.

307
00:24:10,024 --> 00:24:11,218
Check.

308
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:13,692
Moving into transfer position.

309
00:24:13,762 --> 00:24:16,322
We're closing to 1-4-0 feet.

310
00:24:16,398 --> 00:24:20,266
We're closing.
We'll report when in position.

311
00:24:22,904 --> 00:24:26,237
- We're too close to the storm.
- Don't lose your nerve.

312
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:29,276
All they'll tind is a plane
that went down in the storm.

313
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:32,336
- Hurry up, Travers.
- On my way.

314
00:24:32,414 --> 00:24:34,678
The cases are hooked up
and ready.

315
00:24:36,785 --> 00:24:40,516
Charge goes off in tive minutes.
Stick to the plan and you're rich.

316
00:24:40,588 --> 00:24:42,818
Got it.

317
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:45,485
Tango-Tango in position.

318
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,824
- What's taking so long?
- Patience.

319
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:53,561
Tango-Tango, dip the plane.
I'm coming over.

320
00:24:53,635 --> 00:24:56,468
Wilco, Five-Lima.
Tango-Tango standing by...

321
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:59,063
at flight level 1-4-0
and steady 2-6-0 degrees.

322
00:25:02,277 --> 00:25:04,404
Five-Lima, I'm out ot here.

323
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:05,912
Roger.

324
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,208
What the hell is he doing?

325
00:25:13,288 --> 00:25:16,155
Five-Lima, where are the cases?

326
00:25:24,632 --> 00:25:26,725
- Kristel, we've got him.
- Roger.

327
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:29,099
Why didn't you send
the money first?

328
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:33,129
Somehow, I didn't think
you'd wait tor me if I sent it first.

329
00:25:53,962 --> 00:25:57,125
We're approaching the storm tast.
I can't hold this course much longer.

330
00:25:57,198 --> 00:26:00,292
- 9-0 seconds.
- What's keeping him?

331
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:03,530
Let's move your ass up there.

332
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,399
I'm at the cases.
Stand by.

333
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:09,409
Tango-Tango standing by.

334
00:26:09,477 --> 00:26:10,876
You tuck.

335
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:20,445
We've lost the pilot.

336
00:26:20,522 --> 00:26:22,456
- Who did you leave up there?
- No one.

337
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:31,788
Get underneath the jet.
The cases will slide over.

338
00:26:36,271 --> 00:26:38,364
Who the fuck is our guest?

339
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,514
Just get those cases.

340
00:26:51,586 --> 00:26:53,577
He's hurt bad.
What should we do with him?

341
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:56,681
Get him to a hospital, tast.

342
00:27:01,262 --> 00:27:04,231
- We're not leveling out.
- 1-0 seconds.

343
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:06,233
I've lost hydraulics!

344
00:27:22,317 --> 00:27:24,182
The cable's blown tree.

345
00:27:24,252 --> 00:27:26,686
Don't unhook it.
The cases are still there.

346
00:27:26,754 --> 00:27:29,120
- Don't lose the money, goddamn it!
- Hold it.

347
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,624
- Pull the cable!
- We gotta pull !

348
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,718
- Bypass switch one.
- Check.

349
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:35,854
- Bypass switch two.
- Keep pulling.

350
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,989
- Nothing.
- Switch to manual.

351
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:39,966
Hold the fuckin ' plane steady!

352
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:43,561
- Pull ! Come on!
- Travers, don't fuck it up!

353
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:45,936
- How's number one engine?
- Oil pressure falling.

354
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:49,408
- Come on. Don't lose the money.
- They're coming.

355
00:27:49,477 --> 00:27:51,274
Goddamn it! Shit!

356
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:55,643
- We've lost it.
- Oh, fuck!

357
00:27:57,352 --> 00:27:58,944
Release the cable.

358
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,755
Close it up.

359
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:10,153
So this is your idea
of a foolproot plan?

360
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:13,530
You stupid bastard.
Kristel, what's the report?

361
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:16,627
The hydraulics aren't functioning.
He shot them out.

362
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:18,228
Fire warning, line tour.

363
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:20,536
I'm losing altitude.
We're gonna go down !

364
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,441
Dump the tuel. You'll have to pick
your way through the peaks.

365
00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:25,376
Close the tuel valve and pumps!

366
00:28:27,148 --> 00:28:31,084
Don't bother to buckle up.
You may not want to survive this.

367
00:28:31,152 --> 00:28:33,814
Flaps to 25 degrees
betore we lose all power.

368
00:28:33,888 --> 00:28:35,913
Flaps, 25 degrees.

369
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,823
Reduce power 60%.
Shut down all generators.

370
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:45,562
Lower tlaps. You may have
to hand-crank them down.

371
00:28:53,307 --> 00:28:56,799
-You want the gear down?
-Leave the gear up. Shut down all power.

372
00:28:56,878 --> 00:29:00,370
Give me a hand
with the controls.

373
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,093
Wow! Did you catch that thunder?

374
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,755
That was too loud tor thunder.
Let's rock and roll.

375
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:53,267
One, two, three!

376
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:58,762
- I'm free!
- Radical, man.

377
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,809
Man, look at me. Watch this.

378
00:30:12,386 --> 00:30:13,819
Mike?

379
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:19,851
Shit.

380
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,493
You thought ot everything,
didn't you?

381
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:30,503
Everything except
what's happening now.

382
00:30:31,906 --> 00:30:34,898
Kill the pig!
Your tucking plan almost killed us!

383
00:30:35,977 --> 00:30:40,107
Kill the pig, my ass.
We're partners in this.

384
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:41,273
Were.

385
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,342
Give me the tracking monitor.

386
00:30:44,418 --> 00:30:46,852
What the hell are you
gonna do with it?

387
00:30:46,921 --> 00:30:48,513
Don't make him ask twice.

388
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:51,183
Give it to him.

389
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:54,558
You want it? Take it.

390
00:30:54,629 --> 00:30:57,097
It's only got
50,000 code variations.

391
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:59,360
I'll break your tucking neck
in a minute!

392
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:01,560
- Go ahead. Break my tucking neck!
- Sit down.

393
00:31:03,104 --> 00:31:05,231
In case you slept
through the landing...

394
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:08,173
you'll need all the money you can find
to buy your way out of this country.

395
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:10,437
You know it,
and I know it.

396
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:13,446
How do we get oft the mountain,
even if we tind it?

397
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,179
Kristel.

398
00:31:20,388 --> 00:31:23,255
I think we found a trequency.

399
00:31:24,826 --> 00:31:26,885
Somebody help, please.

400
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:29,589
Is there somebody there?
Somebody please help.

401
00:31:29,664 --> 00:31:32,497
Rocky Mountain Rescue. Come in.

402
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:35,693
Oh, thank God!

403
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:40,139
Ah, we're stranded.
We were hiking and lost our bearings.

404
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:42,472
We didn't expect
the weather to come in this fast.

405
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:47,003
Just take it easy.
How many people in your party? Over.

406
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:52,044
Five people.
I don't know where we are.

407
00:31:53,154 --> 00:31:57,887
I-- I see only a cylinder-type
rock formation. Over.

408
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,620
It's got to be Comb Bluft.

409
00:31:59,694 --> 00:32:03,186
Winds are too strong to get a chopper
up there. Try to stay calm.

410
00:32:03,264 --> 00:32:05,289
We're on our way.
You're gonna be all right.

411
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:08,733
Please hurry.
Billy's going into shock.

412
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:10,896
Please, we need insulin.

413
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:13,406
Please, hurry.

414
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,144
"We need insulin."

415
00:32:20,915 --> 00:32:23,042
Would you have thought ot that?

416
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,597
- Thank God you didn't leave.
- Why?

417
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:40,259
Emergency call. Five climbers
are stranded ott Comb Blutf.

418
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,497
The weather's pouring in,
and Hal's gone up alone.

419
00:32:43,571 --> 00:32:46,005
- Hal's a good climber.
- What?

420
00:32:46,073 --> 00:32:48,132
What's that supposed to mean?

421
00:32:48,209 --> 00:32:50,769
It means he can handle it himselt.

422
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,013
It he gets socked in by the weather,
they'll never make it down.

423
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:59,075
Gabe, he needs someone
who has emergency medical training...

424
00:32:59,153 --> 00:33:01,178
and knows every handle
to those peaks.

425
00:33:01,255 --> 00:33:04,850
I'm the last one he wants help from, and
that's not what I came back here for.

426
00:33:04,926 --> 00:33:07,622
Our problems are not the issue
right now. Those people are.

427
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:10,493
What it he can't do it alone?

428
00:33:10,564 --> 00:33:13,556
Look, Jessie,
I haven't climbed in months.

429
00:33:13,634 --> 00:33:15,431
You just lose the teel.

430
00:33:15,503 --> 00:33:18,267
Maybe you mean the nerve.

431
00:33:24,912 --> 00:33:26,846
I didn't mean that.

432
00:33:29,684 --> 00:33:31,618
It's okay.

433
00:33:31,686 --> 00:33:34,951
I know you don't want to be responsible
for anybody's lite anymore...

434
00:33:35,022 --> 00:33:38,014
but I'm talking about somebody
that was your best triend.

435
00:33:38,092 --> 00:33:40,026
Please, Gabe,
he took the west ridge.

436
00:33:40,094 --> 00:33:43,120
It you take the north tace,
you can beat him.

437
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:47,759
What has happened to you?
Don't you feel anything anymore?

438
00:33:47,835 --> 00:33:51,794
Feel anything?
Jessie, I came back for you.

439
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,806
I'm not talking about me.

440
00:33:53,874 --> 00:33:55,808
I'm talking about you.

441
00:33:58,212 --> 00:34:00,510
Go ahead-- Ieave.

442
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:04,073
But if you don't do it, you'll be stuck
on that ledge tor the rest of your life.

443
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:31,745
Where the hell is that
goddamn plane?

444
00:34:31,812 --> 00:34:34,337
Looks like she went down
in the storm.

445
00:34:34,415 --> 00:34:38,112
That storm tront is still building, so
even it we could send a search plane...

446
00:34:38,185 --> 00:34:41,052
it would be impossible
to see anything on the ground.

447
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:44,922
- What about roads?
- There aren't any roads up there.

448
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:46,926
Mr. Wright.

449
00:34:46,994 --> 00:34:49,462
These two F.B.I. agents
insist on seeing you.

450
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:52,192
I'm Agent Hayes.
This is Agent Michaels.

451
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:55,599
It you're concerned about your agent who
got a ride, I've nothing to tell you.

452
00:34:57,438 --> 00:35:00,771
Matheson wasn't along tor the ride.
He was working surveillance.

453
00:35:00,841 --> 00:35:02,900
Surveillance? Ot what?

454
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:06,208
The Bureau have been getting reports
Treasury jets were being monitored...

455
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,077
between Denver
and San Francisco.

456
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:11,084
We didn't tell you because
we thought it might be an inside job.

457
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:14,519
That's impossible.
You're suggesting a hijacking?

458
00:35:14,588 --> 00:35:18,024
No. Not only did I have
my best men on that tlight...

459
00:35:18,092 --> 00:35:20,526
but each one of those cases
were monitored.

460
00:35:20,594 --> 00:35:23,563
And the money
is in unexchangeable denominations.

461
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:26,623
It would be useless
tor anybody to try to steal it.

462
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,429
Except for this man.

463
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,902
- Who the hell is this?
- Name is Eric Qualen.

464
00:35:30,971 --> 00:35:33,838
We've been tracking him
without much success.

465
00:35:33,908 --> 00:35:35,842
He's a former member
ot military intelligence...

466
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,401
who found it more protitable
going to the other side.

467
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:41,937
Industrial espionage.
Hijacking diamonds trom South Africa.

468
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:44,985
Thett and disposal ot millions
in negotiable bearer bonds.

469
00:35:45,052 --> 00:35:49,546
You name it. He has the international
connections to move this currency...

470
00:35:49,623 --> 00:35:53,787
and $100 million otfers one hell
ot a temptation to this psychotic.

471
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:56,159
Jesus Christ.

472
00:36:23,457 --> 00:36:26,119
What the hell
are you doing up here, man?

473
00:36:26,193 --> 00:36:28,627
I was talking to Jessie.
She filled me in.

474
00:36:28,696 --> 00:36:30,391
Did she?

475
00:36:30,464 --> 00:36:32,557
Well, now let me till you in.

476
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:38,037
You can take your ass down and go back
to that hole you've been hiding in.

477
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,500
Once we get these people down,
I'm gone, Hal.

478
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:45,306
No. You're out ot here now.

479
00:36:47,648 --> 00:36:51,277
Why the hell did you come up here?
To prove something?

480
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:53,786
Look, I know how you teel
about me, all right.

481
00:36:53,854 --> 00:36:55,754
You don't know anything!

482
00:36:56,824 --> 00:37:00,453
You did it your way
and she died.

483
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,603
- I did what I thought was right.
- Well, you were wrong.

484
00:37:12,673 --> 00:37:15,073
It was your weight on the line
that did it.

485
00:37:15,142 --> 00:37:17,702
There wasn't time
tor anything else.

486
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,643
Well, I guess we'll never know.

487
00:37:19,713 --> 00:37:21,738
It was a bad time tor everybody.

488
00:37:21,815 --> 00:37:24,443
What the hell do you know
about bad times, man?

489
00:37:24,518 --> 00:37:27,976
You didn't love her, and you didn't
have to explain to her tamily.

490
00:37:28,055 --> 00:37:31,081
And you didn't have to look
into her eyes when she was falling!

491
00:37:31,158 --> 00:37:33,922
- Now drop it!
- No, buddy!

492
00:37:36,664 --> 00:37:39,224
It was you who dropped it.

493
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:50,610
You want to do it?

494
00:37:50,678 --> 00:37:52,270
Do it.

495
00:37:57,518 --> 00:37:59,452
You live with it.

496
00:38:30,784 --> 00:38:32,945
They're here.

497
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,011
Right on time.

498
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:37,853
How many of them are there?

499
00:38:37,925 --> 00:38:41,884
We got two heroes.
We'll greet 'em at the top.

500
00:38:49,436 --> 00:38:52,371
- Where's the helicopter?
- What the hell's going on?

501
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:59,902
- Where's the helicopter?
- It can't tly in this weather.

502
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,006
- Is either of you a chopper pilot?
- No.

503
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:05,381
What are your names?

504
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:07,477
Tucker and Walker.

505
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,385
We're missing three bags.

506
00:39:09,456 --> 00:39:11,048
What's in them?

507
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,524
None ot your tucking business!

508
00:39:12,593 --> 00:39:17,496
Suits, socks, $100 million,
the usual stutf.

509
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:20,465
Travers here was smart enough
to bring along a tracking device.

510
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:22,798
Don't use my name, goddamn it.

511
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:33,174
Key it.

512
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:38,715
Look at the map. This is where
we've lost our belongings.

513
00:39:38,786 --> 00:39:41,550
The red dots on the monitor
are the three cases.

514
00:39:41,622 --> 00:39:44,216
You recognize these locations?

515
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,055
Let me jar your memory.

516
00:39:49,129 --> 00:39:51,290
It you don't recognize them,
you're useless.

517
00:39:51,365 --> 00:39:54,300
Useless items
are usually discarded.

518
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,462
- Right, Travers?
- Get oft my back, Qualen.

519
00:39:58,372 --> 00:39:59,930
Oft?

520
00:40:00,007 --> 00:40:03,374
I haven't even got on it yet.

521
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:08,108
Once again, do you recognize
these locations?

522
00:40:13,987 --> 00:40:15,614
Ryan.

523
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,321
Yeah. We do.

524
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:27,128
Then let's go.

525
00:40:32,072 --> 00:40:34,540
Wait a minute, asshole!

526
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:39,438
Where is it?

527
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:47,211
Up there.

528
00:40:49,423 --> 00:40:53,223
Rescue 1, this is Rescue Center.
Hal? Come in, Hal.

529
00:40:53,293 --> 00:40:56,126
Nice. You're Hal?

530
00:40:58,031 --> 00:41:00,124
You, stay. You!

531
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:04,470
Fetch.

532
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:14,279
Fetch!

533
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:15,940
Do it.

534
00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:24,119
Rescue 1, this is Rescue Center.

535
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:26,386
Do you copy?

536
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,123
Hal, come in.
Hal, come in. Over.

537
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,269
Watch yourself under the overhang.
It could deliver anytime.

538
00:41:43,343 --> 00:41:46,972
Anytime you teel
like saying something, don't.

539
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,242
We're waiting, gentlemen.

540
00:41:49,316 --> 00:41:51,443
- I need my bolt gun and ice ax.
- No.

541
00:41:51,518 --> 00:41:54,578
- Don't give him anything.
- Take his coat tor insurance.

542
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:57,853
He could treeze to death !

543
00:41:57,925 --> 00:42:00,519
You've got your own problems, Hal.

544
00:42:03,797 --> 00:42:08,530
Ryan, get a rope.
I want this dog on a leash too.

545
00:42:11,371 --> 00:42:13,999
Tie it. It better hold.

546
00:42:23,116 --> 00:42:25,914
Forget me.
It you can, get away.

547
00:42:25,986 --> 00:42:27,578
Would you?

548
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:32,725
Go tetch, wonder dog.

549
00:42:55,082 --> 00:42:57,016
Move it, Walker.

550
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:03,719
Keep it taut.
Ryan, keep it taut!

551
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:10,388
Hal, come in please.
Hal, come in please. Over.

552
00:43:35,622 --> 00:43:37,249
I don't trust him.

553
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,050
Damn.

554
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:21,497
I don't think
we need two guides.

555
00:44:22,836 --> 00:44:25,134
Retire him when he comes down.

556
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:28,732
They're going to kill you !
Don't come down !

557
00:44:28,809 --> 00:44:30,902
Pull the rope. Pull the rope!

558
00:44:33,447 --> 00:44:36,007
Pull, goddamn it! Pull !

559
00:44:41,321 --> 00:44:43,881
- Come on! Pull!
- Pull it!

560
00:44:47,194 --> 00:44:48,593
Pull, goddamn it!

561
00:44:48,662 --> 00:44:50,254
Ow!

562
00:45:06,947 --> 00:45:08,141
Watch it!

563
00:45:09,549 --> 00:45:11,676
- Get him!
- No!

564
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:13,379
Do it.

565
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:37,568
Your triend just had
the most expensive tuneral in history.

566
00:46:37,637 --> 00:46:39,832
Now it's only you.

567
00:46:39,906 --> 00:46:42,431
Come in, Rescue Unit. Come in.

568
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:45,706
Hal, what's going on? Hal?

569
00:46:45,779 --> 00:46:47,303
Talk.

570
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,315
No messages, no codes,
no tricks.

571
00:46:50,383 --> 00:46:53,511
You haven't tound us.
It was a take call.

572
00:46:54,588 --> 00:46:56,715
Jessie, I've just reached
the top ot the tower.

573
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:59,122
So far,
there's no sign of anyone.

574
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:01,626
Looks like a phony call. Over.

575
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:05,722
You've got to be kidding me. Do you
want me to fly up atter you? Over.

576
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:08,233
No. Negative.
The winds are still too high.

577
00:47:08,301 --> 00:47:10,633
I'm going to ride out
the storm up here.

578
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:13,764
We'll take shelter
at the old Doug--

579
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,501
Hal, I'm losing you.
Come in.

580
00:47:15,575 --> 00:47:17,702
Come in, Hal. Over.

581
00:47:17,778 --> 00:47:20,611
Go on to the next case.

582
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:27,116
He said the tower,
but he's on Comb Blutf.

583
00:47:27,187 --> 00:47:30,452
Frank, tly me to the west valley.
The winds are never too strong there.

584
00:47:30,524 --> 00:47:32,890
It's only a half-hour climb
to the Douglas Shaft.

585
00:47:32,959 --> 00:47:35,325
It's the only shelter around.
Hal would have to go there.

586
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:39,024
- Jessie, that is a bad idea.
- Please, Frank.

587
00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:42,091
If I don't tind him,
you can come pick me up by nightfall.

588
00:47:42,169 --> 00:47:44,228
Hal would have my head.

589
00:47:44,304 --> 00:47:47,171
And it's such a handsome head.

590
00:47:49,509 --> 00:47:51,841
Please, Frank.

591
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:54,176
I'll buy one ot your paintings.

592
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:05,482
Hold up!

593
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:10,290
Where is it?

594
00:48:16,203 --> 00:48:18,535
There. On top ot the peak.

595
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:20,402
- Come on.
- Hold it.

596
00:48:22,475 --> 00:48:24,602
Looks like a winding route to me.

597
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:29,776
The tastest way is
straight up the east tace.

598
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:32,910
Ot course, there are only 12 guys
in the world who could do it.

599
00:48:32,986 --> 00:48:34,613
You want to try it?

600
00:50:19,492 --> 00:50:22,154
Gabe. What's happened?

601
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:25,095
Oh, my God. You're trozen.
Come sit down.

602
00:50:25,165 --> 00:50:29,261
Gabe, where's your pack, your sweater?
Talk to me. What happened?

603
00:50:29,336 --> 00:50:30,803
They got Hal.

604
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:33,464
The distress call was a fake.

605
00:50:34,975 --> 00:50:37,375
Fake? What do you mean
it was fake?

606
00:50:37,444 --> 00:50:41,278
Betore they crashed,
they dumped cases of money.

607
00:50:41,348 --> 00:50:43,373
- Who's they?
- I don't know.

608
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:46,817
They're using Hal to tind it.
When they do, he's dead.

609
00:50:46,886 --> 00:50:49,719
You gotta get on the radio
and call Frank...

610
00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:53,623
and tell him to call
the state police.

611
00:50:53,693 --> 00:50:56,628
The cold killed my radio,
but Frank's gonna be looking tor me.

612
00:50:56,696 --> 00:50:59,392
- We'll contact them from the chopper.
- The sun goes down in an hour.

613
00:50:59,466 --> 00:51:01,400
What do you want me to do?

614
00:51:02,469 --> 00:51:04,903
Let's take everything we need.
Let's move.

615
00:51:04,971 --> 00:51:07,337
We got to get to that next case
before they do.

616
00:51:12,946 --> 00:51:14,379
We're close!

617
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:17,382
- It's just up there!
- It better be.

618
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:22,451
You know something? I'm getting
real tucking tired of your threats.

619
00:51:22,522 --> 00:51:24,114
Are you?

620
00:52:01,594 --> 00:52:03,186
It's there.

621
00:52:15,708 --> 00:52:18,609
Oh, my God.
What do we do now?

622
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:20,270
You got a pencil?

623
00:53:03,356 --> 00:53:04,948
Over here.

624
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:28,338
Goddamn.

625
00:53:30,183 --> 00:53:32,845
The son of a bitch
is still alive!

626
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:41,358
I'm beginning to dislike
this Mr. Walker.

627
00:53:43,563 --> 00:53:46,396
He can't be tar.
Find him. Go.

628
00:54:08,688 --> 00:54:10,280
Go.

629
00:54:50,363 --> 00:54:51,295
Come on.

630
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,278
Give me a flare.

631
00:55:08,848 --> 00:55:10,782
- Meet me at Eagle's Cape.
- I'm not leaving.

632
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,784
Don't worry about me!

633
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:35,133
Gravity's a bitch, isn't it?

634
00:56:35,201 --> 00:56:37,533
Fuck the money, and fuck you!

635
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:40,128
I wasn't born to die
on a mountain.

636
00:56:40,206 --> 00:56:42,504
Where were you born to die?
Got a place picked out?

637
00:56:42,575 --> 00:56:45,237
I don't need to hear
that shit trom you, boy.

638
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,144
Maybe this boy should make
this big mouth bigger.

639
00:56:48,214 --> 00:56:50,239
Stop this!

640
00:56:50,316 --> 00:56:53,046
The tight's not here.
It's out there.

641
00:56:57,223 --> 00:56:59,157
Find us some shelter.

642
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,132
Next time you're, like,
watching MTV, you know...

643
00:57:10,203 --> 00:57:13,570
take a split second
and flip it to the Weather Channel.

644
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:16,631
I mean, hey, where would you
rather be right now?

645
00:57:16,709 --> 00:57:20,008
Here in tent city, or at home
playing some righteous air hockey?

646
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,013
Air hockey's definitely
got my vote.

647
00:57:22,081 --> 00:57:25,016
Exactly, cheesehead,
exactly.

648
00:57:25,084 --> 00:57:27,018
- Cheesehead?
- Cheesehead.

649
00:57:32,225 --> 00:57:34,693
- He was here.
- What was in there?

650
00:57:34,761 --> 00:57:36,922
Answer the man.

651
00:57:36,996 --> 00:57:40,261
- Nothing. Just tourist souvenirs.
- Or equipment.

652
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:43,234
Maybe Walker plans
to look atter his friend here.

653
00:57:43,302 --> 00:57:45,270
He's not my triend...

654
00:57:45,338 --> 00:57:48,637
and I don't like him
any more than I do you.

655
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:50,835
Nice try.

656
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:54,676
But I never underestimate the power
ot loyalty when it comes naturally.

657
00:57:55,815 --> 00:57:58,716
Not like the kind
that has to be paid tor.

658
00:58:00,253 --> 00:58:01,584
Make a tire.

659
00:58:04,924 --> 00:58:07,449
It costs a fortune
to heat this place.

660
00:58:09,996 --> 00:58:11,930
That's bad humor, I know.

661
00:58:20,006 --> 00:58:22,975
We better get some sleep.
We're gonna need it.

662
00:58:36,322 --> 00:58:38,916
Rescue units, come in.

663
00:58:38,991 --> 00:58:42,051
Again, do you read? Come in.

664
00:58:42,128 --> 00:58:45,325
What the hell
is going on up there?

665
00:58:45,398 --> 00:58:46,695
Hal.

666
00:58:46,766 --> 00:58:49,735
Jessie, do you read?

667
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:53,431
Jessie. It looks as if
we're drawing a crowd.

668
00:58:53,506 --> 00:58:56,498
We're down to a tew hours before
the whole tucking world shows up.

669
00:58:56,576 --> 00:58:58,510
- Where's the next one?
- On the tower.

670
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:00,011
How far?

671
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,181
He asked how far, goddamn it!

672
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:08,448
You know what I think? I think
you've been taking the scenic route.

673
00:59:08,521 --> 00:59:10,682
How far is it?

674
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:12,747
Halt a day.

675
00:59:12,825 --> 00:59:16,192
- It's half a day.
- Hey, Hal!

676
00:59:16,262 --> 00:59:19,959
Check it out, man. It's Hal.
Hey, man, you stuck up here too?

677
00:59:20,032 --> 00:59:22,592
- You missed a great jump yesterday.
- Walk over.

678
00:59:22,668 --> 00:59:25,296
For Christ's sakes, man,
they're just kids.

679
00:59:25,371 --> 00:59:28,306
- Why don't you let them go?
- We're not animals.

680
00:59:28,374 --> 00:59:31,537
Don't torce us to be.
Walk over.

681
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:35,638
Hey, man, was that storm
a real bummer or what?

682
00:59:35,715 --> 00:59:37,649
Me and him were
in tent city last night.

683
00:59:38,718 --> 00:59:40,515
- Yeah.
- Hey, Hal.

684
00:59:40,586 --> 00:59:43,612
We're gonna take one last jump
and split.

685
00:59:43,689 --> 00:59:45,418
You baby-sitting hikers?

686
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,055
- Run, man, run !
- What?

687
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:51,687
Get the hell out--

688
01:00:20,593 --> 01:00:22,857
Son of a bitch.
You didn't have to kill him!

689
01:00:22,929 --> 01:00:24,396
Shut up!

690
01:00:25,565 --> 01:00:27,328
Sue me.

691
01:00:30,603 --> 01:00:32,036
Fuck.

692
01:01:03,169 --> 01:01:04,261
Shoot him!

693
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:07,070
Shoot him!

694
01:01:07,139 --> 01:01:10,006
You're letting him get away!
Shoot him!

695
01:01:30,696 --> 01:01:32,630
Shit. Ow!

696
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:39,028
You murdering motherfuck.

697
01:01:40,139 --> 01:01:42,369
Kill a tew people,
they call you a murderer.

698
01:01:43,576 --> 01:01:46,477
Kill a million,
and you're a conqueror.

699
01:01:46,545 --> 01:01:48,376
Go tigure.

700
01:01:48,447 --> 01:01:51,610
Move on, Tucker.
Time is short.

701
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:39,994
Okay. Just like you said.

702
01:02:40,066 --> 01:02:42,534
He's taking them the long way around.

703
01:02:42,601 --> 01:02:45,536
To stay ahead ot them, we're gonna
have to go through that crack.

704
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:51,403
You said there was a way across.

705
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:52,808
There is.

706
01:02:52,878 --> 01:02:54,675
- Where the tuck is it?
- There.

707
01:02:54,747 --> 01:02:56,180
You blind?

708
01:02:58,951 --> 01:03:02,114
Hell with the money.
Radio the chopper.

709
01:03:03,723 --> 01:03:06,021
You just don't get it, do you?

710
01:03:06,092 --> 01:03:10,324
We're in bed now, joined at the hip,
partners in crime.

711
01:03:11,931 --> 01:03:16,459
You've crossed over, Travers,
and there's no crossing back.

712
01:03:38,991 --> 01:03:41,357
All right,
that'll keep it dry.

713
01:03:49,268 --> 01:03:51,828
Okay, let's do it.

714
01:03:55,941 --> 01:03:57,966
Get a good tooting.

715
01:03:59,578 --> 01:04:01,546
Okay.

716
01:04:07,653 --> 01:04:09,587
It's slick, Jess.

717
01:04:12,892 --> 01:04:15,087
Good foothold.

718
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,688
Jessie, don't move.

719
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:55,199
Oh, my God.

720
01:04:57,503 --> 01:04:59,664
- Let's get out of here.
- No!

721
01:05:02,007 --> 01:05:03,941
Jessie, you gotta get down !

722
01:05:04,009 --> 01:05:05,442
Come on !

723
01:05:07,413 --> 01:05:08,573
Get down!

724
01:05:10,482 --> 01:05:11,642
Stay close to me.

725
01:05:15,688 --> 01:05:18,350
All right, get down.

726
01:05:18,424 --> 01:05:19,652
Hold on to me.

727
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,457
It's on my back!

728
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:32,360
Let's get out!

729
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,970
It's otf your back.
There's nothing on your back.

730
01:05:37,042 --> 01:05:38,509
It's okay.

731
01:05:42,982 --> 01:05:46,145
Rocky Mountain Rescue Center,
this is Rescue 3. Over.

732
01:05:47,653 --> 01:05:50,349
Rescue 3, this is Rescue Center.
Go ahead.

733
01:05:51,523 --> 01:05:54,515
The vis is good. I've got
at least 20 miles in all directions.

734
01:05:54,593 --> 01:05:57,391
If anyone's out here,
I'll find them. Over.

735
01:05:57,463 --> 01:05:59,431
Roger, 3. Center out.

736
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,871
Center, this is 3.

737
01:06:12,945 --> 01:06:16,381
I've picked up a signal on the thermal
imager just north of Comb Bluff.

738
01:06:16,448 --> 01:06:18,416
Landing to investigate.

739
01:07:05,531 --> 01:07:08,557
Get out! Get out ot here!

740
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:12,726
Get the hell out!

741
01:07:17,309 --> 01:07:18,742
Jesus Christ.

742
01:07:22,314 --> 01:07:25,408
Here, I got you.
I got you.

743
01:07:25,484 --> 01:07:28,578
I got you, son. I got you.

744
01:07:28,654 --> 01:07:31,088
There's the opening.

745
01:07:31,156 --> 01:07:33,989
When I get up there,
I'll hook up the line...

746
01:07:34,059 --> 01:07:35,822
and you tollow me up.

747
01:07:35,894 --> 01:07:38,419
- Okay?
- All right.

748
01:07:46,972 --> 01:07:50,271
- The other one is tollowing.
- I'll move to a high point, tlank him.

749
01:07:50,342 --> 01:07:52,742
Don't kill him
until you get the money.

750
01:07:52,811 --> 01:07:54,244
Sure.

751
01:07:59,985 --> 01:08:02,180
Mr. Wright, we found the l.D.
on the dead pilot.

752
01:08:02,254 --> 01:08:04,415
He was known to fly for Qualen.
Over.

753
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:06,788
What about the Treasury jet?
Over.

754
01:08:06,859 --> 01:08:08,884
Its wreckage is scattered
over a two-mile area.

755
01:08:08,961 --> 01:08:11,259
No bodies have been found.
Over.

756
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:15,323
Finally. An F.A.A. satellite
has located a downed aircraft.

757
01:08:15,401 --> 01:08:19,428
Head 110 miles south-southwest
ot the park entrance.

758
01:08:20,205 --> 01:08:22,833
Treasury Control, get
the rescue people on their way.

759
01:08:22,908 --> 01:08:25,240
We're headed straight there.
One out.

760
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,709
Center out.

761
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:54,336
I got it, Jess.

762
01:08:54,406 --> 01:08:57,102
We're almost out.
I can chop through.

763
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,701
Jessie, come on up!

764
01:09:26,772 --> 01:09:28,205
Okay!

765
01:09:34,546 --> 01:09:35,843
Walker.

766
01:09:35,914 --> 01:09:38,644
Small world, ain't it?

767
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:40,742
Don't even think about it.

768
01:09:42,287 --> 01:09:44,255
Your lite's on sale, Walker.

769
01:09:44,323 --> 01:09:46,086
The price is 30 million.

770
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:48,888
- Where is it?
- It's gone.

771
01:09:50,028 --> 01:09:52,963
What the tuck are you talking about?
Where's the money?

772
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:55,898
I burned it.
Never could save anything.

773
01:09:56,902 --> 01:10:00,770
Not even a dumb mountain boy like you
would burn $30 million.

774
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:04,269
I don't make deals, Walker,
but I'll make one with you.

775
01:10:04,343 --> 01:10:07,904
Hand over the money, and I'll
just kill you and not the girl.

776
01:10:09,314 --> 01:10:10,713
Give me the money!

777
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:16,617
Gabe?

778
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:19,823
All right.

779
01:10:36,175 --> 01:10:38,803
Come on. Come on!

780
01:10:38,877 --> 01:10:40,344
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

781
01:10:40,412 --> 01:10:42,437
Kynette, what's going on?
Where's the money?

782
01:10:44,116 --> 01:10:46,516
- He said he torched it.
- Where is he now?

783
01:10:46,585 --> 01:10:48,177
He dropped down into some cave.

784
01:10:49,221 --> 01:10:51,155
You've had your chance.
Move it out now.

785
01:10:51,223 --> 01:10:53,020
- Kristel, get the C-4.
- Roger.

786
01:10:53,091 --> 01:10:55,082
Just give me five minutes.

787
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,924
I said get the fuck out of there.

788
01:10:57,996 --> 01:11:01,159
Good. And blow up that black bastard
while you're at it.

789
01:11:01,233 --> 01:11:03,793
Save me the time
ot doing it meselt.

790
01:11:22,688 --> 01:11:26,385
It you want me, I'll be here!

791
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:33,931
I'm in here!

792
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:47,945
I'm in here.

793
01:11:53,018 --> 01:11:54,645
You're making it too easy tor me.

794
01:12:19,244 --> 01:12:20,768
No bullets, bitch!

795
01:12:30,289 --> 01:12:33,918
Now, I'm gonna ask you just three times:
where's the money?

796
01:12:37,629 --> 01:12:38,891
Sissy.

797
01:12:38,964 --> 01:12:40,556
You hit like a sissy.

798
01:12:42,668 --> 01:12:46,035
Wrong answer, motherfucker!

799
01:12:48,507 --> 01:12:50,441
Get up!

800
01:12:50,509 --> 01:12:53,478
Now, I'm gonna ask you
tor a second time.

801
01:12:53,545 --> 01:12:56,036
Where is the money?

802
01:12:57,115 --> 01:12:59,083
Burned it.

803
01:12:59,151 --> 01:13:01,119
Wrong answer!

804
01:13:10,329 --> 01:13:12,593
Time to kill a mountain man.

805
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:21,595
It amazes me, in this day and age,
when a man...

806
01:13:21,673 --> 01:13:23,732
will put money...

807
01:13:23,809 --> 01:13:26,039
before the personal safety...

808
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:29,342
ot himselt and his bitch.

809
01:13:33,785 --> 01:13:36,276
At least you can go
to your grave knowing...

810
01:13:36,355 --> 01:13:38,653
that I'm gonna treat the bitch...

811
01:13:39,725 --> 01:13:41,352
right!

812
01:14:00,078 --> 01:14:03,377
Are you okay? Oh, God!
I thought he killed you!

813
01:14:04,616 --> 01:14:07,449
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

814
01:14:10,522 --> 01:14:13,514
Hal, Jessie, do you read?

815
01:14:13,592 --> 01:14:15,719
Again, do you read?
Come in.

816
01:14:17,696 --> 01:14:19,960
Hal, Jessie, what the hell's
goin' on up there?

817
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:22,295
Jessie, find it.

818
01:14:35,747 --> 01:14:37,078
It's ready.

819
01:14:38,784 --> 01:14:40,718
Rescue 1, Rescue 2.

820
01:14:40,786 --> 01:14:43,254
- Do you copy? Over.
- Here it is!

821
01:14:44,089 --> 01:14:46,387
I found Evan in the east valley.

822
01:14:46,458 --> 01:14:48,392
He's got a gunshot wound
in the back.

823
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:52,021
He's en route to the medical center
in Granby in critical condition.

824
01:14:52,097 --> 01:14:55,726
In case you can hear this,
I'm resuming my search.

825
01:14:55,801 --> 01:14:56,995
Come on !

826
01:14:59,604 --> 01:15:02,437
You'll make somebody
a tine wite someday.

827
01:15:05,177 --> 01:15:06,542
You should see me bake a cake.

828
01:15:20,358 --> 01:15:23,725
He's still alive,
tor another four minutes.

829
01:15:23,795 --> 01:15:26,696
- Where's it set?
- Primed to go oft right over his head.

830
01:15:27,566 --> 01:15:29,625
Fuck!

831
01:15:31,369 --> 01:15:33,360
Gabe, three minutes!
There's a bomb!

832
01:15:33,438 --> 01:15:36,874
Get the hell out of there!
There's a bomb over your head!

833
01:15:39,778 --> 01:15:42,144
Jessie, get the gear!

834
01:15:48,653 --> 01:15:51,588
Come on, Jessie. This way.

835
01:15:51,656 --> 01:15:54,454
That charge is gonna cause a landslide.
We gotta get to the west tace.

836
01:15:58,396 --> 01:16:00,591
Why the hell are we wasting time?

837
01:16:00,665 --> 01:16:03,498
Making sure he's not
going to tind that last case.

838
01:16:08,306 --> 01:16:10,240
You want to kill me,
don't you, Tucker?

839
01:16:11,443 --> 01:16:13,809
Well, take a number
and get in line.

840
01:16:18,517 --> 01:16:21,611
The ledge is too far. Take this rope
and pull it apart and tie it together.

841
01:16:21,686 --> 01:16:23,916
- We're gonna rappel down.
- This rope is 60 years old.

842
01:16:23,989 --> 01:16:25,820
- Will it hold?
- Don't think so.

843
01:16:25,891 --> 01:16:27,017
Bad answer.

844
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,974
Frank! Frank!

845
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,574
- No, Frank!
- He can't see you.

846
01:16:48,647 --> 01:16:50,547
Go!

847
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:09,027
Here comes our ride. Move.

848
01:17:10,735 --> 01:17:13,329
Okay, now, swing as hard
as you can. Push !

849
01:18:01,252 --> 01:18:02,378
Jump.

850
01:18:59,044 --> 01:19:01,945
Frank! Frank! Frank!

851
01:19:36,247 --> 01:19:39,114
What's happening here?
Where's the rest of the group?

852
01:19:40,752 --> 01:19:42,379
Welcome.

853
01:19:42,454 --> 01:19:43,978
What are you doing?

854
01:19:44,055 --> 01:19:45,818
Now, back oft!

855
01:19:47,092 --> 01:19:49,026
I came here to help you.

856
01:19:49,094 --> 01:19:51,153
You did.

857
01:19:51,229 --> 01:19:52,958
Don't move.

858
01:19:57,335 --> 01:19:59,428
- Frank! Frank!
- Better hurry, Tucker.

859
01:20:01,573 --> 01:20:03,006
Get out ot here!

860
01:20:26,264 --> 01:20:27,993
You stupid maniac!

861
01:20:28,066 --> 01:20:31,433
- No one told you to shoot.
- We've wasted enough time.

862
01:20:31,503 --> 01:20:32,936
Frank?

863
01:20:47,285 --> 01:20:49,412
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

864
01:20:56,594 --> 01:20:59,085
This man never hurt anybody!

865
01:21:00,498 --> 01:21:02,557
Touching.

866
01:21:02,634 --> 01:21:05,000
Kristel, check the chopper.
Let's go.

867
01:21:33,231 --> 01:21:35,165
Get back! Get back!

868
01:21:35,233 --> 01:21:38,100
Go! Jessie, run !

869
01:21:57,055 --> 01:21:58,989
That son ot a bitch.

870
01:22:00,692 --> 01:22:04,458
All right. We use a chopper
to locate the third case.

871
01:22:04,529 --> 01:22:07,396
- Then we get the hell out of here.
- No.

872
01:22:07,465 --> 01:22:09,626
There's not enough fuel
to search around.

873
01:22:09,701 --> 01:22:11,566
Just enough to get us down.

874
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:14,002
You're not running things,
Travers.

875
01:22:15,073 --> 01:22:18,008
As soon as he tinds the money,
you're as dead as me.

876
01:22:20,011 --> 01:22:22,741
Give me the monitor.

877
01:22:22,814 --> 01:22:24,179
Now.

878
01:22:37,328 --> 01:22:41,128
- What's the code, Travers?
- I told you, Qualen.

879
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:44,464
Fitty thousand possible
key code combinations...

880
01:22:44,535 --> 01:22:46,469
in 15-second intervals.

881
01:22:47,272 --> 01:22:49,832
So, what's the fucking code?

882
01:22:56,948 --> 01:22:59,382
Well, look
what Agent Travers tound.

883
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:01,384
I guess he is running things
atter all.

884
01:23:01,452 --> 01:23:03,420
Isn't he?

885
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:08,215
So what's the plan, Travers?
We use the chopper to find the money.

886
01:23:08,293 --> 01:23:09,385
Right?

887
01:23:10,495 --> 01:23:13,191
What a good idea.

888
01:23:13,264 --> 01:23:15,858
But then again...

889
01:23:15,934 --> 01:23:18,835
without a pilot...

890
01:23:18,903 --> 01:23:21,303
nobody even gets otf
this mountain.

891
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:24,574
What are you doing, Eric?

892
01:23:25,877 --> 01:23:29,040
Do you know what
real love is, Kristel?

893
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:34,083
Sacritice.

894
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:48,994
Now I'm the only one
who can tly us out of here.

895
01:23:49,067 --> 01:23:51,194
We're partners again.

896
01:23:52,337 --> 01:23:55,135
Now, take your toy...

897
01:23:55,206 --> 01:23:57,504
and tind our money.

898
01:23:59,811 --> 01:24:01,472
Radio when you tind it.

899
01:24:03,681 --> 01:24:05,615
I'm waiting here.

900
01:24:14,559 --> 01:24:16,959
All right, the last of the money's
at Crockett River.

901
01:24:17,028 --> 01:24:19,292
If we take the northern ridge,
we can get there tirst.

902
01:24:19,364 --> 01:24:23,198
There is no "we." I'm gonna go along
the north trail to Bitker Ladder.

903
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:25,292
You go on to the station
tor help.

904
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:28,862
- Are you crazy?
- It they tind the money, Hal's dead.

905
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:31,101
- Just get back there tast.
- All right.

906
01:24:31,175 --> 01:24:34,838
Roger, Control. But where the hell
are those National Guard choppers?

907
01:24:34,912 --> 01:24:37,107
They had a mechanical, sir.
It's being worked on now.

908
01:24:37,181 --> 01:24:40,344
- Their E.T.A. is one hour.
- An hour?

909
01:24:40,418 --> 01:24:43,319
You got to do better than that.
Now, get a move on. Out.

910
01:26:08,806 --> 01:26:10,103
Stop there.

911
01:26:13,945 --> 01:26:15,970
We're close.

912
01:26:16,047 --> 01:26:18,811
I got it locked in.

913
01:26:18,883 --> 01:26:22,080
So we're finished
with him, yeah?

914
01:26:22,153 --> 01:26:24,644
Yeah. Do it quietly.

915
01:26:24,722 --> 01:26:27,054
Your insane boss
just made enough noise...

916
01:26:27,125 --> 01:26:29,753
tor anyone within ten miles
to hear us.

917
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:34,664
It's been fun.

918
01:26:40,071 --> 01:26:42,005
Hey, Delmar.

919
01:26:43,074 --> 01:26:45,770
From me to you...

920
01:26:45,843 --> 01:26:48,334
you're an asshole.

921
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:49,902
Yeah?

922
01:26:49,981 --> 01:26:52,882
And you're a loudmouth,
punk slag...

923
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:55,475
who's about to die.

924
01:26:55,553 --> 01:26:56,645
Maybe.

925
01:26:58,256 --> 01:27:01,248
But in a minute I'll be dead.

926
01:27:01,325 --> 01:27:03,190
You...

927
01:27:03,261 --> 01:27:05,126
will always be an asshole.

928
01:27:05,196 --> 01:27:08,256
So go ahead and shoot.

929
01:27:08,332 --> 01:27:10,095
I'm getting cold.

930
01:27:14,138 --> 01:27:15,662
Shoot!

931
01:27:18,075 --> 01:27:19,667
Who's shooting?

932
01:27:25,783 --> 01:27:27,341
Tell me...

933
01:27:27,418 --> 01:27:29,682
do you like soccer?

934
01:27:29,754 --> 01:27:31,278
It's a great sport.

935
01:27:31,355 --> 01:27:36,156
I was a tucking good striker.
Isn't that something?

936
01:27:46,737 --> 01:27:49,365
Oh, God!

937
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,771
Fuck you!

938
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:52,866
Ah, you're swearing now.

939
01:27:54,478 --> 01:27:57,879
That's a penalty kick
tor unsportsmanlike.

940
01:28:03,054 --> 01:28:04,453
A lovely little chip shot.

941
01:28:07,024 --> 01:28:09,822
He dribbles past one detender...

942
01:28:09,894 --> 01:28:12,226
two detenders...

943
01:28:12,296 --> 01:28:13,729
three detenders.

944
01:28:21,505 --> 01:28:23,666
Striker lines up
at the penalty spot.

945
01:28:23,741 --> 01:28:25,868
He focuses on the ball.

946
01:28:25,943 --> 01:28:27,877
The crowd is on its teet.

947
01:28:27,945 --> 01:28:30,413
Striker moves to his lett.

948
01:28:30,481 --> 01:28:32,711
He draws back his foot.

949
01:28:32,783 --> 01:28:34,080
He comes in.

950
01:28:54,071 --> 01:28:56,130
Season's over, asshole!

951
01:29:04,015 --> 01:29:06,643
I said quietly.

952
01:29:38,616 --> 01:29:41,141
What the fuck is going on?

953
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:45,154
This is not right.

954
01:29:59,737 --> 01:30:01,170
Fuck!

955
01:30:19,690 --> 01:30:21,715
Goddamn.

956
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:24,158
Fuck you, Walker!

957
01:30:27,865 --> 01:30:30,129
Fucker!

958
01:30:38,242 --> 01:30:40,335
Goddamn it!

959
01:30:44,081 --> 01:30:46,049
Come in, goddamn it.

960
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:50,253
Have you got what we need?

961
01:30:50,321 --> 01:30:53,722
It's Walker. The son of a bitch
is still alive, Qualen.

962
01:30:53,791 --> 01:30:55,725
No names.
This is an open line.

963
01:30:55,793 --> 01:30:58,318
I don't give a shit,
Eric Qualen!

964
01:30:59,964 --> 01:31:01,932
Had to be insane to tie up...

965
01:31:01,999 --> 01:31:05,059
with a lowlife piece of shit
like you anyway.

966
01:31:05,136 --> 01:31:06,228
They beat us.

967
01:31:07,638 --> 01:31:11,369
A couple of fucking
mountain rangers beat us.

968
01:31:11,442 --> 01:31:15,344
Jesus Christ, that's Travers.
Get a bead on that trequency.

969
01:31:15,413 --> 01:31:18,712
They beat the man
no law agency ever could.

970
01:31:18,783 --> 01:31:20,045
Get ott the radio.

971
01:31:20,117 --> 01:31:23,052
And I'm finding that
pretty tuckin' hilarious, Qualen.

972
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,350
Stop transmitting,
you stupid bastard!

973
01:31:25,423 --> 01:31:28,449
It's hard to believe I sold out
atter 20 years...

974
01:31:28,526 --> 01:31:30,960
and this is my payback?

975
01:31:31,028 --> 01:31:34,520
To run on a mountain
with a tuckin' dirtbag like you!

976
01:31:34,598 --> 01:31:36,725
Travers, you've lost your mind.

977
01:31:37,835 --> 01:31:40,030
Lost it. Have I lost it?

978
01:31:40,104 --> 01:31:43,835
Fuckin' A, I've lost it, Qualen!
Pure, fuckin' section eight!

979
01:31:45,776 --> 01:31:47,869
I gotta go.

980
01:31:47,945 --> 01:31:50,675
I'm on my last otticial manhunt.

981
01:31:51,749 --> 01:31:53,683
Adios, mothertucker!

982
01:32:01,459 --> 01:32:03,518
You got a bearing
on that trequency yet?

983
01:32:04,728 --> 01:32:07,424
Yes. Eight minutes away.

984
01:32:25,716 --> 01:32:27,650
You're dead, Walker!

985
01:33:23,407 --> 01:33:24,601
Frank!

986
01:35:03,173 --> 01:35:04,640
I won, Walker!

987
01:35:22,926 --> 01:35:24,359
Gabe!

988
01:35:46,784 --> 01:35:48,718
Travers, come in.

989
01:35:53,857 --> 01:35:57,224
Compliments of Delmar.
Too late. You missed him.

990
01:35:57,294 --> 01:35:59,888
He decided to take a swim
to Arizona.

991
01:35:59,963 --> 01:36:02,830
- Tucker.
- That's right.

992
01:36:03,767 --> 01:36:05,928
Congratulations.

993
01:36:06,003 --> 01:36:07,095
Qualen?

994
01:36:08,405 --> 01:36:10,339
It's all over.

995
01:36:10,407 --> 01:36:13,535
Walker. You resilient bastard.

996
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:16,306
So you're still alive.

997
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:18,507
I want that money,
and I want it now.

998
01:36:18,582 --> 01:36:21,050
Qualen, the game's over.

999
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:22,210
You lost.

1000
01:36:22,286 --> 01:36:25,449
Oh, no. The game's
just getting interesting.

1001
01:36:25,522 --> 01:36:27,490
I'm airborne now, you see.

1002
01:36:29,193 --> 01:36:31,991
As a matter of tact,
I've picked up a passenger...

1003
01:36:32,062 --> 01:36:33,791
you might be interested in.

1004
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:38,068
Go on, talk.

1005
01:36:38,135 --> 01:36:40,365
I said talk, goddamn it!

1006
01:36:42,372 --> 01:36:45,205
Hal, he's got me. I'm sorry.
I thought he was Frank.

1007
01:36:45,275 --> 01:36:47,368
You get the picture, Walker?

1008
01:36:47,444 --> 01:36:49,969
Now, I want that money.

1009
01:36:50,047 --> 01:36:52,914
Meet me at the highest point
trom where you are.

1010
01:36:52,983 --> 01:36:55,679
It you don't,
we're going to find out...

1011
01:36:55,753 --> 01:36:58,654
it this little angel of yours
can fly.

1012
01:36:59,857 --> 01:37:02,519
Jessie, take him to the highest point
near Bitker Ladder.

1013
01:37:02,593 --> 01:37:05,687
I'll meet you there.
Don 't worry.

1014
01:37:05,763 --> 01:37:07,958
Love's a killer, isn't it?

1015
01:37:23,514 --> 01:37:26,711
- Where are you, Walker?
- You're getting warmer. Keep climbing.

1016
01:37:28,118 --> 01:37:29,881
You're getting closer.

1017
01:37:29,953 --> 01:37:31,921
Look out.

1018
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:52,334
I must admit,
you're a real piece of work.

1019
01:37:52,409 --> 01:37:55,139
Yeah, and I must admit,
you're a real piece of shit.

1020
01:38:05,322 --> 01:38:07,290
Throw it up, or I'll kill her.

1021
01:38:07,357 --> 01:38:10,383
You do, and the cash is gone.

1022
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:14,123
- The money.
- I want you to put her down.

1023
01:38:14,198 --> 01:38:15,631
Over there!

1024
01:39:09,686 --> 01:39:11,153
Jessie, run !

1025
01:39:11,221 --> 01:39:13,451
- What about you?
- Run!

1026
01:39:14,758 --> 01:39:16,191
Run !

1027
01:39:18,061 --> 01:39:19,323
Come on, Qualen.

1028
01:39:19,396 --> 01:39:22,559
I got what you want.
Come on.

1029
01:39:30,507 --> 01:39:32,941
Come on. Come and get it.

1030
01:39:37,881 --> 01:39:39,815
Come on. Closer.

1031
01:39:40,884 --> 01:39:43,284
Come on, closer.

1032
01:39:43,353 --> 01:39:45,583
- A little closer, Qualen.
- Throw it in.

1033
01:39:45,656 --> 01:39:47,556
Bring it closer.

1034
01:39:48,659 --> 01:39:49,751
Oh, my God.

1035
01:39:57,067 --> 01:39:58,659
Throw it in.

1036
01:40:15,786 --> 01:40:17,754
Damn you, Walker!

1037
01:40:34,438 --> 01:40:35,598
Run !

1038
01:41:14,811 --> 01:41:17,371
Jessie, move!

1039
01:41:28,258 --> 01:41:29,350
Come on.

1040
01:42:09,332 --> 01:42:12,665
It's just us now,
you piece of shit.

1041
01:42:27,551 --> 01:42:29,883
Watch out!

1042
01:42:29,953 --> 01:42:31,921
Get out of there, man !

1043
01:42:35,926 --> 01:42:37,587
Stick around.

1044
01:42:41,298 --> 01:42:42,663
We had a deal...

1045
01:42:42,732 --> 01:42:45,200
and now we've
just got each other.

1046
01:42:46,403 --> 01:42:48,564
You're not atraid to die.

1047
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:55,375
Come on, get him!

1048
01:43:00,984 --> 01:43:01,746
Get out ot there!

1049
01:43:02,819 --> 01:43:04,286
Remember, shithead.

1050
01:43:04,354 --> 01:43:06,948
Keep your arms and legs
in the vehicle...

1051
01:43:07,023 --> 01:43:08,718
at all times!

1052
01:43:29,379 --> 01:43:31,370
Give me the rope!

1053
01:43:35,218 --> 01:43:36,651
Okay.

1054
01:43:40,590 --> 01:43:41,989
I'm out ot here.

1055
01:44:04,848 --> 01:44:08,944
Gabe, buddy, you think you could have
put a little less eftort in that climb?

1056
01:44:09,019 --> 01:44:11,715
I mean,
I thought you were in shape.

1057
01:44:13,089 --> 01:44:15,080
- I guess I'm just talling apart.
- Yeah.

1058
01:44:15,158 --> 01:44:16,853
This is Agent Wright. Copy?

1059
01:44:16,927 --> 01:44:20,624
- Yeah, copy.
- Please identify yourselves. Over.

1060
01:44:20,697 --> 01:44:23,291
Yeah, this is Hal Tucker,
Rocky Mountain Rescue.

1061
01:44:23,366 --> 01:44:26,028
Hey, we're glad
to see you guys.

1062
01:44:26,102 --> 01:44:28,036
If you're looking
for Mr. Qualen...

1063
01:44:28,104 --> 01:44:31,164
try about 4,000 feet
south of here.

1064
01:44:31,241 --> 01:44:33,937
He'll be the one
wearing a helicopter. Over.

1065
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:35,500
Good.

1066
01:44:35,579 --> 01:44:37,604
I'll arrange transportation
for the three of you...
