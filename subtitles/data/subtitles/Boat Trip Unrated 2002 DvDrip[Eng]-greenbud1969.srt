1
00:00:31,315 --> 00:00:33,681
I love you.

2
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,809
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

3
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:40,554
Will you marry me?

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,951
Baby...

5
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:46,991
Baby...

6
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:50,123
Baby, your breath smells
like dog food.

7
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:54,035
Just a hint of Rottweiler butt.

8
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,329
You're on notice, Rocco.

9
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,304
When Felicia moves in,
you have to clean up your act.

10
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,634
Bon appêtit.

11
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,862
I have a very big surprise
for you.

12
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:57,158
A very big surprise.

13
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:01,763
I know you're dying to know, I won't
tell you, no matter how much you beg.

14
00:02:02,306 --> 00:02:04,797
No. Not even a hint.

15
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:19,949
Wow, this is incredible, Jerry.
What 's this all about?

16
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:25,292
Felicia, from the first moment
I met you, I...

17
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:31,759
I mean... from the first moment
I saw you...

18
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:36,129
- What I'm trying to say, Felicia...
- You look sick all of a sudden.

19
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,705
Are you alright?

20
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,876
Motion sickness.

21
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:44,741
The reason why I brought you
up here is to tell you...

22
00:02:44,948 --> 00:02:47,746
...to say...
- Yes?

23
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:51,578
- To ask, to communicate...
- Just spit it out.

24
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:57,987
I'm sorry, baby, I didn't mean it!

25
00:02:58,195 --> 00:03:00,789
Don't cover me in puke
and try and call me baby.

26
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:03,057
I'll make it up to you, Felicia.

27
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:06,427
- Will you marry me?
- No.

28
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,803
Thank you. You made me
the happiest... What?

29
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,570
- I met someone.
- Met someone?

30
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,745
Andrê and I have all the things
that we don't, Jerry.

31
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,743
- Andrê?
- I introduced you once.

32
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,542
He details my BMW.

33
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:24,585
You dump me for a guy who goes to
work in a jumpsuit and rubber boots?

34
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:29,384
Andrê and I connect on a level
that you and I just never could.

35
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:32,391
Jerry, I'm so sorry.

36
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,276
She dumped us, Rocco.

37
00:03:47,611 --> 00:03:50,774
I know you don't care.
You can lick your own balls.

38
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,619
<i>I' m not in. Leave a message</i>,
<i>or don't leave a message. Whatever</i>.

39
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:36,224
<i>Hello Jerry</i>,<i>it's me</i>.
<i>Pick up</i>.

40
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,519
<i>Dude</i>,<i>I know you're there</i>.

41
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,197
<i>Come on</i>,<i>quit acting like</i>
<i>a little kid. You're so immature</i>.

42
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:43,860
Pick up now, or I'm gonna fart
into the phone.

43
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:48,570
Leave me alone.
I'm wallowing in self-pity.

44
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:51,566
It 's time to rejoin the living, Jerry.
Come on, we're going out tonight.

45
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:55,142
- Not interested.
- Saddle up dough, baloney pony.

46
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:58,781
It 's operation "Storm in the Foxholes".
China Club, 21:OO hours.

47
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:01,348
<i>Ourobjective?</i>
<i>Penetrate the enemy</i>.

48
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,418
- Stop calling me. I'm not going.
<i>- This is nonnegotiable</i>,<i>Jerry</i>.

49
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:06,885
Either meet me tonight,
or I'm gonna ask out your sister.

50
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,684
And you know she'll go 'cause she's
freaky like that. We both know her.

51
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:13,192
- Hang up. The toilet 's stuffed up.
- I gotta go, there's an emergency.

52
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,627
I gotta go. See ya.

53
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:29,710
Thanks for fitting me in today,
Daniel. I'm so tight.

54
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:42,519
Go really deep this time.

55
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,364
Give it to me harder.

56
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,201
Harder.

57
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:05,511
Harder.

58
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:14,621
Harder.

59
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:21,356
Come on, Daniel.
Is this the best you can do?

60
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:29,166
Ragoni, what the hell
are you doing?

61
00:06:29,373 --> 00:06:31,841
I was just warming up for you.

62
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:41,911
- Marshall, is that you?
- Nick!

63
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:45,054
Hey! Long time no see.
How you doing?

64
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:48,452
You've got to give me the name
of your new escort service.

65
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,920
Cut it out, Nick.

66
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:53,494
This is my fiancêe. Sheri.
She ain't no escort skank.

67
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:56,359
- She and I are in love.
- That 's right.

68
00:06:56,566 --> 00:07:00,593
Marshall here is the most interesting
and exciting man I've ever met.

69
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:05,036
- And he's a wonderful lover.
- Oh, I get it, she's retarded.

70
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:07,574
Actually she's one of the sharpest
bartenders at Hooters.

71
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:12,408
Marshy. Excuse me, fellas. I'm going
to attend to the landing strip.

72
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:17,983
- And classy, too.
- We met on a cruise.

73
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,051
There's just something
about the ocean air, the sun.

74
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:24,921
It really makes it easier to meet
people. We connected right away.

75
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:26,595
Very first night.

76
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,022
- With her? Very first night?
- Yes!

77
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,929
There are dozens of women
just as friendly as her on board.

78
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,230
Dude, I gotta tell ya.
Whatever you're doing...

79
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,500
take a week off and get yourself
on one of those boats.

80
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:44,169
There's a line at the can.
Honey, can we skip dinner?

81
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:49,114
You look so hot you got me
in the mood for a takeout in bed.

82
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:54,723
Tongue.

83
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:00,429
Wow.

84
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:12,398
Wasn't that crazy Marshall Geller who
worked in our high school cafeteria?

85
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:17,546
Nope. That was crazy Marshall
Geller, my new personal hero.

86
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,339
Dude, let 's bolt.

87
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:22,450
Hanging around some stupid bar
is no place to meet women.

88
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:25,678
What are you talking about? You've
begged me to come here for months!

89
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:27,686
Jerry, buddy...

90
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,816
trust me...

91
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:33,223
I have seen the light.

92
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:05,252
Son of a bitch!

93
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:06,886
That was my space!

94
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:09,531
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you right back, buddy!

95
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:12,429
Back off. I don't wanna see an out
of shape slob get his butt kicked.

96
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,661
- He ain't that out of shape.
- I'm talking about you!

97
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:16,463
You break a sweat
changing your shoes.

98
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:19,005
- Stop. Bite me!
- Blow me!

99
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:21,040
- Kiss my ass!
- Fuck your mother!

100
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:24,475
Oh, yeah? No one would want to fuck
my mother 'cause she's too ugly.

101
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:26,478
- I think I lost that one, didn't I?
- Oh, yeah.

102
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:34,289
Okay. That 's the 7-day, 6-night
fun in the sun singles package...

103
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,857
with the standard 3 to 1
female to male ratio.

104
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,686
Just as the doctor ordered,
right, buddy?

105
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:43,331
I don't know, Nick.
I don't think I'm ready for this.

106
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:46,297
Not ready? Come on.
It 's been six months.

107
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,403
I don't like the sun...

108
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:50,368
and I get seasick.

109
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:53,567
I don't know what to say
to strange women.

110
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:56,644
We're not going for the discourse.
We're going for the intercourse.

111
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,407
Sex! That 's all you ever think about.
Sex, sex, sex!

112
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,340
We'll take it.

113
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:04,443
There you go.

114
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,350
Larry, you're still here.

115
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,655
- Your mother died.
- What?

116
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,660
- When?
- This morning. I'm sorry.

117
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,562
- I thought you got my Post-it.
- Okay, thanks, Michael.

118
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,669
Alright. Now, gentlemen...

119
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,602
I might want you to consider this
stateroom. It 's a little bit larger...

120
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,044
Would you excuse me
for just a moment?

121
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:37,717
Help!

122
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:40,446
Mama, no!

123
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:45,921
- You!
- Fuck you, pal.

124
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:47,687
- Fuck you back.
- Fuck your mother.

125
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,856
- No one would fuck my mother...
- We've been through this before!

126
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:53,734
Excuse me. What seems to be
the problem here?

127
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:56,064
This guy. Pecker face.

128
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:58,002
- That 's the problem
- This guy's a jerk.

129
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,574
Alright, Brian, you know what?
Enough. Let me handle this.

130
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:03,143
- You go check on the ski packages.
- Yeah. Fuck off.

131
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,041
- Ski over near the Maui getaways.
- Yeah.

132
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,648
- Remember? Since the changeover?
- Yeah, I got it.

133
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:10,084
I am so sorry.

134
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:11,879
Brian's had a little problem
with the...

135
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,251
And the... and the... and the...

136
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:19,758
Yeah, bad news.
But now he's doing fine.

137
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:23,729
He's doing a lot of great work
with unwed teenage mothers.

138
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:26,499
So... Alright.

139
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:31,934
Let 's see... 7-day, 6-night
vacation cruise. Is that correct?

140
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:33,905
- That 's the one.
- Right.

141
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,477
Yeah, right. Okay.

142
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:44,287
You guys are set, gentlemen.

143
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:48,150
I think you'll have a very good time.
Please enjoy your vacation.

144
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:49,416
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

145
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,253
Hey, and you should probably
do something about that guy.

146
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,721
Don't worry,
I've already taken care of it.

147
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:56,558
And, hey...

148
00:11:56,766 --> 00:12:00,600
- I'm a letter writer.
- Duly noted.

149
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,669
Alright.

150
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:07,306
Bye-bye, now.

151
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:10,373
I'm too upset to work ski packages.

152
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,277
- I can't believe you took care of them.
- I took care of them alright.

153
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:17,744
'Cause no one calls
my little pecker a pecker.

154
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,785
- Huh?
- Yeah.

155
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:33,294
Wow! Look at the size
of that thing!

156
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:36,565
And just think,
it 's filled with available women.

157
00:12:36,773 --> 00:12:39,503
Yeah! And here's the beauty part
of the whole thing.

158
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:42,576
They can't get away from us.
We'll be in the middle of the ocean.

159
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,681
They can try, but they'll drown
or be eaten by sharks. It 's perfect.

160
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:51,549
Sometimes I think there's something
seriously wrong with you.

161
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,814
I can live with that.

162
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:58,391
- Excuse me. Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

163
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:01,257
- You board everybody on this ship?
- Yes, sir.

164
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:03,995
Let me ask you a question,
from guy to guy.

165
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:06,359
Is there a lot of sweet ass
on this ship?

166
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:08,594
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

167
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:10,568
- Yes! Right, Jerry?
- Yeah!

168
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:13,004
Alrighty!

169
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:17,409
And all filled with hot,
beautiful women!

170
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:21,144
- Yes!
- Awesome, awesome, awesome!

171
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:26,345
Think of the sexiest creatures
boarding this love boat as we speak!

172
00:13:32,662 --> 00:13:35,654
- Alright, this is great!
- Yeah, you know!

173
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:38,963
- Hello!
- Hey! What 's up, guys?

174
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,900
How you doin'?

175
00:13:41,671 --> 00:13:43,730
Alright!

176
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,067
- Lovely boat, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

177
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:48,506
Don't you ever doubt me.

178
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,946
What the hell was that?

179
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:03,489
Well, onboard entertainment.

180
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,753
You know? I bet Cirque du Soleil
is here. Like Vegas.

181
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:09,295
- Cool.
- Right?

182
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,096
Hey, how are ya?

183
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:23,410
There it is. Stateroom 211.

184
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:27,105
The number that 'll be on every
woman's lips by the end of the trip.

185
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,945
Let 's do it.

186
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:37,451
That 's weird.

187
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,557
Only one bed.

188
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,861
I know why.

189
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:45,967
We're going to have so much sex one
guy's always going to sleep out.

190
00:14:46,236 --> 00:14:47,294
Yeah, right.

191
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:50,564
You better hope that couch
is more comfortable than it looks.

192
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,636
There's a mirror on the ceiling.

193
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:57,807
Excelente.

194
00:14:58,014 --> 00:15:01,711
That way the babes can watch me
get my peak on.

195
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,920
Check this out, Jer.

196
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:07,589
- Four racquetball courts.
- Hey!

197
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,193
- Nine cocktail lounges, a casino.
- Six and eight 's a running mate!

198
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,087
A video arcade...

199
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:16,993
Onboard chest waxing salon...

200
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,296
- Chest waxing?
- Yes, of course, for swimming.

201
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:24,668
Let me see that.

202
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:29,769
Club Socrates wants you to know
you'll be treated like a queen.

203
00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:35,543
- You mean king?
- Queen. It says so right there.

204
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:39,647
That 's weird.

205
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,889
Hello?
Ring, ring, ring.

206
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:49,257
Everybody conga.

207
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:54,801
<i>Conga</i>,<i>conga</i>,<i>conga</i>,<i>everybody party</i>
<i>Party</i>,<i>party</i>,<i>party</i>

208
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:56,733
<i>Five o'clock today</i>

209
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,172
Yeah, baby! I told you, Jer.
This boat is wild!

210
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:07,378
- Where's the party, sweet thing?
<i>- Stateroom 209. Stateroom 209</i>.

211
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,510
It 's casual.

212
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:24,129
To fresh scratches on our backs.

213
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:27,098
- Scotch and soda, please.
- Coming right up, sir.

214
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:32,773
Oh, please.

215
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:36,241
Why do they always
have to play Liza?

216
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:39,415
I don't know.
I kinda like "Liza With a Z".

217
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:41,982
Yeah, it 's kind of cool
for making out.

218
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,115
I prefer Johnny Mathis, myself.

219
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:49,917
Yeah, if you're gonna
make out with a dude.

220
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:55,163
That is very funny.

221
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,969
My name is Faversham.
Lloyd Faversham.

222
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:01,932
- Nick Ragoni.
- Nick.

223
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:03,264
- Jerry.
- Jerry.

224
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:05,566
- Is this your first cruise?
- No, my third.

225
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,834
- And you?
- Numero uno.

226
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:13,708
Then you are going to positively
adore it. It is one wild...

227
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,476
...decadent week.
- That 's why we're here, right?

228
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:18,620
- All night parties.
- Excellent.

229
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:21,847
- Midnight skinny dipping.
- Sign me up!

230
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:26,859
And if you're into it,
lots of sex, sex... sex.

231
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:29,497
You hear that, Jer?
All the sex a man could want.

232
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,265
Well, then you must visit
the hole in one room.

233
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,199
Oh? They have an onboard
driving range?

234
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:40,900
Some of the chaps down there
do swing some very large clubs.

235
00:17:41,911 --> 00:17:45,039
You two have an open relationship?

236
00:17:45,248 --> 00:17:47,182
Open? What do you mean
by "open relationship"?

237
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:50,045
- I mean do you date?
- Of course we date.

238
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:51,686
- That 's why we're here.
- Yeah.

239
00:17:51,888 --> 00:17:53,651
That 's absolutely wonderful.

240
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:57,292
We must get together sometime.
Go for a midnight swim.

241
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,620
Do whatever feels right.

242
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:03,356
That is what a gay cruise
is all about.

243
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:09,396
I see.

244
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:11,698
Hear that, Jerry?

245
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:15,366
We can do whatever we want.
Whatever feels right.

246
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:18,672
That 's what a gay cruise
is all about.

247
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:22,350
Whatever we want to do,
we can do it...

248
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:24,645
because it 's a gay cruise.

249
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:28,415
It 's a gay cruise, Jerry,
not a bi-cruise. It 's a gay cruise!

250
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:34,058
Capital G, capital A,
capital YMCA gay cruise, Jerry!

251
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:36,731
Damn, damn, damn!

252
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,568
I wonder how many other people
made the same mistake I did.

253
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:47,331
No one! Shit! Jerry!
Don't worry, buddy!

254
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,637
I'm bringing you back home! I'm gonna
get you out of here! Let 's go!

255
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,081
Help! Help! Somebody help us!

256
00:18:57,286 --> 00:18:59,948
We're straight! We're straight.

257
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:06,391
Hey, Nick! Stop acting like a jerk!
We'll figure this out!

258
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:09,588
What are we gonna do, Jerry?
We gotta get off this boat!

259
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,324
Excuse me sir, do you know
where we can get off real quick?

260
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:14,799
- Try the hole in one room.
- I'm starting to think that 's...

261
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:18,098
not a real driving range, Jer.
In fact, I'm convinced of it.

262
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:20,605
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

263
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:23,641
We're trapped like rats!

264
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:29,082
What?

265
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:31,150
I checked our itinerary.

266
00:19:31,354 --> 00:19:33,618
We don't dock for four days.

267
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:36,121
Why do I ever listen to you?

268
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,555
Are you implying
that this is somehow my fault?

269
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,059
I'm not implying it.
I'm saying it.

270
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:44,658
If you hadn't insulted the travel agent,
none of this would've happened.

271
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:49,197
- Maybe there's another explanation.
- Yeah? What?

272
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,002
Maybe that travel agent thought
he was doing you a favor.

273
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:54,642
Because...

274
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:57,336
- You know.
- Because what?

275
00:19:57,547 --> 00:19:59,606
Because you're a little fem.
That 's why.

276
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:02,410
You always dress real nice.
You're in shape. You're neat.

277
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,212
And you use those pastel
colored balls at the bowling alley.

278
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:07,855
Don't think that got past me.

279
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:15,025
You're an idiot.
A thick-headed moron.

280
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,132
Felicia was right. I should've
dumped your ass years ago!

281
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:20,962
If you wanted to dump somebody's
ass, it should've been Felicia's.

282
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:24,966
That chick was Satan's sister, bro.
Yeah! Devil in a d-cup!

283
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,869
Felicia was as frosty a bitch
as I've ever seen in my life!

284
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:29,510
I'm gonna kill ya!

285
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:31,803
Get off.

286
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,213
I know I heard
do the bump-bump time.

287
00:20:37,353 --> 00:20:40,117
Hey you, don't get the wrong idea.

288
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:42,486
Hector always gets the wrong idea.

289
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:45,390
That 's why he is no longer welcome
in the state of Missouri.

290
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,858
Buddy, you pranced into the wrong
cabin. My friend and I...

291
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:51,763
we're not gay.

292
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,403
Ring, ring. Hold the phone. What you
tell me? You two guys are not gay?

293
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:58,005
That 's right!

294
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:02,202
Go on, pull Hector's other leg.
He's got bells on it.

295
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:04,506
I'm getting out of here.

296
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:09,517
Gee. What hasn't gotten into him?

297
00:21:12,388 --> 00:21:14,549
Out.

298
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:16,486
<i>Oh</i>,<i>here he comes</i>

299
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,683
<i>Watch out</i>,<i>boy</i>
<i>He'll chew you up</i>

300
00:21:18,895 --> 00:21:20,624
<i>Oh</i>,<i>here he comes</i>

301
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,559
<i>He's a maneater</i>

302
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:25,191
<i>Oh</i>,<i>here he comes</i>

303
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:27,426
<i>Watch out</i>,<i>boy</i>
<i>He'll chew you up</i>

304
00:21:27,637 --> 00:21:29,161
<i>Oh</i>,<i>here he comes</i>

305
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,602

<i>lwouldn't if lwere you</i>

307
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:45,684
Bachelor number 2. What 's the most
unusual place you ever made love?

308
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:50,325
Well, once I did it in a dressing
room in International Male.

309
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:53,086
Right. How about you,
bachelor number 3?

310
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:56,028
What 's the most unusual place
that you ever made love?

311
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,463
Inside a woman.

312
00:22:00,603 --> 00:22:02,036
Oh, no...

313
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:10,877
Hey! Who do I have to screw
to get a drink around here?

314
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:13,773
Oops.

315
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,113
Oops.

316
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:21,823
Hey buddy, you okay?

317
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:25,493
Do I look gay?

318
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,094
Never saw an old gay
grandpa before.

319
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:41,370
Where are all the gay people at?

320
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:44,239
You're all always supposed
to want to party.

321
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:47,610
Oops. Oops.

322
00:23:18,414 --> 00:23:22,145
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine!

323
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,958
<i>Men on dates</i>,<i>holding hands</i>,
<i>touching</i>,<i>kissing</i>.

Help! Pick me up!

327
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:54,114
Get me out of here!

328
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:56,784
Drop down a ladder!

329
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,111
I like girls!

330
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,298
Please!

331
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,594
Please, come back!

332
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:54,340
I don't know anything about a flare
gun. I swear I was here all night.

333
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:57,808
A flare gun? I don't know anything.
I was here all night.

334
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,876
Flare gun? I don't know nothing
about no stinking flare gun.

335
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:04,684
- Oh, shit!
- Okay.

336
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,381
Here we are.
You should go change now.

337
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:11,287
Where's your robe?

338
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:13,189
Okay.

339
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:15,987
Okay, I give up.
I did it.

340
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:19,790
Hey, Jer, how was your evening?

341
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:24,202
Hi. Your friend
had a little too much to drink.

342
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:26,101
She thinks I'm drunk.

343
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:29,109
- Nicky, Nicky!
- Alright, alright.

344
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:32,178
I fell in the pool.

345
00:25:33,182 --> 00:25:35,810
- You're sitting on my balls!
- Okay...

346
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:37,451
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

347
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:40,613
- Good night.
- You're getting me all wet.

348
00:25:46,996 --> 00:25:48,327
Jerry!

349
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:50,522
Wake up, I'm starving!

350
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:52,993
Come on, Jerry!

351
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:57,033
Dude, don't make me go up there
by myself. Get up.

352
00:25:57,773 --> 00:25:59,536
Jerry!

353
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:01,265
Screw it.

354
00:26:01,844 --> 00:26:05,940
What am I afraid of?
How gay can a buffet be?

355
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:37,336
Is this seat taken?

356
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:39,138
- Actually...
- I hate dining alone.

357
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,714
- I bet you feel the same way too.
- I'm okay with it, actually.

358
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:46,013
I see you took the omelette,
the waffles and the flapjacks.

359
00:26:46,222 --> 00:26:50,886
Hungry little man, aren't you?
Do you care for a bite of my sausage?

360
00:26:52,094 --> 00:26:54,358
In England, we call them bangers.

361
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:58,692
Captain, can you come over here
a minute, please?

362
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:03,031
There's a small craft off the starboard
trying to get our attention.

363
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:08,268
- Help!
- Help us!

364
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:11,571
- Help!
- Somebody save us!

365
00:27:13,282 --> 00:27:15,182
Jesus...

366
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:19,013
Sound the alarm.
All hands on dick... deck.

367
00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:21,513
Deck!

368
00:27:28,998 --> 00:27:31,057
Tea?

369
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,000
For you.

370
00:27:45,214 --> 00:27:47,614
Oh, my God.

371
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:54,880
- I must be dreaming. Pinch me.
- Sure. My pleasure.

372
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,820
- I didn't say on my ass.
- You didn't not say it.

373
00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:02,088
I didn't think
I had to specify. Jesus.

374
00:28:06,535 --> 00:28:09,265
Nick, Nick.
Look, you gotta help me out.

375
00:28:09,471 --> 00:28:11,439
Remember that woman that dragged
me into the room last night?

376
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:13,801
I can't get her off my mind.

377
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,135
She kissed me. Technically it was
mouth to mouth. But it was fabulous.

378
00:28:17,346 --> 00:28:20,372
I mean, I gotta find her.
I mean I was so wasted...

379
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:26,346
- Who are they?
- The answer to our prayers.

380
00:28:26,555 --> 00:28:28,989
Twelve of the most gorgeous
creatures I've ever seen.

381
00:28:29,658 --> 00:28:32,786
But I'm not greedy.
I'll share.

382
00:28:32,995 --> 00:28:35,725
Go ahead, pick... two.

383
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:41,268
No. This girl's fabulous.
She's special.

384
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,233
I gotta find her.

385
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,138
She's special. Special.

386
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,051
Hello.

387
00:29:00,756 --> 00:29:03,816
- Hi.
- Who are you?

388
00:29:04,026 --> 00:29:06,893
I'm Nick Ragoni, the most grateful
man on the planet.

389
00:29:07,096 --> 00:29:09,690
I'm Inga. Very pleasurable
to meet you.

390
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:11,159
How'd you all get here?

391
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:13,558
We are the Swedish sun
tanning team...

392
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:16,795
on our way to the Hawaiian
Tropics Tanning Competition.

393
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,496
Some bonehead shot down
our helicopter.

394
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:22,199
Coach had to make water landing.

395
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:25,244
I didn't think this would happen
until I died and went to heaven.

396
00:29:25,781 --> 00:29:28,875
It 's a lucky thing we were picked
up by a boat full of homo boys.

397
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:31,882
It would be terrible to have
straight men hassling and ogling us...

398
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:35,079
while we're trying to work on
our even tan lines.

399
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,721
You're so right.

400
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:42,420
Lucky I'm gay!

401
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:46,695
I'm super gay! I'm mega...
I'm gay enormous!

402
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:51,096
I'm so gay!
But that 's good.

403
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:55,436
'Cause now you guys can all feel
comfortable in front of me...

404
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:58,704
and take off your tops and stuff.

405
00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:01,207
And I can do this for you.

406
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:05,148
I can put tanning oils
and creamy lotions...

407
00:30:05,354 --> 00:30:08,414
all over your luscious bodies.

408
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:15,023
And there won't be any worries
for you because I'm so gay!

409
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:24,470
Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby!
Almost finished!

410
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:31,005
Okay, let 's do the back.

411
00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:35,309
The first time I think
I realized I was gay...

412
00:30:35,517 --> 00:30:38,680
was when I was around twelve
in Scouts.

413
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:40,912
I really liked putting on
that kerchief.

414
00:30:42,124 --> 00:30:44,388
In fact, it was the only part
I liked about it.

415
00:30:44,793 --> 00:30:46,488
That and the nude swimming.

416
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:50,654
Anyway, I hope you gals
all feel comfortable around me.

417
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:52,760
"Ja", Nick.

418
00:30:52,968 --> 00:30:56,028
'Cause I sure do feel comfortable
around you.

419
00:30:57,573 --> 00:31:00,940
All done. Who's next?
How about you, Ursula?

420
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:05,512
Ready for your second coat?
These thighs look a little dry.

421
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:07,712
There we go.

422
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:11,176
What do you want?

423
00:31:13,522 --> 00:31:15,422
What the hell is that?

424
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,855
I got this from that dude
over there. He's hot.

425
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:24,465
You are no gay homo man.
I am Sonya, coach of tanning team.

426
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:25,928
- What?
- Quiet!

427
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,658
As long as these women
are in training...

428
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,829
there will be no trouser snakes
near their hot luscious popos.

429
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,064
Put me down!

430
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:35,300
Coach of the tanning team.
That 's ridiculous.

431
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:37,672
If I want to talk
to any of these ladies, I will.

432
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,111
And there's not a damn thing
you can do to stop me.

433
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,305
Oh, yeah?

434
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,424
What the hell happened to you?

435
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,791
I died and went to heaven.

436
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,059
And then some muscle bound blonde
dwarf knocked me back down to hell.

437
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:02,897
- What?
- You know those 12 gorgeous hotties?

438
00:32:03,105 --> 00:32:05,437
They've got
a goddamn bodyguard.

439
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,606
I can take disappointments, Jer.

440
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:15,374
But little Mickey's already known
such heartache in a short life.

441
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:17,848
Well then I guess all three of us
struck out.

442
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,579
I still can't find that girl.

443
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:22,916
I've looked everywhere.

444
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,821
You know, I've kissed
Felicia for four years...

445
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:29,327
and never felt anything like
I felt last night.

446
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:32,627
That girl is special.
I gotta find her.

447
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,697
You're abandoning me?
What am I supposed to do?

448
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:41,706
This is a luxury cruise!
Not everything's gay-oriented.

449
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,935
No more bets.

450
00:32:44,846 --> 00:32:46,973
Red three is the winner.

451
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:53,854
Beautiful. Poker.
This is gonna be sweet.

452
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:57,591
These trouser pilots are no match
for a lusty hetero like myself.

453
00:32:57,793 --> 00:33:00,557
This will be like taking candy
from a baby.

454
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:03,356
Why is that?
Are gay men notorious bad gamblers?

455
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,726
Awful. They can't bluff.

456
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:07,834
They look at the cards,
they start giggling. Terrible.

457
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:12,996
Promise me you won't act like a gay
bashing narrow minded Neanderthal.

458
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,903
Jerry, buddy, you're talking to me.

459
00:33:15,377 --> 00:33:19,313
- Lady, couple of clubs, pass a flush...
- Hello gays... guys.

460
00:33:20,182 --> 00:33:22,150
- Mind if I join you?
- Sure thing, gorgeous.

461
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,220
I can't remember.
Does a straight beat a flush?

462
00:33:27,356 --> 00:33:29,620
Damn! I really thought
I had this one.

463
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:31,725
Listen, Nick.

464
00:33:31,994 --> 00:33:34,428
I don't want you to take offense, but
can I give you a piece of advice?

465
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:38,063
- What?
- Don't clear your throat.

466
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,899
What?

467
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:42,662
Every time you bluff,
you clear your throat.

468
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:44,304
I do?

469
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:48,038
Don't play the cards.
Play the players.

470
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:50,840
Right. Here we go.

471
00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:53,674
Any up.
Five or shoot. Three card Monty.

472
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:56,851
King is to win. There you go.
There's a winner!

473
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:58,383
We got a winner!

474
00:34:10,432 --> 00:34:11,524
Hey you.

475
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,331
Unbelievable.

476
00:34:18,607 --> 00:34:20,370
That was embarrassing!

477
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:23,601
They offer a pool safety class onboard.
You should check it out.

478
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:25,879
Let me give you a hand.

479
00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:27,909
I'm Gabriella.

480
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:34,352
I'm Jerry.

481
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:40,421
Oh, boy.

482
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,692
- Hi.
- Hi.

483
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:49,330
You like?

484
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:52,400
Oh, yeah.

485
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:55,132
Ice cream?
Yeah, that 's okay.

486
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,073
Coach would kill me if she knew
I broke training.

487
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,639
But I no can help. I am...
What is the word?

488
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:05,582
- Oral.
- That 's the word.

489
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,580
And what a wonderful word it is.

490
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,449
I'm so lonely.

491
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:16,495
Coach's very strict about keeping us
away from men during tanning season.

492
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:18,566
It 's too bad you're gay, Nick.

493
00:35:18,767 --> 00:35:21,133
- Good night.
- Inga, wait, wait.

494
00:35:22,437 --> 00:35:24,701
I've always been curious
about your country.

495
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:26,874
- Mind if I ask you something?
- Yeah.

496
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:28,940
What would you like
to know about, Nick?

497
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:33,843
Our cities, our lakes and rivers,
our safe and sturdy automobiles?

498
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:37,746
I'm a big fan of your cinema.
I've rented quite a bit of it.

499
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:42,049
I've noticed your people's progressive
attitude towards premarital sex.

500
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:47,526
So I was wondering, theoretically,
if my own sexual orientation were...

501
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:51,130
If you're asking if I'd sleep with you if
you were straight the answer is "Ja".

502
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,801
- "Ja"? "Ja" means "Yes", right?
- Ja!

503
00:35:54,002 --> 00:35:56,197
Inga, I have a surprise for you.
I'm straight.

504
00:35:56,404 --> 00:36:00,704
I'm as straight as a Volvo going
down an Oslo toll road.

505
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:05,403
- But Oslo is in Norway.
- The point is... we can make love.

506
00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:08,575
I know that 's the best news
I've ever heard.

507
00:36:08,784 --> 00:36:11,753
I'm cabin 4433.
Meet me in five minuten.

508
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:14,547
You got it. Five minuten.

509
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:18,417
And not a minuten more.

510
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,727
Hello. Are there any condoms
available on this ship?

511
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:29,434
Come in. Door is open.

512
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:35,434
Coach.

513
00:36:36,578 --> 00:36:39,308
Changing room assignments.
You bunk with Pia.

514
00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:42,483
- But why, coach?
- You cannot be trusted with minibar.

515
00:36:42,684 --> 00:36:45,881
- You are in training.
- But coach, I eat nothing all day.

516
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:48,282
You ate yesterday, ja?

517
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,357
Your butt is disgusting.
I better double check.

518
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:55,252
Ja, disgusting.

519
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,987
Both cheeks.

520
00:36:57,532 --> 00:37:02,435
Ja, ja, ja. Move it, fattie.

521
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,128
- Knock it off and go to bed.
- Alright, coach.

522
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:09,105
Thank you for lending me
your jacket.

523
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:13,272
- So, what do you do on this ship?
- I'm a dance teacher.

524
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,382
- Wow. Teaching dance must be fun.
- It can be.

525
00:37:16,785 --> 00:37:18,548
Especially on the gay cruises.

526
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:20,778
They're much more fun
than the straight ones.

527
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:21,819
Why is that?

528
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:24,924
The guys that go on the straight
cruises... all you meet are these...

529
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:28,857
...horny creeps.
- Oh, I got a friend like that.

530
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,691
I bet men hit on you all the time.

531
00:37:34,302 --> 00:37:36,896
You've got a hot ass.

532
00:37:37,706 --> 00:37:38,695
Excuse me?

533
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:41,834
Your ass. It 's hot.

534
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:44,234
Thanks.

535
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,184
Your butt 's nothing
to sneeze at, either.

536
00:37:52,554 --> 00:37:53,953
So...

537
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,854
...you must have a boyfriend.
- No, no, no.

538
00:37:57,058 --> 00:37:58,423
- No boyfriend.
- Really?

539
00:37:58,627 --> 00:37:59,559
Why not?

540
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:04,630
Every boyfriend I've ever had has
turned out to be a son of a bitch.

541
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:07,529
- Well, not every guy is a...
- I know what you're thinking.

542
00:38:07,736 --> 00:38:08,998
I just never met "the right guy".

543
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:12,503
Trust me, honey. I've met every type
out there and it 's pretty bad.

544
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:16,470
Liars, guys with two wives,
guys with commitment issues...

545
00:38:16,678 --> 00:38:21,115
guys with parole issues.
You name it, I've dated them all.

546
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:23,580
Which is why I'm so relieved
to be on this boat.

547
00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:26,686
There's not one
straight man in sight.

548
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,753
- Excuse me?
- It 's so great...

549
00:38:28,957 --> 00:38:32,017
because I can really be myself.
I don't care about makeup...

550
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,888
I don't care about what
I'm wearing...

551
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:36,120
if a guy is talking to me because
he wants to get into my pants...

552
00:38:36,331 --> 00:38:38,595
- Gabriella...
- You know what else?

553
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,325
Let 's say I do get horny one day.

554
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:46,439
Maybe I can even find a gay guy
and he can do me the favor.

555
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:49,804
- The favor?
- How do you say in English?

556
00:38:50,045 --> 00:38:55,381
Make me scream, make me moan.
Screw my brains out.

557
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:02,117
I don't mean to be a bitch...

558
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:08,792
but these staterooms
could use a bit more color.

559
00:39:43,665 --> 00:39:45,496
Now we are laying down to sleep.

560
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:49,137
Our hot tight bodies
the Lord will keep.

561
00:39:55,277 --> 00:39:58,178
Inga darling, it 's me, Nicky.

562
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,871
I'm here.

563
00:40:08,557 --> 00:40:12,789
Reverend Lindstrom, "nej".

564
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:16,396
Just think of what
would the bishop say.

565
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:21,124
Who's knocking at my doors?

566
00:40:22,037 --> 00:40:24,631
Oh, my God!

567
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,001
Let 's go downtown, baby.

568
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,338
Help me, Jesus!

569
00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:36,847
I don't want to die!

570
00:40:57,672 --> 00:41:00,004
"Nej, nej, nej.
Ja, ja, ja, ja."

571
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,108
Get off me!

572
00:41:10,085 --> 00:41:11,643
What 's that?

573
00:41:11,853 --> 00:41:13,878
It 's coming from the coach's room.

574
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:19,652
Smoking sturgeons!
Coach's pussy just blew up.

575
00:41:20,595 --> 00:41:23,189
It was good for me, ja.

576
00:41:40,615 --> 00:41:42,344
Oh, Jesus.

577
00:42:11,346 --> 00:42:14,315
<i>I gotta tell you</i>,<i>Nick</i>.
<i>She's so great</i>.

578
00:42:14,516 --> 00:42:18,316
We had so much fun.
We talked, we laughed.

579
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,148
Can you hand me one of those
cheese-flavored penises?

580
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:26,219
Gabriella is everything I've ever
wanted in a woman. I even pierced...

581
00:42:26,428 --> 00:42:27,952
...my ear for her.
- You better make sure...

582
00:42:28,163 --> 00:42:30,893
...it 's the right ear.
- Of course it 's...

583
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,901
- Yeah, I better look into that.
- How was your evening?

584
00:42:39,107 --> 00:42:42,304
Let 's just say I had some bad
shellfish and leave it at that.

585
00:42:42,511 --> 00:42:44,911
- Hey. Hold on a second. See ya.
- Here she comes.

586
00:42:45,247 --> 00:42:46,976
- Grab my ass.
- What are you? Crazy?

587
00:42:47,182 --> 00:42:50,015
I told her I was gay. Now wet
your lips and look at me lovingly.

588
00:42:50,218 --> 00:42:51,810
- Do I look like a homo to you?
- Yes.

589
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,544
An out of shape one,
but we have those too.

590
00:42:53,755 --> 00:42:56,918
Thank you very much. That 's enough.
Moving along. Nothing to see here.

591
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:59,389
What do you want me to do?
Act like I'm gay?

592
00:42:59,594 --> 00:43:00,583
- Hi, boys.
- Hi.

593
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:02,592
I don't believe you two have
formally been introduced.

594
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:05,527
- This is my life partner.
- I'm not his life...

595
00:43:05,734 --> 00:43:07,463
He's a little seasick this morning.

596
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,160
- Maybe he's just a little lovesick.
- Right!

597
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:15,942
- We're into S&M.
- Okay.

598
00:43:16,144 --> 00:43:20,137
If you feel better later you would
like to come to my new class?

599
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:24,476
- Yeah? It 's dirty dancing.
- Dirty dancing?

600
00:43:24,886 --> 00:43:27,411
- So taboo.
- What the hell's wrong with you?

601
00:43:27,622 --> 00:43:29,453
"He's my life partner".

602
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:33,518
You need to keep an open mind.
Nick! Hey!

603
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:38,355
- It 's only for a few days.
- Quit bugging me.

604
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:40,228
I'm getting my nuts handed to me
on a platter.

605
00:43:40,435 --> 00:43:42,960
- I wouldn't mind seeing that.
- Don't say it!

606
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:48,707
- Why not?
- Cause I won't, that 's why.

607
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:50,375
Be a friend.

608
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:52,843
As a friend?
You're a wiener.

609
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:55,778
Now buzz off. I'm trying
to concentrate on my workout.

610
00:43:57,252 --> 00:43:59,186
You're not working out.

611
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,077
Nick, if you do me this one favor,
I promise you I...

612
00:44:30,352 --> 00:44:31,341
Nick!

613
00:44:31,853 --> 00:44:34,754
Come on, listen.
I'm begging you.

614
00:44:40,462 --> 00:44:43,431
- Maybe I'll skip the steam.
- That 's a good idea.

615
00:44:45,967 --> 00:44:47,525
Listen...

616
00:44:48,236 --> 00:44:52,730
After what happened with Felicia, I
thought I'd never feel this way again.

617
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:55,239
Why are you making such
a big deal about this girl?

618
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:58,378
- She's a classic man-hater.
- No, no, no.

619
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,947
Gabriella doesn't mean it. She's just
had bad luck with guys she dates...

620
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:05,483
because they only want to have sex
with her. You know the type.

621
00:45:06,521 --> 00:45:08,751
Don't ever take sides
against the guys.

622
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:13,518
Nick, I just need a few days
to get to know her.

623
00:45:13,728 --> 00:45:15,423
Then I'll tell her the truth.

624
00:45:20,702 --> 00:45:22,863
Why are you hiding
from that woman?

625
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,133
Hiding? I'm not hiding.
I have a cramp.

626
00:45:26,374 --> 00:45:29,172
Nick, I'm desperate.

627
00:45:29,377 --> 00:45:33,438
- What if I offered to pay you?
- Pay me! How dare you!

628
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:36,340
You think I'd sacrifice my dignity,
my self-esteem...

629
00:45:36,551 --> 00:45:40,681
my whole way of life for a few,
measly dollars? No!

630
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:44,090
- Five hundred, cash?
- I'll do it!

631
00:45:46,428 --> 00:45:48,487
- Come closer, you're too far away.
- No!

632
00:45:48,697 --> 00:45:50,096
Hey, hey. Hold on.

633
00:45:50,298 --> 00:45:53,392
Beautiful. Very nice, everyone.
I love it.

634
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,168
Jerry, you're light on your feet.

635
00:45:57,372 --> 00:45:59,533
This whole place
is light on its feet.

636
00:46:02,544 --> 00:46:05,342
Nick, your body's too stiff.
Wait. Listen to me.

637
00:46:05,547 --> 00:46:08,573
Your body's too stiff.
I want you to loosen up. Come on.

638
00:46:08,817 --> 00:46:11,479
There you go. Move it and then
go on, dance by yourself.

639
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:14,348
Feel the music, Nick.
Feel it.

640
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,526
Feel it.

641
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,718
Okay, everyone.
Change partners.

642
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,865
Cha, cha, cha, cha, cha.
We meet again, "chêrie".

643
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:01,035
I hope that 's your belt buckle
I feel back there.

644
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:05,262
You know, from the moment
we met, I felt there was...

645
00:47:05,473 --> 00:47:09,705
...an electrical charge between us.
- I think your pacemaker shortened out.

646
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:13,710
How did you know
I like to be humiliated?

647
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:16,715
Look, Lloyd, you're barking up
the wrong tree here.

648
00:47:17,285 --> 00:47:19,048
I know.

649
00:47:19,954 --> 00:47:23,412
- You want to lead.
- Lloyd, I'm not...

650
00:47:24,793 --> 00:47:26,420
interested.

651
00:47:26,628 --> 00:47:29,620
That 's alright. I'm a patient man.
I can wait.

652
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,697
I'm also very rich.

653
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:36,733
You know,
I'd like to spoil you, Nick.

654
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,103
Take you to places
you've never been.

655
00:47:40,308 --> 00:47:42,606
Show you things you've never seen.

656
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:45,003
I'd like to...

657
00:47:46,848 --> 00:47:48,645
Jerry!

658
00:47:49,384 --> 00:47:51,147
Cha-cha-cha.

659
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:54,550
That 's it.

660
00:47:54,756 --> 00:47:56,917
You know, you're
a really good dance teacher.

661
00:47:57,192 --> 00:47:59,888
Really? It 's fun to
teach a class like this.

662
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:02,722
I always felt too self-conscious
to really...

663
00:48:04,032 --> 00:48:06,762
...cut loose, you know?
- We have a revue here on board.

664
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:08,595
It 's like an amateur night thing.

665
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,294
- You think you'd be interested?
- Too public.

666
00:48:11,539 --> 00:48:14,406
- I'm more of a closet dancer.
- That 's a shame.

667
00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:17,908
- Because I'm the choreographer.
- Really?

668
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,777
Well, for you,
I might just waltz out of the closet.

669
00:48:24,285 --> 00:48:27,982
- You know... it 's strange.
- What 's that?

670
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,515
The way you stare at me sometimes.

671
00:48:31,726 --> 00:48:33,785
The way you touch me like that,
you know?

672
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:36,759
It 's exactly the way
a straight guy would.

673
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:40,225
Me? Straight? Girlfriend, please!

674
00:48:42,103 --> 00:48:43,832
Nobody's gotta teach me
how to be gay.

675
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:49,439
Bette Midler is also known
as the Divine Miss...

676
00:48:51,279 --> 00:48:53,975
- M?
- Very good!

677
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:56,082
Very good.
Oh, sorry!

678
00:48:56,284 --> 00:48:59,742
Okay, now describe the Brandy
Alexander you're drinking.

679
00:49:01,322 --> 00:49:04,758
- Refreshing.
- No, no, no! It is to die for!

680
00:49:05,093 --> 00:49:09,894
Also acceptable divine,
marvellous, charming and ooh-la-la.

681
00:49:13,134 --> 00:49:17,230
<i>At first lwas afraid</i>
<i>lwas petrified</i>

682
00:49:17,438 --> 00:49:21,966
<i>Kept thinking I could never live</i>
<i>Without you by my side</i>

683
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:24,838
<i>But then I spent so many nights</i>

684
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:27,310
<i>Thinking how you did me wrong</i>

685
00:49:27,515 --> 00:49:29,210
<i>And I grew strong</i>

686
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:31,577
<i>And I learned how to get along</i>

687
00:49:31,786 --> 00:49:33,413
<i>And now you're back</i>

688
00:49:33,621 --> 00:49:35,555
<i>From outer space</i>

689
00:49:35,757 --> 00:49:39,022
<i>I just walked in to see you there</i>
<i>With that sad look upon your</i>

690
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:41,320
Why you stopped singing?

691
00:49:41,529 --> 00:49:44,987
I don't know the words.

692
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,659
You want to convince people you're
gay and you don't know the words?

693
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:52,832
Singing disco tunes
and wearing calypso outfits...

694
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:55,134
is not going to help me
convince Gabriella that I'm gay.

695
00:49:55,343 --> 00:49:56,833
Hector, this is stupid.

696
00:50:01,683 --> 00:50:03,844
Are you humming "I Will Survive?"

697
00:50:04,052 --> 00:50:06,077
That 's right.
And I know all the words.

698
00:50:08,523 --> 00:50:11,151
- You're looking at me like I'm crazy.
- I'm not.

699
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:12,415
- You know what?
- What?

700
00:50:12,627 --> 00:50:15,687
Champagne usually
makes me a crazy, too.

701
00:50:15,897 --> 00:50:18,365
Champagne, ocean air...

702
00:50:18,967 --> 00:50:20,958
strange things might happen.

703
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,431
I might turn into
a raging heterosexual.

704
00:50:27,408 --> 00:50:31,242
I should be so lucky.
Can you imagine?

705
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:34,304
You know what? Let 's get
this party on its feet. Come on.

706
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,476
Inga, it 's me, Nicky.

707
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,615
Open up.

708
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:11,842
Nicky.

709
00:51:12,053 --> 00:51:14,681
- So Mr. Tongue has a name.
- I'm sorry about what happened.

710
00:51:14,889 --> 00:51:17,153
You don't have to hit me.
The deed was punishment enough.

711
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:19,187
"Nej, nej, nej."

712
00:51:19,394 --> 00:51:21,988
If we ever hook up again,
I want to show you.

713
00:51:22,196 --> 00:51:24,790
- I can reciprocate.
- Reciprocate?

714
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:12,342
Hey, Nick!

715
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:15,072
Hey, fresh meat.
Have a seat, Nick.

716
00:52:15,283 --> 00:52:17,251
I can always use
a little extra spending money.

717
00:52:17,452 --> 00:52:19,443
What the hell, I can use
a quiet game of poker.

718
00:52:19,654 --> 00:52:24,284
Sorry I'm late, boys. I had trouble
squeezing into this pantyhose.

719
00:52:24,492 --> 00:52:26,983
- So, what 's the game?
- Five card stud.

720
00:52:27,328 --> 00:52:30,661
- Very appropriate.
- Let 's play some cards.

721
00:52:32,266 --> 00:52:36,794
- I'm tired. Are you tired?
- Yeah! Wait. One more.

722
00:53:54,115 --> 00:53:56,140
Hector!

723
00:53:57,218 --> 00:53:58,708
You've been on a boat before.

724
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,787
- Is it safe?
- Of course it 's safe!

725
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:04,856
As long as you are responsible.

726
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:07,493
You mean the storm?
Well, that I do not know.

727
00:54:11,032 --> 00:54:12,863
Hector, let me ask you something.

728
00:54:13,067 --> 00:54:16,594
- How many cruises have you been on?
- Including this one?

729
00:54:16,804 --> 00:54:18,567
That would make it...

730
00:54:19,373 --> 00:54:23,503
one. You see, I only recently
came all the way out of the closet.

731
00:54:24,712 --> 00:54:27,510
Recently, really?
I would've figured kindergarten.

732
00:54:27,715 --> 00:54:29,842
No. Well, let me tell you.
It wasn't easy.

733
00:54:30,218 --> 00:54:32,448
But it 's better to be true
to yourself...

734
00:54:32,653 --> 00:54:34,678
than to lie to the world.

735
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:37,814
It must 've taken a lot of guts.

736
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:39,251
It 's funny, you know?

737
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,088
These guys I'm playing poker with.
Steven, Tom, Ron.

738
00:54:42,496 --> 00:54:43,861
Steven's a doctor.

739
00:54:44,065 --> 00:54:45,532
A gay heart surgeon.
Who would've thought?

740
00:54:46,067 --> 00:54:49,230
Ron's a criminal defence attorney.
He represents some bad-assed dudes.

741
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,797
Tom's cross-dresser
and pastry chef.

742
00:54:52,406 --> 00:54:54,601
Okay, I would have guessed that.

743
00:54:54,809 --> 00:54:57,243
But still,
they're a great bunch of guys.

744
00:54:57,912 --> 00:54:59,709
- So what are you saying?
- What am I saying?

745
00:54:59,914 --> 00:55:04,817
What I'm saying is I kinda wanted
to hang out more with these guys.

746
00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:10,423
But there was a part of me that
felt it was somehow wrong...

747
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:12,092
to be friends with gay men.

748
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:17,258
And that...
makes me feel like a jerk.

749
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:23,002
Sit.

750
00:55:23,437 --> 00:55:25,098
Come on, sit.

751
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:33,542
You know, my Papa, he used to
think that to be gay was "muy malo".

752
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:35,439
A big shame.

753
00:55:37,218 --> 00:55:39,948
He no talk to me for 2O years.
His own blood.

754
00:55:40,788 --> 00:55:44,815
Now he's sick, he's dying.
He asks for me. He say to me...

755
00:55:45,026 --> 00:55:48,792
"Hector, I waste so much time.

756
00:55:49,997 --> 00:55:55,435
We're all God's children.
I'm so sorry." He said so.

757
00:56:03,678 --> 00:56:07,478
You see, my Papi, he's like you.
A real jerk.

758
00:56:07,915 --> 00:56:10,383
He just needed to learn.

759
00:56:11,686 --> 00:56:13,916
You learn too, my friend.

760
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:24,761
I'm hurting.

761
00:56:24,966 --> 00:56:27,560
It feels so good
to get off my feet!

762
00:56:28,502 --> 00:56:30,936
I couldn't agree with you more.

763
00:56:34,075 --> 00:56:35,736
You know what?

764
00:56:36,277 --> 00:56:39,110
I've got to get out
of these clothes.

765
00:56:39,747 --> 00:56:41,772
I couldn't agree with you more.

766
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:47,282
Listen, would you mind doing me
a huge, huge favor?

767
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:49,589
Would you spend the night with me?

768
00:56:50,091 --> 00:56:51,115
What?

769
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:53,358
Yeah, you know, it 's the storm.

770
00:56:53,561 --> 00:56:56,359
I wouldn't mind cuddling
under the covers with somebody.

771
00:56:57,565 --> 00:56:59,430
You think Nick would mind?

772
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:04,828
Fuck Nick.

773
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:10,336
Is this storm getting worse,
or am I too drunk or...

774
00:57:12,013 --> 00:57:13,947
I have a theory.

775
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:16,707
I think if we drank more...

776
00:57:16,917 --> 00:57:19,477
we might be able to maintain
perfect equilibrium.

777
00:57:19,687 --> 00:57:24,852
I'll try that in the pursuit
of science.

778
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:26,720
I'll get us another round.

779
00:57:26,927 --> 00:57:28,758
I have a better idea.

780
00:57:29,397 --> 00:57:33,663
I have a fifty-year old bottle
of cognac in my room...

781
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:37,993
...and I'm gonna go get it.
- I'll go with you.

782
00:57:38,472 --> 00:57:41,032
I could use the exercise.

783
00:57:43,844 --> 00:57:46,142
Jerry, we can get out
from under the covers.

784
00:57:46,347 --> 00:57:49,441
I think the storm was over,
like, half an hour ago.

785
00:57:50,618 --> 00:57:53,314
It was one hell of a storm, though.

786
00:57:54,522 --> 00:57:57,150
You know, I have something
you're gonna love.

787
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:02,761
- Get ready to have an orgasm.
- What?

788
00:58:02,963 --> 00:58:04,658
Open wide.

789
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:09,759
- Good?
- Yeah.

790
00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:17,165
- Do me.
- You're so lucky I'm gay.

791
00:58:27,855 --> 00:58:30,881
- Can I ask you something?
- Shoot.

792
00:58:31,525 --> 00:58:33,993
- How do you do it?
- Do what?

793
00:58:35,062 --> 00:58:37,690
- Give head.
- What?

794
00:58:37,998 --> 00:58:42,731
A blow job. I mean, do you start
on the tip of his penis?

795
00:58:43,137 --> 00:58:45,537
Or you stroke it
while you use your mouth?

796
00:58:45,739 --> 00:58:48,435
- Do you tickle the balls?
- Not everybody likes that.

797
00:58:49,577 --> 00:58:51,807
As a person who gives them
and receives them...

798
00:58:52,012 --> 00:58:54,446
you must know the perfect way.
Show me.

799
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:57,049
What?

800
00:58:58,986 --> 00:59:00,715
Okay.

801
00:59:11,732 --> 00:59:13,563
You...

802
00:59:13,834 --> 00:59:15,893
It 's a little small.

803
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,260
You know, I got an idea.

804
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:22,499
Why don't you show me your
technique, and then I'll critique it.

805
00:59:24,345 --> 00:59:26,370
- Okay.
- Okay.

806
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:28,744
- Okay.
- Okay.

807
00:59:30,384 --> 00:59:32,375
So look. First...

808
00:59:32,586 --> 00:59:37,319
I slowly lick the tip
with my tongue, right?

809
00:59:45,699 --> 00:59:47,724
- Right?
- That 's good.

810
00:59:47,935 --> 00:59:51,098
Then I gently go down
the shaft with my lips.

811
00:59:53,772 --> 00:59:56,536
And in time, I tickle the balls

812
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,100
Very softly

813
00:59:58,742 --> 01:00:02,838
Then I twirl my tongue
all the way...

814
01:00:05,649 --> 01:00:07,810
back to the top.

815
01:00:08,218 --> 01:00:10,914
Then I wet my lips.

816
01:00:13,089 --> 01:00:15,319
I do a little playful nibbling.

817
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,514
And then I slip into my mouth

818
01:00:23,461 --> 01:00:26,191
"Eso me encanta
porque es maravilloso."

819
01:00:27,065 --> 01:00:30,296
"Eu te amo, te amo."

820
01:00:32,437 --> 01:00:34,769
How's that?
Jerry?

821
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,906
That 's fine!

822
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:44,641
For goodness' sake, Lloyd.
At least kiss me first.

823
01:00:46,151 --> 01:00:49,211
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

824
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,522
Now, where did I put that bag?

825
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,918
I'm just going to lay down.

826
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,658
Got it.

827
01:01:06,504 --> 01:01:08,938
Now, before we go
back up with the boys...

828
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,802
what do you say
we do a couple of shots?

829
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,411
You're a goddamned genius.

830
01:01:16,615 --> 01:01:18,173
Here you go.

831
01:02:12,804 --> 01:02:14,999
Oh...

832
01:02:15,206 --> 01:02:17,003
my...

833
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:18,197
God!

834
01:02:28,153 --> 01:02:30,053
What are you doing?

835
01:02:30,355 --> 01:02:33,620
I have a horrible taste in my mouth,
Jerry, and I can't get rid of it.

836
01:02:33,825 --> 01:02:35,349
Did you eat something weird?

837
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,959
Yeah.

838
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:40,356
- I did a bad, bad thing, Jerry.
- What?

839
01:02:40,899 --> 01:02:43,424
You know how the sea air makes
you disoriented and there was...

840
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:48,004
the drinking and the partying
and I slept with a man, Jerry.

841
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,233
Very funny.

842
01:02:52,277 --> 01:02:53,676
No, it 's not.

843
01:02:53,878 --> 01:02:55,971
I just woke up in Ron's stateroom.

844
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,077
- With Ron.
- What?

845
01:03:00,452 --> 01:03:02,545
I've chased a lot of women, Jerry.

846
01:03:02,754 --> 01:03:04,278
To be honest...

847
01:03:04,956 --> 01:03:08,392
I never actually scored with one
since I was a senior in high school...

848
01:03:08,593 --> 01:03:10,618
and then I had to promise
to marry her.

849
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:13,657
A fifty-one year old
coffee shop waitress.

850
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,562
And a stroke victim...

851
01:03:16,901 --> 01:03:18,596
with a fake leg...

852
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,899
and a lazy eye...

853
01:03:21,206 --> 01:03:23,140
...and a mole with...
- I got it.

854
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,070
What I'm trying to say is...

855
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:29,273
maybe I'm meant to do more than
just play cards with these guys.

856
01:03:30,081 --> 01:03:34,415
I'm finally happy.
So happy.

857
01:03:35,453 --> 01:03:36,613
I'm gay.

858
01:03:36,821 --> 01:03:40,655
One, two, three, four...

859
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:44,886
five, six, seven, eight.

860
01:03:45,096 --> 01:03:48,691
And one, two, three, four...

861
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:52,199
five, six, seven, eight.
Good.

862
01:03:52,604 --> 01:03:53,969
Good work, guys. Good work.

863
01:03:54,172 --> 01:03:56,299
Hector, try not shaking
your ass so much.

864
01:03:56,508 --> 01:03:58,635
You mean in the dance,
or in real life?

865
01:03:59,911 --> 01:04:04,348
OK, guys. Thank you for coming. I'll
see you back here tonight at eleven.

866
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:07,245
Jerry, you are looking
fierce up there.

867
01:04:09,954 --> 01:04:12,320
I can't remember when
I've had this much fun.

868
01:04:13,124 --> 01:04:14,819
You know, you're just great.

869
01:04:15,093 --> 01:04:16,355
Hey!

870
01:04:17,362 --> 01:04:19,421
- Are you gonna go to the island?
- I am.

871
01:04:19,631 --> 01:04:21,030
Do you want me to be
your tour guide?

872
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:22,790
I know the island very well.

873
01:04:23,001 --> 01:04:26,095
- That would be yummy.
- Yummy.

874
01:04:26,304 --> 01:04:27,635
Let 's go.

875
01:04:38,516 --> 01:04:41,974
Nicholas... I was beginning
to wonder about you.

876
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:46,747
I'm glad to see you finally got that
luscious full figure frame of yours...

877
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:49,984
...in the right dinghy.
- It 's amazing.

878
01:04:50,195 --> 01:04:54,291
A day ago I would've punched you in
the face for saying a thing like that.

879
01:04:54,566 --> 01:04:56,158
- This place is paradise.
- Oh, yeah.

880
01:04:56,367 --> 01:04:58,130
- We're gonna have an awesome time.
- I'll say.

881
01:04:58,336 --> 01:05:01,328
I can already feel the men around here
undressing me with their eyes.

882
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,970
- Hungry? Want something to eat?
- Nope. I have a better idea.

883
01:05:05,176 --> 01:05:07,371
- Let 's go exploring first.
- Great.

884
01:05:08,546 --> 01:05:11,447
Daddy, thanks so much for finding
out where Jerry is for me.

885
01:05:11,649 --> 01:05:13,708
Yeah, I'm sure things are gonna
work out, too.

886
01:05:13,918 --> 01:05:15,613
Bye-bye. Love you, Daddy.

887
01:05:16,221 --> 01:05:17,779
How do I get
to the Olympic Voyager?

888
01:05:17,989 --> 01:05:18,978
Right this way, madam.

889
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:21,988
Be careful with those bags. They're
worth more than you make in a year.

890
01:05:22,927 --> 01:05:26,226
Bon voyage... bitch.

891
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,057
- Hi Nick. How you doing?
- Hey, fine.

892
01:05:31,269 --> 01:05:33,294
I'm not sore, or anything.

893
01:05:33,505 --> 01:05:35,234
Hey buddy, about last night...

894
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:39,271
I understand why it happened.
I mean, I'm pretty charismatic.

895
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:43,470
If the moon hits me in just the right
way, I can look pretty damn tasty.

896
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:48,642
You're okay too, but I just really
rather we stay friends.

897
01:05:49,053 --> 01:05:51,112
Alright. Me too, Nick.

898
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:52,311
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

899
01:05:52,524 --> 01:05:53,821
- Wow.
- Yeah.

900
01:05:54,025 --> 01:05:56,186
If I had said that to a chick,
she'd be a total mess right now.

901
01:05:56,794 --> 01:05:58,125
I'm starting to see the upside
to this whole thing.

902
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:01,264
<i>You do what Sonya says</i>, <i>team</i>
<i>You do what Sonya says</i>

903
01:06:01,466 --> 01:06:02,455
One, two, three, four.

904
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:05,966
<i>Woke upwith no tanning cream</i>
<i>Now you're off the tanning team</i>

905
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:10,504
- One, two, three, four.
- Coach, it 's the Hawaiian Tropic team.

906
01:06:27,926 --> 01:06:29,723
Hey, break it up, ladies! Come on!

907
01:06:29,928 --> 01:06:32,522
Come on! Take it easy!

908
01:06:32,931 --> 01:06:35,297
Break it up! Break it up!

909
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,330
Save it for the tanning competition!

910
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:41,301
Bad! You are bad.
Now everybody move out! Now!

911
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,944
Okay, girls.
Get your heinies on the donkeys.

912
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:52,842
Now.

913
01:06:53,985 --> 01:06:55,680
Nick.

914
01:06:56,988 --> 01:07:00,355
I just wanted to say goodbye.
I'm going to the airport now.

915
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:03,857
Inga, it was great almost
knowing you.

916
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:06,963
Nick, if you're ever near
Gettzemüllersteigen, Sweden...

917
01:07:07,165 --> 01:07:11,226
...I would love to see you again.
- I don't think so, baby.

918
01:07:11,436 --> 01:07:13,063
I don't think this is gonna work out.

919
01:07:13,671 --> 01:07:16,367
But, I thought you liked me, Nick.

920
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:21,576
- I'm confused.
- So am I. You don't even know.

921
01:07:21,946 --> 01:07:24,574
You better hurry.
You have an ass to catch.

922
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,382
And you...

923
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:30,884
Hey.

924
01:07:33,691 --> 01:07:35,852
And go.

925
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,257
Oh, it feels good.

926
01:07:42,066 --> 01:07:45,126
Hey, Nick. About last night...

927
01:07:45,336 --> 01:07:47,531
you don't think
anything happened, do you?

928
01:07:48,206 --> 01:07:51,437
- What do you think happened?
- Nothing.

929
01:07:51,643 --> 01:07:54,077
You and I drank too much
and then fell asleep.

930
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:56,439
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

931
01:07:57,248 --> 01:07:59,739
Inga!

932
01:08:02,153 --> 01:08:04,144
Inga!

933
01:08:04,522 --> 01:08:06,615
Well, I think we lost
that one forever.

934
01:08:06,824 --> 01:08:08,655
A lot of potential in that boy.

935
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:10,987
He could've been
one of the great ones.

936
01:08:11,663 --> 01:08:14,655
I saw in him
what I saw in Elton John.

937
01:10:01,041 --> 01:10:03,168
Had your Vitamin C today?

938
01:10:04,878 --> 01:10:08,336
You know, you really make me laugh.

939
01:10:13,153 --> 01:10:15,018
I'm so glad we met.

940
01:10:18,224 --> 01:10:19,714
You know...

941
01:10:19,926 --> 01:10:24,454
it really is a shame
to let this place go to waste.

942
01:10:25,732 --> 01:10:27,165
Just a friendly kiss?

943
01:10:32,105 --> 01:10:34,369
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

944
01:10:34,841 --> 01:10:36,672
I don't want to feel like I am...

945
01:10:36,876 --> 01:10:39,276
pressuring you into doing something
you don't want to do.

946
01:10:39,746 --> 01:10:41,941
I want to do this very badly.

947
01:10:42,148 --> 01:10:43,843
- Really?
- Yes.

948
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:46,582
So, let me be your guide.

949
01:10:47,487 --> 01:10:50,854
And I promise I'm gonna be gentle.

950
01:10:51,057 --> 01:10:52,615
I'm gonna be patient.

951
01:10:52,826 --> 01:10:56,853
And I'm going to take it
very, very slowly.

952
01:10:57,063 --> 01:10:58,792
Great.

953
01:11:26,326 --> 01:11:28,317
Jerry... Jerry...

954
01:11:28,762 --> 01:11:31,629
You're a really quick stud.

955
01:11:33,032 --> 01:11:35,057
That 's enough foreplay.

956
01:11:37,103 --> 01:11:40,732
Excuse me. Could you ring
Jerry Robinson's room, please?

957
01:11:41,107 --> 01:11:42,870
Certainly.

958
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:52,880
No one seems
to be answering, ma'am.

959
01:11:53,086 --> 01:11:54,678
Could you give me his room number?

960
01:11:55,054 --> 01:11:57,454
I'm sorry, we're not allowed
to divulge that information.

961
01:11:57,657 --> 01:11:59,284
Would you like to leave a message?

962
01:11:59,526 --> 01:12:02,859
No, thanks.
I want to surprise him.

963
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:05,857
Thank you.

964
01:12:16,442 --> 01:12:18,501
You wanna have dinner
with me tonight?

965
01:12:20,246 --> 01:12:23,147
- No.
- Why not?

966
01:12:25,051 --> 01:12:28,646
Because I'm falling in love
with you.

967
01:12:29,756 --> 01:12:31,747
You are?

968
01:12:31,991 --> 01:12:33,618
Yes, I am.

969
01:12:33,827 --> 01:12:38,321
Of all the dumb, boneheaded, romantic
moves I've made over the years...

970
01:12:38,531 --> 01:12:41,830
...this will be the dumbest.
- Now wait a minute.

971
01:12:42,035 --> 01:12:45,300
- This could work.
- How do you think it 's gonna work?

972
01:12:45,538 --> 01:12:47,733
I cannot make you into something
you're not, Jerry.

973
01:12:47,941 --> 01:12:52,605
I do that with every man
I fall for and it has to stop.

974
01:12:54,781 --> 01:12:58,581
- Besides, you already have someone.
- No, I don't.

975
01:12:58,885 --> 01:13:00,648
What about Nick?

976
01:13:04,824 --> 01:13:07,088
That 's just physical.

977
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:11,695
Listen, I have to accept
who you really are.

978
01:13:11,898 --> 01:13:13,695
I really want to be alone right now.

979
01:13:49,636 --> 01:13:52,127
- Hi.
- Hi.

980
01:13:52,872 --> 01:13:55,306
It 's kind of nice
seeing another woman aboard.

981
01:13:55,508 --> 01:13:56,907
Tell me about it.

982
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:59,840
All I've seen are men.
Most of them gay.

983
01:14:00,046 --> 01:14:01,809
Well, it is a gay cruise.

984
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:07,283
- What did you just say?
- You didn't know?

985
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:11,014
No! I came on board to get back
together with my boyfriend.

986
01:14:11,224 --> 01:14:14,853
I don't get it! Why in the world
would he be on a gay...

987
01:14:19,732 --> 01:14:21,563
Good luck.

988
01:14:22,135 --> 01:14:23,602
Thanks.

989
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:25,301
We're just gonna put them
on the stage.

990
01:14:25,505 --> 01:14:27,029
Hector!

991
01:14:29,676 --> 01:14:31,576
- Have you seen Gabriella?
- No, I've been looking for her myself.

992
01:14:31,778 --> 01:14:34,941
Everything is falling apart.
The music is not ready.

993
01:14:35,148 --> 01:14:38,140
Victor, the lead dancer, is seasick.

994
01:14:39,018 --> 01:14:43,318
And look at my costume!
It hangs. It 's supposed to drape!

995
01:14:43,923 --> 01:14:46,892
OK, if you see Gabriella, could you
give her this message for me, please?

996
01:14:50,196 --> 01:14:51,788
How could I've been so blind?

997
01:14:51,998 --> 01:14:54,262
I mean, the signs were right
in front of my eyes.

998
01:14:55,501 --> 01:15:00,962
Foreign films... grab a convertible.
Gourmet mustards.

999
01:15:03,142 --> 01:15:07,875
Wait... maybe he's only curious.

1000
01:15:08,081 --> 01:15:10,641
I mean, there was that
one time when I was in college...

1001
01:15:11,351 --> 01:15:14,377
my roommate Bianca and I,
we shared a Jacuzzi.

1002
01:15:16,823 --> 01:15:19,291
That got kinda hot.

1003
01:15:22,962 --> 01:15:26,398
- I got to go, pal. Keep the change.
- Thanks.

1004
01:15:29,068 --> 01:15:35,997
<i>Think twice before you</i>
<i>blow the man down!</i>

1005
01:15:37,877 --> 01:15:41,176
Get everybody ready for the next
number. They have less than a minute.

1006
01:15:43,683 --> 01:15:45,082
What?

1007
01:15:45,785 --> 01:15:49,619
Nobody told me Victor was too sick
to dance. Who's gonna be the lead?

1008
01:15:50,023 --> 01:15:54,824
<i>I' m coming</i>

01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:57,816
- Cocksucker!
- Felicia!

1045
01:18:00,786 --> 01:18:02,981
I was talking to him.

1046
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:08,054
Felicia!

1047
01:18:09,862 --> 01:18:13,127
- Felicia! What are you doing here?
- Don't even talk to me.

1048
01:18:13,332 --> 01:18:16,358
- I feel so humiliated.
- Well, how did you find me?

1049
01:18:16,569 --> 01:18:18,196
What were you thinking about
when we were making love, Jerry?

1050
01:18:18,404 --> 01:18:21,032
- Cabana Boys?
- Hey, I am not gay.

1051
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:23,834
And to think
I wanted to be your wife!

1052
01:18:24,544 --> 01:18:26,011
What?

1053
01:18:26,679 --> 01:18:28,670
I really missed you, Jerry.

1054
01:18:28,981 --> 01:18:31,245
All the special times we had.
We complemented each other.

1055
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:33,350
We could've built a life together.

1056
01:18:34,187 --> 01:18:36,052
- Build a life together?
- Yes!

1057
01:18:36,255 --> 01:18:39,691
- What about Andrê, the buffer boy?
- It was just a fling.

1058
01:18:39,892 --> 01:18:43,293
A horrible, thoughtless,
insensitive mistake.

1059
01:18:43,563 --> 01:18:45,861
But it showed me
what I really wanted, Jerry.

1060
01:18:46,065 --> 01:18:48,829
A stable, decent man who would
always be there for me.

1061
01:18:50,169 --> 01:18:51,761
And I thought that that was you.

1062
01:18:52,538 --> 01:18:54,472
What are you saying?
You want to get back together?

1063
01:18:54,774 --> 01:18:56,332
Well, I did.

1064
01:18:56,576 --> 01:18:58,271
Before I found out
that you were gay.

1065
01:19:00,046 --> 01:19:02,207
How could you think I'm gay?

1066
01:19:02,481 --> 01:19:05,245
You're standing there preening
like a gay peacock...

1067
01:19:05,451 --> 01:19:07,442
and you don't want me to think
you're tutti-frutti?

1068
01:19:07,653 --> 01:19:12,556
For heaven's sake, Felicia. I'm not
gay and I never have been gay.

1069
01:19:12,758 --> 01:19:15,124
Then why the hell
are you on this boat?

1070
01:19:15,328 --> 01:19:19,094
Nick! Nick and I got on
this cruise by mistake.

1071
01:19:19,298 --> 01:19:22,699
And then I met this girl
and she assumed I was gay!

1072
01:19:22,902 --> 01:19:25,496
And then I stupidly went along
with it because...

1073
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,639
She's behind me, isn't she?

1074
01:19:35,147 --> 01:19:36,637
How could you?

1075
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:39,681
Gabriella, I'm sorry.

1076
01:19:40,586 --> 01:19:43,817
- I tried to tell you.
- You're an asshole, Jerry.

1077
01:19:48,995 --> 01:19:50,223
Not again!

1078
01:19:55,001 --> 01:19:58,061
That was the girl
I was talking about.

1079
01:19:58,704 --> 01:20:01,969
Well, looks like you
had a dumb fling yourself.

1080
01:20:02,241 --> 01:20:05,142
I'll tell you what.
If you can forgive me...

1081
01:20:05,344 --> 01:20:07,369
I can certainly forgive you.

1082
01:20:07,647 --> 01:20:11,447
And we can get married
just like you always wanted, Jerry.

1083
01:20:11,851 --> 01:20:15,617
I love you, baby.
What do you say?

1084
01:20:17,957 --> 01:20:18,548
Great.

1085
01:20:18,758 --> 01:20:22,250
Now one of the bride and groom
staring at each other lovingly.

1086
01:20:23,329 --> 01:20:26,594
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.

1087
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:31,397
Why don't we both look beautiful?
Take out that earring.

1088
01:21:14,938 --> 01:21:16,906
Felicia is good for me.

1089
01:21:21,478 --> 01:21:25,209
She planned this entire wedding,
all by herself.

1090
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:29,044
Got me a great job
with her father.

1091
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:33,080
Got us a new apartment. Picked out
all the linens and plates.

1092
01:21:33,657 --> 01:21:37,252
And as a wedding gift, she gave me
an entire new wardrobe.

1093
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:43,127
Yep, the only decision I have left
to make for the rest of my life...

1094
01:21:43,334 --> 01:21:45,928
is whether I want to be
buried or cremated.

1095
01:21:46,136 --> 01:21:48,036
No. I take that back.

1096
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:51,101
We're being buried side by side.
She told me this morning.

1097
01:22:10,127 --> 01:22:12,095
Hey, Jerry, I'm sorry I'm late.

1098
01:22:12,296 --> 01:22:14,491
I had a little bit of a
personal crisis this morning.

1099
01:22:14,698 --> 01:22:16,393
- Is everything alright, pastor?
- Fine, fine.

1100
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,899
Just I had a few personal issues
I had to clarify, but...

1101
01:22:20,104 --> 01:22:22,004
It 's your big day.
Nothing's going to spoil it.

1102
01:22:22,206 --> 01:22:24,071
Glad to see
you finally made it, reverend.

1103
01:22:24,341 --> 01:22:27,367
I got a string quartet back at the
Hyatt about to go into golden time.

1104
01:22:27,644 --> 01:22:29,441
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.

1105
01:22:30,581 --> 01:22:32,310
- They're friends of yours, Jerry?
- Yes, sir.

1106
01:22:32,516 --> 01:22:34,040
I met them on the cruise.

1107
01:22:34,952 --> 01:22:37,386
So you accidentally hopped onto
the Guytanic, too?

1108
01:22:37,788 --> 01:22:40,985
- How's it going?
- I guess not.

1109
01:22:41,692 --> 01:22:44,559
Jerry, I'm gonna keep
my eye on you.

1110
01:22:45,729 --> 01:22:48,892
- What 's up, guys?
- Nick, come here. It 's important.

1111
01:22:51,835 --> 01:22:55,396
There is no more sacred contract
than the bond of marriage.

1112
01:22:56,073 --> 01:23:01,136
And no more spiritual union than
that between a man and a woman.

1113
01:23:02,179 --> 01:23:04,511
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

1114
01:23:04,882 --> 01:23:10,582
to bring this man and this woman
together in the eyes of...

1115
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:14,758
in the eyes of...

1116
01:23:16,026 --> 01:23:17,550
God?

1117
01:23:17,761 --> 01:23:20,889
- God, yeah, that 's what you say.
- No, that 's what you say.

1118
01:23:21,598 --> 01:23:25,090
Yeah, well I used to
until recently. I mean...

1119
01:23:25,903 --> 01:23:28,394
if there was a God would He
allow my wife to run off...

1120
01:23:28,605 --> 01:23:31,005
with a non-union contractor who
overcharged me for a bay window?

1121
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:34,837
But that 's my problem, I'm sorry, and
it 's your day. I'm sorry. Where was I?

1122
01:23:35,045 --> 01:23:38,742
A happy marriage is the
perfect human relationship.

1123
01:23:39,116 --> 01:23:43,485
A setting in which each partner
feels free to be as he or she is...

1124
01:23:43,687 --> 01:23:46,121
under God's bountiful nature.

1125
01:23:46,824 --> 01:23:50,123
That same nature that allowed
the number 547 PIN code...

1126
01:23:50,727 --> 01:23:53,662
to screw me in a photo.
I'm sorry, where was I?

1127
01:23:54,832 --> 01:23:59,394
If there's anyone present who feels
that these two people should not...

1128
01:23:59,603 --> 01:24:02,037
...be joined together in matrimony...
- Come on.

1129
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:05,265
...let them speak now,
or forever hold their peace.

1130
01:24:11,148 --> 01:24:12,308
Okay, fine.

1131
01:24:12,516 --> 01:24:16,282
Jerry, then, if there's no objection,
turn to Felicia and repeat after me.

1132
01:24:17,955 --> 01:24:19,286
I, Jerry...

1133
01:24:19,556 --> 01:24:21,080
take you, Felicia...

1134
01:24:21,291 --> 01:24:25,455
...to be my lawful-wedded...
- Stop! Wait! Time out! Time out!

1135
01:24:25,662 --> 01:24:29,598
- Nick! What are you doing?
- I have to say something.

1136
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,468
If I didn't speak now,
I could never live with myself.

1137
01:24:33,036 --> 01:24:34,663
A couple of weeks ago...

1138
01:24:34,872 --> 01:24:37,739
Jerry and I took a cruise together.

1139
01:24:38,408 --> 01:24:40,842
It wasn't the cruise
we intended to take, but...

1140
01:24:41,211 --> 01:24:45,580
it was good we got in the wrong boat
because it changed our lives forever.

1141
01:24:45,849 --> 01:24:50,513
Jerry, if you marry Felicia today,
it will end up in disaster.

1142
01:24:50,921 --> 01:24:54,721
You need to be with the person
you fell in love with on that boat.

1143
01:24:55,726 --> 01:25:02,131
And I know it,
because that person is me.

1144
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:08,700
How much of that pot
did you smoke?

1145
01:25:08,939 --> 01:25:10,930
I know where Gabriella is.
If you hurry we can catch her.

1146
01:25:12,142 --> 01:25:14,610
Jerry?
What the hell is wrong with you?

1147
01:25:14,878 --> 01:25:19,178
You can't humiliate me like this!
My dad is gonna kill you!

1148
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:22,711
- Come on, Rocco! Come on, boy!
- Daddy!

1149
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,320
Come on, move! Move!

1150
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:28,315
Daddy, do something!

1151
01:25:30,928 --> 01:25:32,691
- Where's your car?
- We're not taking my car.

1152
01:25:32,896 --> 01:25:34,693
We'd never make it across town
in this traffic.

1153
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:38,661
Boys! Boys!

1154
01:25:43,607 --> 01:25:47,338
- Hector! You're a fireman!
- Yes!

1155
01:25:48,145 --> 01:25:50,010
I'm December in our calendar.

1156
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:55,416
Thank you, Ernie, dear.

1157
01:25:55,619 --> 01:25:56,847
Call me!

1158
01:26:02,459 --> 01:26:04,086
So where is Gabriella?

1159
01:26:04,361 --> 01:26:06,591
She signed up
to work another cruise.

1160
01:26:06,964 --> 01:26:10,400
- When does she leave port?
- Two hours ago!

1161
01:26:10,734 --> 01:26:12,201
Two hours ago?

1162
01:26:12,703 --> 01:26:15,934
And how am I supposed
to find her in the ocean?

1163
01:26:21,778 --> 01:26:23,109
I can't do this!

1164
01:26:23,614 --> 01:26:27,277
- I get motion sickness!
- Yes, you can. Come on, Jerry.

1165
01:26:27,484 --> 01:26:29,384
You're about to be united
with the woman you love.

1166
01:26:29,586 --> 01:26:30,883
What do you think?

1167
01:26:33,490 --> 01:26:36,721
Why don't you calm down?
You are in very, very good hands.

1168
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,023
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

1169
01:26:39,429 --> 01:26:43,525
I know you only think of me
as a hard-partying old queen...

1170
01:26:43,734 --> 01:26:47,898
but for your information, I spent
32 years in the Armed Forces...

1171
01:26:48,105 --> 01:26:51,541
serving Her Majesty,
the real Queen.

1172
01:26:52,142 --> 01:26:54,508
I've seen action in five different
theaters of war...

1173
01:26:54,711 --> 01:26:58,807
I've made over 49O drops,
23 over hostile territory.

1174
01:26:59,016 --> 01:27:04,044
I'm what you colonials might call
a bad-assed motherfucker...

1175
01:27:04,254 --> 01:27:06,313
who also happens
to be an expert...

1176
01:27:06,523 --> 01:27:09,856
in the delicate art
of Japanese flower arranging.

1177
01:27:11,328 --> 01:27:13,091
Over the target, captain.

1178
01:27:13,597 --> 01:27:15,588
Right! It 's now, or never.

1179
01:27:17,234 --> 01:27:20,101
Come on, Jerry, get out there!
Jump out!

1180
01:27:20,303 --> 01:27:21,292
I can't do this!

1181
01:27:21,738 --> 01:27:25,105
- Go get her, Jerry!
- This is a bad idea!

1182
01:27:29,379 --> 01:27:32,678
Wait, I'm gonna be sick.
I mean it!

1183
01:27:34,651 --> 01:27:36,312
I felt that one.

1184
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:39,011
Good Lord,
you're a crybaby.

1185
01:27:40,557 --> 01:27:43,993
Five, six, seven, eight. Kick!

1186
01:27:44,194 --> 01:27:46,685
Back! Head, up, down.

1187
01:27:46,897 --> 01:27:48,387
One more time.

1188
01:27:48,598 --> 01:27:51,624
Kick! Back!
Head, up, down.

1189
01:27:51,835 --> 01:27:54,702
I want it sassy, now. Come on.
Kick! Pliê.

1190
01:27:55,005 --> 01:27:57,667
Head, up, down.
And Kick! Pliê!

1191
01:27:57,874 --> 01:28:00,809
I'm not a person
who likes heights!

1192
01:28:01,645 --> 01:28:04,671
I don't feel so good.
I don't feel so good.

1193
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:09,311
I hate this!

1194
01:28:13,256 --> 01:28:14,382
What is that?

1195
01:28:14,825 --> 01:28:17,191
- I don't like it!
- We're over the target.

1196
01:28:17,861 --> 01:28:20,056
- Prepare for release!
- Release!

1197
01:28:25,268 --> 01:28:26,599
We did it!

1198
01:28:27,471 --> 01:28:28,938
I'm so excited.

1199
01:28:29,139 --> 01:28:33,007
If truth be told, I'm more
than a little excited myself.

1200
01:28:34,111 --> 01:28:35,942
Unhook me, please.

1201
01:28:36,847 --> 01:28:38,576
I don't believe this.

1202
01:28:38,782 --> 01:28:40,306
Help, please.

1203
01:28:40,517 --> 01:28:42,382
This time, I'm gonna
let you drown.

1204
01:28:42,686 --> 01:28:44,517
You're gonna have to drag me
over to the deep end...

1205
01:28:44,721 --> 01:28:46,780
'cause it 's only about
three and a half feet over here.

1206
01:28:47,157 --> 01:28:48,385
What are you doing here?

1207
01:28:48,592 --> 01:28:52,653
I was in the neighbourhood,
so I figured I'd just drop in.

1208
01:28:54,464 --> 01:28:57,627
- Goodbye.
- Gabriella, wait, please.

1209
01:29:02,873 --> 01:29:05,103
I thought I was being
reasonably clever...

1210
01:29:05,308 --> 01:29:08,106
considering I just dropped
1,5OO feet out of an airplane.

1211
01:29:08,545 --> 01:29:10,536
Why did you bother?

1212
01:29:23,059 --> 01:29:25,323
Because I love you.

1213
01:29:25,529 --> 01:29:27,019
Who loves me?

1214
01:29:27,230 --> 01:29:29,425
Gay Jerry as a friend?

1215
01:29:29,633 --> 01:29:33,626
Or is this straight, lying,
deceitful Jerry?

1216
01:29:37,174 --> 01:29:39,608
You've never met this Jerry.

1217
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:42,335
This is the extremely sorry...

1218
01:29:42,546 --> 01:29:45,538
unbelievably heartbroken
because you left me...

1219
01:29:45,782 --> 01:29:47,613
who'll do anything to get you
to forgive me...

1220
01:29:47,818 --> 01:29:50,685
because I want to spend the rest
of my life with you Jerry.

1221
01:29:52,789 --> 01:29:54,723
Well, you listen to me, Jerry.

1222
01:29:54,925 --> 01:29:56,950
Just because you dropped
out of the sky...

1223
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:59,319
and made this grand,
romantic gesture...

1224
01:29:59,529 --> 01:30:01,895
doesn't mean that I'm going to
automatically run into your arms.

1225
01:30:02,098 --> 01:30:03,895
Do you understand that?

1226
01:30:04,267 --> 01:30:05,325
- Yes.
- Good.

1227
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:12,338
Okay, I'm probably going to. But you
shouldn't automatically expect it...

1228
01:30:12,576 --> 01:30:14,339
because if we're going to have
the kind of relationship...

1229
01:30:14,544 --> 01:30:17,104
that one day you're going
to be making up these fantasies...

1230
01:30:22,185 --> 01:30:26,986
Don't you ever,
ever lie to me again.

1231
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:28,782
I swear.

1232
01:30:38,034 --> 01:30:40,093
I'll never understand it.

1233
01:30:40,303 --> 01:30:42,271
Neither will I.

1234
01:31:00,857 --> 01:31:02,552
Inga!

1235
01:31:05,362 --> 01:31:06,727
Inga...

1236
01:31:06,930 --> 01:31:08,488
Inga...

1237
01:31:08,698 --> 01:31:10,290
Inga...

1238
01:31:26,983 --> 01:31:29,577
My God! My God!

1239
01:31:31,488 --> 01:31:34,480
I'm Nick Ragoni.
I'm a friend of your daughter Inga.

1240
01:31:35,025 --> 01:31:37,585
I've travelled 12 thousand miles
to surprise her.

1241
01:31:37,894 --> 01:31:40,385
You poor thing. You look frozen.
Let me help you up.

1242
01:31:43,266 --> 01:31:45,029
Let me and my son help you up.

1243
01:31:45,235 --> 01:31:47,169
- Johann, come over here.
- Ja.

1244
01:31:49,506 --> 01:31:50,973
Come on.

1245
01:31:51,775 --> 01:31:55,768
This man is obviously
a fan of smorgasbord.

1246
01:31:56,846 --> 01:31:58,245
Ingmar, what 's going on?

1247
01:31:58,448 --> 01:32:01,576
Mother, he is an American friend
of Inga's.

1248
01:32:02,786 --> 01:32:05,380
I hope you didn't go too much
trouble to get here.

1249
01:32:05,588 --> 01:32:07,180
- Inga's not home.
- What?

1250
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:09,881
She's gone to Italy
on a modelling assignment.

1251
01:32:10,093 --> 01:32:12,152
Won't be back for three months.

1252
01:32:12,362 --> 01:32:17,959
- Oh God, no. I can't believe it.
- You poor boy. You look so cold.

1253
01:32:18,234 --> 01:32:21,169
You'll join us for dinner.
Bridgit?

1254
01:32:21,371 --> 01:32:23,532
Get this man some soup
from the stove.

1255
01:32:26,343 --> 01:32:29,437
Now this is Bridgit.
She wants to be a bikini model...

1256
01:32:29,646 --> 01:32:32,080
...just like her big sister.
- Nice to meet you.

1257
01:32:33,083 --> 01:32:36,348
And Bridgit 's coach will be
joining us for dinner, too.

1258
01:32:44,728 --> 01:32:46,662
Nicholas.

1259
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,430
We meet again.

1260
01:32:47,263 --> 01:32:48,855
Hello.

1261
01:32:49,855 --> 01:32:59,855
