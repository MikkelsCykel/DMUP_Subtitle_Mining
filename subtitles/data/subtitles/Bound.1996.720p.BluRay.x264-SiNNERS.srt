1
00:00:57,706 --> 00:01:03,254
I had this image of you
inside of me...

2
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:05,339
like a part of me.

3
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,721
You planned this whole thing.

4
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:15,516
We make our own choice.
We pay our own prices.

5
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,893
Five years is a long time.

6
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,937
Where's the fuckin' money?

7
00:01:27,027 --> 00:01:29,029
All part of the business.

8
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:31,740
All part of the business.

9
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:33,784
You made a choice once.

10
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:35,953
What choice?

11
00:01:38,872 --> 00:01:40,457
I want out.

12
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:57,516
Like a part of me.

13
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:01,437
Hold the elevator.

14
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:06,817
Thanks.

15
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,211
Yeah, I looked over everything, sir.

16
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:09,255
I don't think there should be
any problems.

17
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:13,717
Yes, sir, I ordered the vanity
and I looked at the tub.

18
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:16,428
I'm pretty sure we can rout it out.

19
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:22,685
Yeah, I'll start everything
first thing tomorrow.

20
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:31,360
Thanks again for this opportunity,
Mr. Bianchini.

21
00:03:33,862 --> 00:03:35,823
Yeah.

22
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:01,473
Hi.

23
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:04,393
My name is Violet.
We sort of met on the elevator.

24
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:06,895
I'm Corky.

25
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:11,400
I heard you working in here,
and I was wondering...

26
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,652
if you'd like a cup of coffee.

27
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:16,071
Sure.

28
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,573
Come on in.

29
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:19,533
Just give me a second.

30
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:20,993
All right.

31
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,001
What happened to Rajiv?

32
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:33,172
He went home to India or someplace,
but I think he'll be back.

33
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:36,216
So this is just
a temporary situation for you?

34
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,303
Yeah, pretty much.
One day at a time.

35
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:43,557
I guessed you're a straight black.

36
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,017
Good guess.

37
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,143
Thanks.

38
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:47,686
My pleasure.

39
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:52,942
To be honest, I did have
a slightly ulterior motive.

40
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:55,861
I was wondering if I might
ask you a little favor.

41
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,947
- Favor.
- Yeah.

42
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,574
I'm kind of a night person,
and I was wondering...

43
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:05,037
if you might wait a little bit
before you start using the power tools.

44
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,748
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, no. No.

45
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:12,836
It's not your fault. It's just
the walls here are so terribly thin.

46
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:17,091
- Really.
- It's like you're in the same room.

47
00:05:17,174 --> 00:05:19,426
If it's too much trouble,
I understand.

48
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,471
It's no trouble at all.
I got a lot to do here.

49
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,141
You doin' all the work yourself?

50
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,977
That is so amazing.

51
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,398
I am so in awe of people
who can fix things.

52
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:36,860
My dad was like that.
We never had anything new.

53
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:39,780
Whenever anything was broken,
he would just...

54
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:43,576
open it up, tinker with it
a little bit...

55
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,160
and fix it.

56
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,496
His hands were magic.

57
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:52,251
I'll bet your car
is 20 years old.

58
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:53,794
Truck.

59
00:05:53,836 --> 00:05:55,796
Truck. Of course.

60
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:59,174
- '63 Chevy.
- I knew it.

61
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:07,641
Well, I guess I should be going.

62
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:10,144
You can drop the cup off
at any time.

63
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,023
Thanks.

64
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:17,359
My pleasure.

65
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:31,332
Well, well.

66
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:33,334
It's been a long time, Cork.

67
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:36,795
Five years, two months
and sixteen days.

68
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,299
- How you doin', Sue?
- Like shit.

69
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:43,218
Now that we're all caught up,
can I buy you a drink?

70
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,553
Thanks.

71
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:48,849
- *  Friends keep tellin' me *
- Welcome home.

72
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:51,393
*  That you ain't no good *

73
00:06:51,435 --> 00:06:53,562
*  But, oh, oh, they don't know *

74
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,648
Did you get a job yet?

75
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:59,193
Yeah. Some plumbing,
painting and shit.

76
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:03,489
I mean a J-O-B.
A real job.

77
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,785
No. Not for me, Sue.

78
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:11,247
I'm just here to get laid.

79
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:14,917
*  I ain't never gonna *

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,752
*  Love a man *

81
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:18,754
*  The way that I *

82
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:20,798
*  I love you *

83
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:28,389
*  Some time ago I thought *

84
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:32,601
*  You had run out of fools *

85
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,728
*  But I was so wrong *

86
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:40,109
- Hi.
- Hello.

87
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:44,530
Hey, Jesse,
what's happenin' here?

88
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:48,826
Wait. I know you.

89
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:51,912
I don't think so.

90
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:54,039
I didn't know you were out.

91
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,753
When you get tired
of Cagney and Lacey, find me.

92
00:07:59,837 --> 00:08:02,590
*  Don't you never never say
that we're through *

93
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:43,130
*  Fast and slow
Night and day *

94
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:45,215
*  When you stop to think *

95
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:48,135
*  It just gets in the way *

96
00:08:48,218 --> 00:08:51,388
*  And there's not a single soul
among us *

97
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,145
Yeah.

98
00:08:58,228 --> 00:08:59,688
Hey, Mr. Bianchini.

99
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,107
Everything's going just fine.

100
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:05,569
Yeah, I got the tub drain
all cleaned out.

101
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:10,157
What apartment?

102
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:21,585
Oh, no.

103
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,880
Shit! I didn't know
he would call you.

104
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,800
You must think
I'm a total nuisance.

105
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:29,426
Not exactly.

106
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,762
I'm sorry. I would
usually call Rajiv...

107
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,682
but I didn't know what to do,
so I called Mr. Bianchini.

108
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:38,686
- He said you lost something?
- Yeah.

109
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:40,813
Come on in.

110
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:51,490
I was doing the dishes, and just as I
pulled the stopper, my earring fell in.

111
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:55,077
That's why I got upset.
It's one of my favorites.

112
00:09:57,955 --> 00:09:59,790
You got a pot or a bucket?

113
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:35,868
Did you find it?

114
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:43,292
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that.

115
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,754
I can't thank you enough.
You have to let me pay you something.

116
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,549
- No.
- No ?

117
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:54,386
Told Bianchini I'd do it.
I did it.

118
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:57,514
If you won't take money,
how about a drink?

119
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:00,684
You can't work all night.

120
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:05,397
All right.

121
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,028
One drink.

122
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:13,155
What would you like?

123
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,573
Beer.

124
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:16,075
Beer.

125
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:17,451
Of course.

126
00:11:27,044 --> 00:11:28,379
Sit down.

127
00:11:44,478 --> 00:11:45,604
Thanks.

128
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:47,690
You seem uncomfortable.

129
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:51,026
Do I make you nervous, Corky?

130
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,695
No.

131
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:55,281
Thirsty, maybe.

132
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,910
Curious, maybe.

133
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:04,039
That's funny. I'm feeling
a little bit curious myself.

134
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,210
That's a great tattoo.

135
00:12:13,424 --> 00:12:15,342
Beautiful labris.

136
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:17,761
Are you surprised
I know what it is?

137
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:19,179
Maybe.

138
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,568
I have a tattoo.

139
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,655
Would you like to see it?

140
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:43,871
A woman in upstate New York
did it for me.

141
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,584
Do you like it?

142
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,836
Took her all day to do it.

143
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,382
She promised
it wouIdn't hurt, but...

144
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:59,595
it was sore
for a long time after.

145
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,015
I couldn't even touch it.

146
00:13:05,726 --> 00:13:07,686
Now I love
the way it feels.

147
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:13,067
Here.

148
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,155
Touch it.

149
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,252
- What are you doing?
- Isn't it obvious?

150
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:34,797
I'm trying to seduce you.

151
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:37,549
Why?

152
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,677
Because I want to.

153
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:44,473
I've wanted to ever since I saw you
that day in the elevator.

154
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:52,898
I know you don't believe me...

155
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:54,942
but I can prove it to you.

156
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:04,618
You can't believe what you'd see...

157
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:10,374
but you can believe
what you feel.

158
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,508
I've been thinking about you
all day.

159
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,527
You planned this whole thing.

160
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:42,448
You dropped that earring
down the sink on purpose, didn't you?

161
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:46,744
If I say yes,
will you take your hand away?

162
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,081
- No.
- Yes.

163
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,463
Oh, please, Corky.

164
00:14:57,546 --> 00:14:59,006
Oh, please.

165
00:15:00,758 --> 00:15:02,217
Kiss me!

166
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,539
Oh, fuck!

167
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:39,421
Violet! Vi, you home?

168
00:15:39,463 --> 00:15:41,590
Yeah, I'm right here, C.

169
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,888
- What the fuck is this?
- I didn't--

170
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:49,431
What the fuck is--

171
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,352
Oh.

172
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:55,813
Corky, this is Caesar.
Caesar, Corky.

173
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:59,483
I thought--

174
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:03,404
It's fuckin' dark in here.

175
00:16:04,822 --> 00:16:07,283
Corky's doing some work
for Mr. Bianchini.

176
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:11,453
Oh, yeah. Right.
Don mentioned that to me.

177
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,832
I'm sorry. Hi.

178
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:16,500
Welcome to the family.

179
00:16:18,002 --> 00:16:20,754
So you're working
with Rajiv, right?

180
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:23,173
No. Rajiv's in India.

181
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,301
She's doing the work herself.

182
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,760
No shit.

183
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:29,888
Bianchini hired you. You must be
pretty good with your hands.

184
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:32,349
- He's a good friend of mine.
- That's what Violet says.

185
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,809
Family really.

186
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,187
- When did you get out?
- Jesus, Caesar.

187
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,648
What? It ain't
no big fuckin' deal.

188
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,026
I know who Don hires.

189
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:46,030
You know, he did time himself.
Thirteen fuckin' years.

190
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,824
What did you do?

191
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,869
- Five.
- Five.

192
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:54,413
That's not bad. What for?

193
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:56,874
That's none
of your goddamn business.

194
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,585
You're right. She's right.
It's none of my goddamn business.

195
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:02,171
You don't have to tell me.
It's just--

196
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,465
I want you to understand
one thing, all right?

197
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,259
You're amongst good people here.

198
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,311
Come on, come on.

199
00:17:18,395 --> 00:17:21,690
If you understand what I'm
talkin' about, you'll take the money.

200
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:25,194
If you don't, then I'm gonna
have to worry about you.

201
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,034
Good. I hate to worry.

202
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:34,703
I got ulcers.

203
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:39,375
I should be going.

204
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,253
What? No, stick around.
Get her a drink.

205
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,964
I gotta go clean out my brushes.

206
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,465
Another time.

207
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,718
Right. Another time.

208
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:11,323
Mmm, Corky, Corky.
What are you doing?

209
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:38,017
I had to see you.

210
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:41,729
Look. I don't think
this is a good idea.

211
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:44,148
I wanted to apologize.

212
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:48,903
No, please, don't apologize.

213
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:52,239
If there's one thing I can't stand it's
woman who apologize for wanting sex.

214
00:18:58,913 --> 00:19:01,206
I'm not apologizing
for what I did.

215
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,878
I'm apologizing
for what I didn't do.

216
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:31,904
You have a bed somewhere?

217
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:07,541
I can see again.

218
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:29,021
I needed that.

219
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:33,651
So Caesar's Mafia, huh?

220
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:35,611
You have to ask?

221
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,488
No.

222
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:38,781
Funny.

223
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,991
Nobody really
calls it that anymore.

224
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:43,285
Caesar just calls it
"the business."

225
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,704
How did you meet him?

226
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:48,749
They took over a club
I was working at.

227
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,668
Caesar started managing it.

228
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:53,879
- He's a launderer?
- Basically.

229
00:21:53,963 --> 00:21:55,631
How long you been with him?

230
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,259
About five years.

231
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:02,680
Five years is a long time.

232
00:22:02,763 --> 00:22:04,682
Yes, it is.

233
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,143
The redistribution of wealth.

234
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,814
- Excuse me?
- Isn't it what you wanted to know?

235
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,899
What I did time for?

236
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:17,027
"The redistribution of wealth?"

237
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:20,072
That's what I tell someone
when I'm trying to get them in my bed.

238
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:22,992
But I'm already in your bed.

239
00:22:25,995 --> 00:22:29,331
My cell mate would say
she did her time for getting caught.

240
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:32,167
She was always
a lot more honest than me.

241
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:36,505
You didn't have to tell me
if you didn't want to.

242
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,632
I guess I wanted to.

243
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:44,346
I'm glad you did.

244
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:47,391
So am I.

245
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:57,735
*  Let me tell you
about a girl I know *

246
00:22:57,818 --> 00:23:00,779
*  She is my baby
and she lives next door *

247
00:23:00,863 --> 00:23:04,074
*  Every mornin'
before the sun comes up *

248
00:23:04,158 --> 00:23:06,410
*  She brings my coffee
in my favorite cup *

249
00:23:06,493 --> 00:23:09,955
- *  That's why I know... *
- You think I don't know that?

250
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,540
Please. Come on.

251
00:23:11,582 --> 00:23:14,084
Will you just--
I have to leave tonight.

252
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,546
Don't make me beg, Violet.

253
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,634
Two minutes. Thank you.

254
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:34,980
Hey, Violet.

255
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:36,607
You look great.

256
00:23:50,287 --> 00:23:54,750
I had this image of you
inside of me.

257
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:58,087
Like a part of me.

258
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,466
You are so beautiful.

259
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,596
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

260
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:13,978
Yes, there is.
You didn't want to see me, did you?

261
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:17,022
If there's one thing I can't stand
about sleeping with women...

262
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:19,108
it's all the fucking mind reading.

263
00:24:20,401 --> 00:24:23,279
- I don't understand.
- I know, Violet.

264
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:26,198
That's 'cause you can't understand.
We're different.

265
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:28,576
We're not that different, Corky.

266
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:31,453
Ah, let's see.

267
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,456
This is the part
where you tell me...

268
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,875
what matters is on the inside...

269
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:40,170
and that inside of you there's
a little dyke just like me.

270
00:24:40,254 --> 00:24:44,300
No, she's nothing like you.
She's a whole lot smarter than you are.

271
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:46,385
Is that what her daddy tells her?

272
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:50,806
I know what I am. I don't have
to have it tattooed on my shoulder.

273
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:54,894
- You saying you don't have sex with men?
- I don't.

274
00:24:56,979 --> 00:25:01,317
For Christ's sake, I heard you.
Thin walls, remember?

275
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,652
What you heard wasn't sex.

276
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:06,989
What was it?

277
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:09,658
Work.

278
00:25:12,536 --> 00:25:15,539
You made certain choices in your life
that you paid for.

279
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:19,293
You said you made them because
you were good at something...

280
00:25:19,376 --> 00:25:21,253
and it was easy.

281
00:25:21,295 --> 00:25:24,048
You think you're the only person
that's good at something?

282
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:29,553
We make our own choices.
We pay our own prices.

283
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:32,222
I think we're more alike
than you care to admit.

284
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:34,600
What about that guy this morning?

285
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:36,727
Shelly?

286
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,605
Don't tell me.
You're a workaholic.

287
00:25:40,856 --> 00:25:44,443
No, Shelly knows what I am.
He saw me in a bar with another woman.

288
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:49,573
Yeah. I suppose
he just wants to watch.

289
00:25:49,657 --> 00:25:52,910
Fuck it.
I think you'd better leave.

290
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:54,954
Yeah, I think I'd better.

291
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:58,916
Try not to steal anything
on the way out.

292
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:19,163
Where the fuck is it?

293
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:22,082
I didn't do it!
I swear to you!

294
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,090
Come on!

295
00:27:30,174 --> 00:27:32,092
Where is it?

296
00:27:32,176 --> 00:27:33,802
- Oh, that hurt, didn't it?
- Ow!

297
00:27:36,639 --> 00:27:38,849
You think you're smart?

298
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:42,937
Where's that fuckin' money?

299
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:44,730
Please, please!

300
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:47,399
Please, let me go!

301
00:27:47,483 --> 00:27:48,859
Please stop it!

302
00:27:50,861 --> 00:27:53,530
Don't make me beg!

303
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:55,574
Stop it! Please!

304
00:27:57,743 --> 00:28:00,371
- Please stop!
- Tryin' to fuck us? You wanna fuck me?

305
00:28:00,454 --> 00:28:04,041
You piece of shit.
We're goin' home.

306
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:07,211
- Nobody fucks him!
- I'm not fucking him!

307
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:08,963
I swear to God!

308
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,464
Johnnie! Ho!

309
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:14,093
He's making too much noise.

310
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:16,262
You hear that, bitch?
Shut up.

311
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,600
Give me a towel.

312
00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:24,103
Shut up!

313
00:28:24,186 --> 00:28:25,604
Here.

314
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,275
Put it in his mouth.

315
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:44,873
Caesar, I'm leaving.

316
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,918
What? Why?

317
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:52,172
- I didn't use a good towel.
- Caesar, I'm serious.

318
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:54,508
I can't take this.
I have to get out of here.

319
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,843
Why?

320
00:28:57,094 --> 00:28:58,679
'Cause you know him?

321
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,390
Aw, you see?

322
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:05,102
Baby, that's what I love about you.

323
00:29:05,185 --> 00:29:07,187
You're so fuckin' sensitive.

324
00:29:09,023 --> 00:29:11,525
But I like you here.

325
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:13,569
I want you to stay.

326
00:29:14,612 --> 00:29:17,031
This is hard on me too.

327
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:18,616
I like Shelly.

328
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:23,537
So why don't you watch some TV
and put on a cassette or something?

329
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:32,880
You okay, Violet?

330
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:36,759
Mick, why is Johnnie here?

331
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,511
You know how I feel
about that psycho fuck?

332
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:43,224
Caesar, didn't I tell you
to get something?

333
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:45,809
Sure. Sorry about that.

334
00:29:49,772 --> 00:29:51,732
You shouldn't have to see this.

335
00:29:51,774 --> 00:29:54,401
Why don't you get out of here?
Go for a walk.

336
00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:57,696
Caesar wants me to stay.

337
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:04,203
Don't worry about Caesar.
I'll handle Caesar.

338
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:07,539
Get out of here.

339
00:30:07,623 --> 00:30:10,251
- We can go all night, bitch.
- Okay.

340
00:30:10,334 --> 00:30:11,585
Thank you, Mickey.

341
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:14,880
Here you go.

342
00:30:14,964 --> 00:30:17,633
All fuckin' night, baby!
All night!

343
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:27,851
Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay?

344
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:32,481
Bitch!

345
00:30:34,692 --> 00:30:36,193
Pick him up.

346
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:48,122
Shelly,

347
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:51,375
I'm gonna ask you ten times.
You understand?

348
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:53,836
Ten times.

349
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,963
Yeah.

350
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:12,730
One. Where's our money?

351
00:31:34,668 --> 00:31:36,337
You all right?

352
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:52,019
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

353
00:31:55,022 --> 00:31:57,608
Keep it.

354
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:17,419
Shelly was skimming
from the business.

355
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:23,801
He came to see me yesterday
because he was afraid Caesar found out.

356
00:32:23,884 --> 00:32:26,637
He wanted to run, but he
wanted me to come with him.

357
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,931
Even though he knew about you.

358
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,934
- Yeah.
- This guy's in love with you?

359
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:35,980
That's what he tells himself,
but it's not even about me.

360
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:39,942
He could have run at any time,
but he didn't want out.

361
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,986
It sounds like
he wanted to get caught.

362
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:44,321
Yeah. Maybe he did.

363
00:32:44,405 --> 00:32:47,449
He would brag to me
all the time.

364
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:50,828
He was never afraid
of Caesar because...

365
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,454
he didn't know him.

366
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:53,872
Not like I do.

367
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:58,043
I used to be able
to block it out.

368
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:01,547
Or I'd just tell myself that...

369
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:05,217
I wasn't really there,
and so...

370
00:33:06,677 --> 00:33:08,679
none of it really mattered.

371
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:12,558
But I can't do that anymore.

372
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:17,646
I'm making the same mistake
Shelly made...

373
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:21,775
but now I know what I want.

374
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,907
I want out.

375
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:32,578
I want a new life.

376
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:38,375
I see what I've been waiting for,
but I can't do it alone.

377
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:47,801
I need your help, Corky.

378
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:55,976
- Caesar's gonna get the money--
- How much money?

379
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,270
Shelly said it's over
two million dollars.

380
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:04,485
Yeah. So Caesar's gonna get it.

381
00:34:04,568 --> 00:34:07,780
He's gonna bring it by the apartment.
He's gonna count it.

382
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:10,783
He's gonna go through the books and try
and figure out how Shelly did it.

383
00:34:10,824 --> 00:34:13,619
Wait a minute. Violet, do you know
what you're saying?

384
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:16,247
You're asking me
to help you fuck over the Mob.

385
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:19,750
Violet, these people are serious.

386
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:22,544
You wanna know how serious?
Ask your friend Shelly.

387
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:26,340
They're worse than any cop because they
have lots of money and no rules.

388
00:34:26,423 --> 00:34:28,425
You fuck them,
you better do it right.

389
00:34:28,509 --> 00:34:31,595
That's why I need your help.
You said you were good.

390
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,138
I am good.

391
00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:40,062
Let's just say for a moment
I believe everything you're saying.

392
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,648
- You think I'm lying?
- I didn't say that.

393
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:47,152
But since you did,
let's say you are.

394
00:34:47,194 --> 00:34:49,822
It would have been easy for you
to set up Shelly.

395
00:34:49,863 --> 00:34:51,532
You could have had him killed...

396
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:53,784
knowing that Caesar would bring
the money back to the apartment.

397
00:34:55,452 --> 00:34:58,622
All you would need to keep yourself
clean is someone unconnected.

398
00:34:59,915 --> 00:35:01,500
Someone like me.

399
00:35:03,294 --> 00:35:05,379
Is that what you think?

400
00:35:05,462 --> 00:35:07,464
I'm just making a point.

401
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:12,344
You have no idea
what you're asking...

402
00:35:13,596 --> 00:35:17,558
how much trust it takes two people
to do something like this.

403
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:23,314
For me, stealing has always been
a lot like sex.

404
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:27,026
Two people who want
the same thing.

405
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:29,653
They get in a room,
they talk about it.

406
00:35:30,988 --> 00:35:33,324
They start to plan.
It's like flirting.

407
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:37,536
It's kind of like foreplay.

408
00:35:37,578 --> 00:35:40,915
Because the more they talk about it,
the wetter they get.

409
00:35:44,418 --> 00:35:47,004
The only difference is,
I can fuck someone I've just met.

410
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:52,509
But to steal, I need to know someone
like I know myself.

411
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,222
You think you know me like that?

412
00:35:57,973 --> 00:35:59,934
I wanna see the money.

413
00:36:03,103 --> 00:36:04,647
Oh, my God!

414
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,732
Don't worry.
It ain't mine.

415
00:36:15,491 --> 00:36:18,118
- Caesar, what happened?
- It was unbelievable, Vi.

416
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,246
Un-fuckin'-believable!

417
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:23,290
Shit! Look at this shirt.

418
00:36:23,374 --> 00:36:25,417
Look at it.
It's ruined.

419
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:28,045
It all started when Shelly
took us to the money.

420
00:36:28,128 --> 00:36:30,923
I'll tell you something.
Mickey, he knows his shit.

421
00:36:31,006 --> 00:36:32,967
He does.
Shelly took us right there.

422
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,678
So Shelly's down
on his knees, right...

423
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:39,139
and he's pulling out this money
from a safe on the floor...

424
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:40,724
and I'm standin' there...

425
00:36:40,808 --> 00:36:42,893
and I'm lookin' at it, right?

426
00:36:42,977 --> 00:36:45,145
Like, "Holy fuck!"

427
00:36:45,229 --> 00:36:50,693
All I can think about is, "How the fuck
was he able to do this," when bang!

428
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:53,862
Johnny caps him.
He caps Shelly!

429
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:57,116
Blood goes flyin' everywhere.
All over me. All over the money.

430
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:00,327
I have no idea
if this is even all of it.

431
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:05,708
And right then,
I go through the roof and bam!

432
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,710
I punch the dumb son of a bitch.

433
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:10,254
I punch him right in
his dumb fuckin' face.

434
00:37:10,337 --> 00:37:12,339
I didn't give a shit
whose son he was.

435
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:16,677
I just wanted to hit him again-- smack
some sense into the dumb son of a bitch!

436
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:19,847
Look at the shit that
I gotta fuckin' deal with now!

437
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:23,058
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I told him to run it through the cycle.

438
00:37:23,142 --> 00:37:26,270
But no, Johnnie calls up the old man,
and I guess he's got other plans...

439
00:37:26,353 --> 00:37:29,273
because he wants to pick up
this shit tomorrow night.

440
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:35,863
Where's the laundry detergent?

441
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:37,907
It's in the linen cabinet.

442
00:37:57,801 --> 00:38:00,763
Come to my place
in the morning, early.

443
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,851
You think you know me like that?

444
00:38:09,063 --> 00:38:10,814
Two million dollars.

445
00:38:13,442 --> 00:38:15,402
You're having second thoughts.

446
00:38:15,486 --> 00:38:17,947
No.

447
00:38:17,988 --> 00:38:19,949
You said Caesar washed the money?

448
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:23,202
- Yeah.
- Then what? Exactly.

449
00:38:23,285 --> 00:38:26,205
- He hung it up.
- He what?

450
00:38:26,288 --> 00:38:28,207
To let it dry.

451
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:32,795
It was unreal.

452
00:38:40,803 --> 00:38:43,806
Hundreds paper-clipped everywhere
like leaves.

453
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:54,817
Then one by one
he ironed all of it.

454
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:04,660
- Did he sleep?
- No, but neither did I.

455
00:39:10,124 --> 00:39:12,876
All night long
I listened to that sound.

456
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,754
- What sound?
- The sound of money.

457
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:23,387
Where is it now?

458
00:39:24,471 --> 00:39:26,140
It's in his office.

459
00:39:26,223 --> 00:39:28,183
I saw it this morning.

460
00:39:33,314 --> 00:39:35,316
I need to go to the store.

461
00:39:39,403 --> 00:39:41,822
It's in a case on his desk.

462
00:39:41,906 --> 00:39:43,991
Does the case lock?

463
00:39:44,074 --> 00:39:45,409
Yes.

464
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:51,165
- Huh. Tell me about Johnnie.
- Johnnie?

465
00:39:51,248 --> 00:39:53,208
Sounds like he and Caesar
don't like each other.

466
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:55,252
Like each other?
They hate each other.

467
00:39:55,294 --> 00:39:57,087
- Why?
- I don't know.

468
00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:59,256
Happened long before
I came around.

469
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,968
I think it's basically Caesar
thinks Johnnie's a complete idiot...

470
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:05,638
but, you know,
what can you do?

471
00:40:05,721 --> 00:40:08,349
Johnnie runs Chicago
'cause Gino's his father.

472
00:40:08,432 --> 00:40:09,558
Who's Gino?

473
00:40:11,435 --> 00:40:12,937
Gino Marzzone.

474
00:40:14,438 --> 00:40:18,442
Marzzone, as in Angelo Marzzone,
head of the Marzzone family?

475
00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:20,569
Yeah, that's his brother.

476
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:24,156
Shit.

477
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:27,785
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place
tonight to pick up the money?

478
00:40:27,868 --> 00:40:29,578
Yeah.

479
00:40:29,662 --> 00:40:32,164
And Johnnie Marzzone's his son?
That's Johnnie?

480
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:33,666
Yeah.

481
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,587
Sweet Jesus.

482
00:40:45,344 --> 00:40:46,845
It's perfect.

483
00:40:46,887 --> 00:40:49,723
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place
tonight. This is a big deal.

484
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:52,810
Caesar's gonna want to do it right.
He won't want to look like an idiot.

485
00:40:52,893 --> 00:40:55,479
- Has Gino been to your place before?
- Yeah, twice.

486
00:40:55,521 --> 00:40:58,524
- What happened?
- Caesar was really nervous.

487
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:00,776
He kept cleaning the apartment.

488
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:04,029
The first time he picked out the dress
he wanted me to wear.

489
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:06,031
Did Johnnie ever hit on you?

490
00:41:06,115 --> 00:41:09,493
Johnnie hits on me all the time.
He hits on anything in high heels.

491
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:13,664
- Did Caesar ever see this?
- He does it right in front of him.

492
00:41:13,706 --> 00:41:16,375
This is getting better and better.
Go on.

493
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:20,504
Well, Gino doesn't speak much English,
or at least he pretends not to...

494
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:22,756
so he usually gets
right to the point.

495
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,634
Both times they only talked
for about five minutes.

496
00:41:25,718 --> 00:41:27,845
They had a drink
and then they left.

497
00:41:27,928 --> 00:41:30,055
- What did Gino drink?
- Scotch.

498
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:34,768
Glenlivet. I remember that 'cause
Caesar made a big deal about it.

499
00:41:37,438 --> 00:41:39,273
All right.

500
00:41:46,238 --> 00:41:48,282
I have an idea
how to make this work.

501
00:41:49,867 --> 00:41:52,661
Go back and get ready.
Take your time. Make it real.

502
00:41:53,787 --> 00:41:56,290
What time did you say
they'd be there?

503
00:41:56,373 --> 00:42:00,294
The plane gets in at 7:00,
so I'd say around 8:00.

504
00:42:00,377 --> 00:42:02,755
All right.

505
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:05,257
Now, at some point,
Caesar's gonna quit.

506
00:42:05,299 --> 00:42:09,637
I guess sometime around 6:00,
making sure he's got time to get ready.

507
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,391
As soon as he's done, you'll be there
to put a big drink in his hand.

508
00:42:14,475 --> 00:42:17,436
Unbelievable
what this guy Shelly did.

509
00:42:17,478 --> 00:42:20,105
I'll tell you, Shelly's
one smart-ass motherfucker.

510
00:42:20,147 --> 00:42:24,318
I mean, he was
one smart-ass motherfucker.

511
00:42:24,401 --> 00:42:27,488
Poor boy.
Has to work so hard.

512
00:42:32,743 --> 00:42:35,454
You want him to relax, unwind.

513
00:42:36,914 --> 00:42:38,999
You look good enough to eat.

514
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:42,002
Where will you be?

515
00:42:42,086 --> 00:42:44,380
I'll be waiting
in the apartment next door.

516
00:42:44,463 --> 00:42:47,716
- Waiting for what?
- For the shower.

517
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,718
That's gonna be our signal.

518
00:42:50,678 --> 00:42:53,639
When he's done with his shower,
you'll go to the bar.

519
00:42:55,057 --> 00:42:57,643
You'll get out the scotch
that Gino drinks.

520
00:42:57,685 --> 00:43:00,938
As you do, the bottle
will slip from your hands.

521
00:43:02,189 --> 00:43:03,524
An accident.

522
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:07,987
Vi, what the hell was that?

523
00:43:08,737 --> 00:43:10,698
Vi, you can't hear me?

524
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:12,783
- Ah, fuck!
- Caesar, it slipped.

525
00:43:12,866 --> 00:43:15,869
- I was trying to get ready.
- How the fuck did you do that?

526
00:43:15,953 --> 00:43:18,455
Caesar, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to.

527
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:21,250
- I'll get some more.
- There's no fuckin' time!

528
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,335
Don't be silly.
There's lots of time.

529
00:43:23,377 --> 00:43:26,213
I'll clean this up and I'll be back
before you're even dressed.

530
00:43:26,255 --> 00:43:27,840
Fuck, Vi!

531
00:43:34,555 --> 00:43:37,099
When you open the door,
I'll be there.

532
00:43:41,896 --> 00:43:43,647
What if he sees you?

533
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:45,357
He won't.

534
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:48,402
You can't know for certain
that he won't see you.

535
00:43:49,862 --> 00:43:52,865
- Trust me.
- I'm just asking. What if?

536
00:43:53,782 --> 00:43:55,451
If he does...

537
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,204
then I won't have a choice,
will I?

538
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:04,960
When I'm inside,
I'll get the money.

539
00:44:47,127 --> 00:44:49,672
I'm gonna need something
to fill the case.

540
00:44:49,755 --> 00:44:51,674
Hide it near the desk.

541
00:44:52,758 --> 00:44:54,134
And at that point...

542
00:44:57,054 --> 00:44:59,014
there's no turning back.

543
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,861
When I get the scotch...

544
00:45:14,029 --> 00:45:16,031
how do I know
you won't just take off?

545
00:45:17,032 --> 00:45:20,494
The same way I'll know that you
went to go get the scotch.

546
00:45:20,536 --> 00:45:21,620
Trust.

547
00:45:21,704 --> 00:45:23,831
I still don't see how
I'm gonna get away clean...

548
00:45:23,914 --> 00:45:25,874
with all the money
in the apartment.

549
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:28,168
Everyone's gonna think
I took it.

550
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:29,587
- Not Caesar.
- Why?

551
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,839
'Cause of what
you're gonna tell him.

552
00:45:31,922 --> 00:45:34,008
You gotta be as real as you can.

553
00:45:34,842 --> 00:45:37,720
The moment you walk through
that door with the scotch...

554
00:45:37,803 --> 00:45:39,221
you'll be covered.

555
00:45:40,431 --> 00:45:43,684
That moment's the most important
moment of the plan.

556
00:45:43,726 --> 00:45:47,354
'Cause if you're real enough, he's
gonna believe you, 'cause deep down...

557
00:45:47,438 --> 00:45:48,689
he'll want to.

558
00:45:48,772 --> 00:45:52,026
C? Shit, I'm sorry.
They were early.

559
00:45:53,068 --> 00:45:56,196
- What are you talkin' about?
- They just left, didn't they?

560
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,199
- What, are you drunk?
- They weren't just up here?

561
00:45:59,283 --> 00:46:01,702
No, they're still on their way.

562
00:46:01,785 --> 00:46:03,412
That doesn't make any sense.

563
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,250
- Why?
- I just saw Johnnie downstairs.

564
00:46:11,003 --> 00:46:12,087
What?

565
00:46:12,171 --> 00:46:15,674
Yeah. I was getting out of my car,
and I saw him in his BMW.

566
00:46:17,801 --> 00:46:20,179
- Nah, it couldn't have been.
- It was him, Caesar.

567
00:46:20,262 --> 00:46:21,597
I'm positive.

568
00:46:23,807 --> 00:46:25,017
Vi, that's impossible.

569
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,020
Caesar, I know Johnnie.

570
00:46:28,103 --> 00:46:29,605
It was him.

571
00:46:29,688 --> 00:46:32,399
I screamed when I saw him.
I couldn't believe I missed him.

572
00:46:32,483 --> 00:46:35,736
I knew you were gonna be upset, so I
thought I'd stop and apologize...

573
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:37,988
and give Gino the scotch, but...

574
00:46:38,072 --> 00:46:41,283
I honked a couple of times, and Johnnie
didn't even hear me. He didn't stop.

575
00:46:44,411 --> 00:46:45,746
But...

576
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:49,124
Gino's plane doesn't get here
for another half hour.

577
00:46:53,462 --> 00:46:55,548
Actually, I didn't see Gino
in the car.

578
00:47:07,184 --> 00:47:11,105
If Caesar hates Johnnie as much as
you say, when he opens that case...

579
00:47:11,188 --> 00:47:14,817
he's gonna know in his gut
that Johnnie just fucked him.

580
00:47:14,858 --> 00:47:18,737
He'll have no choice.
He can't go after Gino or Johnnie.

581
00:47:18,821 --> 00:47:20,823
There's only one way out.

582
00:47:21,699 --> 00:47:23,075
He'll have to run.

583
00:47:24,952 --> 00:47:26,829
And if he runs...

584
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:29,623
everyone will assume
he took the money.

585
00:47:29,707 --> 00:47:32,626
You'll be clean,
and we'll be rich.

586
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:35,087
Jesus, that's beautiful.

587
00:47:36,714 --> 00:47:40,426
If you're this goddamn smart,
how did you ever get caught?

588
00:47:41,343 --> 00:47:43,554
I had a partner once.

589
00:47:43,637 --> 00:47:45,180
She fucked me.

590
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,059
I won't.

591
00:47:52,187 --> 00:47:54,064
I think we're gonna find out.

592
00:47:58,611 --> 00:48:00,738
- Oh, God!
- Caesar?

593
00:48:03,198 --> 00:48:05,117
No.

594
00:48:05,868 --> 00:48:07,786
C?

595
00:48:09,455 --> 00:48:10,748
Oh, no.

596
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:13,709
Oh, God.

597
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,257
Vi.

598
00:48:20,341 --> 00:48:22,009
Vi, I've been set up.

599
00:48:22,092 --> 00:48:23,594
Johnnie?

600
00:48:23,677 --> 00:48:25,179
That fuck!

601
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:28,474
That rat fuck!

602
00:48:28,515 --> 00:48:31,310
That motherless rat fuck!

603
00:48:31,393 --> 00:48:34,813
Why? Why would Johnnie do this?

604
00:48:38,734 --> 00:48:42,446
Jesus Christ. Violet,
open your fucking eyes.

605
00:48:42,488 --> 00:48:44,782
Johnnie hates me
as much as I hate him.

606
00:48:46,325 --> 00:48:48,244
I hate that motherless rat fuck.

607
00:48:48,327 --> 00:48:51,455
- I fuckin' hate him.
- But you know he did it.

608
00:48:52,289 --> 00:48:55,251
Yeah. So what?
So fucking what?

609
00:48:56,585 --> 00:49:00,256
Look, the money is gone, right?

610
00:49:00,339 --> 00:49:02,132
Gino's coming to get it.

611
00:49:02,174 --> 00:49:05,469
Do you think Gino is going to believe me
when I tell him...

612
00:49:05,511 --> 00:49:08,472
his little rat fuck son stole it?

613
00:49:08,514 --> 00:49:11,350
'Cause I don't.
You know what I think?

614
00:49:11,392 --> 00:49:14,144
I'm a dead man.
I'm one in the back of the head.

615
00:49:14,186 --> 00:49:15,729
That's what I think.

616
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,066
What are we gonna do?

617
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:23,070
I know what Johnnie wants me to do.
Johnnie wants me to run.

618
00:49:23,153 --> 00:49:25,072
He wants me outta here.

619
00:49:25,155 --> 00:49:28,158
But if I run, then everybody thinks
I fucking did it...

620
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,202
and he gets away
with two million clean.

621
00:49:32,204 --> 00:49:34,373
I can see him right now...

622
00:49:34,456 --> 00:49:36,500
on the way to get Gino,
laughin' at me!

623
00:49:36,584 --> 00:49:38,460
Laughin' at me, laughin' at me !

624
00:49:38,544 --> 00:49:40,212
Laughin' at me!

625
00:49:40,296 --> 00:49:42,298
Fuckin' laughin' at me!

626
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,511
Don't! Please.
Don't touch me, okay?

627
00:49:47,595 --> 00:49:50,264
I gotta think. I gotta
fuckin' think this through!

628
00:49:51,932 --> 00:49:54,310
Caesar, I think we should run.

629
00:49:54,393 --> 00:49:57,104
We have to go now,
before it's too late!

630
00:49:57,187 --> 00:49:59,648
Please, Violet, leave me alone.

631
00:49:59,732 --> 00:50:01,191
Please, all right?

632
00:50:01,275 --> 00:50:03,444
Just leave me the fuck alone!

633
00:50:07,197 --> 00:50:08,532
All right, Caesar.

634
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:13,579
I gotta think, that's all.
I just gotta think.

635
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:40,689
- It's me.
- What happened?

636
00:50:40,773 --> 00:50:44,193
He totally freaked out.
I've never seen him like this.

637
00:50:44,276 --> 00:50:46,028
He's out of his fucking mind.

638
00:50:46,111 --> 00:50:48,989
That's all right, as long as
he believes it was Johnnie.

639
00:50:49,031 --> 00:50:51,617
Believes it?
Jesus!

640
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,703
It's driving him crazy.
He wants to kill him.

641
00:50:55,913 --> 00:50:57,915
I don't know, Corky.

642
00:50:57,998 --> 00:51:01,543
I'm getting really nervous.
I don't know what he's gonna do.

643
00:51:01,627 --> 00:51:04,505
It's all right, Violet.
It's working.

644
00:51:04,588 --> 00:51:07,299
All we gotta do is wait him out
and see what he does.

645
00:51:07,341 --> 00:51:09,343
What if he doesn't run?

646
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:13,013
That means he'll probably
kill Johnnie.

647
00:51:13,097 --> 00:51:15,099
Oh, Christ!
I have to get out of here!

648
00:51:15,182 --> 00:51:19,979
Listen, if he doesn't run,
all you gotta do is break down.

649
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,523
Go into the bedroom
and pack some things.

650
00:51:22,565 --> 00:51:25,526
Start crying. Tell him you love him,
but you can't take it.

651
00:51:25,568 --> 00:51:29,196
You're sorry, but you gotta Ieave,
and just waIk out.

652
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,365
All right. Okay.

653
00:51:31,448 --> 00:51:34,493
We're almost there.
Just hang on.

654
00:51:34,577 --> 00:51:35,703
He's coming!

655
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,584
I know what I have to do.
I have to get the money back.

656
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:44,503
The money?
The money's gone.

657
00:51:44,587 --> 00:51:47,882
No, Johnnie's got it.
I gotta get it back.

658
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:50,217
It could be anywhere.

659
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:52,344
There's not enough time, Violet.

660
00:51:52,428 --> 00:51:54,513
Johnnie's gotta pick up Gino
at the airport, right?

661
00:51:54,597 --> 00:51:58,559
That means he's probably got
the money with him in the car.

662
00:51:58,642 --> 00:52:00,102
Did he see you?

663
00:52:00,185 --> 00:52:02,688
No.

664
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:05,149
Good. That's good.

665
00:52:09,278 --> 00:52:11,405
That means I got the edge.

666
00:52:11,488 --> 00:52:13,490
He doesn't know I know.

667
00:52:16,952 --> 00:52:19,038
That's why he put
the paper in the case.

668
00:52:20,456 --> 00:52:22,499
He wants me
to hand it to Gino.

669
00:52:24,376 --> 00:52:26,378
Then there's no doubt I did it.

670
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:29,757
Gino will put a bullet in me himself.

671
00:52:32,301 --> 00:52:34,345
But that's not gonna happen.

672
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:41,310
That jack-off's not gonna set me up.
No way. Not like this.

673
00:52:43,062 --> 00:52:44,438
This is insane.

674
00:52:49,568 --> 00:52:51,111
What are you doin'?

675
00:52:52,321 --> 00:52:53,656
I'm leaving.

676
00:52:53,739 --> 00:52:57,284
I don't want any part of this shit.
I don't want to be involved.

677
00:52:57,368 --> 00:52:59,662
- You can't leave.
- The hell I can't.

678
00:53:02,373 --> 00:53:05,167
- I need you.
- You don't need me.

679
00:53:05,251 --> 00:53:07,169
You've never needed me.

680
00:53:07,253 --> 00:53:09,338
I can't help you, understand?

681
00:53:18,138 --> 00:53:20,140
I can't let you leave.

682
00:53:21,267 --> 00:53:24,770
If you're not with me,
I have to assume you're against me.

683
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:28,190
Caesar, this is crazy.

684
00:53:28,232 --> 00:53:31,443
Maybe it is.
Maybe it isn't.

685
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,197
Maybe you dropped that bottle
of scotch by accident.

686
00:53:35,281 --> 00:53:36,574
Maybe you didn't.

687
00:53:37,575 --> 00:53:40,661
I would've been so easy...

688
00:53:40,744 --> 00:53:42,788
to let him in as you left.

689
00:53:44,373 --> 00:53:45,874
You can't believe that.

690
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:48,085
I've seen the way he looks at you.

691
00:53:49,003 --> 00:53:51,005
He's always wanted you.

692
00:53:52,089 --> 00:53:53,966
Maybe two million bucks
finally bought you.

693
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:05,227
I'm sorry, Violet.

694
00:54:09,481 --> 00:54:10,900
I wanna trust you.

695
00:54:11,942 --> 00:54:13,527
But you understand.

696
00:54:21,785 --> 00:54:23,787
I don't have any other choice.

697
00:54:42,473 --> 00:54:44,266
You sure you don't want a drink?

698
00:55:10,417 --> 00:55:11,961
- Hello.
- Yeah, we're here.

699
00:55:12,002 --> 00:55:13,963
- Hey, Johnnie.
- Open the fuckin' door.

700
00:55:14,004 --> 00:55:15,464
Sure. Come on up.

701
00:55:52,793 --> 00:55:54,044
Gino.

702
00:55:56,547 --> 00:55:59,383
Good to see you.
Vi, look who's here.

703
00:55:59,466 --> 00:56:01,468
Hello, Gino.
How are you?

704
00:56:09,101 --> 00:56:11,854
- You shouldn't have hit me.
- You wanna get into this now?

705
00:56:11,937 --> 00:56:13,522
No, Caesar, not now.

706
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,200
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.

707
00:56:40,716 --> 00:56:43,552
Gino, Glenlivet, right?

708
00:56:44,803 --> 00:56:47,723
And I'll have
whatever Violet's drinking.

709
00:56:47,806 --> 00:56:50,476
- I'm not drinking.
- Oh, well, then neither will I.

710
00:56:52,311 --> 00:56:54,521
No, I'll have
a Tanqueray and tonic.

711
00:56:55,981 --> 00:56:57,983
Caesar, two T&T's.

712
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:20,631
Salud, eh?
Roy, Pop, Violet.

713
00:57:20,673 --> 00:57:22,007
Caesar.

714
00:57:24,093 --> 00:57:26,053
Uh-uh, no, no, Johnnie.

715
00:57:26,136 --> 00:57:28,514
- I gotta make a bet.
- No goddamn phone. Not now.

716
00:57:30,349 --> 00:57:33,435
Cesare, come and sit.
We're gonna talk now.

717
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:36,438
Johnnie, you too.
No, no.

718
00:57:39,942 --> 00:57:41,360
Cesare, look at me.

719
00:57:43,237 --> 00:57:45,322
Johnnie, he said to me
what happened.

720
00:57:47,408 --> 00:57:52,079
Cesare, you gotta do me a favor.
A personal favor for me, huh?

721
00:57:53,163 --> 00:57:56,542
You gotta start respecting Johnnie
the way you respect me.

722
00:57:58,752 --> 00:58:01,672
Good, good.

723
00:58:03,132 --> 00:58:06,552
And you, Johnnie,
you gotta stop acting stupid.

724
00:58:08,053 --> 00:58:10,472
You gotta earn this respect
that Cesare's gonna give.

725
00:58:14,935 --> 00:58:16,186
Good!

726
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:17,563
Done!

727
00:58:20,399 --> 00:58:21,734
Now...

728
00:58:24,111 --> 00:58:25,738
where's my money?

729
00:58:35,456 --> 00:58:37,249
We know how this was done?

730
00:58:38,959 --> 00:58:41,170
Yeah. I know.

731
00:58:42,004 --> 00:58:44,256
And it won't happen again?

732
00:58:45,966 --> 00:58:48,010
Good. Done. We go now.

733
00:58:48,093 --> 00:58:50,095
Wait a minute, Pop.
Jesus Christ.

734
00:58:50,137 --> 00:58:53,349
You got two hours
till your plane leaves.

735
00:58:55,309 --> 00:58:57,019
Just relax. Have a drink.

736
00:58:57,102 --> 00:59:00,648
Caesare, Glenlivet.

737
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:10,157
So, Caesar, tell me something.

738
00:59:10,241 --> 00:59:12,284
What did it total out at?

739
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:14,870
2.176.

740
00:59:14,954 --> 00:59:17,164
Unbelievable.

741
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,625
Can you believe that, Violet?

742
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:21,835
Johnnie.

743
00:59:21,919 --> 00:59:23,921
I just wanna know one thing.

744
00:59:25,089 --> 00:59:28,008
Just one thing after he made
such a big deal about it.

745
00:59:29,134 --> 00:59:31,387
I'll bet it wasn't such a big deal,
huh, Caesar?

746
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:35,224
What's that, Johnnie?

747
00:59:36,058 --> 00:59:37,893
The money.

748
00:59:37,977 --> 00:59:39,979
I'll bet it wasn't nothin'
to make it clean...

749
00:59:40,062 --> 00:59:42,356
after you made such
a big fuckin' deal about it.

750
00:59:42,398 --> 00:59:44,400
- What I tell you--
- It's important to me, Pop.

751
00:59:44,483 --> 00:59:47,653
It's a simple question. If he'd
answer it, that's the end of it.

752
00:59:52,449 --> 00:59:53,951
Where's this goin', Johnnie?

753
00:59:55,077 --> 00:59:57,871
Just admit it.

754
00:59:59,915 --> 01:00:01,375
Admit what?

755
01:00:01,417 --> 01:00:03,878
That you overreacted!

756
01:00:03,919 --> 01:00:07,006
You lost it! Not me.

757
01:00:09,091 --> 01:00:11,093
It was your mistake.

758
01:00:11,176 --> 01:00:14,513
You wanna play it this way?

759
01:00:14,597 --> 01:00:16,599
I could play it this way.

760
01:00:17,933 --> 01:00:20,895
You wanna know who made a mistake?

761
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:24,148
Open the case.

762
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:26,191
- Caesar.
- Shut up, Violet.

763
01:00:26,275 --> 01:00:28,152
This is between me and Johnnie.

764
01:00:31,447 --> 01:00:33,198
You wanna do this now?

765
01:00:35,576 --> 01:00:37,786
Let's do it.

766
01:00:40,998 --> 01:00:42,958
Open the fuckin' case.

767
01:00:48,797 --> 01:00:50,716
Open the case.

768
01:00:59,767 --> 01:01:01,185
Where's the fucking key?

769
01:01:01,268 --> 01:01:02,770
You don't need a key.

770
01:01:02,811 --> 01:01:04,980
Then how the fuck can I open it?

771
01:01:06,148 --> 01:01:08,567
The same way you did before.

772
01:01:08,651 --> 01:01:11,278
What are you talking about?

773
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:15,658
All right, Johnnie.

774
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,040
Violet...

775
01:01:24,124 --> 01:01:26,335
get me another drink.

776
01:01:44,019 --> 01:01:47,773
- What is this?
- Don't you fucking move!

777
01:01:47,856 --> 01:01:50,317
- Where is it, fuckface?

778
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:52,194
- Where's what?
- The money!

779
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:56,323
Okay, Caesar, if you don't
put down that gun--

780
01:01:56,407 --> 01:01:58,033
Sit down.

781
01:02:00,286 --> 01:02:02,204
Caesar, what is this?

782
01:02:02,288 --> 01:02:05,040
Gino, your son stole this money
to set me up!

783
01:02:05,124 --> 01:02:07,877
He fuckin' stole it,
and I can prove it!

784
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,254
Violet, tell them.

785
01:02:10,337 --> 01:02:12,131
Tell them!

786
01:02:12,214 --> 01:02:14,800
For God's sake, Johnnie,
do what he says.

787
01:02:14,884 --> 01:02:18,679
For Christ's sake!
This isn't happening.

788
01:02:21,432 --> 01:02:23,392
Next one blows off
your fuckin' dick!

789
01:02:23,475 --> 01:02:27,229
I'm looking at a dead man.
You're a fuckin' dead man!

790
01:02:27,313 --> 01:02:29,273
Enough!

791
01:02:29,315 --> 01:02:32,568
- Gino, don't.
- Do you point the gun at me?

792
01:02:34,111 --> 01:02:38,073
Do you know who I am?
I am Gino Marzzone!

793
01:02:42,077 --> 01:02:43,996
No, Gino, please.

794
01:02:45,539 --> 01:02:47,917
Gino, sit down.

795
01:02:49,627 --> 01:02:51,420
We're family, Cesare.

796
01:02:51,503 --> 01:02:54,548
Family, Caesar.

797
01:02:54,632 --> 01:02:56,133
Family.

798
01:02:57,468 --> 01:02:58,886
Now...

799
01:03:00,638 --> 01:03:02,556
give it to me.

800
01:03:12,691 --> 01:03:14,777
Good man.

801
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,564
Don't shoot.

802
01:04:17,798 --> 01:04:20,759
I had to do it, Violet.

803
01:04:20,801 --> 01:04:24,054
You saw it.
I had no choice.

804
01:04:25,472 --> 01:04:27,600
It was Johnnie.

805
01:04:27,683 --> 01:04:30,769
Lying rat fuck.
He made me do it.

806
01:04:32,104 --> 01:04:34,940
Hey! Hey!

807
01:04:35,024 --> 01:04:39,445
You stupid fuck!
You think you could set me up? Huh?

808
01:04:44,116 --> 01:04:47,453
I'm a dead man, Johnnie?
I'm a fucking dead man?

809
01:04:47,494 --> 01:04:50,247
Guess again, Johnnie.
Who's the dead man? Who?

810
01:04:50,331 --> 01:04:53,834
Who's dead, fuckface?
Who? Who?

811
01:04:53,918 --> 01:04:56,712
I can't hear you, Johnnie.
Guess again.

812
01:04:56,795 --> 01:05:00,674
Take another guess, Johnnie.
Take another fuckin' guess.

813
01:05:12,478 --> 01:05:14,021
What are you doing?

814
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:26,951
Maybe three hours.

815
01:05:26,992 --> 01:05:29,495
Caesar, what are you going to do?

816
01:05:30,871 --> 01:05:33,666
- We're gonna get the money back.
- What?

817
01:05:33,707 --> 01:05:37,878
Violet, if we get the money back,
then none of this ever happened.

818
01:05:37,962 --> 01:05:42,007
Caesar, you just killed
Gino Marzzone.

819
01:05:42,091 --> 01:05:46,011
No, I didn't.
Not if the bodies disappear.

820
01:05:46,053 --> 01:05:48,847
Not if the money's here.
Then they never showed up.

821
01:05:48,931 --> 01:05:51,559
What happened to them?

822
01:05:51,642 --> 01:05:54,520
I don't know.
Maybe we'll never know.

823
01:05:57,982 --> 01:06:00,859
My guess, it was a job.

824
01:06:02,069 --> 01:06:05,990
Maybe the Carpella's.
All part of the business.

825
01:06:06,073 --> 01:06:09,618
Look, once we find the money,
then everything's gonna be all right.

826
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:17,501
Somebody's coming.

827
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:24,049
- Fuck!
- Oh, no.

828
01:06:24,133 --> 01:06:25,551
Fuck!

829
01:06:27,261 --> 01:06:30,389
Caesar, what are we gonna do?

830
01:06:30,431 --> 01:06:34,226
They're just cops.
Stall 'em as long as you can.

831
01:06:52,244 --> 01:06:54,288
Gino, man.

832
01:06:57,208 --> 01:06:59,877
Come on. Come on!

833
01:07:12,681 --> 01:07:14,141
Answer it.

834
01:07:21,398 --> 01:07:24,068
- Hello?
- This is the police, ma'am.

835
01:07:24,151 --> 01:07:25,569
The police?

836
01:07:25,653 --> 01:07:28,572
We had a report of gunfire.
Can you buzz us in, please?

837
01:07:28,656 --> 01:07:32,284
- Gunfire? Is this a joke?
- No joke, ma'am.

838
01:07:49,927 --> 01:07:52,137
- Please open the door.
- Um.

839
01:07:53,931 --> 01:07:56,976
How do I know
that you're really the police?

840
01:07:59,937 --> 01:08:02,898
Ma'am, you have to open the door.

841
01:08:04,275 --> 01:08:06,026
All right.

842
01:09:48,546 --> 01:09:53,133
Now, if you're thinking
about doing something stupid...

843
01:09:53,217 --> 01:09:58,347
remember, I just killed
Gino Marzzone.

844
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:00,766
You understand what that means?

845
01:10:02,142 --> 01:10:04,645
They're just cops.

846
01:10:16,198 --> 01:10:18,742
See? We're for real.

847
01:10:20,911 --> 01:10:24,790
I'm sorry. It's just that
sometimes you hear stories.

848
01:10:24,874 --> 01:10:26,542
You did the right thing.

849
01:10:35,467 --> 01:10:37,428
Come on in.

850
01:10:41,223 --> 01:10:44,059
Hey, hey! Chicago's finest.

851
01:10:44,101 --> 01:10:46,729
How's it going tonight, fellas?

852
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:48,397
Very good, sir?

853
01:10:48,439 --> 01:10:51,692
I'm sorry. I got a bum ear.
Can't hear shit with it.

854
01:10:51,775 --> 01:10:54,403
My name is Caesar,
and this here is my Violet.

855
01:10:56,822 --> 01:11:01,619
So, Violet tells me there's
some problems about gunshots.

856
01:11:01,702 --> 01:11:05,122
Uh, yes, sir.
A neighbor in the building called in.

857
01:11:05,206 --> 01:11:08,626
- I think we know what happened.
- Probably just the television.

858
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,004
Oh, the television.

859
01:11:12,087 --> 01:11:14,757
Honey, why don't you turn it off?

860
01:11:17,343 --> 01:11:18,928
This happened before.

861
01:11:19,011 --> 01:11:20,930
This ear, I was born with it.

862
01:11:20,971 --> 01:11:24,808
The batteries went dead
on my hearing aid. I'm sorry.

863
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:26,769
- It's all right.
- No big deal.

864
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:30,147
I hate to trouble you guys.
Can I get you a beer?

865
01:11:30,189 --> 01:11:32,900
Uh, no. Not on duty. Sorry.

866
01:11:34,068 --> 01:11:36,612
But, uh, do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

867
01:11:39,323 --> 01:11:41,617
No. Sure.
It's right over here.

868
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:43,410
Thanks.

869
01:11:43,494 --> 01:11:46,163
Listen, do you mind
if I make myself a drink?

870
01:11:46,205 --> 01:11:47,748
Yeah, right there.

871
01:11:47,831 --> 01:11:50,501
Sure. Go right ahead, sir.

872
01:12:15,859 --> 01:12:17,778
This is a beautiful place.

873
01:12:17,861 --> 01:12:19,947
Thank you.

874
01:12:31,876 --> 01:12:34,044
Is this a condo?

875
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:41,969
Okay, let's roll.

876
01:12:45,431 --> 01:12:49,059
Oh, try to keep extra batteries
around for the aid, okay?

877
01:12:49,101 --> 01:12:50,603
Good idea.

878
01:12:54,857 --> 01:12:56,775
Come on. Let's go.

879
01:13:05,618 --> 01:13:07,453
Shit.

880
01:13:22,718 --> 01:13:24,720
Fuck! Where is it?

881
01:13:26,972 --> 01:13:28,432
Think.

882
01:13:30,476 --> 01:13:32,478
It's gotta be at his place.

883
01:13:34,146 --> 01:13:35,940
Get in the car.

884
01:13:36,023 --> 01:13:38,984
- Caesar, I don't think--
- Get in the fucking car!

885
01:14:03,259 --> 01:14:05,594
Two million dollars, Corky.

886
01:14:07,846 --> 01:14:12,351
Two million dollars.
It's gotta be here. It's gotta be.

887
01:14:12,434 --> 01:14:16,355
I just-- I gotta think.
Think Iike Johnnie.

888
01:14:16,397 --> 01:14:20,359
Okay, I'm Johnnie.

889
01:14:24,697 --> 01:14:26,615
I come in.

890
01:14:28,534 --> 01:14:29,952
Where did I put it?

891
01:14:31,579 --> 01:14:35,583
That's a Iot of fuckin' money,
and I gotta hide it.

892
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:38,878
I gotta hide it.
I don't have much time.

893
01:14:38,961 --> 01:14:43,299
I gotta get to the airport,
pick up my fuckin' daddy!

894
01:14:50,222 --> 01:14:53,434
I can't wait to see Caesar's face
when he finds out.

895
01:15:03,694 --> 01:15:07,114
- Where did he put it?
- C.

896
01:15:10,826 --> 01:15:12,786
Think. Think.

897
01:15:21,337 --> 01:15:24,006
Where is it, you motherfucker?

898
01:15:24,089 --> 01:15:26,008
Where? Where?

899
01:15:44,068 --> 01:15:45,819
C?

900
01:15:47,863 --> 01:15:49,823
C.

901
01:15:57,122 --> 01:15:59,250
It's not here, Caesar.

902
01:16:03,337 --> 01:16:05,256
Where is it?

903
01:16:05,339 --> 01:16:09,552
I don't know.
It could be anywhere.

904
01:16:09,635 --> 01:16:12,346
We don't even know
if he was alone, Caesar.

905
01:16:12,429 --> 01:16:15,432
Come on.
We have to get out of here.

906
01:16:15,516 --> 01:16:17,601
We don't have much time.

907
01:16:25,317 --> 01:16:26,735
What are you doing?

908
01:16:38,581 --> 01:16:41,917
Gotta buy more time. More time.

909
01:16:42,001 --> 01:16:44,461
Who are you gonna call?

910
01:16:53,888 --> 01:16:55,806
- Yeah?
- Hey, Mickey.

911
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:57,308
Oh, God.

912
01:16:58,934 --> 01:17:00,895
Caesar, what the fuck time is it?

913
01:17:00,936 --> 01:17:05,065
Oh, Mickey, did I wake you up?
Listen, I'm sorry. I know it's late.

914
01:17:05,107 --> 01:17:08,444
I don't know if this is a big deal,
but they ain't showed up yet.

915
01:17:08,485 --> 01:17:10,446
What? They ain't there?

916
01:17:10,487 --> 01:17:14,533
No. I-I-I called the airport.
The plane landed on time.

917
01:17:14,617 --> 01:17:18,078
I even called over at Johnnie's house,
but there was no answer there.

918
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:21,248
Okay. Let me call around.
I'll see what I can do.

919
01:17:21,332 --> 01:17:23,292
Don't go anywhere, okay?

920
01:17:23,334 --> 01:17:25,419
Yeah, okay, sure.

921
01:17:25,502 --> 01:17:28,422
Caesar, you still have the money?

922
01:17:28,505 --> 01:17:30,466
Oh, yeah, Mickey,
I still got the money.

923
01:17:30,507 --> 01:17:33,219
Starin' right at it.

924
01:17:33,302 --> 01:17:36,096
Good. Sit tight.
I'll call you.

925
01:17:37,765 --> 01:17:39,183
Bye.

926
01:17:51,695 --> 01:17:54,323
So I'll start packing.
You know what you have to do.

927
01:17:54,365 --> 01:17:57,952
I'll use Johnnie's car
to dump the bodies in the lake.

928
01:17:58,035 --> 01:18:00,704
I need plastic bags, rope and tape.

929
01:18:01,830 --> 01:18:04,208
Just hurry.

930
01:18:17,346 --> 01:18:19,348
Please, Corky, please.

931
01:18:24,228 --> 01:18:26,689
- Thank God.
- I'm still here.

932
01:18:26,772 --> 01:18:29,191
I was so afraid
you were going to leave me.

933
01:18:30,442 --> 01:18:32,736
You don't quit on me, Violet.
I won't quit on you.

934
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:42,246
Corky, it worked.
He's going to run.

935
01:18:42,329 --> 01:18:45,249
He needs to take care of the bodies
to buy himseIf a little time...

936
01:18:45,332 --> 01:18:47,751
but as soon as he leaves,
it's over.

937
01:18:47,835 --> 01:18:49,879
Just a little while longer.

938
01:18:51,589 --> 01:18:53,048
Corky...

939
01:18:57,428 --> 01:18:59,346
I want to tell you something.

940
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:01,348
I know, Violet.

941
01:19:05,144 --> 01:19:06,604
I know.

942
01:19:10,482 --> 01:19:12,109
It's why I'm still here.

943
01:19:29,668 --> 01:19:31,253
Who was that?

944
01:19:31,337 --> 01:19:33,631
Vi, who the fuck was that?

945
01:19:36,175 --> 01:19:39,261
Did you call Mickey?
Did you call Mickey?

946
01:19:39,345 --> 01:19:41,263
Did you!

947
01:20:01,116 --> 01:20:04,078
Mickey, is that you?

948
01:20:04,161 --> 01:20:05,162
Fuck.

949
01:20:30,688 --> 01:20:32,940
Who is that?
Who's over there?

950
01:20:33,023 --> 01:20:36,277
Who's over there?
Tell me! Tell me!

951
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:40,573
No! Stop! Caesar! Caesar!

952
01:20:46,287 --> 01:20:49,665
No! No! No! Caesar!

953
01:21:35,753 --> 01:21:38,255
Drop the fucking gun or die.

954
01:21:39,381 --> 01:21:41,133
Drop it!

955
01:21:41,217 --> 01:21:42,635
Turn around.

956
01:21:48,182 --> 01:21:49,642
You?

957
01:21:51,644 --> 01:21:53,562
Holy fucking Christ.

958
01:21:58,025 --> 01:22:00,402
You gotta be fucking kiddin' me.

959
01:22:06,867 --> 01:22:09,370
You gotta be fucking kiddin' me.

960
01:22:10,871 --> 01:22:12,998
Hey!

961
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,875
Come on!

962
01:22:14,959 --> 01:22:17,545
Wake up. Wake up.

963
01:22:21,298 --> 01:22:24,426
Wake up, you fucking dyke.

964
01:22:26,679 --> 01:22:28,514
Good.

965
01:22:29,765 --> 01:22:31,475
I know everything now.

966
01:22:31,559 --> 01:22:35,062
So I don't wanna hear any
"I don't know" bullshit, understand?

967
01:22:37,398 --> 01:22:41,777
God, I shouId've seen this coming
the minute I met you.

968
01:22:43,571 --> 01:22:46,532
Everybody knows
your kind can't be trusted.

969
01:22:47,867 --> 01:22:49,785
Fuckin' queers.
You make me sick.

970
01:22:54,081 --> 01:22:56,208
But you made a fatal mistake.

971
01:22:56,292 --> 01:22:58,752
You tried to fuck the wrong guy...

972
01:22:58,794 --> 01:23:01,463
and I swear to you...

973
01:23:01,547 --> 01:23:03,632
I'm gonna kill you for it.

974
01:23:04,758 --> 01:23:06,510
Where's my money?

975
01:23:06,594 --> 01:23:09,388
Don't tell him.
He can't kill you.

976
01:23:09,471 --> 01:23:12,683
- Violet.
- Not until he has the money.

977
01:23:19,273 --> 01:23:22,610
Now, where is it?

978
01:23:22,693 --> 01:23:24,320
Lick me.

979
01:23:24,403 --> 01:23:28,240
Where is my money?

980
01:23:29,783 --> 01:23:33,537
Either pull the trigger, or get
that fucking thing out of my face.

981
01:23:33,621 --> 01:23:35,581
Fuckin' cunt.

982
01:23:35,664 --> 01:23:38,334
Caesar, stop acting
like an asshole and think.

983
01:23:38,417 --> 01:23:40,920
Violet, don't try
to tell me what to do.

984
01:23:41,003 --> 01:23:43,297
You need the money just like we do.

985
01:23:43,339 --> 01:23:45,841
- Shut up!
- Let us go. We'll make a deal.

986
01:23:45,883 --> 01:23:48,135
Shut the fuck up!

987
01:23:49,762 --> 01:23:52,348
What did you do to her, huh?

988
01:23:52,431 --> 01:23:55,100
What did you fuckin' do to her?

989
01:23:55,184 --> 01:23:57,269
That's not my Violet!

990
01:23:59,188 --> 01:24:01,190
What did she do to you?

991
01:24:01,273 --> 01:24:03,067
Everything you couldn't.

992
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:11,242
You ungrateful fuckin' bitch.

993
01:24:13,327 --> 01:24:16,664
Vi, you were nothing
before you met me.

994
01:24:16,705 --> 01:24:18,832
Don't you remember?
You had nothing.

995
01:24:20,251 --> 01:24:22,962
Who gave you this place, huh?

996
01:24:23,045 --> 01:24:25,005
Who gave it to you?

997
01:24:25,089 --> 01:24:27,675
I did, Vi. I did.

998
01:24:27,716 --> 01:24:31,220
You were nothing.
You had nothing.

999
01:24:31,303 --> 01:24:35,349
What a load of crap.
Take a look at yourself, Caesar.

1000
01:24:35,432 --> 01:24:38,978
You're nothing but a common thug.
You launder money for the Mob.

1001
01:24:39,061 --> 01:24:41,397
You rent women
like you rented this apartment.

1002
01:24:41,438 --> 01:24:45,693
You used me, Caesar.
That's all. Just like I used you.

1003
01:24:45,734 --> 01:24:48,362
All part of the business.

1004
01:24:48,445 --> 01:24:50,948
You betrayed me.

1005
01:24:51,031 --> 01:24:52,741
You murdered Gino.

1006
01:24:52,825 --> 01:24:55,870
Yeah, sure. You made me.
I had to do that.

1007
01:24:55,953 --> 01:24:58,455
Bullshit! You did it.

1008
01:24:58,539 --> 01:25:01,292
You did it because you couldn't stand
the thought of Johnnie fucking you.

1009
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:02,793
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

1010
01:25:02,877 --> 01:25:05,254
All right, Violet. All right!

1011
01:25:05,337 --> 01:25:08,257
You want the business, Violet?
All of the business?

1012
01:25:08,299 --> 01:25:11,635
I'll fucking give it to you.
I'll give you all of it.

1013
01:25:11,719 --> 01:25:14,096
I'm gonna make you fuckin' suffer.

1014
01:25:14,179 --> 01:25:17,391
Just like Shelly, Violet.
Just like fuckin' Shelly.

1015
01:25:24,064 --> 01:25:25,482
I'm sorry, Corky.

1016
01:25:25,566 --> 01:25:29,194
Don't be sorry.
Help me.

1017
01:25:37,536 --> 01:25:39,955
Oh, no, no, no!

1018
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:45,753
Hey, Vi, do you remember these?

1019
01:25:49,006 --> 01:25:51,967
All right,
I'm gonna start with Violet.

1020
01:25:53,677 --> 01:25:57,306
So you get an idea
of what's comin'.

1021
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:05,689
I'm gonna ask you ten questions.

1022
01:26:07,024 --> 01:26:10,653
Every time I don't get an answer...

1023
01:26:13,864 --> 01:26:15,991
I cut off a finger.

1024
01:26:23,916 --> 01:26:25,918
Where's the money?

1025
01:26:38,389 --> 01:26:39,974
It's Mickey.

1026
01:26:44,228 --> 01:26:47,940
I said, "Where's the money?"

1027
01:26:48,023 --> 01:26:50,609
All right, I'll tell you.

1028
01:26:52,361 --> 01:26:54,238
It's in the apartment next door.

1029
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,365
I put it in the paint drums.

1030
01:26:56,448 --> 01:27:01,245
Good. Now, I promised you
I wouId kill you. Remember?

1031
01:27:01,328 --> 01:27:03,622
You can't kill me.

1032
01:27:03,706 --> 01:27:06,083
Oh, reaIIy? Why not?

1033
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:07,793
I could be lying.

1034
01:27:10,296 --> 01:27:12,506
You're gonna be sorry you said that.

1035
01:27:30,149 --> 01:27:31,567
Motherfucker!

1036
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:36,488
Son of a bitch.

1037
01:27:42,661 --> 01:27:44,747
Keys, keys, keys, keys.

1038
01:28:30,918 --> 01:28:35,965
I can kill you right now,
if that's what you want.

1039
01:28:36,048 --> 01:28:38,676
Or you can live.

1040
01:28:38,717 --> 01:28:41,011
But I need your help.

1041
01:28:41,053 --> 01:28:44,723
You gotta help me make Mickey believe
that everything is normal.

1042
01:28:44,807 --> 01:28:47,685
Now, what do you wanna do?

1043
01:28:47,726 --> 01:28:50,437
Do you wanna live?

1044
01:29:22,303 --> 01:29:25,139
Oh! Oh, shit!

1045
01:29:25,222 --> 01:29:29,810
Christ! Mickey, you scared
the shit out of me.

1046
01:29:31,896 --> 01:29:34,315
What are you guys doin'
with your peckers in your hand?

1047
01:29:34,398 --> 01:29:36,317
You gonna do me, Mickey?

1048
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:39,445
No. There was no answer.

1049
01:29:39,528 --> 01:29:42,114
I thought I heard some knocking
at the door.

1050
01:29:42,198 --> 01:29:44,116
I was buzzing, I was knocking...

1051
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,744
but I guess you couldn't hear me
on account of being in the shower.

1052
01:29:46,827 --> 01:29:49,872
Yeah, well, you know, Mick,
I'm all wound up.

1053
01:29:49,955 --> 01:29:53,417
I'm driving myself crazy
over this Gino thing, and, well...

1054
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:56,962
Vi, you know, she thought maybe...

1055
01:29:57,046 --> 01:30:01,508
she could, you know,
relax me in the--

1056
01:30:03,761 --> 01:30:06,847
That Violet is one nice lady.

1057
01:30:08,599 --> 01:30:10,559
I wish someone
would help me relax.

1058
01:30:10,643 --> 01:30:15,439
Uh, let me get you guys
a drink, huh?

1059
01:30:15,522 --> 01:30:18,442
I got scotch,
whatever you want.

1060
01:30:21,695 --> 01:30:23,364
We was worried about you.

1061
01:30:23,447 --> 01:30:25,074
Me? Why?

1062
01:30:25,157 --> 01:30:27,826
We went over to Johnnie's place,
just to check it out.

1063
01:30:27,868 --> 01:30:29,578
It was busted up, bad.

1064
01:30:29,662 --> 01:30:31,497
What?

1065
01:30:31,539 --> 01:30:34,041
Started thinking
maybe it's about the money.

1066
01:30:34,083 --> 01:30:37,711
So I call you,
but all I got is the busy signal.

1067
01:30:37,795 --> 01:30:40,714
I figure the phone is off the hook.
That's why I come rushing over here.

1068
01:30:40,798 --> 01:30:44,218
Fuck, the phone. Shit.
That was me. I did that.

1069
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:47,805
Fuck! That was
a stupid thing to do, huh?

1070
01:30:49,014 --> 01:30:52,518
Hey, if Violet
was helping me relax...

1071
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,478
I'd probably do the same thing.

1072
01:31:17,751 --> 01:31:20,087
Hey, Caes, can I ask you something?

1073
01:31:20,170 --> 01:31:22,131
Sure.

1074
01:31:23,299 --> 01:31:25,718
Why did you move
all the furniture around?

1075
01:31:30,222 --> 01:31:31,932
Let me guess.

1076
01:31:32,975 --> 01:31:35,394
That was Violet's idea too.

1077
01:31:38,731 --> 01:31:41,025
Yeah, uh, actually...

1078
01:31:41,108 --> 01:31:43,861
she was nervous
about Gino comin'...

1079
01:31:43,944 --> 01:31:45,946
and wanted everything
to look perfect and--

1080
01:31:46,030 --> 01:31:47,948
You know women, Mick.

1081
01:31:48,032 --> 01:31:52,536
Sure, Caes. They make us do
stupid things, don't they?

1082
01:31:59,251 --> 01:32:01,670
- Is that the money?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

1083
01:32:01,754 --> 01:32:03,380
What did it total out at?

1084
01:32:03,464 --> 01:32:05,507
2.176.

1085
01:32:05,591 --> 01:32:07,509
That fuckin' Shelly.

1086
01:32:08,761 --> 01:32:10,846
Gotta hand it to the guy,
but, Jesus...

1087
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:13,724
if I were him, I would've
bailed a long time ago.

1088
01:32:13,807 --> 01:32:18,312
I mean, how much money
does a man need?

1089
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:24,652
I remember, I was just staring
at all this goddamn money.

1090
01:32:24,735 --> 01:32:28,113
Shelly went down on his knees...

1091
01:32:28,197 --> 01:32:31,951
and the next thing I know,
Johnnie just blows his head off.

1092
01:32:33,702 --> 01:32:36,038
What a fuckin' mess.

1093
01:32:36,121 --> 01:32:38,040
Johnnie's laughing his ass off...

1094
01:32:38,123 --> 01:32:41,544
and that's when Caesar lost it.

1095
01:32:41,627 --> 01:32:43,128
And boom.

1096
01:32:43,212 --> 01:32:45,631
He cold-cocked him.

1097
01:32:45,714 --> 01:32:49,843
He cold-cocks fuckin'
Johnnie Marzzone.

1098
01:32:53,722 --> 01:32:57,101
Hey, Caesar.

1099
01:33:00,646 --> 01:33:02,064
Where's the key?

1100
01:33:03,148 --> 01:33:05,401
Um, the key--

1101
01:33:07,903 --> 01:33:11,907
Oh, they're in my pants
in the bathroom.

1102
01:33:11,991 --> 01:33:15,202
Ah, fuck it.
I don't need the key.

1103
01:33:17,288 --> 01:33:19,915
I didn't need a key
to get in here, did I?

1104
01:33:42,438 --> 01:33:44,732
Who the hell could that be?

1105
01:33:49,445 --> 01:33:50,863
Are you gonna answer it?

1106
01:33:50,946 --> 01:33:52,406
Yeah.

1107
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:03,000
- Hello?
- Hello, Caesar.

1108
01:34:03,083 --> 01:34:05,127
- This is Gino.
- What?

1109
01:34:05,169 --> 01:34:08,631
You're blowing your only chance,
asshole. Act like I'm Gino.

1110
01:34:10,174 --> 01:34:13,135
Holy Christ! We've been
worried sick about you, Gino.

1111
01:34:13,177 --> 01:34:14,637
- Good boy.
- It's Gino.

1112
01:34:14,678 --> 01:34:16,889
- Where the hell is he?
- We were in a car accident.

1113
01:34:16,972 --> 01:34:19,558
- They were in a car accident.
- But everybody's all right.

1114
01:34:19,642 --> 01:34:22,686
Everybody's all right.
Just bruises and shit.

1115
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:25,731
Un-fucking-believabIe. I called
those highway patrols. Dumb fucks.

1116
01:34:25,814 --> 01:34:27,733
Mick, please.
I'm trying to hear Gino.

1117
01:34:27,816 --> 01:34:30,986
Now you listen to me, asshole.
I know your gun is behind the bar.

1118
01:34:31,028 --> 01:34:34,156
Either we make a deal right now,
or I hand this phone to Mickey.

1119
01:34:34,198 --> 01:34:35,658
I'm listening.

1120
01:34:35,699 --> 01:34:40,204
All right. I want what's mine.
I want half the money.

1121
01:34:40,287 --> 01:34:43,207
We get rid of Mickey,
and no one else dies.

1122
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:46,544
No one. Say, "Yes, I understand."

1123
01:34:46,627 --> 01:34:48,546
Yes, I understand.

1124
01:34:48,629 --> 01:34:51,924
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's
off the Kennedy in the waiting room.

1125
01:34:52,007 --> 01:34:54,593
Stay on the phone
until I come out.

1126
01:34:54,677 --> 01:34:57,638
Okay. Right.

1127
01:34:57,721 --> 01:34:59,848
St. Mary's off the Kennedy.

1128
01:34:59,932 --> 01:35:01,559
Yeah.

1129
01:35:01,642 --> 01:35:03,227
Johnnie's okay?

1130
01:35:03,310 --> 01:35:05,729
Mickey?
What are you doing here?

1131
01:35:05,813 --> 01:35:08,566
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.
They were in a car accident.

1132
01:35:08,607 --> 01:35:10,651
Oh, my God!
Is everybody all right?

1133
01:35:10,734 --> 01:35:12,903
- I think everything's okay.
- All right. Bye.

1134
01:35:12,987 --> 01:35:15,114
They're at St. Mary's.
Can you fucking believe this?

1135
01:35:15,197 --> 01:35:17,366
I can't fit them all in my car,
so give me your keys.

1136
01:35:17,449 --> 01:35:18,909
- Sure.
- You drive my car.

1137
01:35:18,993 --> 01:35:21,245
Vi! Vi!

1138
01:35:21,287 --> 01:35:25,291
Do me a favor. Go in my pants
in the bathroom and get my keys.

1139
01:35:25,374 --> 01:35:28,377
Come on. Let's go.
Vi, let's go!

1140
01:35:38,929 --> 01:35:41,849
- Thanks, V.
- Call me as soon as you get there.

1141
01:35:41,932 --> 01:35:44,059
Leave your phone on the hook.

1142
01:35:48,689 --> 01:35:50,774
Now, that's teamwork.

1143
01:35:50,858 --> 01:35:53,736
I should've let 'em kill you.

1144
01:35:53,819 --> 01:35:56,071
He would've done you too.

1145
01:35:56,155 --> 01:35:58,073
I knew I couldn't trust you.

1146
01:35:58,157 --> 01:36:01,994
Relax. I said
I would let you live...

1147
01:36:02,036 --> 01:36:04,330
and I will.

1148
01:36:05,664 --> 01:36:07,082
Maybe.

1149
01:36:14,715 --> 01:36:18,510
Let's go see if your dyke
was dumb enough to lie.

1150
01:36:18,594 --> 01:36:20,721
Let's go.

1151
01:36:46,247 --> 01:36:47,456
Yes.

1152
01:36:48,374 --> 01:36:50,000
No!

1153
01:36:52,878 --> 01:36:54,296
Violet!

1154
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:03,597
Violet! Violet!

1155
01:37:10,229 --> 01:37:12,189
Violet!

1156
01:37:44,847 --> 01:37:46,765
Come on, please.

1157
01:37:55,107 --> 01:37:57,818
Bitch! You fuckin' bitch!

1158
01:38:21,425 --> 01:38:22,885
- Mickey?
- Violet?

1159
01:38:22,968 --> 01:38:25,763
Oh, God, Mickey.
He made me do it.

1160
01:38:25,846 --> 01:38:28,390
I was so afraid.
I didn't want to, Mickey.

1161
01:38:28,474 --> 01:38:31,477
It was Caesar, all Caesar.
He made me help him.

1162
01:38:31,518 --> 01:38:35,856
You have to help me.
Oh, God! Oh, God, he's coming!

1163
01:38:51,413 --> 01:38:53,499
Corky?

1164
01:38:59,046 --> 01:39:00,464
Oh, fuck.

1165
01:39:58,898 --> 01:40:01,275
Stop!

1166
01:40:02,318 --> 01:40:04,153
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

1167
01:40:07,239 --> 01:40:10,075
It's over, Caesar.

1168
01:40:11,493 --> 01:40:13,871
I called Mickey.
He's on his way.

1169
01:40:15,748 --> 01:40:18,667
Get out of here, Caesar.

1170
01:40:18,751 --> 01:40:21,503
If you want to live,
you'd better start running.

1171
01:40:23,589 --> 01:40:26,258
All these years,
and you still don't know me.

1172
01:40:29,678 --> 01:40:31,096
But I know you.

1173
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:32,806
Caesar, don't.

1174
01:40:34,183 --> 01:40:37,186
What are you gonna do
with that, Vi? Shoot me?

1175
01:40:38,771 --> 01:40:42,066
Kill me in cold blood?
I don't think so.

1176
01:40:42,149 --> 01:40:46,111
If you were gonna shoot me, Vi,
you'd have done it a long time ago.

1177
01:40:46,195 --> 01:40:51,283
If I were you, I'd have shot me
the minute I brought the money back.

1178
01:40:51,367 --> 01:40:55,579
But you didn't,
and I'llI tell you why.

1179
01:40:55,663 --> 01:40:58,040
You don't want to shoot me, Vi.

1180
01:40:59,625 --> 01:41:01,377
Do you?

1181
01:41:02,461 --> 01:41:03,796
Do you?

1182
01:41:05,297 --> 01:41:06,757
I know you don't.

1183
01:41:09,426 --> 01:41:12,137
Caesar, you don't know shit.

1184
01:41:58,976 --> 01:42:03,188
I'll never understand it, Mickey.
You didn't even call the police.

1185
01:42:03,272 --> 01:42:07,193
I told you. The family
doesn't want the police around.

1186
01:42:07,276 --> 01:42:10,196
We want to take care of it
ourselves, and we will.

1187
01:42:11,405 --> 01:42:14,617
I'll find him.
I swear I will.

1188
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:16,660
I know you will.

1189
01:42:18,829 --> 01:42:20,956
Sure you're gonna be okay?

1190
01:42:20,998 --> 01:42:24,627
I mean, if you're having
second thoughts...

1191
01:42:26,212 --> 01:42:28,422
my offer still stands.

1192
01:42:28,505 --> 01:42:32,551
Thanks, Mickey,
but I have to get out.

1193
01:42:32,635 --> 01:42:36,889
You know, I have to get away
from all this.

1194
01:42:36,972 --> 01:42:38,891
But thanks.

1195
01:42:45,731 --> 01:42:47,691
Thanks for everything.

1196
01:43:20,975 --> 01:43:23,143
- Hey.
- Hey.

1197
01:43:23,227 --> 01:43:25,396
So, how'd it go?

1198
01:43:25,479 --> 01:43:28,566
- I'm here, aren't I?
- Mm-hmm.

1199
01:43:35,239 --> 01:43:37,741
Well, I thought we might need
a getaway car.

1200
01:43:37,825 --> 01:43:38,951
Hmm.

1201
01:43:41,287 --> 01:43:44,623
You know what the difference is
between you and me, Violet?

1202
01:43:44,707 --> 01:43:46,625
No.

1203
01:43:46,709 --> 01:43:48,627
Me, neither.

1204
01:43:56,135 --> 01:43:57,678
*  Well, she's all you'd ever want *

1205
01:43:57,761 --> 01:44:01,098
*  She's the kind I'd like to flaunt
and take to dinner *

1206
01:44:11,609 --> 01:44:14,028
*  She's a lady *

1207
01:44:14,111 --> 01:44:18,073
*  Oh, oh, oh, she's a lady *

1208
01:44:18,157 --> 01:44:22,494
*  Talkin' about that little lady *

1209
01:44:22,536 --> 01:44:26,207
*  And the lady is mine *

1210
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:29,585
*  But she's never in the way *

1211
01:44:29,668 --> 01:44:35,633
*  Always something nice to say
What a blessing *

1212
01:44:35,674 --> 01:44:37,718
*  I can leave her on her own *

1213
01:44:37,801 --> 01:44:41,680
*  Knowing she's okay alone
and there's no messin' *

1214
01:44:43,724 --> 01:44:46,185
*  She's a lady *

1215
01:44:46,227 --> 01:44:50,356
*  Oh, oh, oh, she's a lady *

1216
01:44:50,439 --> 01:44:54,902
*  Talkin' about that little lady *

1217
01:44:54,985 --> 01:44:58,906
*  And the lady is mine *

1218
01:45:00,282 --> 01:45:02,535
*  No she never asks very much *

1219
01:45:02,618 --> 01:45:04,578
*  And I don't abuse her *

1220
01:45:04,662 --> 01:45:06,539
*  Always treat her with respect *

1221
01:45:06,622 --> 01:45:08,874
*  I never would abuse her *

1222
01:45:08,916 --> 01:45:10,501
*  What's she's got is hard to find *

1223
01:45:10,584 --> 01:45:12,545
*  And I don't want to lose her *

1224
01:45:12,628 --> 01:45:19,468
*  Help me build a mountain
from a little pile of clay *

1225
01:45:21,428 --> 01:45:23,013
*  But she's knows what I'm about *

1226
01:45:23,097 --> 01:45:25,099
*  She can take what I dish out *

1227
01:45:25,182 --> 01:45:27,059
*  And that's not easy *

1228
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:31,188
*  But she knows me
through and through *

1229
01:45:31,272 --> 01:45:33,107
*  And she knows just what to do *

1230
01:45:33,190 --> 01:45:35,192
*  And how to please me *

1231
01:45:37,319 --> 01:45:39,780
*  She's a lady *

1232
01:45:39,864 --> 01:45:43,367
*  Oh, oh, oh, she's a lady *

1233
01:45:43,951 --> 01:45:47,037

*  Ooh, oh, oh, she's a lady *

1237
