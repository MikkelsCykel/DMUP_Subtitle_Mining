MEDITERRANEAN SEA
60 MILES SOUTH OF MARSEILLES

2
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,640
SAILORS:

3
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,960
What a mess.

4
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,640
You've never seen a dead man before?

5
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,320
Put a blanket on him. Cover him.

6
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,720
I'm coming.

7
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,640
Be careful.

8
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,120
One minute. I'll be right there. Cover him.

9
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,000
BOURNE: What the hell
are you doing to me?

10
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,400
BOURNE: What are you doing?

11
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,560
Goddamn it! Where am I?

12
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,120
GIANCARLO: A boat! A fishing boat.
You were in the water.

13
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,440
We pulled you out.

14
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,800
BOURNE: What water?

15
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,280
GIANCARLO: You were shot. See?
There are the bullets.

16
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,880
GIANCARLO: Look, there is a number
for a bank. Why was it in your hip?

17
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,160
BOURNE: My hip?

18
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,880
- Why was it in your hip?
- My hip.

19
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,640
Yeah, in your hip under the skin.

20
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,000
BOURNE: Oh, God.

21
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,880
BOURNE: What are you doing with me?
GIANCARLO: You need to rest.

22
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,560
Please. Lie down.

23
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,520
I'm a friend. I'm your friend.

24
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,480
My name is Giancarlo.

25
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,400
Who are you?

26
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,160
GIANCARLO: What's your name?

27
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,400
What's your name?

28
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,960
BOURNE: I don't know.

29
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,880
BOURNE: Oh, God.
GIANCARLO: Lie down.

30

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
LANGLEY, VIRGINIA

31
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,640
It's been confirmed, sir. Mission failed.

32
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,360
BOURNE:

33
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,200
Do you know who I am?

34
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
I do not know who I am.

35
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,040
BOURNE:

36
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,480
Tell me who I am.

37
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,440
If you know who I am...

38
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,680
Please stop messing around...

39
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,720
...and tell me.

40
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,920
GIANCARLO: If you want to eat, get in there.

41
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,600
BOURNE: Based on these charts,
I think I may have been closer to the coast.

42
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,360
What is this? You tie these knots?

43
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,160
GIANCARLO: So, it starts to come back?
BOURNE: No, it doesn't.

44
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,080
The knot's like everything else.
I found the rope and I did it.

45
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,720
Same way I can read.

46
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,280
I can write. I can add, subtract.
I can make coffee.

47
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,800
BOURNE: I can shuffle cards, play chess.
GIANCARLO: Yes, it will come back.

48
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,080
No, it's not coming back, goddamn it!
That's the point!

49
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,720
I'm down here looking through this,
all this shit!

50
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,680
For two weeks I'm down here.

51
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,840
It's not working.
I don't even know what to look for.

52
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,480
You need to rest. It will come back.

53
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,080
BOURNE: What if it doesn't come back?

54
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,760
We get in there tomorrow,
I don't even have a name.

55
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,560
It's not much,
but it should get you to Switzerland.

56
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,480
Thank you.

57
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
ZURICH COPS:

58
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,440
Can't you read the signs?

59
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,480
On your feet... let's go... right now.

60
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,760
The park is closed.
There's no sleeping in the park.

61
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,320
BOURNE: All right.

62
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,640
Let's see some identification.

63
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,560
BOURNE: No, I don't...

64
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,800
Come on... your papers.

65
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,680
I don't have any papers. I lost my...

66
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,720
I've lost them... my papers... they are lost.

67
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,800
Ok... let's go... put your hands up.

68
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,720
...I just need to sleep...

69
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,960
These people have threatened my family.
My babies.

70
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,320
So I'm telling you,
when the evidence is clear...

71
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,880
...I will have a nice story
for you to read about.

72
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,040
And all my friends out there,
you will read about yourselves.

73
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,760
If you want to play this game...

74
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,040
...after I have been reasonable,
I will show you.

75
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,960
That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in Paris
the day before yesterday.

76
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,680
He was an irritation before he took power,
a problem...

77
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,240
...when he was in power,
and he's been a disaster for us in exile.

78
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,760
He's writing a book
about the Agency's history in Africa.

79
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,240
He's going to name names.

80
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,360
It's basically a shakedown.
He's demanding the Agency's help.

81
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,080
He wants us to put him back in power
in six months, or else.

82
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,640
This interview, and I'll make the tape
available to whoever wants it...

83
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,240
...he goes on to claim that he's just survived
an assassination attempt.

84
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,440
He says it's us. He says he's got proof.

85
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,160
The Director wants to know
if there's any truth...

86
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,920
...in this accusation.

87
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,960
I've already assured him there's nobody
that reckless on my senior staff.

88
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,680
ABBOTT: I was recalling a conversation
we had some time ago.

89
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,400
Talking about Treadstone.

90
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,160
I seem to remember Wombosi's name
might have come up.

91
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm not sure what we're talking about.

92
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,920
Someone tried to take him out.

93
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,840
Tried and failed.

94
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,440
Was this Treadstone?

95
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,640
You're asking me a direct question?

96
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,280
Yes.

97
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,960
I thought you were never gonna do that.

98
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,320
What happened?

99
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,600
Well, we lost the communication
with our man.

100
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,680
This was almost two weeks ago.

101
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
CONKLIN: We've worked around the clock.

102
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,000
We've been sleeping down there.
We're doing everything we can.

103
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,000
ABBOTT: And you don't let me know this?
CONKLIN: You never wanted to before.

104
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,080
You never made a mistake before.

105
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,680
GEMEINSCHAFT BANK
ZURICH SWITZERLAND

106
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,160
What can I do for you?

107
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,440
Yes, I'm here about a numbered account.

108
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,080
If you just enter your account number here,
I'll direct you to an appropriate officer.

109
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,160
My name is Jason Bourne.

110
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,520
I live in Paris.

111
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,200
I'm trying to think...

112
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,360
How long's it been since I was here last?

113
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm not sure.

114
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,160
It must be three weeks.

115
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,280
BOURNE: Yes, in Paris.

116
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,240
Do you have the number
for a Jason Bourne?

117
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,800
OPERATOR:
Yes. Would you like me to connect you?

118
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,240
BOURNE: Yes, please.

119
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,920
BOURNE:
This is 46990384.

120
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,840
Leave a message at the beep.

121
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,560
BOURNE: I'm an American.

122
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,680
Okay.

123
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,760
GUARD: Hold it.

124
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,480
MARINE 1: You've no jurisdiction here.

125
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,080
MARINE 1: Hold it there. Okay?

126
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
MARIE: No.

127
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,480
Excuse me. No.
This is not my current address, okay?

128
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,240
This was my address until two days ago,
when I started standing in line.

129
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,440
Now I lose my apartment, okay?

130
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,320
That means no address, no phone,
no money, no time.

131
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,680
- And I still have no visa!
- Miss Kreutz, please.

132
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,880
CLERK: I must ask you
to keep your voice down.

133
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,080
MARIE: Excuse me. But where's the guy
that I talked to last week?

134
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,600
Every week it's a new person.
How am I supposed to...

135
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,120
I don't know who you saw last week.

136
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,760
MARIE: Let me help you. I'm sure I have it.
Hang on.

137
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,880
CLERK:
Could I have your attention for a moment?

138
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,000
MARIE: I have it right here. Just look at it.

139
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,240
CLERK: You staged an effort to circumvent
the immigration laws of the United States.

140
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,400
MARIE: This is a student visa now.

141
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,320
It's not about a green card anymore.
It's very different.

142
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,400
CLERK: It's not a menu. You don't just...
MARIE: I brought all this proof.

143
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,920
DISPATCHER: Potential suspect...

144
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Help in assault incident.

145
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,360
You! Red bag! The red bag!

146
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,240
SECURITY CHIEF:
Stop right there! Put your hands up!

147
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,240
MAN: I'm on it.

148
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,800
SECURITY CHIEF: Move it! Now!
Now! Move!

149
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,080
Alpha Unit, take the back stairs
and work your way up. Bravo...

150
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,400
SECURITY CHIEF: Move in! Move in!

151
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,200
MARINE 1: Okay, clear!

152
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,400
SECURITY CHIEF: Suspect is...

153
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,400
BRAVO LEADER: Moving up staircase.
Proceeding to second floor.

154
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,840
SECURITY CHIEF: Alpha Unit, you're clear.

155
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,840
MARINE 2: Move! Move!

156
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,920
SECURITY CHIEF:
All Units, target may have a radio.

157
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,960
Go to Code 77. Over.

158
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,080
Code 77, copy.

159
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,600
MARINE 3: The floor! Down!

160
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,640
MARINE 4: Clear!

161
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,440
MARINE 2: Go. Move up.

162
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,680
CONKLIN: He's in Zurich now? Right now?
ZORN: Yes. It just came in.

163
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,080
- They're sure it's him?
- Yes. He went to the bank.

164
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,040
Our source at the bank, that's who called.

165
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,160
CONKLIN: Come on.

166
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,720
But he's got to assume
we're watching the bank, right?

167
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,840
CONKLIN: I don't know. Come on.

168
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,920
I mean, he cleaned out the box.
He left a gun. What does that mean?

169
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,600
I said I don't know!

170
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,960
I liked it better when I thought he was dead.

171
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,720
What are you looking at?

172
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,320
I heard you inside.

173
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,240
MARIE: What?

174
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,040
The consulate. I heard you talking.
I thought maybe we could help each other.

175
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,160
How's that?

176
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,680
BOURNE:
You need money. I need a ride out of here.

177
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,680
I'm not running a car service. Thank you.

178
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,760
I'll give you $10,000 to drive me to Paris.

179
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,640
What, do you think I'm a fool?

180
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,720
You'd be a fool not to take it.

181
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,200
MARIE: Is this a joke? Some kind of scam?
BOURNE: No, it's no scam.

182
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,240
BOURNE: I'll give you another $10,000
when we arrive.

183
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,960
MARIE: Jesus.

184
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,520
- Is that for you?
- Look. You drive, I pay. It's that simple.

185
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,920
I got enough trouble, okay?

186
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,200
BOURNE: Okay.

187
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,200
Can I have my money back?

188
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,160
CONKLIN: All right, go. Keep going.

189
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,800
CONKLIN: Go.

190
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,760
- There! Wait!
- No, it's got to be near the end.

191
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,720
Come on, folks! We caught a break here!
Let's go!

192
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,880
COMM TECH 1: Okay, I'm up.

193
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,880
COMM TECH 1: We're getting grids.
Airline, train, hotels, hospitals.

194
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,360
- Who's getting the address? The street?
- Gemensheidt.

195
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,520
RESEARCH TECH 1: Here we go.
I think I got it.

196
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,880
ZORN: Is it him?

197
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,520
RESEARCH TECH 2: Unreal.

198
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,480
RESEARCH TECH 1: This is 38 minutes ago.

199
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,960
ZORN: Zurich police are looking
for an American carrying a red bank bag.

200
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,720
ZORN: He just tore up the embassy and
put two cops in the hospital last night.

201
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Get everybody up. Do it now.
I want them all activated.

202
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,680
Wait. All of them? At the same time?

203
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,240
You heard me.
I want Bourne in a body bag by sundown.

204
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,040
CONKLIN: All right, let's get a map up here!
Come on, folks! Let's work it!

205
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,160
COMM TECH 1:
The grids are getting updated.

206
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,000
MARIE: Which was fine with me
because I was ready.

207
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,960
After six months in Amsterdam,
you're not sure...

208
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,560
...if you've been there 20 minutes or years,
you know.

209
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,680
So I went. I took all the money I had.
I went in with friends...

210
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,960
...we took over this really cool surf shop
outside Biarritz, right by the water.

211
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,520
It was amazing.

212
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,240
It was just amazing for about three months,
until it turned out that this...

213
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,680
...jerk who had fronted us the lease
was actually shining everyone on and...

214
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,320
And what?

215
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,920
What do you mean "what"? Listen to me.

216
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,480
I've been speed-talking
for about 60 kilometres now.

217
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,680
I talk when I'm nervous.
I mean, I talk like this when I'm nervous.

218
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,080
- I'm gonna shut up now.
- No, don't do that.

219
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,040
I haven't talked to anybody in a while.

220
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,240
Yeah, but we're not talking. I'm talking.

221
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,440
You've said,
like, 10 words since we left Zurich.

222
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,080
Well, listening to you, it's relaxing.

223
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,840
I haven't slept in a while and...

224
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,360
And I've had this headache.

225
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,760
It's like a constant thing in my head...

226
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,000
...and it's just starting
to move to the background...

227
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,520
...so keep going.

228
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,000
Really, if you want, please keep talking.

229
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,840
Okay.

230
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,480
What kind of music do you like?

231
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,320
What do you like? Come on.

232
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,880
- You know what? Never mind.
- No, it's fine. Tell me.

233
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,600
What do you want to listen to?

234
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,680
I don't know.

235
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,760
Come on, it's not that hard.
What do you like? Tell me.

236
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,240
I don't know.

237
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,880
Who pays $20,000 for a ride to Paris?

238
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,760
Fuck it.

239
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,040
I can't remember anything
that happened before two weeks ago.

240
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,080
- Lucky you.
- No, I'm serious.

241
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,960
I don't know who I am.
I don't know where I'm going.

242
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,400
None of it.

243
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,560
MARIE: What? Like amnesia?
BOURNE: Yes.

244
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,320
MARIE: Amnesia.
BOURNE: Yes.

245
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,360
Right.

246
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,520
- And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
- That's the only angle.

247
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,840
What do they have of the streets?
Or, you know, the area?

248
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,120
They must have something.

249
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,400
Hang on.

250
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,920
What is he doing?

251
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,800
Is it a game? Is he warning us?
Is it a threat?

252
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,520
RESEARCH TECH 1: Sir? Look at this.

253
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,960
- What's that?
- It's an angle of the street, a sort of alley.

254
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,600
Just enhance it.

255
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,480
Now, who the hell is that?

256
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,840
RESEARCH TECH 2: Marie Helena Kreutz.

257
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,360
She's 26, born outside Hanover.
Her father was a welder.

258
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,880
He died in '87.

259
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,560
We still don't have the mother.
The grandmother, she's still in Hanover.

260
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,000
It looks like she's the anchor
for this little domestic disaster.

261
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,600
And there's a stepbrother.

262
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,640
It's tough. The girl's a gypsy.

263
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,080
I mean, she pops up on the grid
here and there, but it's chaotic at best.

264
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,520
She paid some electric bills in Spain, '95.

265
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,520
Had a phone in her name
for three months in Belgium, '96.

266
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
No taxes, no credit.

267
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,920
I don't like her. I want to go deep.

268
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,400
Get a phone log for Granny
and the half-brother.

269
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,440
Anybody we can cross-file.

270
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,640
I want to know every place she's slept
in the past six years.

271
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,280
Have Paris get these out in the field.

272
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,400
TREADSTONE SAFE HOUSE
PARIS, FRANCE

273
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,040
BOURNE: I'm not making this up.

274
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,680
These are real.

275
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
Okay.

276
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,200
Who has a safety deposit box full of...

277
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,640
...money and six passports and a gun?

278
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,920
BOURNE: Who has a bank account number
in their hip?

279
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,240
I come in here, and the first thing I'm doing
is I'm catching the sightlines...

280
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,520
...and looking for an exit.

281
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,760
I see the exit sign, too. I'm not worried.

282
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,280
MARIE: I mean, you were shot.

283
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,920
People do all kinds of weird
and amazing stuff when they are scared.

284
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,560
I can tell you the license plate numbers
of all six cars outside.

285
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,240
I know that our waitress is left-handed...

286
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,440
...and the guy sitting at the counter weighs
215 pounds and can handle himself.

287
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,120
I know the best place to look for a gun
is the cab of the grey truck outside.

288
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,440
At this altitude, I can run flat out for
a half-mile before my hands start shaking.

289
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,400
Now why would I know that?

290
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,920
How can I know that
and not know who I am?

291
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,960
Hey.

292
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,560
BOURNE: I slept.

293
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,200
- I can't believe it.
- Yeah, well, you were tired.

294
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,560
I haven't slept.

295
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,720
Oh, here. For $20,000,
I like to throw in breakfast.

296
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,440
Did you stop for gas?

297
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,200
You were pretty out of it.

298
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,480
So, do you think there's,
like, a family waiting for you?

299
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,600
I don't know.

300
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,960
I've thought about it.

301
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,920
MARIE: Is that it?

302
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,280
104.

303
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,840
Yeah, that's the address.
No, keep going. Keep going.

304
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,400
- Okay. Where?
- Just take a left. Pull in over here.

305
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,760
MARIE: Okay.

306
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,520
MARIE: So, this is it, right?

307
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,040
Yeah, I guess.

308
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,480
God, I don't recognise any of this.

309
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,360
Okay. I should go.

310
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,640
Jason?

311
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,800
Oh, God. The money. Right.

312
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,480
Yeah.

313
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,280
BOURNE: Here.

314
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,120
Thank you. Okay.

315
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,760
Thanks for the ride.

316
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,560
Anytime.

317
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,800
Well, you could come up.
I mean, or you can wait here.

318
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,520
- I can go check it out. But you could wait.
- Oh, no, no.

319
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,080
BOURNE: You could wait.

320
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,920
With you, you would probably
just forget about me if I stayed here.

321
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,600
How could I forget about you?

322
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,200
You're the only person I know.

323
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,040
Yeah. That's true.

324
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,480
I guess you're not home.

325
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,560
Monsieur Bourne, there you are.

326
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,160
CONCIERGE:

327
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,080
Monsieur Bourne, I was wondering...
I haven't seen you.

328
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,440
Uh, here I am.

329
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,600
BOURNE:

330
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,120
I think I forgot my key.

331
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,640
Hello?

332
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,520
MARIE: Are you sure this is all yours?

333
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,240
BOURNE: I guess.

334
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,560
BOURNE: This is my kitchen.

335
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,880
MARIE: Any clues?

336
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,680
BOURNE:
I think I'm in the shipping business.

337
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,920
So it's all coming back?

338
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,040
Do you mind if I use the bathroom?

339
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,680
Sure.

340
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,840
Okay.

341
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,240
Yeah. Hello? Hello?

342
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,560
OPERATOR: Yes, sir, Hotel Regina, Paris.
How may I direct your call?

343
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,000
BOURNE: Yeah, you're in Paris?
OPERATOR: Yes, sir.

344
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,360
I'm looking for a guest there.

345
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,200
A Jason Bourne.

346
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,400
OPERATOR: One moment, please.
BOURNE: Thank you.

347
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,280
OPERATOR: I'm afraid I have no one
by that name registered.

348
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,920
Okay. Thank you.

349
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,680
Wait! No, no. Are you there? Hello?

350
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
OPERATOR: Sir?

351
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,440
BOURNE: Can you check
another name for me, please?

352
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,640
Here, bear with me one second.

353
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,080
BOURNE: John Kane. Kane with a "K."
OPERATOR: One moment, sir.

354
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,440
Thank you.

355
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,280
MANAGER: You call about Monsieur Kane?
John Michael Kane?

356
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,160
BOURNE: Yeah, that's right.

357
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,160
MANAGER: You are a friend of his?
BOURNE: Yeah.

358
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,880
MANAGER:
I have some very bad news for you, sir.

359
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,240
I'm sorry to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane
has passed away almost two weeks ago.

360
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,280
There was an accident. On the motorway.

361
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,720
Apparently, he was killed instantly.

362
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,640
Really, I'm terribly sorry
to be the one to tell you this.

363
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,880
When they came for his things,
it was made known for us, you see?

364
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,240
BOURNE: Who came?

365
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,720
MANAGER: His brother.

366
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,680
Did his brother leave a number
or a way to get in touch with him?

367
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,200
MANAGER: I think not.

368
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,040
No, I'm sorry.

369
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,160
MARIE: Jason? There's no hot water.

370
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,720
It's freezing.

371
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,280
I'll go try the water in the kitchen.

372
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,440
Why don't you just stay in the bathroom?
I'll see if I can get it hot.

373
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,840
Yeah, it's really cold in here, too.

374
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,440
MARIE: The water is still cold.

375
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,160
Yeah, it's cold in the kitchen, too.
I got it running, though.

376
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,600
So...

377
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,320
What?

378
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,560
Nothing.

379
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,840
Are you okay?

380
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,120
Yeah.

381
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,200
MARIE: What is it?

382
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,440
Something wrong?

383
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,680
MARIE: Jason!

384
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,320
BOURNE: Open that. Tell me what's inside.

385
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,800
Who are you?

386
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,720
Who are you?

387
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,920
Who are you?

388
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,640
MARIE: Oh, my God.

389
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,480
God.

390
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,760
BOURNE: Answer me! Who are you?

391
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,880
- He's got my picture!
- All right. Hang on.

392
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,200
MARIE: This is Zurich, yesterday!
BOURNE: Don't...

393
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,920
I don't know. Where did you get this?

394
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,480
BOURNE: Stay there.
MARIE: How did you get my picture?

395
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,520
MARIE: Where did you get this from?

396
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,680
How did you get my... My God!

397
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,440
I'll do this! You stay there. Stay there!

398
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,200
- Where are your shoes? Get your shoes.
- Sure. Yeah, sure.

399
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,880
He went out the window.
Why would someone do that?

400
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,280
BOURNE: We can't stay here. It's not safe.

401
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,920
I can get us out of here, but we got to go.
We got to go right now.

402
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,080
Okay, look, you can wait.

403
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,520
You can wait for the cops. It's okay.

404
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,960
You just wait for them to get here.
But I can't. I got to go.

405
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,960
Marie?

406
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,160
BOURNE: Marie?

407
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,960
BOURNE: Quiet. Be quiet.

408
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,960
Don't look.

409
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,280
OPERATIVE: Code in.

410
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,720
NICKY: Alpha 37509.

411
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,120
ZORN: Yeah.

412
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,000
Hang on.

413
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,920
Bourne went to Paris, to the apartment.

414
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,400
CONKLIN: We got him? Tell me.
NICKY: He killed our man.

415
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,240
CONKLIN: What? In the apartment?
NICKY: Yeah.

416
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,880
CONKLIN: Well, you got to clean that up.
NICKY: No, I can't clean it up.

417
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,920
NICKY: There's a body in the street.
CONKLIN: So?

418
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,720
There's police. This is Paris.

419
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,760
CONKLIN: Put up the scanners.
Get as much radio information as you can.

420
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,320
Okay, you stay here.

421
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,720
I'm gonna go find a place for this money.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

422
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,000
BOURNE: Hey, I told you to stay in the car.

423
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,040
Jesus Christ. I told you to stay in the car.

424
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,520
I needed a drink.
I didn't think you would come back.

425
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,720
Look, you got to go to the cops.

426
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,960
Right now.
You got to go before this gets any worse.

427
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,960
MARIE: By myself?
BOURNE: It's gonna be okay.

428
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,840
You're gonna take my passport, okay?
You show this to them.

429
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
You have that picture, you have the $20,000.

430
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,800
You tell them everything that happened.
They'll believe you.

431
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,440
They have to believe you.

432
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,080
Marie, you can't just sit here.
It's not safe here.

433
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,720
MARIE: Safe?
This is from inside the embassy.

434
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,640
- Who can do this? This is from yesterday.
- I don't know.

435
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,560
MARIE: How can they know we're together?
BOURNE: I'm trying to do the right thing.

436
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,120
BOURNE: That's all.
MARIE: Right?

437
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,560
How'll you make this right
by sending me there alone?

438
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,760
You think I want you to go to the cops?
That's good?

439
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,680
- You want to go, fine.
- If you go, I run!

440
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,240
- You tell them what happened!
- I don't know what happened!

441
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,560
I don't know who this guy was
or about that picture!

442
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,440
I don't know who I am!

443
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,320
Look, I'm...

444
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,560
You think I'm trying to burn you.
I'm trying to do the right thing.

445
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,480
Nobody does the right thing.

446
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,120
Look, I can't run with you. I can't.

447
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,440
We run, I got to live like this. I got to...
I don't even know who I'm hiding from.

448
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,400
These people know who I am.

449
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,760
Yeah, I got to stay here.
I got to figure this out.

450
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,520
So figure it out.

451
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,880
You take care of this car?

452
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,200
What do you mean?

453
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,960
The tires felt a little splashy
on the way over here.

454
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,480
MARIE: It pulls a little to the right.

455
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,680
Last chance, Marie.

456
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,880
BOURNE: So...

457
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,880
MARIE: What?
BOURNE: We got a bump coming up.

458
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,440
Turn your head away. Turn your head away.

459
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,240
We can never come back to this car.

460
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,160
You understand?

461
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,440
Okay, we're gonna clean it out,
and I'll wipe it down, and we walk away.

462
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,080
- That's it.
- Okay.

463
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,760
Okay. And I'll find a place for us to rest.
And I got to think.

464
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,960
Do you have a hat or a scarf or something?

465
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,400
- For my hair?
- Yeah. Just until we can change it.

466
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,960
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

467
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,160
Okay.

468
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,840
HOFFENMEIN MORGUE - PARIS, FRANCE

469
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,200
It's not him.

470
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,960
This man was not shot.

471
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,000
CONKLIN: What do you have?

472
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,320
NICKY: Wombosi went to the morgue.

473
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,320
He saw the body. He didn't buy it.

474
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,280
Where is he now?

475
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,680
NICKY: I told you, I'm not staffed for this.

476
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,920
CONKLIN: Where is he? Right now!
Where's Wombosi?

477
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,280
NICKY: They were leaving the morgue.

478
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,160
They just left.

479
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,400
ZORN: Sir, what do you want to do?

480
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,400
I need to get the bottle.

481
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,280
BOURNE: Hey.

482
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,400
You already cleaned the room?

483
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,040
I wiped the whole place down
for fingerprints.

484
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,880
Can I walk around
or is it gonna leave any footprints?

485
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,240
You can walk around. It's no problem.

486
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,240
But we'll just keep track
of everything we touch.

487
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,880
I think it's best if we leave a room,
that we don't leave a trail.

488
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,440
Why? Where are we going?

489
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,320
BOURNE: I need to go to the hotel
where John Michael Kane stayed.

490
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,880
The Hotel Regina.

491
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,200
If I was him,
then they're gonna have some records.

492
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,320
We need that hotel bill.

493
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,400
MARIE: Okay.

494
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,320
It gets slightly complicated, though.

495
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,880
Because you're dead.

496
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,840
BOURNE: Right.

497
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,320
BODYGUARD: Please.
WOMBOSl: They want war, we'll make war.

498
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,720
If they want to kill me,
they better kill me the first time.

499
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,120
They better kill me dead.
They better kill me when I'm in my sleep.

500
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,440
BODYGUARD: Listen to me.
We need these people.

501
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,120
It's hard enough getting people
that we know to help us.

502
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,560
BODYGUARD: We must be careful.

503
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,680
We?

504
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,280
No, you.

505
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,080
You need to bring me back
that bastard kid's head...

506
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,560
...put it in front of this house,
and show them the war we're fighting.

507
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,920
But that is precisely...

508
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,600
BODYGUARD: Nykwana!

509
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:31,560
BOURNE: We'll give the watch
a reference check before we go.

510
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,440
MARIE: Okay.

511
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,800
What's the pay phone number?

512
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,440
MARIE: 616-2468.

513
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,680
Exits?

514
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,040
There's three.

515
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,240
Service at the back,
side goes to the street past the shops...

516
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,200
...front is the best.

517
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,160
If I think I'm being followed, I walk out
with the bag over my right shoulder.

518
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,680
And if there's no taxi?

519
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,280
I keep on walking,
don't look back until you make contact.

520
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,400
MARIE: What?

521
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,200
We need this, right?

522
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,000
Okay.

523
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,160
BOURNE: I need distances.

524
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,440
You walk in, you pick a spot.
Some midpoint in the lobby.

525
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,880
Count your steps to that spot,
and then remember that number.

526
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,360
Because after I call you,
I can get you moving.

527
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,880
You understand?

528
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,800
I also need a head count.

529
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,720
How many people from when you walk in
until you get to the desk.

530
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,560
How many hotel employees are there?
And obviously security.

531
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,800
And it might not be that easy
to see who they are.

532
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,360
So I'll call you, you give me the layout,
and we'll take it from there.

533
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,800
OPERATOR: Regina.

534
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,880
Yes, the house phone in the lobby.

535
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,160
BOURNE: What happened?
MARIE: L...

536
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,160
BOURNE: Did something go wrong?
MARIE: I've got the records.

537
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,360
He, this guy at the front desk
was smiling at me.

538
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,120
So I thought, you know, all this trouble,
maybe it's easier to just ask for them.

539
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,080
BOURNE: You have the bill?
MARIE: He made me a photocopy.

540
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,320
You just asked for it?

541
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,520
I said I was Mr. Kane's personal assistant.

542
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,280
BOURNE: Okay. That's good thinking.

543
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,240
ZORN: Sir, can l...
ABBOTT: No.

544
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,320
ABBOTT: Wombosi was assassinated
in his house in the middle of Paris.

545
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,000
Yeah, we just heard.

546
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,520
It's him. It's Bourne. We're almost positive.

547
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,840
He had an assignment. He failed.

548
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,840
He obviously felt compelled
to finish the task.

549
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,760
ABBOTT: Jesus.

550
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,800
CONKLIN: We think he'll come back in now.

551
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,800
I mean, it's routine.

552
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,640
It's like behavioural software.

553
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,280
He's following a protocol.

554
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,520
Now that he's completed the mission,
we think he'll come back in.

555
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,760
They always do.

556
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,680
When?

557
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,960
ABBOTT: How long till he checks in?

558
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,760
ZORN: 24 hours.
ABBOTT: 24?

559
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,840
Yeah, it's usually something like that.

560
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,880
ABBOTT: Then what?

561
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,000
I told you we'd clean this up.

562
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,680
It will be clean.

563
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:55,240
BOURNE: I understand you're a dive shop,
but where are you located?

564
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,040
BOURNE: Marseilles?

565
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,600
BOURNE: What specifically does
your company supply?

566
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,720
DIVE SHOP EMPLOYEE: I am sorry.
What is your name, monsieur?

567
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,400
COP:

568
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,840
You've been here for three hours
and you still can't find a print?

569
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,880
CONKLIN: What?
ZORN: Paris police found the vehicle.

570
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,640
RAWLINS: You've reached Simon Rawlins
at Alliance Security, Maritime Division.

571
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,280
Paris office hours are
from 8.00 a. M. To 5.00 p. M.

572
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,480
BOURNE: I got a lead in Paris.

573
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,760
The rest were Marseilles,
and two out in Southampton.

574
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,160
- Paris? It's what?
- Alliance Security. Simon Rawlins.

575
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,360
I got a machine.

576
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,920
SECRETARY: Mr. Kane?

577
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,360
Mr. Kane!

578
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:51,160
SECRETARY: How are you?
BOURNE: I'm good. How are you?

579
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,040
Mr. Kane. Come right in.
Please have a seat.

580
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,440
Thank you.

581
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,520
RAWLINS:
So, this is the PalmerJohnson tri-deck.

582
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,960
I'm assuming you're still in the market.
It's still the same vessel?

583
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,800
Yes.

584
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,800
So I'm Kane.

585
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,640
MARIE: They...
BOURNE: I had a meeting as Kane.

586
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,400
- They said...
- No. I'm definitely Kane.

587
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,000
I just had a meeting as Kane
and he knew me as Kane.

588
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:42,360
So I'm definitely Bourne.
I'm also just definitely Kane.

589
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:43,440
It's all just boats.

590
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,600
I got blueprints and cameras
and security systems.

591
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,720
I just found John Michael Kane's body.

592
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,360
In a morgue here in Paris.

593
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:54,960
But if you are John Michael Kane,
whose body do they have?

594
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,280
ATTENDANT: What was the name again?
BOURNE: Kane.

595
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,400
Kane.

596
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,760
BOURNE: John Michael Kane.

597
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,480
John Michael Kane.

598
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,880
Kane. It's number 121.

599
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,600
I want to see the body.

600
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,840
Our boss could come back.
We are not supposed to do that.

601
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,920
Come on.

602
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,360
Is this it? I mean, where is he?

603
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,000
ATTENDANT: I don't know.

604
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,320
What's going on?

605
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,800
This guy has come to see the American.
But the body has disappeared.

606
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,800
They came yesterday evening... his brother.

607
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,280
He's not in the register.

608
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,000
Who are you? What's going on?

609
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,080
- Where's the body that goes in here?
- I said someone came last night.

610
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,720
I know. Where'd they take the body?

611
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,920
Look, this is not a carnival, okay?

612
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,680
People call, they make an appointment,
follow the rules.

613
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,840
Everyone signs in and out.
This is a serious place. Serious work.

614
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:10,680
- It's not just to come in whenever you like!
- You're right. We didn't sign in.

615
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,880
BOSS: Get the hell out of here.

616
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,640
BOURNE: Fine. I'm just gonna go sign in.
BOSS: Okay, go.

617
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,040
BOURNE: Is this it?

618
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,400
BOSS: You can't take the book.
BOURNE: This is it?

619
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,880
It's okay. There's a pencil in here.
That's fine.

620
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,800
Honey, why don't you go wait outside?
Here it is.

621
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,160
BOSS: We can't have...
BOURNE: Okay.

622
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:33,520
MARIE: Jason, what just happened in there?
What are you looking for?

623
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,200
BOURNE: Nykwana Wombosi.

624
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,160
Wombosi went to the morgue to visit Kane.

625
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,200
See?

626
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,640
MARIE: So?
BOURNE: He's in the Alliance brochure.

627
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,920
BOURNE: Same guy.

628
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,560
This guy knows.

629
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,960
My French sucks. I can't...
It says something about a boat or...

630
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:27,840
I don't understand. What does it say?
You read it. Tell me. What?

631
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:33,400
It says that 3 weeks before he was killed,
Mr. Wombosi told police...

632
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:37,320
...that a man came onto his yacht,
five miles off the coast of Marseilles...

633
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,360
...and tried to kill him.

634
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,440
It says that he chased the man off the boat
and shot him twice in the back.

635
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,440
It says I'm an assassin.

636
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,120
Stop the car.

637
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,840
But no... you said Rue de I...
we're almost there.

638
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,560
Just right here, this is good.

639
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,840
I said stop.

640
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,680
MARIE: What's going on?

641
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,640
Well... what's going on?

642
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,320
MARIE: What the hell are you doing?

643
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,840
BOURNE: Go. Go.
MARIE: What are...

644
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,240
You gave me too much.

645
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,560
BOURNE: We're blown. Come on.
MARIE: Blown? What is "blown"?

646
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,640
Monsieur... your change, your change.

647
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,360
Sir, please... You can't stay here...
You have to leave.

648
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,240
BOURNE: Keep walking.

649
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,560
What do you think they're doing there?
They're on to the hotel.

650
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,360
- No. You don't know that.
- Trust me. Just keep walking.

651
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,840
Are you crazy? What are you doing now?

652
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,560
MARIE: Jason!

653
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,520
BOURNE: This is blown.

654
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,680
BOURNE: Marie?
MARIE: Get away.

655
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,880
BOURNE: Stop right there.
MARIE: Get away from me.

656
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,680
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

657
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,040
BOURNE: Marie.
MARIE: Is that next?

658
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,160
Listen, stay calm. Stay calm.

659
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,560
Whatever we do, we have to do it together.

660
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,920
- We have to be...
- We?

661
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,320
The only thing we had in common
was that neither of us knew who you were.

662
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,240
MARIE: We've passed that now.
BOURNE: Listen!

663
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,600
The police'll find us. The people who took
the picture in the embassy...

664
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,520
...who killed Wombosi,
they're gonna come here and kill us.

665
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,040
The people who you work for.

666
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,040
I will take you wherever you need to go.
I'll take you there. I'll leave you there.

667
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,560
You can do what you want.
You never have to see me again.

668
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,080
BOURNE: But not here.
If we stay here, we die.

669
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,600
Boy, great police work! Really brilliant!

670
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,400
Why don't they just hang out a banner
that says, "Don't come back!"

671
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:30,280
Jesus Christ!
What is the French word for "stakeout"?

672
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,640
CONKLIN: Okay, this was 16 minutes ago.

673
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,640
This is our starting point.

674
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,240
CONKLIN: Can't fly, trains are risky. Nicky?
NICKY: Here.

675
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,640
I need to know everything
Paris's finest is doing on this.

676
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,840
NICKY: I'm on it.

677
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,600
ABBOTT:
You said 24 hours, and he's not back.

678
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,840
CONKLIN:
No. But we got a good idea where he is.

679
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,240
ABBOTT: You've got a black ops agent
who's off the reservation.

680
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,040
He trashed an American consulate.
He's on the run in Europe.

681
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,040
You don't know why. I got to stand
before an oversight committee.

682
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,760
What will I say about Treadstone?

683
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,000
You're worried about a budget meeting?

684
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:15,280
We don't take care of this,
we don't make it to the men's room.

685
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,400
Now, is that clear enough for you?

686
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,320
We will burn for this.

687
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,000
We will both of us burn.

688
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:28,080
CONKLIN: All right, I want two teams.
Daryl, Ray, stay on the grids.

689
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,360
Brian, Harris, Steve...

690
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,320
...I want to work on this girl.

691
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,440
CONKLIN: And this residency pattern?
COMM TECH 1: We started it.

692
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:36,360
Get it out.

693
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,520
COMM TECH 1: We cross-referenced
numbers from her relatives.

694
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,680
When we found convergence,
we took the numbers...

695
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,760
...back-checked them, ran a search merge
with other data we had, which wasn't much.

696
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,160
Pins. These pins.

697
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,520
These are all the places we think she's lived
in the last six years.

698
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,680
CONKLIN: One, two, three, four, five.

699
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,440
That's our pool.

700
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,160
MARIE: No answer.

701
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,560
How many times you let it ring?

702
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,240
- Look, if you don't want to go, I'll hitch.
- I said I'd take you.

703
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,080
CONKLIN: Those are the targets.

704
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,960
Beg, borrow, hack, tap, bypass!
I don't care what you do!

705
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:25,760
I want to know everything you can tell me
about what's going on at those locations.

706
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,200
BOURNE: How do you know
he still owns this?

707
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,720
MARIE: Eamon always had money.
He would never sell this.

708
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,600
Marie?

709
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,760
MARIE: What?

710
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,000
We got to go.

711
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,720
What?

712
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,400
We got to go.

713
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,240
I thought it would...

714
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:40,440
MARIE: Shit, that's Eamon. I'll talk to him.
BOURNE: We're leaving.

715
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,400
Eamon. Surprise.

716
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,640
It's me, Marie. Wow, God...

717
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,480
...there's a really good reason for this.

718
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,200
EAMON: There bloody well better be.

719
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,800
CLAUDIA: Daddy!
EAMON: Hang on. Hang on.

720
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,440
I had no idea you would be here.

721
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,600
Well, why would I be here?
It's only my bloody house, right?

722
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,440
MARIE: Yeah.

723
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,320
Did she get you into this?

724
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,640
It was just gonna be for a day.

725
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,200
Daddy, Alain has to go pee!

726
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,920
All right, all right, come on. Here.
Get out of the car.

727
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,840
Okay, in you go.

728
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,560
EAMON: Come on, Alain.

729
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,000
MARIE: I'm sorry. I...

730
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,720
I thought it would be okay.
But I guess I was wrong.

731
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,280
- Let's find Mummy.
- Mummy?

732
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,640
Mummy is away for two days, thank God.

733
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,400
BOURNE:
You've got yourself all tied up here.

734
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,880
BOURNE: Okay.

735
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,280
What's he do for a living?

736
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,960
He used to be in shipping.

737
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,360
Is he good for you?

738
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,080
Are you happy?

739
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,560
You know me. I try too hard.

740
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,760
Here you go.

741
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,920
Sleep well.

742
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,320
Good night.

743
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,840
BOURNE: I'll sleep on the floor.

744
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:37,080
CONKLIN: This was when?
RESEARCH TECH 2: 11:45 a. M.

745
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,840
Which is definitely within
the driving range of Paris.

746
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,280
RESEARCH TECH 1:
The call came from a rest stop.

747
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,120
CONKLIN: Yeah. What's this yellow pin?

748
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,960
She spent two months there in 1997.

749
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,800
Closest town is Riom.

750
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,240
We took her family's phone records
and collated the international calls.

751
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,080
They were in Paris at 2.00 a. M.

752
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:59,000
They can't fly. The train's too dangerous.

753
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,720
He knows better than to go anywhere
we might track him.

754
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:03,720
So this is our best guess.

755
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,600
- What are you doing?
- The kids. I was worried. I couldn't sleep.

756
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,640
MARIE: You'll wake them up. We got to go.

757
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,600
BOURNE:
I don't want to know who I am anymore.

758
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:10,680
I don't care. I don't want to know.

759
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,840
MARIE: Come on. We'll talk about...
BOURNE: I want to forget everything.

760
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,400
It's okay.

761
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,640
BOURNE: I don't care who I am
or what I did.

762
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:23,200
It's okay.

763
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,600
BOURNE: We have this money.

764
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,280
We can hide.

765
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,480
Can we do that?
Is there any chance you can do that?

766
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,720
MARIE: I don't know.

767
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,200
MARIE: Come on.

768
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,520
CLAUDIA: Here, boy! Here, boy!

769
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,520
'Morning.

770
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,040
EAMON: Christ. You were up early.

771
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,240
Bless you for making coffee.

772
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,520
One night. You weren't kidding.

773
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,600
For a change.

774
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,880
He's not there either.

775
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,440
EAMON: And you looked by the car?
CLAUDIA: He's not anywhere.

776
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,080
All right, let me get dressed.

777
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,560
BOURNE: Who?
EAMON: Bloody dog's gone missing.

778
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,240
Does that happen a lot?

779
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,680
What? That mutt?
Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.

780
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,520
It's always something, right?

781
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,480
Get in the basement.

782
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,840
What?

783
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,600
- Get everyone in the basement.
- What are you talking about?

784
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:47,960
You're in danger. Your family's in danger.
I don't have time to explain.

785
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,880
EAMON: Wait a minute. What...
MARIE: Eamon.

786
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,320
You should go.

787
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,920
EAMON: What have you done?
BOURNE: It's not her. It's me.

788
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,320
You need to get out of sight
and in the basement as quick as you can.

789
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,040
CLAUDIA: Daddy.

790
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,200
I'm sorry.

791
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,840
Let's go.

792
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,440
MARIE: The phone is dead.
BOURNE: Yeah.

793
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,080
Jason, who's out there? Who is it?

794
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,240
MARIE: What are you doing?

795
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,200
Oh, no.

796
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:57,240
We should never have come here.
I... These children...

797
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,680
That's not gonna happen.

798
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,240
BOURNE: Where is it? Where's the weapon?

799
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:29,680
Who else is out here?
Who else? How many you got with you?

800
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,320
BOURNE: I'm not gonna ask you again.

801
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,040
I work alone. Like you.

802
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,360
We always work alone.

803
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:41,240
BOURNE: What do you mean?
PROFESSOR: Who are you? Rome?

804
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,400
Paris?

805
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,120
Treadstone, both of us.

806
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,800
BOURNE: Treadstone?
PROFESSOR: Which one?

807
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,400
Paris. I live in Paris.

808
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,080
PROFESSOR: You get the headaches?

809
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,960
Yeah.

810
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,960
I get such bad headaches.

811
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,760
You know at night
when you're driving a car?

812
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,440
Maybe it's the headlights.

813
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,200
What is Treadstone?

814
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,120
Treadstone said pills.

815
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,680
They said go to Paris.

816
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,040
Is Treadstone in Paris?

817
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,640
Look at this.

818
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,600
Look at what they make you give.

819
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,280
EAMON: All right, all right.

820
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,200
All right, Claudia,
get in the front and put your belt on.

821
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,440
EAMON:
All right, we're gonna put you in the back.

822
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,560
All right, get in the front, Claudia.

823
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,480
EAMON: I'm not waiting, Marie.

824
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,480
- One minute, Eamon.
- I'm not waiting!

825
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:01,120
MARIE: Please!

826
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,280
Take it.

827
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,680
BOURNE: I took out $30,000.
The rest is yours.

828
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,520
MARIE: That's it?
BOURNE: That's all I got.

829
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,760
No, that's not what I meant.

830
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:17,200
This is not gonna stop, Marie.
You got to get out now. Away from me.

831
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,000
BOURNE: You got to get out.
You got to start running.

832
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,160
You get low, you stay low.

833
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,040
No more friends. Nothing familiar.

834
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:30,840
There's enough in there for you
to make a life. Any life.

835
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,240
EAMON: I'm out of here, Marie!

836
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,360
BOURNE: Hey!

837
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,280
Get in the car. You got to go.

838
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,440
What are you gonna do?

839
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:47,440
I'll end it.

840
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,400
Go ahead.

841
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,160
BOURNE: Please.

842
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:08,920
Code in, please.

843
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,080
ZORN: Code in.

844
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:16,400
Code in.

845
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,880
BOURNE: Who is this?

846
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,160
Who the hell are you?

847
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:34,360
The man you sent is dead.

848
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,720
So whoever this is, you better start talking.

849
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:39,520
CONKLIN: Hello, Jason.

850
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,720
So, what are we into now?

851
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:51,200
It only goes two ways. Either you come in
and let us make this right...

852
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,280
...or we'll keep going until we're satisfied.

853
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,080
You mean until you kill me.

854
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,440
I can't fix this
if I don't know what the problem is.

855
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,040
Tell me what we're into,
and I'll do the best I can.

856
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:12,400
Why don't you talk to Marie, Jason?

857
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:17,920
CONKLIN: Let's ask Marie what she wants.
BOURNE: I don't think she gives a shit.

858
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,320
She's dead.

859
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,320
I'm sorry to hear that.
How did that happen?

860
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,280
BOURNE: She was slowing me down.

861
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,080
CONKLIN: All we've been doing right from...
BOURNE: Enough.

862
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,120
Enough.

863
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,640
5:30 p. M. Paris.

864
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,480
Today. Pont Neuf.

865
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:45,080
Come alone,
you walk to the middle of that bridge.

866
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,320
You take off your jacket. Face east.

867
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,240
BOURNE: I'll redial this number.
CONKLIN: Wait!

868
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:03,160
First flight out. Tell Nicky I'll call
from the car. Tell her to find Picot. Go.

869
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,160
ABBOTT: So...

870
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,280
What are we gonna do?

871
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:11,680
I told you I'd clean this up.
That's what I'm doing.

872
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,360
Can you really bring him in?

873
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,040
I think we're past that, don't you?

874
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,200
Do you have a better idea?

875
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:20,880
You've given me nothing
but a trail of collateral damage...

876
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,240
...from Zurich to Paris.
I couldn't do much worse.

877
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:26,040
Why don't you go upstairs
and book a conference room?

878
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:28,400
Maybe you can talk him to death.

879
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:45,120
COP 1: The bus, the tour bus, second level.

880
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,240
COP 2: Negative on the target.

881
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,000
COP 4: Position one?
COP 2: Negative.

882
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,240
COP 4: Position two?
COP 3: Negative.

883
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,080
COP 1: Position three, motorcycle.

884
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,360
COP 3: Negative.

885
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,520
COP 5: Negative.

886
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:39,840
Jason?

887
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,680
I told you to come alone.
I guess that was too complicated.

888
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,520
BOURNE: So try this: I'm gone.

889
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:50,520
Fuck.

890
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,040
CONKLIN: Get Nicky on the phone.

891
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,040
NICKY: Yeah?

892
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,560
CONKLIN: How long to wipe down the room
and move it?

893
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:19,520
NICKY: Get rid of everything?
CONKLIN: Yeah.

894
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,840
NICKY: Two to three hours.
CONKLIN: All right, get started.

895
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:30,920
Listen, no breaks.

896
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,760
Two men outside, one in the lobby.
And keep your eyes open.

897
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,480
COP 1: Keep the truck?
CONKLIN: Keep the truck.

898
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:41,640
I'm gonna close this unit down.
We'll move the gear in the truck.

899
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:00,840
NICKY:
They were covering Spain, Malta, Morocco.

900
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:03,400
Yes, all local police radio traffic.

901
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:06,880
No, for northern Europe
we need an authorised directive. Yeah.

902
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:11,120
Okay, they're on it. We'll have
a satellite download in 30 minutes.

903
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,640
CONKLIN: Where's your field box?

904
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,760
- Where's your field box?
- It's right there.

905
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,840
NICKY: The whole system's gone haywire.

906
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,400
That's this window right here.

907
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:34,440
Dining room window?

908
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,520
I don't get it.

909
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,560
Dead. The phones are dead.

910
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:44,920
It's Bourne, isn't it?

911
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,240
Just quiet.

912
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,640
You move, you die.

913
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:35,880
CONKLIN: Bourne.

914
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:37,480
Gun down.

915
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,240
In there.

916
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,640
Okay, so what do you want...

917
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,080
BOURNE: Treadstone.

918
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,040
You better take a look around.
There's not much left.

919
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:54,480
- Are you Treadstone?
- Am I Treadstone? Me?

920
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,520
What the hell are you talking about?

921
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:58,000
He's lost it.

922
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:02,240
You better start filling in the blanks here!
'Cause I thought we were on the same side.

923
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:03,520
Whose side is that?

924
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:07,320
You don't know what you're doing, do you?
You don't have a goddamn clue!

925
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:08,880
Who am I?

926
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,000
You're U. S. Government property!

927
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:14,160
You're a malfunctioning $30 million weapon!

928
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,480
You're a total goddamn catastrophe!

929
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:19,520
And, by God, if it kills me,
you'll tell me how this happened.

930
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:22,480
- Why are you trying to kill me?
- What happened in Marseilles?

931
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,160
You sent me to kill Wombosi.

932
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:28,160
Kill Wombosi?
Yeah, we can do that any time we want.

933
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:30,520
I can send Nicky to do that,
for Christ's sake.

934
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,760
Mr. Wombosi was supposed to be dead
three weeks ago.

935
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:37,360
He was supposed to have died in a way
that the only possible explanation was...

936
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,360
...that he'd been murdered
by a member of his own entourage.

937
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:42,160
I don't send you to kill.

938
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:43,840
I send you to be invisible.

939
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:46,080
I send you because you don't exist.

940
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,480
I want to know what happened in Marseilles.

941
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,240
I don't remember what happened
in Marseilles.

942
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,880
Bullshit! This is unacceptable, soldier.

943
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:55,560
You hear me? You failed!

944
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:57,040
- Unacceptable?
- You failed!

945
01:38:57,160 --> 01:39:00,680
- You failed and you're gonna tell me why!
- I can't tell you! I don't remember!

946
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:03,720
You brought Kane to life.
You put together a meeting with Wombosi.

947
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:06,440
You found the security company.
You broke into the office!

948
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:10,160
For Christ's sake, you picked the yacht
as the goddamn strike point!

949
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:19,480
CONKLIN: You picked the boat.

950
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,880
You picked the day. You tracked the crew.

951
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,440
The food, the fuel!

952
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,160
You told us where. You told us when.

953
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,160
You hid out on that boat five days.

954
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:31,800
You were in, Jason. You were in!

955
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:33,320
It was over!

956
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:33,200
CONKLIN: No, you do remember.

957
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,400
Don't you?

958
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,480
I don't want to do this anymore.

959
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,960
I don't think that's a decision you can make.

960
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:56,200
Jason Bourne is dead. Do you hear me?

961
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,240
BOURNE: He drowned two weeks ago.

962
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,760
You're gonna go tell them Bourne is dead.
Understand?

963
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:02,280
CONKLIN: Where are you gonna go?

964
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:07,160
I swear, if I even feel somebody behind me,
there is no measure to how fast...

965
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:10,200
...and how hard I will bring this fight
to your doorstep.

966
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,160
I'm on my own side now.

967
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:39,280
It's done.

968
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,600
Shut it down.

969
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,920
ABBOTT: The Treadstone project
has already been terminated.

970
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,080
It was designed primarily
as a sort of advanced game program.

971
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:26,760
We'd hoped it might build
into a good training platform.

972
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:30,280
But quite honestly,
for a strictly theoretical exercise...

973
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:32,600
...the cost-benefit ratio was just too high.

974
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:34,680
It's all but decommissioned at this point.

975
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:36,280
MARSHALL: All right, what's next?

976
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:38,600
ABBOTT: Okay, this is...

977
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:41,320
...Blackbriar.

978
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:44,480
Blackbriar is a joint DOD
communications program...

979
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:48,480
...that we really feel has good traction to it.
It's got legs. It'll run and run.

980
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:52,240
It combines elements of proactive
and reactive fields of security...

981
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:35,920
BOURNE: This your store?

982
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,080
MARIE: Yeah.

983
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:42,440
It's nice. It's a little hard to find, but...

984
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:48,480
Think I could rent a scooter?

985
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:53,880
You have ID?

986
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,560
Not really.

987
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,280
