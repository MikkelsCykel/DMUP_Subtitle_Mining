marie:
when you are alone eternally,

2
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,555
you live for the comfort
of the senses--

3
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:05,517
food, sex.

4
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:07,019
i'd become very selective,

5
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,023
and it was getting harder
for me to find food,

6
00:03:11,523 --> 00:03:13,024
even living in the city.

7
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,944
my choosiness about food
cost me my lover,

8
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:20,782
and without him,
there is no sex.

9
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,163
for six nights,
i have found nothing to eat.

10
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:39,549
but then came good news.

11
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:02,820
i was sad.
i was starved.

12
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,823
it was time
to treat myself,

13
00:04:06,282 --> 00:04:08,283
and i thought,

14
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:11,786
"what about italian?"

15
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:35,349
don't worry
about the car.

16
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:39,352
leave the keys in case
we have to move it.

17
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:43,857
hey, lenny.
how you doing, huh?

18
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:45,901
all right.

19
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:01,372
what took you?

20
00:05:01,372 --> 00:05:05,418
i had to dress right.
i had to shave.

21
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,382
he wants you
in on this.

22
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:23,392
hey, ton, what's
this all about, huh?

23
00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:30,942
watch this.

24
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:34,402
aah!

25
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,907
aah!

26
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,411
i love that.

27
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,918
place is bugged.

28
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:54,922
we do business
downstairs.

29
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:17,942
come on.

30
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:37,460
see? we come so far down,
we're in china.

31
00:07:03,984 --> 00:07:06,987
sal, how you doing?

32
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:11,532
i was honored
by your call...

33
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,993
a little surprised.
i didn't think--

34
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:16,495
have a seat.

35
00:07:27,505 --> 00:07:31,509
so, uh, sal,
what's happening here, huh?

36
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:52,529
what's this?

37
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,033
it's a...it's a toaster.

38
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:02,037
it's a toaster oven.

39
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,543
whoa, hey.
it's a nice one.

40
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:10,545
a lot of buttons.

41
00:08:10,545 --> 00:08:12,547
hit this button...

42
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:14,549
pops open.

43
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:16,550
you could put
anything in here--

44
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,052
slice of pizza,
pastry.

45
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:21,054
you pop it in.

46
00:08:21,054 --> 00:08:22,556
comes out,

47
00:08:22,556 --> 00:08:24,057
the crust is crisp.

48
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:29,061
microwave don't do that.

49
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:34,567
you ever tried cooking
calzone in a microwave?

50
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:38,069
it comes out
like a limp dick.

51
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:49,121
yeah.

52
00:08:51,123 --> 00:08:52,124
korean.

53
00:08:55,586 --> 00:08:59,089
they're getting a big chunk
of the electronics action.

54
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,592
do you know why?

55
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:07,096
because they fucking steal.

56
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:12,100
any fucking idea
that ain't nailed down.

57
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,102
you think
some korean asshole

58
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:17,105
came up
with the toaster oven?

59
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:22,610
well, here they are,
knocking them out.

60
00:09:25,112 --> 00:09:26,614
where'd it come from?

61
00:09:27,156 --> 00:09:29,158
what, sal?

62
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:35,622
the toaster?
honestly, i don't know.

63
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:39,626
you was with leguto.

64
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:45,130
when leguto fell
off the face of the earth,

65
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,673
you became mine.

66
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:50,135
then you got this idea

67
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:53,138
because i just took over,
maybe i'm confused,

68
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:56,641
maybe i'm letting things
slip through the cracks.

69
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:59,644
no, sal,
i would never think--

70
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:02,647
where did it come from?

71
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:06,191
sal, tell me
what the answer is.

72
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:07,651
what should i say?

73
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:10,195
it came from a warehouse.

74
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:12,656
it came off a truck
from the airport!

75
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:15,658
a truck you hit
tuesday!

76
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,660
where's my end,
gilly?

77
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,662
i had to take inventory,

78
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,163
make sure you got

79
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:25,167
a complete cross section
of the merchandise.

80
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,169
i thought this was
just a sit-down.

81
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,172
yeah, but somebody
ain't getting up.

82
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,178
i got a message
for your warehouse guys.

83
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:40,180
please, god.
sallie, no.

84
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,182
the message is...

85
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,184
don't fuck with me!

86
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:45,686
sal!

87
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,688
we got eyes on us!

88
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:51,232
maybe somebody saw
this guy come in here.

89
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:54,193
what are you saying?
you telling me something?

90
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:56,195
get rid of him
discreet.

91
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:59,197
you want discreet?

92
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:00,198

he's got to do.

116
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,264
he loves it.
he's fucking sick.

117
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,225
you can't talk like that.

118
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:16,226
this is war.
we're soldiers.

119
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:18,770
we kill to protect
what's ours.

121
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:25,693
i'm good at stealing.
i'm not a shooter.

122
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:28,612
if you're not a shooter,
you're shot.

123
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:29,613
bang!

124
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:32,658
you just can't sit around
and watch anymore.

125
00:12:32,658 --> 00:12:35,661

126
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:37,119

148
00:13:20,993 --> 00:13:22,995
i'm sorry, tony.

149
00:13:25,164 --> 00:13:26,665

00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:33,671
let me help you.

153
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:36,674

up here.

154
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,678
i'm really, uh...

155
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:42,179
i'm sorry
about that.

156
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:44,181
i didn't
see you there.

157
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:48,185
marie:
he looked promising.

158
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,734
can i give you
a ride somewhere?

159
00:13:57,193 --> 00:14:00,696
maybe i could buy you
a drink--coffee, hot tea.

160
00:14:00,696 --> 00:14:02,698
you could do
with some warming up.

161
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:05,200
marie:
he felt promising.

162
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:09,204
but his eyes were...

163
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:13,708
sad, so very sad.

164
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,713
my first rule--
never play with the food.

165
00:14:23,217 --> 00:14:25,219
are you sure?

166
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:43,860
do not touch the car.

167
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,404
do not touch

00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,372

171
00:14:56,872 --> 00:14:59,916

00:15:08,383 --> 00:15:10,926

good reflexes.

178
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:45,958
i know it's a little
out of your way.

179
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,960
across the fucking
river.

180
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:53,923
all sinatra?

181
00:15:53,923 --> 00:15:56,926
hey, don't start
on sinatra.

182
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:15,443

got a great view of the city.

183
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:18,446

a great view, tony?

184
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:26,995

219
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:02,220
marie:
my second rule--

220
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,679
always finish the food.

221
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,225
that means eliminating
the feed marks

222
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:11,186
and a central nervous system
disconnect.

223
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:46,260
oh, that's o.k.

224
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,722
this one has everyone
a little spooked.

225
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:53,724
standard shotgun hit,
right?

226
00:19:53,724 --> 00:19:56,769
nah. this guy's lost
a lot of blood.

227
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:59,772
yeah, well, he had
his head blown off.

228
00:19:59,772 --> 00:20:02,774
this guy's really lost
a lot of blood.

229
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:04,234
it's not here.

230
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:07,237
decent amount of splatter,
but hardly what you'd expect.

231
00:20:09,781 --> 00:20:12,242
blood should have settled
in his ankles,

232
00:20:12,742 --> 00:20:13,742
turning them purple.

233
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:18,289
i'd say this guy's
about five quarts low.

234
00:20:24,711 --> 00:20:27,255
what in hell
are you doing out here?

235
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:29,716
i was with tony
last night.

236
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:31,718
i heard he got hit.

237
00:20:32,218 --> 00:20:35,721
any of these cops could be
in the mob's pocket.

238
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:37,723
the damn press is here!

239
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:39,183
he was a friend.

240
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:40,726
a friend?

241
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:43,103
he stood up for me.

242
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:46,022
without tony, i'd be in
a lot of trouble.

243
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:48,024
you're not
in trouble, gennaro.

244
00:20:48,024 --> 00:20:49,567
you're gone.
it's over.

245
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:50,485
what?

246
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:52,945
i'm putting you
into protection.

247
00:20:52,945 --> 00:20:53,946
morales!

248
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:55,490
you're kidding me.

249
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,950
mm-mm. you've been
under too long.

250
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:01,495
look, sinclair--

251
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:03,497
no. no.
save it, gennaro,

252
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:06,458
because i'm not listening
to you this time.

253
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,460
you are a danger
to this investigation

254
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:10,669
and to yourself.

255
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,004
i'm in
total control.

256
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:14,006
oh? coming here?

257
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,467
that cowboy stunt
last night with the van?

258
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:19,010
this asshole
was too damn close.

259
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,471
that's bullshit!
i was doing my job!

260
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:23,973
just get him
out of here!

261
00:21:25,475 --> 00:21:27,977
you cannot
pull me out now.

262
00:21:27,977 --> 00:21:30,521
it's absolutely
the wrong fucking time.

263
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:33,524
macelli will ask me
to make a hit.

264
00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:36,527
i'm going to tape it
and nail the fucker.

265
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:38,987
i've lived with them
for three years--

266
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:40,530
eating, drinking,
stealing.

267
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,990
you've been sitting
behind a desk.

268
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,494
you come here and say,
"that's it. it's over."

269
00:21:46,994 --> 00:21:49,497
it's all i fucking got.

270
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:53,041
all right. we got
your testimony, your tapes.

271
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,044
you'll get us
macelli, huh?

272
00:21:56,044 --> 00:21:57,045
come on.

273
00:21:57,045 --> 00:21:58,505
miss sinclair!

274
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:00,507
hi, guys.

275
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,564
this was the first time
my food made the front page.

276
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:21,568
hey.

277
00:22:23,027 --> 00:22:24,027
thank you.

278
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:36,497
that fucking pig.
i knew he wasn't right.

279
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:37,999
sallie,
our problem is--

280
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:40,501
the problem is,
find joey gennaro.

281
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:43,045
put two behind
his fucking ear.

282
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:45,505
don't say that in front
of your attorney.

283
00:22:45,505 --> 00:22:49,009
sinclair will come down
on you with the rico act

284
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:50,510
and freeze
your assets.

285
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:53,013
you're afraid
you won't get paid?

286
00:22:53,013 --> 00:22:54,514
that's the least
of my worries.

287
00:22:54,514 --> 00:22:56,515
i'm saying
make arrangements.

288
00:22:56,515 --> 00:22:58,517
yeah. yeah. yeah.

289
00:22:58,517 --> 00:23:00,561
what if i go
right here?

290
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:03,022
make arrangements,
that's what i'm saying!

291
00:23:03,022 --> 00:23:04,565
make arrangements!

292
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:06,025
you putz.

293
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:07,525
who's this?

294
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:09,527
little girl got lost.

295
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:12,030
i figured
i'd take her home.

296
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,033
i got my ass
on the grill,

297
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:17,534
and you can't get
your mind off pussy.

298
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:23,540
jacko, ain't that the prick
from the papers?

299
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:26,543
yeah.

300
00:23:26,543 --> 00:23:29,045
punch his fucking
lights out.

301
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:38,554
ha ha ha!

302
00:23:42,057 --> 00:23:46,061
you dress like a pimp
and talk like a goon.

303
00:23:46,061 --> 00:23:47,562
what makes you news?

304
00:23:47,562 --> 00:23:49,064
excuse me?

305
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:51,065
she's from out of town.

306
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:54,568
must be from mars
to talk like that.

307
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,116
nobody calls me pimp.
nobody calls me goon.

308
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:02,575
since i'm 16,

309
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:05,578
what people call me
is sallie the shark,

310
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:09,082
and i pick my teeth
with girls like you.

311
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:11,084
sal.

312
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,588
you're the dumbest
bitch i ever met,

313
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,590
but you got balls.

314
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,092
want a ride?
you got one.

315
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:25,596
i should have walked away,
but he annoyed me.

316
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,605
thanks, carmine.
you're wonderful.

317
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:01,671
maybe i got to
apologize.

318
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:05,633
my world's going to shit
at the speed of light.

319
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:07,634
puts me in a mood.

320
00:25:11,138 --> 00:25:13,140
call me sal.

321
00:25:15,142 --> 00:25:17,643
what do i call you?

322
00:25:18,144 --> 00:25:19,145
marie.

323
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:21,647
oui,marie...

324
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,653
let's make up over
a little late supper.

325
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:31,156
i'd love a little
late supper,

326
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,158
but it looks like

327
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:36,661
we're not exactly
alone.

328
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:40,164
tell me about it.

00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,258
well, what
do you think?

macelli's car smashed into
a gas station in shadyside.

00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:08,636
last time i laid down,
a fucker tells me i'm dead!

574
00:51:08,636 --> 00:51:11,638
some prick stuck
a thermometer in my kidney.

575
00:51:12,138 --> 00:51:13,640

00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,673

593
00:51:54,176 --> 00:51:55,678

really deep shit.

610
00:53:03,073 --> 00:53:07,077
you're the one that
blew tony silva's head off

611
00:53:07,077 --> 00:53:09,078
and took macelli out.

612
00:53:16,085 --> 00:53:20,088
i'd appreciate it
if you would drive.

613
00:53:43,109 --> 00:53:45,611
who do you work for?

614
00:53:45,611 --> 00:53:47,113
self-employed.

615
00:53:47,113 --> 00:53:49,115
you do this for fun?

616
00:53:49,115 --> 00:53:50,616
for sport?

617
00:53:52,076 --> 00:53:54,619
you do this
for the blood?

618
00:53:57,122 --> 00:53:59,624
you're a cop.
where's your cop radio?

619
00:53:59,624 --> 00:54:01,626
this isn't
my cop car.

620
00:54:01,626 --> 00:54:04,128
i wish you hadn't
jumped on it.

621
00:54:04,128 --> 00:54:06,130
sorry.

622
00:54:07,631 --> 00:54:10,134
macelli's not dead,
is he?

623
00:54:10,134 --> 00:54:12,136
why are you
after him?

624
00:54:12,136 --> 00:54:14,637
to kill him?

625
00:54:14,637 --> 00:54:17,640
why didn't you make
sure he was dead

626
00:54:18,141 --> 00:54:20,643
the first time
you killed him?

627
00:54:20,643 --> 00:54:22,645
i fucked up, o.k.?

628
00:54:22,645 --> 00:54:25,147
don't tell me
it never happened to you.

629
00:54:25,647 --> 00:54:28,150
what in hell are you?

630
00:54:53,173 --> 00:54:55,675
i'll find out
where macelli is.

631
00:54:55,675 --> 00:54:58,677
jesus, joe!

632
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:02,681
macelli's here?
he's alive?

633
00:55:03,182 --> 00:55:04,183
should i
cuff him?

634
00:55:04,683 --> 00:55:07,686
cuff her, for christ's sakes,
but be careful.

635
00:55:07,686 --> 00:55:09,687
she's fast,
and she's strong.

636
00:55:09,687 --> 00:55:12,690
she's the one
who got macelli.

637
00:55:20,197 --> 00:55:21,698
she's a goddamn freak.

638
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:24,201
she chomped macelli
in the neck

639
00:55:24,701 --> 00:55:25,702
and drained his blood.

640
00:55:26,203 --> 00:55:30,206
she blew tony's head off
to make sure he stayed dead.

641
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:36,712
look, guys, i'm aware
of how this sounds.

642
00:55:38,214 --> 00:55:39,715
flinton,
be careful. get out!

643
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,721
where'd you find her?

644
00:55:47,222 --> 00:55:48,723
at the church
outside macelli's.

645
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:50,225
she can climb--

646
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:53,727
joe, shut up and
listen to yourself.

647
00:55:53,727 --> 00:55:56,730
you got such a hard-on
for macelli,

648
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,732
you figure
whoever iced him

649
00:55:58,732 --> 00:56:01,235
had to be some blood-
sucking superbitch.

650
00:56:01,235 --> 00:56:04,237
i know this whole thing
is crazy.

651
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:06,739
how did macelli
drive the car?

652
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:08,741
as far as
i'm concerned,

653
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:10,702
the medical examiner's
a moron,

654
00:56:10,702 --> 00:56:14,246
and macelli is one
dead son of a bitch.

655
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:16,748
what happened
to your car?

656
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,250
she, uh...

657
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,252
she jumped on it.

658
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,753
ha ha! god.

659
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,256
put him
in the car, dave.

660
00:56:27,758 --> 00:56:29,760
oh, man.

661
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:31,762
you'll help me now?

662
00:56:31,762 --> 00:56:33,222
yeah, yeah.

663
00:56:33,222 --> 00:56:36,266
she's got him
eating out of her claw.

664
00:56:36,266 --> 00:56:39,269
you stay put,
or the cuffs go on.

665
00:56:41,271 --> 00:56:43,273
i mean it.

666
00:56:49,778 --> 00:56:51,280
calling me a killer?

667
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,740
the whole time,

668
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,283
he'sdriving
like a maniac!

669
00:56:54,283 --> 00:56:57,285
i mean,
look at this car!

670
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:06,794
this is unit 5-3.

671
00:57:06,794 --> 00:57:09,796
i need a home address
in shadyside

672
00:57:09,796 --> 00:57:12,257
for a mr. emmanuel bergman.

673
00:57:12,257 --> 00:57:13,800
he's an attorney.

674
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,802
this guy is a cop?

675
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:17,304
well,
he's been suffering

676
00:57:17,804 --> 00:57:20,306
from job-related
stress lately.

677
00:57:26,812 --> 00:57:28,314
it's about
7 blocks up.

678
00:57:28,814 --> 00:57:29,814
thanks.

679
00:57:29,814 --> 00:57:33,777
sir, could you let me
powder my nose?

680
00:57:33,777 --> 00:57:36,321
oh, yeah. sure!
absolutely.

681
00:57:36,321 --> 00:57:37,739
go ahead.

682
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:39,491
i am dracula.

683
00:57:39,491 --> 00:57:40,950
oh...

684
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:43,494
it's really
good to see you.

685
00:57:43,494 --> 00:57:46,997
i don't know
what happened
to the driver

686
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:49,458
and my luggage
and...

687
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:50,459
well...

688
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:52,460
and with all this,
i...

689
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:55,463
i thought i was
in the wrong place.

690
00:57:55,463 --> 00:57:57,465
i bid you welcome.

691
00:58:04,471 --> 00:58:07,516
listen to them.

692
00:58:07,516 --> 00:58:10,519
children of the night.

693
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:13,521
what music they make!

694
00:58:16,524 --> 00:58:18,985
i swear on my mother,
he was dead,

695
00:58:19,527 --> 00:58:21,529
and this ain't
no improvement.

696
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:25,031
dracula: a spider
spinning his web

697
00:58:25,031 --> 00:58:27,033
for the unwary fly.

698
00:58:27,492 --> 00:58:32,038
blood is the light,
mr. renfield.

699
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:38,502
gennaro.

700
00:58:39,044 --> 00:58:41,046
what about
gennaro, sal?

701
00:58:41,046 --> 00:58:43,507
he's here.

702
00:58:43,507 --> 00:58:45,009
what do you mean,
sal?

703
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:47,010
they probably
stashed that prick

704
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:49,012
in an underground
bunker somewhere.

705
00:58:49,012 --> 00:58:50,555
dracula:
you'll like it.

706
00:58:51,014 --> 00:58:52,557
renfield:
aren't you drinking?

707
00:58:52,557 --> 00:58:54,559
dracula:
i never drink...

708
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:55,560
wine.

709
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,561
hey, sal,
wait a minute.

710
00:58:57,561 --> 00:58:59,563
no, sallie!
don't, sallie!

711
00:58:59,563 --> 00:59:01,565
no, sallie!
no, sallie, don't!

712
00:59:01,565 --> 00:59:04,026
the boys will
check it out!

713
00:59:05,527 --> 00:59:07,528
jesus christ!

714
00:59:13,534 --> 00:59:15,077
everything all right?

715
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:18,538
stevie, uh...

716
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,082
gennaro split.

717
00:59:25,045 --> 00:59:26,588
fuck!

718
00:59:39,974 --> 00:59:41,434
i don't need this.

719
00:59:45,897 --> 00:59:47,398
mmm.

720
00:59:52,903 --> 00:59:55,906
sal! sal!
sal! oh, my god!

721
00:59:55,906 --> 00:59:57,908
don't, sal!
don't kill him here!

722
00:59:58,367 --> 00:59:59,368
boys, boys, help!

723
00:59:59,368 --> 01:00:01,370
help!

724
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:04,372
sal, listen to me.
you're losing it.

725
01:00:04,372 --> 01:00:07,416
don't murder a cop
on my lawn! sal!

726
01:00:19,886 --> 01:00:20,887
forgive me, sal.

727
01:00:21,429 --> 01:00:23,889
you've got to get
ahold of yourself.

728
01:00:24,431 --> 01:00:25,933
come on.

729
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:27,434
come inside.

730
01:00:27,434 --> 01:00:28,435
please.

731
01:00:30,437 --> 01:00:33,399
can you believe
this cocksucker?

732
01:00:34,941 --> 01:00:36,943
show up here, huh?

733
01:00:37,944 --> 01:00:39,404
where's the gun?

734
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,951
oh, he's got cuffs!

735
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,953
let's cuff him.

736
01:00:57,712 --> 01:00:59,213
you see, sal?

737
01:00:59,213 --> 01:01:01,215
now that you're inside,

738
01:01:01,215 --> 01:01:03,217
you're in
an excellent situation.

739
01:01:04,677 --> 01:01:06,220
no blood.

740
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,221
even if the cops came

741
01:01:08,221 --> 01:01:11,224
with a search warrant
to talk to macelli,

742
01:01:11,224 --> 01:01:13,685
i'd tell them to get
a ouija board

743
01:01:13,685 --> 01:01:15,228
because he's dead.

744
01:01:15,228 --> 01:01:17,730
there's nothing in
the fucking constitution

745
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:20,232
clearer than freedom from
unreasonable searches,

746
01:01:20,232 --> 01:01:23,193
and this isn't unreasonable,
it's demented.

747
01:01:23,193 --> 01:01:25,738
the government can't
pronounce a man dead

748
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:29,198
then invade his home
looking for him.

749
01:01:29,198 --> 01:01:31,159
you really
whacked me,

750
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:33,620
but there ain't
no blood.

751
01:01:36,664 --> 01:01:39,583
what a guy, manny.

752
01:01:40,584 --> 01:01:42,085
hey, sallie!

753
01:01:42,085 --> 01:01:44,087
manny, i...

754
01:01:46,089 --> 01:01:48,550
i need you.

755
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:50,093
sal, come on!

756
01:01:50,093 --> 01:01:52,553
you always do for me.

757
01:01:54,555 --> 01:01:57,558
do for me, manny.

758
01:01:57,558 --> 01:01:59,560
it's o.k.

759
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,102
it'll be o.k.

760
01:02:01,102 --> 01:02:03,396
do this!

761
01:02:03,396 --> 01:02:05,357
aah!

762
01:02:05,357 --> 01:02:06,900
aah...

763
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,903
woman in movie: the walls
around are bare,

764
01:02:09,903 --> 01:02:12,363
echoing to our laughter,

765
01:02:12,363 --> 01:02:14,907
as though the dead
were there.

766
01:02:14,907 --> 01:02:17,368
man: ha ha!
nice little sentiment!

767
01:02:17,368 --> 01:02:19,870
but there's more,
even nicer.

768
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,872
quaff a cup to
the dead already.

769
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:24,415
ah-choo!

770
01:02:24,415 --> 01:02:26,876
oh, never mind
the rest, dear!

771
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:29,879
that son of a bitch
is heavy!

772
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:32,423
dracula:
to die, be really dead...

773
01:02:32,423 --> 01:02:35,425
that must
be glorious.

774
01:02:35,425 --> 01:02:36,885
woman:
why, count dracula!

775
01:02:36,885 --> 01:02:39,930
there are far
worse things...

776
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,392
awaiting man...

777
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:45,935
than death.

778
01:02:50,398 --> 01:02:52,400
manny?

779
01:03:16,922 --> 01:03:18,423
manny?

780
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:40,484
aah!

781
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:42,945
out light!

782
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:44,488
you killed him.

783
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:47,950
nah!

784
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:49,493
ha!

785
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,494
resting.

786
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:55,498
he's dead.

787
01:03:57,459 --> 01:04:00,003
they said i was dead.

788
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:02,463
i ask you--am i dead?

789
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:11,013
i got this tingle.

790
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:15,016
there's something
you can do for me.

791
01:04:16,017 --> 01:04:16,976
aah!

792
01:04:30,989 --> 01:04:33,824
this shirt is disgusting.

793
01:04:36,702 --> 01:04:40,706
this fat bastard.

794
01:04:43,251 --> 01:04:46,253
what's he got,
lead in his ass?

795
01:04:48,255 --> 01:04:49,756
1...2...

796
01:04:49,756 --> 01:04:50,757
3!

797
01:04:50,757 --> 01:04:51,758

809
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,742

810
01:05:22,286 --> 01:05:26,290
oh, god, somebody help me!

811
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:27,790

815
01:05:36,257 --> 01:05:39,259
he killed my manny.

01:05:39,801 --> 01:05:41,803
he ate my manny!

817
01:05:41,803 --> 01:05:43,805

01:05:46,308 --> 01:05:48,310
he killed my manny!

819
01:05:48,768 --> 01:05:50,311
he ate manny!

820
01:05:53,772 --> 01:05:57,776
radio: steve, what's
happening? you find joe?

821
01:05:57,776 --> 01:06:00,778

i'm going to grind you
down to blood...

825
01:06:41,441 --> 01:06:43,484
and screams.

826
01:07:10,467 --> 01:07:14,972
hey, joey, we're going to
take this nice and slow...

827
01:07:15,973 --> 01:07:18,474
so why don't you
take your shoes off,

828
01:07:18,975 --> 01:07:19,976

829
01:07:19,976 --> 01:07:22,979
whoa! hey, come on!

830
01:07:29,985 --> 01:07:32,487
hey, come on!

831
01:07:32,487 --> 01:07:35,991
sal, this is going to get

832
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,593
i want him alive!

833
01:08:57,064 --> 01:08:58,565
hey! hey!

834
01:08:58,565 --> 01:09:01,068
stop, for christ's sake!

835
01:09:13,579 --> 01:09:15,580
son of a bitch.

836
01:09:17,582 --> 01:09:20,085
would you please
help me in the car?

837
01:09:22,629 --> 01:09:25,590
he shot my fucking foot!

838
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:29,093
oh, shit!

839
01:09:46,109 --> 01:09:48,610
if you had just
left him to me,

840
01:09:49,111 --> 01:09:51,613
i would have stopped him
before he fed.

841
01:09:52,114 --> 01:09:54,116
now he's 100 times
more dangerous.

842
01:09:54,616 --> 01:09:56,118
who did macelli eat?

843
01:09:56,118 --> 01:09:58,120
some guy named manny.

844
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:01,122
an innocent person dead
because you screwed up!

845
01:10:01,622 --> 01:10:02,665
manny bergman?

846
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:05,126
he wasn't innocent.
he's a lawyer.

847
01:10:05,126 --> 01:10:06,627
maybe he's not dead.

848
01:10:06,627 --> 01:10:09,130
maybe i have to
finish him, too.

849
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:10,630
or what?

850
01:10:11,131 --> 01:10:13,633
he becomes like macelli
or becomes like you?

851
01:10:14,134 --> 01:10:15,135
macelli's
nothing like me.

852
01:10:15,635 --> 01:10:18,638
he's a cold-blooded
killer.

853
01:10:18,638 --> 01:10:20,639
and what are you?

854
01:10:30,649 --> 01:10:32,150
yeah.

855
01:11:04,513 --> 01:11:06,515
hey!

856
01:11:09,518 --> 01:11:12,521
jesus christ!

857
01:11:17,024 --> 01:11:19,026
heh heh heh heh!

858
01:11:19,026 --> 01:11:22,530
what the hell you doing?
we're on his ass!

859
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:30,537
it's over for now.

860
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:32,038
you two want a room?

861
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,540
yes.

862
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,041
no!

863
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,042
you know what
macelli was.

864
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:39,044
i know what
he's become.

865
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:42,047
if we stick together,
we can find him.

866
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:44,550
i could find him
right now.

867
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:47,552
just help me get out
of these cuffs.

868
01:11:47,552 --> 01:11:49,554
try that little
key there.

869
01:11:49,554 --> 01:11:52,557
macelli's
got to get inside.

870
01:11:52,557 --> 01:11:55,560
we should do the same.

871
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,562
you look beat.

872
01:11:59,062 --> 01:12:02,065
you look a little
drained yourself.

873
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:04,067
i'm fine.

874
01:12:04,067 --> 01:12:06,570
you lost a lot of blood.

875
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:09,072
are you sure
you don't need more?

876
01:12:10,072 --> 01:12:13,450
don't worry.
you're not my type.

877
01:12:19,248 --> 01:12:21,666
aah!
what is this shit?

878
01:12:27,172 --> 01:12:28,173
what the fuck?

879
01:13:05,706 --> 01:13:07,208
gee, mr. macelli.

880
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:10,169
i never seen you here
so early.

881
01:13:10,169 --> 01:13:12,171
is there something wrong?

882
01:13:26,225 --> 01:13:30,229
mr. macelli, you want
i should, uh, call somebody?

883
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:33,232
this is good.

884
01:13:33,232 --> 01:13:35,692
leave me alone.
shut the door.

885
01:13:35,692 --> 01:13:37,693
but you're
in the freezer--

886
01:13:37,693 --> 01:13:40,238
get out!
hit the fucking lights!

887
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:41,239
yeah, ok.

888
01:14:09,722 --> 01:14:11,724
yeah, in my cold storage!

889
01:14:11,724 --> 01:14:15,270
he's got a rump roast
for a pillow!

890
01:14:17,105 --> 01:14:18,565
thank you.

891
01:14:25,112 --> 01:14:27,114
we have a deal?

892
01:14:45,046 --> 01:14:48,550
we'll be staying
till sundown--7:17 p.m.

893
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,552
she insists
it was macelli

894
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:53,053
and that joe gennaro
was loaded

895
01:14:53,053 --> 01:14:55,055
into the back
of macelli's limo.

896
01:14:55,598 --> 01:14:57,558
then find them--
macelli and gennaro--

897
01:14:57,558 --> 01:15:00,561
and you better hope
gennaro's still alive.

898
01:15:02,062 --> 01:15:05,565
oh, fellas. try not to
lose your car this time.

899
01:15:05,565 --> 01:15:06,566
yes, ma'am.

900
01:15:07,066 --> 01:15:08,568
yes, ma'am.

901
01:15:13,072 --> 01:15:16,116
dr. kivowitz says
you'll be fine, manny.

902
01:15:16,116 --> 01:15:18,076
you just need
a transfusion.

903
01:15:22,581 --> 01:15:25,082
mr. bergman, we know
macelli did this.

904
01:15:25,082 --> 01:15:28,085
he also tried
to assault your wife.

905
01:15:28,085 --> 01:15:31,088
can i count on you
to press charges?

906
01:15:31,088 --> 01:15:32,089
bergman?

907
01:15:32,089 --> 01:15:33,090
bergman?

908
01:15:45,101 --> 01:15:48,604
you're ok.
you're going to be fine.

909
01:16:20,633 --> 01:16:23,636
you've been in there
a long time.

910
01:16:23,636 --> 01:16:26,639
you having trouble with
that deep-down clean?

911
01:16:28,641 --> 01:16:31,643
i thought you'd be
asleep by now.

912
01:16:33,145 --> 01:16:34,646
dream on.

913
01:16:43,654 --> 01:16:47,658
i'm trusting you to see
i don't get any sun.

914
01:16:51,162 --> 01:16:53,163
can i trust you?

915
01:16:53,163 --> 01:16:56,166
it's kind of
a one-way street,

916
01:16:56,166 --> 01:16:57,667
this trust thing.

917
01:16:57,667 --> 01:16:59,669
you can trust me.

918
01:17:01,171 --> 01:17:02,671
right.

919
01:17:05,674 --> 01:17:07,676
my eyes are sensitive.

920
01:17:25,192 --> 01:17:28,195
i know you're good, joe.

921
01:17:28,195 --> 01:17:30,197
a good man.

922
01:17:30,197 --> 01:17:32,699
i see that.

923
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:35,201
i feel that.

924
01:17:35,201 --> 01:17:38,204
yeah, well, see this,
and feel this--

925
01:17:38,204 --> 01:17:40,706
get the fuck
away from me.

926
01:17:40,706 --> 01:17:42,708
i won't hurt you.

927
01:17:45,711 --> 01:17:48,713
just get over there
on the bed.

928
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,720
chicken shit.

929
01:18:09,649 --> 01:18:12,068
sleep tight.

930
01:18:23,578 --> 01:18:25,038
hiya, bill.

931
01:18:25,038 --> 01:18:26,540
g'day, haynes.

932
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,542
you better win
at southampton tomorrow.

933
01:18:30,042 --> 01:18:32,044
park these in
a lucky spot

934
01:18:32,545 --> 01:18:33,546
for a few hours.

935
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:19,129
aah!

936
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:22,132
aah!

937
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,592
aah!
aah!

938
01:19:44,652 --> 01:19:46,612
my god!

939
01:19:51,074 --> 01:19:52,075
fuck!

940
01:19:52,075 --> 01:19:53,577
aah!

941
01:22:13,329 --> 01:22:15,331
we have to go.

942
01:22:15,873 --> 01:22:17,874
i can't.

943
01:22:17,874 --> 01:22:19,334
now's the time
to get macelli.

944
01:22:19,876 --> 01:22:20,877
he's sleeping.

945
01:22:20,877 --> 01:22:23,838
he will sleep
if he's not disturbed,

946
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:26,341
but his senses
are razor-sharp.

947
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:29,843
he can wake like that
and move like this.

948
01:22:29,843 --> 01:22:31,345
aah!

949
01:22:38,393 --> 01:22:40,394
you need me, joe.

950
01:22:40,394 --> 01:22:42,855
you really do.

951
01:23:03,874 --> 01:23:05,876
i can't do this.

952
01:23:39,407 --> 01:23:41,909
what happens when
you get excited?

953
01:23:41,909 --> 01:23:44,411
pretty much
as usual, joe.

954
01:23:45,912 --> 01:23:47,914
yeah, but
maybe you bite.

955
01:23:50,417 --> 01:23:53,462
right now, i need this
more than blood.

956
01:24:03,929 --> 01:24:05,431
face it...

957
01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:07,432
you trust me.

958
01:24:08,933 --> 01:24:11,436
at least, partially.

959
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:50,971
still a little
worried here.

960
01:24:51,972 --> 01:24:55,017
how can we
stop this worry?

961
01:27:00,964 --> 01:27:03,967
think i can have
your name now?

962
01:27:05,969 --> 01:27:06,970
marie.

963
01:27:12,475 --> 01:27:13,476
marie.

964
01:27:32,618 --> 01:27:34,620
where is everybody?

965
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:36,163
close the door!

966
01:27:43,628 --> 01:27:46,131
lenny, what's
the fucking emergency?

967
01:27:47,632 --> 01:27:49,134
what happened to you?

968
01:27:49,134 --> 01:27:51,636
someone shot me
in the foot.

969
01:27:51,636 --> 01:27:53,138
why?

970
01:27:55,139 --> 01:27:56,140
what's going on,
lenny?

971
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:58,142
he had me call you,

972
01:27:58,142 --> 01:28:00,144
said it was
something important.

973
01:28:00,144 --> 01:28:02,646
frank, ray,
listen to the guy.

974
01:28:02,646 --> 01:28:04,148
look at the guy!

975
01:28:04,148 --> 01:28:08,151
tell me if it's not time
to pass the torch.

976
01:28:08,151 --> 01:28:09,652
you got
macelli in there?

977
01:28:11,154 --> 01:28:12,655
i'm just saying,

978
01:28:12,655 --> 01:28:14,657
look at the man.

979
01:28:35,718 --> 01:28:38,720

01:28:47,187 --> 01:28:49,688
[fly buzzing]

984
01:29:05,203 --> 01:29:08,706
i can hear an angel fart.

985
01:29:10,207 --> 01:29:12,209
i heard you, lenny.

986
01:29:13,752 --> 01:29:15,212

lenny...

992
01:29:30,226 --> 01:29:31,726
i loved you...

993
01:29:31,726 --> 01:29:33,269

994
01:29:34,729 --> 01:29:37,273
you son of a bitch.

995
01:29:37,732 --> 01:29:39,734

999
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:59,252
put lenny in the trunk

1000
01:29:59,252 --> 01:30:02,255
and get me
some clean clothes.

1001
01:30:03,756 --> 01:30:05,257

1002
01:30:05,257 --> 01:30:06,758
