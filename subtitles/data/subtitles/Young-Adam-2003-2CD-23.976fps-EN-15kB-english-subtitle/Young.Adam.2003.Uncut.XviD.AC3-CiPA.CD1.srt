1
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:19,907
Oh bloody useless.
Just give me that

2
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:54,221
I suppose we should cover her

3
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:57,971
Yes

4
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:38,621
Let's call an ambulance

5
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:40,571
Right

6
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:12,621
So?

7
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:15,971
They're not a hurry I
told they she was dead

8
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,371
- No eggs this morning?
- I forgot to buy eggs

9
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:51,721
Get off

10
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:54,221
Quick

11
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:03,571
<i>That's good

12
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:07,421
You didn't see anything?

13
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:26,721
Wait

14
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:33,021
OK

15
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:06,421
- What do the police think?
- The sergeant doesn't know

16
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:09,071
It was not a murder, there
are no marks on the body

17
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:10,921
You had a good look then

18
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,221
You can't keep your eyes off
women even when she's dead

19
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:26,621
I think she fell on water

20
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,321
So how do you explain
she was half naked?

21
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:34,021
May be she was drunk

22
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:37,771
May be she wander
on boats or something

23
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:40,471
May be she was pregnant

24
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:44,071
Right

25
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,221
Don't worry, it's
just the drink

26
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:15,521
What do you think, Joe?

27
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:18,471
- About what?
- The dead

28
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:24,621
I think she went to
the bridge fully dressed

29
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,421
To breath the warm night air

30
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:33,221
Then she took off her jacket
and put it on the ground

31
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,721
And then she
unbuttoned her blouse

32
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:40,921
And then she lifted
up her brassieres

33
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:43,971
And dropped it down on
top of other clothes

34
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:50,671
An she undone button of her skirt,
and it slipped down over her hips.

35
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:55,186
Then she undone her stockings

36
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,270
And hold them up so they blew in the breeze
before she let them flew off into the night

37
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:04,771
And she shivered

38
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:07,521
She wondered if she
really wanted to do it

39
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,621
She answered this question by
kicking her clothes into the river

40
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:13,871
And horridly now she take off
her garter and her knickers

41
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:17,421
And there she be,
standing in a petticoat

42
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,121
Thinking over what
brought her to this

43
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:26,021
And the with
particle below her

44
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:28,371
She dropped into
the river like a rose

45
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:31,271
And float there for a moment

46
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,971
And begone

47
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,471
What kind of
women would do that?

48
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:42,521
Just an ordinary woman

49
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:47,171
You are going to sit
there all day drinking tea?

50
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:05,271
Hi

51
00:09:09,621 --> 00:09:12,471
Sign here and don't dirt it

52
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:19,621
You are the one
who found the girl?

53
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:22,071
Right

54
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:25,021
There are evil
men in this town

55
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:59,421
- How come you get so little water?
- Shut your mouth

56
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,371
Come on, Jim. This way

57
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,021
There's a good pub in Leers.

58
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:42,971
We should go there
for a game of darts

59
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:44,071
Right

60
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,521
Joe challange me to
a game of darts.

61
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:00,771
- You play darts?
- Sometimes

62
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,671
Just to pass the time

63
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:06,021
You don't find anything more
interesting to spend the time?

64
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:09,071
I can tell one or two thing
but not in front of a kid

65
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:12,071
Don't you laugh to yourself

66
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:15,571
- What is so funny?
- Eat your potato.

67
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:21,521
All of it

68
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:39,671
- Don't kick me, mom
- Stop yelling

69
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:45,321
You finished, Joe?

70
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:56,371
May be they'll say something in the
evening newspapers about that body

71
00:14:57,371 --> 00:14:59,271
Do you think they'll
write about us?

72
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:00,521
No

73
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:08,021
Myself and Joe picked up a
body from the river this morning

74
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:11,221
- Naked
- Murder

75
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:13,821
Possible. She
had no clothes on

76
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,671
- Was she cut?
- Not a mark on her

77
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:18,571
Here we are

78
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:23,671
A body of a dead woman was found
in the River Clay this morning

79
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:26,321
The woman was wearing
only a thin petticoat

80
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:28,436
So far she was unidentified

81
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:30,921
- Police...
- You said she was naked

82
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:33,371
The same thing,
it was transparent

83
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:36,271
Les, I've got a headache,
I'm going back to the barge

84
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:38,971
- Another game of darts?
- Another time

85
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:42,521
I'll give you a game

86
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,171
Where's Les?

87
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:16,271
He's found someone
to play darts with

88
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,071
He'll be here at least an hour

89
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,021
We'll wake the boy

90
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:43,371
Why don't we go up on deck?

91
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,471
I'm not going any further

92
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:23,421
Police are
investigating that woman

93
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,687
There's a bit in the
newspaper about its

94
00:18:32,675 --> 00:18:34,825
What makes you think of that?

95
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,199
Something to say

96
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:42,549
You have done enough
talking for one night

97
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,299
Are you sorry?

98
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:49,349
That's not good, do we?

99
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:07,249
It's pity if he's coming back

100
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:08,749
What?

101
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,699
It's pity if he's coming back

102
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:16,799
The bunk there

103
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,099
You're nice, Joe

104
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,799
You hungry? I'll
fry you an egg

105
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,449
No, not now

106
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:41,149
I'll take a cup of tea though

107
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:17,499
- You two are bloody quiet
- Same as you, no?

108
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,749
- What's up Les?
- I know fine well what's up

109
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:23,749
He's lost money at darts again. And he
came back here to try to take out at me

110
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,499
- Listen woman...
- You shut your damned mouth, Leslie Gold!

111
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:28,149
You have no rights
to yell at me

112
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:31,049
I have never lost
money at darts

113
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:32,499
You are a liar!

114
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:43,849
- Tea is ready?
- You in a hurry?

115
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:46,349
The tea is ready
when it's ready

116
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,099
You read that they
wrote in the papers

117
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,014
They didn't mention about us

118
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:57,449
I am not really
interested in any of that

119
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:11,499
- Have you been swimming?
- I don't swim

120
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:18,499
How about you?

121
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,949
I don't have a
swimming costume

122
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:28,799
You are here on holiday?

123
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:31,249
It's free day today

124
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,349
What's your name?

125
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:41,008
Cathie

126
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,749
Would you like to go with
me for a walk, Cathie?

127
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:51,299
Where to?

128
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:54,199
Over there

129
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,199
Tim's over board!

130
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:36,199
The boy is
overboard, Ella. Help

131
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,449
- You alright?
- Right

132
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,099
Thank you.

133
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:19,825
Thanks, Joe

134
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:38,549
- Look at that
- A funfair. Can we go there?

135
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,849
You can ask your mom

136
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,899
Ella. Look at that

137
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,099
May be we go there with Tim?

138
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,749
- I've my work to do. You take him
- I'll stay aboard if you want to go

139
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:04,099
I have no time. You go

140
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:08,949
Come along, Joe?
Stretch for your legs

141
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:11,399
Yes, all right

142
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,399
Here we are

143
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:27,249
Watch me

144
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:34,099
- Yes, yes, that one!
- Got it

145
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:35,499
2 pence.

146
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:37,499
You see, I always win

147
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:40,049
How do you like it, son?

148
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:44,949
- And that's it
- You are touching the line, sorry

149
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:48,499
- Excuse me, I was not touching the line
- You touched the line

150
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,914
What are you doing here?

151
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:58,149
- I'm working here now
- Right, right, Bob. This is Joe Huggy.

152
00:27:58,184 --> 00:27:59,766
He works with us
couple of months

153
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:01,314
- Nice to meet you, Joe.
- Me too

154
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:04,799
Me and Les, we used to
work on the same boat

155
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,049
- Never the same shipyard
- No

156
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:09,849
- That was good time?
- Yes

157
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,949
2 pence.

158
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:14,414
Bob, here is my son, Jim.

159
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:17,349
- Jim, this is Bob.
- We close the game

160
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:20,464
<i>I don't want to go
back to the barge

161
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:23,699
Do you want to go to the picture?
There are two of them in town

162
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:25,516
- Do you want to go to the picture?
- Yae

163
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:27,264
Joe, do you want to
go to the picture?

164
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:30,799
No, no. I'll walk into town
then go back to the barge

165
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:33,249
Let make it quick

166
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:58,399
Go, Joe. I don't
want to see you

167
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:00,749
Go

168
00:29:17,699 --> 00:29:20,649
Look what you've done

169
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:25,849
Give it to me

170
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:40,249
It's broken

171
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:54,849
Hello, Joe.

172
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:56,299
Hello, Cathie.

173
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,849
What are you doing here?

174
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:06,899
- I'm working here by the river
- You are working?

175
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:10,449
Joe Taylor condescend to
mix with the working class?

176
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:12,899
I don't take any pride in it

177
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,649
I see you never
made it to China

178
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:25,599
- Your flat is still there?
- Yes

179
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:28,549
I've got a flat mate now

180
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,299
Is she nice?

181
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:33,199
I don't see her much

182
00:31:35,949 --> 00:31:38,299
Why barge, Joe?

183
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:41,599
You can find work
more glamorous

184
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:45,399
Just sort of have it, really

185
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:50,549
- What about you, you still at the office?
- Yes

186
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:55,149
Nothing's really changed

187
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,299
Except us

188
00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:09,649
- What did you do with all my stuff?
- I threw them away

189
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:13,099
As you told me to

190
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,099
I thought I would
never see you again

191
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:43,599
- Hi gentlemen
- Go, Joe.

192
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:47,599
- You sure?
- I'm scaling a little

193
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:49,949
It'll get hot in an hour

194
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,199
Joe, get some sacs of coal

195
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:19,149
- Tim!
- Easy said than done

196
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:21,499
We continue?

197
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:24,099
Put it in the back
of the truck, Joe.

198
00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:27,099
- It's in your truck now
- Thanks

199
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:29,449
What about the boy

200
00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:33,949
- Will you come to see him?
- He'll be back in school again next week

201
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:38,399
I have some surprise for you

202
00:37:40,249 --> 00:37:41,449
A banana!

203
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:44,249
- What should you say?
- Thank you, uncle Sam.

204
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:49,349
- Thanks
- Will you talk about the naked lady?

205
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,099
- Yes, some pervert has done it
- Me and Joe found her

206
00:37:53,134 --> 00:37:55,549
- You're joking
- We called the police

207
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,549
Will you stop
talking about this?

208
00:37:57,799 --> 00:37:59,799
All talk about it

209
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,099
Drink your tea

210
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:10,199
Say bye to your dad

211
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,999
- Bye, dad
- Bye, son. Take care of yourself

212
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:20,449
- Take care
- Bye

213
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:02,849
You're sad about Tim?

214
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:07,399
He needs an education.

215
00:40:08,649 --> 00:40:12,499
But when he goes
away It breaks my heart

216
00:42:14,249 --> 00:42:18,149
<i>Think of me when you look at
yourself. With undying love, C.

217
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,099
I had a dream
about you yesterday

218
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:29,799
I don't think for months

219
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:35,099
- I think you have gone away
- I had gone away

220
00:42:35,899 --> 00:42:38,699
I shed my own skin
and hide in the fog

221
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,149
I am pregnant

222
00:42:44,149 --> 00:42:45,499
It's yours
