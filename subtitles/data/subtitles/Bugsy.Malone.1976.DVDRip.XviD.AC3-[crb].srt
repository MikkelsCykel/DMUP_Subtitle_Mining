<i>Someone once said if</i>

2
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,676
<i>Roxy Robinson</i>
<i>wouldn't even get wet.</i>

3
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,752
<i>Roxy spent his life making</i>
<i>two and two into five.</i>

4
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,994
<i>He could smell trouble</i>
<i>like others smelled gas.</i>

5
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,669
<i>But believe you me...</i>

6
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,077
<i>he shouldn't have taken that</i>
<i>alley by Parito's bakery.</i>

7
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,879
Your name Robinson?

8
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,398
Roxy Robinson?

9
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,312
You work for Fat Sam?

10
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,553
<i>Whatever game it was,</i>
<i>sure as eggs...</i>

11
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,518
<i>is eggs, Roxy the Weasel</i>
<i>had been scrambled.</i>

12
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,280
<i>I should be filling you in.</i>

13
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,320
<i>This guy's the hero of our story.</i>

14
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,277
<i>Name of Bugsy Malone.</i>

15
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,275
<i>A nice guy, a little too</i>
<i>popular with the broads.</i>

16
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,475
<i>Italian mother, Irish</i>
<i>father. Grown up confused.</i>

17
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,392
<i>Kinda mixed up. By the</i>
<i>way, my name's Sam.</i>

18
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,512
<i>Fat Sam, because of my physique.</i>

19
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,029
<i>I ain't no dumb-bell.</i>

20
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,476
<i>And this ain't no bookshop.</i>
<i>This is my place.</i>

21
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,434
<i>Fat Sam's Grand Slam.</i>
<i>Best joint in town.</i>

22
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,268
- Hi, Jelly.
- Hi, Bugsy.

23
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,069
<i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>to bring you a news flash.</i>

24
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,517
<i>We have reports of an incident</i>
<i>on the Lower East side...</i>

25
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,753
<i>involving the man known</i>
<i>as Roxy the Weasel.</i>

26
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,037
<i>Believed to be a member</i>
<i>of the gang of mobster king...</i>

27
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,668
<i>Fat Sam Stacette.</i>
<i>Robinson was the victim of a...</i>

28
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,558
<i>sensational event.</i>

29
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,075
<i>We go over to our</i>
<i>reporter on the spot...</i>

30
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,396
So tell me.

31
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,311
How'd you allow this to happen?

32
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,515
Roxy was one of my best!
What have you got to say...

33
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,113
you bunch of dummies?

34
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,829
Call yourselves hoodlums?

35
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,919
You're a disgrace to the
profession. You hear me?

36
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,158
And most of all, a
disgrace to me. Fat Sam.

37
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,999
And we all know
who's behind this.

38
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,395
Sure do, boss.

39
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,232
Don't need a hatful of brains...

40
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,432
- do you?
- Certainly not, boss.

41
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,273
So who is it, dummies?
Tell me! Who?

42
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,793
- Dandy...
- Dan.

43
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,798
Don't mention that
name in this office!

44
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,678
Take it easy, boss, sit down.

45
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,111
Come in.

46
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,994
I'm Blousey Brown. I'm a
singer, for the audition.

47
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,799
A singer. A singer!

48
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,389
I don't need a singer.
Come back tomorrow.

49
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,953
How about my audition?
You said okay last week.

50
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,158
Am I going mad? Are my
ears playing tricks on me?

51
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,278
Will you get out of here!

52
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,197
Dancers, dancers, surrounded
by namby-pamby dancers...

53
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,920
singers, piano players
and banjo players...

54
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,278
when I need brains.
Brains and muscles.

55
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,675
You've got us, boss.

56
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,034
You? You hunk of lard!

57
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,078
You got muscles where
you should have brains.

58
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,073
My canary's got more
brains than you! Dumb salami.

59
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,195
What's funny?

60
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,834
Don't worry, I've been trying
to see him for months.

61
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,633
- You have?
- Of course.

62
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,439
- What do you do?
- I'm the greatest tap dancer.

63
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,438
- You are?
- Of course I are. Cross my heart.

64
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,989
But all he says is
come back tomorrow.

65
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,119
How many times can
I come back tomorrow?

66
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,756
<i>Anybody who is anybody...</i>

You know something?

113
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,600
You look like you put your
face on backwards this morning.

114
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,069
- You got too much mouth.
- I'll tell my dentist.

115
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,871
- Watch where you're going.
- Sorry. It's your fault.

116
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,837
What's that, a
hockey stick?

117
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,433
No, a baseball bat.

118
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,993
You're a baseball player?

119
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,475
No, a dancer. My mother
made me pack it.

120
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,552
- You a sports nut?
- It's for protection.

121
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,112
- You take it everywhere?
- No, I came about a job.

122
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,669
- You get it?
- They said come back tomorrow.

123
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,312
- What's your name?
- Brown.

124
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,836
Sounds like a loaf of bread.

125
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,435
Blousey Brown.

126
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,589
Blousey Brown?

127
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,358
A stale loaf of bread.

128
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,238
Very funny. Terrific.

129
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,792
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Bugsy Malone.

130
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,673
Don't call us.
We'll call you.

131
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,758
It's okay, everybody.

132
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,312
Just a little excitement.

133
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,270
Razzmatazz, music. I wanna see
everyone enjoying themselves.

134
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,639
Can't say Fat Sam's place ain't
the liveliest joint in town.

135
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,990
Knuckles, this means trouble.

136
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,151
- You know what to do?
- Sure, boss.

137
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,116
Step on it, Jackson.

138
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,470
What is this?

139
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,517
Irving.

140
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,675
Get me out of here.

141
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,878
- Located the gun yet?
- I can't answer that.

142
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,679
- Not at liberty to say?
- No. I don't know the answer.

143
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,068
Where do the guns come from?

144
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,516
I'm not at liberty to say.

145
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,591
Ask Captain Smolsky.

146
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,032
O'Dreary, break up the crowd.

147
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,350
- Have you found the gun?
- No comment.

148
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,272
- And the source of the guns?
- No comment.

149
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,557
Is it true that only
one gang uses the gun?

150
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,477
No comment.

151
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,829
Can I give you a lift?

152
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,672
- You got a car?
- No.

153
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,838
How you gonna give me
a lift? Stand me on a box?

154
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,398
- We could share a taxi.
- Forget it. I don't share fares.

155
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,832
I'm a lady.
Furthermore, I'm broke.

156
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,794
- Who said share fares?
- No?

157
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,390
No. I wouldn't dream of it.

158
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,278
- You wouldn't?
- I thought you'd pay.

159
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,517
Swell.

160
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,555
Let's walk.
It's a nice night.

161
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,275
You shouldn't walk at
night. It's dangerous.

162
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,028
We'll be okay. We
got your baseball bat.

163
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,948
Quit the "we" bit.
You mean, I'll be okay.

164
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,834
- Which way you going?
- Which way you going?

165
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,715
- This way.
- Then I'm going this way.

166
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,635
Let me take that.

167
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,956
No, it's all right.
Look, beat it, will you?

168
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,318
- What have you got in here?
- Just a few books.

169
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,750
Few books? You
should start a library.

170
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,319
You should shut your mouth.

171
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,593
- Have you eaten?
- Ever since I was a kid.

172
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,672
- How come you're so skinny?
- Because I watch my weight.

173
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,918
I do that when I'm broke,
too. How about eating now?

174
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,791
No.

175
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,037
- Why not?
- I'm not hungry.

176
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,792
- Not hungry?
- No.

177
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,150
I'm starving.

178
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,789
That's more like it.

179
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,513
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight.

180
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,988
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight.

181
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,951
Goodnight.

182
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,396
Goodnight.

183
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,830
Take it easy.

184
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,274
Don't do that, Knuckles.

185
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,839
It's how I got my name.

186
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,918
Knock it off or
change your name.

187
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,836
Tallulah, how long
we got to wait?

188
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,992
Coming. You don't want me
looking a mess, do you?

189
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,830
Snap it up, will you?

190
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,275
Put your flaps down,
or you'll take off.

191
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,318
You spend more time
prettying yourself than anyone.

192
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,558
If I didn't look this good,
you wouldn't look at me.

193
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,551
I'll see you in the car.

194
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,828
What about my audition?

195
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,476
Tomorrow, Fizzy. I'm tired.
Lots of important business.

196
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,837
I have to go home.
I promise you, tomorrow.

197
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,876
Goodbye. Goodnight.

198
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,910
- You coming, Velma?
- Sure.

199
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,878
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight, Miss Tallulah.

200
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,916
Oh, my purse.

201
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,752
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

202
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,914
<i>Tomorrow never comes.</i>

203
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,512
<i>What kind of a fool</i>
<i>do they take me for?</i>

204
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,471
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

205
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,032
<i>A resting place for bums...</i>

206
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,032
<i>a trap set in the slums,</i>
<i>but I know the score.</i>

207
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,471
<i>I won't take no for an answer...</i>

208
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:06,789
<i>I was born to be a dancer...</i>

209
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,792
<i>tomorrow...</i>

210
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,153
<i>tomorrow, as they say...</i>

211
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,440
<i>another working day...</i>

212
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,917
<i>and another chore.</i>

213
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,436
<i>Tomorrow...</i>

214
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,710
<i>an awful...</i>

215
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,757
<i>place to be.</i>

216
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,469
<i>I gave up yesterday,</i>
<i>but they still want more.</i>

217
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,232
<i>They'll compare me...</i>

218
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,628
<i>to Fred Astaire...</i>

219
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,473
<i>when I'm done.</i>

220
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,231
<i>Yeah.</i>

221
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,752
<i>Anyone who feels the rhythm</i>

224

225

226
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,559
<i>tomorrow's far away...</i>

227
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,873
<i>tomorrow, as they say...</i>

228
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,517
<i>is reserved for dreams.</i>

229
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,717
<i>Tomorrow...</i>

230
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,913
<i>tomorrow's looking grey...</i>

231
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,549
<i>a playground always locked</i>

232
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,998
<i>Won't take no for an answer...</i>

233
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,596
<i>I was born to be a dancer...</i>

234
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,514
<i>now.</i>

235
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,437
<i>Anyone who feels the rhythm</i>

237

238
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,028

00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,878

00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,912
<i>till your scream becomes</i>
<i>a love shout.</i>

242
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,959
Going to the speakeasy tomorrow?

243
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,075
Depends. I'm trying my
luck at the Bijoux Theatre.

244
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,435
Lena Marelli's show?

245
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,636
She walked out. They're
changing everything.

246
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,233
How long have you
wanted to be a singer?

247
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,239
I don't want to be just a
singer, I wanna be a movie star...

248
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,316
in Hollywood.

249
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,990
What's so funny?

250
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,116
I don't know.

251
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,514
Time was when people were
happy being railway engineers...

252
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,630
or nurses.

253
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,915
Don't you want to be anybody?

254
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,712
No. I'm happy being me.

255
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,110
What do you do?

256
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,469
Oh, this and that.

257
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,434
- Crooked, huh?
- No, in-between.

258
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,676
What do you do for money?

259
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,269
- I find boxers.
- You do?

260
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,074
I used to fight myself.

261
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,548
You did? How good were you?

262
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,639
- I could've been a contender.
- You could?

263
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,155
Sure, but for a few things.

264
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,909
- Like what?
- Like a glass jaw.

265
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,277
Jelly legs, no stamina.

266
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,432
- And most of all...
- What?

267
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,796
I got scared.

268
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,634
Some contender.

269
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,675
- Want another drink?
- No, I had enough.

270
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,551
Come on.

271
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,110
- Thought you didn't have money?
- I haven't.

272
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,998
- Then how you...?
- Relax.

273
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,714
I'll think of something.

274
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,229
Two more drinks.

275
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,717
Look, pal, the food counter's
closed. the bar's closed.

276
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,274
My eyes are closing.

277
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,714
The whole joint’s closed.

278
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,315
I didn't want one, anyway.

279
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,431
Hello.

280
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,151
Operator, could you test this
line? I believe we have a fault.

281
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,598
- What number, please?
- Columbus 19785.

282
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,637
- I'll call you right back.
- Thank you.

283
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,717
How much I owe you?

284
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,995
Eight banana boozle specials,
with double ice cream.

285
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,549
Three beef spitfires...

286
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,349
two cream donuts
and a salami special.

287
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,635
Four dollars and 80 cents.

288
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,151
Excuse me.

289
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,951
Hello.

290
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,310
Let me out!

291
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,913
What are you doing? Let me out!

292
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,520
<i>We interrupt commentary</i>

300
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,236
There's a Mr. Bronx
Charlie to see you.

301
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,997
I'll be right in. Show them
into the conservatory.

302
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,751
Very good, sir.

303
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,391
Aren't you gonna play no more?

304
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,955

Lovely. Next.
Get off the stage!

Don't give up your day job.

312
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,235
I didn't figure
on this many people.

313
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,436
They all look like
jugglers and magicians.

00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,679
Don't worry. You got no
competition. You'll walk it.

315
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,750
Hurry up.

316
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,233
Evening, ladies and gentlemen.

317
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,036
I'm proud to be here.
In fact, I'm lucky to be here.

318
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,031
Because as I was coming here...

319
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,551
- How do I look?
- Fine.

320
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,349
- I look terrible.
- Believe me, you look swell.

321
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,954
- Honest?
- Honest.

322
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,714
- Cross your heart?
- Cross my heart. Beautiful.

323
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,116
Next.

324
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,519
<i>Once I built a railroad...</i>

325
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,990
Not that old chestnut.

326
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,469
Get him off. Next.

327
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,996
Good evening.

328
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,637
Suppose you're
wondering why we're here.

329
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,391
You bet.

330
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,676
Next.

331
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,750
Not one rabbit...

332
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,949
not two rabbits...

333
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,239
but three rabbits.

334
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,072
Next, next.

335
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,916
Next.

336
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,915
Yeah, great. Okay.

337
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,350
Next one there, please.

338
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,356
Give me your things.

339
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,351
Come on, come on.

340
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,992
Blousey Brown, singer.

341
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,950
Oh, nice face.

342
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,919
Great face, could
do a lot with that.

343
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,117
Oscar.

344
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,077
Oscar.

345
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,157
Oscar.

346
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,710
I'm back. I'll give
you one more chance.

347
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,070
Lena, you've come back to me.

348
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,952
I'll give you one more chance.

349
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,357
Otherwise, I'm out for
good. Out, out, out!

350
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,516
I won't be humiliated.

351
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,355
I'm the star and I
should be treated like one.

352
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,319
Hit it, Joe.

353
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,748
<i>Show business,</i>
<i>it's in my veins...</i>

354
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,315
<i>gotta keep singing</i>
<i>that old refrain...</i>

355
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,994
<i>I thrill to all those tunes</i>
<i>that make me wanna dance...</i>

356
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,912
Cheer up. There's
a million other jobs.

357
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,913
Sure, standing on the
corner asking for dimes.

358
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,197
It's only a matter of time.

359
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,394
I've walked the streets for
months, and the only fancy steps...

360
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,596
I've been doing is avoiding
the rent collector.

361
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,792
Takes time to be a movie star.

362
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,188
We could come back tomorrow.

363
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,916
Come back tomorrow? I spend
my whole life doing that.

364
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,957
Knock it off. Cool down.

365
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,314
I will not cool down.

366
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,469
Don't be stupid.

367
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,598
Will you be quiet up there?

368
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,153
I'm rehearsing.

369
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,791
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

370
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,076
There's always Fat Sam's place.

371
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,992
- He won't see me.
- I'll talk to him.

372
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,435
- You know him?
- Know him? We're like that.

373
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,550
You're good friends?

374
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,152
No, but when I see him I cross my
fingers that he won't hit me.

375
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,237
Come on, let's get out of here.

376
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,632
You're too good for this show.

377
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,314
- Why don't we try Fat Sam's?
- Yeah.

378
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,835
<i>You gotta be kidding...</i>

379
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,394
<i>that show business is my business...</i>

380
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,312
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, boss.

381
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,756
Relax, relax, will you?

382
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,599
I'd like to take the opportunity
to thank you for your work.

383
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,919
Everything's gone so well.

384
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,990
Thanks, boss.

385
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,230
Thanks, boss.

386
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,190
Fat Sam must've had quite a shock.

387
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,679
- Quite a shock.
- Thanks, boss.

388
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,552
- Thanks, boss.
- Thanks.

389
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,871
Thanks, boss.

390
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,231
Laughing boy.

391
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,837
Yonkers. Shoulders.
Bronx Charlie. Benny Lee.

392
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,188
Any moment now Fat Sam will be...

393
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,634
crawling on his knees to me.

394
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,630
On his knees.

395
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,519
- Where's my flower, boss?
- Yes...

396
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,752
soon all Fat Sam will have
is the suit he stands up in...

397
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,955
and a suitcase full of memories.

398
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,149
I don't have a flower, boss.

399
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,477
What did I do?

400
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,796
You googed, Doodle.
You dropped the gun.

401
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,158
And I don't allow mistakes.

402
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,912
'Cause they put us in the caboose.

403
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,155
- And Sing Sing ain't my style.
- No, boss.

404
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,151
Not that. Anything but that.

405
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,790
I didn't mean to drop it.
It slipped outta my hands.

406
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,111
Button your lip.
You're all washed up.

407
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,590
- Give a guy a break.
- Get him!

408
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,317
Now listen to what I
say, and listen good.

409
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,037
There's only room for one
Mr. Big in this town.

410
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,238
And that's me, Dandy Dan.

411
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,753
The time has come for
us to play our next card.

412
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,954
Believe me, Fat Sam
and his dumb bums...

413
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,792
ain't gonna stand in our way.

414
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,633
<i>We could've been anything...</i>

415
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,472
<i>that we wanted to be.</i>

416
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,438
<i>But don't it make your heart glad...</i>

417
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,429
<i>that we take pride in it...</i>

418
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,033
<i>we became the best at being bad.</i>

419
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,876
<i>We could've been</i>
<i>anything we wanted to be...</i>

420
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,269
<i>with all the talent we had.</i>

421
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,669
<i>No doubt about it,</i>
<i>we whine and we pout it...</i>

422
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,793
<i>we're the very best at being...</i>

423
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,951
<i>bad guys.</i>

424
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,032
<i>We're rotten to the core...</i>

425
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,593
<i>congratulations,</i>
<i>no one likes you anymore...</i>

426
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,712
<i>bad guys...</i>

427
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,513
<i>we're the very worst.</i>

428
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,158
<i>Each of us contemptible...</i>

429
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,197
<i>we're criticized and cursed...</i>

430
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,035
<i>we've made the big-time...</i>

431
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,350
<i>malicious and mad...</i>

432
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,078
<i>we're the very best at being bad.</i>

433
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,033
<i>Look at me, I'm dancin'.</i>

434
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,836
<i>We could've been anything</i>
<i>we wanted to be...</i>

435
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,354
<i>we took the easy way out...</i>

436
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,755
<i>with a little training,</i>
<i>we've mastered complaining...</i>

437
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,310
<i>made us seem unnecessary...</i>

438
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,550
<i>we're so rude, it's scary...</i>

439
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,957
<i>We could've been anything</i>
<i>we wanted to be...</i>

440
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,190
<i>with all the talent we had...</i>

441
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,633
<i>with a little practice</i>

442
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,711
<i>we made every black list...</i>

443
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,316
<i>we're the very best...</i>

444
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,311
<i>at being bad...</i>

445
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,590
<i>we're the very best...</i>

446
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,398
<i>at being bad.</i>

447
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,356
<i>Where you shovin' me?</i>

448
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,873
<i>We're the very best at being bad.</i>

449
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,840
What are you doing?

450
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,957
Get in here, you bunch
of peanut brains.

451
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,078
Get in here, you dummies.

452
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,629
We got business
to do. Move it!

453
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,439
Come on, get in here.

454
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,394
We got business to do.

455
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,073
We can't waste
all this time.

456
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,791
Right.

457
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,070
Let's get down to it.

458
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,349
Don't do that, Snake Eyes.
It's thinking time.

459
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,879
And don't do that, Knuckles.

460
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,110
Sure thing, boss.

461
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,793
Let's start at the beginning.

462
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,120
We're being outsmarted
by that lounge lizard.

463
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,350
And we're gonna get back on top.

464
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,794
Back on top.

465
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,155
We'll kick that drugstore cowboy...

466
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,878
- into line.
- You bet, boss.

467
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,795
We've been a little slow off
the mark, but dumb bums we ain't.

468
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,269
No, dumb bums we ain't.

469
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,519
Hand me a pie.

470
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,080
- Louie, over there in the corner.
- Me, boss?

471
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,990
Why me?

472
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,389
Louie, into the corner.

473
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,796
What did I do?

474
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,910
Nothing, Louie.

475
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,037
You see? Missed.

476
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,358
Okay, Lou. You can sit down.

477
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,559
Even a dumb bum like
Louie is too quick for us.

478
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,318
That's our trouble.
We're behind the times.

479
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,919
I don't get it.

480
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,152
We'll never get back on top
with this kind of hardware.

481
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,548
It's old-fashioned.

482
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,390
In short, we gotta
get that gun.

483
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,358
- Hello.
<i>- Want some information?</i>

484
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,839
- Start gabbin'...
<i>- It's about the splurge gun.</i>

485
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,991
<i>It's at the Hung Fu</i>
<i>Shin laundry company.</i>

486
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,798
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

487
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,918
We've had a little break.

488
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,877
Who knows the Hung Fu
Shin laundry company?

489
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,671
My friend tells me that's
where they stash the guns.

490
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,476
Get moving!

491
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,756
Not you, Knuckles.
Stay here with me.

492
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,636
Sure, boss.

493
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,872
Hello. What?

494
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,639
I don't believe it.
The whole gang?

495
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,431
Everybody?

496
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,598
That leaves you and
me. We're on our own.

497
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,268
What we gonna do?

498
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,195
Don't do that! How many
times I got to tell you?

499
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,039
Do nothing. Act like
everything was normal.

500
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,398
- What does that mean?
- You can't speak Italian?

501
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,035
No, boss, I'm Jewish.

502
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,833
Then read the translation!

503
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,039
- Hey, Fizzy.
- Hey, Bugsy.

504
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,755
- Still practicing?
- Still practicing.

505
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,356
Suddenly everybody wants
to be in show business.

506
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,438
Hi. Tallulah. I've
come to see Fat Sam.

507
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,757
- Is he in?
- No, he's busy.

508
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,158
- Hi, Bugsy.
- Hi.

509
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,958
Have a drink while you wait.

510
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,995
Yeah, why not?

511
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,232
Go feed the ducks, will you?

512
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,833
Oh, Tallulah.

513
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,194
I said, beat it.

514
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,112
Long time no see.

515
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,433
- You know how it is.
- Yeah.

516
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,711
You used to come see me every night.

517
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,394
- I've been busy.
- Busy doing what?

518
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,149
This and that.

519
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,515
Fizzy, cut the ivory
and hit the shoe leather.

520
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,276
Yes, ma'am.

521
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,269
You're aces, Bugsy.

522
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,719
I always found you special.

523
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,310
Careful, you're racing my mother.

524
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,119
Come on, give a girl a break.

525
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,918
Sure you've got the right fella?

526
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,594
- You're not like those other saps.
- No?

527
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,711
No.

528
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,116
You've got lovely brown eyes.

529
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,789
They'll be black eyes
if Fat Sam catches us.

530
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,034
- How about smearing my lipstick?
- Careful.

531
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,352
If you come any closer,
I'll have to call my lawyer.

532
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,551
So call him.

533
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,716
Blousey.

534
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,117
Blousey.

535
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,509
Blousey.

536
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,796
It's the broad about the audition.

537
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,918
He's busy. Come back tomorrow.

538
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,436
No, no, no.

539
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,959
Hey, honey. I'm all ears.
Be with you in a minute.

540
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,559
Carry on as normal.
Don't let 'em know we're beat.

541
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,438
- Business as usual.
- Right.

542
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,192
- Calm and collected.
- Right.

543
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,590
So they don't know we're
scared. I mean, concerned.

544
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:11,751
Sure, boss.

545
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,073
<i>I'm feeling fine...</i>

546
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,394
<i>filled with emotions...</i>

547
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,753
<i>stronger than wine...</i>

548
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,435
<i>they give me the notion...</i>

549
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,558
<i>that this strange new feeling...</i>

550
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,436
<i>is something that</i>
<i>you're feeling too.</i>

551
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,718
<i>Matter of fact...</i>

552
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,793
<i>I'm forced to admit it...</i>

553
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,271
<i>caught in the act...</i>

554
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,357
<i>and maybe we've hit it...</i>

555
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,957
<i>this strange new feeling...</i>

556
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,232
<i>is something you're feeling...</i>

557
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,470
Okay, honey. That's enough.

558
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,115
A little contemporary for
me, but very nice. You're hired.

559
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,953
That was great. That
really was. Terrific.

560
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,236
Blousey.

561
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,399
Come back, will you?

562
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,992
What's the use?

563
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,550
I've got to go.

564
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,910
Blousey.

565
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,669
Where is she? Blousey.

566
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,072
Show's going swell.

567
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,038
Just the way I want it to be.

568
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,151
Same number of
drinks, same everything.

569
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,991
They mustn't know
they've got us on the run.

570
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,879
Here, I wanna show you something.

571
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,678
I've sent for someone to
help us out of our predicament.

572
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,236
No ten-cent dummy. A specialist.

573
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,636
A doctor?

574
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,628
Not a doctor, a hoodlum.

575
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,637
I thought we were hoodlums.

576
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,759
Not a dumb bum. This
guy is the real McCoy.

577
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,639
Not Looney Bergonzi!

578
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,869
<i>The</i> Looney Bergonzi?

579
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,675
The very same, mad
as a hatter, Bergonzi.

580
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,834
Best man in Chicago.
Here's what we do.

581
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,836
We meet Dandy Dan.
Looney hides in the back seat.

582
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,559
- You drive.
- Right.

583
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,231
- But I don't drive.
- You what?

584
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,796
You don't drive?

585
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,154
Then we get ourselves a driver.

586
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,071
- Hi, Bugsy.
- Is Blousey there?

587
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,196
- She won't see you.
- Tell her I'm sick.

588
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,391
- You're sick?
- Sick of waiting.

589
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,470
Beat it.

590
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,552
Give a guy a break.

591
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,315
I brought you some flowers.

592
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,954
I'll see Tallulah gets them.

593
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,310
Quit being smart. They're for you.

594
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,549
Five minutes, girls.

595
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,756
- I have to go.
- I was thinking of getting a job.

596
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,151
You don't get paid for
standing in bread lines.

597
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,632
A legit job. We could save
enough money to go to Hollywood.

598
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,558
Believe it when I see it.

599
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,715
- Bugsy, you drive?
- Sure, why?

600
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,316
- Like to earn some green stuff?
- Long as it ain't cabbages.

601
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,075
Step inside. I got
a proposition for you.

602
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,869
Flowers? For me?

603
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,997
How nice.

604
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,157
Put these in water.

605
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,316
Hello?

606
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,230
Who shall I say is
calling? One moment.

607
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,635
- Hello.
- Dandy Dan, is that you?

608
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,920
- This is Dandy Dan speaking.
- I wanna arrange a meeting.

609
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,511
- Sure. Where?
- Outta town.

610
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,359
Agreed. Just you and a driver.

611
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,996
- When?
- Monday. 11 A.M..

612
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,349
Right, I'll be there.

613
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,718
<i>Got him, the knuckle.</i>

614
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,673
<i>Got him, the salami.</i>

615
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,796
Let's go and enjoy the show.

616
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,750
<i>My name is Tallulah...</i>

617
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,792
<i>my first rule of thumb...</i>

618
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,632
<i>I don't say where I'm going,</i>
<i>or where I'm coming from.</i>

619
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,278
<i>I try to leave a little</i>
<i>reputation behind me...</i>

620
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:56,079
<i>so if you really need to,</i>
<i>you'll know how to find me.</i>

621
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,310
<i>My name is Tallulah...</i>

622
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,352
<i>I live till I die...</i>

623
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,154
<i>I'll take what you give me...</i>

624
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,118
<i>and I won't ask why.</i>

625
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,910
<i>I've made a lot of friends</i>
<i>in exotic places...</i>

626
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,189
<i>I don't remember names...</i>

627
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,670
<i>but I remember faces.</i>

628
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:39,917
<i>Lonely, you don't</i>
<i>have to be lonely...</i>

629
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:48,150
<i>come see Tallulah, we can</i>
<i>chase your troubles away.</i>

630
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,790
<i>If you're lonely...</i>

631
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,238
<i>you don't have to be lonely.</i>

632

635

<i>My name is Tallulah...</i>

636
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,792
<i>and soon I'll be gone...</i>

637

649
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,431
They're coming.

650
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,915
Looney, keep your head down.

651
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,029
What can I do for you?

652
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,476
How about some straight talk?

653
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,630
Suits me.

654
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,439
- You've been taking liberties.
- I've been taking what's mine.

655
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,875
- Trouble is, it belongs to me.
- Too bad.

656
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,637
I'm sure we can talk
it over. I'm a businessman.

657
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,837
Yeah, a dime-a-dozen gangster.

658
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,196
Button your lip.
Don't talk dirty to me.

659
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,794
I don't like your
mouth. Have some respect.

660
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,469
You'd slit your own
throat for two bits.

661
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,471
Keep your wisecracks.

662
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,589
Keep talking.

663
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,831
I have my position to think of.

664
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,116
Right now it's not worth a nickel.

665
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,157
You're a dirty rat, Dan.

666
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,436
You've been watching
too many movies.

667
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,429
Okay, Looney, let him have it.

668
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,318
Charlie, Yonkers,
it's a double-cross.

669
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,832
Okay, freeze.

670
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:29,751
Looney.

671
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,078
What's the matter with you?

672
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,875
Hey, you guys.

673
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,870
Over here!

674
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,069
Over here!

675
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,638
Come back, dummies!
They're getting away.

676
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,195
Come back here.

677
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,469
Come on, step on it.

678
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,949
Come on, let's go.

679
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,234
We're going to lose them.

680
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,829
Drive faster.

681
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,829
Dan, you're a rat!

682
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,679
You're a dirty rat!

683
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,513
Come on, they're gonna get us.

684
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,708
Hold tight, Mr. Stacetto.

685
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:10,677
Come on, Malone.

686
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,879
You're a dirty
double-crossing rat!

687
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:17,991
Look out.

688
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:21,671
Don't stop!

689
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,556
There's a bridge!

690
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,795
Put the brakes on!

691
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,110
We lost them.

692
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,956
Go and cluck somewhere else.

693
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,079
Here. Get yourself a new suit.

694
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,479
Get rid of the sack you're wearing.

695
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,388
Thank you, Mr. Stacetto.

696
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,391
Here's my tailor's card.

697
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,756
You ain't got to
pay for six months.

698
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,270
Thank you very much.

699
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,716
Think nothing
of it. Let's go.

700
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,191
What do you think?
Don't I look cute?

701
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:10,837
I don't know.

702
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,348
Come on, Dotty,
what do you think?

703
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,957
I think the color's wrong.

704
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,673
What are you talking about?

705
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,592
Purple's my color.

706
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,269
Don't I always wear purple?

707
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,668
It matches your nose.

708
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,875
Maybe it's the length.

709
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,397
It's the latest length. Look!

710
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,075
Maybe the frills stick out
too much. Like your ears.

711
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,115
Frills are in. Look at
this photo of Lena Marelli.

712
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,231
Lena Marelli is
not Bangles Dobell.

713
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,595
You think it'd
look better on you?

714
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,875
It'd look better on a horse.

715
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,636
Jealous. Can I help it if my
looks are ahead of their time?

716
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,116
What?

717
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,190
Full of character.

718
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:45,991
Kind of earthy.

719
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,559
Like a bucket of mud.

720
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,276
You creep. Get lost!

721
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,309
How about you? Do you
think I look terrible?

722
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,673
Do I look cute or terrible?

723
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:06,831
Honestly?

724
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,996
Bangles Dobell, you look terrible.

725
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,270
What are you looking at?

726
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:15,877
Nothing.

727
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,357
<i>Blousey.</i>

728
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,271
Blousey.

729
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,671
Blousey.

730
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,954
It's for you. It's Bugsy.

731
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,675
Give him my love.

732
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,191
Thanks.

733
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,551
Hello.

734
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,592
Blousey, it's Bugsy.

735
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,351
Where are you?

736
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,433
Around. I can't talk,
but I just made 200 bucks.

737
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,039
You printed it yourself?

738
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,509
No, I earned it.

739
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,397
Doing what?

740
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,516
Oh, this and that.

741
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,188
Hang on a minute.

742
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,669
I can't hear you.

743
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,398
There's a train going by.

744
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,630
Who gave you the money?

745
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,391
Fat Sam.

746
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,318
He gave you 200 dollars?

747
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,557
And the loan of his
sedan for the afternoon.

748
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,313
He loaned you his sedan?

749
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,472
I don't believe it.
You're putting me on.

750
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,196
I believe you.

751
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,114

Mustard with onions or ketchup?

772
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,790
Mustard with onions.

773
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,628
Oh, and this, too.

774
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,190
- What's this?
- A present.

775
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,588
- Open it up.
- You got to be kidding.

776
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,949
I don't kid around.

777
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,675

Nice, huh?

What is it?

780
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,952
What is it? A viewer.

781
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,873
Look through here.

782
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,958
Pictures of Hollywood stars.

783
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:47,950
Bugsy...

784
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,430
it's fantastic. It really is.

785
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,918
If only I could get to Hollywood.

786
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:53,797
You can.

787
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:54,877
Sure.

788
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,109
I know, in the front row...

789
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,190
of the Roxy Theatre...

790
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,190
on East 38th Street.

791
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,112
No, really get to Hollywood.

792
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,390
Keep talking.

793
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,788
1.80 for the viewer, right?

794
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,839
10 cents for the hot dogs.

795
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,274
Leaves 198 dollars for...

796
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,071
Surprise me.

797
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,673
- Two tickets.
- Two tickets?

798
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,115
How many tickets you need?

799
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,515
Two tickets to the ball game?

800
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,039
To Hollywood, dummy.

801
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,148
This can't be true.
Are we really going?

802
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,309
Knock it off.

803
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,590
You're putting me on.

804
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:21,870
It's the honest truth.

805
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,509
I'm picking them up tomorrow.

806
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,314
Now I better get
Fat Sam's car back.

807
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,828
Or I'm not going anywhere.

808
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,836
Is anyone in there?

809
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:11,711
Hello?

810
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:13,911
Are you hurt?

811
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,674
Help! Somebody
help me, please!

812
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,795
Somebody, please!

813
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,790
Somebody help!

814
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,195
Help me, please!

815
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,148
They take your money?

816
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,752
Yeah. Nearly 200 dollars.

817
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,669
Thanks anyway for helping me.

818
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:49,751
It was nothing.

819
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,397
- You must be a boxer, right?
- No.

820
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,518
- You're not?
- No.

821
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,319
Best punching I ever saw.

822
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,318
- Ever been coached?
- No.

823
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,717
- Ever thought of taking it up?
- No.

824
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,356
Why not? You could be a champion.

825
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,599
- Never had the chance.
- I know who could help you.

826
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,716
- You know Cagey Joe?
- No.

827
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,515
- You must know Slugger's Gym?
- No.

828
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,760
- You don't know much, do you?
- Nope.

829
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,469
What's your name?

830
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,432
Smith, Leroy Smith.

831
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,916
I'm Bugsy Malone. Put it there.

832
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,754
You got yourself a manager.

833
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,355
- Know the first thing I'm gonna do?
- No.

834
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,034
Treat you to one heck of a meal.

835
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,038
- Thought they took all your dough.
- Who needs money?

836
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,716
Look at this, O'Dreary.

837
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,430
You cracked it this time, Captain.

838
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,518
Get the plaster.
We'll take a mold.

839
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,068
Come on, get the plaster.

840
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,749
Careful. Up a bit.

841
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:52,193
Left a bit.

842
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,236
Come on, hurry up.

843
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,034
Hold it straight. Be careful.

844
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,194
You idiots!

845
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,749
Hello. What?

846
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,396
They got the still.
The whole lot's gone.

847
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,116
Not the sarsaparilla racket,
too. Get round here now.

848
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,873
- I can't, boss.
- Why not?

849
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,276
I'm all tied up.

850
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,830
I don't care if you're
busy. Get here right away.

851
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,953
Careful, you idiots.

852
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,230
O'Dreary.

853
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,191
Don't worry...

854
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,954
we'll break you out
at headquarters.

855
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:46,678
- Hi, Bugsy. How you been?
- Swell, Cagey Joe.

856
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,879
I'd like you to meet the
next heavyweight champion.

857
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,553
Leroy, meet Cagey Joe.

858
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,075
Cagey Joe, this is Leroy Smith.

859
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,994
- Ever been in the ring before?
- No.

860
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,636
- So you wanna be a fighter?
- No.

861
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,995
Sure he does. He's a natural.

862
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,350
Look at those fists.

863
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,755
Did you ever see such fists?

864
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:05,911
Hit it, Leroy.

865
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,398
You see? A born champion.

866
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,910
What's your name again?

867
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,958
Smith. Leroy Smith.

868
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,629
With your help...

869
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,319
he could be champion in no time.

870
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,031
<i>So you wanna be a boxer...</i>

871
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,759
<i>in the golden ring.</i>

872
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,636
<i>Can you punch like a train?</i>

873
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,035
<i>Tell me just one thing...</i>

874
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,598
<i>can you move like a</i>
<i>hummingbird's wing?</i>

875
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:40,915
<i>Oh, that's fast!</i>

876
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,992
<i>Can you bob, can you weave?</i>

877
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,637
<i>Well, you might as well quit...</i>

878
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,274
<i>if you haven't got it.</i>

879
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,677
<i>So you wanna be a boxer,</i>
<i>can you pass the test?</i>

880
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:58,037
<i>I can tell if you got it,</i>
<i>I've trained the best.</i>

881
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,909
<i>When you work and sweat</i>
<i>like a buzz saw...</i>

882
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,308
<i>and you near lose your mind...</i>

883
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,232
<i>when you find out your</i>
<i>boy has a glass jaw.</i>

884
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,234
<i>So you might as well quit...</i>

885
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,388
<i>if you haven't got it.</i>

886
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,157
<i>Put him in the ring,</i>
<i>look at what you've found...</i>

887
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,389
<i>we can use the fun...</i>

888
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,276
<i>pushing him around.</i>

889
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,919
<i>We'll show him the ropes...</i>

890
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,238
<i>and destroy his hopes...</i>

891
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,030
<i>put him in the ring...</i>

892
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,316
<i>let him feel the sting...</i>

893
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,151
<i>we can make him dance...</i>

894
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,753
<i>we'll pound him to bits...</i>

895
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,710
<i>then he'll call it quits.</i>

896
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,877
Come on, Leroy.

897
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,590
<i>So you wanna be a boxer,</i>
<i>wanna be the champ...</i>

898
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,269
<i>there's a golden boy inside</i>
<i>you, not a punchy tramp...</i>

899
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,518
<i>if you listen and you learn,</i>
<i>there's an honor you can earn...</i>

900
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,992
<i>when you see the crown,</i>
<i>you're a king, not a clown.</i>

901
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,108
<i>But you might as well quit...</i>

902
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,268
<i>if you haven't got it.</i>

903
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,031
<i>Put him in the ring,</i>
<i>something new to punch...</i>

904
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,151
<i>let me have a swing...</i>

905
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,673
<i>then we'll go to lunch...</i>

906
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,959
<i>then he'll get the drift.</i>

907
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,797
<i>Put him in the ring,</i>
<i>chicken à la carte...</i>

908
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,957
<i>let me have a wing,</i>
<i>tearing him apart.</i>

909
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,519
<i>The chicken will crow...</i>

910
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:19,351
<i>let me have him, Joe.</i>

911
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,037
He's got it.

912
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,350
You sure this is going to work?

913
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,200
Sure. Looks like a splurge gun.

914
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,151
Doesn't it?

915
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:49,188
- Sort of.
- Nonsense.

916
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,677
Anything Dandy Dan can
do, I can do better.

917
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,750
Are you ready?

918
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:55,711
Ready.

919
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:58,755
Don't do that!

920
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,796
Sorry, boss.

921
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,070
All right, take aim.

922
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:04,591
Ready.

923
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,591
Get set.

924
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:12,631
Fire.

925
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,111
Missed!

926
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,432
Back to the drawing board.

927
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,356
Knuckles!

928
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,955
Knuckles, speak to me.

929
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:25,711
Knuckles.

930
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,628
It's all your fault, hear me?

931
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,551
Hello?

932
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,396
Not the grocery racket, too?

933
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:07,711
Yeah.

934
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,834
That's the whole empire
gone. Hear me? Everything.

935
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,553
They'll be coming here next.

936
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,155
There's only one thing for it.

937
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,711
You have to get him to help me.

938
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,315
Who? The Lone Ranger?

939
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,869
No, Bugsy Malone. Call him.

940
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,753
I'm in trouble, and all I got for
company is a female comedienne.

941
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,350
I'm in trouble, bad trouble.

942
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:36,311
Is he there?

943
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,668
No. There's no answer.

944
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,352
Then get him to me <i>poysanally.</i>

945
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:42,671
Personally?

946
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,796
<i>- Poysanally.</i>
<i>- Poysanally.</i>

947
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,155
So long, lover boy.

948
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,679
I like men at my feet.

949
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,434
What you doing here?

950
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:22,989
I brought you a message.

951
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,159
What's wrong with Western Union?

952
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,999
Thought you'd like the company.

953
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,438
I'll buy you a drink.

954
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,271
Where?

955
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,195
How about Fat Sam's?

956
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,511
Won't he be there?

957
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:36,511
He sure will.

958
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,672
Maybe I'll stay home.

959
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,238
Don't flatter yourself...

960
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,310
it's him that wants to see you.

961
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:43,551
Come on.

962
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,991
Before your suspenders strangle you.

963
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,670
Quit whistling, it makes me edgy.

964
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,511
Yes, boss.

965
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,516
- Pour me a double on the rocks.
- Sure, boss.

966
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,276
What's funny? You find me amusing?

967
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:27,040
I wasn't smiling at you.

968
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:27,916
Honest, I wasn't.

969
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,479
You find my suit funny?

970
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:30,231
No, boss.

971
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,196
It was your flower.

972
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,230
Yeah, it is kinda droopy.

973
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,476
Yeah, a little.

974
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,679
In fact, it's very droopy.

975
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,639
Very droopy, boss.

976
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,750
Hold it a minute.

977
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:44,429
It needs some water.

978
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,272
Don't ever laugh at me again...

979
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,953
or I'll ram that
smile down your throat.

980
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:53,790
I'm Fat Sam, don't forget
that. Number one man, Mr. Big.

981
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,156
Always have been,
always will be. Now get out.

982
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,076
Careful, the floor is wet.

983
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,111
Hi, honey.

984
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:14,711
Here he is.

985
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,149
Hey, Bugsy.

986
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,076
How you doing, Sam?

987
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,153
Glad to see you.

988
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:22,877
Pull up a chair.

989
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:23,950
Fix him a drink.

990
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,157
A special on the rocks.

991
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,035
What can I do for you?

992
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:29,791
Bugsy...

993
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:30,631
I'm in a jam.

994
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:35,797
Dandy Dan's gonna take
over my organization.

995
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,349
You still got this.

996
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,318
If Dan gets his way,
I won't have a dime.

997
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,550
Can you leave us alone?
This is men's talk.

998
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,036
That's all right,
I'm unshockable.

999
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,070
Go fix your make-up.

1000
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,668
I've already fixed it.

1001
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,110
Then go make yourself
look more beautiful.

1002
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,673
You know that's impossible.

1003
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,190
Anything's possible.

1004
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,551
I'll go and manicure my gloves.

1005
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,670
Bugsy, believe me...

1006
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,554
my gang's gone. My
business is in ruins.

1007
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,434
My friends don't wanna know me.

1008
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:13,671
I'm a wreck.

1009
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,913
In short, I need your help.

1010
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,071
Why me?

1011
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:22,069
'Cause you've got
brains, not pretzels.

1012
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,912
No, it's not my line.

1013
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:33,510
400 dollars.

1014
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:35,756
Do we have a deal?

1015
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:37,431
Hello?

1016
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,797
Bugsy, it's for you.

1017
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,275
I think it's Blousey.

1018
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,111
You got a deal.

1019
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,112
Hold on, he won't be a second.

1020
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:49,750
See you, Bugsy.

1021
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,270
Hello, Blousey.

1022
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,636
What are you doing there?

1023
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:55,511
Just business.

1024
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,630
With Tallulah?

1025
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,559
No, with Fat Sam.

1026
01:10:59,040 --> 01:10:59,916
Did you get the tickets?

1027
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,668
No, you see...

1028
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:03,795
You promised me.

1029
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,551
I know.

1030
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,557
But Hollywood can wait, can't it?

1031
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,995
You had no intention of
taking me to Hollywood!

1032
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:12,470
I do! But there's something
I've got to do first.

1033
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,194
You promised me.

1034
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,712
Trust me. I can't
talk now. I'll call you.

1035
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:22,434
<i>Only a fool...</i>

1036
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:26,434
<i>like fools before me...</i>

1037
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:34,072
<i>I always think with my heart.</i>

1038
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:38,995
<i>Only a fool...</i>

1039
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:43,119
<i>that same old story...</i>

1040
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:50,314
<i>seems I was born</i>
<i>for the part.</i>

1041
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:54,155
<i>It's a lesson that I've learned...</i>

1042
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:59,231
<i>and a page I should have turned.</i>

1043
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:06,839
<i>I shouldn't cry, but I do.</i>

1044
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,993
<i>Like an ordinary fool...</i>

1045
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:16,837
<i>when her ordinary</i>

1046
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:32,708
<i>How many times have I mistaken...</i>

1047
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:34,915
What can you see?

1048
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:49,593
<i>How many times have I mistaken...</i>

1049
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:56,439
<i>love songs and laughs</i>
<i>for the blues.</i>

1050
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,839
<i>When a road I've walked before...</i>

1051
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:05,597
<i>ends alone at my door...</i>

1052
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:13,069
<i>I shouldn't cry, but I do...</i>

1053
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:21,875
<i>when my ordinary dreams</i>
<i>fall through.</i>

1054
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,832
- Splurge guns!
- Where?

1055
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,708
In the crates. Look
what it says on the truck.

1056
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:31,471
I can't.

1057
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:32,430
Can't you read?

1058
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,234
Sure. But I'm short-
sighted. What's it say?

1059
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,638
It says: Splurge
Imports Incorporated.

1060
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,271
Dock 17, East River.

1061
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,910
- Must be where the guns are.
- Right.

1062
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:46,911
Look out!

1063
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,038
<i>It's a lesson that I've learned...</i>

1064
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:55,030
<i>and a page I should have turned...</i>

1065
01:13:55,400 --> 01:14:01,919
<i>I shouldn't cry but I do...</i>

1066
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:06,279
<i>like an ordinary fool...</i>

1067
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:14,114
<i>when her ordinary</i>
<i>dreams fall through.</i>

1068
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,634
Blousey, miss your train?

1069
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,392
What have I done?
Bugsy let you down?

1070
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,793
The broad needs her head testing.

1071
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:24,915
You better believe it.

1072
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,396
Oh, yeah.

1073
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,517
Can I have my job back?

1074
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,590
Sure, the more
the merrier. Go right in.

1075
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,389
Hi, Blousey.

1076
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:38,597
Hi, Blousey.

1077
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,830
Ever see a broad
carry a torch so high?

1078
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,875
Yeah, the Statue of Liberty.

1079
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,429
This must be the place.

1080
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,755
Two guards on the door.

1081
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,276
Two on the roof.

1082
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,716
Two on the pier.

1083
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,351
- What we gonna do?
- Go home?

1084
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,629
There must be a way in.

1085
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,512
Don't be stupid. We'll never get...

1086
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:10,317
past them.

1087
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,111
You're right. Let's go.

1088
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:16,959
What we gonna do, Leroy?

1089
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,269
We need more men.

1090
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,599
We need an army.

1091
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,758
No armies around here.

1092
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,511
Yeah, I know.

1093
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:32,789
Hang on a minute.

1094
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,875
<i>Don't complain about the way</i>

<i>you can't be certain you'll lose...</i>

1119
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,832
<i>till you try.</i>

1120
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,315
<i>So give it a try.</i>

1121
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,188
- Is everybody with me?
- Yeah!

1122
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:06,671
Come on.

1123
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,069
There they are.

1124
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:37,190
This is what we'll do.

1125
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:38,716
Get Baby Face.

1126
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:39,471
Get Baby Face.

1127
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:54,391
Get Baby Face.

1128
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,871
I'm Baby Face. What am I saying?

1129
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,389
I gotta have courage.

1130
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,279
Give this to Baby Face.

1131
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,477
Big courage.

1132
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,430
Give it to Baby Face.

1133
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,279
Thanks. Just what I need.

1134
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,118
Okay, you know what to do.

1135
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,516
I'm scared.

1136
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,359
Will you get out there!

1137
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,471
Yeah, right, get out there.

1138
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,277
I'm a big movie star now.

1139
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,994
Geronimo!

1140
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:58,231
Get that guy.

1141
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:01,910
Dummies.

1142
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,113
Come back here.

1143
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,157
Come on, open the boxes.

1144
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,471
<i>My name is Tallulah,</i>
<i>my first rule of thumb...</i>

1145
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,358
Stop fooling around.

1146
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:53,556
Sorry, Bugsy.

1147
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,592
I don't have to tell you
how important this is.

1148
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,749
This is gonna take
the lid off City Hall.

1149
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,436
- This is the big one.
- The big one.

1150
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,318
The shake-down.

1151
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,112
The shake-down.

1152
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,391
The pay-off.

1153
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,236
The pay off.

1154
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:14,670
It's got to be good.

1155
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,914
It's got to be good,
it's got to be neat...

1156
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,519
Quit repeating everything!

1157
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:22,715
You shouldn't have any trouble.

1158
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,151
Just Fat Sam and
a few dance hall girls.

1159
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,077
Good luck and off we go.

1160
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,674
Three cheers for Dandy Dan.

1161
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,399
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

1162
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,033
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

1163
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,713
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

1164
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,518
Too kind, guys.

1165
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,513
Jelly, Jelly, open up!

1166
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:18,954
They're here!

1167
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,391
Just act normal.

1168
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,035
Get to work.

1169
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,114
Girls, off you go.

1170
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,278
Razzmatazz, let's
hear some music.

1171
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,276
Okay, this is our moment.

1172
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,270
Keep a cool head and
keep those fingers pumping.

1173
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,508
Remember, you'll be writing history.

1174
01:22:58,240 --> 01:22:59,639
<i>Fat Sam ain't humble...</i>

1175
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,990
<i>but it's your home sweet home...</i>

1176
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,394
<i>plans are made here...</i>

1177
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,159
Okay, everybody, freeze.

1178
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,992
Let them have it.

1179
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:02,390
Amazing scenes...

1180
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,357
have been reported
on the lower East side.

1181
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,151
It's been a frightful bad show.

1182
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,034
So, this is show business?

1183
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:53,878
<i>We could've been</i>
<i>anything we wanted...</i>

1184
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,468
<i>and it's not too</i>
<i>late to change...</i>

1185
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:06,150
<i>I'd be delighted...</i>

1186
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,753
<i>to give it some thought...</i>

1187
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:12,869
<i>maybe you'll agree</i>
<i>that we really ought...</i>

1188
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:19,838
<i>We could've been</i>
<i>anything we wanted...</i>

1189
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,591
<i>that decision is ours...</i>

1190
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,873
<i>it's been decided,</i>
<i>we're weaker divided...</i>

1193
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,474
<i>and I'm not saying we should...</i>

1194
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,109
<i>but if we tried it...</i>

1195
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,628
<i>we could be the best...</i>

1196
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,791
<i>at being good guys.</i>

1197
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,553
<i>Flowers of the earth...</i>

1198
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,037
<i>who can guess how much...</i>

1199
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,270
<i>a real friend is worth.</i>

1200
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,431
<i>Good guys...</i>

1201
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,272
<i>shake an open hand...</i>

1202
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,638
<i>maybe we'll be trusting...</i>

1203
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,711
<i>if we try to understand.</i>

1204
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,714
<i>No doubt about it...</i>

1205
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,836
<i>it must be worthwhile...</i>

1206
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,712
<i>friends tend to make you smile.</i>

1207
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,513
<i>We could've been anything...</i>

1208
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,750
<i>that we wanted to be.</i>

1209
