1
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,080
Good morning, it's 7:00 a.m.

2
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,360
Got the Godfa ther of Soul comin' at you
and he wants to know, how do you feel?

3
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,320
Anybody home?

4
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,520
- You the foreman?
- Yeah, I'm the foreman. I don't want any.

5
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,320
- I'm your new carpenter.
- What?

6
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,360
I read the ad in the newspaper
for carpenters. Here I am.

7
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,760
No, no. We filled that job.
Got a full house, buddy. Sorry.

8
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,440
You're making a big mistake here.
I'm a precision machine, man!

9
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,280
I can do twice the work
of any of these guys. I swear.

10
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Great. I'll alert the media.

11
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,360
- The media?
- The media.

12
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,840
- East Coast?
- Yeah.

13
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,080
New York, upstate? Syracuse?

14
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,920
Where?

15
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,400
- I'm from Binghamton.
- Binghamton! I was close!

16
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,880
I don't believe this!

17
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,760
What?

18
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,800
Look.

19
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,440
Give me this. This first day,
I work for free.

20
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,960
I give it to you, it's a gift.
Second day, you pay me for two days.

21
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,760
Third day, I have your job.

22
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,040
- One day! One day!
- All right. One day.

23
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,120
- Start upstairs. On the roof.
- Thanks. You're a good man.

24
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,560
Binghamton! Man, I'm embarrassed!

25
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,560
Where do I go, man? Give me a job!

26
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,960
- Work with him.
- Okay.

27
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,520
Hey, guys!

28
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,760
What's your name, man?

29
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,160
Howard. What's yours?

30
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,720
What the fuck are you doing?

31
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,920
Seven kids.

32
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,880
- Right.
- Right. You got it. Boys, girls?

33
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,680
- Five girls, two boys.
- That's great, man. That's great.

34
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,920
- Congratulations.
- All right.

35
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,720
A lot of mouths to feed there.

36
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,960
You got that right.

37
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,600
Take them all out to dinner. Do that.

38
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,840
- What's this?
- I just found it on the street. It's $100.

39
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,760
- Just take them out to dinner.
- I'm not taking your money.

40
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,040
No, really. I'll tell you what happened.
It's the truth.

41
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,960
I'm walking down the street,
I look down and there it is.

42
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,520
I bend down to pick it up...

43
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,880
a voice out of nowhere says,
"Give it to Howard".

44
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,120
I didn't know a Howard until today!
It must be you! Your lucky day.

45
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,360
- I'm not taking your money.
- Take the money! It's not a big deal.

46
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,000
Take it! For the kids.

47
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,520
Take them to dinner.
A couple of Big Macs.

48
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,040
"I feel good

49
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,720
"Like I knew that I would now

50
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,160
"I feel good"

51
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,680
You like chop suey?

52
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,960
I'll make it up to you. Trust me.

53
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,440
Hello? Hi.

54
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,440
How are you?

55
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,040
Fine. Yeah.

56
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Tonight?

57
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,760
Tonight's fine. No!
No, nothing that I can't cancel.

58
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,560
Okay. So, I guess I'll see you tonight, then.
Okay. 'Bye.

59
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,840
Come on up, man.

60
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,400
Look at this shit.

61
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,440
Man! Do you ever feel like flying, Howard?
Just taking off?

62
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,440
- Just fly away!
- Why the hell not?

63
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,600
Fly.

64
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,360
"Why the hell not?"
Exactly, why the hell not?

65
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,640
No goddamn reason why not, Howard.

66
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,040
What are you doing, man?

67
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,040
Now, if you look at the situation here...

68
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,480
what we got here is a roof...

69
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,600
75° pitch, which is very nice.

70
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,680
I wouldn't go no further, man.

71
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,560
What we're looking for here is a balance.

72
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,000
All we gotta do is find a little...

73
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,240
equilibrium.

74
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,520
We got the westerlies coming in.
Fourteen, fifteen miles an hour.

75
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,440
Come on. Step back here, man.

76
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,280
Howard, let me tell you something, man.
This is basic physics, okay?

77
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,520
All you gotta do is find
a little equilibrium here.

78
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,160
Some equilibrium and a little balance.

79
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,960
Give me a rope, somebody.
Give me a rope!

80
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,400
It's equilibrium. Balance, Howard.
Lots of balance. Balance.

81
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,280
- Balance.
- Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed.

82
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,560
Balance....

83
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,240
The force of the thrust against the drag.

84
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,720
And then you get lift-off!

85
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,560
- Feels good?
- It feels great!

86
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,880
- Come on, baby!
- I'm coming!

87
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,400
It's all right! I'll take care of you.

88
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,720
- We're gonna fly!
- I know. We gonna fly!

89
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,560
Yes, indeed. We gonna fly.

90
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,080
Got the drag on there.

91
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,920
- Got the drag on, man.
- I feel it.

92
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,960
Now don't turn away from me!
Come here!

93
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,640
- Talk to me.
- Here we come!

94
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,160
Don't move away from me!

95
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,000
- Stay with me.
- Here we come!

96
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,560
Don't go no further! Don't go no further!

97
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,680
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to do this, man. Okay?

98
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,640
Come on, come on.

99
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,360
Stay right there. Let me talk to you.
Just stay right there.

100
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm a plane! I'm gonna swoop down!
I'm gonna fly!

101
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,360
- Howard?
- Look at me, man. Look at me.

102
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,240
This is what we're gonna do.

103
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,280
We're gonna fly down,
come around the front of the ambulance...

104
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,320
come around the back.
I'm gonna land right on that bed!

105
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,320
In fact, I'll go around it three times
and then let down!

106
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,800
So just move the bed around a little bit!
I'll slide right in!

107
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,320
- You're late.
- You're later. She'll be mad.

108
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,720
I'm terrified.

109
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,760
The Psychiatric Emergency Room is closed
almost daily because of the staff cuts.

110
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,160
The situation here...

111
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,400
is also dire.

112
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,880
Our unofficial policy is evaluate...

113
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,880
medicate, vacate.

114
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,520
Sound cold-blooded?

115
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
It is.

116
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,480
They need the treatment
and we need the beds.

117
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,720
At this point, I'd like to turn you over
to two of my staff...

118
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,360
Dr. Elizabeth Bowen and Dr. Patrick Shea.

119
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,440
They'll show you around the facilities.

120
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,480
I trust you'll enjoy your visit. Thank you.

121
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,360
- Good morning.
- Good afternoon.

122
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,680
In the years 1970 to 1975,
four US mental hospitals....

123
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,960
I must speak with....

124
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,800
Okay. Welcome.
That was our good friend, Mr. Wilson.

125
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,640
Dr. Bowen and I will be going on rounds,
so follow us, please.

126
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,560
Come in. Move around there,
let everyone in. Don't be shy.

127
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,280
He won't bite, we hope.

128
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,000
What have we got here?

129
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,080
We have a male Caucasian.

130
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,920
He's approximately 35.
Was brought in by the police.

131
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
He was doing a high-wire act on a roof.

132
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,360
When he came in, he was highly agitated,
delusional, having auditory hallucinations.

133
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,600
Has anyone examined him yet?

134
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,120
The resident made a preliminary diagnosis
of paranoid schizophrenia.

135
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,160
What did they give him?

136
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,520
Haldol, 10 milligrams. That's pretty heavy.
It seems to have worked.

137
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,160
This is a new patient.
What's the first thing we do?

138
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,400
- Assess the patient's orientation.
- Very good, very good. Elizabeth?

139
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,320
Can you tell me your name?

140
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,960
No name, no history.
No one on the job knew him.

141
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,000
Do you know what day this is?

142
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,640
What?

143
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,760
Jones.

144
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,280
What'd he say?

145
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,360
I think he said, "Jones".
His name is Jones.

146
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,320
Jones....

147
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,160
- Hi.
- Hi.

148
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,040
I'm so glad to see you.

149
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,000
What did you do to your hair?

150
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,560
- You look great! You look wonderful!
- Thanks. Is this a bad time?

151
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,680
No, no. The painting's in the bedroom.
And, you have....

152
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,120
You have some mail.

153
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,920
- Libbie....
- Hi.

154
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,320
This is June.

155
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,760
It's so nice to meet you.

156
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,840
You know, it's been six months, Libbie.

157
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,440
I just thought it was time
you should meet her.

158
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,000
Take your crap out of the medicine cabinet,
while you're at it.

159
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,360
All right, okay.

160
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,440
You're a robot, you know that?

161
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,080
I can't hear you.

162
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,280
You're not a real person.

163
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,120
Only a mutant would pull a stunt like this.

164
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,000
Are you talking to yourself, Libbie?

165
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,120
Yeah, I'm talking to myself.

166
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,240
Who would have thought
that I'd be on the Johnny Carson Show?

167
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,680
Did you know, when I was born...

168
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,000
l didn't have a name
till I was 3 years old?

169
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,880
Why?

170
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,880
Because my father,
who's this really rigid old Chinese guy...

171
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,600
told me that when I was little,
there was an ancient Chinese tradition...

172
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,160
where the unborn child knows its name
before it's even born.

173
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,000
So the parents listen for it
and they try to get the name.

174
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,200
Obviously, in my case,
they couldn't hear it.

175
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,040
It's not like they weren't listening,
it was on purpose.

176
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,240
My mother wanted to name me Miranda
because she liked to dress like that.

177
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,520
With fruit and stuff.... I mean, hats!
I don't understand these hats.

178
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,480
But she couldn't say, "Miranda" because
it was "Melanda" and didn't sound right.

179
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,720
She wanted to avoid
the whole "L" and "R" thing.

180
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,120
So they called me Amanda. Amanda!

181
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,600
She's never understood me.

182
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,840
She always has this...

183
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,160
big smile on her face!

184
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,320
As if nothing's wrong,
as if everything is okay.

185
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Always.

186
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,720
My work is very important.
The Pentagon is aware of this.

187
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,200
I have received communication
from CBS News, 6:30 p.m., every night.

188
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,400
"Mr. Wilson? Mr. Wilson? Where are you?
Where are you?"

189
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,840
I cannot return the communication
if my mind is clouded...

190
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,480
and if poison is being placed in my food!

191
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,160
"I'm late, I'm late
For a very important date"

192
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,680
Hi, I'm a doctor! I'm also a "lateaholic".
I'm late! I work late!

193
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,640
I get up late. I sleep late. I eat late.
It's too damn late to do anything about it.

194
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,440
- Mr. Jones?
- Where? Where? Get the net!

195
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,920
- Are you leaving us?
- Yes! Yes! I am leaving!

196
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,760
How are you feeling?

197
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,720
Did you do that to your husband
every morning? "How are you feeling?"

198
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,200
I bet that just popped him right up
out of bed, didn't it?

199
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,240
You're wondering how I knew
you were married?

200
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Elementary, my dear Miss Watson.
May I have your hand?

201
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,560
A slight discoloration on the ring finger.

202
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,520
And this rather fragile air about you
as if you've been recently damaged.

203
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,040
- Beautiful accent though. Swedish, isn't it?
- Yes.

204
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,800
I find your country to be very lovely.
Cold, but....

205
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,960
- 'Bye, Elizabeth.
- How'd you know my name?

206
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,200
Have you tried the drugs here?
You should, you know.

207
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,840
You shouldn't be allowed to prescribe
unless you know.

208
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,080
You see, because we hear
everything in the room.

209
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,440
- Be careful what you say.
- Sorry we didn't get to talk.

210
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,840
Yeah, I'm sorry too. I'm sorry. Sorry.
We could talk. We could talk.

211
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,360
Do you like choral music?
Beethoven: Ninth Symphony, Ode to Joy?

212
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,800
You could use a little joy. I know I could.
I got tickets tonight.

213
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,680
We'll go. We'll fill our empty hearts.
We'll find an all-night cafe.

214
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,640
We'll be there all night long talking
as long as you want. What do you say?

215
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,600
Try, "yes". Give me your number.
I'll call you.

216
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,200
I didn't mean that.

217
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,680
- What did you mean?
- I mean, we could talk.

218
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,600
We are talking. But you need to talk.
I want you to talk.

219
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,960
We should talk here.

220
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,960
You were very distressed yesterday.
I think you need treatment.

221
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,400
- Yes, late! Late! Gotta go!
- Here's my card.

222
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,920
- Will you please call me?
- Absolutely! "Dr. Elizabeth Bowen!"

223
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,480
- Good-bye! Late! Gotta go!
- Will you call?

224
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,320
Yeah, probably not.

225
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,840
This was a standard-procedure release.
What's the problem here?

226
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,200
- I think he was misdiagnosed.
- How so?

227
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,840
He was psychotic but not schizophrenic.
He was expansive...

228
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,720
intrusive, inappropriate, euphoric.
I think he's a manic.

229
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,720
Okay, fine. Fine. He's manic.
You know, the guy refused medication.

230
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,640
It would've meant a hearing.
We would've lost.

231
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,960
Give him a few more hours
and he'll think he can fly again.

232
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,520
"I feel good

233
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,280
"Like I knew that I would now

234
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,000
"I feel good

235
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,440
"Like I knew that I would now

236
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,880
"I feel good

237
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,200
"So good

238
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,520
"I got you"

239
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,080
- She didn't have an account number...
- She said you were rude.

240
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,880
I just asked for verification.

241
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,000
We're the second largest
savings institution in this state.

242
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,800
We didn't get that way by being snotty.

243
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,360
You have a customer.

244
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,640
Hi, can I help you, sir?

245
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,480
Yes, I would like a double cheeseburger,
fries and a chocolate shake.

246
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,360
Just kidding.

247
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,000
- I'd like to close my account, please.
- You just opened this account last week.

248
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,080
Yeah, I'm a fickle kind of guy.

249
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,040
Oh, my goodness.

250
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,840
Okay, you have $12,752 in your account.
Do you want that in hundreds?

251
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,000
I'll leave that up
to your impeccable judgement.

252
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,280
I just want to make sure that
I have a nice big fat wad of fives...

253
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,080
for all the valet parking I plan to do.

254
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,400
- Don't forget the interest.
- Certainly.

255
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,600
- On five days?
- Yeah.

256
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,880
- That's 5.5 percent....
- That would be....

257
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,960
Compounded daily, that is $9.60.

258
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,080
- How did you do that?
- It's easy. It's so easy. So easy.

259
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,200
- Keep one of those hundreds for yourself.
- I can't do that!

260
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,040
- No, you're gonna need it.
- I am? Why?

261
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,000
You're taking me to lunch.

262
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,120
We need his-and-hers chilidogs!
His-and-hers, with all the fixings.

263
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,320
One for the lady, coming up. One more.

264
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,800
Here you go.

265
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,800
- Are you nuts? I can't break a $100 bill.
- Keep the change.

266
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,760
Music heaven.

267
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,520
This is a body. These are bodies.
They're women's bodies.

268
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,280
All over here. Look at this.

269
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,680
30-percent off before the sale,
another 25-percent off....

270
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,520
You can take this piano home
for less than half...

271
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,240
I hear Bach.

272
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,280
Excuse me.

273
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,880
I'm hearing it also.

274
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,360
- No. Can you play it faster? Really fast?
- Absolutely!

275
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,720
Sold?

276
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,840
A piano....

277
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,840
More. We need more.
More piano. More piano.

278
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,040
- What's your name, man?
- Pedro.

279
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,440
Pedro, have fun.

280
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,720
- Thank you.
- Get out of here.

281
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,960
Thank you, sir. If there's anything else
you need, just let me know.

282
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,640
I mean, you know, men will say that
you're good, but I know I'm good.

283
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,800
Totally uninhibited.

284
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,920
Very smooth.

285
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,520
I make a lot of noise.

286
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,000
They like that.

287
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,040
I pretend that I'm out of control.

288
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,040
I always pretend that I'm out of control,
but I'm never out of control.

289
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,560
You know what I mean?
I'm never out of control.

290
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,200
It isn't that far! Come on.

291
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,240
- Maybe we should go to the hotel.
- Stay here.

292
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,720
- Buddy, can you spare some change?
- Sure. Here.

293
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,160
- Here you go, here you go.
- Hey, thanks, man.

294
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,640
You like that music, huh?

295
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,840
All men are brothers...

296
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,680
- What are you, a musician?
- ...beneath your soft wings.

297
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,880
No. No, but I was a music student.

298
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,560
I had this wonderful,
beautiful girlfriend named Ellen.

299
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,280
And she was a composer.
She was really an extraordinary person.

300
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,120
- I think of her all the time.
- What happened?

301
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,600
- She died. It's okay.
- I'm very sorry.

302
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,520
- Point it out.
- The second row.

303
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,200
Careful with the boots!

304
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,080
They got weights on them!
Look at the boots!

305
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,240
Hey, flying boots! Fly! Fly! Fly!

306
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,200
I'm relaxed! It's too tight!

307
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,280
It's too tight. I'm not struggling, all right?

308
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,440
It's too tight. It's too tight. I can't....

309
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,800
You two, come here. Come here a second.
I want to talk to you!

310
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,440
I have a doctor here! I have a doctor!

311
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,760
Dr. Elizabeth Bowen! I have a doctor!

312
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,480
Give me that. Give me that.

313
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,880
Come back, come back.
Zero, zero. Zero, zero, three, three.

314
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,160
Surprise, surprise. I know, I know.
Don't even say it.

315
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,360
It's like trying to stop a space shuttle
with a rubber band.

316
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,120
What did you give him?

317
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,800
- Well, we waited for you.
- Why?

318
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,240
Well, you're his doctor.

319
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,600
Mr. Jones.

320
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,200
Mr. Jones?

321
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,000
Elizabeth.

322
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,880
- You gotta get me out of here.
- I can't do that.

323
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,160
Not right now.

324
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,120
Right. I know the rules.
Seventy-two hours. I know.

325
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,320
But you can do it. You can do it. Please?
Please? Please, I'm dying!

326
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,760
- Get me the fuck out of here.
- Mr. Jones, you have a disease.

327
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,080
Manic-depressive disorder.

328
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,960
It's like having diabetes.

329
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,680
No shit! And here I thought
I was just having a bad day!

330
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,600
It's a highly treatable chemical imbalance.

331
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,680
- We've had a great deal of success...
- Look, fuck-face!

332
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,760
I have been in and out of hospitals
for 20 years!

333
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,760
There are two words that I really
do not appreciate!

334
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,040
One is "great," the other "success".

335
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,960
I'm going to tell you something.

336
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,320
Both of you listen,
you might learn something.

337
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,160
It is not a disease! Okay?
Not a disease! I do not have a disease.

338
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,160
This is who I am! I like who I am!
You got it?

339
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,600
Forget it. Don't even think
about that fucking needle!

340
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,080
I'll give you some medication
so you won't hurt yourself.

341
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,600
I'm not hurting myself,
they're hurting myself.

342
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,320
- Look, Mr. Jones....
- What?

343
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,600
- You're here?
- Yeah.

344
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,320
- You asked for me?
- Yes.

345
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,520
I came.

346
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,480
You did come. Thank you.
You've made me very happy. Thank you.

347
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,640
- Now, you're very agitated.
- I am agitated.

348
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,400
- And very tired.
- I'm not tired! I'm not tired.

349
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,800
I'd like to give you something
to help you rest.

350
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,440
Forget the Haldol! I'm not taking Haldol.
Forget it!

351
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,720
That's not Haldol.

352
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,280
- What is it?
- This is Amytal.

353
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,640
- You've heard of it?
- Yeah.

354
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,360
- It's a sedative.
- It's good.

355
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,320
- You'll sleep.
- I know what it is.

356
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,840
- Something to help you rest.
- To help me rest.

357
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,520
Okay?

358
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,440
Okay. You're awfully pretty
when you smile.

359
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,640
Here. Let me help you out.

360
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,560
This is going to be good.

361
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,280
Glass of Chardonnay?

362
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,320
Think of this as a whole bottle.

363
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,440
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I enjoyed that.

364
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,360
Now you'll go home...

365
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,280
and have some wine.

366
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,800
I'll have a glass of wine.

367
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,240
You'll think of me and have some wine.

368
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,200
I'll think of you getting better.

369
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,800
Okay. I'll rest, but I won't sleep.

370
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,960
- You don't have to sleep.
- Thank you very much.

371
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,840
You're pretty. Elizabeth, my Elizabeth.

372
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Okay.

373
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,080
Elizabeth, where do they all go?

374
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,640
Where did he go? He was 18.

375
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,320
Where did he go?

376
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,840
Where...? Mommy?

377
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,280
I had such a bad dream.

378
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,560
Do you understand why you're here?

379
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,520
Yes. This is a competency hearing.

380
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,800
Do you understand the consequences
of these proceedings?

381
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:09,000
Yes, I do. I am facing involuntary
commitment to a mental hospital...

382
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,080
with indeterminate release.

383
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,360
Attorney, you may proceed.

384
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,560
- Please state your name.
- Dr. Elizabeth Bowen.

385
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,320
And Dr. Bowen, are you board-certified
to practice in this state?

386
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,560
Yes, I am.

387
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,240
Why do you think Mr. Jones should be
on a hold?

388
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,960
I believe that he is suffering from
bipolar manic-depressive disorder...

389
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,960
and he's currently in a manic cycle.

390
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,720
What behaviours or attitudes can
you report to support this assumption?

391
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,200
Two incidents.

392
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,600
In the first, he had to be restrained
on a roof for his own safety...

393
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,640
after claiming he was going to fly.

394
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,440
It's actually, it was a fairly creative act,
if you keep your mind open.

395
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,640
Okay, all right. Sorry.

396
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,200
In the second, he was brought to us
by the police...

397
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,760
after disrupting a symphony orchestra.

398
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,760
Excuse me, is the original conductor
here also?

399
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,000
Mr. Jones, please.
You'll have an opportunity to respond.

400
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,400
Thank you. Thank you very much,
Your Honour.

401
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,960
Continue, Dr. Bowen.

402
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,240
I think that his judgement is impaired
and that he is a danger to himself.

403
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,520
In what way?

404
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,440
The manic state is usually followed
by depression.

405
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,840
What are the symptoms of depression?

406
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,240
Hopelessness. Despair.

407
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,080
The inability to experience pleasure,
the inability to function.

408
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,640
Mr. Jones?

409
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,200
"Despair". "Hopelessness".

410
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,520
"The inability to experience pleasure".

411
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,000
Now, Doctor...

412
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,600
are these words and phrases that come...

413
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,880
spontaneously to you
when you look at me?

414
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,840
Are they? I don't think so.

415
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,280
I deeply respect Dr. Bowen.
She is a wonderful doctor.

416
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,880
I respect her and her advice,
but I graciously say no.

417
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,080
No, thank you.

418
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,840
The fact is, that the doctor and the other
fine healers have decided that I'm bipolar...

419
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,800
and this is without regard to the fact
that they have not one shred of evidence.

420
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,960
They've never observed me
once have a depressive symptom.

421
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,080
- Is that not true?
- Yes.

422
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,600
Thank you very much. Now, the fact is,
maybe I never get the blues.

423
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,840
Maybe I'm just a happy-go-lucky guy
all the time.

424
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,040
Your Honour, the truth is,
this is a very simple case.

425
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,080
If we go to the issues and see the case
on its merits, it's very simple.

426
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,920
Now the fact is
I'm a productive human being.

427
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,840
Last year in this country alone...

428
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,920
over 75,000 people suffering
from depression killed themselves.

429
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,880
Your Honour? Your Honour,
will you please look at me?

430
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,680
Do I look suicidal?

431
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,400
What do you have to say
about these incidents...

432
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,400
that Dr. Bowen mentioned?

433
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,280
Like the flying scam? I talked about it.

434
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,760
This is not a big deal!
This is nothing! It's kid's stuff!

435
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,560
I'm a big personality! I'm grandiose!

436
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,280
I'm a kid, all right? I always will be.
I'm sorry.

437
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,920
Your Honour, I swear....

438
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,520
I swear on my life...

439
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,520
l could have done a better job conducting
that Beethoven piece. I mean it!

440
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,280
Please? Please, Your Honour?

441
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,440
Please, Your Honour,
please do not lock me up.

442
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,760
You don't have to do this.
I promise I'll be a good boy.

443
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,640
There are people who really are sick
and need that bed more than I do.

444
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,400
Sit down, Mr. Jones.

445
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,400
Okay. I just want to thank you again.
Thank you, Your Honour.

446
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,360
Want to go bowling?

447
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,360
Do you want to do me a favour?

448
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,000
Next time you're in trouble,
don't ask for me. I'm a busy person.

449
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,440
I didn't expect you'd be a bad loser.

450
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,280
We're not competing.

451
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,440
What is going on here?

452
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,720
I was fighting for freedom in there.
I don't know what you're in this for.

453
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,960
Tell me something. Do you crash?

454
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,160
What?

455
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,040
Do you get suicidal?

456
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,760
Do you?

457
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,160
How can I get suicidal?
I have my little friends here. Lithium.

458
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,760
Four a day, every day...

459
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,880
keeps those highs and lows away.

460
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,160
If you take them.

461
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,040
Elizabeth. Elizabeth, wait a second.

462
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,720
I'd be happy to make an appointment
with you if you want.

463
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,640
I'm worried about you.
Something happened.

464
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,920
- Good-bye.
- Is it your ex?

465
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,240
Take your medicine, pay your taxes....

466
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,520
Is his girlfriend pregnant?

467
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,360
She's not pregnant.
You know nothing about me.

468
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,720
Is it the yuppie doctor?
Is he hitting on you?

469
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,560
I don't know how I shall put this. Shut up!

470
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,880
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

471
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,040
What are you doing?

472
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,600
I don't live very far from here.
I thought maybe you could give me a ride.

473
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,680
I'm a psychiatrist. If you have
a psychiatric problem, call me.

474
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,120
If you have a transportation problem,
you call a cab, okay?

475
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,880
I guess maybe I do have a problem.

476
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,280
I don't have any money.

477
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,120
So, tell me. When did you
first notice the symptoms?

478
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,120
- Elizabeth, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

479
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,200
Good.

480
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,800
Say you go to the theatre tonight, right?

481
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,440
You go to the theatre.
You run into your gynaecologist.

482
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,680
He says to you:

483
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,320
"Good evening, Elizabeth,
are you enjoying the play?

484
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,840
"How about that little condition
you came to me about last week?

485
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,840
- "Let's have a look".
- It's not the same.

486
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,560
It's exactly the same thing!

487
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,440
You're at the theatre, with your dress up....

488
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,240
Me, on a beautiful day like this,
with a woman like you....

489
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,800
It's exactly the same thing.

490
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,160
The minute the doctor shows up,
and starts poking around in things...

491
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,400
that he or she is uninvited
to be poking around in, it's rude.

492
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,280
I guess I never thought of it that way.

493
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,680
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

494
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,080
- Yeah. I'll forgive you.
- Thanks.

495
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,480
- If you feed me.
- I can't.

496
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Can't? This is America.
You can do anything you want!

497
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,720
- I have appointments!
- I have hunger.

498
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,880
Mucho hunger.

499
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,000
I really can't.

500
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,880
Who needs you more today than me?

501
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,520
There can't be anyone. I'm desperate.

502
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,120
You want to do this, I know you do.

503
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,400
There! There it is!

504
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,920
You see it? The road to forgiveness.

505
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,880
I'll talk about me. I will.

506
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,200
Just turn. Come on.

507
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,440
Yes! I knew it! I knew she'd do it! Yes!

508
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,960
So, what were you doing
on the stage that night?

509
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,760
Picking up the tempo.

510
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,600
Why would you do that?

511
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,160
Look, Ode to Joy was meant
to be played allegro vivace:

512
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,800
Quickly, with life.

513
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,040
Beethoven might have been stone deaf,
but he had an impeccable sense of time.

514
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,960
If he wasn't dead, he'd have dragged
that bastard offstage.

515
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,960
Truth be known, I was just there
protecting my friend Ludwig.

516
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,760
- You know a lot about music, don't you?
- Yeah, yeah.

517
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,320
Do you play?

518
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,240
There. Go ahead.

519
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,040
Have you ever played?

520
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,880
- Shall we dance?
- No way.

521
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,400
Come on, Elizabeth! A couple of steps up,
everything's different.

522
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,120
I don't want different.

523
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,320
Want to know who I am?
You gotta go where I am.

524
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,920
If you don't get down right now, I'm going.

525
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,440
It's all right. Fear is allowed here.

526
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,160
It's just that I even get dizzy in high heels.

527
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,280
I know it's silly.
I know it's just a childhood thing.

528
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,760
There's nothing I can do about it.

529
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,200
Do you ever have flying dreams?

530
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,320
I don't know. Maybe when I was a kid.

531
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,880
You know, interesting.

532
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,840
I've asked that question all over the world
and everyone says the same thing.

533
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,160
Why is it only children have flying dreams?

534
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,280
She's late. She's late.

535
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
Not yet.

536
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,680
How did you get started?

537
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,000
A little psychiatric kit
for Christmas one year?

538
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,760
No.

539
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,360
Why'd you give up dancing?

540
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,720
How'd you know that?

541
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,200
The feet! You got crunched toes
heading east and west...

542
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,440
and you walk like a duck
when you're not paying any attention.

543
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,560
- I don't.
- You do! It's cute. I like it.

544
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,400
You still dance?

545
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,280
- What do you mean, "east and west"?
- Look at them!

546
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,680
If your legs followed your feet,
you'd split in half.

547
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,320
Were you a little ballerina
with ribbons in your hair?

548
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,480
- They do not.
- They do!

549
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,560
What happened to her?
This "Little Miss Twinkletoes"?

550
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,120
I had a wild couple of months
where every morning I'd wake up...

551
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,560
and something was different.

552
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,480
Like somebody was stretching
my body parts when I was asleep.

553
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,960
I felt like I had arms down to my knees
and a neck about 18-inches long.

554
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,200
I didn't even want to leave my room.

555
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,200
I thought I looked like Lurch,
from the Addams Family.

556
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,480
Yes, I know.

557
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,040
- It's hell, isn't it?
- What?

558
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,960
Growing up.

559
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,440
Yeah. It stinks.

560
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,800
My new boots! Damn!

561
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,760
Yeah. Home sweet home.

562
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,840
You're an interesting man, Mr. Jones.

563
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,040
- Would you want to make me ordinary?
- No.

564
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,000
I want you to be well.

565
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,080
"Well"? I'm well, believe me.
I am ecstatic.

566
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,440
You want to cure me of that?

567
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,600
That's just your chemistry talking.

568
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,880
Chemistry again?

569
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,800
It's all chemical.
The whole universe is chemical.

570
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,960
You're chemicals. I'm chemicals.

571
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,240
Love, sadness, pain, grief.

572
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,760
If I touch you, touch you here...

573
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,200
you feel something, right?

574
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
If I touch you back here....

575
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,200
Lean forward a little bit.

576
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,760
Lean forward. Drop your head.
Drop your head a little more.

577
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,240
Right there.

578
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,360
You hold your tension right there,
don't you?

579
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,720
Just an observation.

580
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,120
- Wonderful afternoon, wasn't it?
- Yes.

581
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,000
Thanks for the ride.

582
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,320
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

583
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,200
Mr. Jones!

584
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,920
Your chemicals.

585
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,800
- All right. Then 3:00.
- That's good.

586
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,640
- What do you want?
- I just want my tools, that's all.

587
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,480
Don't worry about your tools.
Worry about staying out of trouble.

588
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,920
I wanted to thank you
about giving me the chance.

589
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,920
- No problem.
- I'm sorry, I was a little strange.

590
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,080
- Why don't you get lost?
- Maybe you could give me another chance.

591
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,720
Hey, pal, I'm telling you,
why don't you get lost, all right?

592
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,560
You gotta be fucking joking,
you fucking lunatic.

593
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,200
I'll come back tomorrow. That's better.
That's a lot better. Okay?

594
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,520
I'll come back.... What about my tools?

595
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,080
Hey, man.

596
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,680
How you feeling?

597
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,920
I'm okay. I appreciate what you did for me.

598
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,880
That's all right. Listen, I got your tools
at the house. You want to come get them?

599
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,440
Okay, everybody. All right, Peytan,
you lead everybody in grace.

600
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,080
Thank you for the food
that we're blessed to have.

601
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,640
Thank you for our health, our home...

602
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,440
and our family. Amen.

603
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,880
Mr. Jones, may I have your plate, please?

604
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,760
Pass that glass down.

605
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,920
Pass that glass down.

606
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,920
Hi, kid.

607
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,200
What's up?

608
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,400
Do you know how to do this?

609
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,280
What do you got there, math?

610
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,040
All right, now the thing you gotta
remember about long division...

611
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,680
is that it's short division,
just smaller numbers.

612
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,400
I can do this.

613
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,560
Hello, yeah. I understand you're the doctor
who's treating Mr. Jones?

614
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,760
What can I do for you?

615
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,360
You know, Doctor!

616
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,640
What?

617
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,640
I don't know, he seems
like he's really having some problems.

618
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,640
Mr. Jones.

619
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,960
I can't stop the sadness!

620
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,840
It's all right. It's all right.

621
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,120
"Taking showers used to be a bore

622
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,840
"Now it isn't boring anymore

623
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,040
"'Cause the shower situation
stimulates imagination

624
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,560
"And I found my inspiration in the shower"

625
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,040
You can join in anytime.
We can do this as a round, if you'd like.

626
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,040
"Taking showers..."

627
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,640
My dad and I had a fight.

628
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,360
My mother was crying.

629
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,080
And I stayed up all night waiting.

630
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,200
I broke their hearts.

631
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,080
Are you taping this?

632
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,320
Yeah.

633
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,080
Do you mind?

634
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,560
Doesn't matter.

635
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,600
Mr. Jones, the way I see it,
we're dealing with two problems here.

636
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,400
One is chemical, and we're treating that.

637
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,440
And the other one is...

638
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,760
I think...

639
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,840
your pain.

640
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:37,560
It'll take hard work
for us to get at those feelings.

641
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,480
Do you understand?

642
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,640
Will you work with me?

643
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,640
Do we have a deal?

644
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,160
Now, what we want to do is
let our movement express how we feel.

645
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,600
Okay? Let yourself move
through the space...

646
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,800
and express your inner life.

647
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Okay, just be gentle, all right?

648
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,800
That's right. Yeah. Just let it out.

649
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:11,120
Just let it come up somehow. It's in here?
It's in there? Just let it out.

650
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,480
Mr. Jones? What are you being?

651
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,320
An erection.

652
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,360
I have no memory.

653
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,640
You can't remember anything?

654
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,960
Sometimes.

655
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,200
What happens when
you can't remember anything?

656
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,040
I can't stop. It makes me....

657
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,080
Good.

658
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,360
Very good.

659
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,560
Mr. Jones, how about you?
Don't you want to paint something?

660
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,000
This is your opportunity
to really express yourself.

661
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,000
Tell me about the first time
you got into trouble.

662
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,400
Okay.

663
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,480
Now I will tell you the first time...

664
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,720
l got into trouble.

665
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,360
I was working in a construction crew,
building tract houses.

666
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,080
And I was a pretty tough guy
and I was getting into things...

667
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,560
with guys, and no one was gonna
mess with me 'cause I was very tough.

668
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,280
I was a tough guy.
I am a very, very tough guy.

669
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,360
At the same time, I was also like going out
with a really groovy girl named Ellen.

670
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,440
And, Ellen went and died, you know.

671
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,040
And then I did things that weren't good.

672
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,400
And I broke things and hit people and stuff.

673
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,360
Then they took me tojail, right?
So they took me tojail...

674
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,120
and I'm sitting injail,
then I'm climbing the bars...

675
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,080
and I'm like doing stuff
and I'm climbing up there...

676
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,720
and I'm screaming out
that I'm King Kong.

677
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,760
And all this stuff. You know, so then
they take me away to a mental hospital.

678
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,000
- Where?
- Houston.

679
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,640
- Why are you lying?
- I'm not lying.

680
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,680
I'm not lying!

681
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,880
Yeah. You were King Kong
in a jail in Houston.

682
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,640
Houston.

683
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,160
Houston.

684
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,920
Yeah.

685
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,560
Okay. You want to come back tomorrow?

686
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,320
Okay.

687
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,840
I was in college.

688
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,480
What happened?

689
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,400
I swallowed some aspirin.

690
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,120
How many?

691
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,200
Seventy-three heavy-duty,
full-strength Tylenol.

692
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,480
I was young.

693
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,000
It was on a full stomach...

694
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,160
and my roommates found me.

695
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,440
There's something I want you to know.

696
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,840
Ever since that night...

697
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,320
l have never...

698
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,360
ever...

699
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,280
had a headache.

700
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,840
True story.

701
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,640
I believe you.

702
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,840
How you doing, man?

703
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,040
Howard?

704
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,000
Howard!

705
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,080
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to see you, boy.

706
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,640
Did they get you, too?

707
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,440
- You look good, man.
- Yeah.

708
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,240
- For real.
- I'm getting there. I'm getting there.

709
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,120
- How long have I been in here?
- A month.

710
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,720
Month. Time flies.

711
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,000
Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but could I ask a question?

712
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:52,920
Sure.

713
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,640
- Did you drive here?
- I did.

714
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,800
- What kind of car do you have?
- Pickup.

715
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,960
You know you're injecting poisons
into our food and our bodies?

716
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,920
Okay, Mr. Wilson. Thank you.

717
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,240
- Thought that guy was your doctor.
- It's hard to tell sometimes.

718
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,360
Like with these three over there.

719
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,360
Now, Howard, you tell me.
Which one there is the patient?

720
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,280
The lady. The sad-looking lady.

721
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,000
That is my doctor.

722
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,720
What about these over here?
The little girl?

723
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,760
Tried to kill herself three times.

724
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,320
And the big lady over here, big fat lady?

725
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,440
All right. Okay. All right. All right, man.

726
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,400
- I came to see you. Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

727
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,920
Come on, man. Come on.

728
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,360
When can you get out of here?

729
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,320
I don't know.

730
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,520
I don't know.

731
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,880
And this woman is so awful to me.

732
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,520
You got my number. Call me anytime.

733
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,880
What is this? What is this? What?

734
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,280
You will not believe this, man.

735
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,440
You won't believe what happened to me.

736
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,320
I'm walking down the street,
day before yesterday.

737
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,160
The sky opens up....

738
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,000
Listen, I hear this voice saying:

739
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,440
"Give this to Mr. Jones. "

740
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,840
Mr. Altman?

741
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,880
Mr. Altman, I don't think you're supposed
to be off the unit.

742
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,200
- Mr. Altman?
- My wife....

743
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,240
What's the matter with your wife,
Mr. Altman?

744
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,480
She didn't come.

745
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,800
You expected her to come today
and she didn't come?

746
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:06,880
Is that it?

747
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,720
- She did not come to visit.
- I understand.

748
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,360
Okay. Why don't we go back to your room
and then you can call her.

749
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,760
Mr. Altman?

750
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,320
Mr. Altman?

751
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,440
Do you think she's fucking around?

752
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,840
I do. I think she's fucking around on me.

753
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,000
Just let's walk back, you and l,
to your ward and call her.

754
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,280
Is that okay?

755
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,000
Come on.

756
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,080
Hey, Arnie! Arnie!
I gotta talk to you, man.

757
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,920
I gotta talk to you about something!

758
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,640
Hey, you look good, man! You look good!

759
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,920
- My wife is fucking around!
- That ain't your wife! That's a doctor.

760
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,040
Your wife's not here!

761
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,160
- She didn't come to see me!
- She'll come. Here's protection.

762
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,920
You feel good! You feel real good!
Feel good!

763
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,160
- You feel real good!
- I feel good.

764
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,400
Have you seen my wife?

765
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,720
We need a medic over here.

766
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,440
Wait a minute! Shit!

767
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,080
No! It's the wrong guy!

768
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,320
Wait a minute!

769
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,920
No! I feel good! I feel good!

770
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,320
Wait. Wait. You okay? You all right?

771
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,960
Dr. Bowen, are you all right?

772
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,120
What happened? Did he hit you? Where?

773
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,320
Here.

774
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,920
I just wanted to say thank you.
I thought about buying you something...

775
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,560
but what do you buy a person
who saves your life?

776
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,000
It's no big deal.

777
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,080
Yes. Very big deal. Biggest deal there is.

778
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,720
Now you got a war story.

779
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,320
Something you can tell around
the campfire to the kiddies.

780
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,120
Scare them to death.

781
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,520
You can't let that big guy corner you
like that again.

782
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,440
You're "Old Doc Twinkletoes," remember?

783
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,840
- I'll remember.
- Okay. You do that.

784
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,560
- Mr. Jones?
- Yeah?

785
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,120
Want to play?

786
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,240
With you?

787
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,120
Love-one.

788
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,760
My serve.

789
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:30,840
Love-two.

790
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:34,000
All right! We know it's two-love.
Thank you very much.

791
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,760
- I had to do it.
- It's my point.

792
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:41,760
Love-three.

793
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,440
- Whose point?
- Her point.

794
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,480
- Who the fuck made you scorekeeper?
- Official tournament rules.

795
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:47,680
My point.

796
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:51,760
- Don't cheat.
- I'm not cheating, you're cheating.

797
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,440
My point.

798
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,440
- You can't do that!
- It didn't hit the table.

799
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,480
- Yes!
- I got it!

800
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,960
- It was off the table. What's the score?
- Wilson, it hit!

801
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,240
- One-three.
- No! It is not her point!

802
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,680
- Touched the table.
- It wasn't her point! It did not hit!

803
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,440
Bad manners, you lose a point!

804
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,120
We got ten people watching this.
I got the point.

805
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,480
- We'll play the point over.
- It was my point.

806
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,720
It was my point, but we'll play it over.

807
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,560
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait a minute.

808
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,400
Why is it I keep winning
and she gets the points?

809
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,760
My point.

810
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:39,080
It touched the table. Tournament rules!

811
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:42,600
What do you mean? That was my point!

812
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:43,880
Shut the fuck up!

813
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,760
You shut the fuck up!
I'm going to win this game!

814
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,880
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

815
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,280
Fuck you, too! You son of a bitch!

816
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,360
Fucking nutsos.

817
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,160
- Ready?
- Okay, all right.

818
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,520
My point again.

819
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,400
Okay, all right, give me the ball.
Give me the ball.

820
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,000
Wait a minute here. Give me the ball.

821
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,520
- I haven't got it!
- I saw you!

822
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,560
I didn't...

823
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:10,560
- Give me the ball. We're playing a game!
- Bad manners, you lose a point!

824
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:15,040
"Escalator to manager's office. "

825
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,440
So I have to go to him!

826
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,600
Mr. Jones, medication for you.

827
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,880
Mr. Jones, it's time for your medication.

828
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,240
I'm watching the cartoon.

829
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,360
Let me get to the bottom of this!

830
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,160
- It's time for your medication.
- I said, not today.

831
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,680
- Mr. Jones, it's time for...
- I said, don't!

832
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,320
I'm sorry.

833
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,400
I'm sorry.

834
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:01,440
I can't do this anymore.

835
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,080
I appreciate you trying so hard.

836
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,480
I gotta get out of here.

837
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,280
Is it the medication?

838
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,880
Elizabeth, I am a junkie.

839
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,240
I really need my highs.

840
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:31,360
I really miss my highs very badly.

841
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,600
And the lows?

842
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,720
Yeah, well...

843
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,360
guess I'll take my chances.

844
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,680
Listen to me.

845
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:48,800
When you first came to this hospital
you were suicidal, right?

846
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,120
I didn't come to this hospital.

847
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,080
I came to you.

848
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,400
I guess maybe I owe you my life.

849
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,640
Well, then, we're even.

850
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,560
Thank you again...

851
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,000
for helping me the other day.

852
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,280
It was so wonderful to see the way
you dealt with Mr. Altman.

853
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,320
You have such a gift with people.

854
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,360
You do, I envy you.

855
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,600
You have so much to offer.
Please, don't give up.

856
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,400
When I was 3 years old...

857
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,600
l played Mozart.

858
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,720
By the time I was 12,
I had read everything.

859
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,600
When I was 18...

860
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,600
l was the centre of the universe.

861
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:15,400
And then I woke up one day,
and I was in a mental institution.

862
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,680
I'm not normal.

863
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,240
I've never been normal.

864
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:39,640
I can't live down here anymore.
I can't do it. I can't.

865
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,720
I can't do it by myself.

866
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:47,920
No. Not by yourself.

867
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,120
It hurts.

868
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,800
We're grateful for all you've done.

869
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,600
But we feel that we can handle it
from this point on.

870
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,440
We do have a large and supportive family.

871
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,480
Dr. Bowen, what do you think?

872
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,400
I think you're ready to go back to school.

873
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,920
You're so much stronger now.

874
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,080
You feel stronger, don't you?

875
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,880
Yeah.

876
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,720
But I do think we need
to continue your treatment.

877
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,320
So we'll just go back
to our Tuesday morning sessions.

878
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,800
Okay, Amanda?

879
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:23,240
Actually, my parents have this friend
that's a therapist...

880
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,000
and they would like me to try
a few sessions with him.

881
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,720
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

882
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,360
- Thank you.
- Good-bye.

883
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,800
'Bye.

884
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,920
So, you call me if you need me? Promise?

885
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,920
Okay? Okay.

886
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,360
Let's be optimistic.

887
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,440
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- I have a meeting.

888
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,440
I can be late.

889
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,520
- No. No, that's all right.
- Tomorrow?

890
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,520
Yeah, I needed to talk to you.

891
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,080
- You find me!
- Okay!

892
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,160
Libbie. Libbie, come here a minute.

893
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,040
All right, I want you to meet Dr. Bowen.

894
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,720
All right? This is Susan.

895
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,440
Hello.

896
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,000
She was with Mr. Jones
at the Beethoven concert.

897
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,400
- She'd like to have a word with you.
- Okay.

898
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:40,800
He was just so special.
He was unexpected and exciting...

899
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:45,440
and just crazy enough
to make the afternoon interesting.

900
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,760
In what way, crazy?

901
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,200
Well, crazy.

902
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,840
Like, for instance,
we were in this hotel and...

903
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:01,120
this room-service guy comes
with some champagne and...

904
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,440
he calls this guy right into the bathroom.

905
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,840
We were both in the bathtub.

906
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,680
And he just stood up, you know?
He was, like, completely naked.

907
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,280
I guess you had to be there.

908
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,000
Even if he were here,
it would be confidential.

909
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,560
And we're not allowed to give out
any information about patients.

910
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,400
I'm really sorry.

911
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:34,040
Can I just give you my phone number,
in case?

912
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,800
Yeah, of course.

913
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:48,240
You know, I don't think he's married
or anything.

914
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,040
He did talk about another woman
in his life though.

915
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,440
Ellen. Ellen something?

916
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,240
She was a music student.

917
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,320
Do you remember her last name?

918
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,000
Ellen something.

919
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,680
He said she died.

920
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:13,440
I figured that gave me
a little edge over her.

921
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,480
So, who is it that we're looking for?

922
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,960
- A music student.
- Yes?

923
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,880
- Female.
- Yes?

924
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,760
- Here in the mid '70s.
- Yes?

925
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,200
- First name, Ellen.
- Yes?

926
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:33,440
- That's it?
- That's it.

927
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,680
This could take a while.

928
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,520
What do you want me to talk about today?

929
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,960
Anything you like.

930
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,960
Anything? Let's talk about you.

931
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,760
Okay, you choose.

932
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:00,840
Ellen.

933
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,520
- Ellen? Which Ellen?
- Your Ellen.

934
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,680
My Ellen? Yeah, my Ellen. Sure.

935
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,280
Ellen.

936
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,200
Ellen was probably the only person...

937
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,520
who ever really loved me.

938
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,400
The most beautiful red hair.

939
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,320
She thought I could be...

940
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:41,920
Mozart, Shakespeare, Einstein,
Picasso, Nijinsky.

941
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,800
And then she was gone.

942
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,040
How did she die?

943
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,320
She fell off a trapeze.

944
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:05,080
No, she was run over by a cement mixer.

945
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,840
What difference does it make?
She's gone. She's dead.

946
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,880
None.

947
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,560
What was her last name?

948
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,200
I don't remember.

949
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,800
Was it Ryan?

950
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,600
Ellen Ryan?

951
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,960
You are one very, very sick motherfucker.

952
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,880
What have you been doing,
spying on me? Miss FBl?

953
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,440
I spoke to her.

954
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,120
Ellen Ryan is now Mrs. Ellen Naughton.

955
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,720
She lives in lowa. She has two children.

956
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,360
She was so happy to hear
that you were being helped...

957
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,560
because the whole time
you were together...

958
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:02,360
you would never admit
that there was anything wrong.

959
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,360
That's why she had to leave you.

960
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:08,480
No. She died.

961
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,280
- No.
- She died.

962
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,760
She didn't die.

963
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:17,160
- Are your parents still alive?
- My parents never were alive.

964
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:28,080
Fuck you, you sick motherfucker.

965
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,560
Who the fuck do you think you are?

966
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,200
You think you're a fucking doctor?
You're full of shit! You're sick!

967
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,960
I'm not sick! You don't treat me
like a fucking sick person!

968
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,160
I don't skulk around! I don't fucking spy!

969
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,920
You're not a sick person,
you're a person with a sickness.

970
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,680
Don't fucking talk to me about sick!
You're sick!

971
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:51,440
The disease is not who you are.
It's separate from you, and can be treated.

972
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,240
I am what I am! This is what I am!
And fuck you!

973
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,680
You're not a friend of mine!
You have no right to talk to me!

974
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,600
I don't need this. What am I doing?
I don't fucking need this.

975
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:04,680
I don't need it at all.
I don't have to be here. And I'm going.

976
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,640
'Bye, see you around, pal.

977
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,320
Damn!

978
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,680
Why? Why? Why? Dumb!

979
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,920
What do you expect?
You go there to see some stupid....

980
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:32,000
Don't you ever do it again!
Why am I doing it again?

981
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,600
What do you expect?
You go to a hospital looking for....

982
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:40,360
All right. Stupid!
Stupid, why do you do this? Stupid!

983
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,560
- Don't do it again.
- Get in the car!

984
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,680
- Please! Let's talk.
- Get out of here!

985
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,960
Please, just get in the car!

986
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,760
Can't we just talk?

987
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,720
- I don't want to talk.
- Please!

988
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:59,560
Get away from me!
You're sicker than I thought you were!

989
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:00,920
Get out of here!

990
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,600
Can you please just stop and listen to me?

991
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,880
All right, what? What do you want?
What?

992
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,880
You don't even know, do you?

993
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:37,560
All right, all right, I forgive you.
Now, just get the hell away from me.

994
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,840
Look, I was wrong, okay? I've never
violated a patient's privacy before.

995
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,440
And you still haven't.
'Cause I'm not your patient!

996
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,960
I never was! You get it?

997
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,600
I checked myself in! I checked myself out!

998
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:52,760
My mistake was looking for a friend
in a hospital! I'm not gonna do it again!

999
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,560
Ellen said she thinks
about you all the time.

1000
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,480
She never passes a music store...

1001
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,400
or a concert hall without looking
for your work.

1002
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,200
Shut up!

1003
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,280
- Why'd you say she was dead?
- I'm warning you!

1004
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,720
Why'd you say it? Tell me!

1005
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:09,360
Because she is dead, that's why!
And so are you!

1006
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:16,200
What about my work? My work?

1007
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,560
Why didn't she come looking for me?

1008
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,440
She couldn't do that, could she?
Why the fuck not?

1009
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,040
Too much trouble, that's why.

1010
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,680
I was too much fucking trouble
for everybody!

1011
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,400
My whole fucking life, everyone I met,
too much trouble!

1012
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,280
Let me tell you something,
you get it together.

1013
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,360
Find a way to make it all right!
Don't think you will, but you do!

1014
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:44,200
- You feel sorry for yourself, don't you?
- I got this really good little trick.

1015
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,760
You see, you're not human anymore!
None of you! You're not human!

1016
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,680
You're like goldfish! All of you!

1017
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,040
- One dies, I get another one!
- You want human? I'll give you human!

1018
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,360
You're going to blow the back
of your head off!

1019
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:58,840
Or jump, or hang or do anything
to turn off the pain! Aren't you?

1020
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,720
- Admit it!
- I'm warning you!

1021
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,520
You're gonna do it and you know it!

1022
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,560
Take your hands off me!

1023
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:06,720
When you finally do, when all your charm...

1024
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:10,600
and all the wonderful things
that you could be are gone forever...

1025
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,640
I'll just be left here...

1026
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:17,600
with an intensely human,
unprofessional rip in my heart.

1027
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:21,040
That terrifies the hell out of me.

1028
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,320
- Elizabeth.
- What?

1029
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,640
What the hell are we doing here?

1030
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,480
I don't know.

1031
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,920
Would that be a problem for you, Libbie?

1032
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:12,760
Sorry?

1033
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:16,440
Would it be a problem for you
to supervise some additional cases?

1034
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,120
No. No, of course not. That's fine.

1035
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,440
Dr. Bowen?

1036
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:41,440
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1037
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,720
You have the most beautiful smile.

1038
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,080
I just wanted to say, "Hello".

1039
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,840
You're a doctor. You can fix my life.

1040
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:12,520
Right?

1041
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,160
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah, just a sec. Did you see this?

1042
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,440
I want to take myself off the Jones case...

1043
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,560
and I was hoping
that you could take over.

1044
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,560
- Why?
- What?

1045
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:05,680
Why?

1046
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:13,160
Because I really think it's for the best.

1047
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,560
The best?

1048
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,520
It's not the best for me.

1049
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,120
I slept with him.

1050
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,640
You want to say that again.

1051
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,200
I slept with him.

1052
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:44,160
For Christ's sake! What the fuck
do you think you were doing?

1053
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:50,280
Twelve years of training as a psychiatrist,
and you blow it off!

1054
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,000
First of all, you'll be fired.

1055
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:55,600
Then, if Mr. Jones, solid,
stable citizen that he is...

1056
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,640
chooses to press charges,
you could be prosecuted.

1057
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,240
You could go to jail.

1058
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,760
You could go to fucking jail!
Do you understand that?

1059
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,280
- I'll resign.
- Great! Fine! Beautiful.

1060
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,120
You fuck one of the patients...

1061
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,120
and all the rest of them lose
one of the best therapists...

1062
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,960
Patrick, please. Help me.

1063
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,000
Okay. Come here.

1064
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,880
All right, this is the deal.

1065
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:31,960
You cannot see him again.

1066
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:35,240
- I have to see him once to explain.
- Libbie, listen to me.

1067
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:39,800
You cannot see him again.
If you do, I will turn you in.

1068
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,400
This is not about protecting myself,
the hospital. It's about him, the patient.

1069
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,560
It has nothing to do
with how I feel about you.

1070
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:49,880
I would do that. Do you understand?
I would turn you in.

1071
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,480
Do you understand me?

1072
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,400
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

1073
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:59,760
There is a line here, all right?
You cannot cross it.

1074
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:04,480
You don't understand.
It's too late. It's too late.

1075
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,840
Then I'm gonna transfer him
to another hospital.

1076
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:26,880
Mr. Jones?

1077
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,160
Will you please come back?

1078
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,880
Mr. Jones, come back!

1079
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,240
Mr. Jones!

1080
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,240
Come back!

1081
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,760
Are you in there?

1082
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,320
Mr. Jones, can I help you?

1083
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,600
Elizabeth!

1084
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,200
Elizabeth!

1085
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,080
Maybe I can help you?

1086
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,400
I don't think you can.
Elizabeth can help me.

1087
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,200
You'll be moved to another hospital.

1088
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,720
Excellent facility.

1089
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,960
In the meantime, Dr. Rosen will be glad
to help you. Let's go back to the unit.

1090
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,600
I don't care about you or him.

1091
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:07,040
If Elizabeth wants me transferred,
I want her to tell me to my face.

1092
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:11,200
Let's talk about it back at the unit.
She cannot talk to you right now.

1093
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,040
Don't touch me. I said don't touch me.

1094
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,320
That's okay.

1095
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,240
Don't fucking touch me!

1096
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:52,920
Libbie?

1097
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:00,960
Patrick.

1098
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:04,640
Good morning.

1099
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:11,360
- What time is it?
- It's 8:00 p.m.

1100
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,080
I'm so tired.

1101
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,680
Listen, I just wanted to let you know that...

1102
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,480
he's out.

1103
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,520
Who told you?

1104
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:35,200
I have a friend who's a resident at Cal.
They assessed him as being stable...

1105
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,800
and found him co-operative
with the drug program.

1106
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,000
So he got himself released.

1107
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,800
Why are you telling me?

1108
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,920
- He may try to contact you.
- No.

1109
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,480
No, he won't.

1110
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,120
Not me, not anymore.

1111
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:58,160
I'm dead.

1112
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,680
Hello?

1113
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:57,160
- I'm trying to contact Dr. Bowen.
- This is Dr. Bowen.

1114
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,000
I eat take-out Chinese food, right?

1115
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:46,360
I'm not afraid of death.

1116
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,680
People build it up to be something...

1117
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:57,360
that you should be frightened of, but...

1118
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,200
I'm so ready.

1119
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:07,800
It would be a big relief, actually.

1120
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:12,040
Like a warmth.

1121
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:15,920
Dr. Bowen?

1122
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,400
Do you think I'm pretty?

1123
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,400
It was like that day we went to the pier
and I got up on the railing.

1124
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,560
You thought it was stupid, right?

1125
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,600
I can see now you still do.
Yeah, really dumb.

1126
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:44,280
Yeah, I'm going to fall and break my neck.
What's the point, right?

1127
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:49,760
You see, you don't understand.
Being up there is the point.

1128
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,800
They're willing to risk everything to get it.

1129
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:05,040
Hi, Elizabeth.

1130
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:10,480
What would you risk everything for?

1131
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,440
Is there anything that means
that much to you?

1132
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,760
You're going to listen to this later?
I hope you do.

1133
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:25,400
Save this one, this was a good one.

1134
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:33,720
What's up?

1135
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,160
What's this?

1136
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:45,160
- It's my resignation.
- What'd you do? Kill somebody?

1137
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,600
I've made a mistake.

1138
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:58,080
I've done something very bad.

1139
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,200
Jones?

1140
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:20,840
Hey, buddy.

1141
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,200
- Your bike?
- Yeah.

1142
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:28,880
- What is it, '67?
- '68.

1143
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,280
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.
These are so sweet.

1144
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,640
- You got the original Girlings.
- Yeah.

1145
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:38,120
Oil pan problems? Unbelievable.

1146
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,720
- You do the paint job too?
- I have an English guy who helps me out.

1147
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,440
- Nice, isn't it?
- This is great.

1148
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,800
Let's put the key in.
Let's see what it's like.

1149
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:48,560
- The engine's a little fresh....
- Yeah.

1150
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:52,480
- Sweet, man! Good tune job!
- Yeah.

1151
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,400
- This is great. Where'd you get it from?
- A shoot.

1152
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,200
- What do you do?
- I'm a director.

1153
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,880
- Direct what?
- Rock videos.

1154
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,280
Rock videos!

1155
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,240
Hey, buddy!

1156
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:12,760
Jeffrey, he's got a bike just like yours!

1157
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,960
Jones, Mr. Yes.

1158
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:27,760
I would appreciate a call back
as soon as you hear anything at all.

1159
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:40,120
He's back! He's back!

1160
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,880
Look at you! Hey, look at this!

1161
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:53,240
I came for my tools, man.

1162
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:55,160
- I came for my tools!
- Cut the engine!

1163
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,000
I've come for my tools!

1164
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,160
They let you go?

1165
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,520
Yeah, tried to keep me, couldn't do it.
Got out, flew away!

1166
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,920
- You doin' all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Right as rain.

1167
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:09,880
Need the tools.

1168
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:14,160
Yeah, I got your tools. Davon,
why don't you go on in the house.

1169
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:19,040
- Davon, 1,492 divided by 68?
- Yeah.

1170
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:21,320
- You got a job?
- Yeah.

1171
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:22,960
- Where?
- Guess.

1172
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,240
I don't know.

1173
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,280
- Broad Street?
- Yes!

1174
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:33,240
- They finished that job.
- No.

1175
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,680
I went there last week.
They finished that job.

1176
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:39,360
No. Talked to the foreman.
Got the job back. Need the tools.

1177
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,080
All right.

1178
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,440
I'll go get them.

1179
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,480
Relax, man.

1180
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:58,600
I'll be right back.

1181
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:19,000
- Hey, come on in the house.
- Yeah, give me the tools.

1182
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:21,280
You going to stay and have some lunch?

1183
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,240
Come in the house and have some lunch.

1184
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:25,960
- Those are my tools?
- Yeah, they're your tools.

1185
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,680
- Come on, man, what...
- Give me the fucking....

1186
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:33,320
Give me the tools.

1187
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,120
Yeah.

1188
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:49,480
I'm sorry.

1189
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,400
Thank you for....

1190
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,280
It's not necessary.

1191
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:03,920
Now, the kids would really like
to see you, you know.

1192
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:08,760
Why don't you park the bike,
come in the house and have lunch with us?

1193
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:10,600
How does that sound?

1194
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:17,080
Why don't you ask your wife first?
Ask her.

1195
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:22,080
- I ain't got to ask my wife.
- I don't feel right about it. Ask her.

1196
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:24,840
All right. Hey, Thiel!

1197
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:27,840
- No, man, go on.
- All right. Don't you go nowhere, okay?

1198
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,040
No, I'm....

1199
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,360
Watch him.

1200
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:38,520
Hey, man.

1201
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:42,640
21.941 167?

1202
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,200
76.

1203
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,680
- Leaving?
- Got to!

1204
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:49,680
Dad!

1205
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:53,520
Shit! Hey, man!

1206
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,320
Yes. Yes, thank you.

1207
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,400
- Yes?
- Dr. Bowen, this is Mandy at the hospital.

1208
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:30,480
- I don't work there, Mandy.
- I'm sorry, there's a man...

1209
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,200
I don't work there anymore!

1210
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:36,840
There's a man who's a friend of Mr. Jones.
He thinks Jones is gonna try and fly again.

1211
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:24,800
Mr. Jones!

1212
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:24,520
Mr. Jones!

1213
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:25,680
I wanted to fly so much.

1214
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:34,920
But I can't.

1215
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:38,600
I know.

1216
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,080
I'm sorry.

1217
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:11,880
So...

1218
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:15,400
now what?

1219
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:19,800
Cup of coffee?

1220
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:25,880
Okay.

1221
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:29,960
Decaf.
