1
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,500
- Pull up easy.
- The temperature in Newark is 54.

2
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,500
In Morristown it's 57,
and in Asbury Park...

3
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,500
Saint Dominic's: $2,712.

4
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,500
Saint Michael's: $983.

5
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,500
What do you have
on Saint Bartholomew?

6
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,500
- Fifty-eight.
- $5,8oo?

7
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,800
George, what about Loyola?

8
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,800
All right, up against the wall!

9
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,500
What is this?
What's going on?

10
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,500
My dear friends, you have
come together in this church...

11
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,800
that the Lord may seal
and strengthen your love...

12
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,500
in the presence of the church's
minister and this community.

13
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,800
Christ abundantly blesses you.

14
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,500
- Oh, my God!
- Get that money!

15
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,500
- What are you doing?
- Do you know whose parish this is?

16
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,800
Fuck you
and the horse you rode in on.

17
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,500
May daily problems
never cause you anxiety...

18
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,500
or the desire for earthly
possessions dominate your lives.

19
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,500
May you find happiness
and satisfaction in your work.

20
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,500
Just kiss that pipe, boys.

21
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,800
Shut up!

22
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,500
You have declared your consent
before the church.

23
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,500
May the Lord strengthen your consent
and fill you with His blessings.

24
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,500
What God has joined
man must not divide.

25
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,500
Leave the change alone!

26
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,800
- Don't touch it.
- Beautiful.

27
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,500
May Almighty God bless you.
The Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.

28
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,500
We've been hit!

29
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,500
Son of a bitch!

30
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,500
In the days I went a-courtin'
I was never tired of resortin'

31
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,500
To the ale house or the playhouse
And many's the house besides

32
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,500
As sure as me name is Barney
I'll be off to "Californy"

33
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,500
Instead of diggin' praddies
I'll be diggin' lumps of coal

34
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,500
- Don't get us glommed over.
- No way.

35
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,500
We've already got a driver
in the car.

36
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,500
Keep it up.

37
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,800
Don't press me, pal.

38
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,800
Couldn't you have stopped him
without doing that?

39
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,500
Shut your mouth
before you get it.

40
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,500
- What do you mean?
- Just what I'm tellin' ya, hard on.

41
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,500
If you'd shoot a priest for $67,ooo,
how much is my life worth?

42
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Zero.

43
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,500
You're a piece of shit.

44
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,800
- You bastard!
- What are you doing?

45
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,500
Look out!

46
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,500
He's gone! He's gone!

47
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,500
We better leave 'em
till the cops get here.

48
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,500
Ooh!

49
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,500
Call another ambulance.

50
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,500
- There's one in back.
- There's a guy in the car here.

51
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,500
Hurt awful bad.

52
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,500
Everybody stay out of the way
and let these guys through.

53
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,500
Hey, Mickey, over here!

54
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,500
What's the latest on your brother,
Mr. Ricci?

55
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,500
- He's gonna be all right.
- That's fine. Thank God.

56
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,500
One of those pigs
walked away from that accident.

57
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,800
His name is Jackie Scanlon.

58
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,800
He's a punk from Queens
with the Donnelly mob.

59
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,500
Real piece of shit.

60
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,800
Mr. Ricci, everybody wants
to help you on this.

61
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,500
The guy can't make a move.

62
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,800
He can't go nowheres.

63
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,500
Could be on his way
to the moon by now.

64
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,500
We'll get the best, but it's gonna
have to come from the outside...

65
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,500
and it's gonna cost.

66
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,800
He robbed my church.

67
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,500
Shot my brother.

68
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,500
I don't care where he is
or what it costs. I want his ass.

69
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,800
- You got a problem.
- Tell me about it.

70
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,500
- You're on the hit parade.
- What?

71
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,500
That priest you whacked
was Carlo Ricci's brother.

72
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,500
Forget the heat. Ricci himself
is out looking for you.

73
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,500
- I never carry a pistol.
- Want to tell him that in person?

74
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,800
Got any money?

75
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,800
Two thousand.

76
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,800
- How about a passport?
- What for?

77
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,500
For 2,ooo I'll get you a passport.

78
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,500
- You mean out of the country?
- Uh-huh.

79
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,500
- Where?
- A good place to stay low.

80
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,800
Why?

81
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,500
It's a place nobody
wants to look in.

82
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,800
It's covered, okay?

83
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,500
- Where am I going?
- Get a train in Baltimore.

84
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,800
Go to pier 47.

85
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,800
At customs, ask for Nat Glick.

86
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,500
Don't mention my name.

87
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,500
As of right now, I don't know you
and I don't want to know you.

88
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,500
I owed you a favor.
This is it.

89
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,800
You gonna tell me where I'm going?

90
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,500
I swear to Christ, I don't know.

91
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,500
Vamos! Arriba!

92
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,500
Yorba! Fuerza atras!

93
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,500
Vamos! Arriba! Arriba!

94
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,800
Arriba! Fuerza atras!

00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,800
Vamos! Eso es!

96
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,500
Arriba! Eso...

97
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,500
No!

98
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,500
Cuidado, idiotas!
Ese hombre esta malherido!

99
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,500
Ramirez.

100
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,500
Serrano.

101
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,500
Marquez.

102
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,500
? Transito? Pase.

103
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,500
Transito. Pase.
Pasaporte. Pase. Pasaporte. Pase.

104
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,800
- I am in transit.
- ? Que?

105
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,800
Transito, me.

106
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,500
- I am going to Managua.
- Ah, Managua. Si. Pase.

107
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,500
- Can I get something to drink?
- Pasaporte.

108
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,500
In the plane with my baggage.
I'm very thirsty.

109
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,500
Pase.

110
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,800
Forget it, pal.

111
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,500
Stop eating. A year's pay might get you
a seat to the next rat hole. Come on.

112
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,800
I have three rooms.

113
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,500
One of them's taken.

114
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,500
Agrippa, traeme las llaves.

115
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,800
I'll take it.

116
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,500
- For how long?
- Let's say a week.

117
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,500
- Aqui esta.
- Espere.

118
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,500
Esperate alla.

119
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,500
How much do you suppose
from here to Argentina?

120
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,500
An airline ticket
costs 47o pesos.

121
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,500
Passports, maybe another thousand.

122
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,800
I have less than 1oo.

123
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,500
Everything I could save in a year.

124
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,500
My house, maybe for 6oo,
if I could sell it.

125
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,500
? Comprende ingles?

126
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,800
Yes, I speak some.

127
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,500
- Want to travel away?
- Yes.

128
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,500
I can fix for you la capital.

129
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,500
- I want to go out of this country.
- Out of this country? Dificil.

130
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,800
Very difficult.

131
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,800
Impossible?

132
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,500
No, es posible.
Costoso.

133
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,500
? Comprende? Cost much.

134
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,500
Comprende.

135
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,500
I can fix for you
to go out from the country.

136
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,500
- This reloj plus 1,ooo pesos.
- I have only the watch.

137
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,500
Whiskey.

138
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,800
Danke shon.

139
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,500
- Put it on my account.
- Thank you.

140
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,800
During the work it's hotter.

141
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,500
- Yeah. I like a southern exposure.
- Yes.

142
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,500
I thought about it myself.

143
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,500
I understand
you used to be in banking.

144
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,500
That's the rumor.

145
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,500
I had no idea
I was the subject of rumors.

146
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,800
Carlos used to be
an ex Reichs Marschall.

147
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,500
Right, Carlos?

148
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,500
What is your profession,
Mr...?

149
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,500
- Dominguez.
- Dominguez.

150
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,500
Ice hockey.

151
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,500
Read about this place
in a travel brochure?

152
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,500
I heard it had a healthy climate.

153
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,500
Not what you expected.

154
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,500
It was exactly what I expected.

155
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,500
Juan Dominguez?

156
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,800
Aren't you the laborer,
Juan Dominguez?

157
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,500
- Oiga, le estamos hablando.
- No comprendo.

158
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,500
Quedate? Es amigo tuyo?

159
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,500
No.

160
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,800
You don't understand, huh?

161
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,500
Let's see your identity card.

162
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,800
? Cómo?

163
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,500
The identity card you keep here.

164
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,500
Juan Dominguez,
born November 1939...

165
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,500
in Las Calumnas in this country.

166
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,500
That is you?

167
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,500
You don't look to me like you
were born in Las Calumnas.

168
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,800
? Por que?

169
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,500
Because you don't even
speak Spanish.

170
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,500
And because you are
a filthy gringo asshole.

171
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,800
Es un asunto muy serio.

172
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,800
This is false.

173
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,500
It's a violation
of the immigration laws.

174
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,500
Piernas asi.
Manos encima del bar.

175
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,500
Atras! Mas atras! No te muevas!

176
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,500
Hey!

177
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,500
? Mas? Tienes mas?

178
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,800
Do you have more?

179
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,800
That's it.

180
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,500
Que cabrón es.
Tiene plata.

181
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,500
Okay, next time you pay.

182
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,500
You make three...

183
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,800
we take one.

184
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,500
Understand?

185
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,800
Comprendo.

186
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,800
Okay.

187
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,500
Puedes irte. Fuera.

188
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,800
I need my card.

189
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,500
? Que? Fuera!

190
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,500
I can't make shit without my card.

191
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,500
- I need that.
- Ah.

192
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,500
La tarjeta. Si.

193
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,800
Para trabajar.

194
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,500
Para ganar.

195
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,500
Adiós, senor Dominguez.

196
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,500
It should produce twice as much as
this last zone that we come out of.

197
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,800
When can you get this one
pinched off?

198
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,500
Our trucks have
already been ordered.

199
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,500
They should be here.

200
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,800
Cuidado!

201
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,500
Alejense del campo!
Afuera! Afuera!

202
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,800
Very professional.

203
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,800
Get it to the capital.
Maybe we'll get results.

204
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,500
The government's been told
it was an accident.

205
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,800
What?

206
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,500
In this country, terrorists who blow
up American oil wells are heroes.

207
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,500
We're paying that government
to give us protection.

208
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,800
El presidente cannot risk
his liberal image...

209
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,500
by sending us troops
to chase patriots.

210
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,800
Shit!

211
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,500
This is a telex from home
responding to my report.

212
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,800
First part concerns...

213
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,500
regret loss of life, etcetera,
injuries and so on.

214
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,500
Apparently we have no insurance
position because of the sabotage thing.

215
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,500
This is the part that concerns you.

216
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,800
"Limitations on production
in recent months...

217
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,500
due to acts of terrorism
and political uncertainties...

218
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,500
emphasize attention
immediate supply obligations...

219
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,800
with minimum concern R & D....

220
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,800
What is R & D?

221
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,800
Research and Development.

222
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,500
"Please apprise
course of action soonest. "

223
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,500
It's signed, "Weber. "

224
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,800
Is that it?

225
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,500
Yes.

226
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,500
What are the immediate
supply obligations?

227
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,500
One tanker, 16o,ooo barrels
by the end of next month.

228
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,800
We need that well to fill it.

229
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,500
They'll have to delay it.

230
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,800
They can't.

231
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,500
Charter's running. If we have
to take a loss that big...

232
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,500
we might as well shut down now
and save expenses.

233
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,500
Asesinos!

234
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,500
Mi papa! Mi papa!

235
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,500
Fuera gringos! Fuera gringos!

236
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,500
Malditos desgraciados!

237
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,500
Hay Que matter a esos gringos!

238
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,500
Asesinos! Asesinos!

239
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,500
I've seen worse.

240
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,500
Let's clear away that junk
and blow her out.

241
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,500
Dame el machete.

242
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,500
Esta bueno.

243
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,800
This stuff is too dry to spark.

244
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,500
? Cuando fue la ultima vez Que
le dieron la vuelta a las cajas?

245
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,500
? Quien sabe, ingeniero?

246
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,800
That stuff has been sitting
for a year.

247
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,500
- It's worthless.
- What do you mean?

248
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,800
When it sits a long time
without being turned...

249
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,800
that liquid nitro seeps out
of the sticks and into the bag.

250
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,500
If you give those cases
any kind of a bump, it'll blow.

251
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,500
It's risky moving a case ten feet.
That fire's over 2oo miles away.

252
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,500
If it were up there,
could you use it?

253
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,800
We could boom-load
a little at a time. Yes.

254
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,500
How you gonna get it there?

255
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,500
That's not your problem.
We'll get it there.

256
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,800
What do you think?

257
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,500
The major problem is the vibration.
This thing is like an egg beater.

258
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,500
No matter how we shock-mount something,
it will have a severe lateral vibration.

259
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,500
I thought maybe you could
swing-load it on a pallet.

260
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,500
Twenty feet down there's no vibration,
but the problem is turbulence.

261
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,800
We might move it half a mile
that way but not 2oo.

262
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,500
We've never had a flight here
without some turbulence in it.

263
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,800
What are you saying?

264
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,500
Not with a chopper.
There's no way.

265
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,800
I'll double the amount
if you can think of a way.

266
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,500
It's not the money. Nobody's gonna
get into a chopper with that shit.

267
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,800
You need a suicide jockey.

268
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,500
We now need
experienced truck drivers...

269
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,800
men who are willing
to do a dangerous job.

270
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,500
This job must be done...

271
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,500
before we can reopen our gates and
bring back full employment to you people.

272
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,500
The men who qualify
will receive exceptional wages.

273
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,500
Only experienced truck drivers
willing to risk their life can do it.

274
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,800
No one else should apply.

275
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,500
The company will pay 8,ooo pesos
to each driver.

276
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,800
Wait a minute!

277
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,500
Silencio, por favor!

278
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,800
Four men with enough guts...

279
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,500
can save Poza Rica
and your village!

280
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,500
- Stop at the bottom of the hill.
- I need to know the machine.

281
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,500
Pull over.

282
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,500
You crazy bastard!

283
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,500
Teamster?

284
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,500
Greyhound.

285
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,500
Vamos.

286
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,800
Serrano.

287
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,800
Dominguez.

288
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,800
Marquez.

289
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,800
Martinez.
Pueden quedarse.

290
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,500
Los demas, pueden irse.

291
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,800
We're carrying three cases each.

292
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,500
One is enough to blow your fire. Six
cases will blow out the whole field.

293
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,500
You don't think all the trucks
will make it. One of us is a backup.

294
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,500
We want double, and legal residence,
or we don't drive.

295
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,500
You leave in four hours.

296
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,800
Only one machete?

297
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,500
How many would you like?

298
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,500
Have to put half the jungle underneath
our wheels to get through the mud.

299
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,800
How many machetes
you want us to carry?

300
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,500
Should be two.

301
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,500
Condensers. Points.

302
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,500
Floats. Filters.

303
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,500
Tape. Wire.
Channel locks.

304
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,800
Rags.

305
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,500
- Where's the rest of this cable?
- In the car.

306
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,500
Where the hell is the German?

307
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,500
Toque el claxon.

308
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,800
? Que quiere?

309
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,500
Tengo algo para el senor Serrano.

310
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,500
She's got something for you.

311
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,500
Para su buena suerte,
senor Serrano.

312
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,500
What is it?

313
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,500
Toque el claxon otra vez.

314
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,500
Marquez!

315
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,500
Marquez!

316
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,500
Murderer! Zionist!
I'll kill you!

317
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,500
What happened? What happened?

318
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,500
This Jew dog cut his throat!

319
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,800
- Vete a avisar a la policia.
- No police.

320
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,800
Vete a la policia.

321
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,500
Hold it! We lost a driver.
We need another one.

322
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,500
When the money's up,
I'm as good as any of you.

323
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,500
Where you from?

324
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,500
Listen, Pancho, I've been clocking you
every second that you got into this town.

325
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,500
If you pick your nose in this truck,
clear it with me first...

326
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,500
or I'll take you and this nitro
into a ditch.

327
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,500
They've had 15 minutes.

328
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,800
Yes.

329
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,500
One moment.

330
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,800
I have a letter.

331
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,500
- I wonder if you would post it for me?
- Paris.

332
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,500
- That could take a month.
- Yes.

333
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,500
- Just keep it for me.
- I'll take care of it.

334
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:30,500
