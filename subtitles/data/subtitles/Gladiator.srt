1
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,714
Who said you ould shoot?

2
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,873
I don't want your whiteness
shoving through my hoops!

3
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,599
Punk-ass, keep walking!

4
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,075
Look at them boots he's wearing, man.

5
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,068
He's a stupid-ass. Shit.
And fuck you too, Lincoln.

6
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,838
Talk about a punk.

7
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,195
Let's get the game started back up.

8
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,913
-He started it.
-You started it.

9
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,712
I'm gonna slick your sister.

10
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,233
332.

11
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,396
All right, what's going on here?

12
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,635
He started it.

13
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,390
He's cute.
-We got a new kid.

14
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,108
You in my seat, boy.

15
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,951
You in my seat now.

16
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,308
Is this seat taken?

17
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,551
Guess what?
-I'm in your seat?

18
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,159
How did you know that?

19
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,113
Did I say something?
-Yeah, you said something.

20
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,632
Get out of my seat, snowface.

21
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,712
I don't think that I can do that.

22
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,558
You don't think you can do that?

23
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,275
I've grown real attached to this seat.

24
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,034
In fact, I think we're
gonna be going steady.

25
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,439
That's funny.

26
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,113
You're a comedian?

27
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,794
Leroy, take off that hat and sit down.

28
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,955
Sit down or leave my class.

29
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,272
I'll catch you on the greasy side.

30
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,309
Billy, would you please
distribute these?

31
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,675
Now.

32
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,831
Before you ladies get pregnant...

33
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,395
...and you gentlemen
murder one another...

34
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,358
...you'll learn the joy of reading.

35
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,559
This way, you have something to do
in your ninth month...

36
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,591
...or in your jail cell.

37
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,430
The short fiction of Mark Twain.

38
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,516
Can anyone tell me what novels
Mark Twain wrote?

39
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,195
Belinda?
-Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.

40
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,676
Yes. The Adventures of--
American classics.

41
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,030
And who knows Mark Twain's real name?

42
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,832
Dawn.
-Samuel Clemens.

43
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,109
Very good.

44
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,829
Yes, Leroy.

45
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,759
Why did he use another name?

46
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,789
Why do you think?

47
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,112
He wanted by the law.

48
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,068
No, it's a pseudonym. A made-up name.

49
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,873
I got a pseudonym too.

50
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,189
Spits.

51
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,796
That's a nickname. It has a meaning.

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,514
And I hesitate to think
how you got it.

53
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,148
A pseudonym usually has no meaning...

54
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,556
...but this is an exception.

55
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,789
Can anyone tell me what
"Mark Twain" means?

56
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,229
I thought not.

57
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,513
It's an expression used by
riverboat captains on the Mississippi.

58
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,438
It's to tell how deep the river was.

59
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,548
Go, yo scholar.

60
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,274
Settle down.
And who are you?

61
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,113
It's on your desk, ma'am.

62
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,918
"Transfer. Tommy Riley."

63
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,348
Well, Mr. Riley...

64
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,071
...welcome to paradise.

65
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,634
Hey, hombre.

66
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,714
Got an extra smoke?
-Yeah, sure.

67
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,069
Appreciate that, I do.

68
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,794
Listen, how about one
for after school?

69
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,434
Want one for your girlfriend?

70
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,709
I never refuse. Never refuse.

71
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,638
How about your mom and dad?

72
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,078
You okay. I'll pay you back tomorrow.

73
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,753
Amigo, you carry a weapon?

74
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,718
Well, he don't look like much.

75
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,519
He not much.

76
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,514
He's just a funny boy.

77
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,392
Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

78
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,671
You funny, boy?

79
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,676
Come on.

80
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,108
Make me laugh.

81
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,553
I don't want any trouble.

82
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,074
That's too bad, funny boy.
See, trouble be my middle name.

83
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,955
Trouble be his pseudonym.

84
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,951
Well, well, well.

85
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,790
Abraham Lincoln!

86
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,031
Thought you was thrown out of school.

87
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,596
This is public property.
I got business to conduct.

88
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,360
See how my Storm Troopers are faring.

89
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,079
How are your Avenging Angels?

90
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,840
Close to God, my brother.

91
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,235
Awful close to the wrath of God.

92
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,830
I owe you, Lincoln.
I owe you what you did to Jerome.

93
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,958
Anytime, nigga. Anyplace.

94
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,758
Well, then.

95
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,398
Hello, time.

96
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,678
Hello, place.

97
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,233
Jerome used a raZor too. All you
Storm Troopers hide behind a raZor?

98
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,840
Step in the ring with me. Fight
like a man.

99
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,190
You gonna bleed either way, partner!

100
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,479
You gonna miss!

101
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,989
Break it up!

102
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,549
Don't you drop me! You better
not drop me! I'm gonna kill somebody!

103
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,796
I'll kill somebody!
I feel for you, boy!

104
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,912
Yeah, well, I'll be
at your mama's house!

105
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,909
Come on.

106
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,831
Hey, kid. Your name Riley?

107
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,593
Your pops is John Riley?

108
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,549
What about it?

109
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,638
We're friends of Big John's.

110
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,718
Yeah, bowling buddies.
-Can we come in?

111
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,155
Right.

112
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,999
We were supposed to rendeZvous
with Big John over in Bridgeport.

113
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,954
Yesterday. But guess what?
Somebody flew the coop.

114
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,276
Sharkey got discombobulated.

115
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,512
We had to cop the forwarding
address off the postman.

116
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,954
Nice.

117
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,073
It's last week's, due yesterday.

118
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,511
And this week's installment.

119
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,194
Due today.

120
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,875
You be sure and show pops my message.

121
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,472
I'll show him.

122
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,589
Hi.
-Hey.

123
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,599
What are you doing here?

124
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,598
Could I get a cup of coffee?

125
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,756
Don't bullshit me about Murphy's Law.

126
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,394
If I run into Murphy,
I'll kick him in the balls.

127
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,393
Detached retina.
What am l, an eye doctor?

128
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,315
He's ducking the fight.
That's what he's doing.

129
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,753
I'll come right over.
I'll see it for myself. Right.

130
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,789
Let's go.

131
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,789
Assholes.

132
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,912
I don't know why someone would live
somewheres else, then move here.

133
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,597
Neither do l, but it does happen.

134
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,878
No food?

135
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,919
I'm a little short.
I'll just take the coffee.

136
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,750
You're not interested in a job,
are you?

137
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,230
Yeah, I could use one.

138
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,831
Well, it's not much.
It's the dishwasher.

139
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,275
He didn't show up.

140
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,748
I'm not proud.

141
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,990
I'll ask my mom.

142
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,837
That's free. Next dish will cost you
a buck and a half.

143
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,873
Glasses, 75. Cups are a dollar.
-Yes, ma'am.

144
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,195
You can empty the garbage now.
Take a five-minute break.

145
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,559
Went outside.

146
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,799
Goddamn, man! Ain't he cute?

147
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,559
He's beautiful, man.

148
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,751
Throw a couple of earrings
on his ear...

149
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,632
...bits of rouge on the cheeks...

150
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,195
...he'll have the white boys
chasing after him.

151
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,279
I got no quarrel with you.
-I'm sure you don't.

152
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,039
You lose your dress?

153
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,679
Come on. Let's have it.

154
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,069
My brother's 5 years old.
He doesn't fall for this jack!

155
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,431
Come on. Taste the real.

156
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,193
What the fuck is going on?
-He hurt my boys.

157
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,231
You're fighting.
What if you get hurt?

158
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,955
No way he's gonna hurt me.
-Mr. Horn has got money bet on you.

159
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,119
He finds out you're street fighting,
you're off the circuit.

160
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,910
Look. Shortcut fighting, Mr. Jack.

161
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,634
You see, that's what I do, boy.
I fight.

162
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,236
This ain't over, punk!

163
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,995
Hey!

164
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,919
How come I haven't seen you
around here before?

165
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,558
Nobody's asking you to win!

166
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,910
Just get into the goddamn
ring with him!

167
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,398
You run out on this, keep on running.
Horn's gonna be chomping on your ass.

168
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,556
Same to you, dick-breath.

169
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,438
Fuck you too!

170
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,077
Excuse me. Let me ask you something.
Can I join you?

171
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,113
It's a free country.

172
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,791
Would that were true, kid.
Would that were true.

173
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,877
The name is Jack. Pappy Jack.

174
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,913
And I can be the best goddamn pappy
you ever had.

175
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,712
I already got one.

176
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,391
Yeah. You threw
a hell of a punch out there.

177
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,918
Tell me. You fight? Box?

178
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,989
Golden Gloves. Over in Bridgeport.

179
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,875
Did you win?

180
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,792
Yeah. It was like five, six bouts.

181
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,558
You want something else?

182
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,914
Apple pie?

183
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,112
Oh, no. Maybe later.
-How about you?

184
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,154
A little privacy, please.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

185
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,112
We have these amateur bouts
every Friday night.

186
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,595
Some smokers, nothing special...

187
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,314
...but there's a lot
of bucks involved.

188
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,872
You fight a few rounds,
I'll make it worth your while.

189
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,675
How much?

190
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,632
Oh, now we're talking.

191
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,712
Now we're doing business.

192
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,389
Seven hundred and fifty bucks.

193
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,676
You'd pay me $750
to fight tomorrow night?

194
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,075
What is there, a fucking echo in here?

195
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,633
Who do I fight?

196
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,674
A guy named Black Death.

197
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,029
But don't worry.

198
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,239
He's not a fatal disease in any way.

199
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,112
You got the antidote.

200
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,036
There's a lot of tough kids
around here.

201
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,873
You have the right...

202
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,034
...complexion.

203
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,755
Lost my white kid.

204
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,993
My back's on the wall.

205
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,716
No, thanks.
-No, thanks?

206
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,671
How many dishes do you
have to wash for 750 bucks?

207
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,150
About 30,528.
-Thirty thousand five--

208
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,397
So what are you, an idiot?

209
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,591
I need 1250 bucks.

210
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,632
You negotiating with me?

211
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,314
That's what I need
to clear up a few debts.

212
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,035
I don't wanna hear any stories.
Do you wanna fight or don't you?

213
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,393
Don't get a hard-on! Are we
negotiating or aren't we?

214
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,599
I like you.

215
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,636
I like the way you handle yourself.

216
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,678
We're gonna do it your way.

217
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,870
Twelve hundred and fifty bucks.

218
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,589
Dad?

219
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,269
Tommy.

220
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,274
Tommy.

221
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,551
Wake up. I got some great news.
-Hey, Dad.

222
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,115
You know that job I've been
telling you about?

223
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,834
I got it.

224
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,076
Starting today I'm on the payroll.
-That's great.

225
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,838
Yeah, that's great.

226
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,636
Bad part is, I gotta be in Elgin at 10,
and then go on the road for a month.

227
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,510
A month?

228
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,558
Selling medical supplies.

229
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,150
I learn the territory, then they bring
me to work full-time in Chicago.

230
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,352
We can get out of this slum
and get our lives back together.

231
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,831
But the deal is, you're
gonna be alone for a month.

232
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,598
You think you can handle that?

233
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,117
You sure?
-Yeah.

234
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,999
How's the new school?

235
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,834
It's okay.

236
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,028
What's wrong, Tommy?

237
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,192
These guys showed up.

238
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,633
One of them had a gun.

239
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,874
Did they threaten you?
-No.

240
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,952
Come here, son. Sit down.

241
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,151
Listen, Tommy. You know....

242
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,632
I know I wasn't any help to you
when your mother died.

243
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,274
I was drinking a lot, I lost the job,
and I was dumb enough to think...

244
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,354
...I could win big money
playing cards and...

245
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,078
...pay the hospital bills.

246
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,313
And I'm sorry to bring you
into all this.

247
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,954
But you know...

248
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,034
...if we hadn't wound up in this dump,
maybe I would've never woken up.

249
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,712
I'm awake now.

250
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,917
I'm not drinking,
and I'm not gambling, and...

251
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,635
...I'm not feeling sorry for myself.
And I got this job.

252
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,752
These guys will get paid.
They're gonna get their money.

253
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,234
Sharkey? John Riley.

254
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,954
If you ever bother my kid again,
I'll kill you.

255
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,270
Yeah, I don't care. I mean it!

256
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,998
You will get your
goddamn cash, Sharkey.

257
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,439
I'll see you soon.

258
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,755
You take care.

259
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,074
Where are you going?

260
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,838
I'm supposed to fight.

261
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,194
Tommy Riley.

262
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,393
Why don't you come with me?

263
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,155
Let's go, kid.

264
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,554
Hey, kid.

265
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,752
I thought you were a no-show.
-I'm on time.

266
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,838
Sure you're on time.
It's not you, it's me.

267
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,713
I think everybody's a no-show
until they show.

268
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,275
This is your corner man.
Your all-around man.

269
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,717
How you doing?
-Hi. Try these.

270
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,640
What are these, 6-ounce gloves?

271
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,037
Are these even legal?
-Legal?

272
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,799
I gotta tell you, kid.

273
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,754
It ain't "mairZy doats
and doZy doats" out there.

274
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,234
It's war.

275
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,710
You fight Black Death like
the Marquis of Queensbury, and...

276
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,797
...you'll be carried out
in a body bag.

277
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,195
But, hey. Good luck!

278
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,275
What's your name?

279
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,919
They call me Noah.

280
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,669
Only I ain't got no damn ark.
And I ain't even got a rowboat.

281
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,236
All I got is a broken nose
and a bunch of recollections.

282
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,352
You got recollections, boy?
-Yeah. Some.

283
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,592
You young yet. They accumulate.

284
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,359
Believe me.

285
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,833
You grow up South Side?

286
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,758
No. Bridgeport.

287
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,516
Bridgeport?

288
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,592
You're moving in the wrong direction.

289
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,711
It's just temporary.

290
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,357
I got another boy to look to.

291
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,518
I'll be back to get you.

292
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,119
You on the circuit now?

293
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,515
No. Just tonight.

294
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,988
Mind if I join you?
-Not at all.

295
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,797
Say, don't you know nothing?

296
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,318
Circulate that blood, man.

297
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,236
Gotta tap dance before
you tap dance...

298
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,117
...if you know what I mean.

299
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,634
I'm just trying to get my bearings.
-Move with me man.

300
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,877
You go in cold,
you gonna come out cold too.

301
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,279
Name's Essadro.

302
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,669
Romano Essadro.

303
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,199
Tommy Riley.

304
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,554
You lrish?

305
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,639
Yeah, so?

306
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,276
Ain't no accusation. It's
just a whatchamacallit...

307
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,396
...ethnicity.

308
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,792
Like me. I'm Cuban, but I ain't
never seen the island paradise.

309
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,672
Who you fighting, anyways?

310
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,189
Some guy named Black Death.

311
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,037
You been fighting somewheres else?

312
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,114
Not a lot.

313
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,715
Listen. You stay clear of his
right hand, you hear?

314
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,717
Come here. Come on.

315
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,268
Put your left hand up.

316
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,238
Circle right. Good.

317
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,192
Circle right. Circle right.

318
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,038
Good. That's it.

319
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,117
What time is it?
-It's time to get paid!

320
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,958
Hammer-time, brother!

321
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,392
Shit, man, I could've had you.

322
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,311
Hit your fucking head off!

323
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,759
Okay, Bridgeport.

324
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,995
You're up.

325
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,274
Good luck, man.

326
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,717
Ladies and gentlemen,
our fourth bout of the evening!

327
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,431
We have a newcomer to the arena.

328
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,079
Tommy Riley.

329
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,589
A Golden Gloves champion
from Bridgeport.

330
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,634
He's 27 and 0, with 21 knockouts.

331
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,513
He'll be fighting out
of the Red corner tonight.

332
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,630
Come on, folks.

333
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,673
Let's hear it for him.
Let's give him a big welcome.

334
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,871
Tommy Riley!

335
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,799
And his opponent...

336
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,870
...fighting out of the Blue corner,
the doctor of destruction...

337
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,630
...Black Death!

338
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,637
What do you know about this guy?

339
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,957
If he hurts you with his left,
go down.

340
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,796
Beautiful.

341
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,034
Fighters.

342
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,433
I want a nice clean fight now.
You know the rules.

343
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,313
No low blows and
you break when I say.

344
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,790
Now touch gloves
and come out fighting.

345
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,673
That's the elbow!

346
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,757
Get up, kid. Come on, get up.

347
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,232
All right. Keep fighting.

348
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,515
All right!

349
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,715
Who's the brawler?

350
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,717
He's got a punch. That's all I know.

351
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,638
Ain't you getting tired, punk?

352
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,399
Can't you hit me once?

353
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,914
Stick him, kid. Come on.

354
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,069
One!

355
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,156
Two!

356
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,554
Three!

357
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,954
Four!

358
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,390
Oh, no.

359
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,631
That's it. That's it, he's finished.

360
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,915
One!

361
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,109
Two!

362
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,309
Three!

363
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,675
Four!

364
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,949
Five!

365
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,036
Six!

366
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,070
Seven!

367
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,349
Eight!

368
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,071
All right! Hit him!

369
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,794
Kill the guy!

370
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,590
All right!

371
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,630
Get him.

372
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,594
All right, kid!

373
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,393
Where did you find this kid?

374
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,556
On the street. He just walked in.

375
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,432
Leo, give me a Crunch.

376
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,711
I might lose my investment.

377
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,397
You're doing all right, kid.
You're doing all right!

378
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,352
What the hell are you doing?
You're looking like a bum!

379
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,273
Now. He's telegraphing his punches.

380
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,119
He gets set with the right...

381
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,880
...he drops the left,
and you stick him.

382
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,399
Repeat it back to me.

383
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,716
He drops the left. I stick him.

384
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,117
Okay, kid! Go out and get it!

385
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,880
Stay with him, okay? Hang in there.

386
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,030
Now!

387
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,799
Jesus Christ!

388
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,315
Look at this kid.

389
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,353
Oh, my God!

390
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,792
You are a natural, kid.

391
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,275
You got firepower. Real firepower!

392
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,559
The winner is Tommy Riley!

393
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,796
He's mine! He's mine!

394
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,072
You got the balls of a lion, kid.
You got him!

395
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,475
He's mine! Mine!

396
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,755
What do you think?
-He's gonna be just fine.

397
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,835
How you feeling, kid?

398
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,315
This feels good, doesn't it? Good.

399
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,309
So where's my money?

400
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,109
Don't worry.
You're gonna get your money.

401
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,754
Mr. Horn wants to pay you personally.

402
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,949
Who's Mr. Horn?

403
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,277
He is the power and the glory--
-Yeah, he's the power.

404
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,913
Right now.

405
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,395
He's the reason that you got
into the ring.

406
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,596
No, he's not.

407
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,032
Goddamn it. I gotta go.

408
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,549
Come by the gym, get your money,
and we talk.

409
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,716
You're fucking beautiful. Beautiful!

410
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,549
Talk about what?

411
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,393
Great! Oh, you earned it.
Keep working.

412
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,869
Mr. Riley.

413
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,073
What door did you walk into?

414
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,673
Maybe he bumped into his pseudonym.
-That's enough.

415
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,036
Hey.

416
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,550
Hey, how are you doing, Romano?
-Feeling no pain.

417
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,593
I win too.

418
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,912
Lincoln.
-Hey, what's up?

419
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,633
Meet my friend Tommy Riley.

420
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,193
The great white hope?

421
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,155
Not me, man.

422
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,349
No?

423
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,437
What was that Friday night, a ghost?

424
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,593
Let me tell you something.
Some ghost, looked just like you...

425
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,677
...wasted Black Death.

426
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,393
That's Lincoln.

427
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,877
You looking for something, chief?

428
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,355
Pappy Jack.

429
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,919
In his office.

430
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,629
All right from Horn.

431
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,835
This one's from me.

432
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,679
Say hello to Mike.

433
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,955
Hey, kid. Be right there.

434
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,359
Just knock his timing.

435
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,798
With the elbow, right? And--
End of story. All right?

436
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,195
You're gonna give him something to
shoot at.

437
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,870
He comes in, to the body, hook it.
Just for a second.

438
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,397
I find the way you fight
terribly exciting.

439
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,160
Oh, I'm just trying
to get out of there alive.

440
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,874
Aren't we all, my dear.

441
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,956
Hey, kid!

442
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,108
You like M&M Peanuts?

443
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,436
Jesus Christ, don't muscle it!

444
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,399
That's Mr. Horn. Listen up.
You might learn.

445
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,559
You think it's all about strength, but
it's not. You think it's all speed.

446
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,389
Strategy! Look, you gotta find
your opponent's weakness...

447
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,591
...and then you exploit it.

448
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,872
Now listen to me. Youth is a tool.
All right?

449
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,038
It's a good tool,
but it's only one of the tools.

450
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,869
There's also knowledge. There's....
There's focus. Strategy.

451
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,911
You think you can whup my ass?

452
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,992
What do you think?
-I'm tired of thinking, motherfu--

453
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,196
Oh, shit.

454
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,155
He's playing possum.

455
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,994
Mr. Horn and Mr. Good Chocolate,
best fucking finishers I ever saw.

456
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,840
All right. See?

457
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,393
Strategy.

458
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,399
You got more of a show
than you bargained for.

459
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,989
You still got it.
-Yeah.

460
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,953
I feel better already.

461
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,038
You got some on your lip there.
Very sexy.

462
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,791
Give him a rest.
Put him against Lincoln.

463
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,069
Got too much weight.

464
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,872
Put him in with Lincoln...

465
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,356
...and bet the farm against him.

466
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,471
He ain't got it upstairs.

467
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,359
Tommy Riley!

468
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,115
Hello.

469
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,391
You the boy I've been waiting for?

470
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,069
No.

471
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,753
Take good care of this boy.
Give him whatever he wants.

472
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,472
What do you want, Tommy?

473
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,150
I just want the money that you owe me.

474
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,199
Go ahead.

475
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,958
Of course that.

476
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,954
On top of that, what?
-That's all I want.

477
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,755
How refreshing. Everyone else I meet
has their hand out.

478
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,198
You know, Tommy.

479
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,156
I should be upset with you.

480
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,669
Why?

481
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,231
You cost me my investment.

482
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,113
What's that mean?

483
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,675
Means Black Death is
damaged goods, kid.

484
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,113
So now I'm invested in you.

485
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,795
How would you like
to fight for me, Tommy?

486
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,509
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Horn,
but I'm not interested.

487
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,513
Come on, kid.
If it's a matter of money--

488
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,034
No, it's not the money.

489
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,310
I don't wanna end up
without a brain.

490
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,274
Don't be stupid, kid. Mr. Horn is
giving you a terrific shot here.

491
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,915
Tommy.

492
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,315
I respect your decision.

493
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,388
Been a pleasure meeting you.

494
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,116
Likewise. I guess.

495
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,795
Good luck to you.

496
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,549
Get him.

497
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,428
Hey, Tommy.

498
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,593
Hey, Romano.

499
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,033
I got you something.

500
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,558
I was buying some new duds.

501
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,797
I thought, "Hey, my amigo
needs a little style."

502
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,029
You like it or what?

503
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,231
Yeah. I'm....

504
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,792
This is my first hat.

505
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,674
You look sharp, man.

506
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,279
How about me?

507
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,357
Real sharp, Romano.

508
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,358
Yeah. You got to be a....

509
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,552
You got to be a real
perverse individual...

510
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,831
...pass up this kind of money.

511
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,918
It's got a bad smell.

512
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,675
Hey, maybe it don't give off
the best odor...

513
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,269
...but it smells better
than any other chances.

514
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,674
Once I save some...

515
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,869
...I'm gonna do
what I promised my old man.

516
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,194
I'm gonna go ship his body
back to Romano, Cuba.

517
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,278
That's where he was born,
and how come I got my name.

518
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,909
Then you'll quit, right?

519
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,758
You craZy, man?

520
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,598
I'm gonna get a real apartment.

521
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,349
A stereo, TV, VCR.

522
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,035
Gonna buy a waterbed.

523
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,998
I like you, Romano.

524
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,757
You take care of yourself.

525
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,273
Just because you quit....

526
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,718
Hey, Sharkey. Pappy Jack.

527
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,715
You still with me when I make my move?

528
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,918
Listen, you son of a bitch.

529
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,793
There's a couple of your collectors
down here.

530
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,799
All right.

531
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,395
Yeah....

532
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,949
Soda?

533
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,868
I didn't think you'd be at work
last night.

534
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,718
Why not?

535
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,469
Why would a person wash dishes
when they can make money boxing?

536
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,878
I'm not boxing anymore.
That was a one-shot deal.

537
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,953
I can't figure you out.

538
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,673
Neither can l.

539
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,515
Hey, Tommy.

540
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,032
How are you doing, kid?

541
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,315
I'm doing.

542
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,559
Mr. Horn wants to see you.

543
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,119
Well, I'm busy right now.

544
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,316
Sweetheart, I know half a doZen ways
to make a guy get into an automobile.

545
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,833
Bye, Tommy.

546
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,958
Just telling you one thing, kid.
I found you.

547
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,752
I brought you in.

548
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,793
Don't you forget that.

549
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,717
Come on in, kid. Give him a call.
Tell him I'm not happy.

550
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,514
Keep an eye on it for me.

551
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,673
Let me know what he says.

552
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,513
Those pictures.

553
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,111
Gladiators, Tommy.

554
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,151
They fought with their bare hands.

555
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,031
Fifty, a hundred rounds.

556
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,511
Next day they go back to work.

557
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,719
They were tough.

558
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,750
Tough in body, tough in mind.

559
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,910
And they understood about strategy.

560
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,872
When you're weak, you act strong.
And when you're strong...

561
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,308
...pretend to be weak.

562
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,554
Care for some champagne?

563
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,233
No, I don't drink.

564
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,749
Why did you wanna see me?

565
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,872
I was hoping you had a chance
to think things over.

566
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,597
Come aboard, Tommy.
Three grand a fight.

567
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,390
That is very generous. But I'm not--
-Kid, money is talking.

568
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,429
Well, maybe it's not talking to me.

569
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,476
Tommy.

570
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,713
Sit down, Tommy.

571
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,592
Come on. Sit down. Relax.

572
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,274
Why don't we be straight
with each other?

573
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,390
I can't afford to let you go.

574
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,598
I'm my own man, Mr. Horn.

575
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,512
Nobody is his own man.

576
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,591
Not from the day we're born.

577
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,678
Everybody owes.

578
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,677
Somebody. Something.

579
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,469
Who do you owe?

580
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,431
Me? Who do I owe?

581
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,749
God.

582
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,396
Don't we all. Amen.

583
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,158
But some of us...

584
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,839
...some of us owe....

585
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,713
Jack, show him.

586
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,518
Here you go. Read them and weep.

587
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,948
Look at the signatures.

588
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,078
Those are markers.

589
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,952
Your father's markers.

590
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,752
Your father has managed
to accumulate gambling debts...

591
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,236
...somewhere in the neighborhood
of $15,000.

592
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,829
That's an expensive neighborhood
to be in.

593
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,395
There's evil people in this world,
Tommy.

594
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,750
Nasty people, like Sharkey.

595
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:03,671
Your old man gives him a song about
waiting a few weeks, then giving 50°%.

596
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,759
Sharkey's gonna give him concrete
boots and throw him in the river.

597
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,997
So I did your old man a favor.
I did you a favor.

598
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,599
I bought the debts.

599
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,911
Those debts are mine now.

600
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,915
Do you understand?

601
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,670
And what's mine is yours.

602
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,029
Okay.

603
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,149
Okay.

604
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,790
Come on.

605
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,556
Hey!

606
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,073
Well, look who's next.
-Leave him alone!

607
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,193
Sure, after we carve our initials
in his butt. Get him!

608
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,389
Run, hotshot!

609
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,478
Come on. Move. Move!

610
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,515
Rats.

611
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,029
Don't worry though.

612
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,078
Ain't the human kind.

613
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,994
Damn it!
-Don't worry. We'll find them.

614
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,034
What's worse? Getting skinned by
Shortcut or owing some white boy?

615
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,389
You don't owe me.

616
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,758
How come you do it?

617
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,318
Save my ass.

618
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,669
I don't know.

619
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,189
See somebody in trouble, you know--

620
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,078
I've been in trouble
since the day I was born.

621
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,235
No white boy come to my rescue.

622
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,957
Maybe there were no white boys around.

623
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,718
Say that again.

624
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,391
Poverty is a black disease.

625
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,428
Not just.

626
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,869
No?

627
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,915
I hear you wannna be a college boy.

628
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,396
You think I'm going to college?

629
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,315
You could.

630
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,556
I got one chance.

631
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,270
One chance for my baby,
and that's this, right here. These.

632
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,758
What do you mean, your baby?

633
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,513
That's my lady.

634
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,119
Laura Lee.

635
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,151
She just turned 16.

636
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,598
That's Cecilia.

637
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,436
They're beautiful. Both of them.

638
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,950
I call her Baby Black Beauty.

639
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,838
That's her nickname.

640
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,679
Not many fighters like Lincoln
can give this much weight.

641
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,271
One! Two!

642
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,948
Three! Four!

643
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,071
Five! Six!

644
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,672
He can't do that!

645
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,759
Who's to stop him?

646
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,234
One!

647
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,873
Two!

648
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,149
Three!

649
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,793
Four!

650
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,793
Gonna ruin him.

651
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,797
Seven!

652
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,319
Eight!

653
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,839
Nine!

654
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,352
The harder they fall, eh?

655
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,952
How much do you think we made?

656
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,833
A bundle.

657
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,318
So tell me about Horn.

658
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,953
Oh, Lord.

659
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,671
Mr. Horn was supposed to be the light
heavyweight champion of the world.

660
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,075
God gave him one bad foot.

661
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,589
They operate.

662
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,034
Don't work.

663
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,468
Try it again.

664
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,752
Same thing.

665
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,350
By the time he's ready to fight again,
he's lost too many years.

666
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,438
But he's smart.

667
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,435
He sees more money upstairs and
a lot less danger to boot.

668
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,515
Anybody ever beat him?

669
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,158
Before his foot go, he lost one fight.
I remember.

670
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,316
Comeback, rematch.

671
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,591
He punished that man.

672
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,678
Retired him for life.

673
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,555
No.

674
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,192
He ain't got no weaknesses.

675
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,431
It's not what Horn says.

676
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,918
What do you mean, son?

677
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,152
Well, he says that everybody's
got a weakness.

678
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,555
Well....

679
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,032
I'm looking, son.

680
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,512
I am looking.

681
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,791
All right, all right. I'm coming.

682
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,275
I was just....
-Come on in.

683
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,358
Where you been, Tommy?

684
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,311
People are asking.
You're not at school or Millie's.

685
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,669
Yeah, I know.

686
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,315
Well....

687
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,430
Miss Higgins asked me
to give you this.

688
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,950
You're really applying
to junior college?

689
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,434
Also...

690
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,796
...your paper on Mark Twain.

691
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,671
Miss Higgins read it in class.

692
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,550
She says you're full of promise.

693
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,233
Yeah, that's me. Full of promise.

694
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,271
It's nothing to make fun of.

695
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,399
Well, I don't have time for school
right now.

696
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,949
I gotta fight.

697
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,157
You told me you weren't fighting.

698
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,434
That was a lie because
I gotta fight four more times.

699
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,113
Nobody has to fight.

700
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,719
No?
-No.

701
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,717
Be honest. You want the money.

702
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,478
But it's illegal, Tommy.

703
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,835
I know.

704
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,156
But if I don't fight,
Horn will kill him.

705
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,035
How do you know your dad
won't keep gambling?

706
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,195
I can see it. It's in his eyes.

707
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,758
He's kind of like he was
before my mom died.

708
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,714
When did she--?
-About a year ago.

709
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,239
The big "C."

710
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,394
I'm sorry.

711
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,998
It's when I started boxing.

712
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,554
Punch the feelings out, I guess.

713
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,999
This is my house.

714
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,554
Good deal.

715
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,312
I have to go.

716
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,109
Dawn!

717
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,312
Mom's waiting at the diner.

718
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,513
I'm sorry, Dad.
I didn't realiZe the time.

719
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,229
Bye.

720
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,753
See you at school.

721
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,109
Flick it.

722
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,515
I'm gonna get you, Snow White!

723
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,716
Tomorrow night I'm gonna
get you, spic.

724
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,558
Just for being his friend.

725
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,310
Don't be talking that Spanish shit--

726
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,795
What was that?

727
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,192
Told him to go fuck a goat.

728
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,395
Good.

729
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,435
I owed you that.

730
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,153
See you later, amigo.

731
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,388
You're terrific, man.
You got some hammer, huh?

732
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,919
Thanks, Romano.

733
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,914
Here I go.

734
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,840
They're calling, kid. You're up.

735
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,475
Come watch me, hombre.

736
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,310
I'm gonna dance until he's diZZy.

737
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,994
Come at me, son.

738
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,553
Fighter's stance.

739
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,076
You see? You're fighting head-on.
Eye to eye.

740
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,555
That is not the way.

741
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,790
Like this.

742
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,634
To an angle. Back, right.

743
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,912
Fighting is not hitting.

744
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,712
Any fool can hit.

745
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,515
Fighting is making
the other fellow miss.

746
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,798
He miss.

747
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,514
He think. He worry.

748
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,551
It's a mind game, huh?

749
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,718
I knew a fellow once.

750
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,071
He won a fight with one arm.
One arm!

751
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,515
His spirit told him to win.

752
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,150
His mind showed him how.

753
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,353
And his body delivered!

754
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,472
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

755
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,069
Damn it!

756
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,393
You're beautiful.

757
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,999
Stick and move. Stick and move.

758
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,794
He called me a spic.
-So what? You are.

759
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,192
Give it to me. Give it to me!

760
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,629
Come on.

761
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,873
Fix my hair.

762
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,074
What's the matter with you?
Concentrate on this fight.

763
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,716
Hey, great fight, man.

764
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,912
Great fight!
-Dude, right on.

765
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,116
Break! Break!

766
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,711
Stop the fight!

767
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,153
Come on. Get him out of there.

768
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,513
It don't pay to be your friend.

769
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,355
Get off me!

770
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,232
I'll kill his ass!

771
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,274
You're next! You're next!

772
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,196
Fuck! Fucker.

773
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:08,637
Where's Romano?
-I don't know names, just bodies.

774
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,678
They carried him out of the ring.
He was unconscious.

775
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,359
I sent him to the hospital.

776
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,829
What hospital?

777
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,919
Horn makes the arrangements.

778
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,158
If you'll excuse me,
I'd like to complete this exam.

779
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,676
Hey, kid.

780
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,359
Hey, Dad. How you doing?

781
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,838
Charlie Mannman says that
I can sell ice to Eskimos.

782
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,350
In a bliZZard, that's what he says.

783
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,354
That's great, Dad.
So you got the old touch back, huh?

784
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,592
Everything's rolling right along.
How about you?

785
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,994
How's things in school?

786
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,269
It's good.

787
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,835
Nothing's wrong? Those goons ever
show up and bother you again?

788
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,352
No, they never came back.

789
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,758
No, no, I'm fine.

790
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,189
Really.

791
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,999
So when are you coming home?

792
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,479
I'm not gonna be back
for another couple of weeks.

793
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,068
I put a check in the mail for you.

794
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,914
Yeah, I got it. Thanks.

795
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,314
Okay, good. Well....

796
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,039
You take care then, okay?

797
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,071
All right, you take care too.

798
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,635
Bye-bye.

799
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,273
All right, bye.

800
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,598
Mr. Riley.

801
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,315
Would you mind joining
the rest of the class?

802
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,833
Papers on my desk.

803
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,995
Can you stay a moment, Mr. Riley?

804
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:08,474
You haven't been to school
for a few days.

805
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,990
Can you tell me what's going on?

806
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,394
I'm sorry. I can't.

807
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,839
That's too bad.

808
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,552
You have a gift
for language, Mr. Riley.

809
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,753
But talent is a common thing.

810
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,354
People waste it every day.

811
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,717
They abuse it.
They take it for granted.

812
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,151
Success comes not from what
God has given you...

813
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,749
...but what you do with it.

814
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,672
It's really up to you.

815
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,989
Thanks.

816
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,119
Are you okay?

817
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,677
Romano's in the hospital.

818
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,110
ls he bad?
-I think so.

819
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,836
I'll see you at the diner, okay?

820
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,030
My mom hired a new dishwasher.

821
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,512
I'll see you tomorrow?

822
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,118
Romano Essadro.

823
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,912
Is he a patient there?

824
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,631
E-S-S-A-D-R-O.

825
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,910
All right. Thank you.

826
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,879
If I was you...

827
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:03,278
...I'd start looking at the County
Hospital for the Poor and lndigent.

828
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,476
Hey, Romano, it's Tommy Riley.

829
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,230
No use in knocking that door.

830
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,877
Doc say he in a gang war.

831
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,753
Bastards leave him brain-dead.

832
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,992
Romano, wake up.

833
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,679
Buddy, wake up.

834
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,309
Wake up!

835
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,632
I've given your instructions.

836
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,393
I want a nice clean fight.
Now shake hands.

837
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,593
How's Romano? Is he dead yet?

838
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,553
I mean, he dead, ain't he?

839
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,754
Listen! Listen to me!

840
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,639
You're angry.

841
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,872
That's what's gonna
get you beat!

842
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,911
Anger is your enemy!

843
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,749
It's like I told you.

844
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,678
It's a mind game!

845
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,156
Outthink him!

846
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:35,033
And then get in there
and out-fight him, okay?

847
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,995
That's all right. I ain't gonna wait.
Give it to me now.

848
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,595
How's your new girlfriend, huh?
How's Dawn?

849
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,836
I'll have to get me
a little bit of that.

850
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,718
That's it! Hit him, hit him!

851
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:25,830
All right!

852
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,033
Come on! Drop him!

853
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,956
Finish him!
-Put his lights out!

854
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,116
I think we may have our boy.

855
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,149
Come on! Hit him, hit him!

856
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,191
Finish him, finish him!

857
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,596
What, are you working
on a merit badge?

858
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,072
Hey, my man.
You're something else.

859
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,952
Hey, hotshot.

860
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:31,550
This is the white boy I told you
saved my black ass.

861
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,959
Appreciate that, because
I love his ass.

862
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,076
And that's my Black Beauty.

863
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,912
Say hi.

864
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,273
You want a lift?

865
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,193
You want to hold her?

866
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,396
Shit, Linc! You gotta teach that
child to hate white folks, man.

867
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,271
This is a pretty sweet car, Lincoln.

868
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,919
Horn's renting it.

869
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,951
What he calls one of my perks.

870
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,277
On account of
I'm his "Numero Uno Negro."

871
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,192
Horn's a real scumbag.

872
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,150
What, you just now realiZe that?

873
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,717
Tell you, the whole world's
crammed full of them, my brother.

874
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:26,988
Thanks.

875
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,119
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

876
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,719
Don't worry about it.

877
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,798
See, that's holy water.
You're baptiZed now!

878
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,798
All right. Thanks for the ride.

879
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:06,515
I knew you were fighting
Shortcut tonight.

880
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,835
Jack Dempsey, Rocky Marciano...

881
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,156
...Barney Ross. You know what I mean?

882
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,156
No.

883
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,396
Come on, kid. Billy Conn?

884
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,039
Carmen Basilio?

885
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,992
"Slapsy Maxie" Rosenbloom?

886
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,269
Micks, wops, kikes!

887
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,397
The guys you'd fight
in the old days.

888
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,392
Tough white guys.

889
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,232
Just like you.

890
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,677
They had a need, just like you.

891
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,474
What do white kids need today,
a haircut?

892
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,749
Money for their own car so they
don't have to borrow daddy's keys?

893
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,274
Let's go, Lincoln.

894
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,559
Think about it.

895
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,069
That's enough.

896
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,078
You all right? You all right?

897
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,472
I'm okay. I'm okay.

898
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,272
Just look at my finger.

899
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,352
He wasn't hit that hard.

900
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,999
He was last week.

901
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,994
When he got kicked in the head
by that heavyweight.

902
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,634
Same thing happened to my friend
Choo-Choo Charlie.

903
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,670
What?

904
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,719
Didn't lay off like he was supposed to.

905
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,638
End up paralyZed.

906
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,594
What's the matter with him?

907
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,797
It could be nothing.
It could be a bleed.

908
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,315
Bleed?
-Blood vessel in his head.

909
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,710
It's not serious, though,
if he rests.

910
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,593
I'm recommending a 60-day layoff.

911
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,028
How you doing?

912
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,953
No drama, hotshot.

913
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,673
Sixty days.

914
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,757
It comes with the territory.

915
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,160
What's Enrico doing
in the ring with Tiny Tim?

916
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,632
What do you think he's doing?
He's trying to knock him on his ass.

917
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,068
I'm supposed to fight Enrico.

918
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,392
You were, but...

919
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,115
...we found a last-minute replacement.

920
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,992
Going for the jackpot.

921
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,272
Mr. Horn's offering 20 G's
to the winner.

922
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,593
No time for charity, kid.

923
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,319
Go for it.

924
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,876
I knew this was coming, Ghost.

925
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,033
No hard feelings, huh?

926
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,038
When I make your face
look like Burger King.

927
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,796
I thought you were gonna
take some time off.

928
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,710
Horn persuaded me otherwise.

929
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:13,913
See, I win this, he's taking me pro.

930
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,031
Madison Square Garden.

931
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,673
I won't do it.

932
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,275
I ain't gonna fight you!

933
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,112
What do you want me to do?

934
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,709
I got no choice, Ghost.

935
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,992
This is my ticket. Right here.

936
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,592
Don't mess with that.

937
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,672
If you're my friend,
don't fuck with my life.

938
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,034
Lincoln's got a bleed.
He could die if he's hit hard.

939
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,315
Know how many times I've heard
that nonsense about bleeds?

940
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,835
How many times I've personally
seen it disproved?

941
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,190
Your doctor said Lincoln
needs 60 days rest.

942
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,356
That sawbones? We fired him.

943
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:10,674
If it was up to the medical profession,
there wouldn't be any boxing.

944
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:14,152
I'm not fighting Lincoln.
-Yes, you are.

945
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:17,557
You're gonna fight him and beat him.
I'm gonna make a lot of money.

946
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,228
Because Lincoln's a big
favorite out there.

947
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,670
And after you've beaten Lincoln...

948
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:25,836
...we'll have a chat about your future.

949
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,830
You understand?
-Fuck you.

950
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,517
What, are these guys gonna kill me?

951
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,872
I certainly hope not.

952
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,393
You see, Tommy...

953
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,916
...you're the boy
I've been looking for.

954
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:51,276
Don't you know what you can be?

955
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,116
I'm talking welterweight champ.

956
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:59,389
I'm talking 2 million bucks in your
pocket when you fight for the title.

957
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,554
Broads love you, people love you.

958
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:06,311
Everywhere you go people say, "How are
you, champ? We love you, champ!"

959
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,314
You could have a high rise
on the moon, kid.

960
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,474
I'm trying to concentrate.

961
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,913
Be careful, huh?

962
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:34,916
All right!

963
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,829
When Lincoln loses, there's gonna be
a riot in here, so get him out fast.

964
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,473
Leo, let's go.

965
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,035
What have we here?
How are you, beautiful?

966
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,796
Come on. Let's go see the action.

967
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,514
Ladies and gentlemen!

968
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:55,472
The fight you've been waiting for.
The main event of the evening!

969
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,557
Fighting out of the Blue corner...

970
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,838
...Abraham Lincoln Haines.

971
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,792
Mr. Horn, Charlene, this
is Tommy Riley's fiancée.

972
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,833
We're not engaged.
-Just shacking up? Sorry.

973
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,519
Here's your boy now.

974
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,069
Come on, sit down.

975
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,708
Sit, sit. Here, next to me.

976
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,072
His opponent in the Red corner,
the Bridgeport Bomber.

977
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:38,637
Undefeated in five appearances
in this arena, Tommy Riley!

978
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,473
All right, post the odds.

979
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,632
2200, Blue.
-I got 2200 on Blue. Done.

980
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:04,955
Give me 300 on the Red.
-Done.

981
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,393
You know why people get
so excited at fights?

982
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,991
It's the presence of death.

983
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:41,514
Come on.

984
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,236
Stick him, Lincoln! Stick him!

985
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,830
Break!

986
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,192
What the hell is this?

987
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,751
One! Two!

988
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,195
Fight me, Ghost!

989
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,356
Fight me, or I'm gonna hurt you bad!

990
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,070
Six! Seven!

991
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:23,629
Box!

992
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,957
Break. Damn it. Break!

993
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:39,912
Are you gonna fight me?
-Break!

994
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,119
Let me go! Get the--

995
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,275
Break!

996
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:46,550
Box!

997
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,836
If you don't fight, Horn won't pay!

998
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,674
Fuck!

999
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,559
I could fight you both!

1000
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,270
Leo?
Leo! Come here.

1001
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,036
Kid?
-Get out of here!

1002
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,748
Mr. Horn would like you
to see who he's sitting with.

1003
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,393
I think you'd better look.

1004
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,557
Do we feel like fighting now?

1005
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,519
You gonna beat me on my body?

1006
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,438
Beat the body, the head
goes down with it.

1007
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,949
Yeah, but you ain't good enough.

1008
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,912
Hit him. Hit him in the head!

1009
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:54,995
Use the left! Sock him!

1010
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:09,198
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1011
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,912
Break! Now!

1012
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,917
Get up! Get up, you punk!

1013
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,838
One! Two!

1014
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:27,635
Three!

1015
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,797
If I lose, Horn's gonna
hurt my girlfriend.

1016
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,911
But I'm still not gonna
hit you in the head.

1017
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,669
You're gonna have to kill me!

1018
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,235
One! Two!

1019
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,118
Are you gonna kill me?

1020
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,593
Horn wants us to kill
each other. For what?

1021
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,552
So he can get rich?

1022
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,196
Fight!

1023
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,674
One! Two!

1024
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,678
Three! Four!

1025
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,070
Five! Six!

1026
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:27,559
Put them up!

1027
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:29,872
Come get your money.

1028
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,079
Go on and do it.

1029
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,956
If you're gonna do it, do it now!

1030
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:41,835
Lincoln, take him down!

1031
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,519
Take him down, now!

1032
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,036
Damn you.

1033
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,798
Damn you to hell.

1034
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,837
Who do you think you are?

1035
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,359
Where do you think you're going?

1036
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,232
Get over there and kick his ass!

1037
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,118
You don't say no to me, boy!

1038
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,154
No.

1039
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:36,073
I'm not fighting for you no more.

1040
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,714
Come on, let's help him.

1041
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,279
Ladies and gentlemen...

1042
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,069
...the management wishes to apologiZe
for the fiasco.

1043
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:12,989
That's not a fight!
-I want my money back!

1044
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:17,034
Your wagers and your admission fee
will be refunded. Thank you.

1045
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,868
That's all right.
-I want you!

1046
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:25,956
What?

1047
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,276
I wanna fight you.
Right here, right now.

1048
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,518
What's in it for me?

1049
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,036
What have you got that
I could possibly want?

1050
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:38,955
Me.

1051
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:41,959
I get it.

1052
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:46,193
You fight me, you win,
and you're free.

1053
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,630
Is that it, huh?
You and your old man?

1054
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,597
Okay. But if I win...

1055
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,518
...when I win, you fucking
little punk...

1056
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,398
...you belong to me.

1057
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,228
Do you understand?

1058
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:02,999
You're mine.

1059
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,030
Deal.

1060
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:12,790
Ladies and gentlemen!

1061
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,959
Introducing the former number-one-
ranked light heavyweight contender:.

1062
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,718
Jimmy Horn!

1063
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,033
Cut them off!

1064
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,034
Those are our seats!

1065
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,389
I want a nice clean fight.
-You stay out of this.

1066
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:03,512
This is between him and me.
Ain't that right, Tommy?

1067
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,955
Protect yourself at all times, kid.

1068
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,072
Look at that face. Look at that face.

1069
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,911
You're gonna need that, aren't you?

1070
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,157
Come on. Take a shot. Here it is,
right there. Go ahead. Go ahead.

1071
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:23,551
The top of the head.
The hardest part of the body.

1072
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,113
What are you gonna do now?

1073
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:28,153
What are you gonna do now?
Here he comes.

1074
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,629
Miss. Big miss! I'm over here.

1075
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,998
What's under here?

1076
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,469
He hurt his hand!

1077
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,318
That's why they invented gloves!

1078
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:54,675
Stay away, kid! Move!

1079
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:02,829
Say good night, kid.

1080
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,320
Where you going now?
You better try something.

1081
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,837
That ain't good enough.
-Break!

1082
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,115
Break!

1083
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:28,235
Come on. Go to sleep,
go to sleep. That's it.

1084
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,269
One!

1085
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,639
Two!

1086
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:40,548
Three!

1087
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:42,673
Four!

1088
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,030
Five!

1089
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,232
Come on, kid.
Six!

1090
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,115
Seven!
You can make it.

1091
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:52,190
Eight!

1092
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:56,392
Nine!

1093
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:08,710
One!

1094
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:10,994
Two!

1095
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:12,036
Three!

1096
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,275
Stay down, kid.
-Four!

1097
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,517
Stay down!
-Five!

1098
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:16,789
Six!

1099
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,115
What's the matter?

1100
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,232
Can't you finish me?

1101
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,912
Top of the head!
Hardest part of the body!

1102
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,832
I thought you were a great finisher?

1103
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,950
Can't beat a kid with one arm?

1104
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,795
Anger is the enemy.

1105
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,514
Get him, Ghost!

1106
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:43,589
One! Two! Three!

1107
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,950
Four! Five!

1108
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:49,789
Six! Seven! Eight!

1109
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,992
Nine! Ten! You're out!

1110
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,795
You did it! You did it!

1111
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,197
And you didn't break your hand.

1112
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,039
"Make them think you're weak
when you're strong"!

1113
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,878
My man!

1114
