00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:33,040
You don't know if these are designated
the same as in the UK, do you?

2
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:37,561
The way they're numbered,
according to lead size?

3
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:41,035
Is the numbering system
for pencils universal?

4
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:44,364
- We would have no way of knowing that.
- No.

5
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:50,642
Well, it looks like it could be.
I think I'll assume it is.

6
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:56,486
Is your paper in individual sheets
or just in the pads?

7
00:03:56,607 --> 00:03:57,676
What?

8
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:01,561
I'll hang on to those while you look around.

9
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:03,405
Right.

10
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:10,763
Doesn't seem to mention acid content.
It usually says whether it's acid-free or not.

11
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:13,879
All paper in this country is acid-free.

12
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:16,316
- Really?
- That's how it goes.

13
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:20,440
Guess it's true what they say
about how far ahead you Americans are.

14
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:23,161
That's wonderful.

15
00:04:38,807 --> 00:04:42,197
- You with an art group?
- No, just on my own.

16
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:47,321
On some kind of personal tour, then?

17
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:48,436
No.

18
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:52,765
But you're an artist, right?
You're not a tourist?

19
00:04:52,887 --> 00:04:56,562
Harold here is just trying to find out
your purpose in bein' here.

20
00:04:56,687 --> 00:05:00,441
- My purpose?
- He won't be happy till you tell him.

21
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:05,197
I've always wanted
to visit your fine country.

22
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:08,841
I hope I have enough American money
for all this.

23
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:12,323
It's the only kind we accept.

24
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:15,519
$48 - that's more than enough, isn't it?

25
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,445
- You OK?
- Sorry. I just need some...

26
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,523
- Coloured pastels?
- Sleep.

27
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:24,719
- For your landscapes?
- I don't do landscapes, just portraits.

28
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:29,125
You've come all the way from England,
in the fall, with all our beautiful foliage,

29
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:31,317
to draw faces?

30
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:37,158
This comes to...
Look at that. $48 exactly.

31
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:43,126
- You wouldn't know of a good hotel?
- Joanie Fisher usually has rooms.

32
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:48,401
Now her husband - there's a face
that'll move you on to doin' landscapes.

33
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:51,166
Battlefield Inn. Straight up that street.

34
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:13,001
You want to draw
a portrait of Fisher?

35
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:17,996
- I was just told that his face looked...
- His face looks like road kill.

36
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,437
- But you will ask him?
- I can't wait.

37
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:25,636
There you go, Mr Ware.
Room 11. One of our best.

38
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:28,361
It's up the stairs on the left.

39
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:40,402
Mr Ware, do you have urgent business
to attend to this mornin'?

40
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:42,882
Why don't you get a few hours' sleep?

41
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:46,682
Just tell me what time you wanna wake up
and I'll hold all your calls.

42
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,321
There won't be any calls.
I don't know anyone here.

43
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:53,281
- Maybe a call from England.
- Nobody in England knows I'm here.

44
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,605
Oh, God.

45
00:06:55,727 --> 00:07:00,323
Sorry. I didn't know jet lag could be like
this. I've never had my hair hurt before.

46
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:03,041
Oh, Mr Ware.

47
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:05,641
I don't like to see
one of our guests so gloomy.

48
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:09,316
Why don't you help yourself
to a local-interest brochure?

49
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:11,597
You might find something to pick you up,

50
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:15,083
give you a little memory or two
to take back to England.

51
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:18,085
- It's memories that I came here to forget.
- Memories?

52
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:22,485
- Of something, or someone?
- Oh, God...

53
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:27,083
A woman.

54
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:31,562
An English woman?

55
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:37,516
Welsh. Well, half-Welsh.

56
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:41,117
- Half-Welsh and half...?
- Monster.

57
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,726
- My, we are in a bad way.
- What's the bloody point?

58
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:47,645
The point is, Mr Ware,
you're our guest here,

59
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:51,157
and part of our job
is to do everything in our power

60
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:54,006
to ensure our guests enjoy themselves.

61
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:59,406
And if that means one of 'em has
to talk an ex-girlfriend out of their system...

62
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:01,279
Joanie Fisher speaking.

63
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:03,125
...then so be it.

64
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:05,203
Hi, Mandy. How are you?

65
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:15,398
Mandy, I just have a small incident
to attend to in the lobby.

66
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,964
A dog? No.

67
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:24,126
No, that's just
one of our friends from England.

68
00:08:25,007 --> 00:08:27,157
I'll call you right back.

69
00:08:28,127 --> 00:08:32,723
So listen, while you're asleep I'm gonna
call my friend Mandy, get her to come over.

70
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:34,997
She is a trained caregiver.

71
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:37,641
Oh, God, no. Really, it's fine...

72
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,837
Mandy's wonderful with people,

73
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:43,516
and she's a first-hand authority
on broken relationships.

74
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:47,117
She'd just love a psychological challenge
on this scale.

75
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:50,717
- Here we go.
- I don't think I need...

76
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:55,079
Here we go, Room 11, Mr Ware.

77
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:57,801
Here. This'll help you sleep.

78
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:01,641
- I don't take prescription...
- You do now.

79
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:07,563
Swallow.

80
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:11,680
Now, you OK to get yourself to bed?

81
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:18,923
I'll speak to Fisher about your suggestion
and we'll see you later, OK?

82
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:22,840
On some kind of personal tour, then?

83
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:25,197
To draw faces?

84
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,837
Will you do something for me?

85
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:42,403
I don't want you to talk,
I just... I want you to think.

86
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:46,315
I want you to think of
the most peaceful place you've ever been.

87
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:49,086
If you're willing to do that, then just nod.

88
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:50,765
You're the caregiver.

89
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:54,482
I want you to make it a place
that's so beautiful and so peaceful

90
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:57,838
that one day you'd like to go back there
and stay a long time.

91
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:03,166
- If you really think...
- I don't want you to talk. Just nod.

92
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:08,884
I want you to make it a place
that's beyond time and space itself.

93
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:15,001
Are you doing that?

94
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:19,117
You're not doing that? Why not?

95
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:23,565
Why not?

96
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:26,481
- You can talk to tell me that.
- Oh, sorry.

97
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:29,758
Sorry, what does that mean,
"beyond time and space"?

98
00:10:29,887 --> 00:10:33,197
- You don't know what that means?
- No. It's a concept of which...

99
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:38,959
Don't worry about the concept.
Just think of a beautiful, peaceful place.

100
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:41,555
Do you wanna tell me what it is?

101
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:44,124
It's a beach.

102
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:47,876
- What kind of beach?
- Sort of a sandy one.

103
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:51,116
Where is this sandy beach?

104
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,484
- The Canaries.
- The what?

105
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:59,919
The Canary Islands.
Vera and I got a cheap deal.

106
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:04,279
Vera being the person
that you came here to forget?

107
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:07,365
Maybe it's better not to choose
a place you went with her.

108
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:12,436
Try thinking of the most peaceful place
that you've ever been without Vera.

109
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,797
Everywhere I've been, I've been with Vera.

110
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:19,000
There must be somewhere
where Vera wasn't with you.

111
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:24,876
- Do you wanna tell me where it is?
- A room.

112
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,366
And are you at peace in this room?

113
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:32,839
Is it a quiet, tranquil room?

114
00:11:35,687 --> 00:11:38,759
Do you wanna stay there
for ever and ever?

115
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,720
And there's no Vera?

116
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:46,478
Colin, there's no Vera?

117
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:52,123
Sorry.

118
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:54,363
Listen, you've really helped,

119
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:58,366
but I think this is about as peaceful
as I'm going to get for now.

120
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:00,682
OK. I'll go.

121
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:07,042
But can I just ask you a question?

122
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:12,484
Most people,
when they go through a break-up,

123
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:16,646
they go through a state of shock and they
get depressed and they wanna be alone.

124
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,919
I know I did. But they don't usually
fly to the other side of the world.

125
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:26,280
- You and Vera must've been really close.
- I was on her mailing list.

126
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:35,124
"Mr and Mrs Keith Edwards
request the pleasure of your company

127
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:40,401
at the marriage of their daughter
Vera Samantha to Mr Roger Pelham."

128
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:42,799
You know this Roger Pelham?

129
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:45,680
First I've heard of him,
marrying my fiancée.

130
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,957
Vera was your fiancée?

131
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:51,045
I can see why you'd wanna leave London,
but why come here?

132
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:53,601
- It's none of my business...
- No, not at all.

133
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:56,446
A person has a right to know
why someone's in their town.

134
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,003
- They seem to here, anyway.
- No, no, I should go.

135
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:03,641
It was the name, really.

136
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:09,399
Maybe I got you wrong.

137
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:14,362
Maybe, instead of an emotional voyage,
what you need is a bodily one.

138
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:17,763
Maybe, instead of asking you
to imagine a beautiful place,

139
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:20,720
I should take you there physically.

140
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:23,042
Have you heard of our Spring Gardens?

141
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:28,036
I'm free now and I can take you.
My car's outside. But only if you want to.

142
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:33,446
That's very kind, but I think
I'm meeting up with Mr Fisher shortly.

143
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:39,719
You know, it's the guys that don't think
they need help that need help the most.

144
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:41,485
You put me in that category?

145
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:44,963
A guy who flew to another country
just to cry in a motel room

146
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,238
in a town that he only chose
cos it's called Hope...

147
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:51,882
Yeah, I put you in that category.

148
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:58,163
- What about tomorrow?
- Cool.

149
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:00,281
Cool.

150
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,363
- Pick me up at about ten?
- Sure.

151
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:05,126
- Splendid.
- Splendid.

152
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,677
How do I look?

153
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:21,920
You have a naturally dramatic face,
Mr Fisher.

154
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:27,075
And hopefully, if this works out, I'll be able
to emphasise that quality even more.

155
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:29,163
Dramatic, eh?

156
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:34,845
Now, is that a position
that you can hold for 30 minutes or so?

157
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:36,685
I can do that.

158
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:42,404
If you'd like to put your hands on your lap,
once you've finished your...

159
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:46,805
- Are we allowed to talk?
- Yup, we can talk. Calmly.

160
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:51,478
Mandy told Joanie, who told Tina, who
told me, what happened in your homeland.

161
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:54,644
- Sorry, could you tip your head...?
- Sorry.

162
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:56,917
Maybe not quite that much.

163
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:04,086
If you just keep your eyes on a fixed point,
sometimes that way your head stays still.

164
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:08,246
Listen, my friend,
once the pain wears off, I'm tellin' ya,

165
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,996
you'll be a better and stronger man
than if it never happened at all.

166
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,197
- If it ever does wear off.
- Sure it does.

167
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,761
That's the one good thing about pain,
it wears off.

168
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:19,879
You know, I was having a think earlier.

169
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,882
About six months ago, she took up yoga.

170
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,601
She joined a local club,
and it made her happy.

171
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,719
I remember thinking
"How can yoga make anyone that happy?"

172
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:34,317
And especially so when the swami
started one-partner exercises.

173
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:36,722
- Swami?
- Yes, the swami.

174
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:40,999
He'd pair them off and they'd all sit on
the floor, back-to-back with locked arms,

175
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:44,244
and they'd pull against each other
and chant things.

176
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,119
Chanting? Oh, boy.

177
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:52,117
And I was just thinking maybe that was it.
They were all paired off,

178
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:55,523
and that was the moment,
when maybe I lost her.

179
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:02,598
Cos maybe the guy that she was
paired off with was this Roger Pelham.

180
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:08,677
- Colin, would you like a cup of tea?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

181
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:09,762
Fisher?

182
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,526
I can't turn my head.
I'll have to talk to you later.

183
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:16,606
Should that shadow be coming down
over Fisher's mouth like that?

184
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,479
It's dramatic, Joanie.

185
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:21,963
Fisher has such fine lips.
I hope they'll show.

186
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:26,638
They'll be shown to full effect, Mrs Fisher.
Just as soon as we lose that mayonnaise.

187
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:29,406
I think it's OK to call me Joanie now.

188
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:31,643
Joanie, let the man work.

189
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:38,516
So, Roger Pelham?

190
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:41,957
I was just thinking
of all those times when I picked her up

191
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:47,798
and I'd sit in the car waiting for her to come
out of the club, watching them come out...

192
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:51,806
Just trying to remember
what they all looked like, because...

193
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:56,083
Well, one of the men I used to see
would've been...

194
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:59,358
Did they have
a kind of glazed expression?

195
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:05,239
Could they be described as "transfixed"?

196
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:12,680
See, from what you're sayin' - delirium
and swamis, chants, glazed expressions -

197
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:18,677
I hate to say it, my friend, but I think
you have lost your good woman to a cult.

198
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:23,845
Colin?

199
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:27,522
Joanie!

200
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:35,563
Colin, all you have any business
thinkin' about at this point is movin' on.

201
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,599
Maybe folks in England
sit around chewin' on the past,

202
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:41,639
but over here that ain't done much.

203
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:46,281
Before you get out,
can I just say something?

204
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,278
Of course.

205
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:52,605
Excuse me, I just need a little...

206
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:06,163
- Do you want some?
- Not this morning, thanks.

207
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:09,324
You're gonna have to drive us back.
You can drive, right?

208
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:11,677
On the left I can, but I'm not very...

209
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:15,038
Over at the Shining Shores
I really feel I'm helping people.

210
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:17,203
A lot of people never get that feeling...

211
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:21,206
- Shining Shores?
- The rest home where I work. And live.

212
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:35,080
God, when I was in high school,
the things we used to do in there.

213
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,402
Non-botanical things?

214
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:41,236
Non-botanical things!
What-ho, Jeeves!

215
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:45,838
I'm just wondering if this is the best time
for us to be trying to take this in.

216
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:08,039
You know, if I was back in high school,
I'da just thrown this out in the street!

217
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:13,002
I wouldn'ta cared. Somebody walking
over broken glass - like, who gives a shit?

218
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:18,121
But I'm not like that now. Now
I'm responsible and mature and boring.

219
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm sorry. It's you that's supposed
to be getting the therapy from this.

220
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:31,359
Listen, Mandy,
I think if I drive very, very slowly

221
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:35,002
we stand a small chance
of getting back to the motel alive.

222
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:40,965
- I'm really sorry about this.
- That's OK.

223
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,078
I was just nervous.

224
00:20:44,287 --> 00:20:47,120
- Are we going back to your room?
- Sorry?

225
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,557
- I mean I need some coffee.
- Right, yes. Of course.

226
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:53,360
We are, like, hardly moving here.

227
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:57,045
I think you'll find we're moving.

228
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:06,278
No, no, Mandy, don't...

229
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:16,317
No, stop... No, no, don't... Seriously...

230
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:41,202
Did you do these?
It's Fisher. That's incredible.

231
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:43,602
- He looks almost...
- Lifelike?

232
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:46,082
Handsome.

233
00:21:46,207 --> 00:21:49,802
And she's beautiful. Who is that?

234
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:52,357
Sorry.

235
00:21:53,327 --> 00:21:56,285
I decided I'm going to
put together an exhibition.

236
00:21:56,447 --> 00:22:00,440
Portraits of people in this town.
Might take my mind off things.

237
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:04,606
I know every face in town,
so if you need a face-finder, I'm your man.

238
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:09,676
I'm sure you've got better things to do
than to go around looking for faces for me.

239
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:13,916
- Anyway, coffee.
- Are you happy, Colin?

240
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:16,720
- Generally speaking, yes.
- Why are you happy?

241
00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:20,840
Probably because we're not
being scraped off the front of a truck.

242
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:25,037
No coffee for me, thanks.
Can I ask you a question?

243
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:30,877
Cos you seem like you wouldn't
get mad at me, no matter what I said or did.

244
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:33,646
- You wouldn't, would you?
- It depends.

245
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:37,237
I'm gonna do something
I've never done before in my whole life.

246
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:40,165
I'm gonna close the curtains.

247
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:46,684
- You've never unbuttoned your blouse?
- Not for this reason.

248
00:22:46,807 --> 00:22:51,164
I've taken off my clothes for other reasons,
obviously, but not for this one.

249
00:22:52,127 --> 00:22:54,402
This one being what, exactly?

250
00:22:54,527 --> 00:22:57,200
When I was little,
whenever I got really happy

251
00:22:57,327 --> 00:23:00,239
I got this uncontrollable desire
to take off my clothes.

252
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:03,120
And when I was little
I was happy a lot, obviously,

253
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:05,636
so I'd just take 'em off any old where,

254
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:09,157
and people would be shocked
and I'd get in trouble...

255
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:12,484
It's funny, but with you
I don't even feel self-conscious.

256
00:23:12,607 --> 00:23:14,518
Well, that's good, I think.

257
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:20,756
This is the first time I've ever stripped for
joyfulness with someone else in the room.

258
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:22,605
And it's wonderful!

259
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:25,924
Cos when you take off
your clothes in private,

260
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:28,402
you might be expressing your joy,

261
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:32,406
but you always knew
you had to go off by yourself to do it.

262
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:35,837
So the joy's never quite complete.

263
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:39,645
- Incomplete joy.
- Try it yourself if you want.

264
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:44,124
It feels wonderful. It has nothing
to do with sex, if that's what you're thinking.

265
00:23:44,247 --> 00:23:45,965
No, I wasn't.

266
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:50,285
Most men would think it did,
but I can tell you accept it for what it is.

267
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:54,036
That's why I feel comfortable enough
to do it with you.

268
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:57,239
Go on. It feels wonderful.

269
00:23:57,367 --> 00:24:01,326
- I might just take some of them off.
- Not some of them. All of them.

270
00:24:01,447 --> 00:24:06,396
- I'm just not quite as joyful as you are yet.
- You will be once they're off.

271
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:12,526
I bet you've had sex
with your clothes on.

272
00:24:12,647 --> 00:24:14,717
If I have, it was a long time ago.

273
00:24:14,847 --> 00:24:17,805
See? People with their clothes off
aren't gonna have sex

274
00:24:17,927 --> 00:24:21,840
any more than people with their clothes on
would not have sex.

275
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:25,403
I think people with their clothes off
probably have it more often.

276
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:28,644
That might be true, but that's not the point.

277
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:33,045
Although it kinda does seem like we might.
Does it seem that way to you?

278
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,920
I feel like it could go either way.

279
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:41,682
If it does go that way,
maybe we should put our clothes back on.

280
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:43,445
Back on? To have sex?

281
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:48,846
Because that way we wouldn't risk spoiling
the feeling of joy - the innocent kind of joy.

282
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:51,686
Why take the chance of spoiling that?

283
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:55,322
Would we take them back off again
afterwards?

284
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:56,357
What?

285
00:24:56,487 --> 00:25:00,366
I'm just asking if, after we had sex -
if that's the way it went -

286
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:04,002
would we take our clothes back off
afterwards?

287
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,278
- Don't you wear underwear?
- I left home in a hurry.

288
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:10,046
I'm starting to feel kinda cold.

289
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:15,002
I guess Joanie and Fisher
are trying to save on the heating.

290
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:23,479
- What are you doing?
- I have no idea.

291
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:27,520
I think I'm stuck between
the innocent joy and the other kind.

292
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:30,241
It's a very strange sensation.

293
00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:32,557
Come in the bed, Colin.

294
00:25:35,287 --> 00:25:37,881
Yes, OK. Maybe that would help.

295
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:49,955
We're definitely moving towards
the non-innocent kind now, aren't we?

296
00:25:50,087 --> 00:25:54,842
That's the thing about the innocent kind -
you never know when it'll come or go.

297
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,003
Like right now it's totally gone.

298
00:25:57,127 --> 00:26:00,244
Shouldn't I be keeping my shirt on?

299
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:05,236
I think you're making all this much more
complicated than it needs to be.

300
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:11,326
Actually, it's all just clicked into place.

301
00:26:11,447 --> 00:26:16,919
- We don't have to talk about it any more?
- No. The concept's become crystal clear.

302
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:30,763
Sorry.

303
00:26:30,887 --> 00:26:34,562
I think there's one part of me
that still finds this a bit complicated.

304
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:37,599
It's probably just the first-date thing.

305
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:42,676
- You don't have sex on first dates?
- I don't have first dates.

306
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:06,801
King of the world!

307
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:12,478
Non-innocent kind.

308
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:04,284
Look, Johnny, my dear old dad wears
his tie tucked into his pants all the time.

309
00:31:04,407 --> 00:31:07,001
Is that Colin Ware, renowned British artist?

310
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:10,045
Come on in, Colin.
Webster, this is Colin. Show him.

311
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:13,000
Don't say anything,
let him form his own opinion.

312
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:15,883
Come on, be brave.

313
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,796
Tell us what you think, Colin.

314
00:31:24,047 --> 00:31:27,960
- It's the cannon, right?
- I don't know, you tell us. You tell us.

315
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:30,317
Looks just fine to you, does it?

316
00:31:30,447 --> 00:31:34,440
It's maybe just a little more
flesh-coloured than the original.

317
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:36,364
We can fix the colour.

318
00:31:36,487 --> 00:31:39,160
He's English. He's too polite to say it.

319
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:43,405
- Look at it, Colin. What does it look like?
- Doug, no one wears a tie tucked in.

320
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:48,999
Look, Mr Ware, in your opinion does the
cannon on this tie in any way resemble a...

321
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:52,199
- What do they call them over there?
- Gee, I don't know.

322
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:55,683
- A penis?
- A penis. A big, huge penis. Thank you.

323
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:58,480
Thank you. Jury's spoken.
Take a chair, Ware.

324
00:31:58,607 --> 00:32:02,043
Now go back and have your people
come up with another concept,

325
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:04,806
not a goddamn Viagra commercial.

326
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:09,124
God, it is hell being a visionary.

327
00:32:10,927 --> 00:32:16,285
Ware, have you been able
to try any of our spring water?

328
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:20,878
Now, this spring water comes from deeper
in the earth than your other spring water,

329
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:23,475
so it's older water.

330
00:32:26,207 --> 00:32:29,165
Now, you might not think
you want older water...

331
00:32:29,287 --> 00:32:33,917
- Sounds like maybe I do.
- Oh, yes. Old is good, Colin. Old is good.

332
00:32:34,047 --> 00:32:35,844
So says my mineralogy expert,

333
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:40,438
and I do not keep Rock-man Ray
on the payroll just to yank my chain.

334
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:42,125
Good, don't you think?

335
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:45,444
It's a very nice fresh taste.
A very nice old fresh taste.

336
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:49,116
You can taste the old, can't you?
Statewide marketing begins next month.

337
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:54,082
We wanted to call it H2Ope, but we're
having a hard time g etting it cleared.

338
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:59,918
Hope Springs Eternal is the working title
right now. Pretty good, don't you think?

339
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:03,119
So, you have come all the way over here
from the land of 007

340
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:08,241
to draw some pictures of our local people?
For some exhibition? You got a name yet?

341
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:10,642
- Sorry?
- A name for the show.

342
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:15,758
Images of Hope:
Birthplace of American Art.

343
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:19,806
Now that's got a nice ring to it.

344
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:21,076
Yeah.

345
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,880
But how is Hope
the birthplace of American art?

346
00:33:24,007 --> 00:33:26,521
I'm just trying to help. Don't be that way.

347
00:33:26,647 --> 00:33:29,286
So, am I good sitting right here,
au naturel?

348
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,557
- Yeah, you're fine.
- Right about there?

349
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:33,086
Yeah.

350
00:33:33,207 --> 00:33:36,836
How about there? Right about there.
Is that good, right there?

351
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:39,197
- That's fine.
- How's that?

352
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:42,162
With the hands up here?

353
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:46,364
No, too stuffy. Too stuffy.
Just like this. Here we go.

354
00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:48,637
Hands down here?

355
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,085
Hands there.

356
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:53,118
This is fun.

357
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:57,404
- You just use pencils?
- Charcoal, yeah.

358
00:33:57,527 --> 00:34:02,681
That's right, you do all the colouring-in
at a later juncture. I moved. Sorry.

359
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:06,163
- No, I don't paint.
- You don't paint?

360
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:10,876
Young Miss Morton led me to believe
I was sitting for a portrait.

361
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,124
- You are.
- A pencil portrait?

362
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,236
Could you stop, please, Mr Ware?
Thank you.

363
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:19,483
Look, Colin...

364
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:24,756
Every day for three years
I've had to stare at that monstrosity.

365
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:29,597
"You can't take down a painting of the most
important man in Hope's history", they say.

366
00:34:29,727 --> 00:34:34,164
I say the most important man in our history
is sitting right here, staring up at that jerk.

367
00:34:34,287 --> 00:34:37,324
- Who is that?
- Some Welsh dick.

368
00:34:37,887 --> 00:34:41,641
- Welsh?
- Yeah. The guy who founded this place.

369
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:44,122
Somebody Edwards.

370
00:34:46,087 --> 00:34:47,918
Doug Reed.

371
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:50,515
Yeah, look, Brad, this is all I'm saying:

372
00:34:50,647 --> 00:34:54,560
It's the Cannon Ball next week
and we have no goddamn merchandise.

373
00:34:54,687 --> 00:35:00,045
Anything. Key-chain replicas, cannon
toothbrush holders for kiddies... Come on!

374
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:03,477
Hey, how about cannon-styled
musical toilet seats

375
00:35:03,607 --> 00:35:06,917
that play "Bridge Over Troubled Water"
when you take a dump?

376
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:09,800
Figure it out, Brad! Get to work!

377
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:16,962
This journal...

378
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:21,196
- What?
- Of 1741.

379
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,318
Yeah? What about it?

380
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:30,046
It's this paper... You can tell
by the grain that's it's contemporary.

381
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:33,281
I mean, it's a fake.

382
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:39,277
It's quite a good fake actually, but it just
seems to have been done on some...

383
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:42,763
- Computer program?
- Yup, maybe. Or possibly some sort of...

384
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:44,764
Computer program?

385
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:48,204
My computer program?

386
00:35:48,327 --> 00:35:53,117
- You can produce fake documents?
- Naughty mayor. Naughty, naughty mayor.

387
00:35:56,167 --> 00:36:00,558
So listen, Picasso, are you gonna
do me a grown-up painting or not?

388
00:36:00,687 --> 00:36:03,997
Because if you could,
I'm telling you, friend,

389
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:08,518
I'll give you the freedom of the town, the
key to the city, you name your pleasure.

390
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:13,926
I cannot tell you what it would mean to me
to have a proper portrait up there

391
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:19,838
of Doug Reed, the man who gave us Hope,
instead of that asshole.

392
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:41,806
Hello. I'm looking for a friend of mine.
Name of Ware.

393
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:45,876
- Ware?
- Ware.

394
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:49,720
- Ware, you say?
- Yes. Colin Ware.

395
00:36:49,847 --> 00:36:55,877
Let me just look and see
if we have anyone here by that name

396
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:59,920
at the inn or not.

397
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:04,679
Ware... Ware...

398
00:37:05,247 --> 00:37:07,317
Ware...

399
00:37:07,847 --> 00:37:09,678
Ware...

400
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:13,279
Room 11. The English guy's in Room 11.

401
00:37:13,407 --> 00:37:16,683
- Room 11. Thanks.
- He went out.

402
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:19,879
- Sorry?
- He went out early this morning.

403
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:22,282
I thought you didn't know who he was.

404
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,001
I remember him now - the artist fella, right?

405
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:30,281
No, he went out at the crack of dawn
with all his artist-fella things.

406
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:33,319
He's back.
He wouldn't let me in his room to clean.

407
00:37:33,447 --> 00:37:36,962
Oh, right.
Thank you again for that, Tina.

408
00:37:38,087 --> 00:37:40,442
You must sign the visitors' book.

409
00:37:40,567 --> 00:37:44,480
- Sorry?
- All guests must sign the visitors' book.

410
00:37:50,047 --> 00:37:52,766
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

411
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:55,196
The visitors' book.

412
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,724
Tina, what did you do
with the visitors' book?

413
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:02,998
We got a visitors' book?

414
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:06,722
What the hell. Shall we just forget
the formalities on this occasion?

415
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:07,996
Let's.

416
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:47,086
Colin, I know I don't exactly deserve
the red-carpet treatment,

417
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:51,041
but after 5,000 miles
and 20 hotel reception desks,

418
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:54,079
I do think that the least you could do
is invite me in,

419
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:59,759
away from the stares
of the very eccentric management here.

420
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:07,276
- How did you know I was here, Vera?
- I spoke to Jeremy at the gallery.

421
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:10,956
He told me how excited he was
about this exhibition he's planning

422
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:14,762
of drawings that you've been doing
in America in a place called Hope.

423
00:39:14,887 --> 00:39:18,084
Wow. I can see he has every reason to be.

424
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:25,806
Aren't you on your honeymoon?

425
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:30,641
This isn't going to be smooth, Colin.

426
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:33,235
It's no use pretending
that anything we say

427
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:37,280
will make this anything other than
the most awkward moment we've ever had.

428
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:39,682
No ashtrays. What a surprise.

429
00:39:39,807 --> 00:39:45,279
I think we should do what you always say:
Rise above our emotions with maturity.

430
00:39:47,727 --> 00:39:49,957
Good fucking wedding, was it?

431
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:54,478
I have nothing to say in my defence.
I did a terrible thing. A terrible thing.

432
00:39:54,607 --> 00:39:56,359
This is a no-smoking room.

433
00:39:56,487 --> 00:40:02,198
I come halfway across the world to explain
and you won't let me have a cigarette?

434
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:04,363
Explain?

435
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:08,436
There's no Roger Pelham.

436
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,716
There is no Roger Pelham.

437
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:14,836
Oh, God.

438
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:18,676
I was just so sick of dropping hints
and you failing to spot them.

439
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:19,796
Oh, God, no...

440
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:25,763
We have been engaged for ever. I wanted
to jolt you into action. I made a mistake.

441
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:31,405
- The invitation was a joke?
- No, not a joke. It was just a bigger hint.

442
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:35,404
The last few weeks
have been a nightmare, Colin.

443
00:40:35,527 --> 00:40:38,121
I have been at my wits' end
since you disappeared.

444
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:41,876
Day after day without a word -
I literally went to pieces.

445
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:44,441
I was calling everyone, all day, all night.

446
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,799
When Jeremy finally told me
you were all right, I can't tell you the relief.

447
00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:52,283
- I just wept solidly for ten minutes.
- Ten? I'm touched.

448
00:40:52,407 --> 00:40:55,444
All that held me together
was knowing, when this was over,

449
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:58,559
you and I would have
a really good laugh about it.

450
00:40:58,687 --> 00:41:00,837
- Vera...
- The thing is, Col...

451
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:03,276
Please, just go. Go. Please.

452
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:08,242
But I can't tell you how much...
You're not wearing any underpants.

453
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:11,916
I was a tad preoccupied
when I was leaving the flat.

454
00:41:12,047 --> 00:41:16,199
Are you going for a walk? I know how you
like to go for a walk when you want to think.

455
00:41:16,327 --> 00:41:21,481
- The last thing I want to do now is think.
- If you have to go out, I'll just wait.

456
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:23,359
Vera, don't wait.

457
00:41:28,847 --> 00:41:30,724
Colin?

458
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:33,325
Colin?

459
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:35,246
- Colin?
- What?

460
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,403
What's this?

461
00:41:38,687 --> 00:41:42,282
That's a machine for drying hair, Vera.
It's called a hair dryer.

462
00:41:42,407 --> 00:41:44,841
I know what it is, Colin,
but you don't use one.

463
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:49,199
Is this supplied by the motel?
Is there one like this in every room? Colin?

464
00:41:49,327 --> 00:41:54,606
- Can't you answer a simple question?
- A simple one I could. Just not that one.

465
00:41:57,647 --> 00:42:01,196
What? It was a joke
and she's not married and she's here?

466
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:05,525
It hasn't affected our relationship
in any way. She just came to apologise.

467
00:42:05,647 --> 00:42:10,926
- She's going straight back home again.
- Is she allergic to the telephone?

468
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:17,159
Sorry, do you not want
sleeping people in your exhibition?

469
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:22,122
- He is just asleep, isn't he?
- Like I'd get you to draw a dead person.

470
00:42:22,247 --> 00:42:27,321
So, are you just gonna forgive her?
How could you forgive something like that?

471
00:42:27,447 --> 00:42:30,962
It's the only way. Forgive and forget.

472
00:42:31,527 --> 00:42:34,439
And do your forgiving while you can,

473
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:41,757
cos when you get to my age
all you can do is the...

474
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:47,246
- The forgetting?
- Yeah, that's it. The forgetting.

475
00:42:49,607 --> 00:42:51,996
"My darling Vera..."

476
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:55,243
"Darling"?

477
00:42:56,727 --> 00:42:58,683
"Dear Vera."

478
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:04,362
"Vera."

479
00:43:04,487 --> 00:43:08,958
"I know that the cruel joke you played on
me was wholly out of character,

480
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:13,080
and although
it hurt me beyond description,

481
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:16,836
I write now, firstly, to thank you
for coming all this way to apologise,

482
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:19,959
but, more importantly, to tell you..."

483
00:43:20,087 --> 00:43:23,716
To haul your bony ass
all the way back again.

484
00:43:24,807 --> 00:43:28,880
"More importantly,
to tell you that I forgive you for it 100%."

485
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:31,202
"As a result of your actions, though,

486
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:35,445
both our lives
have now taken on a new direction."

487
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:39,399
Resuming our physical relationship
would, I believe,

488
00:43:39,527 --> 00:43:43,566
cheapen the plateau of mutual affection
that has been born out of this crisis.

489
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:46,076
Your journey here
was much appreciated,

490
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,722
but too much damage has been done
for our romance to survive.

491
00:43:49,847 --> 00:43:53,078
- We wish you a pleasant return flight.
- "We..."

492
00:43:53,207 --> 00:43:56,677
Goodbye, Vera. Your friend, Colin.

493
00:44:24,807 --> 00:44:27,275
What is it?

494
00:44:27,407 --> 00:44:30,604
I don't know.

495
00:44:30,727 --> 00:44:34,481
Just never seems to work out
when I fall in love.

496
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,965
When you fall in what?

497
00:44:46,527 --> 00:44:48,961
What time do you have to be at work?

498
00:44:49,087 --> 00:44:51,043
Soon.

499
00:44:53,087 --> 00:44:55,157
But not that soon.

500
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:07,043
Are you looking forward to that?
You can get all dressed up.

501
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:10,762
It's not as much fun getting dressed up
when you can't do it yourself.

502
00:45:10,887 --> 00:45:14,004
You're gonna look better
than the Queen of Hope herself.

503
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:16,516
- Ready?
- Yes.

504
00:45:18,687 --> 00:45:22,362
Before we start,
I don't know if Mandy mentioned,

505
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:25,081
but I'm pretty heavily into the Lord,

506
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:30,116
and I was just wondering if you could just
sort of convey a sort of a...

507
00:45:30,247 --> 00:45:32,602
a feeling of inner happiness.

508
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:35,605
Something like that, like an inner light.

509
00:45:35,727 --> 00:45:40,084
There's two things I want to come through
in the picture. One, that I'm a swimmer.

510
00:45:40,207 --> 00:45:42,516
But two, that I'm also a Christian.

511
00:45:42,647 --> 00:45:45,878
You're sure you'll be all right
just standing there, yeah?

512
00:45:46,007 --> 00:45:50,558
Like I say, sir,
God blessed me with fabulous circulation.

513
00:45:50,687 --> 00:45:53,155
- Are my goggles straight?
- They're perfect.

514
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:55,562
And, Rob, please, don't call me "sir".

515
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:59,682
Mandy told me what your fiancée
over there in England did to you.

516
00:45:59,807 --> 00:46:02,241
- She's in town, right?
- No, she's gone home now.

517
00:46:02,367 --> 00:46:04,198
Satan's amazing, isn't he?

518
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:10,482
I mean, one minute you're leadin'
this ordinary life, everything's normal.

519
00:46:10,607 --> 00:46:14,122
Then vroom! Satan just creeps up
behind you and sucks you into a cult.

520
00:46:14,247 --> 00:46:16,203
Rob, I'm just doing your mouth now,

521
00:46:16,327 --> 00:46:20,878
so would you mind just...
keeping it closed for a minute?

522
00:46:30,727 --> 00:46:32,479
Oh, God!

523
00:46:34,807 --> 00:46:36,763
Come on, granny.

524
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:51,157
How could anyone do that?

525
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:53,881
- What?
- You're Vera, right?

526
00:46:54,007 --> 00:46:56,601
How could anyone
do something that mean?

527
00:46:56,727 --> 00:46:58,957
- And you are...?
- Mandy.

528
00:47:02,127 --> 00:47:06,678
The mean thing I did. I assume you're
referring to the game I played on Colin.

529
00:47:06,807 --> 00:47:07,956
- Yeah.
- Good.

530
00:47:08,087 --> 00:47:11,966
Now we've established
your name and what you're talking about,

531
00:47:12,087 --> 00:47:15,796
could we also establish
whether you have a red hair dryer?

532
00:47:15,927 --> 00:47:18,441
A cheap, plastic, red hair dryer.
Do you have one?

533
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:20,319
- Yes, she does.
- Thank you.

534
00:47:22,327 --> 00:47:25,285
- Do you smoke, Mandy?
- No. Not since high school.

535
00:47:25,407 --> 00:47:27,523
How very healthy.

536
00:47:27,647 --> 00:47:30,241
Did you go to school here?
Hope High or something?

537
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:32,198
- Hope Regional.
- Regional.

538
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:35,876
It's over there.
You can't see it from here.

539
00:47:44,567 --> 00:47:46,797
You seem like a nice person.

540
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:49,236
- Not really.
- She's an angel!

541
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,722
Colin wouldn't be
with anyone who wasn't nice.

542
00:47:51,847 --> 00:47:56,284
- I'm sure you're very nice too.
- Yes, I'm sure we're all delightful people.

543
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:58,363
I do feel at a slight disadvantage,

544
00:47:58,487 --> 00:48:02,526
knowing only the way to your old school
and the colour of your hair dryer,

545
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:05,366
whilst presumably
you know rather more about me.

546
00:48:05,487 --> 00:48:08,524
- Colin must have talked about me.
- We talk about other things.

547
00:48:08,647 --> 00:48:11,684
- Like what?
- Normal things that people talk about.

548
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:15,197
- Like the weather?
- We've talked about the weather.

549
00:48:15,327 --> 00:48:18,683
What sort of day it is?
Whether it's warm or cold?

550
00:48:18,807 --> 00:48:20,525
Yeah, or windy.

551
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,046
- Or raining.
- Or snowing.

552
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:23,725
- Has it snowed?
- Not yet.

553
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:27,556
Oh, I see. You were just rehearsing
for a future conversation.

554
00:48:27,687 --> 00:48:30,918
- Aren't you holding up traffic?
- Is this where you work?

555
00:48:31,047 --> 00:48:34,437
- "Whining Whores".
- Shining Shores.

556
00:48:34,567 --> 00:48:36,125
Right.

557
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:40,035
Come on, Mandy. He must have said
something about his life back in England.

558
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:44,319
- Barely anything.
- Then you don't know about...

559
00:48:44,447 --> 00:48:47,280
- About what?
- The operation.

560
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:49,523
What operation?

561
00:48:49,647 --> 00:48:52,684
Has Colin not mentioned his father?

562
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:56,880
Presumably Colin hasn't told you
because he is blocking it out.

563
00:48:57,007 --> 00:49:02,240
That's why he's staying up here. He's living
in a sort of dream world, drawing away.

564
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:04,881
Beautiful scenery. Beautiful company.

565
00:49:05,007 --> 00:49:07,680
Meanwhile, back on Planet England,

566
00:49:07,807 --> 00:49:10,446
doctors and hospitals and constant worry,

567
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:13,365
and a very, very sick father.

568
00:49:15,047 --> 00:49:16,799
It's why I'm still here.

569
00:49:16,927 --> 00:49:21,239
Someone has to bring him back
to his senses, back to his responsibilities,

570
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:23,517
back home.

571
00:49:24,287 --> 00:49:28,883
The truth is, the longer he stays,
hiding away from it all,

572
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:32,522
the less likely he is
to ever see his dad again.

573
00:49:34,807 --> 00:49:38,720
You're very nice, I'm sure,
but you're not exactly helping.

574
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:43,286
I'm sorry if that came out...

575
00:49:44,807 --> 00:49:48,322
You couldn't do me a favour, could you?
Just a little one.

576
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:54,044
I don't want you to feel like an errand girl,
so please say if you'd rather not, but...

577
00:49:55,007 --> 00:50:00,445
I was going to drop these off myself, but as
you're probably going over there anyway...

578
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:03,035
You sure you don't mind?

579
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:06,716
It's just the other morning
I noticed he didn't put any on.

580
00:50:06,847 --> 00:50:08,917
It'd be great if you'd give them to him.

581
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,003
I'll see you, Mandy.

582
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:27,720
Hello?

583
00:50:27,847 --> 00:50:29,803
Hi. It's me.

584
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:36,043
- It's Colin.
- What do you want?

585
00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:38,803
You asked me over.

586
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,880
Are you gonna come in
or are you just gonna stand there?

587
00:50:50,007 --> 00:50:53,602
It's my apartment.
I can stand where I want in my apartment.

588
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:59,202
I've never seen one of these.
May I sit in it?

589
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:03,206
- If you have to.
- I suppose the idea is you just

590
00:51:03,327 --> 00:51:05,636
sort of lower yourself?

591
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:09,282
Don't be an idiot, Colin.
I'm sure you've sat in one of those before.

592
00:51:09,407 --> 00:51:11,637
I've done many disreputable things,

593
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:15,476
but lying about sitting in butterfly chairs
is lower than even I would go.

594
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:19,602
Though this is probably
the lowest I've been.

595
00:51:19,727 --> 00:51:21,683
These are for you.

596
00:51:22,567 --> 00:51:27,118
- That's very nice of you. Thank you.
- Don't thank me. Thank Vera.

597
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:31,081
- You bumped into Vera?
- Yesterday.

598
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:34,762
She said you needed those cos she said
she saw you without them.

599
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:37,720
No, that was when she arrived.
I'd been in the shower.

600
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:41,476
Colin, you've been cheating on me.
And worse, you've been using me.

601
00:51:41,607 --> 00:51:43,165
What has she told you?

602
00:51:43,287 --> 00:51:46,040
- I thought we had something special.
- We do.

603
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:49,079
But you never mentioned
the things that matter to you.

604
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:53,564
Do you know how much that hurts me,
to realise how little I mean to you?

605
00:51:53,687 --> 00:51:59,205
It was all just a way for you to take your
mind off what was going on in England.

606
00:51:59,327 --> 00:52:04,003
- And what is going on in England?
- Your father's surgery.

607
00:52:09,567 --> 00:52:15,722
Vera told you about my father's operation?
Did she tell you what it was for?

608
00:52:15,847 --> 00:52:19,556
She couldn't bring herself
to go into much detail.

609
00:52:19,687 --> 00:52:22,360
No. That's understandable.

610
00:52:22,487 --> 00:52:24,842
- Shall I tell you?
- It's too late.

611
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:29,165
No, I want to tell you. It started last year
when my parents were moving house.

612
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:33,997
They hired a removals company
to shift most of the furniture.

613
00:52:34,127 --> 00:52:36,083
Beds, sofas, and so forth.

614
00:52:36,207 --> 00:52:40,758
Some of the smaller stuff - the odd chair,
paintings - they moved themselves.

615
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:50,444
My father was carrying this chair
up the stairs in the new house when...

616
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:54,640
- It's OK.
- It was a very heavy wooden chair and...

617
00:52:54,767 --> 00:53:00,717
- You don't have to tell me.
- No, it's all right. It helps to talk about it.

618
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:07,325
As he was going up the stairs
with this chair, he dropped it,

619
00:53:07,447 --> 00:53:10,041
and it landed on his foot.

620
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:15,241
It was all forgotten until a few weeks later
when suddenly his big toe started...

621
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:17,119
curling in.

622
00:53:17,247 --> 00:53:19,886
For months my mother tried
to get him to see somebody,

623
00:53:20,007 --> 00:53:23,079
until finally,
as a treat on her birthday, he did.

624
00:53:23,207 --> 00:53:27,120
And do you know what
the shocking diagnosis was, Mandy?

625
00:53:27,647 --> 00:53:31,196
Ingrown toenail!
Naturally we were all devastated.

626
00:53:31,327 --> 00:53:33,841
His chances of recovery are pretty good.

627
00:53:33,967 --> 00:53:39,325
It's somebody else whose chances of
survival have just plummeted to zero.

628
00:53:39,447 --> 00:53:43,122
Perhaps you can understand now
why I kept it from you for so long.

629
00:53:46,967 --> 00:53:47,717
Hello?

630
00:53:47,847 --> 00:53:50,236
- Mandy, is Colin with you?
- Yeah, he is.

631
00:53:50,367 --> 00:53:53,120
- There's a Vera Edwards on the line.
- Put her through.

632
00:53:53,247 --> 00:53:55,203
It's your friend.

633
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:07,202
- Hello, Vera. Have a good flight back?
- I need to talk to you, face to face.

634
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:10,763
- I won't be back in England until...
- No, I'm still here in Hope.

635
00:54:10,887 --> 00:54:13,003
I'm not going back
until you come with me.

636
00:54:13,127 --> 00:54:15,846
Meet me tomorrow at the golf course.
Three o'clock.

637
00:54:15,967 --> 00:54:19,243
Yeah, great. That's great.

638
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:22,757
Well, say hello to everybody back there.

639
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:26,243
What's the weather like over there?

640
00:54:26,367 --> 00:54:28,961
Good. And I'll do it... OK. Bye, then.

641
00:54:39,447 --> 00:54:42,086
So, you like butterflies, then.

642
00:54:45,087 --> 00:54:48,716
I'm not going back
until you come with me.

643
00:54:55,527 --> 00:54:58,439
Why are you still here?
And why meet on a golf course?

644
00:54:58,567 --> 00:55:01,877
Cos I can't have this conversation
without having a cigarette,

645
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:06,125
and this is apparently the only place
in the United States where I can smoke.

646
00:55:06,327 --> 00:55:10,036
- You got your knickers all right, then?
- Oh, yes. Thank you very much.

647
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:12,886
- And you got my fax?
- Yes. I was very touched.

648
00:55:13,007 --> 00:55:15,077
Just not enough to do anything about it.

649
00:55:15,207 --> 00:55:18,756
I presume your friend told you
about the chat we had the other day.

650
00:55:18,887 --> 00:55:23,483
Yes, the one about our continuing sex life
and my father's life-threatening operation.

651
00:55:24,047 --> 00:55:28,165
Vee, will you just light that cigarette
so we can get whatever this is over with?

652
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:31,120
She seems
like a very sweet person, Mandy.

653
00:55:31,847 --> 00:55:35,396
- She's so vivacious and bubbly and fun.
- So you think she's stupid.

654
00:55:35,527 --> 00:55:39,725
I can see how you might be charmed
by her childlike spiritual innocence.

655
00:55:39,847 --> 00:55:43,556
Is it Mandy with a <i>y</i>. Or Mandi with an <i>i</i>
with a little circle above it?

656
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:45,359
Let me tell you something.

657
00:55:45,487 --> 00:55:50,003
If you're going to tell me she's Mensa
material, I'll have to get more cigarettes.

658
00:55:50,127 --> 00:55:53,961
Is that her long-term career,
washing old people's bottoms?

659
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:58,160
Which is better? That, or choosing photos
for your vacuous fashion magazine?

660
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:03,802
- Can I get back to you on that one?
- I've had enough. I'm off.

661
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:05,758
Colin, wait. Don't go. Come back.

662
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:09,277
Vera, would you just tell me
what you brought me out here to say?

663
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:13,366
I love you, and I want you to
stop this nonsense and come back home.

664
00:56:13,487 --> 00:56:17,366
- What is that?
- A cigarette. Step any closer and you die.

665
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:20,285
- You can't smoke here.
- You can. My friend read the rules.

666
00:56:20,407 --> 00:56:23,479
- Fiancée.
- As long as it doesn't bother... Ex-fiancée.

667
00:56:23,607 --> 00:56:26,041
You can't have read the rule that says

668
00:56:26,167 --> 00:56:29,079
when you're on the golf course
you play golf.

669
00:56:29,207 --> 00:56:31,516
And you don't seem to be playing golf.

670
00:56:31,647 --> 00:56:33,842
- You have no clubs.
- They were dangerous.

671
00:56:33,967 --> 00:56:37,198
- The rules clearly state...
- Look! My friend and I...

672
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:40,876
- Fiancée.
- We just needed to have a private talk.

673
00:56:41,007 --> 00:56:42,998
We have some personal problems.

674
00:56:43,127 --> 00:56:46,085
Quite by chance we find ourselves
on this beautiful course

675
00:56:46,207 --> 00:56:48,641
as we try to work through
these difficult issues.

676
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:50,758
- You're right!
- Colin, calm down.

677
00:56:50,887 --> 00:56:54,197
This is not the place
to try to come to grips with private matters.

678
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:59,162
If we have impacted negatively on your
enjoyment of the third hole, I apologise!

679
00:56:59,287 --> 00:57:02,757
My hysterical ex-fiancée here
is just on her way to the airport,

680
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:06,641
so your enjoyment of the rest of the course
will be just as it should be!

681
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:08,723
- Have a pleasant flight!
- Colin!

682
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:16,004
Colin, it's just a midlife crisis!
You'll get over it!

683
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:20,640
I hope this one's
better than the last one.

684
00:57:20,767 --> 00:57:24,203
- Martha, it looked good last time.
- I'm not talking about my hair.

685
00:57:24,327 --> 00:57:27,922
- I'm talking about your boyfriend.
- What do you know about the last one?

686
00:57:28,047 --> 00:57:31,881
I could tell from the start
it wasn't gonna work.

687
00:57:32,007 --> 00:57:34,999
You approached it
in completely the wrong way.

688
00:57:35,127 --> 00:57:39,279
- You never even met him.
- I'm talking about my hair. Do keep up.

689
00:57:39,407 --> 00:57:44,083
Anyway, you never know.
This may be your last chance.

690
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:49,600
- Martha, you're not going anywhere.
- I know I'm not. But he may be.

691
00:58:08,047 --> 00:58:10,356
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

692
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,796
Thanks.

693
00:58:18,807 --> 00:58:23,039
Do you ever think about
my going back to England?

694
00:58:25,807 --> 00:58:28,446
- No.
- No?

695
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:33,922
I have a few other things
going on in my life besides you, you know.

696
00:58:34,047 --> 00:58:39,201
- I think about going back.
- You have to make a reservation and stuff.

697
00:58:40,047 --> 00:58:41,799
I don't want to go back.

698
00:58:41,927 --> 00:58:45,044
- Why not?
- Why do you think?

699
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:48,125
- You like America?
- Yes.

700
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:53,966
- That's not the reason. It's something else.
- Our delicious hamburgers?

701
00:58:54,087 --> 00:58:56,806
No, no. It's not the hamburgers.

702
00:58:56,927 --> 00:59:00,203
- Our humble, friendly ways?
- Not the humble, friendly ways.

703
00:59:00,327 --> 00:59:03,080
Why are you bringing up all this shit?
To torture me?

704
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:06,643
I'm bringing it up
because I don't want to go back alone.

705
00:59:11,767 --> 00:59:13,723
- You want someone to go with you?
- Yes.

706
00:59:13,847 --> 00:59:16,281
But only if they want to.
I wouldn't kidnap them.

707
00:59:16,407 --> 00:59:20,719
I would, but the airlines have got
rather strict on hand luggage lately.

708
00:59:20,847 --> 00:59:27,002
If force wasn't an issue and the person
wanted to come of their own free will,

709
00:59:27,127 --> 00:59:29,083
you'd want them to go with you?

710
00:59:29,207 --> 00:59:34,759
If they weren't too busy with all the many
other things in their hectic life, yes.

711
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:41,923
I'm sure, if they tried very hard, they could
find some time to fit you in their schedule.

712
00:59:42,047 --> 00:59:44,003
Oh, really?

713
00:59:56,167 --> 00:59:59,318
- What's up?
- See the woman by the pool?

714
01:00:00,607 --> 01:00:05,283
- Jesus! What does she think she's doin'?
- No, not the cigarettes, Fisher.

715
01:00:05,407 --> 01:00:08,558
That's Vera.
She's back again looking for Colin.

716
01:00:08,687 --> 01:00:11,406
It's really none of our business.

717
01:00:11,527 --> 01:00:14,644
Fisher, even you must have noticed

718
01:00:14,767 --> 01:00:19,761
that Anglo-American relations are reaching
an all-time high in room 11, right?

719
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:22,481
I heard the headboard, yes, Joanie.

720
01:00:22,567 --> 01:00:26,924
So when Mandy comes tootling back
to Colin's room with this week's groceries,

721
01:00:27,047 --> 01:00:30,005
and when there's blood in the pool,

722
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:33,676
and when there's yellow police tape
wrapped around the entire motel,

723
01:00:33,807 --> 01:00:36,401
and when we're on the front page
of the <i>Hope Herald</i>.

724
01:00:36,527 --> 01:00:40,076
Maybe then you might think
it's some of our business.

725
01:00:40,207 --> 01:00:42,198
Just go get rid of her.

726
01:00:50,727 --> 01:00:53,878
I'm afraid this is a no-smokin' area.

727
01:00:54,007 --> 01:00:56,362
What, America?

728
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:58,523
I'm Fisher, the co-manager.

729
01:00:58,647 --> 01:01:02,401
Oh, does it take more than one person
to run this place?

730
01:01:07,087 --> 01:01:11,205
So, you're here in America
on your own, then?

731
01:01:11,327 --> 01:01:13,124
- Excuse me?
- You...

732
01:01:13,247 --> 01:01:16,637
- You didn't come here with someone else?
- No, I came on my own.

733
01:01:16,767 --> 01:01:18,803
- I'll take your word for it.
- Sorry?

734
01:01:18,927 --> 01:01:20,883
- If you say so.
- Who else...?

735
01:01:21,007 --> 01:01:23,965
I don't know who else
you might have brought along.

736
01:01:24,087 --> 01:01:27,841
A certain swami, maybe?
Who knows?

737
01:01:33,847 --> 01:01:36,919
I'm afraid you're gonna have to
vacate this area.

738
01:01:37,047 --> 01:01:39,515
- We've had trouble with your kind before.
- What?

739
01:01:39,647 --> 01:01:44,596
Besides, we have a maple syrup
convention comin' at three, so...

740
01:01:44,727 --> 01:01:46,683
Immediately. Please.

741
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:54,319
Well, you can tell him
I'll keep coming around until he sees me.

742
01:01:55,967 --> 01:01:59,926
- It was nice of you to come over.
- Like I had an option.

743
01:02:00,047 --> 01:02:05,405
Vera, this has got to stop. You shouldn't be
in America and I shouldn't be in your room.

744
01:02:05,527 --> 01:02:08,883
I feel like I'm being stalked.
You'll be boiling rabbits next.

745
01:02:09,007 --> 01:02:13,159
Can we please just stop playing games,
just get back to the way we were?

746
01:02:13,287 --> 01:02:18,077
Let's get in my car and drive to New York
and jump on the first plane to London.

747
01:02:18,207 --> 01:02:20,437
- Let's just go home.
- We've become so stale.

748
01:02:20,567 --> 01:02:24,845
Being with Mandy
has taught me something.

749
01:02:24,967 --> 01:02:27,845
You learned something from Mandy?

750
01:02:27,967 --> 01:02:32,518
We haven't been like lovers for years,
you and I. More like brother and sister.

751
01:02:32,647 --> 01:02:36,606
- We're more than just a couple. We're...
- An institution. Exactly!

752
01:02:36,727 --> 01:02:41,437
Inextricably linked, like
Marks & Spencer, or bacon and eggs,

753
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:43,956
or foot-and-bloody-mouth.

754
01:02:44,087 --> 01:02:49,764
We've just been treading water for years,
and it's no good. Life's too short for that.

755
01:02:49,887 --> 01:02:53,436
And I'm not saying I never want to
see you again. I'd hate to think...

756
01:02:53,567 --> 01:02:59,597
You know that bit in your fax, about the
"plateau of mutual affection" we've found?

757
01:02:59,727 --> 01:03:01,718
Exactly. We can stay friends.

758
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:04,441
- That mustn't be cheapened.
- Precisely.

759
01:03:05,887 --> 01:03:07,639
Oh, God.

760
01:03:08,687 --> 01:03:12,236
I want to cheapen it.
I mean, really cheapen it.

761
01:03:12,367 --> 01:03:15,325
Vera, no. This is not on. It's not on.

762
01:03:15,447 --> 01:03:20,157
I promise you'll find something in your life,
like I found in mine - something exciting.

763
01:03:20,287 --> 01:03:24,724
Like Venice?
You remember Venice, Colin.

764
01:03:25,847 --> 01:03:29,635
Vee, I can't be any clearer
on where we stand.

765
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:33,476
I'm not leaving until...
No, I am leaving, very soon.

766
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:35,883
When did you buy this?

767
01:03:36,007 --> 01:03:39,079
Vera, honestly, no,
I'm totally unshakeable on this.

768
01:03:39,207 --> 01:03:42,677
I can feel your resolve stiffening.

769
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:59,001
This seems the right sort of
spectacularly memorable moment

770
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:01,721
- in which to finally say goodbye.
- Colin, don't.

771
01:04:01,847 --> 01:04:03,360
Bye, Vera.

772
01:04:03,487 --> 01:04:07,196
- I'm not going.
- No. Vera... Vera...

773
01:04:08,367 --> 01:04:10,323
Bye. Bye, Vee.

774
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,763
Hi.

775
01:04:27,967 --> 01:04:30,037
He's not here yet, the vicar?

776
01:04:31,087 --> 01:04:35,046
No, he's not here. There's no portrait.
I just wanted to talk to you.

777
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:37,123
In church?

778
01:04:37,247 --> 01:04:41,604
I figured it's the only place
we wouldn't end up having sex.

779
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:47,202
Have you talked to Vera lately?

780
01:04:47,327 --> 01:04:48,919
Vera?

781
01:04:49,047 --> 01:04:52,278
Oh, you mean since the phone call?

782
01:04:54,687 --> 01:04:57,963
Because I think I must be having a problem
with my ears and my eyes.

783
01:04:58,087 --> 01:05:00,601
- Sorry?
- When you talked to her on the phone,

784
01:05:00,727 --> 01:05:05,084
didn't you ask her
what the weather was like in London?

785
01:05:05,207 --> 01:05:08,358
- Yes.
- Good. Then my ears are OK.

786
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:11,160
But that must mean
my eye problem is really serious,

787
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:16,645
cos last night I drove past the lvy and there
were all these fire engines and people.

788
01:05:16,767 --> 01:05:20,521
And maybe it's myopia,
but I could have sworn I saw Vera there.

789
01:05:20,647 --> 01:05:23,798
But she was in England
giving you the weather report.

790
01:05:23,927 --> 01:05:29,081
I thought I saw you too. It looked like you
had your tongue down each other's throats.

791
01:05:29,207 --> 01:05:33,564
But that can't be right because,
according to you, that relationship is over

792
01:05:33,687 --> 01:05:35,996
and I'm the only one for you.

793
01:05:37,447 --> 01:05:41,235
But the bad part that makes me think
I should run to the eye doctor right away

794
01:05:41,367 --> 01:05:45,519
is that it looked to me
like she was totally butt-naked.

795
01:05:45,647 --> 01:05:47,558
- She had underwear on.
- Good.

796
01:05:47,687 --> 01:05:50,599
Then there's nothing for me
to worry about.

797
01:05:53,927 --> 01:05:57,476
I'm sorry, Mandy. I should have told you.
I just can't shake her off.

798
01:05:57,607 --> 01:06:01,759
I went there specifically to tell her
it was all over. She set the fire alarm off.

799
01:06:01,887 --> 01:06:04,276
- The sex was that good?
- No, there was no sex.

800
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:09,083
You were telling her it was over, she took
her clothes off and the fire alarm went off?

801
01:06:11,207 --> 01:06:15,883
Actually, that's pretty much
exactly how it happened, yeah.

802
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:19,640
Well, have a good trip back, Colin.

803
01:06:27,847 --> 01:06:30,441
Do you have a passport?

804
01:06:30,567 --> 01:06:32,000
No.

805
01:06:32,127 --> 01:06:36,279
- Don't you think it might come in handy?
- I don't want one, OK?

806
01:06:36,407 --> 01:06:38,557
What would make you apply for one?

807
01:06:38,687 --> 01:06:41,724
What part of "I don't want one"
don't you understand?

808
01:06:41,847 --> 01:06:44,805
- Having a passport...
- Bye, Colin.

809
01:06:46,367 --> 01:06:48,756
I love you, Mandy.

810
01:06:52,647 --> 01:06:55,480
- There is one thing.
- One thing what?

811
01:06:56,407 --> 01:07:00,082
If you promise that you'll never
come here again

812
01:07:00,207 --> 01:07:03,882
and that you'll never call me or write me
or try to see me,

813
01:07:04,007 --> 01:07:05,884
ever,

814
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:12,279
then I'll go to the town hall and, if it seems
so important to you, I'll get a passport.

815
01:07:12,687 --> 01:07:14,245
Do you understand?

816
01:07:14,367 --> 01:07:17,677
You'll only get a passport
if we never see each other again.

817
01:07:18,527 --> 01:07:20,438
Goodbye, Colin.

818
01:07:20,567 --> 01:07:23,240
But if we never see
or talk to each other again,

819
01:07:23,367 --> 01:07:25,642
how will I know you've sent for a passport?

820
01:07:25,767 --> 01:07:28,156
You'll just have to trust me.

821
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:32,761
- Goodbye for ever, then.
- Don't make a joke of it.

822
01:07:32,887 --> 01:07:35,321
Just plain goodbye, then.

823
01:07:57,967 --> 01:08:02,245
So, these'll be for
your "lmages of Hope" exhibition, right?

824
01:08:02,367 --> 01:08:04,517
We liked that, didn't we, Harold?

825
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:07,081
"Birthplace of American Art."

826
01:08:07,207 --> 01:08:08,765
And how's young Mandy?

827
01:08:08,887 --> 01:08:13,165
We don't see much of her
since that fiancée of yours came to town.

828
01:08:13,287 --> 01:08:15,881
Settin' off the hotel sprinklers.

829
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:18,401
Do you know what colour underwear
I have on today?

830
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:20,518
Just in case
you need to spread the word.

831
01:08:20,647 --> 01:08:23,366
Word is, you don't wear no underwear.

832
01:08:39,207 --> 01:08:42,483
It's uncanny.

833
01:08:42,607 --> 01:08:45,917
Funny and serious, all at once.

834
01:08:46,047 --> 01:08:49,756
Brash, with just a hint of impishness.

835
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,637
Pulsating with youthful energy,
while at the same time

836
01:08:54,767 --> 01:08:58,555
exuding a passionate sense of civic pride.

837
01:09:04,007 --> 01:09:09,206
Doug, you did say something, didn't you,
about the key to the city and all that?

838
01:09:09,327 --> 01:09:12,046
- Anything I want?
- Anything.

839
01:09:12,167 --> 01:09:15,477
Anything you want.
Doug Reed's word is his bond.

840
01:09:15,607 --> 01:09:18,565
You just ask and you shall have it.

841
01:09:22,087 --> 01:09:24,806
Shrewd judge of human nature
that I am,

842
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:28,556
I sense we're about to have revealed here

843
01:09:28,687 --> 01:09:33,238
the dark side of Mr Colin Ware.

844
01:09:38,367 --> 01:09:42,042
Thanks for meeting me, Col.
I have something to show you.

845
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:45,716
You won't believe it. This morning
Doug called me into his office.

846
01:09:45,847 --> 01:09:48,361
- Doug?
- Doug Reed. The mayor.

847
01:09:48,487 --> 01:09:52,321
- You told him all about me.
- Yes, I think I did mention you in passing.

848
01:09:52,447 --> 01:09:54,278
More than just in passing.

849
01:09:54,407 --> 01:09:58,366
He knew my name was Edwards, he knew
I'm half-Welsh, and he knew I was here.

850
01:09:58,487 --> 01:10:02,765
Which is why he was so very excited.
I've got to show you this.

851
01:10:03,487 --> 01:10:08,436
This is my family tree

852
01:10:08,567 --> 01:10:11,206
going back 300 years.

853
01:10:12,967 --> 01:10:15,003
Doug found this website in Salt Lake City

854
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:18,199
that has the genealogy
of everybody in the world.

855
01:10:18,327 --> 01:10:23,959
You type in your credit-card details and up
comes your family tree. It's amazing. Look.

856
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:26,157
Here I am - Vera Edwards.

857
01:10:26,287 --> 01:10:28,403
And there is Alicia.

858
01:10:28,527 --> 01:10:32,156
And then there's my dad.
And there's the person he married.

859
01:10:32,287 --> 01:10:34,517
- Your mother.
- Right.

860
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,683
Then there's Grandma Edwards.

861
01:10:36,807 --> 01:10:39,640
That's her maiden name,
except they've spelt it wrong.

862
01:10:39,767 --> 01:10:43,806
- No, they haven't.
- Yes, they have. It's Kendal with one <i>I.</i>

863
01:10:43,927 --> 01:10:46,805
Then you get up here.
This is where it gets good.

864
01:10:46,927 --> 01:10:52,081
Here is Godwyn Edwards
and his wife, Abigail.

865
01:10:52,967 --> 01:10:58,405
Do you know who those two people are?
They're everywhere! Look!

866
01:10:59,007 --> 01:11:01,441
Godwyn Edwards. And Abigail Edwards.

867
01:11:01,567 --> 01:11:04,161
The people that founded Hope
are my ancestors!

868
01:11:04,247 --> 01:11:08,798
- Good heavens!
- I know. I couldn't believe it. It's amazing.

869
01:11:08,927 --> 01:11:10,485
But that's just the start.

870
01:11:10,607 --> 01:11:13,041
- There's more?
- Yes.

871
01:11:14,167 --> 01:11:17,921
You know there's this annual Cannon Ball
thing that happens on Saturday?

872
01:11:18,047 --> 01:11:21,483
Apparently that's when they choose
the new Queen of Hope.

873
01:11:21,607 --> 01:11:23,040
Queen of Hope?

874
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:26,284
Doug chooses who will represent the town
as its queen.

875
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:32,323
The ridiculous thing is, he thinks, because
of my family history, I should apply.

876
01:11:32,447 --> 01:11:35,041
- To be queen?
- I know! It's preposterous, isn't it?

877
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:38,762
I mean, it's absurd, even for me.
Isn't it?

878
01:11:38,887 --> 01:11:41,481
- Is it?
- I don't know, you see.

879
01:11:41,607 --> 01:11:44,280
Is it something
I should really contemplate doing?

880
01:11:44,407 --> 01:11:48,002
I don't know.
What does being Queen of Hope involve?

881
01:11:48,127 --> 01:11:50,960
It's just a week of engagements
and things like that.

882
01:11:51,087 --> 01:11:54,443
And they want the queen to
promote the new mineral water this year.

883
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:58,958
He wants to build a whole ad campaign
around it. TV spots, public appearances.

884
01:11:59,087 --> 01:12:02,363
- Her picture on the label.
- Presumably you'd have a crown?

885
01:12:02,487 --> 01:12:06,321
There's a whole special outfit.
He showed me lots of old photographs.

886
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:10,281
- Of lots of old queens?
- Of former incumbents.

887
01:12:12,967 --> 01:12:19,156
I know we're having major differences,
but I could really use your advice on this.

888
01:12:21,287 --> 01:12:23,517
I can't do this.

889
01:12:23,647 --> 01:12:26,241
- I can't go on with this.
- Go on with what?

890
01:12:26,327 --> 01:12:29,160
This. This joke. It's all a joke, Vera.

891
01:12:29,287 --> 01:12:33,439
- What do you mean, a joke?
- This is just a fake. I made it up.

892
01:12:33,567 --> 01:12:38,118
The family-tree thing, anyway. The queen
thing was a Doug Reed embellishment.

893
01:12:38,247 --> 01:12:40,886
I was just so pissed off with you,

894
01:12:41,007 --> 01:12:45,239
with all your tricks and the way
you've been buggering things up for me.

895
01:12:45,367 --> 01:12:48,404
That is so bloody typical of you.

896
01:12:48,527 --> 01:12:53,555
You have never, ever, been able
to share in my excitement about anything.

897
01:12:53,687 --> 01:12:56,281
- It's a fake, Vera.
- It is not a fake, Colin.

898
01:12:56,367 --> 01:12:59,882
It is a fake. Look. "Kendall",
even spelt wrong the way I spell it wrong.

899
01:13:00,007 --> 01:13:04,603
I watched Doug log on and type in
my details. I saw this being printed out.

900
01:13:04,727 --> 01:13:06,718
I saw it with my own eyes!

901
01:13:06,847 --> 01:13:10,635
Of course, because he loaded it all up
in advance! I saw him with my own eyes!

902
01:13:10,767 --> 01:13:13,076
Have you looked closely?
Tom Jones is in there!

903
01:13:13,207 --> 01:13:18,440
- Jones is a very common Welsh name.
- Yes, but married to a Catherine Zeta?

904
01:13:35,447 --> 01:13:38,166
I bet you and Mandy
had a right giggle about this.

905
01:13:38,287 --> 01:13:40,676
We're not together any more.

906
01:13:40,807 --> 01:13:42,763
- Really?
- Really.

907
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,043
It's all over?

908
01:13:48,047 --> 01:13:50,242
Yeah.

909
01:13:58,007 --> 01:14:02,523
You're still not coming home with me,
though, are you?

910
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,319
No.

911
01:14:06,327 --> 01:14:09,160
Sorry, ma'am, there's no smoking.

912
01:14:10,767 --> 01:14:13,565
Are you two finished?

913
01:14:16,247 --> 01:14:18,966
You know, I do believe we are.

914
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:22,045
I'll be right back with your check, then.

915
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:27,239
What are you going to do now, then?

916
01:14:27,367 --> 01:14:29,323
Be Queen of Hope?

917
01:14:42,927 --> 01:14:44,997
Colin Ware! Two words!

918
01:14:45,127 --> 01:14:50,360
Two words I have for you, Colin Ware:
Class act.

919
01:14:51,807 --> 01:14:56,961
I know history has witnessed a long line
of lunacy from your small island shores,

920
01:14:57,087 --> 01:15:02,036
but for a man of your apparent intelligence
to relinquish from his emotional grasp

921
01:15:02,167 --> 01:15:06,206
that shimmering angel
of sensual splendour...

922
01:15:06,327 --> 01:15:07,885
You seem very smitten.

923
01:15:08,007 --> 01:15:12,000
You're taking off? You're not hanging
around for the biggest bang of the year?

924
01:15:12,127 --> 01:15:15,164
Not the biggest bang of your year,
from what I understand.

925
01:15:15,287 --> 01:15:20,236
It's been very, very nice to meet you, Doug.
Thank you for everything.

926
01:15:20,367 --> 01:15:23,677
No, thank you, Colin! Thank you!

927
01:15:23,807 --> 01:15:26,799
Thanks to you,
that terrible, wondrous thing

928
01:15:26,927 --> 01:15:29,760
that poets have sung about
down through the ages

929
01:15:29,887 --> 01:15:37,601
has finally found its way into
the lonely heart of Douglas Elmore Reed!

930
01:15:54,447 --> 01:15:58,201
And now,
please welcome Mayor Doug Reed!

931
01:16:06,327 --> 01:16:08,158
Thank you very much.

932
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,000
And now,

933
01:16:10,127 --> 01:16:13,039
as is our great and cherished tradition,

934
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:15,158
we get the annual Cannon Ball rolling

935
01:16:15,287 --> 01:16:18,836
with the introduction
of the new Queen of Hope!

936
01:16:23,927 --> 01:16:28,921
Help me welcome her. Raise
your glasses for the new Queen of Hope,

937
01:16:29,047 --> 01:16:31,481
Miss Vera Edwards!

938
01:17:14,127 --> 01:17:16,083
Man the phones, Fisher!

939
01:17:34,727 --> 01:17:38,481
Look, I got this fax from Colin,
from the airport.

940
01:17:38,607 --> 01:17:40,359
- Is it for me?
- For you?

941
01:17:40,487 --> 01:17:42,955
When you make a guy promise
never to get in touch,

942
01:17:43,087 --> 01:17:48,115
they can make the wild assumption that
you don't want them ever to get in touch.

943
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:54,595
Sorry, honey. But did Colin ever mention
his cousin, Cheswick, over in Ohio?

944
01:17:56,447 --> 01:18:02,124
Colin arranged for this guy to visit,
then forgot to cancel it before he flew off.

945
01:18:02,247 --> 01:18:05,239
He's faxed me asking me
if I would meet this guy

946
01:18:05,367 --> 01:18:08,165
at the gardens
where they had arranged to meet - now.

947
01:18:08,287 --> 01:18:13,236
And I've got to set up the barbecue
at the inn, and the rooms need doing and...

948
01:18:13,367 --> 01:18:18,566
- So you want me to go.
- A free Filet-o-Fisher tonight.

949
01:18:49,047 --> 01:18:51,083
Excuse me. Are you Mandy?

950
01:19:00,207 --> 01:19:02,562
You must be Cheswick.

951
01:19:02,687 --> 01:19:05,360
Yes. That's right.

952
01:19:05,487 --> 01:19:07,443
Pleased to meet you.

953
01:19:10,687 --> 01:19:14,805
I guess you got to know my cousin Colin
pretty well when he was up here.

954
01:19:15,567 --> 01:19:18,001
He's an odd chap, didn't you find?

955
01:19:18,127 --> 01:19:20,083
He's very odd.

956
01:19:22,567 --> 01:19:27,561
Colin told me he promised never to
contact you. Something about a passport?

957
01:19:27,687 --> 01:19:30,326
He didn't think it'd break the rules
if I spoke to you.

958
01:19:30,447 --> 01:19:34,201
But he didn't warn me
about your bizarre dress sense.

959
01:19:36,287 --> 01:19:38,960
Do you want to sit down for a minute?

960
01:19:51,327 --> 01:19:54,797
Did Colin tell you about my hobby?

961
01:19:54,927 --> 01:19:59,443
Colin, at first this Cheswick stuff
was really funny, but now it's just irritating.

962
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:02,320
He didn't tell you about my hobby?

963
01:20:03,847 --> 01:20:05,963
No, Cheswick. What is your hobby?

964
01:20:07,287 --> 01:20:09,243
I collect jewellery.

965
01:20:09,367 --> 01:20:11,961
Can I show you an example?

966
01:20:12,047 --> 01:20:15,084
I picked this up in a store in Columbus
the other day.

967
01:20:15,207 --> 01:20:19,564
It's just a little gold ring
with a thing on it.

968
01:20:19,687 --> 01:20:22,406
I think it's a moth.

969
01:20:22,527 --> 01:20:25,485
Is this a friendship ring or something?

970
01:20:25,607 --> 01:20:31,159
The chap in the store said that it was
an engagement ring, which surprised me.

971
01:20:31,287 --> 01:20:35,644
I thought engagement rings
were silverish, with a diamond.

972
01:20:35,767 --> 01:20:38,679
But no. Apparently they can be
any way you want them.

973
01:20:38,807 --> 01:20:40,957
There's one disappointing thing.

974
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:47,765
On the bus coming up here, I took it out
to look at it, and I noticed it's second-hand.

975
01:20:47,887 --> 01:20:52,278
Underneath, there's a little heart and two
names, presumably the previous owners.

976
01:20:52,407 --> 01:20:56,958
It's very small but you can just about
make them out - I forget the names.

977
01:20:59,687 --> 01:21:01,643
Mandy?

978
01:21:03,087 --> 01:21:05,681
Perhaps you should take this off.

979
01:21:07,727 --> 01:21:11,356
- Mandy, can you speak?
- I'm sorry. You can put me down now.

980
01:21:11,487 --> 01:21:14,240
- No, I want to carry you.
- No, really. I can walk.

981
01:21:14,367 --> 01:21:16,323
- I want to carry you.
- I want to walk.

982
01:21:16,447 --> 01:21:21,601
Mandy, I'm experiencing an atavistic urge
right now to carry you, OK?

983
01:21:21,727 --> 01:21:24,480
- Where is the car?
- At home. Why? Where are we going?

984
01:21:24,607 --> 01:21:28,566
- I checked back in at the inn.
- You can't carry me all the way back there.

985
01:21:28,687 --> 01:21:34,637
Please don't interfere. My manhood is
crying out to meet this supreme challenge.

986
01:21:37,127 --> 01:21:39,880
Good afternoon,
Mrs Peterson, Mr Peterson!

987
01:21:40,007 --> 01:21:41,963
Just keeping you up to date on things!

988
01:21:47,607 --> 01:21:52,317
- Sorry if this seems a bit primitive.
- Primitive's fine.

989
01:21:52,447 --> 01:21:56,406
- But don't throw your back out, OK?
- I have a back of iron.

990
01:22:25,887 --> 01:22:29,846
I must be getting too heavy now.

991
01:22:29,967 --> 01:22:33,403
Yeah, but we're building a memory here.

992
01:23:13,527 --> 01:23:15,085
Hey, Fisher!

993
01:23:41,727 --> 01:23:44,605
- Well?
- They're engaged.

994
01:23:44,727 --> 01:23:46,683
- Are you serious?
- They just did it.

995
01:23:46,807 --> 01:23:48,877
Why was he carrying her
down the highway?

996
01:23:49,007 --> 01:23:52,636
It's a custom over there,
where Colin comes from.

997
01:23:52,767 --> 01:23:56,362
- To carry people down the highway?
- Highway, roadway, whatever.

998
01:23:56,487 --> 01:23:58,762
It's from an ancient druid ritual, Joanie.

999
01:23:58,887 --> 01:24:01,117
They carry their intended
down a long path

1000
01:24:01,247 --> 01:24:04,523
as a symbolic way of
embarkin' upon the life ahead of 'em.

1001
01:24:05,367 --> 01:24:10,725
I guess it's true about how far behind
the rest of the world the English are.

1002
01:24:14,927 --> 01:24:17,999
- Non-innocent kind?
- Non-innocent kind.

1003
01:24:18,127 --> 01:24:20,357
Lord only knows what they get up to now.

1004
01:24:31,927 --> 01:24:33,360
Oh, God!

1005
