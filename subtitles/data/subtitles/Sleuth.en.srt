1
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:55,099
- Yes?
- Andrew Wyke?

2
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:57,153
That's right.

3
00:01:57,953 --> 00:01:59,513
I'm Milo Tindle.

4
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:02,364
Oh, yes, good.

5
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:08,343
Glad to meet you.

6
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:12,088
You got the train to Charlebury,
did you?

7
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:14,493
- I drove.
- Oh, you drove?

8
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,768
That's my car.

9
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,758
Oh, the little one?

10
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,570
- Not the big one.
- No, the big one's mine.

11
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:22,590
What do you think of it?

12
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:27,774
- Very handsome.
- Yeah.

13
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:30,007
It is, isn't it?

14
00:02:32,638 --> 00:02:34,263
Come in.

15
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:42,485
I was watching a video
of one of my books on television.

16
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:49,433
Like the house?

17
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:51,026
Extraordinary.

18
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:54,809
You know who designed it,
who the interior decorator was?

19
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:57,241
Yes, your wife.

20
00:02:57,404 --> 00:02:58,812
You knew?

21
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:00,597
Yes, I knew.

22
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,706
I'll show you around later.

23
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:04,469
Have a drink. I'm drinking vodka.

24
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:07,188
- Scotch, please.
- Scotch.

25
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:10,704
Milo, what an interesting name.
You're a foreigner, I take it?

26
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,264
My father's Italian.

27
00:03:13,435 --> 00:03:15,574
Milo sounds Hungarian.

28
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:17,332
Does it?

29
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:19,792
Here's your Scotch.

30
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,890
Cheers.

31
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:25,782
Cheers.

32
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:30,385
You sure your father
isn't Hungarian?

33
00:03:30,554 --> 00:03:33,303
Well, if he is,
he's kept it a dead secret for years.

34
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:35,985
- And your mother?
- English.

35
00:03:36,154 --> 00:03:38,543
So you're a kind of half-breed?

36
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,493
Sit down.

37
00:03:48,664 --> 00:03:51,249
- Thanks for agreeing to see me.
- Not at all.

38
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,423
I didn't know you wrote plays
for television.

39
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:55,959
I don't. I write crime novels.
You must know that.

40
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:57,102
I had heard.

41
00:03:57,272 --> 00:04:00,621
But sometimes they're adapted
for television by other people.

42
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:02,963
You know what the word
adapted means, I take it?

43
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:04,884
Adapted?

44
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:07,021
They may not have such a word
in Italian.

45
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:09,941
- I speak English.
- Good.

46
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:13,419
Come and have a look
at my special book room.

47
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:23,952
These are all my novels.

48
00:04:24,118 --> 00:04:26,060
You've read them, I suppose?

49
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,019
Afraid not.

50
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:30,069
Good God, no?
What about this one?

51
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,434
<i>- Rat in a Trap?
- No.</i>

52
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:34,158
<i>- The Obelisk?
- No.</i>

53
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:35,307
<i>- Blackout?
- No.</i>

54
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:37,866
<i>- Dead Fish?
- Afraid not.</i>

55
00:04:38,037 --> 00:04:39,825
God, you're one in a million.

56
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:43,818
- Am I?
- Oh, absolu... I'm very popular.

57
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:45,930
You see this shelf?

58
00:04:46,548 --> 00:04:47,978
Translations.

59
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:51,444
French, Dutch, German.

60
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,327
You speak Dutch yourself, do you?

61
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:56,525
Yes, how did you know?
I have a Dutch uncle.

62
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:58,547
Can't see any Italian translations.

63
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,734
No, they're a funny lot, the Italians.
Culture isn't really their thing.

64
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:04,208
Their salami's good, though.

65
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,990
- Oh, is it?
- Italian salami? Best in the world.

66
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:08,911
Did you bring any with you?

67
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,115
- No, I left it at home.
- Oh, shame.

68
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:12,973
We're gonna have it
for supper tonight.

69
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:14,926
With a couple of bottles
of Valpolicella.

70
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,938
- We?
- Maggie and me.

71
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:21,904
Your glass is empty.
What were you drinking, vodka?

72
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:24,488
- Scotch.
- Scotch.

73
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,866
<i>I want to come to the point.</i>

74
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:39,308
<i>Point? What point?</i>

75
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,294
<i>Are you gonna give Maggie
a divorce?</i>

76
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:42,733
<i>And if not, why not?</i>

77
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:45,230
<i>Yeah, yes, yes, we'll come to that.</i>

78
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:47,302
<i>She thinks
you're being unreasonable.</i>

79
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,999
<i>So do I.</i>

80
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:52,233
<i>She's never coming back to you,
so why not just give her the divorce?</i>

81
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,661
<i>It'll do her good to wait for five years.
Good for her character.</i>

82
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:58,245
<i>You're going to make her wait
five years?</i>

83
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:01,763
<i>- That's the law. The law of the land.
- But that's pure spite.</i>

84
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:06,026
<i>Anyway, we'll get back to that,
perhaps. Have your drink first.</i>

85
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:11,463
<i>What do you do, by the way?</i>

86
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:13,125
<i>I'm an actor.</i>

87
00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:15,596
<i>Good God. Are you really?</i>

88
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:18,409
<i>I thought Maggie said
you were a hairdresser.</i>

89
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:20,613
<i>She must have been talking
about someone else.</i>

90
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:22,211
<i>You mean another friend?</i>

91
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,788
<i>Another friend?</i>

92
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,640
<i>She tends to have
more than one friend.</i>

93
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:27,015
<i>- Does she?
- Oh, yes.</i>

94
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:28,523
<i>I'm her only friend.</i>

95
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:30,146
<i>She must be lonely.</i>

96
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:31,877
<i>She's not.</i>

97
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:35,591
<i>Acting is a pretty precarious
profession, isn't it?</i>

98
00:06:35,757 --> 00:06:37,960
<i>What are you acting in
at the moment?</i>

99
00:06:38,124 --> 00:06:39,913
<i>I'm out of work.</i>

100
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,058
<i>Poor chap.</i>

101
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:43,846
<i>I drive cars now and again,
chauffeuring.</i>

102
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:46,347
<i>- Oh, tough life.
- I keep my head above water.</i>

103
00:06:47,756 --> 00:06:49,927
<i>What sort of parts do you play?</i>

104
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,122
Killers, mostly.

105
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,225
Sex maniacs, perverts.

106
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:57,922
But you're so charming.

107
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:00,611
Yes, I know.
Anyway, what about this divorce?

108
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:02,917
What's your position, exactly?

109
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:05,449
All in good time.

110
00:07:13,962 --> 00:07:15,522
Come in.

111
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:25,160
Have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

112
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,310
I understand you're fucking my wife.

113
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:35,521
- That's right.
- Right.

114
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,281
Yes, right.

115
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:39,488
- So we've cleared that up.
- We have.

116
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:41,761
- I thought you might deny it.
- Why would I deny it?

117
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:44,677
- Well, she is my wife.
- Yes, but she's fucking me.

118
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,425
Oh, she's fucking you too?
Well, I'll be buggered.

119
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:49,889
- Sorry.
- Yes, it's mutual.

120
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:51,681
- You take turns?
- We fuck each other.

121
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,556
- That's what people do.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I follow.

122
00:07:58,374 --> 00:08:00,829
- We're in love.
- You're in love?

123
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:02,433
That's right.

124
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:07,965
Let me top you up.

125
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:19,168
I heard a rumor
that you wanted to marry her.

126
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,221
- That can't be true, can it?
- Why not?

127
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:24,163
In this day and age,
is marriage absolutely necessary?

128
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:25,338
Isn't it a bit old hat?

129
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:27,297
- Is it?
- It's a mug's game.

130
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,981
I wouldn't go near it if I were you.
You can't marry her.

131
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:32,254
You can't marry her
because she's married to me.

132
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,045
Unless I divorce her, of course.

133
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,154
- And are you?
- Am I what?

134
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:37,371
Going to divorce her?

135
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,547
Are you really gonna
make her wait five years?

136
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:42,498
- She wants to know.
- To be honest, I can't wait.

137
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:45,726
But there are one or two things
I'd like to clear up first.

138
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:50,364
For example, I've never heard
of an Italian called Tindle.

139
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,938
My father's name is Tindolini.

140
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:55,295
Now, that's lovely.
That's like a little bell.

141
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,360
Why don't you go back to Tindolini?
It suits you.

142
00:08:58,529 --> 00:08:59,937
- You think so?
- Yes.

143
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:04,538
So if and when you marry Maggie,
she'll be Maggie Tindolini.

144
00:09:04,705 --> 00:09:07,072
Do you get a kick out of that?

145
00:09:07,682 --> 00:09:09,885
What name do you act under?
Tindle or Tindolini?

146
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,959
- Tindle.
- Why have I never heard of you?

147
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:13,405
You will before long.

148
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:15,358
- Really?
- In spades.

149
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,114
- That sounds threatening.
- Does it?

150
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:18,688
Doesn't it?

151
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:24,090
Why don't we get down
to brass tacks?

152
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:27,070
Brass tacks, yes. Why not?

153
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,491
This is the way I see it.

154
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:33,144
Come upstairs.

155
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:36,029
I want to show you something.

156
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:42,808
Are you all right in elevators?

157
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:48,695
It won't make you sick
or anything, will it?

158
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,131
This is our bedroom.

159
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:12,985
And this is my wife's dressing room.

160
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:17,303
She left a few dresses.
Couldn't be bothered to pick them up.

161
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:20,665
They're worth thousands.
Thousands.

162
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:24,340
This leather coat alone
is worth 5000 quid.

163
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:27,956
So you see, the thing is this.
Sit down.

164
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,497
The thing is this,
my wife spends money like water.

165
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,848
So if you're not careful,
she'll eat you out of house and home.

166
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:41,142
She was born to luxury, you know.
Jamaica, the Ritz, the Swiss Alps.

167
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:44,951
What are you?
Out-of-work actor, part-time chauffeur.

168
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:48,017
You're out of your depth, old boy.
You're on a hiding to nothing.

169
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:49,779
If you think you're broke now...

170
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:53,012
...you'll be 10 times broker
by the time she's finished with you.

171
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:54,901
She'll have your guts for garters.

172
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:59,280
- She's in love with me.
- Oh, never trust in love, chum.

173
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:02,297
Love will kick you up the arse
as soon as look at you.

174
00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:05,839
One minute, it's love,
10 minutes later, it's contempt.

175
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:07,569
That's your own experience, is it?

176
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:10,420
Oh, no, no, no, that's observation.

177
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:12,788
Don't forget, I'm a novelist.

178
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:15,319
I observe people.

179
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:18,994
What I'm getting at is you won't
be able to give her what she wants.

180
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,909
So she's gonna leave you,
come back to me.

181
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:24,527
I don't want her near me.
That's the last thing I want.

182
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:26,451
I've had her up to here.

183
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:30,641
Anyway, I've got this lovely mistress.
She runs a sauna in Swindon.

184
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:31,822
She's my girl.

185
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,838
So you see,
I want Maggie to stay with you.

186
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:37,748
I want you two
to be together forever.

187
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:39,252
But unless you listen to me...

188
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:41,519
...the whole thing
will be a fucking disaster...

189
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:45,069
...with catastrophic consequences
all round.

190
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:50,319
But I have a solution.

191
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:57,036
You won't believe
what I'm gonna say.

192
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:00,908
What are you gonna say?

193
00:12:01,077 --> 00:12:03,443
I'm all ears.

194
00:12:03,604 --> 00:12:05,066
You know something?

195
00:12:05,237 --> 00:12:07,059
I'm beginning to respond
to your charm.

196
00:12:07,221 --> 00:12:08,650
- Get away.
- No, it's true.

197
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:12,136
- I'm really touched.
- You should be.

198
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:15,472
Tell me, I bet you didn't expect me
to be so intelligent.

199
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:17,491
So quick-witted, did you?

200
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:19,724
Oh, I did.

201
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:21,680
Quite.

202
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:25,394
Maggie told you, did she?

203
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:30,505
What's your solution?

204
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:36,872
It's a close fit, isn't it?

205
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,798
For two.

206
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,221
Listen, I'm going
to make you a proposition.

207
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:53,518
A few years ago,
I gave her some jewels.

208
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:55,917
Amazingly expensive.

209
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,855
I didn't give them to her, I own them.
They're insured in my name.

210
00:13:00,017 --> 00:13:03,246
But I let her use them
on special occasions.

211
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,158
They're worth 1 million pounds.

212
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:09,386
They spend half the time in the bank,
half the time in the safe.

213
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:14,221
At the moment, they're here
in the house, in the safe.

214
00:13:14,383 --> 00:13:18,311
And I want you to steal them.

215
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,772
- Steal them?
- That's right.

216
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:28,393
- What the hell do you mean?
- I want you to steal the jewels.

217
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,893
You want me to steal the jewels?
I don't get it.

218
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:33,607
It's simple. You steal the jewels,
sell them abroad...

219
00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:36,424
...and you live happily ever after
with Maggie.

220
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,046
I get rid of my wife
and I'll be like a pig in shit.

221
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:42,410
You can keep Maggie in the manner
to which she's become accustomed.

222
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,737
You want me to take part
in a scummy little plot...

223
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:48,072
...to defraud your insurance company,
is that it?

224
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:49,731
I thought it was quite elegant.

225
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,395
What do you think I am?

226
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,019
What the fuck
are you actually talking about?

227
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:56,522
- These are real facts.
- This is a joke.

228
00:13:56,684 --> 00:13:57,667
- No.
- It's also a trap.

229
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,397
- A trap?
- Yes. You think I'm a fool.

230
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:00,774
Well, are you?

231
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,217
- It doesn't hold up.
- Why not?

232
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,729
They're worth a million pounds. You'd
get a fraction of that from any fence.

233
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,899
I have already contacted
a friend of mine in Amsterdam.

234
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:14,436
And he will give you
800,000 pounds tax-free.

235
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,544
Now, think about it.

236
00:14:16,715 --> 00:14:19,202
Eight hundred thousand pounds...

237
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:21,346
...tax-free.

238
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:25,092
Why would he do that?

239
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:27,909
When you steal the jewels,
you will also steal the receipts.

240
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,620
So he'll have title to the jewels
as well as the jewels themselves...

241
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:34,306
...so that when he sells them,
he gets full value.

242
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,398
Got it?

243
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:41,285
Think about it.

244
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,489
Take your time.

245
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:03,462
And why would you do all this?

246
00:15:03,624 --> 00:15:08,163
Listen, under this crooked exterior,
I am a simple, honest man.

247
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:11,808
Every word I've told you is true,
I swear it.

248
00:15:11,976 --> 00:15:17,245
I want to get rid of my wife,
but I want it to be solid, permanent.

249
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:20,316
I don't want her on my back.
I want her to stay on your back.

250
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,915
This is a frame-up.

251
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,323
- A frame-up?
- Yes.

252
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:26,941
You want to destroy me.

253
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:28,320
You want to see me in jail.

254
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:31,835
You want me to do this
and then shop me to the police.

255
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,183
No, no, no.

256
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,506
If I shop you, then you'll shop me,
and then we'll both end up in jail.

257
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:40,035
No, I take a strictly moral position
on all this.

258
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:42,139
My wife is an adulteress.

259
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,512
Actually,
she should be stoned to death.

260
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:47,327
Anyway, it's up to you.
Make up your own mind.

261
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:48,834
You're asking me to trust you?

262
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:50,883
I don't give a fuck
if you trust me or not.

263
00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:52,571
This is a simple proposition.

264
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,260
You have an expensive woman
and no money.

265
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:58,363
You wanna keep the woman,
steal the jewels.

266
00:15:58,532 --> 00:16:02,208
Why don't you steal the jewels
and give them to me?

267
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:03,931
Don't be a bloody fool.

268
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:07,395
The burglary has to be right.
The house has to be broken into.

269
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:10,206
- Why don't you break into it?
- For chrissake, I'm in it.

270
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:13,054
How can I break into it? I live here.

271
00:16:39,904 --> 00:16:40,886
Okay.

272
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:46,685
If I were to agree to do this,
would you agree to the divorce?

273
00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:48,473
Why should I give her the divorce...

274
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,941
...if you're both walking away
with 800,000 pounds?

275
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:53,176
She wants a legal settlement.

276
00:16:53,824 --> 00:16:55,734
- She wants part of your estate.
- Greedy.

277
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:57,561
That's legal justice.

278
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,897
Never trust in legal justice.

279
00:17:00,063 --> 00:17:01,851
You know what legal justice is?

280
00:17:02,015 --> 00:17:05,844
It's farting "Annie Laurie"
through a keyhole.

281
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:11,318
Listen, 800,000 pounds...

282
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:12,664
...tax-free.

283
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,740
All yours, in cash.

284
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,554
- Why don't you stop pissing around?
- But wait a minute.

285
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:21,532
You get a million
from the insurance.

286
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:23,122
Sure I do.

287
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,911
Well, all right, I'll be frank.

288
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:29,655
I need it. Cash flow,
stocks, shares going down.

289
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:32,471
Get me? Quid pro quo.

290
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:36,281
You do me a favor, I do you a favor,
you keep the woman.

291
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,213
Okay.

292
00:17:41,148 --> 00:17:42,555
Let's make a deal.

293
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:45,498
- What deal?
- I break in, I steal the jewels.

294
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,489
And you agree to the divorce.

295
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:54,329
That's the deal. Otherwise, fuck it.
That's another quid pro quo.

296
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,596
But you have to shake on it.

297
00:17:58,267 --> 00:17:59,860
All right.

298
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:02,003
I'll shake on it.

299
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:03,959
Here's my hand.

300
00:18:05,402 --> 00:18:07,028
Okay.

301
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,120
Okay. So, what do I do?

302
00:18:12,282 --> 00:18:14,354
You break in.

303
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:16,082
You see that skylight up there?

304
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:20,439
Well, that window there is the only one
that the burglar alarm doesn't touch.

305
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:21,583
You get in there.

306
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:25,102
- That's pretty high up.
- Well, you climb a ladder.

307
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:27,128
- I'm not good at heights.
- You can do it.

308
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:29,198
Honestly, I know you can.

309
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:32,052
- You're having me on.
- Oh, come on. Behave like a man.

310
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:33,493
A man of action.

311
00:18:33,657 --> 00:18:36,340
You don't have to be a hairdresser
for the rest of your life.

312
00:18:36,504 --> 00:18:40,726
You can be free, independent,
take care of the woman you love.

313
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:42,350
Listen...

314
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:44,277
Put this on.

315
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:46,894
I use it to communicate
with my gardener.

316
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,714
Lovely. Actually, it suits you.

317
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:57,676
This is what you do. You go outside.

318
00:18:57,847 --> 00:19:00,781
Across the lawn, there's a shed.
Behind the shed, there's a ladder.

319
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:03,733
You take the ladder, put it up
against the wall of the house...

320
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:07,276
...and I direct you
through the earphone.

321
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,642
- Are you with me?
- Well, yes, yes.

322
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:13,194
- But I'm anxious and frightened.
- Trust me.

323
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:15,886
- But I don't.
- Well, trust me and all will be well.

324
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:19,698
Just follow my advice.
It's got to look real.

325
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:21,868
We have to convince
the insurance people...

326
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,175
...and the police,
if you see what I mean.

327
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:28,814
Maggie never told me
you were such a manipulator.

328
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,541
She told me
you were no good in bed.

329
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,684
But she never told me
you were a manipulator.

330
00:19:32,852 --> 00:19:35,918
- She told you I was no good in bed?
- Oh, yes.

331
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,597
She was joking.
I'm wonderful in bed.

332
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,705
I must tell her.

333
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:54,958
- There's the shed across the lawn.
- Shed, yeah.

334
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:59,052
- There's the ladder behind the shed.
- The ladder?

335
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:01,453
The ladder.

336
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:05,327
Inside the shed,
there's a pair of gardening gloves.

337
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:07,945
Put them on. By the gardening gloves,
there's a hammer.

338
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:09,673
You go round the back of the house.

339
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,231
Put the ladder up against the wall
by the lower roof.

340
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:15,467
Then, carry the hammer up the ladder
on to the lower roof.

341
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,901
Then, you pull the ladder up
on to the main roof...

342
00:20:18,064 --> 00:20:20,682
...and break the skylight window
with the hammer.

343
00:20:25,744 --> 00:20:29,289
Wait a minute.
You've forgotten one major item.

344
00:20:29,456 --> 00:20:31,311
What?

345
00:20:31,472 --> 00:20:33,992
Once I'm in,
how do I get down to floor level?

346
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,396
Didn't I tell you? Oh, sorry.

347
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,468
You see that small metal door
up there?

348
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,362
Inside, there's an electric ladder.

349
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:43,015
You get through the window,
I press a button.

350
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:44,393
The ladder descends.

351
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,795
- You get on and climb down.
- Let me see it descend.

352
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,868
- What?
- Let me see it come down now.

353
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:50,500
Sure.

354
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:08,259
See? Easy as pissing.

355
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:15,816
- I have a funny feeling that I'm a cunt.
- Of course you're a cunt.

356
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:19,745
But so what?
You'll end up a wealthy man.

357
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,566
Obey the rules. Just obey the rules.

358
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:26,181
- Whose rules?
- My rules.

359
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:30,404
Go and get the other ladder.

360
00:21:58,538 --> 00:21:59,944
Can you see the ladder?

361
00:22:03,753 --> 00:22:05,378
<i>Can I see the ladder?</i>

362
00:22:17,832 --> 00:22:20,516
Place the ladder against the wall.

363
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,654
<i>Okay.</i>

364
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,436
Extend the ladder.

365
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,777
<i>Okay.</i>

366
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,791
<i>- Climb up the ladder.
- Okay!</i>

367
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,892
Climb up the ladder.

368
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:43,809
<i>Why am I doing this?</i>

369
00:22:57,317 --> 00:23:00,132
Keep calm. Keep calm.

370
00:23:00,293 --> 00:23:02,943
Keep coming. Keep coming.

371
00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:04,832
<i>- Watch your step.
- Jesus.</i>

372
00:23:11,845 --> 00:23:13,884
Keep calm.

373
00:23:53,761 --> 00:23:56,412
<i>- Watch your step.
- I'm gonna die.</i>

374
00:23:57,953 --> 00:23:58,848
Fuck.

375
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:02,104
Don't stop. Keep going.

376
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:04,726
Don't look down.

377
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:08,213
You're at the window.

378
00:24:09,312 --> 00:24:10,938
Smash it.

379
00:24:20,352 --> 00:24:21,879
Fantastic.

380
00:24:24,223 --> 00:24:25,815
- Where's the ladder?
- What ladder?

381
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:27,608
The ladder. Where's it gone?

382
00:24:27,775 --> 00:24:30,645
It's not working. There was
always a dodgy fuse on this.

383
00:24:30,814 --> 00:24:32,701
I'll phone the electrician
in the morning.

384
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:34,422
In the morning? What about now?

385
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,924
No, he'll be in bed.
You know these country people.

386
00:24:37,085 --> 00:24:41,078
Early to bed, early to rise.
He's a nice chap. He's called Norman.

387
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:43,766
Charming wife, Debbie.
Three delightful kids.

388
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:46,389
Oh, I've just remembered.
He's on vacation.

389
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,045
- He's taken the kids to Bermuda.
- What?

390
00:24:49,213 --> 00:24:51,896
So I'm stuck up here
for the rest of my life?

391
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:55,094
Have patience.
Stoicism is what's called for.

392
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,563
Works wonders. Oh, wait a minute.

393
00:24:58,108 --> 00:25:00,977
There's an emergency button
on the wall. You see it?

394
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:03,537
That's it. Just press it...

395
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,912
...and all will be well.

396
00:25:07,803 --> 00:25:09,658
There it is.

397
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:18,289
Careful. Be careful.

398
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:21,845
That's it.

399
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,682
- Careful.
- Is this as far as it will go?

400
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:27,224
Jump.

401
00:25:29,498 --> 00:25:31,767
- Oh, Christ!
- Wonderful.

402
00:25:32,538 --> 00:25:35,473
- Very, very impressed.
- I thought I was gonna die.

403
00:25:35,641 --> 00:25:37,878
- You will.
- So, what the fuck do I do now?

404
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,496
- You open the safe.
- Where is it? How do I open it?

405
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,770
Wait a minute.
You don't know where it is.

406
00:25:42,937 --> 00:25:45,108
You've got to find it,
you've got to look for it.

407
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:48,372
Where is it?
Start in the bedroom.

408
00:25:48,537 --> 00:25:50,446
- How are you feeling?
- Okay, all right.

409
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:53,104
- Excited?
- Quite, yes.

410
00:25:53,272 --> 00:25:56,119
You're a cool customer, I like that.
Okay.

411
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,167
Open the wardrobe.
Open the drawers.

412
00:25:58,327 --> 00:25:59,343
Throw things around.

413
00:25:59,512 --> 00:26:02,097
You're looking for the safe.
It's up here somewhere.

414
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:05,329
Play it for real.
Kick the place to death.

415
00:26:05,495 --> 00:26:06,924
You're a desperate man.

416
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:10,225
Safes are always kept
behind paintings, aren't they?

417
00:26:10,392 --> 00:26:11,635
What are you doing?

418
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:14,188
I'm a desperate man, aren't I?
That's what you said.

419
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,268
The man is a barbarian.

420
00:26:16,438 --> 00:26:20,268
- Where's the fucking safe?
- Well, open the chest of drawers.

421
00:26:21,655 --> 00:26:23,116
- It's locked.
- Kick it to death.

422
00:26:28,342 --> 00:26:30,611
And this is where I hear you.

423
00:26:30,774 --> 00:26:32,050
You hear me?

424
00:26:32,214 --> 00:26:36,524
Yes, I'm asleep in the study.
That's where I sleep these days.

425
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:39,595
I can't sleep in the bed
without my wife, you see.

426
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,633
I hear you, I come into the bedroom.

427
00:26:43,796 --> 00:26:45,651
And I find you.

428
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:46,826
And then?

429
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:48,883
- I attack you.
- How?

430
00:26:49,044 --> 00:26:51,914
Like this. And this.

431
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:59,023
- That hurt.
- So sorry.

432
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,921
Then, you get out your knife.

433
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:06,418
I don't have a knife.

434
00:27:08,914 --> 00:27:10,289
I do.

435
00:27:10,451 --> 00:27:12,840
- You threaten me with it.
- You're threatening me.

436
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,799
No, I'm playing you.
This is what you do.

437
00:27:14,962 --> 00:27:16,904
You want to know
where the safe is...

438
00:27:17,075 --> 00:27:20,390
...what the combination is,
so you terrorize me with this knife.

439
00:27:20,563 --> 00:27:22,350
- Take it easy.
- You can see I'm ruthless.

440
00:27:22,513 --> 00:27:24,336
I'm unpredictable.
I'm probably a killer.

441
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:28,458
And I'm certainly
very, very dangerous.

442
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:31,374
But you? You're obstinate.

443
00:27:31,536 --> 00:27:34,603
- Me or you?
- I'm you, you're me, you get it?

444
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:39,148
Now, the jewels
are worth a lot of money.

445
00:27:39,313 --> 00:27:40,557
You won't give in...

446
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:45,838
...but I get out my gun.

447
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,295
I'm still you, by the way.

448
00:27:50,608 --> 00:27:54,350
But then, to make it clear
that I mean business...

449
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:57,831
Bull's-eye.

450
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,651
Bull's-eye.

451
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,428
Finally, you give in.
You're so terrified...

452
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:09,347
...you show me where the safe is.
It is behind that.

453
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:10,501
Magic.

454
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,671
And you're so frightened,
you give me the combination.

455
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:17,699
19-11-94. Open it.

456
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:19,560
Wait a minute. Am I me now?

457
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:22,060
- Or are you me?
- No, you're now you.

458
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:23,366
- You're now you.
- Me?

459
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:25,867
- No, no.
- Or are you still me?

460
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:29,771
You're now you. And I'm now me.

461
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:32,332
Open the safe.

462
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:34,598
19-11-94.

463
00:28:36,237 --> 00:28:37,513
It was our wedding day.

464
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:43,746
The 19th of November, 1994.

465
00:28:54,028 --> 00:28:55,784
Jesus.

466
00:29:01,611 --> 00:29:03,367
What do you think?

467
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:08,703
They're quite beautiful.

468
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:10,946
Put them in your pocket.

469
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:15,203
Eight hundred
thousand pounds, eh?

470
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:18,154
That's what I said.

471
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:24,863
Okay.

472
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:30,659
So far, so good.

473
00:29:30,824 --> 00:29:33,377
Hey, you'd better give me
the address of that fence.

474
00:29:33,545 --> 00:29:35,585
- What fence?
- The fence in Amsterdam.

475
00:29:35,753 --> 00:29:37,028
Oh, that fence.

476
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:40,197
Listen, you put that gun down.

477
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,701
Why?

478
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:46,437
It's pointing directly at me.
I'm not very happy about it.

479
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,126
Why not?

480
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:52,352
- Look, is this a game?
- This is the real game.

481
00:29:55,015 --> 00:29:58,310
The real game has just begun.

482
00:29:59,206 --> 00:30:01,094
What's the real game?

483
00:30:01,254 --> 00:30:03,261
You and me.

484
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:06,978
You, defenseless. Me, with a gun.

485
00:30:08,742 --> 00:30:10,749
It's the end of the jewelry story,
you see.

486
00:30:12,517 --> 00:30:13,979
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah.

487
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:16,222
I enjoyed it, though.

488
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:17,627
I'm not enjoying this.

489
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:19,139
I don't blame you.

490
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:22,755
What's it all about?

491
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:26,877
Oh, come on. Buck your ideas up.

492
00:30:27,268 --> 00:30:31,065
You really didn't think I was gonna
let you have my wife and the jewels?

493
00:30:33,476 --> 00:30:35,331
You're joking.

494
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,658
You've been leading me
up the garden.

495
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,194
Right up.

496
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:43,362
Stand on the bed.

497
00:30:55,202 --> 00:30:56,860
Listen. Wait a minute.

498
00:30:57,027 --> 00:31:00,800
Before you do anything,
there's something I must tell you.

499
00:31:02,242 --> 00:31:04,697
- What?
- Maggie respects you.

500
00:31:04,866 --> 00:31:06,175
- Really?
- Yes.

501
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:08,443
She often says
you're a man of true integrity...

502
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,584
...that you're a really decent guy.

503
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:13,338
She's right. I'm a really decent guy.

504
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,032
- I believe it.
- She's quite right.

505
00:31:15,201 --> 00:31:17,143
I'm a really decent guy.

506
00:31:17,313 --> 00:31:18,720
I know you are. I know you are.

507
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:20,823
And that's what she often says.

508
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:22,781
You're... She admires your mind.

509
00:31:22,944 --> 00:31:25,016
- She admires my mind?
- Yes.

510
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,289
- Your mind excites her.
- Sexually?

511
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:29,660
Very. Your mind
excites your wife sexually.

512
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:31,831
- What about my body?
- What about it?

513
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:34,717
Well, what does she say
about my body?

514
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:39,422
Do you know,
I don't think she's ever mentioned it.

515
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:41,438
You're a prick.

516
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,806
- Where does my prick come into it?
- I can guess where it comes in.

517
00:31:46,975 --> 00:31:49,528
But I wasn't talking
about your prick.

518
00:31:49,758 --> 00:31:53,020
- I was calling you a prick.
- Oh, thanks.

519
00:31:53,183 --> 00:31:54,939
But you know
what you are now, though?

520
00:31:55,103 --> 00:31:56,214
What?

521
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,715
- You're a dead duck.
- Really?

522
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:02,232
This is the way
the story goes to the police.

523
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:05,211
I find you in my house,
you threaten me.

524
00:32:05,372 --> 00:32:07,063
You open the safe,
you take the jewels.

525
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:08,571
You put them in your pocket.

526
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:11,831
I manage to grab the gun
while you're looking at the jewels.

527
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,265
There's a struggle.
The gun goes off.

528
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:16,789
Suddenly, I realize you're dead.

529
00:32:16,957 --> 00:32:18,779
You're gonna shoot me.

530
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:20,631
- What do you think?
- Why?

531
00:32:20,796 --> 00:32:24,244
I planned all this from the word go.

532
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:30,075
I've always longed for
an intimate chat with a hairdresser.

533
00:32:30,235 --> 00:32:34,578
Especially a hairdresser
who is fucking my wife.

534
00:32:34,747 --> 00:32:36,088
I'm not a hairdresser!

535
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,927
My wife is mine! She belongs to me!

536
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:43,352
And I'm her husband!

537
00:32:44,315 --> 00:32:47,512
And what you've done is this.

538
00:32:48,954 --> 00:32:53,656
You've invited yourself
to attend your own death.

539
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:56,403
Please.

540
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,260
No, don't do it.
Please don't shoot me.

541
00:32:58,425 --> 00:33:02,767
Please don't shoot me, please!
I'll just get in my car and go, okay?

542
00:33:02,938 --> 00:33:04,879
That's all.
You'll never see me again.

543
00:33:05,337 --> 00:33:06,384
You're crazy.

544
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:08,854
No, you're not crazy.
You just got things wrong.

545
00:33:09,017 --> 00:33:10,959
I don't want your wife. I hate women.

546
00:33:11,128 --> 00:33:13,038
You hear me?
I hate women. I hate your wife!

547
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:15,826
You've absolutely
no reason to be jealous.

548
00:33:16,568 --> 00:33:19,884
Women are not my scene.
I'd rather do it with a dog or a goat.

549
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:23,187
Or a boy I knew at school.
His name was Dooley.

550
00:33:23,352 --> 00:33:25,653
I called him Dolores.
I hate women!

551
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:29,014
Honest. God's honor.

552
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:30,637
Do you believe in God?

553
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,578
<i>Just shut up.</i>

554
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:11,050
<i>I'm asking the questions, not you.</i>

555
00:36:11,787 --> 00:36:15,049
<i>- How long have you known him?
- I don't know him. I've never met him.</i>

556
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,903
<i>What are you? A joker?</i>

557
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,589
<i>Yes?</i>

558
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,082
<i>Andrew Wyke?</i>

559
00:37:10,248 --> 00:37:11,741
<i>Yes.</i>

560
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:14,082
<i>Detective Inspector Black.</i>

561
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:16,898
<i>New Scotland Yard. Eddie Black.</i>

562
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:20,453
<i>I'd like a word with you.</i>

563
00:37:20,966 --> 00:37:22,341
<i>A word?</i>

564
00:37:22,502 --> 00:37:24,062
<i>That's right.</i>

565
00:37:24,806 --> 00:37:26,432
<i>What about?</i>

566
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,751
<i>Can I come in?</i>

567
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:34,337
<i>Yes. Yes, of course.</i>

568
00:37:36,229 --> 00:37:37,212
<i>Like a drink?</i>

569
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:39,291
<i>Got any beer?</i>

570
00:37:39,813 --> 00:37:42,202
<i>Beer? Yes.</i>

571
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:43,682
<i>You're the writer.</i>

572
00:37:44,548 --> 00:37:46,653
You write crime books.

573
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,795
That's right.

574
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:51,103
I've read a couple.

575
00:37:51,556 --> 00:37:53,443
Right on the button.

576
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,840
Oh, that's a great compliment.

577
00:37:57,252 --> 00:37:59,805
How do you know so much about it?

578
00:37:59,972 --> 00:38:01,182
What?

579
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:02,842
Villainy.

580
00:38:03,011 --> 00:38:05,215
Crime. Horror.

581
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:08,705
Imagination.

582
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:11,610
Imagination.

583
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:13,022
Clever.

584
00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:15,041
I do my best.

585
00:38:16,034 --> 00:38:18,107
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

586
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:26,401
I see you got
a broken window up there.

587
00:38:28,129 --> 00:38:30,202
Tropical storm the other night.

588
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:32,638
Bit of a hurricane, terrifying.

589
00:38:32,801 --> 00:38:35,518
A great branch broke off a big tree...

590
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:38,102
...and flew through the air
through the skylight...

591
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:40,479
...as you can see.

592
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,884
Act of God.

593
00:38:42,048 --> 00:38:43,674
Had it in for you, did he?

594
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,662
- Who?
- God.

595
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,929
Oh, yes, he's always been
a vicious bastard.

596
00:38:48,096 --> 00:38:49,502
You know what God's trouble is?

597
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:51,518
- What?
- He has no father.

598
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:54,974
He has no family roots.
He's rootless.

599
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:58,681
Nowhere to hang his hat,
poor bugger. I pity him.

600
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:01,846
That's a very interesting
philosophical speculation.

601
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:04,665
Wait a minute.
Aren't you a well-known detective?

602
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,685
No.

603
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:10,741
Not me, mate.
You're thinking of another bloke.

604
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,456
Haven't I seen your picture
in the newspaper?

605
00:39:15,997 --> 00:39:18,300
Do you want to know
my opinion of the newspapers?

606
00:39:18,462 --> 00:39:19,955
What?

607
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:24,794
Journalists are a bunch
of prick-teasing cocksuckers.

608
00:39:25,214 --> 00:39:26,359
No.

609
00:39:26,525 --> 00:39:27,703
That's right.

610
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:30,869
I'm sorry, but isn't that
a contradiction in terms?

611
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,695
Is it?

612
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:36,120
So you're not well-known?

613
00:39:36,284 --> 00:39:38,292
No, I'm a common-or-garden copper.

614
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,972
I just catch sex criminals, perverts...

615
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,515
...homicidal maniacs.

616
00:39:43,676 --> 00:39:46,872
And what do you do with them
when you catch them?

617
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:49,622
I generally cut their balls off.

618
00:39:51,163 --> 00:39:52,887
I see.

619
00:40:00,443 --> 00:40:03,671
So how can I help you?

620
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,201
Yes, I think you can help me.
I think you can.

621
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,671
How?

622
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:09,460
I'm looking into a disappearance.

623
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:10,607
Disappearance?

624
00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:13,910
Man called Tindle. Milo Tindle.

625
00:40:14,073 --> 00:40:17,520
Sorry, I didn't get the name.
What was it?

626
00:40:17,689 --> 00:40:19,216
Tindle.

627
00:40:20,121 --> 00:40:22,543
Tindle. Tindle...

628
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:25,296
What about him?

629
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:26,807
Do you know him?

630
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:29,303
Know him? Absolutely not.

631
00:40:29,465 --> 00:40:31,188
- You mean you've never met him?
- Never.

632
00:40:31,352 --> 00:40:32,693
Never even heard of him.

633
00:40:32,856 --> 00:40:34,417
- That's funny.
- Why?

634
00:40:34,584 --> 00:40:37,267
Well, he was staying
at the Red Lion in the village...

635
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:39,188
...where he mentioned
to the landlord...

636
00:40:39,352 --> 00:40:41,326
...he was coming to see you
three nights ago.

637
00:40:41,496 --> 00:40:42,641
He hasn't been seen since.

638
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:45,458
His bag is still in his room,
shaving kit, all that.

639
00:40:45,623 --> 00:40:46,704
He was coming to see me?

640
00:40:46,871 --> 00:40:48,496
That's right.

641
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:50,070
He mentioned it to the landlord?

642
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:52,467
Why would he mention such a thing
to the landlord?

643
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,664
Well, you're a famous writer
and you're well known in the district.

644
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:57,456
So how can you help me on this?

645
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,924
No one came to see me.
I've no idea who this man is.

646
00:41:00,087 --> 00:41:03,469
And I know no one called Tindle.

647
00:41:03,637 --> 00:41:05,426
You don't, eh?

648
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:15,729
What are you? A joker?

649
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:17,322
What do you mean?

650
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:20,046
I mean you're pretty quick
on your feet.

651
00:41:20,213 --> 00:41:23,114
You should have been
a ballet dancer.

652
00:41:23,285 --> 00:41:26,417
I can just see you doing pirouettes.

653
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:30,346
- Ever worn a pair of tights?
- Not me.

654
00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:34,927
They'd suit you.

655
00:41:36,468 --> 00:41:37,646
Nice house.

656
00:41:37,812 --> 00:41:39,218
Thanks.

657
00:41:40,115 --> 00:41:42,482
- Design it yourself?
- It's 18th-century.

658
00:41:42,643 --> 00:41:45,577
No, no, I meant this. The inside.

659
00:41:45,747 --> 00:41:46,729
That was my wife.

660
00:41:46,899 --> 00:41:49,200
Oh, your wife.
Is she here, by the way?

661
00:41:49,362 --> 00:41:50,377
No.

662
00:41:50,546 --> 00:41:52,041
Popped up to London?

663
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,672
She's not here.

664
00:41:53,843 --> 00:41:56,461
She's an interior decorator, then?

665
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:58,088
Something like that.

666
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:02,767
It's a great gift, isn't it?

667
00:42:04,082 --> 00:42:06,154
You're a lucky man.

668
00:42:07,729 --> 00:42:09,552
You got an ashtray?

669
00:42:15,505 --> 00:42:17,610
I'm ready for another beer.

670
00:42:23,632 --> 00:42:25,704
A man was passing your house
three nights ago.

671
00:42:25,872 --> 00:42:28,043
He said he heard shots.

672
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:29,735
Passed my house?

673
00:42:29,904 --> 00:42:33,100
How could he do that?
It's private property.

674
00:42:33,263 --> 00:42:35,597
He were taking a shortcut.

675
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:37,069
I think he's a poacher.

676
00:42:37,232 --> 00:42:39,598
Anyway, says he heard shots.

677
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:41,516
What kind of shots?

678
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:42,661
Gunshots.

679
00:42:42,831 --> 00:42:44,522
- Fantasy.
- Really?

680
00:42:44,686 --> 00:42:46,726
Bullshit. Codswallop.

681
00:42:46,895 --> 00:42:49,578
Who is this man?
Are you sure he exists?

682
00:42:49,742 --> 00:42:51,946
Oh, he exists, all right.

683
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:53,222
By the way, cheers.

684
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,917
Cheers.

685
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,605
I do want to ask you
one more question.

686
00:43:10,413 --> 00:43:11,787
Ask.

687
00:43:11,949 --> 00:43:14,600
You do know your wife's
living in London with another man?

688
00:43:16,716 --> 00:43:18,603
That is my business.

689
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:21,415
My private life is my business.

690
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,074
Do you know the name of this man?

691
00:43:23,243 --> 00:43:25,610
Why should I answer
these questions?

692
00:43:27,403 --> 00:43:30,273
You don't have to,
but you'd be better off if you did.

693
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:37,056
I don't know the man's name.

694
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:39,239
I never asked.

695
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:44,994
So you do admit that your wife's
living in London with another man?

696
00:43:46,602 --> 00:43:49,285
Yes. Yes.

697
00:43:49,449 --> 00:43:51,075
So what?

698
00:43:52,906 --> 00:43:57,128
Well, I can tell you the man's name.

699
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:04,543
It's Tindle.

700
00:44:05,097 --> 00:44:06,504
Milo Tindle.

701
00:44:11,304 --> 00:44:13,638
- Is it?
- Yeah.

702
00:44:14,761 --> 00:44:16,965
The bloke who's disappeared.

703
00:44:17,129 --> 00:44:20,030
The bloke who said
he was coming to see you.

704
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,364
We found this note in his room.

705
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:25,284
At the pub.

706
00:44:25,895 --> 00:44:28,448
"I look forward to meeting you.

707
00:44:28,615 --> 00:44:31,648
Come to the house Friday, 6:30.

708
00:44:31,846 --> 00:44:33,439
Wyke. "

709
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,259
Is this your handwriting?

710
00:44:37,446 --> 00:44:41,024
- It is.
- Do you remember writing this note?

711
00:44:41,575 --> 00:44:42,883
How could I forget?

712
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,021
You forgot earlier.

713
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,775
You said you didn't know him.

714
00:44:47,942 --> 00:44:50,495
You said you'd never met him.

715
00:45:08,804 --> 00:45:10,233
I was lying.

716
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:18,177
Lying to the police.

717
00:45:19,172 --> 00:45:21,343
That will get you nowhere.

718
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:27,260
I don't understand you,
mate, honest.

719
00:45:27,427 --> 00:45:30,241
You're a clever man.
You write clever books.

720
00:45:30,402 --> 00:45:32,704
But you've made a balls-up
of this one, haven't you?

721
00:45:33,154 --> 00:45:34,332
Have I?

722
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:37,694
Tindle came to see you
three nights ago.

723
00:45:37,858 --> 00:45:40,192
- I knew him as Tindolini.
- Oh, I see.

724
00:45:40,354 --> 00:45:42,077
- He had an Italian father.
- Get away.

725
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:44,828
A traditional
Italian hairdressing family.

726
00:45:44,994 --> 00:45:48,289
- Is he a hairdresser himself?
- I think he is.

727
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:51,002
He didn't come all the way here
to do your hair, did he?

728
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:53,340
Not at all, not at all.

729
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:58,110
So, what did you two do
when you got together?

730
00:46:00,768 --> 00:46:02,175
We played a game.

731
00:46:02,528 --> 00:46:05,245
- A game?
- A game with a knife and a gun.

732
00:46:05,408 --> 00:46:06,870
- A lethal game?
- No.

733
00:46:07,328 --> 00:46:08,887
Just a bit of fun, that's all.

734
00:46:09,055 --> 00:46:11,390
Okay, a bit of fun.

735
00:46:11,552 --> 00:46:13,307
So he came to see you.

736
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:16,788
You played a game
with a knife and a gun.

737
00:46:16,959 --> 00:46:19,926
Three shots were fired,
then he disappeared.

738
00:46:20,095 --> 00:46:21,240
So where is he?

739
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:24,341
- Probably cuddling my wife.
- That's the one thing he's not doing.

740
00:46:24,735 --> 00:46:26,163
- How do you know?
- I've seen her.

741
00:46:26,334 --> 00:46:27,545
He was nowhere in sight.

742
00:46:29,726 --> 00:46:31,865
No. She's an anxious woman.

743
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,811
She knew he was coming
to see you, you see.

744
00:46:34,973 --> 00:46:38,356
In fact, she insisted
that he come to see you...

745
00:46:38,526 --> 00:46:40,413
...as I know you know.

746
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,621
She thinks you may have killed him.

747
00:46:46,076 --> 00:46:49,044
She thinks you're round the bend.

748
00:46:49,885 --> 00:46:52,023
She thinks
you're a very dangerous man.

749
00:46:52,189 --> 00:46:53,466
Me? She's joking.

750
00:46:55,164 --> 00:46:57,882
So tell me, between ourselves...

751
00:46:58,364 --> 00:47:00,088
...did you kill him?

752
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,667
I'll tell you exactly what I did.

753
00:47:04,828 --> 00:47:06,966
I pretended to kill him.

754
00:47:07,132 --> 00:47:11,027
I shot him with a blank.
I frightened the shit out of him.

755
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,613
Your man was right.
Your spy, whoever he was.

756
00:47:14,778 --> 00:47:16,240
There were three shots.

757
00:47:16,411 --> 00:47:19,378
The first two were real.
The third one was blank.

758
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:23,985
He was terrified.
When I shot him, he fainted.

759
00:47:24,155 --> 00:47:26,675
When he came round
I gave him a drink, pat on the bum...

760
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:31,382
...he left the house, his tail, if you
want to call it that, between his legs.

761
00:47:31,546 --> 00:47:33,073
And I haven't seen him since.

762
00:47:33,242 --> 00:47:35,762
You gave him a pat on the bum?

763
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,107
Metaphorically.

764
00:47:37,273 --> 00:47:40,175
You gave him
a metaphorical pat on the bum?

765
00:47:40,345 --> 00:47:42,003
- Sure.
- How did he take it?

766
00:47:42,169 --> 00:47:43,957
- What?
- The pat.

767
00:47:44,505 --> 00:47:48,760
He was fine. He told me that
it was game, set and match to me.

768
00:47:49,561 --> 00:47:52,430
So this guy had a sense of humor,
is that what you're saying?

769
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,318
Oh, yes. He left the house
with a twinkle in his eye.

770
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:58,513
So tell me,
what was the point of all this?

771
00:47:58,679 --> 00:47:59,694
Humiliation.

772
00:47:59,864 --> 00:48:01,521
It's nice to see your wife's lover...

773
00:48:01,688 --> 00:48:04,437
...a shivering, frightened,
fucking wreck in front of you.

774
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:06,355
As a matter of fact, I liked him.

775
00:48:06,808 --> 00:48:08,149
I thought he was attractive.

776
00:48:08,311 --> 00:48:10,220
I thought we could have
become good friends.

777
00:48:10,711 --> 00:48:15,348
The shortest way to a man's heart,
as I'm sure you know, is humiliation.

778
00:48:15,511 --> 00:48:17,877
It binds you together.

779
00:48:20,247 --> 00:48:22,930
You found him attractive?

780
00:48:23,094 --> 00:48:26,771
I put myself in my wife's shoes,
in a manner of speaking.

781
00:48:26,934 --> 00:48:30,512
I was trying to find out
what attracted her to him.

782
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:34,289
- And did you?
- Oh, yes.

783
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:37,170
He was really terribly sweet.

784
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:40,649
- I could see why she fancied him.
- I could see why he fancies her.

785
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:44,109
- Really?
- Found her very tasty myself.

786
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:46,927
- Is that so?
- Oh, yes.

787
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:49,426
Sumptuous. Ready for action.

788
00:48:51,316 --> 00:48:53,999
I mean,
I'm an experienced detective.

789
00:48:54,163 --> 00:48:57,066
So guess what I detected.

790
00:48:57,236 --> 00:48:58,413
What?

791
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:01,809
That she's in love
with her own body.

792
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,557
Makes her dizzy with excitement.

793
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,001
You detected all this
in five minutes?

794
00:49:10,164 --> 00:49:12,781
Well, 35. Perhaps even 45.

795
00:49:12,946 --> 00:49:16,655
Well, let's call it 55
or even a little bit longer.

796
00:49:17,106 --> 00:49:18,088
You stayed for tea?

797
00:49:18,258 --> 00:49:20,145
And cakes.

798
00:49:21,394 --> 00:49:22,506
Yeah.

799
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:28,649
Yeah.

800
00:49:28,817 --> 00:49:30,378
Must be funny for you to know...

801
00:49:30,545 --> 00:49:34,123
...your own wife's getting a going-over
from another man on a regular basis.

802
00:49:34,288 --> 00:49:35,663
Going-over? I don't follow.

803
00:49:35,825 --> 00:49:37,102
You don't?

804
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,758
Not a phrase I'm familiar with.

805
00:49:38,929 --> 00:49:42,157
- Means being fucked.
- You mean like in sexual intercourse?

806
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,550
Yes, the old one-two.
In like a lion, out like a lamb.

807
00:49:45,713 --> 00:49:48,233
I must say, you have
a great gift for language.

808
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,610
Did you learn it at school?

809
00:49:49,776 --> 00:49:51,499
The hard school. Family life.

810
00:49:51,696 --> 00:49:54,314
- But you keep cheerful.
- You've got it, I keep cheerful.

811
00:49:54,479 --> 00:49:56,868
I've got an optimistic nature.

812
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,461
You got to when you're a policeman.
Otherwise, you'd go mad.

813
00:49:59,631 --> 00:50:02,892
No, I'll tell you
what keeps me going.

814
00:50:04,494 --> 00:50:07,975
The chase. The thrill of the hunt
and the sudden shafts of bright light.

815
00:50:08,622 --> 00:50:13,356
For instance,
when I was talking to your wife...

816
00:50:14,189 --> 00:50:16,524
Very attractive woman.

817
00:50:18,062 --> 00:50:20,167
Wonderful legs.

818
00:50:23,629 --> 00:50:26,247
She was crossing them at the time,
I remember.

819
00:50:26,413 --> 00:50:31,747
She suddenly said
you had a murderous nature.

820
00:50:33,868 --> 00:50:36,291
Now, that really
made my nose twitch.

821
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,986
Itch?

822
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,118
Twitch, mate.

823
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,230
Twitch.

824
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:47,561
So I'm looking at you
and I'm wondering...

825
00:50:47,724 --> 00:50:49,895
...what have you done
with the body?

826
00:50:51,243 --> 00:50:52,901
Where's the body?

827
00:50:53,642 --> 00:50:55,584
Come on, I need to know.

828
00:50:56,043 --> 00:50:58,344
Where's the body?
What have you done with the body?

829
00:50:58,507 --> 00:50:59,489
There's no body.

830
00:50:59,658 --> 00:51:01,568
Don't fuck about!

831
00:51:01,738 --> 00:51:03,494
Don't bullshit me.
I won't stand for it.

832
00:51:03,658 --> 00:51:05,698
Where is it?
In the house or did you shift it?

833
00:51:05,866 --> 00:51:07,775
There is no body!

834
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:19,008
Here, look at this.
You got holes in your walls.

835
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:24,647
They're bullet holes.
Live bullet holes.

836
00:51:24,809 --> 00:51:26,849
I fired two live bullets
to set up the trick...

837
00:51:27,016 --> 00:51:28,543
...and one blank to complete it.

838
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:31,101
It was a game, I told you.
I played it to the hilt.

839
00:51:31,272 --> 00:51:33,891
It's not worth playing
unless you play it to the hilt.

840
00:51:34,056 --> 00:51:36,161
- The third shot was a blank?
- That's right.

841
00:51:36,329 --> 00:51:37,310
- What's that?
- What?

842
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,455
Blood. Dried blood!

843
00:51:39,623 --> 00:51:41,794
Some of it's not even dried.
It's still damp.

844
00:51:41,959 --> 00:51:43,748
- That's impossible.
- That's blood, chum.

845
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:45,798
- Whose blood is it?
- It's impossible.

846
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:47,389
It was a game. It was a blank.

847
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:49,926
No, it was a game
with real bullets and real blood.

848
00:51:50,087 --> 00:51:51,330
This is a carve-up.

849
00:51:51,495 --> 00:51:55,138
Let's see what else
is new around here.

850
00:51:55,686 --> 00:51:57,442
Hello, what's this?

851
00:51:58,247 --> 00:52:02,076
We've got a shirt, jacket and trousers
in the back of your cupboard.

852
00:52:02,246 --> 00:52:04,930
Very negligent of you, mate,
unless they're not yours.

853
00:52:05,094 --> 00:52:08,890
No, I don't think they're yours.
I think they belong to Tindle.

854
00:52:09,062 --> 00:52:11,713
You say he left the house
after you shot him.

855
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,700
- Yes.
- Naked?

856
00:52:13,862 --> 00:52:15,268
I don't know how those got there.

857
00:52:15,429 --> 00:52:17,731
So you made him strip
before you shot him?

858
00:52:17,894 --> 00:52:19,802
Part of the humiliation, was it?

859
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:21,435
No. The thing is this.

860
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:24,507
It might have started as a game,
but it got out of hand.

861
00:52:24,677 --> 00:52:26,914
The third shot was live!

862
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:30,392
It killed him. So where's the body?

863
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,571
I didn't kill him! He's alive!

864
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,812
Bollocks. You're a joker, all right.

865
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,442
A real joker.

866
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,335
Come on, we're off to the station.

867
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,987
- There's something very wrong here.
- Hey, dead right.

868
00:52:41,155 --> 00:52:44,318
I'll tell you what you are.
You're fucked.

869
00:52:44,772 --> 00:52:45,753
Jesus Christ.

870
00:52:45,923 --> 00:52:48,094
Don't struggle, chum.
I'll have you for breakfast.

871
00:52:48,259 --> 00:52:49,536
There's something wrong here.

872
00:52:49,698 --> 00:52:53,495
You're up shit creek, Wyke.
You're up shit creek without a paddle.

873
00:52:56,706 --> 00:53:00,056
Look at you. All aquiver.

874
00:53:00,834 --> 00:53:02,906
Who's the dead duck?

875
00:53:06,466 --> 00:53:07,839
Jesus Christ.

876
00:53:11,265 --> 00:53:14,876
You're the dead duck.

877
00:53:17,473 --> 00:53:23,037
I just sucked you in
and blew you out in little bubbles.

878
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,607
- It's you.
- It's me, all right.

879
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:27,070
You bastard. You stinking bastard.

880
00:53:27,232 --> 00:53:28,541
Just a little game, Andrew.

881
00:53:28,704 --> 00:53:30,590
- Just a little game.
- You shit.

882
00:53:30,752 --> 00:53:33,370
- I thought it might amuse you.
- You're a total shit.

883
00:53:33,536 --> 00:53:34,812
I know I am.

884
00:53:34,975 --> 00:53:38,488
- But you're also a genius.
- I know that too.

885
00:53:40,863 --> 00:53:43,067
When did you do this?
The clothes in the wardrobe?

886
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:45,751
- The blood?
- The blood belongs to a pig's liver.

887
00:53:45,919 --> 00:53:47,991
But when did you do it?
How did you do it?

888
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:51,006
I did it last night. I used that ladder.
I heard you snoring.

889
00:53:51,167 --> 00:53:54,134
Does Maggie know about this?
Your detective, was it her idea?

890
00:53:54,302 --> 00:53:56,636
- How much does she know?
- She knows nothing about it.

891
00:53:56,797 --> 00:53:59,798
Entirely my own idea.

892
00:53:59,965 --> 00:54:02,834
This is a game between us, old boy.

893
00:54:03,005 --> 00:54:05,754
Between you and me.

894
00:54:05,917 --> 00:54:08,285
Don't forget, I'm half Italian.

895
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:10,038
We go in for revenge.

896
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:26,682
After all, you frightened
the life out of me deliberately.

897
00:54:26,843 --> 00:54:29,592
You fired two live bullets
into the wall...

898
00:54:29,755 --> 00:54:33,334
...and then you pointed
the gun at me.

899
00:54:33,499 --> 00:54:35,604
And then you fired.

900
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:40,851
I don't like guns.

901
00:54:42,139 --> 00:54:43,765
They kill you.

902
00:54:46,906 --> 00:54:48,499
Okay.

903
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:51,088
So, what does this make the score?

904
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:54,032
You've had your revenge.

905
00:54:54,201 --> 00:54:58,227
So, what do you reckon?

906
00:54:58,681 --> 00:55:00,568
One set all?

907
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:03,317
No, no, you're way ahead.

908
00:55:04,089 --> 00:55:08,245
I only teased you with my inspector,
gave you a few goose pimples.

909
00:55:09,177 --> 00:55:10,704
But you frightened me to death.

910
00:55:12,857 --> 00:55:15,278
Did you really think
I was going to kill you?

911
00:55:15,448 --> 00:55:18,927
You fainted, you see.
It was a blank.

912
00:55:20,024 --> 00:55:23,023
I may be three games up
in the second set.

913
00:55:23,191 --> 00:55:24,173
If I had killed you...

914
00:55:24,343 --> 00:55:27,539
...I'd have to bury the body
in the garden or somewhere.

915
00:55:27,703 --> 00:55:28,685
Too exhausting.

916
00:55:28,855 --> 00:55:30,230
But you won the first, 6-love.

917
00:55:34,775 --> 00:55:37,196
So we're a long way
from one set all.

918
00:55:43,575 --> 00:55:46,476
By the way, I spoke to Maggie.

919
00:55:46,646 --> 00:55:49,460
I told her all about you.

920
00:55:49,621 --> 00:55:51,028
She loved it.

921
00:55:52,118 --> 00:55:53,263
Loved what?

922
00:55:53,749 --> 00:55:56,399
That I frightened the life out of you.

923
00:55:56,566 --> 00:55:57,842
That you pissed your pants.

924
00:55:59,765 --> 00:56:02,153
And that you actually fainted.

925
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:05,172
She said to me,
"You mean he actually fainted?"

926
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:07,983
I said, "Dead out,
he was scared shitless.

927
00:56:09,364 --> 00:56:10,825
Went out like a light. "

928
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:16,236
She laughed so much,
I thought she was gonna burst.

929
00:56:20,499 --> 00:56:24,274
Oh, incidentally,
she's coming back to me.

930
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:26,191
Oh, is she?

931
00:56:26,355 --> 00:56:28,013
Yes, that's right.

932
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:29,870
You know what she said about you?

933
00:56:30,035 --> 00:56:31,049
What?

934
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:32,463
She said:

935
00:56:32,627 --> 00:56:35,888
"Faint heart never won fair lady. "

936
00:56:38,257 --> 00:56:39,370
Is that a fact?

937
00:56:39,538 --> 00:56:40,782
Yeah.

938
00:56:42,546 --> 00:56:46,572
Listen, I want to
show you something.

939
00:56:47,025 --> 00:56:50,189
Go into your study and sit down.

940
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:53,798
Go into my study?

941
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:57,354
And sit down.

942
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:03,568
- What are you doing?
- It's late at night.

943
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:05,964
You're reading a book under a lamp.
Read something.

944
00:57:06,128 --> 00:57:08,583
- What's going on?
- Read a book.

945
00:57:08,752 --> 00:57:11,053
It's late at night.
You're reading a book.

946
00:57:11,215 --> 00:57:13,222
You hear something. You look up.

947
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:15,115
It's me jumping off the ladder.

948
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,840
You see me with this gun.

949
00:57:17,007 --> 00:57:20,869
You're caught like a rat in a trap.
You stare at the gun, you're paralyzed.

950
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,315
I've come for the jewels.

951
00:57:22,478 --> 00:57:24,137
- Where is the safe?
- What jewels?

952
00:57:24,302 --> 00:57:25,612
The jewels. Where's the safe?

953
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,149
- You know where it is.
- I don't.

954
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,350
- You don't?
- Don't fuck me about, I mean it.

955
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:30,980
Get up.

956
00:57:31,758 --> 00:57:34,060
You think this gun isn't real?

957
00:57:36,622 --> 00:57:38,444
Where is it?

958
00:57:39,182 --> 00:57:41,996
- Upstairs.
- Well, let's go upstairs.

959
00:57:42,669 --> 00:57:47,753
Get up these stairs
or I'll ram this gun right up your ass.

960
00:57:47,949 --> 00:57:51,112
- The safe is behind the fish tank.
- How am I gonna get to it?

961
00:57:51,276 --> 00:57:53,797
Well, you press the button
and the button moves the tank.

962
00:57:53,965 --> 00:57:56,136
Then press it.

963
00:57:56,301 --> 00:57:58,756
It's not working. It's out of ord...

964
00:58:00,107 --> 00:58:01,537
Are you a maniac? You're crazy.

965
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:04,293
- Open it.
- I changed the combination yesterday.

966
00:58:04,459 --> 00:58:06,849
- What is it?
- I forgot. I can't remember.

967
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,994
- Remember.
- It's the truth. I can't remember.

968
00:58:09,164 --> 00:58:10,178
Remember!

969
00:58:13,163 --> 00:58:14,985
What are you doing?
What are you gonna do?

970
00:58:15,147 --> 00:58:19,140
I've broken into your house because
I know you have jewels in a safe.

971
00:58:19,947 --> 00:58:22,533
I have inside information.
I want them.

972
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:25,000
Remember the combination
and open it.

973
00:58:31,882 --> 00:58:33,791
It was a blank.

974
00:58:35,337 --> 00:58:36,766
The next one's real.

975
00:58:54,536 --> 00:58:56,292
There's a good boy.

976
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:15,973
So, what are you writing
at the moment?

977
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,336
What am I writing?

978
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:24,765
Yes, I'm very interested in literature.

979
00:59:29,062 --> 00:59:31,615
Do you mind if I have a drink?

980
00:59:31,782 --> 00:59:35,262
Sure. It's your house.

981
00:59:35,622 --> 00:59:39,648
I'm always interested
in the people I rob.

982
00:59:39,845 --> 00:59:43,673
Like I'm always interested
in the husbands of the wives I fuck.

983
00:59:45,221 --> 00:59:46,879
Are you really?

984
00:59:47,588 --> 00:59:49,181
Well, well.

985
00:59:50,308 --> 00:59:51,835
Cheers.

986
00:59:58,116 --> 01:00:02,458
So, what are you writing?

987
01:00:07,011 --> 01:00:10,525
It's the story of a pathological killer.

988
01:00:10,691 --> 01:00:13,658
<i>- I call it The Smiling Man.
- Does he come to a bad end?</i>

989
01:00:13,827 --> 01:00:16,608
He dies during the act of love.
Like countless others.

990
01:00:16,769 --> 01:00:17,948
Countless others, eh?

991
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,448
I can see you've researched
the subject thoroughly.

992
01:00:21,473 --> 01:00:24,735
- What subject?
- Death in orgasm.

993
01:00:24,897 --> 01:00:28,541
Isn't that a beautiful notion?
To die in the arms of your beloved.

994
01:00:28,705 --> 01:00:32,218
Can you imagine
anything more poignant?

995
01:00:32,384 --> 01:00:34,457
- I can't, no.
- No.

996
01:00:34,624 --> 01:00:38,814
- You're a married man, aren't you?
- Yeah, been married 13 years.

997
01:00:38,976 --> 01:00:40,187
It was love at first sight.

998
01:00:40,353 --> 01:00:41,662
- Very moving.
- Yeah.

999
01:00:41,824 --> 01:00:43,929
And we're still in love.
Like two peas in a pod.

1000
01:00:44,096 --> 01:00:46,583
Someone told me
your wife has a lover.

1001
01:00:46,752 --> 01:00:48,694
- She has, yeah.
- Do you know him?

1002
01:00:48,864 --> 01:00:51,613
No, I've never met him.
He's some sort of Italian.

1003
01:00:51,775 --> 01:00:54,011
Called Tandoori or something.

1004
01:00:54,175 --> 01:00:56,117
One of the Bombay Tandooris?

1005
01:00:56,287 --> 01:00:58,196
You've got it, yeah.

1006
01:00:58,367 --> 01:01:01,116
You know something? I've never met
an artistic burglar before.

1007
01:01:01,279 --> 01:01:03,285
That's fantastic.

1008
01:01:04,479 --> 01:01:06,301
- What's your background?
- Me?

1009
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:08,797
- You.
- Irish. Connemara.

1010
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:11,063
Spanish descent.
By way of Uganda.

1011
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:12,855
My grandparents were slaves.

1012
01:01:13,022 --> 01:01:15,924
My mother was a dark-eyed,
dusky beauty.

1013
01:01:16,093 --> 01:01:19,607
- Were you breastfed?
- Oh, sure, like a baby.

1014
01:01:21,182 --> 01:01:26,582
Shall I tell you what I want you to do
with these jewels?

1015
01:01:27,452 --> 01:01:28,914
What?

1016
01:01:40,795 --> 01:01:45,847
You look so charming.

1017
01:01:52,059 --> 01:01:53,520
How do you want it?

1018
01:01:53,691 --> 01:01:55,218
Like this?

1019
01:01:55,387 --> 01:01:57,655
Or shorter?

1020
01:01:58,683 --> 01:02:02,773
How about this?
Or even shorter like a halter?

1021
01:02:02,938 --> 01:02:06,287
- You're hurting me.
- Oh, am I hurting you?

1022
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:10,004
- Yes. Don't hurt me.
- Are you sensitive to pain?

1023
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,243
Very. Very.

1024
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:14,864
I wouldn't want to hurt you,
sweetheart.

1025
01:02:15,034 --> 01:02:17,423
You're too much fun.

1026
01:02:17,593 --> 01:02:21,270
- Am I really?
- Oh, yes. You're wicked.

1027
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:24,248
I like that. Yeah.

1028
01:02:25,369 --> 01:02:27,343
Do you know something?

1029
01:02:28,473 --> 01:02:31,472
I don't think
these earrings really suit me.

1030
01:02:33,336 --> 01:02:36,336
You're right. Take them off.

1031
01:02:40,151 --> 01:02:41,809
I don't...

1032
01:02:41,975 --> 01:02:46,448
I don't think this bracelet
is really my style either.

1033
01:02:48,183 --> 01:02:50,572
But the necklace is nice.

1034
01:02:51,895 --> 01:02:52,975
I'm not totally sure.

1035
01:02:53,142 --> 01:02:57,844
Listen, you can play with these jewels
until the cows come home.

1036
01:02:58,006 --> 01:03:02,316
They're yours.
Do what you like with them.

1037
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:07,790
But I thought you'd just stolen them.

1038
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:10,324
No, no! It was a game!

1039
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:15,307
It was just a game!
I thought it might amuse you.

1040
01:03:31,764 --> 01:03:33,193
Well...

1041
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:38,221
Aren't you the wicked one?

1042
01:03:45,331 --> 01:03:46,574
You remember what I said?

1043
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:51,408
You won the first set, 6-love.
I was 3-love up in the second.

1044
01:03:51,571 --> 01:03:55,826
Well, now it's one set all.

1045
01:04:05,554 --> 01:04:08,935
But who's going to win the third set?

1046
01:04:11,057 --> 01:04:13,064
Remains to be seen.

1047
01:04:31,184 --> 01:04:32,525
You like games, don't you?

1048
01:04:33,775 --> 01:04:36,142
Some. Not all.

1049
01:04:36,303 --> 01:04:38,724
But you like being in charge...

1050
01:04:38,895 --> 01:04:40,586
...of the game?

1051
01:04:41,903 --> 01:04:44,139
Oh, yes. Sure.

1052
01:04:45,774 --> 01:04:48,676
I like a man who wants
to be in charge of things.

1053
01:04:48,878 --> 01:04:51,431
- Do you?
- Yes, I do.

1054
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:54,855
Listen, you've met my wife, I think.

1055
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:59,819
I have met her. Yes.

1056
01:05:00,014 --> 01:05:02,730
- Did she say if she had a husband?
- Yes.

1057
01:05:02,893 --> 01:05:05,413
Yeah, she said she had a husband.

1058
01:05:06,189 --> 01:05:08,742
How did she describe him?

1059
01:05:10,637 --> 01:05:12,971
Remote. Cold.

1060
01:05:13,133 --> 01:05:15,914
Malevolent. Spiteful.

1061
01:05:16,364 --> 01:05:18,884
Arrogant. Ruthless.

1062
01:05:19,052 --> 01:05:20,808
Jealous. Paranoid.

1063
01:05:20,972 --> 01:05:24,681
Criminal tendencies.
Mentally unsound.

1064
01:05:24,876 --> 01:05:26,249
That's me, all right.

1065
01:05:30,443 --> 01:05:32,777
You know something?
I like your mind.

1066
01:05:33,451 --> 01:05:35,491
- Do you really?
- It excites me.

1067
01:05:35,883 --> 01:05:37,672
I like the way you go about things.

1068
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:42,599
You mean you like my style?

1069
01:05:42,763 --> 01:05:44,867
Oh, I like your style.

1070
01:05:45,034 --> 01:05:47,456
I like it very much.

1071
01:05:48,522 --> 01:05:52,067
Look, I want to
make you a proposition.

1072
01:05:53,002 --> 01:05:54,430
What?

1073
01:05:56,681 --> 01:05:58,688
I want to show you something.

1074
01:06:02,761 --> 01:06:06,405
- Can't you put that gun down now?
- No.

1075
01:06:06,569 --> 01:06:09,568
God, you're so strong, so ruthless,
aren't you?

1076
01:06:09,736 --> 01:06:10,719
Yes.

1077
01:06:10,888 --> 01:06:13,539
Have you any idea
what my proposition is going to be?

1078
01:06:13,705 --> 01:06:15,974
- No.
- Are you excited?

1079
01:06:16,136 --> 01:06:17,216
I'd say intrigued.

1080
01:06:17,385 --> 01:06:20,002
I think you're going to be excited
very much.

1081
01:06:20,168 --> 01:06:23,429
This is the guest suite.

1082
01:06:24,999 --> 01:06:28,261
Isn't it nice? Look at the view.

1083
01:06:29,255 --> 01:06:31,295
There's a private bathroom.
A small fridge.

1084
01:06:31,463 --> 01:06:36,448
A bottle of Chilean Chardonnay
is chilling in there at this very moment.

1085
01:06:37,799 --> 01:06:40,482
This suite is uninhabited.

1086
01:06:41,895 --> 01:06:43,421
It has no occupant.

1087
01:06:48,966 --> 01:06:50,624
How would you like it?

1088
01:06:53,925 --> 01:06:55,169
Me?

1089
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:58,723
Yes, yes.

1090
01:06:58,884 --> 01:07:03,489
I think I've come to the conclusion
that you're my kind of person.

1091
01:07:06,372 --> 01:07:07,833
Am I, now?

1092
01:07:08,388 --> 01:07:10,843
Well, I told you.
I liked your mind. It excited me.

1093
01:07:11,012 --> 01:07:14,721
I need intellectual excitement.

1094
01:07:14,884 --> 01:07:17,088
Intellectual stimulation.

1095
01:07:19,012 --> 01:07:20,833
Well, they don't grow on trees.

1096
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:23,742
I'm a rich man.

1097
01:07:23,907 --> 01:07:25,882
What do you want to do?

1098
01:07:26,052 --> 01:07:28,572
I can subsidize anything you want.

1099
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:32,157
You want to open a bookshop
in the village?

1100
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:36,410
An art gallery?
Or, of course, a little theater.

1101
01:07:36,834 --> 01:07:37,946
You're a wonderful actor.

1102
01:07:38,114 --> 01:07:41,911
You could choose all the plays
and play all the leading parts.

1103
01:07:43,362 --> 01:07:47,485
But this would be your home.

1104
01:07:51,936 --> 01:07:54,490
And this would be your bedroom.

1105
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:02,427
You're asking me to live here?

1106
01:08:04,097 --> 01:08:07,391
Yes, I'm asking you to stay with me.

1107
01:08:08,064 --> 01:08:12,188
Oh, we would also travel.
I mean, Jamaica, Swiss Alps.

1108
01:08:12,352 --> 01:08:14,239
I bet you're a wonderful skier,
aren't you?

1109
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,407
You could ski
to your heart's content.

1110
01:08:16,576 --> 01:08:18,364
Swim in the blue Caribbean.

1111
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:22,332
I'd be waiting at our table
with a Scotch on the rocks.

1112
01:08:22,494 --> 01:08:24,534
Or a chilled Chilean Chardonnay.

1113
01:08:27,294 --> 01:08:29,017
The world would be your oyster.

1114
01:08:31,614 --> 01:08:33,883
But what about Maggie?

1115
01:08:35,518 --> 01:08:37,274
Forget her.

1116
01:08:37,438 --> 01:08:39,380
Let her rot.

1117
01:08:40,093 --> 01:08:41,620
Stay with me.

1118
01:08:41,789 --> 01:08:43,960
You're my kind of person.

1119
01:08:51,677 --> 01:08:53,946
It's quite tempting.

1120
01:09:03,867 --> 01:09:05,875
Hello?

1121
01:09:06,043 --> 01:09:07,505
Hi.

1122
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,127
It's going okay.

1123
01:09:14,043 --> 01:09:16,083
We're still talking.

1124
01:09:17,339 --> 01:09:20,306
We're on the right track.
It's all going okay.

1125
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:23,153
Don't come down.

1126
01:09:23,322 --> 01:09:26,169
That would be a mistake.
It's all going fine.

1127
01:09:28,154 --> 01:09:30,042
I love you too.

1128
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:32,944
I am.

1129
01:09:33,626 --> 01:09:35,512
I'm kissing you.

1130
01:09:36,538 --> 01:09:38,360
Oh, yes.

1131
01:09:39,193 --> 01:09:41,527
I can taste your mouth.

1132
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,408
What the hell did she want?

1133
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,059
She wants that divorce.

1134
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:54,798
What about my proposition?

1135
01:09:58,648 --> 01:10:01,103
Well, I like the idea of Jamaica.

1136
01:10:01,271 --> 01:10:04,588
- What about Barbados?
- Well, and Barbados, and Antigua.

1137
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,181
Yeah, it's true. There's so many
places I haven't seen.

1138
01:10:07,351 --> 01:10:10,166
Hollywood. Saint Petersburg.

1139
01:10:10,327 --> 01:10:12,693
The Cte d'Azur, Coney Island.

1140
01:10:12,855 --> 01:10:16,499
And I hear there's that wonderful hotel
in Scotland called Balmoral.

1141
01:10:16,663 --> 01:10:19,379
- That's where the queen lives.
- So bed and breakfast is out.

1142
01:10:19,542 --> 01:10:21,876
- It's on if you know the queen.
- I don't.

1143
01:10:22,037 --> 01:10:23,282
I do.

1144
01:10:23,957 --> 01:10:25,484
That's fantastic.

1145
01:10:28,118 --> 01:10:29,906
But seriously, though.

1146
01:10:30,069 --> 01:10:32,491
We could have
such a wonderful time together.

1147
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:34,068
Venice? Disneyland?

1148
01:10:34,773 --> 01:10:37,140
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.

1149
01:10:37,301 --> 01:10:38,283
Whoever you want.

1150
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,617
I could introduce you
to whoever you want.

1151
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:44,235
Kissinger? Dick Cheney?

1152
01:10:44,405 --> 01:10:45,550
Madonna? Mike Tyson?

1153
01:10:45,717 --> 01:10:46,699
- Yes.
- Yes?

1154
01:10:47,572 --> 01:10:51,631
I must say, that as offers go...

1155
01:10:52,788 --> 01:10:55,690
...it's quite tempting.

1156
01:10:58,196 --> 01:11:00,913
You're a naughty tempter,
aren't you?

1157
01:11:02,803 --> 01:11:07,025
I'm so glad you like my mind.
Not many people like my mind.

1158
01:11:07,187 --> 01:11:09,129
Quite a few people like my body...

1159
01:11:09,299 --> 01:11:11,754
...but I can't think of anyone
who likes my mind.

1160
01:11:13,011 --> 01:11:15,465
That makes you unique.

1161
01:11:16,274 --> 01:11:18,762
But then, of course,
you know what they say.

1162
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:20,839
The mind is the body.

1163
01:11:21,843 --> 01:11:22,857
Is that what they say?

1164
01:11:23,026 --> 01:11:26,156
Somebody said something like it once.
Bullshit, of course. Anyway...

1165
01:11:27,057 --> 01:11:30,537
Perhaps I am your sort of person.
Who knows?

1166
01:11:31,953 --> 01:11:36,262
But you would have
to be very nice to me.

1167
01:11:36,464 --> 01:11:40,327
For instance,
just at this moment, I need a drink.

1168
01:11:50,287 --> 01:11:52,196
You can get your own drink.

1169
01:11:52,367 --> 01:11:55,237
No, you get it for me
and I might be nice to you.

1170
01:11:55,407 --> 01:11:57,579
- Nice to me?
- That's what I said.

1171
01:11:57,743 --> 01:11:58,921
Whisky, please.

1172
01:12:17,294 --> 01:12:21,286
Can't deny, I can be
quite a congenial companion.

1173
01:12:21,454 --> 01:12:23,363
I really... I can't deny it.

1174
01:12:26,094 --> 01:12:32,290
I could be quite a witty companion.

1175
01:12:33,197 --> 01:12:37,931
Would you like a witty companion?

1176
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:42,728
- Very much.
- I'm particularly witty in the morning.

1177
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:44,102
Would that suit you?

1178
01:12:45,259 --> 01:12:50,594
Some people hate wit in the morning.
What about you?

1179
01:12:50,763 --> 01:12:52,169
I love wit in the morning.

1180
01:12:53,963 --> 01:12:55,785
Over boiled eggs?

1181
01:12:58,219 --> 01:12:59,593
Do you like eggs?

1182
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:01,152
Absolutely.

1183
01:13:06,155 --> 01:13:08,642
I'm a dab hand in the kitchen.

1184
01:13:09,194 --> 01:13:15,107
But you have to be nice to me
and get me a drink when I ask for it.

1185
01:13:36,937 --> 01:13:38,496
You see?

1186
01:13:39,879 --> 01:13:42,912
You can be really sweet...

1187
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:45,184
...when you put your mind to it.

1188
01:13:45,351 --> 01:13:46,944
Cheers.

1189
01:13:51,974 --> 01:13:54,757
Listen, I can see what you're saying.

1190
01:13:54,919 --> 01:13:58,115
I can see why
you're inviting me to live with you.

1191
01:13:58,278 --> 01:14:00,645
I can see that you're lonely.

1192
01:14:00,806 --> 01:14:04,122
That you need looking after.
It's obvious.

1193
01:14:04,294 --> 01:14:08,069
You need someone
who would cater for your every whim.

1194
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:10,084
Don't you?

1195
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:11,674
I do.

1196
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:21,341
Hello? Darling.

1197
01:14:21,508 --> 01:14:22,882
What?

1198
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:27,195
Oh, is that so?

1199
01:14:27,364 --> 01:14:28,770
Are you?

1200
01:14:31,684 --> 01:14:33,593
I see.

1201
01:14:33,764 --> 01:14:35,389
Are you sure?

1202
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:37,050
I see.

1203
01:14:37,731 --> 01:14:39,422
I got it.

1204
01:14:41,444 --> 01:14:44,345
I told you I got it. I understand.

1205
01:14:45,188 --> 01:14:46,681
Okay.

1206
01:14:47,459 --> 01:14:50,775
- Okay, I'll tell him.
- Tell me what?

1207
01:14:54,275 --> 01:14:57,569
- That she loves you.
- Is that so?

1208
01:14:57,729 --> 01:15:00,249
- What else did she say?
- Nothing.

1209
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:01,595
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

1210
01:15:01,762 --> 01:15:05,145
Listen, for chrissake,
make up your mind.

1211
01:15:05,313 --> 01:15:09,470
I'm offering you something special.
Something very special.

1212
01:15:09,634 --> 01:15:13,245
We seal it with a handshake.
And she's nowhere.

1213
01:15:13,408 --> 01:15:16,987
We cut her out, you understand?
We cut her out of our lives.

1214
01:15:17,153 --> 01:15:19,258
Don't let her dominate you.
Be yourself.

1215
01:15:19,424 --> 01:15:22,010
- Be independent. Be free.
- Like you?

1216
01:15:22,176 --> 01:15:24,795
That's right. Be free like me.

1217
01:15:59,581 --> 01:16:03,443
I've always been attracted...

1218
01:16:03,613 --> 01:16:06,329
...to rich and powerful men.

1219
01:16:06,749 --> 01:16:09,498
Rich and powerful men
make all the girls quiver...

1220
01:16:09,661 --> 01:16:12,443
...like a jelly on a plate.

1221
01:16:12,604 --> 01:16:13,881
But you're not a girl.

1222
01:16:15,484 --> 01:16:19,575
Tickles the old cobblers, money.

1223
01:16:19,739 --> 01:16:23,668
- Girls don't have cobblers.
- You'd be surprised.

1224
01:16:28,539 --> 01:16:30,448
But you're not a girl.

1225
01:16:31,324 --> 01:16:33,396
I may be once.

1226
01:16:34,235 --> 01:16:36,601
Back in the good old days.

1227
01:16:38,203 --> 01:16:40,821
Maybe the good old days
are coming back.

1228
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:43,664
Who knows?

1229
01:16:44,698 --> 01:16:46,388
Look...

1230
01:16:48,986 --> 01:16:51,855
I'd really like to see your bed.

1231
01:16:52,697 --> 01:16:56,080
I mean, let me be quite clear.

1232
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:59,992
This looks a very nice bed indeed.

1233
01:17:00,889 --> 01:17:03,377
But yours is bigger.

1234
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,816
- Can I take another look?
- Sure.

1235
01:17:10,937 --> 01:17:12,943
Is this how you do it?

1236
01:17:18,872 --> 01:17:20,814
Miraculous.

1237
01:17:31,223 --> 01:17:33,873
I could really get to like this.

1238
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:38,992
Of course,
this is the marriage bed, isn't it?

1239
01:17:40,118 --> 01:17:42,703
Is this where she took
your virginity?

1240
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:45,106
Is this where your wife
deflowered you?

1241
01:17:45,269 --> 01:17:47,822
Is this where you were deflowered?

1242
01:17:49,654 --> 01:17:51,541
It's a lovely bed.

1243
01:17:52,341 --> 01:17:55,276
So bouncy.

1244
01:18:00,757 --> 01:18:06,125
I'm so touched that you've
offered me a place in your heart.

1245
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:08,561
In your life.

1246
01:18:08,724 --> 01:18:10,579
I'm touched.

1247
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:23,466
Take your hand off me.

1248
01:18:25,778 --> 01:18:28,113
Take your hand off me.

1249
01:18:30,451 --> 01:18:33,101
Fuck off. Fuck off, you big poof!

1250
01:18:33,522 --> 01:18:36,783
Jesus. I come here
as an innocent bystander.

1251
01:18:36,946 --> 01:18:39,466
As a totally respectable individual.

1252
01:18:39,634 --> 01:18:43,081
A humble part-time hairdresser.
And you try to corrupt me.

1253
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:46,032
You try to seduce me.
Do you know what you are?

1254
01:18:46,193 --> 01:18:47,175
You're a menace.

1255
01:18:47,345 --> 01:18:51,055
Also, you're a cunt.

1256
01:18:51,856 --> 01:18:55,566
Well, now you really are charming.

1257
01:18:55,729 --> 01:18:57,965
- Know who's gonna love this story?
- What story?

1258
01:18:58,128 --> 01:18:59,623
- This one. This one.
- Who?

1259
01:18:59,825 --> 01:19:01,133
- Maggie.
- Really?

1260
01:19:01,456 --> 01:19:03,496
By the way, she asked me
to tell you something.

1261
01:19:03,665 --> 01:19:05,420
- What?
- That she's coming back to you.

1262
01:19:05,968 --> 01:19:09,197
- She's on her way.
- She's coming back to me?

1263
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:11,725
- That's what she told me.
- I don't want her.

1264
01:19:11,887 --> 01:19:14,571
Well, you've got her. She's all yours.
You're welcome to her.

1265
01:19:14,735 --> 01:19:18,892
She loves your money, baby.
That's the nub of it.

1266
01:19:19,759 --> 01:19:21,221
I don't want her.

1267
01:19:26,894 --> 01:19:29,196
- What are you doing with that coat?
- I'm taking it.

1268
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,113
Tell Maggie I'll be in touch.

1269
01:19:31,278 --> 01:19:34,179
I want to have a drink with her.
Bring her up to date.

1270
01:19:36,269 --> 01:19:40,197
How do you like me in this coat?
Do you fancy me?

1271
01:19:43,853 --> 01:19:46,504
Goodbye, darling.

1272
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:52,453
Wait a minute.

1273
01:19:53,644 --> 01:19:55,499
Yes? What?

1274
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:04,553
Goodbye, darling.
