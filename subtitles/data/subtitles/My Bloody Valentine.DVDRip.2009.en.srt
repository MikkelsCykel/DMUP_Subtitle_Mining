<i>Listen! We're not sure</i>
<i>what caused the collapse.</i>

2
00:00:33,264 --> 00:00:36,392
<i>Our boys were working the north end</i>
<i>of Tunnel 5 when she gave.</i>

3
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:39,561
<i>But I can assure you,</i>
<i>we here at the Hanniger Mines</i>

4
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,969
<i>are doing everything</i>
<i>in our power to get them out alive.</i>

5
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:46,202
<i>Calm down, folks!</i>

6
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,301
<i>It's a routine questioning.</i>

7
00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:50,846
<i>Tom was the last man</i>
<i>to leave the mine that night.</i>

8
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:54,111
<i>Maybe he could shine</i>
<i>a light on the situation.</i>

9
00:00:54,218 --> 00:00:56,345
<i>Tom Hanniger is responsible</i>
<i>for the collapse,</i>

10
00:00:56,454 --> 00:00:58,285
<i>but it was an accident.</i>

11
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:01,825
<i>And that's the thing we have to remember.</i>
<i>It was an accident.</i>

12
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:03,154
<i>This morning, at around 5 a.m.,</i>

13
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:06,059
<i>we recovered five bodies</i>
<i>and one survivor.</i>

14
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:08,758
<i>Harry Warden was the only survivor.</i>

15
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:12,768
<i>When he arrived at the county hospital,</i>
<i>he was delusional, violent...</i>

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,168
<i>The five miners that died were all killed</i>

17
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:18,606
<i>by the blunt force of</i>
<i>a pickaxe, not the cave-in.</i>

18
00:01:20,711 --> 00:01:23,236
<i>It was no accident killed those men.</i>

19
00:01:23,347 --> 00:01:25,008
<i>It was Harry Warden.</i>

20
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:27,676
<i>He murdered those miners</i>
<i>buried alive with him</i>

21
00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:29,912
<i>to conserve his own goddamn air.</i>

22
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:34,287
<i>Evidence suggests</i>
<i>Harry killed each of them with a pickaxe.</i>

23
00:01:34,392 --> 00:01:35,984
<i>Blood was found</i>
<i>on Harry Warden's pickaxe.</i>

24
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:37,321
<i>Look, chances are very slim</i>

25
00:01:37,428 --> 00:01:39,419
<i>that Warden will ever</i>
<i>come out of his coma.</i>

26
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,363
<i>Let's hope God doesn't waste any miracles</i>
<i>on Harry Warden.</i>

27
00:02:08,092 --> 00:02:10,458
We'll rescue Trainor down below.

28
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:12,153
You, venom, and methane in 5, right?

29
00:02:12,263 --> 00:02:13,594
I know my job, Harry.

30
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:15,325
Like fuck you do, Hanniger.

31
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:18,766
Just 'cause your daddy owns the mine
doesn't mean you know shit.

32
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:21,029
- You hear that?
- Oh, my God!

33
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:23,402
Damn kids! Everyone out now!

34
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,832
Happy fucking Valentine's Day.

35
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:35,569
Sheriff Burke.

36
00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:37,163
Over here.

37
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,745
Think I waited too long to retire.

38
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:51,378
You and me both, Hinch.

39
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:52,387
Who did this?

40
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,185
Harry Warden.

41
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,925
Harry Warden's in a coma.

42
00:04:58,028 --> 00:04:59,757
Guess he woke up.

43
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:06,635
Where the hell is he headed?

44
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:25,384
Come on, Irene.

45
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:26,786
Everybody's already moving underground.

46
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,654
Don't you think it's
about time we joined them?

47
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:32,554
I told you I gotta wait for Sarah and Tom.

48
00:05:32,663 --> 00:05:34,688
I promised.

49
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,289
Christ.

50
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,095
Hasn't she broken up
with that loser yet?

51
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:42,161
Sorry to tell you, sweetie,
but Tom's the love of her life.

52
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:45,504
Yeah, whatever. If that pussy
has the balls to show up here again,

53
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:48,601
- I will personally kick his ass.
- Yeah, right.

54
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:11,790
Hey, guys.

55
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:13,062
Thanks for waiting.

56
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,831
Yeah, Axel was just
about ready to give up,

57
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:15,667
but I knew you would come!

58
00:06:15,773 --> 00:06:18,674
- Axel. Hey.
- Hey, Sarah.

59
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:20,903
Okay, so before we go in... snapshot.

60
00:06:21,011 --> 00:06:22,808
No. I don't think so.

61
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:24,244
- Come on.
- Come on.

62
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:25,315
- Sure?
- Yeah.

63
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,043
Because you guys
look so cute together.

64
00:06:28,552 --> 00:06:30,520
Okay. Say "Over-the-pants hand job."

65
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:34,681
You guys want one?

66
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:35,952
No, we're good. Come on.

67
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,958
Let's go.

68
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:38,028
All right.

69
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:40,494
Okay?

70
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:46,996
- You ready to party?
- Oh, yeah.

71
00:06:50,741 --> 00:06:52,834
Hey. Hey.

72
00:06:52,943 --> 00:06:55,741
We don't have to go in there,
Tom, if you don't want to go.

73
00:06:55,846 --> 00:06:58,440
I can't believe you wouldn't
take a picture of us.

74
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:00,642
- Just stop, all right?
- What, stop? What do you mean?

75
00:07:00,751 --> 00:07:02,218
It's not like I won't
take a picture with you.

76
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,014
I just won't take a picture
with that asshole.

77
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:05,088
What's up, Bruce?

78
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:06,656
What? What is it about Tom...

79
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:10,088
That's what you get.

80
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:11,991
It's fine.

81
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:13,586
It's fine. Everybody's here.

82
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:14,721
You wanted to be here.

83
00:07:14,832 --> 00:07:17,494
Do you want to be here?

84
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,034
Yeah. Yes.

85
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,159
Sure?

86
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:22,296
Yes.

87
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,106
I love you.

88
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:26,369
I love you, too.

89
00:07:31,148 --> 00:07:33,776
I left the beer in the car.
Here. Take this.

90
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:36,580
- I'll go up and catch up with you.
- Want me to go?

91
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,177
No.

92
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:39,256
Go ahead.

93
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:45,994
Hey, guys!

94
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:54,394
- Don't be afraid.
- Don't get lost.

95
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,030
Axel?

96
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:02,136
Irene?

97
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:05,779
Where are you guys?

98
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:37,739
Oh, God.

99
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:43,919
What, you think I was
Harry Warden or something?

100
00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:45,045
Hey, Michael! Check this out...

101
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:05,094
Hello?

102
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,941
Jason?

103
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,911
Jason, is that you?

104
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:22,213
Come on, dude! You're scaring me!

105
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:27,316
Come on.

106
00:10:27,424 --> 00:10:28,857
Okay.

107
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,256
I'm out of here.

108
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:14,868
Fuck you! Fuck you! Do you hear me?

109
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:47,134
- Sarah!
- They're dead!

110
00:11:47,237 --> 00:11:48,226
They're all dead!

111
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:49,930
Come on! Come on! Come on!

112
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,132
Let's go! Hurry up!

113
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:52,208
Come on!

114
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:59,176
Sarah! Faster! Faster!

115
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:02,779
Come on! Come on! Come on!

116
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:05,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

117
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:07,056
- Don't leave him!
- Come on.

118
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,265
- No! No!
- Come back!

119
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,010
No. No. N...

120
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:47,451
Stay down, Harry.

121
00:13:54,264 --> 00:13:56,630
Stay down, Harry!

122
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:24,093
Tom?

123
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:27,793
Tom. You all right?

124
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:29,559
Hey, Sheriff! Come on!

125
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:32,966
Stay with him.

126
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:36,028
Let's go, idiot.

127
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:54,354
<i>Hard to believe.</i>

128
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,393
<i>Harmony, this small-town slice</i>
<i>of Norman Rockwell,</i>

129
00:14:57,494 --> 00:14:59,462
<i>is the murder capital of America.</i>

130
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:01,588
<i>The Valentine's Day</i>
<i>celebration approaches,</i>

131
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:03,029
<i>and it's been nearly 10 years</i>

132
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:06,432
<i>since this God-fearing community</i>
<i>was shaken to its core</i>

133
00:15:06,536 --> 00:15:09,903
<i>when local miner Harry Warden</i>
<i>went on a killing spree,</i>

134
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:12,771
<i>taking the lives of 22 men,</i>
<i>women, and children</i>

135
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:16,642
<i>before being buried alive in</i>
<i>the very mine he once worked.</i>

136
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:19,341
<i>But after a decade,</i>
<i>have the residents of Harmony</i>

137
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:21,474
<i>been able to recover from the trauma?</i>

138
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:25,077
<i>I'm here with County Sheriff Axel Palmer,</i>
<i>who has this to say.</i>

139
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:27,247
<i>What happened was a long time ago.</i>

140
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:29,154
<i>We're all just trying to move on.</i>

141
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:31,454
<i>Sheriff, do you ever worry</i>
<i>that these horrific events</i>

142
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:33,461
<i>might repeat themselves?</i>

143
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:37,260
<i>Well, I know you in the media</i>
<i>would just love that to happen.</i>

144
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,460
<i>You know, why don't you people just stop</i>
<i>coming back here every year,</i>

145
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:40,729
<i>hoping for some kind of...</i>

146
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:42,464
<i>some kind of fucking horror show,</i>

147
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:44,563
<i>to mark the stupidest [bleep]ing holiday</i>

148
00:15:44,674 --> 00:15:46,938
<i>a greeting card company ever invented?</i>

149
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:50,810
Eloquent, Sheriff. You make us look
like an inbred mining community.

150
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:54,040
We are an inbred mining
community, Ben.

151
00:15:54,151 --> 00:15:56,984
So you got any coffee in this joint?

152
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:58,111
What's so funny?

153
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:01,622
Your boss. County Sheriff Axel Palmer.

154
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:04,285
If only your old man could see you now.

155
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:05,986
I don't know.

156
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:08,826
That's one intensely good-looking
son of a bitch, if you ask me.

157
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:10,058
I should have my own reality show.

158
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,566
Yeah, I'm sure your exploits

159
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:14,398
arresting hardened bicycle thieves
would be a big hit.

160
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:16,062
- Yeah.
- Hey, Sarah.

161
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:19,165
Hey, sweetie. Hey, don't forget
to pick up Noah's soccer gear tonight.

162
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:21,039
Yeah. I'll take care of it.

163
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,404
Hey, you missed me on TV.

164
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:27,881
Oh, yes! That's right! How was he?

165
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:30,043
When you gonna dump this bum
and run away with me?

166
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:31,620
I get off work at 8.

167
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:34,815
Well, I'll be sure to tuck the top down
on my Cadillac.

168
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:37,485
Ben. Come on. I'm sitting right here.

169
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:48,201
Sarah? I've got a doctor's appointment.

170
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:50,068
Is it okay if I come in late today?

171
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:51,834
Yeah. Get there when you can.

172
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:06,054
Well, gentlemen,
I got some Huffy vans to track down.

173
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:08,556
You want me to come with?

174
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:11,286
No. No, you can hang tight, Martin.
Finish your coffee.

175
00:17:11,394 --> 00:17:13,225
I'll call you if I need backup.

176
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:33,041
This place gives me the creeps.

177
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,209
Can we meet in a motel next time?

178
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:36,979
Yeah, that's a great idea.

179
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:39,521
We'll just pull up and check in.

180
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:47,928
I don't think anybody would notice
a sheriff's car parked out front.

181
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,999
Maybe one day, you'll tell your wife.

182
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:54,027
Maybe.

183
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:03,079
I figure you'll be with Sarah
on Valentine's, so...

184
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:16,692
I...

185
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:19,556
I didn't get you anything.

186
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:20,789
You don't need to.

187
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:23,829
You already have.

188
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:27,496
I'm pregnant.

189
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:03,698
Tom. What are you doing here?

190
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,461
What do you mean?
I'm here to sign the papers.

191
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:06,830
They moved the signing to Monday.

192
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:08,733
They moved it to Monday. Great.

193
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:10,931
Well, you're here now.

194
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,406
Want to come in and have a drink?

195
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:13,908
Yeah. Okay.

196
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:19,605
We missed you at the funeral.

197
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:22,685
Of course, your father missed you
long before that.

198
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:27,889
Oh, he could have found me
if he wanted to.

199
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:30,551
You know, he'd kick your ass
if he knew you were selling the mine.

200
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,890
- It is what it is, Ben.
- Bullshit.

201
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:36,193
That mine is Harmony's life blood, Tom.

202
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,460
We're talking families here.

203
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:41,036
I was assured that everyone
would get severance

204
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:44,163
and that the more experienced men,
like yourself, would be kept on.

205
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:46,333
For how long? Three months?

206
00:20:46,443 --> 00:20:48,001
That's not my problem.

207
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:50,272
No! It's my fucking problem.

208
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,474
Those mines have been
outdated since I was a kid.

209
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,778
But my father

210
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:57,580
was just too stubborn to see it,
and you know that.

211
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,353
So that's what all this is about.

212
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:05,420
All right.

213
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:11,725
If you need to make
peace with your daddy...

214
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:18,740
there he is.

215
00:21:22,746 --> 00:21:24,145
I'm majority shareholder.

216
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:26,909
And I'm selling the mine.

217
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:28,677
And that's all there is to it.

218
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:32,883
Your dad and I protected those men!

219
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:37,983
Selling the mine won't sit well
with anyone in this town.

220
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:42,457
Well, come Monday, I'm gone.

221
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:04,752
Louis! Get back here this instant!

222
00:22:04,854 --> 00:22:06,287
Louis!

223
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:13,719
- Is Mel around?
- God, I hope not.

224
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,526
Mel has been dead for seven years.

225
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:18,032
Trade you the pooch for a room.

226
00:22:18,134 --> 00:22:19,260
All right. Come.

227
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:43,414
Yes!

228
00:22:46,963 --> 00:22:48,430
Oh, yeah!

229
00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:50,556
Oh, yes! Frank!

230
00:22:52,802 --> 00:22:54,463
Oh, my God. What's wrong?

231
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:56,766
I look so hot today.

232
00:22:56,873 --> 00:22:58,534
Oh, yes...

233
00:23:12,021 --> 00:23:13,648
<i>Stay down, Harry!</i>

234
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,003
So you gonna be okay to drive back,

235
00:23:29,105 --> 00:23:30,902
or do you want me to
put in for another night?

236
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:34,101
I got a two-day haul to make

237
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,441
in one day, if I'm gonna
get back by Valentine's.

238
00:23:37,547 --> 00:23:39,014
Ah, Valentine's.

239
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:42,183
Did you know that St. Valentine

240
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:44,344
- was a patron saint of love?
- Yeah.

241
00:23:44,454 --> 00:23:48,049
Yeah, the whole thing started in Rome
in, like, the year 500 or something.

242
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:49,681
They would have this lottery,

243
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:53,159
where young men would draw
teenage girls' names out of a box.

244
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:55,493
Then that teenage girl
would become their secret

245
00:23:55,598 --> 00:23:58,328
sexual companion for
the whole rest of the year.

246
00:23:58,434 --> 00:24:00,561
That's where we got our
Valentine's Day cards from.

247
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,036
Kind of romantic, in a sick
kind of way, isn't it?

248
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:05,403
Uh, yeah.
It's, um, romantic.

249
00:24:06,976 --> 00:24:08,466
What'cha doing?

250
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:09,602
Nothing. I got this.

251
00:24:09,712 --> 00:24:10,940
Frank?

252
00:24:12,715 --> 00:24:13,682
What the fuck is that?

253
00:24:15,385 --> 00:24:18,616
Irene, I make these for
my own personal collection.

254
00:24:18,721 --> 00:24:20,621
Look. I'II...

255
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:21,690
I'll pay you?

256
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,156
I am no hooker.

257
00:24:24,994 --> 00:24:25,961
You are now.

258
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:37,930
Shit.

259
00:24:38,975 --> 00:24:39,942
Fuck.

260
00:24:59,395 --> 00:25:00,589
Frank!

261
00:25:01,864 --> 00:25:03,491
Frank, you son of a bitch!

262
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,261
Irene.

263
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:08,296
Put some clothes on
before some kid sees you.

264
00:25:08,404 --> 00:25:09,598
I don't give a shit about the clothes!

265
00:25:09,706 --> 00:25:11,970
Give me the fucking tapes,
or I swear...

266
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:14,509
- I swear...
- Irene, two things.

267
00:25:14,611 --> 00:25:17,079
1, I don't want you anymore.

268
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,478
And 2, I know the gun's not loaded.

269
00:25:19,582 --> 00:25:21,482
Fuck you, Frank!

270
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:24,313
Oh, jeez! What...

271
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,388
What are you doing?

272
00:25:28,057 --> 00:25:29,524
God!

273
00:25:41,671 --> 00:25:44,902
<i>Frank. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

274
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:03,648
Oh, God.

275
00:26:05,995 --> 00:26:07,462
Oh, my God.

276
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:12,095
Oh, my God.

277
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,014
Louis?

278
00:27:05,121 --> 00:27:07,521
Where are you?

279
00:27:11,994 --> 00:27:15,452
Louis? Where are you?

280
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:19,797
Louis, you little shit.

281
00:27:19,902 --> 00:27:23,338
Stop hiding from Mama.

282
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,846
Louis, you are in such trouble.

283
00:27:33,116 --> 00:27:35,311
The closet.

284
00:27:35,418 --> 00:27:36,783
Honestly.

285
00:28:10,853 --> 00:28:12,411
Fuck you! Fuck you!

286
00:28:12,522 --> 00:28:13,853
Let go of me!

287
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:24,633
No!

288
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:42,180
What the fuck do you want?

289
00:28:45,454 --> 00:28:47,285
What do you want, motherfucker?

290
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:51,483
No!

291
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:01,859
Leave me alone!

292
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:29,093
Jesus, Irene.

293
00:29:29,198 --> 00:29:31,029
He took your heart.

294
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:37,768
Jilted lover with a screw loose?

295
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:40,434
More than one screw,
wouldn't you say?

296
00:29:41,978 --> 00:29:43,639
Irene never did the jilting.

297
00:29:43,746 --> 00:29:44,678
I'm sorry, Sheriff.

298
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,214
I know you two used to be an item.

299
00:29:47,316 --> 00:29:49,511
Yeah, it was a long time ago, Martin.

300
00:29:51,754 --> 00:29:53,312
We checked the motel registration.

301
00:29:53,422 --> 00:29:54,684
There's a couple of fakes.

302
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,883
Not too many people use
their real name around here.

303
00:29:56,993 --> 00:29:58,392
If you know what I mean.

304
00:29:59,896 --> 00:30:02,729
All right. This name is real.

305
00:30:02,832 --> 00:30:03,856
Tom Hanniger?

306
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:05,297
Sheriff, we got a video camera.

307
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:06,800
You ain't gonna believe what's on it.

308
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:09,736
Sarah, I'm sorry I'm late again.

309
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,704
They found someone dead
at the Thunderbird.

310
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:13,399
There's cops everywhere.

311
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,101
Have you talked to Axel?

312
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:16,200
Go stock the display.

313
00:30:20,816 --> 00:30:21,748
Hi.

314
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:23,716
Tom?

315
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:24,786
Sarah.

316
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:30,124
You're still working for your folks, I see.

317
00:30:30,226 --> 00:30:31,318
Tom.

318
00:30:33,296 --> 00:30:34,194
What are you doing here?

319
00:30:34,297 --> 00:30:38,290
I had to come back into town
to clear some things up.

320
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:41,165
Your father. I'm so sorry.

321
00:30:42,471 --> 00:30:43,369
Thanks.

322
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:44,564
Tom, where did you go?

323
00:30:44,674 --> 00:30:46,733
It's been...

324
00:30:46,842 --> 00:30:47,866
ten years.

325
00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:52,140
You look even prettier than when I left.

326
00:30:52,248 --> 00:30:53,340
Left?

327
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:56,782
You say that like you just went off
to school or something.

328
00:30:58,187 --> 00:31:00,121
You just vanished.

329
00:31:00,222 --> 00:31:01,712
Your dad didn't even
know where you were.

330
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:04,554
We all started to think
that you were dead.

331
00:31:09,632 --> 00:31:11,327
I'm sorry.

332
00:31:17,106 --> 00:31:19,074
That's a beautiful family you have there.

333
00:31:22,878 --> 00:31:25,005
I guess it's not
Sarah Mercer anymore.

334
00:31:25,114 --> 00:31:26,081
No.

335
00:31:27,283 --> 00:31:28,511
It's Sarah Palmer now.

336
00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:31,347
I never thought Axel would settle down.

337
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:33,513
But he always did like you.

338
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:36,956
I should go.

339
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:38,185
Wait.

340
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:40,819
It's good to see you, Sarah.

341
00:31:55,277 --> 00:31:56,539
Mommy!

342
00:31:56,645 --> 00:31:58,237
Hey, Sheriff. How was your day?

343
00:31:58,347 --> 00:31:59,974
Good. It was real good.

344
00:32:00,082 --> 00:32:01,743
Good. Why don't
you go upstairs and brush your teeth,

345
00:32:01,851 --> 00:32:03,284
and I'll be up in a sec for story time,

346
00:32:03,386 --> 00:32:04,683
and you can tell me all about it, okay?

347
00:32:04,787 --> 00:32:06,379
- Okay, Mom.
- Love you.

348
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:07,478
Bye.

349
00:32:08,824 --> 00:32:10,917
- Hey, Rosa, is Axel home yet?
- No, Mrs. Palmer.

350
00:32:11,027 --> 00:32:12,187
All right. Thanks for everything today.

351
00:32:12,294 --> 00:32:14,319
I can take it from here.

352
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,748
<i>Hello.</i>

353
00:32:38,854 --> 00:32:40,981
- Hey, it's me.
<i>- Axel, are you okay?</i>

354
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,183
<i>I heard that somebody died</i>
<i>at the motel last night.</i>

355
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:44,725
Look, I don't have time to talk now,

356
00:32:44,827 --> 00:32:46,556
but I just thought
you should know it was...

357
00:32:46,662 --> 00:32:47,788
it was Irene.

358
00:32:47,897 --> 00:32:49,091
She was murdered.

359
00:32:49,198 --> 00:32:51,063
<i>Irene?</i>

360
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:54,466
<i>Hey, Sheriff, you want</i>
<i>to come look at these tapes?</i>

361
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,095
I got to go.

362
00:33:12,755 --> 00:33:14,916
Oh, yeah.

363
00:33:15,024 --> 00:33:17,993
This certainly won't quiet the rumors
about Harry Warden being back.

364
00:33:18,094 --> 00:33:19,220
People can think what they want.

365
00:33:19,328 --> 00:33:20,625
Doesn't make it true.

366
00:33:20,729 --> 00:33:22,253
The talk is out there, Sheriff.

367
00:33:22,364 --> 00:33:24,525
A lot of folks remember ten years ago
like it was yesterday.

368
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:27,659
Yeah, and there's a lot of miner suits
in this town, Martin.

369
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,601
It's not Harry Warden.
He's dead, remember?

370
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:32,731
Sheriff, you got a Valentine.

371
00:33:41,183 --> 00:33:43,014
Ferris, get me a glove.

372
00:34:00,636 --> 00:34:02,160
Oh, Jesus.

373
00:34:05,374 --> 00:34:06,341
Not Harry?

374
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:12,103
Harry Warden is dead.

375
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:13,909
I shot him myself.

376
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:17,715
It's a copycat. Just some sick fuck.

377
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,015
He wasn't buried in no cave-in.

378
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:23,216
They never did find his body,
despite what the reports say.

379
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:25,384
Aw, hell.

380
00:34:25,494 --> 00:34:26,984
The Hanniger kid.

381
00:34:27,096 --> 00:34:28,893
What the hell is he doing here?

382
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:30,090
Leave the kid alone.

383
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,633
- Relax, Hinch...
- You cocksucker!

384
00:34:33,769 --> 00:34:34,667
Hinch!

385
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,931
Get... Back up! Get the hell off!

386
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,529
What the fuck?

387
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:39,938
He's back because of you.

388
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:41,669
You were responsible.

389
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:43,608
He wants you!

390
00:34:43,712 --> 00:34:44,679
Easy.

391
00:34:46,115 --> 00:34:47,707
You're in the wrong bar, kid.

392
00:34:47,816 --> 00:34:49,340
Get off of me.

393
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:50,543
Red!

394
00:34:56,926 --> 00:35:01,090
Everybody, stand down,
God damn it!

395
00:35:01,197 --> 00:35:03,722
Harry's gonna kill you
for good this time. You hear me?

396
00:35:03,832 --> 00:35:05,129
Hanniger, hit the door. Come on...

397
00:35:05,234 --> 00:35:06,792
Why?

398
00:35:06,902 --> 00:35:08,199
'Cause you people want to blame me

399
00:35:08,304 --> 00:35:10,499
for the shit that happened a decade ago?

400
00:35:10,606 --> 00:35:12,631
I didn't kill those people!

401
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:15,039
Come on. Come on!

402
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:17,806
It started with you, Tom.

403
00:35:17,913 --> 00:35:20,848
Half the people here know someone
who died because of your fu...

404
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,010
Harry Warden
killed them, not me.

405
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,643
I know that, but you...

406
00:35:25,754 --> 00:35:27,745
Then why don't they blame you?

407
00:35:27,856 --> 00:35:29,221
I mean, you were the sheriff.

408
00:35:29,325 --> 00:35:30,383
Yeah.

409
00:35:32,294 --> 00:35:34,285
I just saved your ass, Hanniger.

410
00:35:34,396 --> 00:35:36,296
For the second time.

411
00:35:36,398 --> 00:35:38,025
But don't you worry, kiddo.

412
00:35:39,668 --> 00:35:40,760
There won't be a third.

413
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:41,836
Good.

414
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,253
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

415
00:35:59,355 --> 00:36:01,755
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

416
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,362
What's wrong? Is it Noah?

417
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:13,958
Noah's fine, but it's 2 in the morning.

418
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:15,127
What is that?

419
00:36:17,006 --> 00:36:18,132
It's an evidence tape.

420
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,367
Irene's murder.

421
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:25,345
I'm sorry.

422
00:36:25,447 --> 00:36:26,505
I'll let you get back...

423
00:36:26,615 --> 00:36:28,879
Tom Hanniger's back in town
to sell the mine.

424
00:36:30,286 --> 00:36:32,948
He didn't stop by and visit you, did he?

425
00:36:33,055 --> 00:36:35,990
Yeah, he came to
the grocery store today.

426
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:37,558
I was definitely surprised.

427
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,127
Why? What's going on?

428
00:36:39,228 --> 00:36:40,889
The love of your life might be involved

429
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:43,692
in some very deep shit.

430
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:48,495
He's not the love of my life.

431
00:36:48,604 --> 00:36:49,901
No?

432
00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:56,270
You left this on the dresser.

433
00:37:03,752 --> 00:37:06,220
It was the last time
you and him were together.

434
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:09,250
Always brings a tear to my eye.

435
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:10,484
Axel, I don't want to fight.

436
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:12,685
It's... I gotta be at work in five hours.

437
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:14,763
Yeah, well, I have to work now.

438
00:37:17,499 --> 00:37:20,730
I found this tape at the murder scene.

439
00:37:34,183 --> 00:37:38,142
If Tom contacts you again,
you let me know right away.

440
00:37:53,135 --> 00:37:54,397
Oh, God!

441
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:55,561
- Easy.
- Jesus.

442
00:37:55,671 --> 00:37:57,400
It's just me.

443
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,372
A little jumpy these days.

444
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:01,136
I'm sorry.

445
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:02,540
What are you doing here?

446
00:38:02,644 --> 00:38:06,080
I wanted to, uh, talk to you
when you weren't working.

447
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:09,514
Well, I'm at work.

448
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,680
Well, you got 15 minutes
before the store opens.

449
00:38:18,594 --> 00:38:20,425
I shouldn't have left the way that I did.

450
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:23,464
I know I fucked up.

451
00:38:23,565 --> 00:38:25,590
It was a long time ago.

452
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:29,030
You know, the second I saw you,

453
00:38:29,138 --> 00:38:32,369
I instantly regretted
the last ten years of my life?

454
00:38:32,474 --> 00:38:34,874
You sell those mines,
you'll regret the rest of your life, too.

455
00:38:34,977 --> 00:38:36,638
I didn't come here
to talk to you about that.

456
00:38:36,745 --> 00:38:39,612
You have no idea, do you?

457
00:38:39,715 --> 00:38:41,342
This town depends on that mine.

458
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,247
Everyone here,
everyone from the miners

459
00:38:43,352 --> 00:38:44,876
to the cashiers at the grocery store.

460
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:46,420
That's not my responsibility.

461
00:38:46,522 --> 00:38:47,614
Yes, it is.

462
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:49,088
You ran away ten years ago,

463
00:38:49,191 --> 00:38:51,682
but the rest of us stayed
to pick up the pieces.

464
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:53,785
We supported each other.

465
00:38:55,264 --> 00:38:56,595
Don't you remember
how much that mine

466
00:38:56,698 --> 00:38:58,256
used to mean to your family?

467
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:00,392
I guess not.

468
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:02,470
Because you just ran away,
and you just keep on running.

469
00:39:02,571 --> 00:39:04,368
It didn't follow you for ten years.

470
00:39:06,575 --> 00:39:07,633
It didn't?

471
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:11,677
- I faced it.
- I can't.

472
00:39:13,115 --> 00:39:15,948
I wish I could, but I can't.

473
00:39:16,051 --> 00:39:18,281
I lost my way.

474
00:39:20,022 --> 00:39:22,650
Tom, you can go back to that place

475
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:25,192
where it all went wrong
and find your way again.

476
00:39:25,294 --> 00:39:28,695
Or you can just keep running
the rest of your life.

477
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:30,958
It's your choice.

478
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:20,207
What do you got?

479
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:22,112
I need a signature.

480
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,687
Get this in.

481
00:40:26,788 --> 00:40:28,722
Tom? What the hell you doing here?

482
00:40:28,824 --> 00:40:30,553
Where's Ben? I need to talk to him.

483
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:31,853
You can't. He's down in the mine.

484
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,520
- I'm going down.
- Like hell you are.

485
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,757
- It's not safe.
- I grew up in these mines, Riggs.

486
00:40:36,865 --> 00:40:37,797
I think I'll be fine.

487
00:40:49,244 --> 00:40:51,712
Who's bleeding the lines on 3?

488
00:40:53,982 --> 00:40:55,313
Red'll take you down.

489
00:41:13,302 --> 00:41:15,236
How's the hand?

490
00:41:32,154 --> 00:41:34,486
Just don't touch anything.

491
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,490
I'll call for Ben.

492
00:41:39,294 --> 00:41:41,922
Yeah. Hey, send Ben to tunnel 3.

493
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:44,055
He's got a visitor.

494
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,058
What the hell do you mean?

495
00:41:49,938 --> 00:41:52,771
Well, go and get him, then.

496
00:41:52,874 --> 00:41:54,865
Stupid ass.

497
00:42:01,149 --> 00:42:03,845
<i>We'll rescue Trainor down below.</i>

498
00:42:03,952 --> 00:42:05,749
<i>You, venom, and methane in 5, all right?</i>

499
00:42:05,854 --> 00:42:07,014
<i>I know my job, Harry.</i>

500
00:42:07,122 --> 00:42:08,350
<i>Like fuck you do.</i>

501
00:42:08,457 --> 00:42:09,583
<i>I know my job, Harry.</i>

502
00:42:09,691 --> 00:42:11,386
<i>Like fuck you do.</i>

503
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:19,087
Well, you know what?

504
00:43:19,194 --> 00:43:21,219
You couldn't find
your ass with both hands.

505
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:22,591
Listen.

506
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:25,157
Well...

507
00:43:26,835 --> 00:43:28,427
What do you want?

508
00:43:34,409 --> 00:43:36,309
Son of a bitch!

509
00:43:40,148 --> 00:43:41,672
Guys, trouble on 3.

510
00:43:41,783 --> 00:43:43,910
Red's into it again. Come on, let's go!

511
00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:45,680
Double time!

512
00:44:07,776 --> 00:44:09,437
You're dead, motherfucker.

513
00:45:17,913 --> 00:45:18,845
Red!

514
00:45:18,947 --> 00:45:19,936
Red!

515
00:45:22,884 --> 00:45:24,283
Red?

516
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,555
Jesus Christ.

517
00:45:28,657 --> 00:45:30,557
What you got?

518
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:33,150
Oh, fuck.

519
00:45:33,261 --> 00:45:34,159
Is he dead?

520
00:45:35,597 --> 00:45:37,827
Riggs! Is he dead?

521
00:45:37,933 --> 00:45:39,457
Get me out of here.

522
00:45:39,568 --> 00:45:42,002
- What happened?
- Get me out of here.

523
00:45:42,103 --> 00:45:43,570
Come on.

524
00:45:45,173 --> 00:45:47,038
It's jammed. Give me a hand.

525
00:45:47,142 --> 00:45:48,905
- Got it.
- Get it open.

526
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:51,501
Get me the fuck out of here.

527
00:45:52,547 --> 00:45:54,879
What'd you do, Tom?
What did you do?

528
00:45:54,983 --> 00:45:56,541
I didn't do anything!

529
00:45:59,421 --> 00:46:00,388
Shit.

530
00:46:02,724 --> 00:46:04,885
Happy Valentine's Day.

531
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:09,863
That's quite the public service, Sarah.

532
00:46:09,965 --> 00:46:11,796
Never one to break tradition, Dr. Miller.

533
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,800
Let me just steal one.

534
00:46:13,902 --> 00:46:14,994
I won't tell if you won't.

535
00:46:15,103 --> 00:46:16,070
Thank you.

536
00:46:22,344 --> 00:46:24,073
Where the hell were you?

537
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:25,544
I was in tunnel 3.

538
00:46:25,647 --> 00:46:26,579
We found Red.

539
00:46:26,681 --> 00:46:28,740
It was Harry Warden.

540
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:30,511
Tommy, come on.

541
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:32,109
He attacked me,

542
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,484
and then I sat there,
and I watched him kill Red.

543
00:46:34,589 --> 00:46:36,079
You know how crazy that sounds?

544
00:46:36,191 --> 00:46:37,522
It's fucking nuts, okay?

545
00:46:37,626 --> 00:46:38,650
I know that.

546
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,523
But he was there,
and he tried to kill me.

547
00:46:40,629 --> 00:46:42,392
Sir, please, relax.

548
00:46:42,497 --> 00:46:46,126
Okay. You can get
your shirt back on now.

549
00:46:46,234 --> 00:46:47,201
Thank you.

550
00:46:51,773 --> 00:46:54,367
Tommy, exactly what did you see?

551
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:55,841
What happened to you?

552
00:46:57,045 --> 00:46:58,171
He was attacked.

553
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,577
By who?

554
00:46:59,681 --> 00:47:01,740
Nobody.

555
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,613
Harry Warden.

556
00:47:03,718 --> 00:47:05,709
It happened in the mine.

557
00:47:08,723 --> 00:47:09,917
What were you doing in the mine?

558
00:47:10,025 --> 00:47:13,119
I was gonna tell Ben
that I'm not selling it.

559
00:47:16,197 --> 00:47:17,289
And why the hell not?

560
00:47:20,468 --> 00:47:22,766
You find something in town
that's suddenly worth staying for?

561
00:47:22,871 --> 00:47:26,329
Axel, you were always jealous
of me and Sarah.

562
00:47:27,642 --> 00:47:29,269
You mean my wife Sarah?

563
00:47:29,377 --> 00:47:30,810
Who lives in my house?

564
00:47:30,912 --> 00:47:32,937
Who is mother to my son?

565
00:47:33,048 --> 00:47:35,243
Who I share a bed with
and have sex with?

566
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:36,817
- Axel, enough!
- That Sarah?

567
00:47:36,918 --> 00:47:38,317
Enough.

568
00:47:40,655 --> 00:47:43,453
- Harry Warden, right? He attacked you.
- Yeah.

569
00:47:43,558 --> 00:47:47,050
Besides the fact that he's been dead
for ten years,

570
00:47:47,162 --> 00:47:49,653
how comes no one else saw him?

571
00:47:49,764 --> 00:47:51,493
I don't know, Sheriff, but I was there.

572
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,861
I saw him.

573
00:47:52,968 --> 00:47:56,369
You know, this town's
in a frenzy because of you.

574
00:47:56,471 --> 00:47:59,702
I'm gonna put an end to that right now.

575
00:47:59,808 --> 00:48:01,969
You want to tell them, or should I?

576
00:48:04,546 --> 00:48:06,275
What the hell are you talkin' about?

577
00:48:06,381 --> 00:48:07,643
Fine. I'll tell 'em, then.

578
00:48:07,749 --> 00:48:10,741
You see, Tom, my dad,
who drank himself to death,

579
00:48:10,852 --> 00:48:13,116
along with your dad and Ben here,

580
00:48:13,221 --> 00:48:15,985
decided to take the law
into their own hands ten years ago.

581
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:17,718
They killed Harry Warden.

582
00:48:17,826 --> 00:48:19,157
Axel.

583
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,818
And Sheriff Burke covered it up.

584
00:48:23,431 --> 00:48:26,662
We couldn't have the town fathers
on the hook for vigilante justice.

585
00:48:26,768 --> 00:48:29,259
You see, Harry wasn't
buried alive in the mine,

586
00:48:29,371 --> 00:48:31,703
but he's sure as shit dead and buried.

587
00:48:31,806 --> 00:48:33,239
And we're gonna lay that to rest.

588
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:35,376
Aren't we?

589
00:48:43,818 --> 00:48:45,149
Where is it?

590
00:48:45,253 --> 00:48:46,982
I don't know what you think
you're gonna find.

591
00:48:47,088 --> 00:48:49,113
Jim, just show me
where the body's buried,

592
00:48:49,224 --> 00:48:50,213
and we won't have any problems.

593
00:48:50,325 --> 00:48:53,488
Once we find the old escape hatch,
it's just beyond there.

594
00:48:53,595 --> 00:48:55,460
Sheriff, you really think that dangling

595
00:48:55,563 --> 00:48:58,896
a set of decade-old bones
in town square

596
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,558
is gonna clear up these murders?

597
00:49:00,668 --> 00:49:04,229
No, but it'll stop people from thinking
the boogey man is back.

598
00:49:04,339 --> 00:49:07,035
And then I can get on
with my investigation.

599
00:49:09,878 --> 00:49:11,004
Found the hatch.

600
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,814
Yeah. This is where we found him.

601
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:16,781
Bleeding at the hatch.

602
00:49:16,885 --> 00:49:18,750
Over here.

603
00:49:26,861 --> 00:49:28,692
I found it.

604
00:49:30,465 --> 00:49:31,625
Or what used to be it.

605
00:49:33,868 --> 00:49:34,926
What the hell is this?

606
00:49:36,237 --> 00:49:38,000
Animals must have got at him.

607
00:49:38,106 --> 00:49:40,404
Animals? Was he dead or not
when you buried him?

608
00:49:40,508 --> 00:49:41,998
Damn right he was dead.

609
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:43,668
There was no pulse.

610
00:49:43,778 --> 00:49:45,678
There was no life
left in him at all, right?

611
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,271
I shot him. I shot
the son of a bitch dead.

612
00:49:48,383 --> 00:49:49,907
Yeah, we buried him right here.

613
00:49:50,018 --> 00:49:52,578
It was a better burial than he deserved.

614
00:49:52,687 --> 00:49:55,155
And you're sure he was dead, Ben?

615
00:49:56,724 --> 00:49:58,589
There's no way he could be alive.

616
00:49:58,693 --> 00:50:00,957
God damn it.

617
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,662
I want statements from the both of you.

618
00:50:04,766 --> 00:50:07,735
And you, I want you back
at the station now.

619
00:50:07,836 --> 00:50:10,100
We got a dead miner to discuss.

620
00:50:10,205 --> 00:50:11,137
Come on, Sarah.

621
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:12,900
Come on, gentlemen.

622
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:23,374
What were you doing at the mine earlier?

623
00:50:24,686 --> 00:50:26,119
I was doing my job.

624
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:32,321
You're the suspect. Not me.

625
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,698
I didn't kill the guy
in the mine, okay?

626
00:50:41,803 --> 00:50:43,862
I know somebody wants you
to think that I did,

627
00:50:43,972 --> 00:50:45,530
but I didn't.

628
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,540
Relax.

629
00:50:47,642 --> 00:50:49,234
We'll get to that.

630
00:50:55,316 --> 00:50:56,408
So.

631
00:50:57,685 --> 00:50:59,243
Why are you really back in town?

632
00:51:01,356 --> 00:51:02,516
You know why.

633
00:51:02,624 --> 00:51:05,184
No.

634
00:51:05,293 --> 00:51:08,660
I don't know why someone would miss
their own father's funeral,

635
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:10,993
but show up to sell off his only asset.

636
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:13,624
Well, I'm not selling the mine.

637
00:51:13,735 --> 00:51:15,464
In fact, I've decided to stay.

638
00:51:20,642 --> 00:51:22,507
And why is that?

639
00:51:28,149 --> 00:51:30,344
You know she settled for you.

640
00:51:30,451 --> 00:51:31,816
Right?

641
00:51:37,892 --> 00:51:39,189
My God.

642
00:51:40,628 --> 00:51:42,391
What did you just say to me?

643
00:51:42,497 --> 00:51:44,931
Sarah settled for...

644
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:49,166
Stay the fuck away from my wife!

645
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,168
You hear me?

646
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:51,431
Stay the fuck away from my wife!

647
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:52,801
Axel! Axel, calm down.

648
00:51:52,907 --> 00:51:54,067
Lock him up, Martin! Lock him up!

649
00:51:54,175 --> 00:51:55,301
I can't do that!

650
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:58,379
The mine foreman confirmed
that Tom was stuck

651
00:51:58,479 --> 00:52:01,277
in that cage when they came down.

652
00:52:01,382 --> 00:52:03,441
Somebody else was down there.

653
00:52:08,223 --> 00:52:10,157
That's great.

654
00:52:10,258 --> 00:52:11,987
That's fucking wonderful.

655
00:52:12,093 --> 00:52:13,958
Fuck!

656
00:52:21,903 --> 00:52:24,133
Won't be long before Axel
locks you up for good.

657
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:25,866
Just because Axel
wants to think that I did it

658
00:52:25,974 --> 00:52:27,236
doesn't mean that I did.

659
00:52:27,342 --> 00:52:28,832
There was someone else down there.

660
00:52:28,943 --> 00:52:31,810
Yeah. Harry.

661
00:52:31,913 --> 00:52:35,007
- But how? Why?
- I don't know, Ben.

662
00:52:35,116 --> 00:52:37,812
Maybe to finish
what he started ten years ago.

663
00:52:37,919 --> 00:52:39,887
If I were you, Tom,
I'd get the hell out of town.

664
00:52:39,988 --> 00:52:42,479
No. No, I'm not running this time.

665
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,251
I'm gonna find him.

666
00:52:46,494 --> 00:52:50,157
If you don't find him,
I'm betting he finds you.

667
00:52:51,432 --> 00:52:52,797
Or you.

668
00:56:08,196 --> 00:56:09,288
Who is it?

669
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:53,539
Damn Harry Warden.

670
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:57,845
Got me aiming at shadows.

671
00:57:00,214 --> 00:57:02,682
Aiming at shadows.

672
00:57:24,872 --> 00:57:25,839
Harry.

673
00:57:30,044 --> 00:57:31,773
It is you.

674
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,845
No. No.

675
00:57:34,949 --> 00:57:36,473
l... l...

676
00:57:52,066 --> 00:57:53,931
No. No.

677
00:57:54,035 --> 00:57:55,696
No. No.

678
00:58:00,074 --> 00:58:01,974
No. No.

679
00:58:02,076 --> 00:58:03,043
No.

680
00:58:08,416 --> 00:58:10,111
Shit.

681
00:58:15,156 --> 00:58:17,215
I know the picture's ten years old,

682
00:58:17,325 --> 00:58:18,690
but that's all that we have.

683
00:58:18,793 --> 00:58:20,920
Yeah, I know every store
in the state are selling the candy boxes,

684
00:58:21,028 --> 00:58:22,495
but send Harry Warden's photo anyway.

685
00:58:22,597 --> 00:58:24,064
Who knows? We might get lucky.

686
00:58:24,165 --> 00:58:25,530
How many favors have I done for you?

687
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:27,066
- Yes.
- Just make this happen.

688
00:58:27,168 --> 00:58:28,294
So what's the problem?

689
00:58:28,402 --> 00:58:29,630
No, no, don't...
don't put me on hold.

690
00:58:29,737 --> 00:58:30,965
This is unbelievable.

691
00:58:31,072 --> 00:58:32,835
Yeah. Well, then, tell him to do it.

692
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,500
I don't care who does it.
Just get it done.

693
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:36,577
All right.

694
00:58:37,645 --> 00:58:40,512
Yes. All right. Good.

695
00:58:41,916 --> 00:58:42,883
Sarah.

696
00:58:46,754 --> 00:58:48,483
Thought I'd bring you some lunch.

697
00:58:48,589 --> 00:58:49,647
Have you seen Tom?

698
00:58:49,757 --> 00:58:51,554
No. Not since yesterday.

699
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:53,684
Well, we lost track of him this morning,
and Ben's missing.

700
00:58:53,794 --> 00:58:54,692
I don't know where he is.

701
00:58:54,795 --> 00:58:56,285
Look, this isn't a game, Sarah.

702
00:58:56,397 --> 00:58:58,126
People are dead,
and Tom is the only one without an alibi.

703
00:58:58,232 --> 00:58:59,290
Tom said somebody else was in...

704
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,834
- The fuck there was!
- Jesus.

705
00:59:05,973 --> 00:59:07,406
What is with you two?

706
00:59:10,177 --> 00:59:12,008
Look. I'm sorry, okay?

707
00:59:12,113 --> 00:59:13,842
- I'm sorry.
- Sheriff.

708
00:59:14,882 --> 00:59:15,849
What is it?

709
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:19,411
We found Ben.

710
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:25,887
I'll see you later.

711
00:59:42,743 --> 00:59:44,176
What do you think?

712
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,448
We're being mocked.

713
00:59:50,584 --> 00:59:52,108
Only three other people
out here earlier.

714
00:59:52,219 --> 00:59:54,119
I'm pretty sure my wife's not the killer.

715
00:59:55,656 --> 00:59:58,386
Get a cruiser outside my house.

716
00:59:58,492 --> 01:00:00,255
Find Burke.

717
01:00:00,361 --> 01:00:02,625
Find Tom Hanniger.
They're our prime suspects.

718
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,111
Megan, honey, you can let that go.

719
01:00:21,215 --> 01:00:22,375
Can you give me a hand, please?

720
01:00:22,483 --> 01:00:24,314
Axel wants us to get out of here quick.

721
01:00:24,418 --> 01:00:26,079
You're the boss.

722
01:00:28,489 --> 01:00:31,117
Okay. Thank you.

723
01:00:35,262 --> 01:00:38,254
How did you ever end up with Axel
if you were with Tom?

724
01:00:38,365 --> 01:00:41,926
Uh, it was Valentine's Day,
you know, when, um...

725
01:00:42,036 --> 01:00:44,231
When Harry Warden killed everyone?

726
01:00:44,338 --> 01:00:46,203
You were there.

727
01:00:47,641 --> 01:00:49,199
Was Tom?

728
01:00:51,178 --> 01:00:52,145
Yeah.

729
01:00:54,115 --> 01:00:58,609
But Axel was the one
that was there for me.

730
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:02,450
But... he's not anymore.

731
01:01:08,796 --> 01:01:11,060
Did you lock up the front?

732
01:01:11,165 --> 01:01:12,359
Yes.

733
01:01:12,466 --> 01:01:14,764
Hello. The store's closed.

734
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,634
Hello?

735
01:01:52,139 --> 01:01:53,037
Wait here.

736
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:54,164
Wait!

737
01:01:55,709 --> 01:01:59,873
I'm kind of a pussy sometimes.

738
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,447
Welcome to the club.

739
01:02:28,075 --> 01:02:29,565
There's nobody here, Sarah.

740
01:02:43,691 --> 01:02:44,953
Shit!

741
01:02:45,059 --> 01:02:46,686
God! Megan.

742
01:02:46,794 --> 01:02:48,921
Okay, let's go. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

743
01:02:53,634 --> 01:02:54,794
Shit!

744
01:02:54,902 --> 01:02:56,733
Go! Go!

745
01:03:15,189 --> 01:03:16,952
No. Fuck.

746
01:03:28,869 --> 01:03:30,268
Come on, Megan!

747
01:03:35,843 --> 01:03:37,174
Sarah!

748
01:03:37,278 --> 01:03:39,940
Go, go, go, go!

749
01:03:42,283 --> 01:03:43,773
The back room!

750
01:03:45,452 --> 01:03:46,646
What the fuck?

751
01:03:47,755 --> 01:03:49,518
Oh, God! Oh, God!

752
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:51,723
Oh, God. Oh, God.

753
01:03:51,825 --> 01:03:53,087
Help me, help me, help me!

754
01:03:53,193 --> 01:03:54,387
Come on! Come on!

755
01:03:56,931 --> 01:03:58,523
Come help me. Quick, quick!

756
01:03:58,632 --> 01:03:59,621
Come on! Push it now!

757
01:04:00,668 --> 01:04:03,501
The window! Go! Go, go, go! Go!

758
01:04:09,977 --> 01:04:12,275
Oh, shit! It's locked!

759
01:04:12,379 --> 01:04:14,643
Sarah, we need the key!

760
01:04:14,748 --> 01:04:16,147
The key's in the desk. Hurry!

761
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,615
The key's in the desk. Hurry!

762
01:04:17,718 --> 01:04:19,811
- Come on! Hurry!
- Stop yelling at me!

763
01:04:23,424 --> 01:04:24,652
Fuck.

764
01:04:24,758 --> 01:04:26,123
It's at Mercer's grocery store!

765
01:04:26,226 --> 01:04:28,319
It's Harry Warden, and he's inside!

766
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:30,795
I got it! I got it!

767
01:04:43,143 --> 01:04:45,577
I can't get it!

768
01:04:47,481 --> 01:04:48,971
I can't get it.

769
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:50,050
Got it!

770
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,387
I got it.

771
01:04:57,591 --> 01:04:58,751
Go, go!

772
01:04:58,859 --> 01:05:00,622
Come on. Come on. Come on.

773
01:05:04,298 --> 01:05:07,756
Hurry. Oh, you can...
Turn, turn, turn.

774
01:05:07,868 --> 01:05:10,063
Come on, hurry. Wait. Something's not right.

775
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:11,933
Something's not right.
Something's... Come back.

776
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:13,267
Come back. Come back.
Come back.

777
01:05:13,374 --> 01:05:14,341
Oh, shit!

778
01:05:14,441 --> 01:05:16,375
Oh, my God! Sarah!

779
01:05:16,477 --> 01:05:18,104
Sarah, help me!

780
01:05:18,212 --> 01:05:20,612
Help me, Sarah!

781
01:06:13,267 --> 01:06:14,291
I got you.

782
01:06:14,401 --> 01:06:15,629
I got you. I got you. I got you!

783
01:06:15,736 --> 01:06:17,829
Sarah! Where is he?

784
01:06:17,938 --> 01:06:18,962
What about Megan, huh?

785
01:06:19,073 --> 01:06:20,665
Back alley. She's in the back alley.

786
01:06:20,774 --> 01:06:22,264
Okay.

787
01:06:22,376 --> 01:06:23,274
Stay behind me.

788
01:06:23,377 --> 01:06:24,639
Sarah. Sarah!

789
01:06:24,745 --> 01:06:26,576
Stay behind me. You understand?

790
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,738
Yes, yes. Yes.

791
01:07:17,131 --> 01:07:18,120
Stay back, baby.

792
01:07:24,071 --> 01:07:25,504
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?

793
01:07:25,606 --> 01:07:27,972
Sarah, stay back.
You don't want to see this.

794
01:07:31,445 --> 01:07:33,936
Oh, God. Oh, God.

795
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:55,863
They're gonna take you
over to the hospital

796
01:07:55,969 --> 01:07:57,266
and have you checked out.

797
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,200
Why would he go after her?

798
01:08:03,777 --> 01:08:06,177
Everybody's connected to the mine.

799
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,009
Just like ten years ago.

800
01:08:08,115 --> 01:08:09,082
Megan wasn't.

801
01:08:12,786 --> 01:08:14,447
Maybe the killer was
just trying to get to you.

802
01:08:14,555 --> 01:08:16,420
What are you talking about?

803
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:20,149
I'm not blind, Axel.

804
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,624
Let's go.

805
01:09:11,178 --> 01:09:13,078
Noah, I'm just taking the garbage out.

806
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:27,454
Is your cartoon over already?

807
01:09:59,393 --> 01:10:01,418
He's here, inside the house.

808
01:10:05,365 --> 01:10:06,923
Come on.

809
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,712
You want to take point?

810
01:10:30,691 --> 01:10:32,522
I'm retired.

811
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:11,761
<i>... the highest building in the city.</i>

812
01:11:11,865 --> 01:11:13,355
<i>Mr. Murray realized</i>
<i>that there were no more</i>

813
01:11:13,467 --> 01:11:16,834
<i>miserable people left, except for him.</i>

814
01:11:16,937 --> 01:11:19,599
<i>At which point, Mr. Murray</i>
<i>shot himself in the foot.</i>

815
01:11:31,651 --> 01:11:32,618
Noah.

816
01:11:50,036 --> 01:11:51,162
I want you to duck down.

817
01:11:51,271 --> 01:11:52,795
Stay hidden, okay?

818
01:11:52,906 --> 01:11:56,603
Don't come out until
I come and get you, no matter what.

819
01:12:48,361 --> 01:12:50,955
Burke! Get in here now!

820
01:13:29,102 --> 01:13:30,262
Hello.

821
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:32,600
<i>Sarah, it's me. Where are you?</i>

822
01:13:34,274 --> 01:13:35,241
I'm at the hospital.

823
01:13:35,342 --> 01:13:36,775
What happened? Are you okay?

824
01:13:36,877 --> 01:13:38,276
You were right.

825
01:13:40,213 --> 01:13:41,271
Harry Warden's back.

826
01:13:41,381 --> 01:13:43,508
<i>He tried to kill me. I got away.</i>

827
01:13:43,617 --> 01:13:44,948
Did you see his face?

828
01:13:45,051 --> 01:13:46,780
Just the mask.

829
01:13:46,887 --> 01:13:48,411
Sarah, I don't think it's Harry.

830
01:13:48,522 --> 01:13:50,490
What are you saying?

831
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:51,887
<i>Do you trust me?</i>

832
01:13:51,992 --> 01:13:52,924
Tom...

833
01:13:53,026 --> 01:13:54,584
Do you trust me?

834
01:13:55,962 --> 01:13:57,862
Yeah.

835
01:13:57,964 --> 01:13:58,953
I trust you.

836
01:13:59,065 --> 01:14:00,396
Okay, good.

837
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,398
There's something I have to show you.

838
01:14:01,501 --> 01:14:02,900
Tom, I have to get back to Noah.

839
01:14:03,003 --> 01:14:04,300
That's fine. I'll take you to him.

840
01:14:04,404 --> 01:14:05,928
But I gotta show you
something along the way.

841
01:14:12,546 --> 01:14:14,309
Where can I find Sarah?

842
01:14:14,414 --> 01:14:16,143
Well, Sheriff, she just checked out.

843
01:14:16,249 --> 01:14:17,580
What are you talking about?

844
01:14:18,652 --> 01:14:19,846
About ten minutes ago.

845
01:14:19,953 --> 01:14:22,786
She left with that nice Tom Hanniger.

846
01:14:22,889 --> 01:14:24,584
<i>Sheriff.</i>

847
01:14:26,793 --> 01:14:27,885
Go ahead.

848
01:14:27,994 --> 01:14:30,087
<i>I just got that report in</i>
<i>on Tom Hanniger.</i>

849
01:14:30,196 --> 01:14:32,130
<i>You're gonna want to hear this.</i>

850
01:14:40,073 --> 01:14:42,337
It took me ten years to get
that mask out of my head,

851
01:14:42,442 --> 01:14:43,807
and just like that, it's back.

852
01:14:45,779 --> 01:14:47,713
You know Axel owns land up here?

853
01:14:47,814 --> 01:14:49,281
Yeah. It's his daddy's old place.

854
01:14:49,382 --> 01:14:50,747
Been there lately?

855
01:14:55,121 --> 01:14:56,520
Axel's not who you think he is, Sarah.

856
01:14:56,623 --> 01:14:58,284
What are you saying?

857
01:14:58,391 --> 01:15:00,859
I'm saying I think he's responsible
for what's going on.

858
01:15:02,362 --> 01:15:03,329
The murders.

859
01:15:04,764 --> 01:15:05,731
That's crazy.

860
01:15:09,035 --> 01:15:10,525
Don't answer that.

861
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:16,039
Hello?

862
01:15:16,142 --> 01:15:18,770
Where are you?

863
01:15:18,878 --> 01:15:20,971
He's with you, isn't he?

864
01:15:23,984 --> 01:15:24,882
Yes.

865
01:15:24,985 --> 01:15:25,952
Who is that?

866
01:15:26,052 --> 01:15:28,213
All right, Sarah, listen to me.

867
01:15:28,321 --> 01:15:30,050
You need to get away
from Tom now.

868
01:15:30,156 --> 01:15:31,714
I'm not sure if
I know what you mean.

869
01:15:31,825 --> 01:15:34,692
Tom has been in a mental institute
for the past seven years.

870
01:15:34,794 --> 01:15:36,125
<i>He is not the guy you grew up with.</i>

871
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:37,287
Who is it?

872
01:15:37,397 --> 01:15:39,865
<i>He was in our house, Sarah. Rosa is dead.</i>

873
01:15:39,966 --> 01:15:41,058
<i>So is Burke.</i>

874
01:15:41,167 --> 01:15:42,725
He went after our son.

875
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:45,096
<i>And now he has you.</i>

876
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,003
- Noah. Is he...
<i>- Noah's fine. Noah's fine.</i>

877
01:15:49,109 --> 01:15:51,942
He's with Ferris at the station. He's safe.

878
01:15:52,045 --> 01:15:53,069
Look.

879
01:15:54,881 --> 01:15:57,076
I know I've been horrible to you.

880
01:15:57,183 --> 01:15:59,151
And I'm sorry. Okay?

881
01:15:59,252 --> 01:16:00,412
You can leave me if you want,

882
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,683
but just get out of the car, please.

883
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:05,189
Sarah, get out of the car.

884
01:16:07,027 --> 01:16:09,257
Thanks for checking in on him, Mom.

885
01:16:24,344 --> 01:16:27,472
I need to get home. My mom said
that Noah's not feeling very well.

886
01:16:28,948 --> 01:16:30,347
That wasn't your mom.

887
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:32,782
I need to get home to my son.

888
01:16:32,886 --> 01:16:34,114
Don't you trust me?

889
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:35,482
Take me home.

890
01:16:35,588 --> 01:16:37,749
- Damn it, Sarah! I need you to understand.
- Oh, God!

891
01:16:37,857 --> 01:16:39,688
Okay? I need somebody to understand.

892
01:16:39,793 --> 01:16:41,988
Tom. Tom, you're starting to scare me.

893
01:16:42,095 --> 01:16:43,392
You're the only one that I can trust.

894
01:16:43,496 --> 01:16:45,020
Okay? You gotta go with me on this.

895
01:16:45,131 --> 01:16:47,497
I have a husband and a son.
Please, just take me home.

896
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,036
Axel wants you to think that it's me,
but it's not. Okay?

897
01:16:51,137 --> 01:16:53,162
I don't think you know
what he's capable of.

898
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:56,065
I'm not gonna let you
take that chance, okay?

899
01:16:56,176 --> 01:16:58,303
I'm not gonna let you do that again.

900
01:16:58,411 --> 01:16:59,400
Fuck!

901
01:17:09,222 --> 01:17:11,213
Sarah!

902
01:18:53,092 --> 01:18:54,150
<i>Where are you?</i>

903
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,990
Axel? I crashed the car
in the woods by the mine.

904
01:18:57,096 --> 01:18:58,120
<i>Are you okay?</i>

905
01:18:58,231 --> 01:19:00,426
- Yeah. I think so.
<i>- Oh, God.</i>

906
01:19:00,533 --> 01:19:03,593
Okay. You go to my dad's old place,

907
01:19:03,703 --> 01:19:04,829
<i>- all right?</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

908
01:19:04,938 --> 01:19:05,836
<i>You hide.</i>

909
01:19:05,939 --> 01:19:07,497
I'm on my way.

910
01:19:07,607 --> 01:19:08,574
All right.

911
01:19:36,202 --> 01:19:37,362
Shit.

912
01:19:58,591 --> 01:19:59,580
Okay.

913
01:20:38,197 --> 01:20:40,893
<i>Axel wants you</i>
<i>to think that it's me, but it's not, okay?</i>

914
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,900
<i>I don't think you know what he's capable of.</i>

915
01:21:18,471 --> 01:21:19,495
Axel.

916
01:21:30,283 --> 01:21:31,545
Fuck! Fuck!

917
01:23:09,749 --> 01:23:11,046
Oh, God.

918
01:23:12,618 --> 01:23:13,585
Fuck!

919
01:24:02,235 --> 01:24:03,930
Oh, shit.

920
01:24:04,036 --> 01:24:05,060
Oh, fuck.

921
01:24:06,205 --> 01:24:07,194
Fuck.

922
01:24:27,393 --> 01:24:28,382
- Jesus.
- Don't move, Axel.

923
01:24:28,494 --> 01:24:30,553
Sarah, what are you doing?

924
01:24:30,663 --> 01:24:32,631
I found your hearts.

925
01:24:34,167 --> 01:24:35,191
Hearts? What are you saying?

926
01:24:35,301 --> 01:24:36,199
Up in the house.

927
01:24:36,302 --> 01:24:37,326
Your fucking Valentine's hearts.

928
01:24:37,436 --> 01:24:39,028
The Valentine from Megan?

929
01:24:39,138 --> 01:24:42,164
Look, I'm sorry. All right?

930
01:24:42,275 --> 01:24:44,334
- It meant <i>nothing...</i>
- I'm not talking about fucking Megan!

931
01:24:44,443 --> 01:24:45,774
The hearts, Axel.

932
01:24:45,878 --> 01:24:49,314
The 300 fucking candy boxes
you used to put the hearts in!

933
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:54,081
It's Tom, Sarah. Tom must have...

934
01:24:54,187 --> 01:24:55,711
Stop it! It's your house, Axel.

935
01:24:55,821 --> 01:24:57,914
The picture of me and Tom,
you took it. It was there.

936
01:24:58,024 --> 01:24:59,252
Tom must have put it there.

937
01:24:59,358 --> 01:25:01,383
Sarah, I've been working
the past 72 hours.

938
01:25:01,494 --> 01:25:03,587
When would I have time to play psycho?

939
01:25:03,696 --> 01:25:04,822
You're the sheriff, Axel.

940
01:25:07,366 --> 01:25:09,163
I mean, you come
and go as you please.

941
01:25:09,268 --> 01:25:10,633
All right, Tom, stay back.

942
01:25:10,736 --> 01:25:13,170
It's okay, Sarah.

943
01:25:13,272 --> 01:25:15,240
- All right...
- The both of you, stop fucking moving!

944
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:19,202
Sarah, look at me.

945
01:25:19,312 --> 01:25:21,746
Shoot him, and he won't move.

946
01:25:21,847 --> 01:25:25,146
What? Axel, we're gonna get you help.

947
01:25:25,251 --> 01:25:27,446
You are so full of shit!

948
01:25:27,553 --> 01:25:29,453
Sarah, stop it. You don't fucking
believe this guy?

949
01:25:29,555 --> 01:25:31,182
Axel, I know you hate me,
and I don't really give a shit,

950
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:33,281
but this is your wife. Stop lying to her!

951
01:25:33,392 --> 01:25:35,883
Shut up! He's crazy!
He was in an institution.

952
01:25:35,995 --> 01:25:38,759
Oh, that's real nice. Nice try.

953
01:25:45,738 --> 01:25:47,603
Fuck it. Just shoot us both.

954
01:25:49,242 --> 01:25:51,005
- What?
- What?

955
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:52,941
Yeah, just shoot us both.

956
01:25:53,045 --> 01:25:54,672
Do it. Come on, it's your only choice.

957
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:57,180
If you just shoot me, Sarah,
you'd still be down here with a killer.

958
01:25:57,283 --> 01:25:59,478
What are you talking about?
Sarah, don't listen to him.

959
01:25:59,585 --> 01:26:00,847
- Sarah, do it.
- He needs help, Sarah.

960
01:26:00,953 --> 01:26:03,285
Do it. You have to do it,
Sarah. Shoot us!

961
01:26:03,389 --> 01:26:04,947
- Nobody's shooting anyone, Axel.
- Shoot us!

962
01:26:05,057 --> 01:26:06,422
- Sarah, listen to me!
- Will you stop it?

963
01:26:06,525 --> 01:26:08,117
No, listen to me!
The words that Megan wrote

964
01:26:08,227 --> 01:26:10,127
in her Valentine, "Be mine forever"?

965
01:26:10,229 --> 01:26:12,493
Those are the same words
written in blood above her dead body.

966
01:26:12,598 --> 01:26:13,656
Isn't that right, Axel?

967
01:26:13,766 --> 01:26:15,324
I'm gonna rip your fucking head off.

968
01:26:18,404 --> 01:26:20,167
How did you know
that Megan was dead?

969
01:26:22,975 --> 01:26:24,237
You told me.

970
01:26:29,048 --> 01:26:30,675
No, I didn't.

971
01:26:35,655 --> 01:26:38,988
And how'd you know about
the words written on the wall?

972
01:26:45,298 --> 01:26:46,356
Sarah...

973
01:26:52,071 --> 01:26:53,333
What is that?

974
01:26:56,676 --> 01:26:59,509
It's him. It's Harry.

975
01:27:00,946 --> 01:27:02,538
It's fucking him. It's...

976
01:27:02,648 --> 01:27:05,446
It's Harry, Sarah.
Sarah, you gotta shoot him.

977
01:27:05,551 --> 01:27:06,677
Sarah, he's right there. Shoot him.

978
01:27:08,054 --> 01:27:10,249
It's Harry, Sarah.
You gotta shoot him.

979
01:27:10,356 --> 01:27:11,914
It's Harry.
There he is. He's right there.

980
01:27:12,024 --> 01:27:14,993

Harry's not here, Tom.

No.

996
01:29:08,574 --> 01:29:09,541
He's here.

997
01:29:11,410 --> 01:29:12,570
Aren't you, Harry?

998
01:29:14,914 --> 01:29:15,881
You living inside Tom?

999
01:29:19,752 --> 01:29:21,219
Oh, I'm right here.

1000
01:29:25,224 --> 01:29:26,486
I fucking knew it.

1001
01:29:26,592 --> 01:29:27,616
Axel.

1002
01:30:54,346 --> 01:30:56,439
Oh, God.

1003
01:30:59,885 --> 01:31:02,752
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

I want to go home.

- Okay.

1010
01:31:54,306 --> 01:31:56,365
There's one bullet left.

1011
01:31:59,311 --> 01:32:00,278
Don't miss.

1012
01:32:12,091 --> 01:32:13,251
Tom.

1013
01:33:13,085 --> 01:33:14,916
Hey, come here.
You better check this out.

Hang in there, buddy.
Help's on the way, okay?

Hey! Help's coming, okay?

1016
01:33:36,842 --> 01:33:38,810
We're gonna get you out of here.

1017
01:33:38,911 --> 01:33:40,310
Can you tell me your n...

1018
01:33:51,757 --> 01:33:52,689
Right this way.

Yeah, yeah.

1020
01:34:07,906 --> 01:34:11,137

- Yeah.

1022
01:34:18,617 --> 01:34:21,279
Hey, Sheriff. Sheriff, look at me.

1023
01:34:22,321 --> 01:34:24,255
Look at me, Sheriff.

1024
01:34:24,356 --> 01:34:25,618
Where's Hanniger?

1025
01:34:30,496 --> 01:34:31,690
Tom's dead.

1026
01:34:40,305 --> 01:34:42,466
I love you.

1027
01:34:42,574 --> 01:34:44,542
I love you, too.
