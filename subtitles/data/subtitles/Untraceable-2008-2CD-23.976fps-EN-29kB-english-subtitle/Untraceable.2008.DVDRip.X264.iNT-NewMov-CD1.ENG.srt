<i>This has been America News</i>
<i>Radio from Washington.</i>

2
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:16,160
<i>Now back to your local</i>
<i>ANR station for news on the hour.</i>

3
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:23,336
<i>Good evening. You're listening</i>
<i>to 108.9 FM, KMZR, Portland. This...</i>

4
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,253
Evening, ma'am.

5
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,951
You, too.

6
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,800
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

7
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,436
- Careful. Careful, it's hot.
- Thank you.

8
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,903
- Busy night for the bad guys?
- Even busier night for us.

9
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,708
Okay.

10
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,109
Let's see what you got for me.

11
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,858
Oh, hey,
because you're dying to know...

12
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:24,122
...l'm almost positive my first date last
night is eligible for the hall of fame.

13
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,332
She was amazing.
She looked exactly like her photo.

14
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,001
You'll never see her again.

15
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,333
- How do you know?
- Because you look nothing like yours.

16
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,303
Nice one.

17
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,357
- Here's that guy I was telling you about.
- Oh, yeah?

18
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,590
He changes his name every day.
It's taken me a week to isolate him.

19
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,394
Listen to this.

20
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,334
- Tunethief. Com.
- Oh, how original.

21
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,201
Yeah, he offers free downloads
of pirated music.

22
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,570
I'm running this
in a fake virtual machine.

23
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,008
Watch what happens
when I accept his offer.

24
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,672
Now, he's stealing my financial data...

25
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,815
...and all my passwords.

26
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,421
Which I happened to have gathered
in a file called "passwords."

27
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,352
Nice touch.

28
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,093
I threw in a backdoor Trojan so
we can see what he's doing with it.

29
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,425
He's run up a quarter-million dollars
in fraud the past three weeks.

30
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,897
- Well, what's he into?
- High-end tech and low-end porn.

31
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,335
God. You sure it's a guy? If it's
a woman, she could be my soul mate.

32
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,939
Send it over to me.

33
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,039
There you go.

34
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,742
My dummy Capital One card.
Hope he goes for it.

35
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,074
Okay, I see it.

36
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,315
I'm surprised he has
the patience for auctions.

37
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,613
- Oh, you've got him now.
- Okay, there's his IP address.

38
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,684
Let's get his physical one.

39
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,057
Portland Police sent this over.
They weren't sure what to do with it.

40
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,720
Thank you.

41
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,401
- It is a woman.
- ER nurse, lives alone.

42
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,067
No priors,
no history of online purchases.

43
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,968
It's not her. Gotta be a neighbor...

44
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,804
...somebody close by, someone
who could access her wireless router.

45
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,970
Sharon Dobbs lives here.

46
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,249
All right. Here we go,
here's somebody.

47
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,652
Sam Barrows. He's a computer
programmer for the school district.

48
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,723
He's lived there six weeks.
He's a renter.

49
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,884
He's registered for three handguns
and two assault rifles.

50
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,086
That's your guy.

51
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:40,198
Jennifer Marsh, FBI Cyber Crimes
up in Portland.

52
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,630
We need you to knock down
a door for us.

53
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,447
Oh, I gotta get reassigned.

54
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,516
What's the matter?

55
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,022
It's just a sickness. It's just too much.

56
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,320
I got this
retired high school principal...

57
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,759
...offering to come over
to where I'm babysitting.

58
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,559
He's got so many chats,
he can't keep his names straight.

59
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,929
He keeps calling me Jill
instead of Molly.

60
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,163
I'm only interested in what his
cellmates are gonna call him.

61
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,136
I'm taking a break. Do you want...?

62
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,776
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

63
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:45,655
All right.

64
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,343
I see feet! Get your hands up!
Get your hands up!

65
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,213
On your stomach! On your stomach!

66
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,396
<i>- On flawless, cut Natalie K diamonds.</i>

<i>Huge savings on one-karat diamonds.</i>
<i>Presented by the LaRog Brothers.</i>

68
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,615
- What the hell is this?
- I don't know. I'm running it down now.

69
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,080
It is streaming live.

70
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,720
Just when you thought
you've seen it all.

71
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,613
Oh, look, a message from our sponsor.

72
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,782
"Ha-ha. Only serious."

73
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,127
Jennifer Marsh, Cyber Crimes.

74
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,865
Carter Thompson here.
I'm at the Barrow residence.

75
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,361
The suspect's in custody.
Hard drive's intact.

76
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,566
<i>- Plenty of contraband.</i>
- Good work. Hey, let me guess.

77
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,008
It's not just Barrow. His son's
involved. He's got a son?

78
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,646
<i>What makes you say that?</i>

79
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,214
Well, high-tech toys and porn...

80
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,147
...and then out of the blue,
he buys a gold wristwatch.

81
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,254
How come? And then it hit me.

82
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:20,984
01-10-57.
Sunday's his father's birthday.

83
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,092
Sweet dreams, Marsh.

00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,367
Yes, Tina.

94
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,227
I'd like to get home
sometime before Easter.

95
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,237
I'm in a traffic jam here.

96
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,433

<i>- You're welcome.</i>

100

Come on, keep it moving.

101
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,822
- Shit, you scared me.
- Watch your mouth, young lady.

102
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,428
Hey, that's what I said to you
when you were a kid.

103
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,800
I know, Mom. That's what
makes it so darn funny.

104
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,702
Oh, somebody's crabby.

105
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,742
Sorry. Long night.

106
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,193
Mom!

107
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,024
- Look at the outfit I'm making.
- I can see that.

108
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,031
- You're stealing my job.
- You were late.

109
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,534
I know. I'm sorry about that, sweetie.

110
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,700
Catch any bad guys?

111
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,839
One. Just one.

112
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,543
Okay, I'm coming.

113
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,848
Slowpoke. The slowest poke
I've ever seen, ever.

114
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,521
I'm coming.

115
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,785
- How are things with you and Maddy?
- Better.

116
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,557
Mrs. Tischler's gonna
give us a second chance.

117
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,169
- A second chance at what?
- Being friends.

118
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,100
Oh, of course. I think that's great.

119
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,772
She can come to my party now.
Make sure to send her mom an Evite.

120
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,911
- You got it.
- Maybe Grandma should do it.

121
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,272
- I'll do it.
- Are you sure?

122
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,574
When I say I'll do it, I'll do it,
okay? I promise.

123
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,911
- I love you.
- I love you, too, babe.

124
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,652
I bet you'd like me
to do this some other time!

125
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,382
Hey, friendly.

126
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,539
All right, Jennifer. Let's see
this tortured kitty of yours.

127
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,648
Torture's over, sir.

128
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,775
- Yeah, I should say so.
- Poor Lulu.

129
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,387
That was the cat's name.

130
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,989
The owner, Scotty Hillman,
26, from West Linn...

131
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,255
...says she was snatched a few days
ago from his lawn during a yard sale.

132
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,364
He recognized her fancy collar.

133
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,124
West Linn. So this site...

134
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,201
...which could have originated
anywhere from Oslo to Istanbul...

135
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,962
Is local. Yes, sir.

136
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,765
The odds of that are pretty steep.

137
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,171
About a million to one, if it were
a coincidence, which it's not.

138
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,472
The only way we found out about this
is because it was tipped...

139
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:45,674
...to the county sheriff's office and the
police within minutes of it going up.

140
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,820
Both tips came from a pay phone
in the central city...

141
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,583
...so whoever is behind the site
is local and wants attention.

142
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,726
- Shut him down.
- I just did.

143
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,454
- There you go.
- I'll type the address in again.

144
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,432
It's been doing that all night.

145
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:13,544
The site's IP changes constantly. Each
new address is an exploited server...

146
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,577
...that's running a mirror of the site.

147
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,643
The site's Russian name server
uses a low TTL...

148
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,843
...so your computer constantly queries
the name server's record.

149
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,353
That's how it gives
you a new address consistently.

150
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,219
There are thousands of exploited
servers on the Internet...

151
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,452
...so he won't run out of victims soon.

152
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,596
He's accessing these machines
so quickly...

153
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,994
...he's got to be
running his own botnet.

154
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,656
We are blackholing these IPs...

155
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,928
...but every time we shut one down,
a new mirror pops up.

156
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,504
I don't understand a single word
you just said.

157
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,437
What does Russia
have to do with this?

158
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,772
The domain registrar
and name servers are all in Russia.

159
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,937
We have no jurisdiction there.

160
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,446
Jennifer...

161
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,380
...it's a cat.
- Yeah.

162
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,919
Considering the state of the world,
aren't there more important things...

163
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,547
...to be concerned about, like
something under our jurisdiction?

164
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,255
Back to work, gentlemen.

165
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:19,269
<i>Things are about to get warmer when</i>
<i>one of the hottest hockey rivalries...</i>

166
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,708
Are you the guy? You got the
extra ticket for the hockey game?

167
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,474
Grandma! Grandma! Grandma!

168
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,166
- Did you get it?
- Yes, I did!

169
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,369
Oh, my God, I'm so proud of you!

170
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,447
And the boy I fought was so tall too.

171
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,881
- Careful, I'm all wet.
- So am I.

172
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,284
We celebrated. We had an ice cream.

173
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,383
Hello.

174
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,554
Mom?

175
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,028
- Honey... Mom, please!
- Okay, okay.

176
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,464
Come on, baby.
Let's get you out of these clothes.

177
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,837
I've been monitoring the site all week.
Nothing but a still of the dead kitten.

178
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,002
Last night around 11, the site
went down, I'd hoped forever.

179
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,708
Anyway, a few minutes ago, this.

180
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,047
It's the same basement
still streaming live.

181
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:48,250
The top is the number of active viewers
and some chemical-dosage flow.

182
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,123
He's carved the name of the website
into the guy's chest.

183
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,888
He's threatening to drain him.

184
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,125
Threatening to drain what, his blood?
How's he gonna do that?

185
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,997
Those letters aren't any deeper
than paper cuts.

186
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,638
Not the cuts, it's the bleeding.

187
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,798
We think that box regulates
the fluid going into the victim.

188
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,809
Those cables are probably
connected to our guy's computer.

189
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,675
Look, his nose is starting
to bleed and he's bruising.

190
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,373
We think those bags have
some anticoagulant in them.

191
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,748
I've got a list of them right here.
The most common is heparin.

192
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:20,085
If you get the dose right, you save a
life. Wrong, you've got a hemophiliac.

193
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:24,393
So the more people who visit the site,
the more the drug is released...

194
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,860
...and the faster he bleeds.

195
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,556
- That's what we believe.
- Well, isn't that wonderful?

196
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:32,261
Well, if that counter is accurate,
the public would seem to agree.

197
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,371
They're tuning in at an alarming rate.

198
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,838
The victim's name
is Herbert Miller, 54.

199
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,376
Lives in Sellwood, works
for Burnside Executive Charter.

200
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:44,482
Friday night, got back from a shuttle
to Mount Hood, called his wife...

201
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,915
...says that he gets an e-mail
from a friend of a friend...

202
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,953
...offering center-ice seats
to the Winter Hawks game.

203
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,148
He promises
he'll be home afterwards.

204
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,190
- He wasn't.
- Any priors?

205
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,886
- Who, Miller?
- Why is that relevant?

206
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,794
Remember that snuff film
sent to the L.A. Office last year?

207
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,834
Teenage geisha cut in two.
Looked as real as anything you saw.

208
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:08,871
Six weeks later, they found her alive
and well, waiting tables in Little Tokyo.

209
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,908
Maybe Miller's involved somehow.
Maybe there's a connection.

210
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,789
What are you doing to me?

211
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,443
Mrs. Miller!

212
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,351
Just go away. Just leave.

213
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,391
- Okay, folks, one side, please.
- I don't know.

214
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,325
Come on. Police.
Coming through. Mrs. Miller.

215
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,855
Back off. Back off. Mrs. Miller.

216
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,661
- Portland Police. May we come in?
- Thank God you're here.

217
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,997
I need you to back off right now.

218
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,574
My name is Detective Box.
This is my partner, Detective Moy.

219
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:22,680
Listen, is there someplace
else we can talk?

220
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,013
Yeah, let's go outside.

221
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,155
Oh, shit. Fuck!

222
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,296
<i>So, Mrs. Miller, when was the</i>
<i>last time you saw your husband?</i>

223
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,688
Yesterday morning.

224
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:47,328
He called, and he said he'd got tickets
to the Winter Hawks game last night.

225
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:51,374
He likes hockey, and I just wanted
him to come straight home.

226
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,704
Okay. Listen...

227
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,440
...I understand what you're going
through is very difficult. All right?

228
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:01,450
But you're making it worse by talking
to the press. Don't talk to the press.

229
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,848
Do you understand? Listen.

230
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,718
Don't talk to the press
and stay off the computer. Okay?

231
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,774
Listen to this. I'm running the logs
from that mirror we took down.

232
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,182
He's blocking all the foreign IPs. Only
Americans can gain access to the site.

233
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,346
How patriotic.

234
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:42,154
We've scanned every newsgroup,
chat room, blog, website and forum...

235
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,922
...referencing "Kill With Me,"
and I think we found our first post.

236
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:49,727
It appeared just before the site went
up, then it was spammed Web-wide.

237
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,461
"A cat caught in a rattrap.
How's that for irony?

238
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,697
It's streaming live on killwithme. Com.
It's awesome. Check it out."

239
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,707
It was posted by a sophomore
named Andrew Kilburn.

240
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,904
It came from his account, but it didn't
actually originate from his computer.

241
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:06,016
So our guy hacked his account
and used it to start the thread.

242
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,379
- Yeah.
- Let's go after the originating IP.

243
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,315
Oh, God.

244
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,358
It's too bad this guy wasn't
a Boy Scout.

245
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,053
He could just blink Morse code
and tell us where he is.

246
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:37,075
Okay, I've got the "who is."
It comes back Blue Sky ISP.

247
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,242
- Username and password, please.
- Coming to you now.

248
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,018
- "Chang's Restaurant"?
- He hacked into their site?

249
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,990
No. No. Half the office eats there.

250
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:53,131
He's messing with us.
He wanted us to find this.

251
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,425
Who the hell is this guy?

252
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,898
Jennifer Marsh, Detective Eric Box.

253
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,271
Portland Police has him
on the Miller abduction.

254
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,813
- Jennifer's our case agent on this.
- Case agent, sir?

255
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,847
- You caught it, you got it.
- Please.

256
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,953
Sir, anyone else. You know I'm
on nights because of my daughter.

257
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,055
I understand that, but you're it.

258
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,188
- We forming a task force?
- Not yet.

259
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,190
Not yet?
How much more do you need?

260
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:27,024
So far we have one dead cat and a man
who may or may not be in danger...

261
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,498
That's today. You think this is it?
It's just the beginning.

262
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,559
Marsh, hold it.

263
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,467
You share what you've got,
and then you take it from there.

264
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,302
Appreciate your coming in, detective.

265
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,577
All right. You first.

266
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,883
Well, we found Miller's car
in the Rose Garden parking lot.

267
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,986
No prints but his own.

268
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,055
We passed out photos of the
basement to some local contractors.

269
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,716
They say, judging from the timbers,
the house was built in the '20s or '30s.

270
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:59,057
Which narrows it down to,
you know, half the city.

271
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,224
Yeah, what else?

272
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:06,131
Miller appears to be a decent guy.
He's a Vietnam vet...

273
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,296
...coaches his daughter's soccer,
they go to church every Sunday.

274
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,601
So why'd the subject pick him?

275
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,069
"Subject"?

276
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,413
Are we in science class?

277
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,878
- What would you prefer?
- How about "piece of shit"?

278
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,976
Why Miller?

279
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,886
I don't know. Maybe it was random.

280
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,888
What about the kitten?
Talk to that guy?

281
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,289
Scotty Hillman, yeah.
He's a fucking jackass.

282
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,862
All he cares about is getting
the kitten's collar...

283
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,966
...because he paid 12 bucks
for it on bidityours. Com

284
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,967
Which I suppose is a lot of money
if you're flipping burgers.

285
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,595
What I would like to know is,
why him? Why his kitten?

286
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:46,141
Why take the risk of stealing when
you can get one free at any shelter?

287
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,375
- What do you guys got?
- It's a website.

288
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,642
It's like nothing we've ever seen.
It's extremely sophisticated.

289
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,911
As long as its source-streaming site
is a ghost, it's untraceable.

290
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,915
This guy can invite the world to help
him kill Miller or anybody...

291
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,924
...and there's not a goddamn thing
we can do about it.

292
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,158
Excuse me.

293
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,910
- It's over.
- Yeah.

294
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,314
The numbers, they just... exploded.

295
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,353
"Rolling on the floor laughing.

296
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:36,687
Thank you for..."

297
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,996
"For all your support.

298
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:41,427
More to come."

299
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,829
Well, we'll see about that.

300
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,038
It's a jungle in there.

301
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:25,438
<i>Hey, I just went to the site</i>
<i>after the guy was dead...</i>

302
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,068
<i>I got a list of assholes my girlfriends</i>
<i>and me think he ought to kill next.</i>

303
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:35,379
<i>Last seen five days ago, FBI agents</i>
<i>have been working around the clock...</i>

304
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,791
There's a pickup truck.

305
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,933
What's that on the back, a gun rack?

306
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:53,101
Yeah, well, there's no way that freak is
stepping foot in my dad's country club.

307
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,102
So call Tucker.

308
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,187
<i>- At 7: 15 a.m., a vehicle at the home...</i>

309
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,087
<i>... of Oregon congressman</i>
<i>Joseph A. Restom.</i>

310
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,229
<i>Herbert Miller had been the focus</i>
<i>of an intense local...</i>

311
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,387
<i>... and statewide police</i>
<i>and FBI search...</i>

312
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:22,931
<i>... since midday Saturday</i>
<i>when he showed up...</i>

313
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,867
...on an Internet website
being tortured and murdered live.

314
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,701
Now, because of the uniqueness
of the crime, and because the FBI...

315
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:34,709
...is able to provide resources
critical to this investigation...

316
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:39,476
...they will be leading the interagency
task force assigned to the case.

317
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:44,582
He flew helicopters for a living. What's
his connection to a U.S. Congressman?

318
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:48,487
Our guy had to dump the body.
Why not on a national stage?

319
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,959
You think he did it to get a press
conference? Build up his fan base?

320
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,121
Don't call them fans.
They're accomplices.

321
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,200
All right, whatever.
Why'd he choose Restom?

322
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:58,699
He's owned by Silicon Valley.

323
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,805
He sits on the House Judiciary
Committee on Net neutrality.

324
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,806
No restriction on content,
all traffic treated equally.

325
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:07,774
- Wouldn't our guy be for that?
- You'd think so.

326
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,914
Miller's clients
were corporate executives.

327
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,548
Maybe some were from high-tech.

328
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,707
I'll track down a customer list.

329
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,820
- What about the neighbors?
- One saw a van drive by at 4 a.m.

330
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,081
Another heard a car door slam
a minute later.

331
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,248
Figured it was the paper
being delivered.

332
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,553
Excuse me a second.
Might have something here.

333
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,128
- What is it?
- Tip just came in through a hot line.

334
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:30,700
Guy named Arthur James Elmer, an
engineer at Chadwick Technologies.

335
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,996
He was fired six months ago...

336
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,639
...for installing a wireless Webcam
in the men's room.

337
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:39,140
Nice. Anyway, he's been talking
about killwithme.com nonstop...

338
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,574
...ever since the kitty died.
Wanna ride with us?

339
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,646
Let me check this guy out
on my end.

340
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,942
- We'll catch up later.
- Yeah.

341
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:18,079
- So, what's going on?
- He won't let us in. Kind of shy.

342
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,181
Elmer.

343
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:33,186
Look, if you didn't do anything,
you got nothing to lose letting us in.

344
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,657
And if you did, we can always
come back with a warrant.

345
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,598
So how do you wanna play it?

346
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,406
Hi.

347
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:54,976
I'm Detective Box.

348
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,383
Unusual name.

349
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,917
Well, it wasn't up to me.

350
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:06,823
So you really think I killed that guy?

351
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,333
I don't know. Did you?

352
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,667
Well, I'm flattered.

353
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:16,000
I found it highly entertaining,
especially at the end.

354
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,233
The way viewership
increased exponentially...

355
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,572
...like some sort of epidemic.

356
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,411
Can I see the basement?

357
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,587
You like movies, huh?

358
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,017
Yeah, who doesn't?

359
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,797
Me.

360
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,097
Burn your own copies?

361
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,793
You know that's illegal, right?

362
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,379
Can't say they didn't warn you.

363
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,227
Got our proof it wasn't Elmer.

364
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,731
Starting Friday at 1 p. M...

365
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:58,099
...Elmer was logged into a chat
room for 12 consecutive hours.

366
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:02,144
At the time Miller disappeared,
Elmer was in a steamy private chat...

367
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:06,113
...with the first tenor of the
Men's Chorus of Greater Tacoma.

368
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,411
It still felt good arresting him.

369
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,909
<i>- Hello?</i>
- I caught you.

370
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:37,480
- Barely. I've got a big date tonight.
<i>- Big, special or big, large?</i>

371
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:41,641
I don't know. I haven't met Peggy
the secretary yet. What's up?

372
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:45,653
<i>I had a thought. Remember that</i>
<i>Andrew Kilburn guy and his review?</i>

373
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,586
Yeah, sure. What about it?

374
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,384
Well, why use his account?

375
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:54,292
I mean, maybe it wasn't random.
Maybe they know each other.

376
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,996
- Yeah, it's possible.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

377
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:00,296
<i>- All right. I'll see you Sunday.</i>
- Wait, Sunday?

378
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:02,798
Annie's birthday.

379
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,500
Oh, shit, I forgot.

380
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:09,043
- Okay, can I bring a date?
<i>- Are you kidding?</i>

381
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,338
You don't even know
if you like this girl.

382
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:14,974
No, not Peggy. Melanie.
She's a social worker.

383
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,713
She likes sushi and rock-climbing
and Dickens.

384
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,518
<i>- I can't believe you.</i>
- It's a numbers game.

385
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:24,320
<i>Fine, fine. I gotta go.</i>

386
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,895
Okay. Hey, you got a date?

387
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:31,058
<i>- Good night.</i>
- Okay. Bye. Good night, Sam.

388
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,981
Molly gave me
a birthday present already.

389
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,051
It's a computer game
that I downloaded.

390
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,246
- It's about horses.
- How sweet of her. That looks like fun.

391
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,248
Not really. It's kind of silly.

392
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,594
- I'll show it to you later.
- Okay, honey. I love you. Gotta run.

393
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,832
Come on, Annie. Let me get one first.

394
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,729
Somebody order a bunch of pizzas?

395
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,268
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

396
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,497
- Hey, Griffin.
- For the birthday girl. Hello.

397
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:45,506
- How are you? Over here?
- Over here.

398
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:51,477
Listen, I only made it through
a few months of Kilburn's posts.

399
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,446
- We'll need more bodies on this.
- Okay.

400
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:58,385
He blogged, he uploaded vids, he
built sites. He practically lived online.

401
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:01,548
- What, not anymore?
- Not since he died...

402
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:05,093
...of something called
diabetic ketoacidosis.

403
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:08,596
Which is what happens when you
don't take your insulin for a few days.

404
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,667
Anyway, an hour after his body
was found...

405
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,996
...Kill With Me went up.

406
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,140
And an hour after that, Kilburn's
review was spammed Web-wide.

407
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:20,175
- And you think our guy killed him?
- The ME called it a suicide.

408
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,798
Hi.

409
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,632
You're right on time.

410
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:52,401
Yeah, well, it's a curse.
I spend half my life waiting for people.

411
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,705
So... Dave Williams.

412
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:02,919
That's a great address, by the way.
Eights bring prosperity.

413
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:05,988
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

414
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,917
- Come in.
- Thanks.

415
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:25,866
Here you go, honey.

416
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,102
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

417
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,976
Detective.

418
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,278
- Hi.
- Hi.

419
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,787
Griffin invited me
to his birthday party.

420
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,520
Yeah. Kind of a young crowd.

421
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,753
Kind of a young crowd, Griffin.

422
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,763
- Well, do you skate?
- No.

423
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,958
- Thank you.
- Yeah, go ahead.

424
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,968
Look, I'm gonna get out of here.
I'm sorry.

425
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:57,972
You just got here. Don't go.
Have some pizza.

426
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:01,111
Come on. It's not that bad.

427
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,951
Wow, you must really like Asia, huh?

428
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,791
Just Korea.

429
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,893
Korea.

430
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,357
Well, it's fabulous.

431
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,127
Thank you.

432
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,874
So you gonna let me see them?

433
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,138
Of course.

434
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,546
Through the kitchen.

435
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:43,949
I gotta tell you, a 710 Pullman
and a 712 Observation Car?

436
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,248
My heart skipped a beat
when I got your e-mail.

437
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:50,588
- Lf they're really in mint condition...
- My dad and I hardly ever used them.

438
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:55,326
We mostly played foosball
and we built things.

439
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,736
Toys, contraptions.

440
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,329
We had a workshop.

441
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,941
He died last year.

442
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,704
Well, I'm sorry.

443
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,363
Annie, would you come over here
for a second? Bring your skates.

444
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,991
Annie, would you come over here
for a second? Bring your skates.

445
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:31,259
- Okay.
- I want you to meet someone.

446
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,764
This is Annie, the birthday girl.
This is my friend, Eric.

447
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,738
- Hello, Annie.
- Hi.

448
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,740
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

449
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,112
You must be, what, 8?

450
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:46,105
How did you know?
Everyone else thinks I'm older.

451
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,885
Well, I'm a detective.

452
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:53,221
- Are you ready to go skating finally?
- I think.

453
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,865
I sure hope you like it.

454
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,669
It's a punching bag.

455
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,072
Okay, so you blow it up...

456
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,476
...and whenever you
get in a really bad mood...

457
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,206
...you sock it in the head.

458
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,575
Can I do karate on it?

459
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,916
Of course you can. You can do karate,
kung fu, tae kwon do.

460
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,116
- Thank you, Griffin.
- You're welcome, sweetie.

461
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,624
That might be my date.

462
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,388
Mom.

463
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,525
Oh, come on.

464
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:40,364
Happy birthday, sweetie.

465
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,698
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

466
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,641
Sweetheart...

467
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,132
...I gotta go.

468
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:50,177
It's a real emergency, or I
would never leave you like this.

469
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,316
- I'll make it up to you, I promise. Okay?
- Okay.

470
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,045
I'm looking for Griffin Dowd. He's...

471
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,211
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

472
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,187
- I'm Melanie.
- Oh, yes. Hi, Melanie.

473
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:04,486
Wow, you are gorgeous.
I'm sorry. I've gotta run.

474
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,984
Todd!

475
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,854
Isn't that your dad?

476
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:51,368
- Same build, same coloring.
- The counter's faster than last time.

477
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,668
Yeah.

478
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,703
I swear I've seen this guy
somewhere before.

479
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,906
- Yeah.
- We all have. He's David Williams.

480
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,108
He used to be
a reporter for Channel 12.

481
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,546
He now hosts a TV show
on public access.

482
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,618
Call Bagley.
Set up a press conference.

483
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,383
Sir, wait just a minute, please.

484
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:11,693
This is what he wants. Anything
you say will promote the site.

485
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,092
That's a possibility,
but what would you prefer?

486
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,857
Talk to National Security Agency.

487
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,831
Their computer capability's
beyond ours. We need their help.

488
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,597
That's fine, but I've got
a man being publicly tortured.

489
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:25,208
How will it look if he dies and the
Bureau never tried to help the guy?

490
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:29,142
Not as bad as if we reach out
and it kills him faster.

491
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,808
You honestly believe
that could happen?

492
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,310
Yes, sir, I do.

493
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,092
I'm sorry, Marsh.

494
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,627
I got no choice.

495
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,558
<i>We're gathered here</i>
<i>to share some information...</i>

496

00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,403
Thank you, chief.

503
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,112
<i>A week ago, a man was killed</i>
<i>in this city.</i>

504
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:47,787
<i>This barbaric, cowardly murder</i>
<i>was streamed live on the Internet.</i>

505
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,860
<i>As part of the killer's design, the more</i>
<i>people who logged on to the site...</i>

506
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:56,466
<i>... to witness the victim's suffering,</i>
<i>the sooner the victim died.</i>

507
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,864
<i>Millions of Americans</i>
<i>chose to visit the site...</i>

508
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:03,735
<i>... believing that they were witnessing</i>
<i>a mere hoax, a stunt or a prank.</i>

509
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,499
<i>Well, unfortunately, it wasn't.</i>

510
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,303
<i>Today a second individual...</i>

511
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,379
<i>... has appeared on the site</i>
<i>and his life, too, is in jeopardy.</i>

512
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:14,005
<i>The victim is the doting father</i>
<i>of two boys...</i>

513
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,219
<i>... a loving husband of 22 years...</i>

514
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:21,847
<i>... and a devoted son. In other words,</i>
<i>he's a good American, one of us.</i>

515
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:26,156
<i>The torture that he is experiencing</i>
<i>now is unimaginable in its cruelty.</i>

516
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,227
<i>We're doing what we can...</i>

517
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:31,562
<i>... to shut down the site</i>
<i>and bring the killer to justice.</i>

518
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:34,737
<i>In the meantime, we ask that</i>
<i>everyone stay away from the site.</i>

519
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,465
Any visit to this site,
no matter how brief...

520
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:39,700
...will only hasten the victim's death.

521
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:45,271
Any American who visits the site
is an accomplice to murder.

522
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,883
<i>We are the murder weapon.</i>

523
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:51,818
<i>- We ask that you spread the word...</i>
- Let's main-screen the website.

524
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,082
Hey, Tim, I think
he's trying to say something.

525
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,594
Eight... Eight...

526
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,636
Eight, eight, eight.

527
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,298
Oh, I get it. It's an address, I think.

528
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:14,935
Eight... Eight-oh-eight...

529
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:16,773
...Newberry.
- Newberry?

530
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,915
There's a Newberry Road
in Laurelhurst.

531
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:45,532
Police! Open the door!

532
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,494
Basement's here!

533
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,103
It's the wrong house.

534
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,950
<i>- Any American who visits the site...</i>
- He was here, though.

535
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,355
<i>... is an accomplice to murder.</i>
<i>We are the murder weapon.</i>

536
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:41,521
<i>Any American who visits the site</i>

<i>Any American...</i>

538
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,967
All right. We should send
Forensics in here.

539
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:53,404
<i>Any American who visits the site</i>
<i>is an accomplice to murder.</i>

540
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,410
<i>We are the murder weapon.</i>

541
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:06,913
Yeah, I understand that. Just
have her check it again, okay?

542
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:10,321
- Six hours. So fast.
- Twice as fast as Miller.

543
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:13,062
Nobody thinks
they did anything wrong.

544
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:18,201
Why should they?
They're curious about a website.

545
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:21,193
You check the headlines,
check the stock market...

546
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,396
...watch some strangers have sex.

547
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,434
See a journalist get his head cut off.

548
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,009
When did the world
go so fucking insane?

549
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:37,212
You've been working
the streets too long.

550
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:42,051
He was definitely here.
He just got moved and didn't know it.

551
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,892
So Mrs. Williams is checking her
husband's e-mail for us.

552
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,796
She says he was contacted about the
trains through the public TV website.

553
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:59,873
I guess in his bio, he mentions he's
a collector. That was about a week ago.

554
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,503
Who owns the house?

555
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:07,514
Tom Park, 60s, widower. He's out
of town visiting family in South Korea.

556
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,847
He runs a local market here.
He makes the trip every year.

557
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,719
So our guy's a customer.

558
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,049
We're trying to get ahold of Mr. Park,
see if he knows anything.

559
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,355
We'll do a canvass. Seems like
a pretty tight-knit community.

560
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,122
Maybe somebody saw something.
