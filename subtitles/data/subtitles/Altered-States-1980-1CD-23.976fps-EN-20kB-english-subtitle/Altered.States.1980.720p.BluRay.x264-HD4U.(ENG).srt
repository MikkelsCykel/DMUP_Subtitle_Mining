1
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,440
The tank itself was unusual
in that it was vertical...

2
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,530
...and looked like an old boiler.

3
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,700
Inside the tank,
the subject wore a heavy glass bubble.

4
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,370
You would have thought the whole
contraption uncomfortable to say the least.

5
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,990
It was, however, effective.

6
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,750
Of the 23 students tested,
only two found the experience unpleasant.

7
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,290
Some even called it exhilarating.
A number of students hallucinated.

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,590
Dr. Jessup found the encephalographic
evidence especially interesting.

9
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,140
And one Saturday afternoon,
in April 1967...

10
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,300
...he decided to try
the experience for himself.

11
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,560
Arthur. Hey, Arthur.

12
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,480
Are you there?

13
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,820
Can you hear me, Arthur?

14
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Arthur, answer me.

15
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,910
Is that it? You want me
to come in and get you out?

16
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,370
Yeah.

17
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,750
I want to get a look at those EEG tracings.

18
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,880
All right. How do you feel?

19
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,550
Not bad.

20
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,300
I hallucinated like a son of a bitch.

21
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,350
A variety of dream states,
mystical states.

22
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,020
A lot of religious allegory,
mostly out of Revelation.

23
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,190
You were in there close to five hours.

24
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,150
- Lt felt like an hour.
- Ý'd like to try that myself sometime.

25
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,770
You should. You'll like it.

26
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,240
Did we have any communication?

27
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,530
Oh, sure. L kept checking you out
like you told me to.

28
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,120
How'd l respond?

29
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,040
Very orderly.
At one point you were crying.

30
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,410
You mean actually crying?

31
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,790
You were sobbing.
There were tears on your face.

32
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,380
When I asked you what was going on...

33
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,130
...you said you were re-experiencing
your father's death.

34
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,930
- Did you make notes?
- Lt's all there.

35
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,850
I'd like to try this again next week.

36
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,270
Do you think you could make it again
next week?

37
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,930
What are we looking for?

38
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,940
I don't know, yet.

39
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,860
There's really very little literature
on this kind of research.

40
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,150
There's some good people in the field,
Tart, Ornstein and Deikman...

41
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,530
...but most of it is radical-hip stuff,
drug-culture apologias.

42
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,910
Obviously, the first thing to do
is set up some sensible methodology.

43
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,830
Study these experiences
under controlled conditions.

44
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,630
It won't interfere with the work
we're doing with Hobart.

45
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,130
What are we getting into? A new
sensory deprivation? Ýsolation studies?

46
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Where will we be going
with the tank stuff?

47
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,340
We're not writing up a grant.
Strictly bootlegging, for kicks.

48
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,510
As long as we've got
the use of this tank...

49
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,720
...let's play around with it.
Let's find out where it takes us.

50
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,520
It's fascinating stuff, Arthur.
I think we ought to get into it.

51
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,360
I didn't even know they had one of those
isolation tanks at New York Hospital.

52
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,730
Must be some guy
in the psychology department...

53
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,190
...doing sensory deprivation studies.

54
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,700
What's Jessup doing with it?

55
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,700
You've got me. He's been taking students
out of his classes and testing them.

56
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,870
He's been doing this
for three, four months.

57
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,790
- Did you know...
Arthur.

58
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,330
...Jessup was into this stuff?
- Not until you told me.

59
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,290
Arthur?
- What do you want, honey?

60
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,130
How long are you going to let it ring?

61
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,050
It's okay, I'll get it.

62
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,130
He's the last guy
to be screwing around...

63
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,100
...with anything as flaky
as altered states of consciousness.

64
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,520
Well, let's face it.
Jessup is pretty flaky himself.

65
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,440
That's him.

66
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,000
Arthur says you're very shy.
He wants me to draw you out.

67
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,800
Draw me out?
That doesn't sound like Arthur.

68
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,630
Well, what he actually said was
you were a high-handed, arrogant prick.

69
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,640
A little nuts, but brilliant...

70
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,220
...and that if l ever got you talking,
I would find you fascinating.

71
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,060
That sounds more like Arthur.

72
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,440
He says you're doing some work
at Payne Whitney.

73
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,400
- Yes.
- What sort of work?

74
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,900
Toxic metabolite stuff, replicating
Heath's and Friedhoff's strategies...

75
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,740
...to find maverick substances
specific to schizophrenia.

76
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,990
We're chasing our tails. What do you do?

77
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,910
I'm a physical anthropologist,
sweating out my dissertation.

78
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,990
- Where?
- Columbia.

79
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,290
Holloway and that bunch.

80
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,830
You're kind of young for a Ph.D.,
aren't you?

81
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,210
- Ý'm 24.
- That's still pretty good.

82
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,550
I didn't get my Ph.D. until
I was 25 and I'm supposed to be a whiz kid.

83
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,010
I'm a whiz kid, too.

84
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,640
Anthropology seems to attract
good-looking women.

85
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,770
So you don't think schizophrenia can be
reduced to a single etiological agent?

86
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,400
I'm not even sure it's a disease.

87
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,530
You think madness is simply
another state of consciousness?

88
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,450
There's a body of evidence
to support that.

89
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,290
You don't like to talk
about your work, do you?

90
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,450
As a rule, no.

91
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,380
I've always been interested
in interior experiences.

92
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,000
Especially religious experience.

93
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,260
The reason I'm working
with schizophrenics...

94
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,760
...is that religious experience
is so significant in schizophrenia.

95
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,970
There's only so much
you can do with animals.

96
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,020
Monkeys can't tell you what's going on
in their consciousness.

97
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,980
You need human beings for that.

98
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,860
You're not allowed to ablate humans,
you can't stick electrodes in their skulls.

99
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,480
I have to use some kind
of trance-inducing technique.

100
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,030
The isolation tank
seemed the least risky. Listen...

101
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,660
... I'd like to go home with you tonight.
Would that be all right with you?

102
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,790
I've got a roommate.
We'll be confined to the living-room couch.

103
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,620
What's wrong
with the living-room couch?

104
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,380
You tend to slip off a lot.

105
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,840
I'm sure we'll manage.

106
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,920
Yeah, I'm sure we will.

107
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,430
So whenever you want to go there,
you let me know.

108
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,850
- How about right now?
- Heh.

109
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,070
What are you thinking about?

110
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,660
God.

111
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,450
Jesus, crucifixions.

112
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,130
As a rule, do you usually think about...

113
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,090
...Christ and crucifixions
under sexual stress?

114
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,600
When I was 9 years old,
I used to see visions.

115
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,520
Visions of saints and angels,
even Christ himself.

116
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,860
Of course, I don't do that anymore.

117
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,610
Not since I was 16.

118
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,370
Were your parents religious?

119
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,120
Anything but.

120
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,210
My father was an aeronautical engineer.
My mother, a clinical psychologist.

121
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,920
What happened?

122
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,130
I mean, how did a little kid who saw
visions of Christ turn into a physiologist...

123
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,710
...teaching at the Cornell Medical College?
- L stopped believing.

124
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,590
It was very dramatic.

125
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,760
My father died a protracted
and painful death of cancer.

126
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,730
I was 16 years old
and very fond of my father.

127
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,230
I used to race to the hospital
every day after school...

128
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,940
...and sit in his room doing my homework.

129
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,280
He was very heavily sedated.

130
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,150
The last few weeks he was in coma.

131
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,620
One day l thought
I heard him say something.

132
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,120
I got up and leaned over him...

133
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,120
...my ear an inch away from his lips.

134
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,670
"Did you say something, Pop?"

135
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,130
Then l heard the word he was desperately
trying to say, a soft hiss of a word.

136
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,090
He was saying:

137
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,430
"Terrible."

138
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,650
"Terrible."

139
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,610
So the end was terrible,
even for the good people like my father.

140
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,410
So the purpose of all our suffering
was just more suffering.

141
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:36,500
By dinnertime, l had dispensed with God
altogether. I never saw another vision.

142
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,590
I haven't told anybody
about this in 10 years.

143
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,850
I'm telling you now
because l want you to know...

144
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,470
...what sort of a nut
you might be getting mixed up with.

145
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,600
Arthur was right.

146
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,770
You are a fascinating bastard.

147
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,380
Dad! Dad! Dad!

148
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,340
- Hi.
- Hi.

149
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,630
Well, it's settled.

150
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,350
Metcalfe spoke to Spencer this morning
and it's definite. The job's mine.

151
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,180
I'll be in Nairobi doing
my post-doc work July and August.

152
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,480
And in September,
I'll be teaching at Harvard.

153
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,850
Terrific.

154
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,020
So looks like we'll both be teaching
at Harvard in September.

155
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,020
Looks that way.

156
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:53,150
Well, you can't get any tidier
than that, can you?

157
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,910
We're gonna be together in Boston,
and l think we should get married.

158
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,120
You know, of course,
I'm supposed to be a little bit nuts.

159
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,000
A little bit?
You're an unmitigated madman.

160
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,720
You don't have to tell me how weird
you are. I know how weird you are.

161
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,930
I'm the girl in your bed
the past two months.

162
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,600
Even sex is a mystical experience
for you. You carry on like a flagellant...

163
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,640
...which can be very nice, but l sometimes
wonder if it's me that's being made love to.

164
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,650
I feel like I'm being harpooned by some
raging monk in the act of receiving God.

165
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,900
And you are a Faust-freak, Eddie.

166
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,740
You'd sell your soul
to find the great truth.

167
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,080
Well, human life
doesn't have great truths.

168
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,790
We're born in doubt. We spend our lives
persuading ourselves we're alive.

169
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,090
And one way we do that is
we love each other, like I love you.

170
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,840
I can't imagine living without you.

171
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,760
So let's get married, and if it turns out
to be a disaster, it'll be a disaster.

172
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,100
We'll shake hands and say good-bye.

173
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,100
He's giving her dimethyltryptamine.

174
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,440
It takes effect in about a minute
and she'll trip out for about half an hour.

175
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,450
Do you feel different now?

176
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,780
Yes.

177
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,700
Less anxious?

178
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,290
Much less.

179
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,460
Do you have any special feelings?

180
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,920
I feel...

181
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,840
...like my heart
is being touched by Christ.

182
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,650
There's a lot of religious delusion
among acute schizophrenics.

183
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,030
Some say schizophrenics
are physically different from the rest of us.

184
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,530
It's almost as if they were trying
to change their physical selves...

185
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,530
...to adapt to their schizophrenic image
of themselves.

186
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,130
All right, we'll get married,
since it's that important to you.

187
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,340
I'm not comfortable with women...

188
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,670
...and I'm not likely to find anyone
half as remarkable as you again.

189
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,260
I think I can make
a reasonably good husband.

190
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,020
I don't want to lose you, you see.

191
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,810
I suppose that's the closest thing
to a declaration of love...

192
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,900
...that l will ever get out of you.

193
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,700
Am l really that weird in bed?

194
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,710
Sometimes.

195
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,080
Shall l try to change?

196
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,710
No, I kind of like it.

197
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,360
Daddy, I'm tired.
We'll give the lady a ride.

198
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,820
- Whoa! Oh!
Hey, Mason, be careful.

199
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,950
How you doing, Eddie?
- Hi, Mason. How about a beer?

200
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,750
- Lf I didn't see this, l wouldn't believe it.
- You weren't supposed to be here.

201
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,300
Hi, what's your name?
My name's Mason Parrish. This is Margaret.

202
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,970
Mason, Arthur Rosenberg
I'm always telling you about.

203
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,140
- How are you?
- Mason Parrish, nice to meet you.

204
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,770
Look at the family man.
Oh, why, Eddie, you look so wonderful.

205
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,860
I don't believe it.
Not again. When did this happen?

206
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,110
- Lt's a long story.
- You look wonderful.

207
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,860
Have you found a place yet?

208
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,280
We got a nice little place
near Huntington Field.

209
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,950
It's been seven years
since we moved to San Francisco.

210
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,030
Arthur's gonna to teach at Boston U.
Eddie's been telling me.

211
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,080
I hear you just got associate professor.

212
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,750
You guys must be loaded.
Two professors in one family.

213
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,460
We've got a place in Maine
you can use for the summer.

214
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,880
I'm going to Africa again.
Eddie'll be in Mexico.

215
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,630
You know a guy named Eccheverria,
University of Mexico?

216
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,550
- He worked with you in California.
- Sure. Bright young guy.

217
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,390
He's here at the museum.
We'll all have to get together.

218
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,800
I'm going back to Mexico
with him in June.

219
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,970
What's in Mexico?

220
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,480
Eccheverria's got this witch doctor
down there, the Hinchi Indians.

221
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,360
They're an isolated tribe in Central Mexico
who practice ancient Toltec rituals.

222
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,940
Sacred mushroom ceremonies,
that kind of thing.

223
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,610
Apparently they use some kind
of hallucinatory drug...

224
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,240
...that is supposed to evoke
a common experience in all users.

225
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,530
Maggie's fallen asleep on the couch.
Will you take care of her?

226
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,080
Sure.

227
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,790
Did you ever get into an isolation tank
since New York?

228
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,250
No. Did you?

229
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,080
No, but they've got one here
at the medical school.

230
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,880
I didn't think anybody was doing
those studies anymore.

231
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,550
We did interesting stuff
in that tank in New York...

232
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,510
...for the months we played with it.

233
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,430
Maybe when l get back from Mexico
we'll get into it again.

234
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,350
Why not.

235
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,360
A terrific housekeeper she's not.

236
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,990
- They're getting a divorce, you know.
- Who?

237
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,070
- L don't know if they're actually-
- What are you talking about?

238
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,910
She and the kids are moving to Cambridge.
That's why this place is such a mess.

239
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,500
They're moving her stuff
into storage tomorrow.

240
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,540
Then she's going off to Africa
for a year with the kids...

241
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,170
...and he's going to Mexico.

242
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,840
When she comes back, she's gonna live
in Cambridge and he's staying here.

243
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,720
It's him wants the divorce, not her.

244
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,050
I'm surprised
they stayed together this long.

245
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,760
When did all this happen?

246
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,720
She just told me five minutes ago.

247
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:57,390
What about all those letters she kept
writing us about how happy they were?

248
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,020
Don't ask me. She's still crazy about him.
He's still crazy.

249
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,160
- Listen, Sylvia just-
- Shh.

250
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,910
Sylvia just told me
you're getting a divorce.

251
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,660
Well, we're getting separated.

252
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,080
We won't get to the divorce
until next year.

253
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,050
Well, look, I mean, I know
it's none of my business, but why?

254
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,380
You are married to a great woman
who adores you.

255
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,510
My God, if anybody has it made,
you have.

256
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,600
You are a respected
and an admired figure.

257
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,930
A full professor on the faculty
of the Harvard Medical School.

258
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,560
For God's sake, is that how you imagine
me? A respected and admired figure?

259
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,440
A devoted father? A loving husband?

260
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,110
I've also published nearly two papers
a year for the last seven years...

261
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,780
...and not a fundamental piece of work
in the lot.

262
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,620
I sit around the living rooms
of other young married faculty members...

263
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,290
...talking infantile masturbation:
"Who's sucking up...

264
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,830
...to the head of the department?"
"Whose tenure is hanging by a thread?"

265
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,170
Emily is content to go on with this life.

266
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,750
She insists she's in love with me,
whatever that is.

267
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,420
What she means is
she prefers the senseless pain...

268
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:13,140
...we inflict on each other to the pain
we would otherwise inflict on ourselves.

269
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,560
But I'm not afraid of that solitary pain.

270
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,890
If l don't strip myself of all this clatter
and clutter and ridiculous ritual...

271
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,610
... l shall go out of my fucking mind.

272
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,030
- Does that answer your question, Arthur?
- What question was that?

273
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,070
- You asked me why I was getting divorced.
- Oh, listen, it's your life.

274
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,700
I'm sorry I even asked.

275
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,910
Listen...

276
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,830
...why don't l call Eccheverria
and we'll all go out and have some dinner?

277
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,130
As a matter of fact, Eduardo,
my year in India was disappointing.

278
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,840
Yoga is still a state-specific technology...

279
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,630
...operating in the service
of an a priori belief system.

280
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,930
We scientists have a moral obligation to
the public as well as to our own research.

281
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,350
It just never occurred to baboons
that they could shorten that time...

282
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,640
...to five minutes if they used a stick.

283
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:06,480
Originally, man was just another
savanna-living primate like the baboon.

284
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,520
What dignifies the yogic practices...

285
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,240
...is that the belief system itself
is not truly religious.

286
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,320
There is no Buddhist God, per se.

287
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:20,200
It is the self, the individual mind, that
contains immortality and ultimate truth.

288
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,200
What is not religious about that?

289
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,830
You've simply replaced God
with the original self.

290
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,960
But we've localized it. We know
where the self is, in our minds.

291
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,340
It's a form of human energy.
Our atoms are six billion years old.

292
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,840
We've got six billion years
of memory in our minds.

293
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,090
- Hydrogen atoms are older-
- Memory is energy.

294
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,220
It doesn't disappear. It's still in there.

295
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,310
There's a physiological pathway
to our earlier consciousnesses.

296
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,230
There has to be. I'm telling you,
it's in the limbic system.

297
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,060
Jessup, you are a wacko.

298
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,980
What's wacko about it?
I'm a man in search of his true self.

299
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,110
- How archetypically American can you get?
- Ha, ha, ha.

300
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,910
Everybody's looking for their true selves.
We're all trying to fulfill ourselves...

301
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,580
...understand ourselves,
get in touch with ourselves...

302
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,080
...face the reality of ourselves,
explore ourselves, expand ourselves.

303
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,920
Ever since we dispensed with God...

304
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,130
...we've got nothing but ourselves
to explain this meaningless horror of life.

305
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,800
You're a wacko.

306
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,340
Well, l think that that true self...

307
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:21,310
...that original self, that first self,
is a real, mensurate, quantifiable thing...

308
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,730
...tangible and incarnate...

309
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,060
...and I'm going to find the fucker.

310
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:56,470
What are their chemical properties?
Are they safe?

311
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,340
The mushrooms
are almost certainly Amanita muscaria...

312
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,640
...a very powerful psychedelic,
and a little dangerous.

313
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,140
It contains belladonna-like alkaloids...

314
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,850
...atropine, scopolamine.

315
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,860
The sinicuichi plant is highly regarded...

316
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,610
...among a number of Indian tribes.
I've seen it as far north as Chihuahua.

317
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,530
The Indians say it evokes old memories.

318
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,660
Even ancient ones.

319
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,210
And the Hinchis call it the first flower.

320
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,090
- The first in the sense of primordial?
- Yes.

321
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,380
In the sense of the most ancient.

322
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,220
I'd like to try it.

323
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,640
Do you think they'd let me
join their ritual?

324
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,890
Well, they seem like agreeable people.

325
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,580
It's all right for you
to participate in the ceremony.

326
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,790
Good. Ask him what kind of an experience
I can expect.

327
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Are they gathering mushrooms
for the ritual?

328
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,710
No, they're being
harvested for next year.

329
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,340
Brujo!

330
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,480
Your soul will return to the first soul.

331
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,900
Ask him what this first soul will look like.

332
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,240
He is unborn stuff.

333
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,120
Then you will propel into the void.

334
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,420
You will see a spot.

335
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,420
Uh, the spot will become a crack.

336
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,760
This is the crack between the nothing...

337
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,690
...and out of this nothing
will come your unborn soul.

338
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,600
He wants you to hold the root.
Put out your hand with the palm up.

339
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,280
Ah! Ugh!

340
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,000
Eduardo!

341
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,260
- Jesus Christ.
- Are you all right?

342
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,970
- We only have their word l killed a lizard.
- Oh, no.

343
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,850
You didn't see it
and l have no recollection of it.

344
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,180
This whole business is just a joke
the Indians have played on me...

345
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,180
...to make the gringo look like a fool.

346
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,850
Look, you asked me what happened
and l told you.

347
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,320
You drank the mixture
and you went outside.

348
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,240
After a while there was a scream
and some dogs were barking.

349
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,900
I started after you.

350
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,660
The screaming stopped
and the brujo yelled to come back.

351
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,620
- Oh, bullshit.
- Then why did you ask the brujo...

352
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,160
...to give you the mixture
to take back to Boston?

353
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:36,500
I thought I'd like Arthur to analyze,
maybe synthesize it.

354
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,170
The noise is stupefying.

355
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,990
The sun became black...

356
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,200
...as sackcloth.

357
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,580
The full moon became like blood.

358
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,840
Then the great mountain,
burning with fire...

359
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,840
...was thrown into the sea.

360
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,310
And the beast ascends
from the bottomless pit.

361
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,480
The angel of the bottomless pit.
His name is Abaddon.

362
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,320
Abaddon.

363
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,070
He is off the wall.
Are you okay?

364
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,080
Get this stuff. It's new.

365
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,710
It's deafening. The noise is deafening.

366
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,920
Can you hear me above this noise?

367
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,880
Oh, my God.
The most unbelievable thing I've seen.

368
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:08,260
I'm watching the birth agony
of a mountain.

369
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,720
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

370
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,930
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

371
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,270
Do you want me to bring you down now?

372
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,650
What happens now?

373
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:26,690
He's blacked-out.
His blackouts can get pretty freaky.

374
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,780
Sometimes they last
as long as four hours.

375
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,320
When he comes out, he's chipper
as a bird but doesn't remember a thing.

376
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,490
Just how dangerous is this stuff
he brought back from Mexico?

377
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,040
I didn't say dangerous, l said it
was weird. Hangs around too long.

378
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,330
And what's really screwy is
it heads straight for the brain.

379
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,880
Well, l don't believe this.

380
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,380
You guys are shooting up an untested
drug that stacks up in the brain...

381
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:51,630
...works in the nucleus of the cell,
and don't call that dangerous?

382
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,050
For the record,
we don't actually shoot up.

383
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,760
- Heh, heh, heh.
- Eddie drinks a 10-

384
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,350
It's gonna stop now.

385
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,980
You guys are supposed to be scientists,
not two kids in the dorm...

386
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,810
...freaking out on Mexican mushrooms.

387
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,570
Well, why do you think I called you for?
Let's see you stop him.

388
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,160
This ain't LSD, goddamn it.

389
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,830
This ain't no serotonin antagonist
you're drinking.

390
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,700
How many grams of that
you think you've already got in you?

391
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,870
Two? Three?

392
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,250
You could be working up
a case of cancer...

393
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,630
...with a truckload
of antimetabolites in you.

394
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,010
The Hinchi Indians have done it
for centuries with no cancer.

395
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,300
Fuck the Hinchi Indians.

396
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,470
You don't know anything
about those mushrooms.

397
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,180
Sounds like they have staying power.

398
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,220
We've shot up 30 rats with that stuff.

399
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,310
Some of them have
a whopping load in them.

400
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,520
None of them have been
noticeably affected.

401
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,440
Where are we going now?
I thought we were gonna eat.

402
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,480
Eddie wants to show me an isolation tank.

403
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,860
Isolation tank. You guys get flakier
every time l talk to you.

404
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,570
All that isolation-tank stuff
went out in the'60s...

405
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,870
...with Timothy Leary
and all them other gurus.

406
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,120
Will you shut up for a minute
and let somebody else say something?

407
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,000
What happens during these
blackouts...

408
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,210
...is you feel phenomenal acceleration...

409
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:07,250
...like you're being shot out over millions,
billions of years.

410
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,090
Time simply obliterates.

411
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,170
You sense the hallucination is going on,
but you get no images.

412
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,050
I want to break through that barrier.

413
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,840
I want to know what those images are
that I know are going on but l can't see.

414
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,220
We can't raise the dosage of the drug,
we're close to toxic level now.

415
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,770
The only way to intensify the experience
is to take the 200 milligrams...

416
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,270
...in conjunction with the tank.

417
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,440
There's more I'd like to do to that drug.

418
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,820
- A half-life determination.
That'd take a year.

419
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,690
I'd like to know
the transport system. Find some analogues.

420
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,450
All l know is this stuff
is an extraordinary substance.

421
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,620
Every instinct l have tells me
I'm onto something hot here.

422
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,080
And another 200 milligrams
isn't going to kill anybody.

423
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,750
There it is.

424
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,750
Oh, it's horizontal.

425
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,970
It's smaller than the one
we had in New York.

426
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,300
lf they do sleep studies,
it must be wired for sound.

427
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:02,560
Don't think anybody's used it in
years, but l checked it, it works.

428
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,600
Won't take a week
to get this functioning.

429
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,940
If it ever gets out you use
an untested drug on human subjects...

430
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,110
Don't worry. Nothing's gonna
happen to me. Let's get a hamburger.

431
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,480
- Told one kid in class l might see her.
- All right.

432
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,660
Do what you want to do.
I think you're both irresponsible as hell.

433
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,700
Don't call me and tell me you're worried
about Eddie putting all this shit into him.

434
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:25,950
I tell you now, don't you put
any more of that shit into him...

435
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,660
...until you know more about it.

436
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:30,790
I've offered you the use of my lab
and all the rats you can cut.

437
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,800
That's as much as l want to be implicated
in your experiments.

438
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,460
You get your own dumb hamburger.

439
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:38,010
I already got my own date
I'm an hour late for.

440
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,310
I already did these first three.
You do the rest.

441
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,700
Well, well, well.

442
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,490
Couldn't resist, right?

443
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,000
Well, somebody's gotta keep
on eye on you two sorcerers.

444
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,710
What have you got in there,
some salt solution?

445
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,090
Ten percent magnesium sulfate,
for buoyancy.

446
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,680
- Weird, man.
- Excuse me, Mason.

447
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,980
One, two, three, four.

448
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,390
One, two, three, four.

449
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,440
Okay, you're fine.

450
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,190
Wednesday, January 7, 4:28 p.m.

451
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,070
Hey, this is terrific.

452
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,740
I'm on a plateau.

453
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,120
Went into beta like a shot.
No spindling, nothing.

454
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,200
Grasslands, savannas.

455
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,160
l feel...

456
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:55,340
...l am actually alive
and inside this landscape.

457
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,300
A density of woodlands
about a mile away.

458
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,380
Beyond that,
mountains that seem to be smoking.

459
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:05,720
Newly born mountains,
Cenozoic, latter Tertiary.

460
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,850
I'm in an edge area.

461
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,230
Utter tranquility, but alive.

462
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,690
Life in the trees. Life in the sedge.

463
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,060
Oh, my God...

464
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,900
...the birth of man. That's got to be it.

465
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:23,030
My God. There it is...

466
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,200
...a protohuman.

467
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:29,160
The first and original truly human form.

468
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,620
Tiny, perhaps four feet high,
completely furred...

469
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:37,250
...chimp-like, but erect.
No knuckle-walking. Shorter arms.

470
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,800
He's moving along so gracefully.

471
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,590
There's two, three of them.

472
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:47,260
Bipedal, tiny, little furred
humanoid creatures.

473
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,890
Got a chunk of lava
in their hands. They're...

474
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,440
...stalking or hunting something.

475
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:56,810
For chrissake.

476
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,770
Are you okay, Eddie?

477
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,320
I'm becoming one of them.
I'm no longer observing.

478
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,570
I'm one of them.

479
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm killing- Ý'm killing a goat.

480
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,710
I'm killing...

481
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,710
I'm eating...

482
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,880
I'm eating the blood, hot flesh of a goat.

483
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:28,220
Are you okay?

484
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:31,470
Ho, ho, ho. Beautiful. Beautiful.

485
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,100
- Do you want to come down?
- No.

486
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,990
It sounded like he was having
a bad trip to me.

487
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,790
Some of these tank trips
can get pretty creepy.

488
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,540
What the hell was that?

489
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,750
You okay?

490
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,670
Beautiful.

491
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,670
- Do you want to stop this?
- No.

492
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,220
- Do you want me to leave you alone?
- Yeah.

493
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,860
I thought you said these things don't last
more than four hours.

494
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:32,870
- Lt's quarter to 9.
- He's coming out.

495
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:39,040
I don't like being out of contact
for these long periods of time.

496
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:50,590
I think he's in shock.

497
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,260
He must have had a seizure,
hit his head or something.

498
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,310
Now, hold on.

499
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,620
What do you want blood tests for?

500
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,960
- What's he say?
- "Buccal smear, blood for a karyotype...

501
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,420
...also pictures for
the Goodman and Sarich's lab.

502
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,460
Pictures of my neck, now, before l...

503
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,510
...reconstitute."
- Before he what?

504
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,430
Before he reconstitutes.

505
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,720
Then take his damn blood,
and maybe he'll let me have a look at him.

506
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,600
Do you mind if l examine your neck
for a minute?

507
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,480
- Any masses?
- No.

508
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,820
Oh, stop talking shit.

509
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:35,240
You trying to say
your hallucination externalized?

510
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:38,410
- What did he write?
- "Not common aphasia.

511
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,950
Time-space fallout
from the hallucination."

512
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,330
You are a fucking flake, Jessup.

513
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,540
Get dressed.
I'm gonna take you to Brigham...

514
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,420
...and do a complete workup on you.

515
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,090
You are a very sick dude,
you dumb son of a bitch.

516
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,260
I'll look down your throat,
do some films...

517
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:57,390
...get a CAT scan,
maybe an arteriogram...

518
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,470
...and I'd like an unbiased eye
to look at those EEG tracings.

519
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,810
What's he say?

520
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,350
"X-ray."

521
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,980
All right, finish up with him, Arthur,
and let's get him over to x-ray.

522
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,070
Be right back.

523
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,180
Is it possible it's mechanical?

524
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:44,310
Well, if it isn't neurological,
it's got to be mechanical.

525
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,650
I'd like some plain films of this guy's neck.
A PA, a lateral and oblique.

526
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,730
- Doctor, I'm backed up to my ass.
- Just take the damn pictures.

527
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,570
- This is an emergency.
- Okay.

528
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,840
Might be a TIA.

529
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,090
I guess we'd better not
tell Eddie he had...

530
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:21,350
...blood all over his face when he came
out of the tank. He'll claim it was...

531
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:25,060
...goat's blood from that goat
he was eating in his hallucination.

532
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,560
You know, you're really getting
as weird as he is.

533
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,810
Well, what do you think happened?

534
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,520
He's not the type
for hysterical conversion.

535
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:33,730
I'm thinking seizure.

536
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,700
He came out of that tank in a fugue state
and had blood all over his face.

537
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,990
He must have had a seizure
while in the tank...

538
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,410
...bit his lip while convulsing,
and is postictally aphasic.

539
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:48,210
I thought maybe he had a vascular insult,
a stroke, a flipped embolus...

540
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:52,130
...but neurologically he's intact,
so I'm thinking seizure now.

541
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,960
Hm.

542
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,520
Now you just take it easy.

543
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,350
None of us are so terrific
at reading x-rays.

544
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,770
What are you looking for?

545
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,730
Put these in an envelope.
Who's reading tonight in Radiology?

546
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,110
Dr. Wissenschaft.

547
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,820
I want someone reliable to look at them.

548
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:22,030
I'd rather not have everyone in on this.

549
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,490
It's bad enough we've got
this x-ray technician.

550
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,790
Are you all right?

551
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,830
I'm fine. I tried to indicate
this was just a transient thing.

552
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,540
A transient ischemic attack,
that's what it was.

553
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:34,420
- He's got his voice back.
- Lt wasn't an ischemic attack.

554
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,710
It wasn't a seizure.
You saw the x-rays, Mason.

555
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,220
There was something anterior to
the larynx, looked like a laryngeal sac.

556
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,890
That's strictly simian.
I obviously regressed...

557
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:46,430
...to some quasi-simian creature.

558
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,860
I'm gonna show these to someone.
You're reading them wrong. That's all.

559
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,360
No one is going to tell me...

560
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,190
...you de-differentiated
your goddamn genetic structure...

561
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,200
...for four goddamn hours
and then reconstituted.

562
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,030
I'm a professor of endocrinology
at Harvard Medical School.

563
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,910
I'm an attending physician
at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital.

564
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,210
I'm a contributing editor to the
American Journal of Endocrinology.

565
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:15,380
And I'm a fellow and vice president of the
Eastern Association of Endocrinologists...

566
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,840
...and president of the Journal Club!

567
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,800
I'm not going to listen to any more...

568
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:24,840
...of your cabalistic, quantum,
frigging, dumb, limbo mumbo jumbo.

569
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:27,220
I'm gonna show these to a radiologist.

570
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:42,280
- Do me a favor.
- Conclusion: bilateral aspiration pneumonia.

571
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:46,570
- Do me a favor and take a look at these.
- What's the story of this case?

572
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:52,000
A 35-year-old white male, acute onset
of aphasia, no history of trauma.

573
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,460
What are you looking for?

574
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:57,670
It looks to me like the architecture
is somewhat abnormal.

575
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,130
Somewhat?

576
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,630
This guy is a fucking gorilla.

577
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,500
Are you okay, Dr. Jessup?
Yes.

578
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,020
Ah!

579
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,420
Are you all right, Dr. Jessup?

580
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:56,640
I'm fine.

581
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,730
I just want to make a few notes.

582
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,260
Argh!

583
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,940
Mr. Daniel Craig,
Mr. Daniel Craig, please come...

584
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,440
Emily.
...to information, American Airlines.

585
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,400
My God, you look so marvelous.

586
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,070
How have you been, Eddie?

587
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,360
- Just fine. You?
- Fine.

588
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,280
Look, there's your dad.

589
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:57,830
Are you going to drive us
to our new house?

590
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,370
You bet your life.
Depending how nice you are...

591
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,620
...may even take you
to a Chinese restaurant.

592
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,250
Anyway, don't let anybody tell you
baboons aren't occasionally carnivorous.

593
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,750
I observed instances of predation...

594
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,630
...which involved the unmistakable
behavior of hunters.

595
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,550
A pair of baboons killed
a Thomson's gazelle and ate it.

596
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,800
There was even
a rudimentary communication...

597
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,930
...between the two baboons.

598
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,520
So I've become fascinated
with the work...

599
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,020
...being done on nonverbal communication
with apes.

600
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:29,190
I've been corresponding
with the University of Nevada.

601
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,480
I may just go out and spend
a couple of weeks there this summer.

602
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,990
I've got nothing else to do
except write my report.

603
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,240
I don't suppose you recorded
any of those baboon sounds?

604
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,410
Yes, of course I did. Why?

605
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,370
I'd like very much to hear them.

606
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,120
Of course.

607
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:47,540
Mrs. Tally said she'll be here
tomorrow morning at 10:30...

608
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,460
...to help you put everything away.

609
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:53,050
She wanted to know if you wanted her
to come back to work steady.

610
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:57,510
I got a letter from Mason
about a week ago, just before we left Nairobi.

611
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,930
He says that you've been working
with a very complex drug...

612
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,390
...which you brought back from Mexico.

613
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:10,190
It hasn't been thoroughly tested yet
and is dangerous as hell.

614
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:14,150
What else did Mason write you?

615
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:18,240
That over the past year you've taken
about two grams of that drug yourself...

616
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:21,530
...and that you had a very unusual instance
of genetic regression...

617
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,160
...about three months ago.

618
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,080
You may have leukemia or lymphoma.

619
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:32,040
He's been trying to get you in for a
complete workup but you've refused to go.

620
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,090
He's worried stiff that you're cracking up.

621
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,130
He thinks you're behaving
very strangely...

622
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,300
...and he begged me to talk to you
about this when I got back.

623
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,560
Mason is pathologically incapable
of keeping his mouth shut.

624
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,020
- He's worried.
- He's a stupid, doctrinaire idiot.

625
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,400
- Mason is a first-rate doctor.
- Lt's not leukemia.

626
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,610
Or any other kind of cancer.

627
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:58,990
I've let him do a liver-spleen scan
on me and a CAT scan.

628
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,280
I have been probed,
scoped and palpated.

629
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,490
Mason's had a mirror down my throat
or up my ass for three months.

630
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,540
And there is no evidence,
no suggestion whatsoever of cancer.

631
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,040
What else did Mason write you?

632
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,040
Which of these has
the baboon vocalizations?

633
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:15,800
- Ý'd like to hear them.
- Why?

634
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,630
Did Mason write that during the regression
I had an aphasic experience for four hours?

635
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,390
The only sounds I could get out were
clicks and grunts.

636
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,100
I've got a hunch they're like
the baboon vocalizations.

637
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:28,600
You took blood tests
and the lab report showed...

638
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:30,890
...some characteristics
of simian blood groups.

639
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:33,810
- Also antigens specific to man.
- Ý'd like to see that data.

640
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:37,990
The thing to do is for me to get back
to that isolation tank and try it again.

641
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:41,150
Let's see if it happens again.
None of us believed it happened.

642
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,490
After three months, I'm beginning
to wonder if it happened myself.

643
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,910
They won't go back to the tank.
Mason's taken over the whole project.

644
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,750
He's got Arthur up in his lab
fractionating rats' brains.

645
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,380
What the hell am l supposed to do
while they're fractionating rats' brains?

646
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:55,840
Mommy.

647
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,340
Everybody thinks your father's
going nuts.

648
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:04,260
Mommy, when are we going to eat?

649
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,520
Run along, play with Grace.

650
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:12,560
I am convinced that the regression
was triggered by an act of consciousness.

651
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:15,860
When I was in the tank,
I entered another consciousness.

652
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,730
I became another self,
a more primitive self...

653
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,530
...and the drug in some way...

654
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,870
...triggered the externalization
of that other, more primitive self.

655
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,870
At least look at my data.

656
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,450
Maybe tomorrow afternoon...

657
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,910
Don't patronize me.
It's just possible I'm not mad, you know.

658
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:37,210
I'm asking you to make a small quantum
jump to accept one deviant concept.

659
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:40,710
That our other states of consciousness
are as real as our waking state.

660
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,510
- And that reality can be externalized.
- You're screaming.

661
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,550
I've been getting this patronizing shit from
Mason for three months. I'm sick of it.

662
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,730
We've got millions of years stored away
in that computer bank we call our minds.

663
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:55,440
We have got trillions of dormant genes
in us, our whole evolutionary past.

664
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,730
Perhaps I've tapped into that.

665
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,980
I want to get back into
that tank and repeat the experiment.

666
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:05,860
The most elementary laboratory behavior.
Repeat the experiment. Confirm it.

667
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:09,080
I'd like other responsible scientists
with me when l do it.

668
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,120
I would like
a little consensual validation on this.

669
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:16,120
We may have demonstrated
a whole new force in nature.

670
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:19,630
For God's sake, don't you agree
it merits further investigation?

671
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,920
I've got tapes, notes,
everything at my place.

672
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:24,550
What time would you like to come
look at the stuff?

673
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,090
Two, 2:30.

674
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,260
Oh.

675
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,100
I just want to get the girls.
I'll be right back.

676
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,850
l'll get it, I'll get it.
No, no, I will.

677
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:18,150
It's 8:30, so get washed
and changed right now.

678
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:20,860
I don't want any trouble
from either of you tonight.

679
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:22,360
Hello?

680
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,740
Oh, Mason. Thank you for calling.

681
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,490
I assume you've spoken to Arthur.

682
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:30,490
No, no, I just got back
from dinner with the kids.

683
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,580
Well, l just don't know what to say.

684
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,830
I think you're absolutely right.
He's on the verge of a breakdown.

685
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,380
He was here all afternoon, carried on
like a madman and then disappeared.

686
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:44,380
Ordinarily l wouldn't be this panicky,
but I just am very worried.

687
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:58,560
- What's the trouble?
- There's an animal loose in the basement.

688
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,100
- What kind of animal?
- Monkey, l think.

689
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:29,590
Charlie. Charlie Thomas.
Where are you?

690
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,590
Listen, we got some kind of animal
loose here in B-building basement.

691
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,340
I'm heading into the north corridor,
to the boiler room.

692
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,010
You guys come down the other way.

693
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:41,640
Now, watch your step.
He's a pretty good-sized ape.

694
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:45,020
Call the animal rooms and find out
what the hell he's doing down here.

695
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,340
Must be in here somewhere.

696
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:20,390
I'm gonna take a look up here.

697
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:13,000
What the-?
Get out. Get on out of here!

698
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:15,750
Hey. Get on out of here!

699
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:01,600
What were you doing in the tank room?

700
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:06,690
I remember large fragments
of what happened, but not all of it.

701
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,690
You'll have to be patient with me.

702
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:16,490
I've had Mason looking all over Boston
for you all night.

703
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:19,240
It's okay. I'm all right.

704
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:32,090
I suppose getting a call at 2:30
in the morning from the police...

705
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:35,380
...to the effect your husband
has been found sleeping naked...

706
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:38,050
...in the city zoo
might have caused you some concern.

707
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:41,550
- Yes, I think you could say that.
- Mason telling you this whole time...

708
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,390
... I'm having a nervous breakdown...

709
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,350
...and you figured
I'd finally flipped out altogether.

710
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:52,320
I'm sorry, Emily. Forgive me. L know
what a harrowing day I've caused you.

711
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,400
I suppose you've been sitting here...

712
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:57,150
...trying to figure out
how to get me to a psychiatrist.

713
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,650
As a matter of fact, I have.

714
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:01,570
I don't know how you've put up with me
all these years.

715
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:05,540
I loved you.

716
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:13,750
My God, Emily, l don't know
how to tell you this. L really don't.

717
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,460
The implications are staggering.

718
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:19,050
Apparently I entered
a very primitive consciousness.

719
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:22,140
All I remember is what was
comprehensible to that consciousness.

720
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:25,430
I don't remember, not clearly,
how l got out of the tank room.

721
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:28,940
The first thing l remember are the dogs.

722
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,610
I followed a pack of wild dogs to the zoo.
That's how l got there.

723
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:37,940
In the zoo, l hunted down,
killed, and ate a small sheep.

724
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:44,120
I was utterly primal.
I consisted of nothing more...

725
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:47,330
...than the will to survive,
to live through the night...

726
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:49,120
...to eat...

727
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,460
...to drink...

728
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:55,500
...to sleep.

729
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:02,720
It was the most supremely
satisfying time of my life.

730
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:08,140
I may have killed a man tonight.

731
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:11,600
I remember...

732
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:14,980
...beating on a...

733
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:26,200
You don't know the trouble I had
getting these clothes.

734
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:29,250
I had to go down to the security office.

735
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:33,330
They want you to call
the security office right now.

736
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,500
There was some kind of ape loose
in your isolation tank room.

737
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:40,340
Do you know anything about that?
This ape almost killed a security guard.

738
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,510
You didn't bring some ape
down to that tank room, did you?

739
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,770
Your watch and stuff are
in your jacket pocket. You all right?

740
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:54,350
Is he all right?

741
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,480
Tell Mason what you've been telling me.

742
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:59,570
I want to hear Mason's views on all this.

743
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:03,200
I think Mason's views will be predictable.

744
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,870
My God. There it is...

745
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:14,080
...a protohuman. The first and original,
truly human form.

746
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:18,710
Tiny, perhaps four feet high,
completely furred...

747
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,380
...chimp-like, but erect.
No knuckle-walking. Shorter arms.

748
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:27,220
He's moving along so gracefully.
There's two, three of them.

749
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:30,260
Bipedal, tiny...

750
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:43,530
I'm killing- Ý'm killing a goat.

751
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,450
I'm killing...

752
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:48,320
I'm eating hot flesh.

753
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:50,910
I'm eating the blood of a goat.

754
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,580
Are you okay?

755
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:59,130
Beautiful. Beautiful.

756
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:01,590
It sounded like he was having
a bad trip to me.

757
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,920
Some of these tank trips
can get pretty creepy.

758
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:08,890
What the hell was that?

759
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:06,150
Did I wake you? Ýt's Emily.

760
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,200
Eddie, I'm in a kind of wild panic.
I need to talk to you.

761
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:26,170
I don't know how to put this into words,
but I think that what happened to you...

762
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:28,470
...was not just
a hallucinatory experience.

763
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:32,510
I've got this gut feeling that something
phenomenological did actually happen.

764
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,220
That there was some kind
of genetic transformation.

765
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:38,810
I don't know why I think this,
in defiance of all rationality, but l do.

766
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:42,310
And now that l do, I'm terrified.
I mean really terrified. Petrified.

767
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,520
So am l.

768
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:45,730
I don't want you doing
this experiment again.

769
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:49,110
- L have to find out if it actually happened.
- Put the experiment off.

770
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,200
Until we understand more. Minimize risk.

771
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,950
There's no way you can understand
this before the event.

772
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,040
You may cause
irreversible genetic damage.

773
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:00,080
I don't think we're dealing with genetics.
We're beyond matter, beyond even energy.

774
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:02,960
What we're back to is the first thought.

775
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:06,300
I'm trying to tell you l love you.

776
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:08,210
I know that.

777
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:12,840
And I'm trying to tell you,
this is an all-bets-are-off sort of thing.

778
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:16,310
We may be opening a box that may
scrap our whole picture of space-time.

779
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:20,730
We might have a link to another universe.
For God's sake, Emily, you're a scientist.

780
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:22,650
You must know how I feel.

781
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:27,190
Yes, l know how you feel.

782
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:32,740
It's very late, Eddie.
Would you like to stay here tonight?

783
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:38,910
I could do with a little love
and a little reassurance right now.

784
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:41,330
You'll stay, won't you?

785
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,540
If l come out of that tank anthropoid,
I'll be in a primitive state...

786
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:26,460
...and impossible to relate to,
so sedate me while I'm still in the tank.

787
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:29,170
Otherwise you'll have to chase me around
and subdue me.

788
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,920
Okay.

789
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:34,130
I'll tell you one thing,
you come out looking like an ape...

790
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:37,390
...and I'm going over to Mass Mental
and commit myself.

791
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:40,180
If it happens,
we'll bring him down with Amytal.

792
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:43,730
What do you mean "if it happens"?
Everybody keeps saying "if it happens."

793
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:46,440
Do you think something is gonna happen?
If you do, I'd like to know.

794
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,940
I'm sorry. I'm just nervous as hell.

795
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:53,940
Listen, so am l.

796
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:58,590
Anything happen?

797
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,390
I just checked him 10 minutes ago.

798
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:03,510
Did you order chicken or turkey?

799
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,430
I hope chicken is all right.

800
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,100
I've got nearly 11.
That's more than two hours now.

801
01:23:08,270 --> 01:23:10,060
I think we should stop this.

802
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,150
I'll tell you frankly, I'm frightened.

803
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,860
We could be screwing around
with his genetic structure.

804
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:17,110
- How do we stop this?
- Can you bring him down?

805
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,910
- He's gonna be sore.
- We should never have let him do it.

806
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:24,120
Don't know how we let him talk us into this.
We were humoring him, but he's not crazy.

807
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:25,910
And we know, deep in our hearts...

808
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,750
...that he may be onto something
beyond our comprehension.

809
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,210
Now, because l believe him,
I want this thing stopped.

810
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:37,420
Oh, Jesus.

811
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:20,800
Eddie!

812
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:22,970
No!

813
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:26,310
Eddie! No, no!

814
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:35,270
No, no! Eddie!

815
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,360
Oh!

816
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:49,950
Ah!

817
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:51,470
Eddie!

818
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:20,590
His signs are all good.

819
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,260
He'll probably sleep a day or two,
come out stuporous.

820
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:25,060
He's got a load of drugs in him.

821
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:28,440
It's not uncommon for a psychedelic
experience to whack you out.

822
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,060
You'd hardly call this
just a psychedelic experience.

823
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:33,230
His heart is good. His pressure is good.

824
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,110
I'm more worried about you
than l am about him.

825
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,860
I'm all right.

826
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:48,250
Of all the men in this world,
why do l have to love this one?

827
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:50,170
I can't get him out of me.

828
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:53,250
Do you know how many men
I tried to fall in love with this year?

829
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:56,250
No matter who I'm in bed with,
I have to imagine it's him.

830
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:58,630
No matter who I'm eating with
or walking with...

831
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,180
...there's always this pain
because it isn't him.

832
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:04,390
I'm possessed by him.

833
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:09,390
Oh, it's crazy.

834
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:12,690
I think that's the way it's supposed to be.

835
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:15,520
- He doesn't give a damn about me.
- You're the only thing he cares about...

836
01:32:15,690 --> 01:32:17,650
...outside of his work.
- No, Mason.

837
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:22,320
I was never real to him. Nothing in
the human condition was ever real to him.

838
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:23,910
He's a truth lover.

839
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:28,790
Reality to Eddie is only that
which is changeless, immutably constant.

840
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,960
What happened to Eddie tonight,
that was Eddie's idea of love.

841
01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:36,630
That was consummation. Ha, ha.

842
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,380
He finally got it off with God.

843
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:43,680
He finally embraced the absolute,
was finally ravished by truth...

844
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,890
...and it goddamn near destroyed him.

845
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:50,390
He never loved me.
You knew him as well as l did.

846
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,730
We were all bits
of transitory matter to him.

847
01:32:56,360 --> 01:33:00,650
All right, now, you're going into shock.
I'm going to get you something.

848
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:17,670
We reached a point tonight
where physical science just breaks down.

849
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,300
We're in blue skies.

850
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:22,010
Tonight was history,
and what are we gonna do about it?

851
01:33:22,170 --> 01:33:26,180
I'm gonna do nothing about it.
Tonight scared the hell out of me.

852
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:28,260
That tank just blew up.

853
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:31,680
Whatever happened inside that tank
released a hell of a lot of energy.

854
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:36,520
For God's sake, let's drop this goddamn
thing. I don't want to talk about it.

855
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:39,400
I can't help it.
You may want to go to sleep right now...

856
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:42,490
...but the way I feel
I don't expect to go to sleep for a year.

857
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:44,610
I'm on fucking fire.

858
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:49,030
I am in there mopping up the goddamned
tank room and l would like to know why.

859
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,370
Do you believe in
supernatural agencies, Mason?

860
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:53,000
No, sir, l do not.

861
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:56,790
Then what we saw tonight
was a physical phenomenon.

862
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,210
An inexplicable physical phenomenon.
If it's phenomenological...

863
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:03,970
...then it's explicable. I've got to know why.
Let me talk, for chrissake.

864
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:07,050
I have been in there mopping up
that tank room for three hours.

865
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:08,890
I've had all I can take.

866
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:11,180
I can tell you
what I would like to do.

867
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:13,480
We have got to repeat this
with other subjects.

868
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,140
We need a selective sample.

869
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:18,060
We will put up a notice
in the student union for volunteers.

870
01:34:18,230 --> 01:34:20,900
- Get five or six subjects.
- This is Arthur talking, right?

871
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:23,610
Step up the doses of the drug.
- Conscience of science?

872
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:27,240
Check them against Eddie's values.
- Petitions against genetic engineering.

873
01:34:27,410 --> 01:34:29,950
We could even get a grant, for chrissake!

874
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,790
Big, moral science of the people...
- Bullshit!

875
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:36,750
...and here you are, willing to use an
untested drug on innocent human beings.

876
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:39,250
Please stop shouting.

877
01:34:48,090 --> 01:34:49,430
How are you?

878
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:52,600
Would you like to go back to sleep?

879
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:55,600
Yes.

880
01:34:56,730 --> 01:34:59,230
Would you mind if Mason
had a quick look at you first?

881
01:35:01,690 --> 01:35:03,440
It's a good idea.

882
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,740
Maybe you ought to have
a quick look at him, Mason.

883
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:13,970
Oh, l hope it isn't the kids.

884
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:16,680
Hello?

885
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:22,850
Everything's fine, Arthur. He's fine.

886
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:25,520
- Lt's Arthur. Are you fine?
- Yes.

887
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:30,400
Arthur, I'll call you back
when I'm more awake. Everything's fine.

888
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:37,540
God, I wonder what time it is.

889
01:36:37,910 --> 01:36:39,910
I should call the kids.

890
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:43,830
I can't tell you
how much you mean to me...

891
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:48,210
...how much l need you and the kids.
I just wanted you to know that.

892
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:51,970
You saved me. You redeemed me
from the pit. L was in it, Emily.

893
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:56,970
I was in that ultimate moment of terror
that is the beginning of life.

894
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:59,060
It is nothing.

895
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:02,520
Simple, hideous nothing.

896
01:37:03,730 --> 01:37:07,570
The final truth of all things
is that there is no final truth.

897
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:12,360
Truth is what's transitory.
It's human life that is real.

898
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:16,530
I don't want to frighten you, but I'm trying
to tell you is at that moment of terror...

899
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:20,540
...is a real and living horror,
living and growing within me now.

900
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:24,290
And the only thing that keeps it
from devouring me is you.

901
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:26,580
Why don't you just come back to us?

902
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,420
Hmm. It's too late.

903
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:33,470
I don't think l can get out of it anymore.

904
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,720
I can't live with it. The pain is too great.

905
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:48,820
Defy it, Eddie.
You made it real. You can make it unreal.

906
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:50,570
If you love me, Eddie...

907
01:37:50,730 --> 01:37:53,780
