1
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,560
All right, let's go, people!
One minute before tardy lockdown!

2
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,640
Let's go! Everybody move inside!

3
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,640
Good morning.

4
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,560
Let's go! Let her go!

5
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,800
No smoking! I don't smoke,
you don't smoke!

6
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,560
Let's go, people!
Today's a good day to learn.

7
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,960
Watch yourselves!

8
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,640
No riding bikes in the hallways, stupid!

9
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,440
Coming through!

10
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
You late, Garfield. You late!

11
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,720
Au contraire, my homeboy.
The bell hasn't rung yet.

12
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,640
-You is a crazy nigga, G.
-Very true, man.

13
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,200
Thank you very much for sharing that.
Let's go.

14
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,440
You two, please. This is not
the Playboy Channel.

15
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,400
Good morning, one and all.
Let's get started, please.

16
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,960
August, Tywan, would you
pass out the book?

17
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,680
What up with your car?

18
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,960
Your Pinto with the 8-track blew up?

19
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,960
Attention, please!

20
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,880
I'm sure some of you are wondering
why I brought this bicycle to class.

21
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,280
Excuse me. Grasshopper?

22
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,800
Thank you.

23
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,720
The purpose of the bike...

24
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,880
...is to demonstrate
centripetal force...

25
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,760
...the opposite of the force
we studied yesterday...

26
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,800
...which was...?

27
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,720
Centrifugal force.

28
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,800
I thought I'd demonstrate.

29
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,760
Tywan?

30
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,120
Would you come up here
and help me, please?

31
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,840
Y o, what up?

32
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,600
Go see what your daddy want.

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,320
Here you go.

34
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,760
Brace these handlebars
behind your knees.

35
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,880
Sit.

36
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,280
Crank the pedals.
Get that wheel going...

37
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,840
...about 1 80 rpm.

38
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,480
-What's up with this?
-Come on!

39
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,800
Put some muscle into it. Come on!

40
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,880
It's crazy, man. Got a nigger
riding a bike going nowhere.

41
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,840
Bear with me. You'll see.

42
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,920
Harder!

43
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,800
Harder!

44
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,080
Come on, T, get playing!

45
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,640
Tilt the wheel to your right.

46
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,080
Right?

47
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,440
Augie, check me out!
IKnow what I'm saying?

48
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,840
Tywan! Tywan!

49
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,560
Spinning like a motherfucker!
You know what I mean?

50
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,440
Spin like a nut!

51
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,840
What's my name?

52
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,920
Walter, I need to talk.

53
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,040
I'm pretty busy now. What is it?

54
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,280
Open it.

55
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,760
I don't suppose this kid
cares about our budget crisis.

56
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,880
Have the textbook room
charge him for it.

57
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,240
That says 1 87.
That's the police code for homicide.

58
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
I know what it stands for.

59
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,400
The kid probably heard it in a rap song.
Means nothing.

60
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,720
The book belongs to Dennis Broadway.
He's a known gangster.

61
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,040
Garfield, if I had a dollar for every
time a student threatened faculty....

62
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,400
Did you tell Dennis he was
getting a fail from me?

63
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,360
I have legal access to those files.

64
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,640
He's a transfer from Nixon, isn't he?

65
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,160
If he gets through this semester,
he gets to go back to Nixon.

66
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,880
He blew his opportunity. Now
he has to live with the consequences.

67
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,880
I don't think he wants to live with
the consequences. He wants me dead.

68
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,600
Relax. This has nothing to do with you.

69
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,960
I should've been told, Walter.

70
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,880
You know what your problem is?

71
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,800
On the one hand, you think
someone's trying to kill you.

72
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,880
On the other hand, you believe kids
are paying attention in your classes.

73
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,480
Call 9 1 1!

74
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,160
Morning.

75
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,080
Mr. Garfield, this is the Sub Unit.
Are you available for work?

76
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,040
Sure.

77
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,880
There's a science class
at John Quincy Adams.

78
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,800
It's a four-day assignment.
The teacher's name is Eskander.

79
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,640
All right. Thank you.

80
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,800
If you're listening, God...

81
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,640
...please help me today.

82
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,560
Please give me a chance
to do my job...

83
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,840
... which you put me here
to do in the first place.

84
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,000
God, grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change...

85
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,280
... the courage to change
the things I can...

86
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,160
...and the wisdom
to know the difference.

87
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,320
It's me, Trevor, God.

88
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,360
Amen.

89
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,280
Baseball cap, give it u p.

90
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,480
Hold, please.

91
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,680
-I'm a substitute.
-Card?

92
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,680
You want the main office down the hall.
Check in with Mrs. Ford.

93
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,080
Excuse me?

94
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,360
Could you tell me where Bungalow 86 is?

95
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,840
Next to the parking lot.
Last bungalow on the left.

96
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,280
Good luck.

97
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,280
I can't even read that shit!

98
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,520
Look at that!

99
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,880
Morning.

100
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,520
Before I take the roll,
I'd like to make a point.

101
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,080
"Farfie"? What up, Farfie?

102
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,560
It's not important
who or what "Farfie" is.

103
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,440
The point I'd like to make is...

104
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,560
...anyone here can be a scientist.

105
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,280
What's he talking about?

106
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,560
A scientist is like a detective.

107
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,280
He investigates data
he doesn't understand...

108
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,360
... by scratching the surface...

109
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,360
...so he can see what's underneath.

110
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,160
Things like this.

111
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,560
No, watch!

112
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,520
What...

113
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,400
...did...

114
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,280
...Glis plimp?

115
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,760
Where does your teacher keep the chalk?

116
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
In the desk.

117
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,960
Can I help you?

118
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Sorry I'm late. I had to
handle something. You a sub?

119
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,040
For Ms. Eskander. Science.

120
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,560
Eskander?

121
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,400
Well, this is Dave Childress.
American History.

122
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,800
I don't know how to break it to you,
Mr...Garfield?

123
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,560
This is Bungalow 84.
You want Bungalow 86.

124
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,720
It's not your fault.

125
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,040
You must've zagged
when you should've zigged.

126
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,000
Somebody stole the number.
I keep asking Garcia to fix it...

127
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,840
...but all I get is nada.

128
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,720
Eskander? Come here.

129
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,240
See this mess over here?

130
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,680
That's Eskander.

131
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,880
It's not real.

132
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,880
We're studying teen-parenting
in Home Ec.

133
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,000
It's computerized, so it cries and shit.

134
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,920
How'd those books get outside?

135
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,440
No speak ingles.

136
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Speak Spanish, Mr...?

137
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,760
Garfield.

138
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,720
My name's Garfield.

139
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,840
Speak Spanish, Mr. G?

140
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,240
You know what that means
when a homeboy calls you "G"?

141
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,000
It means "gangster", ese.

142
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,920
You a gangster, maestro?

143
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,280
No.

144
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,080
I'm not a gangster.

145
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,880
Would you do me a favor and please
go out there and pick up those books?

146
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,320
I ain't picking that shit up!

147
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,640
You pick it up.

148
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,160
What's your name?

149
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,600
What is your name?

150
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,680
Cesar Chavez.

151
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,560
Don't you recognize me?

152
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,240
Do you see this?

153
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,600
See, I'm already on house arrest.

154
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,800
-There's nothing you can do to me.
-Straight up, dog!

155
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,280
I'm out of here.

156
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,680
Could you have a seat?

157
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,000
Guys?

158
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,360
Mr. G, those guys that just walked out
aren't even in here this period.

159
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,560
And this fool's name is Benny Chacon.

160
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,480
Shut your mouth, hood rat.

161
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,520
-Schoolgirl bitch.
-That's enough!

162
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,000
You ain't no real teacher, fool.
You're nothing but a sub.

163
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,400
Why do you wear that rosary?

164
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,040
To put God on me, okay?

165
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,720
So why don't you go read your newspaper,
wannabe motherfucker.

166
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,480
Are you done?

167
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,400
Give me a referral and shut up.

168
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,640
For future reference...

169
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,600
...anyone who disrupts a class...

170
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,880
...is subject to disciplinary action.

171
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,880
This classroom is our sanctuary.

172
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,320
Yours and mine.

173
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,560
Respect it.

174
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,080
And for your information...

175
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,480
... I am a real teacher.

176
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,320
Whatever you say, Opie.

177
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,000
Who'd like to help me
pick up those books?

178
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,560
What the hell's happening,
little sister?

179
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,640
How goes the battle?

180
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,800
Did you...

181
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,960
...get your "binky marsden farfied"?

182
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,360
You want some advice?

183
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,480
First one of these homeboys who
gives you the slightest bit of shit...

184
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,120
...you march his ass down
to Larry Hyland. He' s their counselor.

185
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,480
Because you gotta sacrifice one of them.

186
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,080
Show them some balls.
Let them know who's boss.

187
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,880
And don't look to
the administration for support.

188
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,760
They haven't been in a classroom.
They don't know shit.

189
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,240
Look at me.

190
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,240
I got tenure and I'm still
in the damn bungalows.

191
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,040
I should be in the "A" building
in one of the air-conditioned rooms.

192
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,800
You met Garcia yet?

193
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,760
Our principal?

194
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,760
Hey, Dave.

195
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,960
Ellen Henry. Computer science.

196
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,920
Trevor Garfield.

197
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,560
Nice scar you got there.

198
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,640
You ever sub here before?

199
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,040
No. First time.

200
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,640
What about permanent?

201
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,320
Seven years in the Bed-Sty
section of Brooklyn.

202
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,840
Roosevelt Whitney High.

203
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,160
Roosevelt Whitney?

204
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,480
Isn't it where that teacher
got stabbed to death last year?

205
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,240
Actually, he survived.

206
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,280
No, no. It was on 60 Minutes.
There was this teacher...

207
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,520
...that gangbanger stabbed
about a dozen times in the hallway.

208
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,960
Jesus Christ!

209
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,600
You' re him!

210
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,520
It was you!

211
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,040
Holy shit, Garfield!
When was that, last fall? When?

212
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,880
October 27.

213
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,880
What a schmuck!

214
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,160
I' m giving advice to a guy
with a Purple Heart!

215
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,760
Excuse me.

216
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,760
Listen to me.

217
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,720
In my book, you' re a hero, man.
Damn straight!

218
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,160
-Getting stabbed doesn't make me a hero.
-What' d they do to the kid?

219
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,640
Put him in a facility upstate
till he's 2 1.

220
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,720
That's it?
They should've caned him.

221
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,360
They should've caned the bastard
like they did that kid in Singapore.

222
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,520
President of Singapore
had a few choice words.

223
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,880
"When a continuing state
of defiance and disorder...

224
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,200
...cannot be checked by the rules...

225
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,440
...then new and sometimes
drastic rules...

226
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,160
... must be forged to maintain order.

227
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,040
The alternative is anarchy."

228
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,480
Why do you still teach?

229
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,400
The same reason that you do, Garfield.
For the paycheck.

230
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,840
Hold on, everyone.

231
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,960
I still have a few minutes.

232
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,680
Tell me the difference between the
central nervous system and the lymphatic.

233
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,960
You got a nice butt.

234
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,960
Since you seem to know
so much about anatomy, Ms...

235
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,320
... Nartinez....

236
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,760
Central nervous system
and the lymphatic.

237
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,560
Tell me the difference.

238
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,680
It' s like the....

239
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,520
The central nervous system is...

240
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,040
...your brain and your spinal cord.

241
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,640
And the lymphatic system is the stuff
in your blood that fights diseases.

242
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,800
That's right!

243
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,240
Schoolgirl!

244
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,160
That bitch was cheating.

245
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,680
Are you writing on your desk, Mr...

246
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,160
...Sanchez?

247
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,440
I don't see nothing in my hands,
do you?

248
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,200
"K.O.S."

249
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,880
What' s that? A tagging crew?

250
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,240
-"Kartoon." That you?
-lt might be.

251
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,400
Does K.O.S. have
something to do with Benny?

252
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,760
Don't go there.

253
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,320
"K.O.S." stands for
"Kapping Off Suckers."

254
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,000
We give out referrals.

255
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,560
Don't disrespect my homeboy.
I don't like it.

256
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,040
And he don't like you.

257
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,600
Do me a favor.

258
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,840
Go to the counter, get a paper towel
and wipe your desk off.

259
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,720
And what' s your name?

260
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,920
Who, me?

261
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,320
Stevie Littleton.

262
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,640
You do me a favor, Mr. Littleton.
Turn that tagger shirt...

263
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,680
...inside out.

264
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,000
What, this?

265
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,120
Hyland said it was okay.

266
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,600
Later, lover!

267
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,400
It was a pleasure meeting you.

268
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,600
They' re just trying to fuck with you.

269
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,920
I mean, play with you.

270
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,760
-Sorry I said you had a nice ass.
-Apology accepted.

271
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,520
But I ain't no schoolgirl.

272
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,320
Heaven forbid I'd think that.

273
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
May I come in?

274
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,400
Sure.

275
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,520
Making time a reward
instead of a distraction.

276
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,520
I don't know why I jumped up
the way I did at lunch.

277
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,880
It's just weird.

278
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,800
It's all right.

279
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,280
For what it's worth,
Childress thinks you walk on water.

280
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,800
Is that a good thing?

281
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,800
It takes a lot of courage to go
back into a classroom after that.

282
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,200
Not if the only thing
you ever wanted was to teach.

283
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,400
You see, there's our predicament.

284
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,720
I assume you've met Benny Chacon.

285
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,280
Y es, I have.

286
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,600
Last week...

287
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,960
... Benny and his tagging crew...

288
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,240
...had Ms. Eskander
pinned in the corner over there.

289
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,760
She' s seven months pregnant.

290
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,160
So she kicks him.

291
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,560
If the district rules it an assault
on a student, she' s gone.

292
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,080
They'd do that?

293
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,960
She' s non -tenured.

294
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,280
Wouldn't be surprised
if she files for stress leave.

295
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,040
It' s too bad.

296
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,040
She was a good teacher.

297
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,760
Can I ask a personal question?

298
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,360
When you were attacked,
was it random or did you know him?

299
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,320
No, I knew him. I flunked him.

300
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,240
Can you see something like that coming?

301
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,760
IKid tells you he wants to kill you,
believe him.

302
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,360
He was an O.T.,
an opportunity transfer.

303
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,000
But nobody told me that
till it was too late.

304
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,880
Do you know Benny' s an O.T.?

305
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,840
Last year he was convicted of a felony
assault and suspended twice.

306
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,760
I even testified against him
as a character witness.

307
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,120
And now I get to see him
every morning in my homeroom.

308
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,000
In your homeroom?

309
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,120
Condition of his probation
is that he stay in school.

310
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,840
-Did you talk to the principal?
-Many times.

311
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,280
This kid's threatening me, and
all Garcia cares about is a lawsuit.

312
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,240
What did Benny say to you?

313
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,480
That he'd hurt me.

314
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,120
Real bad.

315
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,200
Someone calls my house every night...

316
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,680
...and hangs up.

317
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,200
A couple of weeks ago,
they broke into my car.

318
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,960
And on Friday, someone was in my house,
but I can't prove it.

319
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,560
I don't know what to do.

320
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,680
You can quit.

321
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,840
You didn't.

322
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,520
Hey, Picasso!

323
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,240
What' s up?
You guys writers, or what?

324
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,680
-You don't know me, fool?
-No, man.

325
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,360
You should.
You just fucked up my piece.

326
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,960
You guys from K.O.S.?

327
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,200
"K.O.S." Come on, nigga!

328
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,040
-Y eah, we K.O.S., fool.
-Shut up!

329
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,760
I got some silver in my sack.
I could just clean it up for you.

330
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,400
I'll take care of it.

331
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,440
Don't fuck with me.

332
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,760
I might just have to bust
a cap in your ass.

333
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,920
Come on, it's all about bombing,
getting citywide.

334
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,320
Don't get all violent.

335
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,480
Benny, don't be getting violent now.

336
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,920
I said shut the fuck up!

337
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,920
Y o, nigga, get away, man!

338
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,600
Damn!

339
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,680
I ain't got time for this shit.

340
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,720
You think this is funny?

341
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,600
If I don't call my P.O. in 1 5 minutes,
I'm fucked!

342
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,560
Come on, let's get out of here.

343
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,320
Benny, come on, man! Let' s go!

344
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,480
Come on, Paco, let' s step.

345
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,480
Benny Chacon?

346
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,080
Benny' s not here.

347
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,200
I think he went AWOL.

348
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,920
-Leonard Thomas?
-Here.

349
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,560
Hi. How are you?

350
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,920
Eskander did file for stress leave.

351
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,160
They asked me
to finish out the semester.

352
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,240
That' s great.

353
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,320
Just till the end of the year.

354
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,000
I wanted to thank you for letting me
cry on your shoulder the other day.

355
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,360
It's all right.

356
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,520
Have you seen Benny lately?

357
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,840
His P.O. says he hasn't
heard from him in 4 days.

358
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,000
Really?

359
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,800
They say, "Be careful
what you pray for."

360
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,920
Don't get me wrong.
Benny's made my life a living hell.

361
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,600
I've moved in with my mother
because of him.

362
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,400
I love her, but if I eat
one more dinner off the TV tray...

363
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,560
...or watch one more rerun of
Wheel of Fortune, I'll lose my mind.

364
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,760
Time' s up!

365
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,680
When did a student
last surprise you?

366
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,640
When the light came on?
That's been a while.

367
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,840
Don't you ever get lonely?

368
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,640
Y eah, sometimes.

369
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,920
There' s this passage
in God's Lonely Man...

370
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,480
... by Thomas Wolfe where he says:

371
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,360
"The whole conviction of my life
rests upon the belief...

372
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,720
...that loneliness is the central...

373
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,600
...and inevitable fact
of human existence."

374
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,120
That' s really depressing, Trevor.

375
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,600
It' s just my New Y ork upbringing.
It' s not easy looking...

376
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,480
...on the bright side these days.

377
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,480
You'd feel that way after spending
a year going in and out of hospitals.

378
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,040
No, that wasn't that tough.

379
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,240
The robbery.

380
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,920
That was the hardest for me to get over.

381
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,680
What'd they steal?

382
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,920
My passion. The spark.

383
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,760
My unguarded self. I miss them.
I want them back.

384
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,240
If you ask me, they' re still there.

385
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,280
I think everyone else has given up.

386
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,960
They' re so beaten down.

387
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,640
But you' re different.

388
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840
You refuse to be beaten.

389
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,280
Well, thank you.

390
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,440
Where are you going?

391
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,160
Got something for you.

392
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,000
Did you know that
Cesar Sanchez is Special Ed?

393
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:17,960
No.

394
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,880
Y eah, he's S.E.D.

395
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,480
Severely emotionally disturbed?

396
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,320
That's great.

397
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,000
I wanted you to have this.

398
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,600
I can't believe...! You are so....

399
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,640
When I go back on my right foot,
you come forward on your left.

400
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,880
When I go forward on my left,
you' re back on your right.

401
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,200
He taught you that?

402
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,920
-Fresh little kid.
-All part of the dance.

403
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,640
Was he this fresh?

404
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,200
I' m sorry!

405
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,080
It's all right.

406
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
Can I get something?

407
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,160
Get the baking soda out of the kitchen.

408
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,280
Sure.

409
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,440
Where in the kitchen?

410
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,000
The fridge.

411
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,800
-I'm so sorry.
-It's all right.

412
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,040
Just when I was getting to be
a salsa king too, huh?

413
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,160
Is this the Wheel of Fortune house?

414
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,880
Y eah.

415
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,560
Hey, Jack.

416
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,440
Hey, sweetheart.

417
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,040
You're a good dog. Y es, you are.

418
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,640
I wanna apologize...

419
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,400
...for reacting the way that I did.

420
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,280
You don't have to apologize.
Everybody reacts that way.

421
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,480
Thanks for dinner.

422
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,480
I had a really good time.

423
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,160
You' re welcome.

424
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,040
You know....

425
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,920
You know what you need?

426
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,680
You need something
to liven up your house.

427
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,200
It flowers.

428
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,080
Thanks.

429
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,080
You're welcome.

430
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,720
Good night.

431
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,840
Good night.

432
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,160
Since some of you are so
interested in pharmaceuticals...

433
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,240
... I thought I'd prepare
a little demonstration for you.

434
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,600
Rita.

435
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,000
Bring your friend in the cage
up here, please.

436
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,920
His name is Snowball.

437
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,000
Like that little pig dude
from Animal Farm.

438
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
You read Animal Farm?

439
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,760
Schoolgirl!

440
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,040
Shut up, Cesar!

441
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,240
You read Animal Farm, Cesar?

442
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,680
No. But I fucked a sheep once.

443
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,520
We heard that, homes.

444
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,840
That shit is sick.

445
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,480
Cesar, come here.

446
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,080
I want you to have
a front row sit for this.

447
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
Lose the lokes.

448
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,720
Why are your eyes so red?

449
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,360
I was up late studying all night, Mr. G.

450
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,680
Y eah, right.

451
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,240
That's a nice watch.

452
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,720
Can I have it?

453
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,440
Sit down.

454
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,480
I want you to read Young's Rule.

455
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,920
Page 564. Top of the page.

456
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,160
-I ain't reading that shit.
-Rita...

457
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,120
...give Cesar your book so he can read.

458
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,840
Forget it! I ain't reading that shit.

459
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,280
-Stupid chunt!
-Stupid bitch!

460
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,720
Just read it, man!

461
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,960
Read.

462
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,800
Please.

463
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,720
"Young' s Rule..."

464
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,960
Formulates.

465
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,960
"...formulates...."

466
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,200
Settle down!

467
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,840
Settle down, people.

468
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,520
Fuck you guys!

469
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,480
It' s all right.

470
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,320
You'll get another chance.

471
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,320
I have in this brown bottle
a prescription for liquid Demerol.

472
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
Where'd you get that?

473
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,440
This came out of my private stash.

474
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,840
Demerol is a morphine sulfate.
It is soluble in water.

475
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,720
Young's Rule says:

476
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,720
Divide the age of the patient...

477
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,480
... by the patient' s age plus 1 2...

478
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,320
...thus giving you...

479
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,640
...the correct fraction of the adult
dosage suitable for the patient.

480
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,160
In Snowball's case...

481
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,120
... I calculated the dosage
for a 1 -year-old child.

482
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,320
He should be awake in about 1 0 minutes.

483
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,400
He' s dead, isn't he?

484
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,440
I hope he did die!

485
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,920
He should've woke up by now.

486
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,040
You just caught yourself a murder case.

487
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,440
Everyone who didn't answer...

488
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,480
...the questions on page 264,
please do so tonight.

489
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,680
Cesar!

490
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,200
Hold it.

491
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,080
Where' s my watch?

492
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,960
I ain't got no watch. I gotta go.

493
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,360
Come here! Empty your pockets!

494
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,880
Let me put it to you like this.
I gotta catch a bus. All right?

495
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,600
I have to see Hyland before he leaves.

496
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,080
I've been meaning to see you.

497
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,000
It's been a week.
You must be avoiding me.

498
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,640
Are you okay?

499
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,280
It' s pretty much been like this
since my accident.

500
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,600
But it has nothing to do with you.

501
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,360
I gotta go.

502
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,320
Can you do me a favor?

503
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,480
When you finish, can you give me a ride
to my car? It's at the mechanic's.

504
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,880
If you can't, it' s okay. I can walk.

505
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,520
I can manage that.

506
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,200
Thanks.

507
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,440
Base 1 to Base 3. I found him.

508
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,080
Mr. Garcia would like
to see you in his office.

509
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,520
Thanks for coming in.

510
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,240
Sorry we have to meet
under such circumstances.

511
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,440
You don't mind if we tape-record
our conversation? Matter of record.

512
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,680
You know Mr. Hyland, right?
Your teachers' union rep.

513
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,760
Am I being questioned?

514
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,560
They say you've accused them
of stealing your watch.

515
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,640
And if that's the case, I need
to address the accusation.

516
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,120
Beginning of 6th period,
Cesar admired my watch.

517
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,840
I believe his exact words were
"Can I have it?"

518
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,800
Bottom line is, I'd like my watch back.

519
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,160
Anything else?

520
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,000
I asked him to empty his pockets
and he refused.

521
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,120
Is that true?

522
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,000
No way! He never asked me that!

523
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,040
I don't go around taxing teachers.
I got no damn watch!

524
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,360
Calm down.

525
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,480
Empty your pockets now.

526
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,960
Mr. Littleton, may we see
what' s in your pockets too?

527
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,640
I'd like a locker search.

528
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,960
Good. I could use the money.
I'll sue your ass.

529
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,240
You're excused, gentlemen.

530
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,760
Take your things, please.
Thank you very much.

531
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,120
Do you have the time?

532
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,160
It' s 3 : 22, Mr. Sanchez.

533
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,680
3 : 22. Thanks.

534
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,480
Mr. Garfield, let me try
to explain something.

535
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,600
I work very hard to try and think
of our students here at Adams...

536
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,600
...as my clients.

537
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,120
We can't have another lawsuit
like we had on that Blackwell case.

538
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,640
That one cost the district
a quarter of a million dollars.

539
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,200
So I need you to be straight with me.

540
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,640
Did you physically see Cesar
take your watch?

541
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,920
No, I didn't.

542
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,760
Gentlemen...

543
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,040
...unless we have reasonable cause
to show they took your watch...

544
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,000
... I can't authorize a locker search.

545
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,720
Sorry.

546
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,600
That was my grandfather' s watch.
can't you see what they' re doing?

547
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,880
Didn't you ever teach?

548
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,320
I' m afraid I never had the privilege.

549
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,240
Teaching and being a principal
don't necessarily go hand in hand.

550
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,040
That's beside the point--

551
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,840
Have a good day.

552
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,640
Why didn't you say something?

553
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,000
The asshole's a politician.
He's got every angle covered.

554
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,280
-I'm thinking of videotaping my classes.
-You want some free advice?

555
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,080
Cover your ass.

556
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,200
If Garcia asks, the camera' s purpose
is to observe you, not the students.

557
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,360
I mean his "clients".

558
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,680
Some gangbanger might think...

559
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,600
...we' re violating his civil rights.

560
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,680
Sorry, lris, completely forgot.

561
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,800
Right.

562
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,520
I wanna talk to you
about the discipline committee.

563
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,400
I gotta make a run up to the office.

564
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,080
Go ahead. I can wait.

565
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,160
I have to fly up there
for a computer conference.

566
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,120
When's that?

567
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,720
Day after tomorrow.

568
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,520
I've never been to San Francisco.

569
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,880
You should go sometime.
You'd really like it.

570
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,360
It' s only about an hour by air,
or five or six by car...

571
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,400
... but it has a totally
different attitude than L.A.

572
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,920
The only problem is,
I hate to leave Jack with my mother.

573
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,800
I' m afraid that she'll forget
to feed him and he'll starve to death.

574
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,920
So anyway, San Francisco's more like
a real city, like Chicago or New Y ork.

575
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,000
Or Baghdad...

576
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,200
...or Mars.

577
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,240
I'll take care of Jack for you
while you're gone.

578
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,920
Aren't you supposed to be in P. E.?

579
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,280
These boys are tripping, man!
Old lady's fucked up!

580
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,560
-I gotta make J.C. next year. I got to!
-Calm down.

581
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,320
I'll never get out of here!

582
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,240
That bitch, Quinn!
I'm gonna sue her ass. I swear to God!

583
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,200
Okay, Rita, slow down.

584
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,880
What's she teach?

585
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,040
English Comp. She's failing me!

586
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,160
She hates me! She's racist against me!

587
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,800
Just because you' re Latina--

588
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,400
I' m Chicana!

589
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,680
Okay. Chicana.

590
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,080
Stop blaming everybody else.
You're too smart for that.

591
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,200
Whatever's wrong with that essay
is correctable.

592
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,520
May I see it?

593
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,080
Use some of that tissue there.

594
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,840
Why do you wear so much makeup?

595
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,880
-To make me pretty.
-You don't need it.

596
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,160
Who' s Puppet?

597
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,600
Nothing.

598
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,240
It' s a gang thing...

599
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,240
... but I'm kicking that shit.

600
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,000
Because I look like I'm down for my
neighborhood don't mean I'm stupid.

601
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,680
The ideas in your essay
aren't the problem.

602
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,800
It's your punctuation and grammar.

603
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,360
They need work. Am I lying?

604
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,280
If you need help, I'm here for you.

605
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,400
I don't know.

606
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,000
"I don't know"?

607
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,640
Why' d you come here?

608
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,320
Look, we can meet in the library,
all right?

609
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,400
Somebody might see us.

610
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,040
I'll come to your house.

611
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,400
No way.

612
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,960
You pick a place.

613
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,600
You want something to drink?

614
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,040
I got...

615
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,440
...Coke, Sprite, juice.

616
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,560
Cola' s all right.

617
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:16,000
You know, you're not the only one
whose reputation's on the line here.

618
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,520
I don't normally tutor students
at my house.

619
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,040
Since you're here, maybe you can
clear something up for me.

620
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,840
This whole machismo code-of-honor thing.

621
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,440
I mean, come on...

622
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,560
...is pride really worth dying for?

623
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,960
Put your clothes on.

624
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,200
Okay, okay. No harm done.

625
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,280
Come on, come on, come on.
Don't cry.

626
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,880
I just wanted to thank you.

627
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,600
You don't have to thank me.
I'm your teacher.

628
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,600
Maybe we'd better meet in the library
from now on, okay?

629
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,040
Hey, homey, what' s up with that?

630
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,880
Dog!

631
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,480
You invading my privacy, bitch!

632
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,080
Cesar, come up here.

633
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,880
Shit!

634
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,760
I hope you ain't sending this shit
to Most Wanted.

635
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,080
Let me fix my shit so I look good.

636
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,480
Since you were so concerned about
my watch, you might like to know...

637
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,800
... I found it.

638
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,880
You broke into my locker, Mr. G.

639
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,800
It' s a serious felony.

640
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,880
Caught yourself a case for sure now.

641
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,080
Really?

642
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,320
And what do you propose to do?

643
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,960
Tell Garcia?

644
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,920
And what are you gonna tell him?

645
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,160
That I broke into your locker and
stole the watch that you denied taking?

646
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,280
I don't think so.

647
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,560
What do you say we call this even?

648
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,920
I say we just getting started, Mr. G.

649
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,320
Maybe I'll have someone
from the office call your mother.

650
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,720
I thought you knew.
Us poor Mexicans, we don't got phones.

651
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,640
I'll try.

652
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,000
I ain't getting that door.

653
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,680
You hear me?

654
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,960
What the hell you doing here?

655
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,000
I didn't say you could
come to my house.

656
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,480
Look, Cesar.

657
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,840
I came here to see
if we could squash all this.

658
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,400
You ain't got no motherfucking right!

659
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,840
Get the hell out of here!

660
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,680
Why don't we just start over?

661
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,160
Puto, you lied to my homeboy Benny.

662
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,240
You told him you speak no Spanish.

663
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,200
-No, I didn't.
-That's fucking bullshit, ese!

664
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,440
You like hitting on your mother, Cesar?

665
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,000
You must be proud of yourself.

666
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,920
-What's he talking about?
-He' s lying.

667
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,720
Fucking mentiroso!

668
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,800
Homeboy don't never lie
to his jefita! Never disrespects!

669
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:21,960
Whatever you say.

670
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,640
Do whatever I say!
I'll find where you live!

671
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,720
The party's getting started, homes!

672
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,440
Get your fucking ass out of here!

673
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,360
Look at this. Look at this shit.

674
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,520
Man!

675
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,160
Whoever did this is gonna pay.

676
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,640
You better believe it, eses.

677
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:05,920
Get out of here!

678
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,880
Get these kids out of here!

679
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,120
Barsek?

680
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,560
Don't touch anything!

681
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,560
Look at the rat, man.

682
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,200
What? "Look at the rat, man."
You think that' s funny?

683
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,600
Did you do that?
Did you do that to that rat?

684
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,080
Let him go!

685
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:35,080
He didn't do anything! He's a good kid!
You act like this is your place!

686
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,680
Maybe you should take care
of your place!

687
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,360
Now get out of here!

688
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,680
Get the hell out of here, you assholes!

689
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,480
That's him now.

690
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,360
Come on, Bogart.

691
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,840
That shit is bad, bro.

692
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,400
Put that shit out, man.
Here comes Garfield.

693
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,000
You smoking the chronic, Cesar?

694
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,440
No, man. I ain't hooked on chronic.

695
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,080
I'm hooked on phonics.

696
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,560
You wouldn't know who vandalized
Bungalow 86, would you?

697
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,400
Bungalow 86?
You guys know about Bungalow 86?

698
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,720
Sorry, maestro.

699
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,280
Nada.

700
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,120
You know...

701
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,240
...Garcia may not be able
to prove anything...

702
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,680
... but you and I both know
who' s responsible, don't we?

703
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,480
I'm serious, man. I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

704
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,320
The ring, Cesar.

705
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,920
Give it to me.

706
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,600
You better watch it, man.
That's my trigger finger.

707
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,040
It's inappropriate attire!

708
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,560
Are you finished?

709
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,760
What? Am I finished?

710
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,880
Is that what you said?
Don't try to get crazy on me.

711
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,960
You wanna bring it on, let's go!

712
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,160
What you gonna do?

713
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,360
Get the fuck out of here!

714
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,640
Fucking bitch!

715
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,760
These conferences mainly focus
on software now.

716
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,400
Y eah, well, software sells.

717
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,440
How's Jack?

718
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:46,920
Jack' s good.

719
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,440
And how's Trevor?
Has Trevor been behaving himself?

720
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,320
What' s that supposed to mean?

721
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,880
-ls that supposed to mean something?
-lt doesn't mean anything.

722
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,280
I' m talking to the lady! All right?

723
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,240
Sorry, all right?

724
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,800
Forgive me?

725
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,920
-Should I grab this?
-Later.

726
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,560
Do you wanna see Jack?

727
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,760
Jack, your mommy' s home!

728
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,200
Come here, Jack!

729
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,360
Come on, sweetheart.

730
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,080
Here, boy!

731
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,960
It' s weird. Usually
he just comes when I call.

732
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,640
He' s right back here.

733
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,000
Oh, my God!

734
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,240
Oh, my God! Jack!

735
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,000
Don't look! Don't!

736
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,840
Let me get to him!

737
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,280
Don't look!

738
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,880
Oh, my God!

739
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,280
Don't beat yourself up too much.

740
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,760
Whatever it was,
he jumped over the fence.

741
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,800
What can you do?

742
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,000
Aspirin?

743
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,400
Thanks.

744
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,360
You know, Trevor,
I don't think that I can...

745
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,240
...talk to you right now.

746
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,960
I'm so upset that I can't even drive.

747
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,200
I just think it would
just be best if you just....

748
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,920
If I was just alone.

749
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,240
I' m sorry, Ellen.

750
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,880
Paco, is that you?

751
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,120
Stupid gato.

752
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,320
Stupid lndians.

753
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:46,800
They got some good shit!

754
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,160
Where's the aspirin?

755
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,200
Come on, you can do better than that.

756
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,000
I put it on my mother, detective.

757
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,480
So your teacher drugged you,
then chopped off your finger?

758
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,040
Y eah, it had to be him.

759
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,040
He smoked the mota for you too?

760
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,480
Fucking nigger hates my guts!
All right?

761
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,600
Who you covering for, homes?

762
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,120
This circumstantial bullshit
ain't gonna hold up in court.

763
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,560
Too many priors:
juvenile GTA, vandalism.

764
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,840
I know it was him! Listen to me, man!

765
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,320
-You saw his face?
-Y eah, I saw his face!

766
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,520
Let me save you from perjuring yourself.

767
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:16,760
You' re full of shit.

768
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,720
I swear to God, I know it was him.

769
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,680
This guy's wasting our time.

770
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,600
You come up with the truth,
you give us a call.

771
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:24,600
Later, homes.

772
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,120
File it under B, man.

773
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,600
"Bullshit."

774
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,400
All right.

775
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,520
Name one of the four parts...

776
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,560
...that make up the human hand.

777
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,480
Hands, please.

778
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,840
Christian?

779
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,120
Metacarpals?

780
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,440
That' s good. Anyone else? Rita.

781
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,960
The wrist and thumb.

782
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,320
Very good!

783
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,960
Come on, there' s one more
very important part.

784
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,520
One more!

785
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,520
Phalanges! Phalanges!

786
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,320
Everybody wiggle your phalanges.

787
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,760
Please!

788
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:23,520
Everybody wiggle them.
You too, "G's" in the back. Phalanges!

789
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,520
Can I come in?

790
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,240
Hi!

791
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,720
What happened to you the other night?

792
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,960
I was gonna ask you the same question.

793
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,480
I went for a run.

794
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,880
You wanna go for Chinese later?

795
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,080
There' s a new place.
I hear it' s good.

796
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,360
You know, I just--

797
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,320
I've got all this stuff
I have to put into the computer.

798
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,640
Maybe some other time.

799
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,680
Sure.

800
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,520
I probably need to grade some papers.

801
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,240
Some of those kids are starting
to care about a grade.

802
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,240
Even Cesar.

803
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,160
Today, for the first time since I took
over for Eskander, he did some work.

804
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,200
You all right?

805
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,080
I' m much better. Thanks.

806
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,480
Finished.

807
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:31,960
Mr. G.? Finished.

808
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,880
It' s broken.

809
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,720
It doesn't work.
I need three copies of this article!

810
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,120
You know, since your essay
deals with gangs...

811
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:48,800
...you probably could've left in
some of those double negatives you like.

812
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,680
So now you want me to use bad grammar?

813
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,640
Only when it suits your topic.

814
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,320
I know. We' re all
products of our environment.

815
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,800
I think everybody's responsible
for their own actions.

816
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,480
Now, see, this is like hip-hop.

817
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:08,360
If you take out all the bad grammar
it loses its impact.

818
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,040
You like hip-hop, Mr. G?

819
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,440
No, I hate it.

820
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,880
What kind of black man are you?

821
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,320
This really is a good essay.

822
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,720
You put in a lot of work. It shows.

823
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,600
Thanks, maestro.

824
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,440
It comes from the heart.

825
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,040
You think I could be...

826
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,440
...a writer?

827
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:36,360
Miss Quinn picks two seniors to read
their essays every year at graduation.

828
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,320
She ain't gonna pick mine!

829
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,320
I don't wanna get up
in front of all those people.

830
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,200
-Make a fool out of myself.
-Really? Why?

831
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,840
You afraid it might be
some kind of Pyrrhic victory?

832
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,040
What's that?

833
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,160
Tell you what...

834
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,840
...Iook it up.

835
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,400
You see, you can't do that.

836
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,600
Either you'd need different software...

837
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,000
...or you'd have to sweep your
hard drive, taking two days.

838
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,280
Before we get sidetracked
with viruses and TSR programs...

839
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,000
...yesterday we were talking
about e-mail.

840
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:31,040
So if you click the icon
at the bottom of your screen...

841
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,480
...you'll be able to
send and receive mail.

842
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,680
Go ahead and click the white envelope.

843
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,720
You've got mail.

844
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,240
Okay, someone's way ahead of me.
All right.

845
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,760
Double click "open/read".

846
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:15,840
That person isn't as anonymous
as they think they are.

847
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,080
You've got mail.

848
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,440
That's bullshit!

849
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,040
Better step off, Mrs. H!

850
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,360
You can't fucking prove anything!

851
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,720
And I know you can't afford
to lose this minimum-wage job of yours.

852
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,560
You know, you' re right.

853
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,400
I can't afford to live in a big house
south of the boulevard like you do.

854
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,480
Fuck you!

855
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:06,240
-Have you seen Stevie Littleton?
-No, haven't seen him.

856
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:09,040
You're not supposed to leave
your classroom unattended.

857
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,480
Sue me!

858
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,040
Benny Chacon's mother.

859
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,720
I told her Garcia had to leave early,
but she just sits there.

860
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,520
She's been saying
some pretty crazy things.

861
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,640
Mrs. Chacon?

862
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,560
I' m Ellen Henry. Benny's in my class.

863
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,000
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

864
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,760
What is she saying?

865
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,480
You heard about that body
they found in the L.A. River?

866
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,720
She says she thinks it's Benny.

867
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,120
You say he's been missing
approximately four weeks?

868
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,480
Four or five weeks.

869
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:27,800
She speak English?

870
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,000
No.

871
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:32,040
We get 80 to 90
bodies a month sometimes.

872
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,760
Gangbangers, illegals...

873
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,040
...floaters.

874
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,440
Nobody' s even looking for them.

875
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,880
But if you ask me, this kid was dead
before he got his head caved in.

876
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,600
Overdose of morphine.
That's what it looks like to me.

877
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,440
On the phone you said that...

878
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,480
...the mother mentioned
some identifying marks.

879
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:53,800
Y es.

880
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,800
She said he had pockmarks on his chest
from a bad case of chicken pox...

881
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,960
...and a bar-code tattoo
on the back of his neck.

882
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,880
Did you find any rosary beads
on the body?

883
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,040
No.

884
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,440
Who is it?

885
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,960
It' s me.

886
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,480
What's the matter?

887
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,760
I just want you to tell me one thing.

888
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:03,280
If you had any idea what I was thinking
lately, you'd think I was crazy.

889
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,200
You remember the body
that they found in the L.A. River?

890
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,080
It was Benny.

891
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:21,720
Who told you that?

892
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,680
Benny's mother identified the body.

893
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,880
You know Benny was no saint.

894
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,640
He hurt a lot of people.

895
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,360
Before we go shedding tears over him,
we should remember that.

896
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:48,240
In an odd sort of way
he may be better off.

897
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:49,360
I know we are.

898
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,720
Don't you feel safer with Benny gone?

899
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,600
Don't you think he deserved to....

900
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,840
You don't know anything...

901
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,280
...about Cesar' s finger, do you?

902
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,720
Did you know...

903
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,040
...Cesar beats his mother?

904
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:15,520
He was here the night J ack died.
In the back.

905
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,280
What are you talking about?

906
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,800
Jack was provoked.
It was no accident. Cesar killed him.

907
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:26,880
What happened to Cesar was inevitable.

908
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:31,400
At some point, people have to take
responsibility for their actions.

909
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,960
I mean, he and Benny were takers.

910
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,080
They want what they want
when they want it.

911
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,360
And we can't expect the system
to protect us.

912
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,800
Where did you get these?

913
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,360
I admire you.

914
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,080
Like you, I used to think
the world was this great place...

915
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:13,280
...where everybody lived
by the same standard I did.

916
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,920
Then some kid with a nail...

917
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,560
...showed me I was living in his world.

918
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,520
A world where chaos rules, not order.

919
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,800
A world where righteousness
is not rewarded.

920
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,640
That' s Cesar' s world.

921
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,400
And if you' re not willing
to play by his rules...

922
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,320
...then you're gonna
have to pay the price.

923
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,560
I don't know you.

924
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,120
I don't know who you are.

925
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,520
I don't know you!

926
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,440
You do know me. I'm a teacher.

927
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,440
Just like you.

928
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,360
I'm talking to you, Garfield.

929
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,280
I know what you did to Cesar.

930
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,680
I' m thinking maybe you did Benny too.

931
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,000
Is that possible?

932
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,880
Did you bash his skull in?

933
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,600
What did you fuck him up with?

934
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,400
You killed my friend!

935
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,360
Let me by.

936
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,800
I want an answer!

937
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,040
Leave me alone!

938
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,000
I'll kill you--

939
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:38,680
Schoolgirl bitch!

940
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,360
What the fuck is your problem?

941
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:42,840
You' re fucking maestro!

942
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,120
What you talking about?

943
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,240
-Garfield killed Benny.
-You' re crazy!

944
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:49,240
Don't turn your back
when l' m talking! Come here!

945
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,400
You think you better
than everybody else?

946
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,200
Because you ain't!

947
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,200
Shut up!

948
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,640
You forget all the good times we had?

949
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:59,040
We all had our time with you.

950
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,720
What the fuck
you fucking that nigger for?

951
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,240
You think he'll protect you?

952
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,560
IKeep me from doing
what I want with you?

953
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,760
Fuck you! Stupid little bitch!

954
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,520
You want some meat on a roll?

955
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,320
Come on!

956
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,480
Rita!

957
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,120
Garfield better watch his back!

958
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,960
What the fuck you gonna do?

959
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:42,920
Fuck you, bitch!

960
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,320
The death of Benito Chacon
is not gang-related.

961
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:52,800
That is something you heard on the news.

962
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,080
It is wrong. It is misinformation.

963
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,320
Wait a minute.

964
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,800
How can you be so sure? We' re talking
about the safety of my kid.

965
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,680
Everyone, please just stay calm.

966
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:03,840
Thank you, Mrs. Ford.

967
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:07,920
The police at this point aren't
even sure if it' s a murder case.

968
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,800
The reason we' re meeting...

969
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,920
...is to quash all rumors
that may be floating around out there.

970
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,520
This is what we do know.

971
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:22,760
Benny Chacon ultimately died
of a drug overdose.

972
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:29,080
Technically, it was morphine,
which is what heroin breaks down into.

973
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,880
That's bullshit!

974
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,080
Benny was no junkie!

975
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,880
I know who did it. It ain't
the gangs you gotta be worrying about.

976
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,040
It's the teachers!

977
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,760
That's exactly the kind of rumor
we don't need.

978
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,240
It was Garfield!

979
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,120
Sit down!

980
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,320
Say one more word and you' re suspended.

981
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,440
You' re a fucking murderer, Garfield!

982
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,680
Maybe I can't prove it, but
he fucked up Cesar and killed Benny!

983
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,880
Victor, please.

984
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:01,480
It's the truth, ain't it, G?
Ask him.

985
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,960
Touch me and I'll sue your ass!

986
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,200
You' re dead, G! You' re fucking dead!

987
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,400
Garfield, wait up, man!

988
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,080
Come on!

989
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,560
You' re not gonna let that
punk get to you, are you?

990
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:30,520
He's a tweaker, a speed freak.
Don't let that punk scare you.

991
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,720
What do you want?
How can I help you?

992
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:35,280
How about you give me a ride home?

993
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:38,720
My old lady wouldn't give me
the car this morning. She's a bitch.

994
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,040
You smell like beer.

995
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,680
I only had two.
I swear that's all I had.

996
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:44,960
Come on, give me a ride.

997
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,080
I live right over here off Chandler.

998
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,520
I'll buy you a drink.

999
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:49,840
Come on!

1000
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,200
Get in!

1001
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,560
What do you drink?

1002
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,560
Scotch? Bourbon? Beer? Gin?

1003
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,080
Hurry up, will you? I gotta pee.

1004
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:04,520
I had a similar situation happen to me
about the time of the Night Stalker.

1005
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,040
Whole city was scared shitless.

1006
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:11,840
My old lady thought that the mailman was
the Stalker for a couple of weeks there.

1007
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:17,120
But then some mental midget
from my 4th period...

1008
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:20,960
...gets this idea. He starts this rumor
that l' m the Night Stalker.

1009
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,760
I mean, even after
they caught that Ramirez.

1010
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:28,240
I could still hear this guy saying,
"No, no, you got the wrong guy.

1011
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,600
Childress is the stalker, ese."

1012
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,000
Idiots!

1013
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,640
It's getting late. I better go.

1014
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,200
Thanks for the soda.

1015
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,920
Hold your horses, man!

1016
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,520
can't let you leave...

1017
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,200
...without meeting the kids.

1018
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,080
Come on. Come on back.

1019
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,600
What we got here? Well, this gun...

1020
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,760
...is from Czechoslovakia.

1021
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:03,960
This is a CZ. 22 automatic
1 0-round clip.

1022
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:07,080
Glow -in-the-dark sights.

1023
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,080
ain't that a beauty?

1024
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,080
All right.

1025
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,280
I got a custom Smitty 9 milli...

1026
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:18,280
...with extended grip.

1027
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,640
Because as you know...

1028
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,440
...them Smith & Wesson...

1029
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,520
...they kick like a mother!

1030
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,160
Here it is.

1031
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,120
This is a beauty.

1032
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,000
This is a Glock. 2 1.

1033
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,000
The lightest handgun...

1034
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,720
...in the world.

1035
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:43,960
The barrel, firing pin are made out
of metal, but everything else on this...

1036
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:45,560
...is made out of plastic.

1037
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,440
Go ahead. Feel that.

1038
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,200
Go ahead, take it!

1039
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,440
Because you know...

1040
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,800
...you never can be too prepared.

1041
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,880
My pukey little Colt.380!

1042
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,480
You wear that thing to school?

1043
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:00,840
Come on, Garfield!

1044
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,880
Jesus Christ! They don't check
teachers with the metal detectors.

1045
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:08,240
I got a.357 in my desk.
Of course you know that!

1046
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,000
I was paying attention.

1047
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:12,440
You should've seen
the look on your face.

1048
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,000
You know, Jose....

1049
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:19,720
I told you!

1050
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:22,040
Stay in your cotton-picking seat, boy!

1051
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,840
Don't tell me you never wanted to blow
one of these bastards away.

1052
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:40,120
Speaking of blowing, you ever
wanna fuck a high-school chick?

1053
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,480
Because I caught your girl Rita!

1054
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:46,680
Caught her in the utility shed
couple of months back busting the train.

1055
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,440
Must've had 5 or 6 cholos
lined up back there.

1056
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,160
Let's face it, brother,
the girl's a slut.

1057
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,320
She's a slut!

1058
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,840
Come on, man, I know you did her.

1059
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,800
I know you had her. Even I had her!

1060
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:05,920
You're drunk.

1061
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,080
So fucking what? I'm drunk.

1062
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,840
I' m kicking it with you, you know.

1063
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:13,160
I'm sitting here...

1064
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,000
... I'm talking to you about
screwing broads...

1065
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:21,520
...and you're sitting here copping
the self-righteous attitude.

1066
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,840
So what gives?

1067
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,160
I mean, did....

1068
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,240
Did you do it, Garfield?

1069
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,200
Did you whack Benny?

1070
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,000
You can tell me.

1071
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,120
I ain't gonna tell anybody.

1072
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,000
What about Cesar?

1073
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:48,040
I thought it was generous
just taking off his little finger.

1074
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,760
I would've cut off his balls.

1075
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,120
Go to hell, Dave.

1076
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,200
What?

1077
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,840
You did do it.

1078
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,040
Son of a bitch!

1079
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,320
You crazy motherfucker, you did!

1080
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:13,800
You probably think you and I are alike.

1081
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,440
We' re not.

1082
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:27,640
Good night.

1083
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:32,760
Good night.

1084
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,240
Peace.

1085
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,360
You're still in school.
You're just 1 5.

1086
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:58,360
Yeah, I am.

1087
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,080
What kind of a future plan do you have?

1088
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:03,840
I know I'm gonna have to
tone down my looks.

1089
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:07,440
There's a lot of jobs where
you can actually wear hats.

1090
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,200
Go ahead, Nicky. Go ahead, just do it.

1091
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,160
Pull it, pull it!

1092
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:17,320
You got an empty chamber in that gun!
Put an empty chamber in that gun!

1093
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:31,320
I don't thin k she' s coming today.

1094
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,560
What you doing here?

1095
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,840
I missed you this morning.
What happened?

1096
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:38,120
I came by to make sure you' re all right.

1097
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:39,840
You okay?

1098
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,440
If you don't take finals,
you won't graduate.

1099
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,360
I ain't going back,
so forget it.

1100
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,920
I promise you Stevie and Cesar
won't bother you.

1101
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:52,320
It don't matter.
School's just for other kids.

1102
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:53,720
Not me.

1103
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,480
Come on, you know you don't mean that.

1104
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:59,040
You're doing so well.
Don't throw it all away.

1105
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:00,720
How about that essay?

1106
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:02,160
How'd you do?

1107
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,280
You still wanna be a writer, don't you?

1108
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,960
Listen, l....

1109
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:13,960
I know about Childress.

1110
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:15,800
What?

1111
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,840
He' ll never touch you again.
I promise.

1112
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:21,800
He' s full of shit!

1113
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,440
Get out! I don't need your pity.
I don't need you.

1114
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:29,480
You made a mistake, that's all.

1115
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,080
You see these?

1116
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,400
Phone calls about you.

1117
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,080
Good ones.

1118
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:03,880
Cesar' s mother told me
how you tried to help him.

1119
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,920
You' re evidently a good teacher.

1120
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,320
However...

1121
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:15,000
... I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to let you go.

1122
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:21,280
As much as I'd like to have you stay
until the end of the year...

1123
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:25,600
... I can't overlook the seriousness
of certain accusations.

1124
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:31,520
Is it true that you had meetings
with a female student at your house?

1125
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,120
I was trying to help her.

1126
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,880
The implications are still there.

1127
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:46,840
I can't afford to open the door
for another lawsuit.

1128
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,160
I' m sure you can appreciate my position.

1129
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:02,240
You can stay till Friday.

1130
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,080
I hope that'll be sufficient.

1131
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,680
I don't think you' re being an alarmist.

1132
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:30,400
He gets a little overzealous at times...

1133
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,640
...Iike some other people I know.

1134
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:36,520
I don't think the rosary
adds up to much either.

1135
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:37,520
Why?

1136
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:39,360
It' s probably his.

1137
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:43,120
When I received
my First Holy Communion...

1138
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:46,840
...all the boys got black rosaries,
all the girls got white rosaries.

1139
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,920
Trust me, there must be
millions of black rosaries...

1140
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:53,280
...filed away in desk drawers
from here to the Vatican.

1141
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:59,400
The guy's been through a lot.
The system failed him.

1142
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:04,000
I don't think any of us can really
appreciate what he's been through.

1143
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,800
I say we give the man a break.

1144
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,720
You dogs ready to do this?

1145
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:16,640
Once we go in, we don't come out
till that nigga's dead.

1146
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:18,760
You hear me?

1147
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,120
Got that right.

1148
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,920
Then you down with lK.O.S.

1149
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:24,000
That's what I been waiting for, ese.

1150
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:27,360
Y eah, l' m down.

1151
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:28,880
Any of you leave...

1152
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,360
... I'll kill you myself.

1153
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,720
You know what to do.

1154
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,680
Where' d you jack this car from, homes?

1155
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,400
Shit' s nasty.

1156
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:02,360
Let's smoke this bitch.

1157
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:47,600
I'm in here, Cesar.

1158
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,720
Don't you move, Garfield.

1159
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,360
Don't you make a move.

1160
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,640
You killed my homeboy Benny.

1161
01:39:57,880 --> 01:39:59,840
And you cut off my finger.

1162
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,040
Now let me hear you say that.

1163
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,440
Y eah, I did it.

1164
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,120
I told you, man!

1165
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:08,120
Fucking A!

1166
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:11,480
Let me do him.

1167
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:13,200
No.

1168
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,840
This nigga's mine.

1169
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,360
You ever seen Deer Hunter?

1170
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:37,560
Put it to your head...

1171
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:40,560
... pull the trigger.

1172
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,120
You gonna do yourself.

1173
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:04,000
That macho enough for you?

1174
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:06,880
That make me a man?

1175
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:09,320
Take more than that to be me.

1176
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:10,680
Y eah?

1177
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:12,320
Then you do it.

1178
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:14,840
Come on, maricon.

1179
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:15,920
Do it!

1180
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:18,840
Vato's scared.

1181
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:20,400
He' s trying to weasel out.

1182
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:21,960
He' s fucking with your head!

1183
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:36,800
Come on.

1184
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:39,400
That's not how we playing the game.

1185
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:43,600
Not man enough to play your own game?

1186
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,360
Where's your cojones?

1187
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,000
Shut up!

1188
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,480
You gonna hide behind your homeboys?

1189
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,560
Where's your pride?

1190
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:02,600
Come on, I pulled three times.
You ain't pulled once.

1191
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:13,240
What are you doing, man?

1192
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,880
You disrespecting me?

1193
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:19,720
You saying I ain't a man?

1194
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,600
I'm saying you're a fool.

1195
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,480
Don't be doing that shit, man!

1196
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:30,880
You the man, Cesar.

1197
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:34,240
You the man, and you ain't shit!
You hear me?

1198
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:36,640
He got character
and you ain't got shit!

1199
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:37,640
What the fuck?

1200
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,680
Y eah, shoot his ass, homey.

1201
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:47,240
Your turn.

1202
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:50,120
You got some respect back now?

1203
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:53,120
The only thing you respect
is stupidity.

1204
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,360
You willing to die for stupidity?

1205
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,320
See, I am, if it'll teach you something.

1206
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,560
You can't kill me, homeboy.

1207
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:09,880
What I am, what I was,
died over a year ago.

1208
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:13,880
Everything I've ever wanted
has been taken from me.

1209
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:16,880
And no matter how many of you
I get rid of...

1210
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:19,600
... I can't get it back!

1211
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:22,160
I was a teacher!

1212
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,280
I wanted to help you!

1213
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,320
You can't kill me!

1214
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,200
And you can't scare me!

1215
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:32,640
He' s crazy, man.

1216
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:35,040
That's right!
Isn't that what you respect?

1217
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:37,120
Loco! Come on, Cesar!

1218
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:40,440
If you're gonna be stupid,
be all the way stupid!

1219
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:42,680
Put it to your head, pull the trigger!

1220
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:43,960
Do it!

1221
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:48,760
Do it!

1222
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,280
Do it!

1223
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:07,160
Your whole way of life is bullshit!

1224
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:10,320
Macho is bullshit!

1225
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,000
It's all I got!

1226
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:17,000
So now you' re the victim?

1227
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,760
Let me take your turn for you.

1228
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:25,880
Shit!

1229
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:28,600
He's out!

1230
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,320
He's fucking out!

1231
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:36,480
He smoked himself!

1232
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:38,120
Let's go.

1233
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,240
Oh, man! Let's go, homey.

1234
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:42,720
He took my turn.

1235
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:43,880
What?

1236
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,720
I could' ve taken
my own motherfucking turn.

1237
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:48,400
So fucking what? He' s dead.

1238
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:50,080
Let' s go! Come on!

1239
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:51,520
I've gotta do this.

1240
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:52,960
Fuck this!

1241
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:00,360
What are you doing? Let's go!

1242
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,880
I got one in six chances.

1243
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:05,680
I' m gonna beat this bitch.

1244
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:09,360
What the f--?

1245
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:23,200
Why' d you do that, man?

1246
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,920
What' s the fucking point?

1247
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:45,480
Somehow...

1248
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:48,240
... the sight of my own reflection...

1249
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,840
...increased my loneliness.

1250
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:04,480
The title of my essay is...

1251
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:06,160
... "Mi Salida"...

1252
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:07,520
... "My Way Out".

1253
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:12,640
There' s been a lot of tal k
the last cou ple of weeks...

1254
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:17,600
...about whether Mr. Garfield done
what they wrote about in the newspapers.

1255
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:24,480
He once told me that you can't blame
everything on your environment.

1256
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:27,640
But I think you can push
a good teacher too far.

1257
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:30,680
And he'll go bad like anybody else.

1258
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:34,640
I don't know if Mr. G.
done all those bad things.

1259
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:38,680
But what I do know is that
teachers don't get no respect.

1260
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:42,720
I' m up here today
because of him.

1261
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,840
He was there for me
when nobody else was.

1262
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:51,520
The thing is,
I should've been there for him too.

1263
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:58,200
I didn't wanna stand up here today.

1264
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:01,800
But Mr. G. asked me...

1265
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:06,960
...if I was afraid it
would be a Pyrrhic victory.

1266
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:10,480
And I asked him,
"What' s up with that?"

1267
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:14,240
He said to go look it up, so I did.

1268
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:21,440
This is called a city.

1269
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:23,920
Human beings used to live here.

1270
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:26,520
It refers to this guy named Pyrrhus.

1271
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:30,280
He was a king around 300 B. C.

1272
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:33,000
Pyrrhus defeated the Romans...

1273
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:35,440
... on two separate occasions.

1274
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:38,400
But those victories cost him
a large part of his army.

1275
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,800
So now...

1276
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:00,160
...whenever somebody says...

1277
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:06,400
...that something
is a Pyrrhic victory...

1278
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:11,880
...they mean it' s a victory
gained at too great a cost.

1279
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:42,000
A teacher wrote this movie.
