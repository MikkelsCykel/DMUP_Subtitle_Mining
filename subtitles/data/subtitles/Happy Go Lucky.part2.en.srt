00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,710
You know what I mean, you know?

7
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:25,147
You know?

8
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:27,110
- You know?
- I know.

9
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:31,069
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's...

10
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,393
Isn't it just?

11
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,794
<i>You know? You know, it's...</i>

12
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,473
You know, they, they, they, they, they...

13
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:40,958
Do they?

14
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:43,274
They're not, they're not, they're not, they're not!

15
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,753
They're not, you know?

16
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,312
Oh.

17
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,075
Are you warm enough?

18
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,311
# I know, I said that I was leaving

19
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:11,157
- That's nice.
<i>- He's, he's, he's...</i>

20
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,191
<i>- Is he?</i>
- You know, he's...

21
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,912
<i>Ah, now, and he's, he's...</i> <i>Oh, he's...</i>

22
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,271
Oh, no.

23
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,954
He's, he's, he's...

24
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:26,910
<i>- What is he?</i>
- He's a prick.

25
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,995
Oh! I know a few.

26
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,637
(Grunting)

27
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,555
There you go.

28
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:38,118
That's it. Yeah.

29
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,593
<i>- You know what I mean, you know?</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

<i>She's, she's, she's...</i>

31
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:45,239
She's, she's, she's, you know. She's, she's...

32
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:49,113
<i>You know. She's, she's, she's,</i>
<i>she was, she was...</i>

33
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,390
She was, she was, she was, she was...

34
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,077
- She was so...
- Was she?

35
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:56,872
She wouldn't, you know.
She wouldn't. She wouldn't, you know.

36
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:59,114
She wouldn't, and I'm, I'm... 
I'm not, you know.

37
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:04,392
I'm not, you know. I'm, I'm...
She's... you know. She's...

38
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,952
She's, you know. She's...

39
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:09,469
You know, they're, 
they're, they're, they're...

40
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,638
You know what I mean?

41
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,471
Yeah.

42
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,511
I do.

43
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:20,632
What's your name?

44
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,629
Hey?

45
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,954
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

46
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:26,990
- Taxi!
- (Giggles) That'll be for me.

47
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,790
Come on, 'sake.

48
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,757
Keep your hair on.

49
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,792
I've only just met you. Mum warned me
about going with strangers.

50
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,477
- Where are you going?
- Longest way out, shortest way home.

51
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,430
Oh, sod's law.

52
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,868
- Is he gone?
- All right. What?

53
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,550
- Is he gone?
- Ease up.

54
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:53,632
- What?
- Is he gone?

55
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:54,953
You what?

56
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:57,638
- Is he gone?
- Is who gone?

57
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,909
- The rubber knocker man.
- You what?

58
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,828
- The rubber knocker man.
- Oh! The rubber knocker man.

59
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,232
- Sssh.
- Why didn't you say?

60
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,918
- Is he gone?
- Yeah, yeah. No, he's gone, he's gone.

61
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,915
- 'Sake.
- I see him. He's a-running.

62
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,154
He's a-rubbing his knockers. He's gone.

63
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,110
Oh, he's gone. Hang about.

64
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,635
Oh, there you go.

65
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:26,634
Found the en suite, then.

66
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,790
Shake it all about.

67
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,871
What am I doing?

68
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,632
Oh, all done, then?

69
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:58,792
<i>All right?</i>

70
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,394
Have you had your dinner?

71
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,390
No.

72
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,995
- Here you are, take that.
- No.

73
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,708
- Something to eat.
- No, thank you.

74
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:47,998
- Where are you going to sleep tonight?
- In a bed.

75
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:52,029
Of course you are. Silly me.

76
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,431
What?

77
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,791
You know?

78
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,548
Yeah.

79
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,910
Next, please.

80
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,270
- Are you asleep?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

81
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,638
So what you been up to?

82
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,794
- This and that.
- Ducking and a-diving.

83
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,318
Wheeling and a-dealing.

84
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,474
- So where you been?
- Tooing and a-froing.

85
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,669
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

86
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:57,030
I went for a walk.

87
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,274
<i>Thought we were going out for a drink.</i>

88
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,628
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

89
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:04,716
- Left you a message.
- My battery died on me.

90
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,516
- So how was your day?
- How was your day?

91
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,470
Fantastic, the earth moved.

92
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,195
- I've got a violent pupil in my flock.
- What's he doing?

93
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:21,037
- Being violent.
- What, is he hitting you?

94
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,877
- He's been hitting the other kids.
- What are you doing about it?

95
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,830
I spoke to Heather.

96
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,950
Poor little bugger.

97
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:33,389
You've got to love them, haven't you?

98
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:35,555
Yeah, otherwise you'd kill them.

99
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,071
So where did you go tonight?

100
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,794
The eternal question. Where have we been?
Where are we going?

101
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,750
What's the meaning of life?

102
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,512
I went to the moon and then back again.

103
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,551
- Wow, you walk quickly.
- I've got good legs.

104
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:54,159
Yeah, you've got great legs.
Not that you're my type.

105
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:58,477
- These are great legs.
- Ah, get off. Read your palm.

106
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,994
Oh, I see a very strong line.

107
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:10,072
It's your bullshit line,
and I see a tall, dark, handsome... turd.

108
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,873
- Next to it is a bloke.
- A bloke?

109
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,557
- Yeah.
- Let's see.

110
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:19,194
Oh, yeah, there he is. Isn't he gorgeous?

111
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:21,150
- Not my type.
- No.

112
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,754
Where have all the good men gone, eh?

113
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,267
Well, they're not hiding in here, are they?

114
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,952
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
We're ready and waiting.

115
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,790
They haven't got the balls.

116
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,997
- All right, Nick?
- Yeah.

117
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,916
- How you doing there?
<i>- I'm reading.</i>

118
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,836
- What you reading?
- "Yuck!"

119
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,996
- "Yuck!" That's nice, isn't it?
- Oh, it's a classic, that.

120
00:09:57,439 --> 00:09:59,191
- Nick, this is Tim.
- Hi, Nick.

121
00:09:59,239 --> 00:09:59,910
Hello.

122
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,109
Now, Nick, when I asked you the other day,

123
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,911
did you know what a social worker was,

124
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,551
can you remember what you said?

125
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:10,548
A social worker helps you on... hard things.

126
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:13,238
A social worker helps you with hard things, yes.

127
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,235
- That's true.
- Yeah, very good.

128
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,315
That's right. And I was thinking,

129
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:20,271
how could I help Tim
to get to know you a bit better?

130
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,755
I was thinking, because you've done
some very good learning this year...

131
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,074
POPPY: Oh, I'd say so, yes.
- He has, hasn't he?

132
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:29,873
And I was thinking, would you mind
showing Tim some of your work?

133
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:32,398
- No.
- That's a good idea.

134
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:33,792
I'd love to see it.

135
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,228
Is that, "No, you don't want to"
or "No, you don't mind"?

136
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,588
- No, I don't mind.
- I didn't think you would.

137
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,994
Well, that's good, isn't it? What's it going to be?

138
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,348
- You come and sit here. Have a look.
- Oh, thanks.

139
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,755
- We should show off your maths.
TIM: Are you good at maths, Nick?

140
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,350
- Are you all right, sweet? A bit tired?
- Let's have a look at this. Here.

141
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,276
- What's this, then?
- Look.

142
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,311
- This is last term.
TIM: Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

143
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:59,748
POPPY: Oh, he's good at his numbers.
- Very good.

144
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,108
- Yeah, smiley faces.
- I'm going to see you later, OK?

145
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,753
- See you.
- Thanks, Mrs Stockman. See you soon.

146
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,838
- Smiley face, big smiley face there.
- Smiley face, ticks everywhere.

147
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,755
- Very good.
- All last term this was.

148
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,755
Isn't it? Not bad.

149
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,517
Is it good this term as well?

150
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,756
Er... yes, it's a bit on and off. Isn't it?

151
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:22,108
- Oh, yeah.
- Not so good.

152
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,468
- We'll get around that, though.
- Of course.

153
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,719
You know you're not in trouble, don't you, Nick?

154
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,318
- Yeah.
POPPY: <i>Yeah.</i>

155
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,998
No-one could be angry with you. Not for long.

156
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,595
You've been a bit angry, though, haven't you?

157
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,197
Yeah.

158
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:44,954
<i>- What's made you angry?</i>
- I don't know.

159
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:46,512
<i>You don't know?</i>

160
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,709
What's it like at home?

161
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,678
Fine.

162
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:52,994
<i>- Yeah, with you and your mum?</i>
- Yeah.

163
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:53,835
Yeah.

164
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,074
<i>- You get on with your mum, don't you?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

165
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:59,594
- Does anybody else come to the house?
<i>- No.</i>

166
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,756
No? What about any of Mummy's friends?

167
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,790
Has she got a boyfriend?

168
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,318
Yeah, she does.

169
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,669
<i>She does? What's his name?</i>

170
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:12,072
Jason.

171
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:13,916
<i>Jason.</i>

172
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,711
<i>Is Jason nice?</i>

173
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,317
No.

174
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,196
Has he been making you angry, Nick?

175
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:27,918
Yeah.

176
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,517
That's no good, is it?

177
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,633
Have you got a piece of paper, Miss Cross?

178
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,715
Yeah, sure we could rustle one up.

179
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,989
- You good at drawing, Nick?
- Yeah.

180
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,108
OK.

181
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:46,067
- Here we go.
- Let's get you a pencil.

182
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,670
There you go.

183
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,996
Take that, Nick, and what I'd like you to do,
is draw me a house.

184
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,513
Do you think you can do that?

185
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,117
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

186
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,831
Thought so.

187
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:03,555
<i>That's your mum, in her bedroom.</i>

188
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:06,070
<i>- And who else is there?</i>
- Jason.

189
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,627
<i>Jason's there. Where's he?</i>

190
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:12,067
- He's in the living room.
<i>- In the living room.</i>

191
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:15,758
<i>- You're all in different rooms, aren't you?</i>
- Mm-hm.

192
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,429
<i>Why are you in a different room to Jason?</i>

193
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,635
- Because he's not nice to me.
<i>- He's not nice. What does he do to you?</i>

194
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,158
He hits me.

195
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,515
- He hits you.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

196
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:32,118
<i>You know that's not right, don't you, Nick?</i>

197
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,909
- It was lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

198
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,677
Thank you. I think he'll be all right.

199
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,038
- Of course.
- Yeah.

200
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,549
- He's got a good teacher.
- Has he? Where is she? I can't see her.

201
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:49,318
- I'm looking at her.
- Oh. Thank you very much.

202
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:53,147
- I wouldn't mind looking at her again.
- She wouldn't mind looking at you again.

203
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,757
Really? That's good.

204
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,915
- Give us your number.
- OK, I'll write it down.

205
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,870
That's a start.

206
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,278
There you go.

207
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:09,879
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

208
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,830
- Goodbye.
- See you.

209
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,749
Are you all right? Had a good week?

210
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,710
- Yeah.
<i>- Oh, that's a bonus.</i>

211
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,112
Smells in here.

212
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:34,913
<i>I didn't know you had a dog.</i>

213
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,393
No, it isn't a dog. I just had a lesson.

214
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:39,634
<i>- Bit stinky, was he?</i>
- Could say that.

215
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,547
<i>- You got a dog?</i>
- No, I live in a flat.

216
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:48,717
Be cruel, wouldn't it? I'd love a dog.
Have you ever had a dog?

217
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,227
- Your mum and dad got a dog?
- My dad's dead.

218
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,190
<i>Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

219
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,394
- How do you get on with your mum?
<i>- I don't.</i>

220
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:57,394
Oh.

221
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,198
You live with your mum and dad?

222
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:04,070
No. (Chuckles)

223
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:06,553
How old do you think I am, 12?

224
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,114
- 22, 23?
<i>- Oh, I like you.</i>

225
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,070
You can stay.

226
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,351
I'm 30.

227
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,117
Old maid, now.

228
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,676
So, do you live on your own?

229
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:24,313
No. I live with my flatmate.

230
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:28,238
Nearly 10 years now. She done well, bless her.

231
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:31,794
- That's a long time.
- She's gorgeous. I love her.

232
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,951
What do you mean, you love her?

233
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:40,433
I mean, I love her. She loves me.
We love each other.

234
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,878
What, so you're...

235
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,356
What?

236
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,908
Yeah, that's it. That's us.

237
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,751
- You got a problem with that, Scott?
- No, nothing to do with me.

238
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,151
I don't think it is.

239
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,270
- OK, check your mirrors. Enrahah.
- Yeah, checking, checking.

240
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,072
Indicate and knock on the door,
let them know you want to come in.

241
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:20,395
Knock on the door, OK. Put your foot
down on the clutch. Put it in first gear.

242
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,873
OK, find your biting point just before you go.
OK, stop.

243
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,557
- What?
- Put the car in neutral.

244
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,430
Put the car in neutral, the hand brake on.

245
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,989
Take your hand off the steering wheel,
foot off the pedal, turn off the ignition.

246
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,870
- I haven't started.
<i>- I've stopped.</i>

247
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,308
- Now you tell me why I've stopped.
- Got a headache?

248
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:37,237
No. Yes! I have got a headache
and you tell me why I've got one.

249
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,158
Erm... I don't know. Time of the month?
Oh, give me a clue.

250
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,474
Well, think. Top to toe. Top to toe.

251
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,431
<i>- Boots, Poppy. Boots.</i>
- Oh, here we go.

252
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:49,357
Every week I ask you,
"Please wear appropriate footwear."

253
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,913
And every week you insist
on wearing those stupid boots.

254
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,154
- Yeah, sorry about that.
<i>- You know what this is?</i>

255
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:56,155
<i>- This is vanity before safety.</i>
- Oh, right.

256
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:59,032
"I'm sorry, Mrs Jones. I'm sorry.
Poppy killed your child,

257
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:02,230
but don't worry, she looked really cool
in her sexy, seductive boots."

258
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,190
- Am I keeping you awake at night?
<i>- No.</i>

259
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:05,558
Are you sure about that?

260
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:08,111
Shall we get on with the lesson?

261
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:09,956
Will you do something about your boots?

262
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:13,309
I don't think so. They're fine. I'm comfy in these.

263
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,475
A lot of people drive in heels.

264
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,395
Very well, on your head be it.

265
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,191
Yeah, okey-dokey.

266
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:31,116
Keep to the left of the centre. Enrahah. Enrahah.

267
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:32,911
When we come to this bend, what do we do?

268
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:36,156
- Are you expecting the worst?
<i>- We keep to the left.</i>

269
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:37,712
<i>We expect a juggernaut, OK?</i>

270
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,829
- Expect the worst.
- Expecting the worst.

271
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:41,995
- More gas, more gas.
<i>- Expecting the worst.</i>

272
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,392
- Expecting the worst.
<i>- More gas.</i>

273
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:46,556
- There's a juggernaut, get down!
- Poppy, put both hands on the wheel

274
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,351
and keep your eyes on the road!

275
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:51,072
- There was a juggernaut, Scott.
- There wasn't a juggernaut.

276
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,838
- That was a stupid thing to do, Poppy.
- There was a little...

277
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:55,995
- Give me gas. Give me gas.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

278
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,155
- I'm giving you gas.
- Away from the bend. Give me gas.

279
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:05,469
Right.

280
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,316
- Poppy.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

281
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,953
I am not going to allow you
to endanger both of us,

282
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,955
just for you to have your stupid little joke.

283
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:15,230
<i>I mean, if you want to make jokes,</i>
<i>if that's what you want to do,</i>

284
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,032
then I will gladly sit here
and you can take the mickey out of me

285
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,229
for £22.50 an hour - it's your money.

286
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,191
<i>- I'm big enough. I can take it.</i>
- Can you?

287
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:26,197
But I will not allow you
to endanger yourself, myself,

288
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,628
and other road users just for your amusement.

289
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,192
I wasn't taking the mickey, Scott.

290
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:32,707
- I'm sorry.
<i>- Don't touch me! Don't you touch me!</i>

291
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:35,557
Right, that's it. Get out!

292
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,159
- What's happening now?
- Get in the passenger seat.

293
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:41,236
- Why?
- The lesson is over. I'm taking you home.

294
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:45,637
Oh. So, that's that, then, is it?

295
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,593
<i>All right, then.</i>

296
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:57,107
Speak to the office and when they ask you,
tell them I can't teach you.

297
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:03,434
Fucking...!

298
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:06,232
Take it easy, Scott. It's all right. It's all right.

299
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:18,558
Well, come on, then. Let's go.
It's costing me enough money as it is.

300
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,947
All I ask is that you behave like an adult.

301
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:27,275
What? Like you, Scott?

302
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:34,557
It's like musical cars, this.

303
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:39,471
- What now?
- Get in the driver's seat, please.

304
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,396
I've never given up on a pupil.

305
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,113
Oh, so that bit's over, is it?
Oh, well, make your mind up.

306
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:51,757
Do you want to have a walk,
get a breath of fresh air or something?

307
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,710
No? All right, then.

308
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,951
Check your mirrors.

309
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:11,988
What about that guy you gave up on
the other week, eh?

310
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:15,035
He passed his test this morning.

311
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:18,389
- Oh, well, that's good.
<i>- He didn't deserve to.</i>

312
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:20,794
He was very rude.
He didn't even say thank you.

313
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:25,230
I don't know, some people. 
Doesn't take much.

314
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:27,315
<i>- It'sjust the little things.</i>
- That's right.

315
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,957
Enrahah.

316
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:32,069
Keep to the left of the centre of the road.

317
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,231
You can make jokes while you're driving,
but you will crash and you will die laughing.

318
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,511
Well, if you're going to go,
it's the best way to go, I suppose.

319
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,828
- Are you scared of death?
<i>- No, I'm not scared of death.</i>

320
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,439
I'm scared of dying. That's why I woke up.

321
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:52,470
- Oh, when did you wake up?
<i>- A long time ago.</i>

322
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,918
- Who set the alarm?
<i>- I did.</i>

323
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:56,268
- I opened my eyes and I saw.
<i>- And what did you see?</i>

324
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,107
You can laugh while Rome is burning,
but believe you me, Poppy, it is burning.

325
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,947
And if you don't wake up,
then you will be burnt to a cinder.

326
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:09,189
<i>I mean, look around you. What do you see?</i>
<i>Do you see happiness?</i>

327
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:12,788
Do you see a policy of bringing
happiness to people? No. No.

328
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,636
You see ignorance and fear.

329
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:17,477
You see... You see the disease
of multiculturalism,

330
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,111
and what is multiculturalism?

331
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:21,354
Multiculturalism is non-culturalism.

332
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:23,196
And why do they want non-culturalism?

333
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:25,673
Because they want to reduce collective will.

334
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:27,277
The American Dream never happened.

335
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,150
The American nightmare is already here.

336
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:30,632
Look at the Washington Monument.

337
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:34,308
It is 555 feet above the ground
and 111 feet below the ground.

338
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,193
555 plus 111 is 666.

339
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:41,072
666, Poppy. 666.

340
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,914
<i>Keep to the left of the centre of the road.</i>

341
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:50,427
Are you an only child, Scott?

342
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,754
Enrahah. Use all your mirrors.

343
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,710
Watch your speed.

344
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:19,518
Same time next week?

345
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,034
- Of course.
- Of course.

346
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,598
Stay happy.

347
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:48,949
- Oh, come on, Suzy.
- Don't worry, she'll be here.

348
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:50,910
What time's Helen expecting us?

349
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:54,076
- She wanted us there by four.
- She's going to go nuts.

350
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:57,156
Not much I can do about that. Runs in the family.

351
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,757
How was your lesson?

352
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:02,997
I don't know. Dark.

353
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,509
- How do you mean, dark?
- Dark as the night.

354
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:09,912
He hasn't been feeling you up, has he?

355
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,790
I'd like to see him try.

356
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,876
<i>Touching your knee instead of the gear stick,</i>
<i>that old chestnut.</i>

357
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:16,637
No.

358
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:18,749
You all right, Poppy?

359
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:22,958
Yeah. I think I'm just worried about Helen.

360
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:25,274
Really, how do you mean?

361
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:28,072
- Should have gone to see her ages ago.
- Yeah, families, eh?

362
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,791
<i>Oh, here's Suzy.</i>

363
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,511
- (Squealing)
POPPY: Here we are.

364
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:44,349
- Hello!
- Are you all right?

365
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,277
- (Laughter)
- Look at this! Oh, mind the tree.

366
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,476
- It's nice to stand up.
- All right, Poppy?

367
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:53,317
- All right, Jamie?
<i>- Suzy, mind your sister's new motor.</i>

368
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:55,151
<i>- You all right, Jamie?</i>
- All right?

369
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:57,030
- Yeah.
- Long time no see.

370
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,354
- Yeah, long time no see.
- All right, Suzy?

371
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:01,310
<i>- All right, Jamie?</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

372
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,748
Ooh, these are for you.

373
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:08,395
- I got you a little bottle of bubbly.
- Oh, thank you very much. It's lovely.

374
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:12,398
- All right. I'll pop these upstairs for you.
- Lovely, Jamie. Thank you very much.

375
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:15,237
- Isn't that lovely?
- I'm guessing we're having a barbecue.

376
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,190
Whatever gave you that idea, Suze?

377
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,432
- Keep on running, Jamie.
- Yeah.

378
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:23,676
Better put these down now, shall I?
That's a good idea. Having fun yet?

379
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,516
- Yeah.
<i>- Take your shoes off, Suzy.</i>

380
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,436
- All right!
<i>- And you too, Poppy.</i>

381
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:30,312
I'll give you the grand tour.
This is the downstairs toilet.

382
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:32,554
- Oh, I thought it was the wine cellar.
- I wish.

383
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:35,272
Through here, this is the living room.

384
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:38,629
Ta-da! Yeah, went with
a blue and silver theme in here.

385
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:40,715
Did you, Jamie? It's very nice, isn't it, Suze?

386
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,715
- Here's our dining area.
- Lovely.

387
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:45,910
There's usually another chair here.
But we put it outside for later.

388
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,187
- For the foxes?
- Yeah!

389
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:49,799
- We only got it last weekend, didn't we?
- Yeah, flat pack.

390
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,908
Really?

391
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:57,872
It's beautiful, Helen.
Haven't you got green fingers, eh?

392
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,035
<i>- Is it all right to smoke, Helen?</i>
- I suppose so.

393
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,149
Can you get the ash in the ashtray, please?

394
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:03,712
<i>I'll try not to miss the potty.</i>

395
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,795
- You've been trained.
<i>- Come and see my roses!</i>

396
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,797
- Oh, lovely.
- I only planted these this time last year.

397
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,989
- You didn't.
- They've done really well.

398
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,030
I want to grow them into a big bush.

399
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,797
- They smell lovely.
- Don't they just.

400
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,557
My lavender. Put that by the compost.

401
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:20,069
- Best place for it, really.
- Hydrangeas need perking up a bit.

402
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,632
Bit down in the dumps, is he?

403
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:24,074
Hello there, cheer up. Might never happen.

404
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:26,758
Busy Lizzies are doing very well.
Beautiful flowers.

405
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,677
- Been a bit busy, has she?
- Going to plant more of these next year.

406
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:31,710
- That looks crap.
- Thanks, Suzy.

407
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,636
- Eucalyptus.
- Oh, Zoe.

408
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,556
BOTH: Gum tree!

409
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,033
- Brings back memories, doesn't it?
- Yeah, the smell.

410
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,751
POPPY: G'day, blue, how's it going?

411
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,597
- Drinks up.
- Cheers, Jamie. Let me give you a hand.

412
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:45,153
- Cheers, everyone.
- Cheers.

413
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:48,958
So, you've spoken to Mum, then?

414
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:51,229
Yeah, I spoke to her last Sunday. She's all right.

415
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,235
- Lovely. She coming down?
- Yes.

416
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,110
What's she coming down with? Syphilis?

417
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:57,627
- When did you last speak to her, Suzy?
- Oh, leave it out.

418
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,590
- You should give her a ring.
- I spoke to her.

419
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:01,391
- They're very excited.
- Course they are.

420
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:02,997
They'll come down when the baby's born.

421
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,429
- Get on with the in-laws, do you, Jamie?
- Yeah, I do, as it goes.

422
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:09,676
- Yeah, you get on with Dad, don't you?
- We have a nice chat from time to time.

423
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:11,755
- Do you?
- That's more than we ever do.

424
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:14,267
Does it seem funny,
your little sister having a baby?

425
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,958
- Yeah, it is a bit weird.
- No, it's perfectly natural.

426
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:19,069
- I'm an auntie.
- Oh, yeah?

427
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:21,679
- Got two nieces. My brothers' kids.
- They're lovely.

428
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:24,517
- Yeah, well, they're all right.
- Oh, he's kicking.

429
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,155
Oh, yeah, that's amazing. Hello,
little man in there. It's your auntie speaking.

430
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:32,077
There's your other auntie here, Auntie Suzy.
Does she want a word?

431
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,952
- What are you going to call it?
- Yeah, have you chosen a name yet?

432
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:37,832
- We weren't going to say, were we?
- We're not telling anyone yet.

433
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:40,313
- Go on, your secret's safe with us.
- No, it's bad luck.

434
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,712
It's Nathan.

435
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:44,227
Oops. It's lovely.

436
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,076
- Nathan?
- Yeah.

437
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,031
- It's a lovely name, Helen.
- Is there a Nathan in the family?

438
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,912
- No.
- No, just feels right to us.

439
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:53,950
Well, that's the important thing.

440
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:56,957
- Nathan Lightfoot.
- Yes, Suzy, Nathan Lightfoot.

441
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:58,637
Nathan Lightfoot Esquire.

442
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,556
- It's boring.
- Take no notice of her.

443
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,794
- I'm not.
- Cheers. Cheers, Nathan.

444
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:06,758
- Let me get you another top up. Suzy?
- Oh, yeah, thanks, Jamie.

445
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:13,513
I know, let's have a go on your PlayStation,
Jamie.

446
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,787
- Yeah.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

447
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:17,069
- Yeah, I'll start it up.
- No, Jamie.

448
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,838
- Zoe's favourite, isn't it?
- Yeah, I can't get enough.

449
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:23,677
- What games you got?
- Sonic The Hedgehog, Splinter Cell.

450
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:25,471
- Cool.
<i>- We can't start with that now.</i>

451
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,793
- Why not?
- It's too late.

452
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,352
Is it? What's the time?

453
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,276
- Oh, five minutes.
<i>- No.</i>

454
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,628
- Come on, let's play.
<i>- Jamie, I said leave it.</i>

455
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:34,556
- All right, lovely.
- Sit down.

456
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,510
Oh, for fuck sake.

457
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,634
Bane of my life, PlayStations.

458
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:48,635
- Oh, you got one?
- No, the kids at school.

459
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:50,988
They're like that under the desks, aren't they?

460
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,155
- I always confiscate them in my class.
- Do you?

461
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:55,190
- What a surprise.
<i>- They must love that.</i>

462
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:58,754
- Well, maybe in the morning, eh?
- Yeah, before we go for a walk.

463
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:03,556
It's incredible to think
I'm going to get even bigger.

464
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:06,238
- Only 10 more weeks.
- Exciting, strap yourself in.

465
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:09,077
Doesn't it make you both feel
a little bit broody, you girls?

466
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,589
- No, actually. How about you, Zoe?
- Afraid not. With all due respect.

467
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:14,470
You want a baby, though, don't you, Poppy?

468
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,636
- No, thanks. I've just had a kebab.
- I didn't mean that. Eventually.

469
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,953
Maybe. Who knows?

470
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:21,149
At 35, you're considered a high-risk mum.

471
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:24,271
- Give me a chance, I've just turned 30.
- It's only five years away.

472
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:26,913
- You've got to make plans.
- A five-year plan? Like Stalin?

473
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:29,871
- When are you getting on the property ladder?
- I need a step up first.

474
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,877
- You got to get yourself a mortgage.
- We don't want the hassle.

475
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:36,195
- You need to invest your savings.
- I just stuff mine under the mattress.

476
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:38,799
- Have you got a pension yet?
- You got to be joking.

477
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:41,558
- Have you got a pension?
- We've both got pensions, haven't we?

478
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,352
- Oh, yeah.
- Great. Where are your Zimmer frames?

479
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,435
- You've got to take life seriously.
- Have I?

480
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:49,471
You can't get drunk every night, partying,
however much fun it is.

481
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,510
I don't get drunk every night. Do we?

482
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,790
- No, she's an adult now, your big sister.
- Unfortunately.

483
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:57,558
- You have to take responsibility, Poppy.
- OK, take it easy.

484
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,669
I am taking it easy.

485
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:01,471
I just want you to be happy, that's all.

486
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,918
I am happy.

487
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,597
- I don't think you are.
- I am.

488
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:08,837
I love my life. Yeah, it can be tough at times.
That's part of it, isn't it?

489
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:13,350
I've got a great job, brilliant kids, lovely flat.
I've got her to look at.

490
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:18,109
I've got amazing friends. I love my freedom.
I'm a lucky lady, I know that.

491
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,753
- All right, no need to rub it in.
- What am I rubbing in?

492
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,710
- I know what you're saying.
- What?

493
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,715
- You think I've taken the easy option.
- Hey.

494
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,272
Hang on, Helen. She didn't say that.

495
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:28,833
<i>- It's what she meant.</i>
- No, you're insecure about <i>your</i> life.

496
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:30,676
- All right, Suze.
- That's not true.

497
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:33,392
- Why are you trying to control everyone?
- I'm not. I'm not.

498
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:35,191
- Whatever. You're boring me.
- Leave it out.

499
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:37,355
Why are you all attacking me? It's not fair.

500
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:41,233
- No-one's attacking you, Helen.
- They're not attacking you, Hel.

501
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,358
- Blimey.
<i>- It's pathetic.</i>

502
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,959
- Suzy!
- Sorry.

503
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:49,194
<i>- She'll be all right in a minute.</i>
- Yeah.

504
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,592
It's hormones.

505
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,349
- You all right?
- Yeah.

506
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:04,152
- Do you want to play a game, Jamie?
- Yeah, yeah.

507
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,797
No, best leave it till the morning.

508
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:09,512
I think we should all go to bed, it's getting late.

509
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,708
All right, then.

510
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:13,398
Jamie, go upstairs
and get the bedding for Suzy.

511
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:17,037
- You're looking tired, Suzy.
<i>- She always looks like that.</i>

512
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,797
It's just my face.

513
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,636
Thanks for the barbecue, Helen. Jamie.

514
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,795
<i>- Anytime.</i>
- It was gorgeous.

515
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,749
Thanks.

516
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,552
<i>We'll go for a walk by the sea tomorrow.</i>
<i>It'll be lovely.</i>

517
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,952
<i>Be nice.</i>

518
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:35,230
SUZY: Move your arse.

519
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,470
Flap, flap, flap!

520
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:47,108
Careful, Poppy.
I'm worried about you in those shoes.

521
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,071
- Don't worry. They're not too high.
- Poppy, come off the wall.

522
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,030
Give us a piggy back?

523
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,234
Suzy, don't do that. Don't. Stop it.

524
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:15,591
You should have told me,
I wouldn't have got on your back.

525
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:29,193
I'm all right. How are you? Good weekend?

526
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,909
Oh, heavy night last night, was it?

527
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:36,594
That's what I like to hear. Good boy.

528
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,708
<i>So, do you fancy going out sometime, then?</i>

529
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:44,354
How's Friday looking for you?
Think you can squeeze me in?

530
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:49,994
Oh, go on, then. I don't drink.

531
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:52,591
But...

532
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,550
Yeah, maybe just the one.

533
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,475
Yeah, something like that.

534
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,277
All right, then.
See you then, then, then, then, then.

535
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:08,989
All right. See you, sailor. Bye.

536
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:33,155
Scott!

537
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,715
Suzy, wind your sister's window up.

538
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:23,637
What was that all about, then?

539
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,590
Search me.

540
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,391
Bit weird.

541
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:29,350
Isn't it just?

542
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,547
- Gives me the creeps, to be honest.
- Yeah.

543
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,517
So, what are we doing for tea, then?

544
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:41,629
- Takeaway. What do you reckon?
SUZY: Chinese?

545
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,670
Oh, hello, look who's here. Little piglet.

546
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,913
- Are you paying?
- No.

547
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,348
- Course she's not.
- Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

548
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,117
- Mum and Dad.
- Which one am I?

549
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,514
- Dad, of course.
- I hate being Dad.

550
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:54,198
- You love it.
- Oh, get off, Poppy.

551
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,831
It's a beautiful sky.

552
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:20,798
There you go.

553
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:22,557
Thanks.

554
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:28,349
So where were we?

555
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:31,391
What brings you here?

556
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:33,669
- I met a girl.
- Oh, very nice.

557
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:35,391
- Yeah.
- What's she like, then?

558
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:36,952
- I can't talk about it.
- Why not?

559
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:39,035
- It's a secret.
- I'm good with secrets.

560
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:42,230
- It's between me and her, though.
- Oh, fair enough. I won't pry.

561
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:44,395
- Who is she?
- I couldn't possibly.

562
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,797
Trust me.

563
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,433
She's a teacher.

564
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:52,875
- Is she?
- She's gorgeous.

565
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:55,717
Oh... I hate her already.

566
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:59,077
Haven't you got lovely eyes?

567
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,750
- Thanks.
- Beautiful colour.

568
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:04,073
- Really?
- Yeah.

569
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,472
Picked them myself.

570
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:07,111
- Did you?
- Yeah.

571
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,672
- Where from?
- Down the market.

572
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,630
- You're joking me?
- No.

573
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,874
I'd say you got yourself a bargain there.

574
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:16,355
- You've got one as well.
- Have I? Just the one? Which one?

575
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:17,673
- That one.
- This one?

576
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,596
- Particularly lovely, is he?
- He is.

577
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,152
But don't upset the other one.

578
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,552
- No, she's all right.
- Is she?

579
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,510
- Yeah, we've had a chat about it.
- Oh, good.

580
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,074
Yeah, she's over the worst now.
Yeah, anyway she's got other talents.

581
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,188
- Has she?
- Yeah.

582
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,230
- What are they?
- So many.

583
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:33,031
- She can juggle.
- Obviously.

584
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:36,151
Yeah, goes without saying.
She can wink on demand.

585
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,757
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

586
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,510
- Let's see.
- Are you sure?

587
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,629
- Yeah.
- It's pretty spooky.

588
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,954
- Go on.
- OK, are you ready?

589
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:46,910
Yeah.

590
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,677
She is good!

591
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:52,107
- This one tries to join in.
- Don't let him.

592
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,877
I won't. Anyway, he's lovely, so...

593
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:57,116
- Well, she's lovely, too.
- Don't try and claw your way out of it.

594
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,990
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

595
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,677
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

596
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,754
Again.

597
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,391
This is nice.

598
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,350
It is nice.

599
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:48,710
Here we are.

600
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,157
Wow.

601
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:56,269
Welcome to my humble abode.

602
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:58,037
Thank you.

603
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:23,157
(Poppy giggles)

604
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,795
- Aren't you high up?
- Yeah.

605
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,309
Yeah. What's it like up there?

606
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,270
Hm. It's OK.

607
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:36,110
That's better.

608
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:50,198
- I think you must be too hot.
- Yeah, it does feel hot.

609
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:52,070
Yeah, I thought so.

610
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:54,030
Usually right.

611
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,792
- Though it's not really my job.
- No, you're very good at it.

612
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,034
I know. (Giggles)

613
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,195
Hidden talents.

614
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,550
Oh, wow.

615
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,473
Now, that's what I call a bargain.

616
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,635
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

617
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:20,474
(Bangles jangle)
- One, two, three.

618
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:21,838
(Poppy giggles)

619
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:23,312
- I'm a bit hot, too.
- Yeah?

620
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,314
Yeah.

621
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,431
- Maybe this'll help.
- I think you might be right.

622
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:31,108
- What about if this...
- Oh, yeah, and that one. Go on, then.

623
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,069
OK.

624
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,917
- Ooh, I quite like it like that.
- (Chuckles)

625
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:38,068
- Oh!
- Lovely.

626
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:40,070
(Both laugh)

627
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:42,474
- What's it like in there?
- Oh, not bad.

628
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,950
I'll go and make that tea.

629
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:33,717
Great.

630
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:59,594
Going to be late for my lesson.
Hey-ho. There you go.

631
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:01,675
- I'll give you a lift.
- Will you?

632
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:02,754
- Yeah.
- Oh!

633
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:05,558
- Means I keep you for longer.
- Thank you very much.

634
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,510
It's OK.

635
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:11,831
- So when you coming back to school?
- Oh. Next week.

636
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:15,633
- I'll see how things go with his mum.
- Yeah, he'll be all right.

637
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,590
He'll be fine.

638
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,837
Hello.

639
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:27,914
Hi.

640
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:44,229
Are you happy... in your life?

641
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:48,553
That's a big question.

642
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:52,032
Isn't it just?

643
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:19,911
- So, you play football, then?
- Yeah, five-a-side every week.

644
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:22,268
- Right. Is that indoors or outdoors?
- No, outdoors.

645
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,230
- Oh, here she is.
- Made it. Just.

646
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:28,397
- Why aren't you wearing any jewellery?
- Oh, it's that kind of day.

647
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,111
So, you doing anything tonight?

648
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:33,389
Yeah, it's a mate's 30th.
We're all meeting in a bar.

649
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:35,191
- Great.
- What are you two up to?

650
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:37,116
- Oh, cinema.
<i>- Yeah, see a film.</i>

651
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:39,229
<i>- Popcorn...</i>
- Sit in the dark, hold hands.

652
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:40,553
Yeah, no necking.

653
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,510
She's only saying that cos you're here.

654
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,231
Normally I'm all over her like a rash.

655
00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:46,509
- I don't blame you.
- He's a right smoothie.

656
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:48,231
- Isn't he just?
- (Doorbell)

657
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:49,837
- Here he is.
- Nice to meet you.

658
00:42:49,879 --> 00:42:51,676
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Zoe.

659
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:53,835
- Yeah, whatever.
<i>- Have a good time tonight.</i>

660
00:42:53,879 --> 00:42:55,312
(Poppy laughs)

661
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,270
POPPY: <i>Come on, you.</i>

662
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:02,669
Hiya, Scott. This is Tim.
He's coming with us today.

663
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:04,596
- Just joking.
- Hi.

664
00:43:06,399 --> 00:43:08,913
- Ooh, can't win them all.
- Apparently not.

665
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:10,472
- See you later.
- I'll call you.

666
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:11,747
- Will you?
- Yeah.

667
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:12,914
Good.

668
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:30,436
What happened on Sunday, Scott?
You should've stopped to say hello.

669
00:43:30,479 --> 00:43:33,437
I don't know what you're talking about.
I was in Stevenage on Sunday.

670
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:35,754
Stevenage? Funny, you must have a twin.

671
00:43:35,799 --> 00:43:38,518
I was there all day. I was looking after
my mum. My aunt's dying.

672
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,027
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It's all right.

673
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:45,038
- Don't believe you, Scott.
- It's up to you, I was there till midnight.

674
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:46,990
Don't think so, gigolo.

675
00:43:49,399 --> 00:43:51,310
(Engine starts)

676
00:44:04,759 --> 00:44:07,398
<i>Concentrate, Poppy.</i>
<i>Concentrate. Watch what I'm doing.</i>

677
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:11,148
Now I'm going to indicate. I keep in lane.
In a roundabout, you keep in lane.

678
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:13,235
OK? You keep in lane, all right?

679
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:18,194
<i>You take responsibility for other drivers</i>
<i>and for yourself and you keep in lane, OK?</i>

680
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,037
This is a roundabout. Concentrate,
pay attention. Good. Thank you.

681
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:23,513
Are you... Was that a request
or was that a demand?

682
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:25,993
Did he bully me then? Did he just shove in then?

683
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,552
<i>- Or did he ask?</i>
- Did he?

684
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,033
No, he didn't ask.
You see what roundabouts do?

685
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,958
Roundabouts, if you keep in lane
and you keep going, you'll be fine.

686
00:44:33,999 --> 00:44:36,797
You're following rules and keeping
everything the way it should be.

687
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:38,033
<i>Everything in check.</i>

688
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,276
<i>But if you get selfish and if you</i>
<i>step out of it, then it goes wrong.</i>

689
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:43,753
And it gets dangerous.
Do you see what I mean?

690
00:44:47,879 --> 00:44:50,632
- Waa-aaah...
- (Car horn blares)

691
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:53,671
I'm not waiting for somebody
who can't keep in lane on a roundabout.

692
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:55,118
I'm not waiting.

693
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,115
<i>Everywhere you see, look at the cameras.</i>

694
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:59,434
Everywhere you go, they're watching you.

695
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:01,993
They're seeing you. They're watching.
Everywhere you go.

696
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:05,270
Look at this place, it stinks.
Come on. What are you waiting for?

697
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:08,789
- All right.
<i>- Jesus Christ! Look, another camera...</i>

698
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,636
Speed camera. Why do you need them?

699
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:13,034
There's two guys at the back of the road
selling drugs

700
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:16,071
<i>and you have a speed camera.</i>
<i>Why do you need a speed camera?</i>

701
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:17,552
You can wait.

702
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:18,952
- You can wait!
- Easy.

703
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:20,273
(Car horn)

704
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:25,435
<i>Come on! Drive the car.</i>

705
00:45:25,479 --> 00:45:28,835
You're not driving a camel.
OK? This is not a bazaar.

706
00:45:28,879 --> 00:45:31,837
We have rules in this country.
We have regulations. Keep to them.

707
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:37,230
Fucking morons!

708
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:42,110
(Tyres screech)

709
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:59,917
Check your mirrors, your seat,
make yourself comfortable.

710
00:45:59,959 --> 00:46:01,631
- No, I don't think so.
- Seat belt on.

711
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:03,590
- I'm not going anywhere.
- What do you mean?

712
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:05,436
You are in no fit state to take this lesson.

713
00:46:05,479 --> 00:46:07,595
I am the instructor. You are the pupil.

714
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,197
- You need to calm down.
- I am calm.

715
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:11,912
- You can't drive like this.
- You can't comment on my driving!

716
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:15,634
I think I can when you're putting yourself
in danger, putting me in danger,

717
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:18,239
- and putting other people in danger.
- It's them.

718
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:21,191
That's bullshit. It's all bullshit.
That's it, I don't want it.

719
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:23,116
- You want this lesson to stop?
- Yes, I do.

720
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:25,673
I don't want you to teach me any more. I'm sorry.

721
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:28,791
OK. Fantastic. Get in the passenger seat
and I'll drive you home.

722
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:30,591
No, I don't think so. I'm driving.

723
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:31,833
- No, you're not.
- I am.

724
00:46:31,879 --> 00:46:33,995
Poppy, if this isn't a lesson, you can't drive.

725
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:35,438
You're not driving anywhere.

726
00:46:35,479 --> 00:46:37,947
You got two choices,
either I drive you home or you walk.

727
00:46:37,999 --> 00:46:40,229
I don't mind walking, but you can't drive this car.

728
00:46:40,279 --> 00:46:43,271
- You can't stop me.
- Yes, I can.

729
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:46,270
- Poppy, give me the keys.
- No.

730
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,753
- Give me the keys to my car.
- No, I don't think so.

731
00:46:48,799 --> 00:46:51,916
I'm going to ask you one more time.
Please give me the keys to my car.

732
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:54,427
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Give me the fucking keys to my car,

733
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:55,912
- you fucking bitch!
- Get off me!

734
00:46:55,959 --> 00:47:00,111
- Give me the... fuck...
- Get off me. Get off me!

735
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:02,798
- Give me the fucking...
- Get off me. You get away from me!

736
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:06,149
- Give me the fucking keys!
- You can't touch me, Scott.

737
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:09,157
- Give me the fucking keys!
- You can't touch me. You're out of order.

738
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:12,077
- Give me those fucking keys!
- You're out of order.

739
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:13,711
- You're out of order.
- Give me the...

740
00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:16,831
I'm calling the police.
Do you want me to call the police?

741
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:19,473
Do you?

742
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:26,228
Right. So let's just calm down, shall we?

743
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:32,070
OK, we're disturbing the peace here.

744
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,272
I just want to get in my car and drive away.

745
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:41,037
- That's not going to happen.
<i>- Jesus!</i>

746
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:44,788
You're doing it again. You never give in
for fuck's sake, you fucking bitch!

747
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:46,477
- You need help.
- Don't patronise me.

748
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:49,955
- I'm not patronising you.
- Yes, you are <i>always</i> patronising me.

749
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:52,991
<i>This is what you always wanted,</i>
<i>what you set out to achieve.</i>

750
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:54,438
<i>This is the game you play.</i>

751
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,634
You prodded me. You poked me.
You stroked me. You teased me.

752
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:00,670
You flirted with me. You sucked me in.

753
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:04,075
<i>You wore your high-heel boots,</i>
<i>your short skirt, your low-cut top</i>

754
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:06,269
and you flashed your tits, you tossed your hair.

755
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,152
You played with the gear stick. You lied to me!

756
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:13,317
<i>This is all about you.</i>
<i>The world has to revolve around you.</i>

757
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:18,674
I'm a driving instructor.
I just wanted to do my job.

758
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:22,712
You had no intention of learning how to drive.
You had one thing in mind.

759
00:48:22,759 --> 00:48:26,798
To reel me in. And why?
Because you have to be adored.

760
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:29,672
<i>You've got to be wanted. And you drink it in.</i>

761
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:32,358
<i>And you leave me with a spring in your step</i>

762
00:48:32,399 --> 00:48:35,755
and you go off and you fuck your boyfriend
and you fuck your girlfriend.

763
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:39,508
And you all drive around
in that stupid, little yellow car.

764
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:50,230
Scott...

765
00:48:57,959 --> 00:48:59,950
Come on, now.

766
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,988
I just want to go home.

767
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:14,273
<i>I'm sure you do.</i>

768
00:49:15,479 --> 00:49:17,390
Don't we all, eh?

769
00:49:23,759 --> 00:49:25,272
Tell you what.

770
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:29,628
Why don't we have a talk about it?

771
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,675
We'll sit in the car.

772
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:40,435
We'll have a chat, OK?

773
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:44,510
All right?

774
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:49,514
And then I'll give you your keys.

775
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:21,514
I'm sorry if I upset you, Scott.

776
00:50:27,479 --> 00:50:29,390
I wish I could make you happy.

777
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:33,470
I <i>was</i> happy.

778
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,312
OK.

779
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:42,195
And I was in Stevenage last Sunday.

780
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:46,948
- Sure.
<i>- You can ask my mum.</i>

781
00:50:54,279 --> 00:50:56,429
So, same time next week?

782
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:14,156
I'm sorry, Scott.

783
00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:22,357
There you go.

784
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:27,271
I'll just get my bag, all right?

785
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:36,351
I'm a good driving instructor.

786
00:51:39,479 --> 00:51:41,788
Yeah, I know you are.

787
00:51:51,479 --> 00:51:52,798
Take care, Scott.

788
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:56,556
Was that your boyfriend?

789
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,436
Before?

790
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,277
Was it?

791
00:52:20,999 --> 00:52:22,352
(Starts engine)

792
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:45,869
I think I should give up smoking.

793
00:54:45,919 --> 00:54:48,387
That's a good idea.

794
00:54:48,439 --> 00:54:50,350
What can I give up?

795
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:53,394
You could give up being too nice.

796
00:54:54,679 --> 00:54:57,034
Seriously, you can't make everyone happy.

797
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:00,913
There's no harm in trying, though, is there?
Bring a smile to the world.

798
00:55:01,879 --> 00:55:04,347
- Come on, Poppy.
- I know. I know.

799
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,949
I still think we should call the police.

800
00:55:07,999 --> 00:55:10,035
No, that's not going to help him, is it?

801
00:55:10,879 --> 00:55:12,437
I don't know.

802
00:55:12,999 --> 00:55:15,115
- You know what?
- What?

803
00:55:15,159 --> 00:55:17,468
- We're lucky, aren't we?
- Yeah, we are.

804
00:55:18,759 --> 00:55:21,478
Well... well, you make your own luck in life,
don't you?

805
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:24,511
Well, some of us do.
Some of us miss the boat completely.

806
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,709
It's hard work being a grown-up, isn't it?

807
00:55:26,759 --> 00:55:29,557
Yeah, it is. It's a long trip.

808
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,510
Yeah, tell me when we get there.

809
00:55:32,439 --> 00:55:34,714
Don't worry, I'll let you know.

810
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:40,514
You keep on rowing and I'll keep on smiling.

811
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,470
Hm. Are we there yet?

812
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:47,110
We've got a hell of a way to go.

813
00:55:54,959 --> 00:55:57,917
POPPY: We're getting good at this, aren't we?
Nothing to it.

814
00:56:01,439 --> 00:56:03,350
(Mobile rings)

815
00:56:09,759 --> 00:56:13,388
POPPY: Hello, you. Missing me already?

816
00:56:13,479 --> 00:56:15,515
Oh...

817
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:17,515
That's nice to hear.

818
00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:21,230
A nightmare. Yeah.

819
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:24,269
I'm still alive... just.

820
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:28,107
Well... it's a long story.

821
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:30,514
I'm on the lake, with Zoe.

822
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,868
(Laughs) Yeah.

823
00:56:32,919 --> 00:56:35,114
The bathroom flooded, yeah.

824
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:37,354
It's all right now. We've found a boat.

825
00:56:37,399 --> 00:56:40,789
(Laughs) You're funny.

826
00:56:45,879 --> 00:56:48,154
No. (Laughs)

827
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:53,590
(Poppy continues laughing)
