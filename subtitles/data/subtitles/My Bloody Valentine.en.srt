1
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:05,941
No.

2
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:33,059
Hey! Where's Howard and
the rest of the apprentices?

3
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:36,197
Left at the bottom to find their own
way up. You gotta learn sometime.

4
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:39,365
You wanna be a troubleshooter,
you gotta know the mine.

5
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:40,449
All clear down there?

6
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:42,246
Yeah, we won't
need these anymore...

7
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:44,168
but I wouldn't go
lightin' any matches.

8
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:51,110
Damn methane. Gonna blow this place
to shit one of these days.

9
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:52,671
We ain't that lucky.

10
00:03:57,513 --> 00:03:59,716
Hey, come on, now!
Knock it off!

11
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:12,512
- Howard!
- Hey, Howard!

12
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:14,753
Hey, enjoy your walk up?

13
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,927
Yeah, real cool.
Why didn't you guys wait?

14
00:04:16,998 --> 00:04:18,907
Look, Landers, you better
get a lot of exercise...

15
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:20,869
if you're gonna grapple
with Gretchen.

16
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:24,031
Oh, yeah? I got a valentine for her
that she's never gonna forget.

17
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:25,791
Right to the heart, huh?

18
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,932
It's gonna be a hot time
on Saturday night!

19
00:04:29,956 --> 00:04:31,646
Stavisky, you do anything else
with that...

20
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:33,571
except throw it
over your shoulder and burp it?

21
00:04:33,636 --> 00:04:35,163
Aw, get lost, Axel!

22
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,259
Bunch of clowns. Things haven't
changed a bit. Same as always.

23
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:41,305
Bet you wish
you never came back.

24
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:43,964
Especially now since Sarah's
goin' out with Axel.

25
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:48,924
No skin off my nose.
I don't give a damn.

26
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:54,072
Come on. Last one into town
gets the brew! Let's go!

27
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:56,250
Okay. Let's go, guys!

28
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:13,168
Quittin' time!
Casanova is here!

29
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,875
- Gretchen, it's me.
- Howard, stay away from me.

30
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:19,633
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, sweetheart.

31
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:21,611
- How are ya?
- I'm fine.

32
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:23,573
- How are you?
- Good to see ya.

33
00:06:25,078 --> 00:06:26,703
Hi, sweetie.

34
00:06:29,717 --> 00:06:32,018
You big lug.
I missed ya.

35
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,463
- Anything I should do?
- No. Of course not.

36
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:43,182
Gretchen, I want you to be my date
for the dance. Okay?

37
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:44,396
Dry up!

38
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:46,605
Gretchen, you know what'd
look really good on you?

39
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,168
- What?
- Me.

40
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,933
Suck it in
and zip it up, will ya?

41
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:52,041
Gretchen, why fight it?

42
00:06:54,162 --> 00:06:55,787
Let the good times roll!

43
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:57,101
All right!

44
00:06:58,033 --> 00:06:59,462
Hi, fellas.

45
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:03,148
Mabel, this is the best thing that's
happened to this town in years.

46
00:07:03,217 --> 00:07:05,355
Your decorating committee
has done one hell of a job!

47
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,588
Well, after all, the first
Valentine's dance in 20 years...

48
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:10,444
has to be something special.

49
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:12,932
Yeah, well--
Of course, you're right, Mabel...

50
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:15,822
but we'd all be better off
if you played down the fact...

51
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:18,407
that it's the first
Valentine's dance in 20 years...

52
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,333
if you know what I mean.

53
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:31,046
Let's just concentrate on having
a good time Saturday night...

54
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:33,385
and put all that
other business to rest.

55
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,362
My thoughts exactly, Mayor.

56
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,942
- Hi, guy.
- Aw, come on, you clown!

57
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:46,982
Help Miss Osborne
pick those things up!

58
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,003
What the hell are you kids
doing in here?

59
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:54,856
You're supposed to be decorating
the room, not each other.

60
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:59,080
Where you goin', son?

61
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,055
I always go this time of day...

62
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:03,233
for another beer
and a real good nose pick.

63
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:07,239
I'm sorry, T.J.

64
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:13,664
I don't think he likes being back
in the mine very much.

65
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:16,517
Well, that's too bad. Nobody told
him to go out to the West Coast.

66
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,004
It's not my fault
he couldn't make it on his own.

67
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,275
But now that he's back, he's my son
and he's working in the mine.

68
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:28,260
Put those things back...

69
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:30,332
or I'll turn you both
upside down, especially you.

70
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:31,518
This is my date, Chief.

71
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:35,708
That meeting in Centerville is
at 7:00. We should hit the road.

72
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,169
Then let's go.
I'll see you kids later.

73
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:40,579
Bye, Mabel.
Keep up the good work.

74
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:41,592
See ya, Chief.

75
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:45,661
I might as well go too. All of this
will have to be rewashed.

76
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:47,641
I'm really sorry, Mabel.

77
00:08:51,683 --> 00:08:54,650
<i>This is station QPID,
940 on your radio dial.</i>

78
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:56,577
<i>- Oh! Mayor!
- Country-fried QPID...</i>

79
00:08:56,642 --> 00:08:58,846
<i>from Valentine Bluffs, where the
heartland meets the sea.</i>

80
00:08:58,914 --> 00:08:59,961
Mayor?

81
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:03,392
Mayor, somebody left this for ya.

82
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:06,686
- For me? Who was it?
- I don't know.

83
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:09,850
It was inside when we got here.
Maybe you got a secret admirer, huh?

84
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:13,887
- You in on this, Mabel?
- I'm afraid not, Mayor.

85
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:18,649
Oh, no. No, no.

86
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:21,850
Don't look at me. I didn't
have a thing to do with it.

87
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:25,591
Well, hell.
I've been looking for an excuse...

88
00:09:25,662 --> 00:09:28,728
to get off this miserable diet
Mrs. Hanniger has me on.

89
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:30,074
Thanks, Howard.

90
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:33,434
If there's one thing I like
better than Christmas candy...

91
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:35,356
it's Valentine's candy.

92
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:38,388
- Have some.
- Hey.

93
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:39,922
Who sent it?

94
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,089
"From the heart
comes a warning...

95
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:45,269
filled with bloody good cheer.

96
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,347
Remember what happened...

97
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:50,004
as the 14th draws near."

98
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:54,458
It can't be happening again.

99
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,247
It can't be happening again.

100
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:59,281
It can't be happening again.

101
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:31,060
It's a bad time,
this time of year.

102
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:35,820
There's bad things coming,
my words you hear.

103
00:10:37,397 --> 00:10:41,422
Beware of the 14th
if you value your life.

104
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:44,874
Here we go again. How many times
is he gonna tell that story?

105
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:47,762
Oh, let him tell it.
I love fairy tales.

106
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:49,834
This ain't no fairy tale,
little girl!

107
00:10:50,771 --> 00:10:53,618
If you don't take it seriously,
you're a fool!

108
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:55,695
Ow!

109
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:57,776
Hurt yourself?

110
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:02,087
Axel, are you okay?
Oh, no! Let me see.

111
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:12,720
I know what I'm talking about.
I'm telling you now.

112
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:14,671
This town is accursed.

113
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,570
It all started 20 years ago.

114
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,777
<i>It was the night
of the Valentine's Day dance...</i>

115
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,887
<i>at the Union Hall.</i>

116
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,781
<i>The biggest event of the year.</i>

117
00:11:25,743 --> 00:11:28,230
<i>It'd been a tradition
for over a hundred years.</i>

118
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:31,749
<i>Everybody was there,
except for...</i>

119
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:34,374
<i>seven miners who were out
at the Hanniger Mine.</i>

120
00:11:35,405 --> 00:11:37,641
<i>Five of them
still down below.</i>

121
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,450
<i>Two supervisors were waiting
for the men to come up.</i>

122
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:43,689
<i>Anxious to get to the party...</i>

123
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:46,658
<i>they left before the men
were safely out...</i>

124
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:50,080
<i>failing to check the methane gas
levels in the tunnels down below.</i>

125
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,258
<i>The five men were buried alive...</i>

126
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,631
<i>as the town
continued its party.</i>

127
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:08,008
<i>For six weeks we dug 'round
the clock to try to save them.</i>

128
00:12:09,225 --> 00:12:13,119
<i>After we broke through,
one man was found alive.</i>

129
00:12:15,656 --> 00:12:17,598
<i>I was the one
who found him.</i>

130
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:26,912
<i>Harry Warden spent the next year
in the state mental hospital.</i>

131
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:30,178
<i>Exactly one year later,
on Valentine's Day...</i>

132
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,477
<i>he came back to town.</i>

133
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:35,167
<i>He killed the two supervisors...</i>

134
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:37,277
<i>who had left their posts
the year before.</i>

135
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:41,086
<i>Then he cut out their hearts...</i>

136
00:12:41,157 --> 00:12:43,840
<i>and stuffed them
into heart-shaped candy boxes.</i>

137
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,779
<i>That night at the dance,
we found the boxes...</i>

138
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:49,752
<i>blood dripping out the sides.</i>

139
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:54,843
<i>Inside was a note--
a warning from Harry...</i>

140
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:59,966
<i>never to hold a Valentine's dance
ever again.</i>

141
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:04,568
<i>Every February 14th,
Harry comes back to town...</i>

142
00:13:05,857 --> 00:13:08,475
<i>his pickax stained with blood...</i>

143
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:12,096
<i>waiting in the shadows
of the Hanniger Mine...</i>

144
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,454
<i>just for someone to kill...</i>

145
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,430
<i>should they not heed his warning.</i>

146
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,807
It could be you!

147
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,323
I know what I'm sayin'.

148
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:26,293
Forget about having a party at all
on Saturday night...

149
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:28,221
or you may not live
to see daylight.

150
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,077
Laugh now...

151
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:36,883
but you'll be sorry
you didn't listen to me.

152
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:39,098
Uh-oh!

153
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:42,874
Come on, Hap!
Lighten up!

154
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:44,370
It's a stupid legend.

155
00:13:44,444 --> 00:13:46,386
It gives me the creeps.

156
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,598
All right, you guys.
Who ordered the Moosehead?

157
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:51,418
I did, you gorgeous slab
of female fleshiness.

158
00:13:58,203 --> 00:14:01,366
<i>There is a young barmaid
named Harriet</i>

159
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:05,078
<i>Who's never been robbed
of her cherry yet</i>

160
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:07,567
<i>Oh, try as she may</i>

161
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:12,213
<i>This girl can't get laid</i>

162
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:14,484
<i>A Valentine virgin
named Harriet</i>

163
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,363
Why did you hit me
in the ribs like that?

164
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:29,043
- Hey, where ya goin'?
- I just want to put on some music.

165
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,372
Be my guest.

166
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:34,197
Excuse me.

167
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:47,217
It's your own fault.
You know that, don't you, T.J.?

168
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:48,691
Never said it wasn't.

169
00:14:50,548 --> 00:14:53,363
Then why can't you
accept things the way they are?

170
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:56,235
Thing is, I don't like
the way things are.

171
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:00,304
Excuse me.

172
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:16,783
Yes. All right.

173
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:19,206
Thank you very much.

174
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:22,287
I have to call in the morning.

175
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:24,359
The administration office
is closed at night.

176
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:27,144
The nurse that's on duty
doesn't know a thing.

177
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:29,320
She's got to know
whether he's there or not!

178
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:33,034
I just hope this is
some kind of joke, and the kids...

179
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:34,858
are just trying to scare us.

180
00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:38,155
If it is a joke, I want every one
of those kids strung up...

181
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:41,091
starting with
that damn Howard Landers!

182
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,100
Well, it's a human heart, all right.
Ayoung woman.

183
00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:45,929
About 30 years old.

184
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:48,298
What are you guys doin'
with a loose heart?

185
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,437
Looks like a butcher
ripped this thing out.

186
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:54,120
What's goin' on
over in Valentine Bluffs?

187
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:56,522
You remember Harry Warden?

188
00:15:56,587 --> 00:16:00,383
Oh, God, of course I remember.
Those were terrible murders.

189
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:05,793
God. I thought they locked him up
in Eastfield 20 years ago.

190
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:08,768
- They did.
- Are you sure he's still there?

191
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,944
We'll find out in the morning.
I'm checking on it.

192
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:15,075
Well, gentlemen, I'd say
you have your answer.

193
00:16:15,913 --> 00:16:18,695
It looks like Harry Warden's
back in town.

194
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:05,746
Well, now.
I wonder who sent this.

195
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:08,215
Jake?

196
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,608
"Roses are red,
violets are blue...

197
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:24,855
One is dead,
and so are you"?

198
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:30,646
No!

199
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:31,890
No! Get away!

200
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,814
Get away!

201
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,083
No, don't!

202
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,525
Get away! No! No!

203
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,251
No!

204
00:18:57,749 --> 00:18:59,952
This is gettin' really good.

205
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,875
Don't put your nose in it.

206
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,064
Hey, this is what I really call
"junk food."

207
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:08,368
How much longer, Hollis?
I'm freezin'.

208
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:10,290
Relax. This thing
ain't no microwave.

209
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:12,209
How 'bout rewin' it up?

210
00:19:13,074 --> 00:19:14,929
- Man, have I got the munchies.
- Yeah, me too.

211
00:19:14,994 --> 00:19:16,849
A little protein patrol, eh, boys?

212
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:19,663
- Don't go pokin' my meat.
- Oh, come on.

213
00:19:19,729 --> 00:19:21,354
Probably cooked.

214
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:25,962
- Don't stick your nose in the food.
- It's his. He can do what he wants.

215
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:28,269
Is that turkey?
I asked for roast beef.

216
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:30,224
Turkey for the turkey.

217
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,128
Here.

218
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:07,295
Come on.
Shove over.

219
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,750
- Sure is cold tonight.
- Yeah.

220
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,594
I guess we got ourselves
a problem, huh?

221
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:51,043
Yeah.

222
00:20:52,228 --> 00:20:54,083
Yeah, I guess so.

223
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:57,283
What are we gonna do about it?

224
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:01,659
Well, there ain't nothin'
to do about it.

225
00:21:02,691 --> 00:21:04,546
Sarah's goin' with me now...

226
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:06,465
and that's all there is to it.

227
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:09,659
I ain't gonna back off
for you, T.J.

228
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,640
Nobody asked you
to go away, T.J.

229
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:14,464
Come on, Axel. Don't give me
any of that horseshit.

230
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,384
You're beginning to sound
like my old man.

231
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,937
Too bad, man.
Look, you left.

232
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:21,376
You went away, and we didn't
know where you were...

233
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:23,350
or when you were comin' back.

234
00:21:24,512 --> 00:21:28,734
I ain't gonna back off for you.
You stay the hell away from Sarah!

235
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,766
All right, all right!
You want a fight, then you got it!

236
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:34,327
'Cause you and I
both know who Sarah wants.

237
00:21:59,996 --> 00:22:03,770
You're kinda hard on him, Teej.
Can't exactly blame him.

238
00:22:03,835 --> 00:22:05,940
Sure it's not his fault.
It's nobody's fault.

239
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:08,564
I don't know what to do.

240
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:10,577
You know, I really do like
that son of a bitch.

241
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,651
Hey, remember?

242
00:22:13,722 --> 00:22:15,762
Remember how we used to
tear this place apart?

243
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,688
Eh? Get drunk,
race out to the bluffs.

244
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,115
That was great.

245
00:22:23,161 --> 00:22:25,015
I guess things change, huh?

246
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,334
Nothin' stays the same.

247
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:39,606
W-A-R-D-E-N.

248
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:42,060
Harry Warden. He was
committed under court order...

249
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:43,989
approximately 20 years ago.

250
00:22:44,054 --> 00:22:47,469
Well, I'm afraid I have no records
of a Harry Warden, past or present.

251
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:48,786
<i>How can that be?</i>

252
00:22:48,854 --> 00:22:51,887
He was committed there,
under court order!

253
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:54,444
I'm sorry. I have
no records on him.

254
00:22:54,517 --> 00:22:57,234
In 20 years, any number of things
could have happened.

255
00:22:57,301 --> 00:23:00,464
Now, if this Harry Warden
was committed, as you say...

256
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:02,474
then he's simply
no longer here...

257
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,653
and if I have no records on him,
I have to assume...

258
00:23:04,724 --> 00:23:07,538
that he's transferred,
he's released, or he's on the slab.

259
00:23:07,604 --> 00:23:09,458
One of three,
take your pick.

260
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:11,760
One out of three?

261
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:13,681
Now, look,
Mrs. Raleigh...

262
00:23:13,746 --> 00:23:16,080
you're gonna have to do
a little bit better than that.

263
00:23:16,147 --> 00:23:18,535
Now, I have to know
what happened to this man...

264
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,682
and I have to know
what happened to him now!

265
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:22,313
<i>Now, have you
checked everything?</i>

266
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:25,800
Everything, except the microfilms
over in central file...

267
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:28,011
and it will take
several days to check that.

268
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,593
I need answers fast.
I'll be waiting for your call.

269
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,247
<i>Dr. Peyton, 3-5-3.</i>

270
00:23:35,311 --> 00:23:38,759
Jumpin'Je-- They don't even know
what the hell happened to him.

271
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:41,679
What more do we need to know?
It's gotta be Harry.

272
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,217
Maybe we oughta
cancel the dance.

273
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,868
Just decide which one
you really want.

274
00:23:48,942 --> 00:23:50,370
And now for the big moment.

275
00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:52,934
Will it be number one
or will it be number two?

276
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:56,169
Patty, will you be serious?
This is important.

277
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:58,757
- You can't have 'em both.
- I don't want them both.

278
00:23:58,829 --> 00:24:00,684
- Oh, no?
- No.

279
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:04,971
Just what I thought.

280
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:07,850
Oh, I don't know.
T.J. won't talk to me.

281
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,671
He just sulks
all day long.

282
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,365
He ends up making me
feel guilty...

283
00:24:11,435 --> 00:24:13,922
when he's the one
who owes me the apology.

284
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,449
And Axel is not behaving
any better.

285
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:19,424
Oh, Patty, I don't even want to go
to the dance on Saturday night.

286
00:24:19,498 --> 00:24:21,353
Oh, but you gotta go.
It'll be all right.

287
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,233
Stay with Hollis and me. Besides,
you gotta see the dress I got.

288
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:28,356
Cut down to here, slit up to there.
I may not get out alive!

289
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:51,140
Mabel?

290
00:24:55,877 --> 00:24:58,626
Mabel, I gotta talk to you. We got
a problem concerning the dance.

291
00:25:12,195 --> 00:25:14,049
Mabel, you back here?

292
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:25,784
Okay. Little John, I want you
and Mike to check the wall.

293
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:30,226
T.J., take care of the sump.

294
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,775
You get a pump down there,
or I ain't doin' it.

295
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:36,303
You do it, or you get your ass
outta here for good.

296
00:26:36,376 --> 00:26:37,586
I'll do it.

297
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:41,936
I'll do it.

298
00:26:42,008 --> 00:26:43,863
What's buggin' him today?

299
00:26:43,928 --> 00:26:47,724
Son of a bitch is after my ass
'cause of Sarah.

300
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:51,279
- Keeps it up, I'm gonna nail him.
- I said move it, Hanniger!

301
00:26:54,838 --> 00:26:57,456
Oh, yeah.
Come on, man.

302
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:03,627
Anytime, loser.

303
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:05,675
Hey, that's it!
Break it up, you two!

304
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,498
T.J., you get your ass
up top to 217!

305
00:27:08,564 --> 00:27:09,513
Let go!

306
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:15,499
There ain't gonna be no fighting
in my section, Palmer! Understand?

307
00:27:31,537 --> 00:27:33,392
What an awful smell.

308
00:27:38,897 --> 00:27:41,263
This is like it was
20 years ago.

309
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:44,775
I can remember those murders
just like it was yesterday.

310
00:27:44,848 --> 00:27:46,702
Jake, you gotta
get help from Granville.

311
00:27:46,768 --> 00:27:48,360
No, not yet.

312
00:27:48,431 --> 00:27:50,668
Call in Granville, we'll have police
crawling all over this place...

313
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,906
and we'll have a hell of a panic
on our hands.

314
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:55,113
You just mention
that Harry's back...

315
00:27:55,182 --> 00:27:58,051
and this town won't be worth
the powder to blow it to hell.

316
00:27:59,854 --> 00:28:01,741
Just a minute, boys.

317
00:28:03,342 --> 00:28:06,123
I want you to bring
the ambulance around back.

318
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:09,701
Load her up from there. I don't
want anybody in town seeing this.

319
00:28:11,277 --> 00:28:16,327
You remember. Mabel Osborne died
of a heart attack, and that's all.

320
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,151
Breathe one word
of this to anybody...

321
00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:20,074
and you'll have to answer to me.

322
00:28:22,955 --> 00:28:24,897
Wait a minute.
What's this?

323
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,736
Take her away.

324
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:43,261
"It happened once,
it happened twice.

325
00:28:45,704 --> 00:28:47,711
Cancel the dance,
or it'll happen thrice."

326
00:28:49,287 --> 00:28:51,327
Well, that's it.

327
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:53,438
The dance is canceled.

328
00:28:53,511 --> 00:28:56,860
Let's tear every poster,
every banner, every decoration...

329
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,106
down and out of sight!

330
00:28:59,175 --> 00:29:02,305
I don't want to see a single
Valentine's heart anywhere.

331
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:05,373
As long as this town
is decorated to the hilt...

332
00:29:05,445 --> 00:29:07,779
Harry's gonna
keep on killing and--

333
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:10,398
And get that damn
Union Hall locked up!

334
00:29:10,469 --> 00:29:11,810
All right, Mayor.

335
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:14,980
No, I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do about it.

336
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,245
What's goin' on?

337
00:29:17,315 --> 00:29:21,276
The mayor has canceled the dance,
and that's all there is to it.

338
00:29:21,347 --> 00:29:25,056
In the light of Mabel's death,
he had no choice.

339
00:29:25,123 --> 00:29:28,384
There'll be no parties either.
We owe her that much respect.

340
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,338
Mabel would have wanted us
to have the dance.

341
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,889
- She worked so hard on it.
- Yeah, you can't cancel it now.

342
00:29:32,962 --> 00:29:35,034
He's looking for an excuse
to cancel the dance.

343
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:37,210
That's the way it is.

344
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:39,517
There'll be no dance
tomorrow night...

345
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:40,828
and no parties either.

346
00:29:40,897 --> 00:29:42,359
Do you understand me?

347
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:48,447
Hanniger!

348
00:29:50,528 --> 00:29:53,113
- We have something to settle.
- You bet we do.

349
00:29:58,815 --> 00:30:01,498
Howard, you gotta chew it.
You don't blow bubbles with it.

350
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,638
I'll take care of myself.

351
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,076
How did you ever get
to be so stupid?

352
00:30:10,653 --> 00:30:12,628
Come on.
Let's take a shower.

353
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:24,306
T.J., will you stop this?
I don't wanna go with you!

354
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:26,321
Are you listening to me?

355
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:28,788
Nope.

356
00:30:58,071 --> 00:30:59,958
Remember this spot?

357
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,203
Of course
I remember this spot.

358
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:27,662
Why didn't you write me, T.J.?
Why didn't you call?

359
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:32,558
I wanted to, believe me,
but I couldn't.

360
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,711
I mean, I really
fell on my ass out there.

361
00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:39,153
I made so many mistakes.

362
00:31:39,217 --> 00:31:41,159
But I learned something.

363
00:31:50,864 --> 00:31:53,581
Look. Give me a chance.

364
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:56,069
If you still want me
to go away, I will...

365
00:31:56,143 --> 00:31:58,892
but I have to tell you that
I love you and I want you back.

366
00:31:59,695 --> 00:32:03,043
How was I supposed
to know that,Jessie?

367
00:32:03,118 --> 00:32:05,933
I honestly didn't think
you were ever coming back.

368
00:32:07,214 --> 00:32:09,101
You just left me here.

369
00:32:10,926 --> 00:32:13,064
Sarah, please.

370
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:16,548
I'm sorry.
I'm so damn sorry.

371
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:32,193
<i>That's what I am</i>

372
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:37,281
<i>And, girl
I don't expect you to understand</i>

373
00:32:38,378 --> 00:32:41,094
<i>I just play my song</i>

374
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:43,070
<i>And right or wrong</i>

375
00:32:44,265 --> 00:32:47,429
<i>Now music's all I need
to get along</i>

376
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:52,770
<i>Women and wine
don't thrill me like they used to</i>

377
00:32:54,856 --> 00:32:57,310
<i>- And I don't feel--
- You seen Sarah?</i>

378
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:03,100
Ain't my turn
to watch after her.

379
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:31,357
Damn it, Sarah, why do you
do this to yourself?

380
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,401
How am I
gonna tell Axel?

381
00:33:47,553 --> 00:33:48,501
Sarah!

382
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:55,925
- Chief Newby.
- I'm sorry I startled you.

383
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,855
It's all right.

384
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,970
- Is something the matter?
- No, I'm--

385
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,006
I'm just making
my nightly patrol.

386
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:07,572
Right.

387
00:34:12,126 --> 00:34:14,995
- Good night, Chief.
- Good night, Sarah.

388
00:34:18,205 --> 00:34:20,660
<i>- Just a-diggin'in my mine
- Beer, Hap.</i>

389
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:24,376
<i>- I'll take my time makin'you mine
- You hear about Mabel Osborne?</i>

390
00:34:24,444 --> 00:34:27,673
<i>- I'm a part-time lover
- She got it just the way I said.</i>

391
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,035
<i>- Mmm, you're a full-time fool
- Heart attack, my ass!</i>

392
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:34,674
If we aren't gonna have
a Valentine's dance...

393
00:34:34,747 --> 00:34:36,023
what are we gonna do?

394
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,130
Why don't we have
a Valentine party?

395
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:39,413
A party!

396
00:34:41,178 --> 00:34:43,895
Where? Newby's got this whole town
locked up, bright guy.

397
00:34:45,914 --> 00:34:48,728
- How 'bout my father's mine?
- T.J., are you crazy?

398
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:51,095
- Come on.
- The mine!

399
00:34:51,961 --> 00:34:55,408
In the mine?
That'd be great.

400
00:34:55,481 --> 00:34:57,968
- It would! What a blast!
- In the mine, that's exactly...

401
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,429
- what it would be.
- It'd be great!

402
00:35:00,504 --> 00:35:02,413
Come on. We got
everything we need down there.

403
00:35:02,488 --> 00:35:06,164
Let's see. We got a rec room,
we got a pool table, everything.

404
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:09,395
Yeah, in the mine. Where people
get killed and eaten.

405
00:35:09,463 --> 00:35:11,372
Beware of Harry Warden.

406
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:15,949
Shut the fuck up!

407
00:35:16,022 --> 00:35:18,356
Beware of what you make fun of,
you little asshole!

408
00:35:18,421 --> 00:35:19,468
- Who?
- You!

409
00:35:20,182 --> 00:35:24,371
Forget about having a party at all
tomorrow night, or you'll be sorry.

410
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:27,566
Lighten up, Hap.

411
00:35:27,636 --> 00:35:30,156
Piss on Harry Warden
and that damn old legend.

412
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,716
We're gonna
have ourselves a party.

413
00:35:32,787 --> 00:35:34,762
Don't you go
tellin' nobody.

414
00:35:35,987 --> 00:35:37,994
Don't say
I didn't warn you.

415
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:41,899
That settles it, then!

416
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,108
We're goin' to the mine.
We're gonna have ourselves a party.

417
00:35:44,178 --> 00:35:46,862
- All right!
- Whoo!

418
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,577
<i>You're a full-time fool</i>

419
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,504
Assholes.

420
00:36:47,658 --> 00:36:49,894
Yeah. Damn kids.

421
00:36:49,962 --> 00:36:53,278
I'll show them.
Piss on Harry Warden, will they?

422
00:36:53,353 --> 00:36:55,808
Well, I'll give 'em a scare
they'll never forget.

423
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,021
Lights!

424
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:28,084
Come on!
It's cold out here!

425
00:38:28,157 --> 00:38:31,735
- Hey, it's party time!
- This is great!

426
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:33,014
Hey, Hollis!

427
00:38:34,044 --> 00:38:37,393
<i>...Saturday night and we'll stick
around till the mornin'light</i>

428
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:39,377
<i>Let the good times roll</i>

429
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:42,102
<i>Yeah, let the good times roll</i>

430
00:38:42,171 --> 00:38:44,985
<i>Let the good times roll--</i>

431
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:49,170
<i>Well, I work all day
just pushin'dirt</i>

432
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:52,024
<i>Got grease in my hair
coal on my shirt</i>

433
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,454
Hi, Ben. Anything happen?

434
00:38:57,529 --> 00:39:00,343
- No. It's been quiet all evening.
- Good.

435
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:02,935
That came for you, though.

436
00:39:06,104 --> 00:39:08,078
Oh, my God.

437
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:18,001
- Get me a coffee, will ya, Ben?
- Yeah, sure, Chief.

438
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,213
Mabel.

439
00:39:59,055 --> 00:40:01,543
Yoo! Does anybody
want a beer?

440
00:40:06,351 --> 00:40:07,561
Hollis, check this out.

441
00:40:09,647 --> 00:40:11,109
You asshole!

442
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,011
Hey, who busted the lock?
I got the keys right here.

443
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,934
- Howard did.
- Uh-oh!

444
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,105
- Howard.
- Harry Warden did it.

445
00:40:21,648 --> 00:40:23,819
And whoever parked
the red Volkswagen out front...

446
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:26,222
I want it parked out back
with the others, like I said.

447
00:40:26,288 --> 00:40:28,524
I don't want Newby
snoopin' around here.

448
00:40:28,591 --> 00:40:30,447
Let me show you.

449
00:40:42,448 --> 00:40:44,107
That's pretty crude!

450
00:40:46,353 --> 00:40:48,743
Quiet. You're making
too much noise!

451
00:40:48,817 --> 00:40:51,184
- Hey, whoa, Mr. Party.
- Whoa.

452
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:54,671
Johnny's got a catch there.
Hey,Johnny, where you going?

453
00:40:54,737 --> 00:40:56,777
Sylvia's gonna get it!

454
00:41:07,027 --> 00:41:08,936
Talk to you
in a minute, okay?

455
00:41:14,322 --> 00:41:17,618
So, you're looking pretty good,
baby face. What's the occasion?

456
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,537
I figure it will get
Newby off my back.

457
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,472
Besides, I wanna get out
of this town pretty quick.

458
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,401
You know, I think
he really likes you.

459
00:41:28,883 --> 00:41:30,793
I've got the munchies.

460
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,915
Hot dogs.

461
00:41:51,828 --> 00:41:53,354
Here, Spot.

462
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,726
No! Who is that?

463
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,037
I got a feeling
about the mine, Ben.

464
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:19,215
I'll check back
with you, all right?

465
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:23,247
Make sure you call me on the radio
if anything comes up.

466
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:24,627
Will do.

467
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:29,389
What the hell is that?

468
00:42:38,614 --> 00:42:39,858
Go on!

469
00:42:42,071 --> 00:42:43,478
Go on!

470
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:48,684
Go on!
Get the hell outta here!

471
00:43:07,831 --> 00:43:09,774
"You didn't stop the party."

472
00:43:12,471 --> 00:43:14,545
Stop the party?

473
00:43:14,617 --> 00:43:16,526
What damn party?

474
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:37,428
Stavisky, you couldn't clean
that table with a broom!

475
00:43:37,497 --> 00:43:40,399
Aw, Hollis,
you don't even know--

476
00:43:40,473 --> 00:43:43,441
Hey, guys, check this out.
Check this out. Gretchen.

477
00:43:43,514 --> 00:43:45,652
What are you doing, man?

478
00:43:45,721 --> 00:43:48,569
- Eww!
- Oh, wow!

479
00:43:48,633 --> 00:43:51,382
The first time I tried
to snort Coke, and I almost drown.

480
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:53,425
Next time,
try harder.

481
00:43:54,745 --> 00:43:56,851
- Axel, please.
- Oh, come on.

482
00:43:56,922 --> 00:43:58,296
Axel, please, don't.

483
00:43:58,362 --> 00:44:00,751
- What's the matter, baby?
- Axel, please, don't.

484
00:44:00,825 --> 00:44:04,720
- Oh, come on!
- Will you please stop it?

485
00:44:04,793 --> 00:44:06,649
Guess you better
back off there, Axel.

486
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:09,905
You back
the fuck off, man.

487
00:44:09,978 --> 00:44:13,110
We were doing just fine until you
decided to come crawlin' home.

488
00:44:13,179 --> 00:44:15,284
In case you haven't noticed,
things are changed around here.

489
00:44:15,354 --> 00:44:16,696
She don't want nothin'
to do with you.

490
00:44:16,763 --> 00:44:20,757
Do you mind?
I have my own mouth, thank you.

491
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:22,834
Then why don't you use it?
Tell him.

492
00:44:22,907 --> 00:44:24,761
Tell me what?

493
00:44:26,523 --> 00:44:28,726
She wants to come back
with me.

494
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:32,210
- Bullshit, man!
- Why don't you both just back off?

495
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:35,195
You're acting like
a couple of jerks.

496
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:39,573
Oh, well, you just
love it, don't you?

497
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,186
That's it.

498
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,372
You son of a bitch!

499
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,411
Hollis, do something!

500
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:55,640
Hollis! Let go!

501
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:57,366
- Damn it!
- Let go!

502
00:44:57,436 --> 00:45:00,088
Shit! You guys,
knock it off!

503
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:06,100
- T.J., are you outta shape.
- Get outta here!

504
00:45:19,901 --> 00:45:21,810
Sure you're okay?

505
00:45:34,077 --> 00:45:36,598
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for that to happen.

506
00:45:42,846 --> 00:45:45,148
T.J., please stop it.

507
00:45:45,214 --> 00:45:48,214
I just don't care anymore.

508
00:45:48,286 --> 00:45:50,141
Just leave me alone.

509
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:54,492
Come on.

510
00:45:57,919 --> 00:46:01,116
Okay, listen. I showed you how to
do it with the right nostril, right?

511
00:46:01,183 --> 00:46:03,932
You take the straw, you put it
up the neck-- the left nostril...

512
00:46:03,999 --> 00:46:05,854
and you snort it.

513
00:46:05,919 --> 00:46:08,058
Oh! Come on!
Loosen it up!

514
00:46:08,128 --> 00:46:10,998
Let's have fun. We're at
a Valentine's party, for God's sake!

515
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:13,176
I'm getting
a little punchy myself.

516
00:47:00,834 --> 00:47:03,322
How do you
get those down?

517
00:47:03,394 --> 00:47:05,849
- Pull the rope.
-Just pull it?

518
00:47:07,395 --> 00:47:09,434
Yeah, yeah.
Release the hook and let it go.

519
00:47:14,818 --> 00:47:17,023
Mm. You know what we need?

520
00:47:17,091 --> 00:47:19,457
Yeah, I got one right here.

521
00:47:21,763 --> 00:47:23,901
No, I meant
a couple of beers.

522
00:47:24,836 --> 00:47:26,745
- I'll go get 'em.
- I'll go with you.

523
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:29,339
No, you stay here,
and I'll be back in a flash.

524
00:47:35,268 --> 00:47:38,082
- Okay, but don't take too long.
- Back in a minute.

525
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:41,529
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

526
00:48:03,557 --> 00:48:06,207
- Hey, T.J.
- Hey,John, how ya doin'?

527
00:48:06,276 --> 00:48:08,797
I'm doing great.
Is something the matter?

528
00:48:11,557 --> 00:48:12,899
Same old shit.

529
00:48:18,085 --> 00:48:19,808
Howard really makes me gag.

530
00:48:19,877 --> 00:48:22,528
- You're not kidding.
- I kinda like Tommy.

531
00:48:22,598 --> 00:48:24,059
Oh, I agree.

532
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:26,653
- Hi,John.
- Hi, girls.

533
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:30,302
Yuck! What is this?

534
00:48:30,373 --> 00:48:33,373
Oh, wow. One of those idiots
really thinks he's funny.

535
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:38,815
It's probably Howard.

536
00:49:19,528 --> 00:49:21,382
John, is that you?

537
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,730
John?

538
00:49:37,673 --> 00:49:40,640
John, if you're trying to scare me,
you're doing a good job.

539
00:49:58,793 --> 00:50:00,680
Help! Help!

540
00:50:03,818 --> 00:50:05,411
No!

541
00:50:19,722 --> 00:50:21,381
No!

542
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:31,786
Sorry I took so long, babe.

543
00:50:33,899 --> 00:50:35,755
Sylvia?

544
00:50:36,811 --> 00:50:38,667
Sylvia?

545
00:50:41,516 --> 00:50:44,364
All right.
Hey, all right.

546
00:50:45,516 --> 00:50:47,971
All right. Sylvia?

547
00:50:49,068 --> 00:50:51,915
I know you're in there,
and I'm comin' in.

548
00:50:55,244 --> 00:50:57,099
Sylvia?

549
00:51:21,518 --> 00:51:23,372
<i>Come in, Mobile One.</i>

550
00:51:24,622 --> 00:51:26,564
Mobile One here.

551
00:51:26,638 --> 00:51:28,547
<i>Jake, you just got
a call from Eastfield.</i>

552
00:51:28,622 --> 00:51:30,596
<i>A woman named Raleigh.
She said it was urgent.</i>

553
00:51:32,111 --> 00:51:34,925
All right.
Mobile One coming in.

554
00:51:44,046 --> 00:51:46,283
How 'bout a little trip
down to the mine?

555
00:51:46,351 --> 00:51:47,780
- The mine?
- It'll be great.

556
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,447
It's like a roller coaster,
isn't it?

557
00:51:49,518 --> 00:51:51,112
It's 2,000 feet down.

558
00:51:51,183 --> 00:51:54,479
That's okay. It'll cheer her up.
Come on, Hollis.

559
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:56,169
- Mike, let's go.
- What?

560
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:58,377
-Hollis, you goin' down to the mine?
-Well--

561
00:51:58,446 --> 00:52:00,105
Yes. Come on.

562
00:52:00,175 --> 00:52:01,582
- All right!
- Come on.

563
00:52:01,647 --> 00:52:03,109
- Chicken.
- Chicken?

564
00:52:03,183 --> 00:52:05,704
- Why don't we go down to the mine?
- All right.

565
00:52:05,775 --> 00:52:07,466
One quick ride down
and right back up.

566
00:52:07,535 --> 00:52:09,062
What about gear?

567
00:52:09,136 --> 00:52:11,591
Yeah, get that six-pack.

568
00:52:11,664 --> 00:52:13,519
This is gonna
be great, baby!

569
00:52:21,744 --> 00:52:23,632
Watch your step.
Come on.

570
00:52:23,697 --> 00:52:26,511
This is ridiculous with you girls
in those dresses.

571
00:52:31,377 --> 00:52:33,995
Hollis! Where do you
think you're going?

572
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:36,715
We're going for a quick ride
and coming right back up.

573
00:52:36,785 --> 00:52:40,811
You can't. You know the rule.
No women in the mine.

574
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:42,670
We're gonna come right back
up again. Believe me.

575
00:52:42,738 --> 00:52:43,981
Watch your step.

576
00:52:50,865 --> 00:52:52,840
Howard, don't be
a pain in the ass.

577
00:52:52,913 --> 00:52:54,822
"Pain in the ass"?
What "pain in the ass"?

578
00:52:54,897 --> 00:52:57,287
- Watch your step, okay?
- Be careful.

579
00:52:57,362 --> 00:52:59,216
Down we go!

580
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,101
Come on, you guys.
Hop in the cars. I'll be right back.

581
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:07,505
- Yeah, we made it.
- You just let me know!

582
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:20,114
Here, Sarah,
put this around you.

583
00:53:20,179 --> 00:53:22,284
Michael, here you go.
And a blanket.

584
00:53:22,355 --> 00:53:24,843
And a blanket?
Hollis, you got one for me?

585
00:53:24,915 --> 00:53:27,151
Here's one for you.
I'll be right back.

586
00:53:27,219 --> 00:53:29,674
Can you believe we're
really doing this?

587
00:53:33,427 --> 00:53:35,370
It's so dark
down there!

588
00:53:35,444 --> 00:53:38,160
On second thought, I think
I'm gonna stay right up here.

589
00:53:38,228 --> 00:53:41,130
No, you don't. If I'm goin' down
there, baby, you're goin' with me.

590
00:53:41,204 --> 00:53:43,059
- Oh, great.
- Hold on, everybody.

591
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:44,913
Here we go!

592
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,889
Keep your hands inside.

593
00:53:46,964 --> 00:53:50,412
- Pass me that beer!
- All right!

594
00:53:50,484 --> 00:53:52,371
Come on. Pass a couple
up this way.

595
00:53:52,435 --> 00:53:54,705
- Where's the lantern?
- Right here.Just stick with me.

596
00:54:00,468 --> 00:54:02,803
Look out below!

597
00:54:08,885 --> 00:54:10,794
Hold on.
Get ready for bumps.

598
00:54:18,325 --> 00:54:21,228
Hey, Hollis, pass me a beer.
Want one, Mike?

599
00:54:21,302 --> 00:54:23,571
How far down
does this go?

600
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:27,538
- Come on, Sarah.
- Here you go.

601
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:34,924
Wow!

602
00:54:34,998 --> 00:54:37,616
All right!

603
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:50,766
Little bitty free ride.
There we go.

604
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:52,694
- Stops all by itself.
- Great, Hollis.

605
00:54:52,759 --> 00:54:55,061
Let's go. Yeah, I hope you kids
enjoyed yourself...

606
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:56,589
'cause we're goin' right back up.

607
00:54:56,663 --> 00:54:59,478
- That was great. Let's do it again.
- Howard usually walks.

608
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,254
Let's do it again.
Come on.

609
00:55:04,312 --> 00:55:06,035
Where does that go?

610
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:09,137
That leads to an abandoned part.
We don't go down there anymore.

611
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:11,117
- Take us on a tour, Hollis.
- Yeah!

612
00:55:11,192 --> 00:55:14,192
- Yeah, let's show 'em around.
- All right, all right.

613
00:55:14,264 --> 00:55:16,119
Just because we're here.
Come on.

614
00:55:16,184 --> 00:55:18,039
Keep those blankets wrapped
around you. You're gonna get filthy.

615
00:55:18,105 --> 00:55:19,959
Okay, Daddy.

616
00:55:20,024 --> 00:55:21,682
It's cold down here.

617
00:55:22,713 --> 00:55:24,785
All right, boys and girls.
This is called a tipple.

618
00:55:24,856 --> 00:55:26,350
So that's a tipple.

619
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,391
This is also
called a tipple.

620
00:55:32,281 --> 00:55:33,742
Hey, Howard, come on!

621
00:55:33,817 --> 00:55:35,158
- Comin'.
- Howard, come on!

622
00:55:35,225 --> 00:55:38,608
I'm comin'! I just heard something.
Probably some rats.

623
00:55:38,681 --> 00:55:41,551
Rats? You never
told me there are rats!

624
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:44,280
This is the old engine room.

625
00:55:45,305 --> 00:55:47,161
Boy, what a nice view back here.

626
00:55:55,642 --> 00:55:58,097
We'll meet you in ten minutes
over at the main shaft!

627
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:01,302
All right. No longer.
We're going straight up.

628
00:56:21,435 --> 00:56:23,290
How do you like my pad, huh?

629
00:56:30,747 --> 00:56:32,634
I can't believe you work here.

630
00:56:32,699 --> 00:56:34,075
Yep.

631
00:56:52,733 --> 00:56:55,285
- He's in there!
- What is it? What's the matter?

632
00:56:56,316 --> 00:56:58,226
He's in there!
He's in there!

633
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,042
- What's going on? What's going on?
- His face!

634
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:09,940
She's dead.

635
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:12,893
- He killed--
- What are you talking about?

636
00:57:13,021 --> 00:57:14,482
What are you talking about?

637
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:15,932
Dave is dead!

638
00:57:22,013 --> 00:57:24,402
And Sylvia!
Somebody's killed her!

639
00:57:24,477 --> 00:57:26,332
It's Harry Warden!
He's here!

640
00:57:26,397 --> 00:57:29,943
Everybody, get the fuck out!
Go! Go! Go!

641
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,885
Come on! Come on!

642
00:57:39,102 --> 00:57:42,037
Son of a bitch must've
cut the phone lines!

643
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:45,077
Listen to me. I want you to make
sure everybody gets out of here.

644
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:49,624
I want you to get the chief and tell
him to get here, and fast! Now go!

645
00:57:53,054 --> 00:57:55,641
Sarah, she's in the mine
with the others.

646
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:58,646
- What?
- Her, Hollis and Patty.

647
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,916
They took the railcars down there.
They're in the mine right now.

648
00:58:01,983 --> 00:58:04,318
- We gotta get them out.
- That's where he probably is.

649
00:58:04,383 --> 00:58:06,237
He'll kill them!

650
00:58:06,302 --> 00:58:10,231
I'm gonna get them out.
Come on! Come on!

651
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:20,634
Go! Go!

652
00:58:21,439 --> 00:58:22,815
Come on!

653
00:58:28,544 --> 00:58:30,398
If anything happens to Sarah,
it'll be your fault!

654
00:58:30,464 --> 00:58:32,253
You never should've let them
go down there!

655
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:34,109
Let's worry about getting them out.

656
00:58:34,176 --> 00:58:35,867
I'll take the abandoned section.
You take the level above.

657
00:58:35,936 --> 00:58:38,303
We'll meet in the main shaft
by the elevator.

658
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:40,605
I hope to God we get there
before Harry does.

659
00:58:41,633 --> 00:58:43,487
Good luck.

660
00:59:07,106 --> 00:59:09,528
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

661
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:15,293
Boo! Gotcha.

662
00:59:15,363 --> 00:59:17,751
Damn you, Hollis.
Where the hell were you?

663
00:59:17,826 --> 00:59:20,412
I thought you were right behind me.
You must've taken the wrong tunnel.

664
00:59:20,482 --> 00:59:22,903
Oh, sure we did.
You did that on purpose.

665
00:59:22,978 --> 00:59:24,834
Me?

666
00:59:24,899 --> 00:59:26,753
Come on.

667
00:59:29,251 --> 00:59:31,323
Watch your head.
Watch your step as well.

668
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,930
This is the oldest part
of the mine.

669
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:42,107
Oh, gosh!

670
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:44,219
These tunnels were built
in the early 1800s.

671
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:47,608
- Really?
- Yeah, it's all abandoned now.

672
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:49,887
We haven't worked down here
in years.

673
00:59:49,956 --> 00:59:51,996
Not since Harry Warden.

674
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:57,468
Howard, what do you think
you're trying to do, you jerk?

675
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,962
Easy. I got a hangover.

676
01:00:00,036 --> 01:00:03,332
- Boy, did you guys jump.
- I'll get you down.

677
01:00:04,676 --> 01:00:06,979
Oh, Howard, you goof.

678
01:00:07,045 --> 01:00:09,346
- Get down out of there.
- Wait. I'll go the other way.

679
01:00:09,412 --> 01:00:11,715
- For Pete's sake.
- I know what I'm doing.

680
01:00:14,629 --> 01:00:16,036
God, you guys.

681
01:00:16,102 --> 01:00:18,654
- Come on. Hold it.
- Ooh, that feels so good.

682
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:24,323
- Get your light.
- Got it.

683
01:00:24,389 --> 01:00:25,732
- Okay?
- Yeah.

684
01:00:25,798 --> 01:00:27,707
- You all right?
- Come on.

685
01:00:27,782 --> 01:00:31,131
Get down! Stick with us
and quit clowning around.

686
01:00:31,206 --> 01:00:33,661
- I was just having some of fun.
- Yeah, sure.

687
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:36,320
Hey, you guys,
where's Mike and Harriet?

688
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:39,074
- Maybe Harry Warden got 'em.
- Stop it!

689
01:00:39,143 --> 01:00:42,688
- Howard, come along and behave.
- Yeah, let's go.

690
01:00:44,422 --> 01:00:45,983
- My blanket!
- Come on.

691
01:00:46,054 --> 01:00:48,673
You'd forget your head
if it wasn't tied on with rope.

692
01:00:48,743 --> 01:00:51,231
- It's freezing down here.
- Who's leading this tour?

693
01:01:01,894 --> 01:01:04,066
I feel so good.

694
01:01:04,135 --> 01:01:05,990
So do I.

695
01:01:13,896 --> 01:01:15,270
Where are we going now?

696
01:01:15,335 --> 01:01:18,118
This leads to the main shaft.
We're going up.

697
01:01:18,184 --> 01:01:20,704
How come the walls are
so white around here, Hollis?

698
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:24,257
I told you, it's lime powder. They
put it here to contain explosions...

699
01:01:24,328 --> 01:01:27,328
and they put it on the wood
so it doesn't get dry and crack.

700
01:01:27,401 --> 01:01:31,012
Hey, you guys, how come Mike
and Harriet haven't come back yet?

701
01:01:35,496 --> 01:01:37,155
What's that?

702
01:01:46,761 --> 01:01:48,932
I thought I heard something.

703
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:51,336
It's probably only rats.

704
01:01:51,402 --> 01:01:53,573
That ain't no rat.

705
01:01:53,641 --> 01:01:57,286
Come on. Let's go find Mike
and Harriet and get out of here.

706
01:01:58,665 --> 01:01:59,943
Come on.

707
01:02:21,707 --> 01:02:24,577
Tommy Whitcomb, what's the matter
with you? Where's your brains?

708
01:02:24,651 --> 01:02:26,506
- How many times have I told you--
- Chief, listen to me!

709
01:02:26,571 --> 01:02:28,710
You have to go to the mine.

710
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:31,462
We were having a party, and Harry
Warden started killing everybody!

711
01:02:33,867 --> 01:02:37,315
Harry Warden is at the mine. There's
a bunch of kids trapped below.

712
01:02:37,388 --> 01:02:39,275
Axel and T.J.
are trying to get them out.

713
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,543
He killed Sylvia and Dave!

714
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:44,001
Get back in that car
and get home and stay put!

715
01:02:45,068 --> 01:02:46,442
Go on!

716
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:57,547
<i>- Mobile One in.
- Go ahead, Chief.</i>

717
01:02:57,612 --> 01:02:59,684
Yeah, Ben.
Call the mayor right away.

718
01:02:59,756 --> 01:03:02,921
Then round up every available man.
Meet me back at the mine.

719
01:03:04,492 --> 01:03:06,697
I think there's some kids
trapped down below.

720
01:03:06,765 --> 01:03:08,772
Out.

721
01:03:08,845 --> 01:03:12,161
- Howard, would you get up front?
- I'm trying to get up in the front.

722
01:03:13,676 --> 01:03:15,532
- Do we know where we're going?
- I can't even see.

723
01:03:15,597 --> 01:03:17,452
Just stay beside me.

724
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:23,874
- Why don't they answer us?
- Stavisky!

725
01:03:23,949 --> 01:03:26,055
We never should have
left them in the first place.

726
01:03:27,086 --> 01:03:29,323
- Maybe they're down there.
-Jesus!

727
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:31,244
- What are you trying to do?
- You scared me!

728
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:33,731
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, we're fine.

729
01:03:33,805 --> 01:03:37,002
- What's the matter with you?
- We gotta get out of here.

730
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:38,925
Harry Warden is back.

731
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:42,339
- He's killed Sylvia and Dave.
- Are you kidding?

732
01:03:42,414 --> 01:03:45,317
What are you saying? Harry's dead.
Harry died a long time ago.

733
01:03:45,391 --> 01:03:48,107
Will you shut up
and listen to me, goddamn it?

734
01:03:48,175 --> 01:03:50,597
Now, they're dead,
and he's down here somewhere.

735
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:54,380
If you want to get out alive,
you do exactly as I tell you.

736
01:03:54,447 --> 01:03:56,007
What are we gonna do?

737
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:58,829
This better not be
your idea of a joke, T.J.

738
01:03:58,895 --> 01:04:02,986
Do I look like I'm joking?
Come on. Let's go.

739
01:04:03,055 --> 01:04:05,575
Wait a minute, now.
What about Mike and Harriet?

740
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:08,168
The last time I saw them,
they were in the engine room.

741
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:11,272
You check the main shaft. I'll take
tunnel six and meet you there.

742
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:14,126
Howard, you stay with the girls...

743
01:04:14,192 --> 01:04:15,785
- and wait for Axel.
- Me?

744
01:04:15,856 --> 01:04:18,377
- Stay with Howard. Stay there!
- No, Hollis, please!

745
01:04:18,448 --> 01:04:20,203
Hollis, wait a minute!

746
01:04:21,713 --> 01:04:24,462
Howard, you watch the girls!

747
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:28,266
I don't even know
my way around here.

748
01:04:28,337 --> 01:04:30,278
Oh, shit!

749
01:04:36,785 --> 01:04:40,101
Michael and Harriet, this isn't
any time to be doing anything.

750
01:05:51,124 --> 01:05:53,263
Oh,Jesus!

751
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:10,513
Oh, God, Hollis.

752
01:06:12,949 --> 01:06:15,338
Oh, it's not fair.

753
01:06:15,414 --> 01:06:17,268
Hollis, please--

754
01:06:26,454 --> 01:06:28,842
Come on.
He's dead. He's dead!

755
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:32,114
- Come on! Come on!
- Patty, come on.

756
01:06:32,182 --> 01:06:34,354
Come on! He's dead!
Now come on!

757
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:41,131
- Howard, you bastard!
- He's dead! Now come on!

758
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:43,062
You can't leave us like this!

759
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,726
Please, help me!

760
01:06:51,543 --> 01:06:53,813
- Leave him alone!
- Let go of me!

761
01:06:53,879 --> 01:06:56,050
Patty, we need the light,
damn it!

762
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:06,166
Okay. Come on, Patty.

763
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:09,330
Don't do this to me.
We have to get out of here!

764
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:13,720
Stop it!

765
01:07:18,616 --> 01:07:19,663
Come on.

766
01:07:24,024 --> 01:07:27,505
Oh, my God.
Where are the others?

767
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:29,812
We saw him.
He was standing right there.

768
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,302
Harry Warden is down here!

769
01:07:32,376 --> 01:07:35,410
- Come on. Let's go.
- Come on.

770
01:07:35,481 --> 01:07:38,961
Let's go! Come on!
Where the hell is T.J.?

771
01:07:39,033 --> 01:07:40,976
He went looking
for Mike and Harriet.

772
01:07:41,049 --> 01:07:43,220
He told us to stay here.

773
01:07:46,745 --> 01:07:50,041
Come on. The cage
is right up ahead. Let's go!

774
01:07:50,105 --> 01:07:53,236
- Keep moving. You're gonna be fine.
- Axel, please, no!

775
01:07:57,337 --> 01:08:01,266
I don't want to leave him there.
Please, let's go back and get him.

776
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:05,493
- Oh, please, Axel, no!
- Keep moving.

777
01:08:05,563 --> 01:08:08,727
- Patty, stop it.
- I don't wanna leave him there.

778
01:08:08,795 --> 01:08:10,649
You'll be fine.
You're gonna be just fine.

779
01:08:12,058 --> 01:08:15,801
- Where are you taking us?
- Keep moving. We're almost there.

780
01:08:15,867 --> 01:08:19,031
- I can't--
- Keep moving. You're doing fine.

781
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:20,659
That's it.

782
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:24,025
Oh, God, where are we going?

783
01:08:25,659 --> 01:08:27,514
I can't make it anymore!

784
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:29,434
Shut up! Yes, you can!

785
01:08:29,499 --> 01:08:31,354
- Come on. Let's go!
- I can't!

786
01:08:31,419 --> 01:08:32,947
Let's go.

787
01:08:46,237 --> 01:08:48,309
Oh, God.

788
01:08:56,989 --> 01:08:58,843
It's T.J.

789
01:09:00,733 --> 01:09:03,766
- Aw, shit!
- What do you think you're doing?

790
01:09:03,836 --> 01:09:05,625
I'm sorry.
I thought you were Harry!

791
01:09:05,693 --> 01:09:07,547
Do I look like Harry?

792
01:09:07,612 --> 01:09:09,467
- Where's Howard?
- He ran off.

793
01:09:09,532 --> 01:09:12,380
That jerk. He's never gonna find
his way out of here alone.

794
01:09:12,445 --> 01:09:14,300
Hollis is dead.

795
01:09:14,366 --> 01:09:17,780
Look, we gotta get
Sarah and Patty up top...

796
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:20,188
get some help
and come back for the others.

797
01:09:22,173 --> 01:09:24,116
- Come on.
- Okay, let's go.

798
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:26,360
Come on. Come on.
Let's keep going.

799
01:10:14,336 --> 01:10:17,980
<i>Mobile One, come in.
Mobile One.</i>

800
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,895
<i>Come in, Mobile One.</i>

801
01:10:26,529 --> 01:10:27,990
Watch your step.

802
01:10:28,064 --> 01:10:29,974
I can't even see.

803
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:32,896
- We're almost there.
- Keep your voices down.

804
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,816
Come on.

805
01:10:34,881 --> 01:10:37,695
- Please hurry.
- Keep your voices down.

806
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:01,723
He smashed the control panel.
We're not getting out of here.

807
01:11:01,794 --> 01:11:03,202
What?

808
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:06,910
What are we gonna do?

809
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:09,817
Climb.

810
01:11:11,555 --> 01:11:12,700
Come on.

811
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,800
Watch your footing, now.

812
01:11:27,876 --> 01:11:30,461
Axel, please slow down.

813
01:11:30,531 --> 01:11:33,346
Patty, you're okay.
I'm right behind you. Keep going.

814
01:11:41,444 --> 01:11:43,899
Come on. Don't look down.
Keep looking up.

815
01:11:43,972 --> 01:11:47,267
Patty, just do as he says
and you'll be fine. I promise.

816
01:11:53,508 --> 01:11:55,875
I don't want to go any further!

817
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:58,690
Please, can we stop
and go another way?

818
01:11:58,756 --> 01:12:02,052
There's no other way!
Now move it, damn it!

819
01:12:12,709 --> 01:12:15,295
Axel, you have to go slower.
I'm right behind her.

820
01:12:15,366 --> 01:12:17,340
She keeps stopping.

821
01:12:17,413 --> 01:12:20,064
Go slower, okay?

822
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:33,125
I'm scared of heights,
you guys.

823
01:12:33,191 --> 01:12:36,387
I'm not going any further.
I'm stopping right here.

824
01:12:36,454 --> 01:12:38,113
Sarah, give her a hand!

825
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:43,365
It's okay.
I'm right behind you.

826
01:12:43,431 --> 01:12:45,503
I'm right behind you.
Come on.

827
01:12:46,726 --> 01:12:48,996
- Stay close.
- Okay. I'm right behind you.

828
01:12:50,023 --> 01:12:53,602
Good girl.
Keep moving. Good girl.

829
01:13:06,184 --> 01:13:08,704
Come down!
Come down, quick! Down!

830
01:13:29,224 --> 01:13:31,080
Don't look.

831
01:13:32,169 --> 01:13:34,078
Don't look at him.
Come on!

832
01:13:35,753 --> 01:13:37,760
Patty, over here.

833
01:13:41,385 --> 01:13:45,346
Now he's up top. That bastard's
really playing games with us.

834
01:13:45,418 --> 01:13:48,167
We can beat him if we
can get to the railcars.

835
01:13:48,233 --> 01:13:51,332
I know a shortcut through the sump.
It's over there.

836
01:13:51,401 --> 01:13:52,895
Let's go.

837
01:13:54,826 --> 01:13:56,680
Watch your step.

838
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:07,626
Come on. Come on, come on.

839
01:14:07,691 --> 01:14:10,690
Nice and slow.
Let's go. Slowly.

840
01:14:12,267 --> 01:14:16,423
T.J., take the girls over, and give
me a yell when you're across, okay?

841
01:14:17,771 --> 01:14:19,145
Go!

842
01:14:21,227 --> 01:14:23,082
Watch your step.

843
01:14:39,884 --> 01:14:42,023
Okay, Axel, we're clear.
Come on over.

844
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:58,796
T.J., do something.

845
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,770
There's nothing I can do.

846
01:15:00,845 --> 01:15:02,700
It's 60-feet deep.

847
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:04,972
Gosh!

848
01:15:05,037 --> 01:15:07,208
We've gotta get out of here.

849
01:15:07,276 --> 01:15:09,830
- We can't just leave him here.
- Move it!

850
01:15:10,862 --> 01:15:13,512
It's too late for Axel.

851
01:15:13,581 --> 01:15:15,109
Come on.

852
01:15:35,215 --> 01:15:37,550
Okay, you just hug along
the left side of the wall.

853
01:15:37,615 --> 01:15:40,036
Just keep going.
Go on. Continue.

854
01:15:41,646 --> 01:15:43,948
- But why--
-Just do as he says.

855
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,335
Answer us.

856
01:16:17,648 --> 01:16:19,503
Let's go this way.

857
01:16:32,753 --> 01:16:34,280
Careful.

858
01:16:44,401 --> 01:16:47,303
Okay, there's gotta
be some way out of here.

859
01:16:47,377 --> 01:16:49,232
Come on. Keep going.

860
01:16:54,962 --> 01:16:56,488
Come on.

861
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:10,412
Come on.

862
01:18:20,822 --> 01:18:22,480
It's okay.
I just got hit.

863
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:24,405
Come on.
We've gotta hurry.

864
01:18:33,238 --> 01:18:35,093
The elevator isn't working.

865
01:18:35,158 --> 01:18:37,679
We're gonna have to go in
this way. Let's go!

866
01:18:57,239 --> 01:18:58,766
Jump!

867
01:20:01,882 --> 01:20:03,737
Everyone, watch this thing coming!

868
01:20:19,259 --> 01:20:21,114
Oh, my God.

869
01:20:32,316 --> 01:20:34,171
Sarah, move it!

870
01:20:37,564 --> 01:20:39,419
Get in. Get in!

871
01:20:47,229 --> 01:20:48,505
Watch out!

872
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:42,487
Why?

873
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,425
Come on.

874
01:22:06,592 --> 01:22:08,348
He's in there.

875
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,451
Are you two all right?

876
01:22:17,569 --> 01:22:20,668
- It isn't Harry Warden.
- Yeah, I know, T.J.

877
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:23,959
I got a call from Eastfield
late this evening.

878
01:22:25,314 --> 01:22:28,543
They said that Harry Warden
died five years ago.

879
01:22:28,609 --> 01:22:30,780
Well, then, who is it?

880
01:22:32,289 --> 01:22:36,217
- It's Axel.
- Oh, my God.

881
01:22:38,018 --> 01:22:39,872
Get where you're going.

882
01:22:43,106 --> 01:22:44,796
My God.

883
01:22:44,866 --> 01:22:48,958
It was on Valentine's Day that
Harry Warden killed Axel's father!

884
01:22:50,722 --> 01:22:52,578
- Let's get in there.
- Yeah.

885
01:23:18,724 --> 01:23:21,059
He's alive!

886
01:23:22,532 --> 01:23:24,386
Oh, my God!

887
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,652
T.J., I have to see him!

888
01:23:37,284 --> 01:23:40,601
Hanniger, I'll be waiting
in hell for you!

889
01:23:40,677 --> 01:23:42,725
Harry, I'm coming!

890
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:46,752
This whole fucking town
is going to die!

891
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:49,374
We're coming back,
you bastards!

892
01:23:52,517 --> 01:23:54,884
Sarah, be my bloody valentine.

893
01:23:57,253 --> 01:24:01,279
<i>Daddy's gone away</i>

894
01:24:01,349 --> 01:24:05,627
<i>Harry Warden made you pay</i>

895
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:17,729
<i>Once upon a time
on a sad Valentine's</i>

896
01:24:17,798 --> 01:24:22,054
<i>In a place known as Hanniger Mine</i>

897
01:24:22,119 --> 01:24:23,973
<i>A legend began</i>

898
01:24:24,039 --> 01:24:26,209
<i>Every woman and man</i>

899
01:24:26,279 --> 01:24:30,207
<i>Would always remember the time</i>

900
01:24:30,278 --> 01:24:34,021
<i>And those who remain
were never the same</i>

901
01:24:34,087 --> 01:24:38,430
<i>You could see
the fear in their eyes</i>

902
01:24:38,503 --> 01:24:42,148
<i>Once every year
as the 14th draws near</i>

903
01:24:42,215 --> 01:24:46,209
<i>There's a hush
all over the town</i>

904
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,320
<i>Oh, the legend, they say</i>

905
01:24:48,391 --> 01:24:50,334
<i>On a Valentine's Day</i>

906
01:24:50,408 --> 01:24:54,466
<i>Is a curse that'll live on and on</i>

907
01:24:54,535 --> 01:24:58,594
<i>And no one will know
as the years come and go</i>

908
01:24:58,664 --> 01:25:02,243
<i>Of the horror from long time ago</i>

909
01:25:06,793 --> 01:25:09,061
<i>Twenty years came and went</i>

910
01:25:09,128 --> 01:25:14,148
<i>And everyone spent
the 14th in quiet regret</i>

911
01:25:15,305 --> 01:25:19,047
<i>And those still alive
know the secret survives</i>

912
01:25:19,113 --> 01:25:22,212
<i>In the darkness
that looms in the night</i>

913
01:25:23,176 --> 01:25:25,282
<i>Oh, the legend, they say</i>

914
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:27,295
<i>On a Valentine's Day</i>

915
01:25:27,369 --> 01:25:31,396
<i>Is a curse that'll live on and on</i>

916
01:25:31,465 --> 01:25:33,440
<i>And no one will know</i>

917
01:25:33,514 --> 01:25:35,554
<i>As the years come and go</i>

918
01:25:35,625 --> 01:25:39,652
<i>Of the horror from long time ago</i>

919
01:25:39,722 --> 01:25:41,761
<i>In this little town</i>

920
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:43,721
<i>When the 14th comes around</i>

921
01:25:43,787 --> 01:25:48,010
<i>There's a silence
and fear in the air</i>

922
01:25:48,075 --> 01:25:49,929
<i>Remember the morn</i>

923
01:25:49,994 --> 01:25:52,068
<i>That the legend was born</i>

924
01:25:52,138 --> 01:25:56,099
<i>All the shock
and the horror was there</i>

925
01:25:56,171 --> 01:25:58,081
<i>Oh, the legend, they say</i>

926
01:25:58,155 --> 01:26:00,194
<i>On a Valentine's Day</i>

927
01:26:00,266 --> 01:26:04,325
<i>Is a curse that'll live on and on</i>
