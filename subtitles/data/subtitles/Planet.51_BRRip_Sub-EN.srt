3
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,991
I've never gone
parking before.

4
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,285
I'm really not
that kind of a girl.

5
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,328
Well, I'm not
the kind of a guy

6
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,330
who would go with
that kind of a girl.

7
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,167
Oh, that's so sweet.
I think.

8
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,086
There's nothing
to be scared of.

9
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,805
I knew this would
happen if we made out!

10
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,657
Good shot, son.

11
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,957
Uh, General, I think
he's surrendering.

12
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,303
Run! Run!

13
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,138
Fire at will!

14
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,569
Help!

15
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,991
Keep firing. Keep firing! Keep firing!

16
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,952
Kill every last alien!

17
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,794
You will all become
my alien zombies.

18
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,840
Ouch, Mom!
Command us, Master!

19
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,936
What did I tell you
about these kind of movies?

20
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,896
It was almost over!

21
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,731
Besides, they're
all the same.

22
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,941
That's not true.

23
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,694
# Lollipop, lollipop
Lo! I,! O! I,! O! I

24
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,530
# Lollipop, lollipop
Oh, lolli, lolli, lolli

25
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,614
# Lollipop

26
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,828
# Lollipop, lollipop
Oh, lolli, lolli, lolli

27
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,789
# Lollipop, lollipop
Lo! I,! O! I,! O! I

28
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,709
# Lollipop, lollipop
Oh, lolli, lolli, lolli

29
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:30,751
# Lollipop

30
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,754
You know, he looks
just like his father.

31
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,216
Just
like his father.

32
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,553
# And when he does
his shakin' rocky dance

33
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,513
# Man, I haven't got a chance

34
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,726
# I call him Lollipop,
lollipop Oh, lolli, lolli, lolli

35
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,770
# Lollipop, lollipop
Lolli, lolli, lolli

36
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,857
# Lollipop, lollipop
Oh, lolli, lolli, lolli

37
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,317
# Lollipop

38
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,905
# Sweeter than candy
on a stick

39
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,949
# Huckleberry, cherry or lime

40
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,911
# If you had a choice
he'd be your pick

41
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,122
# But lollipop is mine

42
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,125
# Lollipop, lollipop
Oh, lolli, lolli, lolli

43
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,170
# Lollipop, lollipop
Lolli, lolli, lolli

44
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,006
# Lollipop, lollipop
Oh, lolli, lolli, lolli

45
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,090
# Lollipop

46
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,635
Oh, I hate the rain.

47
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,603
Raining rocks and dogs.

48
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,021
Great!

49
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,109
# Sweeter than candy
on a stick

50
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,154
# Huckleberry, cherry or lime

51
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,115
# If you had a choice
he'd be your pick

52
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,369
# But lollipop is mine

53
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,413
# Lollipop, lollipop
Lolli, lolli, lolli

54
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,500
# Lollipop, lollipop
Oh, lolli, lolli, lolli

55
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,794
# Lollipop, lollipop
Lolli, lolli, lolli

56
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,504
# Holding my lollipop

57
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,922
# Lollipop #

58
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,051
Space,

59
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,138
a universe of mystery.

60
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,308
Well, today, the mystery
will be unveiled.

61
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,978
Thanks to science,
we now know

62
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:15,398
the universe is
nearly 500 miles long

63
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,567
and it contains, you're
not going to believe this,

64
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,570
over 1,000 stars.

65
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,867
Psst! Lem, come on!
Liven it up.

66
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,579
And still, the only
known intelligent life

67
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,874
is right here
on our planet.

68
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,172
Huh?

69
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,800
No, not today!
Not today! Please.

70
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,343
What was that?

71
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,971
That's our planet after
the attack of the Humaniacs.

72
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,433
They're gonna eat
our brains for dinner!

73
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,059
Is that true?

74
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,229
Everybody, please,
that's ridiculous.

75
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:59,942
Totally ridiculous.
Brains for dinner? Come on!

76
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,237
Brains are for breakfast
with cereal and milk.

77
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,780
Dinner is
organs and eyeballs.

78
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,954
Okay, everyone, everyone,
please, listen up.

79
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,540
We're not getting eaten

80
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,669
or harvested or having
our brains barbecued.

81
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,090
The universe isn't scary.
It's really amazing.

82
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:29,764
And don't forget to pick up
your planetary yo-yos.

83
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,934
We've got one
for each of you.

84
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:44,445
You're looking at the new
Junior Assistant Curator!

85
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,155
High four! Whoo-hoo!

86
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,409
Well, it's part-time now and
full-time after I graduate.

87
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,119
How did you do, Lem? Got the job!

88
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,537
Knew you would.

89
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,039
Hey, I can see
my whole life.

90
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,751
A house, a car, two kids,
they'll grow up and have kids.

91
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,045
They'll come home
to visit on holidays.

92
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,755
Well?
Got it!

93
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,467
Lem, congratulations
on that job.

94
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,302
I knew you could do it.

95
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,678
Yeah, thanks.

96
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,682
Oh, wow!

97
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,398
There it is.
Just two more days.

98
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,942
Wow.

99
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:27,696
Humaniacs lll: The Final
Battle for Our World.

100
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,658
Victory
or extinction!

101
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,621
If you guys go
in costume,

102
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,039
I'm pretending
we never met.

103
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,085
Did you just say what
I think you just said?

104
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,629
I'm a planetarium
professional now.

105
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,965
I don't have time for
kids' movies anymore.

106
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,467
Kids' movies?

107
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,470
I suppose next you'll
say aliens don't exist.

108
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:52,721
Duh!

109
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:56,350
Ha! Just as I thought.
You're not Lem.

110
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,311
You're an alien zombie,
like in Humaniacs II.

111
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,147
Skiff, I'm not
a zombie.

112
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,108
Yeah, that's what you
zombies are programmed to say.

113
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,277
Tell me something the
real Lem would know.

114
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,988
Well, I know Skiff
is the only nutcase

115
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:13,242
who thinks the government is
hiding all alien evidence in Base 9.

116
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,705
And you give candy to your
puppy so he'll poop jelly beans.

117
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,749
It was just an experiment.

118
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,085
With all due respect,

119
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,505
I've put in the hours and done
a lot of alien research at work.

120
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,007
What are
you talking about?

121
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,758
You work in a
comic book store!

122
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,053
The greatest source
of scientific knowledge.

123
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,515
Skiff, time to unpack
the fake alien poop.

124
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,725
Right away,
Mr. Haglug.

125
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:42,396
You will believe me, Lem, when
aliens put you on the takeout menu.

126
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,357
Wow!
Skiff!

127
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,860
I love
fake-alien-poop day.

128
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:54,742
So, um, Eckle, do you
think your sister's home?

129
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,203
Why?
I thought maybe...

130
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,330
I thought I might
tell her I got the job.

131
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,372
Why?

132
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,041
Forget it.
You tell her for me. Okay?

133
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,211
Okay, but every time you
tell me to tell her something,

134
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,713
she asks why don't you
just tell her yourself?

135
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,716
What? And then my mom says
it's because you like her,

136
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,552
and then she says that,
"Oh, that's so cute,"

137
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,763
and why don't you just
ask her out already,

138
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,390
'cause she's been waiting
for you to ask her out

139
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,809
ever since we moved next door to you.

140
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,811
She has?

141
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,148
The girl of
my dreams likes me?

142
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,566
This is the best
day of my life.

143
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,152
Yeah, we got to see
that kid throw up.

144
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,408
Hey, he did it!
He got the job!

145
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,786
Oh, we're so
proud of you.

146
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,832
I hear it's just one easy step
up to Senior Assistant Curator.

147
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:50,047
# Oh, my love

148
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,759
# My darling

149
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:59,515
# I've hungered
for your touch #

150
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,560
Come on, soldier.
Take that hill.

151
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,897
Hey, Neera.

152
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,232
Hey, Lem.

153
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,151
I wanted to tell you,
I got the job.

154
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,320
Lem,
that's great!

155
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,613
Um...

156
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,740
Maybe it's time
that you and me...

157
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,866
Yes?

158
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,244
I mean, would
you want to...

159
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:26,834
Hey, Neera! I've been
looking all over for you.

160
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,294
You've
been looking for me?

161
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,504
The cause needs you.

162
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,131
The what?

163
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,215
The cause.

164
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,969
Glar's involved with something
he calls "protesting."

165
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,638
It's like when you shout about
stuff that makes you upset.

166
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,807
Yeah, like our
school pictures.

167
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,226
Why do they have
to be of our faces?

168
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,894
I mean,
what a bummer.

169
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,147
That means
it's not good.

170
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,858
Neera, we need you!
Righteous momma!

171
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,776
Oh, I'm so honored,

172
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,071
but Lem was about
to ask me something.

173
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,241
Yeah? Man, what do you want to ask her?

174
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,035
It's kind of
private.

175
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,037
No problemo, man!

176
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,539
I mean, I totally
respect that.

177
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,916
So, Neera...

178
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:12,296
# Neera and Lem had
a private conversation

179
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,591
# And don't want
anybody else around #

180
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,927
Uh, yeah, you know,
we can talk later.

181
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,679
Okay.

182
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,139
Peace.

183
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,849
That means,
"See you later."

184
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,443
Bye!

185
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,153
Bye.

186
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,951
Oh! "The cause, man."

187
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,913
I'd like to cause him
some pain.

188
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,209
I don't want to hear
a single bubble.

189
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,338
Especially you,
Bubbles.

190
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:16,276
# Be-bop-a-lula
I don't mean maybe

191
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:20,447
# Be-bop-a-lula
She's my baby

192
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:21,782
# Be-bop-a-lula... #

193
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,789
Mmm?

194
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,718
Call the General!
Call the General!

195
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,243
It's in the Containment Room.
Lock this section down, now!

196
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:18,148
Resistance is futile.
Surrender or die.

197
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,861
Come on, Eckle.
Go help your father.

198
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:26,323
# Mr. Sandman
Bring me a dream

199
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,495
Huh?

200
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,250
Mmm?

201
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,126
# Mr. Sandman... #

202
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,721
Oh!
Huh?

203
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,724
Mmm?

204
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,275
What the...

205
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,153
Duck?

206
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,339
Wow!

207
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,593
No! No! No! No! No!

208
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,269
Mom! Dad! There's
a ship in the...

209
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,006
Huh?

210
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,091
My car!

211
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:51,927
Whoa! Whoa!

212
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,182
Open wide or the big,
bad monster will get you.

213
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:43,103
The battle for
our world has begun.

214
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,063
Captain, mobilize
the army.

215
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,148
Yes, sir!

216
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,108
Right, men,
move it!

217
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,720
Are they hostile?
Will our species survive?

218
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,889
One thing we do know is

219
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:22,350
that they show no respect
for our parking laws.

220
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,311
And speaking of survival,

221
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,773
how will you survive
without a sparkling smile?

222
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,442
# Give your smile
that special glow

223
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,320
# Try the sparkle action
of Dental Pro #

224
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,371
You know, you're really
good as that toothbrush.

225
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,874
Yeah. But what I really
do best is a suppository.

226
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,759
Now, let's see.
Invasion by giant ants.

227
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,886
Invasion by sea monsters.

228
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,679
Invasion by
50-foot woman?

229
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,726
Ah! Here it is, So, You've
Been Invaded by Aliens.

230
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:13,944
Keep your eyes
on the aliens.

231
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,403
Aliens?

232
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,786
All right, class,
let's try it one more time.

233
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:26,081
The aliens
are coming!

234
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,253
Flarc, you were too slow.
Go join the zombies.

235
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,593
I called it.
The only question is,

236
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,513
should I be terrified because
it's the end of the world

237
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,681
or happy because

238
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,016
I totally called it?

239
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,978
Me, I have a plan.

240
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,647
They're gonna need
a native to run the mines.

241
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:55,026
I'll befriend them, show my
executive skills, and bam! I'm in.

242
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,487
Oh! Speaking
of "bam! I'm in..."

243
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,406
A cork?

244
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,409
It's your best defense against the
aliens' favorite form of research.

245
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,952
The probe.

246
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,872
You put it... Uh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

247
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,749
Yeah, yeah. I think I get
it. Oh, wait. This is yours.

248
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,376
I already used that one.

249
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,671
I just remembered,
my job.

250
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,924
Oh! Gotta go.
You know, my boss.

251
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:21,303
Your boss? No problem.
You guys can share.

252
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,186
Uh, Neera,
you have to choose.

253
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,189
It's either me or Glar.

254
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,776
Oh, Lem, there's no question.

255
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,028
It's you, of course.

256
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,094
Huh?

257
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,975
Come on! Come on! Come on!

258
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,810
Hello.
This is the alien hotline.

259
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,021
Yes. Hi.
I've found the alien.

260
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,358
They're here, and
no weapon can stop them.

261
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,776
You've got to be kidding.

262
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,007
Hello?
Yes, hello.

263
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,091
I've found the alien!

264
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,802
If you've spotted
an alien fleet, dial 1.

265
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,430
For pod people,
dial 2.

266
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,437
I can breathe!
I can breathe!

267
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,065
You speak my language.

268
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,444
That's amazing!
You speak my language.

269
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,280
Yeah. That's
what I just said.

270
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,241
You just said,
"That's what I just said."

271
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,911
Say something else. Like what?

272
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,413
"Like what."

273
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,415
They're gonna freak
back at Kennedy.

274
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:42,378
I'm Captain
Charles T. Baker, astronaut.

275
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,841
As-tro-nau-t.

276
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:49,135
Ass...

277
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,512
Tro-naut.

278
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,308
Lem.

279
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,938
Either your name is Lem,
or you want to mate with me.

280
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,358
Houston, we have
a little problem.

281
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,069
What do you want?

282
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,445
Thanks for asking.

283
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,614
Coffee, light,
two sugars.

284
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,491
Do you have any
Frappuccino up here?

285
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,284
Any puff pastry,
too. Thanks.

286
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,955
No, I mean are you here
to take over our world

287
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,250
and, like, eat our brains?

288
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,002
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Hold on.

289
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,463
What kind of
sick planet is this?

290
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,591
First of all, it's supposed
to be uninhabited, okay?

291
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:31,344
Not full of sea monkeys
dancing to the oldies.

292
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,305
My mission was to plant Old
Glory, whack a few golf balls

293
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,059
and head back to the Kids'
Choice Awards. I'm getting slimed.

294
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,479
What? You were just talking alien.

295
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,815
Hey, I'm not the
alien here. You are.

296
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,191
Me? You are.

297
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:46,317
No, you are.

298
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,403
You are. You...
You came to my planet.

299
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,448
An alien planet.
Hello!

300
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,242
Hello.
Not, "Hello."

301
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,578
"Hello!"
Hello... What?

302
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,662
What?
Huh?

303
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,997
Huh?
Huh?

304
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,583
Let's start over.

305
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,502
Look, there's a command module
in orbit right now.

306
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:05,628
It's running out of fuel.

307
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,798
It has to leave in 74 hours,
and if I'm not on it,

308
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:12,051
it goes back to Earth
without me. Capisce?

309
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,306
I have to get to my ship
and go back up in space.

310
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,641
Can you help me?

311
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,728
You want me to take you
to your flying saucer? No!

312
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,439
If they catch me helping you,
who knows what they'll do to me?

313
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,983
I'll lose everything. My
life was just getting perfect.

314
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,526
Kid...

315
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,195
You are a kid, right?

316
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,947
I mean, you're not like a
thousand-year-old Yoda or anything?

317
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,992
Never mind. Look, kid,
you're my only hope.

318
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,121
But I suppose you
could leave me stranded.

319
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,833
My wife will have
to support the kids.

320
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:48,713
Eleven. We have 11 kids,
always hungry. Yeah. Yeah.

321
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,840
But, hey, they'll get
by without a father.

322
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:53,051
The important thing here
is you avoid

323
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,802
A little trouble.

324
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,473
Alien hotline. What's
the nature of your sighting?

325
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,643
Hello?
Are you there?

326
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,189
Hello? Are you there?

327
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,157
Hey, fella.
Who wants a donut?

328
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,669
Silly dog!

329
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,192
There's your flying saucer. Now what?

330
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,780
Okay, here's the plan.

331
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,368
You knock out that cop,
then you overpower those two.

332
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,661
You neutralize that one

333
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,538
and handcuff the big guy
to the steering wheel.

334
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,291
That's your plan? What
if they start shooting?

335
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,043
You're one of their own. They'll
probably just aim for your legs.

336
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,128
My legs?

337
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,546
Don't your legs
grow back?

338
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,424
No! We're not
like your kind, okay?

339
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,219
I'll tell you what,
eat this.

340
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,512
You become invincible.

341
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,139
Oh, good.
Then you do it.

342
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:24,642
I can't be seen breaking the
law. I've got the right stuff.

343
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,769
The what?
The right stuff.

344
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,813
It means I have
a lot of courage.

345
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,106
Now go!

346
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,442
Go on! Go! Go! Go!

347
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,659
Hey, Lem,
something wrong?

348
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,915
Left flank.
Move it! Move it!

349
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,002
As you can see, the army
is taking positions,

350
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,338
just like in
The War of the Worlds,

351
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,716
getting ready for our
first close encounter

352
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,177
with invaders
from outer space.

353
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,361
Attention!

354
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,491
So they've come.

355
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,620
Captain!
Sir.

356
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,707
Have your men search
the flying saucer.

357
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,751
Yes, sir! Move!

358
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,795
Hazmat team, go!
Sir!

359
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:38,424
Now our brave soldiers are
entering the alien spaceship.

360
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,761
It doesn't look big enough
to be a space destroyer.

361
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,970
Ooh,
it's dark in here.

362
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,848
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, look!

363
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,893
No sign
of the pilot, sir.

364
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,657
Oops.

365
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,501
Are you getting...

366
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,679
I've never seen
such a heinous weapon.

367
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,765
We are up against
a cruel, sadistic enemy.

368
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:32,061
Seal off the town. I want
that alien pilot found.

369
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,356
I protest!

370
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:39,652
# They're bumming me out
with their bad vibrations

371
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,531
# Well, there's one thing you
gotta do Never mind, Captain.

372
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,741
The alien is right here. #
And that's stick it to the man

373
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,076
Grab him!
Yes, sir!

374
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,244
# Stick it to... #

375
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,912
Ow!
Glar's not the alien!

376
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,790
Oh, no? Then what
do you call this?

377
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,209
Hair.
He likes it long.

378
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,879
Very unusual.
You might even say,

379
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,839
very alien!

380
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:04,218
Excuse me! General! He
does go to the high school.

381
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:09,098
Glar's just trying to say
the aliens might be friendly.

382
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:16,731
Oh, Lem! Lem, you know astronomy.

383
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,109
If an alien
came all this way,

384
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,945
wouldn't it be smart
enough to come in peace?

385
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,155
Uh...

386
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,075
No! No! No!
No! No!

387
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:34,499
Uh...

388
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,544
I mean, they've come
to harvest our organs,

389
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,921
make us slaves.

390
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,422
Me?

391
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:45,301
We should all, all of us,
right now, go home and hide.

392
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:46,594
Huh?

393
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,138
That's a sensible
young man. Let him go.

394
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:53,935
And the rest of you, go to your
homes and wait for instructions.

395
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,982
Hi.

396
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,401
Go back to your homes. Show's over.

397
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,466
Okay,
come on, come on.

398
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,177
Hurry up.
Go! Go! Go! Go!

399
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,390
Great! Just great!

400
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,560
Look, I said I'd take you
to your flying saucer, okay?

401
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,312
Well, there it is.
Now, leave.

402
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,985
I'll get you a blanket
and a pillow for the night.

403
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,712
It's a miracle
I'm gonna need.

404
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,354
Mmm?

405
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:29,322
Oh, you... You like the
stone? You like the stone?

406
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,823
Go! Go! Go get it!

407
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,540
There it is! Stop!

408
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:01,562
Don't move! # I'm gonna
tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John

409
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,315
# He said he has the music
but he got a lot of fun

410
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,608
# Oh, baby

411
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,277
# Yeah, baby

412
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:10,738
# Whoo, baby

413
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,907
# I'm having me
some fun tonight

414
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,036
# Well, long, tall Sally
She's built for speed

415
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,830
# She got everything
that Uncle John need

416
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,332
# Oh, baby

417
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,168
# Yeah, baby

418
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,462
# Whoo, baby

419
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,298
# I'm having me
some fun tonight #

420
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:43,562
Aliens are quite like us, except
they have two sets of teeth,

421
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:48,442
hypodermic fingertips and
hypnotic eyes to control our brains

422
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:52,238
and turn us into an army of
zombies and destroy our world.

423
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,364
What?

424
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,325
Remember, anyone
caught helping the aliens

425
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,120
will go to jail.
Jail?

426
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,039
This is great!

427
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,667
Yesterday,
my life was perfect,

428
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:09,338
and now, I'm the most wanted
super-criminal in the world.

429
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,924
At least you have a world.

430
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,261
I'll probably
never see mine again.

431
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,379
Our preliminary procedures
have been completed, sir.

432
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:52,006
The spacecraft
is quarantined.

433
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,676
We're looking for a place for
your headquarters, sir, and...

434
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,220
Still no trace
of the alien, sir.

435
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:01,182
Where would you hide
if you were an alien?

436
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,517
Hide?
Bravo, General.

437
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,479
An alien invader
spends over $500

438
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,105
to fly across
the universe

439
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,190
to hide.

440
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:13,778
You clown! He's here
to take over our minds!

441
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,238
Even yours!

442
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,115
Diabolical!

443
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,284
Captain, place me
under arrest.

444
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,245
Not so fast, General. I've
trained my superior intellect

445
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,790
to recognize
alien mind slaves.

446
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,961
You're clean.

447
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:35,174
But, uh, he's a zombie,
and those two.

448
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,303
How will we know
who is a zombie?

449
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,139
Well, zombies don't
feel any pain.

450
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,561
You're clean.
You, too.

451
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:52,733
General, you must capture the
alien alive and bring it to me.

452
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:56,904
I will unlock the secrets
of its marvelous brain.

453
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:01,075
Captain, search the town.
Go door to door if you must,

454
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,118
but find that alien.

455
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:18,092
Ha, ha! Hello, Plark,
if that really is you.

456
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,302
Have a nice day,
Serbok,

457
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,513
or should I call you
by your alien name?

458
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,269
It's you.
It's you!

459
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:29,645
It's you!

460
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,689
How come I have to
go to the dentist

461
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,108
if it's the end
of the world, Mom?

462
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,360
Invasion or not,
you've got to go.

463
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,195
My mom's a zombie! Help!

464
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
Huh?
Huh?

465
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,869
Zombie!

466
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:59,550
Mmm-hmm. Okay, right, so, this is
the last street we're gonna do today.

467
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,317
Okay,
let's start at this end.

468
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,193
Wait. I think
I'm a zombie.

469
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:22,448
I'm hearing an irritating, piercing
voice in the back of my head.

470
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,782
Oh, shut up.
It's me.

471
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,993
It's there again!
It's me, you moron.

472
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,129
Hey, what's that?

473
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,053
Hey, look.

474
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,349
That's funny!

475
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:55,189
Look at it! Look at the dog!

476
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,858
Mom?

477
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,863
Mom? Mom!
Don't come in!

478
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,582
Rover? Boy, am I glad
to see you! Rover!

479
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,543
Rover?

480
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,339
He's a probe we sent to
take pictures of your world.

481
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,217
Hey! A planet
full of aliens,

482
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,344
and you sent back
pictures of rocks?

483
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,721
Bad boy! Bad boy.

484
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,141
Mom, don't come in!

485
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,559
The alien!

486
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,980
Whoa! Can I get
your autograph?

487
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,816
Eckle, this isn't a comic
book, okay? It's serious.

488
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,735
I don't mind. It comes
with being a national hero.

489
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:48,826
And... And my
Humaniacs poster?

490
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,287
And my...
And my chest?

491
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,831
Mmm. Uh...

492
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,125
Hey,
how about a snapshot?

493
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,292
Get one of me looking up at the stars.

494
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,419
Mom!

495
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:03,590
I saw the alien
last night. I am so in.

496
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,677
I got this guy wrapped
around my little finger.

497
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,138
Let me tell you,
this alien's not so scary.

498
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,684
Uh...

499
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,520
Your personal chef
reporting for duty, sir.

500
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,231
May I give you some tasty
suggestions for tonight?

501
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,526
I've got a list of the
fattest teachers in my school

502
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,278
in case you're looking
for a light snack.

503
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:28,157
Skiff, stop. He's not here to
eat us or anything. He's harmless

504
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,575
to everyone
but me.

505
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,618
Better let me
do the talking.

506
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,370
I think he's eyeing you for dessert.

507
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,124
Aw!

508
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,209
It's kind of cute,
the way he does that.

509
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:43,047
Oh, great. Let's
just have a party!

510
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,801
We're doing a routine
search for the alien.

511
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,096
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot.

512
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,224
It's trying to
control our minds.

513
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:55,392
What do we do?

514
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:56,769
Don't look
in its eyes.

515
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,645
That's how they
take over your brain.

516
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,899
Brains? That's right, brains!

517
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,986
You are my zombie slaves.

518
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:10,074
I want to control your
brains. It's inside my head!

519
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,743
Ooh! Its will is too strong!

520
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,747
Ooh!

521
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,834
# Hey, Macarena #

522
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,088
Command us, Master.

523
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,216
Command me, too.

524
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,592
It's not real.

525
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,136
I think I know when I'm
being mind-controlled.

526
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:34,431
Hey, maybe they
could get me on my ship.

527
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,895
I'm leaning toward
"probably not."

528
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,525
...an extensive search.

529
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,777
But I think I know who can. In
the meantime at the landing site,

530
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,906
just to the left of me here, everything
is checked and double-checked.

531
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,575
The High Command taking
control of the situation...

532
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,954
You want our home
for your headquarters?

533
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,499
Gee, that would be
a great honor.

534
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,710
Honey, tell Lem
we have guests.

535
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,881
Lem, there's someone you'd like to...

536
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,049
Oh!

537
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,851
Check the papers.

538
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,561
Kiss the ship
goodbye, Rover.

539
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,818
You really think
you can get me on TV?

540
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,988
You're the biggest
story in history.

541
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,656
The whole planet
will watch.

542
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,450
The whole planet?
Interesting.

543
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,745
I left my hair products on the
ship, but I could improvise.

544
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:42,457
You know, astronauts have to
deal with any kind of emergency.

545
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,627
I get it. He can tell
everyone he's peaceful.

546
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:48,505
All we need is a safe
place, that TV reporter,

547
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,465
and then we can all
get on with our lives.

548
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,510
Skiff, the comic book
store, let's go there.

549
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:57,723
Okay, but if he's not housebroken,
you're cleaning up his mess.

550
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,267
We need a slogan,
like something that says,

551
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:05,230
"It's a bummer to make war on the
aliens when we should make..." Uh...

552
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,525
Hey, Neera! Hi! Hi!

553
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:12,404
Kill any aliens, Lem? Kill any...
Oh, no, you don't understand.

554
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,947
These soldiers aren't...

555
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,491
Oh, great! This day
gets better and better.

556
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,043
General Grawl, you better
take a look at this.

557
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:32,549
Professor, take a look.

558
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:33,842
Hmm.

559
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:36,929
This is obviously
alien writing.

560
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,101
It says,
"Surrender or die,"

561
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:47,439
and this is a list
of surrender terms.

562
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,983
Diabolical.

563
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,445
What are you doing
in Lem's room?

564
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,949
I'm afraid your son
is a zombie.

565
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,372
Hey, kid,
what's bugging you?

566
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:04,456
Neera.

567
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,250
What is that,
like an alien hernia?

568
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,918
Well, sort of.

569
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:12,756
It's the girl of my dreams,
and now she hates me.

570
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,925
Whoa! Hate's
a strong word.

571
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,261
Maybe she just
dislikes you.

572
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,681
Plus, there's
another guy, Glar.

573
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,849
Okay. You know
your problem?

574
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:26,603
It's not Glar or Neera.
It's Lem.

575
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,523
Look at you.
You're so left-brain.

576
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,566
Or is it right brain?
Whatever.

577
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:35,112
You're like the chief of
control. You've got to loosen up.

578
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:38,532
We've got a little time.
You, my friend, are in luck.

579
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,159
The doctor is in.

580
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,622
Me and green bean
need to talk.

581
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:53,338
Before we begin,
I have a technical question.

582
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:56,717
Are you considered
very ugly on this planet?

583
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,593
What?
Because I can't tell.

584
00:43:58,678 --> 00:43:59,720
No.

585
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,722
I mean, I'm okay.

586
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,390
Oh, good. Good.

587
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,811
Why do chicks dig me?

588
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,398
Because I'm handsome?
Because I'm an astronaut?

589
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:15,277
Yes, and yes.

590
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:19,573
But it's also because of Chuck
Baker's three steps to romance.

591
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,491
Spot your prey.

592
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,035
Make your move.

593
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,953
Show no mercy.

594
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,081
Hey, baby.

595
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,044
I saw you
across the bar.

596
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:34,880
Are sparks flying
or is this place

597
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:36,548
on fire?

598
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,216
Uh...

599
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:39,509
You're sure you're
not ugly, right?

600
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:40,677
I think so.

601
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:44,556
Baby, tomorrow I go up in
space, maybe never to return.

602
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,520
Let's make our last night a night

603
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,731
To remember.

604
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,984
Lem! The cork!

605
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,779
The cork!
Remember the plan!

606
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,533
The only plan here
is to get Chuck on TV.

607
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,704
I'll be right back with the
reporter. I'm leaving you in charge.

608
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,289
In charge?

609
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,793
You heard him.

610
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,212
Things are going to be
different around here.

611
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:17,047
My wish is
your command.

612
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,636
Come on, boys, let's
track down this story.

613
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,764
We need an alien
for the 6:00 news.

614
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,643
Wait! Stop! Hey! Uh...

615
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,397
We're really upset!
Yeah.

616
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,899
Upset we really are!
Yeah.

617
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,193
Are we upset, really?

618
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,988
Neera! I need
to talk to you.

619
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,616
Oh. I thought you were
after the alien.

620
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,284
That's not
what's going on.

621
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,744
Then what is?

622
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,121
I...
# Lem!

623
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:51,748
# Mysterious Lem

624
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:56,253
# Tell us the secrets
of your heart #

625
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,338
Uh...

626
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,257
I can't say.

627
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,927
Lem, I always thought we'd be together,

628
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,722
but I need someone who doesn't
always believe what he's been told.

629
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,518
It's like Glar says,
"The times,

630
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,604
"they are a-different."

631
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,606
Maybe you should go.

632
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:22,154
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh #

633
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,867
Hey, baby.
What?

634
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,827
Is this place sparking

635
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:33,874
or is fire making this
a night to show no mercy?

636
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:37,169
Did I happen to mention
I'm not ugly?

637
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:38,753
Whoa!

638
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,380
Are you crazy?

639
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,133
Whoa!

640
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:50,891
Hey, is this guy
giving you bad vibrations?

641
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,101
Lem was just leaving.

642
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,064
I'm hungry, guys.

643
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:06,239
Are you kidding me?

644
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:09,117
If you have to do a number
one, use these papers.

645
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:11,912
If you have to do a
number two, go outside.

646
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,872
And, if it's
number three,

647
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:15,790
I can't help you.

648
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:20,879
Got you, alien!
Victory or extinction!

649
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:26,176
Oh, yeah? In space,
no one can hear you scream!

650
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,386
You missed!

651
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,516
Crush, kill, destroy.
Bang, bang! Ha, ha!

652
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,602
Hey, Master! We want
to be destroyed, too!

653
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,524
Quick,
cover the camera!

654
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,026
If it gets damaged again,
we'll have to pay for it.

655
00:47:56,374 --> 00:48:00,377
You're afraid of a widdle
storm. It's nothing. You see?

656
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:07,801
Rover!

657
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:21,314
Rover!

658
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:26,236
Sit, Rover! Sit! Stop! Heel!
Roll over! Come back! Listen...

659
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:32,033
You can't escape the tractor beam.
It's pulling you to your doom!

660
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:42,210
6:00 news,
here we go.

661
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,886
...going on a journey.
Huh?

662
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:57,892
Soon, we will crush the rebel
alliance and control the galaxy.

663
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,980
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

664
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:06,276
You are a rebel spy
and a traitor to the Empire.

665
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,445
Take her away.

666
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:09,738
Skiff!

667
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:16,536
Hasta la vista, baby.
You are terminated.

668
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:20,040
General, over there.
Aren't those comic books?

669
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,667
Captain, get your men!

670
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:25,795
We gotta get
out of here now!

671
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:31,885
Move it! Move it!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

672
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,554
Chuck, come on!

673
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,975
Sorry, pal. Too dangerous. But...

674
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,226
Out!

675
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,146
You there! Stop!

676
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,653
Don't lose him, sir!

677
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,238
Wow!

678
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,458
Don't you ever
run off like that.

679
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:07,170
What if they took you to the
pound? How would I find you?

680
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,254
Whoa!

681
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,256
Lem?

682
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,053
Oh, boy!

683
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,607
We'd better run!

684
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,112
Let's move!

685
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,243
Move! Move!
Move! Move! Move!

686
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,580
Move it!
Move it! Move it! Go!

687
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,381
Let the doctor
handle this.

688
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:56,052
Ladies, who wants to meet an astronaut?

689
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:01,057
Ow! Ladies! One at a time! Chuck!

690
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,184
I'm on Facebook!

691
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:14,320
Ready?

692
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,994
Look out!
The monster!

693
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:27,459
It's getting away!

694
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,758
Got you!
Rover? No!

695
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,096
Quick,
hotwire the car!

696
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:41,431
What?
Hotwire the who?

697
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,892
When are you green goobers
going to evolve?

698
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,129
Attention, all personnel.

699
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:14,839
What's the matter?

700
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,133
Why did he do it?

701
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:21,346
I was gonna teach him
to beg and everything.

702
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:28,478
Amazing! The alien's
brain is so powerful,

703
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,105
it's controlling them
even now.

704
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,483
What is it
telling you to do?

705
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:38,446
Um, I think I'm supposed to
dig a hive for the alien queen.

706
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:40,990
Yeah. I'm supposed
to blow up things.

707
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:42,700
I mean, unless you
need help with the hive.

708
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:43,827
Oh, no, I'm good.

709
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,161
You sure?
I'm good.

710
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:46,955
Never mind them,
Professor.

711
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,708
This thing has
all the answers.

712
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:55,171
Where's your master? Talk!

713
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:02,387
The flying saucer is going
to an undisclosed location

714
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:04,681
to be taken
apart and studied.

715
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:09,102
This reporter is now going to
reveal to you where that location is.

716
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,231
Uh, this reporter has just
been told that if I do that,

717
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,191
I will be taken apart
and studied.

718
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,620
Oh, look. That's perfect. That's great.

719
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:30,248
Oh, just great!
Perfect!

720
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:33,960
John Glenn goes around the
world, he's a senator for life.

721
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,254
I went across
the fricking universe!

722
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,381
I should be governor,
minimum!

723
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:42,635
But, no, I'm marooned
here on this stupid rock!

724
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:47,974
Uh...

725
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,727
This stupid rock
is my home,

726
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:54,439
or it was until you came
along and ruined everything!

727
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:57,358
I want my life back,
unless, I don't know,

728
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,569
maybe there's something
else you want to ruin.

729
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,154
Who's that?

730
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,324
My boss.

731
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:11,748
Sorry, Mr. Hucklo. It's
just for one little night.

732
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,166
Maybe a week.

733
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,877
I really hope this doesn't
affect our working relationship.

734
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:20,673
Huh?

735
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:27,931
Oh, great!
Just great! Fired.

736
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:31,184
Say, why don't you
just harvest my organs

737
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,644
and get it over with?

738
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:42,654
Oh, great. Now look what you
did. You made him really upset.

739
00:54:45,324 --> 00:55:01,381
Lem?

740
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,557
You're looking
right at my home.

741
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:14,978
See that star,
the little red one?

742
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:18,481
Circling that star is
a planet called Earth.

743
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:22,443
It's about 20 billion
miles away, give or take.

744
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:24,195
There's no way
space is that big.

745
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,322
What?
Are you kidding?

746
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,075
There's billions
of galaxies,

747
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:31,869
and each galaxy has
billions of stars.

748
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:37,583
Next to that, kid, our planets
are just dust in the wind.

749
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,879
So, nothing
I knew was right?

750
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,675
Come on.
You knew about Neera.

751
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:47,802
I mean, look at her.

752
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:51,597
Lose the antennae, get some
plastic surgery, she's a hottie.

753
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:54,684
I don't have the right stuff, like you.

754
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:00,023
Kid...

755
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,736
I never had
the right stuff.

756
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:10,992
I'm a button pusher,
Spam in a can.

757
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,288
I don't even fly the ship.
It's all automatic.

758
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:20,293
I only got this far on charm
and my rugged good looks.

759
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:26,340
You risked everything to help
a stranger from another world.

760
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,761
You're the one
with the right stuff.

761
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,057
Get out of here.

762
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,145
Finally! We've been
looking for you!

763
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:40,772
Guys!

764
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:44,400
Great hiding spot.
I call the closet.

765
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:47,403
No way! Let's go
fight the army.

766
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:48,988
How's your species
at hiding?

767
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:51,032
Can you change your
skin to this color?

768
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:55,161
Your call, Captain Baker. What's
it going to be, fight or hide?

769
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,330
Neither.

770
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:59,665
I think Lem's saying
he wants the closet.

771
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,709
I'll tell you what
it's going to be.

772
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:04,337
We're gonna go get
Chuck back to his ship.

773
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,422
Skiff, you were right
about Base 9.

774
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:07,799
That's where
they have his ship.

775
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:10,051
But we don't
know where it is.

776
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,385
Yes, we do.

777
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:15,723
Rover found me. He's also
programmed to find my ship.

778
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,725
Wait,
where is Rover?

779
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,355
It's too painful
to talk about.

780
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,190
It's okay.

781
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,442
They've got him at
the comic book shop.

782
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,319
Well, then, we've got to go get him.

783
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,490
Hold on. The whole army's
looking for you two.

784
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,450
You can't just
stroll through town.

785
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,997
Wait, wait, that new movie,
doesn't that open tonight?

786
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,625
Yeah. Why?

787
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:59,183
The citizens of Glipforg are
undaunted by alien invaders

788
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:02,270
and are bravely going about
their normal routines.

789
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,272
Ow!
Got you!

790
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,442
There's the comic book store. Let's go.

791
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,331
What great
costumes!

792
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:25,418
You two are finalists.
Up on stage.

793
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,337
Oh, uh, we're not here
to enter the contest.

794
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,090
Then why are you
dressed like aliens?

795
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,801
Uh, we're here

796
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:36,053
to win
the contest.

797
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,347
What?
Yeah, good.

798
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:40,057
Trust me. Trust me.

799
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:46,189
Mmm-hmm.

800
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,404
Private,
come here.

801
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:03,998
Hold your fire, soldier.

802
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,292
Take us to your leader.

803
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:12,089
Welcome to the Humaniacs
III Costume Contest.

804
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:23,601
We're really upset!
We're really upset!

805
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:26,270
Let's hear it
for the finalists.

806
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:29,357
What are we
supposed to do?

807
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:32,652
Give them their daily
minimum dose of Chuck.

808
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:35,279
Hello, Humaniacs!

809
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:48,417
#... overhead lifters and
four-barrel carbs Oh, yeah

810
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:50,878
# Greased Lightning
Go, Greased Lightning

811
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,131
# A fuel-injection cut-off
and chrome-plated rods Oh, yeah

812
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:56,425
# Greased Lightning
Go, Greased Lightning

813
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,678
Come on, Lem!

814
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,098
# You know you'll be a hit
When you get right into it

815
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:04,392
# Greased Lightning

816
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:08,604
# Go, Greased Lightning You're
burning up the quarter mile

817
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,064
# Greased Lightning
Go, Greased Lightning

818
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,274
Look at me.
Watch this.

819
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,610
# Go, Greased Lightning You 're
coasting through the heat lap trial

820
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:16,487
# Greased Lightning
Go, Greased Lightning

821
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,614
# You are supreme
You're such a dream

822
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:19,824
Yeah! That's it!

823
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:21,909
# Greased Lightning

824
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,496
# Oh, yeah! Bust a
move, green machine.

825
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:27,540
# Greased Lightning, go!

826
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:31,877
# Go, go, go
Greased Lightning

827
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:34,922
# You are supreme

828
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:36,382
# You're such a dream

829
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:42,805
# Greased Lightning #

830
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,724
All right!

831
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,108
The alien!

832
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,830
Lem!

833
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:10,249
Over here!

834
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,376
There he is!

835
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,510
All of these costumes! Sir,
how do we find the alien?

836
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:24,430
Simple, Captain. Like us,
the alien is in uniform.

837
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,308
Grab him!

838
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,352
I got you!

839
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:30,603
Chuck!

840
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,855
No! No! Get off!

841
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,442
Okay,
keep back.

842
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:44,700
Move.

843
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:54,960
Time to meet the monster face to face.

844
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:04,053
Look at it, Professor.
It's hideous.

845
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:06,180
And that smell...

846
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,392
Hey, you try wearing the
same suit for three weeks.

847
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:14,063
What a remarkable brain
you must have.

848
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:17,149
An incision here and here,

849
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:18,984
it should pop right out.

850
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:20,861
Huh?

851
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:25,324
No! You're making a
mistake! He's friendly!

852
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,244
Oh! This poor boy's
obviously a zombie.

853
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,662
I'll remove
his brain, too.

854
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:44,135
Ooh!

855
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,179
You are no longer
needed, slave.

856
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:51,684
I release you. Return
to your puny life.

857
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,854
Kid, I'm going down anyway.

858
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:58,441
There's no need
for you to come with me.

859
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:01,569
Thanks for everything.

860
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,073
How about it,
Professor?

861
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:07,158
Hmm.

862
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:09,285
Difficult to tell.

863
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,205
Do you still believe
the alien is friendly?

864
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:19,378
No.

865
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,672
This boy is free!

866
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:27,678
Oh, Lem! We're so glad
you're not a zombie!

867
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,556
What about
the alien spawn, sir?

868
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:34,435
I want it destroyed, one
little piece at a time.

869
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:43,319
All right, let's get
these aliens to Base 9!

870
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,281
Not that it exists.

871
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,583
Move it!

872
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:00,920
Go on.

873
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,422
Get in!

874
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,609
We're here to honor
a young man who survived

875
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:27,738
a harrowing ordeal at the
hands of the alien monster.

876
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,907
Lem, come on out!

877
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:32,576
Son?

878
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:42,878
Lem, I understand you'll be working
right here after you graduate,

879
01:04:42,963 --> 01:04:45,673
teaching about
the mysteries of space.

880
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:48,133
Give us a preview
of what we'll learn.

881
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:55,891
Well, we know everything
about our universe.

882
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:57,977
It's 500 miles long

883
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,271
500 miles!

884
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:05,693
Remarkable!
I can't.

885
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:08,612
Space isn't 500 miles.

886
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:13,367
It's not. It's so much
bigger than we can imagine.

887
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:15,911
There's billions
of galaxies,

888
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:18,539
and each galaxy has
billions of stars,

889
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,749
and next to that,
our planet is just...

890
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,045
Excuse me.

891
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,811
Lem?

892
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,564
I know I was
kind of harsh.

893
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,358
I'm really sorry.

894
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:48,944
Ouch!

895
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:50,613
Oh, hi, Neera.

896
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,239
What are you doing?

897
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:53,782
It's called hotwiring.

898
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,618
It's how they
start cars on Earth.

899
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:59,663
Lem, um,
I was thinking...

900
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:03,709
Well, you know, now
that this is all over...

901
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:04,960
Yeah, Neera?

902
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:06,712
Maybe we could...

903
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:13,052
Lem, you left
everyone hanging!

904
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,512
I'm going to
go find Chuck.

905
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:18,474
But how? It's impossible without Rover!

906
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,643
My little Rovie.

907
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:26,357
I can still hear
his wagging little antenna.

908
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:27,983
Rover?

909
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:29,234
Rover!

910
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,115
Rover! Rover!

911
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,575
You're alive!

912
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,327
But how did you get out?

913
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,750
Good going, boy!

914
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,461
Rover, Rover, can you
find Chuck? Where's Chuck?

915
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:04,395
You're going with me?

916
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:05,521
Mmm-hmm.

917
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,482
All right!

918
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,333
Thought you could
take over our world?

919
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:28,210
Your kind knows
no decency.

920
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:30,671
You mean
chick magnets?

921
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,048
No, aliens.

922
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,759
Tell us your
invasion plans!

923
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:38,595
And don't bother
taking over my mind.

924
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,807
If you do, Captain Kisno
has orders to shoot me.

925
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:43,892
If you take over
Captain Kisno's mind,

926
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,103
Lieutenant Groit has
orders to shoot him.

927
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,688
If you take over
Lieutenant Groit's mind,

928
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:51,233
Sergeant York will shoot Captain
Kisno, Lieutenant Groit and myself,

929
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,068
along with these
three soldiers.

930
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:55,779
Each man has a designated
target in the squad.

931
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:58,449
Should you succeed in
taking over all our minds,

932
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:01,618
Corporal Hisk has orders
to electrocute everyone.

933
01:08:02,454 --> 01:08:07,750
If this fails, the entire base is
rigged to blow at the touch of a button.

934
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:11,003
Uh, General, sir? Am I supposed
to shoot Hecknavar or Kolski?

935
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,338
I shoot Kolski.
No. You shoot Meckavoy.

936
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:14,673
Well, then who
shoots Kolski?

937
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:15,966
I can shoot myself.

938
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,595
That won't be necessary. Hecknavar,
you shoot Kolski, Captain Kisno

939
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,263
and graze
Corporal Hisk.

940
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,639
Yes, sir!
Ow!

941
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:23,974
Not yet!

942
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,769
Drop your weapon!
You.

943
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:27,853
No! You first.

944
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,104
You're mine,
Hecknavar!

945
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,190
I'm not taking my eyes off
Kisno. Drop it, dirtbag!

946
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:36,153
Oops!

947
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:44,536
Hold your fire!

948
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:58,383
Hold your fire!

949
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:04,723
Captain Kisno,
get everyone out of here.

950
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:09,478
You're not thinking all
this is my fault, right?

951
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,980
All right,
if you won't tell us,

952
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:15,108
there's another way to unlock
the secrets of your brain.

953
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:17,027
Professor Kipple!

954
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:20,906
He's all yours.

955
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,318
He thinks
we've found him.

956
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:06,118
Hang on, Chuck.
We'll find you.

957
01:10:17,589 --> 01:10:21,091
Ah! There you are. I was
just warming up for you.

958
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,845
Ah! Now, we'll have that
brain out in no time.

959
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,389
You don't want my brain.
It's useless.

960
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:32,185
I spent four years at a party
school. Trust me, it's mush.

961
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,692
Hello?
Anyone here?

962
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:45,157
Skiff, what are
you doing?

963
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,993
Oh, come on.
No one's around.

964
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:50,078
I'm not going to
get caught.

965
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,597
Hey! Look, look, look.
I'm paying! I'm paying!

966
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:28,116
The thing with the...

967
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:31,328
I mean, it just
went over the...

968
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,288
Wow!

969
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:00,941
Base 9.

970
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:04,736
This is amazing!
I was right again!

971
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:12,160
How do we get in
without being seen?

972
01:12:17,709 --> 01:12:19,376
Huh?

973
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:30,887
# Well, I tried to get along
Tried to play along happily

974
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:35,600
# But I'm sorry, Officer
Your rules ain't no good for me

975
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,688
# There's one thing
you've got to do

976
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,189
# And that's
stick it to the man

977
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,692
# Stick it to the
Stick it to the...

978
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,402
# Stick it to... #

979
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:48,989
Ow! Ooh! Ah!

980
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,115
Now!

981
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,578
Cool.

982
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,710
I don't suppose your
planet's invented painkillers?

983
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:53,678
Yeah! Good work, Rover!

984
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:04,189
Guys! This is
so Luke Skywalker!

985
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:08,318
Uh, by the way, you're not
brother and sister, right?

986
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:09,861
How much time
is left?

987
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,780
Just enough.

988
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:14,324
Rover here will take us
right to my ship.

989
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,204
That's a funny place
for his antenna.

990
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:24,126
Captain, I want the
whole base on red alert!

991
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,585
Yes, sir!

992
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:28,004
General, you must
save its brain!

993
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:30,882
I'm more concerned
with saving a world.

994
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:57,784
That professor's
a genius.

995
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:01,496
I feel
positively effervescent.

996
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:04,249
In fine fettle. What a
salubrious experience!

997
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,459
Well said.
Cheers!

998
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:22,267
Huh?

999
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,447
My ship!

1000
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,032
Way to go, kid!

1001
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:47,000
Step away
from the flying saucer!

1002
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:50,295
And put your
hands in the air.

1003
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,145
There was never
a chance you'd get away.

1004
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:15,278
You'd destroy the whole
base just to get me?

1005
01:16:15,363 --> 01:16:16,821
That is sick!

1006
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:18,448
Actually, it's
kind of flattering.

1007
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:19,658
Sick?

1008
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:22,535
Sick, young lady, is helping
the enemy of your world.

1009
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:25,664
Sick is befriending a
creature that's so completely

1010
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:27,666
different.

1011
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,042
Sick is...

1012
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:31,378
Well, look, it's right
in front of you!

1013
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:35,131
I'm sorry, Professor.
It's too dangerous

1014
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:37,342
to let the alien
live another minute.

1015
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,847
Wait! Wait! Wait! Stop!

1016
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:46,685
General, I know
what you're afraid of,

1017
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:48,979
and it's not Chuck.

1018
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:52,232
It's not monsters
or aliens.

1019
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,901
It's the unknown.

1020
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,571
I've spent my whole life
running from it,

1021
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:01,741
and I think
maybe you have, too,

1022
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:07,205
but I'm telling you, the unknown
isn't something to be afraid of.

1023
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:09,749
It can be
your best friend.

1024
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:14,045
And just when you think that it
means the end of everything you know,

1025
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:17,132
it's really
just the beginning.

1026
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:23,555
Base destruct, two minutes.

1027
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:26,891
What are you
looking at? Run!

1028
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,401
Take that!

1029
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:46,995
Everyone on board!
Let's go!

1030
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:51,750
Attention, all personnel.
Evacuate base immediately.

1031
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:00,675
What are you doing?

1032
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,177
I can't leave him here.

1033
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:04,429
Why not?

1034
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,014
Because he's got
the right stuff.

1035
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:33,291
Base destruct, 60 seconds.

1036
01:18:40,508 --> 01:18:41,841
There's no time
for autopilot.

1037
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:43,051
What's the matter now?

1038
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:46,346
I'm going to have
to pilot this bucket.

1039
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,701
Base destruct in 15 seconds.

1040
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:11,496
She is so heavy!

1041
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:18,420
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

1042
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:25,343
five, four, three, two, one.

1043
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:33,601
Yeah!

1044
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,085
You guys should
check this out.

1045
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,178
Whoa.

1046
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:22,609
Whoa.

1047
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:26,905
Hey, what
do you think?

1048
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:29,365
Such a big universe.

1049
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:32,368
I am definitely
coming back here.

1050
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:46,591
Am I a zombie now?

1051
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,221
This guy reads
too many comic books.

1052
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:58,102
Hey, Neera,

1053
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:00,730
um, now that
this is all over,

1054
01:21:02,066 --> 01:21:03,399
would you want to... Yes.

1055
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,110
But you didn't hear
what I was gonna...

1056
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:14,035
Gross!

1057
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:20,458
Strap in, everyone,
'cause I'm taking you home.

1058
01:21:58,664 --> 01:21:59,789
Hey, it's Lem!

1059
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:05,003
Hi!

1060
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:07,839
The General, too.

1061
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:10,008
The monster!

1062
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,511
It's all right, Chief.
He's with me.

1063
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:16,389
Soldiers,
attention!

1064
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:17,974
There is among us

1065
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:19,892
an astronaut.

1066
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:28,526
Captain, thanks for
coming back for me.

1067
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:30,570
A pleasure, General.

1068
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,780
Maybe next time
you have guests

1069
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:33,990
you'll throw
a better party.

1070
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:41,039
Kid, how would you
like to be president

1071
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:45,335
of the local Chuck Baker,
Party Maker Fan Club?

1072
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:48,212
Oh, yeah!

1073
01:22:48,339 --> 01:22:50,715
Oh, can I join?

1074
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:52,258
Be a good boy,

1075
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,345
And don't forget
to drink your oil.

1076
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,808
Rover, you coming?

1077
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:03,436
Or do you want
to stay here?

1078
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:10,318
Rover! My
little bitty boy!

1079
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:20,745
Lem,

1080
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:23,331
you saved my life.

1081
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:26,542
You saved mine, too.

1082
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:34,008
That was a, uh,
man hug, just then.

1083
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:35,635
It's very big
on my planet.

1084
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:37,345
Mmm?

1085
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:39,263
Hey, take care
of this guy, okay?

1086
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:51,234
You're a great planet,
and your '50s are fine,

1087
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:53,695
but give me a call
when you get to the '60s,

1088
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,364
'cause that's gonna be fun.

1089

01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:01,656
# Stick it to the
Stick it to the man

1110
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:04,116
# I don't want to protest
on my own

1111
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:11,499
# Stick it to the
Stick it to the man

1112
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:26,222
Doc, that brain
operation was inspired.

1113
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:29,600
You simply must try it.

1114
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:33,521
No, no, no, no!
No! No, no.

1115
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:36,399
# Stick it to the
Stick it to the man

1116
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:38,860
# Stick it to the
Stick it to the man #

1117
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:40,945
Oh, no, no, boy.
Easy, easy.

1118
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,029
Not the tongue.
Not the...

1119
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:48,202
This is gonna be
a long trip.

1120
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:01,299
# Well, I tried
to save the world

1121
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:04,802
# But we ran out
of words to say

1122
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:08,306
# So instead I write this song

1123
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:11,809
# With a guitar
full of chords to play

1124
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:16,147
# Well, I didn't really
write them anyway

1125
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:22,778
# Well I tried to build a boat
So I could sail myself away

1126
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:26,449
# But I ran out of wood

1127
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:29,827
# Left standing
on the harbor in the rain

1128
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:33,748
# Well, I'll only
get seasick anyway

1129
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:36,542
# Yeah, I'll only
get seasick anyway

1130
01:27:36,627 --> 01:27:40,796
# Who can it be
Knocking at my door?

1131
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:43,215
# I hope it ain't the man

1132
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:47,386
# Coming to start a war
against me

1133
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:08,366
# Who can it be
Knocking at my door?

1134
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:10,826
# I hope it ain't the man

1135
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:14,872
# Coming to start a war
against me

1136
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:18,459
# It's a sight
I never hope to
