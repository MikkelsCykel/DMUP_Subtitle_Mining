1
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,800
Hello?

2
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,040
Anyone here?

3
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,040
Hello.

4
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,880
Numbers...

5
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,640
where's the goddamn numbers?

6
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,000
There's something...

7
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,360
Oh shit.

8
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,200
I mean, they're my numbers...

9
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,840
Damn! Don't I at least
get a shot with my numbers,

10
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,400
you stupid fucks?!

11
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,880
I want a chance!

12
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
I want a chance like everyone else.

13
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh my God.

14
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,400
Oh, you bastards.

15
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,440
Our Father Which art in heaven,

16
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,440
hallowed be Thy name.

17
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,000
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

18
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,840
on earth as it is in heaven.

19
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,120
Give us this day our daily bread,

20
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,560
and forgive us our debts
as we forgive our debtors.

21
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,160
Lead us not into temptation...

22
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,200
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

23
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,640
For Thine...

24
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,680
is the kingdom...

25
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,800
and the power...

26
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,520
and the glory,
forever and ever.

27
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,560
Amen.

28
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,280
Hello?

29
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,560
Are you all right?

30
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,520
Can you hear me?

31
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,920
Are you hurt?

32
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,720
Don't move.
Don't make a sound.

33
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,880
I said, 'Don't move. '

34
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,960
Are you alone?

35
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,760
Blink once for yes,

36
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,800
twice for no.

37
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,680
Is there anyone else in the other room?

38
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,880
All right.

39
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,600
All right. I'm going to release you.

40
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,400
But I can take you down again,
as quick as the first time.

41
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,080
So don't scream, understand?

42
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,800
Once for yes,
twice for no.

43
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,280
Are you alone?

44
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,480
All right.

45
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,560
All right.

46
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,520
What the hell do you think you're doing?

47
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,000
How many rooms have you been in?

48
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,280
What is this place?

49
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,160
I don't know. You tell me,
how many rooms you've been in?

50
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,040
I don't know, five or six.
What about you?

51
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,200
Uh...
this is my third.

52
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,720
You sure you didn't see anyone else?

53
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,680
No.

54
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,880
Have you?

55
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,920
No.

56
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,880
So who are you?

57
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,640
Who are you?

58
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,040
What the fuck are those noises?

59
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,800
Relax. This is just for show.
Pretend that you're scared.

60
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,120
Should be easy.

61
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,160
All right. Get down here now,
or she's dead.

62
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,360
Some hero.

63
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,920
I have that effect on men.

64
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,200
Glad to see you haven't
lost your sense of humor.

65
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,920
- Is this really necessary?
- Just hang on.

66
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Isn't that the same...

67
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,080
Yes.

68
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,120
Hey!

69
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,080
Come back!

70
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,120
Wait.

71
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,520
Jesus Christ.

72
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,400
Hey! Wait!

73
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,160
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

74
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,280
This guy sure moves quickly.
He's just gone.

75
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,040
Maybe something made him go,
maybe you should come back.

76
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,520
This place is awful.

77
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,080
Please don't hurt me.

78
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,600
WoDon't be frightened.

79
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,840
Don't worry.

80
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,120
There's nobody else here.
Just me.

81
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,400
I'm Kate.

82
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,520
What's your name?

83
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,440
Sasha.

84
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,000
That's a beautiful name.

85
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,920
Don't worry.

86
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,720
Everything's going to be all right, okay?

87
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,600
Do you understand me?

88
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,440
I'm just blind,

89
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,480
not retarded.

90
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,520
Finally.

91
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,760
I was beginning to wonder
if I was the only one in here.

92
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,240
I kept hoping I would find some other people.

93
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,560
I've been wondering around
these rooms for hours.

94
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,160
Stay away from me!

95
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,200
No one's going to hurt you.

96
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,160
Well, certainly not.

97
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,320
No. No.
I come in peace, young lady.

98
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,680
I'm Jerry.

99
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,960
This is Sasha.
She's blind.

100
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,440
And she's very scared.

101
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
What a bummer,

102
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,240
to be blind in this place.

103
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,400
Do you know what this place is?

104
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,040
No. No. No.

105
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,840
I don't suppose,
either of you two could

106
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,120
let me know what we're doing in here?

107
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,120
No.

108
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,640
Oh... Jerry Whitehall.

109
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
Kate Filmore.

110
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
What are you doing?

111
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,320
I'm marking the rooms.

112
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,400
This is the fourth room you've been in?

113
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,360
Yeah.

114
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,680
I thought you said you've been
wandering these rooms for hours.

115
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,200
Yeah. That's the weird thing isn't it?

116
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,000
Each one of these rooms,
has six of these doors,

117
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,920
or portals.

118
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,720
But no matter how many portals I go through,

119
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,600
I always wound up in the same three rooms.

120
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,240
Until now.

121
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,040
It's as if the rooms
were moving around or something.

122
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,040
Yeah. But I don't feel any motion, do you?

123
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,000
No.

124
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,520
It's just so strange.

125
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,520
I ran into this guy...

126
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,560
Oh no.
It's getting closer!

127
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,880
- What is?
- I don't know.

128
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,200
Something's coming after us,
and I don't think it likes us.

129
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,400
I don't hear any people.
I think it's just motors.

130
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,400
He wants us dead. We have
to get out of here right now.

131
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,560
Any suggestion on which way to go next?

132
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,360
Your guess is as good as mine.
I don't know.

133
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,360
Please, we have to move!

134
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,480
Uh... here.

135
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,800
Okay. Sasha, we're going to have
to climb a bit of a ladder.

136
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,000
Hold on to me.

137
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,160
- Move quickly.
- Get me out of here!

138
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,840
Help!

139
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,080
- Help me!
- Oh God!

140
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,520
There's a guy hanging.

141
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,320
I can't hold him much longer!

142
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,520
- Okay. I'm coming.
- Oh my God.

143
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,040
What's happening?

144
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,000
Hurry!

145
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,360
Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on.

146
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,640
Grab his...

147
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,680
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

148
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,680
Here...

149
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,840
Good girl. Good girl.

150
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Sasha,
you're going to be okay.

151
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,640
Just stay here.
You're going to be okay.

152
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,400
There you are.
You've found some friends, huh?

153
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,360
Help me get him down.

154
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,360
Fantastic.

155
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,960
- Give me some space.
- I'm here.

156
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,240
- I can grab his legs.
- I'm loosening the belt.

157
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,720
All right.
All right. I got him.

158
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,360
I'm losing it.

159
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,120
Ready, you got it?

160
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,640
- Yeah.
- Hurry.

161
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,640
There it goes.

162
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,680
I know you want a cigarette,
but not yet.

163
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,840
- Slowly. Easy.
- I've got his legs.

164
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,600
Lean him up against this wall.

165
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,440
Okay. Watch his head.

166
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,720
That's it.

167
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,720
Just make sure he's upright.

168
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,200
He's alive.

169
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,880
He's breathing.

170
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,240
Good.

171
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,200
He's military.

172
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,400
Colonel Thomas H. Maguire,
Department of Defense,

173
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,280
Jesus Christ.

174
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,680
He's Pentagon,
hi-tech liaison.

175
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,960
You...

176
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,960
how the hell would you know?

177
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,560
A buddy of mine's doing 10- 20 upstate

178
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,040
for cracking the mainframe
on the Pentagon two years ago.

179
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,840
I helped him write the code.
Maybe that's why I'm in here.

180
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
You know for sure we're in prison?

181
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,800
- I'm assuming...
- You know what they say.

182
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,760
Thanks.
That's helpful.

183
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,920
Jerry Whitehall. Thanks.

184
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,400
Simon Grady.

185
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,920
That's Kate.

186
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,000
Sasha.

187
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,400
I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.

188
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,880
Max Reisler.

189
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,920
- Thanks.
- Sasha...

190
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,040
Sasha...

191
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,000
Jerry, could you...

192
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
Sure, of course.

193
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,360
Come on, sit him up.

194
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,120
Let's get you sitting up straight here.

195
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,000
Sasha, you okay?

196
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,040
This man's been beaten badly.

197
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,200
He's been tortured.

198
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,200
Look at his hand.

199
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,160
- Cigarette burns.
- Jesus.

200
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,560
They're coming for us next.

201
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,120
Don't you worry.
I won't let anyone hurt you.

202
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,160
I hope it's that easy, Kate.

203
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,800
There's nothing in here.

204
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,840
What do you think?

205
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,880
I figure he knows something
he didn't want anyone to know.

206
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,440
That's usually why people are tortured.

207
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,800
How do you know,
Mr. Cigarette Burns?

208
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,800
What are you, an expert?

209
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,840
As a matter of fact,
you weedy little shit...

210
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,320
They're coming!
They're coming!

211
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
They're coming.
They're coming.

212
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,920
Oh, hello.

213
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,040
Do you know where the showers are?

214
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,320
I seem to be lost, again.

215
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,800
I always get lost in this gym.

216
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,800
I don't know why my daughter-in-law
insists on bringing me here.

217
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,000
It's all the way across town.

218
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,040
Whoa.

219
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,400
Watch your step.
Watch your step.

220
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,960
Thank you, dear.

221
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,920
Oh my goodness.

222
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,120
I'm afraid I can't help you with the showers.

223
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,560
I'm Jerry.

224
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,680
You're not little Jerry Reisback,
are you?

225
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,080
No.

226
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,640
Thank goodness. He's my paperboy,
and I owe him $10.

227
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
Right. Well, this is Simon.

228
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,640
Kate and Sasha.

229
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,560
Hello.

230
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,360
And uh...

231
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,760
Max.

232
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,120
Max.

233
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,400
- Max.
- And you are?

234
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,920
I'm Mrs. Paley.

235
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,280
How do you do Mrs. Paley?

236
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,400
You don't happen to know
why you're here, do you?

237
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,480
Oh dear. I was never very good at philosophy.

238
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,680
Do any of us know what's going on here?

239
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,040
Sorry.

240
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,600
I've been trying to get a handle
on the configuration of these rooms.

241
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
All I can say is...

242
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,280
They just don't make any sense.

243
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,320
That's right.
They sure don't.

244
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,280
It's as if the rooms
are moving around very quickly.

245
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
There's got to be some kind of logic to it.

246
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,680
These rooms just seem to repeat.

247
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,720
You go in one direction,
the room just loops back on itself.

248
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's getting closer.

249
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,840
Sasha, do you know what it is?

250
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,720
Not really.

251
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,480
But I can hear it.

252
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,880
All the time,
even when you don't.

253
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,000
And it sounds...

254
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,840
...it feels wrong.

255
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,680
Maybe we're in hell.

256
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,360
All right,

257
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,000
let's get some real answers.

258
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,040
His answer was suicide.

259
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,480
Not exactly a comforting thought.

260
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,760
Soldier, up on your feet.

261
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,520
Careful, he's hurt.

262
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,120
Come on, pumpkin,
up you come.

263
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,000
Stop it.
He's in serious condition.

264
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,080
Stop it.

265
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,040
Listen to me, sweetheart...

266
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,480
I'm not your sweetheart,
asshole.

267
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,240
All right.
This man's been tortured.

268
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,560
You want to be next when they come for us?

269
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,560
Who exactly are they?

270
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,080
Well, I'm going to find out.
Come on.

271
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,600
Stop it. Stop it.

272
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,320
Are you trying to kill us?

273
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,960
It's not going to help
us if he dies, you know?

274
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,520
You've got no information whatsoever.

275
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,400
- It's here.
- Jesus...

276
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,720
what the fuck?!

277
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,720
Come on.

278
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,760
He's conscious.

279
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,720
Sit him up.
Sit him up.

280
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,840
Come on, soldier.
Talk to me, soldier.

281
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,680
Talk to me.
What's going on here?

282
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,320
Are you speaking to me?

283
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,680
Yes. Jesus Christ. Yes.

284
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,320
Just tell me, how do we get out of here?

285
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,960
I don't know.

286
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,520
You figure out the code,

287
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,320
you get out.

288
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
The first one had rules...

289
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,040
The first one?
What are you talking about?

290
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,600
Leave him alone.
He's delirious.

291
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,760
He knows something,
all right?

292
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,080
I'll carry him myself,
just...

293
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,240
The first one had numbers...

294
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
What do you mean,
'the first one'?

295
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,360
- Let him go.
- I'm out of here.

296
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,400
Oh my God.
Are you okay?

297
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,600
Did you hit your head?

298
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,920
Yeah. I slipped.

299
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,200
It's a wall.
It wiggled.

300
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,720
- You sure you're okay...
- Look. There it goes again.

301
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,360
That... that... that...

302
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,760
That's... that's... I don't know.

303
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,760
No!

304
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,640
Holy fuck.

305
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,120
What is that?

306
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,640
I don't know.

307
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,400
But I don't think we should
stick around to find out.

308
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,320
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

309
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,240
Come on, Sasha, I'm here.

310
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,240
I'm right behind you, honey.

311
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,240
Hurry, let's go!

312
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,280
Easy, easy...

313
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,720
For Christ's sake.

314
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,760
What the...

315
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Come on.
There you go.

316
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,560
- Grab right there.
- Where are you?

317
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,800
Come on, Colonel.

318
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,680
It's time for us to go.
I'm not done with you yet.

319
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,760
I'm not going.

320
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,880
What did you do that for?

321
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,360
I'm not going anywhere soon.

322
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,320
Well, fuck you.

323
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,360
Come on, Kate.

324
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,560
Let's get out of here.

325
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,880
Come on, where's the key?
Do you have the key?

326
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,440
You mean this?
Yeah.

327
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,360
No.

328
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,400
What did you do that for?

329
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,040
You don't honestly think you can escape?

330
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,000
We have to try.

331
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,200
Oh my God.

332
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,280
This is gonna hurt.

333
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,600
Kate,
get the hell up here!

334
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,320
No. I'm not leaving without him.

335
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,920
For God's sake,
he's a dead man. Move.

336
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,320
God.

337
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
There's no time left.
Let's go.

338
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,760
Oh my God.
There's got to be a way.

339
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,280
Get the... get the hell out of there.

340
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,200
- Oh my God.
- Leave him, he's dead.

341
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,240
Oh my God.

342
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,120
Let me go.

343
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,440
Let me go.

344
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,040
It's still coming.
Come on.

345
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,640
So what the hell happened back there?

346
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,080
I don't know.

347
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,720
Hello.

348
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,720
And where did you come from?

349
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,640
What's your name?

350
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,440
I'm... I'm Kate.

351
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,440
Don't you remember me?

352
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,400
I'm Mrs. Paley.

353
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,640
The Colonel was our only link to this place.

354
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,080
Maybe not.

355
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,680
I designed the door panels in here.

356
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,680
The touch sensors.

357
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,760
What?

358
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,720
I was freelancing for a subcontractor, I...

359
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,000
You didn't think this
was worth mentioning before?

360
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,400
I signed a confidentiality...

361
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,160
Given our current situation,
I'd say it's null and void.

362
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,480
- Jesus Christ!
- The legal...

363
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,520
What the hell is this place?

364
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,800
I don't know.

365
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,320
You don't think the guy that makes
the toilets in the space shuttle,

366
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,000
gets to see the plans for the rest of it?

367
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,000
You must have had some
idea what they were building.

368
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,920
It was experimental.
It was a prototype.

369
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,880
For what?

370
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,200
- I'm not sure.
- For what?!

371
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,440
Leading-edge stuff.

372
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,240
There were rumors...

373
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,560
What kind of rumors, Jerry?

374
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,560
What rumors?

375
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,120
Quantum teleportation.

376
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,880
Pardon?

377
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,880
They were just rumors.

378
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,960
You mean, like...
'Beam me up, Scotty'?

379
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,960
Okay.

380
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,160
Now this is getting ridiculous.

381
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,320
What do you know, Jerry?

382
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,280
Nothing.

383
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,880
- You're lying.
- Why would I lie?

384
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,560
Because both you and the
Colonel work for them.

385
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,480
Them? Who the hell are 'them' anyway?

386
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,000
What? The government?
The mafia?

387
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,960
Aliens?

388
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,440
Oh my goodness.

389
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,760
It's a tesseract.

390
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,680
Christ, she's losing it.

391
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,680
Isn't it beautiful?

392
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,960
Isn't what beautiful, Mrs. Paley?

393
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,080
Holy shit.

394
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,040
If you look at it from
just the right angle...

395
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,240
What did you call it again, Mrs. Paley?

396
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,240
It's a tesseract, sweetheart.

397
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,160
Tesseract?

398
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Tesseract.

399
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,000
It's... It's a tesseract.

400
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,920
How do you know it's a tesser... act,

401
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,160
or whatever you call it?

402
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,320
Is the second act beginning already?

403
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,320
We should be getting back to our seats.

404
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,440
Excuse me.

405
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,640
Yeah.

406
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,680
Is she for real?

407
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,480
A tesseract,
Holy Christ, of course.

408
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,480
A tesseract.

409
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,680
Jerry, you okay?

410
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,040
Yeah, yeah. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

411
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,740
It's been staring at us
in the face the whole time.

412
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:44,360
Maybe you could share
with the rest of the class.

413
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,960
Oh. Of course.

414
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,160
A tesseract...

415
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,840
it's another name for...

416
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,640
...a hypercube.

417
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,800
A what?

418
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,320
A hypercube... a four-dimensional cube.

419
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,280
Four dimensions?

420
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,160
All the elements are there.

421
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,080
Rooms repeating.
Rooms folding in on themselves.

422
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,320
Teleportation.

423
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,440
It could all very well add up.

424
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,080
Look. Here. See?

425
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,160
Let's call one dimension, length,

426
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,080
and represent that with a simple line.

427
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,040
Now, two dimensions are length and width,

428
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,000
which can be represented by a single square.

429
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,680
Now if we extend that square,

430
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,680
one more dimension...

431
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,040
we get...
a cube,

432
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,440
which has three dimensions.

433
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,080
Length, width, and depth.

434
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,600
Come on, we've all passed the eighth grade.

435
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,600
Hush.

436
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,120
Here's the really funky part.

437
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,480
If you take this cube,

438
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,800
and extend it one more dimension,

439
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,760
we get...

440
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,480
A tesseract.

441
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,240
I thought time was considered
to be the fourth dimension.

442
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,840
Sure. That's one idea.

443
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,760
But what if you have
a fourth spatial dimension?

444
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,000
- There's no such thing.
- Why don't you shut up?

445
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,920
Okay. Okay.

446
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,200
Let's just say that we are in this hyper...

447
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,880
- Cube.
- Cube. Whatever.

448
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,720
Does this diagram show us how to get out?

449
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,120
Well, uh... no.

450
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,440
A hypercube isn't supposed to be real.

451
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,880
It's just a theoretical construct.

452
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,360
Oh. Well that makes me feel better.

453
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,760
Is there a theory on how
we might get out of this...

454
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,800
theoretical construct?

455
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,720
I don't know.

456
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,000
Don't worry, dear.

457
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,240
It's just a matter of time.

458
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,560
That's so much clearer.
Thank you.

459
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,440
Great.

460
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,280
Anyway...

461
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,840
here's my theory for what it's worth:

462
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,680
we are all...

463
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,000
unwilling participants...
in a game show,

464
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,960
and are being videotaped as we speak.

465
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,720
Although I don't condone forcible
abduction of innocent people,

466
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,640
we can take comfort in the fact
that once the show airs,

467
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,840
we'll be able to parlay this
into lucrative sponsorship deals.

468
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,760
Okay, Max.

469
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,120
And what's the object of this game show?

470
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,680
Hmm... I don't know.
To get out alive?

471
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,800
I think we should make a map.

472
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,480
I don't think a map is really going to help us.

473
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,480
Look at that.

474
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,320
That wasn't there a minute ago.

475
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,840
Did you write that?

476
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,480
No. I left my wings at home.

477
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,400
I just marked this room as 10 before it.

478
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Somebody's been here before us.

479
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Thanks.
A really large someone.

480
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,920
Why go through the trouble
of writing it on the ceiling?

481
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,240
60,659 rooms?

482
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,400
Christ.

483
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,040
This place must be huge.

484
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,640
Oh yes, yes.

485
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,920
In a hypercube, there could be
60 million rooms.

486
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
She could be right.

487
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,120
There's a comforting thought.

488
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,840
What the hell are you doing?

489
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,360
Yowza.

490
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,800
The ratings on this show just doubled.

491
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,120
What do you see?

492
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,560
A girl.

493
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,920
Oh Jesus.

494
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,920
I'm going in.

495
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,320
- I think I'm going to puke.
- You all right?

496
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,880
Okay. I just... whoa...

497
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,040
Hey. Hey. Hey.

498
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,240
- Get back here.
- What's happening?

499
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,480
- What's going on?
- Help!

500
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,920
Try to give me your hand.

501
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,960
- Help me!
- You okay?

502
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,240
What the hell is going on in there?

503
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,440
Max,
don't be an idiot.

504
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,640
- Come on back.
- No, it's okay.

505
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,640
- The gravity shifted.
- She needs help,

506
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,640
- she may be hurt.
- Wow.

507
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,960
Are we going in there or what?

508
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,720
Maybe she knows something.

509
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,480
What about our...

510
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,480
less agile members?

511
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,080
I have an idea.

512
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,440
Hello.

513
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,640
Whoa.

514
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,360
I'm all right.

515
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,400
Miss?

516
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,480
Hey, Miss.

517
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Hey.

518
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,520
Wake up.

519
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,720
She's on her way.

520
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,080
I guess it's time for plan B.

521
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,800
Give her mouth-to-mouth and see if it works.

522
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,840
Think I should?

523
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,280
Oh, very funny.

524
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,120
Hi.

525
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,760
What's wrong?

526
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,360
What the hell?

527
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,800
Where am I?

528
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,280
That's the million dollar question.

529
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,280
Does she have to keep cackling like that?

530
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,920
Come on,
let's get this over with.

531
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,120
All right. This is going to be some kind of...

532
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,880
Yeah, Mrs. Paley.
Just keep laughing there.

533
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,440
This is more fun than I've had since

534
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,760
my thirteenth birthday.

535
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,360
Glad somebody is having fun.

536
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,360
This reminds me of that rope swing

537
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,160
we used to have at home.

538
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,680
For God's sake, Mrs. Paley,
this isn't a game!

539
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,400
Come on.
Come on down.

540
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,920
Simon, you guys,
keep her steady.

541
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,920
All right, all right.
Come on.

542
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,880
Okay. And you're down.
That's good.

543
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,120
It's okay.
She's down.

544
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,400
- We've landed.
- Yeah.

545
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,920
It's your turn, you'll
have to climb around the sides.

546
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,560
Well, this is a lot
like the other ones, isn't it?

547
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,000
Christ.
This is going to be fun.

548
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,480
Hello there.
I'm Mrs. Paley.

549
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,760
Who the hell are you people?!

550
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,880
Well...

551
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,760
I'm Kate,
and this is Mrs. Paley.

552
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,800
And I am Julia.

553
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,320
And this is...

554
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,040
Hey. Is this your jacket?

555
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,400
No.

556
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,840
Well then how did I...

557
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,640
I must have had more
to drink last night than I thought.

558
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,440
There's nothing in here.

559
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,760
How the hell did I get here?

560
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,680
Have we been kidnapped?

561
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,920
That's a really good question.

562
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,280
Does anyone remember how we got here?

563
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,280
Last thing I remember was going to sleep.

564
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,560
Where?

565
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,400
In my bed.

566
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,400
Where do you live?

567
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,000
Lincoln, Nebraska.

568
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,680
Kate, I am a healthy, married,
male white engineer,

569
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,600
who enjoys reading horror novels
and eating chocolate ice cream,

570
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,760
as well as climbing around psycho-jungle-gyms.

571
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,240
Okay.

572
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,720
I remember driving home
from Maine State Hospital.

573
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,600
It was late,
and I just wanted to get home,

574
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,480
I've been working long hours.
I'm a psychotherapist.

575
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,520
Simon.

576
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,680
New Haven.

577
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,560
I was out for a drink.

578
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,600
What do you do?

579
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,880
A consultant.

580
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,920
Management consultant.

581
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,600
Yeah, right.

582
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
And I'm Santa Claus.

583
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,800
Okay, Max.
How about you?

584
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,200
I live in Palo Alto.
I design computer games.

585
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,920
The last thing I remember,
I fell asleep on my keyboard.

586
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,680
Sasha.

587
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,120
And where do you live?

588
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,160
New Mexico.

589
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,240
I was doing my homework
in the kitchen, like I always do.

590
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,720
Nothing ever happens to me.

591
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,000
The last thing I remember...

592
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,800
is taking the dog for a walk.

593
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,680
Julia?

594
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,960
I was at an after party
for a premiere in Santa Monica.

595
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,800
Are you an actress?

596
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,880
No.

597
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,200
No, I'm an attorney.

598
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,960
Let's just say if I was kidnapped
it was for the ransom.

599
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,240
So we've got Silicon Valley,
Connecticut, Nebraska,

600
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,200
Hollywood, Maine.

601
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,680
Mrs. Paley,
where exactly do you live?

602
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,320
In that high-rise at the corner
of Riverside and 94th.

603
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,400
Could you give me a lift home, dear?

604
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,240
I seem to have lost my daughter-in-law.

605
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,720
Ignorance is bliss.

606
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,760
This doesn't make any sense.

607
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,960
Yeah, well...

608
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,040
I think they probably flew us here.

609
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,640
Drugged us and flew us out here
in private or military jets.

610
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,440
That's what I think.

611
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,600
- Where is here?
- I don't know.

612
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,920
Your guess is as good as mine.

613
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,320
They could have built
an hypercube structure anywhere.

614
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,280
And if this thing really does fold space,

615
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,400
we could be literately anywhere.

616
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,400
What the hell...

617
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,000
What?

618
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,200
Here is that number again.

619
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,000
6-0-6-5-9

620
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,640
This can't be the same room.
Jesus!

621
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,880
It's not, because now they're
in a string of other numbers.

622
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,400
There just can't be that many rooms.

623
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,640
Maybe they are not room numbers.

624
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,560
Maybe somebody else figured something out.

625
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,480
We are definitely not alone.

626
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,480
Check this out.

627
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,320
What is it?

628
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,320
What's happening?

629
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,320
Julia,
is that your watch?

630
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,960
No.

631
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,000
No, it's mine.

632
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,200
It...

633
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,000
Well, this is bizarre.

634
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,600
What, somebody else
uses a watch just like yours?

635
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,000
Somebody is playing games with us.

636
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,520
Shit... look...

637
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,520
this is the watch that my wife
gave me on my 40th.

638
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,480
See?

639
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,320
This is the watch we've just found.

640
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,880
Maybe it's your game
that we are playing, Jerry.

641
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,440
You designed the doors,
your watch. What's next?

642
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,440
- No, I...
- For the love of God, Mrs. Paley...

643
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,880
Mrs. Paley, please don't.

644
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,360
Oh, my goodness,
I think he's still alive.

645
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
- Mrs. Paley, please.
- Get her down.

646
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,760
Easy, careful.

647
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,640
Is somebody in there?

648
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,960
- What do you see?
- Jerry?

649
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,520
Oh, God.
There's a guy down here.

650
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,520
Oh!

651
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,760
- The gravity's shifting.
- What's happening?

652
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,080
You okay?
Are you all right?

653
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,760
Simon,
what's going on?

654
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
My God.

655
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,360
Hey, hey, fellow.

656
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,840
Oh, Jesus.

657
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,400
- Be careful.
- Ugh!

658
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,400
- Is he alive?
- I don't think so.

659
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,960
- Let's roll him over.
- Yeah, yeah...

660
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,400
Oh God, is he ripe.

661
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,760
What... what is that?

662
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,720
Oh!
It looks pretty dead to me.

663
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,960
I hope he's still alive.

664
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,080
He's been here for a while, Mrs. Paley.

665
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,320
Oh, poor man.

666
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,960
Who do you think wrote these numbers?

667
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,080
He must have written them himself,
It's all upside down.

668
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,680
It's the same writing
as those numbers we keep seeing.

669
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,560
Oh, no!

670
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,120
It's poor Dr. Rosenzweig.

671
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,960
You know him?

672
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,640
He'll never get his Nobel Prize now.

673
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,600
- Who the hell is he?
- Holy Christ...

674
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,800
Phil Rosenzweig.

675
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Last year he was the leading
theoretical physicist in his field.

676
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,760
- Which was?
- Quantum chaos.

677
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,880
Oh God, Phil Rosenzweig.
I read his book...

678
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,440
- Oh Jesus.
- Oh my God.

679
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,440
Is he...?

680
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,680
Kate, is he...?

681
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,880
- Yeah, he's gone.
- You are positive?

682
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,440
Uh-huh.

683
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,160
Somebody...?

684
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,040
I'm here, Sasha.
Got you.

685
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,960
Does anyone understand these numbers?

686
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,200
What was he writing?

687
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,560
Beats me.

688
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,200
May be he was trying to calculate
his way out of here.

689
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,560
Looks like he ran out of time.

690
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,880
How did old Mrs. Paley know him?

691
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,800
- I don't know.
- Hey, look. More numbers.

692
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,600
Same handwriting.

693
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,840
The question is,
did he solve it before he died?

694
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,040
God. She's okay.
Are you okay?

695
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,680
He must have finished it here.

696
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,880
Look, there it is again... 6-0-6-5-9.

697
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,800
How does that get us out of here?

698
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,280
- It's got to mean something.
- Yeah, but what?

699
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,960
I don't know,
but we better remember it.

700
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,120
You know, I wonder if is he's got a...

701
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,480
What are you doing?
That's disgusting.

702
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,480
Found a pen.

703
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,800
Hope you have better luck than he did.

704
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,920
Oh no,
this can't be happening.

705
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,160
Oh dear.

706
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,560
Oh dear, just wait.

707
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,360
Oh, I'm such an idiot.
Oh, no. Wait a minute.

708
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,400
She's gonna drive me insane.

709
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,520
Oh,
it was right here.

710
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,000
- What is it, Mrs. Paley?
- Izon, where are you?

711
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,320
I'm such an idiot.

712
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,960
- Did she say Izon?
- Izon, where are you?

713
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,760
You come back here this instant.

714
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,080
Who are you looking for Mrs. Paley?

715
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,440
Have you seen my dog?

716
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,680
He's a darling little Shi-Tzu.
Darn it.

717
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,000
Her dog's name is 'Izon'?
That's weird.

718
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,440
I thought Izon was a...

719
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,000
A weapons manufacturer.

720
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,040
Yes.

721
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,560
And you guys would know that because...

722
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,680
I read the papers.

723
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,920
- Mrs. Paley...
- Poor puppy...

724
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,280
Mrs. Paley, are you sure
you didn't leave the dog at home?

725
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,800
No. He was right here.
I'm such an idiot.

726
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,240
This breaks my heart.

727
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,480
Mrs. Paley...

728
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,760
Mrs. Paley,
what do you do for living?

729
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,880
Oh, nothing.
I'm retired.

730
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,080
I shouldn't have let him off the leash.

731
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,760
Before you retired,
what did you do?

732
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,600
Nothing very exciting.
I was a theoretical mathematician.

733
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,520
Where did you work?

734
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,520
Oh, my head hurts.

735
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,520
At Skippy Research Affiliates...

736
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,360
what do they called it?
A think-tank in Washington state.

737
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,400
She worked for Skippy Research Affiliates

738
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,240
and her dog's name was Izon?

739
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,400
- Mrs. Paley?
- Hmm?

740
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,000
Is it possible that you worked
for Izon Research Affiliates

741
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,200
and your dog's name is Skippy?

742
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,520
How did you know where I worked?

743
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,040
Oh, God.

744
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,920
She worked for a weapons manufacturer?

745
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,640
She's a good friend of our Nobel wanna-be.

746
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,320
I don't think we should trust Mrs. Funnyfarm.

747
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,640
I'm not crazy, and I'm not
hard of hearing either.

748
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,360
I told you no one would believe me.

749
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,640
Mrs. Paley,

750
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,960
what sort of research did you do at Izon?

751
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,200
General, I will not be party to this insanity!

752
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,520
I'm not a general.

753
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,560
I don't care what Alex Trusk says.

754
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,320
It's impossible.
And what's more, it's inhuman.

755
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,360
- Who's Alex?
- Did she say Alex Trusk?

756
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,520
Oh Christ.
We're dead.

757
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,280
This is really getting ridiculous.

758
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,800
Who's Alex Trusk?

759
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,280
Alex Trusk? Hacker extraordinare?
He's a legend.

760
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,560
This is exactly the kind
of twisted maze he'd create.

761
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,680
Alex Trusk doesn't even exist.

762
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,000
Some things should never be created.

763
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,880
They exist for theoretical purposes only.

764
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,160
It would never last.
Can't you understand that?

765
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,400
Okay, you're a shrink.

766
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,840
Can you tell me what the hell's happening?

767
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,200
I... umm...

768
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,640
I'd say that seeing the dead man

769
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,520
triggered some sort of emotional response.

770
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,040
Flashbacks,
post-traumatic stress...

771
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,880
So she is connected to this, yeah?

772
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,480
Skippy...

773
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,520
Ooh,
I think I hear him.

774
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,880
Skippy?

775
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,080
Mrs. Paley,
Mrs. Paley, don't...

776
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,320
Skippy?

777
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,280
Mrs. Paley.

778
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,920
Oh my.

779
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,480
Help me, please.

780
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,440
Uh, uh.

781
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,560
No, don't trust the old cunt.

782
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,320
She lied about everything.

783
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,800
What a... Jesus.

784
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,920
What just happened?

785
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,360
It took my head, man.

786
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,720
I lost my fucking head!

787
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,480
Paley opened...

788
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,520
the portal...

789
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,120
Wait, wait,
I have an idea.

790
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,680
I think we're all tired.
We need to calm down, everybody.

791
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,920
Hold it. Wait a minute!

792
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,360
I have an idea.

793
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,000
Let me guess,
you designed the floor too.

794
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,280
You better have a really
good fucking explanation, Jerry.

795
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,760
I know what just happened there was a little...

796
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,040
shocking, but it actually
makes total sense if we're...

797
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,400
in a really multi-dimensional
quantum environment.

798
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,960
English, please.

799
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,760
One fundamental idea of a quantum universe,

800
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,520
is that parallel realities
can actually exist simultaneously.

801
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,720
How do you know that,
Jerry?

802
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,800
All you designed were the door panels!

803
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,360
I read it in Rosenzweig book,

804
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,280
it was a big part of this theory.

805
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,200
What if whoever designed this stinking thing

806
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,240
somehow managed to create
a place where parallel realities

807
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,320
can crossover like that?

808
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,240
So you are saying
we just saw Simon and Mrs. Paley

809
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,120
- in a parallel universe?
- Yes, yes!

810
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,360
Stop it!

811
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,800
A universe where things
turn out a little differently.

812
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,520
- Fuck.
- Uh, please.

813
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,360
Think about it,
think about it.

814
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,280
A few minutes before,

815
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,000
- when you found the watch,
- Yeah.

816
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,800
and we realized that somebody else

817
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,920
had been marking numbers in the rooms, right?

818
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,760
That's when I thought maybe
we should leave markers behind,

819
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,000
in case we doubled back and got side-tracked.

820
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,240
Things like a piece of clothing or jewelry.

821
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,600
I think what a pity it would be
to leave my watch.

822
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,720
But I would do it if I had to.

823
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,320
You're saying that in an alternate reality

824
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,120
we'd already gotten ourselves into such trouble

825
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,080
that you decided that is okay
to leave your watch?

826
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,800
- Yes!
- For crying out loud!

827
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,320
What a load of crap!

828
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,280
There's got to be a logical explanation.

829
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,040
What would you think that is?

830
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,840
This is just an optical illusion or something?

831
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,360
Yeah, sure.
Why not?

832
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,680
Finally, yeah.
A sane idea.

833
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,240
Oh, that's a sane idea.

834
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,200
All right.

835
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,280
If Max is right, why don't you
go and open that door?

836
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,040
- Oh, come on.
- Have a look.

837
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,080
Excuse me?

838
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,040
If you're so sure it's an optical illusion,

839
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,120
open the door and have a look.

840
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,160
You might want to stand
to the side, in case that thing...

841
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,160
Fuck off, Jerry!

842
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,080
Okay, hold it!

843
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,120
All right?
Don't open it.

844
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,080
Say Jerry's right,

845
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,040
I think all of this is a hoax, okay?

846
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,960
I think Jerry's either full
of shit or part of this experiment.

847
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,120
- Simon, I never...
- Shut the fuck up!

848
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,920
I'm agreeing with you, Max.

849
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,000
I think we're all pumped so full of LSD

850
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,360
and I think we're hidden in some CIA hospital

851
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,040
in Area 51, or whatever.

852
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,760
But let's just say,
on the off- chance

853
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,160
that Jerry is actually right.

854
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,080
Then what happens if whatever
the fuck it was in there

855
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,360
that killed the guy,
killed me,

856
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,760
what happens if
that fucking thing gets in here?!

857
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,760
What happens then?!

858
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,560
You're all crazy.

859
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,520
Hey, man,
what are you doing?

860
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,640
Just don't fucking open the door.

861
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,760
What are you so scared of anyway?

862
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,800
I just saw my fucking head
taken off by something or other.

863
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,000
How's that for starters?

864
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,080
Where did you get that knife?

865
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,960
It's mine.

866
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,360
I collect knives.

867
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,800
He had it when I first saw him.

868
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,640
- He sure did.
- That's convenient.

869
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,480
He's the only guy with a knife here,

870
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,000
if anyone was a part
of the experiment... maybe you.

871
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,200
I know! I know!
I've got it! I've got it!

872
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,000
Why don't we all just

873
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,520
get some ice cream

874
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,120
and everyone will feel
a lot better about everything?

875
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,680
You're funny, Mrs. Paley.
You really are a funny old lady.

876
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,880
You're also cute and senile.

877
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,080
You leave her alone,
she doesn't understand.

878
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,040
All right, she's already admitted
working for Izon,

879
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,880
one of the most powerful weapons
manufacturers in the world.

880
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,120
She recognized the figures on the wall,

881
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,560
and she knew the dead guy.

882
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,760
No. Maybe my alter ego wasn't all that wrong.

883
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,120
Maybe we shouldn't trust dear old Mrs. Paley.

884
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,720
Maybe you're the one we shouldn't trust.

885
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,840
I beg your pardon?

886
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,080
Maybe you're the one we shouldn't trust.

887
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,000
Oh.

888
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,240
I'm going to ignore that,
little girl,

889
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,240
because you're a cripple.

890
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,680
I think we should keep moving, huh?

891
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,480
After you.

892
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,360
Kate, I'm really thirsty.

893
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,360
Me too, sweetheart.
Me too.

894
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,800
I'm exhausted.
Are we there yet?

895
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,160
Come on, Mrs. Paley.
Just hold on a little longer.

896
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,080
Who's this Alex Trusk person?

897
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,560
Are you kidding?

898
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,760
He programmed the virus that crashed

899
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,440
the Tokyo stock exchange two years ago.

900
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,120
He's the one that broke into
the Air Traffic Control Grid,

901
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,480
and crashed those two Air Force jets in Nevada

902
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,640
to protest military spending.

903
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
You forgot the one about Alex Trusk

904
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,280
being the first genetically
engineered superhuman,

905
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,560
bred in a test tube, who now
lives and walks amongst us.

906
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,120
That sounds a bit far-fetched.

907
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,360
Don't worry.

908
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,840
Alex Trusk is a conspiracy
theorist's wet dream.

909
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,320
He doesn't exist.

910
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,920
Fine.
Just keep fooling yourself.

911
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,080
Would you people just shut up and keep moving?

912
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,080
Do you really believe this stuff

913
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,280
about parallel universes?

914
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,880
If you asked me yesterday,
I'd say no.

915
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,960
But this place changes your
perception about what's possible.

916
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,040
Look, let's just keep this between us for now.

917
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,040
Yeah. Okay.

918
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,680
Here's the deal.
I'm a private investigator.

919
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,280
I'm on a case,
missing persons.

920
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,280
Given our current situation,
this counts as irony.

921
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,280
You're right.

922
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,280
I think they stuck me in here because of her...

923
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,280
Becky Young.

924
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,720
They've emptied my pockets
except for my knife and this.

925
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,080
Maybe it's a message or a warning.

926
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,640
Here's the kicker.

927
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,920
Guess who she worked for?

928
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,880
Izon?

929
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,080
Kate.

930
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,920
Kate.

931
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,240
Kate, you have to wake up,
there's...

932
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,000
What is it?
What's wrong?

933
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,160
There's something here.

934
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,640
Do you see anything?

935
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,760
You're probably just dreaming or some...

936
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,200
Whoa.

937
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,480
There is...

938
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,360
there is something.

939
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,360
What the hell is that?

940
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,520
Kate.

941
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,520
Kate, what do you see?

942
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,600
It's a square.
It's just floating.

943
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,240
What is it?

944
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,840
It's beautiful.

945
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,760
You recognize this too,
Mrs. Paley?

946
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,760
Well, not exactly...

947
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,560
- What just happened?
- Now there's two.

948
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,640
It's multiplying.

949
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,320
- Oh my God...
- Maybe it's the way out.

950
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,040
Oh. Wow.

951
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,600
If we're drunk,
I wanna know what this stuff is.

952
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,440
Maybe that's what a
four-dimensional object looks like.

953
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,280
If that's the way out,
how do we use it?

954
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,240
I hate it.
It sounds wrong.

955
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,280
It's stunning.

956
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,280
The math of it.

957
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,200
It's a perfect quadrangular oscillation.

958
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,680
It's moving.
Mrs. Paley, no!

959
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,520
Ahh.

960
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,000
Get the fuck out of the way!

961
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,120
Jerry, you're hurt.

962
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,680
No. I'm okay.

963
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,720
Look out.

964
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,640
Stay low.

965
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,760
Whoa! Go on.

966
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,280
Come on, Mrs. Paley.
It's time to go.

967
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,080
Over here.
It looks safe.

968
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,400
- Don't stare at it. Go.
- It's coming back.

969
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,280
Come on, Max.

970
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,800
Go, Julia. Go.

971
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,640
- I want to get it.
- No. We've got to go.

972
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,440
Oh my God. Go.
Go up the stairs.

973
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,800
Come on, Mrs. Paley.
Keep going...

974
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,560
Kate!

975
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,600
Sasha.

976
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,320
Jerry.

977
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,320
- Oh Jesus!
- No.

978
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,280
- Sasha.
- No. Just don't do it.

979
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,320
- Just get in here.
- What the fuck are you doing?

980
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,320
Kate!

981
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,240
She's gone. You want to end up like Jerry?

982
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,080
- Sasha.
- Kate!

983
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,080
Kate, I'm here.

984
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,000
Kate.

985
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,040
You're a dead woman.

986
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,920
Oh... oh Jesus.

987
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,040
Sasha.

988
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,880
Kate, help.

989
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,920
- Kate, help!
- I'm coming to get you.

990
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:25,960
Help me!

991
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,080
Drop to the ground, Sasha.
Now.

992
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,560
Help me.

993
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,560
Okay, Sasha.

994
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,360
Now... uh...
I can see you, Sasha.

995
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,160
Flatten yourself
against the wall, on the ground.

996
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,640
- Crawl towards me.
- No. I can't. I'm scared.

997
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,200
You've gotta move,
or I can't come and get you.

998
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,280
Move towards me.

999
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,880
No. Stop, Sasha!

1000
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,760
Don't, Sasha.

1001
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,720
Get down.

1002
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,800
Damn it, Kate,
what do you want me to do?

1003
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,880
Just keep moving until you hit that corner,

1004
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,120
and then stay put.

1005
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,160
Okay?

1006
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,240
Sasha?

1007
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,120
Okay?
I'm almost there.

1008
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,960
Just crawl on. Keep your side
to the ground. You can do it.

1009
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,960
You've made it.
I'm right behind you.

1010
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,160
There you are.
Keep your knees in.

1011
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,640
Kate, thank God.

1012
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,480
There you are. You're okay.
You're okay...

1013
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,440
What just happened?

1014
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,400
I don't know.

1015
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,360
I don't know, Sasha.

1016
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,520
Sweet Jesus.

1017
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,560
It's shrinking so it can get us.

1018
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,200
Please let it be quick.

1019
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,320
Okay.

1020
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,400
We're going to make a run for it.

1021
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,760
- I can't.
- Yes you can. Just hold onto me.

1022
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,640
We're going to go to our right.

1023
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,800
No. We're going to go to the left.

1024
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,240
All right?

1025
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,720
- Okay?
- Okay.

1026
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,680
On the count of three...
just hold on to me.

1027
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,720
One, two, three...

1028
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,520
I've got you.

1029
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,800
Oh my God!

1030
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,800
Sasha, no.

1031
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,400
It responds to our movements.

1032
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,360
Don't move.

1033
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,320
Stay still.

1034
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,320
Don't...

1035
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,320
Oh my God.

1036
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,400
Is it gone?

1037
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,360
Yeah. It's gone.

1038
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,320
Thank you.

1039
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,520
We did it together. Let's get out
of here before it comes back.

1040
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,560
My glasses.

1041
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,960
You're glasses are gone.
Just go up the ladder.

1042
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,400
- Kate.
- Yeah? What?

1043
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,200
- I can smell it.
- What?

1044
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,200
Did someone die in here?

1045
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,120
Yeah.

1046
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,080
- Yeah. Jerry died.
- Oh no.

1047
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,560
He was so nice.

1048
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,120
We've got to go.
We've got to go, honey.

1049
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,120
Just get up there.
One foot after the other.

1050
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,800
- Where are the others?
- I think we're on our own.

1051
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,760
You're doing good.

1052
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,400
I see a pattern.

1053
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,520
Anyone connected to this...

1054
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,800
this hypercube...

1055
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,320
eventually dies a very violent,

1056
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,480
and painful death.

1057
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,080
I would hate for that
to happen to you, Mrs. Paley.

1058
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,880
I would.

1059
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,440
So drop the act

1060
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,520
and tell us how we get out of here.

1061
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,600
Huh?

1062
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,680
Simon.

1063
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,040
Simon, that's enough.

1064
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,640
- Shut up.
- Hey, Simon...

1065
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,640
- Shut up.
- Okay.

1066
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,160
Okay, Mrs. Paley.
You ready to talk?

1067
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,160
'Cause I'm all ears.

1068
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,200
I really don't need this operation, Doctor.

1069
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,720
I'm in perfect health.

1070
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,200
Just ask my daughter-in-law
over there. She'll explain.

1071
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,840
This joke's really getting stale.

1072
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,200
I'm going to give you one
more chance, Mrs. Paley.

1073
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,120
You tell me what I need to know,

1074
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,000
or I'm going to have to kill you.

1075
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,840
Do you understand?
I'm going to kill you.

1076
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,520
It's your choice.

1077
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,160
Get away from her!

1078
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,960
You have a choice to make.
Right now.

1079
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,240
Do you want to get out of here or not?

1080
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,360
- Yes, but...
- There are no buts!

1081
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,360
Hey guys, maybe...

1082
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,520
All right.

1083
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,560
Oh shit.

1084
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,160
It's here.

1085
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,200
It's gonna take my head off.

1086
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,760
Let's go.

1087
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,480
What about Mrs. Paley?

1088
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,600
Goddamn it.

1089
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,040
- I'm not gonna die here.
- You can't leave her.

1090
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,800
- Why should I help her?
- She'll die.

1091
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,760
- Forget about her.
- I'm gonna regret this.

1092
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,760
Julia!

1093
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,080
- I'm trying to get this off.
- Come on. Hurry.

1094
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,280
Shit!
Would someone give me a hand?

1095
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,720
Would somebody help me pick her up?

1096
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,480
Shit!

1097
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,120
Let go of me.

1098
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,080
Shit!

1099
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,760
I'm not staying here.
I'm out of here.

1100
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,960
Let go of me.

1101
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,000
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh my God.

1102
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,840
Oh God.

1103
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,920
Where do you think you're going?

1104
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,920
Hurry up.

1105
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,720
Get back here.

1106
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,880
What the hell?

1107
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,400
6-0-6-5-9.

1108
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,480
It could mean anything.

1109
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,240
Right.

1110
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,640
Maybe it's a coordinate of
some kind but in four dimensions.

1111
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,920
Some...

1112
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,520
I don't know.

1113
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,080
For all we know,

1114
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,120
it could be somebody's birthday,

1115
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,760
or a zip code,

1116
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,120
or just a serial number.

1117
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,840
I wish I was just...
smarter.

1118
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,400
Why do you think you're in here?

1119
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,840
I don't know.

1120
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,520
Maybe I was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

1121
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,960
Damn it. There's got to be
some sort of meaning to this.

1122
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,160
6-0-6-5-9.

1123
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,320
6-0-6-5-9.

1124
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,520
Maybe they just like to watch us squirm.

1125
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:53,360
Alex Trusk is the only one with the resources

1126
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,360
and brains to create something like this.

1127
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,400
Okay, Max.
Say you're right.

1128
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,480
Say it is Alex Trusk who's
responsible for all of this.

1129
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,720
Does it help us get out?

1130
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,680
No, we're still stuck here,
with no clue.

1131
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:11,000
And if this is someone's game,
it isn't a fair one.

1132
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,480
Max, do you think...

1133
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,160
We've got to keep moving.
Come on.

1134
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,280
Max?

1135
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,560
Max, what's wrong with you?

1136
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,040
Holy shit!
Variable time-speed rooms.

1137
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,360
- Pretty wild.
- I guess you could say that.

1138
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,200
Holy jumping Jesus!

1139
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,960
Get your hands off me.

1140
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,800
- Hello, Jerry.
- Who the hell are you?

1141
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,360
- You don't recognize me?
- Where am I?

1142
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,760
- How do you know my name?
- You don't know me?

1143
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,560
No.
Where the hell am I?

1144
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,600
You don't...?

1145
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,640
Wait, wait.

1146
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,200
You don't remember me?

1147
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,760
- No.
- What about the senile old broad,

1148
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,880
- or the little blind kid?
- What?

1149
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,240
Or that thing that chopped
you up like little pieces

1150
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,120
of deli fucking meat?

1151
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,800
I'm a friend... I mean you no harm.

1152
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,280
Let me go,
and I'll be on my way.

1153
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,280
No come on, you...

1154
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,720
You mean me no harm?
You're fucking hilarious, Jerry.

1155
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,040
How long have you been in here?

1156
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,600
I don't know.
I just woke up.

1157
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,400
You just woke up?

1158
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,360
Holy shit!

1159
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,120
Holy shit.

1160
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,240
Maybe you were right before, huh?

1161
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,200
You or the... whatever...

1162
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:08,520
This place does crossover
parallel alternate realities, huh?

1163
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,800
Have you been drinking?

1164
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,920
I really don't give a shit anymore.

1165
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,720
We are talking about alternate realities.

1166
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,680
Can I ask you a question?

1167
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,200
Do you mind?

1168
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,280
Yeah, okay, sure...

1169
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,480
just don't hurt me, huh?

1170
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,440
Are you hungry?

1171
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,440
Are you... hungry?

1172
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,360
Yeah, I guess...
my stomach's...

1173
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,360
'Cause I am hungry.

1174
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,360
I'm fucking starving.

1175
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,920
Oh my God.

1176
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,120
Kate, what is it?

1177
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,240
Kate?

1178
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,240
What do you see?

1179
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,160
Kate,
what's going on?

1180
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,920
I don't know.
I mean...

1181
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,360
I think in some other reality,
things didn't turn out so well.

1182
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,040
Again with the Alex Trusk?

1183
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,400
Why are you so afraid of this Alex Trusk?

1184
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,440
Because he's ruthless.
He's a hi-tech genius

1185
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,320
whose morals make Muammar Qaddafi

1186
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,080
look like Mother Teresa.

1187
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,840
Why are you panicking?

1188
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,800
Because he's throwing anybody
connected to this thing in here

1189
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,080
to fucking die!

1190
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,080
Max,
you're not connected.

1191
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,080
Can you keep a secret?

1192
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,480
Sure.
I love secrets.

1193
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,160
I designed a computer game called 'Relativity,'

1194
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,160
where contestants linked
to each over the Internet

1195
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,480
do battle in a 3-D environment,

1196
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,840
using different time signatures.

1197
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,840
What are you saying?

1198
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,760
Are you saying that you designed all this?

1199
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,720
No. Just these variable time speeds rooms.

1200
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,480
Just the concept.

1201
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,200
It was for a game.
Now here we are.

1202
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:25,120
Wow.

1203
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,080
This is really some game, Max.

1204
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,240
Do you have other little secrets
you want to tell me?

1205
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,760
People are dead,
okay?

1206
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,560
I'm not responsible for this.

1207
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,520
It was just a game.

1208
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,560
I can't even sell the stupid thing.

1209
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,880
It's all involved in a lawsuit.

1210
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,840
What kind of lawsuit?

1211
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,440
I don't know,
some...

1212
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,600
Right, you're a lawyer.

1213
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,520
A company called Cyber Thrill stole it from me.

1214
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,120
Cyber Thrill?

1215
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:55,440
You've heard of them?

1216
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,720
Yeah.

1217
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,680
Are you into computer games?

1218
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,560
Settle.

1219
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,280
Excuse me?

1220
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:08,680
I strongly recommend that
you settle. You'll never win.

1221
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,760
- How do you know that?
- Because...

1222
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,040
you're not up against Cyber Thrill.

1223
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,160
They're just a subsidiary.

1224
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,280
Who owns them?

1225
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,920
Izon.

1226
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,520
How do you know that?

1227
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,760
Because I...

1228
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,680
represent them.

1229
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,280
I must be hearing things.

1230
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,040
Finally.

1231
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,560
I was wondering if I was the only one in here.

1232
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,120
Do you need a hand there?

1233
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,880
You are upside-down.

1234
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,480
Do you have any idea what's going on here?

1235
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,080
Be careful.
Watch your step.

1236
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,320
Crazy.

1237
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,160
You are not the only person here, Jerry.

1238
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,000
There's lots of people just like you.

1239
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,200
How do you know my name?

1240
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,800
We've met before,
Jerry.

1241
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,000
I get this mouth-watering feeling
when I talk to you.

1242
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,960
- What do you mean?
- Come here, look at this.

1243
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,120
Hey, hey. Agh!

1244
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,800
- Agh, no!
- Take this! And this!

1245
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,760
Why don't you just go?

1246
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,840
I'm blind, Kate.

1247
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,840
I'm a burden.

1248
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,000
You can move faster without me.

1249
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,320
Sasha, please,
I know how you're feeling.

1250
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,360
No you don't.
You have no idea how I'm feeling.

1251
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,760
- I know this seems hopeless
- It is hopeless.

1252
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,560
No, it's not.
I'm gonna figure this out.

1253
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,000
'Figure it out. '

1254
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,840
Trust me, precious.

1255
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,720
If I haven't figured it out,

1256
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,800
you sure as shit aren't going to.

1257
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,760
What did you just say?

1258
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,280
I'm sorry, Kate.
I didn't mean to...

1259
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,560
No, no.
Wait a second.

1260
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,600
Back that up.

1261
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:47,240
Why do you think that you should be able

1262
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,440
to figure this out?

1263
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,600
I wasn't kidnapped.

1264
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:58,320
When I found out they were
putting people in here,

1265
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,440
I tried to blow the whistle on them.

1266
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,440
So they came after me.

1267
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:06,280
I escaped into the one place
they wouldn't dare follow me...

1268
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,280
in here.

1269
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,240
Poetic justice,
don't you think?

1270
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,600
Who are you?

1271
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,200
Max was right.

1272
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,320
Jerry was wrong.

1273
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,360
I exist.

1274
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,360
Oh my God.

1275
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,320
Sasha. Of course.

1276
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,400
Sasha is the nickname for Alexandra.

1277
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,560
Alex Trusk.

1278
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,480
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

1279
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,600
Damn it.

1280
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,840
This is the worst nightmare I've ever had.

1281
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,360
I just I wish I'd wake up.

1282
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:50,080
You really think this is all a dream?

1283
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,920
Definitely.

1284
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,520
In the real world I'd never kiss you.

1285
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,440
Oh, really?

1286
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,840
Yeah,
you're not my type.

1287
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,400
You're not my type,
either.

1288
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:31,760
Aa-ah!

1289
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,680
Ya-aa!

1290
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,400
Becky Young.

1291
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,400
Yeah.

1292
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,760
Rebecca Young.

1293
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,280
Yeah.

1294
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,920
Who... are you?

1295
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,440
Who am I?
I'm Simon Grady.

1296
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,920
Your parents hired me to find you.

1297
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,600
- Really?
- Yeah.

1298
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,600
Thank God.

1299
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,880
Yeah.

1300
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,760
I'm happy to see you too, Becky.
I really am.

1301
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,760
I've been wandering these rooms for hours.

1302
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,840
Ahhgh!

1303
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:21,720
You gotta love these parallel universes.

1304
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,760
You built this thing?

1305
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,800
I gave them the key to build it...

1306
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,640
better than they wanted.

1307
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,760
I gave them a real hypercube.

1308
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,280
How do we get out?

1309
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:37,600
Kate, this isn't a game.
There's no happy ending.

1310
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,920
This place is out of control.
It's not stable.

1311
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,960
Does this number mean nothing?

1312
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,320
6-0-6-5-9.
It's got to mean something.

1313
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,320
It's everywhere.

1314
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,600
I'm sorry, Kate.
It's over.

1315
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,840
No, it is not over.

1316
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,840
Not yet.

1317
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,280
I refuse to die here.

1318
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,400
What the hell?

1319
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,080
Oh my God.
We've got to move.

1320
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,000
Come on. We've got to get out of here.

1321
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,680
- Leave me.
- No, you're coming with me.

1322
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,400
Oh my God.

1323
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,400
We got to get out of here.

1324
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,000
Just go up as fast as you can.

1325
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,200
Faster, faster.
Keep going.

1326
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:51,000
Okay. Good girl.

1327
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,440
What the hell?

1328
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,280
Oh my God.

1329
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,760
Okay, we've got to get out of here.

1330
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,000
This is insane.

1331
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,640
It's Jerry's diagram.

1332
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,400
It's all the numbers.

1333
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,960
They're all just suddenly in here.

1334
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,680
It's Jerry's markings...

1335
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,200
that dead physicist's equations...

1336
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:52,920
and that damn colonel's corpse,

1337
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,640
just hanging there as if
we never even rescued him?

1338
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,080
Everything keeps appearing over and over again.

1339
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,640
Sasha...

1340
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:10,520
please, you have to have
some idea what this means.

1341
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,680
All the realities are starting to collapse

1342
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,760
into one space.

1343
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:18,640
And what happens to us
when they... 'it' collapses?

1344
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,240
The whole thing implodes.

1345
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,400
It's only a matter of time.

1346
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:28,400
I'm not gonna just stand here while it happens.

1347
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,880
I'm not leaving him behind.

1348
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,400
- Oh my God.
- Kate!

1349
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:40,440
- Let me go.
- Get the hell up here!

1350
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,400
Oh my God.

1351
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,080
Kate.

1352
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,040
We don't have much time.

1353
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,960
No.
I refuse to die here.

1354
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,960
I wish I had your spirit.

1355
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,920
Hello, gorgeous.
Miss me?

1356
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,440
Huh?
Come on in.

1357
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,440
The water's fine.

1358
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,320
Agh!

1359
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,560
Hello, Kate.

1360
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,040
Let her go.

1361
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,120
Who are you?

1362
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,040
Yeah, it's me...

1363
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,720
good old Simon.

1364
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,000
Do you remember this?
Do you?

1365
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,560
I've waited a long time for pay back.

1366
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,800
That was just...
seconds ago.

1367
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,480
Don't be so stupid, Kate.

1368
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,640
Time works differently in this place.

1369
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:53,240
Hey, just... okay.

1370
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,920
Just let her go.
She's just a kid.

1371
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,600
She'll be a dead little kid,
unless you come here to papa.

1372
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,960
Okay.

1373
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,720
Just let her go...

1374
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,520
we can figure something out, okay?

1375
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,560
You take her place.

1376
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,280
What do you want?

1377
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,920
I'm hungry.

1378
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,920
- Simon?
- Huh?

1379
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,320
There's no point.

1380
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,000
We're all dead anyway.

1381
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,120
Oh, oh.

1382
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,120
Okay.

1383
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,200
No!

1384
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,120
Oh, come on Kate.

1385
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,720
The fun's just beginning.

1386
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,080
Oh my God.

1387
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,000
What the hell?

1388
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,720
- Yah!
- Agh!

1389
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,840
I'm really gonna miss you.

1390
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,360
Jesus...

1391
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,800
Of course,

1392
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,480
6-0-6-5-9.

1393
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,520
It's an expiration date.

1394
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:50,280
He figured out when it's gonna implode.

1395
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,800
Leave me.

1396
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,240
Hello, Kate.
Welcome back.

1397
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,880
So, you figured it out.

1398
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,160
Yes, sir.

1399
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:44,160
No time to spare.

1400
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,240
The device... any luck?

1401
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:11,080
We'll take that to Darcy and see
if anything recorded on it.

1402
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:38,200
Sir?

1403
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,840
Yes, sir.

1404
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:42,160
Phase two is terminated.

1405
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,160
I see.

1406
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,960
Yes, sir.

1407
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,000
Right away, sir.
