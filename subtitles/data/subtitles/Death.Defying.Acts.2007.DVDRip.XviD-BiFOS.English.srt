<i>When I was very small,</i>

2
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,877
<i>I had a gift.</i>

3
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,789
<i>I saw things</i>
<i>other folk didn't see.</i>

4
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:37,886
<i>It was like looking into deep water</i>
<i>and seein' things on the other side.</i>

5
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,600
<i>As I grew up,</i>
<i>the gift vanished</i>

6
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,793
<i>just like</i>
<i>my mam said it would.</i>

7
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:47,401
<i>And I saw the world</i>
<i>as it really was</i>

8
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,509
<i>with all its sweet lies</i>
<i>and trickery.</i>

9
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,406
<i>Then the Great Houdini</i>
<i>came into our lives</i>

10
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,112
<i>and changed everything</i>
<i>forever.</i>

11
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,648
C'mon, Harry...

12
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,953
Don't do this to me again!

13
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,773
Up! Up!

14
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,280
Get the bloody thing
up now!

15
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,840
<i>... the Sun,</i>
<i>the Four Winds and the Sea...</i>

16
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,747
<i>... bowed down before</i>
<i>the Great Houdini.</i>

17
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,648
<i>He was a god.</i>

18
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,755
<i>That's what it said</i>
<i>in my comics.</i>

19
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,050
<i>If you were Houdini,</i>

20
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,558
<i>you wouldn't be livin'</i>
<i>in a place with a leakin'roof,</i>

21
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,855
<i>worryin'how to pay</i>
<i>the coal man.</i>

22
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,961
<i>And you wouldn't be sittin'</i>
<i>on a damp step outside the pawnshop</i>

23
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,660
<i>waitin'for your mam to</i>
<i>hawk her weddin'ring...</i>

24
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,360
<i>... yet again.</i>

25
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:32,962
<i>No.</i>

26
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:37,668
<i>You'd be inside somewhere</i>
<i>warm and cosy eatin' cake.</i>

27
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,172
Close that!
We've got work to do!

28
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,279
That's the wedding ring,
back in the window then, is it?

29
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,179
Only good use
I ever had for it.

30
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,377
Mary McGarvie.
A dream come true.

31
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,680
Not for you!

32
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:49,378
Benji!

33
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,082
Leave ma man alone,
ya Gypsy strumpet!

34
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,386
I wouldn't have your hand-me-downs
if you paid me!

35
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,290
You tarted-up hussy!

36
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,023
You frigid old piss-pants!

37
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,531
Floozy!

38
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,536
Bloody circumcision!

39
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,831
What?

40
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,439
It's in the Bible...

41
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,234
Oh, give me that!

42
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,244
<i>We were a real double act,</i>
<i>my mam and me.</i>

43
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,554
<i>It was just us against</i>
<i>the cruel world</i>

44
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,556
<i>livin'by our wits.</i>

45
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,163
'Scuse me.

46
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,460
'Scuse me, sir.

47
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:36,766
Woops, sorry!

48
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:37,961
Over here, Rose!

49
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,072
I told you
to wait on the corner!

50
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,367
- There y'are, sir.
- Thank you.

51
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,777
You'll be after your usual
posy of violets, Mr. Robertson?

52
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,889
'Aye. They were
always her favourites.

53
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,721
Oh! Pockets, eh?

54
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,630
- Thank you, dear.
- Thank you. See you tomorrow.

55
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:23,143
'To Charles, with never ending
love, Your Violet'.

56
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,450
<i>'You play the game</i>
<i>or you go under.'</i>

57
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,557
<i>That's what mam always said,</i>

58
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,549
<i>And if it wasn't for her,</i>
<i>we would've drowned long ago.</i>

59
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,062
'Deceased:'

60
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:43,658
'Violet Robertson
- died of heart-failure.'

61
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,972
You're that unfortunate.

62
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,366
It was your long lost aunt
a week ago, was it not?

63
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,176
My condolences, Mrs. McGarvie...

64
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,075
You're so kind...

65
00:06:55,915 --> 00:07:00,716
You'll be wanting to...
examine the Records, no doubt?

66
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:07,722
The information you need...
may be on the... tenth shelf...

67
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,023
Or even the eleventh...

68
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:19,136
It's the details of those dear
departed one later cherishes...

69
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,137
...don't you think?

70
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,641
'Cherishable details,'
Mrs. McGarvie.

71
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,637
How right you are.

72
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,359
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

73
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,166
Hello again!

74
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,672
Ah! Courtship!

75
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,864
Who's the baboon?

76
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,976
Who you callin' a baboon,
ya wee poof?

77
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,511
Enough monkey play!

78
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,910
No juveniles with us,
I trust?

79
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:07,008
Then this is your last chance
to see the Tantalising...

80
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:12,318
...Princess Kali
and her Dusky Disciple!

81
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,795
Oh, be still, girl!

82
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,211
At least that's
one of you decent!

83
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,903
Hurry! Hurry!

84
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,817
Where've you been?

85
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,022
Sorry!

86
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:33,130
Kali - Kasbah - Magicaram!

87
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,940
I'm receiving a message.

88
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,135
About time, eh?
I sent it a week ago!

89
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,146
I see a flower...

90
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,951
Gallery, mam...

91
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,351
Is there anyone here named...

92
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:52,950
...Rose?

93
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,152
'Aye! Up here! She's up here!
Darlin', get up!

94
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,961
That's a lovely pair of red knickers
you're wearing tonight, Rose!

95
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,465
Oh! Get away with you!

96
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,263
Prove her wrong, hen!

97
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,171
There is one I can see...

98
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,570
Such a lady!

99
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,273
Like a queen!

100
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,882
The lady's in a garden...

101
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,089
...a beautiful garden.

102
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,185
Third row...

103
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,093
She's like a flower herself.

104
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,995
Not a rose

105
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,796
a deep, dark flower

106
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,701
violet.

107
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,408
Violet's all alone.

108
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,917
But there's a space
beside her for another

109
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,918
one left behind
in this world.

110
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,920
For a moment, I saw a funny
wee man in a bowler hat...

111
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,253
Why, it's Mr. Charles Chaplin!

112
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,261
No. Another Charles...

113
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,867
...Charles Robertson.

114
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,775
Charles!

115
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,572
Charles!

116
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,178
Oh, I'm sorry, Charles.

117
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,882
Violet says you're not
looking after yourself.

118
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,383
Those cuffs are frayed.

119
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,987
Violet!

120
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,687
She wants to say something.

121
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,392
She says...

122
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,194
She's sorry her heart
'wasny stronger'...

123
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,197
Do you understand
what she means, Charles?

124
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,798
It's how she went!

125
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,798
Her heart gave out.

126
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,801
It's true. It's true.

127
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,504
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

128
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,615
Who's the one
who's lost his clock?

129
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,410
Have you lost something,
Charlie?

130
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,178
I lost my watch!

131
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,350
It comes...

132
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,654
It comes!

133
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,056
From another world,
it comes!

134
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,256
It comes!

135
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,358
Now!

136
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,471
There is an inscription,
oh wise one...

137
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,870
No, no, no.
Don't tell me!

138
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,677
I can see it...

139
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:31,882
'To Charles,
with never ending love... '

140
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,885
...Your Violet'.

141
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,891
There's a chill wind
in the garden.

142
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,295
- Violet has to go...
- Oh, no...

143
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,597
'Until we meet again.'

144
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,399
'Goodbye, Charles.'

145
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,600
Goodbye... Goodbye... '

146
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,540
Oh, don't go, Violet.

147
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,737
Don't cling to her, Charles.

148
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,542
Be patient...

149
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,343
Until you meet again...

150
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,942
<i>A glimpse of the afterlife?</i>
<i>Or just a glimpse of mam?</i>

151
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,055
<i>It didn't matter.</i>

152
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,747
<i>We gave them</i>
<i>what they wanted.</i>

153
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,253
<i>Showbiz isn't all</i>
<i>it's cracked up to be.</i>

154
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,557
<i>The manager skid-addled</i>
<i>and owed us for a whole month!</i>

155
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,564
<i>Mam said,</i>
<i>'See? That's men for you! '

156
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,565
<i>And so we ended up livin'</i>
<i>in a graveyard.</i>

157
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,466
<i>A wee bit before our time.</i>

158
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,571
What have you got to
laugh about?

159
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,770
The theatre's closed.

160
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,075
Those comics won't
fill your tummy!

161
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,379
It's just
a wee bit of fun, mam!

162
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,180
Oh, you sound
just like your father!

163
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,380
'Just a wee bit o' fun, hen! '

164
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,491
Then all of a sudden,
there was you!

165
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,087
Hurry up!

166
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,834
<i>Mr. Houdini was the greatest</i>
<i>trickster of them all...</i>

167
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,338
<i>... and the whole world</i>
<i>loved him for it.</i>

168
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,633
<i>You couldn't imagine</i>
<i>someone like that</i>

169
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,642
<i>could want</i>
<i>for anything at all.</i>

170
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,452
Oh, go on, mam.
Read to me.

171
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,755
Itjust says what's
in the picture.

172
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,363
You can read it yourself.

173
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,966
'On her death bed,
Houdini's beloved Mother... '

174
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,663
'... spoke her last words
to the Great Man himself.'

175
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,776
'Do Spirits Return? '

176
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,878
Houdini says -
'Prove it! '

177
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,272
'Now Famous Psychics try to
Discover Those Secret Words'

178
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:04,634
'Ten thousand dollars for whoever
transmits his mother's last words'

179
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,530
No one could pull off that one,
could they?

180
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,039
How much is
ten thousand dollars?

181
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,850
He's coming here!

182
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,349
To Edinburgh!

183
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,954
So he is...

184
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,959
<i>Me and mam thought</i>
<i>we could take on anyone</i>

185
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,420
<i>even the Great Houdini!</i>

186
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,569
Harry!

187
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,188
You still here?

188
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,790
Where else?

189
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,925
You look fine, Harry.

190
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,525
I look like shit, Mr. Sugarman.

191
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,647
Let's go!

192
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,849
Hurry up!

193
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,654
Hurry up!

194
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,508
Hello, Edinburgh!

195
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,930
Houdini!

196
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,946
Mr. Houdini!
We love you, Mr. Houdini!

197
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,247
We love you! We love you!

198
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,655
Welcome back to Scotland,
Mr. Houdini!

199
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,952
Thank you, son.

200
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,555
That monster Nessie
still here?

201
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,457
'Aye, she's still here.

202
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,058
Well, who don't you tell Nessie
that this Harry Houdini's gonna

203
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,259
tie a knot in her tail and
fling her into the Scottish Ocean?!

204
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,063
What about $10,000, Mr. Houdini?

205
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,466
Are you psychic, Hamish?

206
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,663
'Cos I never met a reporter yet

207
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,069
who didn't know the truth
before it happened!

208
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,175
Oh, I don't know about that.

209
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,709
You put me in touch with my dear,
departed mother and it's all yours.

210
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,710
- Still in good shape, Mr. Houdini?
- Never better!

211
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,405
They say you can take
a punch from any man.

212
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:04,811
Elbow these freeloaders!
Get rid of them!

213
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,214
You scared of ma boy's punch,
Mr. Houdini?

214
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,117
I'll take your punch, sonny!

215
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,816
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
give us some room please!

216
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,123
Watch yourself, Harry,
this mob can smell blood!

217
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,434
Go on, son!

218
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,836
Have you done it yet?

219
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,444
You did it, Houdini!!

220
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,955
<i>Yes, the whole world loved</i>
<i>Mr. Houdini.</i>

221
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,956
<i>But it could never be enough.</i>

222
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,857
<i>There was something</i>
<i>dark inside him.</i>

223
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:54,557
<i>And poor Mr. Sugarman's job was</i>
<i>to keep that dark side at bay.</i>

224
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,362
It's such an honour to
have you with us...

225
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,367
Hey!

226
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,131
Be careful with that trunk,
you schmuck!

227
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,397
Sorry, sir!

228
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,701
Mr. Houdini's very tired
after his journey.

229
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,400
I'll deal with it, boss.

230
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,511
Come on! Quick as you can!
Quick as you can!

231
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,015
There! Carefully...

232
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,212
A dollar!

233
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,915
Thank you, sir!
Thank Mr. Houdini!

234
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,721
Harry! Are you all right?

235
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,329
Harry!

236
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,133
Are you all right?

237
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,632
I think I can wipe my own arse,
Mr. Sugarman, thank you!

238
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,050
It's OK, Morry.

239
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,451
Nothin' to worry about.
The golden goose is still laying.

240
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,355
'Houdini's Mother Dies... '

241
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,755
'Houdini in Mourning.'

242
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,365
'Houdini Finds
Hope in Spiritualism.'

243
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,668
'Lt's a fake, says Houdini.'

244
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,077
A very private man...

245
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,188
'My greatest ambition is to live
and die being worthy of

246
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,299
the mother who bore me.'

247
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,206
Another bereavement,
Mrs. McGarvie?

248
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,304
I'm always happy for you to...

249
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:52,410
probe the higher shelves for
those 'cherishable details'.

250
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,254
I already have all
the details I need.

251
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,863
Listen to this...

252
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,870
'Madame Clare De Lune,
Psychic Extraordinaire... '

253
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,770
'... respectfully accepts
Mr. Houdini's Psychic challenge'.

254
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,273
Clare de who?

255
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,571
Clare de Lune,
it's French, goddamn it.

256
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,475
Get yourself an education,
Sugarman.

257
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,278
What do you think?
Do I look like a fruit?

258
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,783
Like a fruit?
You look beautiful, Harry.

259
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,680
I look like a fruit.

260
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,186
They've got class.
I like 'em.

261
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,383
If you wanna look like a fruit,
Morry, you wear 'em!

262
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:38,193
And as well you know,
I've got an education -

263
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,494
in Law and in Business Management.
I've got a Diploma.

264
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,692
I bought it in
your glorious country.

265
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,099
Harry, everyone's a fake.

266
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,100
As soon as you scratch the gold-leaf,

267
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,004
all of these so-called
psychics are just made of lead.

268
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,701
It's all hocus pocus,
mumbo jumbo.

269
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,108
- So?
- So why waste our time?

270
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,410
I don't want to be remembered
for a bunch of dumb stunts.

271
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,048
For once, this ain't about chains
and friggin' padlocks.

272
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,654
It's about science.

273
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,456
It's about proof!

274
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,658
You've been pushing yourself
too hard, Harry...

275
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,456
Oh, get off me!

276
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,457
See this?

277
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,463
This is from
the Scientific American.

278
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,659
The Scientific American!

279
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,067
And my psychic experiment
is science!

280
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,475
Showbiz is Showbiz, Harry.

281
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,372
It's not about science...

282
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,776
It's about nickels and dimes.

283
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,780
Nickels and dimes.

284
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,283
Yeah, well, you look after
the nickels and dimes

285
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,182
and I'll look after the science.

286
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,854
<i>Mistress of the Skies -
<i>that was my mam.</i>

287
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,346
Madam...

288
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,856
<i>She could just pluck</i>
<i>a character off a shelf</i>

289
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:17,155
<i>and act as swish as</i>
<i>the best of them...</i>

290
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:23,564
<i>... and just about manage</i>
<i>to convince herself.</i>

291
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,193
We've got two hours
to check the tank.

292
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,299
The boys'll be set
by the time we get there.

293
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,992
Curtain's at 8:00...

294
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:57,999
How's Security?

295
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,161
Like Mrs. Clam with a headache.

296
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,954
'I am with you, my Harry,
even in dreams.'

297
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:26,860
'Your little darling wife, Bess'.

298
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,161
'Little darling wife'.

299
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,590
Excuse me!

300
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,122
He's mine!

301
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,223
I do Mr. Houdini.

302
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,629
Who do you think you are?

303
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,032
Who do I think I am?

304
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,231
I'm the one who does all
the bloody work around here!

305
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,072
You little thief!

306
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,275
- I was just looking!
- Yeah, sure you were!

307
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,279
That's our audience you're
kickin' in the pants there,

308
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,678
Mr. Sugarman...

309
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,686
I'm sure she's OK.
You can let her go.

310
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,689
What's your name, kid?

311
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,321
Lost your voice, huh?

312
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,525
When did you last hear it?

313
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,029
Oh, wait, I know...

314
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,133
Help! Help!
I'm in here!

315
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,235
I'm in here!
I'm in here!

316
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,631
C'mon! Open up!

317
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,439
Open up! Open up!
Open up!

318
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,242
How's that for size?

319
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,244
Want a sandwich?

320
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,845
Yes please, Mr. Houdini!

321
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,345
The voice fits!

322
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,641
A little gummed up still,
but it works.

323
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,250
What else can you say?

324
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,052
Name's Benji, Mr. Houdini.

325
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,744
'Benji Mr. Houdini'.

326
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,651
Well, I'd drop the second part;
it's already spoken for.

327
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,758
Just plain Benji
sounds good to me.

328
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,759
'Just Plain Benji'
isn't much of a name either.

329
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:40,058
Well, we have a comedienne here,
Mr. Sugarman.

330
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,859
Maybe she can do the warm-up.

331
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,259
I'm not a comedienne,
Mr. Houdini.

332
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,461
No?
So what do you do for a living?

333
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,267
Rob banks? Train fleas?
Dance the Highland Fling?

334
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,466
And steal from
dressing rooms?

335
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,276
I'm a psychic...

336
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:58,076
Well, more a sort of disciple...

337
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,309
Oh, a psychic's sidekick, huh?

338
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:04,215
'The Tantalising Princess Kali
and her Dusky Disciple'

339
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,221
That's you, huh?

340
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,326
We were top of the bill
at McTavish's Palace!

341
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,724
Top of the bill
at The Palace, eh?

342
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,428
Well, I think I have a little
something for you too.

343
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:17,027
Tonight's performance.
Don't be late!

344
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,834
Thanks, Mr. Houdini!

345
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,742
My mam doesny do tricks, like.

346
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,042
It's real, Mr. Houdini.

347
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,146
It's no jiggery-pokery.

348
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,845
Solid gold. I'm sure
she's great, kid. Goodbye.

349
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,252
- She's got 'The Gift'.
- 'Bye, 'bye, now.

350
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,163
Fellow travellers.

351
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:52,965
Dear friends.

352
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,771
Modern Science tells us
that Life...

353
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:59,206
...had its beginnings in the gloomy
depths of the great oceans.

354
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:02,913
Our own little lives are
but a brief gasp...

355
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,713
...before we plunge back down into
that dreamy darkness

356
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,716
from which there is no return...

357
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,219
Or is there?

358
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:15,117
I, Harry Houdini, shall discover
the Truth for all of us!

359
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,925
Naked we emerged from
that sea of the unconscious...

360
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,726
...and that is how I now
propose to travel.

361
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,434
Lights, please!

362
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,043
Ladies and gentlemen...

363
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:46,355
I entreat you; do not attempt to hold
your breath in emulation of me...

364
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:53,962
May God guide me...

365
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,465
...and have mercy
on my immortal soul.

366
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:01,960
Mama...

367
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,072
Mama!

368
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,966
Harry!

369
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:32,994
Get him out!!

370
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,201
Bravo! Bravo!

371
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,517
Nearly two minutes over!

372
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,120
Then that's two minutes you
didn't know about, Morry.

373
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:58,222
You don't have to do this, Harry.

374
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,846
You don't have to push yourself
to the wire every time...

375
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,356
Yes I do!

376
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:27,478
I met Houdini!
I met Houdini!

377
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,877
I met him, ma!

378
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:33,582
He's got these eyes thatjust burn
through to the back of your head!

379
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,590
He's incredible, ma!

380
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,195
You got caught!

381
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:48,805
What did I tell you?

382
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,501
Rule number one:
Never get caught!

383
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,948
So what did you find out?

384
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,749
Or were you too busy
making eyes at him?

385
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:11,059
Do you think
I like livin' like this?

386
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:14,562
Surrounded by grime and filth
and other people's hand-me-downs?!

387
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,360
I want new things.

388
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,359
Nice things.

389
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,264
I want $10,000!

390
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,579
Did you find out anything, mam?

391
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,776
There wasn't a single personal
thing in his hotel suite.

392
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,078
Like he doesn't exist...

393
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,786
He has a fancy trunk
with his initials on...

394
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,894
The kind of trunk you
keep your secrets in.

395
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:48,595
A big trunk
that only takes a tiny wee key.

396
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,195
Now where would Mr. Houdini
keep a key like that, eh?

397
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,102
And this...

398
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,740
His mother.

399
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,448
It's a start.
I'll busk the rest.

400
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,053
Eat your tea now.

401
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,464
Next!

402
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,059
Good afternoon, Mr. Houdini.

403
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,171
I have, sir, a secret message.

404
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,170
It's from your mother.

405
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,475
It's in Hungarian,
isn't it, Jock?

406
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:32,969
You should have done
your homework, Hamish!

407
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,477
She didn't speak Hungarian -
she spoke German.

408
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,274
Next!

409
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,093
You're a hoofer.

410
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,996
Aye, sir! A hoofer, I am!

411
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,027
We're interviewing psychics.

412
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,230
Think of a number...

413
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,238
Message from your mama...

414
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,843
Very cold, very cold.

415
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,741
Message Little Harry,

416
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,644
growing old, growing old.

417
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:17,853
Arky, parky, tory roop.
Rang tang, toozy Jock.

418
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,550
Eerie, orie! Eerie, orie!
You are oot!

419
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,554
Macbeth. Act 1. Scene 1.
Right?

420
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,560
Alright, thank you very much
young ladies.

421
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:27,755
We'll let your mother know.

422
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,560
Out you go. Thank you now.
Very good.

423
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,361
She'll never forgive you,
Harry.

424
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,163
- Out you go.
- What did you say?

425
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,771
Forgive me for what?

426
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,965
I never hurt her
in my goddamn life!

427
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,468
What the hell's she
talking about, Sugarman?

428
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,076
10,000 American dollars.

429
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,270
That's what she was
talking about, Harry.

430
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,074
If God ever permitted an angel
to walk this earth,

431
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,477
it was my mother!

432
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,675
Ah, the Psychic's sidekick...

433
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:51,186
Do I have permission to kick our
audience in the pants this time?

434
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,880
Come on, kid. Clear off!

435
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,288
Mr. Houdini's had enough for
one day. Come on...

436
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,088
It's no' me. I told you.

437
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,161
It's my mam.

438
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:05,126
I'm sorry for the intrusion,
Mr. Houdini.

439
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,733
Mr. Sugarman, is it?

440
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,135
We have a psychic act
me and my daughter here.

441
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,944
Not such a wonderful act, really.

442
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,640
I wear a somewhat of
a revealing costume.

443
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:23,352
I pretend to see those
on the other side.

444
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,252
Sometimes I really do.

445
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,954
My mother would have called it
a travesty

446
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:30,458
a waste of a God-given gift.

447
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,359
She used hers for healing,
didn't she, Benji?

448
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,064
Maybe I should have made
more of mine. But...

449
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,368
there's no man at home and
there's bread to put on the table.

450
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:47,571
I'm sorry, Mr. Houdini.
I'm so deeply sorry for your loss...

451
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,574
Last night I dreamed a dream.

452
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:56,778
I saw someone I've never met,
in a place I've never been.

453
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,514
A lady in a garden.

454
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,525
Her hair was silver
and she was small...

455
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,324
wearing a black dress...

456
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,431
and she was waving as if...

457
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,137
beckoning someone to her.

458
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,330
Does that mean something to you,
Mr. Houdini?

459
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,442
It means you read
the New York Times, Mrs...

460
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,043
McGarvie.

461
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,639
It was The Herald Tribune,
actually.

462
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,441
That picture was
syndicated all over.

463
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,049
Sometimes it works.

464
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:29,146
Sometimes you have to help
it along. Is that a sin?

465
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,160
I read a page unwritten...

466
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,257
I hear words...

467
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,562
yet unspoken...

468
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,364
But they all seem like shapes...

469
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,569
and colours to me now...

470
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,481
I'm sorry.

471
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,605
Did you say something?

472
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,615
No, no. I...

473
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,315
It's you...

474
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,919
I think you're the one
we've been waiting for.

475
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,928
<i>It was if the Earth</i>
<i>stopped turnin'.</i>

476
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,923
<i>That's what they say in</i>
<i>the great romances, isn't it?</i>

477
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,335
<i>But we didn't know</i>
<i>the half of it.</i>

478
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,257
Are you sure you know
what you're doing, Harry?

479
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,552
Oh, come on,
it's got to be a sign.

480
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,251
You were there.
You saw her.

481
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,762
Now change that to
'scrupulous scientific conditions'.

482
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,457
'Scrupulous'.

483
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,068
There are more things
in Heaven and Earth

484
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:01,110
than in all your audit books,
Mr. Shakespeare.

485
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,314
More than $10,000?

486
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,614
Mr. Harry Houdini...

487
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:12,416
...announces the most extraordinary
Experiment ever staged

488
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,217
by modern science

489
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,321
that will prove beyond
all reasonable doubt...

490
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,123
the existence of an Afterlife.

491
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,637
Sealed inside this envelope,

492
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:31,835
Mr. Houdini has written
the last words spoken to him

493
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,240
by his dear, departed mother

494
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:38,342
known only to him,
and shared with no one...

495
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:47,853
This safe will be lodged
at the Royal Bank of Scotland...

496
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,552
until the day of
the Psychic Experiment,

497
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:55,359
which will be conducted under
scrupulous scientific conditions

498
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,059
in front of the world's press.

499
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,803
Mr. Houdini intends to contact
the departed soul of

500
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:03,804
his beloved mother...

501
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,708
We've died and gone to heaven!

502
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,421
Look at the Castle, mam!

503
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:29,124
And I can see right up Princes Street
all the way to the Scott Monument!

504
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,535
Oh! It smells like heather!

505
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,138
And it's all free!

506
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,331
Nothin' in this world's free.

507
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,640
Come Sunday, if we don't deliver
the 'secret words' our

508
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:44,236
Mr. Houdini wants to hear,
all this goes; itjust vanishes.

509
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,947
But he's taken
a real shine to us!

510
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,346
The plan's workin'.

511
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,547
That's as maybe.

512
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,247
Something's going on.

513
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:55,658
It was too easy.

514
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,759
I didn't do a thing.

515
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:00,657
Benji!

516
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,672
Oh. Come in...

517
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,669
Madam. From Mr. Houdini...

518
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,878
Why, thank you very much.

519
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:19,175
Madam.

520
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,180
What's it say?

521
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:26,881
He's inviting me
to take luncheon.

522
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,087
Mam! This is it!

523
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,488
This is what we want!

524
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,593
But what does Mr. Houdini want?

525
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:41,898
Would you stop skippin'
for a minute?

526
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,614
Excuse me,
we've got kids here!

527
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,617
Women and children! You got Male
and Female in the same cage here!

528
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,155
There ought to be
a law against it!

529
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,555
It's Nature, Mr. Sugarman!

530
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,160
Well maybe Nature should
learn a bit of decency.

531
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,660
Monkeys are just like
you and me.

532
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,263
You speak for yourself.

533
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,065
You're no different.

534
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,566
The Great Houdini says
'jump' - you jump.

535
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,864
You're just a dancing monkey!

536
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,671
Let's go and look
at the Aquarium.

537
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:22,177
They've got sharks and underwater
tortoises and all sorts!

538
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,276
Wanna know something, sweetheart?

539
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,977
What's that, Mr. Sugarman?

540
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,482
You ain't gonna take my
Mr. Houdini for that ten grand.

541
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:46,295
<i>Mam and I were</i>
<i>keepin'him guessin'.</i>

542
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:50,203
<i>Luckily men are fools for a bit</i>
<i>'o glitter in a borrowed frock.</i>

543
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,504
Madam...

544
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,002
Mrs. McGarvie...

545
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,011
Forgive the intimacy of
our little restaurant.

546
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:00,548
News-hounds are everywhere.

547
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,853
I've never stayed
in a place like this before.

548
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,053
Something to tell
the grandchildren.

549
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,253
You got the flowers OK?

550
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:09,950
Oh, enough for a wedding.

551
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,059
Won't you sit down, please?

552
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,857
Men don't spend money on flowers

553
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,057
just because they enjoy
the smell of them...

554
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,361
Oh, I just meant to be friendly.

555
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,163
Are you sure you
won't sit down?

556
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,866
Is this part of the audition?

557
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:25,370
Sit down, please.

558
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:41,984
Pick anything you like.

559
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,404
It's all in foreign.

560
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:55,300
Do what I do.

561
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,202
Pick a high number.
You can't go wrong.

562
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:04,447
That.
I'll have that one, please.

563
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,641
That's... bread, madam.

564
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:07,751
I'll have the same.

565
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,546
Bread all round.
Plain and simple.

566
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,348
Of course, sir.

567
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,353
Bread.
Plain and simple.

568
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,254
Champagne for the lady -
best in the house.

569
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,163
Mrs. McGarvie.

570
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:21,964
This isn't me - all of this...

571
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,760
I was raised
in Appleton, Wisconsin.

572
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:27,359
I sold papers, shined shoes,
and did conjuring tricks...

573
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,267
Just a regular Joe?

574
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:30,873
Well, you've done
your research, right?

575
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,568
You know everything there is
to know about me already.

576
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:36,377
Not everything.

577
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,381
A little old fashioned, maybe.
But I like 'em...

578
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,581
If you'll allow me...

579
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:54,391
I'm not a wee girl, Mr. Houdini.

580
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,201
Harry, please.

581
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,833
What is it you want...
Mr. Houdini?

582
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,534
I want to treat you as
the lady you so clearly are.

583
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,847
That's all?

584
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,245
You're special, Mrs. McGarvie.

585
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,246
You have a gift.

586
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:19,055
<i>The truth was,</i>
<i>she couldn't read him.</i>

587
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,048
<i>And she let him</i>
<i>get under her skin.</i>

588
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:24,456
We went on the Big Wheel and
Mr. Sugarman was sick!

589
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,164
Back where I come from,
Mr. Sugarman,

590
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:30,357
we always acknowledge a lady.

591
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,664
Mrs. McGarvie!
I do apologise.

592
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,966
I hardly recognised you.

593
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,172
I don't have the time

594
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,779
or the inclination to figure out
what it is you really want.

595
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:46,178
So I'll just leave you

596
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,977
and your Mr. Sugarman
to your silly games...

597
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,779
- Mrs. McGarvie. Please...
- Benji!

598
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,687
Mrs. McGarvie!

599
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,289
Harry! Come here, Harry...

600
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:56,484
If you run after her now
and make a scene...

601
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:58,094
it'll be all over
the papers by morning.

602
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,423
Then, where is your
great experiment? Hmm?

603
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:38,661
Harry!

604
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,868
Rise and shine!

605
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,771
Harry!

606
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,076
- What time is it?
- It's late.

607
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,177
Well what did you
let me sleep through for?

608
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,176
Get yourself a louder bell, too!

609
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,875
Gentlemen of the press,
1.00 o'clock.

610
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:58,181
Worshipful Company of
Locksmiths, 2.30,

611
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:01,416
and St. Andrew's Orphanage,
4.00 o'clock.

612
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,519
Buy a bunch of shoes
for the kids...

613
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:08,222
Shoes? Fine...

614
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,235
It's all right, mam.
He's gonna be ages...

615
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:27,243
Sorry, mam,
I couldn't help it!

616
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,648
Come on, kid!
Harry, do you want me to?

617
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,456
You want to look inside
Pandora's box, huh?

618
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,854
Take a peek
at the real Houdini.

619
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:45,266
All yours.
No psychic gifts required.

620
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:47,865
No?

621
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:51,064
You disappoint me.

622
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:54,977
Here's me thinking you
was the genuine article.

623
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:57,873
Solid gold - through and through.

624
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,108
I was embarrassed to ask.

625
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,519
I just needed something...

626
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,520
a personal item,

627
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,520
a wee token...
...a handkerchief.

628
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,124
That's all.

629
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:10,818
You see, it helps me
channel the energy...

630
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,519
my psychic energy...

631
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,130
Your 'psychic energy'?

632
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:18,933
I've seen mediums, crystal-gazers,
palmists, spirit-guides,

633
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,435
theatres fit to bust with
psychic energy, Mrs. McGarvie!

634
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:22,937
And you know somethin'?

635
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:26,440
Until somebody proves me wrong,
it's all moonshine!

636
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:29,444
Con-artists and cheap chislers
out to fleece poor folks

637
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,445
looking for
a little peace of mind!

638
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,650
So that's what this
whole charade's about?

639
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,352
Proving
'the Great Houdini' wrong?

640
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,655
I wasn't referring to you
personally, Mrs. McGarvie.

641
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:50,457
Here.
For your psychic energy...

642
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:51,863
Thank you.

643
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:57,473
10,000 dollars doesn't mean
much to you, does it?

644
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:58,472
It's just a game.

645
00:47:58,609 --> 00:47:59,906
Don't mean that much to me?

646
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,410
When I was a kid, we used to sleep
7 in a bed half this size!

647
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,107
Harry Houdini knows what
it means to be cold and hungry and

648
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,615
without a dime.

649
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:11,321
The difference is, you left all
that behind, didn't you?

650
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,118
This is the latest in 'slumber science,'
I'll have you know.

651
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,321
Internally sprung.
Just like me.

652
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:26,632
You never sleep that
peaceful again, do you?

653
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,438
I don't think I slept right
since I was nine years old.

654
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,541
Not at all?

655
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,041
Not a wink. Not since
I got a bed to myself.

656
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,338
You'll have to start
inviting people in.

657
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,845
I just can't hardly
remember the old days-

658
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:43,853
the real days.

659
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:45,852
Like it was
somebody else's dream...

660
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,059
Would you like to see
something real, Mr. Houdini?

661
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:18,121
- How'm I doin'?
- Oh, you could pass for a native.

662
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,222
When in Rome...

663
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:21,415
That's what my ma
always used to say.

664
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:24,527
I wish you could've met her.
You would've got on like a house on fire.

665
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,822
Don't go giving away
too much about her

666
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:28,424
they'll say we cheated.

667
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,226
Cheated? No.

668
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,631
I'm not like those fakers, Mary
- those cheap chiselers.

669
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:33,736
I'm like you.

670
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,929
Just trying
to earn an honest dollar.

671
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,638
Heads or tails?

672
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,038
Um... You choose.

673
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:45,944
Then I choose neither.

674
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,648
My penny for your dollar?

675
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,151
Heads or tails?

676
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:52,755
You choose!

677
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,763
Magic!

678
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:02,963
Magic.

679
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,061
Don't you love it?

680
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,762
I used to practice card tricks
and table magic 8 hours a day.

681
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:08,461
Really?

682
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:10,368
I studied locks and handcuffs
for 5 years solid.

683
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,974
I got to know 'em all
back to front.

684
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:14,373
I used run 10 miles a day,
push weights for 2 hours...

685
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,479
Couldn't have had much time
for anything else...

686
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:18,178
I made time.

687
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:21,479
You know, when I was a kid,
I was Ehrich, The Prince of the Air.

688
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:23,586
I told mama I'd be a flyer -
done that!

689
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,483
Told her I'd be a movie star -
done that too!

690
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:27,783
Swore I'd be the greatest
escape man in the world.

691
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:31,189
Made all my wishes come true -
grabbed my own piece of immortality!

692
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,796
Mr Houdini, sir,
can I get your autograph?

693
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,295
Of course you can.

694
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,605
Thank you!

695
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:44,707
- Right.
- Thank you!

696
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:50,704
You're OK. You got your own piece
of immortality right there.

697
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,508
- Who? Benji?
- Yeah.

698
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,718
You don't have children,
I can tell.

699
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,217
Make you old before your time.

700
00:50:57,354 --> 00:51:00,755
Oh, that ain't so.
You're the living proof.

701
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:04,749
'The Tantalising Princess Kali
and Her Dusky Disciple'.

702
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,453
Sounds like a fun act.

703
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:08,154
'Hard graft'.

704
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,663
If I fail, we starve.

705
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:13,861
Well, I fail and I die.

706
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:27,377
I don't think you want to get involved
with someone like me, Mr. Houdini.

707
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:33,987
Well, maybe I do...

708
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,642
Race you!

709
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,051
Wait for me!

710
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:16,260
It's locked!

711
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:18,060
Are you sure about that?

712
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:22,972
After you.

713
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:39,786
Benji!
Stay away from the edge!

714
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,091
Look at that!

715
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,895
It's beautiful.

716
00:52:58,441 --> 00:52:59,931
Ladies and Gentlemen!

717
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,443
I am to be suspended from
the roof of the very heavens -

718
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:07,049
with neither net nor harness!

719
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:11,844
Only a five-strand rope will prevent me
from plummeting earthwards,

720
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:14,650
dashing my brains to
a thousand pieces!

721
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,957
May God have mercy
on my immortal soul!

722
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,459
No!!

723
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:33,867
Oh, no, I can't!

724
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,272
Oh, come on.

725
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:37,380
A foot in both worlds...

726
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,285
Oh, I can't look!

727
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,332
Mary...

728
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:10,846
I guess
I want to make it last...

729
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,550
No!!

730
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,147
Mam!

731
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:25,955
How did you do that?

732
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,559
Magic.

733
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,868
Ladies and Gentlemen!
Ladies and Gentlemen!

734
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:39,271
I beg your indulgence!

735
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:43,778
The Maestro Houdini has been
taken ill with the condition

736
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:46,780
of severe nervous exhaustion!

737
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,277
There will be...

738
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:52,980
there will be a refund available
from noon tomorrow!

739
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,490
Mr. Houdini sends his regrets...

740
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:24,847
<i>To look into deep water and</i>
<i>see things on the other side</i>

741
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,048
<i>Mr. Houdini would've given</i>
<i>anything to do that.</i>

742
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,760
<i>It's a gift some are given</i>

743
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:33,353
<i>whether you want to or not.</i>

744
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,668
Mam!!

745
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:52,474
Help me!!

746
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,776
Mam!!

747
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:19,439
Not asleep?

748
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:24,738
What happened with him?

749
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,042
Nothing happened 'with him'.

750
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,852
Harry's a gentleman.

751
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,749
So you didn't get the key, then?

752
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:37,851
I'm not sure I care so much
about the key anymore...

753
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:41,655
We're in it for the money,
remember

754
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:45,063
not for a roll in the hay like
you did with my Dad.

755
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,164
<i>That was when I saw it for real</i>

756
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:53,271
<i>Mam was in love.</i>

757
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:55,769
<i>And the trouble</i>
<i>with love is this</i>

758
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,779
<i>Some people get left out.</i>

759
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,214
'Harry Houdini Disappears! '

760
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,519
'Harry Houdini Misses Show! '

761
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:05,718
'Harry Houdini Messes Up! '

762
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,723
This whole psychic thing
is taking over.

763
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,722
Do you hear me?
It's taking over!!

764
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:13,827
These are from your wife!

765
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:15,624
Do you remember you had a wife?

766
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,633
She's wiring you twice a day

767
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,736
and you're going ga-ga over some schiksa
with a cute line in chat!

768
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,428
Mrs. McGarvie's a lady...

769
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:24,437
...and I won't
have you forget that!

770
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:28,041
We've got to get
our priorities in order!

771
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,146
All right, Harry.

772
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,050
I quit!

773
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,845
You want to play poker
with me, Morry?

774
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:44,150
First, I'm 'pushing it
to the wire'

775
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:48,159
and now the 'psychic'
thing's taking over.

776
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:53,162
About time you got your
priorities sorted, don't you think?

777
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:58,271
C'mon, buckle me up.

778
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,736
Put your shoulders back.

779
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,047
You're walkin' like an old man,
ya mustache Pete!

780
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:54,361
<i>It was up to me and Mr. Sugarman to</i>
<i>keep things on the right path.</i>

781
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,591
<i>The Great Houdini had</i>
<i>fallen for mam, all right.</i>

782
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:03,194
<i>But it was as</i>
<i>if he didn't want to admit it</i>

783
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:04,897
<i>or couldn't.</i>

784
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:23,817
<i>Maybe the secret that Mr. Houdini</i>
<i>had locked away in his heart...</i>

785
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,520
<i>was going to be a way out</i>
<i>for all of us.</i>

786
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:54,848
Mr. Houdini gets some funny ideas
in his head sometimes, you know.

787
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:57,152
Seven year itch, Mr. Sugarman.

788
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:59,261
All marriages go
through a rocky patch.

789
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:02,364
Mr. Houdini has a most
exceptional marriage.

790
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:04,758
Mr. And Mrs. Houdini
are soul mates

791
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:06,368
they're like brother and sister.

792
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:08,163
There's the problem, then.

793
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:10,169
That sort of talk
give you a thrill, does it?

794
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:11,671
What do you want, Mr. Sugarman?

795
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:13,571
What do I want?

796
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,374
Do you know what this is?

797
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:24,384
This is five hundred
Scottish pound notes.

798
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,782
I want you to take them...

799
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,186
...and I want you to disappear.

800
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,493
I'm not sure I want to disappear.

801
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,293
Yeah, you do.

802
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:40,302
What schtick 'you gonna pull to earn
that ten thousand dollars, eh?

803
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:42,996
It's not gonna happen.
It's specific

804
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,606
specific words he wants to hear.

805
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,504
Take the money.

806
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,906
It's not on offer forever.

807
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:53,506
If I fail Mr. Houdini's challenge,
you'll never see me again anyway.

808
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,208
So why are you so worried?

809
01:00:57,453 --> 01:00:58,818
He's right.

810
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,347
You are special.

811
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,049
Thank you very much.

812
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,354
You don't know how special.

813
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,464
You have no idea.

814
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,267
But you're going to find out.

815
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:17,566
You don't scare me, Mr. Sugarman.

816
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,272
We're going dancing.

817
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:24,375
Dancing? Oh!

818
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:29,076
Oh, yes. It's a dance he's
taking you on all right.

819
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,980
You're way out of your depth
on this one, Mrs. McGarvie

820
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:36,587
believe me.

821
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:03,952
We're all incognito.

822
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:05,945
Polka! Polka!

823
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:07,750
C'mon, dance!
We've all got to dance!

824
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,755
Shake a leg, Mr. Sugarman!

825
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,760
Come on, ya old mustache Pete!

826
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,662
What do you think?

827
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:20,860
Do people choose the night
to do strange things,

828
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:22,766
or is it the dark
that makes 'em act funny?

829
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,874
- It's the night, Harry.
- Of course.

830
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,976
You do things you
wouldn't normally do

831
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,772
ask all kinds of questions.

832
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,272
Like the ones
you never asked last night?

833
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:34,976
Foxtrot!

834
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,085
I've had enough!

835
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:43,487
Like men friends?

836
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:45,093
Fathers

837
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:48,292
Mr. McGarvies. You never asked.

838
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,399
Maybe I didn't want to
know the answers.

839
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:55,397
Waste of time, all three of them.

840
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,140
Haven't seen him this crazy...

841
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,144
since his mother died.

842
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:08,043
That's not 'crazy', Mr. Sugarman.

843
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:10,345
That's 'love'.

844
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:16,658
You're a good dancer.

845
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,056
I've never danced
like this before.

846
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,254
I thought you'd have a girl
in every port.

847
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:22,958
No.

848
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:24,566
Tango!

849
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:47,780
You'll be leaving, won't you?

850
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:49,186
Montreal.

851
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,485
Final date.

852
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:52,093
Then we all go home.

853
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:53,695
Chicken soup for supper.

854
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,298
Is it Mrs. Houdini
who makes this soup?

855
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,526
Cook makes the soup.

856
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,434
Mrs. Houdini serves it up.
You'd like her.

857
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:05,636
I can't see us
washing dishes together.

858
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:07,538
Maid does the dishes.

859
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,542
Things change, Mary.

860
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:12,648
I'm the Great Houdini!
I make things the way I want 'em to be.

861
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:13,840
You can't.

862
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:16,543
- Oh, I can. Believe me.
- Stop it!

863
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,748
This is real.
I'm real...

864
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,857
- What's happening to me?
- You're dancing, Mary.

865
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,357
Well, I don't want to
dance anymore!

866
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:35,768
Hey...
Don't worry, kid.

867
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:37,668
There's no future in it.

868
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:42,669
I've got something
that might interest you...

869
01:04:58,628 --> 01:04:59,925
Mam!

870
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:06,935
Mr. Sugarman doesny like you

871
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,037
says you're just a gold-digger.

872
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:11,639
You don't listen to any word
that Mr. Sugarman says.

873
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:12,934
Got it?

874
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:14,937
But, mam...

875
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:17,542
- Mam?
- What?

876
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,546
Mr. Sugarman's on our side.

877
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,351
Go on, mam...

878
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,774
A dress...

879
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,927
It's his mother...

880
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:08,127
She looks like you...

881
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,525
You're the absolute image of her,

882
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:13,234
when she was young.

883
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:15,428
Took my breath away.

884
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:22,238
Our Mr. Houdini was closer to his mother
than most sons even dream of.

885
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,245
Maybe all this does
something for you? Hm?

886
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:31,546
Like I said, Mrs. McGarvie

887
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,249
way out of your depth.

888
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,661
I thought you people were smart.

889
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:48,269
We are.

890
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:50,269
We're here for the star prize.

891
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,271
But you need the words.

892
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:54,171
You need his mother's dying words...

893
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,471
- It doesn't matter, mam...
- No, no...

894
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:59,713
I'd put on his mam's pinny
if I had to

895
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,909
I'd dress him, feed him,
clean him - whatever it takes.

896
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,718
You want me gone?

897
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:09,122
Well, you better start helping me,
Mr. Sugarman.

898
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:11,924
If anyone knows the words

899
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:13,119
you do.

900
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:15,127
Win the 10 grand
and you disappear. Right?

901
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:17,129
That was always the deal.

902
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,936
I used to be a nice man, you know.

903
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:24,436
Can you believe it?

904
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,935
I just got old and mean.

905
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:38,350
There aren't any words...

906
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:40,551
At least, if there were...

907
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:42,748
Harry Houdini never heard them.

908
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,450
He was doing a show...

909
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:46,561
Oh, he talks like he was there

910
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:48,560
He gives you every detail,
makes himself weep.

911
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,665
I've heard it a million times.

912
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,360
His big regret.
His deepest guilt.

913
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:56,369
The moment
his mother needed him most...

914
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,402
...he wasn't there.

915
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,807
<i>At last...</i>

916
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:11,920
<i>... our Mr. Houdini's secrets</i>
<i>were out in the open.</i>

917
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:19,519
<i>The question was;</i>
<i>what would mam do with his future?</i>

918
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:22,724
<i>Give him a glimpse of</i>
<i>the afterlife?</i>

919
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:25,629
<i>Or a bitter-sweet taste</i>
<i>of the here and now?</i>

920
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:29,129
<i>Love or money?</i>

921
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:33,633
The safe is untouched.
You have my word on it.

922
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,040
'Aye, chief constable.
Agreed.

923
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,540
Mr. Houdini asks that you wear
his mother's wedding dress, madam

924
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:46,851
in order to channel the psychic energy,
you understand.

925
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:56,055
Look at it, child.

926
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:58,760
Just look at it.

927
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,400
He doesn't want me.

928
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,905
He just wants his mama.

929
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:14,006
- Mr. Houdini?
- Mr. Houdini!

930
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,412
Mr. Houdini!

931
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:16,813
What do you hope to prove
by this experiment?

932
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:18,510
Well, well,
the 'psychic reporter'.

933
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:19,916
We know the truth before it happens,

934
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:21,022
- isn't that right, Mr. Houdini?
- Not this time.

935
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,522
This experiment
is nothing less than

936
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:25,024
a battle between Love
and Death, gentlemen.

937
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,129
Is Death final
or will Love triumph?

938
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:28,423
Place your bets please!

939
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:31,226
What odds would you put on that,
Mr. Houdini?

940
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:36,229
Well, there's a headline, boys...
Houdini says: 'ls Death Final? '

941
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:40,637
Ladies and gentlemen...

942
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:42,835
...fellow Investigators.

943
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,442
The aim of the Scottish Institute
for Psychical Research...

944
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:49,244
is to evaluate the evidence
for the paranormal

945
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:52,445
under the strictest
scientific conditions.

946
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:54,852
I assure you,
ladies and gentlemen

947
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:57,458
no phantom escapes us!

948
01:09:58,093 --> 01:09:59,958
We want Houdini!

949
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:16,173
As my dear mother lay dying

950
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:19,975
departing this Earth
for a better place

951
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:22,777
she spoke her
last sweet words to me

952
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,482
her devoted son.

953
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:29,082
Those words are
engraved upon my heart...

954
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,785
My heart,
ladies and gentlemen...

955
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:35,688
Those words are known only to me.

956
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:40,399
If Mrs. McGarvie's
psychic gift is genuine,

957
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:43,505
God willing, she shall receive those
last words from the Other Side

958
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,800
and transmit them to us today.

959
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,211
<i>Mam looked beautiful...</i>

960
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:58,911
<i>Like an angel...</i>

961
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:02,054
<i>Maybe Mr. Houdini saw her...</i>

962
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:05,560
<i>or maybe he saw</i>
<i>his own sweet mother.</i>

963
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,157
<i>It didn't matter.</i>

964
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:14,861
<i>In that moment, she was everything</i>
<i>he'd been waiting for.</i>

965
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:24,679
There is no trickery here,
ladies and gentlemen.

966
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:27,278
There is only faith and hope.

967
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:30,778
Mrs. McGarvie.

968
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:32,477
Are you ready?

969
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,805
Mama, can you hear me?

970
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:02,544
Dear little mother.

971
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,653
Mama, please try.

972
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,050
Ehrich's here.

973
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,156
Your good boy's here...

974
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:53,094
I can't do this...

975
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:54,499
I can't take your money.

976
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:56,399
Mary, wait!

977
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:11,749
Ehrich! Ehrich!

978
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,946
Where are you?

979
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:16,057
Go to your mother!

980
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:18,352
I need you!

981
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,453
Come, Ehrich.

982
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:26,361
Your Mama's so alone -
so afraid.

983
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:30,162
Ich bin hier, Mama.

984
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:32,671
Wo bist du?

985
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:36,476
Why you not come to me?

986
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:39,674
- Mama, I'm here.
- Where are you?

987
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:41,976
Mein gutes Kind.

988
01:13:42,117 --> 01:13:44,779
- Mama, I tried to get to you.
- I can't see you!

989
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,581
- I tried to get there.
- Mama can't see you!

990
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:48,587
I had to finish the show.

991
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,086
Mama, I'm sorry!

992
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:53,592
I'm sorry, mama.

993
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:58,189
Es tut mir leid, Mama.
Es tut mir leid...

994
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:01,530
Mama, forgive me.
Mama...

995
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:08,635
Forgive me...

996
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,158
He's waitin' for you

997
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,354
the Angel with fire-red hair.

998
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,465
Got wings too.

999
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:34,562
Clock says noon -
sun goes black.

1000
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:36,261
Watch out!

1001
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,373
Here he comes!

1002
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:40,673
Benji!

1003
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:49,175
The envelope!
The envelope!

1004
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,478
The paper is blank!

1005
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:52,883
There's naught on the paper!

1006
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:55,182
There are no words!

1007
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,292
Can you explain this please?

1008
01:14:57,726 --> 01:15:00,320
Mr. Houdini? Explain!
What does it mean?

1009
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,131
To my eternal shame...

1010
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,428
I never got there.

1011
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:12,137
I was too late!

1012
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:13,832
I'm sorry...

1013
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:15,238
Harry!

1014
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:17,242
Are you all right, Harry?!

1015
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,563
<i>It wasn't death that scared</i>
<i>Mr. Houdini.</i>

1016
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,060
<i>He'd been diving into</i>
<i>deep water all his life.</i>

1017
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:44,263
<i>What scared him was the truth.</i>

1018
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:48,868
<i>It wasn't his body</i>
<i>that was in chains</i>

1019
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:51,676
<i>It was his heart.</i>

1020
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:48,863
God have mercy
on my immortal soul...

1021
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:39,151
Thanks for the money.

1022
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:44,754
Or have you come to
take it back?

1023
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:46,952
It's not really about
the money, is it?

1024
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:48,756
Now look what you've done to me.

1025
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:50,865
I only made you fall in love...

1026
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,864
- Don't flatter yourself.
- I'm sorry.

1027
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,560
That's all fine, then.

1028
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:57,365
Your Mama forgives you.

1029
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,064
- Now you can get out!
- Mary...

1030
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:02,506
That was not love.
That was infatuation.

1031
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,006
Another dance.

1032
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:07,411
What was it?
A Polka or a Foxtrot?

1033
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:11,711
Another fling.
Just another fling.

1034
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:15,218
But it never quite
happened, did it?

1035
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:18,824
- Why was that?
- I'd never been there before.

1036
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,621
I didn't understand
what was happening...

1037
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:21,626
Don't touch me!

1038
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:24,027
I didn't mean that.
That ain't what I want.

1039
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:26,430
So what does
the Great Houdini want?

1040
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:28,536
'Coz you don't want me.

1041
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:33,935
I'm not your little darlin'-wife,
and I'm certainly not your mama!

1042
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:35,536
Mary, I'm afraid...

1043
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:37,338
Afraid of what?

1044
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:38,343
Of me?

1045
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,845
I'm afraid of myself.

1046
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:42,449
Of what I feel for you,
what I want...

1047
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,546
I love you, Mary...

1048
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:52,656
But it's just shameful...

1049
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:56,055
Shameful?
Who taught you that?

1050
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:02,602
It's not shameful, Harry.

1051
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:05,799
It's what men and women do!

1052
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:09,908
It keeps the winter at bay...

1053
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:12,206
...the loneliness at bay.

1054
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:16,208
And sometimes,
if you're really lucky

1055
01:19:17,552 --> 01:19:22,216
down amongst the sweaty sheets you
find a tiny bit of true human love.

1056
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:26,217
Did you ever find it?

1057
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:28,222
That tiny bit of love?

1058
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:29,728
No.

1059
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,827
Not once.

1060
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:43,637
They say it's easy, Harry.

1061
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:45,644
They say it's like falling...

1062
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,646
No, falling's easy...

1063
01:19:48,383 --> 01:19:50,851
I don't know if I've got
the nerve for this.

1064
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:56,047
Me neither.

1065
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:13,972
Do you know what it was
made me fall for you?

1066
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:18,579
I mean really you...

1067
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:24,076
You looked so fierce.

1068
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,584
A fighter.

1069
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:31,383
I never much liked me.

1070
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:35,692
Well I do.

1071
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,909
It's easy, isn't it?

1072
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,718
Just like falling...

1073
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:21,075
<i>Mr. Houdini never asked</i>

1074
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:23,973
<i>about the strange words</i>
<i>that came out of me.</i>

1075
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:27,775
<i>He never asked where</i>
<i>I got them from either.</i>

1076
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:31,180
<i>He believed in me.</i>

1077
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:02,449
Harry...

1078
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:17,260
You'll catch your death!

1079
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,859
No. Quite the reverse.

1080
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:08,439
So...

1081
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:10,744
Off to Montreal, is it?

1082
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:13,347
Last one. Last time...

1083
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:15,950
No promises.

1084
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:18,153
No.

1085
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:26,658
You saved me, Mrs. McGarvie.

1086
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:30,464
You saved yourself, Mr. Houdini.

1087
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:36,577
You saved me too.

1088
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:01,626
Lost your voice, huh?

1089
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:04,629
When did you last hear it?

1090
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,849
Take care of your mama for me.

1091
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,852
Hey, I'll see you again.

1092
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:20,045
Harry...

1093
01:24:39,307 --> 01:24:40,774
Ma'am...

1094
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:13,136
Angel with fire-red hair!

1095
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,640
Clock says noon!
Sun goes black!

1096
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:18,245
Watch out!
Here he comes!

1097
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,041
Just gave him what he wanted.
It was easy...

1098
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:25,348
You're goin' soft, you are...

1099
01:25:26,988 --> 01:25:31,049
It's like Mr. Sugarman said -
it's all just showbiz mumbo-jumbo.

1100
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:34,353
All we've got is
what we can touch and see.

1101
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:40,062
That's my girl...

1102
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:50,873
<i>When I was very small,</i>

1103
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:53,073
<i>I had a gift.</i>

1104
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:56,878
<i>I saw things</i>
<i>other folk didn't see.</i>

1105
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:00,819
<i>As I grew up,</i>
<i>the gift vanished...</i>

1106
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:03,014
<i>... just like</i>
<i>my mam said it would.</i>

1107
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,228
<i>But mam was wrong.</i>

1108
01:26:12,867 --> 01:26:14,425
Let 'em get a good look, Morry.

1109
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:16,036
Mr. Houdini!

1110
01:26:23,278 --> 01:26:26,338
Are you going to follow
in your mother's footsteps, Benji?

1111
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:28,142
Benji! Give us the look!

1112
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:30,251
You know, the psychic look. Yes!

1113
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:33,650
Just got the message direct
from Heaven!

1114
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:44,265
- Bravo!
- Get back!

1115
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,066
Hello, Montreal!!

1116
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:50,268
Mr. Houdini!

1117
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,464
I'm a student at the College here -
I'm studying Business Management.

1118
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:53,471
Business management, huh?

1119
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:55,576
My friend here wants to shake
your hand too, Mr. Houdini.

1120
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,871
Pleased to meet you, Mr. H.
You're a man who can take a punch, right?

1121
01:26:58,012 --> 01:26:59,070
Mr. Houdini
can take any man's punch!

1122
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,011
Get these kids out of here!

1123
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:09,924
Isn't that right, Mr. Houdini?

1124
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:10,524
What did you say?

1125
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:12,319
Trick or treat?

1126
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:16,923
KO'd in the first round!

1127
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:23,427
<i>Mam, what's wrong?</i>

1128
01:27:33,281 --> 01:27:35,545
Back! Get back! Get back!
Get back!!

1129
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:37,651
I didn't mean to
hit him so hard!

1130
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:40,546
- Oh, saw that one comin'...
- Someone get a doctor!!

1131
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:42,849
Yes, sir!
Right away, sir!

1132
01:27:43,391 --> 01:27:45,552
You're going to be OK, Harry.
You'll be fine.

1133
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:46,951
I don't know, Morry...

1134
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:49,655
Won't somebody call
a bloody doctor?!

1135
01:27:49,797 --> 01:27:51,264
This time I keep falling...

1136
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:53,162
You're going to be fine, Harry...

1137
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:55,963
Oh, God forgive me...

1138
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:58,267
I told them, Harry...

1139
01:27:58,806 --> 01:28:00,706
...that stuff about your mother.

1140
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:02,309
I told them.

1141
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:06,811
I know. I know you did,
Mr. Sugarman...

1142
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:10,513
Catch me...

1143
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:13,572
<i>The Great Houdini</i>
<i>changed our lives...</i>

1144
01:30:14,108 --> 01:30:16,269
<i>... and for a wee short while,</i>

1145
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:18,777
<i>we taught him how to love.</i>

1146
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:21,973
<i>And me and mam...</i>

1147
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:24,882
<i>We had the here and now...</i>

1148
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,083
<i>And we had each other.</i>
