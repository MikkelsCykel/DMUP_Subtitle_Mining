1
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:27,769
GSW.

2
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:31,606
That's what the hospitals call it.

3
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:34,150
Gunshot wound.

4
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:38,362
Doctor has to report it
to the police.

5
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:42,784
That makes it hard
for guys in my line to get...

6
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:45,578
..."quality health care. "

7
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:54,754
Not many men know
what their life's worth.

8
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,172
I do.

9
00:01:56,631 --> 00:02:00,927
Seventy grand.
That's what they took from me.

10
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,764
And that's what
I was going to get back.

11
00:02:29,914 --> 00:02:32,583
They say, "Time heals all wounds. "

12
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:36,879
You'd think, after five months
of lying on my back...

13
00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:40,216
...I'd give up
any idea of getting even.

14
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:42,927
Just be a nice guy, call it a day.

15
00:02:45,263 --> 00:02:49,934
Nice guys are fine. You got to have
someone to take advantage of.

16
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:52,103
But they always finish last.

17
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:01,112
Help a cripple.
Thank you, sir.

18
00:03:01,487 --> 00:03:04,615
Help a Vietnam vet walk again.

19
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:09,370
Help a cripple.
Thank you, sir.

20
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:12,373
What the fuck you doing?
Get the fuck out!

21
00:03:12,623 --> 00:03:15,168
Shut up. I cured you.

22
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:18,713
Cocksucker.

23
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:27,555
- What do I owe you?
- Two ninety-eight.

24
00:03:45,323 --> 00:03:48,576
Son of a...
Hey, my cigarettes!

25
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:24,320
Sorry, sorry. Pardon me.

26
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,690
Thank you.

27
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,904
One hundred...

28
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:08,364
...two hundred...

29
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:09,866
...three hundred.

30
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,201
Have a nice day, Mr. Johnson.

31
00:05:12,994 --> 00:05:14,912
Excellent fit, sir.

32
00:05:15,204 --> 00:05:16,998
And how will you be paying?

33
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:51,616
I'll give you $900.

34
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:53,409
Let me see that Magnum.

35
00:05:57,872 --> 00:05:58,706
That's it.

36
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,023
$400 and the gun.

37
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,153
I'll need to see I.D.

38
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:31,072
Of course.

39
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:48,381
I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson,
this card's been canceled.

40
00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:50,049
Impossible.

41
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:53,094
Do you have another form
of payment?

42
00:06:53,302 --> 00:06:54,804
Try it again.

43
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:07,710
Old habits die hard, I guess.

44
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:13,216
If you don't kick them,
they kick you.

45
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:16,719
Ain't marriage grand?

46
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:45,414
Porter.

47
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,751
You're not dead.

48
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:53,631
What are you going to do?
Kill me?

49
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:03,743
Not now.

50
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:08,748
You're cleaning up.

51
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:39,524
Val still wants to talk to you.

52
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:44,278
Sorry, babe.

53
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:48,658
Shall I tell him
to call back again?

54
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:53,162
No, I'll talk to him.
Shut him up anyway.

55
00:12:58,668 --> 00:13:01,337
Yep, same as always. You?

56
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:03,256
Yeah, good, good.

57
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:06,384
Why? Are you there now?

58
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:13,099
Don't sweat it, Val.
We all look alike to them.

59
00:13:15,393 --> 00:13:17,979
Same crew. The Chows.
Twice a week.

60
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:22,400
Tuesday and Friday, between 11 and 12.
Always the same route.

61
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,735
Chinese money laundry.

62
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:30,074
How much in the case?

63
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,661
Anywhere between 340 and half a mill.

64
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,251
How much do you need?

65
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:43,379
We split it 40-40.

66
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:46,966
I mean, how much do you need
to buy your way back?

67
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:52,597
Into the syndicate.

68
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,224
How much?

69
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,143
- The Outfit?
- Whatever.

70
00:13:57,351 --> 00:13:59,771
Jesus. You know everything.

71
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:02,273
Hi, sweetie.

72
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:05,610
130 grand.

73
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:18,581
The Chows won't go to the cops.
They keep everything in-house.

74
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,416
They don't feel pain.

75
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,711
You notice anything about those guys?

76
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,964
They look nasty.
Probably kung fu motherfuckers.

77
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:30,843
- Did I miss something?
- They weren't wearing seat belts.

78
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:35,223
We'll hit them on Friday.

79
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:52,907
Hubba, hubba, hubba!

80
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:38,453
Lookie here.

81
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:50,298
How's that pileup taste?

82
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:56,554
Daddy brought home the bacon, baby.

83
00:16:04,187 --> 00:16:05,021
Val!

84
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:06,898
What?

85
00:16:22,455 --> 00:16:26,584
After kicking a Chow's ass,
you want to do it again.

86
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:47,772
140 grand.

87
00:16:48,523 --> 00:16:49,732
140 apiece.

88
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:51,609
Total.

89
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:54,779
Total?

90
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:02,078
That's 70 grand?
That's not enough.

91
00:17:02,286 --> 00:17:06,165
Is for me.
I'm taking a few months off.

92
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:10,837
I'm up short. Sixty short.
Fucking slants!

93
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:12,964
Should have hit them Tuesday.

94
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:14,757
Fuck!

95
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,218
We got away clean.

96
00:17:18,344 --> 00:17:20,263
And got something to show for it.

97
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:23,975
Be grateful for what you get,
rule number one.

98
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,939
Yeah, rule number one.

99
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:40,241
What?

100
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:49,125
Everything's cool.

101
00:17:50,376 --> 00:17:52,670
Just not enough! All right?

102
00:17:52,962 --> 00:17:54,547
Never is, Val.

103
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:58,509
Baby, just put the money
in the car, will you?

104
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:13,316
I can't fucking believe it.
You know what, Porter?

105
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:16,444
This is funny.

106
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:18,529
This will kill you.

107
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:22,950
It's always 140.

108
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:31,334
Someone ought to give me a Ph. D.

109
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:39,759
Jesus! Wait till I'm out
of the fucking way!

110
00:18:51,145 --> 00:18:53,064
Everything's cool, baby.

111
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:06,160
You were great.
Everything's cool. Give me...

112
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,329
Okay, keep the gun.

113
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:13,042
That's it. Everything's cool.
It's just like we planned.

114
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:16,921
Come on.
Don't fall apart on me now.

115
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:19,423
There we go.

116
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:33,813
I bet you got a lot of questions
rattling in your head.

117
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:41,904
Lynn did not understand.

118
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:44,657
I don't know.

119
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:48,411
Wives get funny
when it comes to girlfriends.

120
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,373
What?

121
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,585
I didn't get that.

122
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:58,171
You got it.

123
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:33,831
Come on, Miss Porter.
I don't have all day.

124
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:56,229
Is Miss Porter here?

125
00:20:57,814 --> 00:20:58,856
Mrs. Porter.

126
00:21:02,944 --> 00:21:03,903
Yeah, whatever.

127
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:09,617
Motherfucker!

128
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:15,373
Get up. Turn around.

129
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,125
Come on.

130
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:23,381
What have we got here?

131
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27,552
How much in here?

132
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:29,262
Two grand.

133
00:21:29,512 --> 00:21:31,305
- What's in here?
- Helium.

134
00:21:31,597 --> 00:21:33,850
What do you think it is?
It's heroin.

135
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:44,444
Shit. Oh, shit.

136
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:48,406
Val Resnick.

137
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,074
Where is he?

138
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,619
You want to know where he is?

139
00:21:54,787 --> 00:21:55,621
He's right here.

140
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:57,707
Look. Fuck you.

141
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,333
Wrong answer.

142
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:04,380
God! You motherfucker!

143
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,049
- Fuck!
- Val Resnick.

144
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:10,470
I never heard of him, man.

145
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,305
Where'd you get the shit?

146
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:17,518
Come on.
They'll fucking kill me.

147
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:24,942
What do you think I'll do?
Worry about me.

148
00:22:25,985 --> 00:22:29,238
Oh, come on. Okay, okay.

149
00:22:29,572 --> 00:22:32,241
Stegman, man.
Arthur Stegman.

150
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:34,702
Where is he?

151
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,331
South End Taxi.

152
00:22:39,248 --> 00:22:40,958
Farragut Road, man.

153
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,004
Thanks.

154
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:48,674
You're welcome.

155
00:23:12,031 --> 00:23:13,741
I'm looking for Arthur Stegman.

156
00:23:15,118 --> 00:23:17,870
He ain't here.
Something I can help you with?

157
00:23:18,412 --> 00:23:20,915
No, you can't. Where is he?

158
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:23,000
I don't know.

159
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:27,255
Take a guess.

160
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:29,549
What?

161
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:34,345
Take a guess about where he is.

162
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:46,023
Is he at home?

163
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,571
Go fuck yourself.

164
00:23:55,283 --> 00:23:56,284
Here we go.

165
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:58,661
- This one's mine.
- Roll it.

166
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,830
Wait, that was mine.

167
00:24:08,171 --> 00:24:10,423
There's somebody here to see you.

168
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,053
I'm looking for Stegman.

169
00:24:21,642 --> 00:24:22,477
Who are you?

170
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:26,522
I'm Porter.

171
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:31,402
Porter, that looks like assault to me.

172
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,283
He looks like he likes
to resist arrest.

173
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:42,830
Fuck! Not in here.

174
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,208
Jesus! He wants to talk.

175
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:48,544
Am I right? Did I call it?

176
00:24:51,964 --> 00:24:52,965
Are you Stegman?

177
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:57,512
Maybe. What do you want?

178
00:24:59,138 --> 00:25:01,307
Your boy didn't make his delivery.

179
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,064
Why don't we talk outside?

180
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:09,398
You're a dealer?

181
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:13,402
Just forget about it, all right?

182
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:16,405
Don't touch my money either.
Come on...

183
00:25:16,656 --> 00:25:18,074
This is heroin?

184
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:21,202
This is heroin.

185
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:24,497
Don't worry about it.
Take it easy.

186
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,207
Let's talk.

187
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,169
What are you looking at?
Play your game.

188
00:25:31,045 --> 00:25:33,798
And you're bleeding
all over my couch!

189
00:25:34,048 --> 00:25:35,049
Come on!

190
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:42,974
Steggie's been holding out on us.

191
00:25:44,183 --> 00:25:45,768
I'll check it out.

192
00:25:46,894 --> 00:25:48,604
Val Resnick.

193
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:52,650
- What about him?
- Where is he?

194
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,862
Even if I knew,
the answer would still be no.

195
00:25:56,112 --> 00:25:59,407
- Where'd you meet up with my boy?
- At his drop.

196
00:25:59,615 --> 00:26:00,533
Is he dead?

197
00:26:00,783 --> 00:26:04,454
No, but she is.
O.D.'d on that crap you sent her.

198
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:07,248
So? What do you care?

199
00:26:07,498 --> 00:26:09,250
I'm her husband.

200
00:26:10,877 --> 00:26:12,837
You won't fucking kill me?

201
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:17,717
Not in front of these kids.

202
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:21,345
Where is he?

203
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:26,559
I don't know!

204
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:28,853
That's the truth.

205
00:26:29,103 --> 00:26:33,566
It got delivered to me last night.
I won't see anyone till next month.

206
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:37,403
Why all the trouble?

207
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:41,157
He's afraid of the girl.
I mean...

208
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:43,868
...of Mrs. Porter.

209
00:26:44,076 --> 00:26:47,163
I mean, that's how it looks to me.

210
00:26:54,796 --> 00:26:56,547
I don't know nothing.

211
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,883
I know Val from the old days.

212
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:01,719
Three months ago he asks me
to do him a favor.

213
00:27:01,969 --> 00:27:05,556
I make an extra grand a month.
I figure, what the hell?

214
00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:10,478
Now you threaten to kill me?
That much a buddy of Val's I am not.

215
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:13,731
He's in the city.
That's all I know.

216
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:15,399
How do you know that?

217
00:27:16,526 --> 00:27:18,361
- He said so.
- When?

218
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:22,740
When he came. Said he squared
himself with the syndicate.

219
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,701
Said he was back
in the big time for good.

220
00:27:25,952 --> 00:27:27,328
He was very excited.

221
00:27:27,578 --> 00:27:30,581
You tell him that Porter is back too.

222
00:27:30,873 --> 00:27:33,167
And he wants his money.

223
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:36,838
I'll come back for you
when these kids are not around.

224
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:41,676
When would I tell him this?

225
00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:04,365
Talk to me.

226
00:28:05,032 --> 00:28:08,578
There's a young lady to see you.
Her name is Pearl.

227
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:10,830
She's got two very bad habits.

228
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:14,208
Right now I'm only interested
in one of them.

229
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,461
Send her up.

230
00:28:19,255 --> 00:28:23,134
Apartment 718, ma'am.
Go right on up.

231
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:43,446
Send her up.

232
00:28:43,696 --> 00:28:46,908
It's Haskell.
Sorry to call you at home...

233
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:49,243
Don't be sorry.
Just don't call.

234
00:28:49,452 --> 00:28:53,498
I got a call from a cab guy
on the south end.

235
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:55,708
- What is it?
- It's this guy, Stegman.

236
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,419
Shit. Hold on a second.

237
00:29:06,469 --> 00:29:10,598
On your knees, bitch.
I want satisfaction.

238
00:29:10,973 --> 00:29:12,975
I'm on the phone, Pearl.

239
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:19,023
It's "Mistress Pearl. "

240
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:22,360
I'm on the fucking phone!

241
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:27,281
Make it quick.

242
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:29,826
This guy Stegman calls.

243
00:29:30,076 --> 00:29:34,455
He sounded all nervous,
like something scared him.

244
00:29:34,664 --> 00:29:38,417
He had to talk to you.
I said I'd see what I could do.

245
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:42,713
- What was it about?
- He said to tell you Lynn was dead.

246
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:48,052
He said some guy wanted you.
That's all he said.

247
00:29:48,302 --> 00:29:49,929
I thought you ought to know.

248
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:53,307
You did right.
I want to talk to him.

249
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,101
Who, Stegman?

250
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,771
No, President Nixon.
Of course, Stegman!

251
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,441
Tell him Varrick's, by the bridge.

252
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:02,733
Make it...

253
00:30:04,944 --> 00:30:06,779
Make it 20 minutes.

254
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,365
I'm working here!

255
00:30:16,456 --> 00:30:19,500
Can't you see I'm working here?

256
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:24,005
Put it on my tab.

257
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,174
I'm looking for a girl.

258
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:31,179
She goes by the name of Rosie.
Do you know her?

259
00:30:34,056 --> 00:30:36,809
She worked by telephone,
not freelance.

260
00:30:37,477 --> 00:30:39,729
Probably connected
with the syndicate.

261
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:43,065
Out of my league.
I wouldn't know her.

262
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,695
Maybe you know somebody who would.

263
00:30:53,576 --> 00:30:56,454
- Why you looking for her?
- I'm her brother.

264
00:30:56,704 --> 00:30:59,332
I got cancer.
I want to see her.

265
00:31:05,838 --> 00:31:07,465
You two look close.

266
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:12,053
Got a cigarette?

267
00:31:17,517 --> 00:31:19,936
Your sister sounds expensive.

268
00:31:20,353 --> 00:31:24,107
Try Michael,
bartender at the Regal Hotel.

269
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:27,151
That wasn't the name
I was looking for.

270
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:30,780
The only one I got.

271
00:31:58,891 --> 00:32:03,062
I tried to call you, but you
must have changed your number.

272
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:06,232
I never gave you my original number.

273
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,569
What did this guy look like?

274
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:15,575
He had dark hair, blue eyes.
He was a Cro-Magnon-looking bastard.

275
00:32:15,825 --> 00:32:18,244
If Lynn's dead, he did us a favor.

276
00:32:18,494 --> 00:32:21,372
I know, except I'm out
a grand a month.

277
00:32:21,622 --> 00:32:23,416
We can work something out.

278
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,585
Did you get a name?

279
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,087
He said he was Porter.

280
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:33,926
He said he was there for Porter?

281
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,554
No, he said he was Porter.

282
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,688
I wouldn't want that guy
after me either.

283
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:49,567
- I know how you must feel.
- What am I? A nobody?

284
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,780
I've got friends.
All I have to do is point.

285
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,324
I pick up a phone
and he's a dead man.

286
00:32:56,783 --> 00:32:58,367
And he stays dead!

287
00:32:58,951 --> 00:33:01,454
Try to keep it down.
All right?

288
00:33:01,954 --> 00:33:03,498
It's okay.

289
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:05,458
What'd he say?

290
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:08,211
He said you owed him money.

291
00:33:08,878 --> 00:33:10,046
Nothing else?

292
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,799
Nothing. Why?
How much you owe him?

293
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:14,967
None of your business.

294
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:19,555
I just got the feeling
he'd like to kill you.

295
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:21,849
Oh, Christ!

296
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,935
Porter.

297
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:31,859
What'd you tell him?

298
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:33,653
Nothing!

299
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:37,490
- What could I tell?
- You tell him about the heroin?

300
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,952
He had it with him!
I told him I delivered it.

301
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,537
Nothing else?

302
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,580
I don't know nothing else!

303
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:49,585
You gave him something. A name.
Someone who knows where to find me.

304
00:33:49,877 --> 00:33:52,004
I swear on my mother...

305
00:33:52,255 --> 00:33:53,422
Fuck your mother!

306
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:58,386
- That's not nice. Take it easy.
- What are you looking at?

307
00:33:58,845 --> 00:33:59,804
Val, don't.

308
00:34:00,054 --> 00:34:02,598
Not again. Don't do that, man.

309
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,810
Come on. Not again.

310
00:34:06,102 --> 00:34:07,103
Don't.

311
00:34:07,353 --> 00:34:10,064
- Forget it.
- Is there some trouble here?

312
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,900
We're just leaving.

313
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,404
You know what?
This one's on me.

314
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,990
You see me reaching for my wallet?

315
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,832
Sorry. He just got a promotion,
so he's a little tense.

316
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:31,252
Is there a Michael here?

317
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:33,463
That's him over yonder.

318
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:40,761
You're the man to see
about horizontal refreshment?

319
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,723
I'm looking for a girl named Rosie.

320
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:47,810
Prostitution is illegal
and you're speaking Greek.

321
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:55,359
Usually these matters are conducted
with more discretion.

322
00:34:59,614 --> 00:35:00,656
Be discreet now.

323
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:07,538
What was her name?

324
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:08,748
Rosie.

325
00:35:08,956 --> 00:35:11,542
- Who's looking for her?
- Just call her.

326
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:22,345
Rosie?

327
00:35:22,762 --> 00:35:24,347
Give me the phone.

328
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:27,975
Take care of that.

329
00:35:30,686 --> 00:35:32,313
Who the hell is this?

330
00:35:32,647 --> 00:35:33,564
Porter.

331
00:35:33,815 --> 00:35:36,442
Try again, honey.
Porter's dead.

332
00:35:37,026 --> 00:35:41,364
I used to drive for you.
Provide a safe work environment.

333
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:42,824
Porter?

334
00:35:56,712 --> 00:35:59,799
Why pour salt on old wounds?

335
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:02,510
I didn't need to.

336
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:07,932
I guess I had a soft spot for her.

337
00:36:31,747 --> 00:36:32,707
Come in.

338
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:36,919
You look pretty good
for a dead guy.

339
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,844
How'd you hear about it?

340
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:46,971
People were talking.

341
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:50,475
Plus I heard your wife
was back in town alone.

342
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,603
She's dead.

343
00:36:54,687 --> 00:36:56,731
I'm sorry, Porter.

344
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:58,858
Why?

345
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:04,655
Jesus. Surly Porter.
You're the same as ever, aren't you?

346
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:10,286
This doesn't look like you.

347
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,664
Yeah, well, people change.

348
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:16,000
Stay.

349
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,836
It's okay.
Come on, sweetheart.

350
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,340
Meet the nastiest dog
who ever lived.

351
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,469
What's his name?

352
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:28,346
Porter.

353
00:37:29,972 --> 00:37:31,974
He took your job after you left.

354
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:35,311
He's just as tough,
but he won't leave me.

355
00:37:44,278 --> 00:37:45,446
I need a favor.

356
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:48,324
A favor?

357
00:37:48,741 --> 00:37:51,160
Maybe you're not the same as ever.

358
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,582
I'm looking for a syndicate boy.

359
00:37:58,334 --> 00:37:59,544
It's the "Outfit. "

360
00:37:59,752 --> 00:38:02,588
- We don't say syndicate anymore.
- Whatever.

361
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:05,341
Don't get touchy.
What's his name?

362
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,053
Val Resnick.

363
00:38:12,098 --> 00:38:13,391
That son of a bitch.

364
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,227
You know him?

365
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:21,357
I met up with him once
a few years ago.

366
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,986
He can't use Star's service.
He beats up the girls.

367
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:26,988
He almost killed one.

368
00:38:27,822 --> 00:38:28,656
You?

369
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:36,664
Does it matter?
You quit looking after me.

370
00:38:42,003 --> 00:38:44,172
Would you know where he might be?

371
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:48,718
I suppose he's at the hotel.

372
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:52,638
- Which one?
- The Outfit hotel.

373
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:54,724
The address?

374
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,312
We're friends, right?

375
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:03,941
I mean, we used to be.
But I'm an employee too.

376
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,904
The Outfit wouldn't like me
telling you, would they?

377
00:39:08,571 --> 00:39:09,906
How strong are you?

378
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:14,035
Personally, I think you are
the strongest man I've ever met.

379
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,162
But I wonder if it's enough.

380
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:18,289
For what?

381
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:22,001
You want this guy
for something he won't like.

382
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,170
I'm going to kill him.

383
00:39:27,673 --> 00:39:29,759
That's something he won't like.

384
00:39:32,178 --> 00:39:35,973
What if they grab you and ask you
how you found out?

385
00:39:36,182 --> 00:39:39,185
You know I wouldn't turn you in.

386
00:39:39,435 --> 00:39:42,313
- I wouldn't talk.
- What if they ask you hard?

387
00:39:44,107 --> 00:39:47,401
I'll say it was
a cab dispatcher named Stegman.

388
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:54,408
The Oakwood Arms, Union and 17th.

389
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:27,275
Hi, Val.

390
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,113
Where's my money?

391
00:40:37,618 --> 00:40:39,162
I took your gun.

392
00:40:39,412 --> 00:40:42,123
It's back here.
You look like a pro.

393
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:45,460
Keep your mouth shut
and you'll walk out of here.

394
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:51,924
My 70 grand. I want it.

395
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:55,386
I don't have it right now.

396
00:40:55,845 --> 00:41:00,600
- Where is it?
- I gave all 130,000 to the Outfit.

397
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,435
I gave it all to them.

398
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,900
Tell them you gave them money that
doesn't belong to you. Get it back.

399
00:41:09,484 --> 00:41:12,570
I can't do that.
You don't know these...

400
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,616
You'll kill me
whether I get it or not.

401
00:41:18,201 --> 00:41:20,495
All right, I'll get the money.

402
00:41:20,703 --> 00:41:23,873
Just give me a few days.
What are you doing?

403
00:41:25,124 --> 00:41:27,043
Noon. Tomorrow.

404
00:41:27,335 --> 00:41:28,169
Say it.

405
00:41:28,795 --> 00:41:30,296
All right.

406
00:41:30,963 --> 00:41:33,674
This may sound crazy,
but no hard feelings?

407
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,804
I did what I had to do.
You can appreciate that.

408
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:39,430
I appreciate that, you...

409
00:41:39,722 --> 00:41:40,973
No, no! Don't.

410
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,060
Please.

411
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,812
Allow me.

412
00:41:53,653 --> 00:41:55,029
Jesus!

413
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,706
You bitch!

414
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,043
Let her work.

415
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:24,517
Me love you, baby.

416
00:42:26,686 --> 00:42:29,063
Me love you long time.

417
00:42:35,528 --> 00:42:37,196
No, no, wait.

418
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,162
Tomorrow.

419
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:45,955
Noon.

420
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:50,501
You and the money be at
7th and Franklin at the pay phone.

421
00:42:56,382 --> 00:42:57,925
Where'd you get this?

422
00:42:59,385 --> 00:43:01,888
Some hooker had it.
I recognized you.

423
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:04,599
I swiped it in case I could use it.

424
00:43:04,807 --> 00:43:06,267
Did you hurt her?

425
00:43:07,393 --> 00:43:09,395
The hooker,
did you hurt her?

426
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:11,481
What does that have to do
with anything?

427
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,742
I've got a few minutes.

428
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:25,870
So go boil an egg.

429
00:43:32,668 --> 00:43:36,464
Phillip says you have a problem
you need help with.

430
00:43:37,256 --> 00:43:38,341
Yes, sir.

431
00:43:39,175 --> 00:43:40,510
Is it your problem...

432
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,763
...who breached our security
last night?

433
00:43:44,764 --> 00:43:46,307
He breaks into my apartment...

434
00:43:46,474 --> 00:43:50,353
There's an old expression
that has served me well:

435
00:43:50,603 --> 00:43:53,022
"Do not shit where you eat. "

436
00:43:54,941 --> 00:43:56,526
Or "live. "

437
00:43:56,776 --> 00:43:58,236
"Do not shit where you live. "

438
00:43:58,444 --> 00:43:59,821
I like that better.

439
00:44:00,613 --> 00:44:01,781
I'm sorry, Mr. Carter.

440
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:04,492
There are three ways
we can handle this.

441
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:09,330
One: We help you.
Two: We allow you to help yourself.

442
00:44:10,373 --> 00:44:12,792
Three: We have you replaced.

443
00:44:17,964 --> 00:44:23,094
We have an investment in you, Resnick,
of time, money and training.

444
00:44:23,302 --> 00:44:25,304
So assisting you would be...

445
00:44:25,638 --> 00:44:28,724
...in a way, protecting our investment.

446
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:32,395
That is good business policy.

447
00:44:32,645 --> 00:44:34,188
Yes, sir, Mr. Carter.

448
00:44:34,397 --> 00:44:36,774
Thank you.
You won't regret it.

449
00:44:40,903 --> 00:44:44,699
According to Phillip,
a man has come to kill you?

450
00:44:45,575 --> 00:44:49,537
He's alone and he's
a professional robber. Correct?

451
00:44:49,745 --> 00:44:53,666
Yes, sir. He does payroll jobs,
banks, stuff like that.

452
00:44:54,834 --> 00:44:57,420
- What's his name?
- Porter.

453
00:44:58,212 --> 00:44:59,547
What's his first name?

454
00:45:05,678 --> 00:45:09,682
I don't know. He never called
himself anything but Porter.

455
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:24,697
Where did you get the $130,000?

456
00:45:29,452 --> 00:45:32,205
That's why this man is in town?

457
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:34,916
The $130,000 you paid us back.

458
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:38,336
Yes, sir.
But only $70,000 of it was his.

459
00:45:39,003 --> 00:45:43,633
We never asked you where you got it.
It's none of our business.

460
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:47,053
Now it appears
it has become our business.

461
00:45:50,389 --> 00:45:52,642
Here's his file, Mr. Carter.

462
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:04,112
Do you understand your value
to the organization?

463
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:10,368
You're a sadist, you lack compunction.
That comes in handy.

464
00:46:11,911 --> 00:46:17,041
But now, an area of your personal life
has become a danger to us.

465
00:46:19,919 --> 00:46:24,382
A man in our organization needs
to be tough, self-reliant.

466
00:46:25,341 --> 00:46:28,803
Were you to handle this problem
on your own...

467
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:32,890
...there would be no doubt...

468
00:46:34,142 --> 00:46:36,018
...you're the man we want.

469
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:37,395
I want to.

470
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:40,148
I want to handle it myself.

471
00:46:40,356 --> 00:46:41,399
Great.

472
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:46,446
Until it is handled, I want you
to move out of the Oakwood.

473
00:46:49,031 --> 00:46:50,658
I don't have a place...

474
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:53,494
No more unpleasantness at the hotel.

475
00:46:55,496 --> 00:46:56,747
Yes, sir.

476
00:47:06,048 --> 00:47:10,303
It might be easier
if Resnick just disappeared.

477
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,764
I thought about that.

478
00:47:14,348 --> 00:47:16,768
I'm not worried about Resnick.

479
00:47:16,976 --> 00:47:20,104
He wouldn't last two minutes
without us.

480
00:47:20,313 --> 00:47:22,732
It's that other mutt
I'm thinking about.

481
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,525
- What's his name?
- Porter.

482
00:47:26,861 --> 00:47:31,699
Takes a lot of moxie to walk in
and whack our guys around.

483
00:47:32,617 --> 00:47:34,410
Either that or he's shit nuts.

484
00:47:35,787 --> 00:47:38,956
Frankly, I don't understand it
for $130,000.

485
00:47:39,332 --> 00:47:41,334
It was $70,000, his share.

486
00:47:42,585 --> 00:47:44,337
That's even worse.

487
00:47:44,879 --> 00:47:47,757
I don't want
Mr. Bronson hearing about this.

488
00:47:48,216 --> 00:47:50,384
He'll think I'm getting soft.

489
00:47:50,676 --> 00:47:52,470
His principle has always been:

490
00:47:52,678 --> 00:47:55,681
"If you don't understand it,
get rid of it. "

491
00:47:56,808 --> 00:48:00,061
A stitch in time, so to speak.

492
00:48:01,104 --> 00:48:02,939
Stitch this mutt up, Phil.

493
00:48:08,194 --> 00:48:10,488
Any Polaroids or trophies?

494
00:48:10,738 --> 00:48:12,532
No, not this time.

495
00:48:15,785 --> 00:48:19,247
They cut me loose, Pearl.
Like I thought they would.

496
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,374
Hold on one second.

497
00:48:21,707 --> 00:48:25,795
Shut up!
I'm on the fucking phone!

498
00:48:35,972 --> 00:48:36,806
Yes?

499
00:48:37,473 --> 00:48:39,892
Did your friends make it to town?

500
00:48:40,685 --> 00:48:41,936
Last night, baby.

501
00:48:42,145 --> 00:48:45,398
Did you tell them
Porter took their payroll?

502
00:48:45,606 --> 00:48:46,774
I did.

503
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,360
And they want retribution.

504
00:48:49,902 --> 00:48:52,238
All right. Here's what we do.

505
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:58,221
Yeah, that's Porter.
He has shit for brains.

506
00:49:58,638 --> 00:49:59,889
Shit.

507
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:26,958
Shit!

508
00:50:31,254 --> 00:50:32,880
Next time, Porter.

509
00:50:36,884 --> 00:50:39,095
Porter's made some new friends.
