00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,181
Hey, I'm great at that game.

2
00:00:56,306 --> 00:01:01,812
Back home in California, I'm, like, deadly.
Hold on, I'll teach you girls how to play.

3
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:08,235
Hey, babe, come on. We need
an extra guy to even out the sides.

4
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,779
Hey, come on.

5
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:15,367
All right, now, let me show you how
to do this. Now just watch closely.

6
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,453
Huh? Huh?

7
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,915
(applause)

8
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,168
Uh, get the bag, please?

9
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,504
(soldier) How 'bout some help?

10
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,425
- What's his problem?
- I don't know. He just got here yesterday.

11
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,054
Excuse me! Throw me the bag,
then you can go back to sleep, OK?

12
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,641
Bitch.

13
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,937
We like a little teamwork around here, pal.

14
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,442
You know, Ioners don't go
too far in this outfit.

15
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,612
- Private!
- The colonel. Shit!

16
00:01:54,781 --> 00:02:00,162
I'll have the house ready for you
in three weeks, Dad, OK? I love you.

17
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,122
Take care.

18
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,665
Bye.

19
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,837
- Hello, Charley.
- Hi, ma'am.

20
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,547
- How are you?
- Just fine.

21
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,799
Stay with the convoy till you get to town.

22
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,053
- You've lots of time to get to the airport.
- Of course, sir.

23
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:19,264
Sergeant, you know how
important she is to me.

24
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,683
Yes, sir. She'll be safe with me, sir.

25
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,645
- Are you ready for the trip?
- Yep. Thank you.

26
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:27,981
(whistles)

27
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,903
All right, move it out.

28
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:47,162
- What's goin' on here?
- Just pull over to the side.

29
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,373
It'll take a second.

30
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,542
- Good morning.
- Morning.

31
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,889
Freeze.

32
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,809
All right, take it easy.

33
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:12,980
All we need are the trucks. Tell your men
to surrender. No one will get hurt.

34
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,440
Take it easy. Take it easy.

35
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,109
Let's go!

36
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,696
Move, move. Get out!

37
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,753
Nobody shoot. Nobody shoot.

38
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,214
Hold your fire.

39
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:45,137
Let 'em take what they want.
There's nothing here worth dyin' for.

40
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,601
Charley, come on. Let's go. Come on,
What are you waiting for? Step on it.

41
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,769
- Hurry up.
- Out!

42
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,275
Don't resist. Don't resist.

43
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,117
Who do you think you are?
You have no business hitting him!

44
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,412
Shut up! Get in the car.

45
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,641
No, let her go! Don't shoot!

46
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,023
Agh!

47
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,870
Come on! Let's take 'em!

48
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,961
Shit!

49
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,880
(rumble)

50
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,220
Move it!

51
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,642
Go! Get going!

52
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,944
(horn)

53
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,905
Holy shit!

54
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,954
Go after him! He's getting away!

55
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,073
Agh!

56
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,098
- Hey, where are you going?
- Get away from me!

57
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,057
Hey!

58
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,478
What do you think you're doing to me?

59
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,073
(woman screams)

60
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,997
Stop it!

61
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,541
(screams)

62
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,135
He!

63
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,607
Kill him!

64
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,862
- (Japanese command)
- No!

65
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,073
No more. Enough. We give up!

66
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,249
- Who is he?
- I don't know. He's a new recruit.

67
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,417
I don't even know his name.

68
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,129
He possess great skills.

69
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,326
I can take care of myself. Let go of me.

70
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,579
(whispers) Who are they?

71
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,715
What do you think I am,
a jungle baby or something?

72
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,844
Would you...? I can't go as fast as you.
Don't you touch my shoes.

73
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:44,348
I hope you're going to Italy
to get me a pair of designer shoes.

74
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:48,519
I can't believe you just did that.
You are crazy, do you know that?

75
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:52,731
These are my favourite shoes.
What are you gonna do with that?

76
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,192
What?

77
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:04,826
You, my dear, are going to town
to buy me new shoes and a new skirt.

78
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,996
Don't you touch my skirt. What are you...?

79
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,977
No! No way. I am not going in that water.

80
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:34,273
I don't care who's chasing us.
There are leeches. I'm not going in there.

81
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,679
Do!

82
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:29,495
Get away from me, you creep!
You trying to kill me or something?

83
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,830
Leave me alone, all right?

84
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,252
I swear.

85
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:46,386
Would you look at me? Look at my shirt.
Look at my hair. It's a mess.

86
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:50,182
Do you have a comb, by any chance?

87
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,602
Comb. Course not. Stupid question.

88
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,979
- Shoes...
- Are you OK?

89
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:05,030
- My clothes are just a bit wet, thank you.
- Well, we can hang 'em out to dry.

90
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,156
Are you serious?

91
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,494
They should be dry pretty soon.

92
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:21,839
If my father saw us out here like this,
he would absolutely kill you.

93
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,007
Do you realise that?

94
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,844
Oops. But, uh... I kinda like it.

95
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:31,890
- Feels kinda natural, don't you think?
- It's gonna start getting dark.

96
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:35,727
You know, I don't even
know your name.

97
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,480
Joe.

98
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,816
That's it?

99
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,527
- Yeah, just call me Joe.
- Joe.

100
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,739
- OK, Joe.
- Look, uh...

101
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:54,329
Colonel's gonna be worried. We'd
better get dressed and get outta here.

102
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:08,260
I want every inch of that
jungle covered before dark.

103
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,305
- Get every man out in the field now.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,143
Third time we've been hit. Call the chief of
police and tell him to get his ass in gear.

105
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,603
Sir!

106
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:21,440
And your ass is in a sling, mister,
if anything's happened to Patricia.

107
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:26,028
- We tried our best, sir.
- Obviously it wasn't good enough.

108
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,447
- No, sir.
- What happened out there?

109
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:31,575
We've never had any casualties
in these instances before.

110
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,037
We wouldn't have had any
if that new man hadn't been along.

111
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:39,833
Your daughter'd be here right now, safe, if
he hadn't started acting like John Wayne.

112
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:43,921
That son of a bitch is gonna be sorry
he ever joined this goddamn army.

113
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,089
- Jackson!
- Yes, sir.

114
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,218
- Did you check the wounds?
- Yes, sir. I did.

115
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:53,305
- What the hell did you find out?
- Have you ever heard of ninjutsu, sir?

116
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,016
- The secret art of assassination.
- Yeah, I have.

117
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,685
Well, according to
witnesses' testimony...

118
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,063
...this massacre was the work of ninjas.

119
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,272
Ninjas?

120
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:07,402
You have served me well, my friend.
Until today, your record was spotless.

121
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:11,990
But the truck with the most
valuable cargo got away.

122
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:16,286
Another incident like this, I might
have to shut down the entire operation.

123
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:21,333
(speaks Japanese)

124
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,837
An American ninja? What do you mean?
There is no such thing.

125
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:30,592
I do not lie. I know it is death to
teach the secrets to the westerner...

126
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,221
...but I also know there was
an American ninja there.

127
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,390
The buyers arrive tomorrow.

128
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:41,186
It's a multimillion-dollar deal.
Nothing must be left to chance.

129
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:45,190
This American, whatever
he is, get rid of him.

130
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,597
I guess it's goodbye.

131
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,726
Guess so.

132
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,979
Well, bye.

133
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,024
Goodbye.

134
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,198
Look at me.

135
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:36,700
Don't I look absolutely ridiculous?

136
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,788
- No, you look good.
- Thank you.

137
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:44,208
Well, goodbye.

138
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,218
Joe!

139
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:58,263
Thanks. Thanks for everything.

140
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:07,564
I suppose you think you're a hero cos
you brought my daughter back alive.

141
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,024
No, sir.

142
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,235
Good.

143
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,822
Because I've got half a mind
to throw you under the stockade.

144
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:19,159
Just what in the hell were you
tryin' to prove out there?

145
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,370
Nothing, sir.

146
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,164
We've got a touchy situation
with these rebels.

147
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,626
We're under standing orders
not to provoke any incidents.

148
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:31,505
There was nothing in
that convoy worth protecting.

149
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,174
Now we've got four
dead men on our hands.

150
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,426
There's gonna be an investigation.

151
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:40,639
You're gonna be court-martialled
and I can't help ya.

152
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,058
Get outta my sight.

153
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,443
- Do you have his record, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

154
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:56,905
- Well, let's hear it.
- Yes, sir.

155
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,741
Date of birth: Unknown.

156
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,494
Parents: Unknown.

157
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,788
Next of kin: Unknown.

00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:13,088
A construction crew found him
on an island six years ago...

159
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:18,886
...knocked unconscious by an explosion
to blast a road through the jungle.

160
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,847
Brought back to the United States
with total amnesia.

161
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:26,852
In and out of foster homes. Hell, he's
got more last names than I could count.

162
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,689
Here it is. I knew it.

163
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:34,818
Aged 16, in reform school
for almost killing a man.

164
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,198
- That's correct, sir.
- Six months ago he got in trouble again.

165
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:43,994
Judge gave him a choice:
Enlist or go to jail.

166
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,830
Confine him to base
till we finish the investigation.

167
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,750
- Yes, sir.
- And keep him away from Patricia.

168
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:50,918
Yes, sir.

169
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:12,773
All right, men. I know our morale is low,
so now let's just go hit the showers, OK?

170
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:16,902
That's him, man. There's that
bastard I was telling you about.

171
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,067
Let's go.

172
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:13,000
Hey, Joe Hero. Did you
make out with the princess?

173
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:17,087
Did she put out a little bit
to thank you for saving her life?

174
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:20,465
Let's get outta here. This place stinks.

175
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:36,982
Four bodies to impress a girl.
Was a heavy price, wasn't it?

176
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:39,151
Wasn't it?

177
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:10,057
- Bienvenido.
- Hola, amigo Ortega.

178
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:12,893
- Welcome to the Ortega estate.
- Thank you very much.

179
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:17,314
- Welcome. Pasen, por favor.
- Mm, no está mal.

180
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,483
- Hi.
- Janette.

181
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:20,901
- Enchanté.
- Juliette.

182
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,819
Very nice to meet you.

183
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:28,408
Qué cosas más lindas
tienes aquí en tu palacio.

184
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:35,499
Pero, es espeluznante
todo esto, verdad?

185
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:41,588
Everything that you see
here... it all belongs to me.

186
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:49,721
We are totally autonomous here.
We grow our own food, train our staff...

187
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:52,850
...and store our product
until the right buyers...

188
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:55,686
...such as yourselves, can take delivery.

189
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,855
Very impressive.

190
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,191
This way.

191
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:17,332
This is Shinyuki. He's responsible for the
beautiful landscape you see around you.

192
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:21,170
I found him when I bought the estate.
He was hiding in the jungle...

193
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:26,550
...in uniform, a Japanese soldier, who was
unaware for years that the war was over.

194
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:31,138
He never says a word. Well, hardly ever.

195
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:35,475
But as you can see, he is truly an artist.

196
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,413
Ah, very impressive.

197
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:36,578
This is my private army.

198
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:40,582
In addition to ensuring safe acquisition
and delivery of the merchandise...

199
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:46,880
...each member of my special duty staff
here is specially trained to...

200
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:51,218
...help you with any problems
you may encounter with the opposition.

201
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:55,389
The results are quite efficient and final.

202
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:10,547
Black Star Ninja is the only top-ranking
ninjutsu sensei outside Japan.

203
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:17,262
Believe me when I tell you this man
is deeply honoured to die at his hands.

204
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,599
This way, please.

205
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:29,316
You have an excellent inventory.

206
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:32,986
It's all straight from the factory.
I don't deal in used equipment.

207
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,197
You'll find only the best here.

208
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:38,826
But items which are most valuable
to us, you still don't have.

209
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,328
Do you think you can
comply with our needs?

210
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:44,456
I'm expecting the final items
in the next few days.

211
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:48,418
If we can agree on a price, it can be
included in the next shipment.

212
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:51,046
Tres miliones, para todo.

213
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:54,424
There are other buyers also interested.

214
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,011
Bastante completo el equipo.
Podemos pagar cuatro millones.

215
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:02,391
- Cash on delivery.
- But of course.

216
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:07,145
It's a pleasure doing business with you,
my friend, and you, pleasure.

217
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:10,482
- Pleasure.
- And now for some champagne.

218
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:20,617
(soldiers chant)

219
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:42,472
Hey!

220
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:45,726
So you're the new driver, huh?

221
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:50,564
I hear you think yourself to be
some kind of a tough guy.

222
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:52,733
A karate boy.

223
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:59,448
- Hey, I'm talkin' to you, hero.
- He thinks he's a real bad-ass, Jackson.

224
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:02,451
I think you should
teach him a lesson there, ace.

225
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:04,495
- Bad-ass?
- Mm-hm.

226
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,833
You know, every place you go, there's
someone who thinks he's a bad-ass.

227
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:13,712
- Then there are those few who are.
- He ain't one of 'em.

228
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:16,924
Are you some kind of
a bad-ass, karate boy?

229
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:20,219
Because from what I heard,
you didn't act like one the other day.

230
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:24,515
And we lost some good
friends because of it, huh?

231
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,603
We like to know where a person stands.
We pride ourselves on teamwork here.

232
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,314
We left all the glory boys back in Vietnam.

233
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:37,528
Because glory boys like you get people
killed. You understand what I'm sayin'?

234
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:42,032
Yeah, you understand what I'm sayin'.

235
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:50,332
So let's go, bad-ass.

236
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:54,670
Let's see what kind
of stuff you're made out of.

237
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,595
- Don't push it.
- Good.

238
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:07,391
Very good. I've touched somethin'.

239
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,644
Let's go.

240
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,772
I'm talkin' to you, Mr Hero.

241
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,694
OK. All right, let's do it.

242
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:22,614
Come on, baby. Come on, fight me.
Who the fuck are you? Come here!

243
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,992
Come on, fight me, man.

244
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:36,170
(soldiers) Whoa!

245
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:37,963
Shut up!

246
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:41,049
Hey! Hey!

247
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:56,773
Hey!

248
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,445
Hey! We don't stop
till one of us goes down.

249
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,864
Now. Let's go.

250
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:10,871
What are you gonna do
with that hose? Play with yourself?

251
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:13,040
Show me what you do.

252
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:35,479
Jackson, get up.

253
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:45,030
Here. Go and get him with this.

254
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:48,158
- You damn right I'll get him.
- Yeah! Yeah!

255
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:53,038
- What's this?
- Mess him up now.

256
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:56,166
- What is this?
- He can't even see you.

257
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:12,641
All right, all right, all right.

258
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:18,230
(groans)

259
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:29,116
Hey.

260
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,285
I'm Jackson.

261
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:34,538
Joe.

262
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:37,457
Curtis Jackson is man enough
to admit when he's wrong.

263
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:40,377
- Joe's all right, right?
- Right.

264
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:44,798
Ain't this a bitch? I've been instructing
martial arts in the army for many years...

265
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:48,886
...and you've got some sharp moves.
Who'd you study with?

266
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:54,183
Nobody. I just picked up a few things
here and there, in the streets.

267
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,351
In the str...

268
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:03,192
Well, look, thanks for the demonstration.
That's the lesson for today, guys.

269
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:07,613
If you can get your opponent off balance,
you use his own energy to defeat him.

270
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:10,824
- Get your ass in my office.
- But Sarge, he was just...

271
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:13,327
Don't try to cover up for him, Jackson.

272
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:16,038
I saw the whole thing. He started it.

273
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:20,626
- Sarge, you got it wrong.
- Knock it off. He's not worth it.

274
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:24,671
The guy's trouble. Move it.

275
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:47,611
Still on the shit list?

276
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:51,448
Till they decide whether to
court-martial me or not. Go ahead.

277
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:53,784
Ah, man, that ain't gonna happen.

278
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:58,413
You know, Charley said six ninjas
went after you and Patricia.

279
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:01,625
Those guys aren't amateurs,
and neither am I.

280
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,503
Now, level with me.
Where'd you learn those moves?

281
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:09,007
And don't give me that look. I know it's
not from the streets. I'm from the streets.

282
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:11,552
I don't know where I learned 'em.

283
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:15,848
I just know 'em. As far back
as I can remember, I just know 'em.

284
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:18,767
Come on, gimme a break, will ya?

285
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:21,770
Look, your moves are too perfect.

286
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:24,022
Somebody had to teach them to you.

287
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:35,367
- It's a long story.
- OK.

288
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:38,829
I lost my memory a few years ago.

289
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:41,582
My whole childhood is
completely wiped out.

290
00:34:41,707 --> 00:34:45,794
I remember bits of things sometimes,
but they're like dreams.

291
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:49,506
I can't seem to figure 'em out.

292
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:54,595
Look, I still think you can make some
good use of those fancy moves of yours.

293
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,806
You know, you and I, man,
we could make a staged exhibition.

294
00:34:57,931 --> 00:35:03,729
You know, like wrestling, in the States?
The crowds go crazy for that kind of stuff.

295
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,107
I don't like crowds.

296
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:10,319
Look, Joe, read my lips.

297
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:13,030
We can make some easy money.

298
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:20,037
Look, Jackson, I don't wanna fight, I don't
like crowds and I don't need money.

299
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:33,008
Miss, we'd better get going.

300
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:40,307
There'll be a lot of trouble
if we don't... leave now.

301
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,769
Yeah, you don't need money.

302
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,813
Hey, what do you need?

303
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:51,693
Glad to see you're still human.
She's cute, isn't she?

304
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:55,531
- Who?
- Who?

305
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:59,201
You may have kicked my ass,
but you did not make me blind.

306
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:03,997
- Jackson, she's the colonel's daughter.
- I know, but nobody's perfect.

307
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:07,167
But she is cute, isn't she? Isn't she?

308
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:10,254
Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

309
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:15,425
You're tinglin'. You're tinglin'.
I knew I've touched something again.

310
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:17,553
Yeah.

311
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:21,390
Boy, you sure are lucky goin' back
to California. I wish I was.

312
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:24,476
You couldn't tell by lookin' at me,
but I'm a famous surfer.

313
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:28,146
- I love nothin' more than wiping a few...
- Charley, stop the car.

314
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:30,023
- What's wrong?
- Stop the car.

315
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,276
What is it? Hijackers?
I gotta get you home.

316
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:36,780
- Listen, you gotta do me a big favour.
- No, I can't. I can smell trouble already.

317
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:39,700
Charley, there'll be
no trouble if you keep quiet...

318
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:43,078
...and take me back home
right now. I'll explain it all later.

319
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:49,293
OK.

320
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:54,339
OK. Hey, listen, you through thinkin'
about those exhibitions yet?

321
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:59,636
Cos we can make a great team. We could
quit the army. We'd make a fortune.

322
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:02,931
- Maybe Charley can help you.
- No thanks. Sweating's bad for ya.

323
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:07,144
It means you're puttin' forth effort.
Jackson, you gotta help me.

324
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:11,773
I set myself up with a date with this girl,
but the colonel's got me runnin' errands.

325
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:15,444
In 30 minutes, I'm to meet her
at the country club, and I won't make it.

326
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:18,447
Could you run a note over there
and tell her I'll be late?

327
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:23,076
I hate to burst your bubble, but I can't.
I have to report in a few minutes.

328
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:28,582
Ah, shit. Man, I hate to lose this chick.
Jackson, she thinks I'm intense.

329
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:32,085
- I'll get her the note.
- No, no, you can't.

330
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:35,839
- You're confined to the base, man.
- I'll be fast. No one will notice.

331
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:38,759
- Are you sure?
- Do you want her to get the note?

332
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:42,346
She'll be on the balcony, wearin'
a white dress. You cannot miss her.

333
00:37:42,471 --> 00:37:45,224
Jackson. I'm gonna need your bike.

334
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:49,353
Oh, man, that's my baby. That's my
life's blood. You sure you can handle it?

335
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:53,815
Look, Joe, call me a worrywart,
call me irresponsible...

336
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:57,861
...but how do you plan to get off the base
without the MPs catching you?

337
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,613
Watch.

338
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,660
Watch what, Joe? Joe, Joe...

339
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,047
- Joe?
- What's he gonna do?

340
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:27,432
Is he gonna do what
I think he's gonna do?

341
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,578
Well, look here, Charley. I wanna
talk to you about your future.

342
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:48,954
My future?

343
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:54,585
See, you're gonna put on working fatigues
and be ready to cover up for Joe.

344
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:59,089
- What's that got to do with my future?
- If you don't do it, you won't have one.

345
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:01,091
- Ah.
- Yeah, OK.

346
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:35,709
Hi, Joe.

347
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:39,004
Is this note from Charley for you?

348
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:41,465
Nope. It's for you.

349
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:53,852
- This was your idea?
- I had to see you.

350
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,190
Look...

351
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:01,109
...it can never work.

352
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:04,446
Oh, be quiet.
It's gonna be a wonderful evening.

353
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:06,698
Come on.

354
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:08,867
Come on.

355
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:33,892
Why, thank you, Luis.

356
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:49,491
Oh, don't worry about it, Joe. You can
order anything. It'll go on Dad's account.

357
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:55,247
That's him.

358
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,916
That's the one from the convoy.

359
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:04,131
- I thought you'd taken care of him.
- I did. I had him confined to the barracks.

360
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,842
- I'll place him under arrest...
- One moment.

361
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:09,136
Let me look at him.

362
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:13,682
What's the matter?

363
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:23,233
The sergeant? Oh, don't worry
about him. He's a real pussycat, really.

364
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:33,619
That's senor Ortega. He owns a big
plantation on the other side of the island.

365
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:35,913
Dad really likes him.

366
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:38,790
Arresting this guy is not enough.

367
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:41,877
- I want him dead.
- Dead?

368
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:45,339
There's an investigation
goin' on right now.

369
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:48,050
Could blow the whole thing
wide open. You sure?

370
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:49,801
Yes.

371
00:41:50,636 --> 00:41:53,764
And already I know
how you are going to do it.

372
00:42:08,821 --> 00:42:10,572
Oh, come on.

373
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:14,326
Come on!

374
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:27,798
Like my bike?

375
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:30,467
Yeah. Yeah.

376
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:33,846
I had a nice time today.

377
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:36,807
So did I.

378
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:41,478
Would you like to come in?

379
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:45,065
I don't think I should.

380
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:47,818
I think you should.

381
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:07,171
Ten hut!

382
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:14,011
Come on. Get up.

383
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:30,110
We've got some soldiers in this unit
who think they can make a fool out of me.

384
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:35,616
They don't know I've been a sergeant
in this man's army before they were born.

385
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:38,869
Even before they were
sent to reform schools.

386
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:41,914
I understand you like
to do extra duties, do you?

387
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,916
- Uh, no, sir.
- No?

388
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:47,669
I heard yesterday you volunteered
to do some, didn't ya?

389
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:52,049
Well, don't worry, Charley.
I won't deny you that privilege.

390
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:55,302
You could keep doin' 'em
till I said you had enough.

391
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:58,555
And that's gonna be
a long time from now.

392
00:43:59,223 --> 00:44:01,433
And as for you, hero...

393
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:05,938
...you believe my orders
can be ignored, right?

394
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:09,191
You don't like the hard work.

395
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:13,946
You'd rather be drivin' around town, right?

396
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:18,033
Well, I'll have you drivin', all right.

397
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:20,202
Report to the motor pool.

398
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:44,560
Sergeant Rinaldo told me to report here.
There's an assignment for me.

399
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:48,856
That one goes over to the warehouse
on the dock. You know where it is?

400
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:51,358
Thanks, I'll find it.

401
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:09,293
Hey, this warehouse five?

402
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:14,882
Where is everyone?

403
00:45:26,852 --> 00:45:29,062
(sounds horn)

404
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:24,910
Ooh!

405
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:40,384
(rice falling)

406
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:12,291
(thud)

407
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:32,037
Go!

408
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:21,396
Come on.

409
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:20,956
Pasa. Let's go.

410
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:44,480
It's here. Let's go and see it, ah?

411
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:23,352
Open it.

412
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:28,732
Ah, magnifique.

413
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,613
Just beautiful.

414
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:39,535
Goes on the shipment the morning
after tomorrow with everything else, ah?

415
00:53:15,779 --> 00:53:17,364
Hey, you!

416
00:53:19,575 --> 00:53:20,576
What was that?

417
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:31,920
Someone is in here. Lock
the door so he can't get away.

418
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:38,510
Everyone, look around you.
Wait a minute.

419
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:42,431
(speaks Japanese)

420
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:45,893
The ninja will take care of it.

421
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:16,507
Hey! Hold it!

422
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:21,053
Outside.

423
00:54:29,394 --> 00:54:31,438
(gunshots)

424
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:49,665
Two of you, round the back, now!

425
00:55:21,363 --> 00:55:23,907
- Is that the American?
- Yes.

426
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:26,952
We must stop him.

427
00:55:30,664 --> 00:55:34,251
Come, this way. Come. Hurry.

428
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:41,466
- Who are you?
- You will know when the time is right.

429
00:55:41,842 --> 00:55:44,636
- Our paths will meet again.
- Whaddaya mean?

430
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:48,140
Your karma and mine,
they are connected.

431
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:49,892
Go.

432
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:31,058
Telephone. Get me the sergeant.

433
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:34,853
(phone rings)

434
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:39,608
- Rinaldo here.
- He escaped the trap. I don't know how.

435
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:43,362
The ambush was perfect. And
listen to me, Sergeant. He was here.

436
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:46,615
He's seen the missile.
He knows too much and I want him dead.

437
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:50,118
I don't care how you do it.
The plan must proceed as programmed.

438
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:52,538
Don't worry about it, Victor.

439
00:56:52,663 --> 00:56:54,706
He'll be taken care of.

440
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:11,431
Hold it right there, soldier.
You're under arrest.

441
00:57:11,557 --> 00:57:13,851
I have to see the colonel.
My truck was hijacked.

442
00:57:13,976 --> 00:57:18,856
My order is to place you under arrest.
You can tell your story to the duty officer.

443
00:57:18,981 --> 00:57:21,024
Take him away.

444
00:57:36,957 --> 00:57:40,502
Sir. I'm sorry to bother you, but
I believe a mistake has been made.

445
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:42,004
What is it, Corporal?

446
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:46,300
A man was picked up for being AWOL. I
may be able to explain the circumstances.

447
00:57:46,425 --> 00:57:49,219
There's been one arrest today
and it was no mistake.

448
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:51,972
Unless you want to
question a direct order.

449
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:54,808
No, I don't. But could you
tell me the charges, sir?

450
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:58,479
Very serious. It has to do
with stealing military equipment.

451
00:57:58,604 --> 00:58:01,982
- Expensive military equipment.
- Stealing military equipment?

452
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:05,194
I warned you not to involve
yourself with the man, Corporal.

453
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:10,741
Hey, you're a good soldier. Why don't ya
keep it that way? Stay out of this, huh?

454
00:58:10,866 --> 00:58:14,495
But Sarge, this just doesn't sound right.
Couldn't his story be true?

455
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:18,332
- We've lost a lot of trucks recently.
- Yeah, that's true.

456
00:58:18,457 --> 00:58:22,085
But he's always had witnesses before.
This time he was alone.

457
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:25,380
Now, losing a truck, in itself,
is a heavy-duty violation...

458
00:58:25,506 --> 00:58:27,925
...which will result in serious charges.

459
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,886
He might have sold
the shipment to the rebels...

460
00:58:31,011 --> 00:58:33,680
...in which case, he's gonna
sit for many years.

461
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:37,810
- But Sarge, it was a mistake.
- You don't know the man, Jackson.

462
00:58:37,935 --> 00:58:42,564
He has a criminal record.
It's true, a mistake was made here...

463
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:45,442
...and that was enabling him
to enlist in the army.

464
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:49,404
Forget about him, Corporal.
His fate's in the court's hands now.

465
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,573
Thank you, Sergeant.

466
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:13,637
Bye, thanks for coming.
Nice seeing you.

467
00:59:13,762 --> 00:59:15,806
Bye-bye.

468
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:18,267
- Patricia.
- Hello. Dad's inside.

469
00:59:18,392 --> 00:59:20,602
Actually, I came to
see you. It's about Joe.

470
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:23,689
- What about?
- Your father wants to court-martial him.

471
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:26,733
What? Well, come inside.
We'll talk about it.

472
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:31,196
Colonel, something just isn't right.
I know Joe, and I know...

473
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:35,242
That's enough, Corporal. I don't want
to hear any more from either of ya.

474
00:59:35,367 --> 00:59:39,163
The man's been nothing but trouble.
He's gonna be court-martialled...

475
00:59:39,288 --> 00:59:42,040
...and I'm gonna make sure
he gets what's coming to him.

476
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:44,376
You're dismissed, Corporal.

477
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:45,419
Yes, sir.

478
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:53,468
The American knows too much.
It is too dangerous to let him live.

479
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:59,016
- He must be terminated.
- My men failed to kill him in the jungle.

480
00:59:59,141 --> 01:00:03,312
They made the mistake
of underestimating him. I will not.

481
01:00:03,562 --> 01:00:06,064
Can you do it? Can you kill him?

482
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:08,901
- (speaks Japanese)
- Then do it.

483
01:00:09,026 --> 01:00:11,361
Hai.

484
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:13,530
- Tonight.
- Hai.

485
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:26,103
Yeah, it's probably a fuse.

486
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:29,481
Where is that damn box?

487
01:01:31,567 --> 01:01:34,069
Hey, Tuck? Tucker?

488
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:42,995
Get this damn thing to
work here. Let's see now.

489
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:07,579
Hold it right there!

490
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:12,704
All right. Freeze!

491
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:28,178
- What happened to Charlie?
- They got him.

492
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:30,973
- Over there. He went that way.
- I'll get it.

493
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:33,600
- Damn. Look at his neck.
- I think he's gone.

494
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:37,437
- What's goin' on?
- Hey, Collins, over here.

495
01:05:38,147 --> 01:05:41,275
- What's up?
- What's all the commotion about?

496
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,777
- This way.
- Jackson.

497
01:05:44,862 --> 01:05:47,030
Joe, how did you get out of prison?

498
01:05:47,156 --> 01:05:49,199
Never mind. I need your help.

499
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:51,618
The ninjas were sent
to kill me in my cell...

500
01:05:51,743 --> 01:05:54,621
All right, wait. Start from the beginning.

501
01:05:54,746 --> 01:05:57,374
The sergeant's got
some big operation going.

502
01:05:58,876 --> 01:06:00,961
OK, hold it. Pull up, yeah.

503
01:06:04,214 --> 01:06:06,300
Get the light over here.

504
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,514
Oh, my God.

505
01:06:13,557 --> 01:06:17,394
This is crazy. You'll get yourself killed.
Why don't we tell the colonel?

506
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:21,482
No, they're leaving in the morning.
I gotta catch Ortega before he leaves.

507
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:25,861
What I need is a jeep. Meet me behind
the motor pool in a half-hour. You got it?

508
01:06:25,986 --> 01:06:29,615
- Yeah.
- And Jackson... be careful, huh?

509
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,992
OK.

510
01:06:49,426 --> 01:06:51,720
Here he comes.

511
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:55,641
- Jackson, what is she doing here?
- You can't go through with it.

512
01:06:55,766 --> 01:06:57,851
- You'll get killed.
- Gimme the jeep.

513
01:06:57,976 --> 01:07:01,313
- Will you trust me on this one?
- Joe, please listen to me, please.

514
01:07:01,438 --> 01:07:04,191
Why don't you talk to my father?
He'll listen to you.

515
01:07:04,316 --> 01:07:08,612
- I know what I'm doing.
- You gotta trust somebody sometime.

516
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:12,282
If I mean anything to you,
please trust me now.

517
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:16,787
- I can't.
- We're the only two people you can trust.

518
01:07:16,912 --> 01:07:18,956
Please, Joe.

519
01:07:20,415 --> 01:07:23,460
- OK. Let's go.
- All right.

520
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:31,176
And you honestly expect me to believe
this cock-and-bull story, Private?

521
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:34,304
It's the truth, sir.
The sergeant's working with Ortega.

522
01:07:34,429 --> 01:07:36,807
And they may be behind the hijackings.

523
01:07:36,932 --> 01:07:42,312
Colonel, may I suggest that we run up
some men, and go kick some ass... sir.

524
01:07:44,439 --> 01:07:47,442
I've known both of these men for years.

525
01:07:47,568 --> 01:07:50,028
The sergeant's my most trusted man.

526
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:53,157
We went through the war
together. You know that.

527
01:07:53,282 --> 01:07:56,493
Dad, can't you check out
Joe's story before it's too late...

528
01:07:56,618 --> 01:07:59,329
...and the missiles get shipped out?

529
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:06,336
Tell you what I'll do. To eliminate any
doubt you might have on this matter...

530
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:10,507
...I'll launch a full-scale
investigation, starting right now.

531
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:13,719
We'll find out if this man's
story is true or not.

532
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:22,144
Hello, this is the colonel. Would you send
a squad of MPs out to my house now?

533
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:25,731
What? When?

534
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:28,650
Yeah, I hear you.

535
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:30,819
Right away.

536
01:08:34,865 --> 01:08:37,284
Well, the ball's in motion.

537
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:40,704
Let's relax and have a cup
of coffee while we're waiting.

538
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:42,706
Janette?

539
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:45,334
Ooh, I told you so.

540
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,904
Sergeant, arrest this man.

541
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:17,199
Draw up the papers necessary
charging him with manslaughter.

542
01:09:17,324 --> 01:09:20,577
- What are you doing?
- Get him outta here, and this time...

543
01:09:20,702 --> 01:09:22,871
...make sure he doesn't escape.

544
01:09:22,996 --> 01:09:25,415
- No, please!
- Stop it, Patricia. Stop it.

545
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:30,128
He killed an officer while escaping the
stockade. This man has a criminal record.

546
01:09:30,254 --> 01:09:33,590
He served time in prison
even before joining the army.

547
01:09:33,715 --> 01:09:35,968
He's no good for you, Patricia.

548
01:09:37,094 --> 01:09:39,138
Is it true, Joe?

549
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:42,516
Take him.

550
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:52,609
Get him! That son of a bitch.

551
01:09:59,074 --> 01:10:01,952
Don't let him get away!
That son of a bitch.

552
01:10:05,539 --> 01:10:07,583
(sirens)

553
01:10:13,714 --> 01:10:15,299
Follow him! Follow him!

554
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:24,057
Stay right there. Stay right there.

555
01:10:38,572 --> 01:10:40,115
Fuckin' bastard.

556
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,588
That way.

557
01:10:57,132 --> 01:11:00,677
Shit! Get outta here. Get outta here!

558
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:03,430
Move your ass
or I'll blow your fuckin' head off!

559
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:31,667
(screams)

560
01:11:55,732 --> 01:11:59,903
- What's the problem? I was sound asleep.
- You said this operation was foolproof.

561
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:03,282
It is, my friend. Let's talk inside.

562
01:12:22,509 --> 01:12:26,722
This Joe has only been
a minor inconvenience.

563
01:12:26,847 --> 01:12:29,933
The shipment will go out
tomorrow as scheduled.

564
01:12:30,058 --> 01:12:33,061
- No one can stop us now.
- It's gone too far.

565
01:12:34,271 --> 01:12:36,315
Too many people know.

566
01:12:36,482 --> 01:12:39,735
We've lost the sergeant and four men,
and the bastard's got away.

567
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:43,530
- He could be anywhere by now.
- Calm down, my friend. Calm down.

568
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:45,699
Come, sit down.

569
01:12:46,617 --> 01:12:48,660
He is a nobody.

570
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:52,831
Even if he finds someone to listen,
who will believe him?

571
01:12:52,956 --> 01:12:57,085
Where's his proof?
No, it's too late to back out now.

572
01:13:38,085 --> 01:13:42,756
- We can't risk it. We're not shipping it out.
- What about those you are trying to help?

573
01:13:42,881 --> 01:13:45,467
Have you forgotten about them?

574
01:13:45,592 --> 01:13:48,679
Without this, their country
could fall to the communists.

575
01:13:48,804 --> 01:13:52,641
One more domino down. Who
knows what country will be next?

576
01:13:52,766 --> 01:13:57,813
It stops now. Maybe later, when things
calm down, but now we must stop.

577
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:05,821
Let me tell you something, my friend.

578
01:14:07,698 --> 01:14:11,577
For me, this is not a private
crusade for a noble cause.

579
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:16,498
I stand to make four million
dollars on this deal. Four.

580
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:20,169
And no one is going to
stop me from collecting it.

581
01:14:20,419 --> 01:14:24,214
I give the orders here, Victor, not you!

582
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:27,426
What are you going to do?
Call out your troops?

583
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:30,179
Create an international incident?

584
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:36,018
It would be very easy for me to reveal
your part in this to your daughter.

585
01:14:36,518 --> 01:14:40,063
What would your precious
daughter think of you then, eh?

586
01:14:42,232 --> 01:14:46,862
We're not shipping it out. I'll be there
in the morning to take everything back.

587
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:49,406
Now you get out.

588
01:14:51,074 --> 01:14:54,328
This has been
a very big mistake, my friend.

589
01:16:25,377 --> 01:16:28,380
You have remembered well.

590
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:30,591
It was you.

591
01:16:30,924 --> 01:16:34,636
- Before the explosion, it was you.
- It is time to remember everything.

592
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:36,805
Come.

593
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:46,064
The haragei.

594
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:48,525
I taught you that when you were six.

595
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:52,613
Do you remember?

596
01:16:56,033 --> 01:16:58,076
When I was six?

597
01:17:03,415 --> 01:17:05,459
When I was six...

598
01:17:07,169 --> 01:17:10,923
...you taught me many
lessons of the haragei.

599
01:17:11,298 --> 01:17:13,342
How to free the mind...

600
01:17:14,343 --> 01:17:16,261
...of thought...

601
01:17:17,805 --> 01:17:20,057
...and let the senses grow.

602
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:24,561
Yes, I remember.

603
01:17:24,686 --> 01:17:27,523
You were just a baby
when I first found you.

604
01:17:27,689 --> 01:17:29,942
I called you Joe.

605
01:17:30,067 --> 01:17:33,278
That was the only American name I knew.

606
01:17:33,403 --> 01:17:36,490
I conditioned your body and your senses.

607
01:17:36,657 --> 01:17:39,368
I only teach you what you need to know...

608
01:17:39,493 --> 01:17:44,832
...so that when the time comes, you can
take your place on the field of honour...

609
01:17:45,082 --> 01:17:47,251
...and meet your destiny.

610
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:50,629
But then the explosion separated us.

611
01:17:51,922 --> 01:17:53,966
The explosion.

612
01:17:58,011 --> 01:18:00,556
There's so much I remember...

613
01:18:02,349 --> 01:18:06,019
...but there's also
so much I don't remember.

614
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:09,690
I let you forget what you saw
before I found you...

615
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:13,527
...so that your mind
would not be clouded with pain.

616
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:17,447
But now you are ready.

617
01:18:20,993 --> 01:18:24,705
The time has come for your final lesson.

618
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:26,874
Kusari-gama.

619
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:29,334
Shuriken.

620
01:18:31,044 --> 01:18:33,088
Sai.

621
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:37,134
Ninja-toh.

622
01:18:42,347 --> 01:18:47,102
These symbols will focus
the ultimate power of purpose.

623
01:18:49,146 --> 01:18:51,106
Jin.

624
01:18:51,231 --> 01:18:53,275
Ritsu.

625
01:18:53,984 --> 01:18:56,028
Sai.

626
01:18:57,112 --> 01:19:00,157
- Zen.
- Koba-dera.

627
01:19:00,574 --> 01:19:04,119
The koba-dera. Ninja magic.

628
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:05,537
Intong jutsu.

629
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:11,210
The ability to seem invisible, to cause
fear and paralysis in your enemies.

630
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:14,713
You are ready, my son.

631
01:19:14,838 --> 01:19:17,674
I will be with you in deed and in my heart.

632
01:19:18,008 --> 01:19:22,012
- Follow the Bushido.
- I will honour the code, Father.

633
01:19:22,221 --> 01:19:24,264
Beware the Black Star Ninja.

634
01:19:24,389 --> 01:19:28,685
He has taken the dark path
and has betrayed the code.

635
01:19:29,228 --> 01:19:33,065
Then... he must die.

636
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,681
Magnifique. Right on time.

637
01:20:11,937 --> 01:20:14,064
Everything is working perfectly.

638
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:25,033
Yes. Do you have the missile?

639
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:29,037
The missile is in a container with
everything else. It's all ready to go.

640
01:20:29,163 --> 01:20:31,331
- Good.
- These are the documents...

641
01:20:31,456 --> 01:20:33,876
...to get the shipment out of the country.

642
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:37,713
Everything is... everyone is taken care of.

643
01:20:37,838 --> 01:20:40,090
- You can leave without delay.
- Thank you.

644
01:20:40,215 --> 01:20:42,259
May I see the money?

645
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:44,428
Of course.

646
01:20:56,982 --> 01:20:59,067
Not until we see the merchandise.

647
01:20:59,193 --> 01:21:02,654
Of course. Right this way.

648
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:17,544
Who is he? Is he one of us?

649
01:21:18,086 --> 01:21:20,756
The American ninja.

650
01:21:21,715 --> 01:21:24,218
American! What do you want?

651
01:21:29,515 --> 01:21:31,099
Kill him!

652
01:21:38,607 --> 01:21:40,651
Get the girl.

653
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:44,988
I'll be right back.

654
01:21:57,209 --> 01:21:59,503
American!

655
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:02,714
It was a nice try!
But it wasn't good enough!

656
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,883
I have your girlfriend here!

657
01:22:06,343 --> 01:22:10,556
You have 30 seconds to surrender,
or your girlfriend is dead!

658
01:22:10,681 --> 01:22:12,516
Joe, don't do it!

659
01:22:15,269 --> 01:22:17,312
30 seconds!

660
01:22:18,147 --> 01:22:19,648
I know you can hear me.

661
01:22:19,773 --> 01:22:23,694
Or maybe you don't like her
as much as she thinks you do?

662
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:32,995
Five...

663
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,414
...four...

664
01:22:37,499 --> 01:22:39,793
- Very good.
- Let her go!

665
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:42,921
Letting her go wasn't part of the deal.

666
01:22:43,755 --> 01:22:45,466
Kill him.

667
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:05,861
Calma, calma.

668
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:15,787
It's all right. Just relax.

669
01:23:30,594 --> 01:23:33,639
Víctor, esto es
demasiado riesgo para mí.

670
01:23:38,435 --> 01:23:39,895
It's all right, believe me.

671
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:36,994
Up ahead!

672
01:25:05,564 --> 01:25:06,440
(shout)

673
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:26,668
(shouts)

674
01:25:38,388 --> 01:25:41,225
Hang on, charleys.
I'm taking this bitch uptown.

675
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:43,018
Take me home, baby.

676
01:26:24,393 --> 01:26:26,436
Holy shit.

677
01:26:50,002 --> 01:26:53,714
Got you tight, huh?
How do you like that in your nuts?

678
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:38,300
Mira Víctor, demasiado riesgo.
Para otro día mejor. Me voy.

679
01:27:38,425 --> 01:27:41,136
- No, you can't leave. You stay here.
- Next time.

680
01:27:41,261 --> 01:27:43,305
You stay here!

681
01:27:48,602 --> 01:27:50,395
Bring the girl.

682
01:27:58,028 --> 01:28:00,072
(Patricia screams)

683
01:28:13,585 --> 01:28:15,629
(screams)

684
01:28:53,083 --> 01:28:58,005
- Let her go, Victor!
- Listen to me. All I want is the money.

685
01:28:58,130 --> 01:29:01,508
Let me go to the helicopter
and your daughter will be free.

686
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:04,428
Don't do it! You know I will kill her.

687
01:29:05,721 --> 01:29:08,474
Hold your fire! Nobody shoot.

688
01:29:09,725 --> 01:29:11,768
All right, let her go, Victor!

689
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:14,980
Let her go!

690
01:29:16,231 --> 01:29:17,941
Get in.

691
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:20,944
Get in. Go! Go!

692
01:29:25,032 --> 01:29:26,325
Go!

693
01:29:29,912 --> 01:29:32,998
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait for the ninja.

694
01:30:40,023 --> 01:30:41,650
Go, go, go!

695
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,351
Help! Joe!

696
01:31:37,539 --> 01:31:39,583
Yeah, come on, Joe.

697
01:31:42,503 --> 01:31:43,712
(screams)

698
01:31:49,551 --> 01:31:51,637
Get off it, man, get off it.

699
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,936
All right. Now I gotcha.

700
01:32:19,748 --> 01:32:21,667
Joe!
