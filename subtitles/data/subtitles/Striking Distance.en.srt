00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:52,281
Police Department, zone one.
Sergeant Roberts.

2
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:34,445
The Polish Hill Strangler
has claimed a fourth victim.

3
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:39,922
The nude body of Arlene Dunn
was recovered from the Ohio River.

4
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:43,843
Police had been alerted
to the crimes by the killer, -

5
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:47,797
- who taunts them by playing the
song "Little Red Riding Hood".

6
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:51,928
The police brutality trial
of Detective Jimmy Detillo is over.

7
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:57,925
Detillo was convicted
for the beating ofLeon Watson.

8
00:03:58,089 --> 00:04:02,128
Watson remains in a coma.
The key to the conviction -

9
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:07,727
- was the testimony of Detillo's
partner and cousin Thomas Hardy.

10
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:13,964
Hardy testified that his partner
used unwarranted force.

11
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:18,122
Come on, son, we're gonna
be late for the policeman's ball.

12
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,641
- You've got to face him sometime.
- I feel like an asshole.

13
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:27,121
Maybe you are an asshole.
You always were kind of strange.

14
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:33,808
- I had you as a role model.
- You got that from your mother.

15
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:38,759
- I see you got the boat fixed.
- Yeah, we're going out tomorrow.

16
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:47,287
What's the latest
on Little Red Riding Hood?

17
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:55,720
We get close, he slips away.
I'm telling you, Dad, it's a cop.

18
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:00,121
Maybe an ex-cop.
Uncle Nick thinks so, too.

19
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:06,361
- Did you talk to him about Jimmy?
- We talked around it.

20
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:10,238
Every cop in Pittsburgh
thinks I'm a rat.

21
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:14,288
You're not a rat.
You told the truth. Nick knows that.

22
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:17,680
Yeah, we'll look where it's got me.

23
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:22,240
It's tough, but you know
what my dad used to say?

24
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,846
"Loyalty above all else,
except honour."

25
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:34,962
We're pursuing a murdersuspect.
'89 Ford, dark blue, RHX715.

26
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:38,326
Wejust crossed
the 31st StreetBridge.

27
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:41,322
Suspectis armed and dangerous.

28
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:47,086
- Let's go.
- So much for the policeman's ball.

29
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:54,599
Take Bigelow.

30
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:06,598
- Don't you have a date tonight?
- You're my date.

31
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:11,564
- What happened to that nurse?
- It just didn't work out.

32
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:20,841
You've got to give these things
a chance, Tommy.

33
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:26,764
That girl that works for Dutch
is awful nice.

34
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:36,206
- Is there some meaning in all this?
- Grandkids.

35
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:42,438
What?
I'm not that grown up myself yet.

36
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:53,528
- There they are.
- Go down the alley.

37
00:07:57,249 --> 00:08:00,525
Send an ambulance
to the southbound tube.

38
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:18,403
We'll trap him at 2nd Ave.

39
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:06,284
Captain Hardy.

40
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:12,726
Get out of the car now
with your hands up.

41
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:22,401
- Uncle Nick.
- Is this the policeman's ball?

42
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:29,165
This is your last chance.
Get out with your hands up.

43
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:36,324
Here he comes.

44
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:06,606
He drives like a cop.

45
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:18,605
Pull up to him.

46
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:41,048
Come on, fellas, easy.

47
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:49,801
My leg!

48
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:54,565
Something's wrong with my leg.

49
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:02,289
- Where's Dad?
- Tommy, listen ...

50
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:13,005
He's been shot, Tommy.
The killer got away.

51
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:19,689
Daddy! Jesus Christ!

52
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:41,966
Look who's here.

53
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:48,199
- Tommy, sorry about your father.
- Thanks, Don.

54
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:51,566
You just couldn't stay away.

55
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:59,204
Why come to the sentencing?
We've already heard your testimony.

56
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:05,047
- Uncle Nick.
- Hi, Tommy.

57
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:10,008
- How are you feeling?
- I don't know.

58
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:13,798
- How's the leg?
- Okay.

59
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:30,160
- I don't want to be here.
- You're a better man than I am.

60
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:34,959
Tommy, they got the guy
that killed your father.

61
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,204
- What is this?
- His name's Kesser.

62
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:48,202
He couldn't even lift those women.

63
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:53,159
We have an eyewitness
that saw him dump a body.

64
00:13:55,569 --> 00:14:00,199
- Even you said it was a cop.
- I said it could be.

65
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:04,885
Now we have a witness
that said it wasn't.

66
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:11,119
- Dad, let's go in.
- Sit down, I'll be right with you.

67
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:16,727
Go ahead. Sit down.
I'll be right in.

68
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:23,202
I don't want any problems with you.
Do you understand me?

69
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:27,487
You should be glad we caught him.

70
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:40,800
Where is he?

71
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:47,208
They're going to throw the book
at him, Nick. Your son or not.

72
00:14:56,689 --> 00:15:01,558
The criminal court of Pennsylvania
is now in session.

73
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:06,678
The sentencing for the State
versus Detective Jimmy Detillo.

74
00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:11,764
The Honourable Judge Hellen Kramer
presiding.

75
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:19,407
- Mr. Gunther, where is your client?
- We don't know, Your Honour.

76
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:33,405
Jimmy ... Son, listen to me.

77
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:40,042
Listen to Daddy. We'll talk to them.
We'll work something out.

78
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:46,005
Mama went off this bridge.
You remember?

79
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:50,128
They never found her.

80
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:53,884
Jimmy, you don't have to do this.

81
00:15:54,049 --> 00:16:00,807
Cops don't go to prison, Dad.
I don't go!

82
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:09,359
Are you gonna give him a push?

83
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:13,765
- Jimmy!
- Hey, Tommy.

84
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:21,127
That's my partner.
My flesh and blood!

85
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:26,804
Come on down.
You're scaring everybody.

86
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,762
- Who's the best cop now?
- You, Jimmy. Always you.

87
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:44,601
Who's the best cop now?

88
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:50,366
Always you, Jim.
Come on down.

89
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:55,080
Come on, partner. Just take my hand.

90
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,399
Come on.

91
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:04,525
Come on down.

92
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:09,528
- No!
- Jimmy!

93
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:25,720
- You motherfucker! You did this.
- Let go of him.

94
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:33,359
You did this. Fuck you!

95
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:21,006
No, Bob!

96
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:24,844
Don't lick me with that fish breath.

97
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,643
Hey, Hardy.

98
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,565
RIVER RESCUE

99
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:17,405
He's still on the sauce.
He'll be sleeping it off somewhere.

100
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:21,403
He's a fifth generation cop.
He'll show.

101
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:26,518
Yeah? Who wants to bet?

102
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:30,443
- $20 says he don't show.
- You're on.

103
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:42,726
Thank you.

104
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:49,042
- Tie that up for me, will you?
- Hardy!

105
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:52,246
I've been calling you for an hour.

106
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,879
You missed roll call.

107
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:01,601
Penderman's really pissed.

108
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:06,478
You look like shit.
Did you fall off the wagon?

109
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:13,999
You're a fucking mess.
I'm sick of taking shit for you.

110
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:17,957
- What do I put in the log?
- Will you get the stern line?

111
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:22,725
You're a real asshole.
How did I end up with you?

112
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:35,324
Hardy!

113
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:39,960
Get some dry clothes on, Sacco.
I'll catch you on the next run.

114
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:49,162
River Rescue 9221, this is base.

115
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:53,641
We have a 111
one mile south of Neville lsland.

116
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:57,245
10-4.

117
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:05,957
Kim Lee, get Hardy.

118
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:11,360
- 9221, this is base. Come in.
- Go ahead.

119
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:19,083
This is Penderman.
Get back here and pick up Sacco.

120
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:22,878
Hardy. Hardy!

121
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:27,725
Malfunction on his radio, sir.
Like when you shut it off.

122
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:53,719
- Jeff Schultz. Where's your diver?
- He fell off.

123
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:16,204
Open it up.

124
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:20,286
Stand back, please.

125
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:28,959
Shot in the heart. Small caliber.
Been in the water 48 hours.

126
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:32,201
Less. 24 hours.

127
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:36,203
She's been dead 48 though.
Somebody held on to her a while.

128
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:41,807
- Who's this guy?
- Tom Hardy.

129
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:45,920
- Tom Hardy?
- The infamous.

130
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:50,207
- Uncle Nick.
- How are you?

131
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:57,764
- How come you never call me?
- I call, you're always busy.

132
00:22:59,649 --> 00:23:04,359
- Danny's back.
- Where was he all this time?

133
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:07,327
California, someplace.

134
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:10,686
- What did he say?
- Nothing much. You know Danny.

135
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:14,205
- How are the treating you at work?
- Good.

136
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:20,842
I read that Rossmore is retiring.
Are you gonna be the next chief?

137
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:26,129
Not me, kid.
I'm just a Larimer Avenue dago.

138
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:32,637
- I hear they're gonna fry Kesser.
- That's what they do with killers.

139
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:40,049
- I'll see you around.
- Come on, let's go.

140
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:44,686
When I grow up, I'd love
to have a pair of shorts like that.

141
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:48,637
- How's your wife, Eddie?
- None of your fucking business.

142
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:54,008
How would you know ...
You're his partner, how's his wife?

143
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:59,446
Eddie's picking on me again,
Uncle Nick.

144
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:05,127
One of these days
it's just going to be you and me!

145
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:07,849
Workers discovered the nude body
wrapped in a sheet.

146
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:14,527
Workers discovered the nude body
wrapped in a sheet.

147
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:18,967
She was identified as
Cheryl Putnam of Monessen.

148
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:24,487
Miss Putnam, a stewardess,
was abducted from her home, -

149
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:30,838
- then taken to another location,
where she was murdered.

150
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:35,958
The brutal crime reminds many
of the Polish Hillstranglings.

151
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:40,964
There's no connection other than
the victim being a white female.

152
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:46,965
The Polish Hill victims were
strangled, not shot at close range.

153
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:09,567
- You picked the wrong house to rob.
- You got nothing worth stealing.

154
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:18,565
- It's been a long time.
- I could've killed you.

155
00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:23,359
- I wanted to surprise you.
- You did.

156
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:29,001
Give me a drink.
Why do you live on a houseboat?

157
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:33,208
You and your old man
should've burned this place down.

158
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:38,363
- How was California?
- Sunny.

159
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:44,843
Sunny? You're out there two years
and that's all you can tell me?

160
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:49,560
"The Simpsons"
are on an hour earlier.

161
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:55,684
Are you still mad at me?

162
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:58,921
Yeah, well, I fucked up.

163
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:06,399
After that night on the bridge ...
I blamed you for Jimmy.

164
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:12,358
Yeah, I blamed me, too.

165
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:17,922
- I looked for you at the funeral.
- I couldn't deal with it.

166
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:25,165
An empty coffin like my mom's ...
The river took half my family.

167
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:28,401
It never gave them back, either.

168
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:33,324
I was wondering
what happened to that picture.

169
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:38,048
You, me and Jimmy at my dad's
cabin. All going to be cops.

170
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:44,964
- Brilliant idea.
- Look at us now.

171
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:48,565
I'm a dropout. Jimmy's dead.

172
00:26:48,729 --> 00:26:53,439
- And you're one of those ...
- Water dogs.

173
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:04,567
It wasn't your fault
what happened to Jimmy.

174
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:09,757
He had something wrong with him.
He did, like my mom.

175
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:15,561
Nobody noticed it, until he beat
that suspect. But I noticed it ...

176
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:22,362
I never did anything about it.
You did the right thing.

177
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:27,319
- Fuck 'em.
- Fuck 'em.

178
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:34,679
- So, are you back now?
- I'm back.

179
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:41,004
- You want to get something to eat?
- No, I've got to meet a girl.

180
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:44,802
Danny ...

181
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:52,044
Welcome home, man.

182
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:58,122
HARDY-CHRISTMAN

183
00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:11,886
- Hey, Kim Lee.
- How are you doing, Hardy?

184
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:16,167
- Who's Christman?
- Jo Christman. New diver.

185
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:22,598
- What's he like?
- Not what you'd expect.

186
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:31,721
Come on in, Tom.

187
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:36,366
Tom Hardy, Jo Christman.

188
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:40,522
She's a police officer,
a qualified diver and a paramedic.

189
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:45,968
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

190
00:28:49,689 --> 00:28:53,477
- No.
- Okay.

191
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:03,279
- Can I ask you what he said?
- No.

192
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:05,599
Thanks.

193
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:18,280
I hope she floats.

194
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:33,159
You want to get
that stern line, please?

195
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:28,522
- Afternoon.
- Hello.

196
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:34,202
Give me the bottle.
Let me rephrase that:

197
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:38,157
Give me the bottle now.

198
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:50,642
- You know this is a no-wake zone?
- No, sir, I didn't.

199
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:57,877
- Drive a little slower next time.
- We have to give them a ticket.

200
00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:02,281
- No, we don't.
- They were speeding.

201
00:31:02,449 --> 00:31:07,569
You better do it. I'm not sure
I can stand the excitement.

202
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:14,641
Sir, I need your registration.

203
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:49,918
- Hardy, did you see that?
- Yeah.

204
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:29,808
Take the wheel.

205
00:32:30,489 --> 00:32:35,643
Keep heading up the river.
Tell Penderman to send backup.

206
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:59,448
River Rescue, this is 9221, over.

207
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:28,840
Land shark.

208
00:34:11,729 --> 00:34:16,757
How many men upstairs?
Let me rephrase that.

209
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:22,003
- Two, plus a pilot.
- Close your eyes. Close 'em.

210
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:33,477
Where's the $200,000?
I'll blow your head off.

211
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:40,608
Pittsburgh Police.
We have two choices here.

212
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:46,002
You either put the guns down
or we all start shooting.

213
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,285
I'll shoot!

214
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:08,044
Hey, man, untie us!

215
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:30,719
Behind you!

216
00:35:46,249 --> 00:35:48,365
Thanks, Dutch.

217
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:56,447
Hey, you did really good
out there tonight.

218
00:35:56,609 --> 00:36:00,648
- Thanks, Hardy.
- Really good.

219
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:04,688
- Thanks.
- Goodnight.

220
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:12,007
- I've never had a woman partner.
- Neither have l.

221
00:36:21,169 --> 00:36:28,519
- You guys are understaffed.
- This is the new effiiciency system.

222
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:35,162
- See you tomorrow.
- No, I'm off until Wednesday.

223
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:36,438
Damn it!

224
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:56,203
Hello.

225
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:03,404
Who is this?

226
00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:06,447
Who is this?

227
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:41,168
PITTSBURGH DEPARTMENT
OF PUBLIC SAFTEY

228
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:12,405
KESSER

229
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:15,240
CHICANIS

230
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:35,121
Tom, what are you doing here?
Are all the bars closed?

231
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,281
Just visiting some old friends.

232
00:39:39,649 --> 00:39:44,848
- You don't have any old friends.
- Who'd know that better than you?

233
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:52,842
Yeah, old friends.
Goddamn it. Mother fucker!

234
00:39:53,009 --> 00:39:56,319
He was in the Polish Hill files.

235
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:02,121
Hey, Tom.

236
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:06,685
What are those? What is that?

237
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:11,923
What? This?
Nothing, just some papers.

238
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:17,083
As the ltalians say, "Don't scald
your tongue on another man's soup."

239
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:21,959
There's an lrish saying:
"Never listen to ltalian sayings."

240
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:28,648
I knew this was going to happen.
You just won't let go, will you?

241
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:33,325
I can't lay down on this.
My father's in a grave ...

242
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:38,722
- We've got the guy who killed him.
- A cop killed my father!

243
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:44,805
- Kesser doesn't have the brains.
- He was convicted in court ...

244
00:40:44,969 --> 00:40:47,642
- Answer me!
- I'm telling you!

245
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:53,839
Your father is dead
and this case is closed!

246
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:57,718
If you can't accept that,
that's your problem.

247
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:02,599
I can take that gun and that badge
away from you right now.

248
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:08,560
- Is that what you want?
- Do what you got to do, Nick.

249
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:22,808
Hardy, we're out of our patrol zone.

250
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:28,199
Will you tell me where we're going?

251
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:31,247
We're going to visit a friend.

252
00:41:48,529 --> 00:41:52,442
I'll break here for dinner.
I'll be back.

253
00:41:54,969 --> 00:42:00,441
Right ... I'll just stay here
and watch the boat.

254
00:42:29,409 --> 00:42:34,767
- Can I get you something?
- Yeah, a guy named Chicanis.

255
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:39,241
I don't think I've seen him
all night.

256
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:52,448
Okay, tell me what you know!
Who told you to lie?

257
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:56,158
- Give me the names.
- Don't shoot me.

258
00:42:56,329 --> 00:42:59,560
- Hardy, put up your gun.
- Now!

259
00:42:59,729 --> 00:43:03,483
No, put up your gun.

260
00:43:23,889 --> 00:43:28,007
Hardy, damn it!
This shit has got to stop.

261
00:43:28,169 --> 00:43:32,048
If you have a drinking problem ...
You were out of control.

262
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:36,600
- You're already on probation.
- How long have you been a cop?

263
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:42,241
- How many years? One? Two?
- Long enough to know the rules.

264
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:45,287
Partners back each other up.

265
00:43:45,449 --> 00:43:50,603
You have no business telling me how
partners should treat each other.

266
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:54,842
- You had a gun to his head.
- I wasn't going to shoot him.

267
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:58,126
- I'm trying to solve a murder!
- What murder?

268
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:06,803
I hate to tell you this, but you're
not a homicide detective any more.

269
00:44:06,969 --> 00:44:12,362
- 9221, this is base. Come in.
- Hardy.

270
00:44:12,529 --> 00:44:17,159
We've got another 111.
Northshore. East of Glenwood Bridge.

271
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:21,766
Get the bow line.
This is Hardy. We're on our way.

272
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:25,285
Let's go. Now!

273
00:45:24,729 --> 00:45:30,998
If the kids have any bad dreams,
call this number.

274
00:45:31,169 --> 00:45:35,560
We'll send a counsellor out.
Get the kids home now.

275
00:45:35,729 --> 00:45:39,722
Kids, come on. Let's go home.

276
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:47,320
- Why didn't you question them?
- What for?

277
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:52,199
- The body was dumped last night.
- How do you know?

278
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:56,806
I used to be a homicide detective.

279
00:45:59,649 --> 00:46:04,120
- Round up the usual suspects.
- Keep laughing.

280
00:46:10,529 --> 00:46:14,442
It's a sin what he turned into.

281
00:46:16,249 --> 00:46:23,007
Sorry to interrupt your evening.
We've got a dead nurse.

282
00:46:23,169 --> 00:46:27,640
You stay right here. Don't move.

283
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:32,485
Absolutely, Dad.
I wouldn't want to get in the way.

284
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:37,365
Prick!

285
00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:44,842
Paula Puglusi, a nurse.
Same M.O. as the Putnam woman.

286
00:46:46,129 --> 00:46:49,917
Guess who she used to fuck.

287
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:19,643
You knew her?

288
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:25,679
- Yeah.
- God, Tom, I'm sorry.

289
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:31,719
Does that guy you were chasing
have something to do with this?

290
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:37,839
- He was a witness.
- In the Polish Hill case?

291
00:47:38,009 --> 00:47:42,127
I was one
of the investigating officers.

292
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:45,008
Five women were strangled.

293
00:47:45,169 --> 00:47:51,278
During the pursuit of the suspect
my father was killed.

294
00:47:51,449 --> 00:47:57,365
- Chicanis said he saw the killer.
- And you don't believe him?

295
00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:06,158
This was the case
where you lost your shield.

296
00:48:11,649 --> 00:48:16,677
I lost my shield because
I said a cop killed my father.

297
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:28,844
You want to give her one more pop
before they take her away?

298
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:32,968
- I'll give you one more pop.
- Blow it out of your ass.

299
00:48:33,129 --> 00:48:37,645
- Talk to the press for Uncle Nick.
-That's enough.

300
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:45,078
- I thought you quit smoking.
- The gum didn't work.

301
00:48:45,249 --> 00:48:47,046
Who's she?

302
00:48:49,489 --> 00:48:53,960
- That's my new partner.
- Not bad.

303
00:48:54,129 --> 00:48:58,281
- You didn't know about that?
- No, why should l?

304
00:49:02,289 --> 00:49:07,409
Coming back to the force?
See what you're missing?

305
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:16,849
Tommy!

306
00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:21,802
- You want to get some dinner?
- What did I say?

307
00:49:21,969 --> 00:49:27,441
- I just invited him to dinner.
- Go up there!

308
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:42,324
- He hasn't changed a bit.
- Yeah, that's the problem.

309
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:54,241
- What do you know?
- We just fished out the body.

310
00:49:54,409 --> 00:50:00,166
Don't play games with me.
I want to know what you know.

311
00:50:01,489 --> 00:50:05,198
You don't want to hear it.
It's the same guy.

312
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:10,238
- The same guy? As in Polish Hill?
- Fair hair. Good bodies.

313
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:13,640
These women were shot,
not strangled.

314
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:18,121
They had neck bruises
and were bound wrist and ankle.

315
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:21,884
- Eiler told me you know this girl.
- A lot of guys knew her.

316
00:50:22,049 --> 00:50:29,125
If I didn't know better, I'd think
you didn't want to solve this case.

317
00:50:29,289 --> 00:50:31,564
Are you a cop or not?

318
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:37,884
Now you come up with this story
and I'm supposed to believe you.

319
00:50:38,049 --> 00:50:41,485
When was the last time
you saw this girl?

320
00:50:41,649 --> 00:50:45,403
He's putting them in the water
so I'll find them.

321
00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:51,121
- He wants me to find these girls.
- You're crazy, that's it.

322
00:50:51,889 --> 00:50:55,882
- He called me.
- He called you?

323
00:50:56,049 --> 00:51:01,282
- That's right.
- What did he say?

324
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:04,725
- He didn't say anything.
- You dreamed it.

325
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:09,405
Get in your little boat
and get the fuck out of here!

326
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:12,527
You're an alcoholic. You need help.

327
00:51:12,689 --> 00:51:18,480
- Get your head examined.
- Maybe you need a drink.

328
00:51:18,649 --> 00:51:25,566
- It'd ease the pain of being wrong.
- Get out of my sight.

329
00:51:29,929 --> 00:51:36,038
Keep those people out of here!
Am I talking to myself?

330
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:45,564
Put Grandpa back on.

331
00:51:48,529 --> 00:51:51,726
Just a second.

332
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:54,883
She sounds good.

333
00:51:55,649 --> 00:51:58,004
Yes.

334
00:51:58,169 --> 00:52:00,524
Okay, bye-bye.

335
00:52:01,129 --> 00:52:04,838
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you all right?

336
00:52:05,009 --> 00:52:08,718
Yeah, I'm fine.

337
00:52:11,009 --> 00:52:13,921
Okay.

338
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:17,206
This is it. 16 months ago.

339
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:23,046
I didn't murder anybody.
This witness is lying.

340
00:52:23,209 --> 00:52:27,282
One memeber of the police department
agrees with him.

341
00:52:27,449 --> 00:52:31,328
Thomas Hardy
made this statement to the press.

342
00:52:31,489 --> 00:52:34,925
I do not think
Kesser is the killer.

343
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:37,967
Important information was withheld.

344
00:52:38,129 --> 00:52:41,963
Can you tell us
what that information is?

345
00:52:42,129 --> 00:52:48,238
Two of the women
were called from police call boxes.

346
00:52:48,409 --> 00:52:52,322
Why didn't you say that?.

347
00:52:52,729 --> 00:52:55,607
A Pittsburgh cop did it!

348
00:52:55,769 --> 00:52:59,887
An offical police report
denied Hardy's accusations.

349
00:53:00,049 --> 00:53:05,760
The controversy has not
changed Kesser's death sentence.

350
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:10,798
Airtight case.
Kesser had no alibi at all.

351
00:53:10,969 --> 00:53:16,999
He confessed to the murder
of his accomplice as self-defense.

352
00:53:17,169 --> 00:53:19,842
He denied the Polish Hill murders.

353
00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:24,207
We found evidence from the murders
in his hotel room, -

354
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:27,839
- and the gun
that killed Vince Hardy.

355
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:31,968
Then why does Hardy
think that Kesser was framed?

356
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:37,487
Kesser's fingerprints weren't
on the gun. It was a police special.

357
00:53:37,649 --> 00:53:42,404
The serial numbers were erased.
Hardy starts barking conspiracy.

358
00:53:42,569 --> 00:53:46,926
- He thinks the killer's a cop.
- No one thought he was innnocent?

359
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:50,806
Yeah, Kesser.

360
00:53:54,609 --> 00:54:00,161
Well, Bob, he's putting them in
the Allegheny or the Monongahela.

361
00:54:02,009 --> 00:54:05,160
That narrows it down.

362
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:10,361
This is Hardy here. Go.

363
00:54:10,529 --> 00:54:15,000
Hi, it's Jo. Are you going
to the policeman's ball tonight?.

364
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:21,688
I'm going to go.
I don't really know anyone.

365
00:54:21,849 --> 00:54:24,727
Maybe I'll see you there. Bye.

366
00:54:51,089 --> 00:54:54,843
- Don't leave me out here.
- One drink, real quick.

367
00:55:05,649 --> 00:55:09,801
What the hell is he doing here?

368
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:22,364
Captain, he's here.

369
00:55:31,289 --> 00:55:34,440
- Hi.
- Hi.

370
00:55:36,529 --> 00:55:40,044
You look ... different.

371
00:55:42,129 --> 00:55:45,644
I'll take that as a compliment.

372
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:51,041
- I didn't think I'd see you here.
- Nobody did.

373
00:55:53,009 --> 00:55:57,719
Tommy, you made it.
Good to see you, man.

374
00:55:57,889 --> 00:56:02,519
Come on, the whole family's
right over here.

375
00:56:02,689 --> 00:56:07,888
- Dad, look who's here.
- He's got Tommy with him.

376
00:56:09,609 --> 00:56:13,318
Let him go.
Don't keep them waiting.

377
00:56:13,489 --> 00:56:18,085
- Tommy, good to see you, son.
- Hi, Uncle Fred.

378
00:56:19,169 --> 00:56:24,243
- Introduce your date.
- She's not my date.

379
00:56:24,409 --> 00:56:27,082
This is my new partner,
Jo Christman.

380
00:56:27,249 --> 00:56:31,925
Unfortunately, these are the Hardys.
My Uncle Fred.

381
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:36,162
- My cousin Gary.
- Don't fuck her.

382
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:43,280
Tommy, you're too skinny.
Come to our house to eat.

383
00:56:43,449 --> 00:56:47,522
She's right. You ought
to quit being such a stranger.

384
00:56:47,689 --> 00:56:51,159
Now, I'd like to propose a toast.

385
00:56:51,329 --> 00:56:55,402
- To Vince Hardy.
- The best Captain of Homicide ever.

386
00:56:55,569 --> 00:56:58,925
Vince Hardy.

387
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:03,881
How about we drink to my mother?
She was a Hardy, too.

388
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:10,887
And Jimmy, let's drink to him.
It'd be fitting here by the river.

389
00:57:11,049 --> 00:57:15,918
Uncle Vince is dead.
They're dead, too. Drink to Jimmy!

390
00:57:16,089 --> 00:57:20,367
- That's enough!
- No, It's not enough, damn it!

391
00:57:39,649 --> 00:57:44,439
- Let go of me. I'm all right.
- You don't belong here.

392
00:57:44,609 --> 00:57:48,488
- Me and you, Eddie.
- Anytime.

393
00:57:52,489 --> 00:57:58,121
The best day of the year.
Better than Christmas!

394
00:58:03,249 --> 00:58:08,448
- Are these policemen all relatives?
- No, they're just criminals.

395
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:11,726
How did they end up on the force?

396
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:17,521
Part of some nationwide
negative gene pool, I guess.

397
00:58:18,489 --> 00:58:22,767
- Don't do that, okay?
- What?

398
00:58:22,929 --> 00:58:28,049
That thing where you're
not really talking to me.

399
00:58:31,649 --> 00:58:37,963
- That's not the answer.
- It'll do till the answer turns up.

400
00:58:45,129 --> 00:58:49,281
Hey! What the fuck
is the matter with you?

401
00:58:55,889 --> 00:58:59,359
Get out.
Get out now!

402
00:59:03,169 --> 00:59:08,289
You want to sit around drinking
and feeling sorry for yourself.

403
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:13,807
What is this? You won't respect
yourself until someone else does?

404
00:59:13,969 --> 00:59:17,723
I respect you.
You've got a lot of courage.

405
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:22,280
The whole department is waiting
to see you fall on your ass.

406
00:59:22,449 --> 00:59:26,886
- You're giving them what they want.
- They want to keep me silent.

407
00:59:27,049 --> 00:59:31,167
Stupid is almost as good.

408
00:59:31,329 --> 00:59:34,560
Will you go now, please?

409
00:59:34,729 --> 00:59:38,199
Just go home.

410
00:59:38,369 --> 00:59:43,727
No, I don't want to.
I don't want to go home.

411
00:59:59,809 --> 01:00:02,846
What are you doing?

412
01:01:55,569 --> 01:01:59,562
What made you decide
to become a cop?

413
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:06,597
All the shit you've
got to go through ...

414
01:02:06,769 --> 01:02:10,603
... being a woman and all.

415
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:14,603
When I was in college,
my roommate was raped.

416
01:02:14,769 --> 01:02:18,557
The campus police were
only interested in keeping it quiet.

417
01:02:18,729 --> 01:02:22,563
I knew that the guy was white
and very tall.

418
01:02:22,729 --> 01:02:28,167
I started checking out
basketball courts near the campus.

419
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:33,357
From the pictures I took of the
white players she identified him.

420
01:02:33,529 --> 01:02:38,205
- You caught the guy?
- Yeah.

421
01:03:10,049 --> 01:03:14,759
This is the police. Pull over
and stop the engine.

422
01:03:14,929 --> 01:03:20,003
Stop the car ..!
Take the wheel.

423
01:03:20,169 --> 01:03:25,163
This is 9221
in pursuit of a murder suspect, -

424
01:03:25,329 --> 01:03:29,800
- heading west on the railroad
service road at mile 16.

425
01:03:29,969 --> 01:03:33,086
Suspect is armed and dangerous.

426
01:03:33,249 --> 01:03:37,003
- Send backup.
- All units respond.

427
01:03:42,689 --> 01:03:44,725
Hold it steady.

428
01:04:45,169 --> 01:04:49,321
My God!
Yep, it's definitely a rug!

429
01:04:49,489 --> 01:04:54,847
Way to go, Hardy,
you asshole!

430
01:04:55,769 --> 01:04:58,283
Tommy, congratulations.

431
01:04:58,449 --> 01:05:01,805
We're all very proud of you.

432
01:05:01,969 --> 01:05:05,678
You blew up a litter bug's car
and found a carpet.

433
01:05:05,849 --> 01:05:09,922
- It looked like a body.
- Then you're in the wrong job.

434
01:05:25,969 --> 01:05:35,048
Let's just say that it was
the killer and it was a cop.

435
01:05:35,209 --> 01:05:40,408
It'd be very easy for him
to figure out our patrol patterns.

436
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:44,608
He'd just be waiting for us
to come along.

437
01:05:44,769 --> 01:05:50,401
He dumps the rug
to make us look like morons.

438
01:05:54,369 --> 01:05:58,965
- Hardy ...
- Yes.

439
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:07,204
- You should know something ...
- Are you really a man?

440
01:06:08,289 --> 01:06:12,248
- No.
- Good.

441
01:06:14,449 --> 01:06:17,521
But I was married to one.

442
01:06:19,169 --> 01:06:24,163
- A cop?
- Worse. A lawyer.

443
01:06:25,129 --> 01:06:28,360
That is worse.

444
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:32,925
We have a daughter. She's four.

445
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:37,086
- What's her name?
- Sarah.

446
01:06:38,529 --> 01:06:42,044
Nice name.

447
01:06:42,209 --> 01:06:44,200
Thanks.

448
01:06:45,009 --> 01:06:49,958
Is that it?

449
01:07:01,529 --> 01:07:04,839
We shouldn't be doing this
as partners.

450
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:11,482
- We should be taken out and shot.
- We should shoot each other.

451
01:07:11,649 --> 01:07:18,999
- Too much paperwork.
- I'm serious, Tommy.

452
01:07:19,169 --> 01:07:23,367
Well, maybe you're in the wrong job.

453
01:07:34,449 --> 01:07:37,122
Tommy?

454
01:08:05,169 --> 01:08:08,844
STEWARDESS CHERYL PUTNAM
VICTIM

455
01:08:13,169 --> 01:08:16,684
LOTS OF LOVE
CHERYL

456
01:08:24,489 --> 01:08:28,528
Tommy, what's wrong?
What's the matter?

457
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:33,524
THIRD VICTIM
IN 3 RIVERS MURDER CASE

458
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:37,762
Her name was Constance Cabrizzi.

459
01:08:37,929 --> 01:08:41,478
I used to call her Connie.

460
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:45,767
- You knew this girl too?
- I took her to the prom.

461
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:51,167
Amazing coincidence ...
me knowing all these girls.

462
01:08:51,329 --> 01:08:54,241
You knew about the nurse.

463
01:08:54,409 --> 01:08:57,799
Now you know about Cheryl.

464
01:08:57,969 --> 01:09:01,325
And now Connie.

465
01:09:01,489 --> 01:09:05,198
- You've got to tell someone.
- Who?

466
01:09:05,369 --> 01:09:10,807
Who can I trust? I don't know
how high up this goes.

467
01:09:10,969 --> 01:09:15,247
- What do you mean?
- Say I told the wrong person.

468
01:09:15,409 --> 01:09:20,039
- You didn't do this.
- Why? ls it an obvious frame?

469
01:09:20,209 --> 01:09:23,167
It's just like Polish Hill.

470
01:09:23,329 --> 01:09:27,925
That's right, Jo.
It's the same killer!

471
01:09:28,089 --> 01:09:31,684
He killed those girls in '91,
and my father.

472
01:09:31,849 --> 01:09:36,479
Now he's killing women I knew
and leaving them for me to find.

473
01:09:37,969 --> 01:09:43,043
- You're scaring me.
- It's scaring me, too.

474
01:09:43,209 --> 01:09:47,725
All the women in my life
keep turning up dead.

475
01:09:51,609 --> 01:09:51,769
There is absolutely no connection
between Polish Hill and this.

476
01:09:51,769 --> 01:09:58,447
There is absolutely no connection
between Polish Hill and this.

477
01:09:58,609 --> 01:10:04,605
If you print that in your paper,
I'm knocking you off this beat.

478
01:10:07,889 --> 01:10:12,041
The tip checked out. Hardy went
to high school with Cabrizzi.

479
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:17,237
That's two out of three. I bet
we can tie him to Cheryl Putnam.

480
01:10:17,409 --> 01:10:23,245
- You want me to bring him in?
- No, we couldn't hold him on that.

481
01:10:24,129 --> 01:10:27,804
We can put him under review.
I'll call internal affairs.

482
01:10:27,969 --> 01:10:32,918
- He'll be put under surveillance.
- He is under surveillance.

483
01:10:33,089 --> 01:10:37,162
- Close surveillance?
- It doesn't get any closer.

484
01:10:40,849 --> 01:10:44,683
Thank you very much, Officer Sacco.

485
01:10:48,569 --> 01:10:52,323
I'd like to call
Detective Emily Harper.

486
01:11:08,569 --> 01:11:13,962
Raise your right hand, please.
Do you swear to tell the truth?

487
01:11:14,129 --> 01:11:16,643
- I do.
- State your name.

488
01:11:16,809 --> 01:11:20,438
Detective Emily Harper.

489
01:11:21,609 --> 01:11:27,081
Are you a member of the Police
lnternal Affairs Division?

490
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:33,358
- Yes.
- What was your last assignment?

491
01:11:33,529 --> 01:11:39,559
The assignment was to
rate Officer Hardy's competence -

492
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:43,324
- and to monitor his interest
in the Three Rivers murder case.

493
01:11:43,489 --> 01:11:48,085
You state that Officer Hardy
neglected his duties -

494
01:11:48,249 --> 01:11:54,279
- to pursue an illegal investigation
into the Three Rivers murder case.

495
01:11:54,449 --> 01:11:59,398
To what do you attribute
his unusal interest in the case?

496
01:11:59,569 --> 01:12:04,165
He feels the murders were committed
by the Polish Hill murderer.

497
01:12:04,329 --> 01:12:10,199
A case he worked on.
A prosecution witness in the case -

498
01:12:10,369 --> 01:12:14,123
- said that Officer Hardy
threatened him.

499
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:18,362
And that you were forced
to protect him with your own weapon.

500
01:12:18,529 --> 01:12:21,327
No, that's incorrect.

501
01:12:21,489 --> 01:12:27,086
- I drew my weapon as backup.
- Backup?

502
01:12:29,009 --> 01:12:35,084
Officer Hardy was not ...
out of control and dangerous?

503
01:12:35,249 --> 01:12:39,720
At no time whatsoever.

504
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:46,442
Hardy is courageous and resourceful.
I wish we had more officers ...

505
01:12:46,609 --> 01:12:51,558
- Excuse me ...
- Don't you want my evaluation?

506
01:12:51,729 --> 01:12:56,439
Thank you, Detective,
you may step down.

507
01:12:58,449 --> 01:13:02,124
Ten-minute recess.

508
01:13:27,289 --> 01:13:30,520
I'm sorry.

509
01:13:31,849 --> 01:13:35,808
- Why'd you change your testimony?
- Why do you think?

510
01:13:42,289 --> 01:13:45,964
- You cheat good.
- Hardy.

511
01:14:37,569 --> 01:14:42,165
Hi, Emily, it's your father.
Sarah just wanted to say hello.

512
01:14:42,329 --> 01:14:48,040
She's enjoying her visit.
We'll see you Sunday. Bye.

513
01:14:49,249 --> 01:14:55,119
Hi, Jo ... I mean Emily.
I'll never get used to that name.

514
01:14:55,289 --> 01:15:01,000
It took a lot of courage to do
what you did at the hearing.

515
01:15:01,169 --> 01:15:05,401
Maybe we can talk.
Call me. Bye.

516
01:15:26,009 --> 01:15:29,160
Yes, Bob, I know you're hungry.

517
01:15:29,329 --> 01:15:33,083
You're always hungry.
Go catch a rat.

518
01:15:35,569 --> 01:15:40,279
Let's see what our friends
the coastguard have for us.

519
01:15:45,889 --> 01:15:48,198
Let's see.

520
01:16:04,089 --> 01:16:06,967
Nothing up there but cabins.

521
01:16:08,969 --> 01:16:10,925
Jesus Christ!

522
01:16:16,289 --> 01:16:20,328
Bob, will you get that ...

523
01:16:22,729 --> 01:16:26,119
This is Hardy here. Go.

524
01:17:02,329 --> 01:17:05,002
Jo!

525
01:17:10,129 --> 01:17:12,848
Kim Lee! No!

526
01:17:17,329 --> 01:17:22,198
Oh, God! It stops now!

527
01:18:32,409 --> 01:18:36,880
Hands high, Danny.
Where's the girl? I know everything.

528
01:18:37,049 --> 01:18:41,964
- I got your note.
- What note?

529
01:18:42,129 --> 01:18:44,324
Jesus Christ!

530
01:19:07,729 --> 01:19:14,999
The key to Detillo's conviction
was the testimony of Thomas Hardy.

531
01:19:19,289 --> 01:19:22,406
Surprised?

532
01:19:22,569 --> 01:19:25,163
Hello, Jimmy.

533
01:19:25,329 --> 01:19:28,127
I got you.

534
01:19:28,289 --> 01:19:34,319
I got you good, didn't l? Admit it.

535
01:19:35,329 --> 01:19:38,082
Yeah.

536
01:19:38,609 --> 01:19:41,487
Yes!

537
01:19:43,209 --> 01:19:47,407
What a world!
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

538
01:19:47,569 --> 01:19:52,245
I jump off a bridge.
I don't die. Go figure.

539
01:19:52,409 --> 01:19:55,401
And you ...

540
01:19:56,169 --> 01:20:00,128
... being so smart.

541
01:20:00,289 --> 01:20:06,922
That must be a real comfort to you
at a time like this.

542
01:20:07,089 --> 01:20:11,401
- Jimmy.
- Shut up! Shut your fucking mouth!

543
01:20:11,569 --> 01:20:17,804
I loved you. You're my brother
and you betrayed me for him.

544
01:20:18,049 --> 01:20:23,521
You knew I was the best cop!
Say it!

545
01:20:23,689 --> 01:20:27,921
- Who's the best cop?
- Jimmy was the best cop!

546
01:20:35,889 --> 01:20:39,484
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

547
01:20:46,649 --> 01:20:50,437
Tommy, let's have a drink.

548
01:20:50,609 --> 01:20:53,567
Me and you. Just like the old days.

549
01:20:53,729 --> 01:20:58,280
Remember?
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

550
01:20:58,449 --> 01:21:03,079
What's the matter?
You're a drunk, aren't you?

551
01:21:03,249 --> 01:21:06,047
Drink it!

552
01:21:07,569 --> 01:21:12,199
Are you too proud
to drink with a dead man?

553
01:21:15,009 --> 01:21:21,448
Maybe I should drink
with your little dove.

554
01:21:26,449 --> 01:21:29,043
Hey.

555
01:21:29,209 --> 01:21:34,363
- Leave her alone, Jimmy.
- Shut up!

556
01:21:44,049 --> 01:21:48,520
So, I'm killing all these girls ...

557
01:21:52,209 --> 01:21:56,441
He's riding next to me
wondering who's doing it.

558
01:21:56,609 --> 01:22:02,127
We're investigating the crimes.
Me and my partner.

559
01:22:02,369 --> 01:22:08,524
You've been a very bad boy,
fucking your new partner.

560
01:22:09,169 --> 01:22:11,603
Did you get fucked, honey?

561
01:22:11,769 --> 01:22:17,321
Well, Tommy has made a career
out of fucking his partners.

562
01:22:17,489 --> 01:22:23,200
- Let the girl go.
- Shut up or I'll kill you.

563
01:22:23,369 --> 01:22:26,202
- Bye-bye, Tommy.
- Jimmy!

564
01:22:26,369 --> 01:22:29,202
I like this game.

565
01:22:29,369 --> 01:22:33,806
Everybody dies,
and they all die with Tommy's gun.

566
01:22:33,969 --> 01:22:38,679
Now we've got us a game.

567
01:22:38,849 --> 01:22:44,685
- Say goodbye to her, Tommy.
- Jimmy, don't do it!

568
01:22:44,849 --> 01:22:48,159
- Jimmy, no!
- Say goodbye to her.

569
01:22:48,329 --> 01:22:51,480
Jimmy!

570
01:22:51,649 --> 01:22:56,677
Put the gun down, son. Please.
Listen to Daddy.

571
01:22:56,849 --> 01:23:00,888
- Put the gun down.
- What fun would that be, Dad?

572
01:23:01,649 --> 01:23:05,528
It's all over, son.
Put the gun down.

573
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:09,364
- It's just starting.
- Please!

574
01:23:12,249 --> 01:23:15,559
I think Tommy
has some questions for you.

575
01:23:16,769 --> 01:23:20,921
Tommy? Comments? Come on.

576
01:23:23,409 --> 01:23:26,128
Should I help him along, Dad?

577
01:23:26,289 --> 01:23:30,362
You know your dad,
God bless his lrish soul ...

578
01:23:30,529 --> 01:23:34,442
He was ...
How shall I put it?

579
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:37,806
He was sort of killed.

580
01:23:42,009 --> 01:23:45,638
Tell Tommy who killed his dad.

581
01:23:45,809 --> 01:23:48,039
Tell Tommy.

582
01:23:48,209 --> 01:23:51,963
Come on, tell him!

583
01:23:56,609 --> 01:24:01,922
Don't move or I'll fucking kill you!
Son of a bitch.

584
01:24:07,569 --> 01:24:09,685
Jimmy!

585
01:24:10,609 --> 01:24:12,839
Get up!

586
01:24:13,009 --> 01:24:16,001
Get up!

587
01:24:21,169 --> 01:24:28,086
- I'll kill you.
- I'm your son.

588
01:24:28,249 --> 01:24:31,685
Let me go.

589
01:24:31,849 --> 01:24:35,728
Let me go.

590
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:53,481
- Freeze! Stop or I'll shoot!
- Vince, no!

591
01:25:00,529 --> 01:25:05,842
I'm sorry, Tommy. I never meant
for any of this to happen.

592
01:25:06,009 --> 01:25:09,718
He was my son.

593
01:25:11,489 --> 01:25:18,008
But it's over now, because
we're going in ... together.

594
01:25:24,049 --> 01:25:28,964
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

595
01:25:29,129 --> 01:25:33,361
Come on, shoot me.

596
01:25:33,529 --> 01:25:36,726
You couldn't do it before.

597
01:25:36,889 --> 01:25:40,768
You just don't have it in you.

598
01:25:47,089 --> 01:25:49,967
Shoot your own son?

599
01:25:51,809 --> 01:25:56,678
There goes that gold watch.

600
01:26:05,089 --> 01:26:11,085
A bullet proof vest!
Who's the best cop now?

601
01:26:22,889 --> 01:26:29,647
- Come on, Jimmy! Me and you!
- Go on. Run, you son of a bitch.

602
01:26:37,129 --> 01:26:39,085
Tommy!

603
01:26:39,249 --> 01:26:42,366
I just want to talk to you!

604
01:26:57,329 --> 01:27:01,766
Tommy, what are you
making me chase you for?

605
01:27:02,649 --> 01:27:06,164
Come on, are you mad at me?

606
01:27:08,569 --> 01:27:12,847
I just shot my dad.

607
01:27:16,289 --> 01:27:20,282
Call me, Tommy. No, I'll call you.

608
01:27:35,969 --> 01:27:40,360
- Get these handcuffs off me.
- Why are you handcuffed?

609
01:27:40,529 --> 01:27:43,805
Where's Detillo?

610
01:27:43,969 --> 01:27:48,679
- He's been shot! Get off!
- I'm not getting off.

611
01:27:53,489 --> 01:27:56,367
Hardy, you son of a bitch!

612
01:28:40,209 --> 01:28:43,121
Get away from me!

613
01:30:21,089 --> 01:30:24,604
You could never beat me!

614
01:31:06,809 --> 01:31:09,642
You like to jump off bridges.

615
01:32:24,209 --> 01:32:27,406
Who's the best cop now?

616
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:09,880
- Take these handcuffs off me.
- Get some handcuff keys.

617
01:33:24,089 --> 01:33:31,325
- Do you want to take a shot at me?
- No.

618
01:33:31,489 --> 01:33:35,004
It wouldn't do any good, Eddie.

619
01:33:38,969 --> 01:33:43,042
On the other hand ...

620
01:33:44,089 --> 01:33:47,240
Hardy!

621
01:33:49,569 --> 01:33:52,720
You're okay.

622
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:58,967
VINCENT THOMAS HARDY

623
01:33:59,129 --> 01:34:02,758
LOYALTY ABOVE ALL ELSE,
EXCEPT HONOUR

624
01:34:19,849 --> 01:34:23,319
Grandkids, Dad.

625
