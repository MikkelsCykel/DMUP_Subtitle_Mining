00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,142
Bobby!

3
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,843
Bobby, are you in there with Amada?
Bobby!

4
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,320
- It's Jumbo.
- I'll be out in a second, Jumbo.

5
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,583
You gotta come out.

6
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:17,059
There's chicks dancing naked right
in the bar, in the lobby. Unbelievable.

7
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,458
- We gotta go.
- What?

8
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,690
- Bob!
- We gotta go.

9
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,266
Oh, fuck, I forgot.

10
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,101
Bob!

11
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,800
Fucking animal.

12
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,705
I gotta ask Mr. Buzhayev
if we can take the night off.

13
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,607
I love you.

14
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:38,348
I'm gonna run across the street.
You meet me at the car, okay?

15
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,746
- Okay. Go.
- Amada...

16
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:46,153
...l'm the luckiest man on the planet.
If I died right now, I'd be happy.

17
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,139
Hey, Mr. Green,
thanks for hooking me up, man.

18
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,710
How are you?

19
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,573
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey.

20
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,443
You got the best club in Brooklyn.

21
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,642
Just wait
till I take over Manhattan, baby.

22
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,811
Hey, do me a favor. Get them
a couple of drinks, all right?

23
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:35,240
Hey, baby, give me my purse.
I'm meeting the family tonight.

24
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,501
I don't want Coco paying
for his shit tonight.

25
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,305
Not after that little mix-up
we had last weekend, ladies.

26
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,504
- All right.
- Bye.

27
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,148
Bye, Amada. Good luck, girl.

28
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,858
Take it off! Take it off!

29
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,498
Hey, get the fuck down here!

30
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,661
Hey, you! Get the fuck down!

31
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,567
Calm down. Let's give them space.
Good looking out, Jumbo.

32
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,075
No problem, Bob.

33
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,443
Oh, what the fuck?!

34
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,242
- Don't strain yourself.
- You got it.

35
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,646
Looks like everything's under control.
I'll take my break.

36
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,844
I didn't do nothing!

37
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,216
You're bleeding all over the place.
Go home.

38
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,483
- Freddie, take him home.
- I didn't do nothing.

39
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,684
Go easy on them, Jumbo.

40
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,233
I'm going across the street to see
the boss. Bring my car around.

41
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,310
- You got it. I need you to come...
- Be right back.

42
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,413
Hi, Kalina. Look at you.

43
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,289
You wanna go with me to
the club, huh? Do a little dance?

44
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,386
- Hey, everybody!
- Hey, Bobby.

45
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,625
- Hey, Mr. Buzhayev, how are you?
- Look, she got the watch.

46
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:12,100
Oh, yeah, it's great. I told you.
He's the best.

47
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,262
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I know deals.

48
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,464
Digital.

49
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:19,236
Yeah, it's great. Hey, listen.
I gotta go do something tonight...

50
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,313
...but Freddie will watch the place,
make the night drop later.

51
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,246
Good. So how is my club doing?

52
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,783
- Everything's fine.
- Good.

53
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,911
For me? Just this one.

54
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,422
Amada tells me I put on 5 pounds
every time I come over here.

55
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,255
I'm telling you,
you guys are fattening me up.

56
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,786
- Good?
- Excellent.

57
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,424
Always. Real good. Excellent.

58
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,330
Listen, Bobby...

59
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:48,736
Next week you come by, we talk.
We talk about plans for you.

60
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,138
We like what you do
at the club very much.

61
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,335
- Yeah? All right.
- Yeah.

62
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,146
- Good.
- Something more?

63
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,114
More? I just said I can't eat it.
I can't even eat this.

64
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,977
I can't have another bite.

65
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,249
What are you doing to me?

66
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,892
No, no, no, Amada's waiting.
I have to go.

67
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,253
You're too good to me.

68
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,658
Why do I deserve this?

69
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:15,301
- No, I gotta go.
- Where? Where you run off to?

70
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,172
It's my bike. Don't!

71
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,157
- Keep being brave, okay?
- Thank you.

72
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,355
Thank you.

73
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,168
- Here comes the right. Watch the right.
- Catch.

74
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,104
- Keep... Keep it up. Keep the guard...
- Careful.

75
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,301
- Sorry, babe. Keep...
- Joseph.

76
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,140
- All right, hey. Hey.
- Joseph.

77
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,441
- Hey, quit fooling around.
- Did he bag it?

78
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,278
No, he never did. His gun jammed,
so he started crying.

79
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,976
That's terrible. A nine-point?

80
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,622
- Joseph, come on.
- Pop's calling. Look...

81
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,985
...we'll go to Metropole,
cut loose a little.

82
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,490
- You got it.
- Come over here.

83
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,252
Gotcha.

84
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,088
Get your picture taken.
It's your big night.

85
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,325
- We took them already.
- The more, the better.

86
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,561
- Get your face out there.
- Stevie, come here.

87
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,001
The P.C. Will see this in the magazine,
all right?

88
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,835
- All right.
- Get used to it, it's good. Come on.

89
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,844
- Good.
- Thanks, chief.

90
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,404
Go over there to Mommy,
all right?

91
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,412
It's almost 11.
Where's your brother?

92
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,347
If he comes at all, he'll come late,
Pop. You know him.

93
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,449
Baby.

94
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,414
There's cops all around.

95
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,553
- They're all fucking drunk anyways.
- Give me some.

96
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,630
- I'm nervous.
- Don't be nervous. They're harmless.

97
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,963
Jumbo came through.
It's good, right?

98
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,130
Yeah, it's good. Okay.

99
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,210
You coming?

100
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,855
Do we have to? I don't know if I can
fucking deal with them tonight.

101
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:20,151
Come on, honey. It's your family.
You gotta support them.

102
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,055
Hey, remember
what I told you, right?

103
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,890
Nobody at the club knows about
my family. Not even Jumbo.

104
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,089
I know. Baby, I won't
say anything. Come on.

105
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,565
Last thing I need is anybody
thinking I'm a fucking cop.

106
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,267
- Never happen, baby.
- I could be a cop.

107
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,000
- What do you have to do?
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

108
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,203
Freeze. All right, spread them.
Spread them. Move!

109
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,041
- Get him! Get him!
- Arrest her.

110
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:46,116
- Where you going?
- Just kidding, officers.

111
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,049
He must know someone
because I'm talking about...

112
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,882
Shit. Oh, shit, look at this.

113
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,890
Bobby. Bobby Grusinsky.
Is that you?

114
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,790
It's me, Russ De Keifer
from across Union Turnpike.

115
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,191
- How you doing?
- All right.

116
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,299
- Still bartending at that Russian joint?
- I'm managing it now.

117
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,991
Hey, listen to you.

118
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,933
- Did he just call you "Grusinsky"?
- I'll talk to you later.

119
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,094
That guy's funny.

120
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,807
Oh, my God.

121
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,880
That's them.
In the corner down there.

122
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,354
Hey, Pop.

123
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,091
They don't look that bad,
though, for cops.

124
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,358
All right, let's go.

125
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,628
- He's got company.
- Give me a break.

126
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,030
- Here comes trouble.
- Look at you.

127
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,540
- You came.
- Congratulations, you're moving up.

128
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,679
Mr. Big Shot honors us
with his presence.

129
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,381
- At your service. You look great.
- Thanks.

130
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,380
Everybody,
this is my girlfriend, Amada.

131
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,314
- That's my father...
- Nice to meet you.

132
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,954
...Chief Burt Grusinsky.

133
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,919
- My brother, Joe.
- Hi.

134
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,580
That's Michael and Jack.

135
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,283
You guys look good.

136
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,760
- You put up with this guy?
- I'm a Leo. I can put up with anything.

137
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,632
If you got a minute,
we'd like to talk to you.

138
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,236
- Let's get a drink first.
- No, right now. Right now.

139
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,172
It's only gonna take a minute.

140
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,240
- Upstairs in the church.
- "Right now."

141
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,899
Come on.

142
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,272
Don't worry. We'll bring him back
in one piece.

143
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,181
That's a great crowd
you got down there, Joe.

144
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,190
- You know all the right people.
- That's a nice suit you got, Bobby.

145
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,052
Was that funny?

146
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,992
I didn't know you had a sense
of humor, Michael. I like it.

147
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,963
How much did that earring
set you back?

148
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,029
- What?
- You heard what I said.

149
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,570
Bobby, I asked Pop
to bring you up here.

150
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:52,207
- Bobby. Please, I'm serious.
- Why? What's the matter?

151
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,146
I'll be heading up this new
narcotics team starting this week.

152
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,909
Russian unit
out of PSA-One in Brighton.

153
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,043
What?

154
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,121
You brought me up here
to tell me that?

155
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,329
Do any of you fucking guys talk?

156
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,762
- You ever say anything back there?
- I'm old-fashioned. I listen first.

157
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,602
Oh, God. Excuse me.

158
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,829
We're looking at this guy,
Vadim Nezhinski.

159
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,770
Served time in the Soviet Union
for black-market activity...

160
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:28,903
...come over in 1979.
He's dealing H, cocaine, angel dust.

161
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,674
This guy's bringing in major weight
and we need to track it.

162
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,082
He's operating out of that spot
you manage, the El Caribe.

163
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,858
Oh, I don't know nothing
about that. I'm not...

164
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,722
No, we know. We checked
the rest of the management too...

165
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,456
...his uncle, the owner.
- The old man?

166
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,795
- Well, he is his uncle.
- You been fucking watching me too?

167
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:54,167
Everybody else came up clean.
It's just Nezhinski we're looking at.

168
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,905
You want me to inform?

169
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,569
No.

170
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,271
- Are you kidding me?
- Just observe, that's all.

171
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,316
It's a closed community.
You're our only way in right now.

172
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,055
Great. You guys are the fucking cops.
Why are you coming to me?

173
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,019
Why...? Why is this my problem?

174
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:17,127
The whole city's falling apart. Don't
you have any sense of responsibility?

175
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,325
Let me think.

176
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,626
No. No, not really. I don't.
I got enough fucking problems, Joe.

177
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,702
The streets are
in fucking chaos, Bobby.

178
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,703
- Our guys are dropping like flies.
- Joseph, come on. L...

179
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:32,071
Joseph, you go downstairs.
Let me talk to him, all right?

180
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:35,042
- Yeah, thanks for coming.
- It's always a pleasure. Thank you.

181
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,682
You better be careful out there
the next couple weeks.

182
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,477
- What's that mean?
- You know.

183
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,746
- Joseph.
- Fine, Pop. You fucking deal with him.

184
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,560
- Take care, Bobby.
- Yeah.

185
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,364
Move over. Move over.

186
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,527
Been a long time
since we've seen you.

187
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,206
Your brother says you don't
answer the phone anymore.

188
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,274
I've been busy, Pop.
That's all.

189
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,035
Yeah?

190
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,708
What's going on with you?

191
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,413
You can't talk?

192
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,451
I don't know.

193
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,486
You what?

194
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,248
Things are all right.

195
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,393
- You're all right?
- Yeah.

196
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,720
Yeah?

197
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:26,888
You know, I could've gotten you
a good job with us, a safe job.

198
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,460
If you would have asked.
If you'd been around.

199
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,803
I got a job. I got a job. A good job.

200
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,908
That's the whole point
of this conversation we had.

201
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:40,204
That's why your brother was here,
because of this club.

202
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,652
Your brother says that you've been
using your mother's name these days.

203
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,813
Yeah, just for the business.
You know, it's easy.

204
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,290
"Bobby Green"?

205
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,294
Well, people can pronounce it,
you know?

206
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,797
That Puerto Rican you brought.
She been hooking you up?

207
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,998
- What do you mean?
- Come on, I can smell it on you.

208
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,071
You keep laughing.

209
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,641
Your mother, rest in peace,
I think she was too easy on you.

210
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,541
All right.

211
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,344
I gotta go, Pop.

212
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,647
Bobby, let me tell you something.

213
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:28,282
Sooner or later,
either you're gonna be with us...

214
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,224
...or you're gonna be
with the drug dealers.

215
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,288
This is like a war out there.

216
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,761
Now, do you understand that?

217
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,464
Do you?

218
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,740
I'll see you.

219
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,175
Careful.

220
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,524
It's getting late. How are
the kids doing? They tired yet?

221
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,032
They're always tired. They worry
about you when you're out at night.

222
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,261
- Baby, sit up straight.
- Baby, do me a favor.

223
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,167
Don't start, all right?

224
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,267
Excuse me, everybody.
Can I have your attention, please?

225
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,840
Hi, my name is Deputy Commissioner
Spiro Giavannis...

226
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,507
...and we're here this holiday season
to honor one of our new leaders...

227
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,777
Let's get out of here...

228
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,887
...and go party with Jumbo.
- Why?

229
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,388
Baby, your family don't like me,
I don't care. I'm here for you, okay?

230
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,186
Fuck them. Let's go. It's boring.

231
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,022
- They're stiffs. Yeah.
- Really?

232
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,494
I'm sure the chief would like
to say a few words.

233
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,225
So I'd like to bring him
up here now. Chief?

234
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,605
Thank you. Thank you very much.

235
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,299
Yeah, chief.

236
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,913
You know, I used to tell my kids,
"Work first, play later."

237
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,243
And my son Joseph
really took that to heart.

238
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,612
Been a real fighter over the years.
He overcome the dyslexia...

239
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:06,815
...and eventually wound up
graduating John Jay as salutatorian.

240
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,716
And hey...

241
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:12,022
I'm very proud here tonight.

242
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:26,535
I wanna thank you all for coming.
Happy Thanksgiving.

243
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,142
Before I say anything else...

244
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:32,374
...one of our brothers was killed
in the line of duty last night.

245
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,946
Edward Conlon was gunned down...

246
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,452
...serving a warrant
on Northern Boulevard.

247
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,318
Hey. Come here.

248
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,085
The clock is about to strike 11.

249
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,225
I thought we might be able to give
a moment of silence to remember.

250
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,279
- Come on, get over here.
- Which one?

251
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,716
Come on, I'm meeting with Buzhayev
tonight. Which one? This one?

252
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,977
That one. Hey, baby.

253
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,882
- I got good news.
- Yeah?

254
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,183
So I talked to my mom yesterday.
She's feeling better.

255
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:49,327
So I can move in whenever I want.

256
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,023
Really?

257
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,226
- Don't joke with me.
- I'm not.

258
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,837
I like it. I like it.

259
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:03,572
It's official. You get your side
of the bed, I get mine.

260
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,541
Seriously, it's great news.

261
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:10,011
- Hey, I got you something.
- What?

262
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,208
You've been working so hard lately.

263
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,617
- What is it?
- Open it up.

264
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,986
- Now?
- Go ahead, open it.

265
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,536
It's nice.

266
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,002
I like it.

267
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,835
Thank you.

268
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,908
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, babe.

269
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,811
We'll have a lot of kids...

270
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,884
...big house.
- Yeah?

271
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,584
Can we get big kids
and a lot of houses?

272
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,018
Hey, Bobby! Get your ass out here.

273
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,630
It's probably Jumbo. Come on, let's
go hang out with them for a minute.

274
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,288
Everybody, the life of the party
is here.

275
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,229
Hey, Falsetti,
you get what we wanted?

276
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,200
Absolutely. I got a little of
what everybody asked for here.

277
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:10,307
I got uppers, I got downers.
Hash, mescaline, some blow.

278
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,501
The troops require sustenance.

279
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,712
Go, go, go!

280
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,782
You gotta get dressed.
You gotta get dressed.

281
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,819
Come on, get dressed.

282
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,525
You can't be late
for the boss, baby.

283
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:12,033
- Bobby!
- Well, hello, how are you?

284
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,838
I thought you could ride. Not riding
so good. You don't ride bareback?

285
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,737
How are you?

286
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,967
- Bobby.
- You wouldn't believe it.

287
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:25,048
It's 40 degrees out, line's halfway
around the block. It's unbelievable.

288
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,986
I'll grab something in a second,
thank you.

289
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,948
Take kids in the other room.

290
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,689
Don't worry, kids.

291
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:41,321
You will see Grandpa on Tuesday
to ride the horses.

292
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,466
Not on the furs!

293
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,162
- Bobby.
- Pop.

294
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,134
- Have a seat.
- Why? What'd I miss?

295
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,399
Listen, we're thinking
about expanding.

296
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,639
Maybe we'll open another spot
next year across from Brighton.

297
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,575
- I like it.
- Yeah, good.

298
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:59,547
And we think you'll run it
and we'll do it exactly like here.

299
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,282
- Could be good.
- Good?

300
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,921
Good, yeah. Listen...

301
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,490
...I've been thinking. If you wanna
open another spot, I mean...

302
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,856
...why not try Manhattan?
- Manhattan's very expensive.

303
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,223
Depends on where you go.

304
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,991
I mean, you get in there now,
get something for cheap.

305
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,397
I'm talking a big space,
a big warehouse.

306
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,127
You get different levels going.

307
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,465
We could do something different
on each floor.

308
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,403
Like one floor could be rock 'n' roll.

309
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,669
Then you do another floor,
you got disco. Something like that.

310
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,646
He's got so many ideas!

311
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:35,145
And don't let your hair-brained
nephew Vadim screw it up!

312
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,515
It's a lot of money, Papa.

313
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,420
Your fur business can
support that right now?

314
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,052
My son-in-law, he worries people
take advantage of me.

315
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,219
I understand that.

316
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,889
But I think we can do something
special and different.

317
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,228
Worst-case scenario,
it's a great investment.

318
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,769
I mean, I think it's worth looking into.

319
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,341
All right.

320
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,568
So bring some details.
We'll figure out the numbers.

321
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,444
- Yeah?
- Okay?

322
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,046
Good.

323
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,209
I love you.

324
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,859
Hey, who is this?

325
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:19,554
You are in the presence
of the future king of New York.

326
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,756
The future king?
What are you talking about?

327
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,458
Listen, nothing's definite
so don't say anything.

328
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,069
I was just with Mr. Buzhayev.

329
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,763
He's talking about opening
another spot in Manhattan.

330
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,400
He wants me to run it.
I want you, my brother, to be a host.

331
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,638
Of course! I'm a people person.
That's my specialty.

332
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,976
- I know.
- My fucking man.

333
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,982
I'm the "hoster" with the "moster."

334
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:44,020
That's beautiful news, Bob.
Beautiful.

335
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:47,448
Now you'll finally be getting me
all the women I deserve.

336
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,321
What's Amada doing
at Vadim's table?

337
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,596
She's doing what she's supposed
to do. She's charming the customers.

338
00:23:55,767 --> 00:24:00,397
- What do you hear about him, Jumbo?
- I don't know what I hear.

339
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,167
- I hear stories.
- You hear stories. Like what?

340
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:05,673
Stories.

341
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:10,107
Like last year, one of his guys
was gonna rat him out.

342
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,113
Cops found his head
on Brighton Avenue.

343
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:16,118
- Fucking dick was in his mouth.
- Sure it wasn't your dick?

344
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,589
Are you sure it wasn't your mouth?

345
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:26,886
But I tell you, he wouldn't be
running around here like a king...

346
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,659
...if his uncle didn't own the place,
that much I know.

347
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,029
I gotta get back to work.

348
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,933
All right. Nice talking to you. Bye.

349
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,173
I'm gonna go talk to Amada.

350
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:40,378
- All right, I'll see you later.
- I'll be downstairs.

351
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,754
I was just telling her how you
stuffed a pill up her nose.

352
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,654
Yeah, that's going
on the wall of shame.

353
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,125
See you later.

354
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,364
Hey, babe, listen.

355
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,228
I don't think you should be around
Vadim so much right now.

356
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,301
Why? You jealous?

357
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,462
No, I'm not jealous. Listen,
it's nothing for you to worry about.

358
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,629
Okay.

359
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,072
I wanna tell you about
my meeting with Buzhayev.

360
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,438
This is the police!

361
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,012
- This is a raid!
- Let's go.

362
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,839
- Police!
- Fuck.

363
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:22,243
Let's find this motherfucker right now.
Let's go.

364
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,821
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

365
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,323
Everybody get your hands
on your fucking heads.

366
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,053
- Let go of me, man.
- Get the fuck down!

367
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,933
Empty your pockets!
Oh, jackpot.

368
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:43,040
- Get on the bar. Hands on the bar.
- Who authorized this?

369
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,335
Tell me who authorized it.
I have the right...

370
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,705
What's the matter? You on
something? Come here.

371
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,645
That's right. Hands on your
fucking head and don't move!

372
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,148
- Hey, easy, easy.
- Toss them all, Pudge!

373
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,152
- Where is he?
- Get on... Get on the fucking ground!

374
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,552
Give him the charcoal.
Open your fucking mouth!

375
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,191
Who the fuck authorized this?

376
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,760
- I'm looking for Vadim Nezhinski.
- He must be on something.

377
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,424
Get the fucking charcoal.
You do a little dust?

378
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,261
- Bring him the fuck down here!
- Get this piece of shit up.

379
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,926
- Where is he?
- He's up here, captain! We got him.

380
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,265
How about some charcoal
to absorb the toxins?

381
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,533
Clear some space here
for me, ladies, please.

382
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,973
- Turn him, he's gonna puke.
- Where's Nezhinski?

383
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,944
- Get this piece of shit up.
- Here we go.

384
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,844
- Give me some space here, please.
- Get the fuck out here.

385
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,678
- Who else?
- Don't you move.

386
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,080
- Turn around.
- Here we go.

387
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,848
What are you looking at?
Turn your head the other way.

388
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,523
Turn around.

389
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,835
- What is this?
- Stay down, stay down.

390
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,128
Tough guy, huh?

391
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,273
What, you want me
to double your money?

392
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,468
- Stay down.
- There it is.

393
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,546
It's doubled. How's that?

394
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,710
What are you looking at?
Turn around.

395
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,320
What else you got in here, huh,
joker? What about the girls?

396
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,790
Come here.
You got anything in here?

397
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,399
You got a cross and a Jewish star
on you.

398
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,967
- What's the matter? You confused?
- Not me.

399
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,595
- What we got?
- This one's holding.

400
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,241
- Couple dimes of cocaine, some PCP.
- Good.

401
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,469
You and you are under arrest.
Possession and sale of narcotics.

402
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,046
Talk to them and
we go after your mother.

403
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,740
What the fuck
did you just say to him?

404
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,045
Nothing.

405
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:40,190
Your boy's gonna open up on you.
And when he does, I'm coming back.

406
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,885
All right. Let's go.

407
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,552
Come on!

408
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:50,566
Good night, everybody. Pleasure
doing business with you. Wrap it up.

409
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:52,895
Let's go.

410
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,769
- Mr. Buzhayev.
- Yes?

411
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,374
- I'm Captain Jack Shapiro.
- Nice to meet you.

412
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,135
This has nothing to do with you...

413
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,836
...but do you have a nephew
named Vadim Nezhinski?

414
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,608
- Yes.
- Does he have an office here?

415
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:08,753
Clean him up. I don't want to
get it all over the car.

416
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,683
You got him dirty, you clean him up.

417
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,715
- Does he have an office here?
- No.

418
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,416
Okay.

419
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,192
We'll be in touch.

420
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,297
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

421
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,798
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

422
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:29,303
- How the fuck did he get out here?
- Get out!

423
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:32,466
- What do you got?
- Possession and resisting arrest.

424
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,874
He's also got $207 on him.

425
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,173
- Two-oh-seven? Take him in the back.
- Let's go.

426
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,873
- Who frisked this asshole?
- Don't forget the pedigree.

427
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,383
- All right.
- We gotta stop the bleeding.

428
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,022
- What do you got?
- He's bleeding all over the place.

429
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,624
- Don't touch him!
- Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

430
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,885
- The Russian guy cut himself open.
- Jesus.

431
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,461
- Where'd he get the blade?
- He had it on him, man.

432
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,856
Hey, hey.
What the fuck is going on in here?

433
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,662
- He cut his throat.
- He pulled some cutting, man.

434
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:02,068
Put pressure on him, all right?
Put pressure.

435
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,904
Why are you standing there?
Get us a fucking bus.

436
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,067
All right, all right, all right.

437
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,609
Shit.

438
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,050
Good morning, chief.

439
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,254
You ready to go home?

440
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,365
Or do you have a home?

441
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,368
Your brother wanted me
to let you out.

442
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:37,167
If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here
another couple of days or a week.

443
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,640
- Maybe a month.
- Do you want me to thank him?

444
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,137
Disgusting.

445
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,949
You're uncontrollable. You know?

446
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,215
Give him a bath.

447
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,988
I ought to rap you one.

448
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:07,136
Hey, sign out with the desk sergeant
before you leave, please.

449
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,139
Guy cut his own throat.
Nezhinski must've...

450
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,677
...really put the fear of God in him.
- Look...

451
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,338
...that guy knew how they're
bringing the product in.

452
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:19,915
- Absolutely.
- That's the key.

453
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,746
We find the right guy,
we're gonna get him...

454
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,765
We waited till it was your day off.
We had to go. I'm sorry. That's it.

455
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,067
You had to hit that spot.
Of all the places...

456
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,507
...you gotta come to my place?
- That's where Nezhinski's been seen.

457
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,510
We supposed to
announce it in advance...

458
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,582
...and compromise the whole thing?
I told you I'm very sorry...

459
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,015
Sorry's not good enough. You don't
come in, act like you own the place.

460
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,087
Got your guys putting shit
down my throat!

461
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:01,589
You want me to come in here, fuck
everything up, push everything around?

462
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,852
You wouldn't be in this
if you didn't fuck around!

463
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,486
No, I wouldn't be in this shit
if you weren't trying to be top cop.

464
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:10,532
You know fucking Nezhinski's guy?
His fucking throat cut open.

465
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,465
Congratulations, Captain Joe.
Good job!

466
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,572
Think you're above it? You fuck
around with your Puerto Rican?

467
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,868
- Grow up and act like a man...
- Try thinking about my Puerto Rican...

468
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,568
...while trying to fuck your fat wife!
How's that?

469
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,006
- Knock it off! Bobby!
- Get off!

470
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,276
- Come on!
- Get off me!

471
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,282
Don't touch me! You're not Pop!

472
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,888
I'm done with you. I don't wanna
see your fucking face anymore.

473
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,993
Get out of here!

474
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,662
I'm going home.

475
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,498
It's a fucking holiday.

476
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,176
Winter, spring, summer, fall...

477
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:07,848
...call 966-7210 for reservations
at Pocono Gardens and...

478
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:11,689
Beautiful Mount Airy Lodge.

479
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,265
Shit.

480
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,464
Jab, combination.

481
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:55,334
Come on, dig. Dig. Come on.
Dig! Dig! Dig! Combination.

482
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:59,033
Combination. Jab. Jab. Jab.
Combination.

483
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,178
Dig. Dig. Dig. With authority.

484
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:04,679
Dig. Dig. Finish it up. With authority.

485
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,840
That's it. That's it.

486
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,384
Good. Take a rest. Take a rest.

487
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,889
- Chief.
- Yeah.

488
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,067
Which kid is it?

489
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,098
It's Joseph.
He's in Jamaica Hospital.

490
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:36,610
It don't look good right now.

491
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,881
Want us to contact
your other son, chief?

492
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:43,077
No, I'll do that. Thanks.

493
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,216
You okay, chief?

494
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,121
You guys go on.
I'll be right out. Thank you.

495
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,631
- Chief.
- Yo, chief. You all right?

496
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,602
I'm all right. I'm all right.

497
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:05,738
C-note.

498
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,247
Come on, man. Let's go.

499
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:19,149
All right, tell you what, Jose.

500
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,086
I'll see you...

501
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,522
...and I'll bump you two C's.

502
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,800
Call.

503
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,203
Hello.

504
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,714
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to
introduce you to Jose's new friends...

505
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:50,149
...Siegfried and Roy. Two queens.

506
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,949
- Hey, Bobby.
- How you like that, huh?

507
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,457
- Bobby!
- What? Hang up on them.

508
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:00,495
What you got?
Come on, you fold with that?

509
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,065
- That's what...
- It's the police.

510
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:06,260
All right, all right, deal again.
Deal again. I'm feeling hot!

511
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,462
Jose, I thought you knew
how to play poker.

512
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,971
I told him to keep going.
He was gonna pack it in.

513
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,269
Go fuck yourself
and just deal the cards.

514
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,139
- Hello.
- Bobby?

515
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,905
Yeah.

516
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,879
Bobby, it's Michael Solo.
I got some bad news.

517
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,713
It's your brother.
Your brother's been shot.

518
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,186
About an hour ago,
outside his house.

519
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:27,381
What? Who?

520
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:30,959
Can you hear me? Your brother's
been shot. He's at Jamaica Hospital.

521
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,756
They're working on him now.

522
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,160
What are you talking about?
I was just with him.

523
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,233
Listen, your father's coming.
I gotta go.

524
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:41,201
But he's at Jamaica.
I just thought you should know.

525
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,232
What happened?

526
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,041
- My brother was shot.
- Oh, my God.

527
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,685
They're operating on him...

528
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,015
They're operating on him right now.
I gotta...

529
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,748
Bobby.

530
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,894
- Where are my keys?
- They should be on your desk.

531
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,420
- I'll get my coat. I'll go with you.
- No. No.

532
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,657
Stay here tonight.
I'll call you later.

533
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,634
- Bobby, I wanna go with you.
- No. I'll call later.

534
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,633
Bobkes?

535
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:20,106
- Where you going?
- Deal the cards, man.

536
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:36,657
Pop, Joe gonna be all right?

537
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,129
He's all right?

538
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,932
You got into a fight with him,
I heard.

539
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:47,698
- No.
- Well, you got what you wanted...

540
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,067
...and you stayed out of it.

541
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,174
- Burt.
- Why would you say that?

542
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,278
- The union sent a shrink over for you.
- I don't need that crap.

543
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,409
- Your Honor.
- Chief.

544
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,643
- Chief, I'm sorry.
- What happened, Michael? Tell me.

545
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,650
- What's going on?
- I'm glad you're here.

546
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,755
First, I wanna tell you
how sorry I am.

547
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,689
We'll get them, Your Honor.
I'll come back in and run it myself.

548
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,192
The bullet went into his cheek,
came out his jaw.

549
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,228
- It missed his brain, thank God.
- Jesus.

550
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,922
He's very lucky, considering.

551
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,161
Do you know who did it?

552
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,668
No.

553
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,669
Definitely a professional.
They bombed his car.

554
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,643
It's a calling card.
We think it's the Russians.

555
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:32,679
You know, it's a real shame
we didn't get to Nezhinski before this.

556
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,681
Are you fucking blaming me?

557
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:39,989
No.

558
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,822
But I'm not the only one
around here with an opinion.

559
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,795
Best-case scenario...

560
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:55,234
...doctor says your brother will have to
be here for at least a couple months.

561
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,134
Anyway...

562
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,333
...let's just...
Let's just hope he pulls through.

563
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,479
I'm going to see him.

564
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,442
- Easy.
- Nobody's allowed in...

565
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,713
...except immediate family.
- I'm his brother.

566
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,288
I'm his fucking brother!

567
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,550
Officers, hold on!
Let him in. It's all right.

568
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,524
- His nametag says "Green."
- It's his brother.

569
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,425
Okay, boss.

570
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,689
I'm sorry, Joe.

571
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:36,126
This guy got two queens
and he bumps the guy $200?

572
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,100
And then he wins and where the fuck
do you run off to, like a Jew, huh?

573
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,102
The place went fucking bananas.

574
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,538
I gotta straighten things out. I had
to bust some heads like Bruce Lee.

575
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,700
I'm in there busting fucking heads.
They...

576
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:50,312
All right, Jumbo?
Jumbo, do me a favor.

577
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,177
Would you grab the check?
Let's get out of here. I'm tired.

578
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,046
All right, fine. I'll go pay the check.

579
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,986
But, Bob, just don't forget that nobody
could ever do for you what I did.

580
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,421
Busting heads.

581
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,585
Hey, don't say nothing to Jumbo
about what happened, all right?

582
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,994
Of course. I just thought he could
cheer you up a little, that's all.

583
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,031
- Thanks.
- Look who's here.

584
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,561
- Hi, Vadim.
- Hey.

585
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,763
We were just about to leave.

586
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,667
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

587
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,074
Made it through the bust okay?

588
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:26,978
- I'm here.
- Good. Good. Glad to hear it.

589
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,647
Your uncle's got some
trouble now, though.

590
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,880
You fucked up the club.

591
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,392
He does what he's gotta do,
I do what I got to do.

592
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,323
He don't own me.

593
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,363
He's got grandkids to worry about,
chasing them around.

594
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:52,408
Hey, baby, go keep Jumbo company
for a sec, all right?

595
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,673
Nice girl you got there.

596
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,406
One is prettier than the other.
He knows everybody.

597
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,015
He's pretty popular.

598
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:05,312
You must know a whole network
of people. Clubs, everything, huh?

599
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,049
Listen...

600
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,559
...I got some shit coming in.

601
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,988
And some of us think maybe
you could help us get it out there.

602
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,764
My product needs a reputation.

603
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:20,130
A little dangerous right now,
don't you think?

604
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,539
We got a lot of muscle behind this.

605
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,603
- Muscle?
- Yeah, that's right.

606
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,511
You know a cop got hit today?

607
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,475
Do you think
that was a coincidence?

608
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,955
Well, they're not gonna
sit still for that, you know?

609
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,123
Police are a fucking joke, dude.

610
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,720
Mickey Mouse ain't gonna
do nothing.

611
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,898
Cop got lucky. He zigged
when he should have zagged.

612
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,830
You sit with them.

613
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,033
Bobby.

614
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,708
The cops...

615
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,575
...they ain't no problem.

616
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,239
So don't worry about it.
We'll get them all.

617
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:11,320
You cut the head off, the body will fall.
Am I right?

618
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,051
We do it until they get the message.

619
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,086
We just heard that cop's father
is going to be in charge now.

620
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,094
We'll get him too.

621
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:26,594
We got all their names on a list.

622
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,566
The chief of police will be next.

623
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:35,305
If you change your mind, call Pavel.

624
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,777
I got a great product.

625
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,416
Why don't you come down
and check it out for yourself?

626
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:42,108
All right.

627
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,189
Well, you're wrong, chief.

628
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,331
We gotta make a move.
We gotta make it now.

629
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:57,626
- No! We don't go nuts.
- You heard what Bobby just said.

630
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,167
Nezhinski's got a contract
out on us, Burt.

631
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:03,397
I know that. You wanna
take over my department?

632
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,337
You wanna run it?
What do you wanna do?

633
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:07,670
- I want an answer from you.
- Answer for what?

634
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:12,043
I have no answers now.
We're looking for him, all right?

635
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:16,410
Use your head. If we go arrest them,
they'd be back on the street in a day.

636
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,748
We gotta catch them
with their hands full...

637
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:21,982
...find out where they got the real
weight, then we make the move.

638
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,094
- We don't have that much time.
- Doesn't matter. It's the right play.

639
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:26,593
- I say we hit them all.
- What?

640
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,858
- Wipe them out. No survivors.
- Don't be a first-class schmuck.

641
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:33,299
- We don't have the time to infiltrate.
- That is exactly my point.

642
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,028
Then we make the time.

643
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,435
- At whose expense?
- Hold on!

644
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,974
I want you all
to understand something, all right?

645
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:43,272
We don't ever play in the dirt here.
Not ever, no matter what.

646
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:47,339
When you piss in your pants,
you can only stay warm for so long.

647
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:51,882
Bobby.

648
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:54,957
Is there anything else you know
or anything you can tell us?

649
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,289
Nezhinski come in and...

650
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,825
...he was saying they're trying
to create a brand name, that they...

651
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,991
...wanna corner the market.

652
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,328
Why did he tell you this?

653
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:12,197
I don't know. He thought
I could help him build a reputation.

654
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,206
Nice friends you got there.

655
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,370
Know what, Pop? He's not my friend.
All right? He came at me.

656
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,905
All right.

657
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,381
I'm not interested in that.
I don't deal.

658
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,019
But didn't you lead him on?

659
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,212
No, I didn't fucking lead him on.

660
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:29,155
The guy's crazy. He told me
I could come look at his operation.

661
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,794
- I didn't even ask.
- He talked about his operation?

662
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,594
Maybe that's it. Maybe that's key.

663
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,665
What's your point?

664
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,428
We put a Kel on him.
Then send one of our uncles in.

665
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,935
Wait a minute. Wait.
Who's gonna be the tail?

666
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:46,436
No, forget about it. No way.
No. Forget it. Forget it!

667
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,272
You go to his spot, right?
And you let him talk.

668
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,277
You let him hang himself.

669
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:54,008
And then we trail you,
you know, to the location.

670
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,845
A week later, we pop him.

671
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,249
And your name's cleared.
Nobody knows it's you.

672
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,118
Mike, it's too dangerous for him.
He's my son.

673
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:04,556
- He's connected to all of us.
- No one knows I'm connected to you.

674
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:08,061
- What?
- I don't talk about you.

675
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,492
What about your girlfriend?
She knows about you, right?

676
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:16,770
Yeah.

677
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:21,333
All right, leave me alone
a minute. Okay?

678
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:27,711
I gotta fill out these line-of-duty reports
for your brother, for Joseph.

679
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,025
I didn't know this
was gonna happen, Pop.

680
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,925
Yeah, well...

681
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,329
...what can you do, right?

682
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,138
I don't want you to get hurt.

683
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:52,331
Don't worry about me.
Just worry about yourself.

684
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:55,740
I hear anything about your brother,
I'll call you. Goodbye.

685
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,910
Goodbye.

686
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:36,843
Hey, baby.

687
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,988
Hey, babe.

688
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:44,049
How's your father?
Is he holding up okay?

689
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:47,254
- Yeah.
- Good.

690
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:50,730
I heard on the television
your brother's doing better.

691
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:56,095
Me and my mom,
we said a prayer for him.

692
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,372
Thanks, baby.

693
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,972
Did they find out who did it?

694
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,413
Baby?

695
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,426
It was Vadim.

696
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,523
Vadim shot Joseph.

697
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,029
Oh, my God.

698
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,430
Oh, my God.

699
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,935
They tried to tell me...

700
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:32,803
...but I didn't listen.
- Oh, my God.

701
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:36,503
Bobby, what are we gonna do?

702
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:08,978
Michael.

703
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:15,515
Hey.

704
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,688
You been up to see Joe?

705
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:25,260
Yeah. He's doing much better.
They reset his jaw this morning.

706
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:30,560
He was awake when I left him.
Your old man's up there with him now.

707
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,629
How you doing?

708
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:38,564
You can't protect my father.

709
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:41,540
We'll do the best we can.

710
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,510
Those guys aren't afraid
of the police.

711
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:48,176
If anything should happen to him...

712
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:54,490
Listen, that thing
you were talking about...

713
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:59,027
...if I wanted to help you,
what would I have to do?

714
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:05,562
I'll call you.

715
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:15,207
There's a wire in here.
We hear everything that goes down.

716
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:19,076
We'd also have a tail on you,
so we'd be with you at all times.

717
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,685
Small. Light as a feather.

718
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,319
You're fucking kidding me. That's it?

719
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:30,722
That's it. That's the risk.
You just gotta find that stash house.

720
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:33,260
- This can't get out.
- It won't.

721
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:40,067
Well, what if
something goes wrong?

722
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:45,072
Give me a word.
First word comes to your mind.

723
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,608
- Feather.
- Okay.

724
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,443
Anytime we hear the word "feather,"
we come in early.

725
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:57,144
Otherwise, stay there, do what you
gotta do and get the fuck out.

726
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,915
- This will all be kept confidential.
- Yeah, it better.

727
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:06,090
You get burnt, we have to
put you into protection.

728
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,629
That's better than ending up dead.

729
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,626
- Fuck.
- Listen...

730
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:15,431
...nobody will ever know
you're involved.

731
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:19,564
Not your father, not your girlfriend,
nobody.

732
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,008
And maybe someday your brother
will thank you for all this.

733
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,909
So, Bobby...

734
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:28,349
...you call Vadim's people
and set it up.

735
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:32,511
You won't see us, but we'll be
following your every move.

736
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:36,022
Don't be a hero.
Don't make conversation.

737
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:40,191
You sense they're onto you,
just remember the word is "feather."

738
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,625
Your life is in that lighter.

739
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:44,758
Good luck.

740
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:06,213
Bobkes. Jesus.

741
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,186
Where you been?
I left you a message.

742
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:10,519
- Yeah, I got it. Thanks.
- You all right?

743
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,321
- Yeah.
- What's the matter? You sick?

744
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:14,361
Yeah, I've been out of it.
I gotta...

745
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:15,691
Come on, Amada's here.

746
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,729
- Two Jack Daniels, please.
- No, no, no.

747
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:21,359
I gotta take care of something.
I'll call you tomorrow.

748
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:23,768
All right. Call me tomorrow.

749
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,184
Please.

750
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,685
See my friends out there?

751
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:50,564
Vadim is really glad
that you made up your mind.

752
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,126
He's very happy.

753
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,630
You ready?

754
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:01,842
Yeah.

755
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,748
You'll meet me at the boardwalk
in one hour.

756
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,612
For your protection, and for ours...

757
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:12,016
...you'll be searched and blindfolded
as we arrive.

758
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,555
You'll be able
to sample the product...

759
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:17,716
...see if you like it. I'm sure you will.

760
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:20,692
You will discuss the rest
of the details with Vadim.

761
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,355
Don't raise your voice,
he doesn't like it.

762
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,800
And for me...

763
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:31,870
...l'm taking you to the place
where I never took anybody before...

764
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,533
...especially no Americans.

765
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,413
And I don't trust you
the way Vadim does.

766
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:42,510
So don't.

767
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,478
All right?

768
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:49,381
And if you want to see
your girlfriend ever again...

769
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,992
...you will come alone.

770
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:57,058
Boardwalk. One hour.

771
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:59,120
You don't mind
that I sit behind, do you?

772
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,955
Do what you gotta do.

773
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:08,796
Let me see your hands.

774
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:16,932
Take this. Put it on.

775
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,527
What do you think?

776
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:01,630
Good.

777
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:05,337
What do you got there?
How many keys?

778
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,772
What, like three to four months?

779
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:09,912
It's not gonna dry up on us, is it?

780
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,877
We got a whole lot of stuff
coming in...

781
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,411
...in a way nobody could ever trace.

782
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:28,022
All the shit I got in here,
at least 86 percent pure.

783
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,687
Sasha.

784
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,912
The whole city will be
sucking our glass soon.

785
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,681
We'll push the guineas out.
The Domos will work for us.

786
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:54,591
It's good.

787
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,319
It's good.

788
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:00,553
So where's this coming from?

789
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,271
You're breathing heavy.

790
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:20,645
Yeah, because I just took a hit.

791
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:31,124
You know, I seen fighters
breathe like that.

792
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,421
It means they get nervous.

793
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:36,529
- Are you nervous?
- No.

794
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:40,002
I told you,
it's because I took some shit.

795
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:42,228
What do I have
to be nervous about?

796
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,703
They already searched me.

797
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,913
I'm not here to fuck you.
What are you doing?

798
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:20,371
How come you got both
matches and a lighter?

799
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:26,140
I'm feeling light as a feather
from that shit.

800
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,622
- What?
- Feeling light as a feather...

801
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:35,754
...from that stuff.

802
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:48,229
- He's wired.
- No, wait.

803
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,499
You were right.
Kill the motherfucker.

804
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:53,938
Wait. Wait! Wait!

805
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,891
Get up! Get over there!

806
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:16,658
Take the roof. Bobby!

807
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:25,065
Get the weapon!

808
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:30,478
Go, go!

809
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:47,118
- Police! Don't move!
- I'm with you! I'm with you!

810
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:49,495
Don't move!

811
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:02,101
Police! Don't move!

812
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:05,736
Put your hands up! Put your
hands up! Put your hands up!

813
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:07,644
Back up to my voice!

814
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:13,920
- Who is he? Is he one of us?
- He's still breathing.

815
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:15,990
Get him a stretcher, quick.

816
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:19,060
Copy that, Rescue 238.
Patient is a Caucasian male...

817
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:22,163
...mid-30s, with a leg fracture,
broken ribs, abrasions...

818
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,026
...and a possible neck injury.
