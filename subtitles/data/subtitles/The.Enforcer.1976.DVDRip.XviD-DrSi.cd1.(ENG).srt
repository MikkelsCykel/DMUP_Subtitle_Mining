1
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,268
Where you headed, little lady?

2
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,518
Nowhere with you, numb nuts.
Buzz off!

3
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,655
See you Thursday, gorgeous!

4
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,371
It's a pretty day to hitchhike.

5
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:52,677
I've got a little VW
at Stinson Beach with a cracked block.

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,930
You wouldn't be going
to Mill Valley, would you?

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,593
Aren't we going to Mill Valley?

8
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:05,064
Got a couple bottles of
ice-cold beer up there.

9
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,985
You son of a bitch.

10
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,906
Okay, pile in!

11
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,971
How long you been with
Western Gas and Electric?

12
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,600
I can't remember how long.
How long I been in this?

13
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,814
Turn in here.

14
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,912
Climb up this road here.

15
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,555
I'll be right with you.

16
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,271
Hang a left here, Harry,
there's a jam on Bay.

17
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,293
What's with the citizen?

18
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:47,314
-Police officer, what's the problem?
-Thank God! He's inside!

19
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,283
Come on, it's a heart attack!

20
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,196
Wait here.

21
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,864
Make some room! Move aside!

22
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,450
Move aside.
This is an emergency!

23
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,456
Please move over!

24
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,836
Please give us room.
He's a police officer.

25
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,261
-Where's the ambulance?
-He had a heart attack.

26
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,637
He's still breathing, though.

27
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,929
Come on, get up.

28
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,891
Get up!
Get up, get up!

29
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,486
I say!

30
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,117
-Party's over.
-Thanks a lot, Harry.

31
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:40,033
Why are you squawking?
You got the free meal.

32
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,543
But I always enjoy
the ride in the ambulance.

33
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,997
Get out of here.

34
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,300
Harry, it's an all-units.

35
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,806
Marvelous.

36
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,387
My old lady will kill me.

37
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:04,521
She's doing a novena tonight
and I said I'd be home for supper.

38
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,230
Suspects are armed.

39
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,734
Code 33.

40
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,695
Inspector 71 responding to your 406.

41
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,500
What's going on?

42
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,514
Bastards held up that liquor store.

43
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,181
One of our guys stumbled in
and they shot him.

44
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,978
They have four hostages.

45
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,812
They'll shoot them
unless we give them a car.

46
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,311
What're you waiting on?

47
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,359
Lieutenant Brannigan.

48
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,983
He said to stall until he gets here.

49
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:57,658
-Don't let them kill me!
-We want the goddamn car right now!

50
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,792
Okay, but you get nothing
till I come and talk.

51
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,629
Lay your piece on that car's hood!

52
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,422
What about me? I'm your partner.

53
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:22,515
I move fast. I don't need
extra linguini holding me back.

54
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,929
You got a lot of class, Harry.

55
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,470
You get cute, I blow this nice lady
all over you. Let's go.

56
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,769
On the floor, motherfucker.

57
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,691
For God's sake, do like he says!

58
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,855
-This is my best jacket.
-Get on the floor, you son of a bitch!

59
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,320
Spreadeagle! Move it!

60
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,157
Get down there.

61
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,655
San Francisco's finest.

62
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,335
Mitch.

63
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,543
Roll him over.

64
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,387
He's clean.

65
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,723
Here's the story.

66
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,102
First, we want all the pigs
out of here.

67
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,643
Second, we want a car...

68
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:57,239
...with a police radio.
Deliver it right out there in front.

69
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,482
We're taking two hostages.

70
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,327
Both the women.

71
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,200
You don't do what I tell you,
we blow their fucking heads off.

72
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,411
-You got the picture?
-Yeah.

73
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,628
What are you waiting for?

74
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,552
Run, you jive-ass bastard.

75
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,775
-What do they want?
-They want a car.

76
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,319
What are you going to do?

77
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,948
Give them one.

78
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,549
You son of a bitch!

79
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,588
Why's a man crazy enough
to join the cops?

80
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,462
If you find out, you let me know.

81
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,977
$14,379.

82
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,147
-How's that?
-Want an itemized account?

83
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:04,272
You took out two doors,
one window, 12 feet of counter...

84
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:09,076
...plus damages to the stock.
Plus one city vehicle totaled.

85
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:14,039
And three hostages in the hospital
who will probably sue the city.

86
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,416
-Why?
-Excessive use of force.

87
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,414
For your information, Callahan...

88
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:22,291
...the minority community
hates this kind of police work.

89
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,338
By "minority community"
you mean the hoods?

90
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,383
So happens they're
American citizens too.

91
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,591
-The lady with the gun by her ear?
-I'm not debating this.

92
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,392
I've spoken to the mayor twice!

93
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,973
He went through the ceiling!

94
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,942
You mention the meeting?

95
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,946
-What?
-The meeting two months ago...

96
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,281
...when you said priority was
to run the hoods out.

97
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,732
Not with violence!

98
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,200
Should I yell "trick-or-treat"?

99
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,485
Come on.

100
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,452
I expect you
and everyone on this force...

101
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,077
...to be restrained
or turn in his resignation.

102
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,414
You're on notice, Harry.

103
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,089
That wild west show of yours
is exactly what...

104
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,214
...this department's
not going to tolerate!

105
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,013
Is that clear?

106
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,464
Yes, sir.

107
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,519
-lf that's all, I've work to do.
-Not in homicide.

108
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,395
What?

109
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,901
You're transferred to personnel.

110
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,574
To personnel? That's for assholes.

111
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,492
I was in personnel for ten years.

112
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,454
Yeah.

113
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,701
That's it!

114
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,830
Report tomorrow to the oral
examining board, 9:00!

115
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,635
No, you haven't got the picture.

116
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,427
I'm the robber, you're the cop.

117
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,139
Now, I'm in a market.

118
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,433
You've just caught me.
A 211 in the act.

119
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,649
I'm coming out with a hostage:

120
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:08,529
A kid with a gun at his head.
There's no way to take me alive.

121
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,238
You have ten seconds to decide.

122
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,691
What do you do?

123
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,902
One...

124
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,120
-... two, three...
-You're under arrest.

125
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,745
-... four, five...
-Do something!

126
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,376
...six, seven.

127
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,201
Don't just stand there,
goddamn it, do something!

128
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,124
Bang, you're dead.

129
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,750
-You're late, Callahan.
-Sorry.

130
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,671
-Hello, Krause.
-Hi.

131
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,554
Okay, Bustanoby,
you'll be given your grade.

132
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,845
You were told 9:00.

133
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,475
We have 50 officers to test.

134
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,098
-For how many vacancies?
-Eight.

135
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,606
Five men and three women
promoted to inspector in this group.

136
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,532
-Three women?
-Do you object, inspector?

137
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,950
Now who might you be?

138
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,694
Ms. Grey, from the mayor's staff.

139
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,865
She's to monitor the exams.

140
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:03,039
-This is Inspector Callahan.
-Yes, I know something of him.

141
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,711
And I'd like to tell you...

142
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:09,962
...the mayor's plan is to bring
this department into...

143
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,670
...the mainstream of
twentieth-century thought.

144
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,391
How does he figure to do that?

145
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,438
For one thing...

146
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:24,433
...His Honor intends to...

147
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:28,641
...broaden participation
for women in the police force.

148
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,272
Well, that sounds very stylish.

149
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,778
He also said something about...

150
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:39,619
...winnowing the Neanderthals
out of the department.

151
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,754
Well, we better move along.
Next applicant.

152
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,466
-Officer Moore?
-Yes, sir.

153
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,556
This is the final stage
in the examination.

154
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:01,433
It's an informal test to measure
your ability to think on your feet.

155
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,178
Your reaction to stress, pressure.

156
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:08,526
Your ability to use the law
in a hypothetical situation.

157
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,528
Yes, sir.

158
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,856
How long on the force?

159
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,942
-Nine years.
-What department?

160
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,992
Mainly Personnel and Records.

161
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:21,326
-Personnel and Records.
-Yes, sir.

162
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,840
Have you any questions
for the applicant?

163
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,720
Questions...
How fast do you run the hundred?

164
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,307
Come on, you know
how this board functions.

165
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,938
All right, I'm sorry.

166
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:51,650
You know...

167
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:56,195
...if you're inspector under
the new guidelines...

168
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,908
...you might be out
riding in a police car.

169
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,404
Yes, sir, that's what I hope for.

170
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,871
Officer Moore, tell us about...

171
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,450
...your greatest felony arrest.

172
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,377
I've never made a felony arrest.

173
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,710
Well, tell us about
your best misdemeanor arrest.

174
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,842
I've never made a
misdemeanor arrest either.

175
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,722
What gives you the right
to be an inspector...

176
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,552
...when men have been
working 15 years!

177
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:30,934
Women stay home,
is that what you're saying?

178
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,108
You think it's an encounter group?

179
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,398
What will she do
if someone points a gun...

180
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,985
...and says, "Hit the deck"?!

181
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:41,408
You're trying to fail
this candidate, aren't you?

182
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,579
If she fails there,
she gets her ass blown off!

183
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,533
It's my ass!

184
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,416
And my hard luck.

185
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:55,671
Out there you'll have a partner.
You get blown away, he does too!

186
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,176
That's some price to pay
for being stylish!

187
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,009
Are you finished with the questioning?

188
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,142
Hypothetical situation, huh?

189
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:20,198
I'm standing on a corner
and Mrs. Grey propositions me...

190
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,653
...saying for $5.00
she'll put on a show...

191
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,779
-... with a Shetland pony.
-lf this is your idea of humor...

192
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:33,667
All right, what are you doing here?

193
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:37,749
Seeing if you know
what law's being broken...

194
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:40,168
...besides cruelty to animals.

195
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,056
That's a conspiracy,
title 7-182-1...

196
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:45,844
...of the California penal code.

197
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,140
Conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor...

198
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:52,143
-... is a felony, and according to...
-Yes. Good answer.

199
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,850
Officer Moore,
you'll be given your grade.

200
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,290
After I get the guard's keys...

201
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,672
...we drive to the end,
warehouse 50-A. Lalo?

202
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,341
All right, now, that's...

203
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,515
...l drop you off at the small door
and go around...

204
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:35,140
...to the wharf side.
You open up the first big door.

205
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,184
I drive in and back up to
the compound on the right.

206
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,525
Karl and Tex?

207
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,698
Man, we grab
the M-16 automatic rifles.

208
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,030
Wanda?

209
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:48,408
Locate and take any explosives.

210
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,416
Dynamite, detonators, and plastics.

211
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,369
Right. Henry Lee?

212
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,624
I tote and load the ammo
for the M-16s, okay, man?

213
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,870
Miki?

214
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,548
Locate the L.A.W. rockets.
They'll be in the back.

215
00:21:02,802 --> 00:21:06,551
It's the most important item.
You sure of the location?

216
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:08,966
I sweated there for five years!

217
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,135
They're there, I promise!

218
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,269
All right, you guys.

219
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:16,558
-This is for the people!
-Right on, for the people.

220
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,978
Jesus, spare me.

221
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:57,814
-What is it?
-Gas company.

222
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,474
-Why?
-Major gas leak in the area.

223
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:02,728
We'll check underground pipes.

224
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,657
Don't smoke until we say it's okay!

225
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,615
I won't, I won't.

226
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:20,955
It's seeping down in the earth.
This whole damn block could go!

227
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,085
-Got a phone I can use?
-Right this way.

228
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,931
Let's go.

229
00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:03,308
Charlie left the gate open.

230
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:05,015
Better check it.

231
00:24:33,596 --> 00:24:35,256
Tony, call backup.

232
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,260
-I'll check around.
-Frank, watch yourself.

233
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,948
L.A.W.S. rocket.

234
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,664
-Beautiful!
-Yes.

235
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:07,622
Lalo, get the rest of these loaded.

236
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,968
You'll blow us out of here!
You all right?

237
00:25:19,892 --> 00:25:21,932
Let us get these.

238
00:25:26,232 --> 00:25:27,857
Freeze.

239
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:48,501
Hold it right there!
Put those boxes down.

240
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,509
You back there.
Stand up so I can see you.

241
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,041
And drop that gun!

242
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:59,891
Put your hands over your head
and freeze!

243
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,890
-Now, wait a second.
-You shut up and listen.

244
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,563
You blink an eyelid
and I'll mail you home in a box!

245
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:15,778
All of you, against the fence!

246
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,949
Now!

247
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,951
You too, honey!

248
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,462
Oh, Jesus! Miki! Miki!

249
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:36,251
Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus.

250
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,299
Baby, I'll get you out.
I'll get you home.

251
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:43,217
Bobby, help get her up.

252
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,263
-You'll get us caught.
-No, we'll make it.

253
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,679
-She's dead.
-She's not dead!

254
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,600
The hell she isn't!

255
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,236
Come on, it's over.

256
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,105
Bobby.

257
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,590
Get it on there.

258
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,348
Lalo, get up in there! Come on!

259
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:48,243
Halt, police! Halt, or I'll fire!

260
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:52,536
I'll get this son of a bitch!

261
00:27:53,212 --> 00:27:54,291
Goddamn it!

262
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,516
He said it looked like
a regular company truck.

263
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,099
I'm asking the
Marin County sheriff.

264
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:15,139
Might tie in with the two bodies
found there last week.

265
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:19,727
Yes, sir.

266
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:21,942
How's DiGeorgio?

267
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:24,198
Well, Irene's with him now.

268
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:27,115
Is that some kind of answer?

269
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:30,154
He's been given the last rites.

270
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:32,373
-Get what you can.
-l will.

271
00:28:32,626 --> 00:28:34,418
Listen, I'm sorry.

272
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:41,628
Hello, Harry.

273
00:28:42,136 --> 00:28:43,844
He's been asking for you.

274
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:45,466
How is he?

275
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:47,633
He's in and out.

276
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:56,224
I'll smoke a cigarette.

277
00:28:58,944 --> 00:29:00,736
It's a war, isn't it?

278
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:05,158
I guess I never really
understood that.

279
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:18,750
Harry.

280
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,461
Frank, what happened?

281
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,011
I had them, dead bang. And then I...

282
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,217
Sorry.

283
00:29:38,692 --> 00:29:39,973
Frank?

284
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,816
Something you want to tell him?

285
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:47,528
Harry, listen, the punk who cut me...

286
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,821
-... I seen him before.
-Where?

287
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,823
I just can't make the name.

288
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:58,332
Where do you know him from, Frank?

289
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:00,456
That homicide...

290
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,418
...young hooker...

291
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,383
...in the Fillmore area.

292
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:06,593
The summer of '71.

293
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:11,765
-What about it?
-He was one of the pimps questioned.

294
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,594
Liked him for it, Harry.

295
00:30:16,063 --> 00:30:17,806
We liked him real good.

296
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:21,934
We liked everybody
north of Market on that one.

297
00:30:22,194 --> 00:30:27,070
He had one of them cute,
little-boy names...

298
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,325
...Charlie something, or Bobby.

299
00:30:32,204 --> 00:30:35,289
I'll check Records.
They'll have your notes.

300
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,411
Ten-to-one they blow it.

301
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,961
Not this time, Frank.

302
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,628
Maybe you better get some rest.

303
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:53,551
-Do you have to go just yet?
-Not if you don't want me to.

304
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,559
Thanks, Harry.

305
00:31:03,777 --> 00:31:05,188
Get Irene.

306
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,744
-Talk to Records?
-Not yet. That was McKay.

307
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:21,959
We got a tape from the bastards.
I'll see you in 30 minutes.

308
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:27,840
Code Blue, Intensive Care.

309
00:31:30,095 --> 00:31:31,424
30 minutes.

310
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,046
One million dollars
or we blow things up.

311
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:39,556
People's Revolutionary Strike Force.
Remember Fessenheim.

312
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:41,803
"Fessenheim"?

313
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,638
It's being checked.

314
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:47,186
People's Revolutionary Strike Force.
They on your list?

315
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:51,574
Nothing.

316
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:54,281
-Think it's legit?
-Probably not.

317
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,696
Lieutenant Bressler in Homicide.

318
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:02,784
What are you doing
about those records?

319
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,747
What do you mean?

320
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:07,543
I just talked to you about them!

321
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,545
Homicide! Fillmore District!
Inspectors Callahan and DiGeorgio.

322
00:32:15,182 --> 00:32:17,720
What do you mean, "written request"?

323
00:32:17,976 --> 00:32:19,969
Well, who's got the keys?

324
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:23,189
I'm coming down there
in five minutes...

325
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,936
...you get those files open,
you pencil-pushing son of a bitch!

326
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:34,405
-You don't have to make threats.
-I'm gonna nail the guy...

327
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,329
...who carved DiGeorgio
on my own time!

328
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:38,824
That's unnecessary...

329
00:32:39,081 --> 00:32:42,580
...you're back in Homicide
since 9, didn't you know?

330
00:32:44,044 --> 00:32:47,330
I've been down in Records
looking up a homicide.

331
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:48,621
Any luck?

332
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:52,002
Well, I've got eleven names
of known pimps.

333
00:32:52,928 --> 00:32:56,926
-l think our man's one of them.
-Judson, Maddox, Skidmore.

334
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:00,214
Shall I tell you my instinct on this?

335
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:03,395
-Black Militants.
-No, it's all hookers.

336
00:33:03,647 --> 00:33:06,220
The girl shot in the warehouse?
Miki Waleska.

337
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:07,977
A known prostitute.

338
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:11,983
What we've got is a
well-organized group of militants...

339
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:15,857
...with enough explosives to blow
San Francisco away...

340
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:19,238
-... including L.A.W.S. rockets.
-L.A.W.S. rockets?

341
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:22,082
The Army's giving a demonstration
at the firing range...

342
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:24,124
...in exactly 35 minutes.

343
00:33:24,376 --> 00:33:26,867
I'd like everybody
on the case there...

344
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:29,121
...to see what you're against.

345
00:33:29,381 --> 00:33:32,964
I've already been checked out
on the L.A.W.S. rocket.

346
00:33:33,218 --> 00:33:34,594
Your partner hasn't.

347
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,175
My partner?

348
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,473
Shit!

349
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,975
You know Inspector Moore?

350
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,522
Inspector.

351
00:33:53,071 --> 00:33:55,562
I'll see you at the firing range.

352
00:33:56,658 --> 00:33:58,567
Inspector?

353
00:34:02,748 --> 00:34:07,160
Inspector, I know you aren't
overjoyed by this assignment.

354
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:10,622
-You don't think I'm up to it, do you?
-Right.

355
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:12,627
All right...

356
00:34:12,883 --> 00:34:16,133
...let's get one thing straight.
I'm a woman.

357
00:34:16,386 --> 00:34:18,960
I consider that fact irrelevant...

358
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:23,054
...because I don't expect
any special consideration.

359
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,638
Marvelous.

360
00:34:25,562 --> 00:34:28,480
The L.A.W.S. rocket: for all purposes...

361
00:34:28,774 --> 00:34:31,609
...a one-shot disposable bazooka.

362
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:35,859
A fiberglass tube, 45 inches long...

363
00:34:36,114 --> 00:34:39,068
...which fires a single projectile...

364
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:43,703
...designed to penetrate armor
three-quarters of an inch thick.

365
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:48,000
If you've all seen it,
I'll demonstrate how it works.

366
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:51,628
To fire the rocket, pull this pin...

367
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,837
...dropping the cover...

368
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:56,049
...then pull.

369
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,294
Front and rear sights spring up.

370
00:34:58,512 --> 00:35:00,919
Got word from Pathology.

371
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:05,594
At noon they're posting the guard
that was killed. Check on it.

372
00:35:05,811 --> 00:35:06,890
I'll be there.

373
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:09,063
-Captain?
-Go ahead.

374
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:13,272
Keep your eyes on that truck...

375
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:16,646
...l'll show how effective
this weapon can be.

376
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,504
Coming, inspector?

377
00:36:12,294 --> 00:36:13,836
-lnspector?
-Yeah?

378
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:16,578
-13.5 in my gym shorts.
-What?

379
00:36:16,882 --> 00:36:20,048
My time in the hundred.
You asked me before.

380
00:36:20,302 --> 00:36:22,709
-Think I was picking on you?
-Yes.

381
00:36:23,555 --> 00:36:26,260
-lt was nothing personal.
-Right.

382
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:29,268
I don't think you know
what Homicide does.

383
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,520
-I'll find out.
-l hope not the hard way.

384
00:36:32,772 --> 00:36:34,480
How fast do you run the hundred?

385
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:36,393
Beats me.

386
00:36:36,943 --> 00:36:39,613
I meant to say I'm sorry
about your partner.

387
00:36:39,863 --> 00:36:41,487
He's not the first one.

388
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,152
Fanducci in '68 and Smith in '72,
but it wasn't your fault.

389
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:49,116
-How'd you know?
-Checked your records.

390
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:51,614
I don't want to get killed either.

391
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,037
What's the matter?

392
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:56,045
Black guy with the briefcase.
I know him.

393
00:36:56,296 --> 00:36:57,874
-Tan suit?
-Yeah.

394
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,584
What did he do?

395
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:03,589
Can't remember. It's not important.

396
00:37:06,431 --> 00:37:09,183
-Ever been to one of these before?
-No.

397
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:12,929
In that case, I'd suggest
you sit out here.

398
00:37:13,438 --> 00:37:16,225
Don't concern yourself, inspector.

399
00:37:21,821 --> 00:37:23,102
Hello, Harry.

400
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:25,108
Who's the pretty lady?

401
00:37:25,533 --> 00:37:27,775
My partner, Inspector Moore.

402
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:31,655
-You missed most of it.
-We were at the firing range.

403
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:35,331
I have it on tape.
We finished the abdomen.

404
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:37,163
The wound matters.

405
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,540
The entry wound
was above the renal area...

406
00:37:40,757 --> 00:37:44,091
...between ribs,
penetrating the chest cavity...

407
00:37:44,344 --> 00:37:45,922
...piercing the lung.

408
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:49,215
There was also damage
to some other organs...

409
00:37:49,474 --> 00:37:51,514
...pancreas, kidneys.

410
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,895
-What kind of knife?
-A long, heavy blade.

411
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:57,514
We're going in the skull now.

412
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,602
I'd say it was one of those
killing knives...

413
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:06,231
...a Marine Corps boy,
or Special Forces.

414
00:38:06,491 --> 00:38:07,819
Bruises on the face?

415
00:38:08,076 --> 00:38:11,659
The killer put his hand
over the mouth from behind.

416
00:38:11,913 --> 00:38:13,989
-Professional?
-Textbook.

417
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:18,749
On first exam,
no exterior damage to the skull.

418
00:38:56,676 --> 00:39:01,337
Subject brain shows no
contrecoup damage or clotting.

419
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,308
Jesus H. Christ, come look at this!

420
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:07,595
-lt's the damnedest thing I ever saw.
-What?

421
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:10,724
It says "Eat at Luigi's!"

422
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,831
Welcome to Homicide.

423
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:48,598
What are you doing?

424
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,184
Excuse me, I'm with him.

425
00:39:57,945 --> 00:40:02,239
I was coming down the hall
to take a leak when it blew!

426
00:40:02,616 --> 00:40:04,324
Anybody in there?

427
00:40:06,328 --> 00:40:08,784
-l don't think so.
-Where you going?

428
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,162
A group of kids, some are missing.

429
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:13,291
-Help him out.
-Me?

430
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:16,035
Great, just step out here, will you?

431
00:40:16,297 --> 00:40:18,585
Well, we were lucky this time.

432
00:40:20,092 --> 00:40:23,378
It's getting so you can't
even pee in peace.

433
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,514
-We got them, they're okay.
-Good.

434
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:32,516
You didn't...

435
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:35,975
-... see anybody go in there, did you?
-No.

436
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:39,650
You sure? Black guy,
tan hat and suit, briefcase.

437
00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:43,821
-l saw a guy like that.
-Short guy, about 5' 1 "?

438
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,901
No, this dude was six foot.

439
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,488
That's him.

440
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,242
It's a bomb. I saw who did it.

441
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:56,126
-Any idea?
-Looked familiar.

442
00:40:56,378 --> 00:40:58,086
Just a minute.

443
00:40:58,464 --> 00:41:00,540
You'd better check mug shots.

444
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:04,003
Honey, we're talking.
This is very important.

445
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:07,511
Better check mug shots,
we got another message.

446
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,425
They want two million.

447
00:41:09,683 --> 00:41:10,762
-Two?
-l just saw him.

448
00:41:11,018 --> 00:41:13,805
-Who?
-Tan suit, hat, and a briefcase.

449
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:16,847
-Where?
-Right down here.

450
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:21,271
-Why the hell didn't you tell me?
-Why the hell didn't you ask?

451
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:33,747
There he is, look!

452
00:43:50,636 --> 00:43:51,667
Jesus!

453
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:32,666
Damn it.

454
00:45:13,301 --> 00:45:15,341
What the hell's going on?

455
00:45:17,931 --> 00:45:19,591
What are you doing here?

456
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:33,483
-Who are you?
-Police officer.

457
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,955
Speedy, you're under arrest.

458
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,997
God, this is a church!
What are you doing?

459
00:46:31,254 --> 00:46:33,377
I'm a cop. He's under arrest.

460
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:36,798
Father, I did nothing!
This guy's rousting me!

461
00:46:37,052 --> 00:46:39,969
Is it asking too much
to see a badge, officer?

462
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,753
He runs like a rabbit, I won't let go.

463
00:46:43,016 --> 00:46:45,768
I'd like to see the badge now!

464
00:46:46,478 --> 00:46:47,676
If you insist.

465
00:46:52,526 --> 00:46:55,526
-Callahan, Inspector.
-Callahan...

466
00:46:56,905 --> 00:46:59,478
...you're a disgrace to this city!

467
00:46:59,741 --> 00:47:01,864
Okay! Nobody move!

468
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,074
Marvelous.

469
00:47:14,047 --> 00:47:17,297
I think so.
Harry, wait, I'm talking to...

470
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:18,961
Jesus Christ!

471
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:20,799
Give him my best.

472
00:47:21,054 --> 00:47:22,334
I'll call you back!

473
00:47:22,597 --> 00:47:25,053
It's been disarmed
by the bomb squad.

474
00:47:25,308 --> 00:47:28,808
It's the explosive from
the Hamilton Firearms works.

475
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,721
At times I can only
stand you as a human.

476
00:47:33,316 --> 00:47:35,060
What about the punk?

477
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,774
-The suspect.
-"Suspect, " my ass!

478
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:42,109
He won't talk, but we have a make.
He's Henry Lee Caldwell.

479
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:45,700
Member of a Black Militant group
called Uhuru.

480
00:47:46,538 --> 00:47:48,993
-Pusseau, shelve that.
-Uhuru?

481
00:47:49,249 --> 00:47:52,452
It's run by a guy called
Big Ed Mustapha.

482
00:47:52,711 --> 00:47:55,747
Mustapha, in the Mission District.

483
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,960
I thought he was familiar.
Where's my partner?

484
00:47:59,217 --> 00:48:01,210
She's in the can.

485
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:03,628
Been there since she found out...

486
00:48:03,888 --> 00:48:07,388
...she was packing this thing
all over San Francisco!

487
00:48:07,642 --> 00:48:10,014
Do me a favor. Go easy on her.

488
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,555
It's her first day
and it's been a long one.

489
00:48:13,773 --> 00:48:18,400
She wants to play lumberjack,
she has to handle her end of the log.

490
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:39,916
I give up. What's this?

491
00:48:40,175 --> 00:48:43,923
The Fillmore chapter of the V.F.W.:
Very Few Whites.

492
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:48,219
Can I suggest you wait in the car,
inspector?

493
00:48:48,475 --> 00:48:50,681
Don't concern yourself, inspector.

494
00:48:55,774 --> 00:48:59,107
Well, if it ain't
Mighty Whitey and friend.

495
00:49:00,236 --> 00:49:02,525
I'm looking for Big Ed Mustapha.

496
00:49:02,864 --> 00:49:06,613
Sorry, honky, she can stay,
but you got to go.

497
00:49:07,118 --> 00:49:10,950
Yeah, baby, we trying to keep up
standards, understand.

498
00:49:11,206 --> 00:49:13,957
-You aren't making us welcome.
-You're welcome!

499
00:49:14,209 --> 00:49:17,126
As welcome as a turd in a pool!

500
00:49:27,847 --> 00:49:30,469
Well, look here, if it ain't the fuzz.

501
00:49:30,725 --> 00:49:32,303
I'm looking for Ed Mustapha.

502
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,938
-You got a warrant, honky?
-What I got is Henry Lee Caldwell.

503
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,066
I never heard of him.

504
00:49:39,317 --> 00:49:43,481
Let's see how fast you fuzz
can get your white asses out.

505
00:49:44,364 --> 00:49:46,191
What is Henry Lee into now?

506
00:49:51,246 --> 00:49:54,282
He's playing with dynamite.
You Mustapha?

507
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,659
Yeah, that's right.

508
00:49:57,502 --> 00:49:59,993
Just come into my office here.

509
00:50:01,756 --> 00:50:02,871
Just you.

510
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:07,927
Don't worry, pig,
she won't get lonesome.

511
00:50:11,057 --> 00:50:13,133
That's mighty white of you.

512
00:50:16,104 --> 00:50:18,773
Before we do anything uncalled-for...

513
00:50:19,023 --> 00:50:22,392
...l'd like to point out
that I'm an officer.

514
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,072
Callahan.

515
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,323
Where do I know you from?

516
00:50:39,043 --> 00:50:40,158
You don't.

517
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:43,415
I just know you.

518
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:52,463
Now, what's Henry Lee been up to?

519
00:50:52,765 --> 00:50:54,343
Saying you don't know?

520
00:50:54,601 --> 00:50:58,266
He don't come around here,
not for a long time.

521
00:50:58,605 --> 00:51:00,063
Where is he?

522
00:51:01,065 --> 00:51:04,683
He went white.
Why, he do something else foolish?

523
00:51:06,613 --> 00:51:10,824
He and his friends helped
rip off the Hamilton Firearms.

524
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,777
I heard about that.

525
00:51:13,745 --> 00:51:15,488
You wanna buy into that?

526
00:51:15,747 --> 00:51:17,988
Four counts of murder,
aiding and abetting?

527
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:22,578
You got the wrong number, boy.
We don't deal in violence.

528
00:51:22,837 --> 00:51:25,293
-What do you deal in?
-Waiting.

529
00:51:26,299 --> 00:51:27,497
For what?

530
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:32,835
Waiting for all you honkies...

531
00:51:33,097 --> 00:51:36,632
...to blow each other up
so we can move on in.

532
00:51:38,936 --> 00:51:41,392
Talk about Henry Lee
and his friends.

533
00:51:41,606 --> 00:51:45,769
Some dudes he met in Vietnam. Why?

534
00:51:48,321 --> 00:51:50,859
Anybody on this list here grab you?

535
00:51:51,324 --> 00:51:54,278
Hey, man, why should I help you?

536
00:51:55,203 --> 00:51:58,987
I can talk to Robbery.
They'd be interested in this...

537
00:51:59,374 --> 00:52:01,117
...elaborate furnishing.

538
00:52:01,376 --> 00:52:03,083
What are you talking about?

539
00:52:05,129 --> 00:52:07,003
"Room 401, Fairmont."

540
00:52:08,841 --> 00:52:10,668
"Rest at the Holiday Inn."

541
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:13,337
Okay, okay, okay, so?

542
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:16,054
Maybe they're a little warm.

543
00:52:16,432 --> 00:52:17,974
I tell you what...

544
00:52:18,684 --> 00:52:21,970
...one of my boys got busted
on possession.

545
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:26,014
You get him off, and ignore
my interior decorator...

546
00:52:26,442 --> 00:52:28,435
...and I'll see what I can do.

547
00:52:28,694 --> 00:52:31,565
-That's a lot.
-You want a lot.

548
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:36,532
A thing like this can ruin my image.

549
00:52:39,914 --> 00:52:41,492
I'll see what I can do.

550
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:44,250
What about the list?

551
00:52:53,302 --> 00:52:54,713
Bobby Maxwell.

552
00:52:58,057 --> 00:53:01,141
-He's the main man.
-You know him?

553
00:53:01,602 --> 00:53:03,642
Stone waste of white.

554
00:53:03,896 --> 00:53:05,770
Where can I find him?

555
00:53:07,191 --> 00:53:08,899
I'll check around.

556
00:53:10,403 --> 00:53:13,569
You do that. Much obliged.

557
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:17,441
Callahan, you're on the wrong side.

558
00:53:17,702 --> 00:53:19,611
How do you figure that?

559
00:53:19,912 --> 00:53:21,786
You put your ass on the line...

560
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:25,823
...for dudes who wouldn't
let you in the door any more...

561
00:53:26,919 --> 00:53:28,248
...than they would me.

562
00:53:28,629 --> 00:53:31,085
-lt's not for them.
-Who, then?

563
00:53:32,085 --> 00:53:42,085
