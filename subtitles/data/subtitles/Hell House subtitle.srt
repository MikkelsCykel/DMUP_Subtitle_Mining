00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:24,000
ALthoug the story os this film is fictious,
The events depicted invoLving psychic

2
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:34,000
phenomena are not only very much within the
bounds of possibility, but couLd weLL be true.

3
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:58,656
Dr. Barrett?

4
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:16,107
My peopLe teLL me

5
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:20,271
you're among
the best five in your fieLd.

6
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:22,609
Your fee wiLL be
libras 100,000.

7
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:25,616
Your assignment:
to estabLish the facts.

8
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:27,049
Regarding what?

9
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,144
SurvivaL after death.

10
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,483
You want me

11
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:32,615
To Let me know if it's factuaL.

12
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:35,524
What wouLd convince you
either way?

13
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:37,528
Give me the facts.

14
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:40,429
Where can I find these facts?
I'm a physiscist...

15
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:42,399
In 20 years of study psicologia

16
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:46,267
You'LL find them
in the onLy pLace I Know on Earth

17
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,966
where survivaL hasn't
yet been refuted.

18
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,804
The BeLasco House.

19
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:53,174
HeLL House?

20
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:56,310
HeLL House.

21
00:01:56,381 --> 00:02:00,317
The BeLascos seaLed it up
after what happened.

22
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:03,377
20 years ago.
They need money now.

23
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:05,389
I've bought the pLace.

24
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:07,425
Can you be there
Monday?

25
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,392
WeLL, can you?

26
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:10,792
Yes.

27
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,888
There'LL be two others.

28
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:14,455
FLorence Tanner--

29
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:17,331
Tanner?
But she's a mentaL medium.

30
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:20,894
Yes. I want that
approach empLoyed, too.

31
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:22,907
She's practicaLLy a chiLd.

32
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:24,909
My peopLe teLL me

33
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:28,913
she's the best
in her fieLd, too.

34
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,744
And the other one?

35
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:35,412
The onLy survivor
from the Last attempt.

36
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:37,216
Fischer?

37
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:40,918
I expect an answer
within a week.

38
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,119
A week?

39
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:44,822
Take it or Leave it.

40
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:01,779
I have a List
of aLL phenomena

41
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:04,372
recorded at
the BeLasco House,

42
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:06,383
restoration of eLectricity,

43
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:08,214
transportation of
your equipment.

44
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:09,879
Is that it?

45
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:12,890
No. There's a partiaLLy
constructed machine.

46
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,892
How Long before
it's compLete?

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,396
Depends on how many
eLectronics experts you use.

48
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:20,897
How soon
wiLL you need it?

49
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,399
Wednesday.

50
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:23,900
Good day.

51
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:33,911
It wouLd be better
if you didn't come.

52
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,415
But I aLways
come with you.

53
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:41,782
I don't want
to be Left aLone.

54
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,912
I want to be there

55
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,924
when you prove
your new theory.

56
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:50,519
Isn't it just another
so-caLLed haunted house?

57
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:53,928
It's the Mount Everest
of haunted houses.

58
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,936
There were two attempts
to investigate it.

59
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:01,871
Both were disasters.
Eight peopLe died.

60
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,170
Fischer was
the onLy survivor.

61
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:07,177
He crawLed out
a mentaL wreck.

62
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,401
These are the house keys.

63
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,404
Your Luggage
and equipment

64
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:42,406
has aLready
been instaLLed.

65
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:45,409
ELectricity's on.
Your rooms are ready.

66
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:47,411
There's a fuLL Larder.

67
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,414
I'LL return
at 5:00 on the 2 4th.

68
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:04,807
Look at the windows.

69
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:09,812
He had them bricked up
so no one couLd see in.

70
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,313
Or out.

71
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:35,337
It's hideous.

72
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:39,341
We're not even inside yet,
Miss Tanner.

73
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:41,900
I don't have to be.

74
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:55,357
[Trying Light Switch]

75
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:57,359
So much for eLectricity.

76
00:07:57,427 --> 00:07:59,361
There's a generator?

77
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:00,396
Yes.

78
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:06,301
My God, that smeLL.

79
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,307
The atmosphere in here.

80
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:16,812
Of this worLd,
not the next.

81
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:20,315
This house...

82
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:22,318
it knows we're here.

83
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:24,320
Miss Tanner.

84
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:25,821
Sorry.

85
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,824
I'LL keep my observations
to myseLf.

86
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:34,830
Do you know where
the emergency generator is?

87
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:50,838
I hope
I didn't disturb you.

88
00:08:50,914 --> 00:08:55,851
It's just that I'm concerned
for you coming here.

89
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,012
Yes, I understand.

90
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,051
I wonder if you do.

91
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:33,856
Just how weaLthy
was Mr. BeLasco?

92
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:37,860
I beLieve he Left miLLions
when he died.

93
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:43,866
Died?

94
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:47,335
If there's anything
you'd care to teLL us...

95
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:49,872
What's to teLL?

96
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,875
The house tried
to kiLL me.

97
00:09:52,943 --> 00:09:55,377
It aLmost succeeded.

98
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,955
That Leads to the ceLLars,
Mr. Fischer?

99
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,456
That's right.

100
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:15,925
What's through there?

101
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:17,694
The chapeL.

102
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:20,100
ChapeL?

103
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:38,948
Sorry.
I can't right now.

104
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,224
We understand.

105
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,682
WeLcome to my house.

106
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,184
I'm deLighted
you couLd come.

107
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:13,689
I'm certain you wiLLfind
your stay most iLLuminating.

108
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:17,318
Think of me
as your unseen host...

109
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,699
Why couLdn't
Miss Tanner come in?

110
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,203
Her system is attuned
to psychic energy.

111
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,262
ObviousLy,
it's very strong in here.

112
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,334
A church in heLL,
that sort of thing.

113
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:39,347
Why doesn't it
affect him?

114
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,350
ObviousLy,
he protects himseLf

115
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:43,613
better than she does.

116
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:52,861
Miss Tanner.

117
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:58,867
Miss Tanner?

118
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,869
I'm sure it's nothing.

119
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,302
Are you?

120
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:21,274
Miss Tanner?

121
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:23,277
I'm over here.

122
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:28,547
You shouLdn't
have done that,

123
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:30,107
Miss Tanner.

124
00:12:30,185 --> 00:12:33,279
You caused us
undue aLarm.

125
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:36,153
I heard a voice in here.

126
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:39,523
WeLcome to my house.

127
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:41,755
I'm deLighted
you couLd come.

128
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,766
I'm certain you wiLLfind
your stay most iLLuminating.

129
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:48,860
Think of me
as your unseen host.

130
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:51,531
BeLieve that during
your stay here,

131
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:53,540
I shaLLbe with you

132
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:55,200
in spirit.

133
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:58,178
May you find
the answer you seek.

134
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:01,613
It is here, I promise you.

135
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:05,141
And now,
auf wiedersehen.

136
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:13,160
Auf wiedersehen.

137
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:15,253
''TiLL we meet again.''

138
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,491
The record wasn't for us.

139
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:22,361
What made
the record go on?

140
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:26,134
BeLasco said
he couLd wiLL peopLe

141
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,644
to a particuLar object,

142
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:33,841
then move among them
unobserved.

143
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:35,815
I doubt that.

144
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:39,819
Do you?

145
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:45,826
Our attention was on that
a few moments ago.

146
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:50,593
How do you know
he didn't waLk right by us?

147
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:06,781
This house hasn't Lived up
to its reputation so far.

148
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:09,783
It hasn't taken
our measure yet.

149
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:13,082
Don't consider the house
the haunting force.

150
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:16,146
Quite evidentLy,
the probLem is created

151
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:18,658
by muLtipLe
surviving personaLities.

152
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:25,165
I take it you don't beLieve in
survivaL, Dr. Barrett.

153
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:27,667
If you mean
surviving personaLities,

154
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,169
you're correct.

155
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:31,171
We wiLL see.

156
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:33,173
Indeed we shaLL.

157
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:35,675
When was
the house buiLt?

158
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:37,678
I don't know.

159
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,179
Mr. Fischer?

160
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:42,444
1 91 9.

161
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:46,214
You seem to know
a Lot about BeLasco.

162
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:49,689
WouLd you mind
sharing it with us?

163
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,693
His first name
was Emeric.

164
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:56,196
He was born
on March 23, 1 87 9,

165
00:14:56,264 --> 00:14:58,357
the iLLegitimate son

166
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,867
of an American
munitions maker.

167
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:03,131
What did he Look Like?

168
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:05,638
His was
a frightening visage,

169
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:08,141
the face of a demon

170
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:11,474
that had taken on
some human aspect.

171
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:14,640
Are you quoting?

172
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:16,775
Yes, I am.

173
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:19,149
That is his second wife.

174
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,156
She committed suicide
in this room in 1 927.

175
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:27,151
How taLL was he?

176
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:29,162
He was 6'5''.

177
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,960
They caLLed him
the Roaring Giant.

178
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:34,160
What did he do

179
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:38,171
to make this house
so eviL, Mr. Fischer?

180
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:41,675
Drug addiction,
aLcohoLism,

181
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:43,176
sadism,

182

necrophiLia, cannibaLism,

185
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,050
not to mention
a gamut of sexuaL goodies.

186
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:55,055
ShaLL I go on?

187
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:57,591
How did it end?

188
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:02,221
If it had ended,
we wouLd not be here.

189
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:04,993
It's about to end,
Mr. Fischer.

190
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:18,469
What happened
to Mr. BeLasco?

191
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:22,149
No one knows.

192
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:24,651
When reLatives
of the guests

193
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:28,155
had this house
broken into in 1 929,

194
00:16:28,223 --> 00:16:31,659
they found
aLL 27 of them dead.

195
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:33,853
BeLasco wasn't
among them.

196
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:37,998
If no one objects,

197
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:40,159
I'LL try a sitting tonight.

198
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:42,169
I have no objection.

199
00:16:42,237 --> 00:16:44,671
WouLd you care to sit

200
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:47,173
in the morning,
Mr. Fischer?

201
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:49,176
I'm not ready yet.

Spirit of Love
and tenderness,

203
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:02,121
we gather here tonight
to communicate with those

204
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,125
who waLk this house
in torment.

205
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:07,127
HeLp us to bridge

206
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:10,130
the chasm of death
so faithfuLLy

207
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:13,133
that pain is transformed
into joy,

208
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:15,135
sorrow into peace.

209
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:17,137
ALL this we ask

210
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:20,641
in the name
of our Infinite Father.

211

Amen.

212
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:52,673
This is an eviL house,

Yes.

222
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:31,144
There is a young man.

00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:33,305
Very young.

224

Why are you here?

228
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,169
It does no good.

229
00:18:57,238 --> 00:18:59,570
Nothing changes.

230
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:02,075
Nothing.

231
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:05,112

[Pounding]

239
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,624
You started manifesting
physicaL phenomena.

240
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:15,129
But I'm not
a physicaL medium.

241
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:17,131
You were just now.

242

The embryo of one.

and now this.

in mysterious ways.

248

So does this house.

Back to normaL.

250
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,609
Those pounding noises
are a bit unnerving

251
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,544
the first time
you hear them.

252
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:14,055
Why was Miss Tanner
so disturbed by that sitting?

253
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:16,455
Because she caused
physicaL phenomena.

254
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,494
If Miss Tanner
is a mentaL medium

00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:22,496
and Mr. Fischer
a physicaL medium,

how can you be sure she created
those noises, not Fischer?

257
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:32,006
I can't.

about Mr. Fischer
or Miss Tanner.

Yes, it is you, isn't it?

265

You must give me
some sign.

He's very young
and frightened.

he's very hostiLe.

coming out of trance.

333
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:12,392
Premature retraction
of ectopLasm

334
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,896
causing brief
systemic shock.

335

ConcLusion of sitting,
2:48 P.M.

336

What is it?

341
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:45,425
A specimen of that teLepLasm
prepared in water.

342
00:28:48,496 --> 00:28:51,932
What the spirituaLists
refer to as ectopLasm

343
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,936
is derived aLmost entireLy
from the medium's body,

344
00:28:56,004 --> 00:28:57,938
the remainder
being admixtures

00:28:58,006 --> 00:29:00,440
from the air,
the medium's costume,

fibrous remains,
dust particLes.

347

But the buLk is
organic Living matter,

348
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,910
an organic externaLization

349

Why shouLd mediums

that science dictates?

359

We're not machines!

360
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:38,232
I'm not a medium for fun.

That I'm responsibLe?

You're the one who shouLd

01:08:53,574 --> 01:08:56,509
You needn't come back,
Mr. Fischer.

831
01:08:56,577 --> 01:08:59,171
The house wiLL be cLear.

832
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:03,515
CLear?

833
01:09:03,584 --> 01:09:04,881
How?

834
01:09:04,952 --> 01:09:07,011
There isn't time
for expLanation.

835
01:09:07,088 --> 01:09:09,352
Yes, there is.

836
01:09:09,423 --> 01:09:10,390
FLorence.

837
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:13,894
I am not Leaving
untiL I know.

838
01:09:15,463 --> 01:09:17,328
ALL right.

839
01:09:17,398 --> 01:09:20,834
The body emits
a form of energy

840
01:09:20,902 --> 01:09:23,336
invisibLe
to the human eye.

841
01:09:23,404 --> 01:09:25,838
This energy
can be expanded

842
01:09:25,907 --> 01:09:27,841
far beyond the body,

843
01:09:27,909 --> 01:09:29,843
where it can create

844
01:09:29,911 --> 01:09:31,845
mechanicaL, chemicaL,
physicaL effects,

845
01:09:31,913 --> 01:09:34,848
sounds, moving objects
Like we've experieced.

846
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:37,350
The energy I taLk about

847
01:09:37,418 --> 01:09:40,353
is a fieLd of
eLectromagnetic radiation.

848
01:09:40,421 --> 01:09:41,353
E.M.R.

849
01:09:41,422 --> 01:09:42,514
ExactLy.

850
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:45,354
ALL Living organisms
emit this energy.

851
01:09:45,426 --> 01:09:48,862
Such power must saturate
its environment.

852
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:50,864
Is it any wonder

853
01:09:50,932 --> 01:09:54,390
that HeLL House
is the way it is?

854
01:09:54,468 --> 01:09:58,302
Consider the mentaL
and physicaL energy

855
01:09:58,372 --> 01:10:01,864
which is being poured
into its interior.

856
01:10:01,943 --> 01:10:04,878
The house
is a giant battery,

857
01:10:04,946 --> 01:10:06,880
the residuaL energy
of which

858
01:10:06,948 --> 01:10:08,540
must be tapped.

859
01:10:08,616 --> 01:10:12,211
We survive with this energy
after death.

860
01:10:12,286 --> 01:10:13,878
No, Miss Tanner.

861
01:10:13,955 --> 01:10:16,822
This residue
has nothing to do

862
01:10:16,891 --> 01:10:18,825
with surviving
personaLities.

863
01:10:18,893 --> 01:10:21,327
The spirit
of Emeric BeLasco

864
01:10:21,395 --> 01:10:23,829
does not prowL
this house.

865
01:10:23,898 --> 01:10:25,832
Neither does his son

866
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:28,164
or any other entities

867
01:10:28,236 --> 01:10:32,832
that you beLieve yourseLf
to be in contact with.

868
01:10:32,907 --> 01:10:34,841
There is one thing

869
01:10:34,909 --> 01:10:38,345
and one thing onLy
in this house--

870
01:10:38,412 --> 01:10:40,346
mindLess,
directionLess power.

871
01:10:40,414 --> 01:10:42,348
You're wrong, Dr. Barrett.

872
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:44,850
You cannot
destroy a spirit.

873
01:10:44,919 --> 01:10:49,788
ALL you wiLL do is send it
to another heLL.

874
01:10:49,857 --> 01:10:51,848
No, Miss Tanner.

875
01:10:51,926 --> 01:10:53,860
I'm right.

876
01:10:53,928 --> 01:10:56,863
My machine
wiLL fiLL the house

877
01:10:56,931 --> 01:10:58,865
with a massive
countercharge

878

of eLectromagnetic
radiation,

879
01:11:00,868 --> 01:11:03,837
opposing the poLarity
of the atmosphere,

880
01:11:03,904 --> 01:11:05,838
reversing,
and dissipating it.

881
01:11:07,441 --> 01:11:10,376
And HeLL House
wiLL be exorcised.

882
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:17,474

883

891
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:05,365
There was
nothing eLse to do.

892
01:12:05,433 --> 01:12:07,367
That's what she said.

893
01:12:07,435 --> 01:12:10,370
She had to destroy
my beLiefs

894

destroyed hers.

01:24:23,117 --> 01:24:26,280
One entity pretending
to be DanieL.

999
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:29,789
One entity pretending
to be many others.

1000
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:32,291
That's where
the answer Lies.

1001
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:40,299
But what's the key?

1002
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:42,528
What is the key?

1003
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:01,821
Extremes and Limits.

1004
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:05,325
Terminations and extremities.

1005
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:06,484
Oh.

1006
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:10,329
Oh, God.

1007
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:15,334
Of course.
That's what she meant.

1008
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:20,271
Extremes.

1009
01:25:20,341 --> 01:25:22,275
Limits.

1010
01:25:25,346 --> 01:25:27,280
Legs.

1011
01:25:28,849 --> 01:25:35,277
Grace Lauter's spine
and Legs shattered.

1012
01:25:36,857 --> 01:25:39,792
Dr. Graham crawLing.

1013
01:25:42,363 --> 01:25:46,299
Professor Rand, paraLyzed.

1014
01:25:46,367 --> 01:25:50,303
Professor FenLey, crippLed.

1015
01:25:50,371 --> 01:25:53,306

offend thee... ''

01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,314
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1019
01:26:07,388 --> 01:26:08,821
BeLasco!

1020
01:26:11,392 --> 01:26:16,329
Whatever you do,
do not interfere.

1021
01:26:28,842 --> 01:26:30,275
BeLasco.

1022
01:26:32,846 --> 01:26:35,280
Here I am.

1023
01:26:35,349 --> 01:26:38,216
Destroy me if you can.

1024
01:26:38,285 --> 01:26:41,152
Don't Leave the job
haLf done.

1025
01:26:41,221 --> 01:26:43,280
We're here.

01:26:43,357 --> 01:26:45,689

That's it.

1029
01:27:03,877 --> 01:27:07,313
Oh, that's it.

1030
01:27:14,888 --> 01:27:18,756
TeLL me something,
BeLasco.

1031
01:27:20,828 --> 01:27:24,264
Why didn't you ever
Leave this house

1032
01:27:24,331 --> 01:27:26,265
when you were aLive?

1033
01:27:27,835 --> 01:27:31,771
Why did you despise
the sunLight?

1034
01:27:33,841 --> 01:27:38,278
Was it better hiding
in the shadows?

1035
01:27:38,345 --> 01:27:41,781
[Whining Noise]

1036
01:27:41,849 --> 01:27:43,783
No one...

1037
01:27:43,851 --> 01:27:47,287
No one couLd reaLLy
see you then,

1038
01:27:47,354 --> 01:27:49,788
couLd they?

1039
01:27:49,857 --> 01:27:52,291
No one couLd find out

1040
01:27:52,359 --> 01:27:55,294
your secret then,
couLd they?

1041
01:27:57,865 --> 01:28:01,301
You weren't a genius!

1042
01:28:01,368 --> 01:28:05,304
You were a deviate!

1043
01:28:05,372 --> 01:28:09,706
A sawed-off
LittLe bastard!

1044

[Roaring Noise]

1045
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:21,319
Your mother was a bitch!

1046
01:28:21,388 --> 01:28:24,323
A whore!

1047
01:28:24,391 --> 01:28:26,951
You were a bastard!

1048
01:28:31,899 --> 01:28:36,836
A funny LittLe
dried-up bastard!

1049
01:28:36,904 --> 01:28:40,840
You're no genius!

1050
01:28:40,908 --> 01:28:44,639
You're no Roaring Giant!

1051
01:28:48,916 --> 01:28:53,853
What size were you,
BeLasco?

1052
01:28:53,921 --> 01:28:56,856
5-foot 2?

1053
01:28:56,924 --> 01:28:59,859
1 ?

1054
01:28:59,927 --> 01:29:06,355
I know you weren't even
5-foot taLL.

1055
01:29:06,433 --> 01:29:10,870
Aah!

1056
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:23,315
Emeric BeLasco.

1057
01:29:26,386 --> 01:29:29,822
The Roaring Giant.

1058
01:29:38,899 --> 01:29:40,992
Is it cLear?

1059
01:30:41,094 --> 01:30:43,927
This is a speciaL moment.

1060
01:30:43,997 --> 01:30:48,161
Meet Emeric BeLasco.

1061
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:51,864
Your husband did have
part of the answer.

1062
01:30:51,939 --> 01:30:55,875
FLorence had
part of it, too.

1063
01:30:55,943 --> 01:30:59,379
I finaLLy found
the Last part,

1064
01:30:59,446 --> 01:31:02,381
that which
BeLasco's giant ego

1065
01:31:02,449 --> 01:31:04,679
couLd not face.

1066
01:31:16,463 --> 01:31:19,330
He so despised
his own shortness

1067
01:31:19,399 --> 01:31:22,334
that he cut off his Legs

1068
01:31:22,402 --> 01:31:26,338
and wore those instead
to give himseLf height.

1069
01:31:26,406 --> 01:31:30,342
''If thine eye offend thee,
pLuck it out.''

1070
01:31:39,419 --> 01:31:42,855
Maybe he was a genius
after aLL.

1071
01:31:42,923 --> 01:31:46,359
Just because a man
preserves his body

1072
01:31:46,426 --> 01:31:48,860
doesn't make him
a genius.

1073
01:31:48,929 --> 01:31:53,366
It's not his body
of which I'm speaking.

1074
01:31:53,433 --> 01:31:56,368
This is why
your husband's machine

1075
01:31:56,436 --> 01:31:59,371
couLd not destroy
his power.

1076
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:05,378
These waLLs
are sheathed with Lead.

1077
01:32:05,445 --> 01:32:08,380
He buiLt himseLf
a fortress

1078
01:32:08,448 --> 01:32:11,383
to protect his spirit.

1079
01:32:11,451 --> 01:32:15,888
He knew what was coming
years before it came.

1080
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,834
Your husband
and FLorence

1081
01:32:28,902 --> 01:32:31,837
heLped us
to rid this house

1082
01:32:31,905 --> 01:32:33,338
of BeLasco.

1083
01:32:33,407 --> 01:32:36,342
Let us hope
that their spirits

1084
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:39,846
guide him
to everLasting peace.

1085
01:32:45,919 --> 01:32:49,704
BeLasco.
