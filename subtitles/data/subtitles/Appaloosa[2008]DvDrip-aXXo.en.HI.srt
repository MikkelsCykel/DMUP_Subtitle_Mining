two of your boys back into town with me.

You're outside your jurisdiction, marshal.

That I care more about marshaling
than her.

That I ain't even brung you down
to see the house yet.

Well, go on down there, will you?

She asked me which one I liked
for the curtain.

I got a carpenter that used to build boats.

Go on.

whichever one she likes.

You can see right through it.

Must be something can be done.

1102
01:38:03,093 --> 01:38:05,755
They ain't gonna run me off.

1103
01:38:08,933 --> 01:38:12,994
And Bragg's got Olson and his bunch
right in his pocket.

1104
01:38:16,106 --> 01:38:18,802
We got hired. We can get fired.

1105
01:38:18,976 --> 01:38:21,536
Me and Allie got a house here.

1106
01:38:23,047 --> 01:38:24,947
I'm not leaving.

1107
01:38:28,018 --> 01:38:30,282
What are you gonna stay as?

1108
01:38:30,888 --> 01:38:33,118
We ain't come to that yet.

1109
01:38:35,426 --> 01:38:38,862
Might just make some sense to move on.

1110
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:45,498
Talked this over with Allie?

1111
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:48,396
She don't wanna leave either?

1112
01:39:08,792 --> 01:39:11,556
I got some things to say, Virgil.

1113
01:39:17,801 --> 01:39:20,702
I stay here,
I won't be able to make a living.

1114
01:39:21,705 --> 01:39:22,797
I know.

1115
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:31,007
- I got something else to say.
- She might leave me.

1116
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:34,881
Yeah.

1117
01:39:35,953 --> 01:39:40,322
- You saw how it was with Ring Shelton.
- I ain't leaving her.

1118
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:54,794
All right.

1119
01:39:59,777 --> 01:40:01,176
All right.

1120
01:42:37,034 --> 01:42:40,868
I shot a man in Tres Piedras years ago.

1121
01:42:42,806 --> 01:42:45,570
Only time I killed it wasn't legal.

1122
01:43:19,977 --> 01:43:22,070
I'm gonna be leaving.

1123
01:43:35,692 --> 01:43:38,160
TILDA:
More coffee, Mr. Raines?

1124
01:43:39,496 --> 01:43:42,329
- Will there be anything else for you?
- No, thank you.

1125
01:43:52,509 --> 01:43:54,636
HITCH:
Give this to Bragg when he asks for it.

1126
01:43:54,811 --> 01:43:57,575
- Everett.
- Just do it.

1127
01:43:57,748 --> 01:43:58,806
BRAGG:
Long notes.

1128
01:43:58,982 --> 01:44:00,643
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1129
01:44:00,817 --> 01:44:02,045
[CHATTERING AND LAUGHING]

1130
01:44:03,687 --> 01:44:05,211
Everett.

1131
01:44:07,858 --> 01:44:09,849
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1132
01:44:10,427 --> 01:44:14,227
You're a lying, back-shooting,
cowardly son of a bitch.

1133
01:44:15,599 --> 01:44:17,396
BRAGG:
What is this?

1134
01:44:18,435 --> 01:44:20,335
What is this?

1135
01:44:20,504 --> 01:44:22,267
I'll be out in the street.

1136
01:44:22,439 --> 01:44:25,840
BRAGG: But you're a deputy marshal.
You can't call me out.

1137
01:44:26,410 --> 01:44:28,275
Wallis has a gun for you.

1138
01:44:28,445 --> 01:44:31,937
I'm going outside. You don't come out,
I'll come back in and kill you.

1139
01:44:36,687 --> 01:44:40,282
You think you can pull on me
without your friend Cole to back you up?

1140
01:44:59,643 --> 01:45:01,133
Everett.

1141
01:45:01,778 --> 01:45:03,871
Just leave it, Virgil.

1142
01:45:04,047 --> 01:45:06,515
Just hold on. What's this about?

1143
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:10,084
I ever ask you for anything?

1144
01:45:11,955 --> 01:45:13,149
Well, I'm asking you now.

1145
01:45:15,258 --> 01:45:17,488
Just leave it alone.

1146
01:45:25,969 --> 01:45:27,766
Just once, Virgil.

1147
01:45:28,672 --> 01:45:30,435
One favor.

1148
01:47:40,237 --> 01:47:43,070
HITCH: <i>I figured I'd saved Virgil's career</i>
<i>as a lawman...</i>

1149
01:47:44,207 --> 01:47:47,108
<i>... and given him another chance</i>
<i>with Allie.</i>

1150
01:47:47,377 --> 01:47:50,403
<i>At least for the foreseeable future.</i>

1151
01:47:51,414 --> 01:47:52,813
<i>As for the unforeseeable...</i>

1152
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:57,414
<i>... well, it was out there waiting for me.</i>

1153
01:47:59,389 --> 01:48:04,486
<i>I headed straight into the setting sun</i>
<i>and rode west at an easy pace.</i>

1154
01:48:04,961 --> 01:48:07,225
<i>It was gonna be a long ride...</i>

1155
01:48:07,397 --> 01:48:10,127
<i>... and there was no reason to hurry.</i>

1156
01:55:19,929 --> 01:55:21,920
