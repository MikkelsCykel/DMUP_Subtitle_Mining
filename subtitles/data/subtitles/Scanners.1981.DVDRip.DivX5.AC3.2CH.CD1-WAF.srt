00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,335
Will you look at that
fellow over there?

2
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,395
I've never seen anything
so disgusting in all my life.

3
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,701
I'll tell you something.

4
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,332
He's staring.

5
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,570
I think
he's looking at us.

6
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,712
I think we're
being picked up.

7
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,872
Oh, it's too awful.

8
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,210
Can you believe it?

9
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,513
They can let creatures
like that in here.

10
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,179
I mean, really. It's...

11
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,360
Anne, what's the matter, huh?

12
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,405
Anne?

13
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,940
Oh! Oh, help someone, please.

14
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,109
Oh! please, help.

15
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,013
Damn it!

16
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,317
You're 35 years old, Mr. Vale.

17
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:59,117
Why are you such a derelict?

18
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,184
Such a piece of human junk?

19
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,089
The answer's simple.

20
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,326
You're a scanner,

21
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,562
but you don't realize it,

22
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,764
and that has been the source
of all your agony.

23
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,041
But I will show you now

24
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,411
that it can be
a source of great power.

25
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,983
Let them in.

26
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,192
Not much of a place, is it?

27
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,498
Still, didn't pay for it, so...

28
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,241
Hurry up.

29
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,797
Hurry up!

30
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,180
We can talk now.

31
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,530
I would like to scan
all of you in this room
one at a time.

32
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:37,362
I, I must remind you
that the, uh, scanning experience
is usually a painful one,

33
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,904
sometimes resulting in nosebleeds,

34
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,736
earaches, stomach cramps, nausea.

35
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,743
sometimes other symptoms
of a similar nature.

36
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,678
There's a doctor present
Dr. Gatineau.

37
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,410
I know that you've all
been prepared for this,

38
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,214
but I thought I'd just
remind you just the same.

39
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,685
Uh, there is
one other thing.

40
00:10:55,755 --> 00:11:00,658
No one is to leave this room
once the demonstration has begun.

41
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,989
At this point I'd like
to call for volunteers.

42
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,867
Anyone. It doesn't matter.

43
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,875
Fine.

44
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,554
Just, uh...

45
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,556
Sit right here, please.

46
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,102
Now, I'd, I'd like you
to think of
something specific.

47
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,333
something that will not
breach the security
of you organization.

48
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,569
And that you will not object
to having disclosed
to this group.

49
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,840
- Something, uh, personal, perhaps.
- All right.

50
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:55,941
Yes, I have something.

51
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,313
- Do I have to close my eyes?
- It doesn't matter.

52
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,411
All right.
Yes, I have something.

53
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,851
All right.

54
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,763
Move everybody out! Now!

55
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,027
Call consec leader!

56
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,766
I want you to come with me.

57
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:27,669
I didn't do anything.

58
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,368
I said I want you to come with me.

59
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,467
Come on.

60
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,245
Gatineau, come with us.

61
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,785
Down there. Quick!

62
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,690
Move it!

63
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,828
Get down!

64
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,730
Give him a shot of ephemeral.

65
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,767
Come on!

66
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,735
OK.

67
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:57,959
Take it easy.

68
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,793
All we need is to get
stopped by a cop.

69
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,765
Ah, it'd serve 'em right.

70
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,735
Why the hell
did they have to send us
to the old factory?

71
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:08,330
If this guy's a scanner
they don't want him
down at central.

72
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,136
They're afraid of him.

73
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,170
He's a scanner.

74
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,350
Hey, where's security 2?

75
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,885
- He's moving up fast on the left.
- Hey, man, what's happening?

76
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,754
Ray, what the hell's
the matter with you?

77
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,694
You gotta pull back
behind them, man.

78
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,201
Come on!

79
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,062
Ray, I'm gonna kill you
if you don't do it.

80
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,106
Ray!

81
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,744
Oh, my god.

82
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,684
Don't stop! Move it!

83
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,279
No, we got to get 'em
out of there!

84
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,658
We've got to get in there.

85
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,134
They're charred, man!
You can see them burning.

86
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,500
Let go of me!

87
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,095
Those people are dead!

88
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,141
Get up.

89
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,583
Let's get out of here, man!
Come on!

90
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,414
You want to get us killed?

91
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,182
All right. All right. Pipe down!

92
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,908
Last night...

93
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,311
We at consec chose to reveal
to the outside world

94
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,517
our work with those...

95
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:44,187
Telepathic curiosities
known as scanners.

96
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,924
The result

97
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,898
6 corpses...

98
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,194
And a substantial loss
in credibility
for our organization.

99
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,105
So, this morning
we have a new director
of internal security,

100
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:02,546
- Mr. Braedon Keller.
- Thank you. Mr. Trevellyan.

101
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,911
Gentlemen,

102
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,815
we're in the business
of international security.

103
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,979
We deal in weaponry
and private armories.

104
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:14,685
We do not trade
in fantasy and pipe dreams.

105
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:21,427
Let us leave the development
of dolphins and freaks
as weapons of espionage to others.

106
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,365
Now, with all due respect

107
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,198
to Dr. Paul Ruth,

108
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,570
I recommend that we drop
our scanner program immediately, sir.

109
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,940
Dr. Ruth, what's your response?

110
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,114
Mr. Keller, who composed
our audience last night?

111
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,341
We had 25 financial
and political V.I.P. s

112
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,853
from all over North America.

113
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,822
Were these V.I.P. s
carefully screened?

114
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,951
The screening process used
was very sophisticated, yes.

115
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:53,589
And yet an assassin managed
to infiltrate this group.

116
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,762
Yes.

117
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,769
And killed 6 of our people.

118
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,099
Yes.

119
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,867
How did he kill them?

120
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,431
We have reason to believe he...

121
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,274
used scanning techniques.

122
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,042
Then do you suggest, Mr. Keller,

123
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,983
that this highly-skilled assassin- very deadly

124
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:18,352
who embarrassed us all
in front of the community
we were trying to impress,

125
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,618
was himself a scanner?

126
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,819
We believe so, yes.

127
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,125
That, gentlemen, is my response.

128
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:29,827
The weapons capability
of these, uh, telepathic...

129
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,994
curiosities.

130
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,500
Is obvious.

131
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,768
If I may, doctor,

132
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:42,244
your program is based
on a list
of 236 known scanners,

133
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,441
- is it now?
- It is.

134
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,649
Of that number,

135
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,481
Of that number,

136
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,114
how many are now
working with us?

137
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,351
As of last night, none.

138
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,892
Well, then.

139
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,124
We don't even have
a program to drop, do we?

140
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,792
It shouldn't be
very painful for anyone.

141
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:06,201
Consec surveillance
has gradually lost contact
with all the names on our list,

142
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,138
and I submit that this...
this is not an accident.

143
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,301
I think we've lost them
to a program

144
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,310
far in advance of ours.

145
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,538
What?

146
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,602
I can't believe it.

147
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,774
I think you might
elaborate, Dr. Ruth.

148
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,682
In my study of the situation
I've come to the conclusion

149
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,084
That there is
a scanner underground

150
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,918
Developed in North America.

151
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,515
It has an organization
that's well-motivated,

152
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,651
and it has a leader.

153
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,853
Now, that's ridiculous, doctor.

154
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:34,365
You can't get 2 of them
to sit in the same room together
without going berserk.

155
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:39,063
You're making a very
provocative allegation, Dr. Ruth.

156
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,866
Who controls this group?

157
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,999
If you study the descriptions
in this report,

158
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,739
You will find that you
probably met him last night.

159
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,047
His name is Darryl Revok,

160
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,607
and he was on our list.

161
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,381
This is total fiction.
Mr. Trevellyan, I...

162
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,752
A moment, Mr. Keller.

163
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,791
What do you suggest, doctor?

164
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,160
Eliminate the competition.

165
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,855
How?

166
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,832
Contact a scanner who is as yet
unknown to the underground,

167
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,234
convert him to out cause
and then send him out

168
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,296
to infiltrate the underground.

169
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,569
Convert him, doctor? How?

170
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:21,204
They're all pathetic social misfits.
Unstable. Unreliable.

171
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,717
That is because their unique gifts
are not understood, Mr. Keller.

172
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,878
There is one point
about which there
is no doubt at all,

173
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,479
and that is that consec was attacked.

174
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,716
For our own peace of mind,

175
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,124
we have to retaliate in some way,

176
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:39,163
and I think
Dr. Ruth's suggestion

177
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,926
is a very interesting one.

178
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,391
Except that...

179
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:48,400
We don't have ant scanners left
to send into the field.

180
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,103
As a matter of fact,

181
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,235
I do have one,

182
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,475
still unaffiliated.

183
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,314
Very special one.

184
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,059
I don't suppose you speak much.

185
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,433
No.

186
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,894
It's not surprising.

187
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,699
With all those other
voices in your head
how can your hear
your own voice?

188
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:28,007
How can you develop
a self personality?

189
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,771
How do you feel?

190
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,350
I feel...

191
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,284
crystal clear.

192
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,248
How do you like...

193
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,384
clarity?

194
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,190
I'm not sure.

195
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,100
- I think I'm a bit afraid.
- Why?

196
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,069
I feel so exposed.

197
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,676
I can hear myself.

198
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,143
You hear your own voice?

199
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,271
- Yes.
- Good.

200
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,474
You called me a scanner.

201
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,941
What is that?

202
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,713
Freak of nature...

203
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,816
Born with a certain form of E.S.P.,

204
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,986
a derangement of the synapses

205
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,157
which we call telepathy.

206
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,532
Could be a disease, possibly,

207
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,162
or a result of radiation.

208
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,106
We don't really know why.

209
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,802
Who are you?

210
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,945
My name is Dr. Paul Ruth.

211
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,281
I'm a psychopharmacist by trade,

212
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,651
specializing in the phenomenon

213
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,519
of scanners.

214
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,297
The woman in the shopping mall.
What were you doing to her?

215
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,993
I wasn't doing anything to her.

216
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,728
It was her.

217
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,571
She was...

218
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,838
forcing me...

219
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,501
To what?

220
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,243
To think about her.

221
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,946
The 50 people that were in this room
they appeared to disturb you.

222
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,543
Why was that?

223
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,315
They talked too loud.

224
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,254
They talked, and they talked.

225
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:22,885
Really? I didn't see
their lips move, did you?

226
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,485
No, it was the other voices.

227
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,121
The ones without lips.

228
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,789
They were drowning me.

229
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,131
I couldn't stop them.

230
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,996
The injection I gave you, the needle.

231
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,042
What happened to the voices?

232
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,077
They stopped.

233
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:44,081
The drug is called ephemeral.

234
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,674
It's a scan suppressant.

235
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,845
It does nothing
when it's given
to ordinary human being.

236
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,946
when given to a scanner,

237
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:55,015
it prevents the flow of telepathy.

238
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,460
It stops the voices.

239
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,157
It can help you.

240
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,359
How do you know these things?

241
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,459
It's my profession.

242
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,487
This is Mr. Keller.

243
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,920
Will my car be ready this evening?

244
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,695
Tell us what you did, please, Darryl.

245
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,732
I drilled a hole in my head.

246
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,471
- Where?
- Kind of obvious, isn't it?

247
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,679
Right here.

248
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,014
Why did you do it, Darryl?
Why did you drill the hole?

249
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,982
Too much pressure.

250
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,548
Had to release some pressure.

251
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,524
You wanted to let the pressure out?

252
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,959
You wanted to let
something out of your head?

253
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:11,268
Maybe I'm so smart
I can't contain
the thoughts in my head.

254
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,634
You wanted to let something
out of your head?

255
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,673
What?

256
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:18,806
People.

257
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,203
There are people in my head.

258
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,976
Not enough room for Darryl.

259
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,109
You mean voices?

260
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,085
No. Whole people.

261
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,850
Arms, legs, hands.

262
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,289
What's that you've put
over the hole?

263
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,792
It's a door.

264
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,420
Put an eye on the door
so they won't know it's a door
and they can't get
back in

265
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,623
'cause this is the eye
you know?

266
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,894
Do you think
that will fool them?

267
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,167
Sure. Sure it will.

268
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,033
- I mean...
- I mean, sure it will, you know?

269
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,406
I mean, is that
the only way to...

270
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,001
No!

271
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,242
What do you know?

272
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,849
You don't know nothing
do you?

273
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,942
What's it like in there
eh, lady?

274
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,782
You want to see
how to get in?

275
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:05,821
OK?

276
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,079
Come with me, Darryl.

277
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,381
Get your hands off me.

278
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:36,977
Get your hands...

279
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,387
Get your hands off me!

280
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,482
Get your hands off me!

281
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,410
That's me, isn't it?

282
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,414
As you were...

283
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,508
Without ephemeral
without guidance.

284
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,950
Is he still like that?

285
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:13,683
Worse.

286
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,191
How could he be?

287
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,320
At the age of 22
he was extremely self-destructive.

288
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,920
Now, at the age of 35,

289
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,990
he is simply destructive.

290
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,969
In many ways, Cameron,

291
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,732
he is your enemy.

292
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,773
And mine.

293
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,141
But I don't even know him.

294
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,838
He...

295
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,172
knows you.

296
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,514
Somehow he was able
to gather a master list

297
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:46,352
of all the scanners
who were ever born.

298
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,619
He has sought them out
one by one,

299
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:52,356
asked them to join him
in an insane crusade

300
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,126
to destroy the society
that created him.

301
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,199
And me?

302
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,263
He was looking for you
but I found you first.

303
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:01,999
That's why
you can help me.

304
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,802
I don't understand.

305
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,842
All the scanners

306
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,401
who didn't agree to
join him were murdered.

307
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,348
These murders represent
a loss to mankind

308
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,612
of the most spectacular human beings

309
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,314
that ever walked
the face of this planet.

310
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,288
Now, you, Cameron,

311
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,517
and your brothers and sisters,

312
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,755
can bring a, a glory
and a brilliance

313
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:27,025
to our society that has
never been seen before.

314
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,632
We must stop Revok now.

315
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,677
Consec are not ready
to give up their program.

316
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,321
Paul Ruth came up
with a secret weapon.

317
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:27,585
What?

318
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,825
Someone you've been
looking for, I think.

319
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,419
A scanner.

320
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,761
Calls himself Cameron Vale.

321
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,159
I've seen him.

322
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,138
and Ruth knew exactly
where to find him.

323
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,673
He's in indoctrination right now.

324
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,347
Can he do anything?
What kind of shape is he in?

325
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,850
He seems to function...

326
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,145
But he's nothing to worry about.

327
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,221
He's weak.

328
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,748
Very weak.

329
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:09,026
Welcome to our
little psychic gymnasium.

330
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,926
Cameron Vale...

331
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,166
You'll please meet...

332
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:22,304
Yoga master Dieter Tautz.

333
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,344
Mr. Tautz has kindly consented

334
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:32,014
to be your psychic
sparring partner.

335
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:36,891
He has publicly demonstrated
on many occasions

336
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,861
that by the power of his will.

337
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,263
He can control his heart rate,

338
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,801
his alpha-wave rhythm,

339
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:49,738
and many other supposedly
uncontrollable functions
of the human body.

340
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,104
Are we ready?

341
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,301
Just about.

342
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,935
Proceed.

343
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:58,642
If you would be
kind enough to sit
facing this gentleman here.

344
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,445
I want you...

345
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,990
I want you to...

346
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,087
slowly release your scan.

347
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,860
Slowly, with focus.

348
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:21,435
I want it to touch his heart
but not his brain.

349
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,098
You understand?

350
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,707
Telepathy is not mind reading.

351
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,872
It is the direct linking

352
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,678
of 2 nervous systems

353
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,911
separated by space.

354
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,512
I want you to make a link...

355
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,190
from your brain...

356
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:45,556
to his heart.

357
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,231
I want your brain

358
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,199
to make his heart...

359
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,967
beat fast.

360
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:59,807
Now, if his heart
beats too quickly...

361
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,836
then he will take over
control of his heart...

362
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,647
and slow it down.

363
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,553
Don't worry about it.

364
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:13,146
All you have to do...

365
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,755
is make his heart...

366
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,885
beat...

367
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,451
fast.

368
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,496
Fast.

369
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,856
Fast.

370
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,200
Now.

371
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,270
Fast. Faster.

372
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,774
Fast.

373
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:34,977
Fast.

374
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,513
Fast!

375
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,581
Fast!

376
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,225
End your scan.

377
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,100
End it!

378
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,095
Stop!

379
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,036
Stop him!

380
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,699
End it!

381
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,200
End it!

382
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,061
You were right, Dr. Ruth.

383
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,563
It was easy.

384
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,803
This man's name is...

385
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,236
Benjamin Pierce.

386
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,831
And these photographs
were taken in a prison

387
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,811
for the criminally insane.

388
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,380
Here's another one.

389
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,476
This is a plaster cast of him

390
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,954
at present on display
at the acrostic art galley.

391
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,450
He's our only lead,

392
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,652
a known scanner

393
00:34:56,727 --> 00:35:00,993
who may or may not be part
of Revok's underground.

394
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,298
Why was he in prison?

395
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,802
He tried to kill his entire family.

396
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,634
His father, sister, mother...

397
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,241
At the age of 10.

398
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,439
It was in 1958.

399
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:20,041
A few years later, he was released.

400
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,275
What do they say here?

401
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,191
'Rehabilitation through art.'

402
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,852
The man has incredible power,

403
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,255
doesn't he?

404
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,758
Power?

405
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,820
Yes, he does.

406
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,797
I am Arno Crostic.

407
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,629
I'm pleased you came
to my gallery.

408
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,166
Are you an aficionado
of Benjamin Pierce?

409
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,073
I'm interested in buying this
piece for my apartment in Paris.

410
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,235
Yes?

411
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:24,441
But I don't think
it'll work out unless
I can get to meet the artist first.

412
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,951
I'm afraid no.

413
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,988
I hope it won't prejudice you
against acquiring this piece,

414
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:36,083
but I would lose
Benjamin Pierce for good

415
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,958
if I even approached him
with the idea.

416
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,227
You see, it's pair
of our agreement.

417
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,860
He will not meet
his public.

418
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,701
Maybe you could just
tell me where he lives.

419
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,264
Then I could approach him myself,

420
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,537
and you wouldn't be involved.

421
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,738
I'm afraid I can't.

422
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,750
Then maybe you could just...

423
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,182
think about...

424
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,277
where he lives.

425
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,049
Excuse me.

426
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,152
I'm suddenly...

427
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,693
feeling ill.

428
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,038
Arno, what's the matter?

429
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,007
- Are you all right?
- I will be all right.

430
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,014
Come on, Arno.
Let me take you back
to your office.

431
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,745
You've got to lie down.
That's it. Take me arm.

432
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,726
Benjamin Pierce?

433
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,323
Why don't you leave me alone?

434
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,302
I need some help.

435
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,904
You're the only one
that can give it to me.

436
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,745
Is that right?

437
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,683
Me?

438
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,277
Yes.

439
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,797
Then I think you're
in big trouble, chum.

440
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,514
I've heard you know a man
named Darry Revok.

441
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,588
Who are you?

442
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:15,336
I was told you were coming
to pay me a visit, Mr. Vale.

443
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,603
How did you know that?

444
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:21,908
Well...

445
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,586
I have friends.

446
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,016
I don't want them...

447
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,661
but I have them.

448
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,264
Scanner friends?

449
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,037
What do you mean by that?

450
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,237
I am one of you.

451
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,313
- You're one of me.
- Yes.

452
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,988
You know what I think?

453
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,962
I think you better tell me
what you really want.

454
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:19,342
It's the voices in my head.

455
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,708
They're driving me crazy.

456
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,713
How do you stop them?

457
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,510
Your voices.

458
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,549
My art.

459
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:38,622
My art keeps me sane.

460
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,055
My art.

461
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,027
Sane.

462
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,366
I don't have anything like this.

463
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,410
That's why I have
to find Darryl Revok.

464
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,343
You...

465
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,543
my friend...

466
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:05,183
are a liar.

467
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:08,523
Get out.

468
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,822
Look, I'm not leaving here

469
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:14,058
until you tell me
where I can find Darryl Revok.

470
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:16,865
No?

471
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:18,900
All right.

472
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,937
Well, then I'll get out.

473
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,967
No!

474
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,557
Find Revok.

475
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:27,722
Find Revok.

476
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,699
These are his robots...

477
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,258
killers.

478
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,203
He'll turn you
into a zombie,

479
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,705
a robot,

480
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:37,866
a killer.

481
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,808
No, don't you let him.

482
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:43,039
There are others.

483
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,842
Other scanners.

484
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,281
Kim Obrist.

485
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,717
Kim Obrist.

486
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,221
Kim Obrist.

487
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,934
Good evening, sir.
Can I help you?

488
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,745
Are there any messages for me?

489
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:18,076
Your name, sir?

490
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:19,513
Cameron Vale.

491
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,784
Your room number?

492
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,046
802.

493
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,988
Yes, this package is for you, sir.

494
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:24,635
My name is Cameron Vale.

495
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,108
I've got to talk to Kim Obrist.

496
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,111
Come on in.

497
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,218
Oh, God.

498
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,125
They killed Ben Pierce.

499
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,560
Yes.

500
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,896
Come on upstairs.

501
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,372
Just wait here a sec.

502
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:12,385
Kim, Revoc got to Ben Pierce.
He's dead.

503
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,424
This guy's name
is Cameron Vale.

504
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,486
I scanned him.
He's for real.

505
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,029
He was there when it happened.

506
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,529
Sit down.

507
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,618
I know you.

508
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,150
You were at the gallery.

509
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:48,317
You were looking for Pierce.

510
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,360
I need help.

511
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,539
Scan together.

512
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:41,168
Scan together
and our minds will begin
to flow into each other

513
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:43,644
until they become one.

514
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,012
One nervous system.

515
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,176
One soul.

516
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,743
One experience.

517
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,482
Beautiful.

518
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,853
Beautiful.

519
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,353
And frightening.

520
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,212
So frightening to lose yourself.

521
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:20,340
So frightening
to lose yourself.

522
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,749
To lose your will
to the group will.

523
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:24,844
To lose yourself
to the group self.

524
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:26,479
...to the group self.

525
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:36,862
No!

526
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,002
The power.

527
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:46,804
The power we can generate

528
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:50,745
we web focus our scans
together is fantastic.

529
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:51,644
Fantastic.

530
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,204
Terrifying.

531
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,876
Terrifying.
Exhilarating.

532
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,969
No! Around the side!
Quick!

533
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,635
Hurry!

534
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,377
Get in!

535
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:03,813
Let's go! Come on!

536
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:14,813
