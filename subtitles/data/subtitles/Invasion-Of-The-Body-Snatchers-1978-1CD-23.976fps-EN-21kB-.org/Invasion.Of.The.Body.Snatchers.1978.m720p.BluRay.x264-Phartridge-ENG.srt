1
00:04:51,677 --> 00:04:54,596
There's some more flowers, kids.
Go pick 'em.

2
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:56,765
Yeah!

3
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:02,646
That's a pretty one!

4
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:07,651
- I don't have one.
- Well, go look for one, over there.

5
00:05:08,527 --> 00:05:11,405
Oh, that's beautiful. Let me look at that.

6
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,573
Let me look at that!

7
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:19,121
Now you can take them home
to your parents. Don't they smell nice!

8
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:26,962
Hi.

9
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,763
Too much trouble to pick the mail up
off the floor, Geoffrey?

10
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:41,184
Hello?

11
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,773
Look at this flower.

12
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:54,573
All right! Attaway!

13
00:05:58,702 --> 00:06:01,872
You know, I think I actually
found something rare.

14
00:06:02,998 --> 00:06:04,374
What?

15
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:07,878
- This plant. I think it's a grex.
- A what?

16
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:11,882
G-R-E-X. That's when
two species cross-pollinate

17
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:14,885
and produce a third
completely unique one.

18
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,012
And listen to this:

19
00:06:17,137 --> 00:06:23,935
"Epilobic, from the Greek epi: upon,
and lobos: a pod".

20
00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:28,148
"Many of the species are dangerous
weeds and should be avoided".

21
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:29,524
Dangerous?

22
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:31,735
In the garden.

23
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,238
See? Look how quickly it roots.

24
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:38,867
"Their rapid and widespread growth
was even observed

25
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:41,787
in many of the war-torn cities of Europe".

26
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:45,916
"Indeed, some of these plants
may thrive on devastated ground".

27
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,753
Why don't we go up to Vail
for the weekend? Fly up Friday, hm?

28
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:51,797
OK, maybe. Sure.

29
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:55,217
Geoffrey! I'm trying to read!

30
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:56,968
You're in a good mood.

31
00:06:57,094 --> 00:07:00,555
Well, I got something
to look forward to tonight - playoffs.

32
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:02,599
Geoffrey.

33
00:07:02,724 --> 00:07:05,602
- What?
- I'm reading.

34
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:09,147
OK! I'll put the earphones on.
There, see? Happy?

35
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:11,692
Never mind. I'll go downstairs.

36
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:18,782
Comment? Qui est là?
Who is it?

37
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:20,951
Department of Health.

38
00:07:24,997 --> 00:07:28,083
Bonsoir, Monsieur Bennell.
How nice to see you.

39
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:51,648
What is that supposed to be?

40
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:54,526
It is cervelles en matelote.

41
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:57,696
In English, what would I be eating
if I ate that?

42
00:07:57,821 --> 00:08:01,992
- Ah. Calves' brains in red wine.
- Red wine and what else?

43
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:06,955
Mais, c'est impossible. It's impossible.
It's a secret, Mr Bennell.

44
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,209
You don't have any secrets
from the Department of Health, Henri.

45
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:14,463
A good young Burgundy, brown stock,

46
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:17,549
thyme, parsley - just a sprig.

47
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:21,928
Capers, a fresh bay leaf, and garlic.

48
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:25,390
- That's all?
- Oui. Yes.

49
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:36,735
- What is that?
- A caper.

50
00:08:37,986 --> 00:08:38,945
No.

51
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:41,740
Do you presume to tell us
what is in this stock?

52
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:44,576
- It's a rat turd.
- A what?

53
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:46,745
A rat turd.

54
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:49,289
- A caper!
- A rat turd.

55
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:51,833
A caper!

56
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:54,920
If it's a caper,

57
00:08:55,045 --> 00:08:57,089
eat it.

58
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:06,682
I'm gonna bring you up
for permit revocation, Henri.

59
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:11,228
You're charging way too much
to be serving crap like that in here.

60
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:15,482
But, Monsieur, it is an accident.
You know how careful we are.

61
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:11,330
Hello?

62
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:13,040
- Elizabeth?
- Yes.

63
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:14,833
- Wake you up?
- No. Hi, Matthew.

64
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,336
- They busted the window of my car.
- Oh, no!

65
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:20,672
Threw a bottle of wine at it -
not even good wine.

66
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,884
The Warriors won,
so I guess your household's happy.

67
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:25,427
Yes.

68
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:27,679
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

69
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:30,390
If you go to sleep now,
you can get up early.

70
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:31,808
Oh, Matthew...

71
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:36,146
If you can come in at 7.30,
you can run the tests before 8 o'clock.

72
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:40,400
Stop! Matthew... stop.
I'm not coming in before 8 o'clock

73
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:44,279
in the morning!
- I gotta force the abatement hearing.

74
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:47,574
- Wednesday's their only free slot.
- No, Matthew!

75
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:49,660
I will not be there before eight!

76
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:52,913
I nominated you for
Civil Servant ofthe Year award.

77
00:10:53,038 --> 00:10:55,082
It's true. I think you'll win.

78
00:10:55,207 --> 00:11:00,253
OK, OK, OK. I'll be in at 7.30.
I'll run a salmonella test for you.

79
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:02,464
Thank you. See you in the morning.

80
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:04,841
Good night. I'll see you in the morning.

81
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:07,094
- Bye.
- Bye.

82
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:41,480
Geoffrey, my God!
How long have you been up?

83
00:12:41,605 --> 00:12:43,649
Not long.

84
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,860
What are you doing?

85
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:49,821
Geoffrey?

86
00:14:47,522 --> 00:14:51,818
I wanna throw the book at him. Those
scallops are just cut-up pieces of skate.

87
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:54,655
I'm sorry. I can start the tests right away.

88
00:14:54,821 --> 00:14:57,658
It's OK...
And something's wrong with the potato.

89
00:14:57,824 --> 00:15:00,911
Either the sour cream is phoney,
or the chives.

90
00:15:01,036 --> 00:15:03,497
I'm sorry. I got up on time.
It was Geoffrey.

91
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:08,502
- What did the mad dentist do this time?
- I don't know. He was just weird.

92
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:11,171
He's crazy. All dentists are crazy.

93
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:14,174
- Are you late?
- No.

94
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:17,427
He was weird not the way he usually is.

95
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:20,013
That can only be an improvement.

96
00:15:22,432 --> 00:15:25,102
Well, it's not. It's got me really nervous.

97
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:27,270
Tell him to shape up or get out.

98
00:15:27,437 --> 00:15:30,482
- It's his house.
- Make him an offer.

99
00:15:30,607 --> 00:15:33,652
- Here's something that'll cheer you up.
- What?

100
00:15:33,777 --> 00:15:35,779
Ever seen one of these up close?

101
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:38,073
- What is it?
- What does it look like?

102
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:39,700
- A caper?
- A caper?

103
00:15:39,825 --> 00:15:40,993
What is it?

104
00:15:41,118 --> 00:15:44,204
- A rat turd, but the sauce was delicious.
- I got you a rat.

105
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:47,332
- Did you find one?
- I've got it. It was a biggie.

106
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:50,794
OK, we'll get a declaration
of "unsanitary" on him.

107
00:15:51,628 --> 00:15:53,630
- I'll talk to you later, OK?
- OK.

108
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:57,092
- What can I do?
- Nothing. Don't worry. Go on.

109
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:59,261
I'm sorry.

110
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,722
Oh, I'm sorry.

111
00:16:16,528 --> 00:16:21,074
- Hey, come on. Tell me what I've done.
- I understand today's plan.

112
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,661
Something's come up, Elizabeth.
I have to go back out again.

113
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:26,830
Now? Weren't we going to the game?

114
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:29,291
The Warriors.
I gave the tickets to a patient.

115
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,835
You're not gonna see tonight's game?

116
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,462
No choice.

117
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:36,298
Geoffrey, what is the matter with you?

118
00:16:36,423 --> 00:16:38,925
I'm fine. I just have to go to a meeting.

119
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:41,261
Meeting? What kind of a meeting?

120
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:45,432
Elizabeth, I don't think
I have to justify my every move to you.

121
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:48,352
Geoffrey, this isn't like you.

122
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:52,147
Please, come on. I just want it to be nice...

123
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:56,234
Elizabeth, what's the matter with you?

124
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:58,445
Nothing.

125
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:35,691
Come in!

126
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,485
Hi.

127
00:17:39,152 --> 00:17:41,196
How you doing?

128
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:53,458
Is it true that if you think
you're losing your mind, you're not?

129
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:58,296
Well, I hope so.

130
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:02,676
I know this is gonna sound insane.

131
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:04,428
What?

132
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:09,266
Geoffrey is not Geoffrey.

133
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:12,811
- How do you know?
- I know.

134
00:18:13,937 --> 00:18:17,024
On the outside Geoffrey is still Geoffrey,

135
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:20,444
but on the inside
I can tell there is something different.

136
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,362
Something is missing.

137
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:25,574
- What?
- Emotion, feelings.

138
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:27,909
He's just not the same person.

139
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,458
Really, you know what I mean?
I know it sounds crazy.

140
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:38,128
Yeah. I know what you mean, I think.
Have you eaten?

141
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:40,464
- I'm not hungry.
- Have some celery.

142
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,507
- I'm not...
- Eat, eat, eat.

143
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:47,929
We can eat outside. It's a beautiful night.

144
00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:52,476
Take that meat there, will you?
Chop it up.

145
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:55,854
And hand me the ginger,
the stuff that's chopped up there.

146
00:19:05,697 --> 00:19:09,368
You wanna know something else?
This is really weird.

147
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:15,957
I went to see his sister Nora
to talk to her about it.

148
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,670
But I couldn't. I stopped myself.

149
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:21,630
She changed, too?

150
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:24,591
- Do you think I'm crazy?
- No.

151
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:28,929
D'you wanna go see
my friend David Kibner?

152
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:32,474
- The psychiatrist?
- Not like that.

153
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:35,268
Talk to him. He would
put things into perspective.

154
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,231
- I'm not crazy.
- No, no, no. I'm serious.

155
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:44,403
He would eliminate whether Geoffrey
was having an affair, or had become gay.

156
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:49,408
Whether he had a social disease,
or had become a Republican.

157
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:53,829
All the things that could have happened
to have made you feel he had changed.

158
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:56,915
D'you know what I mean?
You wanna go see him?

159
00:19:59,126 --> 00:20:00,961
You think I'm nuts.

160
00:20:02,129 --> 00:20:04,923
No, I don't.
Can you still do the thing with your eyes?

161
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:10,053
If you're not crazy,
you can do that thing with your eyes.

162
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:21,273
You're not crazy.

163
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:23,400
This is delicious.

164
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:25,444
You're a great cook.

165
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:27,863
What time is Geoffrey getting back?

166
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:31,533
He said not to wait up for him.

167
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:34,995
D'you want some more wine?

168
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,442
- Morning!
- Hello.

169
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:09,821
One, two... Mrs Teng,
this one's got a coffee stain on it.

170
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:12,866
Here.

171
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:16,787
- That's not coffee.
- That is coffee. I put it there myself.

172
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:21,041
Maybe not come out.

173
00:21:23,085 --> 00:21:24,920
You doctor, right?

174
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:27,798
Me? No. Health Department. Civil servant.

175
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:32,886
Do you need a doctor?

176
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:35,138
My wife... sick.

177
00:21:35,263 --> 00:21:39,059
- What's wrong with her?
- She wrong.

178
00:21:40,185 --> 00:21:43,480
- She's not right?
- That not my wife.

179
00:21:43,814 --> 00:21:45,857
You mean, she's...?

180
00:21:46,316 --> 00:21:48,360
No, no. Different.

181
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:54,825
That not my wife!

182
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:25,230
How you doin', Harry?

183
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:27,441
Hey, pooch. How you doin', boy?

184
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:16,281
Where you been? You've been driving me
crazy. I've been looking all over for you.

185
00:23:16,406 --> 00:23:17,949
What's the matter with you?

186
00:23:18,742 --> 00:23:20,744
You all right?

187
00:23:25,415 --> 00:23:27,459
Talk to me, Elizabeth.

188
00:24:01,493 --> 00:24:03,704
I keep seeing these people

189
00:24:04,454 --> 00:24:06,498
all recognising each other.

190
00:24:06,665 --> 00:24:09,209
Something was passing between them all.

191
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:11,378
Some secret.

192
00:24:14,881 --> 00:24:16,925
It's a conspiracy. I know it.

193
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:19,720
There can't be a conspiracy.

194
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,015
Matthew, I'm telling you,
something's going on here.

195
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,183
Something that scares me.

196
00:24:25,308 --> 00:24:27,853
I tried to see Geoffrey today,
to talk to him.

197
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:30,647
He's always in his office in the morning.

198
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,024
It really was weird.

199
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:16,818
Geoffrey was meeting
all sorts ofstrange people.

200
00:25:16,985 --> 00:25:19,154
Things were being passed between them.

201
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,199
- None were people you knew?
- I didn't know any of them.

202
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:24,868
Maybe they were patients of Geoffrey's.

203
00:25:24,993 --> 00:25:27,913
Oh, no, no, Matthew. I know they weren't.

204
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:30,957
I followed him
from one end oftown to the other,

205
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:35,504
and everywhere he went he had
these meetings with strange people.

206
00:25:47,224 --> 00:25:50,227
I felt so stupid
sneaking around spying on him,

207
00:25:50,352 --> 00:25:53,230
but I can't talk to him. What can I do?

208
00:25:56,692 --> 00:26:00,362
OK. Well, Kibner will be able
to explain something.

209
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:02,614
I don't need a psychiatrist.

210
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:05,158
Just forget that he's a psychiatrist.

211
00:26:05,283 --> 00:26:08,495
Just think of him as an intelligent man,
which is what he is.

212
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,249
It's a book party. He's a celebrity.
He's very famous.

213
00:26:12,374 --> 00:26:15,711
And you will like him,
if you forget that he's a psychiatrist.

214
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:18,755
I don't know... I don't know.

215
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,717
Matthew, I've lived in this city all my life,

216
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:25,429
but somehow today
I felt everything had changed.

217
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:28,765
People were different.
Notjust Geoffrey, but everybody.

218
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,893
Yesterday it all seemed normal.

219
00:26:32,686 --> 00:26:35,522
Today everything seemed the same,
but it wasn't.

220
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:37,691
It was a nightmare.

221
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,610
It really became frightening.

222
00:26:42,571 --> 00:26:45,866
It was like the whole city
had changed overnight.

223
00:26:59,212 --> 00:27:02,883
Did I ever tell you the one
about the English Camel Corps? Did l?

224
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:07,387
They're trapped in the desert,
in the Sahara desert.

225
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:12,934
They've been surrounded by Rommel
for 40 days and they've run out of food.

226
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:17,439
And the captain comes
and makes an announcement to the men.

227
00:27:17,564 --> 00:27:19,191
He says,

228
00:27:19,316 --> 00:27:24,071
"Men, I have some good news
and some bad news for you".

229
00:27:24,363 --> 00:27:27,032
- One of the men says...
- Wait. You have told me this.

230
00:27:31,161 --> 00:27:33,413
Can I tell it to you again?

231
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:35,540
Look out!

232
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,292
Oh, my God! Lock the door!

233
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:39,503
- They're coming!
- We should help.

234
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:42,673
Help! Help! They're coming.
They're coming. Listen!

235
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:45,384
- He's smashed out of his skull.
- He's terrified.

236
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:48,804
You're next. Please! Please!
You're next. We're in danger!

237
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:50,847
Listen to me... Something terrible!

238
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:54,184
Please. You're next!
Here they are. They're already here!

239
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:55,811
Help! You're next!

240
00:27:55,936 --> 00:27:59,898
- They're coming. They're coming...
- He must have done something.

241
00:28:04,945 --> 00:28:07,447
The policeman'll help.

242
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:36,560
Oh, my God.

243
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,688
That poor man.
What was he talking about?

244
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:43,233
I'll phone a witness report in
from the bookstore.

245
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:47,779
Matthew, thank God you're here!
These people are driving me nuts.

246
00:28:47,904 --> 00:28:49,990
- Are we gonna have dinner?
- No, I can't.

247
00:28:50,115 --> 00:28:52,200
- Is there a phone?
- Around the corner.

248
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:56,079
- Elizabeth Driscoll, Jack Bellicec.
- This is the Elizabeth?

249
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:58,498
The book is awful. Kibner's book is awful.

250
00:28:58,665 --> 00:29:01,293
His ideas are garbage. Pure garbage.

251
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:04,212
How can you say that
about a man like Kibner?

252
00:29:04,338 --> 00:29:07,090
Not a man like Kibner.
I'm saying it about Kibner.

253
00:29:07,215 --> 00:29:11,428
He dashes a book off every six months.
Takes me six months to write one line.

254
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:14,348
- Why?
- Cos I pick each word individually.

255
00:29:14,473 --> 00:29:18,018
- What's so hot about that?
- I wasn't even talking to you, was l?

256
00:29:18,143 --> 00:29:20,604
On the corner of Leavenworth and...

257
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:22,731
- Turk.
- Turk? Turk.

258
00:29:23,148 --> 00:29:25,150
Is that him?

259
00:29:26,193 --> 00:29:27,611
Yes.

260
00:29:28,236 --> 00:29:29,237
Yes!

261
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:34,534
"What's so hot about that?
What's so hot about that?" I don't know...

262
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,413
You must have a report on it
cos there was a motorcycle officer there

263
00:29:38,538 --> 00:29:40,916
and an ambulance on the way.
- They follow me.

264
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:44,586
- They don't understand me.
- You don't have to prove yourself to them.

265
00:29:44,753 --> 00:29:47,297
- That's easy for you to say.
- Of course I saw it.

266
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:51,134
- The man was running down the street.
- It's romantic, sentimental,

267
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:54,221
- He landed on my car.
- post-industrial nonsense.

268
00:29:54,346 --> 00:29:56,807
Just a second. I'm talking to the police.

269
00:29:56,973 --> 00:30:00,352
- No, he was bleeding on the road.
- What seems to be the trouble?

270
00:30:00,477 --> 00:30:01,645
Hello? Yeah.

271
00:30:01,812 --> 00:30:03,939
Don't ever give your name to cops.

272
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:06,608
Leavenworth and Turk. I'll hold.

273
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:08,860
But he isn't my husband!

274
00:30:08,986 --> 00:30:11,655
It's someone who looks like him.
He's an impostor!

275
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,575
Now, Katherine, he's your husband.
You know him and I know him.

276
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:20,455
I had to wait until today cos he has
a scar on the back of his neck

277
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,041
and when his hair is long
you can't see it.

278
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:26,670
- He went to have a haircut today...
- And the scar was gone.

279
00:30:27,546 --> 00:30:29,715
No! It's still there!

280
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,343
Of course it's still there.
What did you expect? He's still Ted.

281
00:30:33,427 --> 00:30:37,681
- Excuse me, can I say one thing?
- Please! He's still your husband Ted.

282
00:30:37,806 --> 00:30:39,808
- I know something...
- Katherine?

283
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:41,768
- Could I say one thing?
- Katherine!

284
00:30:41,893 --> 00:30:43,270
Just a minute.

285
00:30:43,395 --> 00:30:45,689
- Katherine.
- Just give me a minute, will you?

286
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:48,025
Will you trust me?

287
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:51,320
Will you please trust me? Will you?

288
00:30:51,445 --> 00:30:54,698
I work for the county.
This is a public-spirited gesture.

289
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:58,327
- I will give you my name...
- Kibner wants people to fit the world.

290
00:30:58,452 --> 00:31:01,204
- I wanna report this.
- I want the world to fit people.

291
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,666
- We'll talk about this later.
- Where's Homer? Or Kazantzakis?

292
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:07,419
- Where's Jack London?
- Where's Elizabeth?

293
00:31:07,544 --> 00:31:10,797
- I'm afraid!
- I understand, I know.

294
00:31:10,922 --> 00:31:13,091
I understand. Let me have your hand.

295
00:31:13,216 --> 00:31:15,927
- Katherine, just trust me.
- Isn't he wonderful?

296
00:31:16,053 --> 00:31:17,929
Come on.

297
00:31:18,055 --> 00:31:21,892
There. That's not so bad, is it?
Who's this behind me?

298
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:24,353
- It's Ted.
- That's right.

299
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,438
Hold on. Come on, just hold on.

300
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:30,442
Hold on. Just relax now.

301
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:33,487
- You gonna be all right? You feel better?
- Yeah. Yes.

302
00:31:33,612 --> 00:31:35,572
- You wanna go home now?
- Yes.

303
00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:38,659
- Will you come and see me tomorrow?
- Please... tomorrow.

304
00:31:38,825 --> 00:31:41,495
Tomorrow we'll all talk.
OK? The three of us?

305
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,622
OK, but I better take her home.

306
00:31:43,747 --> 00:31:45,791
Yes. It's OK.

307
00:31:45,957 --> 00:31:48,001
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- OK.

308
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,504
- All right?
- OK.

309
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:57,636
Thank you.

310
00:31:57,761 --> 00:32:00,055
They don't wanna hear
about the accident.

311
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:02,015
It's a big conspiracy.

312
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:04,393
- What's a conspiracy?
- Everything.

313
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:07,854
Excuse me.

314
00:32:12,192 --> 00:32:14,653
I understand what you're trying to say.

315
00:32:14,778 --> 00:32:18,573
My name is Elizabeth Driscoll,
the Public Health Department. Call me.

316
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:20,742
Katherine! Come on, Katherine.

317
00:32:23,078 --> 00:32:25,455
That woman's husband
is not her husband.

318
00:32:25,622 --> 00:32:29,209
I saw him with Geoffrey. He's one of them.
She knows about it

319
00:32:29,334 --> 00:32:32,337
- and nobody's helping her.
- No. Somebody's helping her.

320
00:32:32,462 --> 00:32:34,631
I'm glad you heard that. David, Elizabeth.

321
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:36,967
I've heard it all week. It's popular.

322
00:32:37,092 --> 00:32:39,386
- What is?
- I was trying to tell you

323
00:32:39,511 --> 00:32:42,347
- that I also know somebody...
- Who's changed.

324
00:32:42,556 --> 00:32:45,225
- Yes.
- Can we go outside and talk about it?

325
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:52,190
Listen, there's a lady up top - red hair,
blue dress. She's interested in your work.

326
00:32:57,112 --> 00:33:00,907
I've heard the same damn story
this week from six patients.

327
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:03,618
People are changing,
becoming less human.

328
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,787
It's happening all around us.

329
00:33:05,912 --> 00:33:08,123
That's not what we're talking about.

330
00:33:08,248 --> 00:33:10,834
This has nothing to do with
the man I live with.

331
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:13,587
It has everything to do with it.
Don't you see?

332
00:33:13,712 --> 00:33:18,884
People step in and out of relationships
because they don't want responsibility.

333
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:22,929
That's why marriages are going to hell.
The family unit is shot to hell.

334
00:33:23,055 --> 00:33:26,058
- David, you're not listening to her.
- Stay out of this!

335
00:33:26,183 --> 00:33:28,185
You see, that's the point.

336
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,896
I'm listening,
but he doesn't think I am. Why?

337
00:33:31,021 --> 00:33:34,691
Because he doesn't expect me
to bother enough, or to care.

338
00:33:34,858 --> 00:33:37,694
- Bellicec, for the last time, stop!
- Stop what?!

339
00:33:37,778 --> 00:33:40,572
- Stand still, be quiet, and shut up!
- Jack!

340
00:33:40,697 --> 00:33:42,074
How did you feel about that?

341
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:43,742
Why in the store? He's a nut.

342
00:33:43,867 --> 00:33:45,118
How did you feel?

343
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:47,913
You were probably shocked.

344
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,582
You wanted to shut your feelings off,

345
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:55,837
maybe make believe it wasn't happening
cos then you don't have to deal with it.

346
00:33:57,381 --> 00:34:00,050
I wanna deal with that woman
in the bookstore.

347
00:34:00,175 --> 00:34:02,219
Why?

348
00:34:02,803 --> 00:34:04,846
Do you identify with her?

349
00:34:06,598 --> 00:34:08,225
Yes.

350
00:34:08,642 --> 00:34:10,060
OK.

351
00:34:10,435 --> 00:34:12,062
Come on.

352
00:34:12,187 --> 00:34:16,900
Suppose I were to tell you that Katherine
is trying to escape from a relationship.

353
00:34:17,025 --> 00:34:19,903
- He's treating her.
- So why'd he push me against a wall?

354
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:21,863
- She's upset.
- She looks fine.

355
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:24,658
- She is upset, Jack.
- You look upset to me now.

356
00:34:24,825 --> 00:34:28,328
Do me a favour, will ya?
Go home and I'll call you later.

357
00:34:28,453 --> 00:34:31,039
- Go home and leave us alone for a bit.
- Go home?

358
00:34:31,164 --> 00:34:33,208
- OK?
- OK. OK.

359
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:35,168
Thank you.

360
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:41,299
You're jumping to a bizarre conclusion.

361
00:34:41,425 --> 00:34:44,845
That this man you live with
has been replaced by somebody else.

362
00:34:44,928 --> 00:34:48,015
Isn't it more likely
you want to believe he's changed

363
00:34:48,181 --> 00:34:51,935
because you're really looking
for an excuse to get out?

364
00:35:02,821 --> 00:35:04,281
I don't know.

365
00:35:04,448 --> 00:35:06,533
Will you think about it, please,

366
00:35:06,658 --> 00:35:08,702
before you make a move?

367
00:35:08,827 --> 00:35:12,497
Before you jump and
destroy something you have. Will you?

368
00:35:13,623 --> 00:35:15,667
Please?

369
00:35:20,213 --> 00:35:22,257
Yeah.

370
00:35:28,805 --> 00:35:30,432
Thank you.

371
00:35:30,557 --> 00:35:33,727
I just gave her
a psychological Band-Aid, Matthew.

372
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,812
I should talk to her some more.

373
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:38,982
You could bring her by my office
tomorrow around four.

374
00:35:39,149 --> 00:35:41,026
What's the matter with her?

375
00:35:41,193 --> 00:35:44,905
It's like there's some kind of
hallucinatory flu going around.

376
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:48,825
People get over it in a day or two.
All I can do is treat the symptoms.

377
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,911
She's gonna be OK?

378
00:35:51,078 --> 00:35:53,372
A good night's sleep wouldn't hurt.

379
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:55,791
- Is it contagious?
- Oh, Matthew!

380
00:35:56,875 --> 00:36:00,712
- Take her home to her boyfriend.
- That wasn't what I was thinking.

381
00:36:00,837 --> 00:36:04,257
I was just wondering
if the Health Department should look at it.

382
00:36:04,383 --> 00:36:06,385
Who knows? I don't know.

383
00:36:07,094 --> 00:36:09,137
I wish I did.

384
00:36:10,097 --> 00:36:11,556
OK.

385
00:36:13,016 --> 00:36:15,060
Take her home, Matthew.

386
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:41,086
Ah, Jack. How was the book party?

387
00:36:43,046 --> 00:36:45,090
Is that Kibner's new book?

388
00:36:48,802 --> 00:36:50,846
Didn't get to read your poetry?

389
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,182
I'm sorry, Jack.

390
00:36:54,558 --> 00:36:56,601
Good evening. Bellicec Baths.

391
00:36:58,437 --> 00:37:02,858
Yes, we recommend the 1 5-minute soak
in Calistoga volcanic ash,

392
00:37:02,983 --> 00:37:06,278
that's followed by
an Aqua-Surge whirlpool dip.

393
00:37:23,045 --> 00:37:25,088
Hey, can you help me outta here?

394
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:29,134
Bellicec!

395
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:31,345
I'm talking to you. Give me a hand.

396
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,513
Help me outta this thing.

397
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,434
Stan...

398
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:39,561
Every week we go through this.

399
00:37:39,686 --> 00:37:43,649
- Why can't you be more cooperative?
- Get me a towel.

400
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:46,401
You are really gonna get hurt
one of these days.

401
00:37:46,526 --> 00:37:48,654
Give me another towel, would you?

402
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:50,614
Come on.

403
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:05,629
Nancy, shut the music off.

404
00:38:05,796 --> 00:38:07,881
It's for the plants, Stan.

405
00:38:08,006 --> 00:38:11,218
Screw the plants. I hate the music.

406
00:38:11,343 --> 00:38:14,429
It's wonderful for my plants.
They just love it.

407
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:18,600
Plants have feelings, you know,
just like people.

408
00:38:18,725 --> 00:38:23,105
It's fascinating. This type of music
stimulates the growth of the plants.

409
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,440
They've done tons of experiments on it.

410
00:38:25,565 --> 00:38:28,402
- Come on, Nancy. Turn the music off.
- Relax.

411
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:31,071
You're not gonna enjoy this if you don't.

412
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:04,896
Oh! Mr Gianni, what are you doing here?

413
00:39:05,022 --> 00:39:07,357
This is must reading, Mrs Bellicec.

414
00:39:07,482 --> 00:39:09,735
Worlds ln Collision by Velikovsky.

415
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:13,322
Oh, yes. I've read that many times.
Have you read Star Maker

416
00:39:13,447 --> 00:39:17,034
by Olaf Stapledon?
That's must reading, too.

417
00:39:18,368 --> 00:39:22,581
- Well, it's awfully late, Mr Gianni.
- You're so smart.

418
00:39:22,706 --> 00:39:25,876
Oh, Mr Gianni,
you've been sitting in that mud too long.

419
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:28,420
It is possible to overdo it, you know.

420
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:33,008
Oh, by the way, thank you for that plant
you gave me last time.

421
00:40:04,081 --> 00:40:06,124
I'll walk you inside.

422
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,294
You don't have to.

423
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,096
Geoffrey?

424
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:24,643
That was sweet of him.

425
00:40:43,203 --> 00:40:45,247
You all right?

426
00:40:46,164 --> 00:40:48,208
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

427
00:40:53,922 --> 00:40:57,426
Thank you, Matthew.
You've really made me feel better.

428
00:40:57,592 --> 00:41:00,012
And I'm gonna think about
what Kibner said.

429
00:41:00,137 --> 00:41:01,138
OK.

430
00:41:01,263 --> 00:41:03,181
Thanks for helping. Goodnight.

431
00:41:03,306 --> 00:41:05,350
See you.

432
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:13,817
Jack?

433
00:41:14,234 --> 00:41:16,278
Honey, where are ya?

434
00:41:17,487 --> 00:41:21,533
I don't wanna disturb you if you're
thinking, but I could do with some food.

435
00:41:21,658 --> 00:41:24,328
I haven't eaten all day. Oh...

436
00:41:27,456 --> 00:41:29,666
Oh, Jack, you're gonna suffocate.

437
00:41:35,047 --> 00:41:36,590
My nose...

438
00:41:38,717 --> 00:41:40,761
Let me out! Let me out!

439
00:41:40,886 --> 00:41:42,637
My nose is bleeding.

440
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:08,330
Who is it?

441
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:11,333
Who is it?

442
00:42:14,503 --> 00:42:16,546
It's Matthew.

443
00:42:16,672 --> 00:42:19,049
- Come on in.
- What happened?

444
00:42:19,174 --> 00:42:20,842
Back here.

445
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:23,679
- Matthew, I called you here as a friend.
- Oh, Jack...

446
00:42:23,804 --> 00:42:28,600
Do you report things like contagious
disease or a body in a place of business?

447
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:30,811
- Let him look at it.
- You found a body?

448
00:42:30,936 --> 00:42:33,647
- No, not necessarily.
- I thought it was Jack.

449
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:36,274
Is that him?

450
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,443
Yeah, under there.

451
00:42:41,154 --> 00:42:43,740
- What kind of joke is this?
- It's no joke.

452
00:42:44,366 --> 00:42:46,410
What is it?

453
00:42:54,751 --> 00:42:58,255
- What the hell is it?!
- Just keep calm, Nancy.

454
00:42:59,756 --> 00:43:01,758
Is it contagious?

455
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:04,302
- Did any of your customers see this?
- No.

456
00:43:04,428 --> 00:43:05,804
It'd ruin us.

457
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:08,015
- I'm calling the police.
- Don't do that.

458
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:09,558
- Why?
- Nancy, don't.

459
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,644
Because I think Jack is right.

460
00:43:13,353 --> 00:43:15,564
It's not immature exactly.

461
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:17,441
He's got an adult face.

462
00:43:17,566 --> 00:43:21,486
- It's a monster. It's got hair all over it.
- It's vague.

463
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,864
Nose, lips, hair.

464
00:43:23,989 --> 00:43:27,743
Hands, everything,
but no detail, no character. It's unformed.

465
00:43:27,868 --> 00:43:31,204
Jack, don't touch it.
You don't know where it's been.

466
00:43:32,581 --> 00:43:34,624
No respiration.

467
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,877
It's got no fingerprints.

468
00:43:37,294 --> 00:43:39,338
No fingerprints?

469
00:43:41,214 --> 00:43:43,258
Like a foetus.

470
00:43:43,383 --> 00:43:45,427
You just said it was an adult.

471
00:43:45,552 --> 00:43:48,263
I said it was an adult because it was tall.

472
00:43:48,388 --> 00:43:52,142
- How tall are you, Jack?
- Six foot four.

473
00:43:52,267 --> 00:43:55,479
- How much do you weigh?
- 170.

474
00:43:55,604 --> 00:43:57,939
- Why?
- Oh, no.

475
00:43:59,566 --> 00:44:01,026
No, Matthew.

476
00:44:02,277 --> 00:44:04,071
Oh, Jack!

477
00:44:04,237 --> 00:44:06,865
- Who are you calling?
- Elizabeth.

478
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,992
Why?

479
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:11,411
Why are you calling Elizabeth?

480
00:44:11,536 --> 00:44:13,997
- Matthew...
- Why?

481
00:44:25,342 --> 00:44:26,468
Hello?

482
00:44:26,635 --> 00:44:30,514
Elizabeth? Can you hear me?
It's Matthew, Elizabeth. Hello?

483
00:44:31,181 --> 00:44:32,391
What's the matter?

484
00:44:32,516 --> 00:44:34,976
Elizabeth, can you hear me?

485
00:44:35,102 --> 00:44:36,937
Who is this?

486
00:44:38,313 --> 00:44:40,357
Hello?

487
00:45:00,794 --> 00:45:04,131
- Where are you going?
- A friend of mine is in trouble.

488
00:45:04,297 --> 00:45:06,800
- What are we to do?
- Phone David Kibner.

489
00:45:06,925 --> 00:45:10,637
Ask him to meet me here right away.
There's his number.

490
00:45:10,762 --> 00:45:12,806
- What's the matter?
- I'm tired.

491
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:15,600
Stand up.

492
00:45:15,726 --> 00:45:19,354
- Stand up! Now walk around!
- Honey, I'm dry! I'm very dry.

493
00:45:19,521 --> 00:45:22,274
I'll get you a drink. Just don't fall asleep.

494
00:45:31,908 --> 00:45:33,535
- Here, sweetie.
- Thanks, sweetie.

495
00:45:33,618 --> 00:45:35,662
Dr Kibner will be here soon.

496
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:42,127
I'm gonna lie down and think, honey.

497
00:45:42,586 --> 00:45:44,629
I'm just gonna think.

498
00:46:33,929 --> 00:46:36,014
Jack, wake up! lts eyes!

499
00:46:36,139 --> 00:46:38,975
Oh, Jack. It opened its eyes.

500
00:46:50,904 --> 00:46:51,863
See?

501
00:46:55,075 --> 00:46:56,076
Hon?

502
00:50:35,712 --> 00:50:37,089
Wake up.

503
00:50:37,255 --> 00:50:38,674
Wake up!

504
00:52:45,759 --> 00:52:49,179
I can't find anything in here
that looks like a body.

505
00:52:49,346 --> 00:52:51,181
- No body?
- What!

506
00:52:51,306 --> 00:52:54,142
- Did you check the last...
- I looked everywhere.

507
00:52:54,267 --> 00:52:55,602
Hey! Did you... Hey!

508
00:52:55,769 --> 00:52:59,523
- Did you check the last booth on the left?
- There's no body there.

509
00:52:59,648 --> 00:53:01,692
It's got to be in here!

510
00:53:04,361 --> 00:53:07,781
- Did it have a pulse, a heartbeat?
- It opened its eyes.

511
00:53:07,948 --> 00:53:11,410
- You actually saw that?
- I saw its nose bleed.

512
00:53:11,785 --> 00:53:14,705
It had white hair, that touched my hand.

513
00:53:15,247 --> 00:53:17,290
There's something in here.

514
00:53:20,043 --> 00:53:23,463
Nancy lost an old guy in here once.
He had a heart attack and sank.

515
00:53:28,093 --> 00:53:29,803
Face it, Bellicec.

516
00:53:29,928 --> 00:53:32,848
You've got some friends
who enjoy practical jokes.

517
00:53:32,973 --> 00:53:35,225
I don't have any friends, Dr Kibner.

518
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:38,353
Then some enemies.

519
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,813
Look.

520
00:53:43,692 --> 00:53:45,736
Who opened this up?

521
00:54:10,594 --> 00:54:13,013
Wait a second, wait a second.
Who is it?

522
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:18,769
- Matthew, the body's gone.
- Somebody's took it.

523
00:54:18,894 --> 00:54:22,064
- No. Did you see it?
- There was nothing here to see.

524
00:54:22,856 --> 00:54:25,025
Who are you waking up now, Matthew?

525
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:28,487
Police? I would like to report a body.

526
00:54:30,989 --> 00:54:32,991
Take her to my place fast.

527
00:54:33,116 --> 00:54:35,994
Don't let anybody in
until we get back there.

528
00:55:06,149 --> 00:55:08,652
Lieutenant, these fellas reported the body.

529
00:55:08,777 --> 00:55:12,030
- You both saw it?
- No, I'm the only one. Matthew Bennell.

530
00:55:12,197 --> 00:55:16,326
- Mr Bennell, show me where you saw it.
- It's right up here.

531
00:55:16,576 --> 00:55:18,620
Where's Elizabeth?

532
00:55:32,801 --> 00:55:34,177
- Where?
- There.

533
00:55:34,344 --> 00:55:36,471
- It's Elizabeth's double.
- Where?

534
00:55:36,638 --> 00:55:38,598
Lots of leaves and a pot.

535
00:55:38,724 --> 00:55:42,144
It was there, David.
I swear to God it was there!

536
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:45,105
Officer, there was a duplicate
of Elizabeth Driscoll,

537
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:47,441
- and it's been taken.
- The missing woman?

538
00:55:47,607 --> 00:55:49,484
- She's not missing.
- Where is she?

539
00:55:49,609 --> 00:55:52,029
- She's at Matthew's.
- Don't tell him that!

540
00:55:52,154 --> 00:55:54,698
- Then there is no missing body.
- That's right.

541
00:55:54,823 --> 00:55:57,492
- There is and he's taken it!
- No, he took Elizabeth.

542
00:55:57,617 --> 00:55:59,369
- You took Elizabeth away?
- Yes!

543
00:55:59,494 --> 00:56:02,539
- You broke in here.
- I had to because she was not safe here.

544
00:56:02,664 --> 00:56:04,166
So you took her out of here.

545
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:08,295
No! I took her from there.
Her other body was in here...

546
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:11,048
Please stop.
Matthew, that's enough! Please stop!

547
00:56:11,214 --> 00:56:14,343
- Lieutenant, I'm Dr David Kibner.
- Ah, the psychiatrist.

548
00:56:14,468 --> 00:56:16,094
My wife reads your books.

549
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:18,805
- I'm glad. It sounds complicated,
- David...

550
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:22,893
..but my friend has had some difficult
emotional experiences recently.

551
00:56:23,018 --> 00:56:27,105
But I think this is something
we can work out amongst ourselves.

552
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:30,942
- All right, I'll leave this part of it with you.
- I appreciate it.

553
00:56:31,068 --> 00:56:34,237
You can't accomplish anything here.
We gotta get outside.

554
00:56:36,156 --> 00:56:41,286
I think you might wanna consider filing
an unlawful entry against Mr Bennell.

555
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:43,705
I know what you're saying, but outside...

556
00:56:43,872 --> 00:56:48,210
No, I'll take Dr Kibner's word
that Elizabeth is all right.

557
00:56:48,919 --> 00:56:51,380
- Fine, then let's go.
- OK.

558
00:56:55,509 --> 00:56:57,552
Will Elizabeth be coming home?

559
00:56:59,096 --> 00:57:00,097
No.

560
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:03,934
I have to pick up some of her clothes.

561
00:57:07,479 --> 00:57:08,230
All right.

562
00:57:37,259 --> 00:57:40,303
All right, let's back up
and go through it once more,

563
00:57:40,429 --> 00:57:42,681
step by step.

564
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:47,602
You all thought you saw a body
at the baths.

565
00:57:47,769 --> 00:57:51,064
You thought it was dead.
You didn't know what it was.

566
00:57:53,317 --> 00:57:56,320
You touched it. All of you touched it.

567
00:57:59,573 --> 00:58:03,869
- Nancy, you saw it open its eyes.
- It looked right at me.

568
00:58:05,871 --> 00:58:09,708
- And, Bellicec, you saw its eyes open.
- No, I saw its nose bleed.

569
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:13,128
If you saw its nose bleed,
and Nancy saw its eyes open,

570
00:58:13,253 --> 00:58:15,088
he must have been alive.

571
00:58:17,632 --> 00:58:21,261
No, David. You're looking at it
as if it was human. It was not human.

572
00:58:22,429 --> 00:58:26,141
- Matthew, what else would it be?
- It was something, but not human.

573
00:58:26,266 --> 00:58:28,477
- It had white hair on it.
- It was growing.

574
00:58:28,643 --> 00:58:30,228
The one at Jack's was...

575
00:58:30,354 --> 00:58:34,024
It was like Jack, but not as developed
as the one at Elizabeth's place.

576
00:58:34,149 --> 00:58:35,984
It had tendrils on it.

577
00:58:36,109 --> 00:58:38,195
The one at her place was duplicating her.

578
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,364
If Matthew hadn't taken me away,

579
00:58:40,489 --> 00:58:44,076
the same thing that's happened
to Geoffrey would have happened to me.

580
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:48,664
Elizabeth, would you please tell me, in
your opinion, exactly what is happening?

581
00:58:51,792 --> 00:58:53,919
People are being duplicated.

582
00:58:55,045 --> 00:58:58,465
And once it's happened to you,
you're part of this thing.

583
00:58:59,841 --> 00:59:01,593
It almost happened to me!

584
00:59:03,095 --> 00:59:04,596
Look,

585
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:09,810
the reason you don't believe Elizabeth
is because the other body disappeared.

586
00:59:09,935 --> 00:59:12,980
It disappeared because Geoffrey took it.

587
00:59:13,105 --> 00:59:15,774
Well, then what happened
to my other body, then?

588
00:59:15,899 --> 00:59:18,652
Oh, people,
will you please listen to yourselves?

589
00:59:18,777 --> 00:59:20,946
Will you listen to what you are saying?

590
00:59:21,071 --> 00:59:25,993
I can deal with a body being moved and
even with a body getting up and leaving,

591
00:59:26,118 --> 00:59:29,913
but when you start talking about
his other body, being duplicated...

592
00:59:30,038 --> 00:59:31,707
Listen to how that sounds.

593
00:59:31,873 --> 00:59:35,335
We know how insane this sounds!
But what do you think we're doing?

594
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,587
Do you think we're making it up?

595
00:59:37,713 --> 00:59:42,050
Do you believe that my body looked like
me and that her body looked like her?

596
00:59:42,175 --> 00:59:43,802
D'you think we're crazy?

597
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:48,932
You are trying to make us believe
that we are seeing things. Why?

598
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:51,476
All I'm trying to do is help.

599
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:55,814
You call me in the middle of the night and
ask me to help. That's all I'm trying to do.

600
00:59:55,939 --> 00:59:57,899
Well, I'm sorry if we woke you up!

601
00:59:58,066 --> 01:00:01,403
If we inconvenienced you,
I guess we owe you an apology.

602
01:00:01,528 --> 01:00:04,906
I mean, I mean...
I guess that's a rotten thing to do!

603
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,744
You've upset my wife, too.

604
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:18,045
David, I don't know what it is
or where it comes from,

605
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:20,213
but I saw it and I'm gonna fight it.

606
01:00:20,339 --> 01:00:23,592
Matthew, my friend, I believe you.

607
01:00:25,052 --> 01:00:27,554
I've known you too long
not to believe you.

608
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:29,723
What do you wanna do?

609
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:34,227
Well, if I could get official support,
I'd institute the emergency procedures

610
01:00:34,353 --> 01:00:37,147
that we use for cholera
or legionnaires' disease.

611
01:00:37,272 --> 01:00:41,109
- What do you want me to do?
- I can handle the Health Department.

612
01:00:41,234 --> 01:00:44,738
But if panic breaks out,
we'll need the police and the Guard,

613
01:00:44,863 --> 01:00:46,990
and that means the Mayor and...

614
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:50,619
The Mayor's a patient of yours, isn't he?

615
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:53,413
How did you know that?

616
01:00:54,331 --> 01:00:56,375
What do you want me to do?

617
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,960
Would you ask him
to accept my telephone call?

618
01:00:59,086 --> 01:01:01,463
I'll call him in a hour. I'll be at my office.

619
01:01:01,588 --> 01:01:04,132
If you have any other ideas, get in touch.

620
01:01:06,635 --> 01:01:08,679
Call me.

621
01:01:09,971 --> 01:01:12,015
Thank you.

622
01:01:37,416 --> 01:01:39,459
The sooner the better.

623
01:01:42,129 --> 01:01:43,922
This smells lovely.

624
01:01:44,006 --> 01:01:47,259
- I want you to listen to me.
- I am listening to you, Nancy.

625
01:01:47,384 --> 01:01:51,054
I am not seeing things.
I know I saw what I saw

626
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:55,058
and I know it was turning into you, Jack.
Now, that body we found...

627
01:01:55,183 --> 01:01:57,561
That flower. Where did you get that?

628
01:01:57,686 --> 01:02:00,772
- In the vase with the others.
- Just stuck in there?

629
01:02:00,897 --> 01:02:04,234
- Yeah. Why?
- Geoffrey gave me one last night.

630
01:02:04,359 --> 01:02:05,360
So what?

631
01:02:05,485 --> 01:02:08,530
A customer, Mr Gianni,
brought one of those to the baths.

632
01:02:08,697 --> 01:02:09,531
So what?

633
01:02:09,698 --> 01:02:12,701
- Put it down, Jack.
- It's a pod with a flower on it.

634
01:02:12,826 --> 01:02:16,538
- I could not find that flower in any book.
- Jack, put it down.

635
01:02:16,663 --> 01:02:20,375
- It's a pink flower, honey.
- It could be toxic.

636
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:24,629
I have seen these flowers all over.
They grow like parasites on other plants.

637
01:02:24,755 --> 01:02:27,049
- Where are they coming from?
- Outer space.

638
01:02:27,174 --> 01:02:29,551
- They're not from outer space.
- Why not?

639
01:02:29,676 --> 01:02:31,178
- They're not.
- Why?!

640
01:02:31,303 --> 01:02:33,555
What are you talking about?
A space flower?

641
01:02:34,723 --> 01:02:38,393
Why not a space flower?
Why do we always expect metal ships?

642
01:02:38,518 --> 01:02:40,771
I've never expected metal ships.

643
01:02:40,896 --> 01:02:43,482
There must be other ways
they get in our systems.

644
01:02:43,607 --> 01:02:46,943
Right. They could be getting into us
through touch or fragrance.

645
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:50,697
We would never even notice it,
not from the impurities we have.

646
01:02:50,822 --> 01:02:53,533
I mean, we eat junk and we breathe junk.

647
01:02:53,659 --> 01:02:58,497
I don't know where they're coming from,
but I feel as though I've been poisoned.

648
01:02:58,622 --> 01:03:01,833
We've gotta take those flowers in
and have them analysed.

649
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:04,920
- There's something here.
- They could get into us

650
01:03:05,045 --> 01:03:09,091
and screw up our genes like DNA,
recombine us, change us.

651
01:03:09,216 --> 01:03:10,717
Oh, of course!

652
01:03:10,842 --> 01:03:13,929
This is the same way
those rockets landed years ago,

653
01:03:14,054 --> 01:03:18,350
so those spacemen could mate with
monkeys and create the human race.

654
01:03:18,475 --> 01:03:20,644
It's happening now!

655
01:03:30,779 --> 01:03:34,157
- Who do you wish to speak to?
- David Kibner.

656
01:03:34,282 --> 01:03:37,035
He's not in right now.
He'll be back this afternoon.

657
01:03:37,202 --> 01:03:41,999
Could you leave a message for him?
Matthew Bennell. B-E-N-N-E-L-L.

658
01:03:42,124 --> 01:03:46,003
- And your number, please?
- No, he's got my number. Thank you.

659
01:03:52,843 --> 01:03:55,512
James Grala, Deputy City Attorney.
Can I help you?

660
01:03:55,637 --> 01:03:57,264
My name is Matthew Bennell.

661
01:03:57,389 --> 01:04:01,018
B-E-N-N-E-L-L.
I'm a deputy public health inspector.

662
01:04:01,143 --> 01:04:04,271
- Is this another call about impostors?
- Yes.

663
01:04:04,396 --> 01:04:06,565
- We're the first agency you called?
- Yes.

664
01:04:06,732 --> 01:04:09,651
Good. Listen, Mr Bennell,
we don't wanna create a panic.

665
01:04:09,818 --> 01:04:11,611
No-one here knows.

666
01:04:11,695 --> 01:04:14,239
I'd like you to stay by yourphone
for a while.

667
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:17,451
I'll have somebody call you back
and take down all you know.

668
01:04:17,576 --> 01:04:19,411
All right, thank you.

669
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:24,666
This is a busy lab, Elizabeth.
We don't test flowers.

670
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:28,170
- They go to the Depart of Agriculture.
- I know where they go!

671
01:04:28,337 --> 01:04:32,049
I think this is our problem.
I think it is affecting people.

672
01:04:32,466 --> 01:04:34,217
How?

673
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:39,890
Look, Allen, I have already said
that I'll do all the testing.

674
01:04:40,057 --> 01:04:42,434
You don't have to lift a finger. Can l?

675
01:04:43,226 --> 01:04:47,564
You've been consistently late, Elizabeth,
and you're behind in your work,

676
01:04:47,689 --> 01:04:49,733
so I'll do the tests for you.

677
01:04:50,817 --> 01:04:52,569
Thank you.

678
01:04:52,694 --> 01:04:55,781
- It'll take 48 hours.
- Allen, 24.

679
01:04:57,032 --> 01:05:01,745
I can't understand why you've become
so emotional about a little flower.

680
01:05:05,874 --> 01:05:06,875
Hello.

681
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,210
- Mr Bennell?
- Yes.

682
01:05:08,335 --> 01:05:10,337
- From the Health Department?
- Yes.

683
01:05:10,462 --> 01:05:13,548
- It's Ted Jessop, the Mayor's assistant.
- Yes.

684
01:05:13,674 --> 01:05:16,593
- You've come across something strange?
- Yes.

685
01:05:16,718 --> 01:05:19,304
I'd like to suggest
we meet in Union Square.

686
01:05:19,429 --> 01:05:22,307
- We can't talk over the phone.
- Right away.

687
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,270
So you'll meet me here again tomorrow,
Mr Bennell?

688
01:05:27,396 --> 01:05:28,271
Yeah.

689
01:05:28,397 --> 01:05:30,607
Don't say a word to anyone. Keep it quiet.

690
01:05:30,732 --> 01:05:32,776
Whatever you say.

691
01:05:38,615 --> 01:05:42,244
- Please deposit 15 cents.
- Operator, I put in a quarter...

692
01:05:44,955 --> 01:05:48,041
This is Judy Hinkell,
the Mayor's special assistant.

693
01:05:48,166 --> 01:05:50,419
Yes. My name is Matthew Bennell.

694
01:05:50,585 --> 01:05:52,421
The Mayor's in conference,

695
01:05:52,546 --> 01:05:56,258
but Dr Kibner called him personally
to express his concern.

696
01:05:56,383 --> 01:05:58,010
And, Mr Bennell,

697
01:05:58,135 --> 01:06:02,639
we're asking for your discretion
because this thing might be abating.

698
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:06,560
Hello?

699
01:06:06,727 --> 01:06:08,311
- Matthew Bennell?
- Yes.

700
01:06:08,437 --> 01:06:11,523
I'm Michaels,
from the Federal Preparedness Agency.

701
01:06:11,648 --> 01:06:15,110
These reports ofstrange,
unexplained, diseased bodies.

702
01:06:15,235 --> 01:06:18,155
My understanding is
you haven't analysed anything

703
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,741
- and you have no tissue samples.
- No, I'm...

704
01:06:20,866 --> 01:06:25,120
Mr Bennell, it seems you'rejust winging
your conclusions. Keep an open mind.

705
01:06:25,287 --> 01:06:26,705
I had no intention...

706
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:29,499
Don't mention to anyone
about duplicate bodies.

707
01:06:29,624 --> 01:06:33,086
- I was gonna treat it...
- Excuse me, my otherphone is ringing.

708
01:06:35,422 --> 01:06:38,383
- Yes?
- This is serious business, Mr Bennell.

709
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:41,928
- Is thisjust a case ofparanoia?
- No, no, no.

710
01:06:42,054 --> 01:06:45,640
Know what mass hysteria looks like,
Mr Bennell?

711
01:06:45,766 --> 01:06:49,186
- We don't want to create a panic.
- We have a primary authority.

712
01:06:49,311 --> 01:06:50,604
Be cautious.

713
01:06:50,771 --> 01:06:52,731
You sound distressed.

714
01:06:52,856 --> 01:06:57,361
- I think the horizon looks bright.
- People are returning to normal.

715
01:06:57,486 --> 01:06:59,529
No, no. She all right.

716
01:06:59,655 --> 01:07:02,908
She better now. Much better now.

717
01:07:07,245 --> 01:07:09,706
- Did your husband ask you to come?
- No, no.

718
01:07:09,831 --> 01:07:13,418
I want everybody to see
that I'm back to myself again.

719
01:07:14,378 --> 01:07:15,712
No, wait. Please.

720
01:07:16,338 --> 01:07:18,465
I'll see you soon, I hope.

721
01:07:57,713 --> 01:08:00,298
Matthew, I'm not getting a thing here.

722
01:08:01,466 --> 01:08:04,761
Where is the...
I'm not getting any news here.

723
01:08:04,886 --> 01:08:07,681
Isn't there a 24-hour news?

724
01:08:09,141 --> 01:08:11,893
I would think you'd have
a good reception on the hill.

725
01:08:12,019 --> 01:08:16,023
There's a repair truck out here.
Could that be to do with it?

726
01:09:16,124 --> 01:09:20,962
She just needs something to help her
sleep. Tomorrow she'll be good as new.

727
01:09:21,088 --> 01:09:25,634
I would suggest you get some sleep, too.
You've done everything you possibly can.

728
01:09:29,262 --> 01:09:31,807
Can I give the Bellicecs a ride?

729
01:09:32,474 --> 01:09:34,309
No, I'm not going back there.

730
01:09:34,434 --> 01:09:37,312
- We'll just get a motel.
- You can stay here.

731
01:09:39,231 --> 01:09:40,190
Thank you.

732
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,193
Come on.

733
01:09:43,318 --> 01:09:46,738
I appreciate everything you've done,
David. Thank you.

734
01:09:48,573 --> 01:09:51,994
- Get some sleep.
- Sure. See you.

735
01:14:51,585 --> 01:14:54,755
Matthew. Matthew.

736
01:15:03,347 --> 01:15:06,141
Matthew, they're growing.
They're everywhere!

737
01:15:12,564 --> 01:15:13,774
Wake the others!

738
01:15:22,616 --> 01:15:25,452
Elizabeth, wake up!
They're growing out of these pods.

739
01:15:26,745 --> 01:15:30,624
- I'll get the police.
- Elizabeth, wake up.

740
01:15:30,749 --> 01:15:33,126
They get you when you sleep. Sit up!

741
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:36,004
Elizabeth! Elizabeth, would you wake up?

742
01:15:36,171 --> 01:15:37,381
Hello. Police.

743
01:15:37,506 --> 01:15:40,842
Officer, I would like to report
four bodies in my backyard.

744
01:15:40,967 --> 01:15:41,927
You OK?

745
01:15:42,052 --> 01:15:44,638
- Wait there, Mr Bennell.
- How do you know my name?

746
01:15:44,763 --> 01:15:46,098
Hang up, Matthew.

747
01:15:46,264 --> 01:15:48,308
- I didn't tell you my name!
- Hang up.

748
01:15:48,433 --> 01:15:52,104
- I didn't tell them my name!
- They're all a part of it.

749
01:15:53,897 --> 01:15:55,983
They're all pods, all of them.

750
01:15:58,402 --> 01:16:00,821
- Who are you calling?
- Washington.

751
01:16:00,946 --> 01:16:03,031
The CIA? The FBl? They're pods already.

752
01:16:03,156 --> 01:16:07,077
I've got a friend in the Justice Department.
I can dial direct.

753
01:16:07,202 --> 01:16:10,205
- What are you gonna tell him?
- Oh, my God!

754
01:16:10,706 --> 01:16:12,749
They grow out of those pods!

755
01:16:12,874 --> 01:16:14,626
They cut our power.

756
01:16:26,847 --> 01:16:29,808
Matthew, they're barricading the street.

757
01:16:29,891 --> 01:16:31,101
No!

758
01:16:40,819 --> 01:16:44,865
- What number are you calling from?
- Operator? I was dialling direct.

759
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:47,034
I'll try the number, Mr Bennell.

760
01:16:53,373 --> 01:16:57,294
- They're coming up here.
- Hang up, Matthew.

761
01:16:58,503 --> 01:17:00,547
Matthew, do you have a gun?

762
01:17:01,256 --> 01:17:02,257
No.

763
01:17:02,382 --> 01:17:05,510
- What are we gonna do?
- Out the back door.

764
01:17:06,803 --> 01:17:08,847
Hurry up! Jack!

765
01:17:14,686 --> 01:17:19,149
That way. Under the stairs.
Go on. I'll catch up with you.

766
01:18:03,986 --> 01:18:06,196
Go on, keep on running! Don't stop!

767
01:18:08,991 --> 01:18:10,534
Go on!

768
01:18:28,635 --> 01:18:30,679
Quickly. Follow me.

769
01:20:30,507 --> 01:20:32,551
We're being cornered!

770
01:20:41,268 --> 01:20:42,769
Jesus!

771
01:20:47,691 --> 01:20:49,067
Get down!

772
01:20:51,486 --> 01:20:54,656
Matthew, keep them here
and I'll come back with help.

773
01:20:54,823 --> 01:20:55,866
Jack.

774
01:20:59,328 --> 01:21:01,747
- Jack!
- No, Nancy.

775
01:21:01,997 --> 01:21:05,417
- No, Jack! Jack!
- Get down.

776
01:21:07,377 --> 01:21:09,421
Here I am, you pod bastard!

777
01:21:10,422 --> 01:21:11,423
Hey, pods!

778
01:21:11,548 --> 01:21:13,550
Come and get me, you scum!

779
01:21:35,906 --> 01:21:38,116
Wharf area is secure. Ten-four.

780
01:21:42,245 --> 01:21:45,749
Suspects escaping. Suspects escaping.

781
01:23:18,842 --> 01:23:21,011
Oh, yeah, showtime!

782
01:23:21,136 --> 01:23:24,931
Yes, sir, you're walking the right way.
We got nude girls...

783
01:23:26,933 --> 01:23:29,144
It's all going on right here.

784
01:23:29,269 --> 01:23:32,731
It's all live, it's all naked, sir.
Guaranteed action here.

785
01:23:32,856 --> 01:23:35,400
Guaranteed to make you
feel like a new man.

786
01:23:35,525 --> 01:23:37,736
Come on back here! Come on back here!

787
01:23:37,861 --> 01:23:40,280
D'you hear me? Come on back here!
This is it.

788
01:23:40,405 --> 01:23:42,908
We got male and female love back here...

789
01:23:56,755 --> 01:23:58,799
- Where to?
- The airport.

790
01:24:03,553 --> 01:24:06,431
Pacific and Hyde. Pacific and Hyde.

791
01:24:07,641 --> 01:24:10,602
6-10 proceeding south to airport,

792
01:24:10,727 --> 01:24:14,064
carrying two passengers, type H.

793
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:17,651
- Repeat. Type H.
- 6-10, confirmed.

794
01:24:17,776 --> 01:24:19,111
Some night, eh?

795
01:24:19,236 --> 01:24:20,821
- Take 280 south on ramp.
- Yeah.

796
01:24:21,905 --> 01:24:25,534
Type H unit established
in Financial and South ofMarket.

797
01:24:25,701 --> 01:24:27,661
Repeat. Financial and South ofMarket.

798
01:24:53,687 --> 01:24:56,356
Lombard on the Golden Gate.

799
01:24:56,481 --> 01:24:58,025
Where are you heading?

800
01:24:58,817 --> 01:25:00,861
I said. The airport.

801
01:25:00,986 --> 01:25:02,571
No. I mean which airline.

802
01:25:02,696 --> 01:25:05,949
- Market and 14th. Market and 14th.
- United.

803
01:25:06,116 --> 01:25:08,118
You got business outta town?

804
01:25:09,953 --> 01:25:14,082
No, we're not leaving. We're meeting
someone coming in from Boston.

805
01:25:14,207 --> 01:25:17,210
All fares at North Beach, regroup.

806
01:25:17,753 --> 01:25:21,673
Divisadero and Haight. Divisadero
and Haight. Divisadero and Haight.

807
01:25:21,798 --> 01:25:23,842
What is it?

808
01:25:24,009 --> 01:25:25,844
What's going on?

809
01:25:25,969 --> 01:25:28,096
Oh, nothing.

810
01:25:43,654 --> 01:25:44,863
Both of 'em.

811
01:26:22,234 --> 01:26:25,404
- Harry, pooch, wake up!
- Look, there's a pod.

812
01:29:15,824 --> 01:29:20,662
All those with families
in Berkeley, Oakland and Elizabeth.

813
01:29:23,957 --> 01:29:26,126
Unit Seven, special assistance.

814
01:29:26,251 --> 01:29:29,254
Could we have you
over by the Health Department?

815
01:29:29,796 --> 01:29:33,633
Red city, please.
All with red city families.

816
01:29:33,759 --> 01:29:36,928
Look at them!
Right out in the open.

817
01:29:37,012 --> 01:29:39,514
That's how they do it.

818
01:29:39,639 --> 01:29:43,226
That's how they spread it.
All those people are changed.

819
01:29:51,068 --> 01:29:53,195
Unit Seven, special assistance.

820
01:29:54,321 --> 01:29:57,824
Could we have you over
by the Health Department immediately?

821
01:30:02,037 --> 01:30:04,373
Matthew, we'll never be able to stop them!

822
01:30:04,498 --> 01:30:06,416
Yes, we will.

823
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:09,294
We can't!
Look it, they control the whole city.

824
01:30:09,419 --> 01:30:11,463
We'll find a way somehow.

825
01:30:12,714 --> 01:30:14,758
Oh, Matthew, I can't go on!

826
01:30:16,176 --> 01:30:19,179
I wanna go to sleep.
I can't stay awake any more.

827
01:30:20,681 --> 01:30:22,724
You have to.

828
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:26,812
You have to stay awake.

829
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:42,744
Would somebody in transportation
report to the Grove Street terminal?

830
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:49,334
Yup. Boccardo's pills.
He eats these like candy... or he used to.

831
01:30:49,501 --> 01:30:51,086
Take some.

832
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:53,714
- What are they?
- Speed. It'll keep us awake.

833
01:30:53,839 --> 01:30:57,175
- How many are you supposed to take?
- It says "Take one".

834
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,344
Take five.

835
01:31:09,896 --> 01:31:11,940
They know we're here.

836
01:31:20,699 --> 01:31:22,242
Jack, my God!

837
01:31:22,367 --> 01:31:23,910
No.

838
01:31:25,203 --> 01:31:29,458
Would have been a lot easier
if we'd just gone to sleep last night.

839
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:30,667
David, no!

840
01:31:30,792 --> 01:31:33,920
- Oh, my God! No! No! Matthew!
- Don't touch her!

841
01:31:34,046 --> 01:31:36,923
David, don't let them touch her!
Don't let them touch her!

842
01:31:37,049 --> 01:31:38,633
Don't let them touch her.

843
01:31:38,759 --> 01:31:41,219
- What are you gonna do?
- We'll leave the city!

844
01:31:41,345 --> 01:31:43,805
- Please, Geoffrey.
- David, let us go.

845
01:31:43,930 --> 01:31:47,059
- Let us leave the city!
- You don't have to leave the city.

846
01:31:47,184 --> 01:31:49,936
Nothing changes.
You can have the same life.

847
01:31:50,062 --> 01:31:51,813
But what happens to us?

848
01:31:52,439 --> 01:31:55,817
You'll be born again
into an untroubled world,

849
01:31:55,942 --> 01:31:58,487
free of anxiety, fear,

850
01:31:58,612 --> 01:32:00,530
- Wait.
- ..hate.

851
01:32:00,614 --> 01:32:03,909
- David, you're killing us.
- That's not true. David's right.

852
01:32:04,034 --> 01:32:09,206
Your minds and memories'll be totally
absorbed. Everything remains intact.

853
01:32:09,331 --> 01:32:12,918
You've never agreed with him in your life
before! What are you talking about?

854
01:32:13,085 --> 01:32:15,128
What are you...

855
01:32:26,306 --> 01:32:29,101
David, you're killing me.

856
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:53,959
- What is this supposed to do?
- Just a mild sedative to help you sleep.

857
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:58,255
- I hate you.
- We don't hate you.

858
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:01,758
There's no need for hate now...
or love.

859
01:33:03,343 --> 01:33:05,178
I love you, Matthew.

860
01:33:07,723 --> 01:33:09,891
There are people who will fight you.

861
01:33:11,309 --> 01:33:13,353
They'll stop you.

862
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:16,732
In an hour... you won't want them to.

863
01:33:28,535 --> 01:33:30,912
Don't be trapped by old concepts.

864
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:37,753
You're evolving into a new life form.

865
01:33:40,172 --> 01:33:42,215
Come and watch.

866
01:33:55,687 --> 01:33:58,398
We came here from a dying world.

867
01:33:59,316 --> 01:34:02,778
We drift through the universe
from planet to planet,

868
01:34:02,944 --> 01:34:04,988
pushed on by the solar winds.

869
01:34:05,197 --> 01:34:08,367
We adapt... and we survive.

870
01:34:09,326 --> 01:34:12,245
- The function of life is survival.
- Elizabeth!

871
01:34:29,262 --> 01:34:31,264
Open the freezer, quick.

872
01:34:31,390 --> 01:34:33,725
- This door?
- Yup.

873
01:34:41,233 --> 01:34:43,276
Shut the door.

874
01:34:49,866 --> 01:34:51,910
How are we gonna get outta here?

875
01:34:53,203 --> 01:34:55,288
Through the door. Come on.

876
01:35:30,365 --> 01:35:32,367
What's that?

877
01:35:37,247 --> 01:35:39,249
I've lost Jack.

878
01:35:39,374 --> 01:35:41,168
We got separated.

879
01:35:46,006 --> 01:35:50,385
I don't know where he is. I've looked
everywhere. Have you seen him?

880
01:35:51,595 --> 01:35:54,598
Nancy, this building is surrounded.
How did you get in?

881
01:35:54,723 --> 01:35:58,852
I've been wandering among 'em for hours.
They can be fooled.

882
01:35:58,977 --> 01:36:00,812
How?

883
01:36:00,937 --> 01:36:03,732
Don't show any emotions.
Hide your feelings.

884
01:36:03,857 --> 01:36:07,903
- And when you sleep?
- We'll watch over each other.

885
01:36:09,863 --> 01:36:12,282
- OK.
- Let's find Jack.

886
01:36:14,493 --> 01:36:16,912
We're going to beat them. OK?

887
01:36:17,913 --> 01:36:18,914
OK.

888
01:36:39,226 --> 01:36:41,520
Hey! The lines are over there.

889
01:36:50,153 --> 01:36:53,031
XB-25. XB-25. Station 5. Come in.

890
01:36:53,156 --> 01:36:57,786
Yes. Station 5. Proceeding
as per plan B. Awaiting Kibner unit.

891
01:36:57,911 --> 01:36:59,246
Station 5. Come in.

892
01:36:59,371 --> 01:37:04,084
XB-25. In front of the Health Department.
Request instructions.

893
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:09,840
You are in the rightplace for Sausalito.
Please keep moving right along.

894
01:37:11,383 --> 01:37:13,427
Sausalito only, please.

895
01:37:15,137 --> 01:37:17,180
Ask ifyou have a question.

896
01:37:20,726 --> 01:37:24,313
The yellow zone
is for loading and unloading only.

897
01:37:26,398 --> 01:37:30,235
If you have other business,
stay clear ofthe yellow.

898
01:37:31,278 --> 01:37:36,616
Stay clear ofthe yellow.
That's for loading or unloading.

899
01:37:49,379 --> 01:37:51,423
Get them! Get them!

900
01:37:52,382 --> 01:37:54,426
Get them!

901
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:02,494
Come on, get up.

902
01:39:13,964 --> 01:39:16,008
Oh, God!

903
01:39:52,210 --> 01:39:54,254
You see them?

904
01:39:54,504 --> 01:39:57,841
This is where they grow them.
This is where they cultivate them.

905
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:03,764
It's enormous.

906
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,646
What are we gonna do?
There are so many.

907
01:40:10,771 --> 01:40:13,690
We've got to figure out a way
of stopping them.

908
01:40:20,030 --> 01:40:22,074
Can you walk?

909
01:40:22,199 --> 01:40:25,369
- I'll try.
- Here, hold on to me and try and walk.

910
01:40:40,759 --> 01:40:42,803
Oh, God! Are you all right?

911
01:40:45,097 --> 01:40:47,140
A factory...

912
01:40:47,307 --> 01:40:49,351
They're growing them.

913
01:40:51,061 --> 01:40:53,063
Elizabeth.

914
01:40:56,274 --> 01:40:57,901
I love you.

915
01:40:58,110 --> 01:41:00,070
I love you.

916
01:41:00,237 --> 01:41:01,863
I love you!

917
01:41:04,199 --> 01:41:06,034
Come on.

918
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:09,246
Oh, I can't. I can't!

919
01:41:33,645 --> 01:41:35,063
Music.

920
01:41:38,608 --> 01:41:40,652
Ships.

921
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:44,031
Ships... Ships!

922
01:41:45,157 --> 01:41:47,200
Ships! We can get away!

923
01:41:53,665 --> 01:41:56,710
I'll go down there. I'll be right back.
Stay here.

924
01:41:56,835 --> 01:41:58,295
Stay here.

925
01:42:53,517 --> 01:42:55,894
- ..San Francisco Bay area.
- Oh, God!

926
01:42:57,396 --> 01:42:59,856
Mostly fair Saturday night and Sunday.

927
01:42:59,982 --> 01:43:02,901
There will be a cooling trend
with improved visibility.

928
01:43:03,026 --> 01:43:06,530
Night-time lows in the fifties tonight
and in the forties Saturday.

929
01:43:06,697 --> 01:43:10,075
Light winds becoming north-westerly,
10-20mph...

930
01:43:27,634 --> 01:43:29,678
Elizabeth, no! No!

I love you.

934
01:43:57,205 --> 01:43:59,249
The boat's there, Elizabeth.

935
01:43:59,374 --> 01:44:01,335
The boat's there.

936
01:44:02,294 --> 01:44:04,338
It's gonna take us away.

937
01:44:44,461 --> 01:44:46,505
There's nothing to be afraid of.

- There's one over here, I think.

946
01:51:04,216 --> 01:51:06,051
- We'll get him.
- We'll get him.

947
