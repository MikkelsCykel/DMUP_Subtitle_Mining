1
00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:06,431
Still got a drive up to Los Angeles.
-See your son, ha?

2
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:10,051
That's nice, Lilly. Side of you
I never knew.

3
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:14,521
He's a good kid. Salesman.
-On the square, ha?

4
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:26,571
How are you hanging out these days?
Stealing much? -From you?

5
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:30,531
My folks didn't raise no stupid kids.

6
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,371
You're not scheming a thing, Lilly?

7
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:37,831
Well, you know, I clip a buck here,
and a buck there. Not enough to notice.

8
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:42,751
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
-A person who don't look out for himself

9
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:47,801
is too dumb to look out for anybody else.
He's a liability, right, Bo?

10
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:53,601
That's a 1000% right, Lilly.
-Or else he's working an angle.

11
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:57,181
If he's not stealing a little,
he's stealing a lot.

12
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,481
You know it, Lilly!

13
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:10,161
You know what, I like that suit, Bobo.

14
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:13,661
I don't know what there is about it, but

15
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:19,541
somehow it makes you look taller.
-Yeah? -yeah.

16
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:26,131
You really think so? -Yeah.
-A lotta people've been telling me that.

17
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,641
Well, you can tell them from me
they're right.

18
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:35,721
Well, I'd best be going.

19
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:41,981
Roy will wonder where I am.
-Worries about his mother, does he?

20
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:44,981
You give him a hug from me.
-I will.

21
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:49,741
Thanks, Bobo.

22
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:51,701
So long, Bobo.

23
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:05,861
I don't see why we have to take
the train.

24
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:09,191
What if we wanna drive somewhere,
while we're there?

25
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,821
We will rent a car.
-Expender!

26
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:16,621
You ain't seen nothing yet.
-Why so many people?

27
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,371
The races at La Jolla.

28
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,871
Where your mother is?

29
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:26,291
You don't wanna see her, do you?
-No.

30
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:31,261
Hit the beach, eat well is good
enough for me.

31
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:43,021
I must stretch my legs, you wanna
come along?

32
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:44,981
No.
-Wanna drink?

33
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:49,481
No.
-See you in a minute.

34
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:57,991
A drink for you, a drink for Generson's
day grandmother. -Right.

35
00:03:57,991 --> 00:04:01,161
But junior gets milk.
-Right, right.

36
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:14,171
A minute.

37
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:41,951
I'm sorry. -I spilled
all your drinks.

38
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:45,661
Sure you're ok? -Yeah. What were those?
Beers?

39
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:57,761
Four Millers.

40
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:45,771
Hey! Did one of you guys drop this?
-No.

41
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:48,101
I don't know. I wouldn't have taken a chance.

42
00:05:56,781 --> 00:05:59,821
Another round, I'm buying.
-No, come on guy, you can't buy every round.

43
00:05:59,821 --> 00:06:02,741
It's like our turn.
-Come on, we've got plenty of cash.

44
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:05,621
Tell you what.
We'll roll off one?

45
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:10,251
Low number buys.
-Very good. -You're on for it.

46
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:15,001
Let's go, Junior.
That's just four.

47
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:19,971
Gimme a chance to get one of you back.
-You got it.

48
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:49,161
Wanna go one more time?
I got four.

49
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:29,081
It's great to get away, isn't it?
To take some time off?

50
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:33,711
Next week, I'll be back to work.
-You already went back to work.

51
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:39,501
What? - I watched you. Working
the tatt on those sailor boys.

52
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:46,801
Working the what? -Oh, come on, Roy.
The tatt. What you do for a living.

53
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:54,271
I'm a salesman. -You're on the grift.
Same as me. - Myra, I'm not following this.

54
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:58,811
Roy, you're a short-con operator.
And a good one, I think.

55
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,571
Don't talk to me like
I'm another square.

56
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:14,661
You talk the lingo.
What's your pitch?

57
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,131
The long end. Big con.
-Nobody does that single out.

58
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,501
I was teamed 10 years with the
best in the business.

59
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,551
Cool Langley.
-I've heard the name.

60
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:28,551
It was beautiful, and getting better
all the time. -Is that right?

61
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:32,851
It is, Roy, it's where you should be.
What are you bringing? 3, 400 a week?

62
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:35,891
We used money like that for tips.
- Wow!

63
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:39,771
And now, right now, it's the perfect time.
The best time

64
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:44,531
since I've been in the game.

65
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:03,211
All over the southwest you've got
these businessmen. They were

66
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:08,051
making money when everybody was
making money. They think that means

67
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:13,261
they're smart. And now they're hurting.
When the price of oil fell, so did they.

68
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:18,731
They've still got money,
but they need more money.

69
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:24,401
When the oil money was good, they put
up all these office buildings. Now they're

70
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:28,401
half empty. They'd give you anything to
move in: first two months free,

71
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,871
redecoration, whatever you want.

72
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:37,621
They help you set up the store.

73
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:46,421
I'm the roper. I go out and find them,
and bring them in.

74
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:48,591
Morning, gentlemen.

75
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:53,601
Gloster Hebing, may I present my
fine stock broker, Henry Fellows?

76
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:58,931
Gloster.

77
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,361
What we have here today,
Mary Beth, is strickly between...

78
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:06,651
Oh, I told Mr. Hebing all
about it. How brilliant you are

79
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,821
at making money for your
special clients.

80
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:16,831
Well, I certainly hope that you're not
spreading the news a little too widely.

81
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:20,961
Well, of course not! But I'd trust
Mr. Hebing with anything.

82
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,541
Wouldn't I, darling?

83
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:28,341
Well, I guess I'll just have to take
your word for that. Won't I?

84
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,721
Here's the money.

85
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,311
Goodie!

86
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,821
Please, let me help you.

87
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:59,451
Once they saw that money,
they were hooked.

88
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:04,251
And I made sure they saw it.
Ain't that just beautiful?

89
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:14,381
Then, all Cool had to do was
tell the story.  -We are talking about

90
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:17,721
breaking the law here. I just wanna
make sure you understand that.

91
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:20,771
No one is gonna get hurt, but the law\
is gonna be broken. -Laws were made

92
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:23,601
to be broken. - Lose talk is the one thing I
worry about.

93
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:27,151
I can keep my mouth shut.

94
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:31,991
Gloster, come on over here
and sit down.

95
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:39,121
Tokyo exchange is 9 hours behind us,
the NY exchange is 1 hour ahead of us.

96
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:44,041
There is never one hour in which
both exchanges are open.

97
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,081
Information moves, but it has to wait.
Now, I have a fellow working for me.

98
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,501
D'ya know what a hacker is?

99
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,971
Yeah, sure. That's like a computer expert,
a genius. -Very good.

100
00:11:53,971 --> 00:11:57,261
And what this boy has been able to do,
is tap into that main link

101
00:11:57,261 --> 00:12:00,221
between Tokyo and NY
and when we really need it

102
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:03,351
he's been able to give us
a 7 second delay

103
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:06,731
in the transfer of that information.
Do you know what that means?

104
00:12:06,771 --> 00:12:10,401
Well, I can see that you get your
information ahead of NY.

105
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:13,861
Every once in a while
a major change happens.

106
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:18,411
And we have a 7 second advantage
to put a buy order, a sell order,

107
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:21,911
into that computer in NY just before
that data from Tokyo comes pulling in

108
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:25,291
right behind it.

109
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,961
Not much time.
-No, we have to be ready, we have

110
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:32,301
to have the money, we have to know
what that information means

111
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:34,171
and we have to move like grease
lightning.

112
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,261
But boy, when it works,
it is beautiful!

113
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,101
Seven seconds, ah?

114
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:44,681
I don't see how you can do it.
-Machines!

115
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,481
Machines, Gloster!

116
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:52,071
I've got a whole room full of machines
machines back here.Y'wanna see it?

117
00:12:53,941 --> 00:13:00,241
Henry, no. -I've got a whole suite full
of mainframe computers back here.

118
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,701
They are so beautiful!
-No, Henry.

119
00:13:04,581 --> 00:13:07,751
Oh, you got a minute?
Come on, Gloster!

120
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,751
Listen to them hum.

121
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:15,261
Henry, don't try Mr. Hebbing's
patience! - You sure?

122
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:16,761
Well...

123
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:20,591
OK, then.

124
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:26,351
Cole liked to take risks, huh?
-He didn't think they were risks.

125
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:29,311
He was so good, Roy,
he could just play with the mark.

126
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:34,321
He was so crooked, he could
eat soup with a corkscrew.

127
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:38,861
And when he got serious?
- He'd explain he had to have cash,

128
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:41,871
so there wouldn't be any paper
trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash,

129
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:45,041
or it wasn't worth while.

130
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:54,301
The least we ever took
was US$ 40.000,

131
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:59,131
and the most was 185.000$,
from one sucker!

132
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:04,561
I thought these people were broke.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor.

133
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:07,561
They had savings accounts,
stocks to sell,

134
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:12,061
houses to mortgage.
Sell their wife's jewelry.

135
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:15,691
Oh, they had a lot of money,
when they put their minds to it.

136
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:18,531
Or when I put their minds to it.

137
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:22,451
And a month later, the sucker calls
the cops and you're on the run.

138
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:27,121
No no! He never calls the cops,
not after we give him the blow-off.

139
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,761
FBI! Everybody hold
what you've got!

140
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:41,511
Back off!

141
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:45,011
It's right here!

142
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:48,271
You was it!
-No!

143
00:14:48,271 --> 00:14:51,891
You and your goddam bigmouth!
-No!

144
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:57,151
Henry, no!

145
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:04,411
You don't move, backwards,
nobody move!

146
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,581
You stay there! Come with me!
-No!

147
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:10,911
Go, go, go!

148
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:30,891
They never came back.

149
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:54,041
We were rolling in dough,
lived wherever we wanted,

150
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,341
only pulled two or three
scams a year.

151
00:15:57,341 --> 00:15:59,341
It was great!
Great! Great!

152
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,631
What happened to Cole?

153
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:09,971
He retired.
-Retired...

154
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:11,391
Where?

155
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:14,691
Upstate.

156
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:16,731
Upstate where?

157
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:20,611
Atascadero.

158
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:44,751
No, baby. Not again.

159
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:50,511
It's hollow. I can't move.

160
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:52,721
Cant' move. Can't move.

161
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:56,941
It's just the stress again.
We'll take a vacation.

162
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:03,151
Cole, you scare me
when this happens!

163
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:05,571
No, no! Turn around!

164
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:09,121
Cole, please! Please!

165
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:14,041
That's where they keep
the criminally insane, isn't it?

166
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:16,711
He retired, and that's it.

167
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,341
But I didn't.
I'm still the best long-con

168
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:32,221
roper you'll ever see.
-I bet you are, too.

169
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:38,351
Now you're trying to rope me.
-Join up with you!

170
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:56,451
A beautiful woman like you?
You shouldn't eat alone -Go away.

171
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:04,461
What d'ya wanna eat alone for?
-Can I have some more coffee?

172
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,801
Coming up!
-We can have coffee together.

173
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:11,221
My name's Kenny.

174
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:16,141
Your pal wants you.
Let'm find his own pretty woman.

175
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,271
This fellow bothering you, miss?
-Yes.

176
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:21,651
Why don'y you go back there
and just go sit down?

177
00:18:26,861 --> 00:18:28,691
I'll sit here.

178
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:39,121
You all right?
-You didn't need to do that!

179
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:42,501
I thought I did. You should
take better care of yr friend.

180
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:44,381
Get outta here!

181
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:50,551
I'm sorry a lady can't eat in here
without been bothered!

182
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:53,051
Will never happen again, miss.

183
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:03,731
See you later.
-Why d'we have to have separate rooms?

184
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:08,531
Expect your father to come through?
-Separate bathrooms, darling.

185
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:12,111
I will not lay out all my
cosmetics for you to knock over.

186
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:15,121
Things a man isn't
supposed to know.

187
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:18,541
You don't mind, really, d'ya, Roy?
It's been such a wonderful evening,

188
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:21,371
I guess I just wore myself out.

189
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:25,671
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.

190
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:51,821
Forget the longcon,'cause I'm
the one who's been conned.

191
00:19:52,781 --> 00:19:54,781
Screw this noise!

192
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:08,381
Open your door!

193
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:12,131
What for?

194
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:14,381
Open it, and find out.

195
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:44,291
Gangway!

196
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:53,301
I hope you don't mind, sir.
I just washed my clothes,

197
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:56,341
and I couldn't do a thing\Nwith them.

198
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:06,481
If you could have seen the look on
yr face when I told you good night!

199
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:09,481
You looked so...

200
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:46,101
Roy! -Can I come in?
-Sure.

201
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:55,031
What'r'ya doing in La Jolla?
-Me and Myra came down yesterday,

202
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:56,651
we're leaving tonight.

203
00:21:57,741 --> 00:22:02,371
If'ya come out to the track, don't
know me.  -We won't hit the track.

204
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:10,421
What's that? -4 grand.
It's for the hospital, is it enough?

205
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:14,921
Roy, I don't want yr money.
-I pay my debts.

206
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:16,051
Oh, you do?
Yeah!

207
00:22:20,011 --> 00:22:21,971
Expecting somebody?

208
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:25,771
No. That was the point.

209
00:22:29,191 --> 00:22:32,691
Where did ya get that? -Accident.
Take the money back, I don't want it.

210
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,321
No.

211
00:22:41,491 --> 00:22:43,371
I thought...

212
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:48,161
I was hoping we could play it
straight with one another.

213
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:51,671
I guess not. -I guess you won't
be getting a straight job, either?

214
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:56,051
Not this week. -Not ever!
-It's up to me.

215
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:01,761
I'm strictly short-con.

216
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:13,101
I've heard that one before.
-Yeah, but I'm in control.

217
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:17,391
Sure. You're only 25 years old
already you can lay down

218
00:23:18,771 --> 00:23:24,231
4 grand, without even
turning a hair!

219
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:26,031
Goes like anything else, Roy.
You don't stand still,

220
00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:29,861
either go up or down, usually
down, sooner or later.

221
00:23:33,031 --> 00:23:35,081
Well, that oughta be
a surprise, then.

222
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:43,501
You'll gonna head east
from here?

223
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,421
After the meet.
Back to Baltimore.

224
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:52,101
It was nice to see
you again.

225
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:05,361
You little prick!

226
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:35,021
OK? -I see him. Just wait. Hold it.
-That's the guy we followed.

227
00:24:35,231 --> 00:24:36,641
Just wait!

228
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:23,071
Excuse, me? Can I borrow your
binoculars? Thanks!

229
00:25:28,031 --> 00:25:29,451
Excuse me.

230
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:14,071
What did you do to yrself all
afternoon? - I went out to the track.

231
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:16,871
What were you doing at the track?
Did you run into my mother?

232
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:20,001
No, how could I?
I was in the clubhouse.

233
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:28,341
Lilly wouldn't be in the clubhouse,
would she? How did ya know that?

234
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:33,341
OK, I saw her. -But she didn't
see you, in other words?

235
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:36,891
I saw her out there, and I was curious.
You know she's always so nasty to me.

236
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:41,231
I know she was knocking me
to you every chance she has.

237
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:45,771
So, I called a friend of mine in
Baltimore, so now I know who she is.

238
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,241
You must have some very
knowledgeable friends.

239
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:53,951
I'm well connected, Roy. Cole
introduced me to a lotta people.

240
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:57,701
Very valuable.
Valuable for us.

241
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:00,871
Running your broker scam,
you mean.

242
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:04,751
What a team we'll make!
You won't regret this, Roy.

243
00:27:04,751 --> 00:27:08,171
Regret what? I didn't say
I was coming aboard.

244
00:27:08,171 --> 00:27:13,971
Why not? I thought it was settled!
-Nothing was ever settled.

245
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:19,481
It's yr mother talking against me!
-She's got nothing to do with it!

246
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,531
I make my own decisions!
-It's not what Lilly thinks...

247
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:25,861
Who cares what she thinks?
I don't care what she thinks.

248
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:32,701
Left home when I was 17, with nothing
but stuff I bought and paid for myself.

249
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:33,411
Nothing from Lilly.

250
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:01,641
Darling, guess what?
I had to tell you right away.

251
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:05,941
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa,
the one who plays my chauffeur.

252
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:09,111
He says that there's a sucker there
that's made for us.

253
00:28:09,111 --> 00:28:13,191
And a broker that just shut down,
we can use their office,

254
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,241
not change a thing!

255
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:19,491
I can scrape up 10 grand if I try,
I got a couple of aces in the whole,

256
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:22,711
some markers I could call on
for something real.

257
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:26,671
That leaves 15 or 20 to yr end.
We can start this weekend,

258
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:30,301
get the sucker into position...
-Hold it!

259
00:28:32,381 --> 00:28:34,381
You're talking some
pretty tall figures,

260
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,381
What makes you think I have got
that kind of money?

261
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:41,811
Now, you must have.
Now, you know you do, Roy.

262
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:47,981
Maybe I like it where I am.

263
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:55,281
Well, maybe I don't. I had 10 good
years with Cole, and I want'em back.

264
00:28:58,281 --> 00:29:00,321
I gotta have a partner.

265
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,701
I looked and looked
and believe me, brother

266
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,161
I kissed a lotta fucking frogs!

267
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,381
And you're my prince!

268
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:14,511
Don't I get any say in this?
-No.. -That's what I say!

269
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:18,681
What I say is no.
We don't do partners.

270
00:29:21,471 --> 00:29:23,971
What is it?

271
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:29,401
What's going on? Why don't
you wanna team up?

272
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,401
The best reason I can think of
is that you scare the hell outta me.

273
00:29:32,401 --> 00:29:36,861
I've seen women like you before,
baby. You're double tough,

274
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:39,951
you're sharp as a razor, and you
get what you want, or else...

275
00:29:39,951 --> 00:29:45,331
But you don't make it work forever.
Sooner or later, the lightning hits.

276
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:47,791
And I'm not gonna be around
when it hits you.

277
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,631
By God!

278
00:29:55,631 --> 00:29:57,091
It's your mother.

279
00:29:57,301 --> 00:30:00,471
It's Lilly!
-What?

280
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:04,641
Sure it is. That's why you act
so funny around each other

281
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:07,101
What's that?

282
00:30:07,351 --> 00:30:09,691
Don't act so goddam innocent!

283
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:13,611
You and your own mother?

284
00:30:16,611 --> 00:30:19,281
You like to go back where you
been, huh? -Watch yr mouth!

285
00:30:19,281 --> 00:30:22,451
I'm wise to you, I should've seen it
before, you rotten son of a bitch!

286
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:26,531
How is it, huh?
How do you like it...

287
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,001
Stop!

288
00:30:32,011 --> 00:30:33,291
Stop!

289
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:44,051
That's not like me.
I don't do this.

290
00:30:45,181 --> 00:30:47,141
That's why we wouldn't
work together.

291
00:30:48,141 --> 00:30:51,561
Yr disgusting. Yr mind's so filthy
it's hard even to look at you.

292
00:30:54,111 --> 00:30:55,231
Goodbye.

293
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:18,421
And you don't even know it.

294
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:36,821
Mama. It's Mama. She's the one.
You'll get yours, Mama. Oh, yes.

295
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:56,711
Yeah? -Lilly, it's Roy.
Lilly, I was wondering if...

296
00:31:56,801 --> 00:32:02,261
I was wondering if we could just talk.
You know, like have a conversation.

297
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:07,141
Maybe we've both grown up.
Maybe we could just talk?

298
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:11,851
Sure, Roy.

299
00:32:13,521 --> 00:32:17,861
You want me to drive up?
-No. -OK.

300
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:22,651
I'll come there tonight.
-Fine. Come on down.

301
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:29,201
There won't be a home cooked meal.
-That's good news.

302
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:49,801
Who's a boy gonna talk to,
if not his mother?

303
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,211
Lilly, listen, it's Irv.

304
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:23,341
You've always been decent to me,
I'm taking a hell of a chance here.

305
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:27,261
Somebody blew you out with Bobo.
The car full of money, he's....

306
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:30,181
Lilly? Lilly?

307
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:44,691
Bobo knows about all the money in
the car. The money you stole from him.

308
00:34:57,811 --> 00:35:00,481
A black and gold Cadillac.

309
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:21,911
Hi! Wellcome to Phoenix.

310
00:37:21,911 --> 00:37:23,951
I'd like a single room
for tonight.

311
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:26,831
Everything's the same size,
same price.

312
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:31,171
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic
noise keeps me wide awake all night.

313
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:34,211
Trucks. I know what you mean.

314
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:36,591
Do you have something around
back facing away from the road?

315
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:43,521
I'll put you in 19. Very quiet.
Faces the desert.

316
00:37:43,601 --> 00:37:46,691
Sounds perfect. Can I park
my car back there?

317
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:48,561
Right in front of the room.

318
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:50,171
Something wrong?

319
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:55,301
Oh, sorry. I thought you were
the other lady.

320
00:38:56,091 --> 00:38:57,051
No. I'm me.

321
00:39:08,311 --> 00:39:12,231
I'll give you n. 6. Very nice room.
Very handy.

322
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:14,811
In the front, right by the pool.

323
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:19,691
Don't you have sth round back?
Where it's quieter?

324
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:24,321
Everybody wants
the back tonight!

325
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:28,241
I guess everybody
wants privacy.

326
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:44,821
Roy Dilon? Lt. Pearson,
Phoenix police. I have a car here.

327
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:03,831
There was a bunch of money
hidden in yr mother's car. -Yeah?

328
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,551
A lotta money! Would you know
anything about that? -No.

329
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:11,801
I realise this is a shock.
-Mostly, I don't believe it.

330
00:43:12,051 --> 00:43:15,551
That's natural. -No, I mean, I don't
believe it.

331
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:19,271
I know my mother. Lilly is not a suicide.
Nothing would make her check out.

332
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:23,561
I'm sorry. It was her, all right.

333
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:28,031
It's her gun, even.
-Her gun?

334
00:43:38,871 --> 00:43:41,911
There is one thing I have
to caution you.

335
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:45,001
Normally, we don't do a next to kin
ID, unless there's no other choice.

336
00:43:45,001 --> 00:43:47,961
In this case, there's no fingerprints
on the file, the dental records

337
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:50,921
don't help, because of the
location of the wound...

338
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:53,971
She ate the gun!

339
00:43:53,971 --> 00:43:56,801
I'm sorry. This is going
to be a shock.

340
00:44:07,441 --> 00:44:10,991
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
-Not many.

341
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:31,511
Remove that, we want a full
identification.

342
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:40,011
Jesus!
-No question, ahn?

343
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:42,561
No.

344
00:45:22,811 --> 00:45:24,891
That's it, then.
-Yeah.

345
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:28,481
That's that.

346
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:42,411
Mom.

347
00:46:22,831 --> 00:46:25,081
The last modern thing I liked
was the miniskirt.

348
00:46:26,081 --> 00:46:29,081
Your technology, now,
nobody understands it,

349
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:31,211
that's the simple fact
of the situation.

350
00:46:32,211 --> 00:46:36,251
Evening, Miss...
Langtrey.

351
00:48:27,581 --> 00:48:30,371
Hello, Lilly.

352
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:34,961
Roy, you scared me.

353
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:52,851
You going somewhere?
-Somewhere else, that's for sure.

354
00:48:53,061 --> 00:48:58,151
I just came back from Phoenix.
-Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?

355
00:48:58,321 --> 00:49:00,531
Looks very solid, Lilly.

356
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:04,451
Take a minute, tell me about it.
-I've really got to go...

357
00:49:04,451 --> 00:49:09,371
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
-Yeah, but not for long.

358
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:10,791
Cops may buy it, but Bobo will
spend money to make sure.

359
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:14,041
Even so, relax a minute.
Sit down!

360
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:16,961
Just for a minute.

361
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,631
Put that down.

362
00:49:29,931 --> 00:49:33,351
Myra followed you, huh?
-Yeah.

363
00:49:33,351 --> 00:49:34,941
I guess  She must have been the
one that blew me off with Bobo.

364
00:49:36,381 --> 00:49:43,941
To get me running. Did you tell her
about my stash? -No.

365
00:49:44,241 --> 00:49:47,411
It was she was after, though.
What happened at Phoenix?

366
00:49:48,371 --> 00:49:52,381
Oh, Roy. It was terrible.

367
00:49:57,831 --> 00:50:01,591
You read about people killing
people and all that,

368
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:05,671
But when it happens...

369
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:08,681
My God!

370
00:50:12,601 --> 00:50:17,811
She was in her nightgown, you
know, the old grifter's dodge,

371
00:50:19,481 --> 00:50:23,821
nightgown and the ice bucket and she
just got into the wrong room by mistake.

372
00:50:38,251 --> 00:50:40,631
I sat in there with her,

373
00:50:41,501 --> 00:50:44,001
I thought, what do I do now?

374
00:50:44,631 --> 00:50:47,761
Run, I've got Bobo
and the law after me.

375
00:50:47,841 --> 00:50:50,431
Stay, and how do I explain?
-This was perfect.

376
00:50:51,431 --> 00:50:55,311
It is, isn't it? I've wanted
out of the rackets for years,

377
00:50:55,311 --> 00:50:56,351
and now I'm out.

378
00:50:56,351 --> 00:51:00,271
I can make a clean break and...
You've already made a break.

379
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:05,111
I don't know how clean it is.
-I'm sorry, Roy.

380
00:51:06,031 --> 00:51:09,151
I hated to take your money, but --
You're not taking it.

381
00:51:09,481 --> 00:51:13,701
Roy, I need this money. I can't run
withouth money, and if I can't, I'm dead.

382
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:16,871
You must have some money.
-Just a few bucks. -Myra's stuff?

383
00:51:16,871 --> 00:51:19,831
Her credit cards. How far am I
gonna get with that?

384
00:51:19,831 --> 00:51:23,001
Far enough. San Francisko, St Louis.
Some place new. Start over.

385
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:26,211
You're smart, good-looking, you
won't have any trouble finding a job.

386
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:28,721
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
-Well, you're gonna start if you wanna

387
00:51:28,721 --> 00:51:32,431
live through this. You're gonna get a
square job, live a quiet life. You start

388
00:51:32,431 --> 00:51:35,891
showing up at the track or the hot spots
and Bobo's boys will be all over you.

389
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:39,681
Roy, don't tell me what to do with myself,
it's a big world ou there. -Not anymore.

390
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:45,071
Lilly, listen to me, it's good advice.
I'm following it myself. -What?

391
00:51:45,691 --> 00:51:48,861
You wanted me out of the rackets,
off the grift? I think I'm gonna get out.

392
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:50,861
Roy, that's fine,
but I don't have time for this.

393
00:51:50,861 --> 00:51:52,951
Bobo's after my ass!
-I thought you'd be happy for me.

394
00:51:52,951 --> 00:51:55,581
After all, you're the one who...
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me!

395
00:51:55,581 --> 00:51:59,671
And he's goddamn good, but so am I.
What makes you think I'm gonna let you

396
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:03,921
outta here with my money? -I'm a survivor.
I survive. And to survive, I need money.

397
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,551
No!

398
00:52:18,181 --> 00:52:20,021
You want a drink?

399
00:52:23,351 --> 00:52:26,151
No! You probably shouldn't
have one either.

400
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:30,191
No, but I'm goddam thirsty.

401
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,571
Ice water?

402
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:36,701
Sure, that sounds nice.

403
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:38,081
I'll get it.

404
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:14,281
Take whichever one you want.

405
00:53:15,781 --> 00:53:17,071
You wouldn't do that.

406
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:19,411
You don't know what I'd do.

407
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:22,791
You have no idea.

408
00:53:23,581 --> 00:53:26,711
To live.
-You'll live, Lilly.

409
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:39,891
I know what's bugging you, of course.
-Oh? I didn't know anything was.

410
00:53:39,891 --> 00:53:42,891
I wasn't a very good mother
to you when you were a kid.

411
00:53:44,181 --> 00:53:46,351
It was pretty lousy of me, I guess.

412
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:52,301
-To be a child at the same time you
were. -For God's sake, Lilly!

413
00:53:52,821 --> 00:53:54,951
I gave you your life twice.

414
00:53:56,861 --> 00:53:59,701
I'm asking you to give me
mine once.

415
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:03,621
I need the money, Roy.

416
00:54:04,871 --> 00:54:05,871
No.

417
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:31,061
So, you're getting off the grift, ahn?
-I might. -That's good.

418
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:34,861
You don't really belong on this
side of the fence, you know.

419
00:54:35,321 --> 00:54:41,281
I don't? -If you stayed a crook, do you
think you'd live to be my ripe age?

420
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:42,911
Well, I don't see why not.

421
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:48,711
I guess I got it wrong, then.
Seems to me I heard about a guy

422
00:54:48,711 --> 00:54:53,231
just your age that got hit so hard
in the guts it almost killed him.

423
00:54:53,231 --> 00:54:58,341
Well, uh... -That's different...
That doesn't count.

424
00:54:58,341 --> 00:55:00,931
It doesn't really matter, does it?
If I'm getting out...

425
00:55:02,051 --> 00:55:06,141
You're getting out? You're on the
level? You don't need the money.

426
00:55:06,141 --> 00:55:08,271
So why the hell can't I take it?

427
00:55:10,651 --> 00:55:14,021
Lilly, my money wouldn't last
forever. And then what?

428
00:55:14,021 --> 00:55:17,391
You'd be stuck in some other part of
the rackets, with another Bobo Justus

429
00:55:17,391 --> 00:55:20,321
to slap you around and burn
holes in your hand.

430
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:23,451
If you can't change your life now,
when you're still relatively young,

431
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:28,081
how could you do it when you're
say... crowning 50?

432
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:33,591
This way you gotta go
the square route.

433
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:40,591
Send me a card when you got settled,
I could maybe help you out sometimes...

434
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:48,381
Roy... What if I told you
I wasn't really your mother?

435
00:55:49,271 --> 00:55:50,271
That we weren't related?

436
00:55:52,211 --> 00:55:53,241
What?

437
00:55:54,781 --> 00:55:58,981
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Sure you would.

438
00:56:01,071 --> 00:56:02,951
You don't have to tell me.

439
00:56:04,451 --> 00:56:06,491
Now, why would you like that, Roy?

440
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:09,961
What're talking about? Of course
you're my mother. Of course you are.

441
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:16,361
Roy... Roy...
-There's nothing more to talk about.

442
00:56:17,091 --> 00:56:18,411
I want that money, Roy.

443
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,341
I need it.

444
00:56:23,181 --> 00:56:24,721
What do I have to do to get it?
