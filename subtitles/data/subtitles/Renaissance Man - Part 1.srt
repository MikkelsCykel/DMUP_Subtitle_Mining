What’s that, Tom?

583
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:06,950
I think the whole educational
system is in deep trouble.

584
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,960
You see, after their families
let ‘em down, they go to
what’s left of their schools.

585
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,960
The teachers are underpaid.
They’re scared, so they stop teaching.

586
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,970
But that doesn’t stop ‘em from
handing out high school diplomas
like they were toilet paper.

587
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,970
So that means we gotta take ‘em.

588
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,970
Country better shape up soon, though.

589

a handcart. But that’s strictly
between you and me, right?

to show me a real push-up.

-They’ve all got to be good!

-Yes, Drill Sergeant.

-Yeah.
-This is called Hamlet.

Hamlet. Yo, that’s about

by William Shakespeare.

-See that? They killed him.
They killed him. New Yorkers.
-Yeah, yeah.

645
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:51,970
He wrote plays.

646

Plays. You know, like TV.
Without the box.

647

Mmm.

back then or movies.

-Oh, no, Davis, please,

-Leave me alone, Benitez!

-Chill.
-Go ahead.

-Leave him alone, man.

He gets back, and he’s in mourning...

-That’s the incest part.

684
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:17,990
Okay? So, now, Hamlet spends
the rest of the play trying to decide...

685
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:21,950
whether he’s got the guts
to go after his uncle the king...

and avenge his father’s death,
or if he wants to just...

go with the flow and do what his mother
is tellin’ him to do.

-A nighted color.
-She’s tellin’ him not to wear
black, to stop mourning.

-[ Bill ] Right?
-[ Hobbs ] Right.

703
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,970
It says, Let thine eye look like
a friend on Denmark.

704
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,980
Which means she’s sayin’
don’t glare at me as though you hate me.

705

Why should he? His father’s
body’s not cold yet and she’s
given the punnani to UncleJoe.

-[ Montgomery ] Cave boy

Hey, Mr. Bill, when my daddy split
on my mama, he moved in...

with her sister,
who is, of course, my auntie.

means don’t hate me...

why don’t she say don’t hate me?

Yeah, but it’s like, you know, uh--

a certain--

I mean, it doesn’t sound like
anything to me. I don’t get it.

Prepare to uncover.!

1021
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:05,970
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five...

1022
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:07,970
four, three, two, one!

1023
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:10,980
Freeze! I said freeze!

1024
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,980
What was that again?
What time is it?

1025
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:16,980
Drill Sergeant!
Breakfast is at 0600, Drill Sergeant!

1026
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,980
Zero six hundred.
That’s correct.

1027
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:22,990
Which by my reckoning
has come and gone, has it not?

1028
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,990
-Drill Sergeant.! Yes, Drill Sergeant.!
-Hi, Miranda.

1029
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:27,990
[ Cass ] I don’t know. Maybe it’s me.
I just can’t seem to hear ya.

1030
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:30,950
I don’t hear that--

1031
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,960
Benitez! Davis!

1032
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,960
Front and center.!

1033
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,970
You wouldn’t happen
to have the time, would you, Private?

1034
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:50,970
Sorry, Drill Sergeant.
Slight problem with the laundry.

1035
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:54,980
Does this building look
like a Denny’s to you, New York? Huh?

1036
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,980
Show me where it says
breakfast served anytime.

1037
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:09,890
Get on down there and push ten.

1038
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:02,990
Drill Sergeant, it was my fault!

1039
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:04,990
Who was I talkin’ to?
Was I talkin’ to you?

1040
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:07,990
Drill Sergeant, I asked him to help me
find my daddy’s bracelet.

1041
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:09,990
-My daddy! My daddy!
-My daddy sent it--

1042
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:12,950
Your daddy ain’t here, son,
and your daddy can’t help you.

1043
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:15,960
I don’t know if anybody
can help you, high-speed.

1044
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,960
Lou. Lou, go easy on the kid.

1045
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,960
What?

1046
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,960
He’s five minutes late.

1047
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,970
I mean, talk about anal. You must’ve
been toilet-trained at gunpoint.

1048
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,970
[ Stifles Chuckle ]

1049
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:33,980
Come over here.
Come over here.

1050
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,980
-What?
-Come over here. Right here!

1051
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,980
-Take it easy.
-Don’t ever interrupt me when
I’m talkin’ to my soldiers.

1052

01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,980
-He was five minutes late.
-You understand me?

1053
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,990
Man, you been on my bad side since
the day I laid eyes on you.

1054
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:47,990
You better comprehend this.
You better get this down...

1055
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:51,990
-’cause I have had it with
your smug college-boy attitude.
-Yeah?

1056
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:53,950
You listen to me: stay away from me.

1057
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:57,960
And don’t you ever, ever impugn
my authority in front of my soldiers.

1058
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,960
-Now, you got that, man?
-Yeah, I got that.

1059
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,960
-You got it?
That’s point-blank and period.
-Yeah, I got it.

1060
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,970
[ Muttering ]

1061
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:14,970
For the rest of the week,
you’ll show up here nine minutes early.

1062
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:16,980
-You will report here--
-Davis.

1063
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:21,980
Just show up to my class nine minutes
late is all, ya see? No problemo.

1064
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,980
-Oh, that’s it! That is it!
-What?

1065
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,990
-Drill Sergeant!
Drill Sergeant! Calm down.
-What?

1066
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:28,990
Who do you think you are?
You gonna tell me what to do?

1067
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,990
-You’re nothin’. You’re nothin’.
-I’m nothin’?

1068
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:32,990
Did you hear what he said?
I’m nothin’.!

1069
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:35,950
-Come on. Come on. Right here.
-Just let me--

1070
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,960
[ Knocking ] Sir?

1071
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,970
So they finally sent you
to the principal’s office.

1072
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,970
Yeah.

1073
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:50,970
Man could’ve killed you, Mr. Rago.

1074
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:54,970
He would’ve been court-martialed,
but he could’ve killed you.

1075
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:58,980
-He started it.
-I don’t know what happened,
and I don’t care.

1076
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:09,840
All I care about is this program...

1077
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:05,980
and I will not let you, Sgt. Cass
or anybody curtail its chances, okay?

1078
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:09,990
Okay.

1079
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:13,990
You never served in the military,
did you, Mr. Rago?

1080
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:17,950
No, my military experience
is limited to the day...

1081

01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:20,960
that I walked for hours in the rain
from Arlington Cemetery...

1082
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,960
to the White House carrying
the name of a soldier...

1083
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,960
who died needlessly in Vietnam.

1084
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,970
Do you remember the soldier’s name?

1085
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:35,970
No.

1086
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:39,980
Do me a favor, Bill.

1087
