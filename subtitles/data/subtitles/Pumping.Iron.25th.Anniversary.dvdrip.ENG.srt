1
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,578
Come back onto this leg. Weight on this leg.

2
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:25,757
Pull your weight back onto this...
Off that leg.

3
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,957
Onto this leg. Weight back, there you go.

4
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:32,059
Okay, just take with your arm.

5
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:35,428
You wanna slide forward...

6
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,127
and reach with your arm.

7
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,498
And slide back, step back.

8
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,442
- Arnold, do it behind me.
- Reach back with your arm.

9
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,810
And forward.

10
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,815
I'll do this twice, and then I'll come
and look at you and correct you.

11
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:56,350
And back. Now what you want is mobility.

12
00:00:56,423 --> 00:01:01,122
So you want a pass-through position
that will keep showing the body, right?

13
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,094
- So where are your arms?
- Like this.

14
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,563
Start, I would think, with the focus up.

15
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,600
- Looking up?
- Looking up.

16
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,568
That would help... That'll make a nice...

17
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,969
If your eye line goes up there...

18
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,506
- Right.
- Yeah.

19
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,301
That's the idea.

20
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,541
What you have to realize...
Okay, take it a little bit slower.

21
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:25,482
What you have to realize
is that people are watching you all the time.

22
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,112
They're not just watching
you there and there.

23
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,519
Keep it up.

24
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,521
And...

25
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,859
<i>Gold's Gym, Venice, California...</i>

26
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:38,169
<i>where many of the best bodybuilders</i>
<i>in the world come to train.</i>

27
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,265
Jesus Christ!

28
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,107
- That's a sick guy.
- You're back.

29
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,375
- How are you doing?
- All right.

30
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,848
- Big Mac.
- How are you?

31
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,010
- All right.
- Good.

32
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,116
- How you doing?
- You remember Joey?

33
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,519
How you doing?

34
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,624
- Paul.
- I thought you'd forgotten all about me.

35
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,991
I thought you liked me as well.
Thought you'd forgotten all about me.

36
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,622
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're the greatest.

37
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,300
Big Tony, how you doing?

38
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,463
- This is for me?
- Yeah.

39
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,837
- Kenny.
- How you been? Just got back?

40
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:19,810
Can I sign up here?
I want to start gaining some muscles.

41
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:03,682
Come on.

42
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,162
Pumped up, you know.

43
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:54,866
<i>Arnold Schwarzenegger, 28 years old...</i>

44
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,738
<i>6'2", 240 pounds.</i>

45
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:00,668
<i>Mr. Olympia for the past five years.</i>

46
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,180
<i>He is preparing to defend his title</i>
<i>this year for the last time.</i>

47
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,944
All Mr. Universes
from the past five years or so...

48
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,855
get together in one contest to find out
who is the best of all the Mr. Universes.

49
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:16,361
So they created the Mr. Olympia contest,
which is then the top contest.

50
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:18,953
And whoever wins that
is the top bodybuilder.

51
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,090
- And you are the top bodybuilder.
- Right.

52
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,100
How long have you been the top?

53
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,433
I've not been beaten for the last seven years.

54
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:28,132
And...

55
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:31,533
I won the Mr. Olympia contest
five years now.

56
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,202
This is now the sixth year.

57
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:35,542
- They score on points?
- Yeah, on points.

58
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:40,176
It's like judging the body
by muscularity, and by proportion...

59
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,377
symmetry, the whole thing.

60
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,213
Do you visualize yourself
as a piece of sculpture?

61
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,917
Yeah, definitely.

62
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:51,093
Good bodybuilders have the same mind...

63
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,688
when it comes to sculpting,
than a sculptor has.

64
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:56,700
If you analyze it,
you look in the mirror and you say:

65
00:08:56,768 --> 00:09:01,171
"I need more deltoids, more shoulders,"
so you get the proportions right.

66
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,435
So what you do is you exercise...

67
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:05,601
and put those deltoids on.

68
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:09,670
Whereas an artist
would just slap on some clay on each side.

69
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:12,683
Does it, maybe, the easier way.
We go through a harder way...

70
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:15,219
because you have to do it on a human body.

71
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:17,653
I mean, obviously a lot
of people look at you...

72
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,624
and they think it's kind of strange,
what you're doing.

73
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:23,752
But those are the people
who don't know much about it.

74
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,593
As soon as you find out
what the whole thing is about...

75
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:28,496
then it's just like another thing.

76
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:32,401
It's not any stranger as going into a car...

77
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,929
and trying to go in a quarter mile,
five seconds.

78
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,702
I mean, that's, for me, strange.

79
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,399
<i>The greatest feeling you can get in a gym...</i>

80
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,566
<i>or the most satisfying feeling</i>
<i>you can get in a gym, is the pump.</i>

81
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,436
<i>Let's say you train your biceps.</i>

82
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:16,242
<i>Blood is rushing into your muscles,</i>
<i>and that's what we call the pump.</i>

83
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,647
<i>Your muscles get a really tight feeling...</i>

84
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:21,311
<i>like your skin is going to explode</i>
<i>any minute.</i>

85
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:24,719
<i>It's really tight, it's like somebody</i>
<i>blowing air into your muscle.</i>

86
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,726
<i>It just blows up and it feels different.</i>
<i>It feels fantastic.</i>

87
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:38,701
<i>It's as satisfying to me as coming is.</i>

88
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,739
<i>As having sex with a woman and coming.</i>

89
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,205
<i>So can you believe</i>
<i>how much I'm in heaven?</i>

90
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,876
I'm getting the feeling of coming in the gym.
I'm getting the feeling of coming at home.

91
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:52,917
I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage
when I pump up...

92
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,421
when I pose out in front of 5,000 people,
I get the same feeling.

93
00:10:56,488 --> 00:11:00,049
I'm coming day and night.
I mean it's terrific, right?

94
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:03,153
So, you know, I'm in heaven.

95
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,271
All right, got to do that.

96
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:21,636
This girl maybe didn't have a kiss for years.
I may as well give her a break.

97
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,277
<i>Terminal Island, California...</i>

98
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,917
<i>a federal prison for men and women.</i>

99
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,882
I wanna get me a kiss.

100
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,635
I heard about those guys in here.

101
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,699
Yeah, we got a few of them.

102
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,410
Come over here and I'll give you your kiss.

103
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:08,522
Yes, I got this pose.

104
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:10,891
He's got a beautiful body, man.

105
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,231
First time I ever seen
somebody's arms 23 inches.

106
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:19,098
He's a big dude, all the way big dude.

107
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:30,447
<i>I started reading about gaining weight</i>
<i>and weightlifting in some magazines.</i>

108
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:32,813
<i>And I saw Arnold's picture.</i>

109
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,782
<i>And when I saw him from all those angles...</i>

110
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:38,652
<i>every angle those shots were taken from,</i>
<i>he looked good.</i>

111
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:41,453
<i>And I said, "That's the way I wanna look."</i>

112
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,352
My father's real tall and I'm short,
so at least...

113
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:47,432
if I can't get as tall as he is,
I wanna be as wide as he was.

114
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:48,262
If I can't get as tall as he is,
I wanna be as wide as he was.

115
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:51,593
Make one line. Try to make one line straight.

116
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:54,502
So you always remember
that you have to have a line.

117
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:56,965
Yeah, see now there's your line.

118
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,667
And look where you point.

119
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:01,937
Yeah.

120
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:04,474
Great.

121
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:09,417
I like what you had in <i>Ironman</i>.

122
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,153
Yeah, that's good.

123
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:19,488
Again, raise up the hand.

124
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,157
Remember one thing, when you pose...

125
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:25,964
a lot of little guys have one habit.

126
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:28,028
And they hide away when they pose.

127
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:31,097
When they do an arm pose, they do like this.

128
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:33,803
The big guy will come right out
with his arm.

129
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:37,814
Never do that, never hide away.
Like right now, you did like this.

130
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:41,508
You know, show them.
Show them the whole thing.

131
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:44,247
Make the move, open up the whole body.

132
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:47,752
Do the same thing again.

133
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:49,224
Yeah, great.

134
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:51,824
Look confident, yeah.

135
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,254
Good.

136
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:43,413
Yeah, do it!

137
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:03,632
Just pose slowly, good.

138
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:05,625
They'll go nuts.

139
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:08,035
Crowd's good tonight. Is it?

140
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:12,935
Close that arm more. Good.

141
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:16,207

00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:39,168
How about a "most muscular"
in the front, like this, Michelle?

148
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:40,794
Like this, hands down.

149
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:43,533
Michael, show her the most muscular.
Good girl.

150
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:47,567
That's a girl.

151
00:15:47,645 --> 00:15:49,772
- Can you do that?
- I can do that one, dad.

152
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:52,645
All right, you do that one.
Go ahead, one arm.

153

That's a boy, it's hard.

154
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,510
Feel this muscle, how hard that is, Michelle.

155
00:15:57,588 --> 00:15:59,146
Feel up here, right here.

156
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:01,648
Isn't that hard? Yeah.

157
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:03,421
- Feel mine.
- Feel yours?

158
00:16:03,494 --> 00:16:06,486
She wants you to feel yours,
don't jump on me now. Come on.

159
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:07,929
Feel yours.

160
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:10,829
- Nothing, no muscle.
- Nothing? How about daddy's?

161
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:16,898
- Daddy got a big muscle?
- Yeah.

162
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:20,034
Come on, Mike, ripped,
come on get up, come on.

163
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:21,806
Come on.

164
00:16:24,415 --> 00:16:25,507
Good.

165
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:28,977
Get up.

166
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:30,611
Up.

167
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:32,549
Come on, up.

168
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:37,927
<i>I can remember back in my life...</i>

169
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:42,159
<i>when I would be picked on quite often.</i>
<i>I'm sure every kid's gone through it.</i>

170
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:46,169
<i>But it just affected me more than,</i>
<i>I think, it would affect other people.</i>

171
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:49,397
<i>"Hey, four eyes, hey, cross-eyes."</i>

172
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,504
<i>"You got rusty fenders on your bicycle."</i>

173
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:54,703
<i>"Your bike isn't as good as our bike."</i>

174
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,144
<i>"Hey, Jew boy."</i>

175
00:16:56,213 --> 00:16:59,148
<i>Or, "You're not Catholic,</i>
<i>so you're no good. "</i>

176
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:04,247
<i>I can remember times</i>
<i>when kids would be going to dances...</i>

177
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:07,586
<i>and I would leave a dance,</i>
<i>like, 11:00 at night.</i>

178
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:11,150
<i>I'd leave a dance for no reason</i>
<i>and say, "I'll show them."</i>

179
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:14,595
<i>And go and run on a track</i>
<i>for two or three hours.</i>

180
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:16,792
<i>Or go home and lift weights.</i>

181
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:21,795
<i>I got involved in all the peewee sports</i>
<i>most kids play, hockey and so forth.</i>

182
00:17:21,872 --> 00:17:23,703
<i>Then when I got into high school...</i>

183
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:26,402
<i>and I made all-state</i>
<i>and all-American in football.</i>

184
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:32,273
<i>I was doing very well with the Jets</i>
<i>until I got injured.</i>

185
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:37,154
<i>That was my biggest thing, to go</i>
<i>on a football field and be so feared.</i>

186
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:41,021
<i>I wanted to be put in a cage</i>
<i>and rolled out, like in a circus.</i>

187
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:45,586
<i>Big bars with chains and everything.</i>
<i>And then just hope like hell...</i>

188
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:48,689
<i>that everybody would run off the field</i>
<i>when they saw me coming.</i>

189
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:51,496
<i>Let's give him a big welcome, Mike Katz.</i>

190
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:21,625
<i>In every contest I ever won...</i>

191
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:24,833
<i>or ever lost, I always got</i>
<i>the most applause...</i>

192
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:27,427
<i>and the people were most for me.</i>

193
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:35,105
<i>When I went to the Mr. Universe</i>
<i>contest in '72...</i>

194
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:37,909
<i>and in '73 and in '74...</i>

195
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:40,678
<i>I knew, even though</i>
<i>I didn't win the contest...</i>

196
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:44,414
<i>when I go to South Africa this year,</i>
<i>I'm sure the same thing is gonna happen.</i>

197
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:46,149
<i>The crowd is gonna be for me.</i>

198
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:03,272
<i>The contests in South Africa, in Pretoria...</i>

199
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:08,173
are the most important or prestigious
amateur contests in the world...

200
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:10,679
the IFBB Mr. Universe contest...

201
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:13,615
which is amateur, open to amateur athletes.

202
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:16,278
Sort of along the guidelines
of the Olympics.

203
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:18,821
And the other contest
is a professional contest...

204
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:22,655
open to professionals,
because there's money prizes involved...

205
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:24,626
and that's called the Mr. Olympia.

206
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:28,654
So I'll be competing in the Mr. Universe,
since I am an amateur.

207
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,093
And...

208
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:34,428
as I see it, from all of the people
who I know who are gonna be there...

209
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:36,530
and the best in the world will be there...

210
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:40,509
I feel it's gonna be between
me and Ken Waller...

211
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:42,939
for the overall championship.

212
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:48,377
I told you boys, I'm the quarterback.

213
00:19:56,794 --> 00:20:01,128
I don't worry about Mike Katz, anyway.
The only one guy I worry about is Robbie.

214
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,395
He's good, but he lacks too many things.

215
00:20:05,603 --> 00:20:08,071
His arms aren't big enough
to match his chest.

216
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:10,300
His thighs are too big for his calves.

217
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:12,441
He hits one pose.

218
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,701
In that, he looks like a big spider.

219
00:20:14,812 --> 00:20:18,680
What I'm gonna do when I get to Africa?
I'm gonna take Katz's shirt and hide it.

220
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:21,513
I'm gonna take everything I can find
of his and hide it.

221
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,383
Mess his mind up a little bit.

222
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:37,157
<i>Gonna be according to countries</i>
<i>in alphabetical order.</i>

223
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:41,902
<i>Australia.</i>

224
00:20:43,941 --> 00:20:47,342
We need Australia.
Will you get your clan together, please?

225
00:20:47,511 --> 00:20:49,945
Baghdad, Bahamas.

226
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:53,440
Tall man calls Mike Katz, USA.

227
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:57,282
I don't think there's much doubt.
Mike? All right.

228
00:21:52,877 --> 00:21:54,469
<i>Ken Waller, USA.</i>

229
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,984
You didn't see a blue T-shirt around?

230
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:13,087
Paul, you see a blue T-shirt
around with my crusher?

231
00:22:13,964 --> 00:22:15,397
- Waller had it.
- He had it?

232
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:16,956
- Yeah.
- Where did he put it?

233
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:19,298
I don't know where he put it, Mike.

234
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:43,417
<i>Number 89,</i>
<i>from the United States of America...</i>

235
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:47,128
<i>Mike Katz.</i>

236
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:13,246
<i>It took me five years to win Mr. Connecticut.</i>

237
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:16,622
<i>It took me four years to win Mr. America.</i>

238
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:20,820
<i>This is my fifth year</i>
<i>that I've been trying to win Mr. Universe.</i>

239
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:23,093
<i>I'm not a quitter.</i>

240
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:28,131
<i>It's like a dog. You can kick a dog so long</i>
<i>and it will do two things.</i>

241
00:23:28,205 --> 00:23:30,833
<i>It's either gonna roll over and die...</i>

242
00:23:31,175 --> 00:23:33,803
<i>or it's gonna bite you and attack you.</i>

243
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:38,244
<i>And I'm the kind of person who's</i>
<i>the type of a dog who would bite back.</i>

244
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:40,644
<i>I wasn't gonna roll over and quit.</i>

245
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:58,967
19, 16, 17, 16, 17.

246
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:01,965
85.

247
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:07,101
<i>Next one, 18, 18, 17, 18, 18.</i>

248
00:24:07,211 --> 00:24:10,578
<i>- 83.</i>
<i>- 83? That can't be right.</i>

249
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:18,781
<i>It's a nine, yes.</i>

250
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:25,290
<i>17, 13, 16, 14, 11.</i>

251
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:28,563
<i>That's a four.</i>

252
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:32,335
<i>Yes, 13, 16, 14, 11.</i>

253
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:34,598
<i>- Total.</i>
<i>- 62.</i>

254
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:53,779
<i>Will the following gentlemen step forward?</i>

255
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:57,294
<i>They are the three finalists,</i>
<i>not necessarily in order.</i>

256
00:24:57,695 --> 00:24:59,287
<i>Ken Waller, USA.</i>

257
00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:08,365
<i>Paul Grant, Wales.</i>

258
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:16,880
<i>Roger Walker, Australia.</i>

259
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:26,152
<i>And for your information...</i>

260
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:29,522
<i>the fourth-place winner</i>
<i>was in fact Mike Katz.</i>

261
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:38,765
<i>Can you believe the tension</i>
<i>with these fellas?</i>

262
00:25:38,836 --> 00:25:41,270
<i>It's bad enough for you,</i>
<i>how must it be for them?</i>

263
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:44,239
<i>So far, they made it, they made the big one.</i>

264
00:25:44,575 --> 00:25:46,475
<i>They won the 1975...</i>

265
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:48,705
<i>IFBB Mr. Universe.</i>

266
00:25:58,055 --> 00:26:01,252
I wonder what time it is back
in the States, do you know?

267
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:03,293
I've gotta call my wife.

268
00:26:05,596 --> 00:26:07,496
- It's about 5:00.
- Good.

269
00:26:08,465 --> 00:26:11,491
The kids ought to be playing,
driving her crazy.

270
00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:16,665
<i>Third place in the tall man category...</i>

271
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,208
<i>IFBB, Mr. Universe...</i>

272
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:24,213
<i>from Wales, Paul Grant.</i>

273
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,082
<i>Second place...</i>

274
00:26:38,862 --> 00:26:41,456
<i>from Australia, Roger Walker.</i>

275
00:26:47,404 --> 00:26:50,464
<i>And the winner of the 1975</i>
<i>tall man category...</i>

276
00:26:50,674 --> 00:26:53,666
<i>from the United States of America,</i>
<i>Ken Waller.</i>

277
00:26:55,746 --> 00:26:57,805
Kenny won. Great.

278
00:26:58,782 --> 00:27:00,044
Terrific.

279
00:27:00,351 --> 00:27:01,875
How about that?

280
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:03,951
Boy, that's fantastic.

281
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,021
Fantastic.

282
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:13,393
I can imagine how he must feel.

283
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:15,129
Incredible.

284
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,929
Probably like I did when I was 16
and won my first trophy.

285
00:27:20,637 --> 00:27:23,504
In its own way,
it's probably just as satisfying.

286
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:28,274
I gotta go shake his hand,
that's fantastic, great.

287
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:31,442
And get my T-shirt.

288
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:39,888
<i>Suffice to say the other two gentlemen won</i>
<i>their height categories...</i>

289
00:27:39,957 --> 00:27:41,219
<i>made the finals...</i>

290
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:44,283
<i>and our overall winner for 1975,</i>
<i>Ken Waller...</i>

291
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:46,352
<i>United States of America.</i>

292
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:15,122
- Want another pose?
- Yeah, just keep going.

293
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:24,235
Wait a second.

294
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:44,549
<i>My parents in the beginning,</i>
<i>when I started bodybuilding...</i>

295
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,022
<i>they didn't know really what it is...</i>

296
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:49,616
<i>until I introduced my father</i>
<i>to bodybuilding...</i>

297
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:51,627
<i>and I took him to all the gymnasiums.</i>

298
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:56,359
<i>And he then started picking up weights,</i>
<i>and making his arms strong and so on.</i>

299
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,492
And then they started liking what I did.

300
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,767
Especially after I won
the first international competition...

301
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,035
<i>which was the first contest I ever entered...</i>

302
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:08,135
<i>the Junior Mr. Europe in Stuttgart, Germany.</i>

303
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:12,672
<i>So when I came home with my trophy,</i>
<i>my parents were very proud of me...</i>

304
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,186
<i>and they said, "My son, that's my son."</i>

305
00:29:17,254 --> 00:29:20,917
<i>My father was a police chief in Austria...</i>

306
00:29:20,991 --> 00:29:22,982
<i>in a town called Graz.</i>

307
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:28,327
<i>We had a very strict upbringing</i>
<i>because of him being with the police force.</i>

308
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,390
<i>We had to be the perfect example.</i>

309
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:32,492
<i>We couldn't do anything bad.</i>

310
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:35,868
<i>And it was kind of an uptight</i>
<i>feeling at home because of it.</i>

311
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:42,509
<i>I always felt like my place is America.</i>
<i>And when I was 10 years old...</i>

312
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:45,844
<i>I only dreamed of coming</i>
<i>to America and being the greatest.</i>

313
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:49,215
<i>And just being different</i>
<i>than everybody else.</i>

314
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:10,663
I never experienced anything like it.

315
00:30:10,741 --> 00:30:13,232
- Open your legs wide, Arnold.
- Open my...

316
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,278
Get a little more power.

317
00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:18,672
- Open your legs a little more.
- Little bit to the right.

318
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:21,115
Don't strain looking up at him.

319
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:24,177
Just put your face, just hug him,
kind of sexy.

320
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,486
Crush it, Arnold.

321
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,554
Bend the exerciser.

322
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:36,892
I thought you were strong.

323
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:39,561
Put your legs behind his back a bit,
could you?

324
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:41,399
Play with his hair a little.

325
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,497
Sandy, why don't you get down lower...

326
00:30:43,574 --> 00:30:46,099
so that your head is down
closer to the floor.

327
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:48,007
That's it, right.

328
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:50,012
Okay, here we go.

329
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,847
Good, hold.

330
00:30:53,817 --> 00:30:56,615
- You drink skim milk, don't you?
- No, I drink no milk.

331
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:59,178
- You don't drink any milk at all?
- No milk.

332
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:01,718
Milk is for babies.

333
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:04,260
When you grow up, you have to drink beer.

334
00:31:05,963 --> 00:31:09,228
<i>I was always dreaming about</i>
<i>very powerful people.</i>

335
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:12,265
<i>Dictators and things like that.</i>

336
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:15,933
<i>I was just always impressed</i>
<i>by people who could...</i>

337
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,765
<i>be remembered for hundreds of years.</i>

338
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:23,478
<i>Even like Jesus,</i>
<i>being for thousands of years remembered.</i>

339
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:06,578
- I dreamt about Arnold last night.
- Really?

340
00:32:06,657 --> 00:32:09,785
I told him, "Arnold, you're making
a big mistake going to Africa."

341
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,226
He says,
"Why do you say that, Mr. Ferrigno?"

342
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:15,629
I said, "Louie is waiting for you,
in the shadows."

343
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:30,142
<i>Lou Ferrigno, 24 years old,</i>
<i>a former sheet metal worker.</i>

344
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,146
<i>Mr. America, and twice Mr. Universe.</i>

345
00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:37,481
<i>He's turned professional this year,</i>
<i>and is a contender for the Mr. Olympia title.</i>

346
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:41,722
<i>Lou lives with his parents</i>
<i>in Brooklyn, New York.</i>

347
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:56,972
<i>At 6'5" and 275 pounds...</i>

348
00:32:57,374 --> 00:32:59,535
<i>Lou is the largest bodybuilder ever.</i>

349
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,841
<i>And he thinks he can take the title</i>
<i>from Arnold this year.</i>

350
00:33:03,013 --> 00:33:04,742
<i>So does his father, Matty...</i>

351
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:09,081
<i>who retired from the New York City Police</i>
<i>Department to oversee Lou's training.</i>

352
00:33:10,721 --> 00:33:14,714
<i>The first time Arnold came to America,</i>
<i>I took Louie backstage.</i>

353
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:17,191
<i>And when Arnold went by us,</i>
<i>I'll never forget...</i>

354
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:21,220
<i>I looked at Louie's face,</i>
<i>and he just looked at Arnold with awe.</i>

355
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:23,357
<i>I thought God just passed us.</i>

356
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:26,664
<i>And I looked at Louie, I said,</i>
<i>"What do you think, Louie?"</i>

357
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,862
<i>And he looked at me,</i>
<i>he said, "Gee, Dad, he's big."</i>

358
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:35,210
<i>And I would say that from that moment on</i>
<i>when he first saw Arnold...</i>

359
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:37,839
<i>he wanted to be Mr. Olympia.</i>

360
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:42,116
<i>It was in his eye, in his heart,</i>
<i>and in his mind.</i>

361
00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:44,449
<i>And it became part of his entire body.</i>

362
00:33:44,521 --> 00:33:45,647
Okay.

363
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,188
- Right, let me complete a full rep.
- Okay.

364
00:33:51,261 --> 00:33:52,421
- One.
- Right.

365
00:33:52,496 --> 00:33:53,428
- Two.
- Right.

366
00:33:53,497 --> 00:33:54,521
Up!

367
00:34:00,871 --> 00:34:02,202
Five.

368
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:04,104
Six.

369
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:05,638
Seven.

370
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:06,869
Eight.

371
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,241
Nine.

372
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:12,243
- Okay, Dad.
- Okay, come on.

373
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,113
Up, come on.

374
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:16,209
Make it harder. All right.

375
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:17,753
Come on.

376
00:34:19,423 --> 00:34:20,822
All the way.

377
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:22,255
All right.

378
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,896
- That was easy.
- Easy?

379
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:40,374
You do one.

380
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:46,245
<i>Louie was only an infant in the crib,</i>
<i>and he developed this ear infection.</i>

381
00:34:46,683 --> 00:34:48,844
<i>We didn't know it at the time...</i>

382
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:52,979
<i>until Louie was about three years old,</i>
<i>we found out that he was hard of hearing.</i>

383
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,825
<i>That's why he never took</i>
<i>an interest in things...</i>

384
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:58,520
<i>other kids would take an interest in,</i>
<i>like television.</i>

385
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:01,291
<i>He was late</i>
<i>learning to speak and everything.</i>

386
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,697
<i>Louie would become a lip reader.</i>

387
00:35:06,336 --> 00:35:07,894
<i>Louie was a real skinny kid.</i>

388
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:11,270
<i>He couldn't make the football team</i>
<i>because he was too skinny.</i>

389
00:35:11,341 --> 00:35:13,571
<i>Then he started to buy</i> Muscle Magazine.

390
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,939
<i>I remember I would take him</i>
<i>to a bookstore...</i>

391
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:18,481
<i>and he would buy up all</i>
<i>the old muscle books.</i>

392
00:35:18,548 --> 00:35:21,108
<i>And he would read for hours. I remember...</i>

393
00:35:21,184 --> 00:35:24,017
<i>2:00, 3:00 in the morning,</i>
<i>I would find his light on...</i>

394
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:26,385
<i>and he would be reading the muscle books.</i>

395
00:35:27,257 --> 00:35:29,885
<i>So Louie decided</i>
<i>to do a little bodybuilding.</i>

396
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,987
<i>I had an old weightlifting set in the cellar.</i>
<i>I used to do a little bit of it myself.</i>

397
00:35:34,064 --> 00:35:36,692
<i>Never knowing at that time that someday...</i>

398
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:41,397
<i>Louie would be on the stage against Arnold,</i>
<i>in Pretoria, South Africa.</i>

399
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:46,975
You just keep after him.

400
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:50,172
Wherever he goes,
you pose down with him, right next to him.

401
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:53,546
Let the judges make a comparison.
You're 6'5".

402
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:58,350
You'll be the biggest thing that ever went
out on that platform, at 275 pounds.

403
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:02,151
They know that, and he knows it.
This is for the big baby, Louie.

404
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:05,489
This is for all the marbles.
And we're gonna go after it, right?

405
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:10,295
One year of training, all wrapped up
in one night, Louie, remember that.

406
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,161
When you step out there, boy...

407
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:15,568
remember all those grueling nights
and mornings in the gym.

408
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:18,506
And this is it, this is the reward.
And we want it.

409
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:20,839
We want it so bad that we can taste it.

410
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:22,970
Remember that when we're on that stage.

411
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:26,777
We gotta get so excited, when we're there
we have only one thought in mind.

412
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,477
That's the Olympia, we'll win.

413
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:55,266
- How long is Arnold sleeping?
- He's been here for a couple days now.

414
00:36:55,345 --> 00:36:56,937
Yeah, a couple days?

415
00:36:57,013 --> 00:36:59,208
The reason why I woke you up
was because...

416
00:36:59,282 --> 00:37:02,513
I am gonna go to New York tonight.
I did wanna say goodbye.

417
00:37:02,585 --> 00:37:04,951
And I'm gonna see Ferrigno there.

418
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:08,650
We're gonna train for two, three weeks.
And everything...

419
00:37:10,093 --> 00:37:11,685
that I learned from you...

420
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:14,662
that you stole from me, I'm gonna give him.

421
00:37:14,864 --> 00:37:18,800
I figure the combination's gonna be
very hard to beat, Arnold, very hard.

422
00:37:19,536 --> 00:37:21,834
I'll see you when you get back.

423
00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:26,339
What should I tell Louie
when I get to New York?

424
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:29,276
I mean, I am gonna train with him
for a few days.

425
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:31,176
Tell Louie...

426
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:33,913
- that I said hi.
- Yeah?

427
00:37:34,517 --> 00:37:36,917
Say to his father that I said hi.

428
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:41,190
And I'm looking forward
to seeing him in South Africa.

429
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:44,920
- Okay?
- All right.

430
00:37:44,994 --> 00:37:47,189
In other words, you want me to be very nice.

431
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:48,855
- Be very nice to him.
- Okay.

432
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:51,230
Because he needs a lot of help.

433
00:37:51,768 --> 00:37:54,669
- See, the king of the hill can only go down.
- That's right.

434
00:37:54,737 --> 00:37:57,228
- The king of the hill can only go down.
- Or stay up.

435
00:37:57,307 --> 00:37:59,537
- Or stay on that hill.
- Right.

436
00:37:59,776 --> 00:38:01,641
That's the other possibility.

437
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:04,945
But the wolf on the hill...

438
00:38:05,014 --> 00:38:07,005
The wolf on the hill, right...

439
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:10,382
is not as hungry
as the wolf climbing the hill.

440
00:38:10,553 --> 00:38:14,580
That's true, he's not as hungry.
But when he wants the food, it's there.

441
00:38:19,662 --> 00:38:22,495
Biceps, the back, trapezius another thing.

442
00:38:23,132 --> 00:38:27,432
Also, in fact, this evening I'm gonna jog
about a mile and a half, two miles.

443
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:30,431
I think that's a good idea.

444
00:38:35,044 --> 00:38:38,275
- You think we need more weight, Hank?
- Couple more pounds.

445
00:38:38,348 --> 00:38:40,782
All right, good.

446
00:38:43,152 --> 00:38:45,279
Here, we got 10 right here.

447
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:54,589
Come on, let's do 10 good reps, Lou.

448
00:38:55,098 --> 00:38:56,998
10 good reps, come on.

449
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:03,963
- Come on, Lou.
- Come on, Louie.

450
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,268
Come on!

451
00:39:07,176 --> 00:39:09,576
- No more.
- Come on, more!

452
00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:12,074
Good boy. Come on.

453
00:39:12,148 --> 00:39:14,616
- All right, good boy.
- That's the boy, Lou.

454
00:39:18,888 --> 00:39:20,253
Not enough.

455
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,351
One more, same weight, Hank?

456
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:29,398
- I'm not satisfied. I'll put more weight.
- Let's go.

457
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:31,092
I wanna beat him!

458
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:33,161
I need 10 pounds.

459
00:39:33,236 --> 00:39:34,931
- 10 pounds on each side?
- Yeah.

460
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:39,700
- How many, Hank?
- Come on, I wanna see ten.

461
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,108
- Ten!
- You're gonna do them, too.

462
00:39:43,546 --> 00:39:45,741
- You're gonna wipe 'em out!
- I'll do it.

463
00:39:48,084 --> 00:39:50,882
Come on, Lou, push. Drive 'em up.

464
00:39:51,254 --> 00:39:52,778
That's it, man.

465
00:39:53,189 --> 00:39:55,316
You're gonna do it, come on.

466
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:58,088
Arnold!

467
00:40:00,363 --> 00:40:01,421
Six.

468
00:40:02,098 --> 00:40:04,464
Seven. Goddamn, eight.

469
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:06,601
Come on, nine.

470
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:09,796
Suppose you get laid last night.
Keep going, ten. Come on.

471
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,667
Force them out, there's eleven.

472
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:14,909
Come on, Arnold.

473
00:40:14,978 --> 00:40:16,070
Five.

474
00:40:16,746 --> 00:40:17,770
Six.

475
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:20,242
Seven. Come on now. One.

476
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:22,909
Yeah. Two.

477
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:26,188
Three. Come on.

478
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:27,815
Four.

479
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:30,750
- Five.
- Harder!

480
00:40:35,698 --> 00:40:39,862
- Come on, you can do it now.
- I can't concentrate with girls pushing.

481
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,131
Push.

482
00:40:44,674 --> 00:40:46,904
All right, that's it, no more.

483
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,203
- Here's a present.
- What, are you crazy?

484
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:51,041
- Here, come on.
- God.

485
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:55,941
Make those arms grow, man.

486
00:40:56,486 --> 00:40:58,579
Stick them out, stick it out, Louie.

487
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:00,384
Come on, get it up.

488
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:02,215
You do the work.

489
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:03,820
Come on!

490
00:41:17,073 --> 00:41:18,563
Okay, take it.

491
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,573
Oh, my God.

492
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:23,602
- Good boy.
- Nice training.

493
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:24,975
Good boy.

494
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:28,683
Boy, what a workout.

495
00:41:29,952 --> 00:41:31,317
Too hot.

496
00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:34,946
- How do you feel, Lou?
- Pretty good.

497
00:41:35,591 --> 00:41:37,752
Don't ever feel sorry for yourself.

498
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:41,490
Remember, if you're training hard,
he may be training twice as hard.

499
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:44,362
You just gotta keep coming back stronger.

500
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:46,358
Right.

501
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:49,894
All the way, Louie,
you'll never get this chance again.

502
00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:51,335
All the way.

503
00:42:14,363 --> 00:42:17,560
Look like a road map back here
with fingers all over it.

504
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:18,725
Yeah?

505
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:32,306
Yeah, that's getting closer.

506
00:42:52,034 --> 00:42:53,126
Four.

507
00:42:54,704 --> 00:42:55,796
Five.

508
00:42:57,507 --> 00:42:58,565
Six.

509
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:01,169
Seven.

510
00:43:21,063 --> 00:43:22,325
Two more.

511
00:43:25,134 --> 00:43:26,192
One.

512
00:43:27,303 --> 00:43:28,361
Two.

513
00:43:30,105 --> 00:43:31,265
Three.

514
00:43:32,842 --> 00:43:34,742
Four. Keep going.

515
00:43:35,344 --> 00:43:37,141
Five. Keep going.

516
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:39,105
Six.

517
00:43:40,983 --> 00:43:42,143
Seven.

518
00:43:46,922 --> 00:43:48,082
Eight.

519
00:43:48,724 --> 00:43:49,952
Come on.

520
00:43:50,893 --> 00:43:52,554
Let's get serious.

521
00:43:57,533 --> 00:43:58,761
Two more.

522
00:43:59,168 --> 00:44:01,500
Two more, no matter what.

523
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:12,269
One more, Eddie. Flex when you come up.

524
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:13,609
Goddamn.

525
00:44:17,152 --> 00:44:18,551
That's good.

526
00:44:56,592 --> 00:45:00,323
<i>The body that isn't used to</i>
<i>maybe the ninth, tenth...</i>

527
00:45:00,396 --> 00:45:03,092
<i>eleventh, and twelfth rep</i>
<i>with a certain weight.</i>

528
00:45:03,165 --> 00:45:06,965
<i>So that makes the body grow, then.</i>
<i>Going through this pain barrier.</i>

529
00:45:07,036 --> 00:45:10,472
Experiencing pain
in your muscles and aching...

530
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:13,235
and just go on and go on.

531
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:16,176
And this last
two or three or four repetitions...

532
00:45:16,245 --> 00:45:18,372
that's what makes the muscle then grow.

533
00:45:18,447 --> 00:45:22,781
And that divides one from a champion
and one from not being a champion.

534
00:45:22,851 --> 00:45:26,343
If you can go through this pain barrier,
you may get to be a champion.

535
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:28,447
If you can't go through, forget it.

536
00:45:28,524 --> 00:45:31,857
And that's what most people lack,
is having the guts.

537
00:45:32,528 --> 00:45:36,760
The guts to go in and just say, "I'll go
through and I don't care what happens."

538
00:45:36,832 --> 00:45:41,098
It aches, and if I fall down...
I have no fear of fainting in a gym...

539
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,331
because I know it could happen.

540
00:45:43,405 --> 00:45:46,033
I threw up many times
while I was working out.

541
00:45:46,108 --> 00:45:49,202
But it doesn't matter,
because it's all worth it.

542
00:46:06,695 --> 00:46:08,322
<i>Franco Colombu.</i>

543
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:11,888
<i>The premier bodybuilder</i>
<i>in the world under 200 pounds.</i>

544
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:15,036
<i>Five times a contender</i>
<i>for the Mr. Olympia title...</i>

545
00:46:15,104 --> 00:46:17,800
<i>he plans to win it this year from Arnold.</i>

546
00:46:18,607 --> 00:46:21,132
<i>Once the featherweight</i>
<i>boxing champion of Italy...</i>

547
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:24,145
<i>Franco comes from</i>
<i>a small village in Sardinia.</i>

548
00:46:24,213 --> 00:46:27,546
Here, when you want to say,
"Where are you going?"

549
00:46:27,616 --> 00:46:30,483
Somebody says, "Go to hell"
when they get upset.

550
00:46:30,552 --> 00:46:32,986
There they say, "Go to California."

551
00:46:33,055 --> 00:46:35,990
It's like a place where you never get there.

552
00:46:36,225 --> 00:46:39,160
And then finally I came to California, really.

553
00:46:39,795 --> 00:46:43,322
And now when I go back there
and they ask me, "Where you live?"

554
00:46:43,399 --> 00:46:45,196
I say, "In California."

555
00:46:45,267 --> 00:46:48,327
They're not sure if I mean it or if I'm joking.

556
00:47:01,617 --> 00:47:04,177
<i>When I first started doing sports...</i>

557
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,445
<i>my mother used to scream at me.</i>

558
00:47:06,522 --> 00:47:08,820
<i>She used to say, "You don't want to work.</i>

559
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:11,121
<i>"You're just trying to punch people...</i>

560
00:47:11,193 --> 00:47:15,095
<i>"trying to make a living without working."</i>
<i>And she was very much against that.</i>

561
00:47:15,898 --> 00:47:19,857
<i>But right now,</i>
<i>after everything went so good...</i>

562
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:24,867
<i>and I won in sports and I made money...</i>

563
00:47:26,475 --> 00:47:28,602
<i>they are very proud about that.</i>

564
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:16,925
<i>I'm the strongest bodybuilder</i>
<i>that ever lived, I think.</i>

565
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,659
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

566
00:48:19,728 --> 00:48:23,459
<i>the strongest man in the world</i>
<i>is blowing up a hot-water bottle.</i>

567
00:48:23,932 --> 00:48:26,332
<i>That takes 600 pounds of pressure.</i>

568
00:48:28,303 --> 00:48:29,702
It's gonna pop.

569
00:48:51,426 --> 00:48:53,656
- Okay, Franco.
- Lazy bastards.

570
00:48:53,729 --> 00:48:54,855
Look.

571
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,013
I missed it.

572
00:49:14,216 --> 00:49:15,274
Okay.

573
00:49:24,426 --> 00:49:26,189
<i>I met Arnold in Germany.</i>

574
00:49:26,562 --> 00:49:29,929
<i>He came to United States,</i>
<i>I came to United States, also.</i>

575
00:49:30,265 --> 00:49:32,790
<i>We went through many things together.</i>

576
00:49:33,669 --> 00:49:37,969
<i>And now, I will be competing</i>
<i>in the Mr. Olympia with Arnold.</i>

577
00:49:38,574 --> 00:49:40,872
<i>Of course, I think I'm gonna win.</i>

578
00:49:41,009 --> 00:49:43,204
<i>I have more definition...</i>

579
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:45,604
<i>and I'm more muscular.</i>

580
00:49:46,215 --> 00:49:50,242
<i>But Arnold's taller than me,</i>
<i>and that can be one advantage for him.</i>

581
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:52,880
I think I can show the best out there.

582
00:49:52,955 --> 00:49:56,652
The only problem now is matter
of the judges' opinion, too.

583
00:49:57,226 --> 00:50:00,161
You never really know
what's going to happen.

584
00:50:12,408 --> 00:50:13,807
Okay, Louie.

585
00:50:18,147 --> 00:50:19,671
No, listen.

586
00:50:20,282 --> 00:50:23,149
When you come out here
and you're out here...

587
00:50:23,419 --> 00:50:25,614
Right? They're all waiting for you, Louie.

588
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:28,555
They wanna see what you got,
they've never seen you before.

589
00:50:28,624 --> 00:50:30,387
You tense your legs, right?

590
00:50:30,459 --> 00:50:31,983
Then you look at the crowd.

591
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:34,859
They're all looking at you.
Flashbulbs going off and all.

592
00:50:35,397 --> 00:50:37,456
Then you put your arms like this.

593
00:50:37,533 --> 00:50:40,934
You look at your arms
like you're admiring, right?

594
00:50:41,003 --> 00:50:44,234
You're admiring what you're gonna
show them. And then you go...

595
00:50:44,306 --> 00:50:45,773
Boom! Like you're saying:

596
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:47,638
"Take a look at this hunk of man."

597
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:49,735
Something like that. You try it now.

598
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:56,074
Look up, that's right.

599
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:59,319
That's it. No, down here, Louie.

600
00:50:59,388 --> 00:51:02,084
I told you, look at your arms down here.

601
00:51:02,258 --> 00:51:03,384
Look at both arms.

602
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:04,949
- Both arms?
- Right.

603
00:51:05,027 --> 00:51:06,551
That's it.

604
00:51:06,695 --> 00:51:07,889
Atta boy.

605
00:51:07,963 --> 00:51:09,260
Now hold that pose.

606
00:51:09,331 --> 00:51:11,925
Because remember,
your arms are bigger than Arnold's.

607
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:13,662
They wanna see them, right?

608
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:16,364
They have never seen your arms.
They've seen Arnold's.

609
00:51:16,438 --> 00:51:17,905
So hold that pose a while.

610
00:51:17,973 --> 00:51:20,965
And I say, this pose,
just tilt your body a little...

611
00:51:21,043 --> 00:51:23,341
because people on this side of the theater...

612
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:25,846
and people on this side wanna see you.

613
00:51:25,914 --> 00:51:29,680
So tilt your body just slightly like this.
Try that, Lou.

614
00:51:32,054 --> 00:51:32,986
Atta boy.

615
00:51:33,055 --> 00:51:37,549
<i>You have to do everything possible to win.</i>
<i>You know, no matter what.</i>

616
00:51:38,727 --> 00:51:41,491
The day of the contest,
if he comes in his best shape...

617
00:51:41,563 --> 00:51:43,531
and he's equally as good as I am...

618
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,591
or if, let's say,
he's a few percent better than I am...

619
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:50,964
I spend with him one night.

620
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,903
I go downstairs
and book us together in a room...

621
00:51:56,545 --> 00:51:59,105
to help him for tomorrow's contest.

622
00:51:59,715 --> 00:52:00,875
And...

623
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:04,508
that night...

624
00:52:05,888 --> 00:52:07,583
he will never forget.

625
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:11,820
I will mix him up.

626
00:52:12,294 --> 00:52:15,821
He will come so ready
to South Africa, so strong.

627
00:52:15,898 --> 00:52:18,799
But by the time the night is over,
the next morning...

628
00:52:18,867 --> 00:52:20,858
he will be ready to lose.

629
00:52:20,936 --> 00:52:24,736
I mean I will just talk him into that,
it's no problem to do.

630
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:28,733
So, all those things are available.

631
00:52:29,078 --> 00:52:32,070
And if they're available,
you might as well use them.

632
00:52:32,147 --> 00:52:34,980
So it doesn't matter
if he comes in shape, or out of shape.

633
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,747
If he comes out of shape,
at least it's less hassle for me.

634
00:52:38,887 --> 00:52:40,855
And if he's in shape...

635
00:52:41,523 --> 00:52:43,957
Fine, I hope he is.

636
00:52:45,928 --> 00:52:49,329
But you couldn't pull this with Franco.
Franco's pretty smart.

637
00:52:49,398 --> 00:52:52,492
Franco is pretty smart, but Franco is a child.

638
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:58,501
When it comes to
the day of the contest, I'm his father.

639
00:52:59,174 --> 00:53:01,199
He comes to me for advices.

640
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:05,472
So, it's not that hard for me to give him...

641
00:53:07,683 --> 00:53:09,173
the wrong advices.

642
00:53:22,164 --> 00:53:24,064
<i>Pretoria, South Africa.</i>

643
00:53:32,908 --> 00:53:36,571
Probably in an hour or two,
we have a chance to see our room.

644
00:53:38,213 --> 00:53:39,805
10 minutes.

645
00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:43,744
I promise.

646
00:53:43,819 --> 00:53:47,050
Can I just ask you one question?
The usual we ask.

647
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,651
What must your...

648
00:53:51,126 --> 00:53:53,117
special woman look like?

649
00:53:56,532 --> 00:53:58,397
It really doesn't matter.

650
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:02,370
I like them with black hair,
with brown hair, with red hair.

651
00:54:02,438 --> 00:54:06,602
With big breasts, with little breasts,
with big ass, with a little ass.

652
00:54:06,675 --> 00:54:09,701
If the personality is great
and if they're charming...

653
00:54:09,778 --> 00:54:12,611
Wonderful, nothing to do,
just lay out in the sunshine.

654
00:54:12,681 --> 00:54:15,616
Can't wait to get into the sun.
Look at that sun out there.

655
00:54:15,684 --> 00:54:17,015
We ordered it for you.

656
00:54:18,387 --> 00:54:20,082
Watch out now, Lou.

657
00:54:21,857 --> 00:54:24,553
- This is good.
- Get ready.

658
00:54:26,128 --> 00:54:27,789
Holy cow.

659
00:54:28,797 --> 00:54:30,458
He likes the oil.

660
00:54:30,966 --> 00:54:34,663
Hold it up, that a boy, Lou.
Tense your muscles, Louie.

661
00:54:36,038 --> 00:54:37,300
Pull in your stomach.

662
00:54:40,142 --> 00:54:42,508
Sometimes when people ask you advice...

663
00:54:42,578 --> 00:54:46,981
if you think that they're being arrogant,
or misusing the sport of bodybuilding...

664
00:54:47,049 --> 00:54:49,313
you give them kind of pranksterish advice.

665
00:54:49,384 --> 00:54:52,512
And that's once happened
in a Mr. Munich contest, I believe.

666
00:54:52,788 --> 00:54:55,450
I think it was eight years ago...

667
00:54:56,158 --> 00:54:58,922
when some fella came to me
in the gym and said:

668
00:54:59,595 --> 00:55:03,031
"I want to win Mr. Munich.
I am a perfect poser...

669
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:06,190
"and I have a fantastic body.

670
00:55:06,468 --> 00:55:10,234
"And I just want to learn
a new posing routine, a new style.

671
00:55:10,606 --> 00:55:13,336
"Something way out
which nobody expects."

672
00:55:13,675 --> 00:55:17,304
So I said, "Let me see
your posing routine you have right now."

673
00:55:17,379 --> 00:55:20,712
When the guy took his clothes off
and posed for me...

674
00:55:22,084 --> 00:55:25,110
he looked like nothing, number one,
and his posing was bad.

675
00:55:25,187 --> 00:55:28,281
So I mean, he was just...
I think he was crazy.

676
00:55:28,657 --> 00:55:32,024
So I thought, okay,
if he thinks that he's the best poser...

677
00:55:32,094 --> 00:55:35,552
I'm gonna pull a little trick on him.
And so that's what I did.

678
00:55:35,631 --> 00:55:39,294
I said, "Listen, I have a new posing routine
from America.

679
00:55:39,368 --> 00:55:43,361
"I'm in correspondence with
all the top athletes in America." And so on.

680
00:55:43,438 --> 00:55:46,100
And I told him that the new thing is...

681
00:55:46,174 --> 00:55:48,904
that he has to scream while he's posing.

682
00:55:50,112 --> 00:55:51,807
And he looked at me and he says...

683
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,678
"That's a new idea.
That will really come out impressive.

684
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,878
"When you go out on stage and scream,
people can't miss you.

685
00:55:57,953 --> 00:56:00,353
"They'll all look at you screaming, that's it."

686
00:56:00,656 --> 00:56:02,886
So I taught him how to scream.

687
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:04,585
First of all, I oiled him up.

688
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,026
His body, with really heavy oil
and everything.

689
00:56:07,095 --> 00:56:09,154
We're standing there in the shower room.

690
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:11,461
And I taught him how to do it.

691
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:15,669
The higher your arms go up,
the higher you make a screaming noise.

692
00:56:15,737 --> 00:56:19,434
And the lower your arms come down,
the lower the noise.

693
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:22,467
This kind of a thing.

694
00:56:22,544 --> 00:56:25,172
I practiced with him for around two hours.

695
00:56:25,247 --> 00:56:28,842
Spent a lot of time on developing
his new posing routine.

696
00:56:28,917 --> 00:56:31,283
And he mastered it very well.

697
00:56:31,353 --> 00:56:35,050
He was screaming really loud
and high and low.

698
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:38,487
And he went to the Mr. Munich contest.

699
00:56:38,594 --> 00:56:42,394
I told him when he walks out,
he has to scream loud, run out.

700
00:56:43,532 --> 00:56:44,863
And so he did.

701
00:56:44,933 --> 00:56:47,401
And obviously people weren't ready
for that at all.

702
00:56:47,469 --> 00:56:49,664
And so, he went out there, screamed loud.

703
00:56:49,738 --> 00:56:52,298
Went through three or four poses
with loud screaming.

704
00:56:52,374 --> 00:56:54,842
They carried him off the stage
and threw him out.

705
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:56,969
They thought the guy was totally nuts.

706
00:57:56,871 --> 00:57:58,634
I'm shaking, really.

707
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:07,741
But when I get there,
I think I'll forget about it.

708
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,650
- Forget about it?
- Yeah.

709
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:14,879
When I get there, I'm even more nervous.

710
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:18,090
I'm not nervous at all.

711
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,825
Thank you.

712
00:58:21,128 --> 00:58:22,618
Jesus Christ.

713
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:25,294
- Take it easy.
- What can I say?

714
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:28,502
You guys are psyching me out here
early in the morning.

715
00:58:30,004 --> 00:58:33,201
- The only way to do it.
- Lay down in the bus in the back.

716
00:58:33,274 --> 00:58:36,573
Hey, Lou. Is this the master plan
here this morning?

717
00:58:36,644 --> 00:58:38,578
Right, be on guard.

718
00:58:38,646 --> 00:58:42,673
I'm here now for six days
and nobody invited me for breakfast.

719
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:47,312
This morning they say, "Come for breakfast
with us, Arnold, have a nice breakfast."

720
00:58:48,189 --> 00:58:51,488
He's talking about pumping up.
He's talking about psyching me out.

721
00:58:51,592 --> 00:58:53,583
She's talking about my mother.

722
00:58:54,762 --> 00:58:56,923
You're the king of kings, Arnold.

723
00:59:00,501 --> 00:59:03,061
Shit. He's rubbing it in.

724
00:59:07,241 --> 00:59:08,799
How are you doing, Lou?

725
00:59:08,876 --> 00:59:10,400
- How you doing?
- Good.

726
00:59:10,478 --> 00:59:12,571
Look kind of worried today.

727
00:59:12,913 --> 00:59:15,245
Just a little tired, gotta wake up.

728
00:59:15,316 --> 00:59:18,149
- They don't come nicer than you, Arnold.
- I'm a nice guy.

729
00:59:18,219 --> 00:59:22,622
I wouldn't turn my back on you, Arnold,
within 500 yards.

730
00:59:24,558 --> 00:59:26,355
You don't trust me, why's that?

731
00:59:26,427 --> 00:59:30,295
They should have the Olympia early on
so we could relax, enjoy the country.

732
00:59:30,364 --> 00:59:33,595
They should have it in a month for him.
He isn't even in shape yet.

733
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:36,761
He didn't get the timing right,
I'm telling you.

734
00:59:37,104 --> 00:59:39,572
A month from now would have been
perfect for you.

735
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,268
But then I'd get bigger, too, again...

736
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:46,009
so doesn't matter, what the hell.
Let's get it over with.

737
00:59:47,414 --> 00:59:50,406
And if you retire this year,
you just never had the Olympia.

738
00:59:50,484 --> 00:59:52,782
But you had twice the Universe,
what the hell.

739
00:59:52,853 --> 00:59:54,343
That's not too bad, either.

740
00:59:54,421 --> 00:59:56,651
You could go on and win the next five years.

741
00:59:56,724 --> 01:00:01,127
It's amazing. Can you imagine
the feeling I have? Six times Mr. Olympia.

742
01:00:01,195 --> 01:00:04,255
I told you,
you've found the fountain of youth.

743
01:00:04,999 --> 01:00:06,626
You could go on forever.

744
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,726
- It blows my mind when I think about it.
- People are so tired...

745
01:00:09,803 --> 01:00:12,499
I called my mother yesterday already
and I said, "I won."

746
01:00:12,573 --> 01:00:14,803
She says, "Congratulations, Arnold."

747
01:00:15,543 --> 01:00:18,137
Anyway, listen, guys, why don't we go?

748
01:00:18,479 --> 01:00:20,606
You go and help him pump up.

749
01:00:21,849 --> 01:00:26,081
Calm him down, help him. Okay?
Don't screw him up this time.

750
01:00:26,153 --> 01:00:28,587
I don't want you in our pumping room.

751
01:00:33,093 --> 01:00:34,287
<i>Judges.</i>

752
01:00:34,828 --> 01:00:39,231
<i>Final attention,</i>
<i>you all understand our strict code and rule.</i>

753
01:00:39,867 --> 01:00:42,563
<i>No talking whilst adjudicating.</i>

754
01:00:42,736 --> 01:00:46,570
And that also means, photographers,
please do not speak to the judges.

755
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,471
I'll simply will have to remove...

756
01:00:48,542 --> 01:00:52,774
<i>Most of the judging at an international</i>
<i>competition takes place during the day...</i>

757
01:00:52,846 --> 01:00:56,407
<i>before the crowds and distractions</i>
<i>of the nighttime show.</i>

758
01:00:56,483 --> 01:00:58,075
<i>This is called the prejudging.</i>

759
01:00:58,252 --> 01:01:00,015
Double biceps, rear.

760
01:01:00,854 --> 01:01:02,845
<i>The judges look for three things:</i>

761
01:01:02,923 --> 01:01:07,223
<i>Symmetry, proportion and the size</i>
<i>and clarity of each muscle group.</i>

762
01:01:08,262 --> 01:01:11,254
<i>Olympia contestants</i>
<i>are judged in two classes.</i>

763
01:01:11,332 --> 01:01:13,926
<i>Those over 200 pounds and those under.</i>

764
01:01:14,301 --> 01:01:18,499
<i>At night, the two class winners</i>
<i>will pose off for the overall title.</i>

765
01:01:18,772 --> 01:01:22,435
<i>Each class poses first as a group,</i>
<i>for comparison judging.</i>

766
01:01:23,143 --> 01:01:27,079
<i>Then they come on one at a time</i>
<i>to perform the six compulsory poses...</i>

767
01:01:27,147 --> 01:01:29,012
<i>that show every part of the body.</i>

768
01:01:30,718 --> 01:01:32,208
He's so crazy.

769
01:01:32,586 --> 01:01:34,144
What a monster.

770
01:01:34,321 --> 01:01:35,720
Oh, my God.

771
01:01:36,557 --> 01:01:38,855
These guys are like animals, man.

772
01:01:38,926 --> 01:01:41,326
I can't believe it. Look at this one now.

773
01:01:41,428 --> 01:01:44,192
See, this is the hard part right here,
look at that.

774
01:01:49,436 --> 01:01:51,495
And your lats from the rear.

775
01:01:52,473 --> 01:01:54,464
What's he got? Let's see.

776
01:01:57,177 --> 01:01:59,543
You can call him "the bat" from now on.

777
01:01:59,647 --> 01:02:02,275
- "Franco the bat."
- He could fly with that.

778
01:02:05,819 --> 01:02:08,219
Finish with the left side chest...

779
01:02:09,156 --> 01:02:11,090
and your optional routine.

780
01:02:15,462 --> 01:02:17,157
Nice shot, goddamn it.

781
01:02:17,231 --> 01:02:20,064
That guy...
It gives you chills when you watch that guy.

782
01:02:20,134 --> 01:02:23,035
I know. Isn't it unbelievable?

783
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,573
Look.

784
01:02:27,841 --> 01:02:32,369
<i>Ed Corney, a 44-year-old nightclub owner</i>
<i>originally from Hawaii.</i>

785
01:02:32,913 --> 01:02:36,747
<i>He is Franco's chief competition</i>
<i>in the under-200-pound class.</i>

786
01:02:38,285 --> 01:02:40,014
Can you believe that?

787
01:02:41,555 --> 01:02:44,888
I mean, that's what I call posing.

788
01:02:50,064 --> 01:02:52,794
Okay, turn to your right,
Serge, face that way.

789
01:02:54,735 --> 01:02:57,226
Turn right on. Look straight ahead.

790
01:02:58,272 --> 01:03:00,536
That's it. That's the position we want.

791
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:04,407
<i>An unexpected entry</i>
<i>in the tall class of the Olympia contest.</i>

792
01:03:04,511 --> 01:03:07,309
<i>Serge Nubret, 41 years old.</i>

793
01:03:07,481 --> 01:03:09,312
<i>Six feet, 200 pounds.</i>

794
01:03:09,883 --> 01:03:13,250
<i>Mr. France,</i>
<i>and a movie and television star in Europe.</i>

795
01:03:31,004 --> 01:03:34,201
Don't lean back too much,
you get wrinkles in the back.

796
01:03:35,876 --> 01:03:37,969
- Don't go back too much.
- All right.

797
01:04:34,468 --> 01:04:35,799
Okay, thank you.

798
01:04:51,385 --> 01:04:53,080
Your back was out of sight.

799
01:04:54,321 --> 01:04:55,948
Your back, fantastic.

800
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,418
Do I need more arm?

801
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:04,391
Louie, you should've
did this one for your arms.

802
01:05:04,865 --> 01:05:07,425
They called it. I didn't wanna look small.

803
01:05:07,834 --> 01:05:09,461
You mean this one?

804
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:11,101
No. You're wrong.

805
01:05:11,171 --> 01:05:13,332
- Okay.
- Look, looks like nothing.

806
01:05:13,407 --> 01:05:17,241
The arms are important. You've got arms,
and he's got spaghetti arms, Louie.

807
01:05:31,892 --> 01:05:33,860
<i>I don't have any weak points.</i>

808
01:05:35,696 --> 01:05:38,130
<i>I had weak points a few years ago.</i>

809
01:05:38,398 --> 01:05:42,198
<i>But my main thing in mind is...</i>

810
01:05:42,269 --> 01:05:45,466
<i>My goal always was to even out everything...</i>

811
01:05:45,539 --> 01:05:48,633
<i>to the point that everything is perfect.</i>

812
01:05:48,942 --> 01:05:52,469
<i>Which means if I want to increase</i>
<i>one muscle a half inch...</i>

813
01:05:52,546 --> 01:05:54,480
<i>the rest of the body has to increase.</i>

814
01:05:54,548 --> 01:05:57,745
<i>I would never just</i>
<i>make one muscle increase or decrease.</i>

815
01:05:57,851 --> 01:06:00,217
<i>Because everything fits together now.</i>

816
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:04,256
<i>And all I have to do now is get</i>
<i>my posing routine down more perfect...</i>

817
01:06:04,324 --> 01:06:06,724
<i>which is almost impossible to do.</i>

818
01:06:07,627 --> 01:06:09,458
<i>It's perfect already.</i>

819
01:06:09,596 --> 01:06:12,224
Yeah, it's down to a point.

820
01:06:12,399 --> 01:06:14,162
Wait when you see it.

821
01:07:15,429 --> 01:07:16,589
Relax.

822
01:07:29,776 --> 01:07:31,437
Thank you, Arnold.

823
01:07:36,216 --> 01:07:37,683
If you want to be a champion...

824
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:42,120
you cannot have any kind of an outside
negative force coming in and affect you.

825
01:07:42,722 --> 01:07:47,125
Let's say before a contest,
if I get emotionally involved with a girl...

826
01:07:47,194 --> 01:07:49,788
that can have a negative effect on my mind...

827
01:07:49,863 --> 01:07:53,856
and therefore destroy my workout.
So I have to cut my emotions off...

828
01:07:53,934 --> 01:07:57,927
and be kind of cold, in a way,
before a competition.

829
01:07:58,004 --> 01:08:00,529
That's what you do
with the rest of the things.

830
01:08:00,607 --> 01:08:04,509
If somebody steals my car
outside of my door right now...

831
01:08:04,711 --> 01:08:07,271
I don't care. I can't be bothered with that.

832
01:08:07,347 --> 01:08:11,807
I would only have my secretary call
the insurance agency and laugh about it.

833
01:08:11,885 --> 01:08:15,412
Because I cannot be bothered with it.
I trained myself for that.

834
01:08:15,522 --> 01:08:18,958
To be totally cold
and not have things go into my mind.

835
01:08:19,059 --> 01:08:22,324
And it was, in a way, a sad story...

836
01:08:23,196 --> 01:08:24,993
when my father died.

837
01:08:25,932 --> 01:08:29,493
Because my mother called me
on the phone, and she said:

838
01:08:31,104 --> 01:08:32,537
"Your dad died."

839
01:08:32,606 --> 01:08:35,598
And this was exactly two months
before a contest.

840
01:08:35,709 --> 01:08:38,940
She says, "You come home to the funeral?"
I said, "No.

841
01:08:39,012 --> 01:08:42,209
"It's too late, he's dead,
there's nothing to be done.

842
01:08:44,818 --> 01:08:46,843
"And I'm sorry, I can't come."

843
01:08:46,953 --> 01:08:50,354
And I didn't explain to her
really the reasons why.

844
01:08:50,423 --> 01:08:54,689
I had other excuses to her,
because how do you explain a mother...

845
01:08:54,761 --> 01:08:57,628
whose husband died, you know, your trip?

846
01:08:57,797 --> 01:08:59,594
I didn't bother with it.

847
01:08:59,666 --> 01:09:03,932
And that actually caused
one of the greatest conflicts...

848
01:09:05,172 --> 01:09:08,073
with my girlfriend.
Because she just looked at me and said:

849
01:09:08,141 --> 01:09:09,802
"It doesn't bother you?

850
01:09:09,876 --> 01:09:12,606
"I mean, your father died."

851
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:16,073
I never talk about it again.

852
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:25,383
<i>The finals of the Mr. Olympia contest.</i>

853
01:09:25,892 --> 01:09:28,986
<i>First to be judged</i>
<i>is the under-200-pound class.</i>

854
01:09:59,226 --> 01:10:01,717
He said 20 minutes from now, right?

855
01:10:08,168 --> 01:10:10,693
- Take your time, you got all the time.
- Yeah.

856
01:10:16,343 --> 01:10:20,109
<i>Second place</i>
<i>in the under-200-pound category...</i>

857

<i>from the United States of America, via Italy...</i>

862

<i>Franco Columbu!</i>

863
01:10:58,851 --> 01:11:00,819
What did you say, Louie?

864
01:11:01,955 --> 01:11:04,014
- What did you say?
- I'm training, Arnold.

865
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:06,957
- Gotta get a good pump.
- You make too much noise.

866
01:11:07,527 --> 01:11:10,325
Supposed to be very quiet here,
like in a church.

867
01:11:21,074 --> 01:11:22,371
Tell him.

868
01:12:08,121 --> 01:12:10,919
- I can take you.
- Keep looking.

869
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:14,752
- Thanks a lot.
- You've got a better neck.

870
01:12:14,827 --> 01:12:16,021
I know.

871
01:12:42,789 --> 01:12:45,087
- I watch you.
- I watch you, too.

872
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:49,925
There's a barbell above my head,
I better watch it here.

873
01:12:54,434 --> 01:12:55,526
Okay.

874
01:12:56,969 --> 01:12:59,301
We don't want no accidents here.

875
01:13:02,809 --> 01:13:07,246
What symmetry you've got. You look
like something Michelangelo cut out.

876
01:13:08,481 --> 01:13:11,177
More oil, more. That's not good oil.

877
01:13:18,491 --> 01:13:20,584
- Lou, relax.
- Would you?

878
01:13:21,894 --> 01:13:24,488
- Tell them that we're ready.
- We are ready.

879
01:13:25,932 --> 01:13:28,560

<i>From the United States via Austria...</i>

<i>the one and only, Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>

<i>Louie goes through his posing,</i>
<i>and you watch every pose.</i>

891

<i>You sort of help him out, easy now.</i>

892
01:15:31,691 --> 01:15:35,092
<i>Each pose he goes through,</i>
<i>you're living it with him.</i>

893
01:15:40,533 --> 01:15:44,367
<i>I mean, you just have to try</i>
<i>to understand what I'm trying to tell you.</i>

894
01:15:44,437 --> 01:15:46,837
<i>That you're actually</i>
<i>out there with your son...</i>

895
01:15:46,906 --> 01:15:50,171
<i>because you trained with him</i>
<i>and you're posing with him.</i>

896
01:15:50,243 --> 01:15:53,178
<i>The only thing you're not doing with him...</i>

897
01:15:53,246 --> 01:15:55,544
<i>you're not getting</i>
<i>the reward of the applause.</i>

898
01:15:55,615 --> 01:15:58,982
<i>He's the one that's getting that,</i>
<i>and he deserves it.</i>

899
01:15:59,452 --> 01:16:01,716
<i>And you just hope</i>
<i>the audience gives him more.</i>

900
01:16:01,787 --> 01:16:03,948
<i>You wanna shout out,</i>
<i>"It's my son out there!</i>

901
01:16:04,023 --> 01:16:07,959
<i>"Give him just a few more handshakes,</i>
<i>a few more applause. "</i>

902
01:16:08,027 --> 01:16:11,326
<i>And you just hope</i>
<i>that he's the winner, that's all.</i>

903
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:47,893
<i>Third place, from United States of America...</i>

904

<i>Franco and Arnold.</i>

910
01:17:48,094 --> 01:17:50,392
Come on, Franco, give him hell.

911
01:17:52,098 --> 01:17:54,862
- This little guy he's talking about.
- Where is he?

912
01:18:26,599 --> 01:18:27,930
Turn around.

913
01:18:31,036 --> 01:18:32,196
Let's go.

914
01:19:07,273 --> 01:19:10,140
<i>The winner of the 1975...</i>

<i>overall Mr. Olympia...</i>

916
01:19:16,048 --> 01:19:18,642

917
01:19:19,385 --> 01:19:21,285
<i>Arnold Schwarzenegger!</i>

918
01:19:32,565 --> 01:19:35,762
Louie, you're a baby, Lou.
These guys are all veterans.

919
01:19:35,835 --> 01:19:39,327
You're just growing.
This takes years and years.

920
01:19:40,272 --> 01:19:43,901
In two years, Louie,
they'll have never seen anything like you.

921
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:46,977
They'll think you were carved out of stone.

922
01:19:48,581 --> 01:19:50,981
Just gives you
the motivation to train harder.

923
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:52,574
Your day will come, Louie.

924
01:19:52,651 --> 01:19:55,950
Someday you'll have a back,
Louie, nobody ever seen.

925
01:19:56,021 --> 01:20:00,253
So it's no more, because it was
my last year of competition.

926
01:20:00,826 --> 01:20:05,388
I would like to announce officially
I'm retiring from bodybuilding competition.

927
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:08,566
I would like to thank you all
for supporting me.

928
01:20:08,634 --> 01:20:10,625
I would like to thank the judges.

929
01:20:10,836 --> 01:20:13,327
Bodybuilding has been
a beautiful experience for me.

930
01:20:13,405 --> 01:20:15,896
And I will continue it for the rest of my life.

931
01:20:15,975 --> 01:20:19,138
I only stop competing,
but I'm not stopping bodybuilding.

932
01:20:19,211 --> 01:20:21,736
It's the greatest sport. Thank you.

933
01:20:33,692 --> 01:20:36,855
I want to have everybody sing
<i>Happy Birthday</i> to Lou...

934
01:20:36,929 --> 01:20:39,022
because it's Lou's birthday today.

935
01:20:39,098 --> 01:20:41,430
It's Lou's birthday today, too.

936
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:45,164
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

937
01:20:45,237 --> 01:20:48,695
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

938
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:52,568
<i>Happy birthday dear Louie</i>

939
01:20:53,546 --> 01:20:56,913
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

940
01:20:57,082 --> 01:20:58,413
All right!

941
01:20:58,484 --> 01:20:59,849
Speech!

942
01:21:04,657 --> 01:21:07,785
I have nothing to say,
I just wanna eat my cake.

943
01:21:15,434 --> 01:21:18,494
I'm gonna come over and have
a nice meal over at your house.

944
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:20,971
- Some good cheesecake.
- You're gonna come over?

945
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,271
Yeah, I will, when I come back
from Austria, I'm gonna call you.

946
01:21:24,343 --> 01:21:27,369
And she's gonna fix
her nice spaghettis, meatballs...

947
01:21:27,446 --> 01:21:30,438
cheesecake, apple strudel,
the whole business.

948
01:21:30,516 --> 01:21:33,815
Yeah, she says she's gonna
bulk me up to 280 pounds.

949
01:21:37,756 --> 01:21:40,850
And then she's gonna
fix me up with your sister.

950
01:21:43,228 --> 01:21:45,287
I'll talk to him later on.

951
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,600
Louie, he moved over for you, Louie.

952
01:21:57,676 --> 01:21:59,701
Let's put him out, Louie.

953
01:22:12,191 --> 01:22:13,522
Big Louie.

954
01:22:19,832 --> 01:22:22,198
