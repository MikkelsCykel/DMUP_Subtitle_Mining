2
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:16,932
Excuse me, sir.
Yes?

3
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,733
I'm afraid you've come in
the wrong way.

4
00:01:18,768 --> 00:01:20,465
I'm sorry...
This is the old entrance.

5
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,533
The visitor's centre's out
and around to the left.

6
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:25,132
Right, well...
I'll wander over then.

7
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:27,367
Well worth it.
Been through some amazing times.

8
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:29,433
(Murmurs) Yeah.

9
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,400
I believe that this nation
should commit itself

10
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:46,067
to achieving the goal,
before this decade is out,

11
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:47,698
of landing a man on the moon

12
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,566
and returning him safely
to the Earth.

13
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:51,365
SONG: # Come and see
the real thing

14
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,865
# Come and see the real thing
Come and see

15
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,100
# Come and see the real thing
Come and see the real thing

16
00:01:57,135 --> 00:01:58,265
# Come and see

17
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,465
# There's a meaning there

18
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,300
# But the meaning there
doesn't really mean a thing

19
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:03,500
# Come and see
the real thing... #

20
00:02:03,535 --> 00:02:05,100
MAN: Godspeed, John Glenn.

21
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:06,665
# Come and see

22
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,665
# I am the real... #

23
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,667
KENNEDY: We choose to
go to the moon.

24
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,900
We choose to go to the moon
in this decade

25
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:15,065
and do the other things,

26
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,300
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.

27
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:27,900
# Trying hard to understand
but really not just seeing me

28
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:29,065
# There's a meaning there

29
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,300
# But the meaning there
doesn't really mean a thing... #

30
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:33,865
MAN: lgnition sequence starts.

31
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,267
# Come and see the real thing
Come and see

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
# I am the real thing... #
MAN: Tower, clear.

33
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,065
RADIO: 'Apollo 9', you are go...

34
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,900
RADIO: 'Apollo 10',
your trajectory and guidance are go.

35
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:46,700
MAN: Man is about to launch himself
on a trip to the moon.

36
00:02:46,735 --> 00:02:49,100
MAN: Neil Armstrong.
Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin.

37
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,665
Michael Collins.

38
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,300
Next stop for them - the moon.

39
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:53,900
The lunar age is about to begin.

40
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:57,734
# I am not seeing you

41
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,498
# Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. #

42
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,298
When the guy
counts down to zero,

43
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,067
the three astronauts will take off
in 'Apollo 11 ' from America.

44
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,367
And the rocket will fly up to
the moon like this and, er...

45
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:10,565
Landing module.

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,550
Landing module comes off
and lands on the moon.

47
00:03:12,585 --> 00:03:14,500
The astronauts will come out
in their spacesuits,

48
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:16,367
and get shot by martians!
(All scream)

49
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:18,165
Damien...
And their heads will explode!

50
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,033
They'll fly back to Earth
and kill everyone.

51
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:22,433
That's not going to happen.
It might.

52
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,632
Who's next? Graeme?

53
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:26,033
Um, just a minute, Graeme.
Melanie?

54
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:28,400
I haven't done the moon landing.

55
00:03:28,435 --> 00:03:29,598
(Mutters) Thank God.

56
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,867
I've made a model of
the telescope and receiving dish

57
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:33,165
in the town of Parkes.

58
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,965
When astronaut Neil Armstrong
lands on the moon,

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,400
people all over the world
will be watching television pictures

60
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:39,565
provided by the radio telescope
in Parkes.

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,833
WOMAN: Mr Callem,
the Prime Minister wants to see you.

62
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:43,700
Can it wait?
I don't think so.

63
00:03:43,735 --> 00:03:44,898
What's it about?

64
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,400
He's just got off the phone
to the White House.

65
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,967
Do you know
who was on the phone then?

66
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:53,451
No, sir.
The US President.

67
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:54,865
Nixon...
Sorry, sir...

68
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,133
.. thanking me for allowing NASA
to use our facility.

69
00:03:57,168 --> 00:03:58,900
Yes, sir.
And something about an upgrade?

70
00:03:58,935 --> 00:04:00,265
Right.
What's he talking about?

71
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,533
There's a briefing docu...
I don't read those!

72
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:04,065
( BELL RINGS )

73
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,000
Are we raising this?
I think we should.

74
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:07,632
So what's this all about?

75
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,683
The President was referring to
our radio telescope.

76
00:04:09,718 --> 00:04:11,665
Some months ago, NASA requested -
and you approved -

77
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,200
its use in the Apollo program,
originally as a backup receiver.

78
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:15,884
Originally?
They upgraded its role.

79
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,498
When 'Apollo 11 '
gets to the moon,

80
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:19,333
Parkes will now be
the prime receiving station.

81
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:20,965
Meaning?
We've got the moon walk.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,733
Shit. The people at this place -
do they know what they're doing?

83
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:25,967
I believe so.
I bloody well hope so.

84
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:27,565
Why'd they pick us?

85
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,400
It's the largest radio telescope
in the Southern Hemisphere.

86
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:32,867
What's it doing in the middle
of a sheep paddock?

87
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,033
MAN: The Parkes radio telescope,
or, as we call it, the dish,

88
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:44,134
will track 'Apollo 11 '
throughout its journey

89
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,200
gathering voice signals
from the astronauts,

90
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:47,565
telemetry from the spaceship

91
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,867
and then, most importantly,
the TV signals from the moon itself.

92
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:53,565
It's 210 feet in diameter,
it weighs 1,000 tons

93
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,133
and it can be moved to point
in virtually every direction.

94
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:58,267
It's the most powerful
receiving dish in the world.

95
00:04:58,302 --> 00:04:59,465
.. in the world.

96
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,800
Can I have their full names
and specific roles?

97
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:02,998
This is Ross Mitchell.

98
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,700
He's responsible
for manoeuvring the dish.

99
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:05,998
This is Mr Glenn Latham.

100
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:07,665
Glenn's in charge of
all the electronics.

101
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,867
Glenn's a Sagittarius. He enjoys
knitting, flower-arranging...

102
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:11,533
Mitch, I do not!
Don't write that.

103
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:12,732
From NASA, Al Burnett.

104
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:15,733
Al makes sure the signals
get back safely to Mission Control.

105
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:17,867
Enjoying your stay in Australia?
Very much, sir.

106
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:19,967
The people are warm...
And friendly. That's great.

107
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:21,767
And you, Cliff.
What's your official title?

108
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:23,617
Cliff Buxton, director.

109
00:05:23,652 --> 00:05:25,398
Or the 'dishmaster'.

110
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:28,033
OK. Now I just need
a few personal details.

111
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:29,065
You married?
Yeah.

112
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,298
Glenn?
Fiancee, Janine Kellerman.

113
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,067
Mitch! She's not my fiancee.
Local girl.

114
00:05:32,102 --> 00:05:33,365
I don't have a fiancee.

115
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,667
Married.
Two boys, in Houston.

116
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,000
And you, Cliff?

117
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,365
Married.

118
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,700
And just finally,
I mean, no offence,

119
00:05:41,735 --> 00:05:43,332
but when you think about it,

120
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,633
the Americans spent 10 years,
billions of dollars,

121
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:47,665
to let us watch man
walk on the moon,

122
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,900
and in the end it falls
to you blokes. (Laughs)

123
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,665
I mean,
how do you feel about that?

124
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,898
A lot better
before you opened your trap.

125
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:59,133
We feel confident we have
the expertise to complete our role.

126
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:02,767
But, Cliff. I mean,
it's pretty amazing, isn't it?

127
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:06,332
Yes, it is amazing.

128
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,467
And so Australia finds itself
a vital cog

129
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,000
in this grand endeavour.

130
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:11,198
ALL: Hear, hear.

131
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:14,065
Only this morning,
I conveyed to President Nixon

132
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,933
my long-term interest
and commitment to this project.

133
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:20,584
It will be
one of the proudest moments

134
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:23,200
in Australia's
scientific history.

135
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:24,398
ALL: Hear, hear.

136
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:25,732
And I thought it fitting

137
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:28,317
to accept the invitation
of the mayor of Parkes

138
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:30,867
to be there on Monday
and witness first-hand

139
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:32,933
our vital contribution.

140
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:34,367
ALL: Hear, hear.

141
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:35,732
Now THAT is an RSVP.

142
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,467
The Prime Minister
coming to Parkes.

143
00:06:37,502 --> 00:06:39,132
I'll frame that.
The icing on the cake.

144
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:42,067
You know why this means so much?
Helps your political career.

145
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,232
No, Len.
It does.

146
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:44,898
The PM standing with
the candidate.

147
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:46,800
It's all about brownnosing.
Licking arse!

148
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:49,067
No! It's a vindication.

149
00:06:49,102 --> 00:06:50,265
Oh!

150
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,498
Oh, vindication.

151
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:52,732
Vindication of my campaign

152
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,767
to get that dish here
in the first place.

153
00:06:54,802 --> 00:06:55,965
That was an episode!

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,700
You know what people said
when I proposed Parkes?

155
00:06:58,735 --> 00:06:59,898
That you were grandstanding.

156
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:01,767
It's a self-serving stunt
to big-note yourself.

157
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:02,967
Who said that?

158
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:05,465

NEWSREADER: As 'Apollo 11 '
is being readied for launch,

167
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:26,833
NASA is completing final checks
on its deep space network.

168
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:29,367
The vast array of radio telescopes
and cable links

169
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:31,634
all over the world,
including a number in Australia,

170
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:33,867
that will allow communications
with 'Apollo 11 '

171
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:35,065
on its historic journey.

172

AL:.. and it deposits signals
straight to Sydney.

Strip the TV,
send that to Moree...

Sorry, go on.

176

The rest will be sent
to the demodulator

177
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:44,901
at Honeysuckle Creek first.

178

The biomed telemetry feeds -

179
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,833
can we send those
on separate lines?

180
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,165
Mitch?
Yeah, no problem.

181
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,832
AL: OK. Biomed, TM split feeds.

182
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:52,900
It's a big book
you've got there, Al.

183
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:55,332
Hold on.
What is it?

184
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:57,267
These coordinates don't match.
They've been changed.

185
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:58,900
Are you sure?
This is unacceptable.

186
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:01,167
Glenn, come here.

187
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,232
What?

188
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,200
Every coordinate in this book
has been changed.

189
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,932
Yeah?

190
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:08,332
I changed them.

191
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,017
You what?
I changed them.

192
00:08:10,052 --> 00:08:11,632
Why?
Because they were wrong.

193
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,267
Why were they wrong?
I don't know.

194
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:14,965
No, what about them was wrong?

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,300
The figures NASA sent us
were for the Northern Hemisphere.

196
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,532
And we're in
the Southern Hemisphere.

197
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,067
I can change them back,
but you'd point in the wrong...

198
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:26,032
It might be a good idea
to tell us.

199
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:28,200
Oh, sure.
I just didn't want to worry you.

200

201
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,065
No, thank you.

202

MITCH: I'll have one.
Thank you, Glenn.

203
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:37,100

and double-check.

a problem with that.

with that.

That woman...

Can you keep it under your hat?
I don't think so.

This'll be good.

440

00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,983
What's that thing
you put the pump into?

442
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,033
The hole.
Yeah, but it's got a name.

Oh, the valve.

444
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:46,900
The valve is Goldstone,
on the other side is another valve...

445
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,317
Basketballs only have one valve.

446
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:49,700
What's something
with two valves?

447

No, round.

Let's just say it's a basketball
with two valves.

451

When the Goldstone valve
can't see 'Apollo 11 ',

452
00:17:57,468 --> 00:17:58,632
the Parkes valve can.

453
00:17:58,667 --> 00:17:59,965
That's it.
Good work, Glenn.

454
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,067
But how do you know
where 'Apollo 11 ' is?

455
00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:03,398
Computer.
Wow.

456
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:06,367
20 seconds it does
what took me five hours with a slide rule.

457
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:07,565
And a basketball.

458
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,267
Does the computer move the dish?

459
00:18:09,302 --> 00:18:10,465
Mitch does that...

460
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,167
Janine, we'll have to
return to work.

461
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:13,833
Thank you for the refreshments.

462
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:15,500
Oh, it was my pleasure.

463
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,867
Thanks very much, Janine.
See you, love.

464
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,798
She's a lovely girl.

465
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,467
Yeah. Not much of a driver but.

466
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:30,100
You should ask her out
when all this is over.

467
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:32,217
Oh, boy. Ask Janine out -
I don't know, Cliff.

468
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:34,300
You should see her
come to the cricket club

469
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:35,932
and everyone wants to talk to her.

470
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:38,667
And Garry Kenny - wouldn't be
surprised if they're going out.

471
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,333
Do you reckon?

prime receiving station

It was designed as a UPS,
but, um,

808
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,667

didn't kick back in.

Sector G, come in.

just try something.

Not now, Rudi.

954
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,816
You've got a visitor.

955
00:38:50,851 --> 00:38:52,033
It's the ambassador.

956
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,767
Of the United States of America.

957
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:56,965

Just a minute, Rudi.

959
00:38:59,435 --> 00:39:01,800
Roger that, Sector G.
Confirm Sector A, hold on.

960
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,300
He asked to visit.
I didn't think he'd come so soon.

961

He's here.

962
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:10,200
Space nut. Knows everything
about 'Apollo 11 '.

963
00:39:10,235 --> 00:39:11,717
Does he know where it is?

964
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:13,200
OK, let's make this brief.

965
00:39:13,235 --> 00:39:14,433
Send him up, Rudi.

966
00:39:14,468 --> 00:39:15,633
Roger that.

967
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:19,867
This is the main control panel.

968
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:21,967
That moves the dish up and down

969
00:39:22,002 --> 00:39:24,033
and that's
your sideways movement.

970
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:25,398
It's incredible.

971
00:39:25,433 --> 00:39:28,433
You can actually pinpoint
a tiny spaceship

972
00:39:28,468 --> 00:39:29,933
thousands of miles away

973

Pretty much.

975
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,367
The ambassador didn't sign in,
but I've let it go.

976
00:39:38,402 --> 00:39:40,333
Didn't want to pull rank
or anything.

977
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,933
Now, correct me,
but the other facilities down this way -

978
00:39:43,968 --> 00:39:45,934
North West Cape
and Honeysuckle Creek -

979
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:47,900
they also have voice
and telemetry, yes?

980

That's right, sir.

981
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:52,067
But when it comes to TV,
yours is the only dish large enough?

we're entering overlap now.

Yeah.

talking to Houston?

00:45:52,135 --> 00:45:53,298
52 years,

1110
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,633
and half of them in radio telescopes,
mapping the stars.

1111
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,800
And then this came along.

1112
00:45:59,267 --> 00:46:00,465
Your pipe.

1113
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,698
No, the moon mission.

1114
00:46:01,733 --> 00:46:04,367
Do you know what I thought
when it first came up?

1115
00:46:04,402 --> 00:46:05,565
You beauty.

1116
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,133
I thought,
"Imagine stuffing that up. "

1117
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,267
Isn't that odd?

1118
00:46:10,302 --> 00:46:11,465
What?

1119
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,165
Well, that I was more scared
than excited.

1120
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,067
I don't think that's odd.
I feel like that all the time.

1121
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,400
How come you changed?

1122
00:46:22,033 --> 00:46:23,232
My wife said something.

1123
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:26,833
She said, "Failure is never
quite so frightening as regret. "

1124
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,567
Oh, that's good advice.

1125
00:46:28,602 --> 00:46:29,998
Yeah, pretty good.

1126
00:46:30,033 --> 00:46:32,067
I wish someone
would tell me that.

1127
00:46:32,933 --> 00:46:34,133
God bless you, Glenn.

1128

( 'LET'S GET TOGETHER'
BY THE YOUNGBLOODS PLAYS )

1129
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:52,650
# Love is but a song to sing

1130
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,767
# And fear's the way we die

1131
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,100
# You can make
the mountains ring

1132
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:05,633
# Or make the angels cry

1133
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,333
# Though the bird is on the wing

1134

# And you may not know why

# Come on, people, now

1138
00:47:25,733 --> 00:47:26,966
Al.

1139
00:47:27,001 --> 00:47:28,165
Yeah.

1140
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,998
When I said
I was sorry about...

1141
00:47:30,033 --> 00:47:31,767
.. l meant I was sorry
for everything.

1142
00:47:31,802 --> 00:47:33,532
Mitch, that's not necessary.
No.

1143
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:35,733
When you first arrived,
I felt a little...

1144
00:47:35,768 --> 00:47:37,100
.. you're this hot shot from NASA

1145
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,300
and I'm some country kid
with the arse falling out of me daks.

1146
00:47:40,335 --> 00:47:41,732
Your...?
Pants.

1147
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:43,050
The point is I was wrong.

1148
00:47:43,085 --> 00:47:44,298
I never thought of you

1149
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:46,567
as a guy with
the ass falling out of his...

1150
00:47:46,602 --> 00:47:47,765
Daks.
.. daks.

1151
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,632
Everyone at NASA
is a college genius.

1152
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:52,500
The guy I most admire is from
a one-horse town in Ohio.

1153
00:47:52,535 --> 00:47:53,698
And what's he do?

1154
00:47:53,733 --> 00:47:55,533
Tomorrow he's going to
walk on the moon.

1155
00:47:55,568 --> 00:47:56,984
Who's the guy?

1156
00:47:57,019 --> 00:47:58,365
AL: Armstrong.

1157
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,967
You know, it would've been OK
to tell Houston.

1158
00:48:01,002 --> 00:48:02,800
Things go wrong there
all the time.

1159
00:48:02,835 --> 00:48:03,832
Oh, yeah.

1160
00:48:03,867 --> 00:48:05,417
Mission Control turns blue
every launch

1161
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:06,932
from 50 people
holding their breath.

1162
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,600
Guess how many rockets blew up
before we put men inside them.

1163
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:11,201
That's a while ago.
Six weeks ago.

1164
00:48:11,236 --> 00:48:12,768
Testing the lunar landing module.

1165
00:48:12,803 --> 00:48:14,265
10 simulations without a hitch.

1166
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,567
On the 11th, the controls jammed.
It crashed and burned.

1167
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,165
Strewth. Any idea why?

1168
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,832
No, they still have no idea why.

1169
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:21,833
Let's hope 11
isn't an unlucky number.

1170
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,916
We pray also for those three
brave souls who, as we speak,

1171
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:30,433
are taking the first steps
and exploring God's great universe.

1172
00:48:30,468 --> 00:48:33,465
And for the many technicians
and scientists

1173
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,332
whose efforts contribute to
this brave endeavour.

1174
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:39,067
BOB: lf you think
this 'Apollo 11 ' thing's big here,

1175
00:48:39,102 --> 00:48:41,333
you should hear what's going on
in the States.

1176
00:48:41,368 --> 00:48:42,365
Really?

1177
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,266
What were you saying
last night, Howard?

1178
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:46,133
You shouldn't drink so much.
(All laugh)

1179
00:48:46,168 --> 00:48:47,332
If you'll excuse me.

1180
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:49,200
He was round for dinner
last night.

1181
00:48:49,235 --> 00:48:50,398
Imagine two basketballs.

1182
00:48:50,433 --> 00:48:52,933
One's there and one's there
and there's a valve on top.

1183
00:48:52,968 --> 00:48:54,600
They won't be televising
the whole time?

1184
00:48:54,635 --> 00:48:55,884
Wouldn't have thought so, no.

1185
00:48:55,919 --> 00:48:57,098
Bounces off the basketball,

1186
00:48:57,133 --> 00:48:59,898
and then it bounces off
the Goldstone one...

1187
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:02,267
They could sneak around the back
and have a... (Whistles).

1188
00:49:02,302 --> 00:49:03,865
Reckon it depends.

1189
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,833
On whether they're doing
a number... (Whistles)

1190
00:49:05,868 --> 00:49:07,500
.. or a number...
(Whistles twice)

1191
00:49:07,535 --> 00:49:08,698
What was that, Ray?

1192
00:49:08,733 --> 00:49:10,833
We're just having a chat
about the television coverage.

1193
00:49:10,868 --> 00:49:12,032
Oh, yes.

1194
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:14,100
Listen, whereabouts around here
can I take a... (Whistles)

1195
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:16,165
Ah, thanks.

1196
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,550
# Smile on your brother

1197
00:49:17,585 --> 00:49:18,865

# Try to love one another
right now... #

1199
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,266
Thanks for bringing
the sandwiches.

1200
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:28,933
Thanks for fixing my bumper bar.

1201
00:49:28,968 --> 00:49:30,132
Oh, that's OK.

1202
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,833
Have you...
Janine, I was wonder...

1203
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:33,465
(Both giggle)
You go first.

1204
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,400
No, you.
What were you going to say?

1205
00:49:35,435 --> 00:49:36,651
N- nothing.

1206
00:49:36,686 --> 00:49:37,867
What about you?

1207
00:49:37,902 --> 00:49:39,067
Nothing.

1208
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,967
CLIFF: Has he asked her out yet?

1209
00:49:42,002 --> 00:49:43,167
(Sighs) No.

1210
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,400
Oh, this is painful.

1211
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,367
JANINE: No,
I really like weekends too.

1212
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,565
Yeah, I like Fridays

1213
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,533
'cause you're always
looking forward to the weekend.

1214
00:49:51,568 --> 00:49:52,733
BOTH: Yeah.

1215
00:49:53,733 --> 00:49:55,400
What were you gonna say before?

1216
00:49:55,435 --> 00:49:56,833
Nothing.

1217
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,367
What were you going to say?

1218
00:49:59,402 --> 00:50:00,884
Nothing.

1219
00:50:00,919 --> 00:50:02,367
Alright.

1220
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,398
See you.
See you.

1221
00:50:05,433 --> 00:50:07,300
Do you want to go out
Friday night?

1222
00:50:07,335 --> 00:50:08,932
What did you say?
Um, nothing.

1223
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:11,467
Did you just say, "Do you want
to go out Friday night?"

1224
00:50:11,502 --> 00:50:12,665
Um, maybe.

1225
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,367
I'd love to go out Friday night.

1226
00:50:14,402 --> 00:50:16,167
Oh... with me?

1227
00:50:16,202 --> 00:50:17,933
(Giggles) Yes.

1228
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,400
Righto, then.

1229
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:25,600
(Starts engine)

1230
00:50:47,367 --> 00:50:48,783
He ask her out?

1231
00:50:48,818 --> 00:50:50,165
Um, I'm not sure.

1232
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,900
Cliff, I had a chat to Al
this morning.

1233
00:50:54,067 --> 00:50:55,265
Really?
Yeah.

1234
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,950
He's not such a bad bloke.

1235
00:50:56,985 --> 00:50:58,600
You should give him a chance.

1236
00:50:59,467 --> 00:51:01,400
You'll be right
for a couple of hours?

1237
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:02,598
Yeah, we'll be right.

1238
00:51:02,633 --> 00:51:04,450
If you've got problems...
I'll call Rudi.

1239
00:51:04,485 --> 00:51:06,309
BOB: Have more.
That's prime Parkes lamb.

1240
00:51:06,344 --> 00:51:08,105
I've got enough.
More where that came from.

1241
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,867
I'll just have the vegetables.
Yes, dear.

1242
00:51:09,902 --> 00:51:11,698
Cliff?
This is wonderful, May.

1243
00:51:11,733 --> 00:51:14,900
Glad you could get away.
The boys have it under control.

1244
00:51:14,935 --> 00:51:16,798
When are you up?
Not till four.

1245
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:18,933
Tomorrow's the big day.
All being well.

1246
00:51:18,968 --> 00:51:20,600
Man on the bloody moon, eh?

1247
00:51:20,635 --> 00:51:21,798
Gravy?

1248
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:24,167
It's extraordinary, sending men
off into the galaxies

1249
00:51:24,202 --> 00:51:25,565
as the whole world watches.

1250
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,700
Certainly takes your mind off
our trivial concerns.

1251
00:51:27,735 --> 00:51:28,898
Elbows.

1252
00:51:28,933 --> 00:51:30,132
Our school's watching it.

1253
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:31,798
I think every school
will watch it.

1254
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:34,333
What are they estimating?
I believe it's 600 million.

1255
00:51:34,368 --> 00:51:35,584
600 million?

1256
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:36,800
600 million.

1257
00:51:36,835 --> 00:51:37,998
Peas?

1258
00:51:38,033 --> 00:51:40,283
Do the people in lndia
get to watch it?

1259
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:42,533
Yeah, but all on the one telly.
(All laugh)

1260
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:45,032
I'm serious.

1261
00:51:45,067 --> 00:51:46,550
Far too serious, darling.

1262
00:51:46,585 --> 00:51:47,926
How are they filming it?

1263
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:49,232
Cliff.
No, go ahead.

1264
00:51:49,267 --> 00:51:50,898
There's a boom outside
with a camera.

1265
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:53,600
Once Armstrong's outside,
he'll pull a ring and it'll swing out.

1266
00:51:53,635 --> 00:51:55,917

that hydrogen?

15 knots.

And we're rated to...
30.

For now.

1502

Come on, Glenn.
And if it goes above 30?

1503
01:00:36,035 --> 01:00:38,298
If it goes above 10
we stow the dish.

That's pointing up.
We've got to be pointing east.

it doesn't make sense.

1507
01:00:45,035 --> 01:00:46,665
Great.
Did he say anything else?

1508
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,267
Just "hello" and "goodbye".
He was very polite.

1509
01:00:52,867 --> 01:00:55,632
30 knots can't be
the absolute maximum.

1510
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:58,167
It's the theoretical maximum.
So it's never been tested?

1511
01:00:58,202 --> 01:00:59,365
No.
So...

1512

Al, we don't know.

1513

I don't want to know.

We've got nine hours
until they walk.

1518

Could this thing
blow itself out by then?

1519

too far,
