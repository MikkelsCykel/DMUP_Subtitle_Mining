- East.

Not bad for home-grown.

98
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:26,195
It's a little bit more than that, sonny.

<i>Oh, she's a real road king, all right.</i>

153
00:24:44,527 --> 00:24:46,927
How come you ain't
still in Bakersfield?

154
00:24:50,033 --> 00:24:52,297
Because I'm in the Southwest.

155
00:24:52,402 --> 00:24:54,302
What kind of sounds you like?

156
00:24:54,404 --> 00:24:57,896
- Beg pardon?
- Rock? Soul? Hillbilly?

157
00:24:58,008 --> 00:24:59,976
Western.

158
00:25:01,344 --> 00:25:04,336
- What's your taste?
- It don't hardly matter to me.

159
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:16,692
Might be a fouled plug.

160
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,934
Wish we were back in Santa Fe.

161
00:25:38,982 --> 00:25:42,213
So, after I got shot down twice
over Korea...

162
00:25:42,318 --> 00:25:45,219
I decided it was time
for some fun and games.

163
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:48,222
Take a couple years off.
You know what I mean?

164
00:25:48,324 --> 00:25:51,725
Then I ran out of cash
and had to take a job testing jets.

165
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:58,961
After a while it got so that I needed
a little more action on the ground.

166
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:03,869
I mean, you can't stay
with the same high forever. Right?

167
00:26:05,842 --> 00:26:11,303
Well, about that time the 455
came out with a Mark IV ram air...

168
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:13,382
and a beefed blower -

169
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:16,243
<i>Those son of a bitches.</i>

170
00:26:18,288 --> 00:26:21,257
They've been following me
clear across two states.

171
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,593
Three states.

172
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:29,263
They keep wanting to challenge me.

173
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:31,663
They come up behind me
and they honk.

174
00:26:31,768 --> 00:26:36,296
But I keep my cool.
I don't get into it with 'em. They get hysterical.

175
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:41,377
They're just a bunch of small-town car freaks.
That's all they are.

176
00:26:44,514 --> 00:26:46,914
But I tell you one thing, mister.

177
00:26:47,016 --> 00:26:50,611
They'll run right over you
if they get the chance.

178
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,282
That's homemade stuff.
They can't stand up to a 455. No way.

179
00:26:55,391 --> 00:26:58,588
Shit. I'd run off and leave them
in 20 minutes.

180
00:26:58,695 --> 00:27:00,959
J ust color me gone, baby!

181
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:13,965
Why can't I ever sit up front?

182
00:27:14,077 --> 00:27:16,671
What is this, anyway,
some kind of masculine power trip?

183
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:20,408
<i>I'm shoved back here
with these goddamn tools.</i>

184
00:27:20,517 --> 00:27:23,418
<i>Screwdrivers and wrenches
don't make it for me, you know.</i>

185
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,420
We oughta get some action soon.

186
00:27:25,522 --> 00:27:28,650
We'll need bread to do a little work
on the carburetors and check out the rear end.

187
00:27:28,758 --> 00:27:33,127
<i>I don't see anybody
paying attention to my rear end.</i>

188
00:27:33,229 --> 00:27:35,629
Listen. I've gotta take a leak.

189
00:27:35,732 --> 00:27:37,632
<i>Honest.
You gotta stop this car.</i>

190
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:39,668
Put her flat out for a while.

191
00:28:31,554 --> 00:28:33,954
- Good morning.
- Fill it up.

192
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:46,735
<i>- May I check the oil, sir?
- Yes, you may.</i>

193

194
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,938
<i>It's not in there.</i>

195
00:30:01,044 --> 00:30:02,944
Can I check the oil, sir?

196
00:30:03,046 --> 00:30:05,014
No, he'll get that.

197
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:39,473
I don't like being crowded by a couple
of punk road hogs clear across two states.

198
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:41,880
I don't.

199
00:30:43,386 --> 00:30:46,287
I don't believe I've ever seen you.

200
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:49,358
Course, there's lots of cars
on the road like yours.

201
00:30:50,393 --> 00:30:52,554
They all get to look the same.

202
00:30:52,662 --> 00:30:54,789
They perform about the same.

203
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:04,072
If I wanted to bother,
I could suck you right up my tailpipe.

204
00:31:07,043 --> 00:31:09,011
Sure you could.

00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:38,534
Yeah.

211
00:32:40,336 --> 00:32:43,430
You talk about survival.
Man, those are some freaky bugs.

212
00:32:45,107 --> 00:32:49,009
They spend, uh - They come out
of the ground every seven years.

213
00:32:49,111 --> 00:32:51,238
They live underground
the rest of the time...

214
00:32:51,347 --> 00:32:55,613
and the only time they come out of the ground
is to crawl out of their skins and grow some ring -

215
00:32:55,718 --> 00:32:58,380
grow some wings so they can fuck.

216
00:32:58,488 --> 00:33:00,649
And then they die.

217
00:33:00,756 --> 00:33:03,748
But before they die, they manage
to lay some more eggs so that these bugs -

218
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,158
We've got a better life,
haven't we?

219
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:13,433
- We make them look sick.
- Oh, boy, I'll say.

such a far-out car?

226

I won it shootin' craps.

227
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:35,006
Thought I'd drive to New York
and spend some money.

228
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:37,915

If I win, it could mean millions
for the organization.

303
00:41:09,278 --> 00:41:12,247
- How far you goin'?
- Oklahoma City.

304
00:41:14,984 --> 00:41:17,953
- You ever been there?
- No, I never been there.

305
00:41:20,255 --> 00:41:23,554
Do you mind if I stretch out,
make myself comfortable?

306
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:25,559
No. Go right ahead.

307
00:41:29,665 --> 00:41:32,065
# Well, the motor cooled down
the heat went down #

308
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:33,964
# That's when I heard
that highway sound #

309
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:35,434
# Cadillac looked like
it was standin' still #

310
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:37,402
# Well, I caught Maybelline
at the top of the hill #

311
00:41:37,506 --> 00:41:38,905
# Cadillac looked like a hunk of lead #

312
00:41:39,008 --> 00:41:40,373
# Well, 110, half a mile ahead #

313
00:41:40,476 --> 00:41:43,377
# Maybelline
Why can't you be true #

314
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:47,040
# Maybelline, why can't you be true #

315
00:41:47,149 --> 00:41:48,047
# You done started back #

316
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,777
# Doin' the things you used to do #

317
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:52,115
I'm not into that!

318
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:56,658
I just thought it might
relax you while you drive.

319
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:58,659
This is competition, man.

320
00:41:58,761 --> 00:42:00,729
I got no time.

321
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:31,153
Hey! Hey, sweetheart!

322
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:34,496
Come on!

323
00:42:40,102 --> 00:42:42,400
Yeah, well, we gotta get on it.

324
00:42:49,211 --> 00:42:51,179
Don't go!

325
00:42:57,653 --> 00:43:00,213
You son of a bitch.
You would've left me, wouldn't you?

326
00:43:13,368 --> 00:43:17,031
- Okay, get your ass outta here.
- It's raining. You can't let me out here.

327
00:43:18,574 --> 00:43:21,805
Out. I told you
to keep your claws off of me.

328
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:25,073
Oh, come on.
How was I supposed to know?

329
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:29,082
We can still be friends, can't we?

330
00:43:29,184 --> 00:43:31,084
Out.

331
00:43:31,186 --> 00:43:33,154
I ain't movin'!

332
00:43:39,394 --> 00:43:44,195
- First town we come to, you're out.

333
00:43:44,299 --> 00:43:46,597
I got no time for sidetracks.

334
00:44:34,216 --> 00:44:37,117
I'm gonna change the jets
on the carburetor.

335
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:40,484
Get me a cheeseburger
with everything on it and a Coke.

336
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,928
Step back over here for me.

337
00:45:47,055 --> 00:45:48,955
<i>Howdy. Can I help you?</i>

338
00:45:49,057 --> 00:45:50,957
Yeah.
This man's dangerous, Officer.

339
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:53,960
He passed us on the right
a couple of miles back.

340
00:45:54,062 --> 00:45:57,520
- I swear he was going about 90.
- Step back over here for a minute.

341
00:45:58,867 --> 00:46:00,926
Howdy.
Did he pass you in the ditch?

342
00:46:01,036 --> 00:46:06,440
That's right. He was weaving all over the road.
Scared my wife about half to death.

343
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:10,477
<i>He must be on something. Say, do you
need me as a witness or anything like that?</i>

344
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:12,444
No, sir.
I believe we can handle it.

345
00:46:20,055 --> 00:46:22,546
<i>- I did pass him, but my wife -</i>

346
00:47:27,889 --> 00:47:29,447
Hi, man!

347
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:31,788
Listen, you creep, I don't need
any help from you. Understand?

348
00:47:31,893 --> 00:47:34,919
I'm in this race all the way,
and I don't need to be patronized.

349
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:39,126
Don't put me on. I been around the track
too many times for that. You understand?

350
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:42,465
We just wanted to let you know
that we're right along with you on the road.

351
00:47:42,571 --> 00:47:44,198
We're all in this together, right?

352
00:47:44,306 --> 00:47:49,005
Look, shit-for-brains, I had those cops
eatin' right out of my exhaust pipe.

353
00:47:49,111 --> 00:47:50,703
You blew the whole thing.

354
00:47:50,812 --> 00:47:53,246
I had a police escort
across the state line...

355
00:47:53,348 --> 00:47:55,976
because my wife happens to be
having a set of twins.

356
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:58,314
That's beautiful!

357
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,012
Just don't fuck around with me.

358
00:48:00,122 --> 00:48:02,682
Okay, why don't we
take a truce for a few minutes?

359
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:04,918
<i>Would you like a, uh,
hard-boiled egg or something?</i>

360
00:48:07,696 --> 00:48:09,823
Here.

361
00:48:34,856 --> 00:48:38,587
I've got other items,
depending on which way you wanna go -

362
00:48:38,693 --> 00:48:41,161
up, down or sideways.

363
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:47,157
- Here's to your destruction.
- Same to you.

364
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:59,280
You want another egg?

365
00:49:00,682 --> 00:49:02,650
No.

366
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:22,696
Well, here we are on the road.

367
00:49:24,005 --> 00:49:26,166
Yeah, that's where we are, all right.

368
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:33,503
I'm not worried about shutting you down.
I hope you know that.

369
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:36,950
Yeah, I figured as much.

370
00:49:37,052 --> 00:49:40,453
However, I have been around.

371
00:49:40,555 --> 00:49:43,820
I get to one end of this country,
and I bounce off like a rubber ball...

372
00:49:43,925 --> 00:49:46,894
and head right back to the other side.

373
00:49:51,233 --> 00:49:55,761
I've been scouting locations
for a down-home movie on fast cars.

374
00:49:59,174 --> 00:50:03,133
But the real race,
it's more interesting.

375
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,843
I could choose locations
as I go along.

376
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:12,953
You been doing this much?

377
00:50:13,054 --> 00:50:15,022
A little, yeah.

378
00:50:16,324 --> 00:50:18,724
I knew you were a car nut.

379
00:50:18,827 --> 00:50:20,795
I can spot the type.

380
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:25,556
But all that speed, it's gonna
run over you one of these days.

381
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:28,192
You can't be a nomad forever...

382
00:50:28,303 --> 00:50:30,931
unless you flow with it like me.

383
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:35,267
Now, you take the trips that I've -

384
00:50:44,185 --> 00:50:47,154
Listen, why don't you ride with me?

385
00:50:49,324 --> 00:50:51,315
They're not for you.

386
00:50:52,894 --> 00:50:55,795
<i>All they think about is cars.</i>

387
00:50:55,897 --> 00:50:58,764
<i>They can't show you
the kind of time I can.</i>

388
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:03,737
<i>- Where would we go?</i>

389
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:05,806
Miami.

390
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:09,309
Maybe Montreal.

391
00:51:10,412 --> 00:51:13,108
Mexico. Mexico is out of sight.

392
00:51:15,717 --> 00:51:18,481
The thing is, you got to keep movin'.

393
00:51:18,587 --> 00:51:21,385
A few dashes out of the country
every now and then.

394
00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:23,957
You got to have a foreign taste
just to keep balance.

395
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:26,584
<i>Otherwise, you'll fall apart.</i>

396
00:51:27,696 --> 00:51:29,664
I don't know.

397
00:51:33,168 --> 00:51:35,136
Not right now.

398
00:51:36,905 --> 00:51:39,373
Anyway, you'll probably lose the race.

399
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:46,447
I'm serious, you know.

400
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:49,982
I'm not just kiddin' around.

401
00:51:53,421 --> 00:51:55,048
<i>#I'm stealin'back #</i>

402
00:51:55,156 --> 00:51:57,624
<i># To my same old used-to #</i>

403
00:51:57,726 --> 00:52:02,060
<i>#Stealin'back to my
same old used-to ##</i>

404
00:52:09,537 --> 00:52:13,166
<i>You'd have yourself a real street
sweeper here if you put a little work into it.</i>

405
00:52:13,274 --> 00:52:17,074
- I go fast enough.
- You can never go fast enough.

406
00:52:17,178 --> 00:52:20,113
I'll tell you another thing.
You're not gonna make it another 50 miles...

407
00:52:20,215 --> 00:52:22,149
the way the carburetor is.

408
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,377
You're leaking gas
all over the engine.

409
00:52:26,454 --> 00:52:28,354
Well, what I gotta do?

410
00:52:28,456 --> 00:52:30,356
Get it fixed in the next town.

411
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:33,655
If they have the parts,
it should only cost you an hour.

412
00:52:35,196 --> 00:52:37,926
That's all I need.

413
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:40,661
I can't survive a breakdown.

414
00:52:40,769 --> 00:52:43,897
It's all right for you guys.
You got a relief driver. You can change over.

415
00:52:44,005 --> 00:52:47,133
But you oughta see what I'm pickin' up
on the road - one fantasy after another.

416
00:52:47,242 --> 00:52:50,302
Look, we'll wait for you.
It doesn't interest me to be 500 miles ahead.

417
00:52:50,412 --> 00:52:52,539
How in the hell I know you'll wait?

418
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:58,983
I'll go with you, man.
It's only 10 miles from here, the next town.

419
00:52:59,087 --> 00:53:02,318
<i>- I'll go with him.
- I can go. I like the tape recorder.</i>

420
00:53:02,424 --> 00:53:06,520
No. I'll ride in the Chevy.
I never rode in one of those things.

421
00:53:13,268 --> 00:53:16,260
It's not too comfortable in here.

422
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:18,464
Yeah, it doesn't even have a heater.

423
00:53:18,573 --> 00:53:20,541
It slows it down.

424
00:53:35,156 --> 00:53:37,317
Holy shit!

425
00:53:43,398 --> 00:53:45,628
Come on, man!
You can do it!

426
00:53:45,734 --> 00:53:48,464
Pull up! Come on!

427
00:53:58,646 --> 00:54:02,082
What are you tryin' to do,
blow my mind?

428
00:54:05,987 --> 00:54:08,956
<i>- #I want air conditionin'#
- # I want air conditioning, oh #</i>

429
00:54:09,057 --> 00:54:11,491
<i>- #Automatic heat #
- # And an automatic heater #</i>

430
00:54:11,593 --> 00:54:13,993
<i>- #And a rollaway bed #

436
00:54:31,346 --> 00:54:33,974
Everything fell apart on me -

437
00:54:34,082 --> 00:54:36,778
my job, my family, everything.

438
00:54:40,121 --> 00:54:42,919
I had this job as a television producer,
and I walked into the office -

439
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:44,924
I don't wanna hear about it.

440
00:54:47,395 --> 00:54:49,920
What do you mean
you don't wanna hear about it?

441
00:54:51,733 --> 00:54:53,928
It's not my problem.

442
00:55:51,459 --> 00:55:54,019
- Hey.
- The men's room is locked.

443
00:56:49,651 --> 00:56:52,051
What are you doin' that for?

444
00:56:52,153 --> 00:56:54,485
I get nervous around
this part of the country.

445
00:58:19,941 --> 00:58:22,000
- You seen her around?
- Who?

446
00:58:23,111 --> 00:58:26,706
The girl. You know, Higgins -
whatever her name is.

447
00:58:26,814 --> 00:58:30,750
No. Do you know where I can get a plate?
I don't wanna be left out in the cold.

448
00:58:30,852 --> 00:58:33,616
You know what I mean?
I don't wanna be from out of state.

449
00:59:52,033 --> 00:59:54,228
Hey!

450
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:11,940
All right, let's try it again.

451
01:01:13,247 --> 01:01:15,215
Put it in neutral.

452
01:01:23,491 --> 01:01:25,459
Okay, start it.

453
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,800
That's right.
Now push in the clutch.

454
01:01:47,748 --> 01:01:49,716
Okay, put it in first.

455
01:01:55,823 --> 01:01:59,315
- Oh, fuck it! I can't do it.

456
01:02:01,896 --> 01:02:03,796
Shut your eyes.

457
01:02:07,868 --> 01:02:09,768
Okay, this is first.

458
01:02:11,372 --> 01:02:13,272
This is second...

459
01:02:13,374 --> 01:02:17,708
third, fourth -
not that you'll ever use it -

460
01:02:17,812 --> 01:02:19,712
and reverse.

461
01:02:24,085 --> 01:02:25,985
And this is neutral.

462
01:02:36,731 --> 01:02:38,699
Is this a game?

463
01:02:39,767 --> 01:02:41,962
I don't know.

464
01:02:42,069 --> 01:02:43,969
Not yet.

465
01:02:44,071 --> 01:02:46,039
You try.

466
01:03:03,291 --> 01:03:05,623
- You're right. You can't do it.

467
01:03:28,649 --> 01:03:30,810
I can do this.

468
01:04:30,244 --> 01:04:32,144
It must be Saturday.

469
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:45,058
We better get G.T.O. Together.

470
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:47,047
- What's happening?
- The town woke up.

471
01:05:50,424 --> 01:05:53,154
I'll meet you
on the south of town on a dirt road.

472
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,228
Okay. Throw me my shirt.

473
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,780
Yes, sir. Can I help you?

474
01:06:14,882 --> 01:06:18,181
Yeah, I need a carburetor rebuild kit
for a 1970 GM Quadrajet.

475
01:06:18,285 --> 01:06:20,253
All right, sir.

476
01:06:25,292 --> 01:06:27,192
I believe I've got one, sir.

477
01:06:33,467 --> 01:06:35,992
6.95 plus tax.

478
01:08:07,828 --> 01:08:10,592
Hey, man, we don't need
to burn that kind of rubber.

479
01:08:10,698 --> 01:08:15,761
Don't have to worry about it. Do a -
Do a couple burnouts with liquid rosin -

480
01:08:15,869 --> 01:08:17,769
Did you fix my leak?

481
01:08:17,871 --> 01:08:20,271
Yeah, but that's artificial traction, man.
They can't let you do that.

482
01:08:20,374 --> 01:08:22,274
- You mean your car?
- My car.

483
01:08:22,376 --> 01:08:25,777
That's a thing you get into and go from one
place to another. It takes a shorter time.

484
01:08:25,879 --> 01:08:27,972
- 670s, 640s. No problem.
- They fixed it.

485
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:32,109
Yeah, we'd be "B" class.
If we could get our E.T.'s down to -

486
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:34,710
I'd just like to know one thing.
Are we still racin' or what?

487
01:08:34,822 --> 01:08:36,756
- I got speed to think about.
- What do you want?

488
01:08:38,926 --> 01:08:41,053
I'd like a hamburger and an Alka-Seltzer.

489
01:08:43,197 --> 01:08:46,360
- We're broke.
- Broke? What do you mean?

490
01:08:46,467 --> 01:08:50,062
No bread.
We gotta get some competition.

491
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:53,003
Oh, broke.
Yeah, well, that's a problem.

492
01:08:57,444 --> 01:09:02,939
# I can't get no satisfaction #

493
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:08,010
# I can't get no girl reaction #

494
01:09:08,122 --> 01:09:10,613
# 'Cause I try #

495
01:09:10,724 --> 01:09:12,658
# And I try #

496
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:16,321
# And I try and I try #

497
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:18,990
# I can't get no ##

498
01:09:20,668 --> 01:09:24,263
<i>- Howdy.
- Howdy.</i>

499
01:09:24,371 --> 01:09:28,205
Say, my buddies and I, we been
wonderin' where you all might be from.

500
01:09:29,243 --> 01:09:31,211
Well, we're passin' through.

501
01:09:32,746 --> 01:09:34,714
Passin' through.

502
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:39,278
Well, now,
what do you all mean by that?

503
01:09:39,386 --> 01:09:41,354
<i>Goin' to Tennessee.</i>

504
01:09:42,656 --> 01:09:44,624
Tennessee?

505
01:09:48,896 --> 01:09:52,127
That's a piss-poor state
if I ever seen one.

506
01:09:52,232 --> 01:09:56,532
Sir, I work for these boys.
I'm their manager.

507
01:09:56,637 --> 01:09:59,834
We race that '55 Chevy sittin' outside.

508
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,534
We heard there's a good racetrack
down around Memphis.

509
01:10:02,643 --> 01:10:06,306
They're racin' that Chevy out there.

510
01:10:07,848 --> 01:10:11,284
Well, now, we got one of the best tracks
in this part of the country...

511
01:10:11,385 --> 01:10:14,013
- right out here by the state line.
- I'll be darned.

512
01:10:14,121 --> 01:10:17,818
Yeah. We got some boys, uh,
that'd shut you all down, no problem.

513
01:10:17,925 --> 01:10:19,893
Ain't that right, boys?

514
01:10:19,993 --> 01:10:21,893
<i>- Right.
- You bet.</i>

515
01:10:21,995 --> 01:10:25,158
- We'll make it.
- Be sure that you do.

516
01:10:31,805 --> 01:10:36,139
Say, you all wouldn't be... hippies,
would ya?

517
01:10:39,213 --> 01:10:41,443
No, sir.

518
01:10:41,548 --> 01:10:43,812
I take care of these boys myself.

519
01:10:43,917 --> 01:10:45,817
They're hometown boys.

520
01:10:45,919 --> 01:10:49,446
John is married to Mary over there,
and Davis is his brother.

521
01:10:51,291 --> 01:10:54,055
We're a big family, but we know
how to keep it together.

522
01:10:54,161 --> 01:10:56,425
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

523
01:10:59,767 --> 01:11:02,600
Well, sure did talk to ya.

524
01:11:03,637 --> 01:11:06,504
- Sure did see ya.
- Yeah.

525
01:11:06,607 --> 01:11:09,007
You all make it down to Carlyle,
you hear?

526
01:11:09,109 --> 01:11:11,077
- Oh, we'll do 'er.
- All right.

527
01:11:44,678 --> 01:11:46,771
One of them Dodge Chargers.
Let him go by.

528
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,372
- Not today.

529
01:12:48,141 --> 01:12:50,109
Are you all right?

530
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,550
I'm okay. I'm scared.
I'm just scared.

531
01:13:29,716 --> 01:13:31,616
His neck is broke.

532
01:13:35,522 --> 01:13:38,116
He was tryin' to pass
this other car, you see.

533
01:13:38,225 --> 01:13:41,217
He come around that curve there
on the wrong side of the road.

534
01:13:41,328 --> 01:13:43,455
Nothin' I could do.

535
01:13:43,563 --> 01:13:46,225
He just kept comin' at me,
the damn fool.

536
01:13:47,935 --> 01:13:49,903
The goddamn fool!

537
01:13:51,738 --> 01:13:54,206
I couldn't -

538
01:13:54,308 --> 01:13:56,276
I -

539
01:14:02,683 --> 01:14:04,878
Whoa, big fella.

540
01:14:04,985 --> 01:14:07,920
Easy now.
Nothin' to be afraid of.

541
01:14:23,136 --> 01:14:25,104
Appreciate it.

542
01:14:26,406 --> 01:14:28,306
No trouble.

543
01:14:31,144 --> 01:14:34,511
- How far you goin'?
- East.

544
01:14:35,615 --> 01:14:37,583
Well, I can take you 200 miles.

545
01:14:37,684 --> 01:14:40,346
I'm goin' up to Memphis
to run a few of my cars.

546
01:14:40,454 --> 01:14:42,354
<i>Oh.</i>

547
01:14:42,456 --> 01:14:44,822
A couple of Cobras, a Camaro.

548
01:14:44,925 --> 01:14:46,825
Should do okay.

549
01:14:46,927 --> 01:14:50,260
- It doesn't matter.
- Beg your pardon?

550
01:14:50,364 --> 01:14:52,924
What do we have, 30, 40 years?

551
01:14:53,033 --> 01:14:56,434
You don't exactly read me right.

552
01:14:56,536 --> 01:14:58,470
It's not that I give a shit.

553
01:14:58,572 --> 01:15:00,472
I'm into a little caper of my own.

554
01:15:00,574 --> 01:15:02,838
I believe everything
that you're sayin', man.

555
01:15:04,344 --> 01:15:07,006
Listen, you don't have to put me on.

556
01:15:08,048 --> 01:15:12,007
I'm gettin' sick and tired of creeps
gettin' in off the road and puttin' me on.

557
01:15:13,053 --> 01:15:14,953
What'd you say?

558
01:15:15,055 --> 01:15:18,115
You said something. You might as well
go ahead and tell me what you said.

559
01:15:18,225 --> 01:15:20,386
I said, "Stop the car."

560
01:15:20,494 --> 01:15:22,462
What do you mean, "Stop the car"?

561
01:15:22,562 --> 01:15:25,156
<i>I mean take your foot off the gas
and pull over.</i>

562
01:15:25,265 --> 01:15:27,699
<i>I just want to get off this machine.</i>

563
01:15:28,802 --> 01:15:31,100
<i>I pulled something in my neck.</i>

564
01:15:31,204 --> 01:15:33,695
<i>But if that's all we got,
we're in good shape.</i>

565
01:15:34,808 --> 01:15:37,936
I gotta check the points and the valves
when we get there.

566
01:15:38,045 --> 01:15:40,013
Also the jets in the carbs.

567
01:16:05,205 --> 01:16:07,105
Going to Pine Grove.

568
01:16:09,009 --> 01:16:11,170
Ten mile on.

569
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:15,507
Goin' to the graveyard.

570
01:16:16,917 --> 01:16:18,908
Glad to help you out, ma'am.

571
01:16:19,953 --> 01:16:22,513
Goin' to the graveyard.

572
01:16:24,691 --> 01:16:27,285
Her folks, buried there.

573
01:16:27,394 --> 01:16:29,294
Both of'em.

574
01:16:30,363 --> 01:16:32,888
<i>Killed on Saturday night.</i>

575
01:16:35,635 --> 01:16:38,035
<i>Out of state.</i>

576
01:16:38,138 --> 01:16:40,766
Well, yes, ma'am.
I'm drivin' through to Florida.

577
01:16:40,874 --> 01:16:42,899
I bought my mother a house
down in St. Petersburg...

578
01:16:43,009 --> 01:16:45,807
and I wanna get down there
and fix it up before she gets there.

579
01:16:45,912 --> 01:16:48,278
City car.

580
01:16:48,381 --> 01:16:51,578
Well, it could be a city car
or a country car, ma'am.

581
01:16:51,685 --> 01:16:53,812
Folks all over have 'em, you know.

582
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,582
City car is what killed 'em.

583
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:58,658
Oh.

584
01:16:59,759 --> 01:17:01,659
I'm sorry, ma'am.

585
01:17:01,761 --> 01:17:04,730
City car is what killed 'em.

586
01:18:39,659 --> 01:18:42,753
Comin' out of the hole first
is a little G.T.S.

587
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:03,177
<i>They said they wanted
these things to be about that.</i>

588
01:19:03,283 --> 01:19:08,243
<i>Chevy guy's got more carburetor.
I think he thinks it's a hemi.</i>

589
01:19:09,456 --> 01:19:11,356
We tried polar plugs, everything.

590
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:14,621
Polar plugs are workin' a little better
when there's more pressure.

591
01:19:14,728 --> 01:19:17,856
<i>All right. Callin'cars to the line.</i>

592
01:19:17,964 --> 01:19:19,864
<i>Gonna be a fine run.</i>

593
01:19:19,966 --> 01:19:23,800
<i>396-cubic-inch Camaro
versus a 302-cubic-inch Camaro.</i>

594
01:19:31,478 --> 01:19:35,209
<i>Don't forget, this day is the record run.</i>

595
01:19:35,315 --> 01:19:39,547
<i>Out of Memphis, Tennessee, we have the
record run right here at Lakeland I nternational.</i>

596
01:19:46,359 --> 01:19:49,658
<i>Try it out. Go down and check the board.</i>

597
01:21:00,567 --> 01:21:02,467
<i>Please stay away from the walls.</i>

598
01:21:02,569 --> 01:21:04,469
<i>I would appreciate it.</i>

599
01:21:04,571 --> 01:21:07,301
<i>Little Fury
goin'all the way for the win.</i>

600
01:21:07,407 --> 01:21:11,002
<i>A 15-65 and 15-24.</i>

<i>Gimme "K"stop to Lane Number 3.</i>

604
01:21:25,558 --> 01:21:28,652
<i>That is K.S. For Lane Number 3.</i>

605
01:21:30,497 --> 01:21:32,897
<i>All right. Comin' to the line.</i>

606
01:21:35,001 --> 01:21:38,801
<i>Little '55 runnin'hot rod.

01:21:38,905 --> 01:21:41,840
<i>Little '55 really sounds strong.</i>

608
01:21:41,941 --> 01:21:43,932
<i>Tree come down.</i>

609
01:21:44,043 --> 01:21:47,240
<i>Little '55 comes out of the hole
real strong.</i>

610
01:21:47,347 --> 01:21:49,315
<i>Real lean-soundin little '55.</i>

611
01:21:50,683 --> 01:21:54,983
<i>Goin'down the big quarter mile.
He gonna run well into the 12s.</i>

612
01:22:32,325 --> 01:22:34,293
Where to?

613
01:22:35,328 --> 01:22:37,296
Around the block.

614
01:22:40,467 --> 01:22:43,732
I think there's someone following us.

615
01:22:43,837 --> 01:22:45,998
You'll get used to it.

616
01:22:46,105 --> 01:22:48,266
Where'd Harry run off to?

617
01:22:48,374 --> 01:22:50,934
Oh, I think he's settin' up a grudge race
over there somewhere.

618
01:22:51,044 --> 01:22:53,342
Oh, he's crazy, man.
He won't even qualify.

619
01:22:53,446 --> 01:22:55,471
Yeah, well,
he's been pretty weird lately, all right.

620
01:22:55,582 --> 01:22:58,278
I'll see you all up at Vic's
after I shut old Sam down.

621
01:22:58,384 --> 01:23:00,352
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

622
01:23:05,291 --> 01:23:08,419
Mr. Tommy Briggs stops the clock at 11:34.

623
01:24:14,761 --> 01:24:17,059
We'll be in D.C.
Tomorrow night for dinner.

624
01:24:28,474 --> 01:24:30,374
I set it up.

625
01:24:30,476 --> 01:24:32,444
We're goin' against a 'Vette.

626
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:36,239
I put up the tools against 300.

627
01:24:48,394 --> 01:24:50,294
I gotta check the valves.

628
01:25:02,609 --> 01:25:05,407
- She's runnin' fine.
- Beautiful.

629
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:14,115
After D.C. We'll go on down to Florida.

630
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:16,688
They've got some nice beaches
down there.

631
01:26:38,504 --> 01:26:41,701
<i>Comin' to the line, a little '55 Chevrolet...</i>

632
01:26:43,276 --> 01:26:48,737
<i>goin'down against
Mr. Barthall and CH-1.</i>

633
01:26:58,991 --> 01:27:02,188
<i>At H-5 it's the little '55I</i>

634
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,894
I got a good lead on 'em.

635
01:27:11,003 --> 01:27:13,972
They ain't gonna catch me now.

636
01:27:15,742 --> 01:27:19,576
We'll take their pinks
and we'll go to New York. Right?

637
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:21,647
Right.

638
01:27:23,716 --> 01:27:25,684
That's right.

639
01:27:33,459 --> 01:27:36,087
The tires didn't bite out of the hole.

640
01:27:36,195 --> 01:27:38,322
I just barely got him.

641
01:27:46,739 --> 01:27:48,900
Where is she?

642
01:27:49,008 --> 01:27:51,374
- They split.
- Let's go.

643
01:27:51,477 --> 01:27:53,843
Don't matter.
We don't want the Goat anyway.

644
01:27:53,946 --> 01:27:56,005
Come on.

645
01:27:56,115 --> 01:27:58,174
Okay. She's gonna burn you.

646
01:28:15,401 --> 01:28:19,963
By golly,
we got time for a quick bite.

647
01:28:20,072 --> 01:28:22,040
Then we'll go on.

648
01:28:23,109 --> 01:28:25,509
Doesn't matter where.

649
01:28:25,611 --> 01:28:29,342
As long as we got time to grab off
a quick piece every now and then.

650
01:28:30,383 --> 01:28:34,149
Oh, no. Forget I said that.
I'm crazy about you.

651
01:28:34,253 --> 01:28:36,153
Here's the way it's gonna be.

652
01:28:37,757 --> 01:28:40,248
When we get the Cobra,
we're gonna go to Florida.

653
01:28:40,359 --> 01:28:42,919
And we're gonna lie around the beach
and just gonna get healthy.

654
01:28:43,029 --> 01:28:44,997
Let all the scars heal.

655
01:28:46,999 --> 01:28:49,365
Maybe we'll run over to Arizona.

656
01:28:49,468 --> 01:28:51,561
The nights are warm and...

657
01:28:52,605 --> 01:28:54,573
the roads are straight.

658
01:28:58,177 --> 01:29:00,145
And we'll build a house.

659
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:03,080
Yeah, we'll build a house.

660
01:29:07,486 --> 01:29:10,944
Because if I'm not grounded pretty soon...

661
01:29:11,057 --> 01:29:13,992
I'm gonna go into orbit.

662
01:29:17,196 --> 01:29:19,096
Easy.

663
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:21,428
Take it easy, man.
You're gonna kill us.

664
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:52,958
Baby.

665
01:30:54,961 --> 01:30:57,395
I gotta get some food.
I'm fallin' asleep.

666
01:30:58,931 --> 01:31:00,831
Where are we?

667
01:31:00,933 --> 01:31:02,901
Food. Breakfast.

668
01:31:40,706 --> 01:31:46,008
Champagne, caviar,
chicken sandwiches under glass.

669
01:31:48,647 --> 01:31:50,547
No.

670
01:31:50,649 --> 01:31:53,379
Bacon and eggs, over light.
Coffee, toast, jelly.

671
01:31:56,889 --> 01:31:59,551
And tea.

672
01:31:59,658 --> 01:32:02,456
<i>Maybe we ought to go to Chicago.</i>

673
01:32:02,561 --> 01:32:06,224
I got some connections in Chicago
that are out of sight.

674
01:32:08,067 --> 01:32:09,967
I don't want to go to Chicago.

675
01:32:13,339 --> 01:32:15,239
That's cool then.

676
01:32:15,341 --> 01:32:17,536
We'll check out New York.

677
01:32:34,894 --> 01:32:37,192
We passed 'em five miles back.

678
01:32:53,379 --> 01:32:55,347
Where?

679
01:32:57,016 --> 01:32:58,984
I said, where?

680
01:33:00,453 --> 01:33:02,751
It's gonna take a long time.

681
01:33:02,855 --> 01:33:04,914
You'll have to pull over first.

682
01:33:15,234 --> 01:33:17,930
They're at a diner
on the right side of the road.

683
01:33:49,602 --> 01:33:51,763
- Shit.

684
01:34:17,897 --> 01:34:20,661
I figured we'd go on up
to Columbus, Ohio.

685
01:34:22,434 --> 01:34:25,767
There's a man there who's got some parts
he wants to sell real cheap.

686
01:34:40,486 --> 01:34:42,386
No good.

687
01:37:02,561 --> 01:37:04,461
<i>This is a bitch of a car.</i>

688
01:37:04,563 --> 01:37:06,463
Yeah, yours isn't bad either.

689
01:37:06,565 --> 01:37:10,228
- What do you got in it?
- What's it worth to you to find out?

690
01:37:10,336 --> 01:37:12,827
<i>- Fifty.
- See ya.</i>

691
01:37:12,938 --> 01:37:14,906
<i>Make it a hundred.</i>

692
01:37:17,776 --> 01:37:20,040
<i>Where do you guys race around here?</i>

693
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:23,048
<i>Down at the old airport.</i>

694
01:37:56,782 --> 01:37:59,307
Nice set of wheels you have here.

695
01:37:59,418 --> 01:38:03,149
- How far are you goin'?
- New York City. We're on a 10-day leave.

696
01:38:03,255 --> 01:38:05,223
Well, you're in luck.

697
01:38:06,258 --> 01:38:08,488
I can take you all the way.

698
01:38:08,594 --> 01:38:10,721
What's it got, 390 horse?

699
01:38:10,829 --> 01:38:12,797
Yeah, 390.

700
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:17,268
I won it flat out.

701
01:38:19,138 --> 01:38:23,598
I was drivin' a '55 stock Chevy across country
and I got in a race with this G.T. O...

702
01:38:23,709 --> 01:38:25,677
for pink slips.

703
01:38:28,347 --> 01:38:31,441
I beat the G.T.O. By three hours.

704
01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:34,986
Of course, the guys in the G.T.O.
Couldn't drive worth a damn.

705
01:38:37,723 --> 01:38:40,317
But I'll tell you one thing.

706
01:38:40,426 --> 01:38:43,327
There's nothin' like buildin' up
an old automobile from scratch...

707
01:38:43,429 --> 01:38:45,761
and wipin' out
one of these Detroit machines.

708
01:38:45,864 --> 01:38:48,355
That'll give you a set of emotions
that'll stay with you.

709
01:38:48,467 --> 01:38:50,367
Know what I mean?

710
01:38:51,804 --> 01:38:54,602
Those satisfactions are permanent.
