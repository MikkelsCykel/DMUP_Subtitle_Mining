00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,317
Honey, I'm home.

3
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,662
Family?

4
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,081
[Woman]
We're downstairs.

5
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,006
Can you move your right toe,
like, slightly towards me?

6
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,883
- Just a little bit more.
- [Girl] It hurts.

7
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,843
- [Woman] Perfect.
- Hi.

8
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,470
- Hey, sweetie.
- [Girl] Hey.

9
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:21,057
Look, my feet really, really hurt.
You know I'm not good on high heels.

10
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,976
[Woman] We'll be done
in one minute. Just one more roll.

11
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,479
How come you never use me
in any pictures?

12
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:30,233
- You're never here.
- Plus, my legs are longer and more supple.

13
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,735
Come say hi, sweetie.

14
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,363
- Come give me a kiss.
- [Shutter Clicks]

15
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,199
- Hi.
- We'll be done really soon.

16
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,619
How about if we order dinner,
and I let you choose what you want?

17
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,996
How long are you gonna be
staying in our house?

18
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,833
Last I checked, it's my house too.
I have a whole bedroom.

19
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,710
You used to have a whole bedroom.
It's my special space now.

20
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,922
Candice, can you...

21
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,551
come and move
the couch on the left...

22
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,930
like, oh, one inch
towards the window?

23
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,849
- Hey, Candice.
- Hey, Aura.

24
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,809
Some boxes came for you,
so I put them in your bedroom.

25
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,020
- [Stage Whisper] Not your bedroom.
- Thank you. I think you're being mean.

26
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,898
I think you're being oversensitive.

27
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,276
I just got off a plane from Ohio.
I'm in a postgraduate delirium.

28
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,194
I think you sound like you're
in the epilogue to Felicity.

29
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,488
The guy I thought I was gonna marry
just moved to Colorado.

30
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,324
- Cut me some slack.
- You were not gonna marry him.

31
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,744
He's like a little speck of granola
on a bowl of homemade yogurt.

32
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:28,291
You know, I always said
he was really a sweet guy...

33
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,293
and like, the perfect
first boyfriend, like...

34
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,628
the way a college boyfriend should be.

35
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,007
So basically you're saying I wasted
two years of my life on a speck of granola?

36
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,010
No. Regret is a complete
waste of time.

37
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,930
I never think about my 20s,
and I absolutely don't look back.

38
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,185
Could you turn on your lamp?
I don't like overhead light.

39
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,814
The bulb is blown.

40
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,816
Replace it.

41
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,611
I don't know where they are.

42
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,946
Lazy.

43
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,990
You're gonna call me lazy?

44
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,160
You're the one who does everything
with, like, Gumby arms.

45
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,245
What are you talking about?

46
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,582
Maybe the fact that every time
I ask you to help me with anything...

47
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,834
you do it with, like,
limp, rubbery arms...

48
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,253
that make me wish
I had just handled it myself.

49
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,590
Do you really want to start this right now?
Do you want to start this?

50
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,008
Start what?

51
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,177
I have, like, a million things
I could say right now.

52
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:25,640
- Like what?
- Like, "Get a fucking lightbulb. "

53
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,519
- [Mother] Oh, it's ridiculous. It's a museum.
- Mom?

54
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,065
It's all forms and registrars.
I need to figure out how to be a diva.

55
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,359
- Siri?
- Hold on a second.

56
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,028
- What? I'm on the phone.
- I need a lightbulb.

57
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,238
In the white cabinet.

58
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,492
All right. Sorry.

59
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,245
What's a harridan, anyway?

60
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,208
Yeah, exactly.

61
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,836
Yeah, that's what
I have to learn to be.

62
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,342
Yeah, he tries to take out
three-quarters of my work...

63
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,552
48 hours before the show opens.

64
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,933
Yeah. You're gonna help me
figure this out. Exactly.

[Whispering]
"June 28, 1974.

66
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,856
Enough bullshit about chronology.

67
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,776
It doesn't really matter lately
what I do and who calls me when.

68
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:22,238
It matters more what I'm thinking,
which is that I haven't been making art...

69
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,573
yet I have a fierce desire
to be an artist.

70

Having a body of my own work seems
more like security to me than anything.

71

Setting up a studio,
having shows, seems like...

72
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,001
one of the few worthwhile things
there is for me to do.

it would be good if you were
a little bit on our schedule.

you letting me keep Gilda down here.

very lusty towards her.

I'm doin'.
I'm in the library.

All the freshmen arrived today,
and I cruised them so hard.

00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,525
I watched them all
moving into their dorms...

all the minifridges
and collapsible hampers...

107

and posters
of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss.

- As done as I'm gonna be.

I don't know. I think this summer
was the dreamiest one of my life.

Are you kidding?

115
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,845
You were miserable. You spent
half your time with me in the library.

116
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,557
Oh, and stopped eating gluten
and kept threatening to decamp for India.

00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,101
That's totally right.
But oh, my God.

118

I found my mom's journals
from when she was our age.

They're unbelievable.
I'm reading them illegally.

He can be kind of grumpy sometimes,
but kind of in a cool way.

152
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,740
He has this show on YouTube
where he rides...

153
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,451
this rocking horse
and talks to fake enemies.

154
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,453
Oh, my God.
I think I know who that is.

155
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,664
- It's the Nietschian Cowboy, right?
- Yeah.

156
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,708
Yeah, yeah. He's the same guy who does
the Skeptical Gynecologist videos.

157
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,710
- Yeah, you've seen those?
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,129
- Yeah. You think they're funny?
- I do think they're funny.

159
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,590
- He's a little bit famous.
- Yeah, I guess so...

160
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,759
in, like, an Internet kind of way.

161
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,178
But we met at this comedy show.

162
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,306
It was really lame,
and he really liked my monologue.

163
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,308
- [Phone Beeps]
- Oh, my God.

164
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,769
Are you so sad
about your boyfriend?

165
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,939
I am really sad.
It's been a really hard few weeks.

166
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,941
I always knew he was
gonna have to take this journey...

167
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,902
but I just didn't expect
it was gonna be so soon.

168
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,196
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- And then, like -

169
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,117
Okay.

170
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,705
[Chattering]

171
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,086
Hi.

172
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,006
Jed, this is my so-special friend, Aura.

173
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,049
Hello, so-special friend Aura.

174
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,676
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

175
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,594
I'm actually a big fan
of your work on the YouTube.

176
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,014
Aw shucks.

177
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,016
I, um, actually thought
you lived in Chicago -

178
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,518
maybe because your MySpace profile
says you live in Chicago.

179
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,062
I do live in Chicago.
I'm here on business.

180
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,732
- Oh, cool. What kind of business?
- Top-secret business.

181
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,234
- Government stuff.
- Hmm.

182
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,738
- Aura does really cool videos too.
- Oh, cool.

183
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,198
I thought you told me there was
gonna be some grinding at this party -

184
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,076
like, straight-up,
eighth-grade-style grinding.

185
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,912
Oh, no.
I meant eighth-grade-style crying.

186
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,165
- Oh, "crying. "
- We're all gonna cry together.

187
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,834
- I see. My mistake.
- So how long are you in town for?

188
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,337
- Uh, I'm in town for roughly -
- [Woman] Oh, my God.

189
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,630
Oh, my fucking God.

190
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,632
Charlotte.
Oh, my God. Charlotte.

191
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,426
Oh, my God!

192
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,679
I'm so sorry I slapped you.
I'm just so overwhelmed.

193
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,681
Aura! Aura!

194
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,933
- Are you here? Are you here?
- I'm here.

195
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,102
I know Ashlynn, so, yeah, I'm here.

196
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,148
This girl has been
my best friend since I'm one.

197
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,651
- Since I'm... less. Zero.
- It's true.

198
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,446
Our moms used to rub their stomachs
together when they were pregnant with us.

199
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,698
They were the best friends ever...

200
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,410
until my mom
got into Landmark Forum...

201
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,373
and Tony Robbins and ran off to Wyoming
and opened a really dumb...

202
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,333
bed-and-breakfast.

203
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,669
And it's certainly sad.
Now they only speak once a year.

204
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,756
So, how's college in Ontario?

205
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,342
Ohio. I was in college in Ohio.

206
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,302
That's really great.

207
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,596
But, um, you have to come with me.

208
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,058
You have to come with me now.
And we have to talk.

209
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,310
## [Dance Rock]

210
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,316
I am so sorry.
I, like, hardly know her.

211
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,318
I met her at this weird
fashion party last week.

212
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,529
She's totally crazy,
but in a really fun way.

213
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,656
- Is her accent real?
- Yeah, I think so.

214
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,908
Her dad's British.
She went to fifth grade there.

215
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,494
Oh.
Well, you should totally stay.

216
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,538
Yeah, I don't know.
I feel like I should go with her.

217
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,540
I've been avoiding her
for, like, five years.

218
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,042
Yeah, I can see why. Yeah.

219
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,044
Anyway, thank you
so much for having me.

220
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,755
Oh, no problem.
You should say good-bye to Jed, though.

221
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,508
- Okay.
- Yeah. I think he really likes you.

222
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,510
Okay.

223
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,015
- Hey.
- Hey, how's it goin'?

224
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,309
It's okay. I'm takin' off.

225
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,186
- Takin' off already?
- Yeah, you saw my friend.

226
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,981
- She really wants me to leave with her.
- Okay.

227
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,899
How much longer are you in town?

228
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,944
I'm in New York
for another almost two weeks.

229
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,029
Well, I'm sure you're very busy...

230
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,700
but if you need a native to show
you around, I'd be glad to do it.

231
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,910
You should give me your number.

232
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,620
Okay.

233
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,042
Taxi!

234
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,468
I leave my lights on when I'm gone.

235
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,428
For fun.

236
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,389
- And you live here alone?
- I do.

237
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,559
And you live with Siri.
How is she?

238
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:34,188
She's good, I think. She's working a lot.
Big retrospective next year.

239
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,733
She's not really dating or anything,
but I think she's happy.

240
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,068
- And then there's Nadine.
- Oh, who I saw.

241
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:43,572
On the street.
And who is so tall.

242
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,532
You're lucky to have them -

243
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,869
Siri and Nadine.

244
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,996
I feel like a fucking orphan.

245
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,501
I'm gonna smoke.
I'm gonna smoke pot.

246
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,961
- Do you smoke?
- I could.

247
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,428
Okay, full disclosure:

248
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,723
I was in a rehab in 2007.

249
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,684
But it wasn't for this.
It was for, like...

250
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,104
a blow situation
that I since cleared up.

251
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,066
- Do you drink?
- Yeah. No.

252
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,817
No, I, um -

253
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:24,321
Only kombucha, you know?
And some red wine.

254
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,949
But that's good for you.

255
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,576
But I don't think we need to talk
about all our issues, you know?

256
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,955
Can't we just start again
as new friends, you know?

257
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,750
Who... Who were old friends,
you know?

258
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,087
- Yeah, like new friends who share a lot of old memories.
- Exactly.

259
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,302
Exactly.

260
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,930
It's kind of like that book
The Giver, you know...

261
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,932
where the, um...

262
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,685
that kid stores everyone's emotions,
that guy?

263
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,272
No, it's not like that at all.

264
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,149
Here.

265
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,151
Thank you.

266
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,737
Well, I want to know about you.
What do you do?

267
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,198
What do you love to do?

268
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,409
Uh... well, I studied film theory...

269
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,411
which I guess I liked.

270
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,372
And then this past summer
I was an assistant...

271
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,542
to a documentary film professor,
like, doing research and stuff.

272
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,169
Sounds like fun.

273
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,214
It wasn't really that fun.

274
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,345
Ooh!

275
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,988
- This is so funny.
- You think so?

276
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,033
I think it's so stupid.
It's just, like, me in a bikini...

277
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,493
in a campus fountain
while my ex-boyfriend watches.

278
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,080
I fucking love it.
Look how many views it's got.

279
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,082
It's got all these comments as well.

280
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,710
"Ahoy, mateys. Whales ahead. "

281
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,670
"What a blubber factory. "

282
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,715
"Put on some pants
or a burlap sack. "

283
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,258
Oh.

284
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,303
"No, her stomach isn't huge.
It's just that her boobs are really small.

285
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,930
- It's an optical illusion. "
- [Groans]

286
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,975
Oh, you can't possibly
take these seriously, Aura.

287
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,144
I do sometimes.

288
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,688
I kind of want to take this
off-line anyway.

289
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,316
I think you're a genius.

290
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,401
You should be on Saturday Night Live.

291
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,403
Or maybe something
more early Yoko Ono...

292
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,907
where you're just moving through a gallery
and everyone's watching you.

293
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,743
No way.
The art world's my mom's racket.

294
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,787
I don't know what I'll be.

295
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,039
Is Siri making you get a job?

296
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,833
She's not making me.
I mean, I probably should.

297
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,379
My psycho-pharm says
there's no such thing as "should. "

298
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:49,174
Plus, no one's even financially
independent until they're at least 25.

299
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,259
Or even 30.

300
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,345
What do you think you'll do?

301
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,389
I have no idea what I'm qualified for.

302
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,266
I worked at this place
around the corner called Clandestino.

303
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,103
It's, like, sort of

- No, I was a hostess.

It's the easiest job ever.

306
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,611
You just have to look nice and greet people,
and then old guys send you drinks.

You're so charming. You could do it.
And I know they're hiring.

Really good to see you, though.

You have to promise to call me.

- A practice test.

I never took one of those,
and I came out with a cool score of 1,000.

Listen, not to be rude,
but your bath products...

all over the bathroom...

so if you could maybe
keep them on one shelf?

325
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,257
And there's also some hair in the sink
that's definitely not mine.

326
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,843
So if you could do something with that,
and scoop the kitty litter...

327
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,887
that'd be really great.

The boys will be down in the kitchen.

Um, the wait staff gets in
at around 5:30...

335
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,424
so it's not the most social job.

Uh, tomorrow. Now.

Let me go downstairs and check.

I haven't done this before...

Well, no need to be that enthusiastic.

I mean, do you want to know
what it pays?

345
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:22,285
- I'm sorry. I forgot to ask.
- Yeah, it's $11 an hour to start...

346
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:27,290
and you can't expect tips because,
you know, you're a day hostess, so -

00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,043
- I was not expecting any tips.
- Okay, good.

Probably a great thing to do

so over-share-y like you.

454
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:57,453
Like, I'm not just gonna go down
into Mom's studio and be like...

455
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,416
"Mom, Candice, like,
my heart is so broken...

456
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,878
and my vagina hurts so much!"

457
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,092
Whatcha doin' in my closet, kiddo?

458
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,178
Uh...

459
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,388
I'm looking for new shoes.

460
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,807
I hate all my shoes.

461
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,351
And I think I'm going
on a date tomorrow.

462
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,103
With whom?

463
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,440
This guy Jed.
He makes comedy videos.

464
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,525
Is he nice?

465
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,944
I'm not sure yet.

466
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,364
But we are going
to a French movie.

467
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,200
Mm.

468
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:38,786
Can I show you a video of him
and see if you think it's funny?

469
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,290
Please give this to me.

470
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,542
Did you Google "cupcakes"?

471
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,219
[Jed's Voice]
I reject your Platonicism.

472
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:58,014
More than that, I reject
your whole way of life, partner.

473
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,644
This town ain't big enough
for Christianity and egalitarianism.

474
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,855
Insanity in individuals is quite rare...

475
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:11,110
but in groups, parties, nations,
and epochs, it is a rule.

476
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,405
I'm crazier than an epoch,
and I'm riding my horse right at ya.

477
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,991
[Gun Clicking]

478
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,536
See, it's highbrow,
but it's very witty, I think.

479
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:23,331
It's witty, but it's kinda goofy.

480
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:30,463
It's not very mature, but every time I come
into your room, I want to sleep in your bed.

481
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,884
Well, you can sleep here if I'm here.
You just can't sleep here if I'm not here.

482
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,805
So when you and Nadine are visiting colleges
next week, I can't sleep in here?

483
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,599
- That is correct.
- What's the difference?

484
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:45,270
You need to be invited.
I have to invite you to come in.

485
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:48,648
- Like a vampire?
- [Doorbell Rings]

486
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,833
[Rings]

487
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,043
Coming.

488
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,880
- Aura?
- Oh, hey, Noelle.

489
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,216
Oh, I had no idea
that you were home.

490
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,593
Are you on some kind of a break?
Fall break?

491
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,054
- I graduated.
- Oh, Jesus. Already?

492
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,516
And what about
your boyfriend, um, Noah?

493
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,185
Owen. We broke up.

494
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,271
Oh, no!

495
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,690
He was so sweet.
Do you remember, Jacob?

496
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,693
You liked him so much at that party,
at the New Year's party.

497
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,778
Yeah, he moved back to Colorado.

498
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,239
Uh, something
about having to build a shrine...

499
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,658
to his ancestors out of a dying tree.

500
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,411
- Are you looking for my mom?
- No. Actually, I'm looking for Nadine.

501
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,122
Sometimes she watches Jacob,
you know, in a pinch.

502
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,666
Sorry. We love Nadine, right?

503
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,753
Yes? Is Nadine around?

504
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,547
She's out somewhere.

505
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,300
But, um, I could watch Jacob
if you needed.

506
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,052
I'm sure you're busy.

507
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,554
- I have a little time.
- That would be great.

508
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:06,267
Just...
Maybe just put on some pants.

509
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,186
Okay.

510
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,819
Do you need my help?

511
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,905
Uh, nope.

512
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,077
Do you want to see my hamster?

513
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,663
Uh...

514
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,791
definitely N-O.

515
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,548
What do you think
I should wear on my date tonight?

516
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,884
A tube top.

517
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,057
- Oh, hey. What's up?
- How's it goin'?

518
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,934
- It's good. How are you?
- I'm doin' all right.

519
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,894
- Sorry I'm late.
- No, don't worry about it.

520
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,563
I'm staying on my friend's couch,
and right when I was getting ready to leave...

521
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,441
he and his girlfriend
got into this huge, fuckin'...

522
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,195
heroic, epic argument
right at the front door.

523
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,824
- Oh, no.
- I was locked in by a wall of aggression.

524
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,326
- That sounds really stressful.
- Yeah, it was really stressful.

525
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,830
It was. I went to an ATM
around the corner just now...

526
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,915
- and the machine told me to go fuck myself.
- Oh.

527
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,917
- Yeah.
- In those words?

528
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,086
In those exact words, saying,
"I have not a penny for you. "

529
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,755
I'm in deep financial constraints.

530
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,299
[Chuckles] So, what do you -
you want to go -

531
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,928
I was thinking, you know,
I'm already late, I'm already broke -

532
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,013
So maybe we should just
skip the movie?

533
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,725
Which is actually fine, because
my horrible secret is that I hate foreign films.

534
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:33,646
Interesting. I think a lot of people
nurture that horrible secret.

535
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,149
Well, let's see.
Are you hungry?

536
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,402
Thirsty?

537
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,612
Were you here when
I was talking about how broke I was?

538
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,656
Were you around for that section?

539
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,826
So what do people with no money do?
They -

540
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,912
They loiter at libraries.

541
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,206
They wear plastic bags
for shoes and hats.

542
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,083
- Mm-hmm.
- They go to the park.

543
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,419
- They do a lot of park sitting.
- We could go to the park.

544
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:59,505
We could. It's nippy.
It's a bit nippy.

545
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,966
Do you know that Gilda Radner Way
is right there?

546
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,051
- I did know that.
- I never knew that.

547
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:07,430
Yep. I've actually always wanted
to establish a headquarters there.

548
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,098
- A headquarters?
- Mm-hmm.

549
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,934
Interesting. One of many headquarters.
One of a constellation.

550
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,938
- I'm gonna start a bunch of headquarters.
- Interesting. Cool.

551
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,567
I live, like, four blocks from here, and
my mom and sister are gone for the week.

552
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,569
- That's great.
- We could have tea.

553
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,988
- Sounds like an indoor park.
- It's nice.

554
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,782
So, yeah. I don't have
any beer or anything, but -

555
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,993
- It'll do. Let's do it.
- Okay. It's this way.

556
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,537
- That way? Great.
- Awesome.

557
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:37,502
Before you got here,
someone offered me marijuana.

558
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,921
Did they offer it to you too?

559
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,592
So, yeah, this is my mom's studio.

560
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,220
Mm. It's nice.

561
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,931
It's big. It's huge.

562
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,183
- Pretty big.
- What does she do?

563
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,185
- She's an artist.
- Oh, yeah?

564
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,811
Mm-hmm.

565
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,899
- What kind?
- Photos, mostly.

566
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,863
- Photos of really small things.
- Yeah, for the most part.

567
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,115
- These are miniatures, right?
- Mm-hmm.

568
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,201
That's cool.

569
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,627
- And she's successful?
- Yeah, she's pretty successful.

570
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:22,630
We live upstairs, but I just came
down here to feed my hamster...

571
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,966
- whose name is actually Gilda.
- A hamster?

572
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,676
- Yeah.
- Old-school.

573
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,386
Yeah.

574
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,888
Look. Check her out.

575
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,558
She's so cute.
She's asleep in her food bowl.

576
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,145
Ah.

577
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:42,108
I don't want to be a downer, but that -
I'm pretty sure this animal is dead.

578
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:46,153
No way. She's just asleep
on her side, really comfortable.

579
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,155
See how she's not moving
when you do that?

580
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,199
Look at her eyes.

581
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,662
She's definitely - She's gone.

582
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,789
She's passed.

583
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,584
Oh, my God.

584
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,336
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

585
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,840
Yeah, I think you're right.
I think that she is dead.

586
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,135
- Okay.
- I wouldn't - Yeah.

587
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,347
Are you sure I can just
put her in the freezer?

588
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,683
[Chuckles]
Mm-hmm. I'm positive.

589
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,311
Just make sure that bag
is tightly sealed.

590
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:23,316
I'm so sorry.
What a weird introduction to my house.

591
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,068
It's okay.
It's a beautiful house.

592
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,863
- It's gorgeous. Huge.
- It's not mine, obviously.

593
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,198
I've actually only been back here
for, like, two weeks.

594
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:34,035
I was in college in Ohio,
and I stayed there for the summer.

595
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,829
And so now I'm planning to move out,
but I needed to get a job first...

596
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,498
and now I'm starting
a new job tomorrow.

597
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,459
Tomorrow? Wow. Cool.
Doin' what?

598
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:44,712
- I'm a hostess.
- A hostess? Interesting.

599
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,548
At this place just around the corner
called Clandestino.

600
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,926
It's closed during the day,
so basically my job is just to...

601
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:53,929
take reservations, make sure
nothing disastrous happens.

602
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,057
And they call that being a hostess?

603
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,225
- Mm-hmm.
- That's generous.

604

it might be the best fit.

00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,105
Yeah.

760
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:10,402
8:45 we could do.
That would work well.

761
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,739
Mm-hmm.
That's a party of four?

762
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,782
Three? Okay.

763
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,955
Thank you. Yeah.
Have a lovely day.

764
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:28,337
Who makes reservations
at a restaurant? I would never do that.

765
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:32,799
Parenthetically, I just told that customer
that our house red has grape-y undertones.

766
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:35,135
- [Snickers]
- I really like your chef outfit.

767
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,305
Thank you.
So how are - how are things?

768
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,891
Um, I'm really tired.

769
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:45,103
I took three Klonopin and woke up
next to a spoonful of peanut butter.

770
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,773
- You like pills?
- Yeah.

771
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,817
- You?
- Love.

772
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,445
What can you get for me?

773
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,656
I personally don't have
any prescriptions...

774
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:58,617
but my friend Charlotte
has an extremely generous doctor.

775
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,328
Well, if you could
get me some Vicodin...

776
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,330
I would be forever grateful.

777
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,374
It's like -
[Chuckles]

778
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,628
It's like lying naked
on a bearskin rug next to a fire.

779
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,672
Nice.

780
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,194
Whatcha doin'?

781
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:37,906
Oh, I just...
I got this e-mail from this...

782
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,867
terrible girl I used to know.

783
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,953
Like a girlfriend-type terrible girl?

784
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,747
No, it's this girl I met
at this, um, coffee shop...

785
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:50,335
this, like, horrible trendy coffee shop
in, um, Wicker Park.

786
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:55,299
And, uh, she had seen a few
of my videos and was just, you know...

787
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:58,552
she was just on my jock,
like, really bad.

788
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,220
On your jock?

789
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,015
She was just pushing,
you know, like, hard.

790
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:06,268
Hmm. So did you, like,
date her or -

791
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:10,772
Uh, no. The thing about her is, like,
she was just really, like -

792
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,942
She was extremely forthcoming
with the blowies.

793
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,320
- Like, crazily so.
- Whoa.

794
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:18,947
Yeah, like really, really, really into it.

795
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,491
Like, it got to the point that we weren't
even, like, talking or making out.

796
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,244
It was just like, "hello"
and, like, straight to blowie.

797
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,371
- That seems like it's not -
- It was fine. It was fine.

798
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:30,417
But it - You know, you also have
to live your life, and it was taking over.

799
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,545
The only time I'd get stuff done
were in the 15 minutes it would take for me...

800
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,547
to reconstitute my boner.

801
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,883
Otherwise, like, my life
was just overrun by this.

802
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,426
- Gross.
- Yeah.

803
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,304
- So I had to walk away eventually. Eventually.
- That must have been hard.

804
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,015
Mm. Yeah.
No pun intended.

Hey.

What's goin' on downstairs?

Same shit, different day.

Those guys are such
fuckin' dirtbags, man.

Cum Omelet on somebody's iPhone.

814
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:23,136
- What is Cum Omelet?
- A porn video.

815
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:27,099
- What happens in it?
- Pretty self-explanatory.

816
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,768
A bunch of dudes come,
cook it in an omelet.

- Some chick has to eat it.

No.

Not a porn guy?

I wouldn't say that.
It's just, uh...

you ever see anything
with tentacle rape?

What is tentacle rape?

827
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,547
Tentacle rape.

- Porn-wise.
- Nothing.

- Yeah, right.
- I don't.

used to drag me to Waldenbooks...

00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,357
and make me look at this thing
called Sensual Abductions...

which is, like, stories about women
being kidnapped and ravaged and -

00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,697
That turn you on?

00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,242
None of your business.

Uh, you may have fallen
down a mine shaft.

I think I found us
an apartment on Craigslist...

but I need you to tell me
if it's a scam or not.

until 10:00 or 10:30 or so.

Okay. I might be out
with Charlotte then at some bar.

and wants me to go with her.

on a Greyhound bus?

about that all the time -

878
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,406
that I'm pregnant,
and that I don't know...

879
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,533
and then it's too late
for me to get an abortion.

says that the Greyhound bus...

882
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,668
is for the dregs of humanity,
so that doesn't surprise me.

to deal with that with my ex.

00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,413
Ten bottles of wine are gone.
One left.

910
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,208
Okay, I don't really know what to -

911
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,795
And who slept in my bed?
Somebody slept in my bed.

912
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:10,674
I slept in your bed. My mattress
is uncomfortable, so I slept in your bed.

913
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,636
Candice told me she saw some guy
walking around the loft at around 11:00 a. M...

914
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,180
after you went to work - way after.

915
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:20,350
What was Candice doing
walking around the loft?

916
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:23,103
Candice should stay in the studio.

917
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,605
- Candice is a bitch.
- Candice is a bitch?

918
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,066
- Yeah, Can-
- Candice works for me.

919
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,485
Candice comes up here to do things.

920
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:33,780
Candice is up and down,
up and down.

921
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:37,742
Okay. Well, it makes me uncomfortable,
the idea of Candice walking around my space.

922
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,869
Candice said the place
reeked of pot.

923
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,789
That was not my fault.
There's no way that was my fault.

924
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,583
You know that there's a kid
across the air shaft...

925
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,961
who smokes a ton of weed
and will never wave at Nadine.

926
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,797
Okay, but you didn't drink the wine.
Who drank the wine?

927
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:54,426
This is Charlotte. I think Charlotte
is such an incredibly bad influence.

928
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:58,805
- That's so untrue.
- She's unsupervised, out of control -

929
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,182
That's not true.
She's with her dad all the time.

930
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,184
He takes her to openings
all the time.

931
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,979
Bob would go to the opening
of a fucking envelope...

932
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:09,107
and I'm sure he wishes people
think that Charlotte's his date.

933
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,818
- He is so skeevy -
- You are being very cruel.

934
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:13,820
- No.
- Charlotte is my best friend.

935
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:15,822
For two weeks.
The last two weeks.

936
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:17,824
For my whole life
Charlotte's been my best friend...

937
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,410
and she's also the only person
who seems to care that I'm home.

938
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:22,454
All you seem to care about
is the wine...

939
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,497
and if you care so much,
I'll buy you new wine.

940
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:26,958
- With what money?
- I have a job.

941
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:30,003
Did you not hear me last week
when I told you that I have a job?

942
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:33,173
- I heard you. I heard you.
- I just got out of school.

This is a very hard time for me.

If you didn't notice,
I had my heart broken, okay?

945
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,681
I am a young, young person...

946
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,350
who is trying very hard.

947
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:46,644
And I don't know if you know
what it's like to have a job.

948
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:50,815
Did you ever have a job that wasn't just
taking pictures of stupid, tiny crap?

- No.
- Yeah!

Exactly! Exactly!

- No, I won't stop shrieking...

why you are doing this to me.

'Cause you two are
some kind of gang.

You don't hear anything I say.

961
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,598
You don't care
about anything I say or feel.

Neither of you.

And you're just looking at me
like I'm crazy, but I'm not crazy!

964
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,356
- No.
- This is my house too!

965
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,108
- I know.
- And nobody acts that way!

966
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:37,195
You act like it's all your house!
It's all your stupid shit!

00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,197
- Would you please just -
- It's all over the house!

00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,199
- Stop it!
- No! I hate you!

- Could you stop it, please?
- I really, really, really hate you!

- All right, all right.

Paper furniture. You want it?

I never had a job.

I never could do anything.
I had no motivation whatsoever.

- No.

- You didn't even listen.
- What?

996
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,582
I was wondering if maybe he could just
stay here for a couple of nights...

until he figured out somewhere else.

- No. That's really weird for Nadine.
- Why?

00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,381
Because her bed
is right through your wall.

00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,270
I am so sorry I'm late.
There was a whole thing -

1059
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:06,274
My mom locked herself out of the house,
and no one else has keys, and -

1060
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,527
- I really like your dress.
- It's a jumpsuit.

1061
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,613
Listen, Aura, I need you
to be here at 10:00 a. m. Sharp...

1062
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,615
when the phone starts ringing, okay?

1063
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:18,536
I mean, I can't be downstairs wondering
if you're up here doing your job.

1064
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:21,747
- I am really, really -
- No. It's no biggie. It's okay.

1065
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:33,426
How are the busboys treatin' you?
Anyone molest you yet today?

1066
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,428
- No one but you.
- [Chuckles]

1067
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,597
If I were gonna molest you,
you would know.

1068
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,807
Hey, I get off early tonight.
What are you doin'?

1069
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,768
- Um -
- I got a joint if you got those pills.

1070
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,479
- I could probably -
- Meet me at the corner of Houston and A...

1071
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:48,357
at 11:00.
[Clicks Tongue]

1072
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:55,781
We have to tart you up a bit.

1073
00:58:55,908 --> 00:58:57,783
Are you sure it's okay
if I take some Xanax?

1074
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,620
- I feel bad, but he really wants Xanax.
- It's absolutely fine.

1075
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:03,831
- Maybe you should surprise him with oxys.
- What about this?

1076
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,833
What do you think of this?

1077
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,961
Absolutely not. You need something
that shows your little tits off.

1078
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:12,256
You have the greatest little tits.
They're like a 1960s porn star...

1079
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,926
with those puffy little nipples you have.

1080
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,386
Oh, my God. That reminds me of this thing
that I just read in my mom's journal.

1081
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,347
It's so funny. Listen to this.

1082
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,307
Okay.

1083

"I think of myself a lot
as this weird mutation from the '50s.

What a disgusting thought. "

1085
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:31,317
You know, I know how she feels.
Sometimes I think of myself...

1086
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,195
as Tribeca's solution
to Marianne Faithfull.

1087
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:37,949
Charlotte, I feel so unprepared. Okay,
so I go there and meet him on the corner.

1088
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,201
We smoke a joint,
and then what do I do?

1089
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,954
Just take him somewhere
and grab his cock.

1090
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,539
You know,
just do something spontaneous.

1091
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,541
I don't know.
I'm not awesome like you.

1092
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:50,670
I just broke up with a male feminist
after three years. I'm not a cock-grabber.

1093
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,589
Let me tell you something.
When I was 16...

1094
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,675
I was absolutely
in love with this man.

1095
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,927
I mean,
I was head over heels for him.

1096
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:00,263
One time we were in SoHo...

1097
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:02,640
and we broke
into this residential park...

1098
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,184
and it was late at night,
and it was raining.

1099
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:09,146
And it was so romantic.
And I was so sure he'd kiss me.

1100
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:11,857
And then he just reached over...

1101
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:14,026
and he just grabbed my cunt.

1102
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,529
And I was really traumatized.

1103
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:20,199
I was supersad for, like,
a long time after that.

1104
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,201
And then one day I just got over it...

1105
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,912
and I realized that
that's what you call "spontaneous. "

1106
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,456
I guess so.

1107
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,583
You know what?
Just wear my top.

1108
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,713
It's the only option.

1109
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,174
You don't have to do this. It's a beautiful
tank top, but you don't have to do this.

1110
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,593
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

1111
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,888
Hopefully he'll replace this awful Jeb.

1112
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:45,391
- Jed.
- Whatever. That guy's a loafer...

1113
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,226
and he doesn't deserve you.

1114
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,270
I don't deserve you.

1115
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,272
Speaking of which...

1116
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:54,400
my father's friend Philippe
is curating this show in Dumbo.

1117
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,360
It's this group show.

1118
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,654
And I said that we're gonna
put one of your pieces in.

1119
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,406
- Really?
- Yeah.

1120
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,700
It's gonna be put on one
of those cool little white monitors...

1121
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,911
- and I think it's a great opportunity.

Hi, Siri.

1124
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:13,461
Oh! Sweetie. Long time.

1125
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:15,921
You reek of cigarettes,
and I owe your mom a call.

1126
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,882
Oh, no. I wouldn't worry about it.

1127

She's pretty distracted by this...

1128
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,219
sheepherder she's fucking.

1129
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:26,182
All the frozen entrees are gone,
with the exception of this?

1130

- Oh, my God. Is that your dead rat?
- I'm really sorry.

1131

I have not found a place to bury Gilda yet,
but I will buy you new ones.

1132

My paycheck comes next week.

1133
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,734
I wouldn't get too excited
about that paycheck.

1134
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:40,363
It's pretty disappointing.
After a while, I just stopped picking mine up.

1135

This is not a bed-and-breakfast.

of entitlement as my daughter?

Oh, believe me, mine is much worse.

Can't believe he stood me up.

1143
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,424
Dude sounds like a real meatball.

1144
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,177
Should I give him a second chance?

1145
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:47,179
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

1146
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,140
No way.

No way. Absolutely not.

You get ditched like that once, that's it.
That's a - That's a life ban.

That's forever.

Not always.
I feel like there's a situation -

1151
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:01,360
There's no fuckin' situation.
That's it.

make out or some
fucking nonsense, you know?

it's supposed to be, you know?

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

He's only been in my room.

He's in my laundry room
mixing lights and darks.

01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:55,010
And I hope that we can
hang out more before you go.

1206
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,346
Okay. Well, we'll see.

1207
01:06:57,472 --> 01:07:00,641
I'm staying all the way in Queens,
which is a bit of a trek, but -

1208
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:02,226
- Okay.
- We'll see.

1209
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:05,354
All right.
I'm a cowboy at dusk.

1210
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,439
Bye.

1211
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:24,748
Hey, what's up?
Where's Jed?

1212
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:28,293
- Mom made me kick him out.
- Ooh, bummer.

1213
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:31,797
Is it okay if I have
a few kids over later?

1214
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:35,926
- How many is a few?
- I don't know. Like, six or something?

1215
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,470
## [Techno]

1216
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:50,858
What the hell is going on here?

1217
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:53,068
More kids came than I thought
were gonna come.

1218
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,904
Uh, yeah, I should say so.
There's, like, 25 kids here.

1219
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:59,366
Mom's not gonna be home till 1:00.
It's not that big a deal.

1220
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,952
Maybe it's not a big deal to you.
It's a big deal to me.

1221
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,371
Having drunk minors
in the house is a liability.

1222
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,498
No one here is drunk.

1223
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:11,920
Oh, my God.
You've got to turn the music down.

1224
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:14,131
I'm not in charge of the music.

1225
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:19,219
Excuse me.
You have got to turn the music down.

1226
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,721
What?

1227
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:23,724
You have got to turn the music down.

1228
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,935
## [Volume Increases]

1229
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:34,485
- I came as soon as I could.
- They're out of control.

1230
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:37,863
Don't worry. Wrangling
teenage boys is a specialty of mine.

1231
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:43,577
The problem isn't the volume.
It's that there's nothing danceable.

1232
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,538
You guys are playing all this shit.

1233
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,749
How about something to move to?

1234
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,751
[Boy]
Oh, my - Oh!

1235
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:54,463
And if you get a fucking boner,
I'll kill you.

1236
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:59,301
- Charlotte, please come with me.
- I can't move to this.

1237
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,220
I just can't move.

1238
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,472
[Boy]
Holy shit.

1239
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,061
God, they are out of control.

1240
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,773
- You were right.
- Oh, really?

1241
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,901
Yeah, they're really being bad.

1242
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:20,656
Look, what can I do?
Do you want something to eat?

1243
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:23,242
Listen, I want something to eat.
Let's go into the kitchen.

1244
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,662
Let's scrum into the kitchen
and get a crust of bread or cheese.

1245
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:31,583
I feel very hot
and dizzy and constricted.

1246
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,752
Right, yeah.

1247
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,547
Well, um, we can fix it.

1248
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,882
## [Rock Blaring]

1249
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:58,402
Nadine?

1250
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,571
You are going to listen
to me right now.

1251
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,282
Do you hear something?
I just hear absolutely nothing.

1252
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:07,953
[Boy] Yeah, I just got a picture of your sister
and her friend walking by. No pants.

1253
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:11,540
Haven't you ever been
to the beach, you silly sod?

1254
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:15,294
You are going to come into the kitchen,
and you're going to talk to me.

1255
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,296
- Nope.
- Come with me now.

1256
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,298
I'm not speaking to you.

1257
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:22,050
Like hell you're not speaking to me.

1258
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,975
- What?
- I don't get why you care.

1259
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,728
- You don't get why I care?
- No, I don't get why you care.

1260
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:35,898
I think the issue is that
it reflects badly on Aura's authority.

1261
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:37,983
You know what else reflects badly?

1262
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:41,653
Walking through my party
with no pants on.

1263
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,822
- That's a good point.
- So you admit it's a party?

1264
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:46,658
I admit it's humiliating
because you're so desperate...

1265
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:51,038
that you crave attention from
17-year-old boys, that's what I admit.

1266
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:55,334
Okay, you can be mad about the way
I handled this or whatever, but this is your bad.

1267
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:58,837
There are 25 kids here.
They are drinking. They are making -

1268
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:01,715
And you're so desperate
it's disgusting...

1269
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:05,135
and you put yourself on YouTube
so millions of people can see you...

1270
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,180
and that homeless guy who was staying
in our house wouldn't even fuck you.

1271
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:10,682
And to be honest, I'm ashamed
we have the same mother.

1272
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,976
I'm ashamed
because you disgust me.

1273
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,020
You fucking disgust me!

1274
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:17,189
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Don't hit me!

1275
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:19,524
Don't hit me because it doesn't hurt!

1276
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:22,819
I think this is wildly unnecessary.
You two are both artic...

1277
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:25,364
I don't like to get mad at people
who aren't in my family...

1278
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:27,991
but no one cares what you think.

1279
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,285
- Do not -
- Don't hit me again.

1280
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:34,373
Go to your fucking room.
Go to your fucking room!

1281
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:42,255
[Snoring]

1282
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:47,636
Charlotte?

1283
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:49,763
- Charlotte?
- [Snorts]

1284
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:52,724
Charlotte, will you move over
just a little bit, please?

1285
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,228
[Snorts]

[Snoring]

1287
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,994
Mom.

1288
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,079
- Mom.
- Hmm?

1289
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:17,082
Were there any kids here
when you got home?

1290
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,001
No, no kids.

1291
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:20,669
- Mom?
- Hmm?

1292
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:23,171
Charlotte is asleep in my bed,
and she's taking up the whole thing...

1293
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:26,591
- and it's making me really sad.
- That's good.

1294
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,260
Mom?

1295
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:31,596
I took an Ambien.
[Mumbling]

1296
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:33,598
Can I sleep in here?

1297
01:12:33,725 --> 01:12:35,642
No room.

1298
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:46,653
[Whispers]
Nadine?

1299
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,655
[Mumbles]
What? What?

1300
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:51,825
I'm really sorry about earlier, okay?
You just put me in a really bad position.

1301
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:55,120
Okay, it's fine. It's fine.

1302
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:57,831
- Nadine?
- What?

1303
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:01,084
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1304
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,883
No! No!

1305
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:09,718
Shh!

1306
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,717
[Line Ringing]

1307
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:57,390
- [Frankie] Hi!
- Hey.

1308
01:13:57,517 --> 01:14:01,353
I'm literally packing
the last box as we speak.

1309
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:04,106
This may be
the first time in my life...

1310
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,858
that I'm completely ready
for something.

1311
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,902
I just quit my job.

1312
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:12,572
At the restaurant?
Didn't you just start?

1313
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:15,242
Yeah, well,
it was really boring, and shitty...

1314
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:17,327
and I have a college degree...

1315
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:20,872
so I didn't really see any reason
to continue with that.

1316
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,334
We picked the worst
possible time to graduate.

1317
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,878
But the good news is
rents are lower...

1318
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,714
so we can find a place
that's in our price range...

1319
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:32,509
that isn't, like, a total roach motel.

1320
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:37,097
Frankie, I don't feel like this is
the best time for me to do this.

1321
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:39,724
If it's a financial thing,
my dad said that he can...

1322
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:42,310
cover security and first month's...

1323
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:45,147
and you can just get us back later.

1324
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:47,149
[Sighs]
I mean, it is that.

1325
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:50,443
It's definitely that, 'cause I don't have
a job anymore. But it's also not that.

1326
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:54,781
My mom is becoming, you know,
sort of dependent on having me around.

1327
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:57,909
I help watch the house.
I take care of Nadine.

1328
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:01,204
And I really had trouble
making this decision...

1329
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:05,041
but I realized it's the best thing
for me to be at home right now.

1330
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:08,253
And I feel pretty guilty going.

1331
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:10,297
Okay.

1332
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:14,467
And you couldn't have told me
about this a little earlier?

1333
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:17,721
I get there tomorrow, Aura.

1334
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:21,224
I kind of didn't know until today,
and I figured that you're staying with Jess...

1335
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,269
so you're not gonna be completely
homeless when you get here.

1336
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:26,354
Yeah, temporarily.

1337
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,315
But I need a roommate.

1338
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,317
Craigslist?

1339
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:32,944
Someone just got murdered
off Craigslist.

1340
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:48,126
"I better watch it.
I'm a little worried about me.

1341
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:50,629
I am not behaving
in a rational manner.

1342
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:53,048
I am creating enemies
left and right.

1343
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,383
Alienating people,
particularly Michelle.

1344
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:58,929
I just got afraid that I was
similar to Ed, the landlord.

1345
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:01,306
Here's a new list
of things I want:

1346
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:04,809
A violin bow, a lover - and please
let it work to make me happy.

1347
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:07,312
My luck in love
is always so poor.

1348
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,105
To start getting
my art together...

1349
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:12,192
to weigh 128 to 125
and be happy...

1350
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:15,654
a toe operation,
a dulcimer, a black beret...

1351
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:18,490
sunglasses, new journal,
the floor sanded...

1352
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:21,576
to learn to use a dark room,
and to make little movies...

1353
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:24,788
ones that have me in them. "

1354
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:29,209
- [Aura] You okay?
- Mm-hmm, I'm okay.

1355
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:32,128
My lower back feels
like it's about to spasm.

1356
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:34,839
How do I look?

1357
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:37,592
Positively model-esque.
Where are you going?

1358
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:39,594
Some Dalton party.

1359
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,680
I like it when you go out because...

1360
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:44,015
I do not like what happens
when you stay in.

1361
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:48,853
Mom, Charlotte put my video
in this opening in Dumbo...

1362
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:52,857
and I'm gonna go, so that means
neither of us will be here.

1363
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:54,693
You gonna be okay?

1364
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,903
She's just gonna watch
Rachel Maddow, eat macaroons...

and lay on the heating pad.

1366
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,366
I'll be fine.

01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:05,870
- [Aura] I'm nervous.
- [Charlotte] Well, don't be.

1368
01:17:05,997 --> 01:17:08,832
It's more like a salon
than a gallery.

1369
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,668
But what if my work isn't right
for an art context?

1370
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:14,296
[Charlotte] I think everything's
right for every context.

1371
01:17:14,422 --> 01:17:17,549
- And you can quote me.
- Also, I texted the chef.

- Oh, that's why you're nervous.

Ignore. Ignore.

[Charlotte]
Doesn't it look great?

1376

[Aura]
I don't know. There's no sound.

1377
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:38,320
[Charlotte]
No, but the placement is beautiful.

1378
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:42,949
Plus, you're just so concerned
with having things look polished and perfect.

1379
01:17:44,035 --> 01:17:46,494
Any exposure's good exposure.

1380
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,496
I guess.

- Who?

1382
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:55,962

He curated this whole thing.

1383

He is old like a dad.

No. You have to get what I'm into.

Oh, whoa! You're here!

1393
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:27,118
Well, I figured I had to
track you down somehow.

1394
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:29,621
You didn't text me back the address...

1395
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:32,916
so I've literally been wandering
around the neighborhood for an hour.

I'm so sorry.
You look beautiful.

- Oh.

1398
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:42,592
It's just the college fountain video.
You've seen it before.

- Oh, yeah. Childhood tales.

Aura likes to make it sound
like I was the naughty one...

1403
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:55,188
but she was such a selfish cunt.

1404

But, you know, all relationships
have a mythology, don't they?

I guess we're not in Kansas anymore.

Did you throw out your clogs?

1412

I didn't.
I mean, they're somewhere.

I don't know where,
but they're somewhere.

How's staying with Steph? I feel like
her newfound lesbianism would be a huge -

1415
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:28,138
If we're really gonna talk,
we should just go somewhere.

What do you mean?

01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:35,687

some things to discuss.

01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:44,863
You decided you didn't want to
live together, and that's fine...

1421
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:47,824
but you told me
the day before I arrived...

1422
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:51,661
after barely responding
for weeks to any of my calls.

1423
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,872
I didn't decide
I didn't want to live together.

1424
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,583
I told you my mom
actually needs me.

1425
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:59,252
And that's totally okay...

1426

but I haven't been able
to reach you for so long.

- He's here. He's over there.

- No way.
- Yeah.

- Just go over and say hi...

01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:17,187
- and, you know -
- Ask if he wants to see my video.

No, he doesn't want to see
your fucking video.

01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,441
Hi, Mommy.

1509
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:24,864
What's up?

1510
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:30,411
What, are you mad at me?

1511
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:33,080
What do you think?

1512
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:35,458
I'm home now, okay?
I'm about to take out the trash.

1513
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:37,627
I took it out already.

1514
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,755
What about your back?

1515
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:43,507
What about my back?
It really hurts.

1516
01:27:43,634 --> 01:27:47,511
So you didn't have to do that.
I told you I was coming home.

1517
01:27:47,638 --> 01:27:51,557
Since when do you do any of the things
you say you're gonna do lately?

1518
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,560
Okay, we've had this conversation.

1519
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,480
I don't want to have to say this
over and over. I'm figuring it out.

1520
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:59,565
Oh, my God.
"Mom, I'm figuring it out.

1521
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,026
Mom, I'm on it.
Mom, I'm all over it. "

1522
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:05,571
I am so sick of your words.

1523
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:12,495
Come on.

1524
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:15,706
Do you like living here?

1525
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:20,962
That is such a ridiculous question.
I love living here.

1526
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,174
Well, I don't think you love it
as much as you think you do.

1528
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:39,730
Boss me around a little bit.

1529
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:08,592
Can I come in?

1530
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:10,594
Mm-hmm.

1531
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:28,112
Do you want me to rub
your back for a minute?

1532
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:30,156
Mm-hmm.

1533
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:40,416
Do you want me to tell you
where it hurts?

1534
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,960
No, I can figure it out.

1535
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:53,137
You know, if filmmaking
doesn't work out...

1536
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:56,140
you could always be
a massage therapist.

1537
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:59,935
You have a v-
very intuitive touch...

1538
01:30:00,062 --> 01:30:02,313
kind of like my sister.

1539
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:12,573
Do you remember when I was little,
and I wanted to be a makeup artist?

1540
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:14,909
Mm-hmm.

1541
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:17,745
Your poor babysitters and Nadine.

1542
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:23,209
You said I would be something
better than a makeup artist...

1543
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:26,837
but I thought being
a makeup artist sounded fine.

1544
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:29,632
It is fine. It's all fine.

1545
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,721
No, I don't want
to be a makeup artist...

1546
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:38,349
and I don't want to be
a massage therapist...

1547
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:42,478
and I don't want to be a day hostess.

1548
01:30:44,314 --> 01:30:47,483
I want to be
as successful as you are.

1549
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,527
Oh, you will be
more successful than I am.

1550
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:51,904
Really, believe me.

1551
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:59,120
I want to be as successful as Nadine.

1552
01:30:59,246 --> 01:31:01,205
Now, that's gonna be harder.

1553
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:07,336
She's a little obnoxious
with all that, anyway.

1554
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:12,716
I read your journal
from when you were my age.

1555
01:31:13,844 --> 01:31:15,761
I don't care.

1556
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:20,182
I mean, I didn't read the whole thing.
I just read part of it, but -

1557
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:23,060
I figured you knew where they were.

1558
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:25,771
Yeah, if you didn't want me to read it,
you shouldn't have just left it right out there...

1559
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:28,440
in the lightbulb cabinet
where anyone could find it.

1560
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:30,192
I really don't care...

1561
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:33,112
and I'm sure
they're not that interesting, and...

1562
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:37,324
frankly, I can't remember
anything I wrote.

1563
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,618
Mostly about food.

1564
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:44,832
- Who was Ed?
- Ed?

1565
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,834
Yeah, you wrote a lot
about someone named Ed.

1566
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,420
Oh. Ooh, Ed.

1567
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:54,091
Sheila and I rented a corner of his loft
and ended up paying most of his rent.

1568
01:31:55,302 --> 01:31:58,095
- Where was it?
- On the Bowery.

1569
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:00,097
You lived there?

1570
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:02,141
We lived there, he lived there...

1571
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:06,228
and his girlfriend used to come
and paint in a corner every day.

1572
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:10,232
They had these unbelievable
screaming fights.

1573
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:12,610
And I'd met them both
at a meditation conference...

1574
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:15,946
so I found the whole thing very, very un-Zen,
if you know what I mean.

1575
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:17,615
Mm-hmm.

1576
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:20,075
Anyway, one day he came in...

1577
01:32:20,202 --> 01:32:23,120
and started screaming at her.

1578
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:25,080
And he left.

1579
01:32:25,207 --> 01:32:29,251
And I walked over to her corner,
and she was crying and painting...

1580
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,253
and painting while she was crying...

1581
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,422
and I said, "Excuse me.

1582
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:36,091
I hope you don't think
this is rude or forward...

1583
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:38,802
but I overheard your fight...

1584
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:40,930
and I think you were really right...

1585
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:44,308
and he was really, really wrong. "

1586
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:47,978
And from that point on
we became best friends.

1587
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:51,941
- Who was Phil?
- Phil...

1588
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:55,402
was a guy
who didn't like sex very much.

1589
01:32:57,656 --> 01:33:00,950
- Was he your boyfriend?
- Oh, no. Not really.

1590
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:03,661
Seems like you had
sort of a lot of boyfriends.

1591
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:06,121
I didn't at all.

1592

I was just trying stuff out...

probably kind of like what you're doing.

1594

I met up with that chef from work.

No, he has a girlfriend.

- No. I wish.

No, worse than that.
