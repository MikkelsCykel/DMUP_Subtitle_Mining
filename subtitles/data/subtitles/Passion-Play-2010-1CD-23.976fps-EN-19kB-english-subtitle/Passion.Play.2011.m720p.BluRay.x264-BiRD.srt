1
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:47,363
Hey, Billy.

2
00:01:47,447 --> 00:01:49,198
It's Thursday.
Come back tomorrow.

3
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:52,034
No, it's actually
Friday, ya cheap prick.

4
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:53,244
Hey!

5
00:01:59,876 --> 00:02:01,335
Junkie putz.

6
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:19,955
You gonna kill
me out here?

7
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:09,857
Hey!

8
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:10,983
Hey!

9
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:24,139
And that so lamely
and unfashionable,

10
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:28,102
that dogs bark at me
as I go by them.

11
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:31,271
Discounts on my
known deformities.

12
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:33,482
Milagros.

13
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:35,484
I give you heaven...

14
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,072
And I give you hell.

15
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,034
Hey, mister.

16
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,744
I had some car trouble
out in the desert.

17
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:47,996
I need to use
the telephone.

18
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:51,375
One American dollar.

19
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:54,294
Sure.

20
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:01,802
It's inside.

21
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:05,264
It's all inside.

22
00:07:05,306 --> 00:07:07,266
It's all inside.

23
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:08,767
All your dreams come true inside this tent.

24
00:07:08,852 --> 00:07:11,311
Hombres, juanitas,

25
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:14,231
open your knees
and feel the breeze.

26
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:28,328
Hey, brother,
you have a phone around here?

27
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:36,665
Excuse me.

28
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:38,000
You girls seen
this chick with...?

29
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:39,293
Yeah, she's
over there.

30
00:09:39,377 --> 00:09:40,586
Thank you.

31
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:02,190
What?

32
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:04,443
Hey.

33
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:05,986
What do you want?

34
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,863
Sorry, I didn't
mean to be staring.

35
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:10,949
Yeah you did. You paid
to stare. Show's over.

36
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,666
Are you deaf?

37
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,045
Are you real?

38
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,797
What do you think?

39
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:27,799
Well, I think no.

40
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:30,469
All right then.
Get lost.

41
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:33,138
Hey, hey. Sweetheart.
Please, I am lost.

42
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:35,015
Look, I scream and
five guys with tire irons...

43
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:36,642
come and beat you
into pudding.

44
00:10:36,726 --> 00:10:38,226
Please don't do that.

45
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:40,228
My name's Nate.

46
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:41,813
Nate Poole.

47
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:45,525
I play trumpet
back in the city.

48
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,236
Look, I've been up all night long
walking through the desert.

49
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:49,946
All I want is a drink...

50
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:52,699
and just a place to sit down for a while.

51
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,493
I ain't gonna cause
you no trouble.

52
00:10:54,577 --> 00:10:56,870
I just want a place to
sit down and think about...

53
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:59,873
what I'm gonna do.

54
00:10:59,957 --> 00:11:02,250
What kind
of music?

55
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:05,337
Mm. Oh, what difference
does that make?

56
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,590
Hey. Really
nice music.

57
00:11:12,428 --> 00:11:13,428
One drink.

58
00:11:28,027 --> 00:11:29,861
I'm drinking gin.

59
00:11:29,904 --> 00:11:32,280
A girl after
my own heart.

60
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:40,455
Goddamn, life
is good.

61
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,999
Hour ago,
I was a dead man.

62
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:45,711
Now I'm drinking warm gin with an angel.

63
00:11:51,134 --> 00:11:55,470
So... mm... carny life, huh?

64
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:59,307
Yeah, Chiapas, Durango

65
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:02,644
yeah, the
full circuit.

66
00:12:02,729 --> 00:12:05,147
You ever been
to the States?

67
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:08,066
No, I've never been
there before.

68
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:12,154
Well, goddamn,
your English is pretty good.

69
00:12:12,238 --> 00:12:16,658
That's because of Sam. He, um,
he's from London, and so...

70
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:19,745
and because of the movies, they, um,
the small-town theaters

71
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:22,497
they hang sheets
on the walls

72
00:12:22,582 --> 00:12:25,500
and they show old movies
on Saturdays at night.

73
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:29,004
Huh. How long you
been an angel?

74
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:32,340
I'm not an angel.

75
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:35,010
I'm a bird woman.

76
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:37,137
I don't know, I, um...

77
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:40,640
couldn't get fat enough or grow
a beard and I hate snakes, so...

78
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,517
just nothing else left.

79
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:47,105
Well, hey,
it suits you.

80
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:49,357
Thanks.

81
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:51,151
I'm tired of them, though.

82
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:52,527
What's that?
The wings?

83
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:54,070
Yeah, they're heavy.

84
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:55,530
They hurt my shoulders
and my back

85
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:57,157
and I'm just, I'm
tired of them.

86
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:58,408
Well, why don't you just take them off?

87
00:12:58,493 --> 00:12:59,618
Why walk around in pain?

88
00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:01,036
I'll give you
a hand.

89
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,040
It's not...
I can do it, it's...

90
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:07,459
I feel like you should leave now.

91
00:13:07,502 --> 00:13:10,545
You know?

92
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,380
Okay, listen, uh

93
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:16,968
hey, thank you very
kindly for the drink.

94
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:19,721
Are you going back
to the States?

95
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:20,847
Yep.

96
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:26,144
Listen, uh...

97
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:29,064
if you'd like to get away
from all this, you know...

98
00:13:29,148 --> 00:13:31,650
you're welcome to go
back with me.

99
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:33,318
No, I can't.

100
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:39,199
You take care.

101
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,142
Mm.

102
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:40,468
Women.

103
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:42,804
Uh-huh.

104
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:45,599
You got
a girl?

105
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:49,811
They're creatures,
I mean it, freaks.

106
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:53,607
I found her
in the garbage.

107
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:58,486
An infant,
wet and crying in the garbage.

108
00:14:58,571 --> 00:15:03,992
And I plucked her away
from all that and I...

109
00:15:04,076 --> 00:15:08,246
I gave her a home.

110
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:10,832
Hey there. Uh...

111
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:14,294
her wings...

112
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:16,922
they're real?

113
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:18,465
Hm.

114
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:26,681
You know, man, I've been around the
block but I ain't never been around...

115
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:30,936
a neighborhood
like this.

116
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:36,232
Thank you.

117
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:39,361
Are you trying
to steal my Lily?

118
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:41,279
Is that why
you're here?

119
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:45,533
It is, isn't it?
Well, so be it!

120
00:15:45,618 --> 00:15:48,703
Hey, man,
I don't know what you're talking about.

121
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:50,622
I ain't trying to steal nobody, man,
I just...

122
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:52,457
listen, I don't
want your girl

123
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:58,338
I just wanna get the fuck outta this nut house.

124
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:01,383
Jesus.

125
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:05,887
Where's my Lily
gonna go?

126
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:08,473
What is there for a girl like that?
I'm her family.

127
00:16:08,516 --> 00:16:13,061
I protect her
from the real world.

128
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:15,563
Listen, Sam...
may I call you Sam?

129
00:16:15,648 --> 00:16:17,524
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

130
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:21,569
You know things now, sir.

131
00:16:23,572 --> 00:16:25,323
What if word got out
the girl's for real.

132
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:27,409
Wings.
For real.

133
00:16:27,493 --> 00:16:30,078
Listen, mister,
you ain't got nothing to worry about with me.

134
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:34,249
I just wanna
go on my way.

135
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,420
Hey, listen, lady,
I don't take kindly to snakes.

136
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:39,587
I'd appreciate it
if you'd just...

137
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:45,051
Fuck! Goddamn it!

138
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:46,678
What the fuck?

139
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:48,304
For a few seconds
before you die

140
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:53,351
you'll see the future
with great clarity.

141
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:57,480
Hey, get in!

142
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,113
So after Happy kills you

143
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:49,491
can I get your
record collection?

144
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:50,950
Jesus Christ,
come on, Harriet

145
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:53,161
you think I'd make
this shit up?

146
00:17:53,245 --> 00:17:55,663
No. Hey. You know,
some wandering Indians

147
00:17:55,748 --> 00:17:58,500
shoot Happy's guy seconds
before he's gonna shoot you

148
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:01,002
you walk all night through the desert on foot...

149
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,088
get captured by
some carny freaks...

150
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:06,758
almost bit by a ten foot long rattlesnake...

151
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:11,596
and then a beautiful and mysterious girl

152
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:15,266
You're enjoying
this, huh?

153
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:20,230
Jesus, Nate. You fucked his wife.
Everybody knows.

154
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:26,319
Nate... are
you there?

155
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:28,321
Are you... are you
listening to me?

156
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,002
Oh, Jesus Christ,
listen... hold...

157
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:45,046
Hey, listen.
You tell Happy...

158
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:46,464
set up a
meeting tomorrow.

159
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:48,007
A meeting?

160
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:49,676
At the Little
New Yorker. Lunchtime.

161
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,303
You want me to just call Happy Shannon.

162
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:54,305
Yeah, you call that prick
and you tell him...

163
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,183
Jesus Christ. You tell him,
bring a million dollars.

164
00:18:57,268 --> 00:18:59,269
Nate?
Nate?

165
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:00,895
Hey, kid, can I borrow
that camera for a second?

166
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,982
You're a dead man.

167
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:15,368
Wow!
Goddamn!

168
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:17,996
Did you see? Did you see?
I flew, I did, I flew.

169
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,497
Man, I didn't
think you could.

170
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,040
I can't.
I'm too big.

171
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,168
I'm too heavy for these to carry me

172
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:26,754
but sometimes when the wind is,
is strong enough...

173
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,756
Wait, I gotta get a picture of this.

174
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:30,300
Okay, but if
I don't like these

175
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:33,261
you're gonna throw
them away, okay?

176
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:35,013
I swear to God.

177
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:36,347
Just stand right over there by the way.

178
00:19:36,432 --> 00:19:37,515
You promise?

179
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:38,516
I swear!

180
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:45,190
Oh, just like that.

181
00:19:45,274 --> 00:19:46,357
Oh.

182
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,111
I don't believe it.

183
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:05,376
So what happened to you
out in the desert?

184
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:08,713
Oh. Son of a bitch
tried to kill me.

185
00:20:11,425 --> 00:20:12,884
Over a woman?

186
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,803
What else?

187
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:19,182
Did you love her?

188
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:21,476
Absolutely not.

189
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,395
Hm. That's
kind of sad.

190
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,065
How about you?

191
00:20:27,107 --> 00:20:30,276
Fast carny life.

192
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:32,153
Beautiful gal.

193
00:20:32,238 --> 00:20:34,072
You must have your share of men.

194
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:43,831
How come you
ran away?

195
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:47,126
It was time
to leave the nest.

196
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:48,586
Time to leave the nest.

197
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:52,173
How about a bite
of that apple?

198
00:20:52,258 --> 00:20:53,424
You steer?

199
00:21:04,478 --> 00:21:08,690
You are a pretty
little thing. Hm?

200
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:10,483
Thank you.

201
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:12,443
Thank your
mother and father.

202
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:14,779
I got it.

203
00:21:14,822 --> 00:21:16,572
Can I have my apple back?

204
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:55,820
Full bath.
Twin beds.

205
00:21:55,904 --> 00:21:58,656
And I can get you pizza delivered till eleven p.m.

206
00:21:58,741 --> 00:22:00,074
Oh, that would
be heavenly.

207
00:22:03,787 --> 00:22:06,247
She's a knockout,
Nate. A knockout.

208
00:22:06,332 --> 00:22:08,082
Listen. I
appreciate it.

209
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:11,419
Sure. You know,
even with the hump.

210
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:12,962
Know what
I mean?

211
00:22:46,663 --> 00:22:49,123
You ever smell
the ocean?

212
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:53,461
Sure. Yeah, I used
to work at this joint.

213
00:22:53,545 --> 00:22:57,799
A funky little place
right on the beach.

214
00:22:57,883 --> 00:23:01,761
Have you ever
seen the ocean?

215
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:02,720
Never?

216
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:03,388
Uh-uh.

217
00:23:03,472 --> 00:23:05,181
You ain't never
seen the ocean?

218
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:05,973
No.

219
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,728
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna take you to this place...

220
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:13,898
way up close you can see the
dolphins swimming all day long.

221
00:23:13,941 --> 00:23:15,942
Would you like
to do that?

222
00:23:16,026 --> 00:23:18,653
Yeah, I'd like
to see that.

223
00:23:18,737 --> 00:23:20,738
It's really beautiful.

224
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:26,244
You okay?

225
00:23:26,286 --> 00:23:28,121
Yeah.

226
00:23:28,205 --> 00:23:29,664
It's the wind.

227
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:35,795
I'm sorry. I must
look awful.

228
00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:39,507
Sweetheart, you could
never look really bad.

229
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:44,095
Hoo.

230
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:46,931
My back hurts.

231
00:23:48,684 --> 00:23:50,435
You, um...

232
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,687
you think it'd be okay if I took my coat off?

233
00:23:52,771 --> 00:23:56,691
'Cause that
would really help.

234
00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:58,151
Sure. Come here.

235
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:06,367
Mm.

236
00:24:06,452 --> 00:24:08,369
Holy shit.

237
00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:12,373
I'm telling you,
I'm never gonna get used to this.

238
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,583
Wow.

239
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:16,461
Nobody asked
you to.

240
00:24:16,503 --> 00:24:17,795
Hey, I didn't
mean it like that.

241
00:24:17,838 --> 00:24:19,046
It's fine.

242
00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:03,549
Hey, I, uh...

243
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:06,511
I said something
wrong to you.

244
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:08,513
I'm... I'm sorry.

245
00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:15,937
I know what I am, Nate.

246
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:43,774
Ah, fuck.

247
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:50,323
Oh, fuck.

248
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:52,491
She split, man.

249
00:26:52,576 --> 00:26:54,076
She what?

250
00:26:54,161 --> 00:26:56,162
Your honey, she left
a few hours ago.

251
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:56,871
Fuck.

252
00:26:56,955 --> 00:26:58,956
Oh, man, what do you
mean she split?

253
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:00,833
I mean she went
into the office,

254
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:02,209
she made a couple of phone calls and then she, uh,

255
00:27:02,294 --> 00:27:03,628
she hit the road.

256
00:27:03,712 --> 00:27:05,212
I n that old truck
you came in.

257
00:27:05,297 --> 00:27:06,339
Fuck.

258
00:27:12,804 --> 00:27:15,473
Anybody else use this phone after her?

259
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:17,350
Are you a police officer?

260
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:18,851
'Cause if there's some
sort of problem

261
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:20,603
I should call
the manager.

262
00:27:20,687 --> 00:27:22,730
Dr. Rosenblum's office.

263
00:27:22,814 --> 00:27:26,734
Uh, yeah, hey, listen, I'm
looking for, uh, for my wife.

264
00:27:26,818 --> 00:27:28,819
I believe she may
be a patient there.

265
00:27:28,862 --> 00:27:31,197
Uh, the name's,
uh, Luster.

266
00:27:31,281 --> 00:27:31,739
Luster...

267
00:27:31,823 --> 00:27:34,617
She's in consultation with the doctor right now.

268
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:36,744
Uh, what kind
of doctor?

269
00:27:36,828 --> 00:27:38,996
Doctor Rosenblum
is a plastic surgeon.

270
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:17,076
Get away from her.

271
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,203
Why are you
doing this?

272
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:21,288
Please don't
do this.

273
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:23,624
What, do you think that
I like being a freak?

274
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:26,627
Amazing as she is,
it's not a normal...

275
00:28:26,712 --> 00:28:28,754
Fuck normal.

276
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:35,469
Since when does normal win
a goddamn prize, huh?

277
00:28:35,554 --> 00:28:39,223
Lily. You're different.

278
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:42,226
Please don't do this.
Please.

279
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:45,896
But I could be like all the other girls.

280
00:28:45,939 --> 00:28:54,822
Never.

281
00:28:54,906 --> 00:28:56,657
I'm sorry, I think
I'm wasting your time.

282
00:28:56,742 --> 00:28:59,160
Sorry.

283
00:29:03,957 --> 00:29:05,958
I don't ever want
to hear

284
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:08,294
a goddamn word
about this ever.

285
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:11,255
Or I'll get your address
and I swear to God, Doc

286
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:13,132
I'll burn your
house down.

287
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,227
Thank you.

288
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:46,457
Hey, baby,
you still there?

289
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:47,792
I'm here.

290
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:49,460
Listen to me.

291
00:29:49,503 --> 00:29:51,128
This ain't no
pact with the devil.

292
00:29:51,213 --> 00:29:52,797
'Course it is.

293
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,465
It's your life
for hers.

294
00:29:54,508 --> 00:29:57,384
Oh, come on,
that's bullshit.

295
00:29:57,469 --> 00:30:01,305
So, uh,
being managed by a notorious killer pimp

296
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:03,057
is gonna help
this girl.

297
00:30:03,141 --> 00:30:04,683
Hey, listen, sweetheart,
he can make her rich.

298
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:06,310
He can make her dead.

299
00:30:06,394 --> 00:30:07,311
Come on, he ain't
gonna hurt her.

300
00:30:07,395 --> 00:30:08,062
Why not?

301
00:30:08,146 --> 00:30:10,648
'Cause I'm gonna
be there.

302
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,566
Please. You can't
protect yourself...

303
00:30:12,651 --> 00:30:14,151
Hey, listen,
just cool it, okay?

304
00:30:14,194 --> 00:30:15,736
Nothing's gonna
happen to this girl.

305
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:17,655
Happy'll never
even meet her, okay?

306
00:30:18,323 --> 00:30:19,073
All I'm doing is

307
00:30:19,157 --> 00:30:21,992
I'm giving Happy
a piece of Lily's future.

308
00:30:22,035 --> 00:30:24,912
All right? That's it.

309
00:30:24,996 --> 00:30:27,039
He'll make a fortune
on this thing.

310
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:28,374
Okay.

311
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,917
I'm gonna do everything.

312
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:32,002
He's not even
gonna meet her.

313
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:35,005
Hey, listen,
he's just gonna get his cut.

314
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:37,258
She know
about this?

315
00:30:37,342 --> 00:30:41,011
Hey, she trusts me.

316
00:30:41,054 --> 00:30:44,682
Okay. She
doesn't get hurt.

317
00:30:44,724 --> 00:30:47,351
What makes you so sure she
can make that kind of money?

318
00:30:47,435 --> 00:30:51,772
I mean,
this town's lousy with beautiful women.

319
00:30:51,857 --> 00:30:55,067
Nate?
What makes her so special?

320
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:58,279
What?
What makes her so special?

321
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:12,209
Her wings.
She's got wings.

322
00:31:12,294 --> 00:31:14,211
Uh-huh.

323
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:17,882
And I suppose you have
another picture of a jackalope

324
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:22,595
that could be available for the right price too, huh?

325
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:29,184
Are you frightened,
Mr. Poole?

326
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:38,319
God, you should be.

327
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:40,654
Listen to me.

328
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:43,657
I swear to God,
if I would've known that that was your wife

329
00:31:43,742 --> 00:31:45,117
I'd never
woulda touched her.

330
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:47,077
I don't have
a wife, Mr. Poole.

331
00:31:47,162 --> 00:31:49,413
I'm a widower.

332
00:31:49,497 --> 00:31:51,790
Yeah. Very sudden.

333
00:31:57,255 --> 00:32:01,133
Listen, hey man,
I know you want me dead, okay?

334
00:32:01,217 --> 00:32:03,510
I don't wanna die.

335
00:32:03,595 --> 00:32:05,346
I swear to God
this girl is for real.

336
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,598
I mean, I don't get it,
I don't understand it

337
00:32:07,682 --> 00:32:12,478
it's something freaky,
she's some kind of goddamn freak of nature.

338
00:32:12,562 --> 00:32:13,896
But she has wings.

339
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,532
So I get the angel...

340
00:32:25,617 --> 00:32:29,119
and you get
your life.

341
00:32:29,162 --> 00:32:34,625
Sounds... religious.

342
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:37,711
No, it's... it's
a little different.

343
00:32:37,796 --> 00:32:39,546
I was thinking more
you get a percent

344
00:32:39,631 --> 00:32:43,300
you get like 65, 75%.

345
00:32:43,385 --> 00:32:48,138
You get your piece and then I get,
I get my end, which is 20, 25%.

346
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:53,811
And I get my life.

347
00:32:53,853 --> 00:32:55,312
And the angel?

348
00:32:55,397 --> 00:32:56,814
Listen, she's
not an angel.

349
00:32:56,898 --> 00:32:58,023
She's just...

350
00:32:58,108 --> 00:33:02,194
Theology aside.

351
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:06,490
What's... what's to keep
me from just...

352
00:33:06,574 --> 00:33:08,575
blowing your
head off right now

353
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,578
and taking the girl?

354
00:33:11,663 --> 00:33:19,378
Hey, man,
you don't know where she is.

355
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:20,170
True.

356
00:33:20,213 --> 00:33:22,715
Until I get
Roland here

357
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,676
to peel off all your skin with a needle-nose pliers

358
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,261
and then you tell me where she is

359
00:33:27,345 --> 00:33:29,096
and the fastest
route to her.

360
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,098
I don't know
where she is, okay?

361
00:33:31,182 --> 00:33:32,891
A friend of mine is driving
her around in circles, okay?

362
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:35,728
And if I'm not at
the goddamn phone booth

363
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:38,439
saying all the right
things in 23 minutes

364
00:33:38,523 --> 00:33:40,357
he's gonna call
his cousin

365
00:33:40,442 --> 00:33:43,027
who's a homicide detective
and report my murder, okay?

366
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:48,115
She's gonna disappear, and they're
gonna investigate your ass, all right?

367
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:52,119
Happy, I mean, you know,
look at this like...

368
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:53,954
making a whole bunch
of money

369
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:56,081
and doing very little,
you know what I'm saying?

370
00:33:56,166 --> 00:34:01,712
Any idiot can fake a picture.

371
00:34:01,796 --> 00:34:04,298
I would need
to see her.

372
00:34:04,382 --> 00:34:06,425
Oh, man, no way,
you're gonna...

373
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:08,135
I'm no fucking idiot.

374
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,387
You're gonna snatch her
and kill me. Come on.

375
00:34:10,472 --> 00:34:13,432
You have my word.

376
00:34:13,516 --> 00:34:17,061
Hm. I have your word
as a gangster.

377
00:34:20,231 --> 00:34:30,157
As a gangster,
and as a partner.

378
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:34,119
Okay then, then we
have a deal?

379
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:38,624
You meet me at the opera house,
the new opera house

380
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:41,794
six o'clock
in the mezzanine.

381
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:45,005
It's a date.

382
00:34:48,134 --> 00:34:50,511
Can I leave?

383
00:34:50,595 --> 00:34:51,678
Please.

384
00:35:07,445 --> 00:35:10,114
You should kill
that fucker.

385
00:35:10,198 --> 00:35:15,327
Why the fuck did you make a
deal with that piece of shit?

386
00:35:15,411 --> 00:35:18,997
Wings.

387
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:20,958
What a
wonderful dream.

388
00:35:29,384 --> 00:35:31,635
Do you come up here a lot?

389
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:34,888
I come up here if
someone's playing that I like or...

390
00:35:34,973 --> 00:35:38,475
with someone
that I like.

391
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,478
You know, I knew
who you were.

392
00:35:41,563 --> 00:35:42,479
What?

393
00:35:42,564 --> 00:35:43,689
At Sam's.

394
00:35:43,773 --> 00:35:45,732
I'd seen
you before.

395
00:35:45,817 --> 00:35:48,402
Your pictures.
Your albums.

396
00:35:48,486 --> 00:35:51,488
Oh.

397
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:55,993
You were famous.

398
00:35:56,035 --> 00:35:58,203
Yeah, I was.

399
00:35:58,288 --> 00:35:59,830
Handsome.

400
00:35:59,873 --> 00:36:03,500
Now you're just
being mean.

401
00:36:03,585 --> 00:36:08,380
What happened?

402
00:36:08,464 --> 00:36:11,091
Man, I just couldn't
handle it, you know

403
00:36:11,176 --> 00:36:13,510
I just couldn't handle
the small talk.

404
00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:17,347
You know, the bullshit,
all the politics, that crap.

405
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:22,352
No, I just
had my music

406
00:36:22,395 --> 00:36:27,608
and my dope,
and in the end it was all about the dope.

407
00:36:27,692 --> 00:36:33,071
And now?

408
00:36:33,156 --> 00:36:37,618
You can talk
to me.

409
00:36:37,702 --> 00:36:40,454
Yeah, I can
talk to you.

410
00:36:40,538 --> 00:36:42,039
You're different.

411
00:36:42,123 --> 00:36:44,625
Yeah.

412
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:47,544
A couple
of freaks.

413
00:36:47,629 --> 00:36:50,047
Let's just say
we're different.

414
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:52,758
Hm?

415
00:37:03,478 --> 00:37:05,604
It's five til.

416
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:07,981
Fifty bucks the asshole don't show.

417
00:37:11,236 --> 00:37:13,695
♫ Been rocking in the morning ♫

418
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,156
♫ Been rocking all night long ♫

419
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:21,995
♫ Oh, rocking in the morning ♫

420
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,830
Hold on. Hold on.

421
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:25,832
This stage has
got to move.

422
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:27,459
We got to rock
this theater.

423
00:37:27,543 --> 00:37:28,919
Mitch is going to be
here tonight

424
00:37:28,962 --> 00:37:30,754
with all them dances
and everything.

425
00:37:30,797 --> 00:37:32,506
We got to pick this tempo up,
change the key

426
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,925
and let's hear it
one time. Come on.

427
00:37:34,968 --> 00:37:36,218
Put your soul in it.

428
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:37,469
All right, where
is he, huh?

429
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:38,011
What'd I tell you?

430
00:37:38,096 --> 00:37:40,430
We shoulda broken his goddamn
face when we had the chance.

431
00:37:40,515 --> 00:37:42,266
Now what?

432
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:46,853
Excuse me.
This is for you.

433
00:37:46,938 --> 00:37:49,439
"Let the girl
do her job.

434
00:37:49,482 --> 00:37:51,525
Use the binoculars."

435
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:53,610
Here.

436
00:37:53,653 --> 00:37:55,112
Thank you.

437
00:37:55,196 --> 00:37:56,363
No, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

438
00:37:56,447 --> 00:37:57,698
Who? I don't...
I don't know.

439
00:37:57,782 --> 00:37:58,824
Where did you get
the note from?

440
00:37:58,908 --> 00:38:01,034
Some guy gave me 20 bucks,
I don't know.

441
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,119
Let go.

442
00:38:02,203 --> 00:38:04,997
Let her go.

443
00:38:05,081 --> 00:38:07,457
Beat it.

444
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:11,086
Go do your job,
sweetheart, thank you.

445
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:16,633
This goofy guy
is getting interesting.

446
00:38:35,153 --> 00:38:36,361
What do you see?

447
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:47,039
Do you wanna
see my wings?

448
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:49,499
No.

449
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:51,668
Just ask.

450
00:38:51,753 --> 00:38:54,379
You want to see them,
just ask me.

451
00:38:59,552 --> 00:39:02,679
Okay. I wanna
see your wings.

452
00:39:14,901 --> 00:39:17,235
Oh, my.

453
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,196
What?

454
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:23,617
Put your coat on,
we're leaving.

455
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:25,077
Go down there.

456
00:39:25,161 --> 00:39:27,746
They're parked
in lover's lane.

457
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,040
Kill him and bring
her back here.

458
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:31,333
Okay.

459
00:39:37,924 --> 00:39:39,549
Oh, no,
don't go yet.

460
00:39:49,435 --> 00:39:51,395
And now it is
an angel's song

461
00:39:51,437 --> 00:39:55,774
that makes
the heavens be mute.

462
00:39:58,111 --> 00:39:58,735
Hey, I'll tell
you what.

463
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,988
Why don't you put on
your prettiest dress.

464
00:40:02,073 --> 00:40:03,240
Why?

465
00:40:03,324 --> 00:40:06,993
I wanna take
you out.

466
00:40:07,078 --> 00:40:08,412
To where?

467
00:40:08,496 --> 00:40:10,247
Trust me.

468
00:40:26,097 --> 00:40:27,597
Sit down,
look straight ahead.

469
00:40:27,682 --> 00:40:28,765
I have a little
surprise for you.

470
00:40:28,808 --> 00:40:30,851
Okay.

471
00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:41,069
I'll be right back.
You just wait right here.

472
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,872
Keep your
eyes closed.

473
00:40:51,956 --> 00:40:53,373
Okay.

474
00:40:56,627 --> 00:40:58,170
What, what
are you doing?

475
00:40:58,254 --> 00:40:59,421
I'm right here.

476
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:20,400
Okay, now?

477
00:41:20,485 --> 00:41:22,777
Okay. Now.

478
00:41:38,669 --> 00:41:39,878
Your first ocean.

479
00:41:44,175 --> 00:41:45,592
It's beautiful.

480
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:56,853
You know,
you're really good at this.

481
00:41:56,938 --> 00:42:01,983
Mm. You ever
been married?

482
00:42:05,196 --> 00:42:09,741
Long time ago.

483
00:42:09,825 --> 00:42:11,535
What happened?

484
00:42:17,792 --> 00:42:21,253
Did you love her?

485
00:42:21,337 --> 00:42:23,255
I loved her to death.

486
00:42:28,886 --> 00:42:33,390
Hey, I'm sorry, listen...

487
00:42:33,474 --> 00:42:35,725
listen, little lady...

488
00:42:35,768 --> 00:42:40,063
what can I do for you?

489
00:42:40,106 --> 00:42:41,606
Play.

490
00:42:42,858 --> 00:42:43,900
You can play for me.

491
00:42:43,985 --> 00:42:45,902
No. Come on.

492
00:42:45,987 --> 00:42:48,071
You brought your trumpet.

493
00:42:48,155 --> 00:42:50,115
Well that's just to keep
the bottle in.

494
00:42:54,537 --> 00:42:59,332
Oh, come on now, don't take
advantage of me.

495
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:02,127
All right. I'll play
you one song.

496
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:03,211
Okay.

497
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:15,640
This here...

498
00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:17,517
this here is Hazel.

499
00:43:17,602 --> 00:43:18,852
Mm.

500
00:44:38,724 --> 00:44:41,726
This is silly.

501
00:44:46,023 --> 00:44:48,358
Huh?

502
00:44:50,986 --> 00:44:53,238
It's perfect,
isn't it?

503
00:44:53,322 --> 00:44:58,702
It's like
a movie.

504
00:44:58,786 --> 00:45:00,620
This night
like this.

505
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:11,589
I don't care if the ocean's not real.

506
00:45:11,674 --> 00:45:13,091
If you are.

507
00:45:13,175 --> 00:45:14,884
I don't care.

508
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:16,636
Huh.

509
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:21,474
Hey, Lily.

510
00:45:26,355 --> 00:45:29,441
Would you
dance with me?

511
00:45:29,525 --> 00:45:31,401
I'd love to.

512
00:46:00,097 --> 00:46:01,473
Kiss me.

513
00:46:08,939 --> 00:46:11,608
Come on, Nate,
I mean a real kiss.

514
00:48:48,098 --> 00:48:51,100
Her name was,
uh, Annie.

515
00:48:55,105 --> 00:48:56,773
Annie Poole.

516
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:05,782
She was really special.

517
00:49:05,866 --> 00:49:07,408
She didn't drink,
she didn't...

518
00:49:07,493 --> 00:49:13,706
she didn't get high.

519
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:16,459
She'd get high so she could be with me.

520
00:49:21,715 --> 00:49:25,385
I didn't do anything.

521
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:29,055
I didn't do anything,
I just...

522
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:31,975
I just watched her...

523
00:49:32,017 --> 00:49:33,977
I just watched
her fade away.

524
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:57,834
So how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?

525
00:50:04,383 --> 00:50:05,675
Nate!
Nate!

526
00:50:05,759 --> 00:50:08,261
Lily, Lily, stay...
Lily, stay there.

527
00:50:08,345 --> 00:50:12,056
Nate, calm
the lady down.

528
00:50:12,141 --> 00:50:14,934
Introduce us.

529
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:19,522
Fuck you.

530
00:50:19,606 --> 00:50:22,442
Happy Shannon.

531
00:50:22,526 --> 00:50:25,862
It's a pleasure.

532
00:50:25,904 --> 00:50:28,531
You didn't tell
the lady?

533
00:50:28,574 --> 00:50:30,867
Ah, it was probably
an oversight...

534
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:36,205
Our Nate and
his surprises.

535
00:50:36,248 --> 00:50:36,539
Yes.

536
00:50:36,623 --> 00:50:41,753
You see, yesterday,
over lunch

537
00:50:41,837 --> 00:50:45,381
Nate proposed that we
manage you, he and I.

538
00:50:45,466 --> 00:50:47,717
Your career.

539
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,260
At first I
didn't believe him.

540
00:50:49,344 --> 00:50:50,803
A woman with wings...

541
00:50:50,888 --> 00:50:53,097
I'm sure
you understand.

542
00:50:53,182 --> 00:50:58,144
But after Nate set up the
viewing at the opera yesterday...

543
00:50:58,228 --> 00:51:01,731
Hey, I got
eyes, right?

544
00:51:01,815 --> 00:51:04,650
Listen, listen,
it was my only chance.

545
00:51:04,735 --> 00:51:08,071
I thought I could... figure
it all out and protect you...

546
00:51:08,155 --> 00:51:10,656
Nate traded his
life for yours.

547
00:51:10,741 --> 00:51:12,325
It's as simple
as that.

548
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:13,701
Not true.

549
00:51:13,786 --> 00:51:15,078
Well, I'm glad
I could help.

550
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,330
No, Lily.
Lily, Lily, Lily.

551
00:51:22,836 --> 00:51:25,671
Hey, let her put some fucking clothes on,
you fucking animal.

552
00:51:28,092 --> 00:51:30,927
Do I have to stand in a lit booth?

553
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:39,185
You will have
an audience

554
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:41,270
of one.

555
00:51:41,313 --> 00:51:44,315
Me.

556
00:51:44,399 --> 00:51:47,527
Now that I've
actually seen you

557
00:51:47,611 --> 00:51:50,696
you're a miracle

558
00:51:50,781 --> 00:51:52,990
too rare and precious.

559
00:51:53,075 --> 00:51:58,704
You need to be, like
Nate said, protected.

560
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:00,706
You should
live with me.

561
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:03,209
I will see to
your every need.

562
00:52:03,293 --> 00:52:07,296
Please, Lily, please,
just don't go.

563
00:52:07,339 --> 00:52:10,383
I want you to come to this eyes open

564
00:52:10,467 --> 00:52:12,969
willingly, I don't
want a prisoner.

565
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:13,970
That's a goddamn lie.

566
00:52:14,054 --> 00:52:15,221
It doesn't matter to me.

567
00:52:15,305 --> 00:52:17,098
Lily, please, you don't
have to do this.

568
00:52:17,182 --> 00:52:19,892
You don't have to do anything you don't want to.

569
00:52:19,977 --> 00:52:21,978
I don't want
him touched.

570
00:52:22,062 --> 00:52:24,814
I don't want him touched,
that was part of his deal, right?

571
00:52:24,857 --> 00:52:27,984
Truthfully, that could
be a problem.

572
00:52:28,026 --> 00:52:29,735
We don't want him loose in the world.

573
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,320
He's a talker.

574
00:52:31,405 --> 00:52:33,197
It was part of his deal, right?

575
00:52:33,282 --> 00:52:36,325
Yes, sweetheart,
but think about...

576
00:52:36,368 --> 00:52:43,207
He isn't going
to say anything.

577
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:46,002
You and me
and women.

578
00:52:59,683 --> 00:53:01,601
Get up!

579
00:53:01,685 --> 00:53:02,602
Why?

580
00:53:02,686 --> 00:53:03,394
- Why?
- Why?

581
00:53:03,478 --> 00:53:06,439
'Cause I fucking said so!
Get up!

582
00:53:06,523 --> 00:53:08,149
Get the fuck up!

583
00:53:32,966 --> 00:53:34,050
Dream Lounge.

584
00:53:36,553 --> 00:53:38,471
What?

585
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,612
It's Campbell's.
Drink it. Come on.

586
00:53:59,243 --> 00:54:06,290
Oh, God.
Jesus.

587
00:54:11,588 --> 00:54:14,131
I'm gonna get
her back, Harriet.

588
00:54:14,216 --> 00:54:17,927
I will. I'm
gonna get her back.

589
00:54:20,305 --> 00:54:22,098
Sure you will.

590
00:54:38,657 --> 00:54:40,449
It's not exactly my problem.

591
00:54:40,534 --> 00:54:42,535
I roll up here in the middle of the goddamn night

592
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:47,707
to deliver 20 cases
of champagne.

593
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:51,127
Oh, God, um...

594
00:54:51,169 --> 00:54:53,212
I... I'm sorry,
you're right

595
00:54:53,297 --> 00:54:57,008
I'm such a fuzz brain,
I just... um, it's next week.

596
00:54:57,092 --> 00:54:59,176
Could l...
could I just pull up and turn around?

597
00:54:59,261 --> 00:55:02,471
Right.

598
00:55:02,556 --> 00:55:03,889
I'm sorry.

599
00:55:07,394 --> 00:55:08,978
Thanks.

600
00:57:09,558 --> 00:57:10,683
I love you.

601
00:57:10,767 --> 00:57:13,144
Care to join us?

602
00:57:13,228 --> 00:57:17,648
You get dressed,
and get the fuck outta here.

603
00:57:25,574 --> 00:57:29,201
Hey, man,
she's coming with me.

604
00:57:29,286 --> 00:57:31,370
Okay. I mean, sure.

605
00:57:31,455 --> 00:57:35,833
Angel, do you want Roland to pack your things or...

606
00:57:40,172 --> 00:57:43,466
I'm staying here.

607
00:57:43,508 --> 00:57:49,722
I want you to go.
Just go.

608
00:57:49,806 --> 00:57:55,394
Hey. Hey, we're meant
to be together.

609
00:57:55,479 --> 00:57:58,731
Oh, dear.

610
00:57:58,815 --> 00:58:02,193
Now you're talking
in song titles.

611
00:58:02,277 --> 00:58:05,070
Nate,
you're a man of the world.

612
00:58:05,155 --> 00:58:07,406
Not my world.

613
00:58:07,491 --> 00:58:12,036
But you look as if...
you've lived a life.

614
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,581
So you understand
that everything changes.

615
00:58:15,665 --> 00:58:19,919
Everything ends.

616
00:58:20,003 --> 00:58:21,921
Not this.

617
00:58:22,005 --> 00:58:25,674
Don't help me.

618
00:58:25,759 --> 00:58:27,051
Don't do anything.

619
00:58:32,682 --> 00:58:34,767
I don't want to be
with you, Nate.

620
00:58:34,851 --> 00:58:37,770
Please don't do this.

621
00:58:37,854 --> 00:58:39,813
I want you
to leave.

622
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:01,877
Stay for the movie,
I don't care.

623
00:59:42,919 --> 00:59:45,296
As long as
I'm with you

624
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,256
nothing happens to him.

625
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,508
And that's our deal.

626
00:59:49,593 --> 00:59:51,093
I promise.

627
00:59:51,177 --> 00:59:53,512
You break it,
I'm gone.

628
01:01:27,857 --> 01:01:30,192
You can't bus tables.

629
01:01:30,235 --> 01:01:32,444
You can't clean toilets.

630
01:01:32,529 --> 01:01:35,030
You can't even
buy a drink in here.

631
01:01:35,115 --> 01:01:38,701
Not here,
nor anywheres else.

632
01:04:20,905 --> 01:04:23,657
My man. Hey.

633
01:04:23,741 --> 01:04:26,034
Mad Malcolm.
Goddamn.

634
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:27,578
I'm liking the look.

635
01:04:27,662 --> 01:04:32,040
Well, you know.
Well, you know me.

636
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:34,376
Footloose. Ow.

637
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:38,797
And fancy free. Like
seeing a ghost, son.

638
01:04:38,882 --> 01:04:42,384
Word on the
street is, uh

639
01:04:42,468 --> 01:04:46,054
Happy ain't too happy
with you these days.

640
01:04:46,097 --> 01:04:48,640
Yeah, well, uh...
I'm still breathing.

641
01:04:48,725 --> 01:04:52,561
Amen to that, brother.

642
01:04:52,645 --> 01:04:54,229
I bet you could use
a gig, though.

643
01:04:54,272 --> 01:04:58,567
Oh, man, I could use
a lot of things.

644
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:01,904
I'm playing with some fellas at this thing.

645
01:05:01,946 --> 01:05:05,240
It's a party, you dig?

646
01:05:05,325 --> 01:05:07,242
Over at the museum.

647
01:05:07,285 --> 01:05:11,163
You show up...
play a couple of tunes

648
01:05:11,247 --> 01:05:13,498
they pay you like
a rock star.

649
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:16,960
Oh, museum? Come on, man,
that ain't my thing.

650
01:05:17,045 --> 01:05:22,966
Yeah?
A hundred dollars a night sound like your thing?

651
01:05:23,051 --> 01:05:27,429
Hey. Get some socks,
don't get your feet cold.

652
01:05:27,513 --> 01:05:29,264
All right, baby,
let me know.

653
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:30,766
Yeah, about...

654
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:32,392
Hm.
I'm gonna be a little short to the gig...

655
01:05:32,477 --> 01:05:37,773
Think you could, uh,
let me hold twenty?

656
01:05:37,857 --> 01:05:40,776
That is,
you owe the pawn shop twenty, right?

657
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:45,030
Yeah.

658
01:05:45,114 --> 01:05:48,325
That's a pretty fat
roll you got there.

659
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:51,453
You think maybe, uh

660
01:05:51,537 --> 01:05:53,789
you know, give a little
to the hat?

661
01:05:53,831 --> 01:05:57,000
Huh?

662
01:05:57,085 --> 01:06:00,462
Now don't let me see
you on the street.

663
01:06:00,546 --> 01:06:02,422
You've always been
there for me.

664
01:06:05,551 --> 01:06:07,302
Skate!

665
01:06:23,403 --> 01:06:26,488
Beautiful.

666
01:06:26,531 --> 01:06:27,572
Thank you.

667
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,703
Mind if I stay?

668
01:06:32,787 --> 01:06:36,707
You can do whatever you want.

669
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:39,001
I'll stay.

670
01:06:39,085 --> 01:06:40,502
Okay.

671
01:06:52,849 --> 01:06:57,853
My real name
isn't Happy.

672
01:06:57,937 --> 01:07:00,230
Michael.

673
01:07:00,314 --> 01:07:03,191
My real name is Michael.

674
01:07:03,234 --> 01:07:09,072
Mike.

675
01:07:09,157 --> 01:07:15,370
When I was a kid,
apparently I walked around with a big frown

676
01:07:15,455 --> 01:07:18,874
I was a very pissed-off little guy.

677
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:22,461
Not that there was
much to smile about.

678
01:07:22,545 --> 01:07:25,464
My dad named me Happy.

679
01:07:25,548 --> 01:07:28,759
That was his joke.

680
01:07:28,843 --> 01:07:32,220
I hated it.

681
01:07:32,263 --> 01:07:33,555
I hated him.

682
01:07:38,895 --> 01:07:42,647
But it stuck.

683
01:07:42,732 --> 01:07:47,903
You know, you can't keep
a good nickname down.

684
01:07:47,987 --> 01:07:52,407
I always hated it.

685
01:07:52,492 --> 01:07:55,410
Until now.

686
01:07:55,453 --> 01:07:57,788
Why is that?

687
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:12,010
Because it fits finally.

688
01:08:12,095 --> 01:08:13,762
I am happy.

689
01:08:18,684 --> 01:08:21,186
Happy, no.

690
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:24,189
Diamonds, the
angel's stone.

691
01:08:24,273 --> 01:08:27,818
Well, if it's not,
it should be.

692
01:08:27,902 --> 01:08:29,778
I can't take this.

693
01:08:32,448 --> 01:08:33,615
Keep it.

694
01:08:36,244 --> 01:08:38,703
Some day you're
gonna be happy.

695
01:09:22,081 --> 01:09:23,999
Happy, where
are we?

696
01:09:26,669 --> 01:09:28,086
Heaven.

697
01:09:53,154 --> 01:09:55,071
Happy Shannon!

698
01:09:55,156 --> 01:09:58,074
Man of the hour.

699
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:58,950
Thank you, Anne.

700
01:09:59,035 --> 01:10:01,286
Nice of you to say,
but I really think it's the city's hour

701
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:01,912
don't you?

702
01:10:01,996 --> 01:10:06,625
But it was your generosity that
made this heavenly show possible.

703
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:09,544
Well, it's for
the young people

704
01:10:09,629 --> 01:10:13,381
and, uh, I had
inspiration.

705
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,178
Is this a new
Happy Shannon?

706
01:10:25,478 --> 01:10:26,978
Angels, heaven?

707
01:10:27,063 --> 01:10:29,147
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is, um...

708
01:10:36,822 --> 01:10:38,823
Is there ever
been a moment

709
01:10:38,908 --> 01:10:44,329
where you felt that you weren't getting a... a...

710
01:10:56,717 --> 01:11:00,470
Let me ask you about your two federal indictments.

711
01:11:00,554 --> 01:11:04,224
Conspiracy, tampering
with evidence.

712
01:13:52,685 --> 01:13:53,977
No, no.

713
01:13:54,061 --> 01:13:55,270
Come on Sweetie.

714
01:13:55,312 --> 01:13:56,688
Let's warm you up.

715
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:07,449
Now, wait,
baby, no, no.

716
01:14:07,533 --> 01:14:09,617
Shh.
Shh.

717
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:12,162
Shh.

718
01:14:51,327 --> 01:14:53,161
Yeah.

719
01:15:09,345 --> 01:15:13,515
Last thing on earth
you'll ever see.

720
01:15:13,557 --> 01:15:14,682
Wings.

721
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,195
I'll send Lily
your regards.

722
01:15:27,238 --> 01:15:31,866
Good to see you, Nate.

723
01:15:31,951 --> 01:15:35,703
I'll send Lily
your regards.

724
01:15:35,788 --> 01:15:38,706
I'll send Lily
your regards.

725
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:41,292
My Lily.

726
01:15:41,377 --> 01:15:44,295
The last thing on earth
you'll ever see...

727
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:49,133
Wake up, Nate!
Wake up, Nate!

728
01:15:49,218 --> 01:15:50,718
Get up!

729
01:15:50,803 --> 01:15:53,888
Wake up!

730
01:15:53,973 --> 01:15:55,974
Wake up, Nate!

731
01:15:56,058 --> 01:15:59,936
Get up, goddamn it!

732
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:00,937
Get up!

733
01:16:03,148 --> 01:16:06,359
Good. Cold,
isn't it?

734
01:16:13,450 --> 01:16:15,493
Stupid motherfucker.

735
01:16:20,374 --> 01:16:21,583
Lily.

736
01:16:26,255 --> 01:16:27,422
Nate.

737
01:16:27,506 --> 01:16:30,925
Nate!

738
01:16:30,968 --> 01:16:31,342
Close.

739
01:16:31,427 --> 01:16:33,011
Come on, get
your things

740
01:16:33,095 --> 01:16:34,262
we're going home.

741
01:16:34,305 --> 01:16:35,179
Don't touch me.

742
01:16:35,264 --> 01:16:36,764
We're what?

743
01:16:36,849 --> 01:16:39,767
I found her.

744
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:41,311
I raised her.

745
01:16:43,272 --> 01:16:44,689
Happy!

746
01:16:49,069 --> 01:16:49,861
"We're leaving."

747
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:55,199
I think that's what he
was trying to say.

748
01:16:55,284 --> 01:16:57,118
He's right.
Come on, come on.

749
01:16:57,202 --> 01:16:58,161
Why?

750
01:16:58,245 --> 01:17:00,288
Why? Because...

751
01:17:01,624 --> 01:17:03,916
You're not happy
anymore.

752
01:17:23,354 --> 01:17:24,646
It's open.

753
01:17:29,818 --> 01:17:31,569
It's a fucking
hurricane out there.

754
01:17:31,654 --> 01:17:37,200
Yeah.
Whatever.

755
01:17:37,284 --> 01:17:38,701
Yeah.

756
01:17:39,953 --> 01:17:41,579
You look
like shit.

757
01:17:41,664 --> 01:17:42,747
Got a smoke?

758
01:17:47,503 --> 01:17:51,047
You remember my cousin
Marvin, the cop?

759
01:17:51,131 --> 01:17:51,923
Yeah.

760
01:17:52,007 --> 01:17:54,175
The one who works down
in Newport Division.

761
01:17:54,259 --> 01:17:56,177
Told me that there's gonna
be a raid in a couple hours.

762
01:17:56,261 --> 01:18:02,850
Around five.
Busting a black and tan joint down on Adams.

763
01:18:02,893 --> 01:18:04,686
So?

764
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:06,938
Well, I'll tell
you so

765
01:18:07,022 --> 01:18:11,943
a lot of stars, hookers, dope,
you know, whatever

766
01:18:12,027 --> 01:18:15,446
Marvin says that there's
a private club upstairs.

767
01:18:15,531 --> 01:18:17,198
Guess whose
club it is.

768
01:18:17,282 --> 01:18:19,033
Come on, Ricky.

769
01:18:19,076 --> 01:18:20,868
Happy's club.

770
01:18:20,953 --> 01:18:22,787
Oh.

771
01:18:22,871 --> 01:18:24,038
You know what
they do in there?

772
01:18:24,081 --> 01:18:25,081
Dope?

773
01:18:25,165 --> 01:18:25,540
Nope.

774
01:18:25,624 --> 01:18:25,957
Cards?

775
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:26,708
Nope.

776
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:30,002
Pussy. What the fuck,
I don't know.

777
01:18:30,087 --> 01:18:32,463
They watch some freak
in a glass box.

778
01:18:32,548 --> 01:18:34,882
Can you believe
that shit?

779
01:18:34,967 --> 01:18:38,219
These stiffs are paying Happy a fortune,

780
01:18:38,303 --> 01:18:41,597
to watch some
naked humpback bitch.

781
01:18:41,682 --> 01:18:43,641
I'm not kidding you.

782
01:18:43,726 --> 01:18:46,185
I mean, fuck!
I'm in the wrong line of work.

783
01:19:09,918 --> 01:19:11,335
Caught you, you bad boy.

784
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,420
What are you
doing here?

785
01:19:12,504 --> 01:19:16,424
Oh, I'm a party gal looking
for a good time.

786
01:19:16,467 --> 01:19:18,426
Ricky filled
me in.

787
01:19:18,469 --> 01:19:20,094
Mm-hm.

788
01:19:20,179 --> 01:19:22,764
Nate, why are you
doing this?

789
01:19:35,527 --> 01:19:37,987
I have got to meet
this girl.

790
01:19:40,783 --> 01:19:42,366
Don't you all worry about this bubbly shit,

791
01:19:42,451 --> 01:19:44,035
I got the good
stuff right here.

792
01:19:44,119 --> 01:19:45,203
Oh, hello.

793
01:19:45,287 --> 01:19:46,329
Have a drink, sweetheart.

794
01:19:46,413 --> 01:19:47,330
Here we go!

795
01:19:47,414 --> 01:19:49,791
We're gonna go inside and
have a good night tonight, huh?

796
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:52,460
Oh, yeah, yeah. Here
you go, brother.

797
01:19:55,756 --> 01:19:57,507
- Hey, Dan.
- Thank you, Dan.

798
01:19:57,591 --> 01:19:59,425
Please come in.
Please come in.

799
01:20:04,056 --> 01:20:05,807
Check your coat?

800
01:20:05,849 --> 01:20:07,225
Uh...

801
01:20:07,309 --> 01:20:09,644
Thank you.

802
01:22:30,285 --> 01:22:35,039
Beautiful, isn't she?

803
01:23:17,332 --> 01:23:21,168
Nate, what are
we gonna do?

804
01:23:21,253 --> 01:23:22,753
You're gonna fly.

805
01:23:22,838 --> 01:23:23,629
What?

806
01:23:23,714 --> 01:23:24,755
You can do it.

807
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:28,217
I can't fly, Nate.
Nate, I can't fly!

808
01:23:28,301 --> 01:23:31,345
The wind is blowing just right,
you can fly.

809
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:32,763
You can do this,
come on.

810
01:24:02,919 --> 01:24:04,879
Nate, it's not gonna work,
it's not gonna work.

811
01:24:09,634 --> 01:24:11,218
Oh, baby.

812
01:24:11,303 --> 01:24:12,470
What?

813
01:24:12,554 --> 01:24:14,138
I love you.

814
01:24:14,222 --> 01:24:16,932
Get over here.
You'll fall like a brick.

815
01:24:20,103 --> 01:24:21,729
I love you.

816
01:24:31,531 --> 01:24:32,406
Nate!

817
01:24:32,491 --> 01:24:33,783
No!
