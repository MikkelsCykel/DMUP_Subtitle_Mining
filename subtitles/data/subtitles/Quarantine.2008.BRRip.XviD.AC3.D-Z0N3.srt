1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,560
Come on, life sounds. Let's go.
-Okay.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,920
Mike down, mike down.
There you go, now go.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,880
You'd think I'd never done this.
Ready?

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,360
Hey, wait a second. Ready.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,320
Five, four, three...

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,160
Hi, I'm Angela Vidal.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,360
Come with us tonight
as we travel along with...

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,400
Sorry.
-Okay.

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,080
Ready?
-Yeah, wait a second.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,960
You got a little hair thing.
Hold on.

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,040
Let me get that.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,800
That right there.

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,640
Okay, there we go.
-Thank you.

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,240
Okay.

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,320
Hold on.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,040
Okay. Ready.

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,480
Hi, I'm Angela Vidal.

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,600
Come with us tonight as we paint
the town red on The Night Shift.

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,880
Sorry, a little off my A-game.
I'll get there.

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,240
That wasn't bad. The second part
just seemed a little pushed, though.

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,280
On tonight's Night Shift,
we're in Los Angeles...

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,120
...traveling along with that special
breed of hero we like to call...

23
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,360
...the fire department.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,880
We should have come earlier.
We could be going with them.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,040
Well, that's cool. You got it?

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,560
Yeah, that's great. That was perfect.
-We'll wait for them to get back.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,640
You prefer Bob or Robert...?
-Bob's good.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,600
Bob, okay, sorry. Ready? Okay.
-Yeah.

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,080
Three, two, one.

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,360
Tell us, Bob, what's a normal night
here at the station?

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,200
This might surprise most people...

32
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,960
...but 85 percent of the calls
we go out on are medical.

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,960
It can be anything from chest pain
to more serious things.

34
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,800
How do you handle that
with ambulances and hospitals?

35
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,280
Most ambulances you see
are fire department.

36
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,200
I didn't know that.
-Yeah.

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,840
And most firefighters
are also paramedics.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,360
At least,
that's the direction it's going.

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,320
One more question, something
I'm sure we're all wondering:

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,040
Do firefighters still slide down
those fabulous poles?

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,880
We sure do.

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
No turning back.

43
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,880
Tell my mom I loved her.

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,040
See?
-That's not so bad.

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,200
I'm glad I didn't wear a skirt.
That could really hurt your legs.

46
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720
Tell me, Bob, how do you get down
when you're wearing a skirt?

47
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,880
Pantyhose help.

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,480
Pantyhose.

49
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,200
That's what they wear under their,
what, their turnouts.

50
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,400
Exactly.
-Pantyhose.

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,880
Fire-retardant pantyhose.
-You heard it here.

52
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,600
Can I do it one more time?
-Sure.

53
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,280
I'll be right back, okay?

54
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,520
We're going to the dining hall.
-All right.

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,720
Couple of guys I want you to meet.
-Cool.

56
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,480
Hey.

57
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,000
This is Jake.
-Hey.

58
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,200
And Fletcher.
-Hi.

59
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,400
Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

60
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,520
These are the men you'll be
shadowing. Wherever they go, you go.

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,560
Cool. Please, oh, please,
finish eating. We'll talk after.

62
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,280
Well, would you like some?
-Yeah.

63
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,720
Did you make it?
-We got...

64
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,240
I didn't make it.

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,800
Firemen are really good cooks.

66
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
Yeah, that's what I hear.
-Exactly.

67
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,040
You should try some of the food.
-Yeah, I'm game.

68
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,520
Please finish eating.
-We'll get you a plate.

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,720
Great. Sounds great.

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,840
Just maybe un-tuck your shirt
and stick it up here.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,320
Okay. Okay.
-Clip it on your collar.

72
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,320
You filming this?
-Yeah.

73
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,160
Elliot's been telling me
I never give him enough B-roll...

74
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,040
...so I'm just gonna shoot it all.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
Jake? Jake?
-Yeah, yeah.

76
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,240
If you could keep from rubbing
into the mike too much...

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Sorry, yeah.
-Don't worry about the camera.

78
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,160
Pretend it's not even there.
-Okay.

79
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,360
Can you say something?
Give me a level?

80
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,320
Yeah. Mike check, one...

81
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,880
You can just pretend it's not there.
Just talk free.

82
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,360
Can you say something
more compelling?

83
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,040
I don't know what to say...

84
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,680
I mean, am I gonna have
this thing on all the time?

85
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,800
Yeah, just watch what you say.
We'll hear everything.

86
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,360
Shit.

87
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,200
You're probably not allowed
to swear on your station.

88
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,080
No. We can cut most of it out.

89
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,240
But it helps
if you're not dropping F-bombs.

90
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,960
Point noted. Filed right here.

91
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,960
So if I was to call this guy
an ass-monkey...

92
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,040
...that would be considered
a swear too, right?

93
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,120
It's gonna be a long night.

94
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,360
So this thing?
-Yeah?

95
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,040
Is this some sort of torture device
when you don't get in your turnouts?

96
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,880
That's what it is.
-Can you get it?

97
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,640
Yes. This is called a hook ladder.

98
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,160
We use this in the...
The firemen would use this...

99
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,840
We should bring it down?
-Yes.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,040
Okay.
-All right.

101
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,240
Can you grab the hook?

102
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,320
So this was used
in the '20s and the '30s.

103
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,480
Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

104
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,200
And as you can see...

105
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,080
...these are the rungs,
and the hook at the end...

106
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,840
...they would grasp onto one window
and then pull themselves up.

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,680
And then when they got to that
windowsill, they would hook it again.

108
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,480
And then pull themselves up.
-Okay.

109
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,560
Did you get the hook, Scott?
You see this?

110
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,320
Used in the '20s and '30s.
They stopped using it around...

111
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,360
Hold it up higher.
-Replaced it...

112
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,720
That's good, right?
-Good.

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,040
Replaced it
with a regular ladder that extends?

114
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,640
Yeah, and rope.

115
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,080
They must have tiny feet.
Those are little rungs.

116
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,480
Yeah. Firemen
were a lot smaller back then.

117
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,400
The fires were bigger
and they were smaller.

118
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,040
Don't tell captain we took this down.
-I'm not gonna tell him I touched it.

119
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,160
I wanna introduce you to somebody.
This is Wilshire. Mark.

120
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,480
Good boy.
-Hey, Wilshire.

121
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,440
Say hi.
-Dog right out of the cartoons.

122
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,440
Well, there's a reason
why the Dalmatians were in cartoons.

123
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,960
The fire department
has a great sense of tradition.

124
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,160
Yeah, we do.

125
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,040
Dalmatians
got along well with horses.

126
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,520
Important when the fire trucks
were horse-drawn.

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,040
Now they're used as mascots.

128
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,240
But what they're trained to do
is run in and stop the traffic.

129
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,240
Kind of like Fletch.
-Yeah.

130
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,760
That's what I do, I run out there.
Sort of like what a siren does today.

131
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,680
Okay, well, Wilshire can show you
what to do in case you catch on fire.

132
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,320
Stop, drop and roll.
-Yeah.

133
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,880
So let's just pretend
you're 5 years old and on fire.

134
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,040
I'm on fire.
-Wilshire's gonna teach you.

135
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,720
Tell me what to do.

136
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,800
Okay. Wilshire.

137
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,440
Wilshire, mark. Stay.

138
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,840
Wilshire, drop.

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,960
Drop. Drop.

140
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,040
Wilshire, roll.

141
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,240
Wilshire, roll.

142
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,680
Good.
-Look at that.

143
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
Good boy. Good boy.

144
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,480
I'm gonna live.
-Report.

145
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,360
You're not gonna be on fire.

146
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,120
So it's stop, drop and roll,
in case you catch on fire. Wilshire.

147
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,360
Yeah, you know, have some fun.
-You all hang out a lot?

148
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,080
Yeah.
-You kind of live together.

149
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,520
Yeah, we definitely live together.
Close quarters.

150
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,880
Okay, good.
-Oh, ready?

151
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,600
So yeah, we have 48-hour shifts...

152
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,000
...so we have everything
we need in this place...

153
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,120
...from, you know, a small
gym to this handball court.

154
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,080
I'll show it to you.

155
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,440
It's nice, right?
-Yeah.

156
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,840
Sir, you got a call
on the office line.

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,960
Can you pick up a call
on the office line?

158
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,280
Non-responder.

159
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,520
Oh, shoot.
-Yeah.

160
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,360
I was hoping we'd get a call.
-Yeah.

161
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,920
Not a big one, a little call
so we can see action.

162
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,240
Exciting, I guess.
-Yeah.

163
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,560
Gotta be annoying
when trying to finish a game.

164
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,760
Not if you're losing.

165
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,200
Every time, you know,
we go respond to a call...

166
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,800
...the points reset.

167
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,400
Depending on which side you're on,
it's sort of nice.

168
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,360
Works in your favor
from time to time?

169
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,600
Not in my favor.
What are you talking about?

170
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,040
I never lose.

171
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,640
I think I'd roller-skate
if I had access to this.

172
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,960
I can see you doing that. Yeah.

173
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,040
Okay, so this is where the men
store their boots and turnouts.

174
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,040
The pole hole is over here.

175
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,400
The pole hole.
-Yeah, interesting name, I know.

176
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,280
You got the locker room here.
-Yep.

177
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,520
You got the dorms here.

178
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,600
Our viewers
always like to see action...

179
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,880
...so maybe we should go
into the locker room.

180
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,120
Let's go in the locker room.
-You got it.

181
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,760
Right this way.
-I was kidding, I was kidding.

182
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay, towel up, guys.
We got a female on deck.

183
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,760
Female on the deck.
-Oh, my God.

184
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,840
That's Griffin.
He can't sing very well.

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He's got one major talent,
so come this way.

186
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,480
He's got a huge talent.
-We're not using this.

187
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,160
Here. We have different hoses at
the station, and this is the Griffin hose.

188
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,520
Griffin hose.
-What the hell?

189
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,600
You know,
I hope that's a wide-angle lens.

190
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,400
Oh, my God.

191
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,600
Stay in there.

192
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,680
Hey, put that thing away.

193
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,720
This is adding a whole new meaning
to the term fireman's hose.

194
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,240
Hey, hit the floor.
-Oh, my...

195
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,280
I understand
why there are no women here.

196
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,680
Plenty of female firefighters.
-In this station?

197
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,040
No, not currently.

198
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,680
Okay, I think I can be a firefighter.

199
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Yeah, it's a lot harder than it seems.
-Keep the door closed.

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,080
You know what?
Pick something you're good at.

201
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,120
I bet you $10 I can do it better.
You all can be my witnesses.

202
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,880
That's too easy. Ten bucks?
-Yeah.

203
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,560
How about my place?

204
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,080
I think we're done here.
We got everything we need.

205
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,680
Here we go. Listen up.

206
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,720
Did you know
you were gonna be on camera?

207
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,600
Behind the line. Ready?
-Yeah.

208
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,440
Ten bucks.
-You can't be in the way.

209
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,080
I know.
-Get on that side.

210
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,920
I'm just saying. You guys ready?

211
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
You know what you're doing?
-Yes.

212
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,160
And go.

213
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,680
Get in there.
-That's not nice.

214
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,680
That's not fair. She pushed.

215
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,720
She pushed.
-Haven't got that much time.

216
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,560
Yes. You owe her 10 bucks, man.
-Ten dollars.

217
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Pay up. Oh, that's embarrassing.

218
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,600
Oh, this is embarrassing.
-That's really embarrassing.

219
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
Okay, rolling.

220
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,360
Just waiting
on something to happen.

221
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,440
You wanna go back outside?
See what they're up to?

222
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,080
Why not?

223
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,600
Careful.
-Thank you.

224
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,640
We're good.

225
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,680
You good?

226
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,880
I think they're talking about you.

227
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,480
Will you turn up his mike?

228
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,480
You didn't catch no eye.
Here, give me some of that.

229
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,160
I'll tell you, all right?

230
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,080
A hundred bucks
says I can bang her by the morning.

231
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,640
Oh, come on.
-I'll take that bet.

232
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,040
You're so busted.

233
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Nice mike.

234
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,960
Missed a spot.

235
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,960
Sorry, what?
-I said you missed a spot.

236
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,880
Oh, I know how to hit the spot.
Don't you worry about that.

237
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,280
I'll hold your camera.
You go kick his ass, okay?

238
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,200
That's how you do pick and roll.

239
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,840
Oh, yeah? Is that how you do it?

240
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,160
He'll show you how to do it later.

241
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,920
It's nighttime here...

242
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,120
...and the firefighters take turns
sleeping in these rooms here.

243
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,280
But if the alarm rings, they can be up
and on the truck in under one minute.

244
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Let's check out the room.

245
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,480
Can you get in here?

246
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,040
It's like my college dorm
without the pink.

247
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,800
Attention, 222 Truck 16.

248
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,920
Watch your back.
-Hey.

249
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,120
Looks like you got your call.

250
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,400
Just try to keep up.
-You okay?

251
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,200
We're going to the pole hole.
-Come on, come on.

252
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,440
Got it?
-What you wanna do?

253
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,160
I can't slide down there.

254
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,400
Come here, come here,
come this way.

255
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,560
Careful, okay?
We have to get on that truck.

256
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,520
There are like 15 stairs.
-I got it.

257
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,640
You be careful.
-Keep going, keep going.

258
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,600
It's this way?
-Yeah. Yeah, keep going.

259
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,400
Be careful.
-Make a quick right.

260
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,720
Make a quick right, baby.

261
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,360
Just jump in the back.

262
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,840
Jump in.
-Buckle up.

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,400
We're almost in.
-You guys in?

264
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
Yep, yep, yep.
-Yep?

265
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,240
Nice job.

266
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,240
What kind of call is this?

267
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,680
Probably just a medical.

268
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,880
Okay.
-We'll find out when we get there.

269
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
You seem to have kept shooting.

270
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,560
Ready?

271
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,240
Ready, set. Ready, set.

272
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Okay, good.

273
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,720
Most little girls wanna be ballerinas
or princesses when they grow up.

274
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,120
I used to tell my mom, "Someday,
I'm gonna grow up and be a fireman."

275
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,960
Tonight, I am truly living the dream.

276
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,560
It's so loud,
I don't think we can use any of it.

277
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,320
Scott, I am still living the dream.

278
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,920
Thirty-seventeen, go ahead.

279
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,360
All right,
we got a eight at 3 o'clock.

280
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,280
Keep calling out numbers.
What are you doing?

281
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,880
Well, Jake's the engineer.

282
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,360
He's actually
a third-generation engineer...

283
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,560
...but I have the most important job.

284
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,760
Navigating?

285
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,480
No,
I'm in charge of the chick-o-meter.

286
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,200
When I see a girl, I rate them.

287
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,240
So if I say
there's a eight at 3 o'clock...

288
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,080
...the guys know
they better look to the right.

289
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,040
You know, it's really funny. I always
thought firemen were so dignified.

290
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,680
Oh, no, no.
I signed up for brave and courageous.

291
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,800
I don't do dignified.
-Yeah, I think we get that by now.

292
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,040
I see a nine at 2.

293
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,400
Oh, we got a nine at 2.
-Yeah.

294
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,440
Whoa, that's a dude.

295
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,040
It's called a chick-o-meter,
not a dick-o-meter.

296
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,320
I think we're good.

297
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,120
You're fired. You can't talk anymore.

298
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,960
So where do you think
the problem is?

299
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,800
Do you think it's over there,
around the corner?

300
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,280
Or maybe around there?

301
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,800
You're rotten, you know that?

302
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,800
To the core, baby. To the core.

303
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,520
What are you taking with you?

304
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,240
Tools.

305
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,320
Really anything we might need
to break a lock or open a door.

306
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,680
You're the one who called this in?
-Yeah.

307
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,920
Come, follow me.

308
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,640
Look at Probie's new turnouts.

309
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,960
I didn't know
they made them that new.

310
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,800
We're almost to the building.

311
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,480
Police are here. Might be more
serious than we thought.

312
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,160
Probably not.

313
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,360
A woman was screaming
bloody murder up there.

314
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,720
It's Mrs. Espinoza.
-Two cops are up there.

315
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,840
When did they get here?
-Five minutes ago.

316
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,200
What's that sound?
-Sound of the building.

317
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,400
It's very old.

318
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,120
He insists on fixing everything.
-Wanda, please.

319
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,000
What apartment number?
-It's up here.

320
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,440
Go back to your apartments.
-We heard screams.

321
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,800
Well, at least get out of the way.

322
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,160
Are they with you?
-Yeah. They're shadowing us.

323
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,920
Then they're your responsibility.

324
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,280
I tell you not to film something,
don't film it.

325
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,880
I tell you to get lost, you get lost.
-No problem.

326
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,560
Here on the second floor on the right.
It's an old woman, lives alone.

327
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,400
Probably fell.
Neighbors heard screams, called it in.

328
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,840
What are those people doing?

329
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,560
You wouldn't believe
the way she screamed. It was crazy.

330
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,120
Neighbors say she's weird.
Doesn't talk to anybody.

331
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,400
She hasn't made a sound.

332
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,120
Who are they?
-They're with Fire.

333
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,160
I told them not to get in the way.
-Great. That's all we need.

334
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,200
Hello, ma'am, can you hear me?
It's L.A.P.D.

335
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,600
Ma'am, open up the door.

336
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,680
I'm here with paramedics.
We're gonna come in to help you.

337
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,920
If you're near the door,
I need you to move away from it.

338
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,560
Hey, I got the keys.
-Then get in here, sir. Come on.

339
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,880
2A.
-Help us out here.

340
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,200
Just a second. Yeah, here we are.

341
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,040
She must have added locks.

342
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,400
I'm gonna do an intro.
-Yeah, you're good.

343
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay. We're standing
outside an elderly woman's apartment.

344
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Neighbors heard screams
and called 911.

345
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,520
The fire department's
about to begin the rescue.

346
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,160
Police say that she lives alone,
she's not very social...

347
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,080
I need you to get back,
brother, please, this time.

348
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,280
Ma'am, we're the police.

349
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,800
We're here to help you.

350
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,200
Ma'am? Ma'am?

351
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
Ma'am, can you hear us?

352
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,880
What's her name?
-Mrs. Espinoza.

353
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,280
There's no need to worry, Mrs.
Espinoza. We're here to help you.

354
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,080
Okay, ma'am.

355
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,880
It's okay.
-It's all right.

356
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,280
Everything's gonna be fine.

357
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,960
Ma'am? We're right here, ma'am.

358
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,120
It's okay.
-Ma'am.

359
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,840
Jesus.
-Are you okay?

360
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,480
You okay? Come here.

361
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,080
Ma'am, it's... We're the police.

362
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,560
Ma'am.
-We're here to help you.

363
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,800
It's all right, is there anybody else
in the apartment? Any more animals?

364
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,240
It's gonna be okay, ma'am.
-All right.

365
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,320
It's okay, all right?

366
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,880
It's all right.

367
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,880
Ma'am, ma'am.

368
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,000
It's all right. It's all right.

369
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,200
All right. Okay, okay.

370
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,440
Okay, all right.

371
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,520
All right. Are you hurt?

372
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,560
All right, are you hurt?

373
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,400
No.
-Okay, okay.

374
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,400
We're gonna get you
some medical help.

375
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,000
No, no, no. Please, don't.

376
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,880
No, are you okay?
Are you okay, ma'am?

377
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,080
No, no, no.

378
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,320
Okay, okay, okay.

379
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,360
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay, all right?

380
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,760
Okay, just relax.
-Just relax.

381
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,640
Just calm down.
-Just calm down.

382
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,680
Turn that thing off.
-Turn that off.

383
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,920
Give us some room.

384
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,880
Come on, man.
-Gloves on, Danny.

385
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,480
Where's that blood coming from?

386
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,400
Hey, chief,
we're gonna need an ambulance here.

387
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,680
Copy. On our way.

388
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,680
Mrs. Espinoza,
it's all gonna be all right.

389
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,040
All right,
I just need you to calm down, okay?

390
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,960
It's all right.
Nobody's here to hurt you.

391
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
We can't help you
unless you calm down.

392
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,520
An ambulance is on its way right now.
-All right.

393
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,920
Let's just clear a space.

394
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,560
Danny, get everybody out of here
until the ambulance gets here.

395
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,840
Get her off. Get off. Get her off.

396
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,920
Get him on the floor.
Get him on the floor.

397
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,160
No. We are not moving him.

398
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,080
We are waiting for the ambulance.
-Do you see an ambulance?

399
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,640
We have to get him downstairs.

400
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,160
All right. Come on, come on. Okay.
-Grab the arm.

401
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,800
Come on. Come on, I got it.

402
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,040
Come on, lean down.

403
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,760
I got her. I got her.

404
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,320
Let's go.

405
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,360
Get the fuck out of the way.
-Go, Scott.

406
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,240
Move that camera.

407
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,800
Come on, let's go, let's go.

408
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,680
Did we get that?
-Move, move, move.

409
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,040
Let's go, open that door.
-Let's go.

410
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,720
Be careful down the stairs.
-Hang in there, buddy.

411
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,000
Tape everything, you hear me?
Tape everything.

412
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,320
Move. Move. Move.

413
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,080
Open the door.
-It's locked.

414
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,520
How can that be?

415
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,160
Open it, open it.
-Open.

416
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,240
What do you mean?
-They won't let us out.

417
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,200
Who locked those doors?
-It's not us.

418
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,960
Something is closing it from outside.

419
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,560
We need an ambulance.

420
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,880
Open the door. Open the door.

421
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,560
Is there a doctor in the house?

422
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,120
You're a doctor?
-I'm a vet.

423
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,480
Come on.
-Get over here.

424
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,160
Put some pressure on that wound.
-Give me that rag.

425
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,360
Get something.

426
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,400
Back up, back up.
-Cover him up.

427
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,400
Why are they locking
if there's a fire?

428
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,160
There's no fire, Wanda.
There is no fire.

429
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,560
We have an officer down.
We have an officer down.

430
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,880
I need an ambulance immediately.
I need backup.

431
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,840
Does anybody copy?

432
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,920
I have a fucking hurt officer here.

433
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,440
What's going on?
Hey, what's happening?

434
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,960
Why can't we leave?

435
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,800
I know no more
than you do right now.

436
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Back up.

437
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,720
My partner's on the floor bleeding.

438
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,080
Quiet.
-Please remain calm.

439
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,600
We are working hard
to get you out of the building.

440
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,680
Please follow
the officers' instructions.

441
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,280
This will all be over shortly.

442
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,600
What will all be over?
-What's going on?

443
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,360
Why are we locked in our building?

444
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,000
Be calm. That's what that means.

445
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Please remain calm and everything's...
Get the camera out of here.

446
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,720
Don't touch the camera.
We have every right to shoot.

447
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,800
I'm tired of the camera.
-People need to see what's going on.

448
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,520
I'm in charge here. Turn it off...

449
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,400
If you were, you'd be worried
about getting your partner out.

450
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,840
Not whether we're shooting.

451
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,960
You are two steps
from being arrested, okay?

452
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,560
This man will bleed to death.

453
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,360
Everybody stop fighting, okay?
Stop fighting.

454
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,920
We need to get this man out of here.

455
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,880
What's behind that door?
-That's a fabric workshop.

456
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,200
What is it?
-Fabric, fabric.

457
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,760
Is there a way out from there?
-Yeah, through the back. Come, come.

458
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,840
Keep them back.
-Please, please.

459
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,440
You're not helping the situation.
Okay?

460
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,520
My husband's outside.
Said there are cops.

461
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,040
Blocked off the street.
He was getting antibiotics.

462
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,120
We gotta do something...

463
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,640
What the fuck.

464
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,160
Jesus.
-Oh, Jesus.

465
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,280
Oh, Jesus, Fletch.
-Oh, my God.

466
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,880
Oh, Jesus.
-Okay, come on.

467
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,120
Don't move him.
-No, we have to, we have to.

468
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,560
Don't move him.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

469
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,200
All right, he's still got a pulse.

470
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,400
Shit.

471
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,640
Get the vet over here.
Get the vet now.

472
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,280
Vet, here, now.
-Get over here.

473
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,000
Come here.
-Keep an eye on him.

474
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,040
He's still got a pulse.
Take care of him.

475
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,280
Okay, back away.

476
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,760
All right. Come with me, let's go.

477
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,080
Come on, come on.
You two stay here, all right?

478
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,280
Stay here.

479
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,040
Keep an eye on my partner, please.

480
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,640
Come on.

481
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,680
Let's get upstairs.

482
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,560
Come on, let's get upstairs.

483
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,440
I'm coming.

484
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,880
The sound's coming from in there.

485
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,560
Okay.

486
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,480
Move over.

487
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,320
Oh, Scott, don't.

488
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,520
Don't go in there, Scott.

489
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,120
Scott.

490
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,480
Watch out.
-Oh, my God.

491
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,840
She's dead.

492
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,880
She's dead.

493
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,640
She's dead.
-What?

494
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,160
What are you two doing here?
Get the camera back.

495
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,360
We need to get you guys out of here.

496
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,040
Ma'am. Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am?

497
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,960
Ma'am, listen to me.
Can you hear me, Miss Espinoza?

498
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,560
I need you to stay
right where you are, okay?

499
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,400
All right?
We wanna help you here.

500
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,320
Put your hands in the air for me,
Mrs. Espinoza.

501
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,440
Okay? Put your hands in the air.

502
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,840
Oh, my God.

503
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,440
Let's go.

504
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,880
Put the gun down. Let's go.

505
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,200
She was coming right at us.
-Yeah.

506
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,360
You saw that, right?
-Yeah, I saw it.

507
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,080
Shit. Okay.

508
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,800
Okay, you saw that, right?

509
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,600
Okay. All right.

510
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,040
Let's just get downstairs.
Let's get downstairs.

511
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,800
Hey, hey, hey.

512
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,000
Easy, easy, easy.

513
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,600
Did you get that?

514
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,080
Yeah.

515
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,960
Show it to me.

516
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,520
Look, don't worry. I got it.
-I said show it to me!

517
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,520
Okay. Okay, okay.

518
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,040
Okay. Okay, okay.

519
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,640
What the hell was that?
-I don't know. I think...

520
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,680
Is everything okay?

521
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,400
We should probably
just get down the stairs, okay?

522
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,000
I know, I know, I know.

523
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,560
Oh, my God.
-We just have to get downstairs.

524
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,040
Fire department.

525
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,360
I need you to open up the door.

526
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,960
Fire department.

527
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,800
Fire department. We need everyone
to gather downstairs in the atrium.

528
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,600
Yes, we need you to go downstairs.

529
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,280
Was there a fire?
-No, it's just a precaution.

530
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,640
Just a precaution for what?

531
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,320
Look,
we just need you to get downstairs.

532
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,160
Does this have anything to do
with the cable being out?

533
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,360
Come on, let's go.
-What? Wait, wait, wait.

534
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,040
What if I don't wanna go?
-Then I'd be forced to force you.

535
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,080
Hi. I'm with the fire department.

536
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,480
We need everyone
to gather in the atrium.

537
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,600
Do you speak English?

538
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,120
Do you speak English?

539
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,160
English? No.

540
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,240
Okay,
we need everybody downstairs, so...

541
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,240
All right, there's people down there,
and we need you two to go there.

542
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,640
You understand?

543
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,280
Fire department.

544
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,480
Fire department.

545
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,200
Ma'am?

546
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,400
Hello, ma'am?

547
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,000
Ma'am, I'm with the fire department.

548
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,440
We need you to quickly and calmly
walk down to the lobby, please.

549
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,120
Excuse me, ma'am.

550
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,560
Ma'am.

551
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,120
Ma'am,
we need you to get downstairs, okay?

552
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,560
What's wrong with her?

553
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,240
I don't know.

554
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,200
You wanna give me a hand?
-Yeah.

555
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,920
I don't know that that's a good idea.
-She needs help.

556
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,440
Just grab her.

557
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,080
Okay. Now lift her up.

558
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,960
Okay.

559
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,760
We're just taking you downstairs,
okay, ma'am?

560
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,440
All right?

561
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,640
Oh, Jesus.

562
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,520
Okay? Okay?

563
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,000
Okay? Yeah.

564
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,160
Oh, she's really sick.

565
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,600
Holy shit. Did you see that?

566
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,520
That rat just totally came after me.
Hey, did you see that?

567
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,480
Come on.

568
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,880
Un-fucking-believable.

569
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,120
Oh, my God, look at Elise.
-Somebody grab that chair.

570
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,280
Oh, my God, look at Elise.
-Somebody grab that chair.

571
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,240
What's wrong with her?
-Set her down, set her down.

572
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,320
Can't stop the bleeding.
Get him to a hospital. He's gonna die.

573
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,160
Stay here.
I'm gonna check the exit.

574
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,240
No, no, wait.
We are under strict orders...

575
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,600
We're under orders
to stay in the hall. Help me.

576
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,440
Fuck your orders, all right?
My friend's dying!

577
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,320
I'm coming out.
-Do not...

578
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Didn't catch that. You're breaking up.
-Two people have died.

579
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,120
Two others are in need of medical
care. Police have blocked off the exit.

580
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,640
They've given us no explanation.
We're trying to find a way out.

581
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,840
Oh, my God.
-Shit.

582
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,760
Get away from the window.
-Go, go.

583
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,080
You need to remain in the building.

584
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,160
We have civilians in here.

585
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,240
Briana, don't.

586
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,000
Attention, please.
Do not try to leave the building.

587
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,440
All exits have been sealed.
Just stay calm.

588
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,680
We will send someone in there
shortly to assess the situation.

589
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,560
Thank you for your cooperation.

590
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,960
What are we supposed to do?

591
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,000
What are we supposed to do?
-Just wait.

592
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,200
There's five there. What happened?

593
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,800
Sir, sir, sir.

594
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,920
Give me your headphones.

595
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,560
No, you're not getting my question.

596
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,960
Not getting my question.

597
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,160
I'm asking
why they're calling this a BNC.

598
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,920
What's a BNC?
-I don't know.

599
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,560
Hello?

600
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,960
Hello?

601
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,440
Hello?

602
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,760
Hello?
-Hello?

603
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,320
Is somebody there?
-Hello?

604
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
Honey, hello?

605
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,520
Why is the phone breaking?
Why is it not working?

606
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,320
What's a BNC?
-Who said anything about...?

607
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,920
You. You're still miked.
-Wait.

608
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,120
What?
-Don't jump to...

609
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,880
What's a BNC? What is it?

610
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,320
They're calling this a BNC?

611
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,320
A biological,
nuclear or chemical threat.

612
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,840
Oh, my God.
-Nuclear?

613
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,440
What?
-No, don't worry, okay?

614
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,480
It's more common than you think.
-Supposed to be reassuring?

615
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,800
Our cell phones don't work.
Neither do the TVs or our radios.

616
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,880
Why are they isolating us?
-I don't know.

617
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,400
My daughter has a fever.

618
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,600
What does she have?
-They're pointing guns.

619
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,200
You can't keep us trapped here.

620
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,920
We're all trapped.
-That's right.

621
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,560
We are all trapped in here.
Step over here.

622
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,040
Here.
-What will they do?

623
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,600
Step over here, please.
-Jake, Jake.

624
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,360
There might be... From the office on
the second floor, there is an overhang.

625
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,680
Maybe we can use
to jump down to the patio.

626
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,520
Let's go.
-I show you.

627
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm going with you.

628
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,520
Don't turn the light on.

629
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,920
I don't want anyone knowing
we're in here.

630
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,480
Careful.

631
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,280
When I open the window...
-Yeah?

632
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,080
Go to the right side and jump.

633
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,720
It's only two and a half meters.

634
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,280
Get away from the window.

635
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,720
For your own safety.
-No.

636
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,520
Step away.
-Wait, wait, wait.

637
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,040
Step away.
-Wait, listen.

638
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,440
Can you see me? Can you see me?

639
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,960
What are you doing?
-We have a film crew in here.

640
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,720
Tell your boss
we have a TV crew in here.

641
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,520
We are filming this. Please, wait.

642
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,760
People are gonna see
what you're doing to us.

643
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,720
Why can't we go out?
-People are gonna see this.

644
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,960
Please. Wait.

645
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,000
What are you doing in here?

646
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,240
You knew about this, didn't you?
-Knew what?

647
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
That they're sealing us in here.

648
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,840
What the fuck is this?

649
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,640
What is going on?
-You tell us.

650
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,080
I don't know anything and don't you
fucking put your hands on me again.

651
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,040
I don't know anything, okay?

652
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,880
Get this fucking camera out.

653
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,960
Don't touch me.
-Don't touch that camera.

654
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,200
We need to show people
what's going on here.

655
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,120
Only proof we have.
-Don't you get it?

656
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,440
You're locked in here like us.
You think they give a shit about you?

657
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,760
Step back.
-Hey, hey, hey.

658
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,200
Let's all just calm down, all right?
-Shut up.

659
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,000
Put the gun down.
-Shut up.

660
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,760
Go back downstairs now, okay?

661
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,320
Yeah, okay, okay, but...

662
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,000
Shut up!

663
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,760
Damn. Go back downstairs.

664
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,760
This thing is getting to all of us.

665
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,040
No one here
is gonna hurt you, okay?

666
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,720
We're trying to get out.
That's all we're trying to do.

667
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,160
Just put the gun down.

668
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,160
I'm sorry, man.

669
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,680
I'm sorry, all right?
-Yeah.

670
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,400
I was just freaked out. Let's go.

671
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,200
We all are.
-Go downstairs, okay?

672
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,320
All right?
-Yeah, let's get downstairs, man.

673
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,680
Shit.

674
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,840
Fuck.

675
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,360
Grab his legs, okay?
Come on, let's go.

676
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
What we'll do
is we'll roll him on his side.

677
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,080
We just have to be really careful.

678
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,080
What time is it?
-One-thirty-seven.

679
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,880
Five, four, three...

680
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,040
It's 1:37 in the morning,
and everyone is scared.

681
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,880
They've given us no information,
cut off communication...

682
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,560
...from walkie-talkies and cell phones
to the building's cable and Internet.

683
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,640
The people trapped here,
myself included...

684
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,200
...can't help but ask why.

685
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,080
How's he doing?

686
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,920
Well, he's not good.

687
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,760
Yeah.

688
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,000
Yeah.

689
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,960
Excuse me. It's Terrence, right?

690
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,960
No, Lawrence.
-Lawrence, right.

691
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,760
Listen, I've got a ton of Vicodin
in my apartment, if that will help.

692
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,280
Yeah, that's gonna help.

693
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,240
I'll just... I'll grab a bunch of stuff.

694
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,600
I basically got a pharmacy up there.

695
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,800
You can't arrest me for that,
because of self-incrimination...

696
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,400
Sir, you are the least
of my worries right now, okay?

697
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,760
All right, I was just asking.
-Go.

698
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,880
Do what you're gonna do, please.

699
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,240
I'm going. I'm going.

700
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,440
You ever seen
anything like this before?

701
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,320
No, I've never
seen anything like this.

702
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,680
Mostly because I'm a vet.

703
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,280
I don't usually treat people.
Dogs and cats, mostly.

704
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,760
All I can really do is I can dress
their wounds and try to comfort them.

705
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,640
How are the injured men doing?

706
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,520
They both lost a lot of blood,
and the fireman over here...

707
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,880
...he's got a bunch of broken bones
and probable internal bleeding.

708
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:59,560
Apparently, Mrs. Espinoza attacked
and bit them in some kind of a fit.

709
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,200
But honestly,
I find that a little hard to believe...

710
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,160
...that an old lady could do
something like this to two grown men.

711
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,600
Ready? Ready to film?

712
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,720
Okay.

713
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,320
What's your name?
-Briana.

714
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,800
Briana, that's a very pretty name.
How old are you, Briana?

715
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,360
Five.
-And who do you live with?

716
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,960
With my mom
and my dad and my dog, Max.

717
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,680
Max. I haven't met Max. Where is he?

718
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,680
My dad took him to the vet
because he's sick.

719
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,440
You sound a little sick yourself.
-Yeah.

720
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,160
She's had it for weeks, it's not like...
-You know what?

721
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,600
If you don't mind, I'd like to keep
you quiet while I interview Briana.

722
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,440
It confuses the audience
when people talk from off-camera.

723
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,640
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
-No, no, it's okay.

724
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,040
I'll interview you afterwards.
-No, that's fine.

725
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,480
Okay.
-We don't need that.

726
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,560
Okay, thank you.

727
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,000
I don't like being sick.

728
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,640
Yeah, I don't like being sick either.

729
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,600
Briana, you're a very brave girl...

730
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,080
...and I'm really happy
we got a chance to meet.

731
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,280
Yeah?
-Yeah.

732
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,320
She's been fearless
since she was little.

733
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,280
She's an incredibly strong child.

734
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,200
Okay? Okay.

735
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,720
Why don't you just start
by introducing yourselves?

736
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,880
Well, I'm Ber... I'm Bernard.
This is my roommate, Sadie.

737
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,200
And this is Martini.

738
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,360
And how long
have you lived in the building?

739
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,920
I've lived here six years.

740
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,760
I've been here two and a half years.

741
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,960
And what do you do for a living?

742
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,280
I'm an opera teacher.

743
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,440
Sadie's my best student, my protégé.

744
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,120
Oh, my God.
-Fletcher.

745
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,000
Where's the vet?

746
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,240
Oh, my God.

747
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,600
Where the hell is the doctor?

748
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,840
I got him, got him, got him.

749
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,480
Hold him, hold him.
Hold his neck, hold his neck.

750
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,680
What is that?

751
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,440
Hold it over, hold his neck.
-Go, go, go.

752
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,560
Oh, my God, is he still alive?

753
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,400
Hold him still, hold him still.
He's gonna go down.

754
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,760
Martini.

755
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,840
Sadie, stay here. Stay.

756
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,720
No, no, stay here, stay here.
No, the dog will come back.

757
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,600
Martini.

758
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,280
Hold him.

759
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,240
Okay, I have to show you something.
-What?

760
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,160
Have to show you something.
Just a sec.

761
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,920
I think I know what this is.

762
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:29,120
Come, come look, look, look.
-Oh, Jesus.

763
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,960
Her tear ducts and salivary glands
are constantly flowing.

764
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,440
She seems
to be unable to swallow or speak.

765
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,120
She has a fever, she's confused.

766
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,680
She has some degree
of paralysis and delirium.

767
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,280
These are all rabies symptoms.

768
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,800
Are you sure?
-I'm a vet.

769
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,640
Never seen it in humans,
but I know what rabies look like.

770
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,160
Are you trying to tell me
these people have rabies?

771
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,880
Tears, saliva, fever.

772
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,280
Tears, saliva, fever.
They have what she has.

773
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,520
But here's the thing. Rabies
takes months for symptoms to show.

774
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,840
This is taking minutes.
I mean, rabies never acts this fast.

775
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,720
How does rabies spread?
Through bites?

776
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,240
No, it's passed through anything wet.
Blood, saliva, any mucous membrane.

777
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,360
So if you get their blood on you,
you're okay.

778
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,160
But if you get their blood on you...

779
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,560
...and it gets into a cut,
into your mouth, eyes...

780
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,920
...then you're not okay.

781
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,760
How's it cured?

782
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,320
No, there's no cure.

783
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,400
People get shots in their stomach.

784
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,000
Before symptoms starts showing.

785
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,000
Once symptoms show,
rabies is 100 percent fatal.

786
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,760
Shit.

787
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,560
Yeah, shit.

788
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:35,480
Where are you going? Where?
-I'm going up to my apartment.

789
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,400
Where are you going? Where?
-I'm going up to my apartment.

790
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,200
What?
-I am going upstairs.

791
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,440
You can't do that.

792
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,720
Why?
-Come down.

793
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,960
Why?
-What do you mean?

794
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,200
Why can't I go?
-We gonna do this all night?

795
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,360
You know why?
-Because it's not safe there.

796
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,040
Oh, yeah,
because it's really safe down here.

797
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,680
You're drunk.
-You know what?

798
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,840
It seems to me, if this is spreading,
maybe we should separate...

799
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,920
...instead of sitting here
in a big group.

800
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,880
You done? You finished?

801
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,240
You done?
-You know what?

802
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,920
I have a God-given right to protect
myself as I see fit, so you know what?

803
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,880
I'm gonna go upstairs...
-Step back.

804
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,800
I'm gonna go and I'm
gonna barricade the shit out of it.

805
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,240
Where do you think they're going?
-You can all sit here and rot.

806
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,160
Oh, you are so close to going to jail.

807
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,680
Are you some kind of affirmative...?
-You are so close to going to jail.

808
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,120
Hey.
-Hurry up, hurry up.

809
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,840
What?
-Where are you going?

810
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,320
Look, this lets out
right next to our apartment.

811
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,040
We wanna see if there's anything
on the news about this.

812
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,480
But the cable's out.
-Cable?

813
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,920
We still use rabbit ears on our TV.

814
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,560
We're going with you.
Wait, wait, wait, we're going with you.

815
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,120
It's just up here to the right.

816
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,200
You're good?

817
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,600
Stop. Just stop.
-What?

818
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,000
Go back downstairs.

819
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,560
The door locked behind me.

820
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,120
Just stay there.

821
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,400
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

822
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,200
Hey, look out.

823
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,120
Oh, my God!
-Look out.

824
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,280
No, no, no!

825
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,160
We can't just open the door. We need
something to hold the dog back with.

826
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,040
Find something!
-There's a fire extinguisher.

827
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,160
Oh, my God.

828
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,400
Stop, stop.

829
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,160
Listen.

830
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,480
Turn it off, Scott. Turn it off.

831
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,120
Oh, I forgot something.

832
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,520
Shouldn't we shut the door?
-Close the door.

833
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,000
Okay.
-I left the music on.

834
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,560
Folk music.

835
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,640
The TV's back here.

836
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,480
All right.

837
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,400
Okay.

838
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,240
It usually takes
a couple of seconds to...

839
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,480
There we go, all right.

840
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,800
Fiddle with this...
-Make sure that...

841
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,400
No, I know what I'm doing.

842
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,360
No, I'm...
-Yeah, I know, all right?

843
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,600
...third hour of our coverage.
-There.

844
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,440
There it is.
...receiving conflicting reports.

845
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,600
Hind me was comp... Evacuated...

846
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,240
that the CDC...

847
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,840
Chief.

848
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,320
Tell us why the CDC
is entering the building.

849
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,160
Precaution.
Everyone's been evacuated.

850
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,720
What?

851
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,920
Why would he broadcast that?

852
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,640
Why would he say that?

853
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,320
What the fuck is going on here?

854
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,400
What happened?
-Power's out.

855
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,880
Oh, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

856
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,440
What was that?
-Quiet.

857
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,920
Sadie, stay with me.
Sadie, come here.

858
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,640
Sadie, come over here.

859
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,680
Stay with me. It cannot be.

860
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,760
Stay with me.
-You gotta close that door.

861
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,800
Sadie, look out.

862
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,360
Get off me.
-Oh, my God.

863
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,200
Get off of me.

864
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,000
Bernard, stay with me.

865
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,840
Hit her again!

866
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,720
Oh, my God.

867
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,320
Angela, you have blood
all over your shirt.

868
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,360
Scott.
-What?

869
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,320
Scott.

870
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,000
What do you want?

871
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,440
You okay?

872
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,560
Yeah, I'm just fine.

873
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,040
I mean, I just killed something
with my camera...

874
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,600
...and, you know, I'm just fine.

875
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,440
Yeah.

876
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,320
Scott.

877
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,560
What, Angela? What you?

878
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,240
I need a moment now.

879
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,960
I'm with you.

880
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,880
I'm with you, you're with me, okay?
-Okay, okay, okay, we're here.

881
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,760
We're here together, all right?

882
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,840
We get out of here as fast
as we fucking can, you hear me?

883
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,120
Okay, okay.
-Together?

884
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,760
That everybody?
-Getting the last one.

885
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,960
All right, keep going.

886
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,440
All right, it's been a long,
exhausting night for all of us...

887
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,760
...but we just got word from outside.

888
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,240
Well, it's about bloody fucking time,
isn't it?

889
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,480
Yes, they told me
they're sending in the CDC.

890
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,840
CDC?
-What's...?

891
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,600
Center for Disease Control.
-Why?

892
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,040
Yes, but relax, it's fine.
They're gonna come in.

893
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,000
They're gonna run blood tests
on residents to clarify things.

894
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,840
Just the residents?
-No, everybody.

895
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,760
Everybody,
so once they check it out...

896
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,720
...make sure everything's okay,
we should be able to get out.

897
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,400
Oh, thank God.
-That won't work.

898
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,760
What are you talking about?
-That doesn't work, not for rabies.

899
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,360
Nobody said anything about rabies.
-I did, I told you it was rabies.

900
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,080
How do you test for rabies?

901
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,640
There's only one way.
You gotta get a brain sample.

902
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,080
Come on.
-Man, just shut up.

903
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,760
What you have to do.
-Let's make sure everyone's here.

904
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,320
A simple "here" will be fine.

905
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,760
So let's get started.

906
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,120
How many units per floor?
-Three.

907
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,360
There are three.
-Okay.

908
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,040
Second floor, Unit A,
that's where Mrs. Espinoza lives?

909
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,480
Yes.
-Who's in B?

910
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,080
Me and Sadie.
-Here.

911
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,080
Who's in Unit C?

912
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,360
Unit C.

913
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,120
The lawyer.

914
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,320
Randy.
-Elevat...

915
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,680
All right, third floor, Unit A.
Who's up there?

916
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,600
That's me, my daughter
and my husband, who's been outside...

917
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,480
Yes, yes, yes, we know. Thank you.

918
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,120
Unit B, please.
-Us.

919
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,120
My wife and me.
-Who's in Unit C?

920
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,560
Vacant.
-Why we doing this?

921
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,320
Vacant.
-Nobody's been there...

922
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,880
Fourth floor, Unit A, who's up there?
-That was Elise. She's dead.

923
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,760
What?
-She's dead?

924
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,200
4B, who's in B?
-It's me, me, here.

925
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,240
Who's in C?
-It's them.

926
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,440
You two?

927
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,200
They don't understand you.
Them and her father.

928
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,520
And her father's upstairs?
-Sick, he's paralytic.

929
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,840
Maybe this is all his fault.

930
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,440
How do you know? You don't know...
-Listen up, all right, let's finish up.

931
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,840
Okay.
-Somebody knows.

932
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,600
What was I even gonna say?
Who lives in the attic?

933
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,120
A man from Boston. He rents it,
but I haven't seen him in months.

934
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,880
Wait, if her father's upstairs,
should we bring him down?

935
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,600
What if he's the cause?
We can't bring sick people here.

936
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,800
Your daughter's sick, isn't she?
-She has fever. Hardly the same.

937
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,120
Yeah, so we should bring
her father downstairs.

938
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,800
Hey, hey.
-Stop, stop it.

939
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,480
Hey.
-Stop fighting.

940
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,600
Listen.
-How many times you gonna do this?

941
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,480
Nobody's going.
We're gonna stay here.

942
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,520
They'll let us know
when they wanna move us, period.

943
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,200
Can we finish?

944
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,440
Fine.
-Thank you.

945
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,120
The cleaning lady.

946
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,400
Yeah, the cleaning lady.

947
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,080
The cleaning lady was here.
-I saw her this morning.

948
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,840
She's deceased.

949
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,240
What?
-What did he say?

950
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,040
What?
-She's gone.

951
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,920
Stand back from the door.

952
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,480
Open the door.

953
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,960
Show me your hands.
-L.A.P.D.

954
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,840
CDC's now making their way
into the building.

955
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,720
There are security measures in place.

956
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,800
We still have no idea
what's happening.

957
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,600
From the look of the precaution
that they're taking...

958
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,000
...it's something very serious.

959
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,720
I want you
to just keep this area clear.

960
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,520
This is...

961
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,480
This is blood from my partner here.

962
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,680
He's in the back. This blood
is from the second firefighter.

963
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,200
You, turn it off. Turn it off now.

964
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,400
Now. Turn it off.

965
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,160
Okay, okay, it's off.

966
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,240
Jesus.

967
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,640
Okay, everyone here.
Everybody here is good.

968
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,400
The two guys are in the back.
That's all we can tell you.

969
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,960
I don't know anything else right now.
-Okay.

970
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,720
Just take me to the injured.
Everyone else stays here.

971
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,800
You heard him. Stay here.

972
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,760
Clear this area.

973
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,280
They tell us to stay calm,
and they come dressed like that?

974
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,560
It's gonna be all right.
-What? You honestly believe that?

975
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,920
I'm gonna open it.

976
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,240
Can you see?

977
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,640
That's good. That's good.

978
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,760
I'm gonna take samples
from both men.

979
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,880
Up here. Up here.

980
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,320
Okay.
-Can you get up there?

981
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,160
Yeah, okay, cool.

982
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,240
Hey, hold this, hold this.

983
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,640
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

984
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,280
You got it?

985
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,720
Okay, give it to me.

986
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,840
Give me the camera, come on.

987
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,360
Give me the camera.

988
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,560
Can you see?
-Yeah.

989
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,480
What's happening?

990
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,280
They're handcuffing him.
-Who?

991
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,120
Fletcher.

992
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,000
The other one's got a syringe.

993
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,920
He just gave Fletcher a shot.

994
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,800
Oh, shit.
-What?

995
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,000
He's got a drill.

996
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,960
Oh, Jesus.
-What?

997
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,520
I think the vet was right.

998
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,240
I think he's taking a brain sample.

999
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,640
Holy shit.
-Scott?

1000
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,400
Hey, look out.

1001
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,560
Angela, run. Run!

1002
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,520
Angela, run. Run!

1003
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,120
The vet's in there.
He's still in there.

1004
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,280
Open the door.
-We can't, he's been bitten.

1005
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,080
Come on, let him out.
-I'm not infected, you're wrong.

1006
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,720
I'm not infected. I'm all right.

1007
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,080
They didn't get me.
-What are you talking about?

1008
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,440
Are you sure he's been bitten?
-Yes, and I'm not taking any chances.

1009
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,200
Back away till the infected people
have been handcuffed.

1010
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,080
Infected with what?

1011
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,440
Would you get that out of my face?
-What happens happens in the open.

1012
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,240
They have a right to shoot this,
okay?

1013
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,160
You okay?
-Lawrence.

1014
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,760
Lawrence, you okay?

1015
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,000
God, this isn't right.

1016
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,560
Calm down, calm down. No.

1017
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,640
It's not right.
-It would not be right to let him out...

1018
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,400
You tell us what's going on.

1019
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,360
I'm not authorized to tell...
-Bullshit.

1020
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,800
You left my friend
because he tried to kill you.

1021
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,000
Tell us what you know.

1022
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,840
Tell us what you know.
-Yeah, okay, goddamn, okay.

1023
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,800
We got a call from a vet
who had a sick dog brought in.

1024
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,200
They ran the routine tests,
it was nothing they'd ever seen before.

1025
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,440
Then it started
attacking the other animals.

1026
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,680
And within an hour,
all the injured animals...

1027
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,520
...showed the same kind
of aggression.

1028
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,240
Yeah. The dog's collar
led us to this building.

1029
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,480
Was the dog's name Max?

1030
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,080
Yes.

1031
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,960
She only has bronchitis.
-Bullshit, bronchitis.

1032
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,640
No, don't you dare.
-Kathy.

1033
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,360
Bronchitis.
-We need to find out.

1034
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,320
Relax, ma'am. Relax.
We have to be sure.

1035
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,720
No, get away from me.

1036
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,880
Dog spread the infection
through his saliva.

1037
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,120
We just gotta check.

1038
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,720
Let him do a check, ma'am.
-No.

1039
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,960
That's all we gotta do.

1040
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,440
That's all she has, just bronchitis.

1041
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,680
No.
-Go, go.

1042
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,880
Get back. Get back.

1043
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,120
Get back. Watch out.

1044
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,320
Run, Briana. Run, sweetheart.

1045
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,360
Get the girl.
-No, get away from her.

1046
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,400
Hold her. Hold her.
-Run!

1047
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,480
Run, sweetie, please!
-Get the handcuffs.

1048
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,200
Come on, come on.
-No, let me go.

1049
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,960
Don't hurt her. Please!

1050
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,880
Please,
you need to get us out of here.

1051
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,440
Stop it! Stop it!

1052
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,160
Cuff her.
-No.

1053
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,360
Come here. Come.

1054
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,880
Honey.
-She's cuffed.

1055
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,240
Honey.
-Back away.

1056
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,680
Back away.
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

1057
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,520
No.
-Father.

1058
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,720
Father.
-What father?

1059
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,080
Her father's sick in bed.
-Nobody told me that.

1060
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,840
We thought everyone was down here.

1061
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,160
All right, here. Take this.

1062
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,000
Get the girl and inject her with it.

1063
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,280
No, no.
-And you, bring everybody down here.

1064
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,120
Bring Briana. Okay.

1065
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,800
Kathy, we're gonna get her.
We're gonna bring her down.

1066
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,560
Run, honey!
-Going up.

1067
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,400
We're not gonna hurt you.
-Get away!

1068
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,520
Get away from her! Honey.

1069
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,320
Briana.

1070
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,720
Briana.

1071
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,120
Run!

1072
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,440
Honey.

1073
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,240
Briana.

1074
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,400
Get away from her.

1075
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,960
Oh, God.

1076
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,280
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

1077
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,800
Okay, okay. All right.

1078
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,440
Briana?

1079
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,680
Oh, God.

1080
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,360
Where the hell's the old lady?
-The old lady's gone.

1081
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,360
Briana?

1082
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,120
Okay. Just take it easy, okay?

1083
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,960
Briana?

1084
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,000
Briana?

1085
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,040
Oh, Briana.

1086
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,840
Briana?
-Briana?

1087
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,840
Shit.

1088
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,320
Shit, I'm sorry.

1089
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,240
Briana?

1090
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,640
Oh, shit.

1091
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,760
Briana?

1092
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,320
Oh, I think she's in here, Jake.

1093
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,120
Hell.

1094
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,040
She's over there. She's over there.

1095
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,840
You all right?

1096
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,640
Now, I need you
to give me your hand, okay?

1097
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,560
Okay?

1098
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,880
What happened to her eyes?

1099
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,120
Please don't stop. Please, don't.

1100
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,960
Get her off me.

1101
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,160
Go, go.

1102
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,680
She bit me. Go, Jake!

1103
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,880
Get out of here.
-Go, go, go.

1104
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,960
Come on, go. Let's go.

1105
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,840
Go, go, go.
-They're getting out.

1106
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,680
They're getting out.

1107
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,520
No, no, no.

1108
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,240
Go back.
-They're getting out.

1109
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,120
Oh, they're getting out. Run, run!

1110
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,120
Don't go. Wait!

1111
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,800
They're getting close. Run.

1112
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,520
Okay. Run! Run!

1113
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,600
Don't leave me.

1114
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,560
Don't leave me.
-I'm not gonna leave her.

1115
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,960
Don't leave me.
-We have to get out of here.

1116
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:36,480
It's not right! It's not right!

1117
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,560
Come on.
-No, no, not that way. This way.

1118
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,640
Hurry up, come on.
Where are the others?

1119
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,840
Come on, let's go.

1120
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,520
Hurry up.

1121
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,240
Lock it, lock it, lock it!
-Hurry up.

1122
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,280
Help me, help me.

1123
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,040
Were you bitten?
-No.

1124
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,800
You?
-No.

1125
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,000
You?
-No.

1126
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,680
Scott?

1127
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,560
Scott?

1128
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,200
Were you bitten?
-No.

1129
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,760
Angie?

1130
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:51,880
No.

1131
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,400
Hey, what about you?
-No, no.

1132
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,480
Hey, you.

1133
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,880
On the floor.

1134
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,160
Hey, you been bitten?
-No, no.

1135
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,160
Jake, did you find the little girl?

1136
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,280
Who gives a shit about the little girl?

1137
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,680
All right.
We've lost control of the building.

1138
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,480
We're fucked.

1139
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,520
Damn it.

1140
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,280
I don't understand.

1141
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,600
I don't understand.
They were biting her face off.

1142
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,560
I don't know
what the fuck is happening.

1143
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,320
Damn it.
-I don't understand.

1144
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,200
We could all be infected by now.
We gotta get out of here.

1145
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,560
I'm not moving. I'm done.

1146
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,000
I'm not moving.
-Hey, we wait here, we wait here.

1147
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,840
We have to get out of here.
-Listen.

1148
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,800
We have to stay here and wait
till somebody come and get us.

1149
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,560
They're not gonna come and get us.

1150
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,800
Oh, yes, they will.
-They are not gonna come!

1151
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,640
They don't give a shit about us!
They're gonna let us die!

1152
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,280
They don't care about us.

1153
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,760
Scott, we're gonna die!

1154
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,600
Oh, fuck.
-She's right.

1155
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,320
Who was that?
-It was the doctor.

1156
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,640
What?

1157
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,720
I'm gonna kill you.
-I've been bit.

1158
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,000
You left us down there.

1159
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,680
Piece of shit.

1160
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,720
I've been bitten.

1161
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,600
He's been bitten.

1162
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,720
He's been bitten. Get back.

1163
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,120
Close those doors.

1164
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,920
Somebody close
those fucking doors.

1165
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,560
It won't hold him.

1166
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,960
It's not gonna hold him for long.

1167
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,800
Get back.
-She's bleeding.

1168
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,120
She's bleeding.

1169
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:25,840
She's bleeding.

1170
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,040
Sadie.

1171
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,280
No.

1172
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,840
We have to kill her.

1173
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,240
No, no.

1174
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,840
Hey, hey, hey,
you're not gonna fucking touch her.

1175
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,480
We gotta get out. Gotta get out.

1176
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,120
Gotta get out of here.
Gotta get out of here. Come on.

1177
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,400
Help me get out of here.

1178
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,680
Let me get out of here, please.

1179
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,840
Hey, hey.

1180
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,240
Please. Hey!

1181
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,520
Hey. Hey.

1182
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,320
Please, get me...

1183
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,800
Oh, my God.

1184
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,960
Sniper!

1185
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,240
Scott.

1186
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,200
They're not gonna let us out
of here alive, are they?

1187
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,880
No.

1188
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,680
I don't think so.

1189
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,360
There might be a way out.
-What?

1190
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,760
Jake, there might be a way out.

1191
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,560
How? How do we get out of here?

1192
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,120
Listen, Jake.

1193
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,960
There is a drain cover in the basement
that joins up with the sewers.

1194
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,920
We need the key, we need the key.
-The keys are in our apartment.

1195
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,280
Come with us.

1196
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,960
Come with us!
You have to come with us!

1197
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,280
I won't leave him. I can't leave him.

1198
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,480
Leave him alone.

1199
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,600
Oh, my God!

1200
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,120
We have to get out of here!
We have to get the key.

1201
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,480
Key's in Yuri's apartment.
Know where he lives?

1202
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,200
You made the list of residents.
Where does he live?

1203
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,800
I can't remember where it's at.

1204
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,160
You have to think about it.
Think, think, think.

1205
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,040
I don't know, I don't know.
-Think!

1206
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,360
I don't know which apartment.
I don't know which apartment it is.

1207
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,000
Mailboxes, mailboxes.

1208
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,840
Mailboxes.

1209
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,400
Yeah, get the hammer.

1210
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,280
Grab the hammer.
-I got it, I got it.

1211
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,560
Go.
-Keep moving.

1212
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,760
Oh, keep moving, man.
Keep moving.

1213
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,600
I'm coming.

1214
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,920
Where is it? Which one is it?

1215
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,320
Hurry.

1216
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,840
Yuri lvanov, 3B.

1217
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,280
Three. Get to the elevator.

1218
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,840
Three. Oh, God.
-Oh, shit.

1219
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,720
Get to the elevator.

1220
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,280
But the electricity?

1221
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,080
It should run on auxiliary power.
We're good.

1222
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,680
She's cuffed. We can get by.

1223
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:01,400
Come on. Come on.

1224
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,080
Come on.

1225
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,520
Oh, God.
-Get in.

1226
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,800
Get in.

1227
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,160
Get in. Get in.

1228
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:15,120
Hurry! Hurry. Hurry.

1229
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,600
Close the fucking door.

1230
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,120
Easy, easy.

1231
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,840
But it's gonna stop at two.
We're gonna stop at two!

1232
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,720
The light, the light!
-I'll get it.

1233
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,080
I'm fixing it, come on.
-The light.

1234
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,360
Come on. Come on,
you should get that hammer, Jake.

1235
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,520
They won't close. They won't close.

1236
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,200
It's go... It's gonna go.

1237
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,240
Oh, it's gonna go.

1238
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,840
Oh, shit.
-Scott.

1239
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,560
Scott.

1240
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,440
Scott!

1241
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,080
Get off me.

1242
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,960
No!

1243
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,920
Get up. Come on.

1244
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,440
Get up.

1245
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,520
Get up!

1246
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,560
Scott, I've been bitten!

1247
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,400
I've been bitten.
-No, you haven't.

1248
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,760
No, you haven't. I saw it.

1249
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,320
I was bitten!

1250
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,280
Angie, Angie, they didn't get you.
You didn't get bitten.

1251
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,240
Come on, Angie. Angie.
-I was bitten!

1252
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,480
Look at me, Angie. Come on, baby.
-No!

1253
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,080
Baby, come on, look at me.
-Man, let's go.

1254
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,840
Get off me. Look at me.
-No.

1255
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,040
Let's get out of here.

1256
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,720
You did not get bit.

1257
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,360
You did not get bit. Look at me.

1258
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,600
You did not get bit.

1259
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:28,960
Trust me. You did not.

1260
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,720
I saw it, I saw it.
-We have to go.

1261
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,400
Let's go.
-No. Let's go, baby.

1262
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,200
Come on. Come on! Let's go.

1263
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,560
This is 3B right here. Right here.

1264
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,320
All clear.

1265
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,640
Keep the light on my hands, Scott.
-Okay.

1266
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,760
Find them.
-I don't see it, I don't see.

1267
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,760
The light, the light, the light.
-I'm bringing it back to you.

1268
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,200
Nothing.

1269
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,640
I don't...

1270
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,560
No, no, he wouldn't
leave them in there.

1271
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,400
Hey, he wouldn't leave them in there.

1272
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,640
Come on.

1273
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,200
Hurry.

1274
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,400
Find the keys.

1275
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,240
He's the one that... Who's...?

1276
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,440
Go back to the desk.

1277
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,160
Yeah.
-Find them keys, baby.

1278
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,640
Come on.

1279
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,280
I got them,
but I don't know which one it is.

1280
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,800
I don't know.
-Take them all.

1281
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,760
Which one is it, Scott?
-Take them all.

1282
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,240
Come on.

1283
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,840
Angela, Angela,
I need you to be quiet.

1284
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,240
We need to get three flights of stairs
down to the basement, okay?

1285
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,280
I need you to stay tight.

1286
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,920
I need you to stay close
and stay fast, okay?

1287
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,640
Are you ready? All right, all right.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1288
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,000
Ready, Scott?
-Yeah, yeah.

1289
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,000
All right, all right.

1290
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,040
Okay. All right.

1291
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,880
All right, we can do this.
-Got it.

1292
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,760
We can do this, right, Angela?
-Yeah.

1293
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,440
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

1294
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,000
Come on.

1295
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,320
Ready. Come on.

1296
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,600
Scott, come on. Come on, Scott.

1297
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,360
Angela, Angela, stop.

1298
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,280
Hey, we gotta go up. Come on.

1299
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,280
Come on, run, run.

1300
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,320
Get up there. Come on.

1301
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,480
Up. Go.

1302
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,040
Gonna be an old one. Oh, God.
-Go.

1303
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,160
It's gotta be an old one, Scott.
-I know, pick the key.

1304
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,920
Get in there.
-Light, light, light!

1305
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,000
I'm finding it, I'm finding it!
-Come on.

1306
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,800
Go, go, go.
-Scott, I got it.

1307
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,680
Go, go, go.
-I got it!

1308
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,200
Lock it.
-I can't get it.

1309
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,520
Come on.
-I can't get it.

1310
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,600
Scott, I can't!

1311
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,320
Just turn the light on.

1312
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,640
Turn the light on.
-It'll come back on.

1313
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,800
I need the light on!
-It will come back on.

1314
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,960
Oh, please.

1315
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:24,120
There we go, there we go,
there we go. Okay? Okay, listen.

1316
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,440
Listen, listen. They went away.

1317
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,960
I think they went away.
Oh, damn, damn.

1318
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,840
Okay, so this place was locked up.

1319
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,320
What that means, probably,
is there ain't nobody in here. No one.

1320
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,760
Yeah, let's find a way out.

1321
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,680
Oh, God. Come on.

1322
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:44,120
Oh, what is this place, Scott?

1323
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:00,400
Oh, please, keep the light on.
-I got you, I got you.

1324
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,360
What is this?

1325
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,200
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1326
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,600
Come on.

1327
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,200
Come on. Come on, now.

1328
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,440
What is this?
-Oh, please.

1329
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,000
What is this?
-I don't know, man.

1330
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,200
What is it?

1331
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,560
Oh, what is that?
-Please.

1332
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,160
What is it?

1333
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,720
What the hell?

1334
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,280
Oh, shit.

1335
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,680
Oh, God.
Oh, it's all the same kind of stuff.

1336
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,360
I don't understand it.

1337
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,200
Just stop.

1338
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:47,840
Wait.

1339
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,320
Oh, God,
let's get out of here, please.

1340
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,160
Okay, come on.
Come on, grab my hand.

1341
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,840
Grab my hand, it's me, it's me.
Look at it, look at it.

1342
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,800
Just come around this pole.
Let me lead.

1343
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,440
Let me lead. I'm right with you.

1344
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,200
That's the way, okay?
Okay, come on.

1345
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,320
Oh, God, I don't...

1346
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,240
Hey, hey, my bad, my bad.

1347
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,840
Okay.

1348
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,560
Angela?

1349
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:12,080
We're gonna have to go
through that door.

1350
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,760
I just need you to open it.

1351
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,520
You're gonna let me look in first.

1352
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,840
You just open it, okay?
-Yeah.

1353
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,800
Just push it and stand back.

1354
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,600
Stand back. Okay, okay.

1355
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,440
Come on, come on, Angie.
Angie, let's go in there.

1356
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,240
Please, get the light on me, okay?
-Come on.

1357
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,680
Oh, this is so fucked. I don't know.

1358
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,600
Oh, damn.

1359
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:45,040
Oh, shit, stick with me, stick with me.
Come on.

1360
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,000
Okay?

1361
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:52,760
Keep the light on, keep the light on.
-What is it?

1362
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,080
Okay.

1363
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:58,720
Okay, good? You gotta...

1364
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,400
Shit.

1365
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,520
What is this?
-What?

1366
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,600
What is it? What the hell?

1367
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,040
What are you doing?

1368
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,080
Oh, Scott, what is this stuff?
-Okay.

1369
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,640
Okay.

1370
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,560
Who is this? Who is this?

1371
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,000
Oh, what is that?

1372
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:22,160
Is that a fucking?

1373
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,960
Hey, play it.

1374
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,120
I don't know what to do with it.

1375
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:29,720
That's it, come on.

1376
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,240
Hey, what is that?

1377
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,000
What was that?

1378
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,200
I'll come to you.

1379
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,960
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

1380
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,920
Hey, hey, hey.

1381
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,840
Come on.
We don't know what's up there.

1382
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,360
Grab my hand, grab my hand.
-Okay.

1383
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,320
Okay.

1384
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,200
Okay, I'm gonna take the camera.

1385
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,120
Listen to me, listen to me.
I'm gonna take the camera.

1386
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,160
I'm gonna take a look up there.
-No, no.

1387
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,680
Get up the door.
-No, no, no.

1388
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,440
We can't stay the fuck down here.
We can't stay here.

1389
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,760
I won't have a light
if you go up there!

1390
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,280
Angie, Angie, stay with me.
-I'll be in the dark!

1391
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,120
Angie, stay with me!

1392
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,880
Angie, stay with me!

1393
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:59,000
Look, I'm gonna have
to take this light off you.

1394
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,960
Here, grab my waist.
Okay, just grab my waist.

1395
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,600
Good.

1396
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:28,240
Scott, what happened?
What happened?

1397
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,680
Scott, what happened?
What happened?

1398
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,520
Oh, something hit the camera.
-Don't turn it off, fix it.

1399
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,840
I'm trying. Damn it, I'm trying.
-Please!

1400
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,040
I'm trying.

1401
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,280
Look, I'm gonna put
the night vision on.

1402
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,040
I'll put the night vision on. Hold on.

1403
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,040
Just stay there, okay?

1404
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,240
Okay, okay.
-Okay.

1405
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,240
Okay.

1406
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,520
Okay. Okay, I can
see you now, okay?

1407
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,040
Okay.

1408
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,240
All right? Okay.

1409
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,880
Yeah, yeah. Okay,
I'm gonna stick my hand out, okay?

1410
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,840
Okay, okay. Hey.

1411
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,600
Relax, relax, it's me.

1412
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,640
Hey, it's me, it's me, it's me, okay?

1413
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:06,040
Okay, good. Come on, come on.

1414
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,800
Hey, you're doing good.
Come around.

1415
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,640
Come around my back. Hold on.

1416
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,160
Hold on. We'll be okay, okay?

1417
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,200
I just gotta find us a way out of here.

1418
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,800
Okay? Okay.

1419
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,320
I'll find a way out, I promise.

1420
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,600
Just give me a minute.

1421
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,440
What's that? Stay still, stay still.

1422
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,880
Why? Why? Why?

1423
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,920
Get down. Get down.

1424
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,760
Don't make a sound.
Don't make a sound.

1425
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,000
It can't see us.

1426
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:00,080
If it can't hear us,
it won't find us.

1427
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:13,640
Okay, get ready.
We're gonna try to get by it.

1428
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,200
Run!

1429
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,920
Run!

1430
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,880
Scott!
