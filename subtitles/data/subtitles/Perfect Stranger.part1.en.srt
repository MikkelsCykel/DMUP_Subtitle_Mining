1
00:01:39,357 --> 00:01:41,951
- Here you go, miss.
- Thank you.

2
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:45,548
Step through, please.

3
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:49,793
Open your laptop, please.

4
00:01:54,757 --> 00:01:57,590
I guess people take their computers
with them everywhere nowadays.

5
00:01:57,756 --> 00:01:59,076
Security blanket.

6
00:01:59,237 --> 00:02:00,669
Lucky blanket.

7
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:03,596
Next.

8
00:02:17,716 --> 00:02:20,355
Wow, even answer your own door,
senator.

9
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,427
- I'm impressed.
- Front-porch mentality.

10
00:02:22,596 --> 00:02:24,188
I like to know who's visiting.

11
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:27,631
Plus, my secretary, Laura,
just stepped out for an early lunch.

12
00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:30,270
Caroline Eldridge from
Family First is visiting.

13
00:02:30,436 --> 00:02:33,155
You're early. I like that. Come in.

14
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:39,549
- Let's take the sofa.
- Okay.

15
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:44,434
Hope you don't mind if I take
this out.

16
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:47,746
My hard drive is now officially
my only source of memory...

17
00:02:47,915 --> 00:02:51,544
...and I wanna get all those
old-fashioned values down accurately.

18
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:54,787
Now, as you know, we're putting
together our Family First brochure...

19
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:57,628
...and we've got pictures
that we could use captions for.

20
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:00,185
- Fire away.
- Okay.

21
00:03:00,355 --> 00:03:03,153
Let's start with this one.

22
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:07,069
That's me and some of the staff
in the Gulf of Mexico after Katrina.

23
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:09,591
Heartbreaking stuff.

24
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:11,394
Okay.

25
00:03:11,555 --> 00:03:13,067
Let's call this:

26
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,702
"Senator Sachs and staff
lend a hand in hurricane relief.

27
00:03:18,914 --> 00:03:20,667
- Good.
- How about that?

28
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,392
That's one of my former interns...

29
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:24,192
...Josh.

30
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:26,345
Must have been taken his last day
of work.

31
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:28,425
Let's call it:

32
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:32,827
- "Intern programme a success."
- Okay.

33
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:35,033
Met a lot of good kids that way.

34
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:37,312
I'll bet.

35
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:40,992
How about that one?

36
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,745
Wait, let me try.

37
00:03:42,914 --> 00:03:46,826
"Intern programme
has fringe benefits"?

38
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:49,112
Let's see.

39
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:53,310
- Let's call it "extramarital Sachs."
- Who are you?

40
00:03:53,473 --> 00:03:56,511
Someone who thinks it's a bit
hypocritical for the past two years...

41
00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:59,392
...you've tried to limit the civil rights
of gay individuals...

42
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:01,589
...while being gay yourself.
- Lady--

43
00:04:01,753 --> 00:04:04,028
Preach family first
as if there's one kind of family.

44
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:07,868
I don't know what you think you got
but let me explain something to you.

45
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:11,343
What I've got is a signed statement
by Josh.

46
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:15,222
We've got cancelled cheques and
he's ready to turn over the love notes.

47
00:04:15,393 --> 00:04:18,510
- Laura.
- Out to lunch, remember?

48
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:20,391
It's gonna be your word against his.

49
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:22,908
We're running his tomorrow.

50
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:25,382
<i>I work for David Shane
at the New York Courier.</i>

51
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:26,588
Jesus Christ.

52
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:28,505
Josh came to us seven
months ago...

53
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:30,663
...and thought we'd be interested
in knowing...

54
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,790
...that he's not the only handsome
skeleton in your closet.

55
00:04:33,952 --> 00:04:36,466
So we thought we'd give you
an opportunity to respond.

56
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:40,068
Anything you want.

57
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:44,901
I will give you anything
that you want.

58
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:46,551
Anything.

59
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:51,710
<i>I will give- - I will give you anything
that you want.</i>

60
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:52,986
<i>Anything.</i>

61
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:54,744
You just did, senator.

62
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:57,461
You just did.

63
00:04:58,392 --> 00:04:59,665
Tell me you got that, Miles.

64
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,469
Please tell me you got that.

65
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:02,906
I got it, you psychopath.

66
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:04,949
Jump on the shuttle,
get down to the paper.

67
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:07,546
And we'll get fantastically,
exceedingly drunk.

68
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,069
<i>I will give you anything that you want,
anything.</i>

69
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,744
One more time.

70
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:16,345
You transmitted from D.C.

71
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:17,739
And recorded in New York.

72
00:05:17,912 --> 00:05:19,663
- Go to Legal. It'll check.
- I intend to.

73
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:21,867
Also we need to clear
the quote from the intern.

74
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,261
He's at home waiting for the call.

75
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:26,949
This your headline, David Shane?

76
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:29,950
Yep.

77
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:31,146
We'll be at Chumley's...

78
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,986
...ordering copious amounts of drinks
on this paper.

79
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,104
God, I love this job.

80
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,227
Hey, hey. To David Shane.

81
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:41,859
May this article bring you
all the prizes you deserve.

82
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,387
Fame, alcoholism,
rehab, relapse, rehab.

83
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,144
When you win the Pulitzer,
don't forget the little people.

84
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,950
Oh, fuck the little people.

85
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:54,784
Hey, you're empty. You buy, I fly.

86
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,067
Excuse me, sweetheart.

87
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,548
Careful, Ro. Next round he might aim
for your lips.

88
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,668
Mr. Arvis Narron.

89
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,666
What kind of name is Arvis?

90
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,499
Family name.

91
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,143
Story's been pulled, Ro.

92
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,777
Somebody got to your intern.
Made him clam up.

93
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,827
My guess is somebody with lots
of zeroes.

94
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,742
What?

95
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:28,337
Well...

96
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:30,227
...I'm just gonna go call him.

97
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:32,787
You'll get his lawyer,
just like we did.

98
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:35,509
Do you know I've been working
on this story for six months?

99
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:36,658
Six.

100
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,979
Take a couple weeks off.
You've earned the break.

101
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,901
I'm gonna go back to the office
right now.

102
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:42,900
This guy's got a stack
of interns, trust me.

103
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,378
Kolski wants you to take
a couple of weeks off.

104
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:47,538
That's not a request.

105
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:49,461
Okay, wait, hold up.

106
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:51,183
Please tell me...

107
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:54,421
...you're not saying because the paper
endorsed Sachs' last campaign...

108
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:55,738
...that he's off-limits now.

109
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:58,218
Please tell me that is not
what you're saying.

110
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:00,186
- What's up, Narron?
- Get this, Miles.

111
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:03,067
Tomorrow's headline:
"Free Press Dead."

112
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:05,867
Kolski wants to shut me down
because I went after the senator.

113
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:07,462
Does it ever get to you, Narron?

114
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:11,416
The idea that we're supposed to be
reporting the news not covering it up?

115
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:14,148
Like we couldn't show the dead
bodies coming back from Iraq.

116
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,299
If you don't see it,
means it never happened.

117
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:17,457
Your source ran dry.

118
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:19,983
- My source didn't run dry.
- You can't try to cover up--

119
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,981
My source was paid off.

120
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:25,059
This is a good story, Narron.

121
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:27,016
The story's dead.

122
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:30,387
Classic.

123
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:34,096
Powerful men
protecting powerful men.

124
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:36,019
I backed you when you wanted
anonymity...

125
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:38,576
...when you wanted to write under
an old boy's name.

126
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:42,262
This is not the first time you shut me
down but this is definitely the last.

127
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:47,821
So you tell Kolski keep his paid
vacation because I fucking quit.

128
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:51,382
Taxi. Hey.

129
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,661
Rowena?

130
00:08:10,427 --> 00:08:13,066
Rowena. Wait up.

131
00:08:17,387 --> 00:08:20,184
Wait. Wait.

132
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:21,746
Fuck.

133
00:08:28,706 --> 00:08:31,140
- Rowena.
- Grace. Shit, you scared me.

134
00:08:31,306 --> 00:08:32,978
You didn't return my phone calls.

135
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:36,058
Well, yeah, I've been pretty busy
working out of town.

136
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:41,061
Oh, yeah. The Senator Sachs scandal.
Don't worry. I didn't tell anyone.

137
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:43,103
Besides, I got a better story for you.

138
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:45,461
It's about Harrison Hill.

139
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,185
- Come on.
- We met online.

140
00:08:48,506 --> 00:08:49,824
We did.

141
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:52,977
He was giving a Q and A, I e-mailed
him and told him how great it was.

142
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:56,421
You know, stroke a man's dick
and you get him for one night.

143
00:08:56,985 --> 00:09:00,058
Stroke his ego,
you get him for life, huh?

144
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,054
Yeah, we sort of struck up
a friendship online...

145
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:04,898
...but I could tell that he liked me.

146
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:08,296
So I decided to come to New York
and accidentally bump into him.

147
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,740
I knew about his fundraiser,
so I bought a ticket...

148
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:15,057
...walked right up to him and said,
"Harrison, it's Fast Filly."'

149
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,581
I thought he was gonna be angry.

150
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:21,896
But instead, he's turned on by it.

151
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:24,020
He likes the balls of it.

152
00:09:24,184 --> 00:09:26,016
"Stick around," he says.

153
00:09:26,184 --> 00:09:29,176
Couple hours later, we're doing it
in his Beemer, his hotel suite.

154
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:30,743
He keeps one, creep.

155
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:33,502
What happened to Chuck?

156
00:09:33,665 --> 00:09:35,382
We're fighting more
than we're fucking.

157
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:40,616
Anyway, I get back to Philly,
our online stuff gets pretty hot.

158
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:41,933
He misses me.

159
00:09:42,104 --> 00:09:44,015
I mean, he practically begs me
to move here.

160
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,061
So I check out apartments
and agencies...

161
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:48,658
...and I wanna tell him, you know,
I'm really excited.

162
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:52,658
But suddenly,
I can't get ahold of him.

163
00:09:53,544 --> 00:09:57,014
I mean, I sent him a million e-mails
and he just cuts me off.

164
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:59,778
Cold. Fucker.

165
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:02,257
I know where Hill lives.

166
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:05,780
I've seen his Armani wife.

167
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:08,500
He has no idea what I can do
to him.

168
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:12,301
What is it you want from me this time,
Grace?

169
00:10:12,464 --> 00:10:15,500
Actions have consequences, Ro.

170
00:10:15,663 --> 00:10:17,460
You can't just forget people.

171
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:20,774
Bury them and pretend like
they never existed.

172
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,854
It always comes back to haunt you.

173
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,902
I wonder what Hill would think if David
Shane publishes a few of his e-mails?

174
00:10:27,063 --> 00:10:29,054
I'm sure the wife would find them
interesting.

175
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:33,342
Take them. Read them.

176
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:36,619
Because I'm about an inch away
from ringing this guy's doorbell.

177
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:38,738
Regards to your mother.

178
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:05,581
I know where Hill lives.
I've seen his Armani wife.

179
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:08,980
He has no idea what
I can do to him.

180
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:14,577
<i>To David Shane. May this article
bring you all the prizes you deserve.</i>

181
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:18,098
And when you win the Pulitzer,
don't forget the little people.

182
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:53,011
<i>Here comes the beep.
You know what to do.</i>

183
00:11:53,941 --> 00:11:57,297
<i>Hey, Ro, it's Miles, again.
I've been calling for lik e a week.</i>

184
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:00,532
<i>Are you looking for a job?
If you are, come on, tak e me with you.</i>

185
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,497
<i>Guess what,
my sister had a boy, Fletcher.</i>

186
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,698
<i>How cool is that? I fly home
in an hour. Call me later, please.</i>

187
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:09,489
<i>I hate Narron too.
Narron's a dick. Bye.</i>

188
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,975
<i>Here comes the beep.
You know what to do.</i>

189
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,976
<i>Ro, it's Elizabeth Clayton.
Grace's mother.</i>

190
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,059
<i>- I need help.
- Elizabeth.</i>

191
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:24,653
<i>- Hi.
- Ro? It's Grace.</i>

192
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,777
<i>She's missing. They started calling
from her agency last week.</i>

193
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,216
<i>She goes to New York a lot and
I thought maybe she contacted you.</i>

194
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,939
<i>It's just that I filed
a missing person's report.</i>

195
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:35,453
<i>A woman drowned in New York.</i>

196
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,531
<i>- They ask ed for dental records.
- Elizabeth, hang on a second.</i>

197
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:40,611
<i>- I saw Grace last week.
- Oh, thank God.</i>

198
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:43,977
<i>- Spare yourself a trip.
- But if it is- - If I weren't there- -</i>

199
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,451
<i>I know half the people at the city
morgue. This is not Grace, I promise.</i>

200
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,655
<i>I'll call you when I get back.</i>

201
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:54,413
Hi, I'm Rowena Price.
Here to ID a body.

202
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:59,051
Whoever did this tried to weigh
the body down.

203
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:00,572
Amateur move.

204
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,378
- Why is that?
- Didn't work.

205
00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:05,213
Fair warning.

206
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,615
This isn't pretty.

207
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:12,367
We're guessing an anchor...

208
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:15,497
...or some sharp metal debris
ripped off the face and neck.

209
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:19,094
So we're hoping that you could
identify something else.

210
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:22,377
She has a birthmark, scars...

211
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:24,614
...and it looks like a tattoo--

212
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:53,334
Hi, Rowena.

213
00:13:55,697 --> 00:13:57,529
Do you wanna play?

214
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:01,615
Well, are you coming?

215
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:04,730
<i>Let's go around back.</i>

216
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:08,973
I live up there.

217
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:21,774
<i>You do everything you can to protect
your children.</i>

218
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:23,854
<i>Right schools, right opportunities.</i>

219
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:27,335
<i>But it's all an illusion.
Nobody's safe.</i>

220
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:29,452
Who would do this to my daughter?

221
00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:31,572
We're gonna find out, Mrs. Clayton.

222
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:33,455
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions?

223
00:14:33,616 --> 00:14:36,255
- Can you excuse us?
- No. She's a friend of the family.

224
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:40,816
Do you know if your daughter
had been seeing anyone?

225
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:42,126
Yeah.

226
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:43,935
Chuck. Chuck Freeman.

227
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:45,609
But they'd been having trouble.

228
00:14:45,776 --> 00:14:47,528
Yeah, she told me that too.

229
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:49,448
I ran into her on the subway
last week...

230
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:52,005
...she mentioned
that they were having fights.

231
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:54,053
Was that the last time you saw her?

232
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:55,285
Yeah.

233
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:59,244
<i>I mean, I tried to call her, but she was
in the middle of something, and... .</i>

234
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:02,329
Well, I wish now I had tried
a little bit harder.

235
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:03,645
Oh, I know, honey.

236
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:06,888
They knew each other
since they were kids.

237
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:11,132
You were so close, you two,
especially after your father--

238
00:15:11,296 --> 00:15:12,967
Yeah, I know.

239
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:16,526
Well, you were always so good to me
and my mother.

240
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:17,684
So was Grace.

241
00:15:21,815 --> 00:15:25,012
Mrs. Clayton, we're gonna need you
to sign some papers downstairs.

242
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,403
Certainly.

243
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:28,452
I'll be just a minute.

244
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:31,733
Ro.

245
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:35,691
You know, Grace was so proud
of you.

246
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,525
She saved all your articles.
She bragged about you.

247
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:42,688
How did she know
that I was David Shane?

248
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:45,210
I assumed you told her.

249
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:49,807
I probably did.

250
00:15:50,694 --> 00:15:51,969
Thank you.

251
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:55,444
The police are gonna find out
exactly who did this.

252
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:58,210
I'll make sure they do.

253
00:15:58,934 --> 00:16:00,686
Thank you, honey.

254
00:16:06,414 --> 00:16:07,813
Hey.

255
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:10,212
Hey, Miles.

256
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:14,010
Let me get the key.

257
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:17,291
I'm usually a key-above-the-door
kind of guy.

258
00:16:19,974 --> 00:16:21,407
- Hey, Miles.
- Yeah.

259
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:24,486
When was the last time
you saw Grace?

260
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:29,123
Oh, God, you know me
and dates, l--

261
00:16:29,293 --> 00:16:31,125
All right, well, roughly. A week?

262
00:16:31,293 --> 00:16:34,126
A month? A year?
Five years? What?

263
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,523
Yeah, something like that. Why?

264
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:38,572
Because.

265
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:41,293
Just because I cut somebody out
of my life...

266
00:16:41,454 --> 00:16:44,570
...doesn't mean I expect you
to cut them out of yours.

267
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:47,850
- Well, maybe you do.
- All right, maybe I do.

268
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:50,933
- Why you got to keep it a secret?
- We exchanged e-mails...

269
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,563
...a couple times. I was only nice to
her because she was a friend of yours.

270
00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:56,803
So you told her I was David Shane?

271
00:16:57,813 --> 00:17:00,008
Yeah. Busted.

272
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:02,528
Could you be serious for five
fucking minutes?

273
00:17:02,693 --> 00:17:05,684
I'll bet you told her
about Senator Sachs too, didn't you?

274
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:08,446
I stopped associating with her
when she fucked your boyfriend.

275
00:17:08,613 --> 00:17:09,602
Ask him who told her.

276
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:12,809
You need to stay in your own
fucking lane, that's what I think.

277
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:16,169
You just better leave Cam out of it.
I mean it, Miles.

278
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:19,165
Ro, I'm sorry.
I was being insensitive.

279
00:17:19,332 --> 00:17:21,243
Ro, I'm sorry.

280
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:25,087
It's just-- I was the one
who was left picking up the pieces...

281
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,483
...after Grace and Cameron
tore you apart and l-- And l--

282
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:35,599
Yeah. So, what do the police say?

283
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:39,481
They're chasing a lead on some guy
she was dating in Philly.

284
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:41,768
But I have another idea.

285
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:43,047
Why's that?

286
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:45,926
Because I saw Grace last week.

287
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:50,963
Oh, I'm the one
who's keeping secrets?

288
00:17:51,131 --> 00:17:53,361
She wanted me to chase down
Harrison Hill.

289
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,930
Harrison Hill, Harrison Hill?

290
00:17:55,091 --> 00:17:57,400
Yes, that Harrison Hill.
Here, take a look at this.

291
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:59,368
She was threatening
to go to his wife.

292
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:01,123
Apparently, they met online
in July...

293
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,851
...and had one hell of a weekend
in September.

294
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:06,047
I mean, that's assuming
he is ADEX.

295
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,200
- Wait. Who? Who?
- ADEX.

296
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:09,600
The guy she's been e-mailing,
ADEX.

297
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:12,000
I mean, it tracks.
Harrison Hill owns...

298
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:15,527
...the biggest ad agency
in New York City?

299
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:20,320
"I'm gonna fuck you so hard,
I'm gonna split you in half."

300
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:24,006
Oh, my.

301
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:27,362
Oh, my God.

302
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,243
Wait a minute, Ro.
This is not a story.

303
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,325
Miles, I would love, love, love to get
my hands on the rest of these e-mails.

304
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,720
Because the way I see it, Grace was
fucking Hill, he dumped her...

305
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,962
...she got pissed, threatened to go
to the wife, and she wound up dead.

306
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,245
I mean, come on.

307
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,479
- It's simple, that's it.
- This is Harrison Hill.

308
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,719
If he wanted somebody dead,
he won't do it hims--

309
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,802
- That's just the first of all.
- She was stalking the guy.

310
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:57,439
She sent him a million e-mails.
She probably even went to his house.

311
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,883
Who knows?

312
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:02,326
All it takes to commit a murder...

313
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:06,038
...are the right ingredients
at the right time.

314
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:12,119
Son of a bitch.

315
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:15,646
<i>- Hey, where are you?
- G.W. Bridge.</i>

316
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:17,242
Why? What's up?

317
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:20,002
I got into Grace's Hotmail account.
It's her main one.

318
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:22,318
There's a shitload of guys in there,
by the way.

319
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:23,967
But none of them are ADEX.

320
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:26,085
But that's not the account
I gave you, Miles.

321
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:30,242
Well, hold on. And then I looked at her
other account, FastFilly@iol.com...

322
00:19:30,408 --> 00:19:34,004
...and guess who's all up in her box?
ADEX. Ro.

323
00:19:34,488 --> 00:19:36,798
- Yeah?
- You got to read some of this shit.

324
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,527
<i>I wanna read it all, Miles.</i>

325
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:41,157
Okay. So, I'm gonna bring over
everything after work.

326
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:44,081
And, Ro, we still don't know
that ADEX is Hill.

327
00:19:44,248 --> 00:19:46,478
And we still don't know
that he's not.

328
00:19:46,848 --> 00:19:47,837
Yeah.

329
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:27,641
Hey, your dinner's getting warm.

330
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:35,726
Hold it.

331
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:39,916
Can I just say for the record, wow.

332
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:46,322
Can I also say that's just a ridiculous
outfit to be wearing for takeout?

333
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:48,397
Well, I didn't know
you were bringing takeout.

334
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,603
Well, I didn't know you had a date.

335
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:53,520
- Oh, God.
- Who's the...?

336
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,837
Who's the lucky guy?

337
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:58,841
Can we just look at the e-mails,
please?

338
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:01,042
Sure. Yeah. Here, here.
Have a seat.

339
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:03,165
Okay.

340
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,718
So yeah.

341
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:13,517
You told me that Grace wanted you
to threaten Hill.

342
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:17,280
Well, she was doing it without you
for a while. Listen. This, this--

343
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:20,518
This e-mail's a week old
and it's her last one.

344
00:21:20,686 --> 00:21:23,154
"Harrison, if you don't," capital,
"pay attention to me...

345
00:21:23,326 --> 00:21:25,521
...you're going to," capital,
"pay the price.

346
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,245
I'm in the city
and I know your wife's away.

347
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:31,682
Meet with me now,
or I'll meet with her later."

348
00:21:31,846 --> 00:21:35,076
So Grace knew that the wife
was out of town.

349
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:37,839
You're going under the assumption
that Grace actually knew...

350
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,155
...what she was talking about,
which is a mistake.

351
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:42,441
By the way, even though she calls
ADEX Harrison...

352
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:45,836
...it doesn't prove that it's Harrison
Hill. It's not proof enough to print.

353
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,996
Okay. So how do we prove it?

354
00:21:48,165 --> 00:21:49,803
Well, technically we can't prove it...

355
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:52,115
...but if we can get ADEX
to send us an e-mail...

356
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:56,164
...I can tail it, jimmy the lock, and then
take a closer look into his account.

357
00:21:57,445 --> 00:21:59,958
You are amazing.

358
00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:03,035
I love you, man.

359
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:06,198
This is just such an obstruction
of justice.

360
00:22:06,364 --> 00:22:09,162
No, no, no.
This is the pursuit of justice.

361
00:22:09,324 --> 00:22:11,918
I'll make you a deal.
We get anything concrete on Hill...

362
00:22:12,085 --> 00:22:14,552
...we'll go to the cops
and to Narron on the same day.

363
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:16,555
They get their man.
We get our story.

364
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:18,396
But even if ADEX turns out
to be Hill...

365
00:22:18,564 --> 00:22:20,794
...it's not a crime to chat nor cheat.

366
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,240
But it is a crime to be walking out
on a feast like this in that outfit.

367
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:26,395
And yet, I have to because I'm late.

368
00:22:26,564 --> 00:22:28,680
So you finish up.
I'll see you tomorrow.

369
00:22:28,844 --> 00:22:31,039
Shut the door. It locks by itself.

370
00:22:31,204 --> 00:22:32,876
Have fun.

371
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:41,562
Harrison Hill.

372
00:22:45,443 --> 00:22:46,638
Oh, there you are.

373
00:22:58,723 --> 00:23:00,281
Cam.

374
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:01,432
- Oh, Cam.
- Come here.

375
00:23:01,603 --> 00:23:03,958
- You are naughty.
- Come on.

376
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:11,356
Come here.

377
00:23:13,843 --> 00:23:15,834
Oh, yeah.

378
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,316
Yeah.

379
00:23:32,082 --> 00:23:34,073
- You like that?
- Yes, baby.

380
00:23:34,242 --> 00:23:36,756
Oh, come on. Say it.

381
00:23:41,242 --> 00:23:43,802
Yeah, oh, yeah.

382
00:23:43,962 --> 00:23:45,873
You like it? You like that?

383
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:48,317
Yeah, good.

384
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:54,916
I need to get closer to Hill.

385
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:58,039
<i>Hello, Miles. How are you?
Fine. You? Thanks.</i>

386
00:23:58,202 --> 00:23:59,873
Hello, Miles. How are you?
Fine. You?

387
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,679
Okay, I need to get closer to Hill.

388
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:03,434
Close as you got to Cam last night?

389
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:06,161
It's a little soon to be going
on dates with Grace's ex.

390
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,675
Oh, I'm sorry, your ex.

391
00:24:07,841 --> 00:24:09,240
Are you fucking spying on me now?

392
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,512
<i>No. A friend of mine saw you
two last night.</i>

393
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:13,034
<i>And he said it look ed friendly.</i>

394
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,600
What? You get him by default?

395
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:18,037
Well, not that I owe you or
your friend an explanation.

396
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:20,635
I wanted to see Cam. Somebody
had to tell him about Grace.

397
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,951
Well, I guess we all
grieve differently.

398
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:25,588
You know what, Miles? Forget it.

399
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:27,830
If you don't wanna help me,
Terry wouldn't mind.

400
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:29,513
He's been dying to get
into research.

401
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,320
Oh, Terry couldn't find his ass
with both hands and his ass.

402
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,477
<i>All right, fine, fine, fine.
I'll play nice.</i>

403
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,595
Okay. Good.

404
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,958
While you look around
in cyberspace...

405
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,236
...I need to be looking around
at my new job...

406
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,551
...that you, clever friend,
are going to get me.

407
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,393
Oh, God love you.

408
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,120
Something temporary.
Easy in, easy out. Can you do that?

409
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,748
Does a bear shit in the woods?
H2A's got a blade server...

410
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,832
...that gives more entry points
than a college girl at Mardi Gras.

411
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,434
I'll access the needs list they send
to temp agencies.

412
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,590
Shouldn't be too hard.
There's always openings.

413
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,320
- And, hey, wear something sexy.
- What?

414
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,594
You need to bait the hook.

415
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,754
Just make sure I'm working for Hill.

416
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,911
<i>Yeah, your new name
will be Katherine Pogue.</i>

417
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,718
<i>I choose my own names.</i>

418
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,872
<i>Well, tough. I had a crush on a girl
in high school named Katherine.</i>

419
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,439
<i>It's an homage.</i>

420
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,034
- Going to H2A.
- H2A.

421
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:21,436
<i>Hill's a Jersey native who slipped
and fell into a big pile of money...</i>

422
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,478
<i>- ... when he married- -
- Mia Rheinhart Hill.</i>

423
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:27,870
<i>She's also the daughter of Max
Rheinhart, principal owner of H2A.</i>

424
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,267
- There you go.
- Thank you.

425
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:31,555
Now, if you'll follow me.

426
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:35,838
<i>Hard to separate a man
from his wife's money.</i>

427
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:38,035
<i>Money is the root of all evil, Miles.</i>

428
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:40,671
<i>Check your scriptures.</i>

429
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,558
<i>Love of money is the root of all evil,
Ro.</i>

430
00:25:43,998 --> 00:25:45,352
<i>Love.</i>

431
00:25:46,318 --> 00:25:48,991
We have a new temp.
Her name is Katherine Pogue.

432
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:50,387
- Hi.
- Hi.

433
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,476
Thank you. I'll show you
to your desk.

434
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:54,551
And press 9 to get out,
3 to reach me.

435
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:58,028
I'll be right across from you. You
shouldn't have a problem finding me.

436
00:26:04,158 --> 00:26:06,547
Katherine, we need a coffee setup
in Conference Room A.

437
00:26:06,718 --> 00:26:08,470
- Will I be working for Mr. Hill?
- No.

438
00:26:08,638 --> 00:26:10,913
I'm working for Mr. Hill.
You're working for me.

439
00:26:11,078 --> 00:26:14,787
And you'd better roll up your sleeves.
We are short-staffed this week.

440
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:22,076
Sensational, Harrison. Really.

441
00:26:22,238 --> 00:26:23,512
Spectacular.

442
00:26:23,678 --> 00:26:27,386
I hear you're thinking about opening
in Amsterdam, by the way.

443
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:30,948
- Yes, we did. In April.
- Really?

444
00:26:31,117 --> 00:26:32,106
Excuse me, Mr. Hill.

445
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:35,031
Mr. Kirschenbaum's car is downstairs
and your 2:00 is waiting.

446
00:26:35,197 --> 00:26:37,108
Thanks, Esmeralda.

447
00:26:37,437 --> 00:26:39,668
- I'll walk you out, Jon.
- Great. Thanks.

448
00:26:39,837 --> 00:26:42,988
You're doing well.
I'm very proud of you.

449
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,111
I couldn't have done it without you.
I learned from the best.

450
00:26:46,277 --> 00:26:47,995
- I appreciate it.
- Thanks for coming by.

451
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:50,227
Listen, this is probably
just bullshit...

452
00:26:50,397 --> 00:26:54,514
...but one of my guys heard that a
couple of your execs were in Canton...

453
00:26:54,676 --> 00:26:56,792
...sniffing around
my Reebok account.

454
00:26:56,956 --> 00:26:59,265
If you're sure it's bullshit,
why are you asking me?

455
00:26:59,677 --> 00:27:02,794
Because they heard about it
from inside your agency.

456
00:27:03,476 --> 00:27:06,388
I just don't want you to make that kind
of mistake, Harrison.

457
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:09,310
I've been representing Reebok
for 11 years.

458
00:27:09,476 --> 00:27:10,545
They're my main account.

459
00:27:10,717 --> 00:27:14,868
They're not gonna jump ship for your
smile and some downtown hype.

460
00:27:18,156 --> 00:27:21,785
Eat or be eaten. Right, Jon?

461
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:23,787
Isn't that what you always told me?

462
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:26,231
Now, you left the Reebok account out
on the table.

463
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:30,025
If I didn't pick it up, someone else
was going to and you know that.

464
00:27:30,196 --> 00:27:33,665
Ten years ago you wouldn't have let
this happen. You fumbled the ball.

465
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:36,475
You really are that stupid.

466
00:27:36,636 --> 00:27:39,025
Give my regards to Vanessa.

467
00:27:41,555 --> 00:27:43,114
Esmeralda.

468
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:52,313
We have a leak to
Kirschenbaum and Bond.

469
00:27:52,475 --> 00:27:56,070
I wanna find out who the fuck it is.
Right now.

470
00:27:58,075 --> 00:27:59,667
Hold the door, please.

471
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:05,424
- Wait. Thank you.
- That was close.

472
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:11,512
Harrison, will you be attending
the Victoria's Secret meeting tonight?

473
00:28:11,675 --> 00:28:13,825
I was hoping maybe I could catch
a ride.

474
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:16,224
- Yeah, I think I'll be going.
- Okay.

475
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:40,665
Keep the metre running.

476
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:05,028
We can go now.
74th and Broadway, please.

477
00:29:22,993 --> 00:29:24,631
<i>Rowena.</i>

478
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:29,105
<i>Rowena.</i>

479
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:34,301
<i>Rowena.</i>

480
00:29:36,872 --> 00:29:38,704
<i>Got you.</i>

481
00:29:45,312 --> 00:29:48,384
You know how much
Daddy likes bath time.

482
00:29:59,952 --> 00:30:01,988
We have a Victoria's Secret
party tonight.

483
00:30:02,152 --> 00:30:05,269
- Good morning, Esmeralda.
- Good morning, Katherine.

484
00:30:05,432 --> 00:30:09,106
Two hundred guests,
200 gift bags, too little time.

485
00:30:09,271 --> 00:30:12,628
Five items per bag. Have fun.

486
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:26,629
<i>- Miles, what? I'm at work.
- Well, it wasn't just a drowning.</i>

487
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:28,624
She was poisoned.

488
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:30,986
She had a hole in her gut the size
of a fruit bowl.

489
00:30:31,151 --> 00:30:32,789
Oh, come on.

490
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:35,465
No, that's a direct quote
from the examiner's office.

491
00:30:35,631 --> 00:30:37,587
The killer also put it in her eyes...

492
00:30:38,391 --> 00:30:40,222
<i>... which is weird.</i>

493
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:44,149
Ro, they haven't announced it yet...

494
00:30:44,871 --> 00:30:46,190
...but Grace was pregnant.

495
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,579
<i>She was in her first trimester.</i>

496
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,184
Hello. I'm Gina.

497
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,229
<i>- Ro?
- Katherine Pogue, are you in here?</i>

498
00:30:55,391 --> 00:30:57,427
Oh, there you are.

499
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:01,228
I could tell you Victoria's secret,
but then I'd have to kill you.

500
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,380
- Clever, huh?
- Yeah.

501
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,348
Mr. Hill came up with it for the
"Very Sexy Collection" launch.

502
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,823
Very sexy.

503
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,742
And in a rainbow of colours.

504
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,781
Here, keep a few for the home fires.

505
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,941
I know a pretty girl like you
has a boyfriend.

506
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,225
- No.
- Girlfriend?

507
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,228
- Pets?
- No.

508
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,268
Well, we've got some
local talent here.

509
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:27,503
I'll say. What's up with Hill?
He's interesting.

510
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:29,105
Married.

511
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:32,627
Rumour is, and you didn't hear it
from me...

512
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:36,464
...he had a couple of interoffice flings
a few years back, led to lawsuits.

513
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:39,018
Paid a lot of money
to make them go away.

514
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:42,022
That's when he got his front girl
to run interference.

515
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,508
That would be Josie.

516
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,659
Or, if you get on her bad side,
Cujosie.

517
00:31:47,829 --> 00:31:50,343
She's his gatekeeper.
His walking hard drive.

518
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:53,739
So he never forgets a name,
an account, an enemy.

519
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:56,217
No one gets to him now
without going through her.

520
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:58,505
Let me guess, he's done her too,
right?

521
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:01,058
Oh, no. No.

522
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:04,618
She'd be more interested in you than
in him, if you catch my heavy drift.

523
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:06,701
I think I do.

524
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:09,177
She's his watchdog, not his bitch.

525
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:12,386
- The guy's reformed, unfortunately.
- Right.

526
00:32:12,988 --> 00:32:14,865
His wife's all over him.

527
00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:16,860
She's got eyes in the back
of your head.

528
00:32:17,028 --> 00:32:18,017
Trust me.

529
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:23,501
She finds him cheating,
she and her money are out the door.

530
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:25,067
See Jesse Drake over there?

531
00:32:25,228 --> 00:32:27,981
He had this blond temp last fall
could melt butter.

532
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:30,821
Her name was Veronica.

533
00:32:30,988 --> 00:32:32,899
One day, the boss's wife comes in...

534
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:35,980
...sees Mr. H and Veronica talking
close over the Sparkletts...

535
00:32:36,147 --> 00:32:38,867
...the next day the temp's toast.

536
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:41,097
The boy's been leashed.

537
00:32:41,268 --> 00:32:44,578
But since I have it on good authority
he's into some very kinky shit.

538
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:46,942
He probably likes the tight collar.

539
00:32:48,787 --> 00:32:50,699
I'd let him give me a little spank.

540
00:32:51,587 --> 00:32:54,181
- Did I just say that out loud?
- You're sick.

541
00:33:03,707 --> 00:33:05,106
Sorry.

542
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:07,335
I didn't mean to scare you.

543
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:08,826
Sorry.

544
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:12,139
You're Katherine, right?

545
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:15,185
And you're Harrison Hill, the boss.

546
00:33:15,747 --> 00:33:17,225
Yes.

547
00:33:18,227 --> 00:33:19,739
It's good to be the boss.

548
00:33:20,187 --> 00:33:21,585
Yeah.

549
00:33:22,227 --> 00:33:25,582
So I'll see you at the party tonight,
Katherine.

550
00:33:56,466 --> 00:33:58,184
Here we go.

551
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:09,222
On behalf of Victoria's Secret, I would
like to thank our very special angel...

552
00:34:09,386 --> 00:34:12,900
...Harrison Hill, for making us
sexier than ever.

553
00:34:14,745 --> 00:34:16,178
Harrison.

554
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:22,340
I have no idea how we could
possibly make...

555
00:34:22,505 --> 00:34:24,621
...you look any sexier than you do
tonight, Heidi.

556
00:34:24,785 --> 00:34:26,855
Thank you so very much.

557
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:31,337
I'd just like to raise a glass
to everyone at Victoria's Secret...

558
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:33,894
...and all my people at H2A...

559
00:34:34,064 --> 00:34:35,975
...for making this
a successful campaign...

560
00:34:36,144 --> 00:34:40,660
...a Very Sexy Collection
is H2A's most sexful--

561
00:34:42,064 --> 00:34:44,260
Succsexf--

562
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:48,776
We did really good
with this campaign.

563
00:34:48,944 --> 00:34:51,697
Happy Valentine's Day.
God bless you.

564
00:34:53,184 --> 00:34:54,936
Thank you. Good night.

565
00:34:56,624 --> 00:34:59,661
So is part of the torture the fact
we get to watch all this fun?

566
00:34:59,824 --> 00:35:02,133
Are you kidding me?
We got the best seats in the house.

567
00:35:02,304 --> 00:35:05,659
Okay, see the guy with the bad
combover standing by the statues?

568
00:35:05,823 --> 00:35:07,815
Bob Milstein, Accounting.

569
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:09,622
He may look unlucky in love.

570
00:35:09,783 --> 00:35:12,741
He recently nailed Kay Rolands,
Sales...

571
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:15,338
...the giant standing by the shrimp.

572
00:35:15,904 --> 00:35:19,657
- Corporate America, ain't it grand?
- One big happy family, eh?

573
00:35:19,824 --> 00:35:22,940
Who's the loud-laughing brunette?
The one that looks a little tipsy.

574
00:35:23,103 --> 00:35:27,381
Oh, Bethany Lee, account manager.

575
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:31,013
Long legs, perfect teeth,
may they rot in hell.

576
00:35:32,303 --> 00:35:33,941
A few years back
there was chatter...

577
00:35:34,103 --> 00:35:37,891
...she and Mr. Hill were going over
more than just the company numbers.

578
00:35:38,063 --> 00:35:39,098
- Really?
- Yeah.

579
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:41,981
But that was before the lawsuits,
before Cujosie...

580
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:44,782
...and before the wife
started paying attention.

581
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:48,299
Now it's all hugs and kisses
and they're going to fertility clinics.

582
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:50,215
I think her oven's on the fritz.

583
00:35:51,022 --> 00:35:53,252
Is there anything you don't know,
Gina?

584
00:35:53,423 --> 00:35:54,856
No.

585
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:57,895
I don't get it. Mrs. Hill is pretty.

586
00:35:58,063 --> 00:35:59,654
I mean, she's really pretty.

587
00:35:59,822 --> 00:36:04,577
Show me a beautiful woman, I'll show
you a man who's tired of fucking her.

588
00:36:04,743 --> 00:36:07,496
- Nice, Gina.
- What? I've got brothers.

589
00:36:13,142 --> 00:36:15,019
Hi.

590
00:36:15,182 --> 00:36:16,820
Hey.

591
00:36:19,382 --> 00:36:21,498
You're embarrassing him
and yourself.

592
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:23,732
Okay, I'll be better.

593
00:36:23,902 --> 00:36:27,177
His wife is out there.

594
00:36:27,341 --> 00:36:28,934
I'm sorry.

595
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:30,740
I'm sorry.

596
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:33,098
Here's money for a cab.

597
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:35,260
Come on.

598
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:39,900
- He'll call me, right?
- Good night, Bethany, good night.

599
00:36:54,861 --> 00:36:57,055
I told you already, Narron, I quit.

600
00:36:57,221 --> 00:37:00,133
I figured two weeks was enough
to let you cool off.

601
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,019
I gotta go.

602
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,569
I'm sorry about the senator, Ro,
but I can't lose you.

603
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,619
- David Shane is this paper's star.
- You don't bench a star, Narron.

604
00:37:08,781 --> 00:37:11,614
There will always be powerful people
covering things up, Ro...

605
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,692
...at every paper, in every city.

606
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,055
It's called editorializing
and it's a reality.

607
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,617
Don't give up
because one son of a bitch...

608
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,499
...pulled some strings at the paper
and silenced your source.

609
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,697
Rest up, come back...

610
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,328
...and nail the next son of a bitch.

611
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,859
Maybe.

612
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,057
So I set up your IOL account,
but you're gonna need a name.

613
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,651
How about Rocket?

614
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,129
That was my nickname
from college.

615
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:42,178
Are you sure you don't wanna be
"Hot Bitch on Wheels"?

616
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:48,491
No, I'm kidding.
All right, Rocket, Rocket, "Rocketgirl."

617
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:52,448
A little sexier than
DShane@NYCourier.com.

618
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:54,769
So I put ADEX...

619
00:37:56,379 --> 00:38:00,851
...into your friends file
and as a little extra added bonus...

620
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:04,455
...your computer has a few things
to say. Listen, this is good.

621
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:06,977
<i>Miles is sexy.</i>

622
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:10,532
<i>Miles is sexy.</i>

623
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:13,889
- Translation?
- Let me guess.

624
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,174
Miles is sexy?

625
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:18,648
- You think so?
- And I need this, why?

626
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:20,217
Because it's fucking radical.

627
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:22,687
Every time you get an IM,
you'll have a voice to match.

628
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:25,326
I don't want my computer talking.
I don't want it saying:

629
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:28,013
- "Miles is sexy."
- I'll just give an audio to Hill.

630
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:30,295
I sampled his voice
from some streaming video.

631
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:32,768
- You don't mind if Hill talks?
- Do I have a choice?

632
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:34,530
No.

633
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:40,450
So, what's he like up close
and personal?

634
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:44,577
Well, tell you one thing,
there's more to the guy than you think.

635
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:46,217
You should check out his offices.

636
00:38:46,378 --> 00:38:47,652
Go online, take the tour.

637
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:50,332
You'll see. It's outrageous.

638
00:38:51,298 --> 00:38:54,016
Sick. Just what you'd like.

639
00:38:54,177 --> 00:38:57,932
Oh, you know what, by the way,
I did find something out. Apparently...

640
00:38:58,098 --> 00:39:01,453
...Hill has squashed a couple
of sexual harassment suits.

641
00:39:01,618 --> 00:39:03,653
- Could you chase the money trail?
- Yeah, well...

642
00:39:03,818 --> 00:39:05,808
...I guess he's a likely
candidate for that.

643
00:39:05,978 --> 00:39:07,012
No, not really.

644
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:09,248
He's now got this gorgeous
Amazonian woman...

645
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:12,727
...that does all the dirty work.
- Oh, really? Is she hot?

646
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:14,125
Yes.

647
00:39:14,297 --> 00:39:18,813
She's very hot.
She's also a lesbian.

648
00:39:18,977 --> 00:39:20,615
Bastard.

649
00:39:21,577 --> 00:39:24,375
<i>All right, so seeing
that you're a chat-room virgin... .</i>

650
00:39:24,537 --> 00:39:27,335
- Big deal, I'm a chat-room virgin.
- No, I think it's a compliment.

651
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:30,489
I think you should practise
online flirting.

652
00:39:30,857 --> 00:39:34,372
- Why would I want to do that?
- Because you'll tell a perfect stranger...

653
00:39:34,536 --> 00:39:38,052
...something you won't tell your best
friend. Especially if you're anonymous.

654
00:39:38,217 --> 00:39:40,492
You should know that,
Mr. David Shane.

655
00:39:42,337 --> 00:39:45,090
Oh, by the way, I got a dollar that
says Hill's not our guy.

656
00:39:46,697 --> 00:39:50,291
We got a pregnant Grace,
threatening to go to the wife, right?

657
00:39:50,456 --> 00:39:54,210
- Yeah.
- Okay, but meanwhile, the wife...

658
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:57,527
...is busy trying to haul Hill off
to a fertility clinic.

659
00:39:58,656 --> 00:40:03,093
And let's not forget the most
important part, the wife is the money.

660
00:40:03,256 --> 00:40:04,609
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

661
00:40:04,776 --> 00:40:06,050
That's motive on a big stick.

662
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:08,889
- Motive on a big stick?
- That's what I said.

663
00:40:09,055 --> 00:40:12,048
So I'll take your bet.

664
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:13,807
Game on.

665
00:40:16,616 --> 00:40:18,493
<i>Welcome to chat.</i>

666
00:40:19,495 --> 00:40:21,373
"Trublu?" Okay.

667
00:40:22,976 --> 00:40:24,488
<i>Welcome.</i>

668
00:40:25,015 --> 00:40:26,528
"Haven't seen you around."

669
00:40:27,855 --> 00:40:30,972
New to this. Who are you?

670
00:40:33,495 --> 00:40:36,373
Hello, Neil, I'm Tiffany.

671
00:40:42,455 --> 00:40:45,924
Okay, Trublu, let's go.

672
00:40:46,935 --> 00:40:51,167
How do you imagine me?

673
00:40:51,334 --> 00:40:53,644
"Long blond hair, longer legs--"

674
00:40:53,814 --> 00:40:56,089
Really close.

675
00:40:57,734 --> 00:40:59,167
<i>Welcome.</i>

676
00:40:59,495 --> 00:41:03,407
"When you said you were getting off,
I didn't know you meant literally."

677
00:41:03,575 --> 00:41:06,372
Leave me alone.

678
00:41:10,054 --> 00:41:13,808
I haven't contacted him.

679
00:41:16,454 --> 00:41:18,604
"I did on his--"

680
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:28,923
- Hello.
- Okay, look, this isn't funny.

681
00:41:29,094 --> 00:41:32,210
- You're taking advantage of me.
- This is exactly what we talked about.

682
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:34,126
Once he responds,
I get past his firewall.

683
00:41:34,293 --> 00:41:36,603
It's the price of admission.
I wrote, " Dear Harrison...

684
00:41:36,773 --> 00:41:39,492
...the answers are: Great sex,
cheap beer, the Rolling Stones."

685
00:41:39,653 --> 00:41:41,086
<i>- What?
- Come on.</i>

686
00:41:41,253 --> 00:41:44,370
<i>We got to push his buttons. By the
way, I sent it from your account.</i>

687
00:41:44,534 --> 00:41:46,444
Oh, shit. He's on.

688
00:41:46,614 --> 00:41:48,922
<i>- There he is. Let me drive.
- He's on, Miles, he's on.</i>

689
00:41:49,093 --> 00:41:51,288
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Miles.
- Harrison--

690
00:41:51,453 --> 00:41:53,569
<i>- What are you doing?
- Nice to hear from you.</i>

691
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:56,691
Miles, you're typing for me?

692
00:41:56,853 --> 00:41:58,684
<i>- It's a riddle.
- Miles. Stop it.</i>

693
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:01,048
<i>- Miles, stop it.
- All right, fine. Fine. Fine.</i>

694
00:42:01,213 --> 00:42:03,807
I'm through the firewall into ADEX's
account. He's all yours.

695
00:42:04,613 --> 00:42:07,126
Miles, you bastard.

696
00:42:08,452 --> 00:42:09,886
<i>- What's your name?
- Shit.</i>

697
00:42:17,972 --> 00:42:19,166
Veronica.

698
00:42:20,172 --> 00:42:21,890
<i>What colour is your hair?</i>

699
00:42:22,692 --> 00:42:24,330
Blond.

700
00:42:25,372 --> 00:42:26,361
Dirty.

701
00:42:27,293 --> 00:42:29,408
<i>I lik e dirty.</i>

702
00:42:30,052 --> 00:42:31,644
Filthy.

703
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:34,372
<i>I'd lik e to get a fistful.</i>

704
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:36,241
<i>Are you turned on?</i>

705
00:42:36,452 --> 00:42:38,283
I am.

706
00:42:38,852 --> 00:42:40,409
Fucker.

707
00:42:44,412 --> 00:42:45,400
I should go.

708
00:42:45,572 --> 00:42:47,448
<i>But you just warmed me up.</i>

709
00:42:47,612 --> 00:42:49,522
Yeah. Don't blueball the guy.

710
00:42:49,691 --> 00:42:53,286
"Yeah, Ro. Don't blueball the guy."

711
00:42:56,131 --> 00:42:58,645
<i>- I'll be back. Bye.
- Goodbye.</i>

712
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:04,367
Would you quit spying on me,
you fuck?

713
00:43:04,531 --> 00:43:07,329
You are officially in the way
of how I work and I'm not having it.

714
00:43:07,491 --> 00:43:10,324
- It's Hill. We can prove it now.
- Don't send e-mails on my behalf.

715
00:43:10,491 --> 00:43:12,526
And do not speak for me in any way.

716
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:15,410
How about, "Thank you, Miles,
for your subversive genius"?

717
00:43:15,571 --> 00:43:18,039
Thank you. Bye.

718
00:43:22,051 --> 00:43:24,770
Good morning, H2A.
May I help you?

719
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,003
- Hey, good morning.
- How are you?

720
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,127
Good morning, H2A.

721
00:43:35,651 --> 00:43:37,527
Hello.

722
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,560
"What happened to you last night?"

723
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,404
Morning.

724
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:50,720
"Tiffany? Veronica?"

725
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:51,879
Katherine.

726
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:57,086
You forgot to fill out your l-9.

727
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,164
Okay.

728
00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:02,446
I told Human Resources
I'd run it right back over there...

729
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:03,883
...now.

730
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:07,766
Okay, well, I'll just fill this out.

731
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:11,001
- You looking for permanent work?
- Always.

732
00:44:11,169 --> 00:44:12,284
Where have you temped?

733
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:14,363
I don't know. Got a phone book?

734
00:44:14,529 --> 00:44:15,598
Yes, I do.

735
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:17,882
Okay.

736
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:21,522
Zaffman, Meyer and Pearce, I.P.E. --

737
00:44:21,689 --> 00:44:24,567
- I love the new building.
- Great bathrooms.

738
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:26,606
What about Kirschenbaum
and Bond?

739
00:44:27,729 --> 00:44:29,207
Average bathrooms.

740
00:44:29,368 --> 00:44:30,882
When did you work there?

741
00:44:31,049 --> 00:44:32,801
I don't know, maybe April.

742
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:35,244
I don't know. My life is kind of crazy.

743
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:38,480
One day just runs into the next.

744
00:44:40,128 --> 00:44:41,926
Heineken Amsterdam
is gonna love it.

745
00:44:42,088 --> 00:44:44,727
We should start talking
about print, scheduling, tie-ins.

746
00:44:44,888 --> 00:44:46,561
It can play internationally too.

747
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:50,607
Jesse, why don't you start talking
about media buys with Chuck...

748
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:53,078
...Toni and Steve.
I need a couple minutes.

749
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:55,080
- I'll be right back.
- I'm glad you're happy.

750
00:44:55,248 --> 00:44:56,761
So glad you're happy.

751
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:59,317
When do you think we could roll it
to print?

752
00:45:02,048 --> 00:45:03,163
Here, hold this, please.

753
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:05,398
Esmeralda, hold my calls
for a few minutes.

754
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:08,081
Phelps. Mr. Phelps.

755
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:09,237
Afternoon, boys.

756
00:45:09,408 --> 00:45:12,558
Kindly do me a favour and stand up,
would you? Get out!

757
00:45:12,728 --> 00:45:15,002
Piece of shit?
You're gonna spy on me?

758
00:45:16,008 --> 00:45:18,840
Here, get the fuck up,
you piece of sh--

759
00:45:19,648 --> 00:45:21,080
You were a fucking bike messenger.

760
00:45:21,247 --> 00:45:22,761
I made you rich.

761
00:45:22,927 --> 00:45:26,203
I hope they have a job for you
over at Kirschenbaum.

762
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:30,997
I accept your resignation.

763
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:35,566
Gunnar.

764
00:45:36,287 --> 00:45:39,199
Congratulations.
Now clean up your new office.

765
00:45:40,847 --> 00:45:43,486
Back to work.
What are you guys looking at?

766
00:45:43,647 --> 00:45:46,081
Shit. What just happened?

767
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:48,999
Gunnar Hope just got a promotion.

768
00:45:51,727 --> 00:45:54,446
"Veronica, how did you know
about my ADEX account?"

769
00:45:59,886 --> 00:46:02,639
I used to temp at H2A.

770
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,165
Yeah.

771
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:16,524
My boyfriend wouldn't like that.

772
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:19,845
Shit.

773
00:46:25,726 --> 00:46:27,796
Does this phone call mean
I'm forgiven?

774
00:46:27,966 --> 00:46:30,036
You've got once chance
to redeem yourself.

775
00:46:30,206 --> 00:46:32,083
He wants a photo of Veronica.

776
00:46:32,246 --> 00:46:34,999
- Who?
- Me. Rocketgirl.

777
00:46:35,165 --> 00:46:37,202
<i>- Is nude an option?
- Miles.</i>

778
00:46:37,565 --> 00:46:39,716
There was a temp
that used to work here.

779
00:46:39,885 --> 00:46:41,717
<i>- Veronica something.
- "Veronica something."</i>

780
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:44,319
- You gotta be kidding me.
- She worked for Jesse Drake.

781
00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:46,680
Every employee here
has got a security photo ID.

782
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,722
<i>- She's got to be in the files.
- Oh, come on.</i>

783
00:46:48,885 --> 00:46:50,034
Miles. Do it.

784
00:46:50,205 --> 00:46:53,402
<i>I need this, Miles.
Just do it. Please.</i>

785
00:46:56,444 --> 00:46:59,642
<i>- Hurry up.
- A last name would really help.</i>

786
00:46:59,805 --> 00:47:02,365
Yeah, well, how many Veronicas
can there be in the system?

787
00:47:03,925 --> 00:47:05,482
Come on, Miles.

788
00:47:05,645 --> 00:47:06,998
Hurry.

789
00:47:07,844 --> 00:47:11,474
<i>- Miles.
- This is ridiculous. Come on.</i>

790
00:47:11,644 --> 00:47:14,158
Come on. Come on.

791
00:47:14,324 --> 00:47:17,601
<i>I can see him from here.
Come on, Miles, hurry.</i>

792
00:47:17,764 --> 00:47:19,117
<i>Miles.</i>

793
00:47:19,285 --> 00:47:21,240
Hurry up. Miles.

794
00:47:22,204 --> 00:47:25,321
<i>- Okay.
- Hurry.</i>

795
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:27,634
Come on, come on.

796
00:47:29,404 --> 00:47:30,519
Yahtzee.

797
00:47:31,084 --> 00:47:34,474
Veronica Carter. Just download,
upload, exhale and send.

798
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:36,600
You are awesome.

799
00:47:36,764 --> 00:47:39,153
Yeah, well, remember that
the next time you're firing me.

800
00:47:40,044 --> 00:47:41,159
Oh, Ro...

801
00:47:41,323 --> 00:47:43,792
...I'm meeting my guy
from the M.E.'s office, Bill Patel...

802
00:47:43,963 --> 00:47:45,079
...at Chumley's at 7:00.

803
00:47:45,244 --> 00:47:47,519
He's got the talks on Grace,
everything the cops have.

804
00:47:47,683 --> 00:47:49,993
Great. I'll meet you there.

805
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:54,192
<i>- Shit.
- What?</i>

806
00:47:54,363 --> 00:47:57,161
My computer screen is frozen.
And Veronica's face is screen saver.

807
00:47:57,323 --> 00:47:58,722
What?

808
00:47:58,883 --> 00:48:00,236
<i>- Miles.
- Turn it off.</i>

809
00:48:00,404 --> 00:48:01,882
<i>- Oh, fuck.
- Turn it off.</i>

810
00:48:02,043 --> 00:48:03,635
<i>Turn the power off.</i>

811
00:48:04,604 --> 00:48:06,036
Fuck, he's coming.

812
00:48:07,003 --> 00:48:09,153
- Hi.
- Hi.

813
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:11,753
- Pretty busy for the end of the day.
- Yeah.

814
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:12,912
Just working away.

815
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:14,755
Anything I can help with?

816
00:48:15,762 --> 00:48:17,082
Nope.

817
00:48:17,642 --> 00:48:20,076
Not unless data entry turns you on.

818
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:23,600
You know what?
Surprisingly, it doesn't.

819
00:48:23,763 --> 00:48:25,242
But seriously, how you doing?

820
00:48:26,442 --> 00:48:28,434
Let me tell you about my night.

821
00:48:29,963 --> 00:48:33,875
I have to go to dinner at Sapa.
Average jokes, exceptional food.

822
00:48:34,523 --> 00:48:37,559
If you find yourself bored...

823
00:48:37,722 --> 00:48:42,477
...in the area of 24th and Sixth
around 10:00...

824
00:48:42,642 --> 00:48:45,236
...you could fall by for a drink.

825
00:48:46,362 --> 00:48:50,514
I really appreciate that offer,
but I think I'm gonna have to pass.

826
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:52,429
Okay.

827
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,426
Is there something else I can do
for you, or--?

828
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:00,942
No.

829
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:03,425
I'm just waiting for you to change
your mind.

830
00:49:06,149 --> 00:49:07,900
Look, Mr. Hill--

831
00:49:08,068 --> 00:49:11,538
I recognise that tone.
Sounds serious.

832
00:49:12,868 --> 00:49:14,425
I really like working here.

833
00:49:14,587 --> 00:49:18,865
And I would really like for my work
to speak for itself.

834
00:49:20,026 --> 00:49:21,505
Fair enough.

835
00:49:23,146 --> 00:49:25,376
Have a splendid evening,
Miss Pogue.

836
00:49:29,225 --> 00:49:31,455
Wait. Mr. Hill?

837
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:36,343
In case I change my mind...

838
00:49:37,864 --> 00:49:40,377
...keep an eye out around dessert.

839
00:49:43,463 --> 00:49:45,657
Hey, how you guys doing?

840
00:49:45,822 --> 00:49:49,178
- Miles.
- Bill Patel, Rowena Price.

841
00:49:49,342 --> 00:49:51,093
- A pleasure.
- You can lose the glasses.

842
00:49:51,261 --> 00:49:53,138
This isn't Deep Throat.

843
00:49:53,781 --> 00:49:55,851
Here's your pina colada,
hold the umbrella.

844
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,258
We know about the drowning, Bill,
but what was this poison?

845
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,648
Belladonna.
