1
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,561
All right! Let's do it!

2
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,502
- Hey, what's going on, man?
- I got that stuff, man.

3
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,838
Here, kitty, kitty. Hey, you guys.

4
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,592
Hey, Buford. Hey, Milady.
Come on. Come on.

5
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:37,304
I've got breakfast for you. Come over here.
Come on, come on. Come on.

6
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,348
Come on. Here, kitty, kitty.

7
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,184
Agnes! Agnes, come on.

8
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:59,409
Hey, Buford. Buford, look, look.
Look what I've got you for breakfast.

9
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,342
Help! Help me!

10
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,220
Get over here.

11
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,226
Nothing personal, buddy.

12
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,071
You've got to be sick of those
tired, two-month relationships.

13
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,407
Problem is, you're not meeting
the right kind of woman.

14
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,201
A woman who'll run with the wolves,

15
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,829
somebody who'll at least
keep you interested.

16
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,123
- Run with the wolves?
- Yeah.

17
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,625
Man, I've told you about watching
too much of that Oprah shit.

18
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,462
Come on, Pete.
A little excitement is not gonna kill you.

19
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:56,508
Terry, I like the women nice, quiet and dull.

20
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,510
You know what I'm saying?
Not like that Mongolian feminist

21
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,554
that you set me up with.

22
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:05,601
Okay, wait a minute. All right, who is it?

23
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,021
- Who is who?
- Who is she?

24
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,397
- What?
- Come on, come on, you know.

25
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,191
Every time we start talking about
my sex life,

26
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,860
it comes down to your wife trying
to set me up with somebody.

27
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,029
- So, who is she?
- Hold on, hold on, hold on...

28
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,656
- This is your brother talking, G.
- Who is she, man?

29
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,409
What? She, like, cook breakfast
with her toes or something?

30
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,329
- What? I got to wheel her around or...
- All right, all right, all right.

31
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,207
- Her name is Shanandra.
- Gesundheit.

32
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,126
No, no, come on, dude.
Her name is Shanandra, G.

33
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,754
What the hell is a Shanandra?

34
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,048
I don't know, but she's bad, I'll tell you that.

35
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,509
I am too old to be dating a Shanandra.
Something like...

36
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,553
Something that comes out your nose
or something.

37
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,138
Trust me on this one, G.

38
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,146
Keep it up.

39
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,483
Got a job to do here.

40
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,737
Hey, Terry and Pete Nessip,
United States Marshals.

41
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,906
May I have your ID, please?

42
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,909
Okay, sir. Sign right here, please.

43
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,789
Shanandra, sounds like a nightclub.

44
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,582
Gordon Maples,
United States Attorney's Office.

45
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,627
- Pete Nessip. This is my brother Terry.
- Pete, Terry.

46
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:17,256
Remember when the DEA started
electronically confiscating drug money

47
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,675
- from all the banks?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

48
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,428
Dealers started to wake up in the morning
to find all their money gone.

49
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,015
So, this guy Leedy was the big
computer wonk for the Chang Triad.

50
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,601
He figured out how to hide their money
so we couldn't find it.

51
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,813
You mean that guy in there,
coughing up furballs, is a genius?

52
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:36,275
He breaks codes that can't be broken.
It's like he lived inside the computers.

53
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:40,279
- How did he get caught?
- His ego. He felt unappreciated,

54
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,907
so I cut him a deal to testify and kept him
out of sight for the last year and a half.

55
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,326
Now, two weeks from trial, they found him.

56
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,079
I need you guys to move Mr. Leedy
up to the pen in Atlanta

57
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,540
so I can keep him alive
long enough to testify.

58
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,043
What about the cats?
We don't have to take the cats, too, do we?

59
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,550
welcome to Pac-Atlantic flight 611
to Atlanta

60
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,927
with continuing service to Seattle.

61
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,888
Please make sure that all carry-on baggage
is securely stowed...

62
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,015
Whoops!

63
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,435
It's okay.
That's what I'm here for, cat protection.

64
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,230
Cat protection. Smooth, real smooth.

65
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,942
Okay, tight enough.
Are you sure you've fed the cats enough?

66
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,778
Agnes, she's got a little bit of a problem
with low blood sugar.

67
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,573
Leedy, the cats will be better fed
than we will on this plane.

68
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,491
You're not just saying that
to make me feel better, are you?

69
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,286
- Now, why would I do that?
- What about the... How can we make sure

70
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,580
they can maintain the temperature
in the baggage compartment?

71
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,375
What if they freeze?
I gotta get down and see the cats. I want...

72
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,835
- Chill, man.
- What if they freeze?

73
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,961
Hey, excuse me.

74
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,172
- Would you like an aisle seat?
- That would be great.

75
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,966
Why are we not in first class?
We should be in first class.

76
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,634
The pleasure's all mine.

77
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,473
43 A and B. This is going to be great.

78
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,104
I'm warning you. If anything happens
to those cats, I'm gonna sue you.

79
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,522
You owe me, G.

80
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:02,027
You've ever heard of punitive damages,
Mr. US Marshal?

81
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,780
We should be in first class, anyway.

82
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,448
- Miss, excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

83
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:10,744
I'm afraid to fly. I need some water
to take a sedative.

84
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,456
- Okay, no problem. I'll be right with you.
- Doctor... Okay, thanks.

85
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,243
we're getting some heavy weather, folks.

86
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:55,664
So I've got permission to climb to 38,000,
see if we can get above it.

87
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,958
Bob, I think you'd better listen to this.

88
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:03,463
Pac-Air 611 Bravo, this is Miami Approach.
we just received a code-red transmission.

89
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,427
Would you care for some wine?

90
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,097
Thanks, but I only drink wine
by candlelight.

91
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:16,685
Well, I might be able to help you with that.
Would you like to follow me?

92
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,862
Give me a break.

93
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,993
The captain needs to see you
on the flight deck, right away.

94
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,369
Yeah.

95
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,419
- Gentlemen
- We just received this.

96
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:47,007
Flight 611, you are about to be taken over
by Posse Comitus.

97
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,341
- Stay on your flight plan.
- Oh, brother.

98
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,634
No one will be hurt.

99
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,554
You'll receive further instructions
in five minutes. Over.

100
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,489
Hands up!

101
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,075
Okay! Turn around, keep your head down.

102
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,953
I said keep your heads down!

103
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,125
Sit down.

104
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,968
Nobody move, God damn it. If you do,
I'll blow this plane to hell. You understand?

105
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,762
Get off the phone.

106
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,181
You, too, God damn it.

107
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,682
Get down!

108
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,561
Get your heads down. Feet on the floor.
Hands out of pockets.

109
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,772
You're not listening.

110
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,274
Both of you!

111
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,820
- Leedy, come with me.
- No, no, no! No, don't do this. No, please!

112
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,989
Please don't.

113
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,243
- How much time?
- Ten seconds.

114
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,786
Wait for now.

115
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,672
No, leave my hand. No, that's my finger!

116
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,717
Jesus!

117
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:17,639
Be good now. Be good boys and girls.
If you're not, I'll blow the plane up.

118
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,061
- what happened?
- Number 1 is down!

119
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,981
Talk to me! Talk to me, Number 1.

120
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,156
I'm bulletproof. what are you? Hey!

121
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,702
Help! Now!

122
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,382
- What the hell?
- Shit! We're losing cabin pressure.

123
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:57,721
Mayday! Mayday! This is Flight 611.
611 Heavy. Declaring an emergency.

124
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,223
- We have emergency decompression.
...two and four.

125
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,142
We're over Ocala, in Florida. We're...

126
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,167
Go! Go!

127
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:51,024
I've got you. Hang on. Okay, hold on to me.
Hold on. Okay.

128
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,402
Okay, hold on. I've got you.

129
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,988
Grab her. Hold her.

130
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:01,242
- Lena, hold on. Hold on! I've got her.
- Okay. Okay.

131
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,670
Terry, hang on. Hold on!

132
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,797
Help me!

133
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,965
Hang on, Terry.

134
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,592
- Help!
- Hold on.

135
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,511
I've got you. Hold on.

136
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,930
Terry, you've gotta hold on!

137
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,848
I'm slipping!

138
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,142
- Terry!
- I won't let go of you!

139
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,313
- Hang on to me!
- No! Don't...

140
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:35,819
Terry! No!

141
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,238
No, Terry! No.

142
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,657
- Glenn Blackstone, agent in charge, FBI.
- Bob Covington.

143
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:27,245
Tom McCracken, US Marshal's Office.
Listen, I'm looking for my guy, Pete Nessip.

144
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,831
- Supposed to...
- Pete's over there.

145
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:37,589
Pete. Pete, did you see anything?

146
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,346
Two, three, maybe more.

147
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,727
You didn't hear anything?
Their names or anything?

148
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,067
The little girl, I reached for her
and I grabbed her.

149
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,195
And...

150
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,495
They shot Terry. Motherfuckers.

151
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,959
He was bad. He was real bad.
The blood was everywhere and I...

152
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,004
He was falling. I grabbed him and I had him.

153
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,840
- I couldn't hold him.
- Oh, my God.

154
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,719
I couldn't hold him.

155
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,933
Bring up the passenger list
and seating assignment.

156
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,232
Okay, break down the ticket purchase
into cash and credit card.

157
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:41,444
Cross-check that with advance purchase
and same-day purchase.

158
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,539
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

159
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,667
- It's some kind of virus or worm, sir.
- Well, get it back.

160
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,878
I'm trying,
but the whole system's going down.

161
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,556
- It's Leedy...
- What?

162
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,307
- It was a setup.
- A what?

163
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,184
- A setup.
- What are you saying, Nessip?

164
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,020
- A prison break at 30,000 feet?
- Yeah, why not?

165
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,481
So, what did they do? Come down
and pick him up in a goddamn spaceship?

166
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,401
Look, I tackled one of the guys.
He had some sort of pack on his back.

167
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,278
- Maybe it was a parachute.
- What about Leedy, now?

168
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,197
He jumps out, opens up an umbrella
and floats down like Mary Poppins?

169
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,700
- Nobody saw a parachute.
- Nobody could see anything.

170
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,577
Their heads were down
and the plane was filled with smoke.

171
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:35,039
What 32 people did see was they saw your
brother fire at a man wrapped in explosives.

172
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:39,294
That's a lie! Wait a minute, what is this?
The FBI get brownie points for speed?

173
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,297
We're talking about my brother here, man.

174
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,340
Look, isn't that worth the investigation?

175
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,217
- You want an investigation?
- Yes!

176
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,720
Two hours after the explosion,
an airline maintenance man

177
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,514
was gunned down at Miami airport
running away from MPD detention.

178
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,725
And in his apartment they found
Posse Comitus literature

179
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,268
and homemade C-4 explosives.

180
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,186
The maintenance man
put the explosives on board?

181
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,898
That's right. Detective Fox, Miami PD,
recognized the man

182
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,190
from the pre-flight inspection.

183
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,734
I'm telling you...

184
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:07,488
Look, we all feel bad
about what happened to your brother,

185
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,491
and don't nobody want to paint him
the fall guy. But the fact of the matter is

186
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,120
your brother opened fire on that plane
and panicked, and 14 people are dead.

187
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,747
My brother didn't panic.

188
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:20,585
Sir, Forensics just got a positive ID
on one of the remains found on the plane.

189
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,754
Your prisoner, Leedy.

190
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,674
Damn!

191
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,977
Through the coordinated investigation
of federal, state

192
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,021
and local law enforcement officials,

193
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,941
the FBI believes that it has answered
most of the questions

194
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:47,028
concerning the attempted hijack
of Pac-Atlantic Air Flight 611.

195
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:52,450
It was the Marshal on board
who set off the explosion. Is that true?

196
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,954
That question has been raised
and is under investigation...

197
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,631
Hey, guys!

198
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,050
Guys, check it out!

199
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,471
- They're buying it top to bottom.
- Of course they're buying it.

200
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,098
Baby doll, you talk about a rush, man.

201
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,809
We went out that fucking door, that
wind hit you like a goddamn freight train.

202
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,310
I'm dragging away from the jet,

203
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:23,481
I come face to face with this woman, and
I swear, she was still holding a magazine.

204
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,691
Has Leedy finished throwing up?

205
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,067
- Yes.
- Good.

206
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,990
No, no, no, don't touch my hand, lady!
Don't! No! Don't touch my hand!

207
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,908
- Watch out! Don't touch my hand!
- Earl, come here!

208
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,827
Don't touch my hand!

209
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,787
Shut up and say thank you.

210
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,955
- Thank you?
- Yes!

211
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,125
You threw me out of an airplane
and you bit off my finger.

212
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,170
- You have nine good ones.
- Well, how am I supposed to do my work?

213
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,882
You crashed the entire airline computer
system with one hand, didn't you?

214
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,801
The information we have is
sketchy right now,

215
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:55,179
but what we're hearing is that the Marshal
allegedly fired at a hijacker,

216
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,140
and according to passengers,
set off the explosion

217
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,309
which killed 14 people,
including the hijackers.

218
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,524
Yes! Unload the boat. Unload the boat.

219
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,152
...and a federal prisoner
by the name of Earl Leedy.

220
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:14,574
Wait, wait, wait, wait, they think I'm dead.
Does that mean I'm free?

221
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:18,578
You're not free. Your ass belongs to me.
And I'm gonna make it worth your while.

222
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,371
But wait, he mentioned only two Marshals.

223
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,789
What about the other Marshal
that was on the plane?

224
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,957
He's dead. He's dead. I shot him.

225
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,417
I don't think so. He was in the bathroom.

226
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,919
Listen to me! All he saw was smoke.

227
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,339
We got out clean, except for that bitch
that grabbed you, Jagger.

228
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,551
Next time, you just get her
and throw her out the door.

229
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,887
I'll buy you breakfast.
Come on, let's go. Breakfast.

230
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,599
- What you got, Deuce?
- I got homemade grits and eggs.

231
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,585
How are you doing, Pete?
I need to talk to you. It's important.

232
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,045
So is this.

233
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,089
Wait till you see what I found.

234
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,883
I got it nailed down
to a two-square-mile radius

235
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,760
where the hijackers could've landed.

236
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,261
We've got our bodies, Pete.

237
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,098
Yeah, but the only bodies we've got
that are burned beyond recognition

238
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,433
are those of the terrorists
and that prick Leedy.

239
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,810
Does that make any sense?

240
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:29,482
Pete, nobody jumps from a 747
at that altitude and speed and lives.

241
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,818
- Period. You understand that?
- No, no, no, that's where you're wrong.

242
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,988
Look, a SEAL team did it.
Jumped out of a 727 three years ago.

243
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,449
I'm telling you, it's a setup.

244
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,411
Now all I have to do is figure out
how Leedy fits into all this.

245
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,122
What?

246
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,707
The Board of Review is looking at this
in two weeks...

247
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,209
The Board of Review!

248
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,087
...to determine yours and Terry's
responsibility for the accident.

249
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,422
- What responsibility?
- Pete, listen to me.

250
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,301
The FAA and the airline's in the middle
of a goddamn firestorm with the media,

251
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,554
the insurance companies,
relatives of dead passengers...

252
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:04,767
Nobody wants to hear about skydiving.
Skydiving from 747s!

253
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,353
They're looking to point fingers
at somebody,

254
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,731
and you and Terry are it.
Don't you understand that?

255
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,780
You know the SOP on this. I have
to ask you for your badge and your gun.

256
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,700
- What? You're suspending me?
- Pete, please, you know the rules.

257
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,578
Give me your badge and your gun, please.

258
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,261
I don't care. I'm not quitting on this.

259
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,811
I took a team out in a commercial jet.

260
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,439
Delta Squad deployment,
hostage-drill scenario.

261
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:56,527
- So it can be done?
- We did it. But it was a 727 at 20,000 feet.

262
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,946
And it was a drill, no explosions.

263
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,033
A 747 at 38,000 feet, I doubt it.

264
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,242
Plus, you got another problem.

265
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,286
- Petty Officer.
- Yes, sir.

266
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,957
You see this? You see this D-ring?
High-density metal.

267
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,792
Now, your terrorists may have had

268
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,711
somebody stash a few guns behind a seat,

269
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,005
but not five parachute rigs.

270
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,341
Five rigs going through X-ray
and metal detectors

271
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,968
would raise holy hell with airport security.

272
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,428
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

273
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,931
So, with the right equipment, it is possible.

274
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,142
Mister, to even think about jumping
from a 747

275
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,561
you've either got to be very skilled
or dick-brained.

276
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,105
- Now, which one do you wanna talk to?
- What do you mean?

277
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,151
Well, skilled is a guy named Don Jagger.
World-champion skydiver.

278
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,905
Dick-brained is his old partner,
Jess Crossman.

279
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,073
Where can I find them?

280
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:46,369
I don't think they jump together anymore,
but Crossman lives real close to here.

281
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,565
- Jess Crossman?
- Not today, man.

282
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,779
- Do you know where I can find him?
- You must be with the class.

283
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:22,947
Check upstairs.

284
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,241
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem, dude.

285
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,587
Be right out.

286
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,591
Damn!

287
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,427
- What was that?
- Can you believe that?

288
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,597
Now you listen here to me.

289
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,349
I hope you're good at fixing toilets,

290
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,517
because you're never, ever gonna fix
another plane of mine.

291
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,519
I got my new chute in.
You want to take me up later?

292
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,357
I'll take your face off
if you don't come and fix this plane right.

293
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,860
Where did you learn how to fix planes?
Mr. Goodwrench?

294
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,698
This isn't a waiting room,
and the next load is booked.

295
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,951
Damn. And I really wanted
to get on that plane.

296
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,246
DEA, FBI or local?

297
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,124
Jess Crossman.

298
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,795
If you want to talk to me,
you're either a skydiver or a cop.

299
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:05,716
And, well, you definitely don't look
like any skydiver I have ever seen.

300
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,721
You know, cops, I don't like them.

301
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:15,684
Every time you've met one
has been right after you've broken the law.

302
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,936
Yeah.

303
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,152
Did I go out of state
without calling my parole officer?

304
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,030
Yes, I admit it. But it was an emergency.

305
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,116
You're not here about a parole violation?

306
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,576
Have you heard about a hijacking of a 747?

307
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,913
Yeah. Hear about it, how could I miss it?
What a major screwup!

308
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,082
What if it wasn't a screwup?

309
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,251
What if someone just wanted
to make it look that way?

310
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,129
- Why?
- To grab a prisoner I was escorting.

311
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,880
A jump.

312
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,510
A jailbreak from a 747? That's a cool idea.

313
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,554
No offense.

314
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,098
- Could you do it?
- What, am I a suspect?

315
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,683
Why do you ask?

316
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,562
Well, because people probably told you

317
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,315
that Jessie Crossman was the only person
skilled enough to jump from a 747.

318
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,527
Well, the actual phrase used
was "dick-brained."

319
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,448
And I checked.
You were with your parole officer.

320
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,951
Look, some yahoo pulled
a John Wayne on that flight

321
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,619
and got a lot of people killed, all right?

322
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:19,415
That's not what happened, Ms. Crossman.
And that yahoo was my brother.

323
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,709
Well, God. I'm sorry about that.

324
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:26,547
But if I'm not a suspect,
then I don't have to talk to you, do I?

325
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,176
You still haven't answered the question
about the jump.

326
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,262
See, the longer I stand here,
the broker I get. So...

327
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,388
You want to talk to me about jumping,

328
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,225
you can pay like everyone else,
right, Mr. Cop?

329
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,894
We'll see.

330
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,110
What do I need this getup for
if I don't have a chute?

331
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,613
It's my drop zone, it's my rules.

332
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,532
Wait a minute, now.
You're not scared, are you?

333
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,701
No.

334
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:04,585
Hey, wait! Hold on! Wait for me!

335
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,775
All right, give me a controlled exit
and a good arch.

336
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,486
Ready, set, go!

337
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,118
I don't get the attraction.

338
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,412
You know, haven't you ever watched
a bird gliding on the wind

339
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,374
- and wished you could do it?
- Yeah, for about 20 seconds.

340
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,708
You know, you just don't get it, do you?

341
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,294
What could be so difficult
about jumping out of an airplane?

342
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,214
You count to 20,
you pull the damn string and that's it.

343
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,550
Let the air sculpt your body position,
all right?

344
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,093
Ready, set, go!

345
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,430
- Yes!
- Jesus...

346
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,724
Can you see the way the wind forces the...

347
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:05,229
Come here. Can you see the way
the wind forces their bodies open?

348
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,897
We're only at 80 knots.

349
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,568
A 747 at 500 knots would
rip a jumper clean apart.

350
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,737
And that, my friend,
is where the skill comes in.

351
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,281
No big deal.

352
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,994
You are way out of your league
up here, cowboy. Way out.

353
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,954
I hear you talking all this stuff about skill.

354
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:25,124
If you're so good, how come you're still
working in this shithole?

355
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,250
What?

356
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,795
What, you need to be hooked on phonics?
Shit hole. Shithole.

357
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:30,963
Hey!

358
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,346
He paid for one jump,
I might as well give him one.

359
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,265
For Christ's sake,
just go get him, okay?

360
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,558
All right.

361
00:26:55,905 --> 00:27:07,875
Help!

362
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,020
Get off of me! Get off of me. You kicked me.

363
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:32,149
Wait! Come back! Come back! Come back!

364
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,823
- Help me!
- I've got you.

365
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,832
You're crazy!

366
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,186
- Hold still.
- Get me out of this.

367
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,896
I thought you did okay.

368
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,274
Welcome to the sky!
You fell, you lived, good start.

369
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:21,699
Now you fell, you lived, I'm gone.

370
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,285
You're out of your damn mind.

371
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,664
There are things in here.

372
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,256
Hey!

373
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:41,051
Hey, I didn't know she was going
to do that, okay?

374
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,720
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah?
I bet it was a whole lot safer

375
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,056
than landing with you
in that damn plane of yours.

376
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,600
Where can I find Don Jagger?

377
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,519
There's a big jump this weekend
at Ocean Reef.

378
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,646
All the hot ones will be there.
That's your best bet, man.

379
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,939
Thank you.

380
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,024
Skydivers are a real tight group.

381
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,152
You're gonna have a tough time
breaking in by yourself.

382
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,612
Well, I'll take my chances,
thank you very much.

383
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,198
Hey, you know,
Jess didn't mean anything by that.

384
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,368
Ever since Jagger went south on her
she's been a little touchy.

385
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,328
What happened to Jagger?

386
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,290
He says he got conned
into making some drug jumps.

387
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,250
He did a little time. She did a little time, too.

388
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,794
- They never patched things up.
- Why would she want to?

389
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:19,423
She's loyal. I'd give her that much.
What do you think?

390
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,925
I think it's time for you to zip it.

391
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:26,346
And let's go on and get that rammerjammy
fixed on the tail, all right?

392
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,932
- Nice jump, man.
- Yeah, right!

393
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:40,527
Shit!

394
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,031
I'll kill you.

395
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,207
Please, don't push me.

396
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,712
Don't let me... Wait. No, wait. No!

397
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,504
- Nice landing.
- Good. Good.

398
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,423
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

399
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,760
Come on, come on, come on...

400
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,762
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

401
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,975
- I can't. I can't.
- Hit it, brother. Hit it, brother. Hit it.

402
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,103
- I can't, I'm sorry...
- Leedy, do your job.

403
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,022
I need a minute to steady myself.

404
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,025
When we break in, we don't have minutes,
we have seconds.

405
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,611
- It's the jump. Don't... It's the jump.
- Now, do it.

406
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,572
- I can't think.
- Jump him until he can.

407
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,491
Maybe he's had enough
for one day, all right?

408
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,743
I haven't had enough for one day.
Jump him till he can, come on.

409
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,912
- Please. I can't think.
- Come on. Up and at 'em.

410
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,456
- Go! Come on! Let's go.
- Let's go. Up and at 'em.

411
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,541
Come on, let's go.

412
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,252
- I don't want to jump anymore!
- Come on, go!

413
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,263
This is going to be a snap.

414
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,518
God, this is easy.

415
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,814
They're not going to know what hit them.

416
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,416
- Hi, Joy Willins.
- I'm Pete.

417
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,335
- Pete. Yeah.
- It's a pleasure.

418
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:06,173
Miami Police. They've been really great.
Come on, Lena's around back.

419
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,301
Look what I've got for you.

420
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,428
Thank you.

421
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,180
That's to replace the one
that you lost on the plane.

422
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,766
Maybe it'll make you feel a little better.

423
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,435
Lena, do you remember me?

424
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,229
Remember that your tiger bumped me
upside the head

425
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,398
when we were on the plane?

426
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,651
Do you remember anything
about your plane trip?

427
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,111
Maybe that there was something
strange happening,

428
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,531
there was noise, yelling?

429
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:37,537
No, I fell asleep and when I woke up
we were already landed.

430
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:42,876
I'm going to show you some pictures and
I want you to look at them very carefully.

431
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,545
This is the plane that we were on.

432
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,131
Remember? Remember the plane?

433
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,593
And then something went wrong.
Something happened.

434
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:55,430
There was a loud noise.
There was a lot of smoke.

435
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,684
- A big noise?
- A big noise.

436
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:02,020
There was a lot of wind and
people were yelling and screaming.

437
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,232
Do you remember if you saw anyone?

438
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,903
Help me!

439
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,781
- What are you doing?
- Do you remember anything about

440
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:16,076
what he may have been wearing or... What?

441
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,538
He wore glasses?

442
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,415
He...

443
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,004
The scar. He had a scar?

444
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,716
Lena, was this the man
that you saw on the plane?

445
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,634
You can tell me, nobody's gonna hurt you.

446
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,344
Look, see, he has a scar.

447
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,431
Is this the man?

448
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,683
All right, okay. Look, look.
That's enough, okay?

449
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,518
- That's enough. Could you please go now?
- See, he has a scar.

450
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,895
- Was this the man you saw?
- Let's end it. I'm gonna get the detectives.

451
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,065
- You can answer, it's okay.
- Detective Wallace!

452
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,360
- That's all right. Thank you. Thank you.
- Please.

453
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,822
- Thank you, Lena. I'm sorry.
- Come on, it's all right. That's all right.

454
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,240
Yes!

455
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,456
Detective Fox, Miami Metro.

456
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,625
Concerning that plane accident
you're investigating.

457
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,212
The other US Marshal on the plane
has acquired some information.

458
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,506
- The other Marshal?
- That's correct.

459
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:16,386
The young lady on the plane, she gave him
a partial ID of one of the hijackers.

460
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,306
A scar under his right eye.

461
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,101
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you.

462
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,979
Not with you, with the other Marshal.

463
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,649
Hang on, I wanna come with you.

464
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,135
- Hey, Don.
- Hey.

465
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,350
You're mine now. Where I go, you go.

466
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,727
Let me go or lose me forever.

467
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,896
I'm serious.

468
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,483
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

469
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,572
Hey. Ty, what are you doing?

470
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,701
Hey, hey, let me go.

471
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,329
What are you doing? Let me go!

472
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,665
Hey! Hey! Damn it!

473
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:32,379
Hey, God damn it! Let me go! Let me go!

474
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,967
You son of a bitch!

475
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,636
It's all over. Bye-bye.

476
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,680
No!

477
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,909
Cool move, papa.

478
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,953
You see that?
9-1-1 is not gonna work for him.

479
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,289
What you just saw there
can happen to any one of you.

480
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:11,459
Our skydiving team is now four strong.
No problems with that.

481
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,322
Oh, God.
Did you ever jump those round chutes?

482
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,823
You can't steer the damn things

483
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,201
and you never know
where they're gonna come down.

484
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:48,622
I got enough branches up my ass
to start a pulpwood mill.

485
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:56,755
Hi. I'd like... I don't know, maybe...

486
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,633
A minute to wait for you to come back.

487
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,843
- Look at this guy.
- What's he doing at our table?

488
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,846
I don't think he gets it.
Let's explain it to him.

489
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,348
Yeah.

490
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,849
Here it goes.

491
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,936
This is going to get messy.

492
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,901
Hey, guys, I'm sitting in your seats?
Oh, I'm sorry.

493
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,111
- Can I offer you a beer?
- Sure.

494
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,613
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

495
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,033
Hey, hey, come on, man.

496
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:28,453
If you wanted me to move,
you just should have asked.

497
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,545
Jesus! Take it.

498
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:45,011
Get these guys a beer. Get him a pillow.

499
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,557
- Nessip.
- Bob.

500
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:54,145
Nice to meet you, Bob. See you up there.

501
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,942
Well, I see you've met some skydivers.

502
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,486
You're not much of a cop,
but you sure do make friends easy.

503
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,738
If you blow my cover, I'm gonna bust
your ass right back to prison.

504
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,198
Do you understand me?

505
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,410
Looks like you're doing a good job
of blowing your own cover.

506
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,913
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Last time I did that, I got into a fight.

507
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,624
Look, buddy, at the moment
we're the only cover you've got.

508
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,167
Have a seat.

509
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:23,466
Look, all I want to do
is talk to your friend Jagger.

510
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,760
Okay, then here's what I want.

511
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,596
There's a big exhibition jump
in DC next weekend.

512
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,974
I want to go,
but my parole officer won't let me.

513
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,144
- Keep talking.
- Well, see, you got a big problem here.

514
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,896
The only way you're gonna learn
anything is if you hang out with the best.

515
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:41,568
And right now, you're kind of sticking out
like a Cub Scout in a whorehouse.

516
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,031
Bad news, man,
you're not gonna believe what happened.

517
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,617
I reach your parole officer
and you work me in with these guys, right?

518
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,911
And another thing...

519
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,166
Burn in. Drinks up!

520
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,209
Blue skies!

521
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,337
- Black death!
- Black death!

522
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,631
What the hell is that?

523
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,885
It means some skydiver somewhere
burned in today.

524
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:12,057
- What does that mean?
- As in, crash landed. Dead.

525
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:17,520
They're gonna ring that bell and
raise a toast every hour till midnight.

526
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,273
- Great tradition.
- Who hammered in?

527
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,567
Jagger.

528
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,153
Damn!

529
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,572
The cops found him with a fat sack
of cocaine on him.

530
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,283
He was stuck up in some power lines.

531
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,786
Power lines?

532
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,706
What, he just floated
into the power lines, Sel?

533
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,292
It's just what I heard. I'm sorry.

534
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:47,175
- No, that's not possible.
- Jessie, I'm sorry. Where are you going?

535
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:52,180
If you want my help,
you pay for me and the airplane.

536
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,765
- Okay, how much?
- $15,000.

537
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,934
- $15,000?
- That's what it costs.

538
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,061
What do you care, anyway?
It's the government's money.

539
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,897
I don't work for the government anymore.

540
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,942
I'll talk to you later.

541
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,987
What's up, man?

542
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:39,436
- Good news. Good news, Mr. Moncrief.
- What's that?

543
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,564
Our client has found your offer
quite interesting.

544
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,774
We're all just a little concerned
about the fact

545
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,943
that you used to be an agent for the DEA.

546
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:50,071
Used to be. Used to be is why
I'm worth something to you.

547
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:54,617
Right, right, well your past
leaves a bad taste in our client's mouth.

548
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,203
You have to do better than that.

549
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,748
If the taste was bad, gentlemen,
you wouldn't be here.

550
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,627
What I'm offering you,
no one else in the world can provide.

551
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,129
No one else.

552
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,549
I'm willing to prove it
by doing it one time for free.

553
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,261
Then when we meet again,
you tell your boss to bring his wallet.

554
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,971
Payment in full.

555
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,098
Simple as that.

556
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:20,518
Then we have a deal.
Thanks for lunch. Let's go.

557
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,738
Go! You're up.

558
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:36,117
I'm not ready. I'm not ready.
I'm not ready. I'm not ready!

559
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,219
Torski, these are computers.

560
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,638
- Silent movies for 400, please.
- Answer there...

561
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:45,728
Who is Jackie Cooper?

562
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,523
Coogan. Jackie Coogan, stupid...

563
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,284
- We gotta go.
- Damn it. Give me some space!

564
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:07,250
Hey, how are you doing?
I've got a surprise for you here.

565
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:21,097
My God. Look at this.
Too bad we're not in the drug business.

566
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,768
- Come on, Leedy.
- I've almost got it.

567
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,187
- There.
- Where are you...

568
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,706
Can I help with anything?

569
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,042
You're making me nervous.
Would you just get away?

570
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,210
You got two minutes, Earl.

571
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,554
- What can I do to help you?
- I've got access.

572
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,014
Good. Good.

573
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,642
- I'm into the system.
- Yes.

574
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:13,066
- Wanna run this up to the evidence locker?
- You got it, babe.

575
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,246
Hey, Judy, Judy, wait up.

576
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,999
Baby, don't come down here.

577
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,586
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

578
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,922
Hey.

579
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,887
- The elevator's coming up.
- Roger that.

580
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:47,850
- Earl, we have to close that now.
- Okay! Okay! All right, okay.

581
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,272
Here they come.

582
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:55,983
Look at him.

583
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,529
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

584
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:04,534
- We've got to go. Close it down.
- Don't rush me. They'll know we were here.

585
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,664
You did good. Move it.

586
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,377
Stay. Go! Go!

587
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,713
- we're moving, Torski.
- Got you.

588
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,473
Oh, yeah.

589
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,604
God damn it!
Fucking Leedy threw up all over me.

590
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,608
The daring late-night theft netted criminals

591
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:23,070
over $50,000 worth of drugs
stolen from this protective enclosure.

592
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,698
The thieves hid out
in the building's maintenance area

593
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,742
until everyone had gone home.

594
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,453
An intensive Internal Affairs review
is underway,

595
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:34,540
since access to these areas is strictly
limited to station personnel.

596
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,628
Reporting from Miami headquarters,
I'm Diana Morales. Back to you.

597
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,507
I have to admit it, you're good, but so am I.

598
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,848
Here come your Miami undercover agents.

599
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,225
Finally.

600
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:03,694
These narcs are walking around somewhere
thinking they're alive.

601
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,287
Excellent. Thank you, carry on.

602
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,960
So, is that it?

603
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,380
- Am I done?
- No, a little while longer.

604
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,966
Is this the Marshal, the other Marshal?
The one on the plane?

605
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,051
- You told me you took care of him.
- Don't worry about him.

606
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,595
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
The guy you killed is his brother.

607
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,390
Leedy! I said don't worry about him.
I'll take care of my end of it, okay?

608
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,943
- Radical.
- All right, man, right behind you.

609
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,487
Yeah, I'm ready, man.

610
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,725
- Where's your car?
- Don't ask.

611
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:19,604
- Well, very, very cool bike.
- Air time.

612
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,691
Where's my team?

613
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,902
All right, all right, they're upstairs.

614
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,403
- All right.
- Come on.

615
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:31,157
Looking good, guys. Good formation.
That's great.

616
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,619
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, Jess.

617
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,704
- How you doing?
- How you doing, baby?

618
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,415
I'm getting together a team for the DC jump.
What about it?

619
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,501
- Hell, yes. Are you kidding me?
- Cool. Have you seen Swoop around?

620
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:46,255
No, not for a while. I heard that crazy
bastard was living on the street, though.

621
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,967
Yeah, right. What else is new?
I think I know where he's at.

622
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,011
We'll find him and Hockridge
and we've got ourselves a team.

623
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,972
- I'm in. Good to see you.
- All right. Good to see you.

624
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,517
Jess, come here.
Hockridge is out, he busted his ankle.

625
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,269
- What?
- It wasn't even on a jump.

626
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,313
He slipped getting out of the bathtub.

627
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,315
But, you see, I figure I could take his place,
no problem.

628
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,734
What have you logged, sweet pea,
a whole 20 jumps?

629
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,945
Come on, Jess, when was the last time
you actually saw me jump?

630
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:12,406
No, he is looking a lot better, Jess.
I've been giving him some extra air time.

631
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,950
- He's good.
- You give me half the chance,

632
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,453
- I'll slice the sky to pieces.
- Look, Selly, I don't need an Indiana Jones.

633
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,497
I need somebody who's good
and who takes orders, period.

634
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,625
Well, I like the kid's attitude.
He's got a lot of enthusiasm.

635
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:26,295
I think he does, too, but enthusiasm can
get you killed up there. Thank you, Pete.

636
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,633
- I can get Burt, he'll be here next week.
- No, I can't deal with Burt.

637
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,261
Can I have your attention, please?

638
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,014
All right, Selly, you're in.
But here's the drill.

639
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,351
First of all, you're our mechanic,
so please keep the plane flying.

640
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,937
Second of all,
if you hotdog on me, you're gone.

641
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:47,066
And third, Winona,
keep a watch on the extra air time.

642
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,568
Come on, let's go.

643
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,238
I'm taking Pete, we're gonna go find Swoop.

644
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:56,492
- Swoop? He's a nutcase.
- Swoop is cool. Swoop! Swoop!

645
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:57,576
Swoop you.

646
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,745
- I'm jumping, right?
- Jumping out of a plane?

647
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,415
No, I need you alive
to deal with my probation officer.

648
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,042
- Come on, Jess, I'm serious.
- So am I. I'm a good teacher,

649
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:08,212
but nobody's good enough
to get you up to exhibition level in a week.

650
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,006
Jess, here's the deal.

651
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,758
Something tells me I'm not going to find
who I'm looking for down here, right?

652
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,510
So, I gotta go up there.

653
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:17,221
If I don't jump, we've got no deal.

654
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,100
All right, you're an alternate, you train,
but you don't jump the exhibition.

655
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,727
Way to go, kid.

656
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,776
- Swoop.
- Why are we up here, again?

657
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:38,784
Swoop!

658
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,414
What the hell would he be doing
over there?

659
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,917
Swoop!

660
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,587
Over here.

661
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,508
- Hey, Swoop.
- Hey!

662
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,719
- What are you doing?
- Jeez.

663
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,638
How about this, huh?
The fine folks of this building

664
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:03,976
asked if I'd just come out here
and do a few windows, this and that.

665
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,688
- I need you for a team, Swoop.
- Really?

666
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,316
- Yeah.
- Yeah? How much does it pay?

667
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,401
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

668
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,571
All your jumps are paid for.

669
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,240
So, how about those jumps, there, Jess,
are they paid for?

670
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,701
- Yeah, they are.
- Didn't I just say that to him?

671
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:25,331
Yeah, but if he hasn't jumped with you,
he won't talk to you. He won't.

672
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:29,126
Well, I am going to have to require
a free T-shirt, Jess.

673
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:33,255
- What? Can we get him a free T-shirt?
- Yes. Tell him he can have a T-shirt.

674
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,925
- Okay. Free T, Swoop. Whatever you want.
- Yeah!

675
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:38,260
- Swoop. Yeah.
- My lucky day.

676
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,012
Here, give me a hand.

677
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,698
All right! It opened.

678
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:07,540
That ain't funny. That ain't funny, man.
Did you know about this?

679
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,940
Find what you're looking for?

680
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:21,822
- How long have you been following me?
- Ever since you decided to be my friend.

681
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,284
What's this all about?

682
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:30,247
When a skydiver burns in, the cops bring
the rig to a safety officer for inspection.

683
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,374
- And this is Jagger's.
- And... What?

684
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,627
There's nothing wrong with this rig.

685
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,212
Which means
he would have had to screw up big time

686
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,630
in order to float into those power lines.

687
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:41,091
And there's no way that happened.
He had help.

688
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,766
- Aren't these supposed to be metal?
- Yeah, it's a smuggler's rig.

689
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,310
- A what?
- It's a smuggler's rig.

690
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:54,396
Drug runners custom-make them
out of high-density fabric to escape radar.

691
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,441
- There's no metal in them.
- Would these pass through airport security?

692
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:00,444
- Yeah, probably.
- Damn!

693
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,824
What? Pete!

694
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,249
Put this back right where you found it,
all right?

695
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,585
You listen to me, these people are killers.
You leave the cop stuff to me.

696
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,087
All right.

697
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:29,139
- Milton.
- Mike. wake up, Mike. This is Nessip.

698
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,266
Pete. What?

699
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,977
I got an envelope that I'm delivering to you
with a piece of nylon in it.

700
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,853
I want you to examine it for explosives,
all right?

701
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:39,525
Explosives? Nylons? Are you dating
that Mongolian feminist again?

702
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,444
Look, I need your help on this, Mike.

703
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,781
I thought you were on suspension...
Vacation.

704
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:46,907
Suspension. You can say it.

705
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,243
Yeah, I am.
That's why I need you to do this for me.

706
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:53,956
Just examine it for explosives, alloys,
powder, whatever you can find. Anything.

707
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,542
This is the Justice Department.
We don't have time for that.

708
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:59,128
Mike, just do it, okay?

709
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:02,881
All right. And don't tell them it's for me,
or else they'll fire your ass.

710
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,218
Why can't you just be calling
to borrow money like usual, Pete?

711
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,411
Hey.

712
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,456
- Let's go.
- Go in.

713
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,086
Come on! Get in there.

714
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,471
Yeah, watch this.

715
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:04,777
- He isn't balancing at all.
- Yeah.

716
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,458
See?

717
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,802
Beautiful!

718
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:33,782
- Watch it coming down.
- I love it. Oh, yeah!

719
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,537
Crash and burn.

720
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,711
Oh, yeah!

721
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:49,256
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

722
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,010
I love it! I love it! What a ride! What a ride!

723
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,636
Need for speed.

724
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,475
That was great! That was great!
It was incredible!

725
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,143
How did I do?

726
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:05,481
Come on, what's with him?
I jumped with him. What's the deal?

727
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,816
I don't think he counts
what you just did as a jump.

728
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,902
He's kind of funny that way.

729
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,528
Well, what kind of other jump is there?

730
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:15,282
There's only one kind ofjump
and I did a sweet one, if I must say.

731
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,784
My buddy, Luxem,
ran the lab on your nylon.

732
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,328
This is serious guacamole.

733
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:23,957
Look at this. He found C-4 explosive,
flash-bang residue, high-grade alloys.

734
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,418
I mean, you ain't dealing
with a cat burglar, Pete.

735
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:30,714
Yeah, but it means I'm in the right place.
Tell your friend I owe him one.

736
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:34,426
No need, I promised him
you'd paint his house this summer.

737
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,963
The chopper's aboard.

738
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,057
Good to see you.

739
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,600
Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you again.

740
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,935
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

741
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,479
- Welcome. Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

742
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,982
- Follow me, please.
- We've tested your free sample

743
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,483
and decided we want more.

744
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,694
There's only one way
you're gonna get more.

745
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:36,863
Your price is rather large.

746
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,615
So are the results.

747
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,827
Good evening, everyone. Welcome aboard.

748
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,872
I'm only interested
in long-term investments.

749
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:50,627
What happens when the DEA
replaces their dead agents? And they will.

750
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:54,214
You're buying a very sophisticated
data service.

751
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:59,052
Once we're in the DEA computer, we're in,
and we'll update you whenever they do.

752
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:08,103
And the charge for this update?

753
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,190
$2 million a month

754
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:16,695
for the operations and names
of every undercover DEA agent in the world.

755
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,324
What can I say?

756
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,243
When do we see the list?

757
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:28,665
The day after Thomas Jefferson died,
July 5th. God bless America.

758
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,465
All right, settle down,
everybody, settle down.

759
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,550
And welcome to DC.

760
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,218
Yeah!

761
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:50,228
The jump tomorrow is one you're gonna
tell your grandchildren about.

762
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,939
We're jumping
into the city's fireworks display

763
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,858
and coming right down in Potomac Park.

764
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,362
That's right.

765
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,657
Everybody settle down.

766
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,493
That's right, a 34-way carousel dive.

767
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:07,913
Got Jack in the center
surrounded by a nine-way star,

768
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,207
outside of that, a 24-way star.

769
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:13,335
The judges today determine who gets
to jump tomorrow, and who doesn't.

770
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:16,463
You wanna be in a big fireworks show,
you'd better fly your butts off.

771
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,423
You need 10 points or better to qualify.

772
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,426
That's all I've got to say.
Let's load them up and skydive!

773
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:26,348
- Four hundred, 450. Something like that.
- No.

774
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:27,974
- What kind of competition is that?
- A vicious competition, man.

775
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,226
Ten points I gotta get?

776
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,436
Hey, Swoop,
how did you fix in with this group, man?

777
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,939
- It's a little embarrassing, isn't it?
- It's all right. It's all right.

778
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,441
What are you, a comedian?
Why don't you fuck off?

779
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,657
Nice landing, man!

780
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,204
- You are bad!
- That's my man.

781
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,123
My chute!

782
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,418
- All right. All right. Okay.
- All right.

783
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,170
Okay, that's 10 points for Moncrief's team.

784
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:48,513
- That's 10 points for Crossman's team.
- Both teams qualify.

785
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:58,857
Hey, Torski, watch your butt!

786
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,572
Hey! Hey!

787
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:07,699
Come on. Come on. Come on.

788
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:13,121
Hey, get the hell out of my face, man.

789
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:17,709
- Hey! Hey, you, you son of a bitch.
- Merry Christmas, asshole.

790
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:24,591
- Holy shit. What's that guy doing?
- It looks like a gift wrap.

791
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:29,012
Rock and roll!

792
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:35,101
God damn it!

793
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,198
Get away from me. Get away from me.

794
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,285
Son of a bitch!

795
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,580
Get away. No, get the hell away from me!

796
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,415
Bunch of assholes!

797
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:00,168
High five.

798
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:04,256
- Swoop! Swoop! Swoop! Swoop!
- Swoop! Swoop! Swoop! Swoop!

799
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,359
Thank you.

800
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:36,621
- Who's the guy with Torski?
- Ty Moncrief.

801
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:42,377
He's military or something.
He shows up now and then for big jumps.

802
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:54,723
I got to go strangle the weasel.

803
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:56,266
You do that, Pete.

804
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:58,393
- That guy was right.
- We'll mess things up.

805
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,649
- Look who's here, Deucie.
- Knock yourself out, man.

806
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:08,111
- Mr. Comedian.
- We're just jumpers, here.

807
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,739
- What do you think you're doing, sport?
- Can't we all just...

808
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:14,409
You think it's funny?
You wanna play with me?

809
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:16,620
You son of a bitch.

810
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,750
How are you doing now, sport?

811
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:24,586
You wanna do this?
You want to play with me, son?

812
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,463
How do you like that?

813
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,216
Shit!

814
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:32,552
- Yeah, the toilet's stopped up, man.
- Yeah?

815
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,429
- Why don't you go use a tree?
- A tree?

816
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:37,223
- Yeah, right there, see?
- Okay.

817
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:42,187
That's okay. I'm sorry.
I'm environmentally conscious.

818
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,814
Why don't you try this on for a while?

819
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,107
Hey, man, none of this is
any of your business,

820
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,443
unless you want me to make it such,
so why don't you get out of here?

821
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,111
You fuck with my team, you fuck with me.

822
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,447
Hey, fuck you and fuck your team.

823
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:03,541
I look out for everyone.

824
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,013
Come on. Come on.

825
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:37,951
Swoop. Swoop. Watch your head. Come on.

826
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,537
What?

827
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:47,585
So, what about this Ty Moncrief?

828
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,922
Jagger did a couple of drug carries for them
three years ago. Thanks.

829
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,216
Is he good enough to be
one of the people I'm looking for?

830
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:57,512
If I find out that he killed Jagger,
it won't matter how good he is.

831
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,683
Well, why would he risk showing his face
around here?

832
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:05,020
I mean, what's so special
about this DC jump?

833
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:09,649
Well, the 4th-of-July exhibition, Pete,
it's the biggest thing in the world.

834
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,526
I mean, Washington, DC is a drop zone.

835
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:14,654
Any other day,
it's the most restricted air space.

836
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:18,825
That's why every skydiver worth his ass
wants in on this load.

837
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:22,871
- Where exactly are they putting down?
- Sel, pass me that map.

838
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:26,291
Please. Thank you.

839
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,962
It's right there,
right by the Washington Monument.

840
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,131
You mean a jumper could put down
anyplace he wanted to?

841
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:37,010
I myself am going to make a landing
right in Abe Lincoln's lap.

842
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:41,306
Jess, you tell the new guy, "Thanks."

843
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:45,143
Thanks.

844
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:48,146
Yeah, tell him, "Anytime."
I enjoyed it.

845
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,232
- Can I keep this?
- Sure.

846
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,484
All right, see you, guys.

847
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:05,914
That's him. That's what
I've been trying to tell you all along.

848
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:07,373
- I know. I know.
- And I'm telling you,

849
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:08,833
we'd better take this son of a bitch out

850
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,418
- before he shuts us down.
- Shut up. Shut up.

851
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:14,547
This is real simple.
Cops can smell dead cops 100 miles away.

852
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:18,009
We keep their team on the ground,
they'll never touch us.

853
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:22,347
- I see. So how do you plan on doing that?
- By taking out their leader.

854
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,183
Crossman.

855
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,064
This is Jessie's trailer.

856
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:49,999
Not much longer, man, we've gotta move.

857
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,550
Have a nice trip.

858
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:08,518
Patrick, get this off to Chicago
and wait for the fax. It's number six.

859
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:09,936
Tom.

860
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,856
- Holy shit. What the hell happened to you?
- I've got to talk to you.

861
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:16,025
Come on in here.
Patrick, let me know when that comes in.

862
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:19,737
Working undercover while on suspension
violates your sworn oath.

863
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,573
Not to mention 20 different laws.

864
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:25,326
- Me accessing his file makes it 21.
- I'm in the middle of them.

865
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,787
As a matter of fact,
I found one of the chutes from the 747.

866
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:30,290
- Did you know that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

867
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:32,417
If you've got evidence,
make your case to the FBI.

868
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:36,588
You're going to have to do better than this
Ty Moncrief fellow. He's DEA. See that?

869
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:40,466
- Moncrief is DEA?
- Honorably discharged eight months ago.

870
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:45,471
I'll bring his service record up
so you can see it.

871
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,184
What the hell's going on
with this computer?

872
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:52,145
Leedy.

873
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:55,023
Peter. Pete!

874
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,032
Okay, folks, check it out. Demo jumpers,

875
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:07,869
we've got about a 12-minute call
to dress rehearsal. Twelve-minute call.

876
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:10,538
Let's nail this one, puppies.
we've gotta nail this one.

877
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,752
- Guys, has anyone seen Nessip?
- Who? No.

878
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:17,295
Pete. No.

879
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,799
What's your problem, ace?

880
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:24,552
What's the matter, sweet pea?

881
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:26,387
Nothing, I mean, I'm not the pro here,

882
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:27,722
I don't want to be the one
to screw things up.

883
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:30,683
Sel, you're not going to screw anything up.

884
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:37,106
Listen to me. This rig, it logged two world
titles for Jagger and one for me, all right?

885
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:38,316
You wanna wear this?

886
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,776
This mean I don't have to wear
that stupid helmet?

887
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:44,280
Sel, no, you don't gotta wear
the stupid helmet. How's that, all right?

888
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:48,243
- Yeah! Let's jump!
- The star!

889
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,798
- I'm ready.
- Hold on, hotdog.

890
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,060
- Time to go.
- Come on, let's go.

891
01:11:14,144 --> 01:11:16,062
- Let's get out there.
- Do it!

892
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:16,581
Shit. Somebody didn't open.

893
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,959
Selkirk, cut away. Damn it.

894
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:21,836
Cut away.

895
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,213
I can't get it.

896
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:31,971
Cut away.

897
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:43,024
4,000 feet.

898
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,288
Swoop, get him. God damn.

899
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:04,003
- Two grand. Pull it!
- Pull it!

900
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:06,631
- Pull it.
- Pull it.

901
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:21,771
Come on, pull. Come on.

902
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,836
Paramedics to the water area now!

903
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:05,523
We need a medic over here.

904
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:13,030
- God, what happened to him?
- It's not good.

905
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:17,577
Sel, can you hear us? Please.
God damn it, get this off him.

906
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:20,538
- Stay with us, Selly.
- Oh, Bobby, he's not breathing.

907
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,416
- He's not breathing.
- He tried to pull it, it just wouldn't work.

908
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:26,043
- God. Get up!
- Here we go.

909
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:32,383
Get us a medic, God damn it.
Stay with us, Selly.

910
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:37,513
- I hear it. I hear it.
- Yeah! Yeah!

911
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:40,475
Selkirk, buddy.

912
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:42,685
- He's breathing. He's breathing.
- There you go.

913
01:14:42,769 --> 01:14:44,854
- He's breathing.
- Look out, let me in here.

914
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:46,522
- Look out. You all right?
- He's breathing.

915
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,983
Okay. Good job. Good job.

916
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,460
- You're going to be okay.
- You're gonna be okay, buddy.

917
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:08,920
- Can you hear me?
- It's okay.

918
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:31,275
- Sel.
- Take it easy.

919
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,819
- We're right here, buddy.
- Sorry, guys, but you can't stay in here.

920
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:35,655
We're going to stay right here with you,
buddy, all right?

921
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:37,865
You can meet us at the hospital,
but nobody rides in the van.

922
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,367
- Bullshit, we're family.
- Nobody.

923
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:42,912
Hey, guys, don't worry about it, right?
You guys have gotta jump anyway.

924
01:15:42,996 --> 01:15:46,707
Get the hell out of here.
Just tell Jess her rig's broken.

925
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:49,085
All right, man, we'll see you at the hospital.

926
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,780
Where the hell is Jessie?

927
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:22,868
Winona, let's get this plane in the air.
We're going after Ty's plane.

928
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:24,662
- Who's this?
- I'm a US Marshal.

929
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:25,913
Now, you can read about it later.

930
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:29,375
No way, later. We're going.
Come on. Crank it up.

931
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:16,380
- I want to jump!
- Okay, let's go.

932
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:19,925
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go, go!

933
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,813
Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go!

934
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,565
Bye-bye.

935
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:38,319
Let's go. Chutes on. Let's go.

936
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:39,987
Here we go.

937
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:26,742
We're so close to pulling this off.
All you have to do...

938
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,411
Hey, surprise!

939
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,791
Only one of you really has to die.
So tell me, who killed Jagger?

940
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,167
How about me? You wanna try me?

941
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:37,336
You come here, I'll shoot you
right in between the fucking eyes!

942
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:38,796
Jesus, Jessie, bad idea...

943
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,132
You look like a little boy
without a chute, Jessie.

944
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:46,137
- I knew it was you, Ty.
- Stay there.

945
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:47,221
You don't know what you're doing.

946
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:48,973
No.
You don't know what the fuck you're doing.

947
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,891
Let me tell you about Jagger.
He betrayed you.

948
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:53,894
He left you in prison to rot like jailbait.
This is his girlfriend.

949
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:56,105
You meant nothing to him. He's dead.
You're on the wrong...

950
01:18:56,189 --> 01:18:57,440
Sit down.

951
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:00,985
Get off of me.

952
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:04,196
- Get off.
- Throw her out.

953
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:06,031
Throw her out.

954
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:09,410
Jump. Jump, Jessie, I dare you.

955
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,955
- Oh, shit.
- Jess.

956
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:17,877
- She's got a lot ofjuice.
- Yeah, but she ain't got no wings, man.

957
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:20,045
Let's go, get our chutes on.

958
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:32,183
We've lost them.

959
01:19:33,393 --> 01:19:35,603
They sure as hell weren't tracking
for the fireworks.

960
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:37,480
I know where Ty's headed.

961
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:40,524
He's going to the DEA building.
Right near the drop zone.

962
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:42,985
- Should I radio for backup?
- Yeah, right.

963
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:45,529
First they'll laugh at you,
then they'll throw your ass in jail.

964
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:12,097
Jesus, Mary, priest!

965
01:20:15,727 --> 01:20:17,102
Jessie.

966
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:22,149
She's hanging on the footrail.
What the hell is she doing?

967
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:27,571
I know exactly what she's doing.
It's the only trick I know.

968
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:53,764
- Swoop, what are you doing?
- I'm not going to miss this.

969
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:22,585
...reveals nothing.

970
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:27,214
I suggest his mind has been so conditioned
as part of a preconceived plan.

971
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:29,550
God damn, look at this dweeb.

972
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:33,929
You think by the 23rd century
they'd have better toupees than that.

973
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:37,558
- They all wear wigs on that show.
- Not Spock.

974
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:42,062
- He got the ears.
- What the hell are you talking about?

975
01:21:52,115 --> 01:21:55,159
All clear up here.
I'm going to the 19th floor.

976
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:13,761
Little power hit.

977
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:16,096
Probably burning down the kitchen again.

978
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:18,599
Joanne, are you cooking again?

979
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:20,142
we've had a couple power spikes.

980
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:23,395
No, you guys want to order a pizza?
I'm starving.

981
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:29,026
All right, we're in.

982
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:33,697
- Radio check.
- One.

983
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,532
- Two.
- Three.

984
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:10,567
Clear.

985
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,959
Not now.

986
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:31,255
There is no logic in Thelev's attack
upon the Captain. There is no logic...

987
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:35,634
Okay.

988
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:51,400
- Is it going to work?
- It's going to work.

989
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:52,526
Come on, come on, come on.

990
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:57,406
Go, go, go, go, go.

991
01:24:00,326 --> 01:24:03,454
- Leedy. Earl. Earl!
- Leedy, quickly.

992
01:24:03,913 --> 01:24:06,123
Where are you? Come on.

993
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:40,282
- We're all clear.
- Good.

994
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:47,247
Okay, we're into the game.

995
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:57,674
Come on.

996
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:11,396
How smart can one man be?

997
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:17,027
Jimmy Sansome, Jesus Christ,
that guy used to hit on me.

998
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,112
This guy's a Fed?

999
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:23,242
- Deuce, run code blue. Are you ready?
- Yeah, copy, Ty. I'm ready to rock and roll.

1000
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,080
It's cool up here. The chutes are ready.

1001
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:38,757
- What the...
- Look out!

1002
01:25:48,434 --> 01:25:50,853
What's the matter, you can't fly?

1003
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:59,194
Swoop, get away from the door. Follow me.

1004
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:01,113
Come on, get him up.

1005
01:26:18,464 --> 01:26:20,507
You're dead, dead.

1006
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,197
Thank God!

1007
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:49,953
Listen up. Stage 1 is completed.
Stay focused, we're right on schedule.

1008
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:52,998
Yeah. Well, the schedule's gonna change.

1009
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:56,126
- Come on. Are you okay?
- There you go.

1010
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,837
- Swoop, stay here. Don't rob him, okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.

1011
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:01,298
- I'm going for help.
- Okay, easy, take it easy. Easy.

1012
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:03,217
She's going for help.

1013
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:26,865
What the hell?

1014
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,826
Joanne, come back to me.

1015
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,745
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you.

1016
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:34,248
Joanne, we've got a circuit trip,
says a washer trolley is moving.

1017
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:35,832
Check it out, will you?

1018
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,961
Hi, we might be under attack from Klingons.

1019
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:41,838
Maybe they got food. Okay, I'm on my way.

1020
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:44,716
I'll be back.

1021
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,269
Ty, the elevator's moving.

1022
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:58,105
Stop it on this floor.
I'm coming to meet you.

1023
01:27:58,189 --> 01:27:59,815
Stay with Leedy.

1024
01:28:16,874 --> 01:28:17,874
Hey!

1025
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,460
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Give him the gun, give him the gun.

1026
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:23,714
It's okay, don't panic. Why don't you
radio down and tell them everything's fine,

1027
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:26,341
you're okay? Tell them you're fine.

1028
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:30,137
Nothing going on up here.

1029
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:32,723
We're still getting
a washer-trolley signal, though.

1030
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:36,059
- Probably just a short.
- Roger. Yeah, thank you.

1031
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:37,769
You're dismissed.

1032
01:28:40,064 --> 01:28:41,565
You take care of her. I'm letting them know.

1033
01:28:48,948 --> 01:28:50,365
Oh, my God!

1034
01:29:00,251 --> 01:29:02,711
- Fuck!
- What? Whoa!

1035
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:08,008
God damn it! You go up on the roof.

1036
01:29:08,092 --> 01:29:12,346
Kara, check the floor. I'm coming
with Leedy. I'm with the magician.

1037
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:15,057
You're on the roof. I need you.
Come on, come on, let's go.

1038
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:19,519
- All right, Leedy, I'm right outside.
- What? Where are you going? Hey!

1039
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:45,420
Shit!

1040
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:58,141
I'm calling for backup.

1041
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:00,102
Call the fire department, too.
We got smoke on the 20th floor.

1042
01:30:00,186 --> 01:30:01,353
Right.

1043
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:08,068
Close it out. Close it out. Now!

1044
01:30:57,535 --> 01:30:59,828
- Ty...
- You little... God damn it.

1045
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:01,663
Kara.

1046
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:07,752
- Are you proud of yourself?
- Ty, get off me.

1047
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:12,132
Come on. Come on, go, go.

1048
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,146
I'll be right back, okay?
Okay, I'll be right nearby.

1049
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:29,107
- Right nearby, okay?
- All right. All right.

1050
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:34,821
Jessie?

1051
01:31:37,366 --> 01:31:39,784
Jessie, what do you want me to do?

1052
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:41,912
Jessie...

1053
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:32,712
- Leedy, don't you move.
- What?

1054
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:34,047
Wait, wait. No, wait, wait.

1055
01:32:34,131 --> 01:32:35,465
- Don't move.
- You got them. You got them.

1056
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:39,594
You've got them on hijacking, murder,
smuggling, kidnapping, cruelty to animals.

1057
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:42,556
Look what they did to me.
They took my finger...

1058
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:45,225
Thought you'd get away from me, huh?

1059
01:32:45,309 --> 01:32:49,521
Earl. Earl, you disappoint me.
They're going to put you away if you go in.

1060
01:32:49,605 --> 01:32:50,730
Who's your friend?

1061
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:52,691
Look, I was just trying to stall them for you.

1062
01:32:52,775 --> 01:32:55,110
You're the reason your little brother's dead,
you idiot.

1063
01:32:55,194 --> 01:32:56,528
Families shouldn't fly together.

1064
01:32:56,612 --> 01:32:58,738
That's all right, you'll meet him again.
I guarantee that.

1065
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,115
And when you do,
he's gonna bust your ass.

1066
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:02,492
You try and stop me, or bring me
somewhere, you're fucked!

1067
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:05,912
He's bluffing, Jessie.
He needs this little bastard.

1068
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:07,414
Don't you think about it!

1069
01:33:07,498 --> 01:33:08,748
Shoot him, shoot him dead!

1070
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,334
Freeze! Drop your weapons.

1071
01:33:12,503 --> 01:33:14,212
I said drop them!

1072
01:33:28,352 --> 01:33:31,187
Leedy? Leedy!

1073
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:44,034
Shit!

1074
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,586
I'm going for it.

1075
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:37,230
Oh, Jesus. Look, guys,
is this really necessary? I'm not that hurt.

1076
01:35:37,314 --> 01:35:40,608
You know, I've been through worse
than this before.

1077
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,318
I will personally write the President

1078
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:44,863
and recommend that you receive
commendation for your actions.

1079
01:35:44,947 --> 01:35:47,574
Now, if you'll just maintain your stations
here, and secure this location,

1080
01:35:47,658 --> 01:35:48,908
I'll be checking the rest of the area.

1081
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:50,618
- Jerry.
- Dupont, Ted.

1082
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:52,871
- Yes, very good work.
- With a "J."

1083
01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:03,757
Leedy. Leedy.
Leedy, you come back here. Leedy.

1084
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:06,885
Leedy. Stop that guy. Stop.
The one with the bozo hairdo.

1085
01:36:06,969 --> 01:36:08,887
Leedy. Jesus, listen to me. Listen to me.

1086
01:36:08,971 --> 01:36:10,680
He's wearing a DEA jacket. Stop...

1087
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:13,808
Leedy, you come... Leedy!
Leedy! Stop that guy.

1088
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:15,727
No way.

1089
01:36:16,061 --> 01:36:19,022
Don't make me roll after you.
You better not make me roll after you.

1090
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:20,565
Yeah, that guy right there.
He's one of the bad guys.

1091
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:39,042
Fucking awesome, man.

1092
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:42,587
Way to go, Swoop!

1093
01:36:47,259 --> 01:36:49,052
Hey, man, it's the other leg, man.

1094
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,095
- All right, I'll see you in a bit.
- All right.

1095
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:54,849
Pete! Hi, Pete, are you all right?

1096
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:56,392
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1097
01:36:57,019 --> 01:37:01,147
Well, you jumped, you lived.
That's a good start.

1098
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:06,027
Yeah. Maybe in another 40 or 50 years
I'll try it again.

1099
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:09,823
Pete! Pete, Pete, Pete.

1100
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:13,952
- Swoop!
- Hey, Pete, Pete.

1101
01:37:14,036 --> 01:37:16,871
- Listen, talk to these guys, okay?
- We want to help you.

1102
01:37:16,956 --> 01:37:20,083
Okay? Tell them that my leg is broke, okay?

1103
01:37:21,168 --> 01:37:24,546
Anything you want, Swoop.
Anything you want, brother.

1104
01:37:25,546 --> 01:37:35,546
