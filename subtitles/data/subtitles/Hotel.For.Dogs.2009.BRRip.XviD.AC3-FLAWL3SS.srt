1
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,634
You want some?

2
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,982
- How'd we do?
- $27.

3
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:19,903
Nobody questions shrink wrap.

4
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:25,033
- Are you hungry?
- A little bit. The dog probably is a lot.

5
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,159
Good job.

6
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,996
Can you stop touching my hair?

7
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,747
Hey, his collar slipped off.

8
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,333
And you waited right here.

9
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,086
What a good boy. Yes, you are!

10
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,381
Oh, we missed you too, buddy.

11
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:42,217
I hope he knows what we go through
just to feed him.

12
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:46,013
All right, here you go, Friday.

13
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:52,269
I've never seen a dog
eat that much. Ever.

14
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,106
Here you go.

15
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,108
Nice catch.

16
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,444
Go.

17
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,406
Meet us at home, Friday.

18
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,616
Excuse me, miss.

19
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,493
That's her.
She's the one who ripped me off.

20
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,412
Thank goodness you're here, Officer.

21
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:19,338
This guy's been stalking me all day,
and it's really freaking me out.

22
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,313
Okay, thanks. I really appreciate it.

23
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:39,399
Either I call you or
I have to fill out all the forms.

24
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,777
- Love to Alice.
- Yeah. Same to Carol.

25
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,155
Central City PD, precinct desk.

26
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,782
Hold on, I'll transfer you.

27
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,035
Put it down.

28
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,580
- Hey.
- Hey, Bernie.

29
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,791
Don't "Hey, Bernie" me.

30
00:06:55,833 --> 00:07:00,295
You know I have half a mind
to leave you two here?

31
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:05,509
You're sprung. Come on, let's go.

32
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,803
Hurry up.

33
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:15,561
I'll do the rest of my yelling
while I'm taking you back.

34
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,814
Look, the guy
could have pressed charges.

35
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:22,526
You sold him a rock in a box
for 20 bucks.

36
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:26,154
Oh, that's funny?

37
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,907
It's not funny. It's anything but funny.

38
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:33,871
What if they'd called Carl and Lois
instead of me?

39
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:40,669
I guess you'd have to find us
new foster parents, then.

40
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:43,755
Is that what you're trying to do?

41
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:47,926
You guys, that's
a very dangerous game, I'm telling you.

42
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,971
One and...

43
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,810
No.

44
00:07:56,852 --> 00:08:00,480
You know, the word "harmonizing"
comes from the word "harmony."

45
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,692
- So?
- So I'm saying you're still half a step off.

46
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,862
Oh, really? Well, that's funny
because my vocal instructor,

47
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:11,033
who is a paid vocal instructor,
didn't notice that, but you did.

48
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,661
Here's the note.

49
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,087
You're late.
And you interrupted rehearsal.

50
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,048
I'm very sorry.

51
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,092
Get in there. Hurry up.

52
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:32,346
Babe, maybe we should skip this one
and just play the hit.

53
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:35,224
- They're all hits, baby.
- You're right.

54
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,142
- Hey, Bernie.
- Carl.

55
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:41,772
Your food's on your trays.

56
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,650
Yummy! It's too bad we already ate.

57
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,236
Fine. It'll be lunch tomorrow.

58
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,614
All right, could we just get back
to the issue at hand, okay?

59
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:53,242
I'm a kind woman. Okay?

60
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:58,288
In fact, everyone's always asking,
"Lois, why are you so kind?"

61
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,040
But we have rules. Okay?

62
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:04,545
We serve dinner at a certain time, so
we can finish dinner at a certain time.

63
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:12,135
So we can drop our rock manifesto
on the world at a certain time.

64
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,806
Okay, but those times have come
and gone. So...

65
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:19,852
Oh, where were they?

66
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:25,107
Look, this whole thing is my fault. Okay?

67
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:29,486
We were just getting caught up
and we were having so much fun...

68
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,946
Whoa. Yeah.

69
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:34,825
...that I just lost track of time.
I'm sorry, really. My apologies.

70
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,952
Now, why don't we just
get them to their room

71
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:43,375
and you guys can continue
making that magic.

72
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,636
- Thanks for covering for us.
- Andi, Andi. Listen!

73
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,097
You cannot afford to screw this up.

74
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,641
You've only been here
two months, okay?

75
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,519
This is your fifth set
of foster parents in three years.

76
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:07,649
The Johnsons don't count,
we were there for two hours.

77
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,318
Do you know the reaction I get
when I tell people

78
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,820
I'm trying to place
11 and 16-year-old siblings?

79
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:15,490
It ain't a good one. Okay?
You guys mess this up, that's it.

80
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,159
I don't have any more favors
I can call in.

81
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:19,369
I'm gonna have to
place you two separately.

82
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,998
No! You know I won't
let that happen, Bernie.

83
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,500
We stay together.

84
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,752
All right, then
take a little advice from me, okay?

85
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:31,173
A technique that I've learned.
When somebody who I...

86
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:34,843
...who I don't particularly like is saying
something that I don't want to hear,

87
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:38,680
I just nod and I go, "Mmm-hmm."
It works wonders.

88
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,517
Mmm-hmm.

89
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:49,858
Okay, I'm through with you guys.

90
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,069
I'll tell you what, I better not get
any more phone calls

91
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:59,117
about a trick with a brick
or a scam with a ham...

92
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:09,211
Okay, it was a good talk, Bernie.
Thank you very much for stopping by.

93
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:13,257
What are you guys...

94
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:31,024
Good boy. Somebody's tired today, huh?

95
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,569
I am.

96
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,123
Friday.

97
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,042
- Andi.
- Yeah.

98
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:34,463
- Friday's gone.
- What?

99
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:40,344
- Friday, come here.
- Where'd he go?

100
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,388
Good God.

101
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,309
You two are just a bundle of energy.

102
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,561
Good morning!

103
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,022
Stop shouting.

104
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:56,318
My vocal instructor said getting
frightened is bad for my pitch.

105
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,153
What are you doing up so early?

106
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:02,449
- Just thought we'd get some...
- Breakfast!

107
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,661
All right, so, I unlocked the pantry.

108
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,497
Your cereal's in there.
You know how to get it.

109
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,791
I'm not your servant. All right?

110
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:16,171
I am obliged to prepare two meals
a day, that's lunch and dinner.

111
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,923
Friday!

112
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,424
What?

113
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,970
I said,
"Bruce, what is the day after Thursday?"

114
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,138
- Friday!
- Thanks.

115
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:31,395
Fine. Get weird on me.
I can handle weird.

116
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:39,736
Okay, I don't need your attitude
about setting the table, okay?

117
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:43,198
Don't be lazy.

118
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,160
It needs cinnamon.

119
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:50,706
Or is it cinnamon that Carl's allergic to?

120
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,208
Well, one way to find out, I guess.

121
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,503
Let's see him harmonize
with a tongue the size of a beehive.

122
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,464
Wait! You just reminded me
of this really funny story.

123
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,633
I was walking and I stepped on a bee
and it stung me.

124
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,969
So then, I went and took care of my foot,

125
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:08,223
then I went back for the bee
to throw it outside and I thought,

126
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,393
"You know, I'd be safe because
bees can't sting you more than once."

127
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:16,982
Right? I mean, right? It was crazy.
I mean, isn't that crazy?

128
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,233
Excuse me.

129
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:25,574
You owe me 30 seconds of my life,
and I will collect.

130
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,246
Thanks for the heart attack.

131
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,916
Of course I checked in there,
maybe they're in the kids' room.

132
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,418
Carl, did you eat the bacon?

133
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,380
Stay close, Friday.

134
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:51,183
Did I leave my whitening strips in here?

135
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,219
He'd usually be here by now.

136
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,430
You know, maybe he can't hear it.

137
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,974
It's mealtime.
He could hear it on the moon.

138
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:19,605
He's probably just wandering around.

139
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:25,694
Friday! Friday!

140
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:32,451
- What are we gonna do?
- Come on. Friday!

141
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,663
Friday! Come on!
Maybe he ran down this alley.

142
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,416
Friday!

143
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:47,674
You don't think he went in there,
do you?

144
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:53,847
No. Why would he go in there?
He's probably just out looking for food.

145
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,099
Friday!

146
00:16:56,141 --> 00:17:00,229
How cute. I want one.

147
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:12,282
Nice haircut.

148
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,910
Thanks, Dave.
I was hoping you'd notice.

149
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:17,913
Oh, I was actually
talking about the Pomeranian.

150
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,749
But yours is, yours is really nice, too.

151
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,544
- You did something new to it.
- I did.

152
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,879
And I'm pretty sure you could tell
when I first got it done

153
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:28,257
because you kind of looked at me
and then looked away,

154
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,592
and then looked back like,
"Hey, something's different."

155
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,053
But then you didn't say anything
and I was like, "Men."

156
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,305
So then the next day I tried
to compliment you on your hair,

157
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,057
you know,
giving you a little hint here but...

158
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:45,607
No, absolutely. I totally remember that.
Anyways, it looks great.

159
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:52,239
Can I help you?

160
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:57,244
No, no, we're just looking for our dog.

161
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:00,622
I don't suppose you've seen him,
have you?

162
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,124
No.

163
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,294
Friday? That's a funny name.

164
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:10,716
I bet when you find him, you'll say,
"Thank God it's Friday."

165
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:15,137
Right? It's a joke. So...

166
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,681
I don't think
I've ever seen you around here before.

167
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:22,144
- Do you go to Thomas Jefferson?
- I will actually, in the fall. Andi.

168
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:23,312
Dave.

169
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,856
My family just moved here
a couple of months ago.

170
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:29,026
That's cool. How do you like it so far?

171
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:32,988
What's not to like?

172
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,910
- We have to go.
- No problem.

173
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:47,169
You know, if he doesn't show up soon,
you might want to check the pound.

174
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,617
- Friday! Friday! There he is!
- There he is.

175
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,327
- There he is.
- There he is! Friday! Friday!

176
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:25,874
- Your dog?
- Yeah, that's our dog!

177
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,470
Yeah, he just got in.

178
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:41,473
Yeah, I know, we just saw him.

179
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,726
Well, I'm always glad
when these things have a happy ending.

180
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:47,396
We're open till 6:00. Get your parents,
come back, we'll figure it out.

181
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:48,939
Wait! Wait...

182
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:53,193
Come on, we're already here.
It's our dog.

183
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:57,239
Yeah, well, there's a lot of paperwork.
Grown-up paperwork.

184
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:59,908
There's always a guy
who screws up the paperwork.

185
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:05,831
But you see this guy? I'm not that guy.

186
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:40,991
We can't let him out alone anymore.

187
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:44,161
I mean, if he gets picked up again,
we might not get him back.

188
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:48,874
And things are gonna get
so much harder when school starts.

189
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:53,712
Look, Bruce, I think we need
to find Friday a new home.

190
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,589
- Well, you know, I've got a few ideas.
- No.

191
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,841
We've been hiding him
in alleys and garages,

192
00:20:57,883 --> 00:21:02,137
in the woods for three years.

193
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:07,809
Don't you think he deserves
a real home with a real family?

194
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:12,356
But we are a real family.

195
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:22,658
Let's get out of here.

196
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:30,123
- You kids! Hold it right there!
- We can't get in trouble again.

197
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:38,549
- But we didn't do anything wrong.
- You want to tell them that?

198
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,271
Oh, my God.

199
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:08,120
- Friday! No! Get back here!
- Bruce!

200
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:10,956
Come on.

201
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,142
- You got anything?
- No.

202
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:33,187
Forget it.

203
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:42,696
Let's just find Friday
and get out of here.

204
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,657
Friday!

205
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,454
Circuits are fried.

206
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:53,207
Friday!

207
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,756
Bruce, stay close.

208
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:06,803
Wow. Andi, look at all this stuff.

209
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,607
Careful.

210
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:21,360
Friday?

211
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:35,040
Friday, where are you, boy?

212
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:44,049
- What's that?
- It's just an old hotel.

213
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,551
Hotels don't make footsteps.

214
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:54,393
People make footsteps when they walk
through hotels with their feet.

215
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:58,480
Good point. Come on!

216
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:03,068
Go, go, go!

217
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:35,017
Friday, stay back.

218
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,620
Do you think they belong to anyone?

219
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,455
If they did, would they be here?

220
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:58,707
Better here than the pound.

221
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:02,044
Friday! Wait!

222
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:24,399
- Look at that.
- Okay.

223
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:45,420
What about just, you know,
leaving Friday with them tonight?

224
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:52,219
One night.

225
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:03,981
Good night, guys. Sleep tight.

226
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:31,300
So I mean it's supposed to be
a teacher appreciation lunch, right?

227
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,302
But then it ends up
being more work for us

228
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,470
if we have to set it up
and then clean it up.

229
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:36,597
I mean, sometimes, you know,

230
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:40,225
I could appreciate
a little less appreciation, you know?

231
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:44,021
Don't nod and "Mmm-hmm" me.
I taught you the nod and "Mmm-hmm."

232
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:46,732
Yeah, that's true,
but I'd like to think I've made it my own.

233
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,860
Oh, really?

234
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:56,116
- What's wrong?
- It's these kids, the other night.

235
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:58,535
- Andi and Bruce?
- Yeah.

236
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:01,121
- Are they okay?
- I don't know.

237
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:04,666
I mean, it's bad enough
they lost their parents.

238
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,335
If they can't work this situation out,

239
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:08,086
I don't know if we're gonna be able
to find a family

240
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:10,464
that's gonna take the both of them.

241
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:12,549
You do everything you can for them,
you know.

242
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:17,304
You can't bring home
your work and let it make you crazy.

243
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:19,473
- You're right.
- Yeah.

244
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:23,018
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

245
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:30,067
It's too bad.
You know, they really are good kids.

246
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:39,952
It's three hungry dogs.
Grab as much as you can.

247
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:53,757
That's quite a load there.

248
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,717
Yeah. Just getting some breakfast.

249
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:01,306
What, are you feeding
the whole neighborhood?

250
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:04,726
Okay, you wouldn't even touch this
the first time.

251
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:07,646
I don't eat, you're angry.
I eat, you're angry.

252
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:12,484
Okay, fine, people, eat.
Lucky for you I saved your dinners.

253
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:17,030
You can start with those.

254
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,374
Come on.

255
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:44,099
What is that?

256
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:49,021
You know, if you would eat
the meals I make,

257
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,064
you wouldn't be so hungry
in the morning.

258
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:56,904
You're right. Thank you so much, Lois.

259
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,960
Done.

260
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:22,387
I'm hearing something.

261
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,452
What?

262
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,337
- What's his problem?
- I don't know. Why are you asking me?

263
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:59,466
Stop howling, please.

264
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:27,703
Yes, I'd like to call in a complaint
about a howling dog.

265
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,747
That's it?

266
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:37,296
All that just so
you could look out a window?

267
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:40,465
Never mind.

268
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:06,617
Wow. Even Lenny
and Georgia won't touch it.

269
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:08,744
We need to go get
some real dog food for them.

270
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,621
Wait, who?

271
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:13,415
Lenny and Georgia.
That's what I named the new dogs.

272
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:14,750
No. No naming them.

273
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,251
If you name them,
you're gonna get attached.

274
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:20,214
Andi, look at her.
Tell me she's not a Georgia.

275
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:21,423
Bruce, I'm not kidding, okay?

276
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:24,551
I'm glad
that Friday's getting along well with

277
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:29,223
dog number one and dog number two,
but we're barely keeping our dog safe.

278
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:31,934
I mean, do you know what happens
if we get caught in here?

279
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:34,478
Trespassing, breaking and entering.

280
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,774
You heard what Bernie said.
They'd split us up and ship us off.

281
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:43,111
Are you even listening?

282
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,132
So I'll stay here and keep them quiet

283
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:09,388
while you go out
and get some real food. Okay?

284
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:14,601
Okay, fine. But just for now.
And I'll be back.

285
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:19,439
Stay, Friday. Stay, Georgia.

286
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:27,072
You better keep them quiet.

287
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:11,533
You like to fetch.

288
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:23,587
- Hey. I see you found your dog.
- Yeah. He's fine.

289
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:25,964
That's great.

290
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:30,260
- Can I help you find anything?
- No, just getting some dog food.

291
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:35,140
- That's 40 pounds, by the way.
- Yeah, that's probably right.

292
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:37,893
For that little dog on the flier,
40 pounds?

293
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:40,562
Well, the thing is, I actually...
I have three dogs,

294
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:42,314
two of them are strays.

295
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:46,818
- My parents, they just love animals.
- That's great.

296
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,822
Yeah. You know, they're the best.
I'm really lucky.

297
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:55,828
We have this big yard
and we just rescue dogs all the time.

298
00:33:55,869 --> 00:34:01,750
- All the time?
- Well, yeah, whenever.

299
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:07,256
You know what? Here, come with me.

300
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:14,972
- They're so cute.
- Yeah.

301
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:16,598
We adopt out dogs here,

302
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,227
but we can't get anybody
to take these guys.

303
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:23,897
They're not puppies anymore,
and everybody always wants puppies.

304
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:25,023
Tell me about it.

305
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:28,360
They're also kind of...
Well, they're loveably defective.

306
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:31,947
Cooper, he's my favorite.
I think he's actually half goat.

307
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,991
There's not a substance on Earth
he can't chew through.

308
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:38,620
He's been through pocketbooks,
cell phones, shoes, handbags,

309
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:42,332
even ate through a license plate once.

310
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:45,669
This is Shep.

311
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:51,300
Yeah, she's got some herding issues.

312
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:55,846
- Pushy.
- I like pushy.

313
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:58,056
So, they've got quirks.
I mean, they're still adorable.

314
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:01,643
Good, I'm glad you think so,
because you're taking them.

315
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:04,605
What? No.

316
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:09,902
The owner says
we can't keep them forever

317
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:14,198
and if I can't find a place to put them,
then they're going to the pound.

318
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:16,116
Look, I'm sorry,
but there's no way that I can just...

319
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:19,828
You're already taking care
of a few strays, what's three more?

320
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:23,665
- Three?
- Oh, yeah. You're gonna love this guy.

321
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:27,711
Romeo. Romeo. Romeo.

322
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:31,340
Whoa.

323
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,968
What if you just took them
for a little while?

324
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,096
Until I can figure something out.
I'll pay for food.

325
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:45,354
I get an employee discount.
It's the least I can do.

326
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:58,033
Georgia, I'm sorry, but I can't stand here
all day playing fetch with you.

327
00:35:58,075 --> 00:36:01,662
Georgia, zip it.

328
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:03,997
No.

329
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:10,045
Guys, come on! Please! Oh, no!

330
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:16,969
What's it gonna take for me
to get you guys to...

331
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:26,562
Sweet ride.

332
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:32,067
Yeah, it's pretty much a chick magnet.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

333
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:37,906
Getting close. Right there. That's it.

334
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:40,242
This is where you live?

335
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:43,245
Actually, my parents are out of town,

336
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:49,668
so I kind of had to make
other arrangements.

337
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:54,214
This place looks condemned.
What are we doing here?

338
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:56,383
It's where we keep the dogs.

339
00:36:56,425 --> 00:37:04,725
- Well, are you allowed to be in there?
- No, so let's move it.

340
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,646
All right, guys, watch this.

341
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:12,274
Ready?

342
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:18,113
Are you sure it's safe in here?

343
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:26,872
Yeah. We've been poking around here
for a couple of days, actually.

344
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:30,584
Okay, that hurt.

345
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:43,305
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

346
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:50,979
Bruce, you remember Dave, right?
Dave from the pet store.

347
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:53,190
Hi, Dave.

348
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:56,235
He just needed a place
to keep a couple of dogs

349
00:37:56,276 --> 00:38:00,322
and I thought, you know,
"Hey, we have a place."

350
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:02,658
So you made this?

351
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:07,371
Yeah. It's a work in progress.

352
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:10,707
And how did you learn
how to make that?

353
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:13,293
My dad.

354
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:16,463
Wouldn't it be easier
just to throw it, though?

355
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:19,675
Yeah, but that's not really the point.
The point is when I get it working,

356
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:25,722
she should be able to play fetch
even when we're not here.

357
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:29,560
Can you give me free pay-per-view?

358
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:32,521
Oh, poop!

359
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:36,775
Literally!

360
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:42,614
What is going on here?
I mean, who poops on the floor?

361
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:45,909
- Sorry. I need to work on that.
- How did you find us?

362
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:49,997
I followed the van
with the ears and the tail.

363
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:54,918
You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?

364
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,714
Why would I tell?
I'm gonna help you guys.

365
00:38:58,755 --> 00:38:59,965
- Really?
- Yeah.

366
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,551
I love dogs, and there's a lot more
to taking care of them

367
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:05,304
than throwing a stick and feeding them.

368
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:09,057
You guys need me.

369
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,648
I say she's in.

370
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:22,988
Okay. I mean,
how much trouble can they be?

371
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:34,583
Come on, guys.

372
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:40,672
Do you really think we can do this,
like, every day?

373
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:46,595
Yeah, why not? This is a piece of cake.

374
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:59,483
- Guys, come back! Come back!
- Guys, stop. Stop, stop, stop.

375
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:01,443
Treat! Who wants a treat?

376
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:03,320
Friday, no! Where is Romeo?

377
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:07,449
Okay, Heather, you go that way,
I'll go this way.

378
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:09,576
Aren't we supposed
to be wearing them out?

379
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:13,914
This is totally normal.

380
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:19,795
- Oh, so you think this is funny?
- No, no, not at all.

381
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:25,676
Actually, I was just about to thank you
for reminding me to watch where I...

382
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:28,512
...step.

383
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:49,491
You know, I think we might
be in a little over our heads.

384
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:54,121
It's 4-6, we're outdogged.

385
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:00,294
Guys, it's really not that bad.

386
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:03,797
I mean, if you look at it,
dogs have three basic needs.

387
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,593
That's eating, sleeping
and then peeing and pooping.

388
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:11,555
- That's four.
- No, I think peeing and pooping's one.

389
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:17,686
I've stepped in both,
and I'd have to disagree.

390
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:21,899
Look, guys, I'm serious.
I really think I can make this work.

391
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,359
How?

392
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:11,240
What do you think?

393
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:25,295
Thanks.

394
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:47,025
No, no, no, no. No.

395
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,919
Ready?

396
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,755
That's disgusting.

397
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:35,384
That has to be the grossest thing
I've ever seen.

398
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:38,929
That's awesome.

399
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:48,772
We just wandered in here.
I'm not really sure what that thing was.

400
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:52,609
Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone.

401
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:56,363
In fact, if you let me,
I'd love to help you guys.

402
00:44:56,405 --> 00:45:00,242
I just work down the street, you know,
I could keep an eye on the fuzz,

403
00:45:00,284 --> 00:45:04,538
could run interference,
massage your shoulders.

404
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,332
- Okay, easy there, tiger.
- Yeah.

405
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:10,752
Thanks for the offer,
but I think we got it under control.

406
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:15,674
Could I have a word with you?

407
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:21,638
All right. I've got to be honest.

408
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,600
I'm at a critical point
in my social development

409
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:27,936
and those are two fine-looking,
hot women you have behind you,

410
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:32,399
and let's face it,
you can't date them both.

411
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:34,902
So, who do you have dibs on?

412
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:39,448
Dibs? I don't have dibs, per se.

413
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:42,201
Gotcha.

414
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:47,039
Name's Mark.

415
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,167
Hi, Mark. You're on poop duty.

416
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:54,838
Okay. So, how many dogs
are we talking here?

417
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,884
- Just six.
- Seven.

418
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:03,514
What is that?

419
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:07,142
Actually, this is the newest member
of our family.

420
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:08,519
This is Henry.

421
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,396
The poor guy was scrounging for food
in the junkyard.

422
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:13,273
- Bruce, that...
- Andi.

423
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:15,859
Honestly, we have enough room.
We could take one more.

424
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:18,821
One more? We can fit, like, 10 more.
Think about that.

425
00:46:18,862 --> 00:46:20,364
Oh, yeah,
why don't we just wander the streets

426
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:25,410
and rescue every stray we see?

427
00:46:26,912 --> 00:46:30,415
That was funny.

428
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:34,253
Dispatch to 22. We have a stray
on Saint Andrews and Sixth.

429
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:38,674
Saint Andrews and Sixth.

430
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:42,010
Okay, guys, we've got a stray
on Saint Andrews and Sixth.

431
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:45,556
That's Saint Andrews and Sixth.

432
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:51,186
It's right near the pound, so hurry.

433
00:46:57,025 --> 00:47:00,904
Hello? Hi. Sorry to bother you.

434
00:47:00,946 --> 00:47:02,865
We were wondering
if we could have a minute of your time.

435
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:05,159
- Not interested.
- We work for the school newspaper

436
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,202
and we would love an interview.

437
00:47:07,244 --> 00:47:09,037
All right. You know what?
I don't have time for this.

438
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:11,540
You guys just get out of here.
Skedaddle and play somewhere else.

439
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:14,084
Okay.

440
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,462
What's the matter?

441
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:21,508
Never seen a husky kid
in a hoodie before?

442
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:26,346
All right, guys,
get over to the old railroad depot ASAP.

443
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:30,767
Over there. That's them.

444
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:36,565
- He's stuck.
- Is she hurt?

445
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:42,404
That's so sweet. They stayed together.
You okay?

446
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:44,615
You're safe now.
We're gonna take care of you guys.

447
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:47,868
Give me paw.

448
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:52,247
There's that white one again.

449
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:54,500
Let's get him.

450
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:59,046
Here, doggy. Here, doggy.

451
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:03,592
All right, come on, guys.
You're being rescued.

452
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:06,386
Here, dog.
Hey, come back here, you mangy mutt.

453
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:10,432
Hey! Come back here.

454
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:14,853
All right, come on! Come on, everybody.

455
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:17,523
Come on. Come on. Come on.

456
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:21,401
- Head to tail. Head to tail. Come on.
- Come on. Get across, guys.

457
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:24,530
Go, go, go!

458
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:31,787
Come on, trust it.
You can do it. Come on. Come on.

459
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:33,288
Good boy.

460
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:34,414
Passengers loaded.

461
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:40,045
- Heading back to base.
- Copy that.

462
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:18,625
- One, two, three, go!
- Okay. Okay. Go!

463
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:19,751
- Wait!
- Oh, what's that?

464
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:21,837
Hey, what is this? What's going on?

465
00:49:21,879 --> 00:49:25,924
- Thumb war.
- Thumb war? Any calls?

466
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:28,760
Nothing.

467
00:49:32,431 --> 00:49:36,727
Where are all the dogs?

468
00:49:56,914 --> 00:50:03,378
Thank you for riding the simulator.
Please exit for the next customer.

469
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,839
Out!

470
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:09,051
Next.

471
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:19,186
And please keep your paws
inside the vehicle at all times.

472
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,416
Come on. Come on. Come on.

473
00:51:22,457 --> 00:51:28,672
There's gotta be something
you like to do.

474
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:51,445
Go get her. Go get her.

475
00:53:06,937 --> 00:53:10,149
I'll get it.

476
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:14,236
- Bernie.
- Oh, hey, Bernie.

477
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:16,113
Excellent. Bernie.

478
00:53:16,155 --> 00:53:18,824
Carl, Lois, I'm gonna borrow the kids
for a second, is that okay?

479
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:22,327
I don't know if you heard, but Lois and I
got a gig this weekend. Paid.

480
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:23,871
Wow. Really?

481
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:27,040
I'm gonna RSVP you and the missus
as a yes, right?

482
00:53:27,082 --> 00:53:30,294
I'm not sure that I'm actually gonna
be able to make it.

483
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:32,546
What about that friend of yours
that owns the club?

484
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:33,839
Oh, yeah, he's definitely gonna be there.

485
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:37,467
Yeah? Excellent.

486
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:40,512
- I told you.
- Yeah.

487
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:43,515
- So what is this emergency?
- Who cares? At least we're out of there.

488
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:45,142
They were about to start band practice.

489
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:46,560
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, Jason.

490
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:52,191
Hey, guys, I think I may have found
the perfect foster parents for you.

491
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:53,817
- Perfect?
- They're perfect.

492
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:56,028
They had two foster kids
that just went off to college

493
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:57,362
and they're looking for two more,

494
00:53:57,404 --> 00:53:59,907
and I think
you guys are really gonna love them.

495
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:04,077
So that's it, no more Carl and Lois.
You guys get packed, you're out of here.

496
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:05,621
Thank you, Bernie. Thank you.

497
00:54:05,662 --> 00:54:07,873
Best part about it is
it's only three hours away.

498
00:54:07,915 --> 00:54:11,710
You guys are free.

499
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:16,131
- What?
- That far?

500
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:20,969
Yes. What's the problem?

501
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:25,557
- Well, we really like the area.
- We've made a lot of great friends.

502
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:31,104
Yeah, and you know, Carl and Lois'
singing really grows on you.

503
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:34,858
You hate Carl and Lois.

504
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,861
Guys, what's going on?

505
00:54:37,903 --> 00:54:40,239
I mean, they want to make you
a part of their family.

506
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:46,245
Look, we appreciate
everything you've done, but...

507
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:49,206
Guys, you're not gonna get
another chance like this.

508
00:54:49,248 --> 00:54:54,127
I really think you should go.

509
00:54:54,169 --> 00:54:57,923
We'd like to stay.

510
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:04,972
Well, I...
I have no idea what you guys are doing.

511
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:10,102
We're really sorry.

512
00:55:29,037 --> 00:55:35,752
We're doing the right thing,
aren't we, Friday?

513
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:42,843
Hey. What's up, puppy.

514
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,179
Is everything okay?

515
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,640
Yeah, yeah, just... Just looking.

516
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:51,560
- You come up here a lot, huh?
- Yeah.

517
00:55:51,602 --> 00:55:54,521
I'm just guessing this is the kind of view
I wouldn't be able to afford

518
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:58,317
if this place were a real hotel.

519
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:04,156
So, what are you doing tomorrow night?

520
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:08,368
Sneaking out,
serving 60 pounds of kibble,

521
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,704
maybe mopping up some drool.

522
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:13,707
'Cause a friend of mine
is having this party?

523
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:17,586
And you could come and meet some
people you'll be going to school with.

524
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:22,466
The keyword here really being "people."

525
00:56:22,508 --> 00:56:24,885
Good point.

526
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:30,057
Great. So, where should I pick you up?

527
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:33,560
Why don't you just tell me where it is?
I can meet you there.

528
00:56:33,602 --> 00:56:36,605
All right.

529
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:48,283
That's dinner.

530
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:22,776
- Hey, guys.
- You guys ready for dinner?

531
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:27,030
Are you hungry, buddy?

532
00:57:29,992 --> 00:57:31,994
Smells great.

533
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:36,957
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

534
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:39,710
Thanks.

535
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:13,827
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

536
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:21,376
So, Heather,
it's kind of like a dinner date, isn't it?

537
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:32,095
To us. To a real family.

538
00:58:32,304 --> 00:58:34,056
- To us.
- To us.

539
00:58:34,097 --> 00:58:35,766
- Cheers!
- To us.

540
00:58:35,807 --> 00:58:38,811
Let's eat.

541
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:54,576
If cartoon birds and mice were ever
going to make me a dress for the ball,

542
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:59,122
now would be a good time.

543
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:07,673
- How long are you gonna be gone?
- A few hours, maybe. It's just a party?

544
00:59:07,714 --> 00:59:10,217
What if anything goes wrong?

545
00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:12,010
Bruce, you can handle it.
You can handle anything.

546
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:14,680
I mean, have you stopped
and looked around the hotel?

547
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:16,014
I could disappear for a week

548
00:59:16,056 --> 00:59:18,183
and you'd be able
to keep everything running.

549
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:21,603
Yeah, but you're not gonna
disappear for a week, right?

550
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:23,063
Of course not.

551
00:59:23,105 --> 00:59:26,567
Now, if you could just build me a dress,
then you'd be a real wizard.

552
00:59:26,608 --> 00:59:31,613
You should check out room 502.

553
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:26,460
You look... Wow, you...
You look gorgeous.

554
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:29,838
What, this old thing?

555
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,051
Here, come on in.
Let me show you around.

556
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:40,390
No! No, Lois!
That's my personal, that's...

557
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:46,730
- So what else have you stolen?
- Nothing.

558
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:50,901
- So you admit you did steal it.
- Never said that, Lois.

559
01:00:50,943 --> 01:00:53,070
You might as well tell the truth.

560
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:56,990
Do you really think
you could outsmart us?

561
01:00:57,032 --> 01:01:02,454
I'd rather not answer that question, Carl.

562
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:05,499
- I love your dress.
- Thanks.

563
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:07,167
Marianne, this is Andi.

564
01:01:07,209 --> 01:01:09,962
She's gonna be going to school
with us next year.

565
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:14,716
- Nice to meet you.
- Andi.

566
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:18,011
- Hey, Jason.
- Hey.

567
01:01:18,053 --> 01:01:19,263
- How you doing?
- All right.

568
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:23,517
- You guys already know each other?
- Yeah, it's Andi, right?

569
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:25,102
Do I know you from somewhere?

570
01:01:25,144 --> 01:01:28,397
Yeah, you live in my grandmother's
building with the Scudders.

571
01:01:28,438 --> 01:01:32,151
No, I'm over on Oak.
I have one of those faces, though.

572
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:34,611
No, you live with the Scudders.

573
01:01:34,653 --> 01:01:37,239
Come on, help me out here,
I'm not crazy.

574
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:41,618
They're your foster parents,
you and your little brother... Barry.

575
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:46,331
- Bruce?
- Bruce, Bruce, Bruce. That's it, Bruce.

576
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:50,836
Andi, what is he talking about?

577
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:52,880
Oh, my God, you guys, it's no big deal.

578
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:56,383
So I guess the Scudders have been
foster parents before, big deal.

579
01:01:56,425 --> 01:01:58,302
They're also our aunt and uncle.

580
01:01:58,343 --> 01:02:02,306
We're just staying with them
while our parents are traveling in China,

581
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:04,892
and we just call them our parents
because it is easier

582
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:09,396
than talking about
this whole long boring story, okay?

583
01:02:09,438 --> 01:02:13,150
I'm thirsty, anyone else?

584
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:15,903
Anyone?

585
01:02:21,533 --> 01:02:24,536
Andi, I...

586
01:02:25,704 --> 01:02:28,207
Andi!

587
01:03:47,452 --> 01:03:49,705
- Did you get a hold of Bernie yet?
- I'm on hold!

588
01:03:49,746 --> 01:03:52,875
Well, tell them it's an emergency.
Tell them I'm being stolen from.

589
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:57,129
Tell who? I'm on hold!

590
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:03,635
Don't think this means that...

591
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:08,015
You let him get away!

592
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:12,788
Friday?

593
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:31,098
- Hurry up!
- I'm wearing heels!

594
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:34,560
Well, so am I!

595
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:44,611
- I can't believe they own a hotel.
- Oh, God, Carl, you're such an idiot!

596
01:05:47,865 --> 01:05:52,161
Stay close to me, baby.

597
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:57,791
What was that?

598
01:06:00,669 --> 01:06:04,256
Don't answer it.

599
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:13,307
Hey, that's my wah-wah pedal.
No wonder my sound's been off.

600
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:15,726
Yeah, that's why.

601
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:17,394
This crap is amazing.

602
01:06:17,436 --> 01:06:22,357
Yeah, 'cause it's our crap.
They've been robbing us blind.

603
01:06:22,399 --> 01:06:27,321
Good girl. Drop it! Georgia, drop it!

604
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:29,698
- Bruce, Bruce!
- Let go. Georgia, let go of it!

605
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:33,577
- Drop it, please!
- Bruce!

606
01:06:33,619 --> 01:06:35,996
What happened?

607
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:38,832
Don't ask.

608
01:06:38,874 --> 01:06:43,170
What happened with you?

609
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:56,767
Oh, no!

610
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:10,364
- Let's get out of here. Where's the exit?
- Like I left bread crumbs.

611
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:14,409
Quick, guys, go, go!

612
01:07:16,954 --> 01:07:23,252
- Put the lights back on!
- I didn't do it!

613
01:07:24,378 --> 01:07:27,673
What is that?

614
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:36,640
- I don't know. Let's get out of here!
- Oh, God! Shut it!

615
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,110
Are you sure they said
it was coming from here?

616
01:07:48,152 --> 01:07:51,238
Don't know.

617
01:07:51,363 --> 01:07:55,450
Let's check upstairs.

618
01:07:56,368 --> 01:07:59,580
- Did you hear the cops?
- I don't know.

619
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:02,541
Oh, good.

620
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:04,209
Well, if those were cops,

621
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:07,671
we're gonna turn them in ourselves,
'cause I smell reward.

622
01:08:07,713 --> 01:08:13,510
I don't think that's reward you smell.

623
01:08:19,725 --> 01:08:22,019
Where are we?

624
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:26,273
We're in deep doo-doo.

625
01:08:33,655 --> 01:08:38,744
Okay. Stop breathing like that.

626
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:48,837
No. No.

627
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:54,760
- No.
- Don't.

628
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:21,328
Get them in there.

629
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:34,258
No! What are you doing? Friday!
You can't do this! No! Friday!

630
01:09:34,299 --> 01:09:37,636
- Bruce!
- Friday!

631
01:09:37,678 --> 01:09:41,098
Friday! Let go of me! That's my dog!

632
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:44,643
Bruce! Just go!

633
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:27,436
It's okay.

634
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:34,193
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

635
01:10:35,152 --> 01:10:40,157
- We're in a lot of trouble, aren't we?
- Yeah.

636
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:46,497
But Bernie's doing
everything he can to help. Okay?

637
01:10:46,538 --> 01:10:48,832
Look, is there any way
that they could just stay with you

638
01:10:48,874 --> 01:10:51,335
for a little while longer
until I can find a family that'll take them?

639
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:55,756
Not a chance. God knows
how much they've stolen from us.

640
01:10:55,797 --> 01:10:59,927
We have a lot of very rare
and valuable items in our home, okay?

641
01:10:59,968 --> 01:11:02,846
And we are gonna go
and do a full inventory

642
01:11:02,888 --> 01:11:06,683
and we're letting you know, all right?
This is an outrage. An outrage!

643
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:11,021
I'm suing you. I'm suing those kids.
I'm suing the state.

644
01:11:11,063 --> 01:11:12,898
I'm suing the guy
that invented shrink wrap.

645
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:16,860
I'm suing everyone!

646
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:23,367
So you're gonna send us
to that other house now, right?

647
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:26,286
That nice couple?

648
01:11:26,328 --> 01:11:29,039
- Bruce...
- Bruce, we're gonna be fine.

649
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:33,293
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

650
01:11:33,335 --> 01:11:37,506
Come on, Bernie.
You have to help us, please.

651
01:11:37,548 --> 01:11:39,800
Bruce needs me.
He's gonna get chewed up out there.

652
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:43,220
Andi, I'm sorry, okay?
There's nothing I can do about it.

653
01:11:43,262 --> 01:11:44,805
You can't separate us, okay?

654
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:47,933
Don't punish him
just because I screwed things up.

655
01:11:47,975 --> 01:11:50,435
Listen, the best thing you can do
for Bruce right now

656
01:11:50,477 --> 01:11:53,814
is let him have a fresh start.

657
01:11:53,856 --> 01:11:56,275
I'm sorry.

658
01:11:56,316 --> 01:12:02,322
Can't I just say one thing to my sister?

659
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:16,336
Look, Andi, don't worry about me, okay?
I'm gonna be fine.

660
01:12:16,378 --> 01:12:20,674
I was supposed to keep us together.
I was supposed to protect us.

661
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:24,344
Andi, we had to protect the dogs.

662
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:32,186
If I had to do it over again,
I'd do the exact same thing.

663
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:29,785
First come, first served!

664
01:13:45,467 --> 01:13:51,682
- Tomorrow morning for all of them.
- Yep.

665
01:13:56,895 --> 01:14:03,694
- We're gonna be busy.
- I can use the overtime.

666
01:15:17,476 --> 01:15:19,394
And which one are you?

667
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:23,315
They must have left you behind.
You're the lucky one.

668
01:15:23,357 --> 01:15:27,069
Come here, buddy.

669
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:31,258
I know how to sit,
how to fetch and how to roll over.

670
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:35,846
What I don't know
is how I ended up in here.

671
01:16:35,888 --> 01:16:40,976
Could you please turn that off?

672
01:16:43,103 --> 01:16:48,108
- Please.
- I did turn it off.

673
01:17:12,674 --> 01:17:15,093
Hey!

674
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:42,579
- You busy?
- Friday!

675
01:17:45,082 --> 01:17:47,459
Oh, good boy. Good boy.

676
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:48,627
So what's the plan?

677
01:17:48,669 --> 01:17:52,005
The dogs have less than a day left.
We've got to get them out of there now.

678
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:54,341
Okay, that's really
more a goal than a plan.

679
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:56,343
There's a no-kill shelter outside the city,

680
01:17:56,385 --> 01:17:58,512
so if we can get them out of the pound
and over the county line,

681
01:17:58,554 --> 01:18:00,264
then they're home free.

682
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:02,141
- Right.
- But we gotta move quick.

683
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:05,894
Andi, what happens to us?

684
01:18:05,936 --> 01:18:08,647
It's...

685
01:18:08,689 --> 01:18:11,191
Look, Bruce, it's not gonna be good.

686
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:17,364
We're gonna be in more trouble
than we've ever been in.

687
01:18:17,406 --> 01:18:20,033
But we're gonna save the dogs.

688
01:18:20,075 --> 01:18:23,495
It's what we're supposed to do, right?

689
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:26,081
Okay, guys.

690
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:30,377
Okay, so here's the pound,
and this is the county line,

691
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:35,632
and this is what we're gonna do.

692
01:18:39,261 --> 01:18:42,556
Are we ready?

693
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:45,476
Let's do this!

694
01:18:45,517 --> 01:18:46,977
Got sausage.

695
01:18:47,019 --> 01:18:51,398
Fire! Fire! Fire! Hello?

696
01:18:51,815 --> 01:18:54,067
When a young girl is screaming for help
and yelling, "Fire,"

697
01:18:54,109 --> 01:18:55,652
- you're supposed to get moving!
- I have water.

698
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:58,906
Fire! Hello?

699
01:18:59,281 --> 01:19:01,617
- Where?
- And they say chivalry is dead.

700
01:19:01,658 --> 01:19:05,871
It's right over there.

701
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:09,958
Hey!

702
01:19:11,668 --> 01:19:13,921
A bunch of kids eager to adopt, I bet.

703
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:18,967
- Where are the keys?
- There!

704
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:21,720
You didn't think we'd forget you,
did you?

705
01:19:21,762 --> 01:19:25,265
Come on! Let's go. Come on.

706
01:19:25,307 --> 01:19:27,935
I missed you guys, too.
Come on. Let's go! Come on!

707
01:19:27,976 --> 01:19:31,021
Let's go, Shep! Come on, let's go!

708
01:19:31,063 --> 01:19:38,445
- Let's go for a run, you guys, come on!
- Go, go, go!

709
01:19:43,826 --> 01:19:45,118
Checking out.

710
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,620
We're gonna get you guys out of here.
Come on.

711
01:19:46,662 --> 01:19:51,166
Hurry up, Thor, gotta go!

712
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:55,420
Let's go, let's go!

713
01:19:55,462 --> 01:19:57,881
Way to go, Shep! Good girl.

714
01:19:57,923 --> 01:20:03,929
Okay, the coast is clear.
Bring her on back.

715
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:06,140
What's going on here?

716
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:09,101
I know you. All right, let's go.
You're going to jail.

717
01:20:09,143 --> 01:20:10,477
Trouble! Trouble!

718
01:20:10,519 --> 01:20:15,315
We can do this hard or we can do it
easy. Let's go, missy. Come on.

719
01:20:15,357 --> 01:20:19,945
Keep your paws off of her.

720
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:27,661
Heather, save yourself!
Save yourself! Go! I have him!

721
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:33,417
Nobody's going anywhere.

722
01:20:34,459 --> 01:20:38,255
Get back in there.

723
01:20:43,886 --> 01:20:46,388
Keys.

724
01:20:51,185 --> 01:20:53,604
Hey!

725
01:21:01,737 --> 01:21:05,324
Okay, Friday,
you're gonna lead the pack.

726
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:07,534
- Mark!
- Yes?

727
01:21:07,576 --> 01:21:09,536
Thank you!

728
01:21:09,578 --> 01:21:12,915
Come on, Friday. A little faster, buddy!
You can do it!

729
01:21:12,956 --> 01:21:18,795
Follow the sausage, Friday.
Follow the sausage!

730
01:21:18,837 --> 01:21:26,553
- Well, that went well.
- Yeah, well, we're not done yet.

731
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:33,560
Come on, Friday, lead your pack!
Good boy!

732
01:21:33,602 --> 01:21:42,486
Come on, guys, follow the meat!
Come on! That's it, Friday, let's go.

733
01:22:03,215 --> 01:22:07,219
Oh, that's not good.

734
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:33,745
Hey!

735
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:45,090
- You guys, are we there yet?
- We're almost there, just up ahead.

736
01:22:51,513 --> 01:22:55,434
Wait. What? Oh, no!

737
01:22:59,688 --> 01:23:02,399
Friday!

738
01:23:03,066 --> 01:23:06,862
Guys, come back! This way!
Problem. They just went the other way.

739
01:23:06,904 --> 01:23:09,406
What?

740
01:23:14,077 --> 01:23:18,165
Where are they going?

741
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:23,295
Home. They're going home.

742
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:07,714
Block the exits.
Make sure they don't get back out.

743
01:24:07,756 --> 01:24:09,174
Let's get some more
Animal Control out here.

744
01:24:09,216 --> 01:24:12,511
- How much?
- All of it.

745
01:24:12,553 --> 01:24:22,437
We need all available Animal Control
units. All available Animal Control units.

746
01:24:36,618 --> 01:24:38,287
It is pure bedlam down here

747
01:24:38,328 --> 01:24:40,539
as authorities try
to take control of the situation.

748
01:24:40,581 --> 01:24:43,542
This scheme was supposedly
the work of several juvenile delinquents.

749
01:24:43,584 --> 01:24:45,919
Upstairs, right now, let's go!

750
01:24:45,961 --> 01:24:49,465
There's no need to get upset, Officer.
Animal Control is on the scene.

751
01:24:49,506 --> 01:24:51,425
All right, everybody,
if you can just let us do ourjob,

752
01:24:51,467 --> 01:24:53,343
we'll have all these
dangerous canines rounded up

753
01:24:53,385 --> 01:24:55,888
and out of your hair presently.

754
01:24:55,929 --> 01:24:57,222
- Stop!
- Can I get through here?

755
01:24:57,264 --> 01:24:58,724
- Watch out. Please?
- Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me.

756
01:24:58,765 --> 01:25:00,392
Oh, no, no, no, no! Not you again!

757
01:25:00,434 --> 01:25:03,437
- Those dogs belong to us.
- They're family.

758
01:25:03,479 --> 01:25:05,481
Yeah, we're not gonna let you
coverall-wearing goons

759
01:25:05,522 --> 01:25:08,150
take them away from us.
And you can put that in your report.

760
01:25:08,192 --> 01:25:11,278
Officer, would you please arrest
these young felons right now

761
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:14,198
- so we can get back to work?
- Fine! Just leave the dogs alone!

762
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,533
Andi! There he is!

763
01:25:16,575 --> 01:25:18,285
That's our dog!
You can't just take him away!

764
01:25:18,327 --> 01:25:23,790
- Oh, what do we got here? A puppy!
- Just leave my dog alone!

765
01:25:23,832 --> 01:25:26,335
Stop!

766
01:25:30,923 --> 01:25:37,638
- Okay. Now, who are you?
- I'm Bernie Wilkins.

767
01:25:39,348 --> 01:25:41,809
Social Services.

768
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:45,938
Okay, get them out of here!

769
01:25:45,979 --> 01:25:47,981
Come on, listen.
Can you just hear me out

770
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:56,990
before you throw these kids in jail
and destroy all these innocent dogs?

771
01:25:57,032 --> 01:25:59,827
I see no reason
why we can't hear both sides.

772
01:25:59,868 --> 01:26:06,625
Look. I'm responsible for these kids,
and I know what they did was wrong.

773
01:26:06,667 --> 01:26:12,840
But I gotta tell you,
I wish I had the guts to do what they did.

774
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:17,010
I've been trying to place kids
in good homes for 15 years

775
01:26:17,052 --> 01:26:19,429
and most of the time,
I'm not successful.

776
01:26:19,471 --> 01:26:22,307
But these kids,
they didn't make excuses.

777
01:26:22,349 --> 01:26:24,685
They didn't get frustrated
with the system and give up.

778
01:26:24,726 --> 01:26:31,942
They just went out and did it.
They saved everybody.

779
01:26:31,984 --> 01:26:34,153
They created their own little family.

780
01:26:34,194 --> 01:26:42,578
You call this a family? A bunch
of mangy strays in an old hotel?

781
01:26:46,415 --> 01:26:49,418
"Madison."

782
01:26:52,546 --> 01:26:55,340
Madison.

783
01:27:02,973 --> 01:27:04,892
"August 3rd,

784
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:10,564
"found hiding in a backyard after the
family moved away and left her behind."

785
01:27:10,606 --> 01:27:15,235
Viola and Sebastian, the twins.

786
01:27:15,277 --> 01:27:17,237
"Together since they were puppies.

787
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:19,031
"Viola got snagged on a fence,

788
01:27:19,072 --> 01:27:22,910
"but Sebastian refused
to leave his sister behind."

789
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:25,746
"Chelsea.

790
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:28,707
"Chelsea lost her leg in an accident.

791
01:27:28,749 --> 01:27:32,044
"The owner didn't pay the bill
and abandoned her at the vet."

792
01:27:32,085 --> 01:27:36,465
"Coco, Rocky and Harley.

793
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:42,221
"Found living together
in the woods near a dump."

794
01:27:42,262 --> 01:27:44,097
And there's many more.

795
01:27:44,139 --> 01:27:46,600
"Ginger.

796
01:27:46,642 --> 01:27:50,479
"Henry, Romeo, Juliet.

797
01:27:50,521 --> 01:27:53,315
"Cooper.

798
01:27:54,316 --> 01:27:56,902
"Shep.

799
01:27:57,486 --> 01:28:00,697
"George"? Does that say "George"?

800
01:28:00,739 --> 01:28:03,951
Georgia! Her name's Georgia.

801
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:06,995
And Lenny.

802
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:13,585
Georgia and Lenny.

803
01:28:14,211 --> 01:28:17,005
They're the first two residents
in this hotel.

804
01:28:17,047 --> 01:28:20,342
The Hotel for Dogs.

805
01:28:20,384 --> 01:28:24,638
No one was turned away
when they needed a home.

806
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:28,225
Nobody was abandoned
when they were looking for a family.

807
01:28:28,267 --> 01:28:37,067
Are you really gonna tell me that
we're gonna just abandon them now?

808
01:28:44,867 --> 01:28:47,035
They don't look like
mangy strays, Officer.

809
01:28:47,077 --> 01:28:49,538
But you don't mind
if we take a look upstairs, do you?

810
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:55,085
I think it's in the public's best interest.

811
01:28:55,127 --> 01:28:58,338
Be my guest.

812
01:29:27,117 --> 01:29:31,121
- You did great.
- You don't think I was too pushy?

813
01:29:31,163 --> 01:29:34,458
I like pushy.

814
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:48,639
- Mark?
- Heather.

815
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:53,644
So, is this when the hero gets the girl?

816
01:29:53,685 --> 01:29:56,772
Baby steps.

817
01:29:58,857 --> 01:30:02,778
Do you mind if I...

818
01:30:02,945 --> 01:30:06,532
No. Okay, sorry.

819
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:11,411
You kids are heroes.
You should be proud.

820
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:12,579
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

821
01:30:12,621 --> 01:30:14,748
Yeah, but the bad news is, in all this,

822
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:19,419
I still haven't been able to find a foster
family that's willing to take you guys.

823
01:30:19,461 --> 01:30:21,922
That's okay, Bernie,
we know you tried your best.

824
01:30:21,964 --> 01:30:23,799
But the good news is,

825
01:30:23,841 --> 01:30:29,596
I have found some real parents
that might be willing to adopt.

826
01:30:29,638 --> 01:30:31,932
- Adopt?
- Yeah.

827
01:30:31,974 --> 01:30:33,308
See, the mom is excellent.

828
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:35,727
She's a teacher,
so she's really great with kids.

829
01:30:35,769 --> 01:30:38,438
And he cannot cook to save his life.

830
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:43,777
And he shouts during football games
like the players can actually hear him.

831
01:30:43,819 --> 01:30:48,323
But he has a great heart.

832
01:30:48,991 --> 01:30:52,161
Wait a minute.

833
01:30:52,202 --> 01:30:55,289
Do they like dogs?

834
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:58,625
We love dogs.

835
01:31:21,482 --> 01:31:23,400
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

836
01:31:23,442 --> 01:31:29,865
I'd like to welcome you
to the Hotel for Dogs.

837
01:31:29,907 --> 01:31:32,701
Thanks to the generosity
of the entire city,

838
01:31:32,743 --> 01:31:36,538
we are now able to take care
of all your canine needs.

839
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:39,833
Thank you, Georgia.

840
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:44,463
Room 320 is now available.

841
01:31:47,257 --> 01:31:49,927
I'm sorry, Georgia, I forgot your tip.

842
01:31:49,968 --> 01:31:52,805
Good girl. Thanks, Georgia.

843
01:31:52,846 --> 01:31:57,684
Whether you are here to board or adopt,
please note we are a green hotel.

844
01:31:57,726 --> 01:31:59,853
Hi, Cooper.

845
01:31:59,895 --> 01:32:04,399
Cooper, get back to work.

846
01:32:05,108 --> 01:32:08,529
Remember to stop by
our nursery and dog care center

847
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:15,661
and meet the wonderful pups
available for adoption.

848
01:32:21,208 --> 01:32:22,626
Hi.

849
01:32:22,668 --> 01:32:27,005
Tired doggies can rejuvenate
and refresh at our spa.

850
01:32:27,047 --> 01:32:28,549
We offer everything

851
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:35,556
from soothing shiatsu massages
to cleansing facials.

852
01:32:35,597 --> 01:32:41,353
And after a healthy workout session,
come visit our beauty salon

853
01:32:41,395 --> 01:32:48,193
to take care of fur styles
and pamper your paws.

854
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:56,160
We feature a variety of activities
for every dog.

855
01:32:56,201 --> 01:32:58,245
For those 18 dog years and older,

856
01:32:58,287 --> 01:33:00,664
we are proud to present
quality entertainment

857
01:33:00,706 --> 01:33:03,083
in the exclusive Hound Lounge.

858
01:33:03,125 --> 01:33:07,087
- Ruff, ruff, ruff
- Ruff, ruff, ruff

859
01:33:07,129 --> 01:33:10,632
I need a little treat

860
01:33:10,674 --> 01:33:14,928
- Ruff, ruff, ruff
- Ruff, ruff, ruff

861
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:22,769
- Who's gonna buy me something to eat?
- Something to eat?

862
01:33:24,855 --> 01:33:28,942
Okay, who wants well-done?
Because they're all well done.

863
01:33:28,984 --> 01:33:32,738
- Yes, well, we know. It's his one flaw.
- One flaw?

864
01:33:32,779 --> 01:33:38,368
Hey, I can hear you. I'm right here.

865
