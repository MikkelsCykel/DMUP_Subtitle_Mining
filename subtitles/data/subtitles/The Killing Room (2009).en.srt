<i>You understand what we're dealing with
here is classified material? </i>

2
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:46,235
<i>- Yes sir.
- Good.</i>

3
00:01:46,444 --> 00:01:50,406
<i>Miss Riley, why do you think
you were nominated for this project? </i>

4
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:58,706
<i> At the NSA, I specialized in military psychology
and was promoted to a senior position within six months.</i>

We usually don't recruit people over 25.

7
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:18,851
They're too hard to break in.

8
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,650
I base most of my work on
your theories and case studies.

9
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:28,694
So you have this ...

10
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:34,283
unique ability to break down advanced
physiognomy and micro-expression?

11
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:36,160
Yes sir.

12
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:41,791
You are able to tell if and when
somebody is lying to you?

13
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:45,127
Yes sir.

14
00:02:46,963 --> 00:02:52,552
That must be quite useful
in all walks of life.

15
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,932
By the way, my name is not Mr Phillips.
Is that true or false?

16
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:10,486
Your evaluation here today is pretty simple
and straightforward.

17
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:17,076
I will judge your reactions  to
a selection of pre-recorded material.

18
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:27,712
That means that your own observations
are very important.

19
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,383
But for someone of your pedigree
I don't foresee a problem.

20
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:40,349
You still have the option
to walk out the door.

21
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:56,908
Congratulations.

Hey, you guys are "native"
or "naturalized"? What would you be?

54
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:38,105
- Well, were you born here? Were you born
in this country?
-Yeah.
- So you'd be naturalized.

55
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:43,986
- That's what I thought.
- What's that?
- That's what I thought.

00:08:44,195 --> 00:08:49,367
But you’re not a native of ...
this country ...

Yeah, you just wanna check each one of
these ... right there on the bottom ...

00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:44,380
you wanna date it too ...

- Thank you.
- Yeah.

64
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:01,689
Observation, please.

65
00:10:08,905 --> 00:10:11,741
It's hierarchy and subordination.

66
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:16,829
We simulated the Gottan experiments
in Grad. School.

67
00:10:17,038 --> 00:10:20,917
We put a man and a woman,
a couple, in a room together.

68
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:26,631
And one partner acted superior; it was almost
always an expression of contempt.

69
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:33,513
And no relationship survives contempt.
Hierarchy and subordination.

70
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:44,190
I think you will find this
project a little bit more complex.

71
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:51,280
When was this experiment conducted?

72
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:56,994

Listen baby, uhm, I'm gonna be late tonight.

76
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:11,551
They have to drive us back to our cars after this.

77
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,681
So I would ask you or something?
Ah, go look by the bed.

78
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:20,685
Mom's check is in the envelope there.
It has to go out today. Okay?

79
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:26,482
I love you baby, and uhm, I'll see you
when this wraps up. Okay?

80
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:33,948
- You, you've done this kind of thing before?
- Yeah.

81
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:39,996
- What do they usually pay?
- Well ... it's ...

82
00:11:40,204 --> 00:11:46,460
you know, 50, 100 bucks. Depends on how long
they keep you. Usually about a day. This place ...

83
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:50,339
- I have a feeling it could be little bit more.
- Let me just hope ...

84
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:55,636
they don't make us take diet pills
or something, drugs ...

85
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:59,015
... something to turn us into zombies
or whatever the fuck.

86
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,394
In all seriousness, as a long time lab rat ...

87
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:07,607
... careful about wishing for things, you know.

88
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:12,278
You don't wanna hope for anything, 'cos usually
don't turn out that way.

89
00:12:14,197 --> 00:12:20,369
But I'll tell you what, the flip side of that ...
I don't know another job where you get
non-stop medical attention.

90
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:30,880
Hi!

91
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:37,470

94
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,465
Morning, everybody.
I'm Dr Phillips ...

95
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:17,718
... and I'm going to be your supervisor
here today.

96
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:22,640
But before we get going, I'm required
to ask you a couple of questions

97
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:27,562
and to collect these forms, which will have made
absolutely no sense.

98
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,815
We're all American citizens, right?

99
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:32,900
Absolutely.

100
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:37,822
- We're all of sound mind?
- Most of the time.

101
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,325
We're not crazy? Good.

102
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:46,414
No one forced us into being here today?

103
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:51,586
- No.
- Good. That takes care of that.

104
00:13:51,794 --> 00:13:55,923
Well, our little experiment here today ...

105
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:59,927
concerns testing quite extensively ...

106
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:05,016
the nature and the limitations
of the human psyche.

107
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:11,480
The test is subdivided into four
separated, escalating phases,

108
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:15,526
the first of which began the moment
I walked in through that door.

109
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:19,155
Oh, listen up ...

110
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:22,241
the final payment for the day ...

111
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:26,412
... 250 dollars.

112
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:31,000
Wish I was doin' that kind of money.

113
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:37,048
I do apologize for these consent forms.
I know they're a pain in the butt, but ...

114
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:41,093
... don't look at me, guys.
Wasn't my idea.

115
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:50,144
And a final thing: up in the right top corner there,
if you can write a contact number ...

116
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:55,107
What if you don't have a contact number?
- If you don't have one, leave it blank.

117
00:15:02,406 --> 00:15:08,079
If you don't mind, I would like
personal effects in these envelopes.

118
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,791
That's anything from watches, wallets, cell phones,

119
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:17,088
box cutters, hand guns,
thermo-nuclear devices ...

120
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:21,217
whatever you've got in your pockets,
please put it inside the envelope.

121
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:26,138
Stealth bomber, bazookas ...

122
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:31,727
- You don't have anything in your pockets?
- No.

123
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:39,151
My uhm, my girlfriend's supposed to call.
- Might find it best not to tell her anything incriminating.

124
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:43,990
You know they usually don't make us do this
in these things ...

125
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:48,035
Oh, you'll have it back by the end of
the day, I promise.

126
00:15:56,502 --> 00:16:00,006
How ... how many hours will we be here?

127
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:01,799
Oh, eight.

128
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:08,639
- What's that, $30 an hour?
- It's $31.25.

129
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:14,770
Are we going to be doing any tests
like that might make us feel uncomfortable?

130
00:16:17,231 --> 00:16:20,526
No, no. Nothing like that.

131
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,863
- I mean, you were tellin' me that before.
- What? I ...

132
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:27,658
No, no, I promise.

133
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:32,079
You know what? You won't be running to the john
every five minutes.

134
00:16:33,498 --> 00:16:36,459
Hey, back to phase 1.

135
00:16:37,502 --> 00:16:41,964
It is basically a process ...

136
00:16:42,173 --> 00:16:45,009
... of elimination.

137
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:49,931
We'll begin with all four of you, then
narrow it down to three, then two and so on.

138
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,308
But don't you worry ...

139
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:57,688
... the order in which you are eliminated will have
no impact on your final monetary compensation.

140
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:02,026
You will all end up with $250.

141
00:17:04,362 --> 00:17:08,616
Is everybody ready?
Let's do it.

142
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,540

- Kerry.

It is important for you to take it all in,

It can't be government.

The MK Program has always
been outside the government.

Outside everything.

174

The MK Program?

175
00:20:52,715 --> 00:20:56,385
That's not possible.
How can it ... ?

Patriot Act?

You can't just be killing people.

183
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:55,152
I've been thinking about it. Some kind of experiment
or something like that. Someone would have
found out by now.

184
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:57,905
- What if they're doing this thing completely in secret?
- It's not secret ...

185
00:21:58,114 --> 00:22:01,826
... no, it's in the fuckin' newspapers, in the classifieds,
right here, people knew about this.

186
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:06,789

we are? 
-No!
- 'Cos everything started looking the same to me 
after fuckin' Mansfield.

187

Well that was a long drive.

188

Nobody knows where, nobody has any fuckin' clue
where we are. And you know it!

189
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:18,718
- That's the whole point.
- Why? Do people answer this fuckin' ad to come and get shot?

190
00:22:20,511 --> 00:22:23,764
Look, I've been doin' this stuff steadily
for a long time.

191
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:27,435
Okay, but have you ever been taken
from one place to an ultimate location?

192
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:31,063
It's not uncommon. They pick you up, they bring you to another place.
But people don't just disappear.

193
00:22:31,272 --> 00:22:35,109
You don't think anyone's gonna know if
she don't come home tonight?

195
00:22:48,372 --> 00:22:51,167
- It opened.
- What was that?

196
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,961
What they used to kill her.

197
00:22:55,922 --> 00:22:57,882
Let me see.

198
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:09,852
- It's you.
- What?

199
00:23:11,562 --> 00:23:14,649
How do I know
you're not in on it?

200
00:23:14,857 --> 00:23:17,735

- No, he's not in on it.

Get him to talk about it.

One bullet.

212

There's one bullet
and there's three of us.

213
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:33,102
Maybe the purpose of the gun is not to kill each other,
but to maybe get out of here.

No, no, calm down, calm down, alright!

The language following the question
is purposely stilted ...

uses English as a second language.

Christmas.
It's fuckin' Muslims.

297
00:33:39,148 --> 00:33:41,651
They killed a guy on fuckin' Christmas.

298
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:51,202

300

No prisoners, hey?
Muslims.

301
00:34:22,775 --> 00:34:24,986
There's gotta be a clue in here.

302
00:34:25,945 --> 00:34:28,406
There's a way to beat these bastards.

303
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:33,077
The project is continually changing,
evolving.

304
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:38,708
You will help it to do so. As you can see,
everything is meticulously planned ...

305
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:42,461
... and initiated just like any other MK program.

306
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,839
It's an exact science.

307
00:34:46,382 --> 00:34:51,429
We have to stay on top of it,
we have to refine it, refine, refine.

308
00:34:51,637 --> 00:34:54,849
It usually took us 6 to 8 hours
to reach this point.

309
00:34:55,057 --> 00:34:59,812
But after we put those names on the wall,
now that really sped up the process.

311

Now let's screw it.

312
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,220
It's not that hard.
It's 7.

313
00:35:32,428 --> 00:35:36,516
1 to 10, that's the number everybody al ...
always picks. Why would it be any
different, 1 to 33?

314
00:35:36,724 --> 00:35:41,687
- No, because this isn't 1 to 10.
- No one can answer the fuckin' question, no one can
answer the question.

315
00:35:44,732 --> 00:35:48,903
Maybe, maybe it's 2
Maybe 1 to 3, 3 ... talkin' 1 to 33 ...

316
00:36:05,586 --> 00:36:07,839
- Fuck you!
- Wait!
- No!

317
00:36:12,844 --> 00:36:19,016

- Just what d'ya think you're fuckin' doing?
- Stupid, fuckin' stupid, stupid, you could've ...

318

bounced all over the fuckin' room.

he better start fuckin' thinking!

320
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,076

- He's not there! Get ... C'mon.

324
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:57,638
- Can you see him?
- No.

325
00:36:57,847 --> 00:37:00,766
What happened?
- There's nothing there.

326
00:37:00,975 --> 00:37:03,477
- You, anything?
- No!

327

And all the way down to the left there's a
staircase. Do you remember that?

592
01:15:40,461 --> 01:15:43,339
You take that staircase down ...

593
01:15:45,216 --> 01:15:49,011
... you take that until you find
the first emergency exit.

594
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:51,472
Pull the lever.

595
01:16:12,952 --> 01:16:15,371
We have to be prepared.

596
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:28,801
That's enough!

597
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:32,638
They can't grab hold of you, see.
That's slippery.

598
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:38,811
- You can't do that. I ...
- It's slippery so they can't get a hold of you.
They slip right off.

599
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:43,858
Maybe alright, the door opens, you
grab the gun and you shoot and kill 'em.

600
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:46,819
You kill the doctor,
you create chaos.

601
01:16:47,028 --> 01:16:49,530
- Now take your jacket off.
- No, no.

602
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:52,158
- Just take your jacket off, trust me...
- No.

603
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:57,788
I won't take ...

604
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:03,461
- Trust me, trust me.
- I can't.

605
01:17:04,712 --> 01:17:06,756
I can't!

606
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:19,685
4. I'm gonna say America has the
fourth, fourth highest average IQ. 4.

607
01:17:20,963 --> 01:17:23,790
- 4.
- No, you can't pick the same number.

608
01:17:23,699 --> 01:17:26,711
- 4, I was gonna say 4.
- We can't pick the same number.

609
01:17:26,712 --> 01:17:29,212
I'm saying 4.

610
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:31,864
Say 4, there are 4 on 5.

611
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:36,702
That way neither one of us goes to Hell,
and they stay the bad guys.

612
01:17:39,205 --> 01:17:43,343
Bite, grab into anything you can!
You kick, you pull ...

613
01:17:44,051 --> 01:17:45,962
- ... head butt ...
- shut 'em out there ...

614
01:17:47,046 --> 01:17:50,675
... and you just point, aim ...

615
01:17:51,717 --> 01:17:53,678
... fire.

616
01:17:53,886 --> 01:17:58,540
Point, fire, run. Point, fire, run.
Point, fire, run.

617
01:18:00,893 --> 01:18:03,146
We're gonna save lives.

618
01:18:05,356 --> 01:18:08,401
99 percent of it is
in your head.

619
01:18:08,609 --> 01:18:11,571
If you can you beat 'em there,
then you've already won.

620
01:18:12,864 --> 01:18:16,325
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not ... "

621
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:21,956
- Man, man.
- Two minutes.

622
01:18:26,043 --> 01:18:29,255
We're gonna save lives. We're gonna
save lives.

623
01:18:32,425 --> 01:18:36,220
Tell me what you know
about apoptosis.

624
01:18:37,513 --> 01:18:42,768
<i>All Echoes: Mother has locked in candidate designation.

626
01:18:47,482 --> 01:18:51,444
It is a mechanism in the human body
where an inferior cell realizes ...

627
01:18:51,652 --> 01:18:53,563
... it's detrimental to the system ...

628
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:59,076
... a cell willing to sacrifice itself
for the greater good.

629
01:19:00,578 --> 01:19:06,542
One of us has to survive and let
people know that these fuckers are here.

630
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:09,462
Right now they're here.

631
01:19:17,512 --> 01:19:20,431
It jumped another 30 seconds.

643
01:21:16,297 --> 01:21:20,551
Our program here
successfully proves ...

644
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:26,307
... that one out of twenty ordinary
Americans have the disposition ...

645
01:21:26,516 --> 01:21:29,685
... to become a civilian weapon.

646
01:21:37,235 --> 01:21:40,863
A civilian willing to kill
themselves for their country ...

647
01:21:41,072 --> 01:21:45,868
... a civilian guaranteeing to take
his own life for our country.

648
01:22:01,467 --> 01:22:04,237
So you're creating American
suicide bombers?

649
01:22:04,246 --> 01:22:09,142
Parachuting down a couple of guys in fatigue
waving an American flag doesn't work anymore.

650
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:14,021
We're adapting, adapting fast.

651
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:18,067
And where do we draw the line?

652
01:22:19,277 --> 01:22:22,029
We have to fight fire with fire.

653
01:22:24,365 --> 01:22:27,410
There is no more line.

654
01:22:32,331 --> 01:22:36,736
