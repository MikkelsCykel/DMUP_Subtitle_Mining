00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,484
<i>Don't go to sleep.</i>
<i>He's waiting for you.</i>

1
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:00,880
<i>Don't go to sleep.</i>

2
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,624
Hey! What's going on?

3
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,566
Oh, man.

4
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,897
-Well?
-He's here.

5
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,172
Who's here?

6
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,735
He came out of the closet.

7
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,809
Tim, nobody's here.
What are you talking about?

8
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:37,977
Him.

9
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,282
Okay.

10
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,523
Tim.

11
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,428
It's just a story. Okay? He's not real.

12
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,702
Well, let's have a look around, then,
shall we?

13
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,139
No.

14
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,617
Nothing back here.

15
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,482
Okay.

16
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,191
Hello.

17
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,729
Nope.

18
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,469
Nobody home.

19
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,206
Just us.

20
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,860
No!

21
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,725
This is gonna get ugly.

22
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,630
No more vodka.

23
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,232
Hey, Tim. Let me have
one of those green things.

24
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,305
Careful. No more for Pam.

25
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,276
Hey. It's my party.

26
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,110
You still on for this weekend?

27
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,809
No, thought I'd wrangle up
a dinner invitation...

28
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:57,547
...from one of those art-department
girls. Like this one right here.

29
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,555
-Here you go.
-Oh, hey, thank you.

30
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:00,954
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

31
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:05,188
Hey, Scotty, did Tim tell you about
meeting my parents tomorrow?

32
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,196
Meeting the folks? Sounds serious.

33
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,393
Yeah, if he can survive the weekend
with Jessica's father.

34
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,630
Oh, come on. Dad's not that bad.
Don't listen to that.

35
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,798
-He tried to drown you.
-You shouldn't have told her.

36
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,035
I was 7.
He was teaching me to swim.

37
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,770
By throwing you in a lake?

38
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,677
You know, this might be
a good time for a toast.

39
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,750
-Yeah?
-Yeah. I'd say.

40
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,647
Excuse me, everyone.

41
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,220
When we come back
from Thanksgiving on Monday...

42
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,153
...things will be a lot different.

43
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,724
For starters...

44
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,157
...it'll be a lot quieter.

45
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,522
But it definitely won't be as much fun.

46
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,196
<i>The Daily News</i> is lucky to get you.

47
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,267
Cheers.

48
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,206
Okay, break it up.

49
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,503
-Be good, Jess.
-I will.

50
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,441
I'm gonna miss you.

51
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,582
All of you.

52
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,381
I'm gonna miss you too.

53
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,913
So I told my parents I'd be there by 11.

54
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,183
All right, I'll get your coat.

55
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,223
Thank you.

56
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,084
Hey.

57
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,884
-Hey, Jess.
-Hey.

58
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,522
Not getting weird on me again,
are you?

59
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:49,725
No, no. I just spaced out for a second.

60
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,997
Okay.

61
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,036
<i>Where's your car?</i>

62
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,438
It wouldn't start.

63
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,045
-Is it gonna make it?
-I got a guy looking at it.

64
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,012
If you think you can use
the "car broke down" excuse...

65
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:07,675
-...to get out of this, you're mistaken.
-I'll be there, I promise.

66
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,378
Okay.

67
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,585
So you want a ride home?

68
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,659
No, I'm good. I'll cut through the park.

69
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,126
-Besides, I've seen your driving.
-Yeah, okay.

70
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,935
-Be careful.
-I'll be fine.

71
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,806
See you tomorrow.

72
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,885
I don't--
Who would have done this?

73
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,526
Who would've taken...?

74
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,992
Who would--?
Who would take him?

75
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,621
Why would they do this?
Where is he?

76
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,821
<i>Tim, it's Uncle Mike</i>.

77
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,990
<i>I know you're having Thanksgiving</i>
<i>with your girlfriend and all...</i>

78
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:39,331
<i>...but it'd be nice if you could make it</i>
<i>out to see your mom this weekend</i>.

79
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:43,839
<i>She's not doing so well, and, you</i>
<i>know, it'd be good for her to see you</i>.

80
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,744
<i>And, hey, I got some stuff</i>
<i>for you to sign too, house stuff</i>.

81
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,043
<i>All right, hope I see you this weekend</i>.

82
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,478
-Hey, you made it.
-Hey.

83
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,240
Hey.

84
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:28,217
-Were the directions okay?
-Perfect. Here.

85
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,615
-Come on.
-Wait, wait.

86
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,280
Shouldn't we wait for the bellhop
or something?

87
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,916
Shut up. It's their house, not mine.

88
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,562
What's with the tie?

89
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,392
I figured, meeting the family.
Why not, right?

90
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:44,161
Come on. Let's put your stuff
in the guestroom.

91
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,464
<i>So Jessica tells us you two met</i>
<i>at the magazine.</i>

92
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,576
-Are you in the art department?
-I'm an associate editor.

93
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,975
-Sounds impressive.
-It's just a glorified fact-checker.

94
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,615
-Tim's very good at his job.
-How about family?

95
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:00,343
Got any family nearby?
Any brothers, sisters?

96
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,646
No, sir. No brothers or sisters,
just me.

97
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,188
-How about your folks?
-Let the boy eat.

98
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,325
-We're just talking, Mother.
-Dad.

99
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,858
The family thing's kind of
complicated, sir.

100
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,521
This stuffing is delicious, Chelsea.

101
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,793
Tim's had kind of a strained
relationship with his parents.

102
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,403
-Tim's father ran out when he was 8.
-Jess.

103
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,006
Oh, that's sad.

104
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:26,201
Then he had to go live with his uncle,
in a tiny room in the back of his bar.

105
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,341
Well, what about your mother?

106
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:35,583
She sort of had a tough time
after my dad left.

107
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,556
It was pretty hard on both of us.

108
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,892
Is there anything else
you wanted to know, Dad?

109
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,161
Be down in a minute, Mom.

110
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,260
You have fun down there?

111
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,928
Oh, come on. They could use
a little shaking up.

112
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,097
You see my sister's face
when I said...

113
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,835
...you lived in a tiny room
in the back of a bar?

114
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,138
It wasn't in the back of a bar,
you know.

115
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:04,908
I know. I just like messing with them.

116
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,713
Is that why you wanted me here,
to freak out your family?

117
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,083
No.

118
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,156
No.

119
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,759
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?

120
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,225
Tell you what...

121
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,387
...I gotta go down, say good night...

122
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,090
...but I'll sneak in later
and make it up to you.

123
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,533
Okay?

124
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,938
In that case...

125
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,605
...l'll put on something naughty.

126
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,914
You do that.

127
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,710
I like this sneaking-around thing.

128
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,681
It's kind of dirty.

129
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,650
You all right?

130
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,991
Timmy.

131
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,153
You can't keep running away.

132
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,867
-Look at me.
-Mom?

133
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,765
Why, what's the matter with you?
Look at me!

134
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,530
Look at me.

135
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,368
Look at me.

136
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,244
You're a bad little boy.

137
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,875
Tim? Baby, what are you doing
on the floor?

138
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,148
Tim, what is it?

139
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,289
Jessica.

140
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,350
Oh, God, I had
the most messed-up dream.

141
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,088
What was it?

142
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,825
-I gotta go see my mom.
-Wait.

143
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,625
-There's something wrong.
-What?

144
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,199
-I know it.
-Tim. Tim, no. Hey.

145
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,304
-Listen, let's get back in bed, and....
-I just gotta--

146
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,997
-Where's my phone?
-Tim, what is wrong with you?.

147
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,005
-God.
-Where's my phone?

148
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,939
Just leave it.

149
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,174
Hello.

150
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,942
-Hey, Uncle Mike, I got your message.
-Hey.

151
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,552
Is everything okay?
I'm gonna see Mom tomorrow.

152
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,779
I thought you were here
for the weekend.

153
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,585
-What?
-Tim.

154
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:11,961
Okay.

155
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,767
Okay.

156
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,597
-Tim.
-I have to go.

157
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:25,039
-You--? Tim, what is it?
-Look, I just have to go.

158
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,660
So the funeral's today.

159
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,499
Yeah, this afternoon.

160
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,198
I'm so sorry, Tim.

161
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,968
Me too.

162
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,882
That's fantastic. That's really strong.

163
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,079
What's that you've got, Peter?

164
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:15,716
Oh, that rainbow is beautiful.
How many colors in there?

165
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,419
I'm thinking of going by
the old house.

166
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,456
-Really?
-My uncle's been fixing the place up...

167
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,467
...to sell since Mom went
to the hospital last year.

168
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,663
I felt like I should be the one
to go through her things.

169
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:35,904
I should've done more,
but it's something, right?

170
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,879
Listen to me, Tim.
Something happened in that house...

171
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,643
...but it wasn't supernatural.

172
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,481
There's nothing in there
but memories.

173
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:48,088
You dealt with your father's leaving
the best way that you could.

174
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,887
But you were 8.

175
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,896
Tim, you've been coming here
for what, 15 years?

176
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,931
Look around you.

177
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,659
There's only children here.

178
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,536
<i>Dr. Matheson to Observation.</i>

179
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,370
I'm sorry. I have to go.

180
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,879
Go home, Tim.

181
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,913
Spend one night in that house.

182
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,882
It will help.

183
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,903
It's okay. It's okay.

184
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:39,305
Hey, we need some help in here!

185
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,047
Hey, the nurse is on the way.
It's okay, it's all right.

186
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,240
What? What is it?

187
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,342
Just relax now.
It's gonna be all right.

188
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,414
It's all right.

189
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,074
Everything's gonna be all right.

190
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,531
And in Paul's letter
to the Corinthians, he says:

191
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,072
"We shall not all fall asleep...

192
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,472
...but we will all be changed...

193
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:23,172
...in an instant, in the blink of an eye."

194
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,408
"When my tongue rejoices,
my body will rest in peace...

195
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,110
...because you will not abandon me
to the grave.

196
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,951
For you, O Lord, have delivered
my soul to death...

197
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,687
...my eyes from tears,
my feet from stumbling."

198
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,127
"Thou knowest the secrets...."

199
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,277
"....spare us.

200
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,678
Suffer us not in our last hour."

201
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,985
"Dust thou art...

202
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:05,351
...and unto dust thou shalt return."

203
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,191
Thanks for doing all this.

204
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,488
She was my sister.

205
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,896
When are you heading back?

206
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,764
Actually, I might stay in town tonight.
In the house.

207
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,734
-I thought you didn't like that house.
-Yeah, well.

208
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,503
Tim, the place is a mess. I've been
doing a whole lot of work there--

209
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,112
I won't mess anything up.

210
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,309
Is that Katie?

211
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,917
Yeah.

212
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,119
How long has it been?

213
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,347
-A long time.
-You should go and say hi.

214
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,616
No, I don't think so.

215
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,750
All right. Suit yourself.

216
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,995
Hey, come here.

217
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,138
Here you go. You might need these.

218
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,973
Thanks for everything.

219
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,135
It's good seeing you again, Tim.

220
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,151
<i>Timmy.</i>

221
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:55,054
<i>You know, it's your cat,</i>
<i>and you're supposed to feed her.</i>

222
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:02,835
<i>Come on, Timmy, just turn</i>
<i>the light on. I'm not coming up there.</i>

223
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,339
He's scared of his damn closet.

224
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,671
You know why he's so scared,
don't you?

225
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,746
-Why?
-Because you freaked him out...

226
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,779
...with that stupid story of yours.

227
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,145
You've gotta be kidding.
It was a story.

228
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,379
-My dad did the same thing to me.
-Look how you turned out.

229
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:21,013
-It was nothing, okay?
-He's got a very vivid imagination.

230
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,183
Mary, this is ridiculous. I was just--

231
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,886
You're gonna put that boy
in therapy.

232
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,691
-Just calm down, okay?
-Timmy.

233
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,808
Cody. Cody.

234
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,081
Kate!

235
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,962
Kate!

236
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,766
-Cody.
-Are you all right?

237
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,697
Yeah.

238
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,929
I think I just hit my head.

239
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,134
He's never done that before.

240
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,974
Do you wanna come in,
put some ice on that?

241
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,245
Sure.

242
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,658
I saw you at the funeral.

243
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,987
I wasn't sure you'd remember me.

244
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,693
I'm real sorry about your mom.

245
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,464
Yeah, me too.

246
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:28,305
-How about that ice?
-Yeah.

247
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,611
-Sorry.
-What are you trying to do?

248
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,876
-I'm sorry.
-I'm in pain.

249
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,587
So....

250
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,421
So....

251
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,321
So how's the city?

252
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,887
It's all right.

253
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,555
It's been a little crazy lately, but....

254
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,528
You got a girlfriend?

255
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,931
Actually, yeah. Yeah, I do.

256
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,336
How about you?

257
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,847
-Do I have a girlfriend?
-No.

258
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,578
-No, I don't.
-You know what I mean.

259
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,688
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

260
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:15,286
Just me and my dad.

261
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,021
I'm sure some shrink could have
a field day with that.

262
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,725
So how long are you staying around?

263
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,459
I think just tonight.

264
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:29,299
I wanted to go through my mom's
things, you know, pictures and stuff.

265
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,341
-I found a goofy one of you and me.
-Goofy?

266
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,910
-I don't remember being goofy.
-I'll show you.

267
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,947
-It's actually kind of cute.
-No, I don't think. Cute, I believe.

268
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,683
Goofy, that's crazy talk.

269
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,687
I mean, if you said you saw
a picture that--

270
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:50,851
You know, that was stunning
or, you know, gorgeous...

271
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:55,261
...okay, you know, I've heard that
a thousand times.

272
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,492
<i>He took Dad, and now he's gonna</i>
<i>take me.</i>

273
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:03,197
<i>Timmy, nobody took your dad.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

274
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,402
Did you find it?

275
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,179
What?

276
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,179
Goofy photo?

277
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,485
Here.

278
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,320
Look at us. Even you're adorable.

279
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,049
Thanks.

280
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,660
You know, I was crushed
when you left.

281
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,664
It broke my little heart.

282
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:31,097
And it broke my heart
you couldn't throw a baseball.

283
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:34,705
You were the one
that was scared of closets.

284
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,136
-I told you that?
-Yeah.

285
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,071
I told you closets were nothing.

286
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,906
It's the thing under the bed
you had to be worried about.

287
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,676
All right, I have to go home
and start Dad's dinner.

288
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:53,150
I bet you don't have any food
in the house, do you?

289
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,792
-I'll come back with some.
-You don't have to.

290
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,396
I know. It's frightening how
domestic I've become, though.

291
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,066
Bye.

292
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,406
Hello.

293
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,115
Hello.

294
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,796
Hey.

295
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,499
You all right?

296
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,476
Wanna come out?

297
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,403
What were you doing in there?

298
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,551
You were at my mother's funeral,
weren't you?

299
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,321
My dad knew her.

300
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,658
What's your name?

301
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:30,883
Franny.

302
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,259
So, Franny, wanna tell me why you're
following me around?

303
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,498
I wanted to talk to you.

304
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,368
I wanted to ask you something.

305
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,540
All right.

306
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,443
Wanna ask me now?

307
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,680
Is it true?

308
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,819
Is what true?

309
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,187
The Boogeyman took your dad.

310
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:17,496
Look, I don't know where you
heard that, but it's just a story.

311
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,506
There's no such thing
as the Boogeyman.

312
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,449
I was trying to make sense of things.

313
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:35,124
My dad left. I was upset.
That's all that happened. Okay?

314
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,656
It's late. Your parents will worry.
Where do you live? I'll give you a ride.

315
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,563
Next to the park.

316
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,802
It's all right. I've got my own ride.

317
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,338
Hey, Franny.

318
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,544
Count to five.

319
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:02,442
When you're afraid,
close your eyes and count to five.

320
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,285
Sometimes it works for me.

321
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,692
What happens when you get to six?

322
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,535
-You gotta be brave. Come on, Tim.
-No, Dad.

323
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:56,731
Dad. Let me out.

324
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,206
Tim, stop it. Okay? There is nothing
in there. Just trust me.

325
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,403
Trust me. There is nothing in there.

326
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:08,049
-"Just count to five like I told you."
-Count to five like I told you, okay?

327
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,584
He's here. He's here.

328
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:19,587
One. Two. Three.

329
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:23,460
-Good boy.
-Four. Five.

330
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:33,533
He's here. He's here.

331
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:36,722
Tim. Where--?
Where are you going?

332
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:39,158
-We have to go.
-What happened to your face?

333
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,763
-Please. We have to go.
-I called your uncle.

334
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:44,457
-I am so sorry about--
-I want to go now.

335
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:58,505
Look, I'm sorry for losing it back there.
I just needed to get out of that house.

336
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:01,175
Hey, it's okay.

337
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:06,515
It's-- It's really late.

338
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:12,556
Maybe we should stop somewhere
and get some rest, you know?

339
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,500
How are you doing?

340
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:08,076
Tim, come on. I drove two and
a half hours to be with you.

341
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,058
I can't do this anymore, okay?

342
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:22,256
It's too much, and I'm too tired.

343
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:33,232
Look, can't we just forget
all about the bad stuff...

344
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,104
...just for one night?

345
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:39,179
Just try to have some fun?

346
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:45,484
Pretend that nothing else is out there.

347
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,231
Listen, why don't you go grab
some ice.

348
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,458
I'll get the bath ready.

349
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,632
We can raid the minibar
and have our own little...

350
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:04,899
..."forget about the world" party.

351
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,135
Okay?

352
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,474
-All right.
-Good.

353
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:22,351
Good.

354
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,975
Hey, Tim.

355
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:16,379
Hello.

356
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,438
Anybody home?

357
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,309
Tim.

358
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,555
Hello.

359
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,615
Brought you some food.

360
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:14,904
I'm coming up.

361
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:19,069
Are you decent?

362
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:56,109
Nice lighting.

363
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,374
Tim. Hello.

364
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:04,816
I'll make us a vodka Red Bull.

365
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,153
Tim.

366
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,221
I might have made these a little strong.

367
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:20,460
Listen, Jess. I just wanna thank you
for putting up with me.

368
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,177
Jessica?

369
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:39,851
Jessica?

370
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,800
Jessica?

371
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,275
Jessica?

372
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,677
Jessica?

373
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:29,299
Come on, Tim. This isn't funny.

374
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:37,062
How long were you
waiting in there?

375
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,074
You scared the crap out of me.

376
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:46,475
Come on, I made you some food.
Come on.

377
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,950
How did l--? Where's Jessica?

378
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:55,220
-Who's Jessica?
-We went to the hotel.

379
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:59,726
-The motel. And then--
-What are you talking about?

380
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,101
-I have to go.
-Tim. Tim.

381
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:08,303
-What the hell is going on?
-Come with me.

382
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,234
I need you to see what I see.

383
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:15,439
-What's wrong? Where are we going?
-I don't know. I don't know anything.

384
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:19,275
I don't know where I've been
or what I've done. I just don't know.

385
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:29,422
-Oh, God.
-What?

386
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:34,057
That's it. That's the motel.

387
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,051
What are we doing here?

388
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:01,852
Maybe you should go to the front desk
and ask if....

389
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,691
Jessica?

390
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,865
I was here.

391
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:41,956
What happened, Tim?

392
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,862
We were here.

393
00:57:56,906 --> 00:58:03,175
I don't know. I went to get ice,
and I came back to--

394
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:19,091
-He took her.
-What? Who took her?

395
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,526
You won't believe me.

396
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,766
Where did the blood
come from, Tim?

397
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:36,977
Who do you think took your friend?

398
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:45,783
Tim, if something happened....

399
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:51,119
-lf you accidentally did something--
-I didn't hurt Jessica.

400
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,760
Are you sure?

401
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:01,460
Everybody told me I was
making it up.

402
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:08,368
For 15 years. Ever since my dad left,
telling me over and over.

403
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:14,140
But I was right.

404
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:19,644
I don't wanna be, but I am.

405
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:23,953
Tim.

406
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,854
Tim.

407
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,681
Good night, Tim.

408
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,942
Kate! Kate, please open the door!

409
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:22,711
-Kate! Kate. Come out.
-Go home. Get off the porch.

410
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:24,750
-Listen to me.
-You need to get out.

411
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,079
Don't grab me.

412
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:31,458
-He's in your house.
-My dad is in my house.

413
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,290
He's upstairs, probably
waiting up for me.

414
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:36,923
Tim...

415
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:40,463
...I think maybe you're sick.

416
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:44,900
And I wish I could help you,
but I can't.

417
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:48,100
Now, if you don't go home,
I'm calling the police.

418
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:51,110
It wasn't your dad. I saw him.

419
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,843
I'm going inside now.

420
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:56,411
Go home.

421
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,621
You need help, Tim.

422
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:52,971
Couldn't sleep either?

423
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:58,007
I was looking for you.
You said you lived by the park.

424
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:04,011
Sometimes when I think he's
in my house, I come out here.

425
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,849
Sometimes all night,
until the sun comes up.

426
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,820
And everything's okay again.

427
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,826
What if your parents come
to check in on you?

428
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:15,987
I won't be there.

429
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:26,973
I told you a lie.

430
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:30,979
The story about the night
my father disappeared.

431
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:32,671
I know.

432
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:46,559
He took my dad.

433
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:52,031
Tonight he took a friend of mine.

434
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,505
He's gonna keep taking people.

435
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:59,641
Everyone who means
something to me.

436
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:04,209
I need your help.

437
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,948
Why?

438
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:12,782
Because we're the only ones
who believe.

439
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:18,420
I have to go home.

440
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:39,175
-Hello?
-It's Kate Houghton.

441
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:44,615
Listen, I was just with Tim...

442
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:49,449
...and I'm worried about him.
He's acting kind of....

443
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:55,754
Could you go over there
and just check in on him?

444
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,601
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

445
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:06,867
Dad? Is that you?

446
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:14,105
Franny. Franny.

447
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:20,122
I opened your pack.
I saw your pictures and the articles.

448
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:23,554
-I just need to ask you something.
-Okay.

449
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:25,626
How do you stop him?

450
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,128
I'm not sure.

451
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:37,429
I know that house.

452
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,934
I've been here before. Come on.

453
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:51,278
I used to come talk to the man
who lived here.

454
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,551
Everyone said he was crazy.

455
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,653
He said his daughter was taken.

456
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,423
What are all these words?

457
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:09,958
I'm not sure.

458
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:14,562
He sealed up everything.

459
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,307
All the closets and doors.

460
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:31,018
He was trying to understand it.

461
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:36,086
Trying to give it a name.

462
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,821
He sat here.

463
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,191
Waiting.

464
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:19,360
I don't want to be here.

465
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:39,582
He didn't seal this one.
This was the door.

466
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,923
He was trying to bring him out.

467
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:46,192
Franny.

468
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,990
We have to go back to the house.

469
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:05,207
My dad was trying to find me.

470
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:08,683
Trying to beat it.

471
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:14,251
You have to go home.

472
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:17,119
You have to go to the place
where it first started.

473
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:19,352
That's where you face him.

474
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:21,329
My dad got too scared.

475
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,927
He couldn't face him.

476
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:37,543
I wanna help you.

477
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:43,951
You can't.
You can only help yourself.

478
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,103
Tim.

479
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:15,240
Hey, Tim.

480
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:18,445
You okay, buddy?

481
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:20,645
Kate called.

482
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:23,519
Said things are getting
a little loose around here.

483
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:56,785
Uncle Mike?

484
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,016
Uncle Mike?

485
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:03,294
Uncle Mike!

486
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,593
Hey, Mike!

487
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:15,003
He took him.

488
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:20,757
He's waiting for you.

489
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,639
<i>Tim, what are you doing?</i>
<i>Get in here.</i>

490
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:17,615
Jessica?

491
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:20,244
Jessica.

492
01:15:57,653 --> 01:15:59,883
Jessica?

493
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,413
Tim?

494
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:07,691
Mike. Uncle Mike, it's me.
What are you doing?

495
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:36,250
Mike, Mike, I'm here.

496
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:42,259
Can you hear me?
All right, all right, he's gone.

497
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,899
I'm gonna save you. Come on!

498
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:48,934
All right, hold on.

499
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:54,036
I'm gonna cut you out, okay?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

500
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:13,684
--check in on him?

501
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,661
Thanks.

502
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:17,963
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

503
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:23,563
Dad? Is that you?

504
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:42,552
What was that? What was that?

505
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:50,060
I have to stop this.
I have to go after him.

506
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:54,396
He's leading me somewhere. If I'm not
around, he won't bother you, okay?

507
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,037
Tim.

508
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:14,021
I don't understand.

509
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:16,386
Tim!

510
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,996
Help! Come on, come on!

511
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:26,863
Help! Get him off! No!

512
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:48,213
I gotta get you out of here.

513
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,484
-Kate, come on! Come on, go, go!
-What? What?

514
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:55,893
What happened? Come on!

515
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,032
We gotta get out of here!

516
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:04,196
Come on! Come on, help me!
Come on, Tim!

517
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:19,684
Oh, God.

518
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:27,284
<i>Go to the place where</i>
<i>it first started.</i>

One.

520

Two.

521
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:33,934
-Three.
-Dad.

522
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,032
Four.

523
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:39,974
-Five.
-<i>My dad got too scared.</i>

524
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:41,734
<i>You have to face him.</i>

525
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:44,877
Six.

526
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:53,978
Tim, is he gone?

527
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,120
Tim?

528
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:12,003
What are you doing?

529
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,370
Come on!

530
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:09,619
Tim!

531
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:45,930
He's gone.

532
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:36,817
Is it over?

533
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:40,811
Yeah.

534
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:44,358
Yeah, it's over.

535
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:49,522
He's not coming back.

536
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:40,313
Mom?

537
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:42,210
Mom?

538
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:45,748
Could you close the closet door?
