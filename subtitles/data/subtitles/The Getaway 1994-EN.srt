1
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:20,592
- Now that's got some kick, Doc.

2
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:23,531
This P.P.K.S. is
a sweet little weapon.

3
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:31,206
Try not to pull
so hard on the trigger.

4
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:34,835
You're throwin' off your sights.
All it takes is practice.

5
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:49,615
- .38 is too small.
- "Too small," she says.

6
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:54,089
What d'ya say, Doc?

7
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:57,827
$300,000, that's a lot of money.
I'm tellin' ya straight.

8
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:00,768
- Sounds too easy.
- Oh, it is.

9
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:03,601
What we gotta do is break
his sorry ass outta jail,

10
00:03:03,673 --> 00:03:06,233
get him across
the old Rio Grande.

11
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:09,301
- What's the hard part?
- Collecting.

12
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,980
Not this time.
This here Mexican's uncle is loaded.

13
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,853
Come on, Carol, help me out.
Tell Doc it's a good deal.

14
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:22,516
We'll split the money 50-50.

15
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:25,755
You are kidding.
I'm on this job too, you know.

16
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:33,733
Got a smart woman there, Doc.
You taught her real well.

17
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:37,739
I guess she figures we do most
of the work, we get most of the cash.

18
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:41,274
Well, I don't
know about that.

19
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:44,404
- I'm supplying the plane and the deal.

20
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:50,280
- Without that, you got nothin'.

21
00:03:53,423 --> 00:03:56,586
- Which one d'you like, baby?
- I like the Colt.

22
00:03:58,395 --> 00:04:01,330
The Colt's mine.

23
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:04,765
But I want it.

24
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:12,401
Excuse me. I hate to break up
this beautiful moment here,

25
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:16,639
but I need to know
what you're gonna do, Doc.

26
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:24,185
Are you in or out?

27
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:35,688
- I guess I can take that as a yes, huh?

28
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:38,359
I'll think about it.

29
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:41,632
Don't think
too goddamn long!

30
00:04:41,704 --> 00:04:44,002
Do it myself.

31
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:51,776
- Hey, where's my lawyer?
- Mendoza!

32
00:04:51,848 --> 00:04:54,282
Come on out!

33
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:05,226
Step up to the line.
Turn around.

34
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,331
925, comin' up
on your right. Over.

35
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,834
Okay, I see you.

36
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:21,075
Up here on the left.
This is perfect.

37
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:28,416
You got three minutes
to pull this off.

38
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:31,545
- Once I get in the van. I know.
- Right.

39
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:34,749
- What?
- Hell of a way to make a livin', Doc.

40
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:38,055
Well, you should've
married a dentist.

41
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:57,772
You're gonna
telephone Gibson. Right?

42
00:05:57,847 --> 00:06:00,213
I don't know.

43
00:06:15,465 --> 00:06:17,456
Oye, Mendoza!

44
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:20,594
- Follow me. Hey, don't
forget to blow the judge.

45
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,367
Hey, Mendoza,
kiss us good-bye before you leave.

46
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:29,912
Come on, let's go.
The judge is waitin'.

47
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:33,081
Come on, keep moving.

48
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:52,094
1208, they're moving out.
Over.

49
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:59,165
1208, go now. Go now.

50
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:18,450
- What's she doin'?
Come on, move it!

51
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:28,237
Let's move
outta here, sweetheart.

52
00:07:36,713 --> 00:07:40,308
What the fuck you want?

53
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:55,558
- Hurry up!
- Officer, they got out of your van!

54
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:58,499
Let's go, man! Vámonos!
- Buenos dias, amigo.

55
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:00,968
Make a left here,
then make another left.

56
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:05,303
- Ya lost your cargo, ya dumb fucks.
- Adiós, pendejo!

57
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:35,070
Keep it running.

58
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:46,912
- Better hold onto this.
- Good to be back.

59
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:49,247
- Gracias!
- Let's go.

60
00:08:49,318 --> 00:08:54,255
You're gonna be a big hero
with my uncle, man. Mucho dinero.

61
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:01,589
- Hey, José.
- Hey, Luis!

62
00:09:01,664 --> 00:09:04,792
- Hey, Luis, bienvenido.
- Hola, Lupe.

63
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,036
- Luis, dónde has estado?
- Hola.

64
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,546
- Tio!
- Luis, qué tal?

65
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:25,253
Déjame verte.

66
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:28,916
Gracias por sacarme
de ese infierno, tio.

67
00:09:28,991 --> 00:09:31,721
Una cerveza
para mi sobrino.

68
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:37,065
Very smooth
piece of work.

69
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:41,661
You know, your job even got you on
the 5:00 News on the cable down here.

70
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:47,808
It's all there.
You can check it, if you wish.

71
00:09:57,386 --> 00:10:00,549
And thank you for bringing
my nephew back to me.

72
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:12,394
- Who could do such a terrible
thing to my nephew, huh?

73
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:16,365
Luis was a nice
family man,

74
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:20,876
but his accounts were short
for 100 million pesos.

75
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:27,174
Nice doing business
with you.

76
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:44,759
Ya va saliendo
del edificio.

77
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:50,200
- Fuck me! Let's go!
- Shit!

78
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:52,571
- Vámonos!
- We're outta here, boss.

79
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:14,688
Manos arriba,
gringo.

80
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:36,977
Gracias.

81
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:49,089
- May I help you, ma'am?
- I'm here to see my husband, Carter McCoy.

82
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:52,100
Okay.
Come to the gate.

83
00:11:56,873 --> 00:11:59,000
Vaya por ahí.

84
00:11:59,075 --> 00:12:01,441
Derecho.

85
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:25,759
Vente conmigo.
Tienes un visitante.

86
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:48,288
- Hi, Doc.
- Hi, baby.

87
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,494
You been doin' okay?

88
00:12:55,564 --> 00:12:57,964
Pretty good.

89
00:12:58,034 --> 00:13:00,229
I...

90
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:04,740
I went to see my brother
in Oklahoma, see his kids.

91
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:10,712
God, Doc.

92
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,214
Hey. Hey.

93
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:16,718
I think I've got a way
out of this place.

94
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:20,017
There's this guy
that works out of Phoenix.

95
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:22,250
His name's Jack Benyon.

96
00:13:22,325 --> 00:13:25,260
Controls a lot of action
on both sides of the border,

97
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:28,263
and he's plannin'
something very big.

98
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:32,597
- Lookin' for a guy
that can handle security.

99
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:36,035
Explosives. For the right guy,
he'll pull some strings.

100
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:38,505
Benyon knows about me.

101
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:42,340
You contact him.
Tell him I'm for sale.

102
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:47,081
Just get me
the hell outta here.

103
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:50,880
Can you do that?
Can you do that for me?

104
00:13:50,953 --> 00:13:55,913
I'm not spendin' the next
20 years without you.

105
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:04,632
Welcome to
the Arizona Biltmore.

106
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:18,476
Ooh. My, my, my.
Ooh.

107
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:21,948
You Doc McCoy's wife?

108
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:24,077
- That's right.
- Mm-hmm.

109
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:33,225
Jim Deer Jackson.
May I have your purse?

110
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:36,128
I work for Mr. Benyon.

111
00:14:38,734 --> 00:14:42,568
Mrs. McCoy,
I have to frisk you.

112
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,732
Huh.

113
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:50,470
Excuse me,
Mr. Benyon, sir.

114
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:54,581
Your guest has arrived.

115
00:14:56,018 --> 00:14:58,179
I'll call you back.

116
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:08,725
- I bet that made your day.
- Ah, my morning, anyway.

117
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,128
Hello, Mrs. McCoy.
I'm Jack Benyon.

118
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:19,766
- Nice to meet you.
- The pleasure is all mine.

119
00:15:19,842 --> 00:15:22,675
Sorry about
Jim Deer here.

120
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:25,873
Sometimes he enjoys
his work too much.

121
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:31,441
Mr. Benyon, I came here
to talk about my husband.

122
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,819
- Won't you please sit down?
- Sure. Thank you.

123
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,154
You care
for a drink?

124
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:40,093
Scotch, please.

125
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:44,030
- Rocks?
- Be fine.

126
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:47,294
How is your husband?

127
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:55,238
Prisons in Mexico
aren't very nice.

128
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:58,872
Even harder for a gringo
down there, isn't it?

129
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:02,406
It's a shame for a fellow
with all his talent.

130
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:04,851
I understand
you have a job.

131
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:11,558
- Maybe you could help each other out.

132
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:14,061
- It's possible.

133
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,155
Thank you.

134
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:20,527
Doc's in prison
in Mexico.

135
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:22,969
It's complicated.

136
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:26,633
I can get myself another guy.
Why should I bother with your husband?

137
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:29,075
Doc's the best.

138
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:31,705
Isn't that
what you want?

139
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,613
Yeah,
that's what I want.

140
00:16:40,456 --> 00:16:44,517
So just how cooperative
are the McCoys willing to be?

141
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:49,092
- Very.

142
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:55,433
You know, you deserve a lot better.
You're way outta his league.

143
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:59,773
How long's he been in?

144
00:16:59,842 --> 00:17:02,538
- Over a year.
- Ooh.

145
00:17:02,611 --> 00:17:05,045
That's a long time,
isn't it?

146
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:07,446
It's a very long time.

147
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:09,609
Yeah.

148
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:21,496
What's your name?

149
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:23,498
McCoy.

150
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:25,500
Sala, va a salir McCoy.

151
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:30,067
Esta bien.

152
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,509
Aeropuerto.

153
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:58,924
Arizona Air Taxi's flight
from Phoenix to Tucson...

154
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:02,368
will be departing in five minutes.

155
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,528
I'm sorry I'm late.
Did you wait long?

156
00:18:40,876 --> 00:18:44,642
No, not long.

157
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:54,413
I missed you so much.

158
00:19:07,403 --> 00:19:09,871
- But the...
- San Jose S...

159
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:13,169
...penalty applied to all...

160
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,613
Where is it, S...

161
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:27,144
I can't get
a good station on here.

162
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:40,201
I'm just as nervous
as you are.

163
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:02,244
Your best time!
Can we do this again on Saturday?

164
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:04,547
You bet we can.
No problem.

165
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,555
You better,
'cause that's the boy we gotta beat.

166
00:21:07,623 --> 00:21:10,114
Take her inside.

167
00:21:11,627 --> 00:21:14,562
She sounds good.
How does it handle, all right?

168
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,190
Is the steering
a little tighter?

169
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:23,159
Just gonna get a beer, all right?

170
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:26,674
- Make it a short day. Good work, Sam.
- Right, sir.

171
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,345
- May I get you a beer or something?
- No, thank you.

172
00:21:31,413 --> 00:21:34,348
Guess you don't mix
business and pleasure.

173
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,351
Me, I mix 'em all the time.

174
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:40,445
You know, your wife
spoke highly of you.

175
00:21:40,522 --> 00:21:43,582
You're a lucky man to have
such a woman to run your errands.

176
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:45,991
What can I do for you?

177
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:48,495
Dog track right here in town.

178
00:21:48,564 --> 00:21:51,533
A very well-built safe,
big vault room, just like a bank.

179
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,001
There's no money at the dog races.
Even the payroll is small-time.

180
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,561
This track's different.
It'll be there, trust me.

181
00:21:57,639 --> 00:21:59,698
- How much?
- Million, maybe two.

182
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:03,541
Maybe more. You see, I know
the people running the operation.

183
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:07,673
I used to get a cut of the action
until they decided they didn't need me.

184
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:10,240
They were wrong.

185
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,585
- What's the deal?
- I keep two-thirds; you keep one.

186
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:17,682
You take care of your crew
out of your end.

187
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,785
Pretty generous considering
I got you out of prison.

188
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:23,832
And I can put you
right back in.

189
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:30,028
Now let's go meet your boys.
I got you some professionals.

190
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:32,903
I like to use
my own people.

191
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:37,503
It doesn't much matter
what you like. Does it?

192
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:46,354
There he is.
Just like old times.

193
00:22:51,627 --> 00:22:53,788
Good to see ya, Doc.

194
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:57,093
Finally
let ya out, huh?

195
00:22:57,165 --> 00:23:01,625
Hey, I'm Frank Hansen.
I'm pleased to meet you.

196
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:04,069
You worked with Jack Easler
out of Galveston, right?

197
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:07,404
Yeah. Cops blew Jack up
a couple months ago.

198
00:23:07,476 --> 00:23:11,207
- Where?
- Uh, Baton Rouge. Uh, payroll job.

199
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,805
Where else you worked,
Frank?

200
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:18,012
I, I hit some liquor stores, you know,
and, uh, I drive real good.

201
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:20,919
- And I shoot nice.
- You shoot nice, huh?

202
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:23,514
- Where'd ya learn?
- Army.

203
00:23:23,592 --> 00:23:27,153
- Army, huh?
- Mm-hmm. I'm a team player.

204
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:31,165
You guys just do your job.
You stay clean, I stay clean.

205
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:33,827
- Real simple, right?
- Right.

206
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:47,114
This is the last time
you and I meet in public.

207
00:23:47,182 --> 00:23:50,674
You got any more business with me, you
handle it with my associate, Jim Deer.

208
00:23:57,426 --> 00:24:00,293
McCoy, I didn't wanna leave ya.

209
00:24:00,362 --> 00:24:03,297
We both know
you had all the money.

210
00:24:03,365 --> 00:24:06,698
Maybe I should've waited, but I
didn't wanna get my head blown off.

211
00:24:06,768 --> 00:24:09,236
What am I gonna do,
go to jail like you?

212
00:24:09,304 --> 00:24:11,738
I'm not the kind to apologize,
so I'm not gonna.

213
00:24:11,807 --> 00:24:16,039
Benyon wants me, and that's the end
of it. He ain't gonna back down.

214
00:24:16,111 --> 00:24:20,605
Let's just, uh, make the best of it.
No hard feelings, all right?

215
00:24:26,622 --> 00:24:29,557
- Boy, you're touchy, Doc.

216
00:24:36,565 --> 00:24:39,500
Don't fuck me again.

217
00:24:39,568 --> 00:24:42,503
- No hard feelin's.

218
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:47,937
- Asshole.

219
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,945
Once we wrap it up in the vault room,

220
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:54,176
if everything... I should say
when everything times out perfect,

221
00:24:54,249 --> 00:24:57,275
we've got the tanker in the field
north of the track.

222
00:24:57,352 --> 00:24:59,752
It blows.
There's your diversion.

223
00:24:59,821 --> 00:25:02,915
Inside the vault room,
two, maybe three guards.

224
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:06,427
Probably two accountants
in the safe area itself.

225
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:09,055
You got one guard with a.38
on your right-hand side...

226
00:25:09,131 --> 00:25:10,564
when you come through this door.

227
00:25:10,632 --> 00:25:12,896
That's him on the monitor
right now.

228
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:15,402
Let's take care
of him right away.

229
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,405
Be careful that he doesn't panic
and try to shoot somebody.

230
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:22,170
One of these boys does try to get off
a shot, this might come in handy.

231
00:25:22,244 --> 00:25:25,179
I been workin' ten years
without one of these.

232
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:28,307
I sure as hell
don't need it now.

233
00:25:28,383 --> 00:25:32,080
Might change my luck.

234
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:35,783
Nah, not for me.

235
00:25:35,857 --> 00:25:39,953
Suit yourselves. After that,
we're gonna switch cars at, uh...

236
00:25:40,028 --> 00:25:43,088
- Sutter's Ranch.
- Sutter's Ranch.

237
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:46,430
Now, once I settle up
with Benyon,

238
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:50,938
we're all gonna meet in Tucson
to, uh, cut up the money.

239
00:25:51,006 --> 00:25:54,772
Unless we're hot, in which case
we have to travel to El Paso.

240
00:25:54,843 --> 00:25:59,405
Man, why do we got to go
all the way to El Paso?

241
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:02,382
I know a guy there runs
a place called the Border Hotel.

242
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:05,386
He can get us
some passports and I.D.s.

243
00:26:05,454 --> 00:26:08,548
The stuff's expensive,
but it's the best;

244
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:11,558
get us into Mexico nice and clean.

245
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:14,618
After that, boys,
it's adios and good-bye.

246
00:26:14,696 --> 00:26:17,164
Why do we have to go in so hard?

247
00:26:17,232 --> 00:26:21,566
- We all gotta be John Dillinger for
this one. - Dillinger got killed.

248
00:26:21,636 --> 00:26:24,298
Yeah.

249
00:26:24,372 --> 00:26:28,809
Old Johnny got shot in the back.
Bang, bang, bang.

250
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:52,264
You all right?

251
00:26:57,739 --> 00:27:00,606
Benyon said
I was a lucky man.

252
00:27:03,912 --> 00:27:06,346
You are...

253
00:27:06,414 --> 00:27:08,609
a lucky man.

254
00:27:08,683 --> 00:27:12,016
Oh, yeah?

255
00:27:12,087 --> 00:27:14,851
You trust me?

256
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,560
- Yeah, I guess so.
- You better.

257
00:27:24,566 --> 00:27:28,662
Tell me everything's
gonna be okay tomorrow, Doc.

258
00:27:28,737 --> 00:27:32,673
I don't wanna spend
any more time without you.

259
00:27:32,741 --> 00:27:36,802
Hey, you're not the only one
that's ready to quit this life.

260
00:27:36,878 --> 00:27:39,403
- Uh-uh.
- Mm-hmm.

261
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:42,746
You spend some time in prison,

262
00:27:44,953 --> 00:27:47,444
you do a lot of thinkin'.

263
00:27:47,522 --> 00:27:49,615
Listen to me.

264
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:52,626
This is gonna be
our last job.

265
00:27:52,694 --> 00:27:55,595
You know that,
don't you?

266
00:27:55,664 --> 00:27:59,794
You mean it?
Really? You do?

267
00:28:20,455 --> 00:28:22,446
Get out!

268
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:02,962
The inside post
is held by the favored Shoo Fly,

269
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:07,468
the winner of the last two races.

270
00:29:07,535 --> 00:29:10,800
Second favored: B.D.'s Folly...

271
00:29:19,547 --> 00:29:24,541
And they're off!
At the break, it's B.D.'s Folly.

272
00:29:34,696 --> 00:29:38,359
- Jesus.
- Sorry.

273
00:29:54,182 --> 00:29:58,346
Okay, a couple more feet.
Go, go, go, good.

274
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:09,019
Come on, come on.

275
00:31:56,905 --> 00:32:00,773
It's all okay. Thanks.

276
00:32:02,744 --> 00:32:05,235
It is now post time.

277
00:32:05,313 --> 00:32:07,611
The lure is now in motion.

278
00:32:17,258 --> 00:32:20,250
There he is now, turning
into the back stretch.

279
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:33,567
They're reaching the final turn
and the home stretch.

280
00:32:36,945 --> 00:32:39,209
Three.

281
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:07,900
Ten seconds.

282
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:28,628
What's goin' on here?

283
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:31,563
The emergency power should've come on.
Why don't you close the vault?

284
00:33:31,633 --> 00:33:35,797
I'm just gonna find out what's goin' on.
You better set the time lock.

285
00:33:37,338 --> 00:33:39,772
- Ready?
- Let's go.

286
00:33:41,543 --> 00:33:44,444
Bill, the phones are dead.

287
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:47,276
- Watch out!

288
00:33:47,348 --> 00:33:51,045
Move! On the floor,
heads towards the wall, now!

289
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,384
- On the floor, head towards the door!

290
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:56,787
- Drop the gun!

291
00:33:56,858 --> 00:34:01,727
- Drop the gun on the floor!
Open the door! - Do what he says!

292
00:34:01,796 --> 00:34:03,957
- Heads towards the door, now!

293
00:34:04,032 --> 00:34:07,024
- My God, don't hurt him!
- Now! Move, move!

294
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:10,559
- Everybody, out! Out!
Move, move, move!

295
00:34:10,638 --> 00:34:13,573
- Let's go in now!

296
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:16,633
- Head toward the door!
- No, don't hurt me!

297
00:34:16,711 --> 00:34:20,272
We can't open the safe.
It's on a time lock.

298
00:34:20,348 --> 00:34:24,079
Don't move! Don't anybody
move, or you're dead!

299
00:34:24,152 --> 00:34:26,916
- I want quiet!

300
00:34:26,988 --> 00:34:30,424
- Shut up!

301
00:34:32,093 --> 00:34:35,494
Don't move!
Don't anyone move!

302
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:39,591
- I'm down.
- Down! Down! Down!

303
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:43,194
- Stay!

304
00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:56,046
Quit cryin'. Shut up!

305
00:34:57,919 --> 00:35:01,047
- Put your head down.

306
00:35:01,122 --> 00:35:03,522
- Ooh, nice legs.

307
00:35:28,283 --> 00:35:31,081
- Put your head down
before I blow it off.

308
00:35:31,152 --> 00:35:34,519
- You tryin' to be a hero?

309
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:37,558
You'll be a dead hero.
One minute, 30 seconds.

310
00:35:47,502 --> 00:35:50,938
Come on, let's go!
Let's hurry!

311
00:36:24,939 --> 00:36:28,170
- He had a gun, man!

312
00:36:28,242 --> 00:36:32,303
He was reaching in his pant leg for
a gun. He pulled it out of his pant leg.

313
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,315
This bozo was reachin'
for his gun!

314
00:36:35,383 --> 00:36:38,978
Stop pointin' that fuckin' thing at me!

315
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:43,085
- What, man?

316
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:47,184
He had a gun, man!
He had a gun. I'm sorry!

317
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:31,732
- Outta the way!

318
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:36,068
Slow down!
Just slow down!

319
00:37:36,144 --> 00:37:38,237
Just slow down!

320
00:38:23,891 --> 00:38:27,554
- You okay?

321
00:38:31,466 --> 00:38:34,060
I guess so.

322
00:38:36,237 --> 00:38:38,899
How far away is it?

323
00:38:38,973 --> 00:38:41,703
- Fifteen minutes.
- Is he gonna meet us there?

324
00:38:41,776 --> 00:38:44,336
- Uh-huh, he's gonna be there.
- Good.

325
00:38:44,412 --> 00:38:47,313
- Hold the wheel.
- Sure.

326
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:53,018
- Ah, God!

327
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:10,030
See ya!

328
00:40:07,828 --> 00:40:10,092
What happened to Hansen?

329
00:40:10,164 --> 00:40:13,600
Oh, he didn't make it,
and neither did you.

330
00:40:29,684 --> 00:40:33,211
That's what I always
liked about Rudy.

331
00:40:33,287 --> 00:40:36,120
He was predictable.

332
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,682
Let's get outta here.

333
00:41:35,383 --> 00:41:37,874
What's Benyon's place like?

334
00:41:37,952 --> 00:41:41,547
I don't know.
I met him at the office.

335
00:41:41,622 --> 00:41:46,457
Doc, what if we headed south
and just kept on goin'?

336
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:51,123
We got lots of money here.
Why share it?

337
00:41:52,366 --> 00:41:56,234
Benyon's kept his end
of the bargain so far.

338
00:41:56,303 --> 00:41:59,739
You don't owe Benyon
anything.

339
00:42:41,282 --> 00:42:44,774
Try to wrap this up quick.
If anything happens, you, uh,

340
00:42:44,852 --> 00:42:47,286
do what you gotta do.

341
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:02,185
Thought I might never
see you again.

342
00:44:02,263 --> 00:44:05,790
The news said, "One dead."

343
00:44:05,866 --> 00:44:07,959
Three dead.

344
00:44:08,035 --> 00:44:11,835
Hansen got jumpy and shot a guard.
Rudy got ambitious and killed Hansen.

345
00:44:11,906 --> 00:44:15,137
Then he lost his head
and tried to kill me.

346
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:18,076
How's your wife?

347
00:44:18,145 --> 00:44:21,876
Let's cut up this money.
I wanna get outta here.

348
00:44:27,054 --> 00:44:29,648
I don't like complications.

349
00:44:29,723 --> 00:44:33,022
Pull these kind of jobs,
you take those chances.

350
00:44:34,495 --> 00:44:38,761
You know, McCoy,
you and I are two of a kind.

351
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:42,929
No, I don't think so.
I like to do my own dirty work.

352
00:44:43,003 --> 00:44:47,064
I never much liked guys like you,
the crooks that wanna look respectable.

353
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:49,632
You still don't
get it, do you?

354
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:53,202
That's funny, 'cause I always heard
what a smart operator you are.

355
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,113
So let's just look
at the situation.

356
00:44:56,183 --> 00:44:58,879
One, a very
attractive woman;

357
00:44:58,953 --> 00:45:01,820
two, the woman's husband...
a killer and a thief...

358
00:45:01,889 --> 00:45:04,585
serving a long sentence
in a Mexican hellhole;

359
00:45:04,658 --> 00:45:06,922
three, a businessman...

360
00:45:06,994 --> 00:45:09,258
lots of power and influence,

361
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,322
a fellow who can easily
get the husband a pardon.

362
00:45:12,399 --> 00:45:15,732
Why should he?
Well,

363
00:45:15,803 --> 00:45:18,237
one simple reason,
the obvious reason:

364
00:45:18,305 --> 00:45:20,899
- money.

365
00:45:22,943 --> 00:45:25,104
Maybe there's
other considerations.

366
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:29,649
The wife is
very attractive,

367
00:45:29,717 --> 00:45:33,244
and she proves to be
willing, very willing.

368
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,313
She sees an opportunity,
and she takes it.

369
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:40,849
And who could blame her?
She's tired of life on the run.

370
00:45:40,928 --> 00:45:43,920
Her husband, he's a loser.

371
00:45:43,998 --> 00:45:46,330
She wants something better,

372
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,994
and so the inevitable happens:

373
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:52,869
a very...
intimate alliance.

374
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,432
A very pleasurable alliance,

375
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:00,640
enjoyed by both parties
vigorously and repeatedly.

376
00:46:00,714 --> 00:46:03,376
Enjoyed.

377
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:05,748
And then the moment arrives.

378
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:09,277
The husband is baited
to a remote place,

379
00:46:09,356 --> 00:46:12,052
a place...

380
00:46:12,126 --> 00:46:16,119
Well, Doc, kinda like this.

381
00:46:16,196 --> 00:46:19,893
Don't think too badly
of your wife, Doc.

382
00:46:19,967 --> 00:46:23,130
After all, you were
locked up in prison,

383
00:46:23,203 --> 00:46:26,070
and she is a stunningly
healthy young woman.

384
00:46:57,938 --> 00:47:00,805
I see you been practicing.

385
00:47:27,067 --> 00:47:30,002
Goddamn it, it wasn't my fault!
It was the only way.

386
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,732
You stupid bitch,
you should've told me!

387
00:47:32,806 --> 00:47:35,502
You were supposed to make a deal
with him, not fuck his brains out!

388
00:47:35,576 --> 00:47:38,136
- The deal wasn't good enough!
- Then you should've walked away!

389
00:47:38,212 --> 00:47:41,147
- And you'd still be sittin' in
that shit-hole! - I trusted you!

390
00:47:41,215 --> 00:47:43,775
- And I came through for you!
- Yeah, "repeatedly."

391
00:47:43,851 --> 00:47:46,342
Fuck you!

392
00:47:48,722 --> 00:47:51,190
You weren't straight with me!

393
00:47:51,258 --> 00:47:54,955
I didn't think you could
handle the truth, and I was right.

394
00:47:55,029 --> 00:47:58,294
You weren't sure which one of us
you were gonna shoot, huh?

395
00:47:58,365 --> 00:48:02,358
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think!

396
00:48:02,436 --> 00:48:05,735
- Then I'm sorry.
- Sorry you shot Benyon?

397
00:48:05,806 --> 00:48:08,240
No, I'm sorry
I fucked him.

398
00:48:08,308 --> 00:48:12,005
'Cause I did it for you,
and you're not worth it!

399
00:48:34,535 --> 00:48:36,969
Bitch.

400
00:49:09,336 --> 00:49:11,600
- Get in.
- Go to hell.

401
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:13,936
Hey.

402
00:49:15,075 --> 00:49:17,043
Get in.

403
00:49:23,117 --> 00:49:26,746
I guess you did what you had to do
to get me out.

404
00:49:30,457 --> 00:49:33,824
You'd do the same for me,
wouldn't you, Doc?

405
00:49:33,894 --> 00:49:37,955
You'd humiliate yourself
for me, wouldn't you?

406
00:49:39,466 --> 00:49:41,559
Wouldn't you?

407
00:50:29,483 --> 00:50:31,644
Fuck.

408
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,306
- Honey, there's a man out here.
- Who is it?

409
00:51:29,376 --> 00:51:32,971
- I don't know.
- Oh! God!

410
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:38,946
Okay, what's
the damage here?

411
00:51:39,019 --> 00:51:41,954
That glucose should start
to work in about a half hour,

412
00:51:42,022 --> 00:51:44,786
and you'll...
you'll feel better then.

413
00:51:44,858 --> 00:51:48,294
That collarbone's
badly shattered.

414
00:51:48,362 --> 00:51:51,092
There's no,
no infection yet.

415
00:51:51,164 --> 00:51:53,496
You should just, um,
keep...

416
00:51:53,567 --> 00:51:56,832
changing those bandages
several times a day.

417
00:52:05,145 --> 00:52:08,171
Looks like I'm gonna
need myself a nurse.

418
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,217
Get over there where
I can see you. Go on.

419
00:52:20,761 --> 00:52:23,559
That's better.

420
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:25,894
You know,
on second thought,

421
00:52:25,966 --> 00:52:29,663
it might be wiser if we just
leave those bandages in place,

422
00:52:29,736 --> 00:52:33,103
'cause I'm nervous about you
just irritating that wound.

423
00:52:33,173 --> 00:52:35,835
Is that what you thought,
Harold?

424
00:52:35,909 --> 00:52:38,935
- Come here and sit down.

425
00:52:39,012 --> 00:52:42,709
- Get over here and sit down!
Come here, Doc.

426
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:45,411
You think real hard...

427
00:52:45,485 --> 00:52:48,420
and tell me the truth.

428
00:52:48,488 --> 00:52:51,082
Am I gonna need more
lookin' after... or not?

429
00:52:51,158 --> 00:52:53,854
Well, there's...

430
00:52:53,927 --> 00:52:56,054
Yes, there's,

431
00:52:56,129 --> 00:52:59,587
there's a chance
of gangrene setting in.

432
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:01,691
- Oh, lovely.

433
00:53:04,404 --> 00:53:06,895
- All right.

434
00:53:08,342 --> 00:53:11,778
The three of us are
gonna do some traveling.

435
00:53:11,845 --> 00:53:15,042
Tomorrow morning, we're gonna
take your car and go to El Paso.

436
00:53:15,115 --> 00:53:18,243
No, that... that's
just not possible. We...

437
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:20,752
Look, we can't leave here.
Okay?

438
00:53:20,821 --> 00:53:24,257
We've got our work.
We've gotta take care of these animals.

439
00:53:24,324 --> 00:53:27,157
What do you say, Fran?
Wanna do some travelin'?

440
00:53:27,227 --> 00:53:29,559
Oh,

441
00:53:29,629 --> 00:53:32,655
sure, I mean,
whatever you say.

442
00:53:32,733 --> 00:53:35,861
- What kind of car you got, Harold?

443
00:53:35,936 --> 00:53:40,100
A Chevy.
We have a Chevy Suburban.

444
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:43,665
Oh, that's nice.
I like Chevies.

445
00:53:43,744 --> 00:53:47,145
Why don't you go outside
and gas it up?

446
00:53:47,214 --> 00:53:49,944
Check the tires
and check the oil.

447
00:53:50,016 --> 00:53:52,450
Make sure
it's gonna run real good,

448
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:54,953
'cause I don't want
any trouble on the road.

449
00:53:55,021 --> 00:53:57,956
And if you come back
in here with anyone else,

450
00:53:58,024 --> 00:54:00,891
I'm gonna stop her clock.

451
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:03,156
You got that?
She dies.

452
00:54:04,664 --> 00:54:07,895
You do what he says,
Harold.

453
00:54:07,968 --> 00:54:11,131
That's right, Harold.
Now go on.

454
00:54:11,204 --> 00:54:13,468
Get the fuck outta here.

455
00:54:20,514 --> 00:54:23,972
Come here, honey.
Come here, polka dots. Sit down.

456
00:54:31,992 --> 00:54:34,187
What's his name?

457
00:54:35,629 --> 00:54:37,790
Kitty.

458
00:54:37,864 --> 00:54:40,332
He's cute,

459
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,233
and so are you.

460
00:54:49,509 --> 00:54:52,637
- How long has he been dead?
- A few hours, at least.

461
00:54:52,712 --> 00:54:55,180
Hell, they're probably halfway
to Mexico.

462
00:54:55,248 --> 00:54:58,183
Hansen said they was
gonna split the money up in Tucson,

463
00:54:58,251 --> 00:55:01,414
but if they got hot, they'd head
to El Paso, the Border Hotel.

464
00:55:01,488 --> 00:55:03,683
Check both places.

465
00:55:03,757 --> 00:55:06,191
Put out the word.

466
00:55:06,259 --> 00:55:08,853
- I know somebody's got our money.
- What about Benyon?

467
00:55:08,929 --> 00:55:11,830
There's a dry well
about a mile from here.

468
00:55:11,898 --> 00:55:14,526
Jack deserves a proper burial.

469
00:55:16,203 --> 00:55:19,036
You just do what I tell you.

470
00:55:23,477 --> 00:55:25,638
The huge explosion of a tanker truck,

471
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:28,443
which panicked nearby spectators,

472
00:55:28,515 --> 00:55:30,983
was all part of the extremely
well-organized robbery.

473
00:55:31,017 --> 00:55:34,248
Reporter Roscoe Serra was
on the scene within minutes.

474
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:37,757
We go now to his taped report
from the dog track earlier today.

475
00:55:37,824 --> 00:55:40,588
A lot of folks were at the dog track
today trying to get a little lucky,

476
00:55:40,627 --> 00:55:43,425
but it seems that some people
got a little luckier than most.

477
00:55:43,463 --> 00:55:47,695
This explosion appears to have been
a decoy for a large robbery here.

478
00:55:47,767 --> 00:55:51,999
Details are sketchy, but this is what
we know: One guard has been killed.

479
00:55:52,072 --> 00:55:54,302
Police officials believe
this is the work of experts.

480
00:55:54,341 --> 00:55:58,937
They knew what they were doing, but they
don't know who pulled this robbery off.

481
00:55:59,012 --> 00:56:01,572
Fuckin' pinhead Hansen.

482
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:08,214
I say that we dump that wagon right now
and hop on that train to El Paso.

483
00:56:08,288 --> 00:56:11,223
- We still headin' to Gollie's?
- We gotta get some new passports.

484
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:13,384
You got a better idea?

485
00:56:15,095 --> 00:56:17,689
- You okay?
- Sure.

486
00:56:17,764 --> 00:56:20,597
- Don't I seem okay?
- I don't know.

487
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:21,463
If you were still
pissed at me,

488
00:56:21,501 --> 00:56:24,595
I probably wouldn't
know anything about it.

489
00:56:24,671 --> 00:56:27,606
You'd just act like everything
was all right anyway.

490
00:56:27,674 --> 00:56:30,472
I'm not followin' you.

491
00:56:30,544 --> 00:56:34,571
You'd want me to think you'd forgotten,
even if you hadn't.

492
00:56:37,651 --> 00:56:39,778
I don't trust you, Doc.

493
00:56:39,853 --> 00:56:41,946
Hey, I got an idea.

494
00:56:42,022 --> 00:56:44,855
Here, this ought to prove something
to you. Take your gun back.

495
00:56:44,925 --> 00:56:48,326
- Go on, take it.
- It's not loaded.

496
00:56:48,395 --> 00:56:52,957
Oh, that's right, you emptied it
into Benyon. Here, take mine. Go ahead.

497
00:56:53,033 --> 00:56:56,400
- I don't want it.
- Go on!

498
00:56:56,469 --> 00:56:58,767
I don't want it.

499
00:57:03,777 --> 00:57:06,041
Got plenty of money here.

500
00:57:06,112 --> 00:57:09,570
Go wherever you wanna go.

501
00:57:29,469 --> 00:57:32,734
I found you one of
Harold's T-shirts.

502
00:57:32,806 --> 00:57:36,742
Could be a little small
for your body, but it's clean.

503
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:55,227
Ooh! Let me have that.

504
00:58:02,769 --> 00:58:06,205
I wouldn't worry too much
about Harold if I were you.

505
00:58:06,272 --> 00:58:10,208
He's not gonna bring anyone back here.
He's harmless.

506
00:58:11,611 --> 00:58:14,512
Well, ain't
that the truth.

507
00:58:14,581 --> 00:58:17,641
How long you two been married?

508
00:58:17,717 --> 00:58:20,083
- Two years.
- Hmm.

509
00:58:20,153 --> 00:58:23,520
An exciting two years
I'll bet it's been,

510
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:27,890
hangin' around this place,
fixin' up poor little doggies.

511
00:58:27,961 --> 00:58:30,259
Hmm.

512
00:58:34,134 --> 00:58:36,068
Come here.

513
00:58:38,505 --> 00:58:40,803
Look,

514
00:58:40,874 --> 00:58:43,809
I'm not gonna be
any trouble to you.

515
00:58:43,877 --> 00:58:48,814
The fact is, this may sound kinda funny,
but I was thinkin' that...

516
00:58:48,882 --> 00:58:51,112
maybe you and I could be friends.

517
00:58:51,184 --> 00:58:55,518
Been my experience that
havin' friends is overrated.

518
00:58:57,657 --> 00:58:59,955
Oh, well.

519
00:59:01,528 --> 00:59:03,621
Come here.

520
00:59:09,269 --> 00:59:12,500
You don't always have to be
pointin' that gun at me.

521
00:59:12,572 --> 00:59:16,372
I'll do whatever you want.
Really, I will.

522
00:59:16,443 --> 00:59:19,071
What are you wearin'
underneath that dress?

523
00:59:19,145 --> 00:59:21,739
Nothin'.

524
00:59:22,716 --> 00:59:24,843
Turn around.

525
00:59:35,695 --> 00:59:37,788
Sit down.

526
00:59:41,101 --> 00:59:45,435
Wipe off that nail polish,
'cause I don't like it. Hey.

527
00:59:45,505 --> 00:59:49,771
When I tell you to come here, you move
your ass real fast. You understand?

528
00:59:49,843 --> 00:59:52,778
'Cause I got you
figured out from the start.

529
00:59:55,548 --> 00:59:59,075
Now go ahead.
Wait a second.

530
00:59:59,152 --> 01:00:02,087
- Get rid of this too.

531
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:06,988
Come here.

532
01:00:13,099 --> 01:00:16,591
Don't get blood on me.
I hate blood.

533
01:00:27,647 --> 01:00:30,275
I'll park the car
while you get the tickets.

534
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:32,614
- Meet me in the bar.
- Okay.

535
01:00:32,685 --> 01:00:34,915
That bag's kind of heavy.
Why don't you let me take it?

536
01:00:34,988 --> 01:00:37,218
It's not heavy.
I can handle it.

537
01:00:39,859 --> 01:00:42,020
- Hey, you! Don't park here.

538
01:00:42,095 --> 01:00:45,462
- Use the structure around the corner.
- Yes, sir, boss.

539
01:00:56,242 --> 01:00:59,177
Here are your two tickets
to El Paso, your change,

540
01:00:59,245 --> 01:01:01,543
and your train should be
leaving in about one hour.

541
01:01:01,614 --> 01:01:04,640
Thank you.

542
01:01:13,693 --> 01:01:16,218
The train to El Paso
has been delayed...

543
01:01:16,296 --> 01:01:18,423
and will be departing
in 90 minutes.

544
01:01:18,498 --> 01:01:21,228
The train to El Paso
has been delayed...

545
01:01:21,301 --> 01:01:23,633
and will be departing
in 90 minutes.

546
01:01:23,703 --> 01:01:25,637
Thank you.

547
01:01:36,416 --> 01:01:38,850
- Let me help you with that.
- No, that's okay.

548
01:01:38,918 --> 01:01:41,284
No, no, it's a big bag.

549
01:01:44,924 --> 01:01:47,051
- There you go.
- Thank you.

550
01:01:47,126 --> 01:01:49,060
Glad to help.

551
01:01:51,431 --> 01:01:54,366
The third bridesmaid's
dress took up half of my closet.

552
01:01:54,434 --> 01:01:56,561
- Did you ever wear the others?
- No!

553
01:01:56,636 --> 01:01:58,797
- Tequila.
- Sauza okay?

554
01:01:58,872 --> 01:02:00,737
It's fine.

555
01:02:10,984 --> 01:02:13,544
- Would you like another?
- Please.

556
01:02:21,928 --> 01:02:25,386
I guess you have to
catch a train?

557
01:02:25,465 --> 01:02:27,729
That's right.

558
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,360
Yeah, me too.
I'm goin' home.

559
01:02:30,436 --> 01:02:33,530
Where's home?

560
01:02:33,606 --> 01:02:36,302
Utah.
The Beehive State.

561
01:02:36,376 --> 01:02:39,038
I'm from Orem.
It's right near Salt Lake.

562
01:02:39,112 --> 01:02:42,138
Say, you wouldn't happen
to be Mormon, would you?

563
01:02:44,217 --> 01:02:48,586
There's about 12 people in the state
that aren't Mormon, and I'm one of 'em.

564
01:02:48,655 --> 01:02:52,091
Well, that makes you
kind of special then, huh?

565
01:02:53,993 --> 01:02:56,621
Yeah, I guess it does.

566
01:02:58,564 --> 01:03:02,523
Say, uh, you wouldn't be taking
the train to Salt Lake, would you?

567
01:03:02,602 --> 01:03:06,129
No. No, I'm afraid not.

568
01:03:09,776 --> 01:03:12,677
Never have any luck. Sorry.

569
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:19,784
Where is it?

570
01:03:19,852 --> 01:03:23,447
- It's in a locker over there.
- Show me.

571
01:03:31,564 --> 01:03:36,501
- Just can't forget about it,
can you, Doc? - Makes two of us.

572
01:03:36,569 --> 01:03:39,163
We should cut the money
and split up right here.

573
01:03:39,238 --> 01:03:42,002
If that's how you feel
about it, then fine by me.

574
01:03:42,075 --> 01:03:46,136
- We've lost something, Doc.
- I think Benyon got to you.

575
01:03:46,212 --> 01:03:50,615
At least I got to him.

576
01:03:50,683 --> 01:03:55,245
What the...

577
01:04:01,194 --> 01:04:04,357
- I know I put it in this locker.
- What are you tryin' to pull?

578
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:07,866
I know I put it in this locker.
l... A man helped me...

579
01:04:07,934 --> 01:04:10,459
- just a few minutes ago.
- Someone helped you?

580
01:04:10,536 --> 01:04:12,868
- Yeah, and then I went to the bar.
- What did he look like?

581
01:04:12,939 --> 01:04:16,306
He was tall. He had a red shirt.
I know I put it in that locker.

582
01:04:16,376 --> 01:04:19,937
He switched the keys on you.
The oldest trick in the book.

583
01:04:20,013 --> 01:04:22,743
Come on. Let's go.

584
01:04:22,815 --> 01:04:25,249
Do you see him?

585
01:04:39,232 --> 01:04:42,258
Look at every face.
Concentrate.

586
01:04:42,335 --> 01:04:44,929
Do you see him?

587
01:04:45,004 --> 01:04:48,440
No.
Maybe he went outside.

588
01:05:09,562 --> 01:05:11,496
That's him!

589
01:05:18,137 --> 01:05:21,072
Move! Move!

590
01:05:55,641 --> 01:05:57,734
You're in the center up there.

591
01:05:57,810 --> 01:05:59,869
Hey.

592
01:05:59,946 --> 01:06:02,278
- Bye, Grandma.
- There she is.

593
01:06:02,348 --> 01:06:05,784
- Bye.
- Bye.

594
01:06:05,852 --> 01:06:09,151
Bye.

595
01:06:49,595 --> 01:06:51,563
Hey!

596
01:06:59,405 --> 01:07:03,364
- Can you help me with my bag?
- No problem.

597
01:07:13,386 --> 01:07:15,616
What are you doing?

598
01:07:34,207 --> 01:07:36,141
Slow down!

599
01:07:56,429 --> 01:07:59,796
The toilets will be open
in five minutes.

600
01:08:25,658 --> 01:08:27,785
Don't even think about it!

601
01:08:32,632 --> 01:08:36,090
Next time you pick that lock
don't leave them scratch marks.

602
01:08:36,168 --> 01:08:39,365
Bastard!

603
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,751
Harold.

604
01:09:02,828 --> 01:09:05,092
- Hey, put that away.
- What?

605
01:09:05,164 --> 01:09:07,758
- Give me some pain pills.
- Here.

606
01:09:09,602 --> 01:09:11,900
- Harold, these... these ones?
- Yes.

607
01:09:18,244 --> 01:09:23,181
So... Rudy,
why are we going to El Paso?

608
01:09:23,249 --> 01:09:26,013
I gotta look up
some old friends.

609
01:09:26,085 --> 01:09:28,383
- Oh.
- I gotta pick up a suitcase.

610
01:09:28,454 --> 01:09:31,480
Then I'm gonna head
south of the border. Real far south.

611
01:09:31,557 --> 01:09:34,549
Oh, that sounds great.

612
01:09:34,627 --> 01:09:37,892
I love to travel, but Harold
never wants to go anywhere.

613
01:09:37,963 --> 01:09:41,694
- That's not true.
- It's true. We never go anywhere.

614
01:09:41,767 --> 01:09:44,895
He'd rather stay home and play
with all of his little critters.

615
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:47,495
Isn't that right, Harold?

616
01:09:47,573 --> 01:09:50,508
You poor old bugger.

617
01:10:42,795 --> 01:10:45,229
I got us a car that I hot-wired.

618
01:10:45,297 --> 01:10:47,731
- Come on, let's go.

619
01:10:50,002 --> 01:10:52,129
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

620
01:11:01,814 --> 01:11:05,944
Here, Harold,
have some chicken. Harold.

621
01:11:06,018 --> 01:11:10,148
No, no. Look, I gotta pull over.
I gotta pee.

622
01:11:15,428 --> 01:11:18,397
- Have some fries.
- Rudy!

623
01:11:18,464 --> 01:11:22,230
- Here, Harold, have some fries.

624
01:11:22,301 --> 01:11:25,327
Have some chicken.
Here's your chicken.

625
01:11:26,639 --> 01:11:28,607
Hey, some chicken.

626
01:11:28,674 --> 01:11:31,199
Rudy. Goddamn it!
What'd you do that for?

627
01:11:31,277 --> 01:11:34,508
You know why I did that?
'Cause it makes me feel good.

628
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:36,810
- Have some fries.
- No, you have a fry.

629
01:11:36,882 --> 01:11:41,046
- Hey! Have some fries, Harold. Hey!
- Have a biscuit, Rudy.

630
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,920
- Hey, have some more fries.
- Hey, have some chicken.

631
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:47,925
- Chicken.
- You have some chicken.

632
01:11:47,993 --> 01:11:50,791
- Have some bean sprouts.

633
01:11:50,863 --> 01:11:54,299
- Hey, stop it!
- Fran, get back here!

634
01:11:54,366 --> 01:11:58,393
- You're such a pig!
- I've gotta pull over. I've gotta pee!

635
01:11:58,471 --> 01:12:01,338
Oh, I guess we should stop,
'cause Harold has to pee.

636
01:12:01,407 --> 01:12:04,035
Get back in the front.

637
01:12:04,109 --> 01:12:07,306
Get back up there with Harold!
Get up there!

638
01:12:11,217 --> 01:12:16,985
I don't want to play...
this game... anymore!

639
01:12:17,056 --> 01:12:19,149
You pee in your pants.

640
01:13:10,242 --> 01:13:13,006
Looks like this guy's
a real pro.

641
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,814
Where'd you get this?

642
01:13:16,882 --> 01:13:21,046
It was a gift. I told you,
the guy gave it to me.

643
01:13:22,922 --> 01:13:25,220
Yeah, that's him.

644
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,694
Carter McCoy.

645
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:47,870
Hey. Hey!

646
01:13:47,947 --> 01:13:51,542
It's Harold!

647
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,087
Harold, get back
in there, you pervert.

648
01:14:05,698 --> 01:14:08,030
Hey, Gollie, it's Doc.

649
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:11,001
Yeah. Yeah, right.

650
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:14,562
How's those travel
arrangements coming?

651
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,973
Good. Yeah, she's doing all right.

652
01:14:18,043 --> 01:14:20,978
- All right. Thanks.

653
01:14:28,287 --> 01:14:31,085
- We're all set.
- Good morning. How're ya doin'?

654
01:14:31,156 --> 01:14:34,421
- Who had bacon?
- Right here.

655
01:14:34,493 --> 01:14:36,825
Enjoy your breakfast.
Anything else?

656
01:14:36,895 --> 01:14:39,159
- No, that's all right. Thank you.
- All right.

657
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:42,132
Arizona police have identified a suspect
in the greyhound track robbery.

658
01:14:42,201 --> 01:14:46,103
Carter McCoy, also known
as Doc McCoy, is wanted...

659
01:14:46,171 --> 01:14:50,232
- in an armed robbery at
the Phoenix Dog Track. - Doc.

660
01:14:50,309 --> 01:14:52,869
He is also wanted
in connection with a hijacking...

661
01:14:52,945 --> 01:14:56,278
and firebombing of a tanker truck
in the track parking lot.

662
01:14:56,348 --> 01:14:59,681
McCoy is an expert safe-cracker.
His criminal record indicates...

663
01:14:59,752 --> 01:15:02,619
numerous other well-planned thefts.

664
01:15:02,688 --> 01:15:06,454
He is considered by authorities as the
probable mastermind behind the heist...

665
01:15:06,525 --> 01:15:09,892
and should be considered
well-armed and extremely dangerous.

666
01:15:09,962 --> 01:15:12,829
- Dad, that's the guy there on TV.
- What?

667
01:15:12,898 --> 01:15:16,026
...and immediately contact
law enforcement officials.

668
01:15:16,101 --> 01:15:19,264
Here we go, Mel.
I think she's gonna like that.

669
01:15:19,338 --> 01:15:21,863
- Say hello to Alice for me, will ya?
- Thank you.

670
01:15:23,575 --> 01:15:27,807
- Yes, sir. What can we do for
you today? - Let's see.

671
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,781
I'll take that black
12-gauge pump gun.

672
01:15:30,849 --> 01:15:33,613
Ah, the Minelli.
That's a good choice.

673
01:15:33,686 --> 01:15:36,086
This is a very powerful
weapon here, sir.

674
01:15:36,155 --> 01:15:41,092
My brother-in-law uses this very gun
to hunt ducks, if you can believe that.

675
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,492
You hit a duck
with one of these suckers,

676
01:15:43,562 --> 01:15:46,190
and you're not gonna have
many pieces left to eat.

677
01:15:46,265 --> 01:15:49,166
That's a good weapon, though.
What else can I get for you?

678
01:15:49,234 --> 01:15:53,000
- Four boxes of double-aught buck.
- Double-aught buck.

679
01:15:53,072 --> 01:15:55,768
Four of 'em.
Here we go.

680
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:59,675
That sounds like a huntin' trip
I'd like to be on, I'll tell ya.

681
01:15:59,745 --> 01:16:02,213
These babies'll knock down
a wall, if ya need it.

682
01:16:02,281 --> 01:16:04,272
Four boxes of .45 auto shells.

683
01:16:04,349 --> 01:16:08,115
.45 auto shells. Where'd I put those?
There they are.

684
01:16:22,868 --> 01:16:25,462
Okay, all we need now is
a little bit of identification.

685
01:16:25,537 --> 01:16:28,938
And we're gonna have to fill this out
for Uncle Sam. One through eight.

686
01:16:29,007 --> 01:16:32,738
Don't forget question C:
"Are you a fugitive from justice?"

687
01:16:32,811 --> 01:16:36,178
Don't worry about that.
We ask everybody to do that.

688
01:16:36,248 --> 01:16:40,685
You're gonna need a case. I got 50% off
this week on both hard and soft cases.

689
01:16:40,753 --> 01:16:43,688
I got a dandy here for you.
Right here.

690
01:16:43,756 --> 01:16:46,418
- Wrap the shotgun.

691
01:16:46,492 --> 01:16:49,120
Wrap the shotgun.

692
01:16:49,194 --> 01:16:53,221
40-23, I need a 10-28,
please, on an Arizona plate:

693
01:16:53,298 --> 01:16:56,062
Sam-Paul-Queen, four-eight-five.

694
01:16:56,135 --> 01:16:59,571
This will be on a 1987
metallic-blue Camaro.

695
01:17:01,807 --> 01:17:04,275
Look, are you sure
you want to do this?

696
01:17:04,343 --> 01:17:08,780
- I want you to shut up, lie down
and take a nap. - All right.

697
01:17:08,847 --> 01:17:12,305
I know the drill.
Count to 100, right?

698
01:17:12,384 --> 01:17:16,718
One, two, three,

699
01:17:16,789 --> 01:17:19,349
four, five...

700
01:17:19,424 --> 01:17:23,121
I'm gettin' out of this business.
Six...

701
01:17:23,428 --> 01:17:25,760
Keep the change.

702
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:30,267
Excuse me, are you for hire?

703
01:17:30,335 --> 01:17:32,997
Shift's over.
Sorry, lady.

704
01:17:34,339 --> 01:17:36,273
Sorry.

705
01:17:39,611 --> 01:17:42,045
What are you doin'?
I said my shift's over.

706
01:17:42,114 --> 01:17:45,743
- You'll have to get another...
- We're heading east, pal.

707
01:17:49,988 --> 01:17:54,391
2-79, car 2-79, come in.
Can you do another pickup?

708
01:17:54,459 --> 01:17:57,860
- That's you. Answer it.
- What do you want me to say?

709
01:17:57,930 --> 01:18:01,832
- Tell him you got a fare.
- The dispatcher won't fall for that.

710
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:04,869
She's gonna know the cab's
been hijacked, and we're on Third...

711
01:18:04,937 --> 01:18:07,269
He's got the radio on,
telling 'em where we are.

712
01:18:07,339 --> 01:18:10,706
- You make a right turn here,
or I'm gonna put one in you.

713
01:18:20,819 --> 01:18:24,915
- Get out of there, now!
- Let's go!

714
01:18:31,563 --> 01:18:33,497
Let's go!

715
01:18:33,565 --> 01:18:35,965
Doc, come on!

716
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:41,335
Go! Go!

717
01:18:43,008 --> 01:18:45,806
Get in!

718
01:19:00,459 --> 01:19:03,292
Fuck! Stay with him!

719
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:10,464
- Keep it steady.

720
01:19:15,173 --> 01:19:17,004
On the right!

721
01:19:25,584 --> 01:19:28,280
- On your right, on your right!

722
01:19:55,847 --> 01:19:58,008
- Whoa!

723
01:19:59,418 --> 01:20:01,352
Hang on, Doc!

724
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:04,389
- Shit.

725
01:20:11,129 --> 01:20:13,324
Keep going, keep going!

726
01:20:19,237 --> 01:20:23,071
Negative. We're blocked in
the underground parking area.

727
01:20:54,773 --> 01:20:57,503
- We're gonna jump in this thing.
- No way.

728
01:20:57,576 --> 01:21:00,204
- Doc, we gotta keep moving.

729
01:21:05,217 --> 01:21:07,447
Oh, shit, Doc!

730
01:21:39,351 --> 01:21:41,285
Shit!

731
01:21:43,555 --> 01:21:47,389
- What? - The cops are out there.
We're goin' in the truck.

732
01:22:06,711 --> 01:22:09,737
- God!
- Stay back!

733
01:22:09,815 --> 01:22:13,945
- Doc! No!
- Get back!

734
01:22:14,019 --> 01:22:17,182
Get back!
All the way to the back.

735
01:22:24,863 --> 01:22:27,491
- Whoooaah!
- Oh, God!

736
01:22:32,571 --> 01:22:36,667
What are you lookin' out
the window for?

737
01:22:36,741 --> 01:22:39,608
Somebody else comin' after me?

738
01:22:48,253 --> 01:22:50,187
Kitty.

739
01:22:51,957 --> 01:22:54,983
Look, Rudy, he likes it.

740
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:57,620
- Give me that.
- Rudy!

741
01:22:59,564 --> 01:23:02,431
Hey, Harold,
come out of the bathroom.

742
01:23:04,736 --> 01:23:08,832
Harold, come on out.
My shoulder hurts.

743
01:23:08,907 --> 01:23:10,841
Harold.

744
01:23:19,217 --> 01:23:21,310
- Rudy!

745
01:23:27,592 --> 01:23:29,992
What are you doin' in there?

746
01:23:49,581 --> 01:23:54,484
- Hey, Fran,
I think it's time to check out.

747
01:24:26,551 --> 01:24:28,951
Oh!

748
01:24:36,461 --> 01:24:39,396
You okay?

749
01:24:41,366 --> 01:24:43,391
I think so. I don't know.

750
01:24:57,782 --> 01:25:01,309
Don't scratch yourself around here.
You're gonna get an infection.

751
01:25:13,231 --> 01:25:15,699
- I wanna tell you something.
- I don't wanna hear it.

752
01:25:15,767 --> 01:25:17,792
Hey, this is hard for me.

753
01:25:17,869 --> 01:25:21,361
When we get to El Paso,
I think I should take off.

754
01:25:29,814 --> 01:25:32,248
Hey, listen to me.

755
01:25:36,421 --> 01:25:39,356
I want you to stick with me.

756
01:25:43,928 --> 01:25:46,362
No more about Benyon.

757
01:25:48,466 --> 01:25:51,833
You and me.
What do you say?

758
01:25:58,677 --> 01:26:02,579
Can't get much worse than this, Doc.

759
01:26:02,647 --> 01:26:05,445
I don't see how it could.

760
01:26:11,089 --> 01:26:13,319
Got us a car.

761
01:26:13,391 --> 01:26:16,519
Got a couple of tires.
We're in business.

762
01:26:22,233 --> 01:26:24,167
Yep.

763
01:26:24,235 --> 01:26:28,001
Hey, we get to Mexico,
we're gonna have a new life. Right?

764
01:26:28,073 --> 01:26:30,268
That's all I want.

765
01:26:49,928 --> 01:26:53,523
- Yeah, Tom here.

766
01:26:53,598 --> 01:26:56,863
Tell Jim Deer
Rudy and some girl just drove up.

767
01:26:56,935 --> 01:27:00,234
Looks like they're
headin' into the hotel.

768
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:09,002
Howdy, folks.
Welcome to the rustic Border Hotel.

769
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:14,017
- You must be Gollie.
- By golly, I am Gollie.

770
01:27:14,085 --> 01:27:17,316
This here's my wife Carmen.
I call her Tootsie.

771
01:27:17,389 --> 01:27:19,823
That's our three-year-old daughter.
Her name's Anna.

772
01:27:19,891 --> 01:27:22,826
That's my son Jim. He's 17,
and he's my jackrabbit.

773
01:27:22,894 --> 01:27:25,124
- We need a room for three.
- Three?

774
01:27:25,196 --> 01:27:27,756
- Oh, you got a cat. No problem.

775
01:27:27,832 --> 01:27:30,164
You need a room,
you come to the right place.

776
01:27:30,235 --> 01:27:32,499
We got lots of rooms. Room 309.

777
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:35,562
Hot out there, ain't it?
It must be 114 degrees.

778
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:38,507
Y'all come in
for the races, I'll bet.

779
01:27:38,576 --> 01:27:41,272
Y-Y'all watch your step.
Watch your step please, ma'am.

780
01:27:41,346 --> 01:27:44,281
A horse'll run a good
second faster out there...

781
01:27:44,349 --> 01:27:46,283
than any other track
in the country.

782
01:27:46,351 --> 01:27:48,046
It's just somethin'.

783
01:27:48,119 --> 01:27:50,883
Now, if one thing does hold true
to form, it's the speed horse.

784
01:27:50,955 --> 01:27:54,982
A speed horse, he's runnin' just as hard
as he can for as long as he can.

785
01:27:55,059 --> 01:27:59,519
What they try to do is to rate those
things. That's a whole 'nother story.

786
01:27:59,597 --> 01:28:02,191
This here...
This here's your livin' room.

787
01:28:02,267 --> 01:28:07,102
Bathroom, shower,
toilet, bedroom, bed.

788
01:28:07,172 --> 01:28:09,572
Over in the top drawer
you got the Gideon Bible.

789
01:28:09,641 --> 01:28:11,472
Right out here
you got a veranda.

790
01:28:11,543 --> 01:28:13,477
Oh, it's just
a beautiful sunset there, lady.

791
01:28:13,545 --> 01:28:16,207
Now... here you go.

792
01:28:16,281 --> 01:28:20,274
- What's in there?
- That'd be your closet there. It's...

793
01:28:20,351 --> 01:28:24,117
Oh! God!
What're ya... Oh!

794
01:28:24,189 --> 01:28:27,090
Open up your mouth.
Say "Ahhh."

795
01:28:27,158 --> 01:28:29,422
Ahhh! Ahhh!

796
01:28:29,494 --> 01:28:32,759
You got two choices here, pal:
You can live or you can die.

797
01:28:32,831 --> 01:28:35,026
- What's it gonna be?
- I don't wanna die.

798
01:28:35,099 --> 01:28:38,034
You do the right thing, you might
even make a little bit of money.

799
01:28:38,102 --> 01:28:39,763
Huh?

800
01:28:58,122 --> 01:29:01,285
I'll tell you what.
I'll go check us into the hotel.

801
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:04,556
You go find someplace around here
and get us some new clothes.

802
01:29:05,763 --> 01:29:09,324
Here you go, Doc.
Passport.

803
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:13,200
Credit card, driver's license.

804
01:29:13,271 --> 01:29:16,104
All cherry stuff.
Never been reported.

805
01:29:16,174 --> 01:29:18,369
That stuff's so good, you
can go anywhere you want to,

806
01:29:18,443 --> 01:29:21,105
no matter how hot you may be.

807
01:29:21,179 --> 01:29:24,205
Here's the key to your room, 234.

808
01:29:24,282 --> 01:29:28,013
Nobody else on that floor but you.
All you gotta do is lay low a while.

809
01:29:28,086 --> 01:29:31,055
Then we'll get you
on out of here, okay?

810
01:29:31,122 --> 01:29:33,784
Carol went to get us
some fresh clothes.

811
01:29:33,858 --> 01:29:36,554
We're both hungry.
Send up some food as soon as you can.

812
01:29:36,628 --> 01:29:38,994
- How about some sandwiches?
- That'll be fine.

813
01:29:39,063 --> 01:29:41,190
It's gonna be an hour, maybe more.

814
01:29:41,266 --> 01:29:44,793
When my wife comes back, have that kid
take care of anything she might need.

815
01:29:44,869 --> 01:29:47,133
- I gave him the day off.
- Then you do it.

816
01:29:47,205 --> 01:29:52,609
I can't. I-I've gotta watch
the front desk. You know how it goes.

817
01:29:56,748 --> 01:30:01,082
Doc, look, I'll work
on the food, okay? Doc!

818
01:30:01,152 --> 01:30:03,143
This ain't the Hilton.

819
01:30:23,641 --> 01:30:26,235
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

820
01:32:09,113 --> 01:32:12,048
Give me that room key,
or I'll kill you...

821
01:32:12,116 --> 01:32:15,847
and I'll kill your little kitty too.

822
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,548
You see Gollie's face
when he bounced off that door?

823
01:32:18,623 --> 01:32:21,114
Hey, Gollie, what's in here?

824
01:32:21,192 --> 01:32:23,660
I don't know. Let's find out.

825
01:32:26,497 --> 01:32:29,295
Open your mouth!
Open it wider!

826
01:32:38,042 --> 01:32:40,704
- Yeah?
- He's here.

827
01:32:40,778 --> 01:32:43,338
Room 234.

828
01:32:43,414 --> 01:32:48,044
Wants me to bring him up
some sandwiches in about an hour.

829
01:32:48,119 --> 01:32:50,280
Yeah, 234.

830
01:32:50,354 --> 01:32:52,379
Hang it up.

831
01:32:52,457 --> 01:32:56,086
- Get dressed.

832
01:33:01,532 --> 01:33:04,467
- Good flight, Jim?
- They still in there?

833
01:33:04,535 --> 01:33:08,665
Yeah, both of 'em. McCoy and his wife
showed up a little while ago.

834
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:11,038
Mm-hmm.
That's nice.

835
01:33:11,109 --> 01:33:14,943
Fire up the grill, boys.
It's barbecue time.

836
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:21,810
- Want some of these?
- Let's go, baby. Come on.

837
01:33:39,937 --> 01:33:42,872
Hey, wake up.
Come on, let's go.

838
01:33:44,408 --> 01:33:46,535
What's the matter?

839
01:33:46,611 --> 01:33:50,877
Get dressed.
We're leavin' right now.

840
01:33:50,948 --> 01:33:53,974
What is it?

841
01:33:54,051 --> 01:33:56,110
It's Gollie.

842
01:33:56,187 --> 01:33:59,247
Somethin' bothering me
about him.

843
01:33:59,323 --> 01:34:01,621
He's always got
his family around.

844
01:34:01,692 --> 01:34:04,126
That wife and kid of his
always stick close...

845
01:34:04,195 --> 01:34:07,426
to make sure he stays away
from the horses and the booze.

846
01:34:07,498 --> 01:34:09,523
So what?

847
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,228
If they're not here,
then there's somethin' wrong.

848
01:34:12,303 --> 01:34:14,237
Maybe they took the day off.

849
01:34:18,276 --> 01:34:20,904
What's the plan?

850
01:34:20,978 --> 01:34:23,708
The plan is, shut up.

851
01:34:39,831 --> 01:34:43,232
- Come on, baby, we gotta move.

852
01:34:46,871 --> 01:34:48,805
Who is it?

853
01:34:48,873 --> 01:34:52,240
Sandwiches for Mr. McCoy.
It's your food, ma'am.

854
01:34:55,546 --> 01:35:00,074
He's in the shower.
Can you leave them outside?

855
01:35:04,388 --> 01:35:07,289
Um, no,
I can't do that, ma'am.

856
01:35:07,358 --> 01:35:10,919
You have to pay now, 'cause I have
to pay the boy that brought up the food.

857
01:35:10,995 --> 01:35:14,362
Well, I'm not dressed.
You'll have to wait.

858
01:35:16,033 --> 01:35:17,967
Hello?

859
01:35:19,203 --> 01:35:21,933
All right.

860
01:36:05,483 --> 01:36:08,975
Ma'am, how much longer
are you gonna be?

861
01:36:17,094 --> 01:36:19,722
- Rudy!

862
01:36:19,797 --> 01:36:24,029
My Rudy! Rudy!
Don't touch my Rudy!

863
01:36:24,101 --> 01:36:26,501
Don't hurt my Rudy!
Don't hurt my Rudy!

864
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:29,164
Don't hurt my Rudy!

865
01:37:03,641 --> 01:37:06,235
Let's get out of here.

866
01:37:24,562 --> 01:37:28,157
- Ah, what is it? Is it... 204?

867
01:37:28,232 --> 01:37:32,134
- Is it, uh, 314?

868
01:37:34,338 --> 01:37:36,272
Ooh!

869
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:41,744
Ooh! My, my, my, my, my.
Now, you may wanna watch this.

870
01:37:41,812 --> 01:37:45,111
What are you gonna do
with that thing?

871
01:37:45,182 --> 01:37:49,346
- What are you doin' to me? No! No!
- Right there.

872
01:37:52,656 --> 01:37:55,523
Please let me go! It's 309!

873
01:37:55,593 --> 01:37:57,458
- There he is!
- Get him!

874
01:37:57,528 --> 01:38:00,395
- Get the bastard!
- Get him! Get out there!

875
01:38:00,464 --> 01:38:03,763
Get down, down!

876
01:38:03,834 --> 01:38:08,362
- She's a fucking girl! Get over there!

877
01:38:08,439 --> 01:38:10,532
- Get over there!

878
01:38:14,045 --> 01:38:16,775
I'm hit! I'm hit!

879
01:38:16,847 --> 01:38:18,781
Get off that floor!

880
01:38:18,849 --> 01:38:21,613
My knee! My knee!

881
01:38:21,685 --> 01:38:24,051
Here we come!

882
01:38:33,798 --> 01:38:37,165
Just put down the bag, Doc.

883
01:38:39,437 --> 01:38:42,895
We don't give a shit
about what you did to Benyon.

884
01:38:42,973 --> 01:38:45,066
We just want the money.

885
01:38:53,384 --> 01:38:55,409
Get up there!

886
01:39:01,559 --> 01:39:03,652
Get ready.

887
01:39:04,895 --> 01:39:07,591
- I'll meet you up on the roof.
- Yeah.

888
01:39:14,939 --> 01:39:18,375
Come on! Get McCoy!
He went around the corner.

889
01:39:18,442 --> 01:39:20,410
Go! Go!

890
01:40:11,061 --> 01:40:13,894
- Was that gunfire?
- Nah, someone's TV.

891
01:42:21,225 --> 01:42:23,819
Oh!

892
01:42:57,261 --> 01:42:59,195
Rudy?

893
01:43:00,898 --> 01:43:02,957
Rudy?

894
01:43:04,535 --> 01:43:06,765
Rudy?

895
01:43:06,837 --> 01:43:10,034
Rudy?
Where's Rudy?

896
01:43:10,107 --> 01:43:13,008
Rudy. Rudy.

897
01:43:13,077 --> 01:43:17,070
Rudy? Rudy?

898
01:43:17,147 --> 01:43:19,138
Rudy! Rudy!

899
01:43:19,216 --> 01:43:21,309
Rudy! Rudy!

900
01:44:23,247 --> 01:44:27,081
Shit! Ah, shit!

901
01:44:54,478 --> 01:44:58,039
- Hey!

902
01:44:58,115 --> 01:45:01,175
- Get up!

903
01:45:01,251 --> 01:45:04,652
Come on!
Stand up!

904
01:45:08,025 --> 01:45:11,893
- Where you goin', Doc?

905
01:45:11,962 --> 01:45:14,897
- Get up! Turn around!

906
01:45:14,965 --> 01:45:17,729
I wanna see your face!

907
01:45:17,801 --> 01:45:21,362
Get up!
Stand up!

908
01:45:25,642 --> 01:45:29,806
Should've killed me
when you had the chance.

909
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:35,141
Bang, bang.

910
01:45:36,787 --> 01:45:39,654
Doc!

911
01:45:41,191 --> 01:45:44,888
This fucking thing.
Shit!

912
01:46:08,018 --> 01:46:10,452
See ya later, Doc.

913
01:47:00,203 --> 01:47:02,967
He's a big tall man, and he has...

914
01:47:12,983 --> 01:47:15,315
Rudy!

915
01:47:24,528 --> 01:47:26,723
Give me the gun.

916
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:32,225
Get outta here! Run!

917
01:47:35,973 --> 01:47:38,305
Out the back.

918
01:47:52,723 --> 01:47:55,089
- Hey, man.
- We need a lift.

919
01:47:55,158 --> 01:47:58,321
All you gotta do is ask.
Get in.

920
01:47:58,395 --> 01:48:01,023
- Where are we headed?
- Mexico.

921
01:48:01,098 --> 01:48:03,566
I love Mexico!

922
01:48:05,936 --> 01:48:09,804
You know, I was thinkin' about
taking a trip down there myself.

923
01:48:09,873 --> 01:48:12,967
Not in this big a hurry,
though. Hang on!

924
01:48:13,043 --> 01:48:17,343
- Take it easy, fella.

925
01:48:21,585 --> 01:48:24,383
Well, I guess you
ain't gonna shoot me, are ya?

926
01:48:24,454 --> 01:48:27,014
I kind of doubt it.

927
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:31,049
That's good. I'll cooperate,
don't worry about that.

928
01:48:31,128 --> 01:48:35,326
Yes, sir, I've had a few run-ins
with the law myself.

929
01:48:35,399 --> 01:48:37,333
Is that right?

930
01:48:37,401 --> 01:48:42,100
About three years ago I dynamited
some fish down by the reservoir.

931
01:48:42,172 --> 01:48:44,299
That little job
cost me $100.

932
01:48:44,374 --> 01:48:47,468
They wouldn't even
let me keep the fish.

933
01:48:47,544 --> 01:48:50,604
- What's your name?
- Slim.

934
01:48:55,519 --> 01:48:58,317
Where are you going today?

935
01:48:58,388 --> 01:49:02,381
- You sure this is gonna work?
- Absolutely positive.

936
01:49:02,459 --> 01:49:05,758
- What if it doesn't?
- I'll floor it.

937
01:49:14,037 --> 01:49:16,528
Buenos dias, Slim.
Cómo estás?

938
01:49:16,606 --> 01:49:20,702
Doin' just fine, Jose.
This here's my nephew and his wife.

939
01:49:20,777 --> 01:49:23,302
We thought we'd go over
and do a little sightseein'.

940
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:25,314
Don't forget
to buy something.

941
01:49:25,382 --> 01:49:28,909
Sí, señor.
You got my word on that.

942
01:49:36,059 --> 01:49:38,550
I didn't think we'd have
a problem back there.

943
01:49:38,628 --> 01:49:41,961
I got me a little señorita
here in town.

944
01:49:42,032 --> 01:49:44,557
Fellas kind of know me.

945
01:49:44,634 --> 01:49:46,727
- You got a señorita?
- Mm-hmm.

946
01:49:46,803 --> 01:49:49,033
Shame on you.
Your wife know about it?

947
01:49:49,106 --> 01:49:51,506
My wife's been gone
for ten years.

948
01:49:51,575 --> 01:49:55,602
If she was still around,
I wouldn't be goin' no place but home.

949
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:58,614
- Are you two married?
- Yeah.

950
01:49:58,682 --> 01:50:01,412
Well, it's a tough
haul sometime,

951
01:50:01,485 --> 01:50:04,113
but let me tell you,
it's well worth it.

952
01:50:04,187 --> 01:50:06,678
I think the most important
thing in life is...

953
01:50:06,757 --> 01:50:09,624
somethin' you got
to give to each other.

954
01:50:09,693 --> 01:50:13,129
Don't never forget it.

955
01:50:13,196 --> 01:50:15,687
Pull over up here.

956
01:50:29,813 --> 01:50:33,010
You folks gonna be
all right out here?

957
01:50:33,083 --> 01:50:35,643
Let me ask you something.

958
01:50:38,688 --> 01:50:42,351
- How much money you make last year?
- Twelve thousand.

959
01:50:44,027 --> 01:50:47,963
I'll tell ya, I'll give ya
20,000 for the truck.

960
01:50:48,031 --> 01:50:50,124
Are ya serious?

961
01:50:51,935 --> 01:50:53,869
I sure am.

962
01:50:56,072 --> 01:50:59,599
Whew! And, uh,
I keep my mouth shut,

963
01:50:59,676 --> 01:51:02,110
and I don't say nothin'
about the truck.

964
01:51:02,179 --> 01:51:04,374
I've never seen you two
before. Right?

965
01:51:04,447 --> 01:51:06,847
You got it.

966
01:51:06,917 --> 01:51:09,317
Could, uh...
Could you make it 30?

967
01:51:11,655 --> 01:51:15,182
- How about 40?
- Damn!

968
01:51:15,258 --> 01:51:19,319
Ma'am, you got a deal.
She's all yours.

969
01:51:19,396 --> 01:51:22,991
You're gonna have to make your own way
back to the border, though.

970
01:51:23,066 --> 01:51:25,500
Oh, I'll make it.
Don't worry about me.

971
01:51:25,569 --> 01:51:29,505
Vaya con Dios.
Same to you.

972
01:51:32,509 --> 01:51:34,636
She's a good old truck.

973
01:51:34,711 --> 01:51:39,239
She won't win any races,
but she'll run forever.

974
01:51:39,316 --> 01:51:43,582
- I just put new brakes in her.
- Good.

975
01:51:43,653 --> 01:51:46,645
- Y'all take care, ya hear?
- Yeah.

976
01:51:50,994 --> 01:51:53,121
Damn!

977
01:51:53,196 --> 01:51:56,131
Adiós, amigos!

978
01:52:12,449 --> 01:52:14,383
Goddamn!

979
01:52:27,397 --> 01:52:31,424
Whenever I'm weary

980
01:52:31,501 --> 01:52:37,337
From the battles that rage in my head

981
01:52:39,743 --> 01:52:43,679
You make sense of madness

982
01:52:43,747 --> 01:52:49,777
When my sanity hangs by a thread

983
01:52:52,355 --> 01:52:55,688
I lose my way but still

984
01:52:55,759 --> 01:53:01,391
You seem to understand

985
01:53:01,464 --> 01:53:04,991
Now and forever

986
01:53:06,603 --> 01:53:11,267
I will be your man

987
01:53:16,446 --> 01:53:21,406
Sometimes
I just hold you

988
01:53:21,484 --> 01:53:26,751
Too caught up in me to see

989
01:53:28,959 --> 01:53:33,293
I'm holding a fortune

990
01:53:33,363 --> 01:53:38,995
That heaven has given to me

991
01:53:41,571 --> 01:53:44,369
I'll try to show you

992
01:53:44,441 --> 01:53:50,744
Each and every way I can

993
01:53:50,814 --> 01:53:54,443
Now and forever

994
01:53:55,852 --> 01:54:00,289
I will be your man

995
01:54:03,193 --> 01:54:07,323
Now I can rest my worries

996
01:54:07,397 --> 01:54:11,060
And always be sure

997
01:54:11,134 --> 01:54:14,194
That I won't be alone

998
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:17,467
Anymore

999
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:22,000
If I'd only known
you were there

1000
01:54:22,145 --> 01:54:24,978
All the time

1001
01:54:25,048 --> 01:54:31,453
All this time

1002
01:54:55,512 --> 01:54:59,676
Until the day the ocean

1003
01:54:59,749 --> 01:55:04,482
Doesn't touch the sand

1004
01:55:04,554 --> 01:55:08,217
Now and forever

1005
01:55:09,692 --> 01:55:14,720
I will be your man

1006
01:55:16,933 --> 01:55:20,630
Now and forever

1007
01:55:22,038 --> 01:55:26,475
I will be

1008
01:55:26,543 --> 01:55:31,640
Your man

1009
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:42,640
