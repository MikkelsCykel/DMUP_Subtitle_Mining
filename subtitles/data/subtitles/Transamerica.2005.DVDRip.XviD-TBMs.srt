1
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,700
I'm gonna say our mantra.

2
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:33,183
''This is the voice I want to use. ''

3
00:00:33,274 --> 00:00:36,074
over and over again.
but with different inflections.

4
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:39,452
and I want you to try to mimic
what I'm doing.

5
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:41,111
This is the voice I want to use.

6
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:42,938
This is the voice I want to use.

7
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:46,065
Now. what we're gonna do
is press down on our tongue

8
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:48,932
and sot of watch what's happening
at the back of our mouths.

9
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,310
Ready?

10
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:03,053
Aaaah...

11
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,716
Any suicidal tendencies?

12
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:15,435
No.

13
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:18,170
You ever felt
as though you were being followed?

14
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:20,045
No.

15
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:22,776
Any history of family mental illness?

16
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:24,151
No.

17
00:02:24,198 --> 00:02:26,698
Medical procedures to date?

18
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:30,089
The usual electrolysis.
three years of hormone therapy.

19
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:35,144
facial feminization surgery.
brow lift. forehead reduction.

20
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:39,537
jaw re-contouring.
and a tracheal shave.

21
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:41,947
You look very authentic.

22
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:45,446
I try to blend in.
Keep a low profile.

23
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:48,601
I believe the slang terminology
is ''Living Stealth. ''

24
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:52,598
Do you consider yourself
a happy person?

25
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,101
Yes.

26
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:55,733
l mean, no.

27
00:02:55,864 --> 00:02:57,164
l mean...

28
00:02:57,783 --> 00:02:58,783
l will be.

29
00:02:58,784 --> 00:03:00,042
Miss Osbourne,

30
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:02,382
there's no such thing
as a right answer in this office.

31
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:05,485
Yes, l'm a very happy person.

32
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:08,655
How can l help you
if you won't be honest with me?

33
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:11,422
You can sign that consent form.

34
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:12,505
Please.

35
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:14,456
The American Psychiatric Association

36
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:18,875
categorizes gender dysphoria
as a very serious mental disorder.

37
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:23,284
After my operation,

38
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:25,611
not even a gynecologist
will be able to detect

39
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,406
anything out of the ordinary
about my body.

40
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:30,589
l will be a woman.

41
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:33,796
Don't you find it odd
that plastic surgery

42
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,566
can cure a mental disorder?

43
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:38,345
How do you feel about your penis?

44
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:43,639
lt disgusts me.

45
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:46,401
l don't even like looking at it.

46
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:48,232
What about friends?

47
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,152
They don't like it, either.

48
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,871
No, l mean,
do you have the support of friends?

49
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,268
l'm very close to my therapist.

50
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,771
What about your family?

51
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,070
My family is dead.

52
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:05,796
You take some hormones

53
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:07,711
And l'll take some hormones

54
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:12,035
l'll be a woman before you

55
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:14,649
Make me happy when skies...

56
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:16,339
Shit.

57
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:18,467
l mean darn.

58
00:04:18,578 --> 00:04:20,478
Darn. l mean darn it.

59
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:22,397
Darn it, darn it, darn it.

60
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,067
Mmm.

61
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,299
Good night, Bree.

62
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:28,606
Sleep tight, Bree.

63
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:30,813
Hmm.

64
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:52,699
I Orale !

65
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:00,375
Oh!

66
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:02,878
This is the voice.

67
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:05,005
l...this...

68
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:06,716
this is the voice.

69
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:09,599
This is the voice.

70
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:12,474
Hello.
May l please speak to

71
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:16,401
Mrs. or Mrs. Bhumibol Niratpattanasani?

72
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:19,635
Mrs. Niratpattanasani,
this is Bree Osbourne calling

73
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:21,501
with a special introductory offer

74
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,021
from the National Home Shopping...

75
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,456
Hello?

76
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:30,885
Hello.

77
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:35,335
Stanley Schupak
doesn't live here anymore.

78
00:05:35,438 --> 00:05:36,838
Who's calling?

79
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,020
Stanley doesn't have a son.

80
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:44,055
You must have the wrong number.

81
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:49,416
How old are you?

82
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,458
Why don't you call your mother?

83
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:20,348
Hello. May l please speak
to Mr. Jamal Niang?

84
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:25,245
Mr. Niang, it's Bree Osbourne calling
from the National Home Shopping Club

85
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:28,035
with a special introductory rate
of only $19.90...

86
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:29,618
Hello?

87
00:06:30,997 --> 00:06:33,297
He signed it.

88
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:35,995
l am so proud of you!
Two signatures.

89
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:42,582
l hereby pronounce you officially legal
to undergo sexual reassignment surgery.

90
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:45,055
Thank you.

91
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:49,665
l just...

92
00:06:49,804 --> 00:06:50,804
Mmm.

93
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:52,759
Thank you.

94
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:54,074
So...

95
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,122
What else is new?

96
00:06:58,056 --> 00:07:00,356
l made my sales quota
for the month on Tuesday.

97
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:06,066
That pink lamb's wool cardigan
that l ordered arrived.

98
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:08,364
Oh, and this is odd.

99
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,015
l got a phone call last night

100
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:12,955
from a juvenile inmate
of the New York prison system.

101
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:16,321
- He claimed to be Stanley's son.
- No third person.

102
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,539
My son.

103
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:21,687
l thought you told me
that you were a virgin.

104
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:23,761
Hmm.

105
00:07:23,868 --> 00:07:25,868
There was this one girl at college,

106
00:07:25,883 --> 00:07:28,683
but the whole thing was so...

107
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:32,162
tragically lesbian that
l didn't think it counted.

108
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:33,616
Wow!

109
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:35,456
A son.

110
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:37,475
An alleged son.

111
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,290
He's probably just
some sort of scam artist.

112
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:40,817
What is he scamming you for?

113
00:07:42,388 --> 00:07:43,688
Well, l guess we'll never know.

114
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:45,327
Nothing is gonna stop me

115
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:48,262
from checking into
that hospital next week.

116
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:51,437
l'm not gonna get dragged back
into Stanley's old life.

117
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:54,503
Stanley's life is your life.

118
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:56,878
Why don't you get in touch
with the mother?

119
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:57,973
She's dead.

120
00:07:58,124 --> 00:07:59,924
Anyway, he's practically 1 8.

121
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:02,644
He's old enough
to take care of himself.

122
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:06,886
Bree...
this is a part of your body

123
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:08,648
that cannot be discarded.

124
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:12,327
l don't want you to go through
this metamorphosis

125
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:14,526
only to find out
you're still incomplete.

126
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:19,207
What if l...

127
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:21,531
visit him later...

128
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:23,038
after my surgery...

129
00:08:23,073 --> 00:08:26,073
after l've settled into my new life?

130
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:29,546
When you're ready.

131
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:31,657
What are you doing?

132
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:37,108
l can't give this
to your surgeon right now.

133
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:40,122
Yes, you can.

134
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:42,949
Margaret, l can't miss
my surgery on Friday.

135
00:08:43,032 --> 00:08:46,032
They're booked up a year in advance.

136
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:48,706
l'll wire bail money to New York.

137
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:51,489
l'll-l'll call a social worker

138
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,272
and have someone
check in on him.

139
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:54,303
What do you want me to do?

140
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,250
Bree, honey...

141
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:58,874
l just want you to be ready.

142
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:39,826
Hello. May l please
have the number

143
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:44,037
of the New York City
downtown lock-up?

144
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:00,229
MAN:
Mr. Schupak.

145
00:10:00,372 --> 00:10:01,972
Ms. Schupak.

146
00:10:02,099 --> 00:10:04,399
l mean, Ms. Osbourne.
l changed it.

147
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:08,202
Can l ask what your relationship
is to the prisoner?

148
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,640
Allegedly, l'm his...

149
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,976
allegedly, he's my son.

150
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:15,298
This is a new one.

151
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:17,941
According to this,
he shoplifted a frog.

152
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:20,428
Plus we have testimony
that he was in possession

153
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:23,223
of a small amount
of a suspicious-looking white powder,

154
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:26,805
although emergency services
was unable to recover the evidence.

155
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:29,556
Drugs?

156
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:30,834
ls he an addict?

157
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:32,386
Most of 'em are.

158
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:35,473
Most of whom are?

159
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:37,988
Are you aware that your son's
been hustling on the streets

160
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,283
working as a prostitute?

161
00:10:39,426 --> 00:10:43,726
- How much is the bail?
- Bail's set at one dollar.

162
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,344
l can't possibly afford...

163
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:47,831
one dollar?

164
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:52,281
MAN:
Sabrina Claire Osbourne?

165
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:55,507
Meet Toby Wilkins.

166
00:11:00,248 --> 00:11:01,648
Uh...

167
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:02,792
my friends call me Bree.

168
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:06,942
Jesus the reformer?

169
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,068
That's one of these churches
that sends missionaries out

170
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:12,387
to guide street people back to God.

171
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:14,931
No.

172
00:11:15,026 --> 00:11:16,526
l'm...

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,100
...from the church
of the potential father.

174
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,710
l am a pilgrim

175
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:33,192
l am a stranger

176
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:37,653
Travelin' through

177
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:38,967
Oh, yes.

178
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,049
Dear God...

179
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:49,256
bless this food
and bless this restaurant

180
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:52,378
and all the people in it.

181
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,552
And everyone else...everywhere.

182
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:02,749
Sic transit gloria mundi.
in excelsis Deo.

183
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:04,012
Amen.

184
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,355
Do you have any percs?

185
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:07,506
Vicodin?
Anything with codeine?

186
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:08,809
Sorry. l'm all out.

187
00:12:10,488 --> 00:12:13,088
So why don't you tell me
something about yourself.

188
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:14,575
l'm not naming any names.

189
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:16,514
l said about yourself.

190
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:19,429
ls Toby short for something?

191
00:12:19,508 --> 00:12:21,208
A diminutive?

192
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:22,735
No, it's American.

193
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:27,429
Where do you come from?

194
00:12:27,568 --> 00:12:28,868
Callicoon.

195
00:12:28,912 --> 00:12:29,812
Where's Callicoon?

196
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:31,867
ln Kentucky. Duh.

197
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:33,182
ls that where your family is?

198
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,830
My mother's dead.

199
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,316
She had a stroke.

200
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:43,218
- ls there anyone else?
- l had a step-father.

201
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:46,501
- That's wonderful.
- Me and him don't get along.

202
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:47,567
Why not?

203
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:49,127
T.M.l.

204
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:52,054
Too much information.

205
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:54,437
What about grandparents?

206
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:56,036
Aunts, uncles?

207
00:12:56,163 --> 00:12:58,163
l don't need any family.
l can take care of myself.

208
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:00,834
l'm a loner.

209
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,500
That's wonderful.
That's the spirit.

210
00:13:10,844 --> 00:13:13,444
l've been meanin'
to thank you for bailin' me out.

211
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,686
You're welcome.

212
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:18,438
l decided in jail
l'm gonna give up hustling.

213
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:20,621
lt's degradable.

214
00:13:20,728 --> 00:13:22,928
Degrading.

215
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,370
How many people
inhabit this place?

216
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:30,088
Three.

217
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:31,131
Dude, by the way,

218
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:33,287
l was just holding those drugs
for a friend.

219
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:34,394
l'm not stupid.

220
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:36,549
Junkies just live for the day.

221
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,360
No ambition or anything.

222
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:41,583
- You have ambition?
- Yeah.

223
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:43,646
l'm gonna get a career in the movies.

224
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:53,362
Ten, twenty, forty.

225
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,738
Sixty, eighty.

226
00:14:00,837 --> 00:14:02,737
One hundred.

227
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:04,052
Here.

228
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:07,515
Will that hold you for a while?

229
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:09,954
Yeah.
Dude, this is great.

230
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:12,053
l wish you would
stop calling me dude.

231
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:16,824
Well, l best be on my way.

232
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:19,062
Got a flight to Los Angeles
first thing in the morning.

233
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:21,165
Maybe l'll see ya out there.

234
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,284
That's where they make
the movies, right?

235
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:25,227
l was gonna hitchhike out there
like, maybe, tomorrow.

236
00:14:25,306 --> 00:14:26,606
You can't.

237
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:29,745
You don't wanna add
jumping bail to your permanent record.

238
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:31,716
l'll change my street name.

239
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:33,631
Something like Stanley.

240
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,050
Stan.

241
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:38,893
Stan the man.
That's my dad's name.

242
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:41,771
There's his picture.

243
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:46,105
He's with my mom.

244
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,359
Mmm.

245
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:57,148
You okay?

246
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:59,659
l'm a little dizzy.

247
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,058
Beverly Hills
is close to the ocean, right?

248
00:15:02,153 --> 00:15:04,253
Maybe l'll learn how to surf.

249
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,160
Dye my hair blonde
for the movies.

250
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,679
They love blondes there.

251
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,122
l mean, blonde and blondes.

252
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,258
Stocks and blondes.

253
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,909
Bodacious blonde bottoms.

254
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,440
Not that l'm a bottom or anything.

255
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:17,435
Are you talking about
pornographic films?

256
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:19,110
Duh.

257
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:21,737
ls there a...

258
00:15:21,824 --> 00:15:24,524
ladies room
in this establishment?

259
00:15:32,187 --> 00:15:33,687
Oh!

260
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:39,736
- Hello.
- Margaret.

261
00:15:39,863 --> 00:15:42,163
lt's Bree.
l'm in New York.

262
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:46,562
lt turns out this whole jail episode
was just a big mistake.

263
00:15:46,676 --> 00:15:48,276
Talk to me.

264
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:51,104
He's a thoroughly independent
young man.

265
00:15:51,186 --> 00:15:54,786
We're getting along famously.

266
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,133
He's going to come visit me
after my surgery,

267
00:15:57,231 --> 00:16:00,231
and l promised to take him
to Disneyland.

268
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:01,902
l see.

269
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:03,933
So I tIhougIht I'd take
an early fligIht back tomorrow.

270
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:05,248
get back to work.

271
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:07,388
recoup some of tIhe money
I spent on tIhis trip

272
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,599
before my surgery next week.

273
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,150
- How are you?
- Right now,

274
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:14,141
l'm a little disappointed
because you're lying to me.

275
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:16,816
ls there anything else
you'd like to say?

276
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:19,302
There appears to be a step-father.

277
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:22,197
PerIhaps I can affect a reunion.

278
00:16:22,276 --> 00:16:26,076
Have you ever head of
a place called Callicoon?

279
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:37,831
l just conferred with
my immediate superior at the church.

280
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:40,517
lt seems she feels
that getting you away

281
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:44,807
from this unwholesome
environment is my moral duty.

282
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:47,517
Free ride, free food,
free hotel rooms,

283
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:49,212
all the way to L.A.

284
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,739
Uh-huh.
Nothin's free.

285
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,179
You're gonna end up marryin' her
and spending the rest of your life

286
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,270
eating out cob-webby
old stank Christian pussy.

287
00:16:56,436 --> 00:16:58,436
Hey, something
for the road, my man?

288
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:00,147
The finest Tecate.

289
00:17:00,148 --> 00:17:02,182
Fuck, no, man.
l'm givin' that shit up.

290
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:04,893
Come on. lt's only
five dollars a bag over street price.

291
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:06,376
Convenience charge.

292
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:09,412
We could take it out of your cut
if she buys the car.

293
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,786
Fuck you, dude.

294
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,630
All right.

295
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:14,853
Whatever.
You're the man.

296
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:16,256
No, wait. Hey.

297
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:21,825
l'm not marrying you.

298
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,360
Glory Hallelujah.

299
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:26,815
Almost new fan belt.

300
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,650
l changed the oil
a couple of months ago.

301
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:30,373
Only 230,000 miles.

302
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:32,004
lt just needs a little paint.

303
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:33,736
That's all.
lt runs perfect.

304
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:34,959
Guaranteed.

305
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,414
l've already arranged a rental.

306
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,450
But with this one,
when you get to California,

307
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:40,365
you could resell, make a profit.

308
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,431
A profit?

309
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:47,461
Fasten your seatbelt.

310
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:48,981
l don't like wearing them.

311
00:17:48,982 --> 00:17:52,624
Well, l don't like the idea
of seeing your internal organs

312
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:53,962
splattered all over the dashboard

313
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,510
in case we get in a wreck,
God forbid, so put it on.

314
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
See this shirt?

315
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,479
Only cost me two dollars.

316
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,790
- Quel surprise.
- And the shoes.

317
00:18:03,893 --> 00:18:05,693
Three dollars-- $1 .50 each.

318
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:07,320
You know how much these things
are worth in Japan?

319
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,747
- Three dollars.
- Like $500.

320
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:13,046
Japanese people
will kill for old Nikes.

321
00:18:13,105 --> 00:18:15,205
Then you probably
should avoid wearing them in Japan.

322
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:18,412
Yeah, l'd probably be,
like, disemboweled by a ninja.

323
00:18:18,574 --> 00:18:20,974
You don't have to say ''Like.''

324
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,473
''Probably disemboweled
by a ninja'' is sufficient.

325
00:18:24,524 --> 00:18:27,024
And please don't put your feet
up on the dashboard.

326
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:32,081
No smoking in the car.

327
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,047
l thought instead
of going west on route 95,

328
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:38,234
we'd wind through
the mountains on route 20.

329
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:42,841
- Route 20 takes us close to Callicoon.
- l don't want to go there.

330
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:56,502
What l find absolutely
beyond comprehension

331
00:18:56,573 --> 00:18:59,773
is how a person can perform
all those intimate acts

332
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:02,339
with just any stranger off the street.

333
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:04,326
Why should you give a shit?

334
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:07,245
Because it's
the Christian thing to do.

335
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:12,016
How much money did you make
per...assignation?

336
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:13,922
Forty or fifty dollars.

337
00:19:13,923 --> 00:19:15,345
Are we gonna be
goin' through Texas?

338
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,176
lt's a pretty hard state to avoid.

339
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,990
Do you have any money for some food?

340
00:20:10,747 --> 00:20:12,147
Oh.

341
00:20:12,186 --> 00:20:15,486
Uh, l'm sorry l can't offer you
a private room.

342
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:18,644
The church has to conserve
its resources.

343
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:22,911
l've charted us a course
on the nice little red routes.

344
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:25,733
Callicoon is only about
45 minutes out of our way.

345
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:28,612
l don't wanna go there.

346
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,690
These are nice beds.

347
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:33,801
Don't you have any pajamas?

348
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:35,472
No.

349
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:38,207
Well, you should get some.

350
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,359
Good night.

351
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:55,531
Rise and shine.

352
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,054
Up, up, up.

353
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,389
We've got a schedule to keep.

354
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:06,226
Did l put on too much blush?

355
00:21:06,305 --> 00:21:07,405
You're weird.

356
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,340
Hmm.

357
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,970
First place l lived was, like,
a hole in the wall off Avenue C.

358
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:26,720
l had, like, four roommates.

359
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:30,139
One was a junkie,
one was a crack head,

360
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:32,494
one was, like,
a junkie, and the other one was,

361
00:21:32,597 --> 00:21:34,197
well, like, a junkie.

362
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:35,628
Like, like, like.

363
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:40,842
Did you know
tIhe Lord Of TIhe Rings is gay?

364
00:21:40,945 --> 00:21:42,745
l beg your pardon.

365
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:46,968
There's this big,
black tower, right?

366
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:51,086
And it points right at
this huge burning vagina thing,

367
00:21:51,116 --> 00:21:53,016
and it's, like,
the symbol of ultimate evil.

368
00:21:53,035 --> 00:21:54,035
And then,

369
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,287
Sam and Frodo
have to go into this cave

370
00:21:57,288 --> 00:21:59,957
and deposit their magic ring

371
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,644
into this hot, steaming lava pit.

372
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:04,327
Only at the last minute,

373
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:09,058
Frodo can't perform,
so Gollum bites off his finger.

374
00:22:10,403 --> 00:22:11,903
Gay.

375
00:22:16,257 --> 00:22:17,457
Take 'em away

376
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,104
Take 'em away, Lord

377
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:23,131
Take away these chains from me

378
00:22:23,165 --> 00:22:26,465
My heart is broken
'cause my spirit's not free

379
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,020
Lord, take away
these chains from me

380
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:35,285
Some birds' feathers
are too proud to be caged

381
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:36,656
l know l'm not that colorful

382
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,091
But a bird just the same

383
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:41,935
Open up your gate now,
let me put down my load

384
00:22:41,973 --> 00:22:45,273
So l can feel at ease
and go back to my home

385
00:22:45,427 --> 00:22:47,127
Take 'em away

386
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,550
Take 'em away, Lord

387
00:22:48,594 --> 00:22:52,094
Take away these chains from me

388
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,940
What the fuck you lookin' at?

389
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:56,167
l just didn't think it was right

390
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:00,270
to come so close to Callicoon
without at least passing through.

391
00:23:00,396 --> 00:23:02,396
Toby!

392
00:23:05,098 --> 00:23:06,898
Where are you going?

393
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:11,612
You are acting like
a spoiled child.

394
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,823
Oh, my God,
l can't believe my eyes.

395
00:23:14,886 --> 00:23:17,186
lt's my sweet little angel baby.

396
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:21,532
Take away these chains from me

397
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:25,207
My heart is broken
'cause my spirit's not free

398
00:23:25,345 --> 00:23:27,245
Just give me another hug.

399
00:23:27,264 --> 00:23:29,864
Oh, l could wring your neck
like a chicken.

400
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:30,951
My favorite boy.

401
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:32,106
And all this time,
not even a phone call

402
00:23:32,254 --> 00:23:34,354
to let me know if
you're alive or dead.

403
00:23:34,461 --> 00:23:35,561
l was never your favorite.

404
00:23:35,612 --> 00:23:37,212
Oh, that's what you think.

405
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:39,639
l used to look at him
out that window,

406
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:41,738
playin' all day with that big dog.

407
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:43,049
Toby lived near here?

408
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,901
Just two doors up the road.

409
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,520
So, what you
been doin' with yourself?

410
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:49,407
l wanna know everything.

411
00:23:52,884 --> 00:23:55,084
He's been in New York,
working toward developing

412
00:23:55,187 --> 00:23:56,787
a career in the film industry.

413
00:23:56,788 --> 00:23:58,622
l'm goin' to California.

414
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,837
California?!

415
00:24:00,944 --> 00:24:03,244
He always was the artistic type.

416
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:06,443
He used to have
this precious stuffed monkey

417
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,310
he carried around with him everywhere,
even to school.

418
00:24:09,484 --> 00:24:11,884
Are you in
the movie business, too?

419
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:13,179
She's a missionary with the church.

420
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:15,027
Praise the Lord.

421
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:16,846
l'm an electrologist myself.

422
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:18,069
Oh.

423
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,220
lf you want, l can get

424
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:22,068
those couple of little hairs
up under your nose in nothin' flat.

425
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:26,341
My boss lady down at the salon,

426
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:28,769
she used to work out in California.

427
00:24:28,772 --> 00:24:32,872
From what l hear, some of them
Hollywood beauties

428
00:24:32,994 --> 00:24:34,994
used to be hairy as hogs.

429
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:37,368
There.

430
00:24:37,504 --> 00:24:39,604
That oughta keep 'em from
stickin' their heads up again.

431
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:40,711
Thank you.

432
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,470
You ought to go on over
and say hello to your step-daddy.

433
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,949
- l don't wanna see him.
- Of course you do.

434
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,248
The man raised you.

435
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:50,291
Clothed you.
Fed you.

436
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:51,866
Sheltered you from harm.

437
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:53,593
He's your father...

438
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,820
for all practical purposes.

439
00:24:56,887 --> 00:24:59,487
He always was a sensitive thing.

440
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:02,973
You gonna drive him
all the way to California?

441
00:25:03,987 --> 00:25:07,387
l have to get some air.
Excuse me, and thank you.

442
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,917
- Yeah?
- Good evening.

443
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:23,116
Do you per chance
know a Toby Wilkins?

444
00:25:23,117 --> 00:25:24,483
Who's askin'?

445
00:25:24,618 --> 00:25:26,918
l am a bearer of glad tidings.

446
00:25:27,017 --> 00:25:29,517
Your son has come home.

447
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:32,651
Good.

448
00:25:32,774 --> 00:25:35,074
- Toby, Arletty.

449
00:25:35,173 --> 00:25:36,473
l brought back a surprise.

450
00:25:37,764 --> 00:25:38,764
Come on in.

451
00:25:41,602 --> 00:25:43,702
Look who's here.

452
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,509
lf you can't bring
Mohammad to the mountain,

453
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:48,192
bring the mountain to Mohammad.

454
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:50,219
Look how much you've grown.

455
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:52,634
Toby, give your father a hug.

456
00:25:52,637 --> 00:25:54,137
l was worried sick about you.

457
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:56,872
Why did you run off like that?
You know l missed you.

458
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,055
- lsn't this sweet?
- Mm-Hmm.

459
00:25:58,106 --> 00:25:59,506
l know what you missed.

460
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,442
You missed my mouth.
You missed my ass.

461
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:02,661
You hush now.

462
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:04,012
What are these ladies gonna think?

463
00:26:04,152 --> 00:26:05,852
You wanna fuck me
right here in front of 'em?

464
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:06,879
You shut up!

465
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:08,934
Bobby!

466
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:10,045
Was that good for you?

467
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,501
Come on, Bobby.

468
00:26:12,596 --> 00:26:14,096
You liked it.

469
00:26:14,227 --> 00:26:15,827
- You liked it in the garage.
- Shut up!

470
00:26:18,737 --> 00:26:19,837
Come on.

471
00:26:26,413 --> 00:26:28,413
Toby?

472
00:26:29,484 --> 00:26:30,884
Honey?

473
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:44,802
This man is heavy with sin.

474
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:46,633
Put him in that chair there.

475
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:54,421
l don't know you,
Bobby Jensen.

476
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:57,628
He'll come to in a couple of hours.

477
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:12,361
This isn't my fault!

478
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:17,319
You never told me
why you didn't want to come home.

479
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:23,104
Where are you going?

480
00:27:44,137 --> 00:27:46,537
Brought you some breakfast.

481
00:27:57,283 --> 00:28:00,483
He's walkin' down to the highway ramp
to hitchhike hisself a ride.

482
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:03,146
He's a disappearing act, all right.

483
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:05,729
lt's the same thing he did
after his mama killed herself.

484
00:28:05,823 --> 00:28:08,623
- She what?
- Mm-hmm.

485
00:28:08,624 --> 00:28:11,006
Shut herself up in the garage
with the car on.

486
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:14,465
Toby found her there
when he come home from school.

487
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:17,399
Oh, God.

488
00:28:55,337 --> 00:28:58,637
Lovely scenery
in this part of the country.

489
00:28:58,638 --> 00:29:00,199
l said l'd take a ride from you.

490
00:29:00,326 --> 00:29:03,326
l never said l'd carry on
a fucking conversation.

491
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:05,601
l was just trying to do you a favor.

492
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,500
God knows,

493
00:29:07,523 --> 00:29:09,523
considering the way
you've been living your life,

494
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:11,538
it wasn't unreasonable
to try to put you under

495
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,849
some sort of parental supervision.

496
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:16,008
What's that?

497
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,259
ls that drugs?

498
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,415
Oh, no.
Absolutely not.

499
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:21,769
Goddamn it!

500
00:29:23,068 --> 00:29:26,168
No! That is not all right.
You can't do that here.

501
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:27,334
Are you gonna let me do my thing,

502
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:29,486
or do l have to get out
of this fucking car right now?

503
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:32,197
- Huh?
- Go ahead.

504
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,980
Kill yourself.

505
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:37,742
What does it matter to me?

506
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:47,615
One chocolate milkshake for you
and coffee for your mother.

507
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:50,233
- l'm not his mother.
- She's not my mother.

508
00:29:50,234 --> 00:29:51,723
Thank you.

509
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,350
You promised
with the new moon

510
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:05,665
You'd be comin' back to me

511
00:30:05,768 --> 00:30:08,168
Now many moons have passed

512
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:10,267
Still l'm waitin' patiently

513
00:30:10,374 --> 00:30:14,674
There's a new moon
over my shoulder

514
00:30:14,788 --> 00:30:18,988
And an old love
still in my heart

515
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:48,066
l didn't sleep a wink last night.

516
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:50,681
- Let's look for a motel.
- l'm camping out.

517
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:08,817
Do you have something
a trifle less...butch?

518
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:12,626
Fettuccine al fredo

519
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:14,249
or chicken cordon bleu.

520
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:16,824
Chicken.

521
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:20,275
Uh... matches?

522
00:31:25,124 --> 00:31:26,224
Fuck!

523
00:31:28,194 --> 00:31:29,394
Excuse me.

524
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:31,538
l have to go to the ladies room.

525
00:31:43,547 --> 00:31:45,747
Do you think there
are snakes around here?

526
00:31:48,729 --> 00:31:50,529
Shoo! Shoo!

527
00:31:50,648 --> 00:31:52,348
Shoo!!

528
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,575
Get away, snake.

529
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:56,982
Get away, you snake.

530
00:31:57,077 --> 00:31:58,377
Get away, snake.

531
00:32:17,323 --> 00:32:18,923
Where did you get that?

532
00:32:18,955 --> 00:32:21,055
l had it.

533
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:26,473
- What is that awful sound?
- lt's a loon.

534
00:32:26,474 --> 00:32:30,539
Certain Native American tribes
of the Northern plains

535
00:32:30,565 --> 00:32:33,365
believed loons were ancestral spirits,

536
00:32:33,444 --> 00:32:36,744
trying to communicate
with the physical world.

537
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:41,022
My real dad's part lndian.

538
00:32:41,121 --> 00:32:44,721
- ls he?
- Yeah.

539
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:47,363
l mean, he never told me,
but l just know.

540
00:32:47,454 --> 00:32:48,754
lt's an lndian thing.

541
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:55,207
Do you think you could find it
in your heart

542
00:32:55,322 --> 00:32:58,422
to offer a sip of that to a lady?

543
00:33:02,327 --> 00:33:04,127
Are you sick or something?

544
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:09,876
l'm fine.

545
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,155
These are vitamins.

546
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:17,058
When l was a little girl,
l had a terrycloth bunny.

547
00:33:17,104 --> 00:33:18,804
l used to sleep with her every night.

548
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:21,431
- Try holding your breath.

549
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:22,622
Then one day, my parents decided

550
00:33:22,765 --> 00:33:27,165
l was too old for her,
and l never saw her again.

551
00:33:29,002 --> 00:33:30,302
l found...

552
00:33:30,346 --> 00:33:32,146
him...

553
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:34,565
in your step-father's garage.

554
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:36,064
Oh!

555
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:41,166
Oh!

556
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:44,385
Oh, uh... here.

557
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:10,481
Rise and shine.
Come on.

558
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,755
Let's go.

559
00:34:12,854 --> 00:34:15,354
l've gotta be in L.A.
By the end of the week.

560
00:34:15,445 --> 00:34:17,445
What would you say if l told you

561
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,756
l could set you up with a job
in the telemarketing field?

562
00:34:20,915 --> 00:34:24,815
The nice thing about telemarketing
is you can live practically anyplace.

563
00:34:24,816 --> 00:34:27,153
l could drop you off in Austin.

564
00:34:27,344 --> 00:34:29,144
l'm going to California.

565
00:34:29,145 --> 00:34:32,171
My real dad has
a mansion there with a pool.

566
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:37,133
What do you see your life like
ten years from now?

567
00:34:37,227 --> 00:34:39,627
Probably get a job at a pet store.

568
00:34:39,722 --> 00:34:41,722
Have a dog, maybe some kids.

569
00:34:41,737 --> 00:34:43,937
Kids.

570
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,240
l always wanted kids.

571
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,990
Perhaps you ought to aim for
something a little higher

572
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:53,241
than working in a pet store.

573
00:34:53,252 --> 00:34:57,252
lf you like animals,
you could become a veterinarian

574
00:34:57,282 --> 00:34:58,982
or a zoologist.

575
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,840
l'm out of cigarettes.

576
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:04,947
Quel dommage.

577
00:35:05,054 --> 00:35:07,354
What does quel dommage mean?

578
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:09,757
lt means you're not
getting any cigarettes.

579
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,911
Are you a boy or a girl?

580
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:53,705
Turn around and stop
botherin' people.

581
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:01,469
Margaret, thank God.

582
00:36:01,476 --> 00:36:03,576
l am in the middle of Arkansas,

583
00:36:03,587 --> 00:36:06,387
and an eight-year-old child
just read me.

584
00:36:06,388 --> 00:36:08,370
l can't handle this.

585
00:36:08,481 --> 00:36:10,781
l had to camp out last night...

586
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,780
on the ground...

587
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:14,599
with bugs.

588
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:20,185
Because he is impossible.

589
00:36:20,283 --> 00:36:22,883
l can't fritter away
my savings like this.

590
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,970
- My surgery's only five days away.
- Shit!

591
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:27,441
Dallas?
l don't know.

592
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:29,476
Four or five hours.
Why?

593
00:36:31,894 --> 00:36:33,194
Ho-ho-hold on.

594
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:37,793
Toby.
Toby!

595
00:36:37,843 --> 00:36:40,343
Would you mind introducing me
to your new friend?

596
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:43,961
Taylor.

597
00:36:43,985 --> 00:36:47,085
Yeah.
This is Taylor.

598
00:36:47,086 --> 00:36:48,655
lt's nice to meet you, Taylor.

599
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:49,986
What's goin' on here?

600
00:36:49,987 --> 00:36:51,134
Come on.

601
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:52,877
Your mother's waitin'
for you in the car.

602
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:56,104
You better watch out he doesn't get
some poor, innocent girl in trouble.

603
00:36:56,105 --> 00:36:57,575
You better watch out
she doesn't end up

604
00:36:57,706 --> 00:37:00,006
ruining some poor,
innocent boy's life.

605
00:37:00,105 --> 00:37:01,405
You...

606
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:03,148
go wait for me at the table.

607
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,030
Margaret...

608
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:11,169
l really don't think
l am cut out to be a mother.

609
00:37:31,962 --> 00:37:35,162
Dear God, bless this meal,

610
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:37,821
and please help Toby
to find the strength

611
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,716
not to take any more drugs,

612
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:42,735
so that when we get to L.A.,
he can get a job

613
00:37:42,805 --> 00:37:44,005
and find a nice apartment

614
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:46,649
so that even if he never finds
his real father,

615
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,640
he can lead an independent life.

616
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:49,959
Amen.

617
00:37:50,578 --> 00:37:52,178
Amen.

618
00:37:54,128 --> 00:37:57,928
There's a really cool hat back there.
lt's only ten dollars.

619
00:37:58,062 --> 00:37:59,562
l think my nose is getting sunburned.

620
00:37:59,598 --> 00:38:01,798
Eat your vegetables.

621
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:09,851
You might want to use a fork.
Just an idea.

622
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:14,991
l tell you what.

623
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:16,942
You can have that hat
on one condition.

624
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:17,962
No more drugs.

625
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:19,721
l mean it.

626
00:38:20,996 --> 00:38:21,996
Deal?

627
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:25,199
Deal.

628
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:41,971
Got you a present.

629
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,610
Thank you. l'm very...

630
00:38:43,641 --> 00:38:45,041
touched.

631
00:38:46,232 --> 00:38:47,132
Put it on.

632
00:38:53,045 --> 00:38:54,745
lt looks good.

633
00:38:54,772 --> 00:38:59,472
l found Jesus
in the darkest night

634
00:38:59,474 --> 00:39:01,974
You get back in here!

635
00:39:02,065 --> 00:39:05,465
Do you have any idea
how dangerous that is?

636
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,919
ln, in!

637
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:09,859
- ln!
- Okay.

638
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:12,033
Get in!

639
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,440
- was holding on.
- You wanna give me a heart attack?

640
00:39:15,595 --> 00:39:17,895
Did l scare you?

641
00:39:26,725 --> 00:39:28,525
Why are we goin' to Dallas?

642
00:39:28,645 --> 00:39:30,745
An associate of mine

643
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:33,852
has arranged a place
for us to stay for the night.

644
00:39:39,392 --> 00:39:41,392
This Mary Ellen woman's
being very generous

645
00:39:41,503 --> 00:39:43,503
to offer us her hospitality,

646
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:46,414
so l hope you will be
on your best behavior.

647
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:48,392
l'm always on my best behavior.

648
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,950
Sabrina and Toby, right?

649
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:56,228
l'm Mary Ellen.

650
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,680
Come on in.

651
00:39:57,815 --> 00:39:59,215
l'm havin' a little get-together.

652
00:39:59,254 --> 00:40:02,054
You two just come on in
and make yourselves at home.

653
00:40:02,229 --> 00:40:03,629
Mary Ellen, come here.

654
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,368
Felicia's showing us
her new vagina.

655
00:40:06,643 --> 00:40:09,843
l'm sorry.
They're feelin' a little feisty.

656
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:12,106
Everybody, this is Sabrina,

657
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,809
and her handsome
escort here is Toby.

658
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:15,899
- Hi.
- Hi.

659
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,155
How y'all?

660
00:40:18,638 --> 00:40:20,638
Margaret said you were stealth.

661
00:40:20,653 --> 00:40:22,453
l am in public,

662
00:40:22,572 --> 00:40:26,072
but this is the privacy
of my own home.

663
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:28,718
Welcome to the first meetin'
of the gender pride

664
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:32,509
President's Day weekend
Caribbean cruise planning committee.

665
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:37,246
- We have to go.
- No.

666
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:39,349
Where you guys know each other from?

667
00:40:39,364 --> 00:40:40,664
We don't.

668
00:40:40,707 --> 00:40:42,807
She's a friend of a friend....

669
00:40:42,914 --> 00:40:44,214
of a friend.

670
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:47,754
There's rum punch in the kitchen
and guacamole in the dining room.

671
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:51,208
Yeah, don't be so uptight.
lt's a party.

672
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:02,799
Margaret told me you were plannin'
to have your surgery soon.

673
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,477
Toby doesn't know about me.

674
00:41:05,656 --> 00:41:07,156
You're stealth to him?

675
00:41:07,191 --> 00:41:09,191
Oh, sugar dumplin'!

676
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:11,102
Don't worry, honey.
We've all been there.

677
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:12,721
l'll pass the word.

678
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,260
lt was one of those
instant best friend things.

679
00:41:17,362 --> 00:41:19,562
At the time, we were
both straight men.

680
00:41:19,665 --> 00:41:21,065
What could you do with that?

681
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:22,809
We had our surgery on the same day.

682
00:41:22,928 --> 00:41:26,028
We ended up holding hands
in the recovery room.

683
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:29,198
And now this gorgeous creature's
the love of my life.

684
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,200
We were just telling your friend

685
00:41:32,332 --> 00:41:34,632
a little bit about
the transsexual lifestyle.

686
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,030
Mmm.

687
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:40,070
Not what you're
used to in church, huh?

688
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:42,008
These are vaginal dilators.

689
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:44,419
She just had her surgery last month.

690
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:46,018
This is Keanu two.

691
00:41:46,053 --> 00:41:47,353
This is Keanu three.

692
00:41:47,493 --> 00:41:49,393
Where's Keanu one?

693
00:41:49,394 --> 00:41:51,716
Keanu one is in Hollywood
filming a major science-fiction epic,

694
00:41:51,811 --> 00:41:54,411
and we don't want to hear
a snarky remark about him.

695
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:58,293
We're not gender-challenged,
we're gender-gifted.

696
00:41:58,336 --> 00:42:00,236
l've been woman
and l've been man,

697
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,051
and l know more things
than you single-sex people

698
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:05,533
can even imagine.

699
00:42:05,628 --> 00:42:07,628
Dude, l thought you were a real guy.

700
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:11,783
We walk among you.

701
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:16,165
That poor thing couldn't pass
on a dark night at 200 yards.

702
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:17,679
ln the pink.

703
00:42:18,966 --> 00:42:23,066
You better check your T-dar, honey.
She's a G.G.

704
00:42:23,092 --> 00:42:25,892
- A what?
- A genuine girl.

705
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:27,871
From Mary Kay.

706
00:42:27,986 --> 00:42:31,486
lf you let her do a color trial,
she'll give you a free compact.

707
00:42:31,536 --> 00:42:34,536
Oh, give me a home

708
00:42:34,607 --> 00:42:37,607
Where the buffalo roam

709
00:42:37,677 --> 00:42:41,877
And the deer
and the antelope play

710
00:42:41,995 --> 00:42:44,195
With each other

711
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:48,098
Where seldom is heard

712
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:51,641
A discouraging word

713
00:42:51,783 --> 00:42:57,183
And the skies
are not cloudy all day

714
00:42:57,252 --> 00:42:58,652
Everybody!

715
00:42:58,788 --> 00:43:04,488
Home, home on the range

716
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:10,045
Where the deer
and the antelope play

717
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:13,606
Where seldom is heard

718
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:16,661
A discouraging word

719
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:20,327
And the skies
are not cloudy all day

720
00:43:22,393 --> 00:43:23,693
Oh!

721
00:43:23,832 --> 00:43:25,132
Ah!

722
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:28,819
Sorry.

723
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:34,209
Could you hand me
my robe, please?

724
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:35,991
The pink satin.

725
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,914
lt's by the...

726
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:39,834
thank you.

727
00:43:48,013 --> 00:43:53,013
lt's an unfortunate side effect
of my pills.

728
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,599
They're a diuretic.

729
00:43:56,937 --> 00:43:57,837
Gross.

730
00:43:57,896 --> 00:43:59,496
A diuretic.

731
00:43:59,624 --> 00:44:03,424
lt means you go
number one, not number two.

732
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:09,158
Listen, l'm sorry about
those ersatz women.

733
00:44:09,219 --> 00:44:10,919
What?

734
00:44:10,946 --> 00:44:14,146
Ersatz.
lt means phony.

735
00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:16,809
Something pretending to be
something it's not.

736
00:44:19,295 --> 00:44:21,095
l thought they were nice.

737
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:25,061
Zoologists are the guys
that work in the zoos, right?

738
00:44:25,148 --> 00:44:27,348
Yes, among other places.

739
00:44:27,451 --> 00:44:30,051
l never met my real dad.

740
00:44:30,138 --> 00:44:31,738
My mom never talked about him.

741
00:44:31,865 --> 00:44:34,365
l'm gonna go
live with him, though.

742
00:44:34,456 --> 00:44:35,556
As soon as l get enough money,

743
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:38,207
l can get some nice clothes,

744
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:39,990
and knock on his door, surprise him.

745
00:44:40,021 --> 00:44:43,521
Do your mom and dad
live in California, too?

746
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:45,967
My parents are dead.

747
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:49,781
Do you like zoos?

748
00:44:51,536 --> 00:44:54,436
l don't mind
the modern ones, l guess.

749
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:59,010
The animals may not be free,
but they're safe.

750
00:45:00,747 --> 00:45:03,347
Yeah.
Me, too.

751
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,270
Night.

752
00:45:07,464 --> 00:45:08,764
Good night.

753
00:45:14,565 --> 00:45:16,265
- Did you go to college?
- Yes.

754
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:18,792
- What did you study?
- A lot of things.

755
00:45:18,793 --> 00:45:20,387
French, cultural anthropology,

756
00:45:20,514 --> 00:45:24,214
archaeology, psychology,
art history. Y uck.

757
00:45:24,257 --> 00:45:25,657
Possum.

758
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:27,492
Biology.

759
00:45:27,615 --> 00:45:30,915
80 million years ago
during the cretaceous period,

760
00:45:30,974 --> 00:45:34,374
these plains were the floor
of a huge inland sea.

761
00:45:34,428 --> 00:45:36,628
We there yet?

762
00:45:36,731 --> 00:45:39,631
lf you don't wanna learn anything,
then never mind.

763
00:45:41,912 --> 00:45:43,512
All right, l'm listening.

764
00:45:43,544 --> 00:45:46,944
lt cut the entire continent in two.

765
00:45:46,998 --> 00:45:48,998
Dinosaurs lived on either side.

766
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:51,509
Then a huge meteor struck the earth.

767
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:54,008
Some people say that's why
the dinosaurs went extinct,

768
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:58,599
but why should the insects,
birds and mammals have survived?

769
00:45:58,705 --> 00:46:01,805
- Why?
- l don't know,

770
00:46:01,871 --> 00:46:05,171
but it's always seemed
a little bit fishy to me.

771
00:46:05,326 --> 00:46:07,026
Did you know they found
giant shark remains

772
00:46:07,053 --> 00:46:08,453
in the middle of Kansas?

773
00:46:08,588 --> 00:46:09,788
How big were they?

774
00:46:09,932 --> 00:46:12,432
Big enough to swallow you
without even chewing.

775
00:46:29,507 --> 00:46:31,607
- Got you.
- You did not.

776
00:46:33,153 --> 00:46:35,853
- l got you.

777
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,375
Ah, you got me in the eye,
you got me in the eye.

778
00:46:39,486 --> 00:46:41,586
l'm so sorry.
Did l hurt you?

779
00:46:41,693 --> 00:46:43,793
Ha ha! Got you.

780
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,800
Ow!

781
00:46:45,819 --> 00:46:47,619
Stop it.

782
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,538
Ow!

783
00:46:49,657 --> 00:46:51,257
Seriously, watch the road.

784
00:46:52,344 --> 00:46:53,744
You drive.

785
00:46:53,783 --> 00:46:55,083
l hope we pass a rest stop soon.

786
00:46:55,223 --> 00:46:56,823
My diuretic's kicking in.

787
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:09,045
Do rattlesnakes come out at night?

788
00:47:54,331 --> 00:47:55,931
Well...

789
00:47:57,498 --> 00:48:00,198
l must say, that's a relief.

790
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,900
Something wrong?

791
00:48:21,391 --> 00:48:23,391
This is a no-smoking room.

792
00:48:37,607 --> 00:48:41,107
New Mexico is
the ufology capital of the world.

793
00:48:41,108 --> 00:48:43,062
Ufology.

794
00:48:43,077 --> 00:48:44,477
From U.F.O.

795
00:48:44,612 --> 00:48:47,812
The study of
unidentified flying objects.

796
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:53,175
You know, social ostracism
doesn't work in a community of two.

797
00:48:54,784 --> 00:48:57,684
Damn it, Toby, say something.

798
00:48:57,758 --> 00:48:59,458
l wanna go to Sammy's Wigwam.

799
00:49:05,722 --> 00:49:07,022
Here's some arrowheads.

800
00:49:07,066 --> 00:49:08,966
They're only a dollar each.

801
00:49:12,343 --> 00:49:13,843
He's been acting like that all day.

802
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,981
Young man, if you don't
start behaving in a civilized fashion,

803
00:49:21,075 --> 00:49:22,675
you and l are going to have
a very serious problem.

804
00:49:22,803 --> 00:49:23,803
Fuck you.

805
00:49:23,858 --> 00:49:26,258
Hey, you watch your mouth
around your mother.

806
00:49:26,449 --> 00:49:28,149
She is not my mother!
She's not anyone's mother.

807
00:49:28,176 --> 00:49:29,576
She's not even a real woman.

808
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:31,611
She's got a dick.

809
00:49:31,726 --> 00:49:32,826
Don't you?!

810
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:35,838
Don't you?
Go on, tell him.

811
00:49:41,418 --> 00:49:43,818
You're a fuckin' lying freak.

812
00:49:48,999 --> 00:49:50,899
What do you want outta me?

813
00:49:50,918 --> 00:49:52,918
Just because a person
doesn't go around

814
00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:55,229
blabbing her entire biological history

815
00:49:55,332 --> 00:49:57,332
to everyone she meets
doesn't make her a liar.

816
00:49:57,347 --> 00:49:59,047
Why didn't you
just tell me the truth?

817
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,370
So you could humiliate me
in public even sooner?

818
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,932
You knew all about me.

819
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:12,509
Why did you bail me out of jail?

820
00:50:12,604 --> 00:50:15,804
You just walked into jail,
asked 'em who needed help?

821
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:19,581
You know what, fuck you!

822
00:50:19,582 --> 00:50:21,412
l never even heard of
a tranny church lady.

823
00:50:21,528 --> 00:50:23,628
Just drop me off
in the next town.

824
00:50:26,517 --> 00:50:30,717
So you don't think l have
the right to belong to a church?

825
00:50:30,835 --> 00:50:33,935
My body may be a work in progress,

826
00:50:33,936 --> 00:50:36,206
but there is nothing
wrong with my soul.

827
00:50:36,305 --> 00:50:39,405
Jesus made me this way for a reason

828
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:42,967
so l could suffer and be reborn
the way he was.

829
00:50:43,885 --> 00:50:45,985
So you're cutting
your dick off for Jesus?

830
00:50:45,996 --> 00:50:47,496
You don't cut it off.

831
00:50:47,532 --> 00:50:49,532
Just gonna have an inny
instead of an outie.

832
00:50:49,643 --> 00:50:51,143
Eww.

833
00:50:51,274 --> 00:50:52,874
Hi.
ls there any chance

834
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:55,301
that you could offer
a fellow traveler a ride?

835
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,000
Absolutely.

836
00:50:57,001 --> 00:50:58,335
We love helping strangers.

837
00:51:04,324 --> 00:51:06,524
Beef jerky?

838
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:07,631
Uh, no thanks.

839
00:51:07,778 --> 00:51:08,678
l'm a level four vegan.

840
00:51:08,738 --> 00:51:11,038
l don't eat anything
that casts a shadow,

841
00:51:11,137 --> 00:51:14,337
but a little token of my appreciation.

842
00:51:14,399 --> 00:51:15,699
Absolutely.

843
00:51:25,146 --> 00:51:28,946
l'm sorry, but the secondary smoke
might render me unfit to drive.

844
00:51:28,984 --> 00:51:31,584
She's cool, right?

845
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,571
She's not a she,
she's got a dick.

846
00:51:34,646 --> 00:51:35,746
Toby!

847
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:36,993
For now, at least.

848
00:51:37,045 --> 00:51:38,745
You're a guy?

849
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:42,959
l'm a transsexual woman.

850
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:44,690
Wow!

851
00:51:44,817 --> 00:51:48,117
l think transsexuality
is a radically evolved state of being.

852
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:52,174
Hey, look.

853
00:51:53,645 --> 00:51:55,545
Many societies throughout history

854
00:51:55,564 --> 00:51:58,664
have honored and revered
transgendered people--

855
00:51:58,827 --> 00:51:59,927
The Zulu, the Yoruba.

856
00:51:59,978 --> 00:52:03,178
The Native Americans
called us two-spirit people.

857
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:06,037
Two spirits.
That's cool.

858
00:52:06,038 --> 00:52:08,723
Tell him what they're
gonna do with your dick.

859
00:52:08,724 --> 00:52:09,910
Then the settlers came.

860
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:12,058
They tended to murder us on sight.

861
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:15,365
The way the white man treated
the lndian was very deeply fucked up.

862
00:52:15,523 --> 00:52:16,623
Yeah.

863
00:52:16,674 --> 00:52:18,374
Are you sure you won't join us?

864
00:52:18,498 --> 00:52:19,598
Come on.

865
00:52:19,745 --> 00:52:21,445
We know what you got.

866
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,172
You boys go ahead.
Have fun.

867
00:52:31,835 --> 00:52:35,735
So what do you do
when you're not following the open road?

868
00:52:36,633 --> 00:52:38,433
l'm a Peyote shaman.

869
00:52:38,552 --> 00:52:40,452
How do you do that?

870
00:52:40,453 --> 00:52:43,976
lt involves consuming
majestic amounts of peyote.

871
00:52:44,022 --> 00:52:47,522
When you're done throwing up,
you see things.

872
00:52:50,547 --> 00:52:54,747
- What things?
- Once l saw my own death.

873
00:52:54,769 --> 00:52:57,069
Do you by any chance
drown in a desert lake?

874
00:52:57,168 --> 00:53:01,868
No. l die in
a depressurization accident

875
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:03,670
on a moon colony.

876
00:53:03,693 --> 00:53:05,493
l'll show you something.

877
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,416
lt's in my bag.

878
00:53:14,056 --> 00:53:16,756
Do you still think what you said
back at Sammy's Wigwam?

879
00:53:16,757 --> 00:53:18,843
What?

880
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:22,865
That l'm a freak.

881
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,250
You're not a freak.

882
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:29,102
You're just a liar.

883
00:53:38,237 --> 00:53:40,237
Oh, shit!

884
00:53:40,252 --> 00:53:41,952
My purse!

885
00:53:42,075 --> 00:53:44,075
My hormones!

886
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:45,190
You dirty motherfucker!

887
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:50,761
My dog book was in that car.

888
00:53:50,807 --> 00:53:52,807
Oh.

889
00:53:55,701 --> 00:53:59,301
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

890
00:54:00,499 --> 00:54:03,099
My surgery.

891
00:54:06,064 --> 00:54:10,064
l have to be in L.A. ln two days.
What are we going to do?

892
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:18,799
ls it soothing?

893
00:54:18,826 --> 00:54:20,126
We could sell it.

894
00:54:20,265 --> 00:54:21,865
How much could you get?

895
00:54:28,997 --> 00:54:30,097
Oh, sweet.

896
00:54:30,149 --> 00:54:31,549
Come on.
Let's go.

897
00:55:10,546 --> 00:55:11,746
Oh!

898
00:55:11,747 --> 00:55:13,398
Oh!

899
00:56:05,145 --> 00:56:06,345
l don't care about the car.

900
00:56:06,346 --> 00:56:09,497
l just need to get to Los Angeles
as quickly as possible.

901
00:56:09,655 --> 00:56:11,255
l'm driving a couple of good ponies

902
00:56:11,286 --> 00:56:13,886
over to the sale in Show Low
in the morning.

903
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:15,869
Could give you a ride that far.

904
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:21,175
Hey, Woodrow, can l get
a burger for the young lady here?

905
00:56:21,266 --> 00:56:22,466
Yep.

906
00:56:43,911 --> 00:56:47,211
lsn't Calvin an unusual name
for a Native American?

907
00:56:47,366 --> 00:56:48,766
Not really.

908
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:51,009
My brothers names are Dwight, Lloyd,
Daryl and Woodrow.

909
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,330
What's your last name?

910
00:56:56,481 --> 00:56:58,881
Many Goats.
lt's my mother's clan name.

911
00:56:58,976 --> 00:57:02,076
Oh.
Matrilineal kinship system.

912
00:57:04,734 --> 00:57:06,434
ls there a Mrs. Many Goats?

913
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:08,661
Oh, no.
No, not yet.

914
00:57:08,764 --> 00:57:11,864
l guess the right woman
hasn't met me.

915
00:57:11,865 --> 00:57:14,534
Oh!
There you are.

916
00:57:14,713 --> 00:57:17,413
Calvin, l'd like
you to meet Toby.

917
00:57:17,496 --> 00:57:19,596
- Toby, this is Calvin Many Coats.
- How you doin', son?

918
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:23,303
l saved you half a hamburger.

919
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:25,449
Calvin's offered us
a place to stay tonight

920
00:57:25,556 --> 00:57:26,556
and a ride in the morning.

921
00:57:26,612 --> 00:57:29,412
- lsn't that generous of him?
- Yes.

922
00:57:30,354 --> 00:57:33,854
Oh.
Excuse me just a minute.

923
00:57:33,904 --> 00:57:35,504
Yes, ma'am.

924
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:43,374
You-you already found a buyer?

925
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:48,751
At least now you don't have
any more of that damn drug.

926
00:57:51,368 --> 00:57:53,668
Mm, shower.

927
00:57:53,767 --> 00:57:55,367
So...

928
00:57:57,989 --> 00:58:02,189
Calvin, have you spent all your life
in New Mexico?

929
00:58:02,307 --> 00:58:03,507
Not yet.

930
00:58:03,508 --> 00:58:04,459
Oh!

931
00:58:12,766 --> 00:58:14,666
lt's beautiful.

932
00:58:14,781 --> 00:58:16,281
lt's home.

933
00:58:38,674 --> 00:58:39,974
Hi.

934
00:58:46,831 --> 00:58:47,831
lt's Mescal.

935
00:58:47,886 --> 00:58:48,986
Oh.

936
00:58:49,037 --> 00:58:52,337
Friend of mine brings it up
from Oaxaca every year.

937
00:58:59,497 --> 00:59:01,597
Beautiful dreamer

938
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,604
Wake unto me

939
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:07,819
Starlight and dewdrops
are waiting for thee

940
00:59:07,941 --> 00:59:11,241
Sounds of the rude world

941
00:59:11,299 --> 00:59:13,699
Heard in the day

942
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:18,398
Lulled by the moonlight
have all passed away

943
00:59:20,511 --> 00:59:23,411
Beautiful dreamer

944
00:59:23,582 --> 00:59:26,382
Queen of my song

945
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:31,460
List while l woo thee
with soft melody

946
00:59:31,546 --> 00:59:36,846
Gone are the cares
of life's busy throng

947
00:59:36,919 --> 00:59:41,219
Beautiful dreamer
awake unto me

948
00:59:41,237 --> 00:59:44,337
Beautiful dreamer

949
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,600
Awake unto me

950
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:52,321
You can sing.

951
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:54,464
Oh, just enough to keep the dogs

952
00:59:54,479 --> 00:59:57,279
off the back porch, that's all.

953
00:59:58,605 --> 00:59:59,805
Have some more.

954
01:00:02,252 --> 01:00:03,252
Thank you.

955
01:00:12,423 --> 01:00:13,823
That'll put hair on your chest.

956
01:00:13,862 --> 01:00:16,162
l hope not.

957
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,280
Morning, sleepyhead.

958
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:39,627
Guess what.

959
01:00:39,674 --> 01:00:42,174
Calvin's gonna drive us
all the way to Phoenix.

960
01:00:44,376 --> 01:00:46,476
Do my breasts seem smaller to you?

961
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:48,883
l've missed two doses of my pills.

962
01:00:48,982 --> 01:00:51,082
You play with the body's
hormonal balance,

963
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,789
and you're playing with fire.

964
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:55,916
Playing with fire.

965
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:58,087
Playing with fire.

966
01:01:05,774 --> 01:01:07,274
When you wear your cowboy hat,

967
01:01:07,406 --> 01:01:10,506
if you wear it forward like that,
that means you're lookin' for trouble.

968
01:01:10,507 --> 01:01:13,376
lf you wear it back like that,
it means you're not lookin' for trouble.

969
01:01:13,547 --> 01:01:14,847
lf you wear it off to the side,

970
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:17,590
it means you're out
to impress the ladies.

971
01:01:17,673 --> 01:01:20,173
How come an lndian
wears a cowboy hat?

972
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:22,264
l guess because it keeps the sun
out of my eyes

973
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:25,375
better than a headband
and a couple of eagle feathers.

974
01:01:25,541 --> 01:01:27,941
Calvin was telling me
that his people are Navajo.

975
01:01:28,036 --> 01:01:29,336
Only part Navajo.

976
01:01:29,337 --> 01:01:31,984
My great-great-great
great-grandfather was Zuni.

977
01:01:33,506 --> 01:01:36,206
You got a Cherokee look about you.

978
01:01:36,288 --> 01:01:38,588
Proud people, them Cherokee.

979
01:02:00,085 --> 01:02:02,185
- Too young.
- No, l'm not.

980
01:02:02,292 --> 01:02:03,992
Yes, you are.

981
01:02:04,116 --> 01:02:06,416
Here.
Drink some water.

982
01:02:10,065 --> 01:02:11,865
Now if you gentlemen will excuse me,

983
01:02:11,866 --> 01:02:13,992
l have to... use the powder room.

984
01:02:14,095 --> 01:02:15,195
Oh.

985
01:02:17,357 --> 01:02:18,757
- Here.
- Thank you.

986
01:02:18,797 --> 01:02:19,997
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

987
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:23,084
- Oops!

988
01:02:27,433 --> 01:02:30,333
Dude, there's things about her
she's not tellin' you.

989
01:02:30,407 --> 01:02:31,807
Well,

990
01:02:31,943 --> 01:02:35,043
every woman has a right
to a little mystery...dude.

991
01:02:36,261 --> 01:02:37,961
You know she's a Jesus freak?

992
01:02:37,988 --> 01:02:40,088
She's probably waitin' to convert you.

993
01:02:40,195 --> 01:02:43,395
She can convert me
any time she wants to.

994
01:03:10,997 --> 01:03:13,397
Well, l wish l could
drive you all the way to Los Angeles.

995
01:03:13,492 --> 01:03:15,292
So do l.

996
01:03:15,315 --> 01:03:17,115
Here, let me
get that for you.

997
01:03:18,097 --> 01:03:19,397
lt's all right.

998
01:03:19,441 --> 01:03:21,441
lt doesn't work
from the inside.

999
01:03:22,895 --> 01:03:24,395
Sticks a bit.

1000
01:03:26,158 --> 01:03:27,358
Thank you.

1001
01:03:28,653 --> 01:03:31,053
Bree, there's some things
about me you don't know--

1002
01:03:31,147 --> 01:03:32,347
Some things about my past.

1003
01:03:32,395 --> 01:03:34,495
We all have our secrets.

1004
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,445
l been in jail more than once,

1005
01:03:38,446 --> 01:03:40,240
l'm about blind in one eye,
and l got

1006
01:03:40,263 --> 01:03:42,063
a half a pound of shrapnel
in my left leg.

1007
01:03:42,182 --> 01:03:45,482
But if you're ever in New Mexico,

1008
01:03:45,483 --> 01:03:47,845
l'd really like it
if you give me a call.

1009
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:50,836
Thank you, Calvin.
l'll do that.

1010
01:03:50,837 --> 01:03:52,518
TOB Y:
Let's go.

1011
01:03:54,273 --> 01:03:55,673
Come here.

1012
01:04:01,661 --> 01:04:03,861
This used to belong
to a real good friend of mine.

1013
01:04:03,964 --> 01:04:07,064
He was a champion
in the all-lndian rodeo circuit.

1014
01:04:07,227 --> 01:04:08,827
Now you look like a warrior.

1015
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:10,458
Ma'am.

1016
01:04:22,676 --> 01:04:23,976
Where are we?

1017
01:04:24,115 --> 01:04:26,115
My parents' house.

1018
01:04:27,186 --> 01:04:29,186
l thought you said
your parents were dead.

1019
01:04:29,297 --> 01:04:31,997
Mmm.
Wishful thinking.

1020
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:33,479
Who's Sydney?

1021
01:04:33,615 --> 01:04:35,315
My baby sister.
Go.

1022
01:04:44,554 --> 01:04:46,354
May l help you?

1023
01:04:46,355 --> 01:04:48,481
ls Sydney here?

1024
01:04:49,447 --> 01:04:51,347
Sydney's out.

1025
01:04:51,366 --> 01:04:53,066
May l tell her who called?

1026
01:04:53,067 --> 01:04:54,498
l don't think so.

1027
01:05:07,295 --> 01:05:09,295
Don't look at me that way.

1028
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,506
l'm not looking at you.

1029
01:05:15,547 --> 01:05:17,147
All right, all right.

1030
01:05:17,274 --> 01:05:19,174
Shit!

1031
01:05:19,175 --> 01:05:20,898
l mean darn.

1032
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:22,221
No, l mean shit.

1033
01:05:29,845 --> 01:05:32,445
May l help you, young lady?

1034
01:05:33,395 --> 01:05:35,595
Dad, it's me.

1035
01:05:40,592 --> 01:05:43,592
- Mom!

1036
01:05:43,662 --> 01:05:45,062
Dad?

1037
01:05:48,652 --> 01:05:50,152
Mom!

1038
01:05:50,283 --> 01:05:52,183
Get in here before
the neighbors see you!

1039
01:05:55,177 --> 01:05:57,677
Jesus Christ,
l can't even recognize you.

1040
01:05:57,768 --> 01:06:00,368
lt's me, only different.

1041
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:02,859
So you've done it.

1042
01:06:02,949 --> 01:06:04,549
lt's all over.

1043
01:06:04,677 --> 01:06:06,977
l don't think that's
any of your business.

1044
01:06:07,076 --> 01:06:08,176
Mom!

1045
01:06:08,227 --> 01:06:11,527
Thank God, Murray.
He's still a boy.

1046
01:06:20,413 --> 01:06:21,613
My poor Stanley.

1047
01:06:21,661 --> 01:06:23,261
l can't look at you like this!

1048
01:06:24,635 --> 01:06:26,435
Geez, why do you always
upset her like that?

1049
01:06:28,282 --> 01:06:29,782
l tell you what.

1050
01:06:29,913 --> 01:06:32,813
l'm just gonna get something
to eat and drink,

1051
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:35,488
and then l'll go back
and wait for Sydney outside.

1052
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:43,340
Are you sure
you're all right, Stanley?

1053
01:06:43,443 --> 01:06:46,543
Fabulous.
Never been better.

1054
01:06:46,705 --> 01:06:49,905
- Stanley...
- Bree.

1055
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:53,068
Sabrina Claire Osbourne.

1056
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:55,530
Look, we're gonna need
more time with that.

1057
01:06:55,629 --> 01:06:57,829
Your mother and l
both love you--

1058
01:06:57,932 --> 01:06:59,932
But we don't respect you.

1059
01:07:00,043 --> 01:07:02,743
l'll never understand
why you're doing this to me.

1060
01:07:02,826 --> 01:07:04,526
l'm not doing anything to you.

1061
01:07:04,527 --> 01:07:07,357
l'm gender dysphoric.
lt's a genetic condition.

1062
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:10,428
Don't try to blame
your father and me for this.

1063
01:07:10,502 --> 01:07:12,702
You shouldn't use
so much mayonnaise.

1064
01:07:12,805 --> 01:07:16,105
Are you trying
to give yourself a heart attack?

1065
01:07:16,164 --> 01:07:18,664
Let me do that!

1066
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:22,210
You know what l see
when l look at you?

1067
01:07:22,211 --> 01:07:25,509
l see a lost soul
crying out for help.

1068
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:30,071
This would never have happened
if you had only come to church

1069
01:07:30,077 --> 01:07:31,477
when you were little,

1070
01:07:31,613 --> 01:07:34,813
instead of going off
to that synagogue of your father's.

1071
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:36,075
Mom, dad?

1072
01:07:36,122 --> 01:07:38,522
There's a scruffy-looking kid outside.

1073
01:07:40,728 --> 01:07:42,328
Holy shit!

1074
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,560
Language, Sydney!

1075
01:07:43,607 --> 01:07:45,807
l don't fuckin' believe it!

1076
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,910
Stanley.

1077
01:07:47,925 --> 01:07:49,825
Bree.

1078
01:07:52,723 --> 01:07:54,023
Bree.

1079
01:07:54,162 --> 01:07:56,562
Well, Bree, l was hopin'
you'd show up one of these days,

1080
01:07:56,657 --> 01:07:58,257
take some of the heat off me.

1081
01:07:59,632 --> 01:08:01,532
lt's nice to see you, too.

1082
01:08:01,551 --> 01:08:03,951
lf that kid out there's your boyfriend,
l'm gonna slit my wrists.

1083
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:05,646
l need to talk to you in private.

1084
01:08:05,677 --> 01:08:07,377
Oh, my God.
He is!

1085
01:08:07,404 --> 01:08:09,204
You lucky son of a--

1086
01:08:09,227 --> 01:08:10,527
l mean, you lucky bitch.

1087
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:12,567
Your boyfriend?!

1088
01:08:12,682 --> 01:08:15,182
That filthy teenage
juvenile delinquent

1089
01:08:15,272 --> 01:08:16,672
who came to the door?

1090
01:08:16,712 --> 01:08:20,012
He happens to be a clean,
healthy and respectable young man.

1091
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:21,670
l don't want to hear
any more about it.

1092
01:08:21,671 --> 01:08:22,705
How old is he?

1093
01:08:24,004 --> 01:08:26,004
Seventeen.

1094
01:08:26,115 --> 01:08:29,415
Oh, my God!
Murray, he's underage.

1095
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:32,770
Mom, he's my son.

1096
01:08:34,464 --> 01:08:35,964
You're shittin' me!

1097
01:08:35,999 --> 01:08:40,099
- Remember Emma Wilkins?
- What are you saying?

1098
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:41,925
ls Emma here, too?

1099
01:08:42,044 --> 01:08:43,544
She killed herself.

1100
01:08:43,579 --> 01:08:44,579
Jesus!

1101
01:08:44,635 --> 01:08:46,735
KineIhora.

1102
01:08:46,746 --> 01:08:48,846
Are you trying to tell me

1103
01:08:48,953 --> 01:08:52,153
that that boy
who came to the door...

1104
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:55,115
he's your grandson.

1105
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:57,190
My grandson.

1106
01:09:00,084 --> 01:09:01,884
My grandson.

1107
01:09:03,058 --> 01:09:05,758
Oh, dear God.

1108
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:08,341
He doesn't know anything,
and l don't want him to.

1109
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:10,883
Wait!

1110
01:09:13,326 --> 01:09:15,826
- Call me grandpa.
- Shit!

1111
01:09:19,371 --> 01:09:21,871
Oh, you poor thing.

1112
01:09:21,962 --> 01:09:24,962
Get up off that filthy ground.
Get up!

1113
01:09:25,032 --> 01:09:27,932
There could be
all sorts of awful things down there.

1114
01:09:28,007 --> 01:09:29,507
Look at you.

1115
01:09:29,542 --> 01:09:32,542
What a handsome boy.

1116
01:09:33,764 --> 01:09:36,564
Do you know who l am?

1117
01:09:36,565 --> 01:09:38,747
- l'm your--
- A friend. Bree's mother.

1118
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:40,750
He doesn't know
about me, do you understand?

1119
01:09:40,865 --> 01:09:42,665
l don't want him
to know about me. Agreed?

1120
01:09:42,688 --> 01:09:44,788
- You're not gonna say anything?
- No.

1121
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:46,299
Hi there.

1122
01:09:46,334 --> 01:09:47,534
l'm Sydney.

1123
01:09:47,582 --> 01:09:50,382
Hey. Toby.

1124
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:53,860
- What do you say?
- Toby.

1125
01:09:54,011 --> 01:09:57,011
Come on inside
where there's nice air conditioning.

1126
01:09:57,081 --> 01:09:58,281
Come on, honey,

1127
01:09:58,329 --> 01:10:01,829
and l'll make you
a nice plate of food.

1128
01:10:05,142 --> 01:10:07,642
Mm, defrosted to perfection.

1129
01:10:07,733 --> 01:10:10,133
Finish your vegetables.

1130
01:10:10,227 --> 01:10:11,627
He doesn't like broccoli.

1131
01:10:13,106 --> 01:10:14,806
Open up.

1132
01:10:16,464 --> 01:10:19,464
Lucky, no!

1133
01:10:19,535 --> 01:10:21,535
l swear, that dog is a sex maniac!

1134
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:24,589
Just like your father.

1135
01:10:24,621 --> 01:10:26,721
At least he gets
more action than l do.

1136
01:10:26,828 --> 01:10:29,128
My mom used to live
in Phoenix before l was born.

1137
01:10:29,994 --> 01:10:33,294
Really?
What a coincidence.

1138
01:10:33,449 --> 01:10:35,949
What did your name used to be
when you were a guy?

1139
01:10:37,479 --> 01:10:40,179
Honey, why don't you go
and watch TV

1140
01:10:40,262 --> 01:10:42,062
in the spare bedroom, hmm?

1141
01:10:42,085 --> 01:10:44,085
You can take the dog.

1142
01:10:46,595 --> 01:10:47,695
Come here.
Come here, boy.

1143
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,913
Stanley, what are you
planning to do

1144
01:10:52,928 --> 01:10:54,628
with that poor boy?

1145
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:58,090
First of all, l'm gonna make sure

1146
01:10:58,109 --> 01:11:00,309
he knows that he's encouraged
and supported.

1147
01:11:01,948 --> 01:11:04,348
And that he's respected.

1148
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,294
Maybe even...

1149
01:11:07,417 --> 01:11:10,417
well, at least that he's respected.

1150
01:11:15,381 --> 01:11:18,381
Behold the return
of the Prodigal son.

1151
01:11:18,452 --> 01:11:22,052
Can we try to be nice
to each other, please?

1152
01:11:22,053 --> 01:11:24,102
This is so bizarre.

1153
01:11:24,209 --> 01:11:26,709
l can still see Stanley in you,

1154
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,100
but it's like you put yourself
through a strainer

1155
01:11:29,103 --> 01:11:31,003
and got rid of all the boy pulp.

1156
01:11:33,997 --> 01:11:38,097
Planning a game
of bridge with the girls?

1157
01:11:38,123 --> 01:11:39,423
Hmm.

1158
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,840
Can l borrow $1 ,000?

1159
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:48,751
You've gotta be kidding.

1160
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:50,838
500?

1161
01:11:51,845 --> 01:11:53,045
250?

1162
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:54,588
Do l hear a dollar and a half?

1163
01:11:54,627 --> 01:11:57,427
l have to account for every penny.

1164
01:11:57,602 --> 01:11:59,302
Eighteen months sober,

1165
01:11:59,303 --> 01:12:01,633
and they're still
scared shitless l'm gonna relapse

1166
01:12:01,728 --> 01:12:05,628
and wind up passed out on the floor
in some dive down on Van Buren.

1167
01:12:05,758 --> 01:12:07,958
God, those were the days.

1168
01:12:09,213 --> 01:12:11,713
My surgery's day after tomorrow.

1169
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:15,067
l need air fare to get home.

1170
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,140
You know, growin' up,

1171
01:12:19,288 --> 01:12:21,788
l always thought
you were the lucky one.

1172
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,679
Hmm.

1173
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,398
Try this one.

1174
01:12:26,389 --> 01:12:27,589
Oh, my God.

1175
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:31,140
lt'll be like showgirls, um...
on lce Capades.

1176
01:12:31,282 --> 01:12:33,582
l'm a transsexual,
not a transvestite.

1177
01:12:33,585 --> 01:12:35,185
Yeah, but it will really
freak Mom out.

1178
01:12:35,312 --> 01:12:38,512
Now you've lost all credibility.

1179
01:13:05,539 --> 01:13:10,139
Toby, don't break that, honey.
lt's very expensive.

1180
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:14,440
Murray, l just hate the way
you had Lucky's tail clipped.

1181
01:13:14,462 --> 01:13:17,562
Stands straight up just like a penis.

1182
01:13:17,725 --> 01:13:20,125
- Black and hairy.
- Well, it does.

1183
01:13:20,126 --> 01:13:22,324
Not like any penis l've ever seen.

1184
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:24,231
Me neither.

1185
01:13:24,346 --> 01:13:25,546
Toby!

1186
01:13:25,593 --> 01:13:27,993
Toby, come over here
and let me fix your hair.

1187
01:13:28,088 --> 01:13:29,188
Come on.

1188
01:13:29,336 --> 01:13:31,236
Come on, honey.

1189
01:13:33,462 --> 01:13:34,762
Stay.

1190
01:13:34,763 --> 01:13:36,809
Sit.

1191
01:13:36,916 --> 01:13:40,616
Oh, you have such
nice, thick hair.

1192
01:13:40,658 --> 01:13:42,958
Just like mine.

1193
01:13:43,057 --> 01:13:46,357
And those clothes
are a great improvement.

1194
01:13:46,416 --> 01:13:47,716
They fit good, huh?

1195
01:13:47,759 --> 01:13:50,959
- They fit well.
- Grammar police.

1196
01:13:51,022 --> 01:13:53,722
Good evening.

1197
01:14:00,137 --> 01:14:03,237
That dress looks
perfectly ridiculous.

1198
01:14:14,723 --> 01:14:16,323
You're looking
very handsome.

1199
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:18,950
You look good, too.

1200
01:14:19,041 --> 01:14:19,941
Beauty is relative.

1201
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,700
For God's sake, Mom!

1202
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:25,023
Oh, don't pick on me, not tonight.
l can't take it.

1203
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:35,570
l used to read pornography
on the toilet,

1204
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:39,345
and ever since,
l have shitty sex.

1205
01:14:41,782 --> 01:14:42,882
You get it?

1206
01:14:42,934 --> 01:14:43,934
Yeah.

1207
01:14:58,766 --> 01:15:00,066
Thank you.

1208
01:15:01,453 --> 01:15:04,553
Toby, come and sit here next to me.

1209
01:15:04,554 --> 01:15:06,424
Here, take a picture.

1210
01:15:07,978 --> 01:15:10,878
Murray, scoot over.
Come on, honey. Right here.

1211
01:15:10,953 --> 01:15:12,453
That's right, Toby honey.

1212
01:15:12,584 --> 01:15:15,484
Lean in close, honey.
All right, everybody.

1213
01:15:15,559 --> 01:15:17,359
One, two, three.

1214
01:15:20,548 --> 01:15:22,848
We all look much happier
than we really are.

1215
01:15:22,947 --> 01:15:25,247
Can you take one
of the two of us?

1216
01:15:26,977 --> 01:15:27,977
l'll take it.

1217
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:45,450
Nice to see a young man
being so polite to his mother.

1218
01:15:47,224 --> 01:15:49,424
That's not his mother.

1219
01:15:54,709 --> 01:15:56,109
And, uh, a hamburger

1220
01:15:56,244 --> 01:15:57,344
for the young gentleman.

1221
01:15:57,395 --> 01:15:58,495
Enjoy your meal.

1222
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,960
Toby, do you want to say grace?

1223
01:16:08,046 --> 01:16:10,246
Go ahead, honey.
Don't be shy.

1224
01:16:18,026 --> 01:16:24,426
Uh, God,
bless this restaurant and, uh...

1225
01:16:24,551 --> 01:16:27,251
these thy gifts that we're
about to receive forever

1226
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,133
and ever.

1227
01:16:29,253 --> 01:16:32,153
And thank you, Lord,
for bringing Toby to us.

1228
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:37,531
And please let us all stay together
in health and spirits.

1229
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:39,301
ln Jesus Christ's name.
Amen.

1230
01:16:39,424 --> 01:16:40,324
Amen.

1231
01:16:40,383 --> 01:16:42,583
SIhalom Israel.

1232
01:16:46,045 --> 01:16:47,245
Jesus!

1233
01:16:49,307 --> 01:16:51,007
Oh, Toby, honey,

1234
01:16:51,131 --> 01:16:52,531
don't take the lettuce
out of your hamburger.

1235
01:16:52,666 --> 01:16:54,066
lt's good for you.

1236
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:58,420
Sydney, don't play with your food.

1237
01:16:58,519 --> 01:17:00,619
Sieg Iheil.

1238
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:10,623
Can l borrow $1 ,000?

1239
01:17:10,624 --> 01:17:13,810
Toby, your hamburger's almost raw.

1240
01:17:13,968 --> 01:17:15,368
Let me send that back.

1241
01:17:15,407 --> 01:17:17,507
l can pay it back with interest.

1242
01:17:17,614 --> 01:17:19,514
What do you need the money for?

1243
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:21,533
To get back to Los Angeles.

1244
01:17:21,548 --> 01:17:23,048
Look at your life.

1245
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,480
You've never been able
to stick to a decision.

1246
01:17:25,579 --> 01:17:28,679
Ten years of college,
and not a single degree.

1247
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:31,445
How do you know you won't change
your mind about this, too?

1248
01:17:34,982 --> 01:17:36,682
Because l know.

1249
01:17:40,164 --> 01:17:42,864
Don't do this awful thing
to yourself. Please.

1250
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:47,590
l miss my son.

1251
01:17:48,704 --> 01:17:50,204
Mom...

1252
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:52,339
you never had a son.

1253
01:17:55,613 --> 01:17:58,513
How can you say such a thing?

1254
01:17:58,514 --> 01:18:01,091
Now you know how l felt
when you hired those private detectives.

1255
01:18:01,178 --> 01:18:04,078
We only tried to do the best for you.

1256
01:18:04,153 --> 01:18:05,753
ls that why you tried
to have me committed?

1257
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,480
You tried to kill yourself!

1258
01:18:07,511 --> 01:18:09,011
Because you tried
to have me committed!

1259
01:18:09,047 --> 01:18:10,647
l don't know why
you have to be so emotional.

1260
01:18:10,774 --> 01:18:11,974
l am not emotional!

1261
01:18:14,324 --> 01:18:16,124
God, my cycle's all out of whack.

1262
01:18:16,147 --> 01:18:17,747
You don't have cycles.

1263
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:21,390
Hormones are hormones.

1264
01:18:21,521 --> 01:18:24,821
Yours and mine just happen
to come in little purple pills.

1265
01:18:26,415 --> 01:18:28,715
Young man, may we get
some doggie bags here, please?

1266
01:18:28,718 --> 01:18:29,718
Yes, ma'am.

1267
01:18:29,773 --> 01:18:33,073
l'm going to finish
cooking his hamburger at home.

1268
01:18:34,859 --> 01:18:37,059
Murray, give me your wallet.

1269
01:18:42,919 --> 01:18:43,919
Here's $200.

1270
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,879
We'll get the rest out of the safe.

1271
01:18:46,949 --> 01:18:48,449
There's one condition.

1272
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:51,080
l want Toby to stay here with me.

1273
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:54,727
Wouldn't you like that, honey?

1274
01:18:55,969 --> 01:18:57,869
You could have
your own little apartment.

1275
01:18:57,888 --> 01:19:00,488
We'll remodel the guest house.

1276
01:19:00,575 --> 01:19:02,475
Do you like to play tennis?

1277
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:05,790
We have eight new courts
at the country club.

1278
01:19:05,948 --> 01:19:10,448
Murray and l just feel that
you need a stable, loving family

1279
01:19:10,554 --> 01:19:15,254
with the means to give you
every chance that you deserve.

1280
01:19:25,715 --> 01:19:28,615
Toby, here you are, baby.

1281
01:19:32,528 --> 01:19:33,928
Ha ha ha!

1282
01:19:46,154 --> 01:19:48,554
Half ltalian villa,
half country club.

1283
01:19:51,815 --> 01:19:53,815
Beauty is relative.

1284
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:55,530
Not my relatives.

1285
01:19:56,901 --> 01:20:01,201
l wish just once they'd
look at me and see me.

1286
01:20:01,219 --> 01:20:03,319
That's all.

1287
01:20:03,426 --> 01:20:05,626
Just really see me.

1288
01:20:05,729 --> 01:20:08,729
Why are they bein' so nice to me?

1289
01:20:11,582 --> 01:20:12,582
Mmm.

1290
01:20:13,789 --> 01:20:15,389
You think l oughta stay here?

1291
01:20:16,764 --> 01:20:18,064
Do you want to?

1292
01:20:20,506 --> 01:20:22,006
lt's pretty nice.

1293
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:27,352
l think you oughta do whatever
you think is best for you.

1294
01:20:29,814 --> 01:20:37,114
But if you want,
you can come and live with me.

1295
01:20:38,354 --> 01:20:40,654
l can't give you anything like this,

1296
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:43,153
but l'm sure
we could manage something.

1297
01:20:43,154 --> 01:20:46,952
Did you really try to kill yourself?

1298
01:20:47,086 --> 01:20:50,186
l swallowed half a bottle of Nembutal.

1299
01:20:53,227 --> 01:20:56,227
Then l panicked and called 91 1 .

1300
01:20:58,792 --> 01:21:01,092
Maybe you're not the suicidal type.

1301
01:21:01,095 --> 01:21:02,395
Maybe.

1302
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:07,690
Unless my mother is right,
and l just can't stick to a decision.

1303
01:21:15,201 --> 01:21:18,501
- Come in.

1304
01:21:23,261 --> 01:21:24,461
Can't you sleep?

1305
01:21:24,604 --> 01:21:27,004
- Not really.
- Do you need something?

1306
01:21:27,099 --> 01:21:29,599
A glass of milk?

1307
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:31,290
No.

1308
01:21:32,377 --> 01:21:33,877
What is it?

1309
01:21:35,064 --> 01:21:37,064
l must look awful.

1310
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:39,079
You look good.

1311
01:21:43,987 --> 01:21:46,087
You look well.

1312
01:21:51,664 --> 01:21:54,064
Don't worry.

1313
01:21:57,805 --> 01:22:00,105
What are you doin'?

1314
01:22:00,204 --> 01:22:01,704
What l'm good at.

1315
01:22:03,946 --> 01:22:05,046
No, no.

1316
01:22:05,047 --> 01:22:08,002
lt's okay.
l want to.

1317
01:22:08,072 --> 01:22:10,272
You'll like it, l promise.

1318
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:12,375
l don't wanna like it.
l don't want it at all.

1319
01:22:14,022 --> 01:22:15,722
Okay.

1320
01:22:21,698 --> 01:22:23,498
l'll marry you if you want.

1321
01:22:23,617 --> 01:22:28,217
l don't care how big your place is.
l just wanna be with you.

1322
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:32,250
l think you're sexy, Bree.

1323
01:22:33,021 --> 01:22:34,621
lt's like...

1324
01:22:36,763 --> 01:22:38,763
like l see you.

1325
01:22:40,218 --> 01:22:42,218
Oh, God.

1326
01:22:48,278 --> 01:22:49,878
Oh, no.
Put your clothes on.

1327
01:22:49,909 --> 01:22:51,709
l mean it.
Right now. Stop it.

1328
01:22:51,828 --> 01:22:52,928
What's the matter?

1329
01:22:53,076 --> 01:22:55,476
Just...would you please
just cover yourself up?!

1330
01:23:03,055 --> 01:23:06,555
- l am such a total shit.
- No, you're not.

1331
01:23:08,333 --> 01:23:11,233
There's something l should've
told you a long time ago.

1332
01:23:11,307 --> 01:23:12,707
You're going to hate me.

1333
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:15,490
l'm not really...

1334
01:23:17,065 --> 01:23:18,365
exactly...

1335
01:23:20,903 --> 01:23:23,003
affiliated with a church.

1336
01:23:24,837 --> 01:23:27,137
l already figured that out.

1337
01:23:32,034 --> 01:23:33,434
What?

1338
01:23:34,624 --> 01:23:36,024
My mom and dad.

1339
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:39,360
lt's your mom...

1340
01:23:39,422 --> 01:23:41,122
and me.

1341
01:23:45,851 --> 01:23:47,051
Toby...

1342
01:23:50,553 --> 01:23:52,653
l'm so sorry.

1343
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,260
l know l shouldn't have lied to you.

1344
01:23:55,351 --> 01:23:57,651
l know how disappointed you must be.

1345
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:00,450
A one-bedroom apartment
instead of a mansion,

1346
01:24:00,451 --> 01:24:04,537
and half-Jewish
instead of half-lndian.

1347
01:24:04,659 --> 01:24:05,959
Toby.

1348
01:24:07,057 --> 01:24:08,657
Toby.

1349
01:24:08,785 --> 01:24:10,885
Why don't we look on the bright side?

1350
01:24:10,896 --> 01:24:12,596
We've gotten to know each other--

1351
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:14,619
Our strengths and weaknesses--

1352
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:16,842
And we're still
good friends, aren't we?

1353
01:24:16,941 --> 01:24:18,641
l'm so sorry!

1354
01:24:18,764 --> 01:24:20,964
l truly, really,
l didn't mean to hurt you!

1355
01:24:21,067 --> 01:24:23,867
My mother's probably right.
l'm a terrible influence.

1356
01:24:23,868 --> 01:24:26,450
Oh, please, this is
a terrible time for me.

1357
01:24:26,632 --> 01:24:27,732
Toby, wait.

1358
01:24:27,733 --> 01:24:29,288
Oh!

1359
01:24:29,415 --> 01:24:30,915
You are not my father.

1360
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:33,110
Oh, my God!

1361
01:24:33,157 --> 01:24:34,357
Oh, honey.

1362
01:24:34,501 --> 01:24:35,501
There, there.

1363
01:24:35,502 --> 01:24:36,860
He didn't mean it, honey.

1364
01:24:36,996 --> 01:24:39,396
He's just a little bit upset.

1365
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:40,491
There now.

1366
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:41,842
There, there.

1367
01:24:41,889 --> 01:24:43,389
There, there.

1368
01:24:58,778 --> 01:25:00,278
Toby's gone!

1369
01:25:00,409 --> 01:25:02,409
He took my purse...

1370
01:25:02,424 --> 01:25:04,624
and my bucking bronco statue.

1371
01:25:14,131 --> 01:25:16,131
What do you want to do, Sta--

1372
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:18,401
Bree.

1373
01:25:18,545 --> 01:25:20,445
Yes.

1374
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,360
He's 17, but you don't know

1375
01:25:22,361 --> 01:25:23,487
his date of birth?

1376
01:25:23,630 --> 01:25:25,530
What's your
relationship to the missing boy?

1377
01:25:27,756 --> 01:25:30,156
l am his father.

1378
01:25:30,251 --> 01:25:32,251
Can't you put out an A.P.B.
or something?

1379
01:25:32,362 --> 01:25:33,962
We'll do our best.

1380
01:25:33,993 --> 01:25:36,293
l'm sorry to say this,
but chances are,

1381
01:25:36,296 --> 01:25:38,096
if he doesn't wanna be found,

1382
01:25:38,215 --> 01:25:40,515
he's gonna stay lost.

1383
01:26:04,603 --> 01:26:07,103
lt's okay

1384
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:11,098
You don't have to be afraid

1385
01:26:12,664 --> 01:26:14,864
There's nothin' to worry about

1386
01:26:14,966 --> 01:26:18,266
'Cause we got it made

1387
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:24,320
lt's just a simple matter of

1388
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:27,970
Letting me into your love

1389
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:31,816
lf you let that feeling
come over you

1390
01:26:31,951 --> 01:26:35,751
Then there's nothin' more
that you can do

1391
01:26:35,789 --> 01:26:39,989
Just let it go

1392
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:42,015
Let it go

1393
01:26:45,672 --> 01:26:46,572
Hey.

1394
01:26:46,632 --> 01:26:48,032
This is Bree.

1395
01:26:52,581 --> 01:26:56,581
lf it's love you want

1396
01:26:56,707 --> 01:26:58,307
Hold out your arms

1397
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:00,338
Thank you very much.

1398
01:27:02,465 --> 01:27:03,965
lt's all right here

1399
01:27:04,096 --> 01:27:08,096
lt's safe and warm

1400
01:27:10,813 --> 01:27:13,713
lt's okay to feel good

1401
01:27:13,787 --> 01:27:15,087
Everything is fine.

1402
01:27:15,227 --> 01:27:17,127
Your surgery was
a complete success.

1403
01:27:17,146 --> 01:27:21,646
Everything we have
is fresh and new

1404
01:27:21,752 --> 01:27:25,752
l will open myself up to you

1405
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:29,582
Like a rose

1406
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:32,620
Like a rose

1407
01:27:48,331 --> 01:27:50,131
Hello, my lady.

1408
01:27:52,649 --> 01:27:54,649
How are you feeling?

1409
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,100
And don't say like a new woman.

1410
01:27:58,119 --> 01:28:00,319
l...

1411
01:28:00,422 --> 01:28:04,222
feel like a medieval heretic

1412
01:28:04,223 --> 01:28:10,964
impaled on a very large
and very thick...

1413
01:28:11,073 --> 01:28:13,273
stake...

1414
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,880
with splinters.

1415
01:28:17,982 --> 01:28:19,682
Nice hat.

1416
01:28:22,108 --> 01:28:24,008
lt was a present.

1417
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:29,485
Bree, why do l get the feeling

1418
01:28:29,496 --> 01:28:31,696
that there's something
not quite right?

1419
01:28:31,799 --> 01:28:32,899
Last week, you said

1420
01:28:33,047 --> 01:28:35,047
this was gonna be
the happiest day of your life.

1421
01:28:35,158 --> 01:28:37,758
Last week was a long time ago.

1422
01:28:44,753 --> 01:28:46,153
Talk to me.

1423
01:28:51,278 --> 01:28:52,678
l fucked up.

1424
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:09,650
lt hurts.

1425
01:29:09,702 --> 01:29:11,802
Oh!
Oh, my sweetie.

1426
01:29:13,828 --> 01:29:16,028
That's what hearts do.

1427
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:27,227
lt's okay.

1428
01:29:27,358 --> 01:29:28,558
Okay.

1429
01:29:28,559 --> 01:29:29,909
Okay.

1430
01:29:34,459 --> 01:29:36,459
l'm sorry.

1431
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:38,170
No, let it out.

1432
01:29:38,297 --> 01:29:40,397
This is good, Bree.

1433
01:29:40,504 --> 01:29:41,804
This is good.

1434
01:30:51,991 --> 01:30:54,691
Amo la comida mexicana.

1435
01:30:54,773 --> 01:30:56,973
Amo la comida mexicana.

1436
01:30:57,076 --> 01:30:59,376
Y amo Fernando.

1437
01:30:59,475 --> 01:31:02,775
Amo la comida mexicano.

1438
01:31:02,930 --> 01:31:04,730
Mexicana.

1439
01:31:08,879 --> 01:31:11,579
School's gonna be closing
in about 1 5 minutes.

1440
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:13,158
Wayne, this is really hard.

1441
01:31:13,159 --> 01:31:15,001
Do you think
you could give me a hand?

1442
01:31:15,116 --> 01:31:16,716
Sure.
What subject?

1443
01:31:16,843 --> 01:31:18,843
Sex education.

1444
01:31:21,545 --> 01:31:23,545
All right, cut.

1445
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,560
He needs help again.

1446
01:31:25,575 --> 01:31:26,675
Let's go, let's go.

1447
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:29,858
Did you take your Viagra?

1448
01:31:29,893 --> 01:31:31,693
Yes, ma'am.

1449
01:31:31,716 --> 01:31:33,216
When's the last time you came?

1450
01:31:33,348 --> 01:31:34,448
Like two hours ago.

1451
01:31:35,363 --> 01:31:36,463
Christ, kid.

1452
01:31:36,464 --> 01:31:38,818
You've got to focus, okay?
Can you focus?

1453
01:31:38,913 --> 01:31:41,713
We're behind schedule.
We've gotta move.

1454
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:46,870
Ow.

1455
01:32:01,751 --> 01:32:03,351
Toby.

1456
01:32:03,478 --> 01:32:05,478
Don't think that l'm
fucking forgiving you,

1457
01:32:05,589 --> 01:32:06,989
because l'm not.

1458
01:32:09,331 --> 01:32:10,731
All right.

1459
01:32:13,457 --> 01:32:17,857
- l just came over to see if you did it.
- Did what?

1460
01:32:17,967 --> 01:32:20,567
Got your dick turned inside out.

1461
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:22,058
Yes.

1462
01:32:22,189 --> 01:32:23,889
Won't you come in?

1463
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:26,020
Just for a little while?

1464
01:32:26,123 --> 01:32:30,223
- l have something for you.
- What?

1465
01:32:30,345 --> 01:32:32,445
Please.

1466
01:32:44,067 --> 01:32:46,367
Your parents' house is a lot nicer.

1467
01:32:46,466 --> 01:32:49,466
My parents' house
comes with my parents.

1468
01:32:51,839 --> 01:32:53,839
l thought you said we were Jewish.

1469
01:32:53,951 --> 01:32:55,351
Half-Jewish...

1470
01:32:55,486 --> 01:32:57,286
through my father,
so it's technically the wrong half,

1471
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,805
and you're only a quarter.

1472
01:32:59,806 --> 01:33:01,104
The wrong quarter.

1473
01:33:01,147 --> 01:33:05,347
l'm gonna finish up my degree.

1474
01:33:05,465 --> 01:33:07,765
l thought l'd take up teaching.

1475
01:33:07,864 --> 01:33:09,864
Maybe rent a house someplace.

1476
01:33:09,975 --> 01:33:12,175
Someplace with a yard.

1477
01:33:12,278 --> 01:33:14,478
What have you got for me?

1478
01:33:16,212 --> 01:33:17,512
Hang on a minute.

1479
01:33:18,803 --> 01:33:20,103

1480
01:33:21,874 --> 01:33:23,374

1481
01:33:26,575 --> 01:33:28,475
So how have you been?

1482
01:33:28,495 --> 01:33:30,395
l've been all right.

1483
01:33:33,676 --> 01:33:37,176
Would you care to divulge
a few more details?

1484
01:33:37,323 --> 01:33:39,723
- l'm making a movie.
- You are?

1485
01:33:41,161 --> 01:33:42,461
Told you l could.

1486
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,700

the advertisement for it.

1487
01:33:44,807 --> 01:33:47,607
- Here.
- Oh.

1488
01:33:52,196 --> 01:33:53,896
''Cowabunghole.''

1489
01:33:54,019 --> 01:33:56,119
That's Dylan Reeves.

1490
01:33:56,226 --> 01:33:57,826
He's a big star.

1491
01:33:57,953 --> 01:34:00,253
Huh.

1492
01:34:00,256 --> 01:34:01,356
And there's you.

1493
01:34:01,357 --> 01:34:04,611

1495
01:34:06,589 --> 01:34:09,589
lf you want, l could get you
a discount when it comes out.

1496
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:12,960
Thank you.
That's very considerate.

1497
01:34:16,472 --> 01:34:18,372

at the Beverly Center.

1498
01:34:18,488 --> 01:34:20,588
Beverly Hills.

1499
01:34:30,962 --> 01:34:32,562
Would you like a coke?

1500
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,700
l'll take a beer.

1501
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:40,230
All right.

1502
01:34:49,193 --> 01:34:52,293
Young man, if you think
you can put your dirty tennis shoes

1503
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:53,960
on my brand-new coffee table,

1504
01:34:54,087 --> 01:34:56,187
you're gonna have to think again.

1505
01:35:18,556 --> 01:35:28,556
THE END
