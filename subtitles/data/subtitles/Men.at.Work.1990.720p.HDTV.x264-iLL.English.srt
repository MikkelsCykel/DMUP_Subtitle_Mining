00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,300
I can't support
this activity any longer, Max.

2
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,600
Relax, Jack. Only two more days and we
move our whole disposal operation north -

3
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,500
out of your jurisdiction.

4
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,700
You promised me those barrels'd
be leakproof for 150 years.

5
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,000
A slight miscalculation.
Look, it's this simple.

6
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,300
I have an obligation
to produce paint thinner.

7
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,500
You have an obligation to provide
a place to dispose of the waste products.

8
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,100
I'm not afraid of you any more, Potterdam.

9
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,700
If I have to expose the whole operation,
I will. I'll bring us all down.

10
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,300
I think you're smarter than that, Jack.

11
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,800
You can't pay me enough, Max.

12
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:44,700
Kiss your chances of getting elected
mayor goodbye, Mr. City Councilman.

13
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,400
It's bigger than an election, Max.

14
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,900
Boss?

15
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,400
There's a time and a place
for everything, gentlemen.

16
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,600
<i>You have an obligation to provide
a place to dispose of the waste products.</i>

17
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,900
I got you.

18
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,500
<i> Good morning. You're listening to
the Poor man on the world-famous KROQ.</i>

19
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,200
<i>And you still have time
to call in on open-line,</i>

20
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,700
<i>where at 5am, let's face it,
we can talk about absolutely anything.</i>

21
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,300
<i>It's live, it's uncensored,
and I'm not even using the tape delay</i>

22
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,400
<i>because this is primetime radio,</i>

23
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,800
<i>the 2 to 6am show
where management sleeps.</i>

24
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,700
I gotta go to work.

25
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Could you leave your board?
I may go out later.

26
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
My surfboard?

27
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,600
Yeah. You promised me last night.

28
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,700
Yeah, you can use it.

29
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,800
<i>No tape delay. Here we are on open-line.
Good morning. You're on the air.</i>

30
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200
<i>- Hi, Poorman.
- Where are you calling from?</i>

31
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,600
<i>- South Bay.
- What can I do for you?</i>

32
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:43,400
<i>Well, my boyfriend just left me and
I'm really bummed cos I loved him a lot.</i>

33
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,700
<i>Why did your boyfriend leave you?</i>

34
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,000
<i>He found me and his best friend
in bed together.</i>

35
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,400
<i>What do you expect if he found you
in bed with his best friend?</i>

36
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,600
<i>I don't know. Maybe a bit more
understanding, you know.</i>

37
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,200
<i>Well, you got a problem
that you're gonna have to work out.</i>

38
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,300
<i>But not on my show.</i>

39
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,400
I hate politicians.

40
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,800
Yeah.

41
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,900
<i>Coming to work today, Mr. Taylor?</i>

42
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah, Walt,
I'm flyin' out the door right now.

43
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,600
Let's see if my favorite
little stewardess is up yet.

44
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,000
Lookin' good.

45
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,100
Oops!

46
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Busted.

47
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,900
Fly those friendly skies.

48
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,100
Now that is the perfect relationship.

49
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,700
Wait a minute. Hello.

50
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,500
What are you looking at, pal?

51
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
Good morning.

52
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,500
Time for that morning cup of hot java.
Coffee for one. Three scoops, please.

53
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,200
Nice selection of wines.

54
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,800
Good California Chardonnay,
a bottle of Dom.

55
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
No market brands in this house.

56
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,900
Only the best.

57
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,700
Now for some sliced papaya,
if it's in season.

58
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,800
Shit! Mango. I should have known.

59
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,400
I wish I knew your name.

60
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,600
Carl. I thought you were
gonna be a no-show.

61
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,100
Almost. Thanks.

62
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,700
Frost and Luzinski?

63
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,400
Yeah.

64
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:40,100
Hey, I don't know about you, shitheads,
but we're on a time clock. Let's move!

65
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,000
Gina walked out on me last night.

66
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,100
- Really?
- Yeah. Moved all her stuff out.

67
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,600
You've been trying to bale out
of that relationship for a long time.

68
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,100
I just didn't expect it
to be so sudden.

69
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Paybacks are a bitch, James!

70
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,300
<i>- You seen my gloves, amigo?
- In the glove compartimente.</i>

71
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,200
- Hey, mister!
- Shut up, you dickhead.

72
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,700
Yes, I'm still here.
Now, about those mailers.

73
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,800
First off, you did the colors wrong,
but I let it pass because I'm a nice person.

74
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,400
Now you're telling me, with the
election one week around the corner,

75
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,400
that the mailers are gonna go out late?

76
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,200
If you don't get those mailers out
by tomorrow, I'm pulling the account.

77
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,000
Bye-bye.

78
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,200
Jerk.

79
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
I gotta hide this.

80
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,800
- A ton of things need your signature.
- Can it wait?

81
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,300
No, and I have a cassette of a band
we could use for the fundraiser.

82
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,400
Since we're short on time,
you could listen and decide.

83
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,500
I don't have time for that. If you like 'em,
use 'em. I trust your judgment.

84
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,300
That's why I hired you as a campaign
manager. You gotta trust your staff.

85
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,700
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

86
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,000
Listen...

87
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,100
- You're doing a hell of a job.
- Thank you, Jack.

88
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,000
- I didn't sleep for shit last night.
- Why not?

89
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,500
Gina.

90
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,200
Gina, Gina. Gina!

91
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,900
Let her go, man. Let her go.

92
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,800
I have, I have. She is historical.

93
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,100
She couldn't be with
a garbageman the rest of her life.

94
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,200
You're not gonna be a garbageman.
Didn't you tell her about our surf shop?

95
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,300
I told her. I think she was getting
pressure from her family.

96
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,600
- Her father never liked you.
- What does he know?

97
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,000
- Well, life's a bitch, right?
- Ain't that the truth!

98
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,700
I tell you, Carl, this is
the last year we throw trash.

99
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,300
- You said that last year.
- This year I mean it.

100
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,300
You meant it last year.

101
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,600
- Hey, Carl, is this yours?
- No, it ain't my color.

102
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's a bra, James.

103
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Look at this smut.

104
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,700
Well, if it isn't the South Bay's finest.

105
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,900
What happened, Mike?
Did they take away your vroom-vrooms?

106
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,200
You see, this is the kind of scum you're
gonna have to get used to around here.

107
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,500
Jeff's new to the force,
so I'm giving him the tour.

108
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,400
He's also my new partner, so you're
gonna be seeing a whole lot more of him.

109
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,700
Wonderful.

110
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,800
You're gonna like it here, Jeff.

111
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,100
The air's clean, the women are beautiful
and the shifts are short.

112
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,500
Most of the folks here in Las Playas
are hard-working, with a future in mind,

113
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,700
with the exception of these two clowns.

114
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,100
They're part of the
"Don't let this happen to you" crowd.

115
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,100
A word of warning,
my garbage-toting friends,

116
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,000
from your friendly
neighborhood peace officer.

117
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,000
I've got my eye on you both.
If you're not breaking the law now,

118
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,200
the smart money says that
it's only a matter of time before you will.

119
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,300
And you can bet that last dollar that my
ass is gonna be there to make the bust.

120
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,100
- Golf clap?
- Golf clap.

121
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,300
"Dear John. I'm sorry
things didn't work out for us."

122
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,700
"You're a sweet man,
and I'll always love you."

123
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,200
Ah!

124
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,600
You know, this is the kind of shit
that really breaks me up.

125
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,700
- It's an epidemic.
- What is?

126
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,000
Just women, relationships, all of it.

127
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,500
I never have a problem with it.

128
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
- Hi, James.
- Morning, baby.

129
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,000
- That's cos you've got no heart.
- What?

130
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,800
You've got no heart. Who was
the last girl you were serious about?

131
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,900
Betsy Sabetta.

132
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,100
Betsy Sabetta? That was
in the ninth grade and she had a harelip.

133
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,200
- She did not.
- She did too.

134
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,000
- She did not!
- Did too, did too.

135
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,300
- What do you know about her, anyway?
- I know she had a harelip.

136
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,700
What an absolutely gorgeous day.

137
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,200
Warm sun, beautiful women.

138
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,200
And the air is just right for drinking.

139
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,500
Would you just look at all the activity
that's going on down here, Carl.

140
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,000
It's close, man. I can see it.

141
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,400
Right here, right on the strand.

142
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,000
Carl and James' Surf Shop.

143
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,900
It's gold. It's gold, James. It's a gold mine.

144
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,300
Just think of the garbage business
as a way station on the road to nirvana.

145
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,400
Maybe now you're single again, you'll be
able to put more time and energy into it.

146
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,300
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold on, wait a minute, just a second.

147
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,100
I have put a lot of energy
into getting our surf shop together.

148
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,500
And we'd be a lot further along
if I didn't have to do the work of two.

149
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,800
Pardon me? Let's not forget that I chose
the bank that we went to to get our loan.

150
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,900
We didn't even get the loan.

151
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,800
It's not like you researched it. You picked
the name out of the Yellow Pages.

152
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,900
What exactly are...

153
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,200
Good God!

154
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
What exactly are you trying to say?

155
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:33,100
What I'm trying to say, James, is that
sometimes you are completely hopeless.

156
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,600
- Really?
- Yes.

157
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,600
- Hey, Carl.
- Yeah.

158
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,100
- What exactly did you mean by hopeless?
- I meant exactly what I said.

159
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,600
I still don't understand.

160
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,800
Well, let's examine the word.

161
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,000
Hope less. Less than hopeful.
That's what you are.

162
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,900
But am I majorly hopeless
or partially hopeless?

163
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,500
I would say majorly. Why do you ask?

164
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,500
- I'll try to change.
- No, you won't.

165
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,200
I need to talk to you, Leo.

166
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,200
Hi. Nice to see you.

167
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,900
I need your help on something, Leo.

168
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,400
I know who's responsible for
the toxic dumping off Las Playas,

169
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,600
and I'm kind of involved.

170
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
Jesus, Jack.

171
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,800
I just never thought it would go this far.

172
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,300
Look, it's all on the tape. Listen to this.

173
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,900
What is this? Some kind of a joke?

174
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,500
This is not the right tape.

175
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,000
She took the wrong tape!

176
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,200
- What are you talking about?
- The wrong tape!

177
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,600
Hey, wait a minute.

178
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,000
Come on. Let's do the nasty.

179
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,800
- Do we have to?
- Yeah, afraid so.

180
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
- Nasty!
- Nasty!

181
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,200
- Nasty!
- Nasty!

182
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,900
Yeah, Dalton here. Listen,
Jack Berger was in here earlier today.

183
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,900
Claimed he knew who was responsible
for those Las Playas offshore dumpings.

184
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,500
Claimed he had some kind
of a tape that could prove it.

185
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,100
I don't know. This might be nothing,
but I thought you should know.

186
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,700
You did the right thing, Captain. I'm sure
it's nothing, but I appreciate the call.

187
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
<i>- Any time.
- Thank you.</i>

188
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,000
A tape.

189
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
A goddamn tape.

190
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,900
Shrewd move, Berger.

191
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,700
Hey, boys! Where's your originality, huh?

192
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
This means war, man.

193
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,300
Hey, this is shit. It's shit!

194
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,300
Get it off me, Frost! Get it off!
It's shit! It's shit!

195
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,000
It's payback time, you little shits!

196
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Gentlemen, inside now.

197
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,000
- What's up, Walt?
- Nothing too serious today.

198
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,900
I got a complaint about banging trash
cans on P Street at 6am this morning.

199
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,800
- You boys know anything about this?
- No, sir.

200
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,100
Who rolled the bowling ball
down the alley into Avenue H?

201
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,900
Can't help you there either.

202
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,500
In the two years you have worked here,

203
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,600
you have broken every city ordinance
that pertains to this line of work.

204
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,400
Well, you can't say
we haven't been a lot of laughs.

205
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,200
I'm glad you have a sense of humor,
Mr. St James.

206
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,100
Unfortunately, the majority
of the people in this community do not.

207
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,200
Now me, personally, I like you boys.

208
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,000
Which is why
I'm giving you another chance.

209
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,000
Starting tomorrow, you boys
will be riding with a third party.

210
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,100
What?

211
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,200
I have decided to send an observer
along with you on your route.

212
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,700
A representative of Shoreline.

213
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,600
- Who's the observer?
- My brother-in-law.

214
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,900
Consider yourselves on probation.

215
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,900
I suggest you be on your best behavior.

216
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,400
The nerve of Walt, sending us
on our route with a goddamn baby-sitter.

217
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,400
Don't worry about it.

218
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,200
What does a... phrenologist
feel and interpret?

219
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,000
- The size of Walt's asshole.
- Wrong.

220
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,200
No, a phrenologist feels and interprets
the bumps on your head, skull features.

221
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,500
Very good.

222
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,200
Who was Richard Nixon's Chief of Staff
during the final days of Watergate?

223
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,500
Oprah Winfrey.

224
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,000
No, that was... Alexander Haig.

225
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,000
That's right.

226
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
What does gasoline...

227
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,000
Jack! Jack!

228
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,400
The tape!
What did you do with the tape?

229
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,600
Jesus Christ!

230
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,800
- What are you doing?
- I hate shitheads who bully their women.

231
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,100
- So what are you gonna do?
- Shoot him.

232
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,300
- What?
- It's the principle, James.

233
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,400
With a pellet gun? What are you
gonna accomplish using that?

234
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,000
It allows me to seriously
aggravate a situation

235
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,900
without actually changing
the course of history.

236
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,600
It also stings like a bitch.

237
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,100
Well, I'm glad that's over.

238
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,800
Carl, what are you doing?
Everything's cool now.

239
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,100
Mister, it's nothing personal.

240
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,500
- Where do you think you got him?
- Butt shot.

241
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,000
He'll never lay a hand on her again.

242
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,400
Asshole! I wouldn't have
voted for you anyway.

243
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,000
- Stop it! Stop it!
- What?

244
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,200
Shoot him in the head,
his head's all over the place.

245
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,200
Touchdown! The tape! Touchdown!

246
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300
Genius.

247
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,900
Man, this guy's really heavy.
I gotta start working out.

248
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,500
- You should go to the gym.
- I hate weights.

249
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,200
- You work on your cardiovascular.
- What's that?

250
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,700
- Get on one of those life cycles.
- What's that?

251
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,400
- Stationary bike.
- Yeah? How are they?

252
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,700
They're great. They got... cross-country
skiing machines, things where you row.

253
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,400
Come on, get him in there. I wanna go eat.

254
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Come on, come on, come on.

255
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,000
I got it. Start the car.

256
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,000
Right, Jack, I have the tape.

257
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,900
Jack?

258
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,900
Jack?

259
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,700
Touch that again
and I swear to God, I'll kill you.

260
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,800
What'd I do?

261
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,300
Let's go a little bit faster, see if
you can put me through the windshield.

262
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Where the hell am I?

263
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,300
Time for work. Boy, oh boy!

264
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,600
James, do us both a favor.

265
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Whatever you do,

266
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,700
don't give this observer guy
a hard time today.

267
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,300
I figure if we behave ourselves,

268
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,200
show him that
we're a couple of good guys,

269
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,900
we'll get him out of our hair a lot quicker.

270
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,400
OK.

271
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
For all we know...

272
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,800
he could be some crazed combat veteran.

273
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,800
You're driving too fast.

274
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,700
So, Louis, you're Walt’s brother-in-law.
That's great. Speaks highly of you.

275
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,700
What do you know about anything?

276
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,800
Walt’s a nice guy.

277
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,800
His sister must be nice too.
I've never met her.

278
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,600
When I feel like talking to you,
I will look at you.

279
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Gotcha.

280
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,600
You writing stuff about us? Sorry. Sorry.

281
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,300
This sucks.

282
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,300
What did you say, son?

283
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
The name is James.

284
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,800
Well, James,
if you expect to keep this job,

285
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,100
I suggest you tell me what it was
you were mumbling over there.

286
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
James.

287
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,500
I said this sucks.

288
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
And, basically, so do you.

289
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,200
You little... I'll show you
not to talk to me like that!

290
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,100
Hey, hey! Goddammit!

291
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,300
This Louis guy's a total nightmare.

292
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,800
He's not playin' around,
let me tell you, James.

293
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,400
Yeah, I feel really bad about that, Carl.

294
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,700
Probably not as bad as I do.

295
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,600
- James, promise me something.
- What?

296
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,500
No matter what you do,
do not provoke this guy.

297
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,800
- Promise.
- I'm serious.

298
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
I promise.

299
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,700
- How's that nose?
- It's OK.

300
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,500
I still owe one to the intended receiver.

301
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,800
You know, man,
you're a total pain in the a...

302
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,600
Now, James, Louis is gonna be with us
for the next couple of weeks.

303
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,500
Accept this as fact.

304
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,700
Why don't you guys shake hands
and stop behaving like children?

305
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,900
Put it on the back of your neck.

306
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:07,000
There are several sacred things in
this world that you don't ever mess with.

307
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,000
One of them happens to be
another man's fries.

308
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,700
Now, you remember that
and you'll live a long and healthy life.

309
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
James.

310
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
- James.
- What?

311
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,200
You better get over here
and take a look at this.

312
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,700
What is it, Carl?

313
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,900
Just take a look.

314
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,300
- What the hell is this, Carl?
- It's a dead human being, James.

315
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,500
Yeah? What's he doin' on our route?

316
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:45,700
Oh, looky here. Looks like somebody
threw away a perfectly good white boy.

317
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,900
And he sure looks
a hell of a lot like that dude.

318
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
We're screwed.

319
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,200
What do you mean "we"?
You pulled the trigger, pal.

320
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,400
Look, Louis, we gotta talk.

321
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,200
You see, Louis,
Carl sort of knows this guy.

322
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,800
- So?
- I don't know him at all.

323
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,000
- What I'm trying to say is he shot him.
- With a pellet gun.

324
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,300
- But he thought he hit him in the butt.
- I did.

325
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,500
You two seem to be
in some serious shit here.

326
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,800
I need a drink.

327
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,500
Look, Louis, I know
that I did not kill this man.

328
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,000
This guy was beatin' on his old lady,
so I took upon myself to end the dispute.

329
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,200
- So you shot him?
- With a pellet gun.

330
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
So you said.

331
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,800
- And you shot him from where?
- From my apartment.

332
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,400
So how in the hell did he end up here?

333
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
Why don't you ask him?

334
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,100
- Have some. It'll settle your nerves.
- My nerves don't need settling!

335
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,800
What is the maximum sentence
for murder?

336
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,700
I did not murder anyone! Jesus Christ,
James, whose side are you on?

337
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,800
- I am not taking sides.
- You've already convicted me.

338
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm on my way to death row.

339
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,400
Carl, come on.

340
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,900
Let me tell you,
you are in it as much as I am.

341
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,800
You were there.
That makes you an accomplice.

342
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,100
Look, you bastard, I never
wanted you to do it. I was against it.

343
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,200
- Try explaining that to the judge.
- I'm not explaining anything to any judge.

344
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,100
- This is your ball game, Carl.
- You are an asshole!

345
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,400
- You are a trigger-happy idiot!
- I will not rot in prison alone.

346
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,600
You're not gonna mess up my life,
you son of a bitch!

347
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,900
Hey!

348
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,200
You and your stupid pellet gun!

349
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,200
- Get off of me!
- I'll kill you!

350
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,100
You're a stupid man!
You're a stupid little man!

351
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,800
I said enough! I said cut it out!

352
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,700
Hey, you! I said knock it off!

353
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,200
Now look, unless one of you two guys
took a piece of rope or a piece of wire

354
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,700
and strangled this guy,
you're both in the clear.

355
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,200
How the hell do you know?

356
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,900
You can tell by the marks on his neck.
Look at that.

357
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,500
Pretty sloppy job, too.

358
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,100
Not a great idea to keep him
out in the open like this.

359
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,300
I don't like this, Carl.
I don't like this one bit.

360
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,600
- I'm goin' to the cops.
- What?

361
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,700
Looks like they're comin' to us.

362
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
I hate cops.

363
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,900
Well, well. Another fine day
in the dumps, eh, fellas?

364
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:43,400
Who are your friends?
I've never seen you around here before.

365
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,400
Louis here works for the company.

366
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,100
He'll be ridin' with us for the next
couple of weeks to police our activities.

367
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,400
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir, Officer, sir.

368
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,700
- What about you?
- He's...

369
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,200
I didn't ask you, garbageman.

370
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,300
I'm asking the punk who looks like
he's had a few too many.

371
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,600
What the hell's the matter with him?
He looks friggin' dead.

372
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:12,900
Well, the boy's had a rough night.
He's, you know, a... cousin of James.

373
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:18,800
He flew in from... Texas. We were
out late showin' him a good time.

374
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,600
Wherever he's from, he shouldn't be
out on the street in his condition.

375
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,100
I could haul you in, you know. But for now
I'm just gonna give you a warning.

376
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,800
- That's very kind of you, Officer.
- Yeah, it is.

377
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,800
Get him inside that truck and make sure
he stays there until he sobers up.

378
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,000
- Do I make myself clear?
- Crystal, sir. Let's go.

379
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
Not so fast.

380
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,100
I've got the whole Las Playas police
department clued into you two bozos.

381
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You may have escaped me this time,

382
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,900
and all I can say is
"Relish this moment, gentlemen."

383
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:16,000
This is wrong. This is just wrong, wrong,
wrong! We should have just told them.

384
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,100
Told them what?

385
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,200
That we found a body in the trash

386
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,800
that just happened to be Jack Berger,
the man I shot with a pellet gun?

387
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,000
Are you nuts? Those guys are
lookin' for any excuse to put us away.

388
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:34,500
Let's get outta here. We'll stash the body,
get back to work and figure this out later.

389
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,100
Son of a bitch!

390
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,500
I can't believe this. We lost the body.

391
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,900
Hey, relax. We didn't lose the body.

392
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,800
It's in a big yellow can.
How can we miss it?

393
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,900
What do you mean, you've lost the body?

394
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,400
It just kind of fell out
of the back of the car.

395
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,700
Well.

396
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,400
- Find it! Find it, find it, find it, find it!
- Yes, sir.

397
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,100
Your very lives
depend upon it, gentlemen.

398
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,900
- What the hell are you waiting for?
- Sir, we did find the tape.

399
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,100
Oh.

400
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Thank God.

401
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,900
You're excused.

402
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,300
- Wait a minute. The girl.
- What girl?

403
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,700
- The girl we saw Berger fighting with.
- What about her?

404
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,800
Well, maybe she had
something to do with his death.

405
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,200
Yeah, so she strangles him, stuffs him in a
barrel and dumps him on the esplanade?

406
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,600
It makes a lot of sense, Carl.

407
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
You know...

408
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,300
That stiff's startin' to get a little gamy.
You guys come up with anything?

409
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,800
Carl seems to think that
Berger's girl is somehow involved.

410
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,900
The last time we saw Berger alive was
in that fight across from my apartment.

411
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,800
- It's not enough to go on.
- It's a place to start.

412
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,600
How about going to the police? What
we should have done in the first place.

413
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,300
Carl's right. It's a place to start.

414
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,300
We're not gonna accomplish
a goddamn thing standing around here.

415
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,400
So you guys are either
with me or you're not.

416
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,400
I thought you knew how to rig that thing.

417
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,500
I followed the instructions.

418
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,400
Anything good
to eat in this place?

419
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,200
- I could order us a pizza.
- Sounds great. Pepperoni, extra cheese.

420
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,600
Maybe we should put old Milhous
someplace a little less visible.

421
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,300
I need a large pepperoni, extra cheese,

422
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:46,300
to 828 Esplanade, apartment 405.

423
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,700
Last name, Taylor.

424
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,700
Yeah.

425
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,900
OK, what's the total on that?

426
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,600
Hey, Carl.

427
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,700
Hello.

428
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,300
She hardly looks like
a cold-blooded killer.

429
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,600
What now, hotshot?

430
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,100
How about goin' over there and tellin' her

431
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,200
that we got her boyfriend's
dead body sittin' in our shitter?

432
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,900
What are we gonna do?

433
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,700
Stand here watching her like
a bunch of long-distance Peeping Toms?

434
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,000
No.

435
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,500
- I'm goin' over there.
- What?

436
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,700
- I'm goin' over there.
- What for?

437
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,700
I don't know. Snoop around,
see what I can come up with.

438
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,500
Carl, this is not some game. What if
she didn't have anything to do with this?

439
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,800
Gee, James, you sound as if
you're really worried about me.

440
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,400
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- I'm not gonna get in over my head.

441
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,400
Well, that depends on
which head you're talkin' about.

442
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,400
Look, we got your back. If anything funny
happens, don't be too shy to scream.

443
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,200
OK. Save me a slice.

444
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,300
Do you know where
he keeps that gun of his?

445
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,600
What is he doing?

446
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,700
What am I doing?

447
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,400
Uh-oh.

448
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,600
- Don't kill me!
- What?

449
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,700
What? I'm sorry.

450
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,100
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. I've never been better.

451
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,700
- Do you live here in the...
- I'm sorry if I...

452
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
You first.

453
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,700
- Do you live here in the building?
- Yes, I do live here in the building.

454
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,100
For five years I've been in the building.

455
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,100
That's funny.
I've never seen you here before.

456
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,300
Well, I lead a very... private life.

457
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,200
I'm a... a... phrenologist.

458
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,200
What exactly does a phrenologist do?

459
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,700
Well, I feel and interpret the size of
Walt’s asshole... I mean, skull features.

460
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,900
Wow.

461
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:30,600
Not to impose, but if we can go inside and
put some ice on this ankle, it'd be great.

462
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,000
- Inside where?
- Your apartment.

463
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,100
What's the matter with yours?

464
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:39,800
No, my ice machine is broken,
and yours is right here.

465
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:44,300
Are you gonna refuse a wounded man
in dire need of medical attention?

466
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,900
- No.
- Thanks.

467
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,600
- But I didn't catch your name.
- I'm Ted Blanston, the third.

468
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,700
Susan Wilkins, the first.

469
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,900
He's inside.
He's inside her apartment.

470
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,900
Out that light.

471
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,800
What the hell's Carl doing?

472
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,500
- I don't like this, man. I do not like this.
- Shh.

473
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,100
Asshole!

474
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,400
The hell with this. I'm callin' the police.

475
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,700
No cops. I hate cops.

476
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,700
I'm sorry, which ankle was it?

477
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,100
It's the swollen one.

478
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,300
- I really appreciate this.
- It's no trouble.

479
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,800
Are you friendly with the Cottlers?

480
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,200
- I think...
- Second floor?

481
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,900
- Ron and Ann?
- Oh, sure.

482
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,600
Well, I figured, since you're both doctors.

483
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,000
Right. We're all doctors.

484
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,700
Where do you practice?

485
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,500
I got a small office down
in the medical district and...

486
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,100
You know, I could really use a drink.

487
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,300
- Just one.
- Me too.

488
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,800
Thanks.

489
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,300
- Sorry.
- I could have brought it to you.

490
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,200
Thank you.

491
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,300
It's for the pain.

492
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,100
I rarely touch the stuff.
Can I have another one?

493
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,400
I don't believe this.
They're doin' shots, for Christ's sake.

494
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,100
I can't believe I've never met you before.

495
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,300
I thought I knew everyone
who lived in this building.

496
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,500
Well, as I said, I lead a very private life.

497
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,600
Very private life. Yeah.

498
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,500
You know, you're a very beautiful woman.

499
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,800
No, I mean that. I've always thought so.

500
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,700
What do you mean, always?

501
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,900
What I meant was that
you've probably always been beautiful

502
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,700
and it's a shame that
I'm just now discovering this.

503
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,300
Oh.

504
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you.

505
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:24,000
Well, you did.
You wanna switch to champagne?

506
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,800
Sure, if the Dom Perignon is chilled,
that'd be perfect.

507
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,300
How did you know I had Dom?

508
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,300
How did I know you had Dom?
Doesn't everybody?

509
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,300
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom, Louis.

510
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,700
Jesus! Carl spends the evening
with a beautiful woman

511
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,100
and I'm stuck here
with a lunatic and a corpse.

512
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,400
I don't believe this guy.

513
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,500
I can't do this with you starin' at me.

514
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,200
- Who is it?
- Pedro's Pizza and Pancakes.

515
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,000
Yeah!

516
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,300
OK.

517
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,200
- Large pepperoni, extra cheese.
- That's us.

518
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,000
- How much?
- Eight bucks.

519
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,600
OK. One, two,

520
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,900
three, four...

521
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,800
- What's going on here?
- Mind your own business.

522
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,800
OK. Thank you, sir.

523
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,100
You've seen too much.

524
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,900
- What the hell are you doing?
- He saw you with the body.

525
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
- He could start trouble.
- So you kidnap him? Good solution.

526
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,300
Here, take the money.
I won't say anything to anybody!

527
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,200
You bet you won't!

528
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,300
What the hell?

529
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,700
Extra cheese?

530
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,200
- You're a madman.
- He was provoking me.

531
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,700
This situation has definitely
gotten way out of hand.

532
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,300
Get back to that window
and keep Carl covered.

533
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,500
- What the hell do we do with him?
- We need some rope.

534
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,000
Are you gonna get this or what?

535
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,100
Hello?

536
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:09,000
First, you lose the body,

537
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
and then you deliver me the wrong tape.

538
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,100
Now, I don't think that
either of you personally

539
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,300
set out to destroy my company.

540
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:23,500
But I sent you out on a simple task.
And, simply put, you loused it up.

541
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,400
Now, apparently,

542
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,300
Berger had a special relationship
with his campaign manager,

543
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,800
a Susan Wilkins, 825 Esplanade.

544
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,800
That's where we iced Berger, chief.
I know where that is.

545
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,400
Well...

546
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,700
Did it ever occur to you two idiots
that she might have the cassette?

547
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,000
I think he wants us
to kill some more people.

548
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,500
OK.

549
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,700
If I had my 16,
I could pick her off so easily.

550
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,300
This is good. Did you make it?

551
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,400
<i>... reporting from Hanoi Hilton.
Yankee dogs, you might as well give up.</i>

552
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,200
<i>The war is lost. Jane Fonda was right.</i>

553
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,800
Are you hungry? Would you like some?

554
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,000
- Don't give him any, James.
- Why not? He might be hungry.

555
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,500
He's a prisoner,
and he should be treated accordingly.

556
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,800
Have you completely lost your mind?

557
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,900
We're not soldiers and he's not
the enemy. He's a pizza man.

558
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,900
Back in Phu Bai,

559
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,300
he would have been killed
the second he knocked on that door.

560
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:44,300
I would've snapped his neck like a twig.
He never would've seen it coming.

561
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,500
- Louis, Louis, calm down.
- The commie bastard gets no food!

562
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,000
Yeah.

563
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,400
Yes, indeed.

564
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,700
That is deep.

565
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,800
That is definitely deep.

566
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Yes.

567
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,300
Hm.

568
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,400
That's an interesting one.

569
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,400
So is that one.

570
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,500
You were born through Caesarean, no?

571
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,600
- No.
- It's not an exact science, of course.

572
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,000
Apparently not.

573
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,200
Mangoes. You love mangoes.

574
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:33,700
- How did you know that?
- Well, it's all here in the contours.

575
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,400
Yeah.

576
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,600
So, that's phrenology.

577
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,900
It's fascinating, no?

578
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,100
No. Weird.

579
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,300
You know what? First, let's take this off.

580
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,200
And let's do something.

581
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:58,600
- We are doing something.
- Let's get out of here and do something.

582
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,800
- Like what?
- I don't know, but it'll be fun.

583
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,800
Why this sudden burst of energy?
My ankle's killing me.

584
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,800
Come on.

585
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,600
- You want me to get this?
- Oh.

586
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,600
Do you always look in people's trash?

587
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,600
Well, sometimes it's the best way
to get to know 'em.

588
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:27,900
No, no, no. I wanna report
a murder and a kidnapping.

589
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,900
<i>- Murder and a kidnapping.
- That's right.</i>

590
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,200
<i>- Did they take the body?
- No, no, no. I have the body.</i>

591
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,900
<i>- Did you kill the victim?
- No, I didn't kill him.</i>

592
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,500
<i>- Have you been kidnapped?
- I'm not the one who's been kidnapped.</i>

593
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:43,000
<i>- I know this sounds strange...
- I don't think we can help you, sir.</i>

594
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Well, fuck me! Isn't that what the police
are supposed to do - help people?

595
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,100
I am telling you...

596
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,800
They're leaving. Let's go.

597
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,100
Dammit!

598
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,600
Let's move it! Come on!

599
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:07,200
The pizza clown goes with us.
Get him on his feet. I'll get Tricky Dick.

600
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,800
I want you to know, James,
this is all going on my report.

601
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,100
That's great, Louis.
Just make sure you spell my name right.

602
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,300
Don't cross me, James.

603
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,100
All right, let's whack this broad
and get the tape.

604
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,100
Jesus Christ. That's Berger.

605
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,600
What the hell?

606
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,900
Get back here, you goof.

607
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,200
- Who's the kid in the clown suit?
- I don't know.

608
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,100
Oh! Oh, God! Oh, Christ!

609
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,400
Those bastards are gonna pay.

610
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,500
Oh, yeah. They're payin'.

611
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,300
Yo!

612
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,600
There's the broad. There goes the broad.

613
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,400
Come on, come on, come on, you moron.

614
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,300
Are we late for something?

615
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,900
- Faster, James, faster.
- I got it to the floor, Louis.

616
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:54,000
- Who are those guys?
- How the hell am I supposed to know?

617
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,200
And where do these guys
get off, takin' our body?

618
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,000
Come on, we're losing 'em.

619
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,500
Oh, Christ.

620
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,900
- Oh, shit.
- I've almost been waiting for this.

621
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,500
Now you see this here?
This complicates things.

622
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,900
I just don't like killing cops too much.

623
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,200
Forget about the body.
They're the ones drivin' around with it.

624
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,600
I say we stay with the girl.
Potterdam says she might have the tape.

625
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,900
Biff, help me, all right.
Who just died and made you king?

626
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,200
Hey, Mario, how about this?
Your mother did.

627
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,000
Don't you ever say anything,
ever, about my mother.

628
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,700
Your mother did, your mother did. Mario!

629
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,500
- How do we handle this?
- Just pull over.

630
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,300
OK, everybody. Act natural.

631
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,100
Well, well, well. Look who we got here.

632
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,500
I am in no mood for this right now, Mike.

633
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,600
Just write up the ticket
so we can all get on with our lives.

634
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,800
Well, I might not be able
to let you off so easy there, Jimbo.

635
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:37,200
See, you were doing 65 in a 35,
and you ran a red light.

636
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,900
That's reckless driving
as far as I'm concerned.

637
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,600
Who else you got
in there with you, Jimbo?

638
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,800
What the hell is going on in here?

639
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,900
You're... you're never
gonna believe this, Mike.

640
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,000
I... we, uh...

641
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,200
I'm totally floundering.
I can't even come up with a good lie.

642
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,500
What'd I tell you, James?

643
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:10,200
I knew you were crooked and I knew
I'd catch up to you sooner or later.

644
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,200
Everybody out of the vehicle right now.

645
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,300
- Don't do it!
- Don't shoot!

646
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:19,100
- He's got a gun.
- Don't shoot! Please, don't shoot!

647
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:22,100
Yeah, cop. I know you, man.

648
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:26,300
I know what you're thinking. "We got us
another crazy nigger here with a gun."

649
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,900
Well, let me tell you, human life means
very little to me at this point in time.

650
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,900
You see, I thrive on misery.
In the jungle, misery's all you got.

651
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,700
But things are different back here
in the world, or so they seem.

652
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,900
Nobody wants to talk about
pain and suffering.

653
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:47,100
Everybody wants
everything to be nice and civil.

654
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,700
Well, OK, then. Let's be nice. Let's be civil.

655
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:58,100
Drop those guns before I pull this trigger
and change the way you feel about me.

656
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:11,300
Will the officer to the rear of the truck
kindly drop his revolver as well?

657
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:20,000
You know, you cops must really think
I'm as dumb as you look.

658
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:24,000
Now, don't you know that
when a flashlight hits the cement,

659
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,600
it makes a completely
different sound than a revolver?

660
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,300
Let's be good boys,
and do exactly as I say.

661
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:41,300
OK, now, I want Mr. Sneaky Man to come
around and join his partner, Mr. Bonehead.

662
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,300
Sorry, guys.

663
01:00:53,800 --> 01:01:00,000
You will swing for this, James.
I shit you not!

664
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:07,900
I don't know, boys, but they look
pretty goddamn sweet to me.

665
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,400
What do you think?

666
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,400
What do you think?

667
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,500
How you doing?

668
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,900
I'm OK.

669
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:44,700
I think my body's gone into shock
from all the alcohol.

670
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,600
I'd like to sit down, actually.

671
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,700
What was that for?

672
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,300
You didn't like it.

673
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,800
No, I liked it... a lot.

674
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,800
Then shut up.

675
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:51,500
It feels like we're drivin' in circles.
Carl could be anywhere.

676
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,900
You want some?

677
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,600
Promise you're not gonna scream
and cry if I take that gag off?

678
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,400
Now, if you're lyin',
Louis'll have to bash you.

679
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:24,400
You do understand, don't you?

680
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,300
Thank you. Thank you.

681
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,800
- It needs sugar.
- What?

682
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,000
Nothing.

683
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,600
It's not lookin' too good, is it?

684
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,000
- You givin' up?
- I never give up.

685
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:49,200
I never have. Never once, James.

686
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,500
I'm gonna take us back
along the esplanade.

687
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:59,000
- Feels like a long shot to me.
- At this point, everything's a long shot.

688
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,300
I can't see anything.
Frost, gimme some light.

689
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:05,800
This is just a little uncool, Luzinski.

690
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:09,400
Our brouhaha is with Carl,
not with the chick.

691
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,700
I'm just makin' a simple adjustment -
nothing major.

692
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:16,700
Shake 'em up a little bit.
Now, can I have some light, please?

693
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,200
Thank you.

694
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:22,000
- Come on, come on. Hurry up.
- Oh, yeah.

695
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:29,100
Now let's find James, and teach
that simple bastard a lesson too.

696
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,900
Hiya, kids. Are we having fun?

697
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,500
- Ted, what's happening?
- Who the hell are you?

698
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,400
Hey, shut up, you!

699
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,400
What the hell is that?

700
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,300
- It's a Taser.
- A what?

701
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,400
A Taser. 65,000 volts of electricity.

702
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:57,400
It completely incapacitates the victim
without killing him. I got it on sale.

703
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,200
Let's move it. Let's go.

704
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,300
Put your hands up.

705
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,300
Ted, you should do something.

706
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,500
If you come up with any ideas,
please let me know.

707
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,700
We have the right to know
what's going on.

708
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:14,700
Hey, put a cork in it, sister.
You have no more rights.

709
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,500
And you, buying a goddamn laser gun.

710
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,400
- Taser.
- Whatever.

711
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,500
- You've always gotta be so different.
- I'm in no mood. Just lay off.

712
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:27,000
- No, you gotta be creative.
- I said lay off.

713
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,600
When I say "now", start running.

714
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,000
You're an amazing man.
You know shit about absolutely nothing.

715
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,500
Now I've just heard everything.

716
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,300
Hold it, honey.

717
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,800
You listen to me, you Italian
son of a bitch, and you listen good.

718
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:47,300
The day you tell me I don't know shit
and I let you get away with it

719
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:51,300
- is the day that that ocean freezes over.
- That's it. You're over.

720
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,500
Now!

721
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,100
- That's my car!
- Looks pretty undriveable. Come on!

722
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,600
Come on, let's go!

723
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,300
Ted!

724
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:26,500
- Ted, what the hell's going on?
- I left out a couple of things about myself.

725
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:30,400
- I'm waiting, you son of a bitch.
- First, my name isn't Ted. It's Carl.

726
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:33,000
From now on when you yell for me
in a panic, yell Carl.

727
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,600
There's more?

728
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:38,000
Last night you and Jack Berger
had a fight in your apartment.

729
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,400
How the hell could you
have possibly known that?

730
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,100
Look, Susan, I don't live in your building.

731
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,800
I am a garbageman.
I live across the street from you.

732
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,300
I have been watching you
every day for six weeks.

733
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,900
Wait a minute! Wait a minute.
You have been spying on me?

734
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:58,100
- I don't really consider it spying.
- What do you consider it?

735
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:01,200
Let me finish! You and Jack
had a fight, you left angry.

736
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,000
The next morning
I found Berger's body in the trash.

737
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,400
- Jack's body?
- Somebody killed him, Susan.

738
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,100
- For a while I thought it was you.
- Jack is not dead.

739
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:13,000
- Jack was at my apartment last night.
- Trust me, Jack is dead.

740
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Jack came over because
there was some mix-up with a tape

741
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:20,200
and I went down to my car to get
the right tape and... The tape, the tape.

742
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:24,100
This is what had Jack so worked up.
We gotta get this to the police.

743
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,500
- What the hell was that for?
- For lying to me. I hate liars!

744
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,700
Hates liars?

745
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,500
That's for spying on me!

746
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:39,700
Come on!

747
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,300
What happened?

748
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,700
It was something.
You got struck by lightning.

749
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,100
- Really?
- A freak storm.

750
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,700
- Police!
- Thank God.

751
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,100
- Police!
- Hello!

752
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,100
Over here, by the playground.

753
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Ew.

754
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,400
Sorry, guys.

755
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:51,200
Wait! It's not what it looks like.
Please, give us a hand.

756
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:54,000
No, I'm really not into it, but thanks.

757
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Carl! Come on, Carl. Everything
I ever said about you, just kidding.

758
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,000
He was.

759
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:07,100
You're not really gonna leave us here,
are you? That would be...

760
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,900
- Come on, come on, already!
- About a thousand keys here.

761
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,400
- Try this one.
- I'm trying.

762
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,600
Hey, hey, hey!

763
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,600
- I got it!
- Look out.

764
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,900
It's my turn, asshole!

765
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,900
- What is he doing?
- What are you doing?

766
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,700
- I'm crashing!
- Down!

767
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,900
I'm back.

768
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,500
Let's go, honey.

769
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:21,200
Chief, we got 'em. We found 'em.

770
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:31,800
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Maxwell Potterdam the third.

771
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:35,300
<i>Maybe you've heard of me. California
magazine just did a piece on me.</i>

772
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,400
With the exception of being
misquoted several times,

773
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,700
I thought it was a pretty good article.

774
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,100
Anyway, all that is... unimportant.

775
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:51,500
This... is what's important.

776
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,200
Let's put these folks in the car

777
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:58,000
and go someplace a little more noisy.

778
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,200
Come on, move it.

779
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,900
Hey.

780
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,800
That's them. Getting into that limo.

781
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:18,300
- What the hell's goin' on?
- I don't know, but we're gonna find out.

782
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,600
I knew this was gonna get heavy.

783
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,600
A lot of good this thing is gonna do us.

784
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,500
A pellet gun? You've been holding me
hostage all night with an air rifle?

785
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,800
- Shut up.
- This is too much.

786
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,800
We gotta find a way in there.

787
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,800
I... I got a plan.

788
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,300
That oughta do them.

789
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:28,000
I would love to see
those bastards try and top this.

790
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:33,500
I would pay a million pesos to see their
faces when they try to stop this baby.

791
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:36,900
Hey, pal, the next time
we see Carl and James,

792
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:40,600
it's gonna be Walt
handing them their walking papers.

793
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:46,100
Somebody's coming.

794
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,100
Come on!

795
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,800
- Come on, move it. Get up there.
- OK, I'm going.

796
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:25,900
We do live in extraordinary times.

797
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:29,100
The lengths one has to go
to get the job done.

798
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:32,700
You're destroying the environment
and you don't even care.

799
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:36,200
How do you do it?
How do you live with yourself?

800
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,300
Gentlemen.

801
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,600
Although I'd prefer to dump you

802
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,200
along with the rest of this waste
at the bottom of the Pacific,

803
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:49,600
recent disruptions in our operation
have created a problem,

804
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:55,400
and now the Las Playas landfill
will become your final resting place.

805
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,900
- Buried alive?
- Not to worry.

806
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:02,200
You'll probably run out of oxygen
before we reach the dump site.

807
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,800
Seal 'em up.

808
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,600
No!

809
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,400
Hold on, everyone!

810
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Hey!

811
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,700
Something's wrong. We're not stopping.

812
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,200
- What?
- We're not stopping!

813
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,700
Aaargh!

814
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:48,600
- What the hell was that?
- Move your ass and find out.

815
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:52,400
No, you two stay.
I want those barrels sealed. You two.

816
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:03,300
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah.

817
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,300
Oh, shit.

818
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,800
Get off of me.

819
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,200
Come on, let's go.

820
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,400
No, no, no. No, no, no.

821
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:48,700
I am not some kind of comic-book
superhero. I'm a pizza man.

822
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:52,200
- Stay here and keep an eye on him.
- Yeah, right.

823
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,900
I want the trucks moving immediately.

824
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,700
I want every goddamn drop of waste
dumped before the sun rises.

825
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,700
OK, Mr. Potterdam.

826
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:16,400
Go this way!

827
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:23,700
Jesus!

828
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,100
Holy shit!

829
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,700
All right,
I'll pick it up on my way back.

830
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:55,100
- Hi, Carl.
- Hi, James. How are you?

831
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,800
Never better.

832
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Susan! Come on.

833
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,100
Come on! We can't lose 'em!

834
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:24,000
- We're not gonna make it.
- We'll make it.

835
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,500
South Bay Security. Freeze!

836
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:51,600
Rent-a-cops. I hate rent-a-cops too.

837
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,600
Carl! What the hell are we doing?

838
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,900
I think I love this girl.

839
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,300
Really? How do you know?

840
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:14,200
She let me feel the bumps on her head.

841
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,100
Whoa!

842
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:21,100
- It looks like the bolt broke!
- No shit!

843
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,800
- Hang on.
- OK.

844
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,200
Trees! Trees!

845
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,700
- Carl!
- What?

846
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,500
- How you doin' over there?
- Piece of cake.

847
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,100
You need help.

848
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,200
Carl!

849
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,600
James!

850
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,400
Hey, Carl!

851
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,600
I think I got a problem over here.

852
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,800
All right, let me think of something.

853
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:31,400
Hey, James, I didn't think of anything yet.

854
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:40,500
Hey, Carl! I definitely
got a problem over here!

855
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,700
I'm coming.

856
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:35,200
Mr. Potterdam?

857
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,400
We're lookin' pretty outnumbered here.

858
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,000
I got an idea. Follow me.

859
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:30,100
- What the hell are you doing?
- Protecting the environment.

860
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,200
- Freeze.
- What are you...

861
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:45,800
Everybody freeze or I blow his head off!

862
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,700
- He'll do it.
- I'm not kiddin'.

863
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,400
- Don't push him.
- I mean it.

864
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,500
His whole head.

865
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,700
You two with the weapons,
over the side. Do it now!

866
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:04,600
Yeah, man, I know you.

867
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:09,300
I know what you're thinking. "We got us
another crazy white boy with a gun."

868
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:14,100
Well, let me tell you, human life means
very little to me at this point in time.

869
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,000
Relax, James, the cops are here.

870
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:30,800
This is the police.
You all drop those weapons.

871
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:36,600
Yeah. Yeah, you!
You there with the pellet gun,

872
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:40,400
drop it or I'll blow
your butt away for sure, buddy.

873
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:54,300
A pellet gun? Do you think we'd use
a pellet gun for something like this?

874
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:56,100
Get 'em!

875
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,700
I gotta find Susan.

876
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,100
Susan!

877
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,700
Susan!

878
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,400
Uh-oh.

879
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,900
Stop 'em before they get away!

880
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Susan! Susan!

881
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:40,000
Susan!

882
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,300
Help!

883
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Susan.

884
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,300
Ow! Oh!

885
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,300
- Where are we?
- You don't wanna know.

886
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:14,000
Carl! Carl, over here! Get down!

887
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:28,600
Come on. Move out.

888
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,700
Move! Everybody in the car.

889
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,400
Get the door open.

890
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:44,300
- Start the car.
- It won't start.

891
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:49,300
- Get out of the car!
- Oh, shit!

892
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,200
<i> Ouch! Be careful!</i>

893
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,700
High five!

894
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:18,000
Your car, sir.

895
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,900
Smile, butthead.

896
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:00,000
Whoa.

897
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,000
Hey, it's not what it looks like.

898
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,300
We're respectable peace officers.

899
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:04,600
It's just all one big, funny mix-up.

900
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,000
No!

901
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:22,600
Shoo! Shoo!

902
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,100
Get outta here!

903
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:27,300
<i>Good morning! You're listening
to the Poorman on open-line.</i>

904
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:32,300
<i>We're gonna take our next caller.
Hello! You're on open-line. Go ahead.</i>

905
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,300
<i>Yeah, hi. My name's Stacey.</i>

906
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:37,800
<i>I have a boyfriend who I've been
going out with for two years now.</i>

907
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,800
<i>He works nights
as a delivery boy for a pizza place.</i>

908
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,000
<i>Last night he never came home</i>

909
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,900
<i>and I am positive he is out
sleeping with another girl.</i>

910
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,900
<i> Well, I think you should
definitely dump the dude!</i>
