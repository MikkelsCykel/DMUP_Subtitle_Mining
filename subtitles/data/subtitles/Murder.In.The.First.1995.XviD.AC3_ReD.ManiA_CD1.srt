<i>Alcatraz was the scene last night
of a dramatic escape attempt.</i>

17
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:05,908
<i>Four desperate prisoners
were apprehended...</i>

18
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:07,974
<i>...on the rocky beach below the prison.</i>

19
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:11,611
<i>The recently completed
Golden Gate Bridge serves as a backdrop.</i>

20
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:14,153
<i>So near, yet so far from freedom...</i>

21
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:18,919
<i>...the surviving escapees, Henri Young
and Rufus McCain are escorted back...</i>

22
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:23,325
<i>...while their less fortunate cohorts
are destined for the morgue.</i>

23
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:28,099
<i>The body of Doc Barker,
son of the infamous Ma Barker...</i>

24
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:31,331
<i>...lies bullet-riddled,
cooling on a steel gurney...</i>

25
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,669
<i>...attended by a triumphant guard.</i>

26
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:38,471
<i>The jubilant correctional officers
who foiled the escape...</i>

27
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:42,515
<i>...congratulate each other
and reluctantly show their battle scars.</i>

28
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:46,981
<i>A proud Warden Humson,
supervisor of three penitentiaries...</i>

29
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,593
<i>...Folsom, San Quentin and Alcatraz,
and confidant of J. Edgar Hoover...</i>

30
00:01:51,895 --> 00:01:53,795
<i>...congratulates his troops.</i>

31
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,561
<i>Humson returns to his duties...</i>

32
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:01,468
<i>...as the inmates are sent
through metal detectors...</i>

33
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,598
<i>...cells are searched,
extra guards are called up...</i>

34
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:09,541
<i>...and Alcatraz goes on full alert
to forestall any additional trouble.</i>

35
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:12,740
<i>As public interest reached a frenzy...</i>

36
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:15,710
<i>...Warden Humson
and Associate Warden Glenn...</i>

37
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,583
<i>...left the island in the bay
for a press conference...</i>

38
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:21,419
<i>...headed for the San Francisco City Hall...</i>

39
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:26,258
<i>...which was inundated with a plethora
of reporters from around the globe...</i>

40
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:29,689
<i>...all gathered to hear the official reaction.</i>

<i>Associate Warden Milton Glenn...</i>

42

<i>...introduces Warden John Humson.</i>

43
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:39,172
Warden Humson will now make
a brief statement and...

44
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,939
...if you please, no questions at the end.
Thank you.

45
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,171
l just want to reassure
the American people that...

46
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,844
...Alcatraz is an escape-proof prison.

47
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,578
They have nothing to fear.

48

<i>The inmates, McCain and Young...</i>

49

<i>...will be brought up on escape charges.</i>

50
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,191
<i>There will be time in solitary confinement.</i>

51
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:04,993
<i>Privileges will be taken away from them.</i>

52
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:08,804

How long?

68
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:15,190
<i>Alcatraz was opened as
a federal penitentiary in the spring of 1934.</i>

69
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:18,360
<i>In the era of the gangster...</i>

70
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:22,004
<i>...it was opened more for
the publicity value than the incarceration.</i>

71
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:25,336
<i>Alcatraz was the most feared prison
in the world...</i>

72
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,137
<i>...and the most expensive.</i>

73
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,145
<i>There were only so many Al Capones
and Machine Gun Kellys...</i>

74
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:33,141
<i>...so the prison had empty cells.</i>

75
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:38,146
<i>To justify the costs, the government took
incorrigibles from other prisons...</i>

76
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,447
<i>...men that had committed smaller,
more petty crimes...</i>

77
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:43,988

80
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:56,934
<i>Prior to 1938, there had been
five escape attempts.</i>

81
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,768
<i>No one had made it.</i>

82
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:02,299
<i>The reputation of Alcatraz as being
unescapable was secure.</i>

83
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,674
<i>Six inmates had died.</i>

84
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:07,981
<i>The ones who didn't die
sometimes wished they had.</i>

85
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:23,494
<i>The federal guideline regarding
solitary confinement states...</i>

86

You did good.

00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,837
<i>The only other survivor
of the escape attempt was Rufus McCain.</i>

123
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,982
<i>He had betrayed his fellow inmates
by tipping off the associate warden.</i>

124
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,554
<i>McCain was rewarded
and left in the general population.</i>

125

...live by the rules...

134
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:17,477
...that society has set down.

135
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:28,625
You're not one of them.

136
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:37,532
Henri, l have a job to do here at Alcatraz.

137
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,369
Do you know what that is?

138
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,269
To protect you...

139
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:43,301
...from yourself.

140
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:47,277
You were among the selected sinners...

141
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:50,443
...the state set apart
so that you could simmer in scum.

142
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,453
The good people of the United States
have decided...

143
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:56,948
...that you are better off here.

144
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,662
l had nothing to do with that decision.

145
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:07,299
But where l play a part in your life is
to make sure that you stay here.

146
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:10,764
That you rehabilitate yourself...

147
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,273
...become a model prisoner...

148
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:15,470
...a better human being.

149
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,609
That's my job, Henri.

150
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:20,782
You too have a job.

151
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,284
And trying to escape...

152
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:28,114
...is not one of the duties
of your job description. Understand?

153
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:29,655
ln life...

154
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,093
...for every action...

155
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:39,332
...there is a definite and distinct reaction.

156
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,101
Action...

157
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:47,774

-Yes, Mr. Glenn.
-Now, if you escape, action:

159
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,648
l lose my job.

160
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,511
Reaction: l have a family...

161
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:59,685
...that l will not be able to provide for!

162
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:02,281
l'm not done yet.

163
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:05,494
Now, knowing this information...

164
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:07,423
...can you tell me...

165
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,861
...why you would possibly
want to escape...

166
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,901
...and jeopardize my family?

167
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,768
l've done nothing to you but my job.

168
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:27,508
And instead of letting you learn...

169
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,208
...by breaking the rules,
l feel l need to show you how to...

170
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:32,615
...obey them.

171
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:34,413
Tolerance.

172
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:36,752
Tolerance for pain.

173
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,057
My tolerance of you.

174
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:43,425
But tolerance can be mistaken
for kindness.

175
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,298
And kindness can be mistaken
for weakness.

176
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:51,035
And we can't have weakness,
can we, Henri?

177
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,932
l understand. l will be good.

178
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,175
l'm not gonna try and run again.

179
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:57,507
No, you won't.

180
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,673
Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

181
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:02,008
Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

182
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,115
Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

183
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,579
Action, reaction.

184
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:09,780
Good.

185
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:12,060
Good.

186
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:16,788
Good.

187
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:27,275
Clean him up, take him to the hole.

188
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,046
<i>Christmas, 1939,

They sound great.

201

Merry Christmas.

''Standing 'round a flagpole

He sings it over and over.
l can't get him to shut up.

lt gets on your nerves.

205
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:50,317
<i>In January of 1941,
I had passed the bar exam.</i>

206
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,487
<i>Henri Young was in his third year
of rehabilitation.</i>

207
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,732
<i>Welcome to Alcatraz, gentlemen.</i>

208
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:02,668
<i>Step off the boat and onto the dock.</i>

209

<i>Eyes straight ahead at all times.</i>

210
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:11,908
<i>There was a boat
named after Warden Humson...</i>

211
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:14,847
<i>...which handled the traffic
to and from Alcatraz.</i>

212
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:19,820
<i>In the morning and afternoon, it shuttled
the children to San Francisco for classes.</i>

213
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:23,453
<i>It was also used to transport prisoners
to the island.</i>

214
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:26,425
<i>When possible, having children
and prisoners on the boat...</i>

215

<i>...at the same time was avoided.</i>

<i>Don't look at the children.</i>

217

l'll take the kids to the city.

218
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,904
We'll go shopping.

Honey, can l call you back?

220
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:41,241
The warden's here.

221
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,907
Good morning, Warden.

222
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:46,209
Good morning.

223
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,516
-When did you arrive on the island?
-About 20 minutes ago.

224
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:51,280
Good.

225
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:52,820
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

226
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:56,254
Mr. Glenn...

227
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:59,121
...l've been going over
the rotation figures...

228
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:02,055
...in the solitary-confinement cells.

229
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,098
ls there something wrong?

230
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,135
Well, l don't know.
l don't think this can be right.

231
00:18:07,436 --> 00:18:08,562
What's that?

232
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:10,398
Here, 244.

233
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,901
According to this, he's been in there
since March of '38.

234
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,206
l don't believe there's been
an attitude change with regard to 244.

235
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:21,947
He's not like the other inmates.

236
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:23,683
That's over three years!

237
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:26,414
He masterminded
the escape attempt in '38.

238
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,456
There hasn't been one since.

239
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:32,321
<i>If you let those animals believe
that escape is possible...</i>

240
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,130
<i>...you might as well stick in
a revolving door.</i>

241
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:38,595
<i>I think he has learned his lesson.</i>

242
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:44,395
Come on, Henri. Let's go.

243
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:51,443
<i>Henri Young had been rehabilitated.</i>

244

<i>I was now a public defender
in San Francisco. We'd meet in three days.</i>

245
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:57,677
Eat, Young!

246
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,823
You know the rules!
You don't eat, you go to solitary!

247
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:05,357
Now, get with it!

248
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,594
<i>Two times two is four.</i>

249
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,824
<i>Two times three is six.</i>

250
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,135
<i>Two times four is eight.</i>

251
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,896
<i>Eight.</i>

252
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:17,895
<i>Two times five...</i>

253
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,036

<i>...ninety-six.</i>

<i>Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe,
maybe more--</i>

258
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:41,388
Henri, McCain, he put you in the hole.

259
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,154
Put you in the hole.

260
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:45,366
McCain's still here. Look!

261
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,331
<i>McCain put you in the hole!
Put you in the hole!</i>

<i>McCain, he put you in the hole.
Put you in the hole!</i>

Get them back!

264
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:35,816
Get them back against the wall now!

265
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:37,349
Do it now!

266
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:39,547
What happened?

267
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:41,222

l'm sorry. Mary, you okay?

298
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:38,724
-Stop that!
-Okay, l'm sorry!

299
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:42,268
lf Henkin saw us, he wouldn't think twice
about suspending us.

300
00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:43,771
-All right.
-Fix your tie.

301
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,806
Why?

302
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:47,766
You need to look good
when you thank Henkin.

303
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:50,902
What do l want to thank Henkin for?
The man's a cretin.

304
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:54,172
-He's given you a case.
-Case of what? Scotch?

305
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:56,610
Yes, James, a case of Scotch.

306
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:59,515
An actual case where l stand
in front of a jury?

307

-Federal murder one, no less.
-Henri Young.

308
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:07,227
He's a convict who killed another convict
in front of 200 witnesses.

309
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:10,431
Was it self-defense?

310
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:11,725
With a spoon.

311
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,164
What with a spoon?

312
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:16,500
That was the murder weapon.
He used a spoon to kill the man.

313
00:24:16,571 --> 00:24:19,005
Weren't any forks or knives available?

314
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:21,008
My first case l can't possibly win.

315
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:25,012
Do this one for the experience, for the next
time, when maybe your guy didn't do it.

316
00:24:25,113 --> 00:24:26,410
You could learn a lot.

317
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:28,608
Go see your client
and make nice to Henkin.

318
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,878
-l'll see you tonight?
-Maybe.

319
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:36,382
Thank you for your confidence in me
in getting this case.

320
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:39,688
l don't have any confidence in you.
The guy is guilty.

321
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:43,127
A monkey could try this case
and not make it any worse.

322
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:45,063
-l see.
-Remember that.

323
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:46,996
-Thank you, sir.
-A monkey.

324
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:50,796
l guess l'm a monkey.

325
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:14,058
-James Stamphill to see Henri Young.
-l need you to sign the release.

326
00:25:17,632 --> 00:25:19,862
-lt's a nice day.
-Yeah, great.

327
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:52,932
Where are you going?

328
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:54,764
To the cell, talk to my client.

329
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:56,269
What, are you nuts?

330
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:58,499
l want to speak to him face to face.

331
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:00,675
Well....

332
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:05,004
You've already signed the release.

333
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:11,950
lt's your life.

334
00:26:16,691 --> 00:26:17,658
Hi.

335
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,919
So, then, Mr. Young, is it?

336
00:26:23,198 --> 00:26:25,325
You're Mr. Young, is that correct?

337
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:29,329
Mr. Young, that is your name, isn't it?

338
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:30,563
Henri Young?

339
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:37,209
l'll just assume that's your name
until you tell me differently.

340
00:26:37,612 --> 00:26:40,479
Mr. Young, l will be acting
as your defense attorney.

341
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:43,108
l'm James Stamphill
and anything you tell me...

342
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:46,813
...will be protected under the rules
of confidentiality...

343
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:50,083
...of the attorney-client relationship.
So feel completely free...

344
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:53,490
...to answer my questions
in an honest and forthright fashion.

345
00:26:53,561 --> 00:26:56,860
Just for the record,
your name is Henri Young, right?

346
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:04,502
This isn't an admission of guilt.
lt's just your name.

347
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,739
You speak English?

348
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:13,205
Yeah, you do speak English.
lt says so right here in the file.

349
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,115
Mr. Young...

350
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:27,490
...l am your attorney but l can't provide you
with much of a defense if one of us is...

351
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:29,190
...catatonic.

352
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:31,292
You see...

353
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,659
...we both have to be able and willing
to answer when our name is called.

354
00:27:39,374 --> 00:27:40,841
Can you hear?

355
00:27:58,393 --> 00:27:59,621
Mr. Young?

356
00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:03,153
You okay, Mr. Young?

357
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:05,993
<i>Henri Young was born in Kansas in 1913.</i>

358
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:09,967
<i>His parents died ten years later...</i>

359
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:12,336
<i>...leaving Henri to raise his younger sister.</i>

360
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:17,272
<i>At the age of 17, Henri went into
a local store to try to get a job.</i>

361
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,843
<i>He was refused work.</i>

362
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:26,119
<i>Out of desperation he reached
into the cash register and took $5.</i>

363
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:30,482
<i>The store also doubled
as the town's post office.</i>

364
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:35,862
<i>Henri was tried and convicted
of the federal crime of mail robbery.</i>

365
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:40,400
<i>Henri's sister was taken
to live in an orphanage.</i>

366
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,203
<i>He would never see her again.</i>

367
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:48,809
<i>Eleven years later,
Henri would kill Rufus McCain.</i>

368
00:29:16,037 --> 00:29:17,334
Mr. Young...

369
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:19,730
...you killed a guy, so...

370
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:22,208
...you're not catatonic.

371
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,480
l know that you can talk.

372
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:28,949
l don't know...

373
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:32,385
...maybe you could write something.

374
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,514
You want to write something? Write here.

375
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:42,323
Something. Just....

376
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:45,457
Look, you want to give it a try?

377
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:47,191
You want to write?

378
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:53,070
Something...

379
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:54,469
...please.

380
00:29:56,511 --> 00:29:58,741
Mr. Young, you're looking at me.

381
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,911
You hear me, don't you?

382
00:30:03,418 --> 00:30:07,115
lf you won't answer my questions,
maybe we can start with something else.

383
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,986
What do you want?
There has to be something.

384
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:14,051
Can't be to sit there, because if you do,
they'll just stick you in the gas chamber.

385
00:30:14,162 --> 00:30:15,789
Do you understand that?

386
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,077
Look...

387
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,273
...Mr. Young, l've read your file.

388
00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:37,708
l am trying to help you.

389
00:30:38,486 --> 00:30:41,455
That's all l'm trying to do.
l just want to help you.

390
00:30:42,123 --> 00:30:43,556
Maybe there are...

391
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,652
...extenuating circumstances in your case.

392
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,460
Getting sentenced to Leavenworth
for stealing...

393
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:53,601
...$500, that's extenuating.

394
00:30:58,706 --> 00:31:01,266
You have to understand, l'm on your side.

395
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:02,406
$5.

396
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:03,808
What, Mr. Young?

397
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,814
lt was $5, not $500.

398
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,818
l knew you had it in you. Now, come on.
Why did you kill Rufus McCain?

399
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:16,246
You just talked. Don't do this again.

400
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,121
Come on, don't quit now.
Come on, you just talked!

401
00:31:20,662 --> 00:31:22,289
Why did you kill McCain?

402
00:31:28,603 --> 00:31:29,570
What?

403
00:31:30,505 --> 00:31:32,336
-What are you saying?
-How....

404
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:33,931
How? How? How?

405
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:36,175
Are you saying ''how''?

406
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:37,268
How.

407
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:38,846
How?

408
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:40,538
How.

409
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:45,952
How. What are you, a fucking lndian?
Don't quit now. How what?

410
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:46,917
How is....

411
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,617
You want to know how somebody is?
l'll find out immediately.

412
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:52,049
How is....

413
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,456
Who?

414
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:54,722
DiMaggio.

415
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:56,687
How is DiMaggio?

416
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:59,224
ls he a prisoner over at Alcatraz?

417
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:00,891
How is...

418
00:32:01,135 --> 00:32:02,432
...DiMaggio...

419
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:04,104
...doing this year?

420
00:32:05,873 --> 00:32:08,103
DiMaggio, the baseball player?

421
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:09,610
Yeah.

422
00:32:11,145 --> 00:32:15,673
How is Joe DiMaggio, the baseball player,
doing? That's what you're asking?

423
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:24,156
Mr. Young...

424
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:29,594
...l don't really follow baseball.

425
00:32:31,065 --> 00:32:32,123
You know.

426
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:45,005
<i>Excuse me, Mr. McNeil,
I'm James Stamphill.</i>

427
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,148
-Counsel for Henri Young.
-Yes.

428
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,185
l was wondering if l could talk to you
about continuance?

429
00:32:51,252 --> 00:32:52,219
No.

430
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,118
You don't understand.
He just sits there and won't speak.

431
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:59,148
Maybe he's practicing for the gas chamber.
Tell him to take deep breaths.

432
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,957
You won't even consider a joint motion
in the interest of justice?

433
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:06,366
-Are you old enough to be a lawyer?
-Yes, sir, l am.

434
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:08,834
No joint motion for a continuance.

435
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:12,029
No psychiatrist.
And trust me, pal, no plea bargain.

436
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:13,867
Your boy's gonna suck the pipe.

437
00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:18,003
l don't know who you pissed off
to get this shit case and l don't care.

438
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:19,079
No breaks.

439
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,021
Mr. Young, DiMaggio is having
a great year.

440
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,752
Last year he was the American League
batting champ with a .352 average...

441
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:40,129
...which was just a bit off the year before
when he had a .381 average.

442
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:42,633
The Yankees, they too had a good year.

443
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,231
New York defeated Chicago 4-0...

444
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:48,737
...led by jolting Joe DiMaggio hitting 400.

445
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:51,737
400, that's pretty good, isn't it?

446
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:55,411
June 1 7, 1941 ...

447
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,508
...our friend DiMaggio hits safely
in 32 straight games.

448
00:34:00,054 --> 00:34:03,319
Twelve more and he will tie
Wee Willie Keeler's all-time record...

449
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:06,724
...who set the mark in 1897
for the Baltimore Orioles.

450
00:34:07,061 --> 00:34:11,498
Joe Louis was the victor in what some
consider the toughest win of his career.

451
00:34:17,939 --> 00:34:20,567
Here we go.
Here's some entertainment news.

452
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:21,869
Betty Grable.

453
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:23,033
See?

454
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,477
Says here she's just--

455
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:29,743
How old are you?

456
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:31,216
What, Mr. Young?

457
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:33,753
How old are you?

458
00:34:35,356 --> 00:34:36,721
l'm 24.

459
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:41,926
l think...

460
00:34:42,697 --> 00:34:44,028
...l am too.

461
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:48,028
No, you're...

462
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:50,570
...you're 28.

463
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:07,716
Would you like me to keep reading to you?

464
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:20,158
This ought to make you
a little bit more comfortable.

465
00:35:35,683 --> 00:35:39,642
The defense requests a new jury.
Having been eliminated from this process--

466
00:35:39,754 --> 00:35:41,153
Three new members.

467
00:35:41,255 --> 00:35:42,586
And that's it.

468
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,057
Next.

469
00:35:45,293 --> 00:35:48,262
The defense requests a continuance
of 60 days...

470
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:50,194
...so l may confer with my client--

471
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:52,399
He doesn't need 60 days.

472
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:55,659
The facts in this case are so clear,
six minutes should do it.

473
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,034
My client has been almost catatonic.

474
00:35:58,172 --> 00:36:01,039
-Yesterday was the first day--
-He wasn't so catatonic...

475
00:36:01,108 --> 00:36:05,442
...that he couldn't walk over and slit
a guy's throat in front of 200 witnesses.

476
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,716
ls it your contention
that the defendant is insane?

477
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:12,351
ls that what you mean by ''catatonic''?

478
00:36:13,688 --> 00:36:15,656
Approach the bench, Counselor.

479
00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:20,321
ls this laying the groundwork...

480
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,090
...for a not-guilty by reason
of insanity plea?

481
00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:27,256
l don't know yet. l haven't even spoken
to him about the case--

482
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,427
One week, Counselor.

483
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:32,973
Then you will either tell me
you are ready for the trial...

484
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,099
...or you will come in here with a request
for a competency hearing.

485
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:38,539
One week.

486
00:36:40,815 --> 00:36:42,783
This court is in recess.

487
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:01,294
Mr. Young, you and me,
we've got to talk now.

488
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:03,868
Would you like a cigarette?

489
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:05,303
No, thanks.

490
00:37:05,673 --> 00:37:07,436
That shit will kill you.

491
00:37:08,843 --> 00:37:09,901
That's...

492
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:11,510
...kind of funny.

493
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:13,840
''That shit'll kill you.''

494
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:17,684
l'll die in that gas chamber anyway,
so that's kind of a joke.

495
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:20,320
What's this about Nazis? We at war?

496
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,520
No, not yet, Mr. Young.

497
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:24,188
-lt's brand new.
-What?

498
00:37:24,258 --> 00:37:26,419
-Mr. Glenn told me.
-The associate warden?

499
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:30,054
He says it's brand new.
He said they're gonna try it out on me.

500
00:37:34,268 --> 00:37:35,235
No.

501
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:38,867
You only have a week.

502
00:37:39,206 --> 00:37:41,333
You've got to talk to me. Okay?

503
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:44,077
Why did you kill Rufus McCain?

504
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,975
Why did you kill Rufus McCain?

505
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:54,613
How could you not know about baseball?

506
00:37:56,891 --> 00:37:59,223
You said, ''l don't follow baseball.''

507
00:37:59,293 --> 00:38:01,284
-How could you not?
-Why'd you kill him?

508
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:04,956
Over and over, it must have been
maybe a year, l don't know.

509
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:07,034
All l did was hear them in my head.

510
00:38:07,134 --> 00:38:10,501
What are you talking about?
Are you talking about McCain?

511
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:14,074
l'm talking about baseball.
The great American pastime.

512
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:17,544
l went over every game
l ever heard on the radio.

513
00:38:18,245 --> 00:38:22,272
l went over every game l ever heard.
Just playing them over in my head.

514
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:26,053
You had all those games to go to...

515
00:38:26,153 --> 00:38:28,212
...and you didn't even care.

516
00:38:28,422 --> 00:38:30,390
l'm talking about Rufus McCain.

517
00:38:30,524 --> 00:38:34,119
l'm talking about three fucking years
they had me in that bucket!

518
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:36,053
Three fucking years!

519
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:40,266
Without any fucking light!
You had all those games to listen to!

520
00:38:41,435 --> 00:38:44,495
You didn't even know
what DiMaggio hit this year.

521
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,340
What kind of asshole are you?

522
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:51,411
Calm down, boy!

523
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:57,214
You know the average length of time
an inmate would be in solitary?

524
00:38:57,284 --> 00:38:58,308
Nineteen days.

525
00:38:58,853 --> 00:39:00,946
l understand, but he killed a man.

526
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:04,047
Henry did three years in total darkness.
ln a black hole.

527
00:39:04,158 --> 00:39:07,753
That's tragic, but he took a life.
Your brother will tell you what l did.

528
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:10,729
-You won't get him off.
-He's the best lawyer l know.

529
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:14,859
He can tell me if we've got a chance
for some kind of insanity plea.

530
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:16,937
Your brother won't give a damn.

531
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:18,972
<i>Your client is a two-time loser.</i>

532
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:22,768
This case is much more
about you than him.

533
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:24,969
He has no future.

534
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:29,140
This is your first time in the spotlight.
lt's what you worked for.

535
00:39:29,483 --> 00:39:31,576
This case is a lost cause...

536
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:34,753
...so you must handle it like a lost cause.

537
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:45,087
Maybe you're right,
but the guy's not exactly Al Capone.

538
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:47,097
No, he isn't.

539
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:51,470
All they had him on was
income tax evasion. Your boy...

540
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,271
...they got on murder one.

541
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:55,971
Hi.

542
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,236
How are you?

543
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,002
Hi, Henri.

544
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:00,339
Listen.

545
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:03,607
You're not mad at me
for blowing up at you yesterday?

546
00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:05,241
Nobody talks back.

547
00:40:05,352 --> 00:40:06,910
No, l'm not mad at you.

548
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:08,487
l'll get the hang of it.

549
00:40:08,556 --> 00:40:10,023
l got a sense of humor.

550
00:40:10,124 --> 00:40:12,684
We gonna have some good times
before this is through.

551
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:15,455
You know how to play cards?
Could you get some?

552
00:40:15,963 --> 00:40:17,726
l set this up for you. Sit down.

553
00:40:17,798 --> 00:40:20,665
How much light got into the cell
you spent three years in?

554
00:40:20,734 --> 00:40:24,170
-Like when you offered me a cigarette.
-l want to get that straight.

555
00:40:24,271 --> 00:40:25,670
That was pretty good, huh?

556
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:28,741
You gotta help me if l'm going
to defend you now.

557
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:30,401
Yeah, sure, sure.

558
00:40:31,812 --> 00:40:33,245
Have a look here.

559
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:37,913
Did you kill this man here? Rufus McCain?

560
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,251
l must have. l'm here.

561
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:44,657
l don't remember it,
but everybody saw me, so, yeah.

562
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:46,985
-But you don't remember it?
-No. So what?

563
00:40:47,094 --> 00:40:48,322
Did you want to?

564
00:40:48,429 --> 00:40:51,489
Once there was this spider
that crawled over me.

565
00:40:51,765 --> 00:40:53,289
lt was like having company.

566
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,335
l looked for him again, couldn't find him.
He had a way out.

567
00:40:56,437 --> 00:40:58,701
McCain landed you in the bucket, right?

568
00:40:58,772 --> 00:41:00,899
142 times 93. Ask me that one.

569
00:41:01,008 --> 00:41:04,307
-How long after you came out--
-13,206.

570
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:08,148
13,000? You mean, days?
What are you talking about?

571
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:10,909
No, that's the answer. 142 times 93.

572
00:41:11,018 --> 00:41:14,044
-Concentrate on what l'm saying!
-l know what you're saying.

573
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:17,352
-How long was it?
-l don't know! l don't remember!

574
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:21,292
Who's the new girl l've seen in the papers?
lngrid Berger?

575
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:23,694
She's a looker. You seen her movies?

576
00:41:23,864 --> 00:41:25,297
l want you to think!

577
00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:26,924
l don't want to think!

578
00:41:27,101 --> 00:41:29,934
l spent three goddamn years in the dark...

579
00:41:30,204 --> 00:41:32,331
...smelling my own shit and piss...

580
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,269
...doing nothing but thinking!

581
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:35,842
l hate thinking!

582
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:44,375
l'm sorry, Henri.

583
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,221
l'm sorry.

584
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,560
l'm just trying to help you.

585
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,363
You got a girl, right?

586
00:41:58,832 --> 00:42:00,322
Take your jacket off.

587
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:02,563
-What?
-Let me smell it.

588
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:05,335
You were easier to understand catatonic.

589
00:42:05,406 --> 00:42:06,703
What's she like?

590
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,639
-Who?
-Your girl. That's perfume.

591
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,370
Let me smell your jacket.

592
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,070
l'll make you a deal.

593
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:17,617
l'll give my jacket, my pants,
whatever you want. Sports, girls....

594
00:42:17,685 --> 00:42:20,745
But you gotta tell me just one memory
about something l ask.

595
00:42:21,088 --> 00:42:22,146
Deal?

596
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,714
Sure.

597
00:42:31,932 --> 00:42:33,763
l've never been with a girl.

598
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:42,675
Let me try it on.

599
00:42:43,777 --> 00:42:46,245
How long was it you went
without any daylight?

600
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:49,043
<i>Did they ever let you out for any exercise?</i>

601
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,782
-Merry Christmas.
-Please, don't hit me.

602
00:42:51,952 --> 00:42:54,716
-Get the tear gas.
-How long l been in here?

603
00:42:54,888 --> 00:42:57,789
-You're out of the hole.
-l made it! l did it!

604
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:59,516
lt's Christmas, 1940.

605
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:01,752
You've been down there two years.

606
00:43:03,063 --> 00:43:04,257
Two years!

607
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:06,259
l did it.

608
00:43:07,635 --> 00:43:09,102
Two fucking years.

609
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:12,061
l made it. l made it.

610
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:14,669
l'm not too crazy, am l?

611
00:43:15,476 --> 00:43:17,273
l did it! lt's over!

612
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:19,340
Nothing's over, Henri.

613
00:43:19,446 --> 00:43:21,971
Thirty minutes exercise, that's all you get.

614
00:43:22,983 --> 00:43:23,972
No!

615
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:30,480
You don't want it, we take you back.

616
00:43:30,557 --> 00:43:31,546
No!

617
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:32,983
l want it!

618
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,490
l want it.

619
00:43:35,996 --> 00:43:38,294
l'll be good. l'll be good.

620
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,172
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury:</i>

621
00:43:49,476 --> 00:43:51,444
<i>The defendant, Henri Young...</i>

622
00:43:51,512 --> 00:43:54,481
<i>...is accused of murder in the first degree.</i>

623
00:43:54,948 --> 00:43:58,543
<i>It is your responsibility,
as a juror, to deal with truth.</i>

624
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,147
<i>Rufus McCain was murdered...</i>

625
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:03,916
<i>...by Henri Young.</i>

626
00:44:04,024 --> 00:44:05,582
<i>Mr. Stamphill...</i>

627
00:44:05,993 --> 00:44:07,324
<i>...public defender...</i>

628
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:11,353
<i>...will play upon your sympathies.
He'll use every trick in the book.</i>

629
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:12,489
<i>Why?</i>

630
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,231
<i>To avoid the gas chamber.</i>

631
00:44:15,803 --> 00:44:18,271
<i>The United States of America
will demand...</i>

632

<i>...that you return a verdict of guilty...</i>

633
00:44:20,974 --> 00:44:22,601
<i>...so that this...</i>

634
00:44:22,976 --> 00:44:24,534
<i>...this animal...</i>

635
00:44:24,712 --> 00:44:27,909
<i>...will receive the punishment
commanded by the Bible.</i>

636
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:29,842
<i>''An eye for an eye.''</i>

637
00:44:30,718 --> 00:44:32,345
<i>A life for a life.</i>

638
00:44:32,453 --> 00:44:35,422
<i>For if ever there was a man
guilty of murder...</i>

639
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,448
...it is Henri Young.

640
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,925
And if ever a man deserved
to die for that crime...

641
00:44:44,164 --> 00:44:45,961
...it is the accused.

642
00:44:49,803 --> 00:44:52,135
Thank you very much, Mr. McNeil.

643
00:44:54,908 --> 00:44:58,810
Mr. Stamphill, are you prepared
to make your opening statement?

644
00:44:59,513 --> 00:45:00,707
Your Honor...

645
00:45:01,014 --> 00:45:03,175
...ladies and gentlemen of the jury:

646
00:45:04,685 --> 00:45:08,553
When l was a kid, my heroes
weren't Babe Ruth or Lou Gehrig...

647
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,250
...they were Clarence Darrow
and Émile Zola.

648
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:14,293
ln other words, l have waited
for this moment all my life.

649
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:17,489
To stand, like l am, in front of a jury
of 12 good people...

650
00:45:17,598 --> 00:45:21,261
...to plead the case of an innocent man
who's been unjustly accused.

651
00:45:21,368 --> 00:45:23,336
The only problem is he did it.

652
00:45:24,037 --> 00:45:26,870
l know it, the prosecutor, Mr. McNeil,
knows it.

653
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,409
Henri doesn't know it 'cause he can't
remember it, but he won't deny he did it.

654
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:34,879
All those witnesses the prosecutor
will bring forth will tell you...

655
00:45:34,948 --> 00:45:37,382
...Henri Young killed Rufus McCain.

656
00:45:38,452 --> 00:45:41,888
Now that we all know that,
why don't we find the man guilty...

657
00:45:41,955 --> 00:45:45,220
...and gas him because that's
what we all know is going to happen?

658
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:46,452
Right, Henri?

659
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,527
What?

660
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:53,322
There's only one problem that'll keep us
from wrapping this up in record time.

661
00:45:53,634 --> 00:45:57,502
Henri Young did not act alone.
They haven't caught all the killers.

662
00:45:57,571 --> 00:46:02,338
There was a co-conspirator. Because of
this co-conspirator, whom we shall name...

663
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:05,409
...Henri Young is innocent
of the crime of murder.

664
00:46:05,479 --> 00:46:06,537
What?

665
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:09,115
Objection, Your Honor! l must protest!

666
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:10,716
l figured you would.

667
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:12,479
This is absurd.

668
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:16,812
Before the counselor is allowed to waste
this court's time and this jury's time...

669
00:46:16,924 --> 00:46:21,486
...l'd request that he supply some proof
or evidence of this co-conspirator.

670
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:25,959
Can you bring forward evidence
of the existence of a co-conspirator?

671
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:30,326
Not at this time, but it is my intention
to do so during the course of the trial.

672
00:46:30,437 --> 00:46:34,237
He's not going to provide such proof
because no proof exists.

673
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:37,638
This man spent three years
in solitary confinement...

674
00:46:37,845 --> 00:46:40,814
...during which time no one had
any influence over him...

675
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,509
...because no one had
any contact with him.

676
00:46:44,117 --> 00:46:47,086
He came out of solitary.
He went directly to a shower.

677
00:46:47,187 --> 00:46:51,556
Then he went directly to a haircut.
Then he went directly to the dining hall...

678
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:54,594
...where one convict had said
one sentence to him.

679
00:46:54,795 --> 00:46:57,263
This does not a co-conspirator make.

680
00:46:57,464 --> 00:47:00,365
l'm inclined to agree with the prosecution.

681
00:47:00,968 --> 00:47:03,300
Unless you can justify
that line of defense...

682
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:06,100
...l will sustain the prosecution's objection.

683
00:47:06,306 --> 00:47:10,333
The district attorney, with his own words,
has just made my case for me.

684
00:47:10,544 --> 00:47:12,011
That'll be the day.

685
00:47:12,646 --> 00:47:13,840
Your Honor...

686
00:47:14,548 --> 00:47:17,676
...for three years,
three long, tortuous years...

687
00:47:18,051 --> 00:47:21,714
...no one and nothing had any influence
whatsoever over Henri Young.

688
00:47:21,989 --> 00:47:23,513
No one and nothing.

689
00:47:23,724 --> 00:47:27,524
This was a man whose only crime was
to steal $5 from a local post office...

690
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,562
...to feed his starving sister.

691
00:47:29,663 --> 00:47:33,360
He came to Alcatraz a petty criminal
who had never harmed...

692
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:36,300
...or attempted to harm
another human being in his life.

693
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:39,931
He came out of the dungeon a vicious,
barbaric, maniacal murderer.

694
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,808
A man who had been put
into a psychological coma.

695
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:45,401
Within an hour of coming out
of that hell hole...

696
00:47:45,512 --> 00:47:48,845
...he did what would've been unthinkable
to him three years before.

697
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:50,144
Unthinkable!

698
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:53,683
His only thought was murder!
His only instinct was murder.

699
00:47:53,854 --> 00:47:55,549
His first act was murder!

700
00:47:55,689 --> 00:47:59,318
He himself was a murder weapon,
but the hand that held that weapon...

701
00:47:59,426 --> 00:48:02,987
...and plunged it into the throat of McCain
belonged to someone else.

702
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:05,360
l point to Associate Warden, Mr. Glenn...

703
00:48:05,432 --> 00:48:09,562
...Warden Humson and the institution
known as Alcatraz and say, ''l accuse! ''

704
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:12,762
-Objection!
-l accuse them individually and collectively.

705
00:48:12,873 --> 00:48:16,138
l accuse Alcatraz of the torture
of Henri Young!

706
00:48:16,443 --> 00:48:19,378
-l accuse Alcatraz of McCain's murder!
-Come to order!

707
00:48:19,446 --> 00:48:22,142
Silence! This court will come to order!

708
00:48:25,118 --> 00:48:28,178
Henri Young is not going to be
the only defendant here!

709
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:30,015
Alcatraz is on trial!

710
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,020
<i>I will address your objection
tomorrow morning!</i>

711
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,894
<i>Henri Young, on trial for his life, is seen
leaving the San Francisco courthouse...</i>

712
00:48:37,965 --> 00:48:42,231
<i>...followed by his young and now very
popular public defender, James Stamphill.</i>

713
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:46,432
<i>Stamphill has accused the infamous Rock
of torture, using the tag line...</i>

714
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,505
<i>...''crimes against humanity.''</i>

715
00:48:48,575 --> 00:48:51,908
<i>He has turned the once quiet trial
of a convict killing...</i>

716
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:53,945
<i>...into a media circus.</i>

717
00:48:54,147 --> 00:48:56,581
ln most cases, they do get better.

718
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:00,309
ln the case of Henri Young...

719
00:49:01,154 --> 00:49:03,315
...this happens not to be true.

720
00:49:03,624 --> 00:49:04,818
Young is a...

721
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:06,352
...noisemaker.

722
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,720
Some prisoners have a problem
when they're in...

723
00:49:10,998 --> 00:49:12,192
...solitary.

724
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:15,927
All we do is try to discourage misconduct.

725
00:49:17,437 --> 00:49:20,770
<i>This is the first verbal attack
on the jewel of the prison system.</i>

726
00:49:20,841 --> 00:49:24,834
<i>This bastion that houses evil
opened in 1934.</i>

727
00:49:25,445 --> 00:49:27,470
<i>It brought gangsters like Capone...</i>

728
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:32,348
<i>...Machine Gun Kelly and Henri Young
close to the magical city by the bay...</i>

729
00:49:32,686 --> 00:49:36,315
<i>...less than one half-mile
from the world-famous Fisherman's Wharf.</i>

730
00:49:36,523 --> 00:49:39,356
<i>We went to the streets
to find out public opinion.</i>

731
00:49:39,459 --> 00:49:42,485
You can't put a place on trial.
lt's a prison for prisoners.

732
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:46,225
Now the murderers are accusing
the wardens of this and that.

733
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:47,891
Doesn't make a lot of sense.

734
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:50,094
Humson seems like a good guy.

735
00:49:50,203 --> 00:49:52,467
lf Alcatraz wasn't here l wouldn't live here.

736
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:55,303
-You think it's too close?
-l think it's perfect.

737
00:49:55,475 --> 00:49:57,466
He's innocent until proven guilty.

738
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,774
He'll get a fair trial, but, nonetheless,
he's a murderer.

739
00:50:01,048 --> 00:50:03,516
<i>This grizzly evidence bears mute witness...</i>

740
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,746
<i>...to the brutal crime
perpetrated by Henri Young.</i>

741
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,810
<i>Note the spoon.</i>

742
00:50:09,322 --> 00:50:11,347
<i>Can a prison be put on trial?</i>

743
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:14,393
<i>Judge Clawson's ruling tomorrow
may clear the way...</i>

744
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:16,554
<i>...to put Alcatraz on trial.</i>

745
00:50:16,897 --> 00:50:20,663
''The warden can be relied upon
to carry out the instructions...

746
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:23,496
''...of the Bureau, that no brutality...

747
00:50:24,204 --> 00:50:26,570
''...or inhumanity shall be practiced.

748
00:50:26,907 --> 00:50:30,104
''Sustained food and medical attention
shall be given.''

749
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:33,542
We have wholeheartedly followed
those instructions.

750
00:50:33,847 --> 00:50:34,871
Thank you.

751
00:50:35,182 --> 00:50:37,377
<i>So many opinions being expressed.</i>

752
00:50:37,584 --> 00:50:40,815
<i>We attempted to get a statement
from the recent Harvard graduate...</i>

753
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:43,355
<i>...assigned to defend Henri Young.</i>

754
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,953
Why don't we keep the trial
in the courtroom? Thank you.

755
00:50:48,095 --> 00:50:51,724
l would like to address a few words
to the counsel for the defense.

756
00:50:51,865 --> 00:50:54,493
Mr. Stamphill, you are hereby
put on notice...

757
00:50:54,701 --> 00:50:57,670
...that this court has no interest
in newspaper headlines...

758
00:50:57,771 --> 00:50:59,898
...and will not be swayed by them.

759
00:51:00,674 --> 00:51:05,509
l further admonish that counsel's attempts
to try this case in the press...

760
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:09,378
...and not before this court,
will put him in the utmost peril.

761
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:13,485
ls that clear, Mr. Stamphill?

762
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,119
Yes, Your Honor.

763
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:16,513
Good.

764
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,090
Bailiff, approach the bench.

765
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:23,086
Before l hand down my ruling
on Mr. McNeil's objection...

766
00:51:23,597 --> 00:51:27,192
...l'd like to address a few words
to the counsel for the defense.

767
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,566
While l cannot give legal advice
and sit on the bench at the same time...

768
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:35,435
...l will express grave concern
with the defense's strategy.

769
00:51:36,409 --> 00:51:39,537
Counselor, l strongly recommend
you walk a straight line...

770
00:51:39,646 --> 00:51:41,375
...in terms of your defense.

771
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:46,043
Anything you state in this courtroom
will be evaluated not only by the jury...

772
00:51:46,253 --> 00:51:50,451
...but very closely scrutinized by myself.
ls that understood, Mr. Stamphill?

773
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:52,117
Yes, Your Honor.

774
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:53,685
Very well.

775
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,421
Prosecution's objection is overruled.

776
00:51:58,331 --> 00:52:00,925
You may pursue your line of defense...

777
00:52:01,168 --> 00:52:03,432
...concerning the penitentiary at Alcatraz...

778
00:52:03,503 --> 00:52:07,064
...and l will rule on any objections
on a point-by-point basis.

779
00:52:07,274 --> 00:52:08,468
Exception.

780
00:52:08,642 --> 00:52:09,666
Noted.

781
00:52:09,776 --> 00:52:12,301
Mr. McNeil, you may call
your first witness.

782
00:52:12,512 --> 00:52:14,980
Prosecution calls Terrence Swenson.

783
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:17,780
Terrence Swenson.

784
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,862
Witness shall remain standing
until sworn in.

785
00:52:31,198 --> 00:52:32,927
Put your hand on the Bible.

786
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:34,261
Cut it out.

787
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:37,336
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth...

788
00:52:37,804 --> 00:52:39,294
...so help you God?

789
00:52:39,439 --> 00:52:40,770
So help me God.

790
00:52:40,874 --> 00:52:42,307
You may be seated.

791
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:47,474
Mr. Swenson, as a guard at Alcatraz,
did you know Henri Young?

792
00:52:48,048 --> 00:52:48,776
Yes, sir.

793
00:52:48,882 --> 00:52:51,180
Could you point him out for us?

794
00:52:52,385 --> 00:52:54,444
That's him right over there, sir.

795
00:52:54,955 --> 00:52:56,582
Thank you, Mr. Whitney.

796
00:52:57,224 --> 00:52:58,122
Thank you.

797
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:01,524
Now, on the morning of June 1 1, 1941,
where were you?

798
00:53:02,162 --> 00:53:04,562
l was on duty in the dining hall.

799
00:53:04,898 --> 00:53:06,456
Everything was normal.

800
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:08,767
And l saw the defendant--

801
00:53:08,902 --> 00:53:09,960
Henri Young.

802
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:11,401
That's correct.

803
00:53:11,738 --> 00:53:13,968
l saw him standing over Rufus McCain.

804
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:16,300
He lifted up his chin and....

805
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,002
-Excuse me, l'm nervous.
-lt's all right.

806
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:21,570
And he plunged a metal object...

807
00:53:22,515 --> 00:53:24,642
...which l later learned was a spoon...

808
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:26,412
...into McCain's throat.

809
00:53:27,187 --> 00:53:28,984
He then ripped it open.

810
00:53:30,423 --> 00:53:32,857
Did the defendant ever appear
to be ranting...

811
00:53:32,926 --> 00:53:33,893
...or raving?

812
00:53:33,994 --> 00:53:35,120
No, sir.

813
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,820
Mr. McKeon, was he frothing
at the mouth?

814
00:53:38,164 --> 00:53:39,096
No, sir.

815
00:53:39,699 --> 00:53:43,157
Did he in any way give the impression
of one who was insane?

816
00:53:43,436 --> 00:53:46,564
Objection. This man is not
a qualified psychiatrist.

817
00:53:46,673 --> 00:53:47,731
Sustained.

818
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:51,900
So, it appeared to you that it was a cool,
calculated and deliberate act?

819
00:53:52,279 --> 00:53:54,008
-Objection!
-Overruled.

820
00:53:54,214 --> 00:53:56,580
The witness may answer the question.

821
00:53:56,683 --> 00:53:59,811
Yes, sir. Young did it,
just as cool as a cucumber.

822
00:54:00,086 --> 00:54:01,212
Thank you.

823
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,853
No further questions.

824
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:06,259
This court will reconvene
after the holiday...

825
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,953
...9:00 a.m., July 5.

826
00:54:08,128 --> 00:54:09,220
All rise.

827
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,661
You should have played cards with me.

828
00:54:12,232 --> 00:54:13,460
Alcatraz.

829
00:54:13,967 --> 00:54:16,936
lt was built by the military
during the Civil War.

830
00:54:18,071 --> 00:54:21,472
ln May of '33, the War Department
abandoned the island.

831
00:54:22,475 --> 00:54:26,741
lt was leveled, all except for the lower
floor which is now used for storage.

832
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,140
Note to myself:
Get access to the lower level...

833
00:54:30,283 --> 00:54:33,514
...because that's where the dungeons have
gotta be located.

834
00:54:33,653 --> 00:54:36,281
The only guard on record to be fired...

835
00:54:36,389 --> 00:54:40,018
...or dismissed during Henri's solitary time
was Derek Simpson.

836
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,050
Locate Simpson.

837
00:54:42,329 --> 00:54:45,696
The prison opened in June of '34
under Warden Humson.

838
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:49,534
He insisted on a high level
of guards to prisoners.

839
00:54:49,602 --> 00:54:51,570
Glenn was the first appointee.

840
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,466
Mr. Henkin.

841
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:57,265
Two things: First of all, you work for me.

842
00:54:57,444 --> 00:54:58,911
Let me finish!

843
00:55:00,013 --> 00:55:03,574
You work for me, which means
when l call you, you drop everything.

844
00:55:03,683 --> 00:55:06,379
Return my call or you will cease
to work for me.

845
00:55:06,686 --> 00:55:08,984
l don't care if you're with Rita Hayworth!

846
00:55:09,356 --> 00:55:10,448
Understand?

847
00:55:10,757 --> 00:55:12,190
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

848
00:55:15,295 --> 00:55:17,627
What the hell are you doing with this trial?

849
00:55:17,697 --> 00:55:18,925
Defending my client.

850
00:55:19,032 --> 00:55:21,557
Then why don't you defend him
for Christ's sake?

851
00:55:21,668 --> 00:55:24,899
Try to knock down the charges
as a crime of passion or figure out...

852
00:55:25,005 --> 00:55:27,473
...how you'll cross-examine
the witnesses...

853
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:32,170
...instead of this ''psychological coma'' crap
that doesn't mean anything in court!

854
00:55:32,379 --> 00:55:34,540
l think it does. As long as it's my case--

855
00:55:34,647 --> 00:55:39,107
Fair enough. l tried to talk reasonably
to you, but you're not going for it, so...

856
00:55:39,819 --> 00:55:42,788
...you're not handling this case anymore.
lt's done.

857
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:44,320
Mr. Henkin...

858
00:55:45,225 --> 00:55:48,956
...they're printing my opening statement
in 250 newspapers across the country.

859
00:55:49,062 --> 00:55:52,498
lf you want me off the case because
you're afraid of taking on Alcatraz...

860
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,157
...that's your choice.

861
00:55:54,234 --> 00:55:57,795
But l'll just go to Jerry Hoolihan
and tell my side of the story.

862
00:55:58,405 --> 00:56:01,966
lf you want to play hardball, sir,
l'll play hardball too.

863
00:56:07,914 --> 00:56:09,609
l'm trying to be your friend.

864
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:12,408
You know who the warden of Alcatraz is?

865
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:16,853
He's the most highly respected warden
in the US dealing with hardened criminals.

866
00:56:17,857 --> 00:56:20,485
lf you try to make Humson
look like a Nazi...

867
00:56:21,027 --> 00:56:23,222
...they will eat you for breakfast.

868
00:56:32,205 --> 00:56:35,663
You'll die if l can't get corroboration
about what goes on over there.

869
00:56:35,775 --> 00:56:38,744
l need names! Names of men
who'll come and testify.

870
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:42,273
What made you think
these men will come and testify?

871
00:56:42,382 --> 00:56:45,078
Maybe you got some friends
you don't know about.

872
00:56:45,785 --> 00:56:49,221
-You want to play cards?
-l'll make them testify with a court order!

873
00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:52,383
What about when they're back
on the Rock with Mr. Glenn?

874
00:56:52,525 --> 00:56:54,390
They'll kill them, that's what.

875
00:56:54,461 --> 00:56:57,487
This is our only chance.
We're talking about your life.

876
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:01,566
For a smart guy, you're awfully slow.
l'm already dead. l told you that.

877
00:57:01,801 --> 00:57:04,065
You can't change Alcatraz.

878
00:57:04,471 --> 00:57:05,631
lt just is.

879
00:57:05,738 --> 00:57:07,103
So why fight it?

880
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,267
You stand in court preaching. l don't
even know what you're talking about.

881
00:57:11,444 --> 00:57:13,639
Justice. l'm talking about justice.

882
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,847
l killed him, they saw it,
they're going to kill me.

883
00:57:16,916 --> 00:57:18,781
Nothing you say will change that.

884
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,343
So l don't see what you're
so excited about.

885
00:57:21,654 --> 00:57:25,488
This trial doesn't interest you at all?
You don't care about it a bit?

886
00:57:26,593 --> 00:57:29,619
You look like you're having
a good time, so....

887
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:31,922
No, l don't care.

888
00:57:32,332 --> 00:57:36,359
Main thing is, l got a friend my age
to talk to until they gas me.

889
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:41,630
l'm not your friend, l'm your attorney.
l'm trying to save your life. Guard!

890
00:57:41,941 --> 00:57:44,341
You know, l have a sister, but...

891
00:57:45,345 --> 00:57:47,870
...l ain't seen her since they put me in jail.

892
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:50,142
l got nothing. l got nobody.

893
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:53,012
l don't need a lawyer. l need a friend.

894
00:57:53,686 --> 00:57:58,214
You're doing all this to prove something
to a guy named Darryl, not for me.

895
00:57:58,858 --> 00:58:00,985
You want to do something for me?

896
00:58:01,861 --> 00:58:03,453
Let's play cards.

897
00:58:06,366 --> 00:58:08,732
Go ahead and play cards.
l got a case to try.

898
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:11,269
Hold it, Jim. Where are you going?

899
00:58:11,971 --> 00:58:13,495
Where are you going?

900
00:58:23,116 --> 00:58:26,176
<i>I'm Henri Young's attorney.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.</i>

901
00:58:26,386 --> 00:58:30,117
<i>I'm going to call prisoners to the stand
to testify about life on Alcatraz.</i>

902
00:58:30,223 --> 00:58:31,952
<i>Where are the dungeons?</i>

903
00:58:32,058 --> 00:58:34,288
<i>What is solitary time
in those dungeons like?</i>

904
00:58:34,394 --> 00:58:36,555
<i>I want the jury to know and understand.</i>

905
00:58:36,663 --> 00:58:39,632
<i>You tell them to get caught
robbing a bank. They'll find out.</i>

906
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,092
l'm done talking.

907
00:58:56,749 --> 00:58:57,807
Mr. Murphy...

908
00:58:57,917 --> 00:59:02,377
...if we can get decent treatment for you,
it makes it possible for everyone.

909
00:59:02,589 --> 00:59:07,049
lf we ignore cruelty in one place,
it makes it more acceptable everywhere.

910
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,260
l ain't gonna do shit for you.

911
00:59:09,929 --> 00:59:12,693
You can't get me no good time
knocked off.

912
00:59:12,932 --> 00:59:14,797
You can't get me no privileges.

913
00:59:14,867 --> 00:59:18,826
You can't even get me seconds at dessert.
lf l testify for anybody...

914
00:59:19,038 --> 00:59:22,166
...l testify for the DA.
He's got some juice here.

915
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:30,047
<i>Mr. Baker, could you tell me anything
about Henri Young?</i>

916
00:59:30,283 --> 00:59:31,910
Don't know Henri Young.

917
00:59:33,052 --> 00:59:35,520
Could you tell us anything
about Mr. Glenn?

918
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,881
Warden Glenn has always been
good to me.

919
00:59:42,962 --> 00:59:45,192
Have you ever been in the dungeons?

920
00:59:45,732 --> 00:59:48,132
l don't know nothing about no dungeons.

921
00:59:48,801 --> 00:59:50,234
That's all, ma'am.

922
00:59:50,637 --> 00:59:52,104
l gotta go now.

923
00:59:56,242 --> 00:59:57,470
Fuck you.

924
00:59:58,144 --> 01:00:01,045
Did Mr. Glenn tell you
not to cooperate with me?

925
01:00:01,547 --> 01:00:02,775
Fuck you.

926
01:00:02,982 --> 01:00:05,246
Where are the dungeons located?

927
01:00:05,618 --> 01:00:07,813
Don't take my fucking picture!

928
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,024
You know l can get
a writ of habeas corpus testificandum...

929
01:00:15,094 --> 01:00:17,688
...and force you to come
and testify in court?

930
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:19,058
Fuck you!

931
01:00:20,566 --> 01:00:22,761
Thank you very much for your time.

932
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,427
Don't mention it.

933
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,036
And you, sweetheart....

934
01:00:28,508 --> 01:00:30,237
l'd like to fuck you.

935
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:49,527
<i>I hope your day has been fruitful.</i>

936
01:00:50,997 --> 01:00:54,660
l don't see your photographer.
ls he still taking pictures?

937
01:00:54,867 --> 01:00:56,357
He's trying to.

938
01:00:56,936 --> 01:00:59,461
We're not receiving a great deal
of cooperation.

939
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:03,202
lt almost seems as though someone told
the prisoners not to talk to us.

940
01:01:03,309 --> 01:01:04,867
There's no conspiracy.

941
01:01:05,211 --> 01:01:06,678
No one talked to them.

942
01:01:06,779 --> 01:01:09,907
Maybe it's because they are
dangerous people who belong here...

943
01:01:10,016 --> 01:01:12,041
...with no interest in you or your case.

944
01:01:12,151 --> 01:01:15,279
-l'd like to see the dungeons.
-l'm sorry? Dungeons?

945
01:01:15,955 --> 01:01:18,219
The old citadel, the sub-level of the prison.

946
01:01:18,324 --> 01:01:20,189
That's mostly storage...

947
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,124
...a few solitary cells.

948
01:01:22,195 --> 01:01:23,093
No dungeons.

949
01:01:23,162 --> 01:01:26,393
l would like to see
the solitary-confinement cells.

950
01:01:26,566 --> 01:01:29,091
l would love to show those cells to you,
but l can't.

951
01:01:29,202 --> 01:01:33,696
lt's an insurance risk to visitors during a
riot. lf you're there, we can't protect you.

952
01:01:33,806 --> 01:01:35,535
Thank you for your concern.

953
01:01:35,975 --> 01:01:38,273
l could show you the exercise yard.

954
01:01:40,413 --> 01:01:41,778
You have papers.

955
01:01:42,215 --> 01:01:45,116
l have papers, so you can cut
the good-guy act.

956
01:01:46,486 --> 01:01:49,182
l do consider myself
as one of the good guys...

957
01:01:49,322 --> 01:01:51,517
...and perhaps more than you...

958
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,850
...l know what the bad guys are like.

959
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,019
l'd like to read them. Please.

960
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:58,456
Thank you.

961
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:01,797
That's a court order...

962
01:02:01,868 --> 01:02:05,429
<i>...instructing you to permit us access
to the solitary-confinement cells.</i>

963
01:02:05,538 --> 01:02:08,598
<i>And to allow the photographer
to take pictures of the same...</i>

964
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:11,734
<i>...to be used as exhibits in the trial
of The People vs. Young.</i>

965
01:02:11,844 --> 01:02:14,074
<i>You are also instructed
to hand over to us...</i>

966
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:17,707
<i>...the complete medical
and disciplinary files as to therein.</i>

967
01:02:18,017 --> 01:02:19,712
<i>If you refuse to do so...</i>

968
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,879
<i>...you'll have to appear in court
and show just cause.</i>

969
01:02:29,595 --> 01:02:32,155
Why don't you take Miss McCasslin
out for some air?

970
01:02:32,265 --> 01:02:34,062
l was told not to leave you alone.

971
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:38,331
l don't care. You may be used to
these conditions but obviously she's not.

972
01:02:39,272 --> 01:02:43,732
We've been searched. Take her outside,
or we'll discuss this with Mr. Glenn.

973
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,174
All right.

974
01:02:45,411 --> 01:02:46,742
No more photos.

975
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,108
You all right?

976
01:02:49,615 --> 01:02:50,604
Thanks.

977
01:02:50,817 --> 01:02:52,444
l just need some air.

978
01:03:15,641 --> 01:03:16,801
My God!

979
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:41,497
My name's James Stamphill.
l'm Henri Young's attorney.

980
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,127
l can force them to let you out
so you can testify...

981
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,205
<i>...in San Francisco in a court of law.</i>

982
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:50,333
<i>You just have to give me your name.
I promise I will do what I said for you.</i>

983
01:04:05,124 --> 01:04:07,592
James, she's okay. Just needed some air.

984
01:04:11,464 --> 01:04:12,522
Can we go now?

985
01:04:12,632 --> 01:04:14,099
Feeling any better?

986
01:04:15,468 --> 01:04:17,163
l guess l'll make it.

987
01:04:18,163 --> 01:04:28,163
