Shirley Liner. I am a pupil in
the high school.

This is my babysitter service.

3
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,067
The answer is' No '.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,358
My mother does not drink.

5
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,189
My father has never beaten me.

6
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,300
My uncle steve has never been me
precious parts show.

7
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,999
I have not even an uncle Steve.

8
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,007
The money is nice, and ...

9
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,200
Paid oral sex is no longer
humiliating than flip burgers.

10
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,078
But that's not why I do.

11
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,017
Maybe we should even decline.

12
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,115
S. A. T.

13
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,215
If you go to a university
outside this state wants,

14
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,200
then the S.A.T. 's where you are
to be sure.

15
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,800
The time to complete the test
condition at 3 hours and 45 minutes.

16
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,844
Hey, Brenda

17
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,200
Brenda

18
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:14,491

Size, I think they will reach you look.

21
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,100
Do you think he ever Nadine
has tried to suck?

22
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,600
It is not incest as the hair
Stiefbroer.

23
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,900
What? Brenda knows that her sister
a whore.

24
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,936
How many hearts she has broken?

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,650
This is your future

26
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:47,100
If you want to succeed, then studying hard.

27
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,000
Everything you're doing, determines whether
you can go on to university.

28
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,815
For how late Mr.. Beltran?

29
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,400
Have you seen my wiskundeboek?

30
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,440
Maybe in the basement?

31
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,041
Is the case nearly completed?

32
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,500
No, that score was his cousin ...

33
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
He is here!

34
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,600
How is it?

35
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,562
What is with you?

36
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,500
Shirley, where do you live again?
-- Southfield.

37
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:57,500
Oh, that's far, right?

38
00:04:59,136 --> 00:05:00,136
Oh Damn.

39
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,400
If they would write an autobiography,
you know how that would be called?

40
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,648
'Hurry you and wait for me! "

41
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,407
Want you to overcome?

42
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,659
Shirley is here.

43
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, great!

44
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,500
He is angry because he did not
should only continue.

45
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,600
Mom!

46
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,400
Mikey, what you do when there ga
Adam is an emergency?

47
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,500
How do you to the hospital?
Ga yourself with the car driving?

48
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,100
That would not be the first time

49
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:35,500
OK, but stop wijsneus.
-- Braaf, hear.

50
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,610
I see you tomorrow morning.

51
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,162
Rugged guy? Correct?

52
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,300
Paardenneukers.

53
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,300
The emergency hang on
refrigerate

54
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,600
And the restaurant?
Ok.

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,777
Have fun.
-- You, too.

56
00:06:00,744 --> 00:06:02,900
Nice.
-- Okay, here we go.

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,700
Ok, good evening
-- Please

58
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:18,200
I will tell you one thing.
If it continues to go as it goes

59
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,700
Ga I have two restaurants
open next year.

60
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,783
An in the east and
one along the river.

61
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,867
Ensure that the kamelenrijders
not to come here.

62
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,400
Jerry, komaan.

63
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,000
And if we start the company ...

64
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
Are we to you for the
Instead of Deputy Director.

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,058
That I do not know.

66
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:37,500
I do not think that I have them
can simply leave.

67
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,300
Jesus, he's just a
broken plate.

68
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,000
We have two children, Jerry

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,700
And then? We also have a child.

70
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,100
We have a child. I
you get benefits and such.

71
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,400
Yes, you have a child, we
Two courses to pay

72
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,300
Ok, And then, they can grow up,
to Michigan and death are like Mike.

73
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,862
Shirley.

74
00:07:37,972 --> 00:07:41,363
Ok, I took the idea of the restaurant
rather well, we have to consider.

75
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Deputy Director under Jerry?
-- Yes

76
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,700
Anyway, the day that a Jerry
startup company, ga me to the circus.

77
00:07:54,526 --> 00:07:57,389
You could not ask he,
You could not really leave.

78
00:07:58,738 --> 00:08:00,630
You have the right where you are,
correct?

79
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:02,812
Correct?

80
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:14,089
Hey, you see those old locomotives
over there?

81
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:16,000
Come along to watch the old trains.

82
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:17,001
Wherever you go ga?

83
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:20,697
They are just as
broken toys.

84
00:08:22,654 --> 00:08:26,068
The boys are waiting.
-- No, the boys sleep, komaan.

85
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,827
Do you think Mike goes to sleep at 9 o'clock?
You have a computer in his room put.

86
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,597
You know what he's doing?
He is online to buy heroin

87
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,921
It is a joke, it's a joke
-- It is not funny.

88
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:42,282
I know it's not funny, but
everyone in the program ...

89
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:43,434
Ok Michael, I do not want to fight.

90
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:47,706
Why do you not? If you
evil are simply say it.

91
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:51,219
It is late, let's go
Come on.

92
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,943
Just call me a bastard. It will give you better
do feel it is step 9 ...

93
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:01,371
Okay, forget it.
Step in, step.

94
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:03,908
I am a bastard,
Now I feel good.

95
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:58,615
I tried just spots of
the floor.

96
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:03,537
It is good, do not worry.

97
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:13,332
Ga then you have answers?
-- I'm sorry

98
00:10:13,674 --> 00:10:15,602
Have you eaten anything?
-- I have a cut.

99
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:20,541
I can hear stop.
-- No, it is good

100
00:10:21,144 --> 00:10:24,080
I'm okay
-- You know, I need coffee

101
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:31,587
Well, I wanted her with hunger
sent home

102
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,153
Why can not the range,
then the smoke it away.

103
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,774
I am within an hour at home?
Ok, day.

104
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:04,493
Are not you tired?
-- No, I am a nocturnal.

105
00:11:04,494 --> 00:11:07,975
I thought that I would ever outgrow.
-- That to me I thought too.

106
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:13,624
I think I should get additional pay
because you've polished my kitchen.

107
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:20,567
What? What is happening?
-- Sometimes I do stupid things.

108
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:23,989
I do not know why.
-- That I'm too.

109
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:29,435
It is ... It is stupid.

110
00:11:38,806 --> 00:11:40,743
Well, if it works.

111
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:53,143
That is good. Do you see that?
You see where I want to go?

112
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,210
No, not really.

113
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:02,851
And that is bad
-- This is bad, yes?

114
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:08,682
If there is one thing wrong, then
is there anything wrong around

115
00:12:08,683 --> 00:12:13,485
That is a domino effect,
a kettingractie.

116
00:12:19,846 --> 00:12:24,298
Everything and everyone has his place.
-- Right.

117
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:29,401
You find me a freak.
-- Oh yes.

118
00:12:32,148 --> 00:12:35,026
No, I make a joke
-- A portion of fries

119
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:07,018
How did you meet your wife?
-- What?

120
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:12,106
What?
-- I mean 'Why'?

121
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:24,886
Ok, I met her just outside
Ann Harbour, there is this bridge ...

122
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:27,345
... with a river below and
a treinspoor that it runs.

123
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:35,277
And it's pitch dark.
Oddly, I do not know why I tell you this.

124
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:39,984
And that's what the young people go
to be high.

125
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:45,175
And on an evening takes me Jerry.
-- The man was where you out tonight?

126
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,995
And we went just to see how
it was.

127
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:48,996
Really do.

128
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:56,880
Anyway, we are there and a small
feestmeid comes at me.

129
00:13:57,908 --> 00:13:59,179
And that appears to Gail.

130
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,841
And she had a massive dose ...

131
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:09,754
Anyway, while viewing it with headless
to toe.

132
00:14:10,054 --> 00:14:15,313
And then she turns to Jerry and says:
What do you do for me included?

133
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:22,429
I do not know, you had to be there
-- I wish I was there.

134
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:26,091
And when?

135
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:33,647
We will go to her friends and I say to
Jerry: That girl looks like problems.

136
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:41,932
Crazy how people change.

137
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:47,229
Do you have a boyfriend?

138
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:56,225
What? Come on. You're smart, mature,
you are undoubtedly clever.

139
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:29,995
Want to see something cool?

140
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:34,891
Ok.

141
00:16:43,463 --> 00:16:44,381
Walk!

142
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:30,139
I'm sorry.

143
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:26,083
You know, we can not do this.
We can not do this.

144
00:18:28,222 --> 00:18:30,599
You know what I mean, I have children.
-- Yes

145
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:49,568
Thanks to the children.

146
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:13,674
HPV, Herpes, Syphilis, Gonorroe

147
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:18,599
Ladies and Gentlemen, The numbers show
Seeing

148
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:23,396
The study returns it
Americans want a car.

149
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,717
A beautiful car, which we their
can sell.

150
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:31,391
A car with clutch, horsepower
By how much horsepower?

151
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:35,071
An Entire hope, George

It is my car
-- I bring him back

155
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:47,772
You do not even have a driving licence
-- To you that I will destroy him?

156
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:50,521
Yes.
-- I'm a better driver than you

157
00:20:50,522 --> 00:20:53,180
No, you're not, you have the car
Ally of destroyed.

158
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:55,635
And you have those of your mother
without gasoline dropped

159
00:20:56,449 --> 00:20:58,071
You are three times failed the
roadworthiness testing.

160
00:20:58,072 --> 00:20:59,664
That is because the instructor
hated me.

161
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:01,535
No, because you have a bad
drivers are

162
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:03,316
I can be arrested.

163
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,721
Val death, dikzak

164
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:09,239
... round and in the vagina.

165
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,513
He tells me that they are just friends

166
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:13,565
but why he takes her only agree to
the ball and not in a group?

167
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:15,460
Jesus, Brenda, ask him anyway.

168
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:17,438
But girls told not to ask

169
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:23,645
Well, then alone, stay home and pitch
you full of dieetpillen, I've had enough of

170
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:27,572
Why you trap me?
-- Friends remain okay?

171
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:30,225
It does not matter how many defensive
or aanvalspunten he has.

172
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:33,216
No you simply submit it on the table
-- That's it?

173
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:38,445
Baseballkaarten are a lot easier.
Do you have a brownie?

174
00:21:38,777 --> 00:21:39,446
Er. An ice cream

175
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,463
Ok, what you want, you've
good points, right?

176
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:01,982
Shirley, hello, you come here?
that is so cute

177
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:03,042
Sometimes

178
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:13,523
I was still calling you, I do not like the vague
but can you Thursday babysitting?

179
00:22:13,524 --> 00:22:17,724
I know it's a schoolavond.
Maybe you can use the bathroom polishing?

180
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:21,984
Grapje,
Thursday is good do you think?

181
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:51,530
Is it?

182
00:22:58,639 --> 00:22:59,852
Come you vanboven

183
00:23:22,745 --> 00:23:24,525
No, wait, wait

184
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:37,300
You have a mess of it.
-- 'We'

185
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:50,951
Ruik you know?

186
00:23:54,796 --> 00:23:56,652
It is challenging the lentelucht

187
00:24:00,158 --> 00:24:02,026
That is my favorite scent.

188
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:12,643
Excuse me, I must go

189
00:24:17,146 --> 00:24:18,392
It is in order, right?

190
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:29,613
Yes, yes, thanks

191
00:25:36,795 --> 00:25:43,255
Do you have extra vigilant to the duodenum
not to punch?

192
00:25:44,065 --> 00:25:47,243
If you do not know where the doudenum,
Consult your book.

193
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:51,034
a perforated duodenum is not
picnic

194
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,583
What? What is happening?
-- Nothing

195
00:25:58,584 --> 00:26:01,427
Yes.
-- No, it was late yesterday

196
00:26:02,172 --> 00:26:04,254
Do you like the small etter
books?

197
00:26:05,862 --> 00:26:07,931
Yes.
-- Have you earned money?

198
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:10,574
Yes.
-- How much?

199
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:13,027
200 Dollar

200
00:26:14,851 --> 00:26:18,271
Jesus, Shirley,
Have you Mr.. Beltran gepijpt?

201
00:26:23,914 --> 00:26:25,757
I can not believe that you do not
've called

202
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:27,276
I have called you when I get my
menstruation got.

203
00:26:27,277 --> 00:26:30,531
And when I change my virginity
lost to camp I go to your room demolition

204
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:32,740
Shit, I even when I called my first
lost a tooth.

205
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:35,656
And this is not a tooth Shirley.
There is something happened between you.

206
00:26:35,657 --> 00:26:39,157
Listen to me, nothing has happened
he has a family, children, a job

207
00:26:39,158 --> 00:26:41,116
I have me worried
to the university

208
00:26:41,117 --> 00:26:42,438
You have a way needed
to the university to pay

209
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:46,471
You do not know where you are talking about it.
There is one thing which I regret to have

210
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:50,376
Is not it crazy sorry to have something
that is not gebeud ... according to you anyway

211
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:08,333
Non-stop, non stop.

212
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,463
For you I've paid ...

213
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:14,915
it was ...

214
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:17,966
I mean, it had ... euhm ...

215
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:24,668
I do not know ... a game could be ...
I do not know what I thought

216
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:32,428
I thought that you seemed unhappy after
I suppose you had paid.

217
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:35,465
Well said, idiot.

218
00:27:37,431 --> 00:27:38,329
I do not know

219
00:27:42,358 --> 00:27:43,947
I mean, you've said nothing

220
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,425
Mostly not

221
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,658
That's just how it works

222
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,424
Size, you may say against anyone
That may not

223
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:23,780
Tell against anyone
No, I'm seriously

224
00:28:23,781 --> 00:28:27,682
Tell even to Tina
-- Tina? Shit? Why do you think?

225
00:28:28,252 --> 00:28:30,038
I do not know, it's your wife

226
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:33,925
Believe me, there is much I do not what to tell Tina
and that is just as conversely

227
00:28:34,437 --> 00:28:36,763
God knows where she has been
I do not want it ...

228
00:28:37,642 --> 00:28:42,093
Ignorance is beatitude
Why do you think our marriage is running so well?

229
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:45,802
I do not know. Maybe you by Ga
your mid-life crisis

230
00:28:45,803 --> 00:28:47,590
But you're always been so stupid

231
00:28:48,384 --> 00:28:52,709
You fucks the babysitter and I ga
by my mid-life ...

232
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,824
You have to stand in my shoes to know
what I encounter

233
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,364
My friend asks if you know someone who wants
babysitting ... on him ...

234
00:29:10,773 --> 00:29:12,712
He says he gladly pays

235
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:18,385
Yes

236
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:20,843
Yes I know someone

237
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:29,988
Bring her home

238
00:29:33,491 --> 00:29:34,725
I Ga you eat

239
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:46,726
I ga her to bring home

240
00:29:49,635 --> 00:29:51,484
What is your favorite subject?

241
00:30:11,368 --> 00:30:13,810
Hey
-- Are we going to hell?

242
00:30:14,302 --> 00:30:15,286
Yep

243
00:30:16,132 --> 00:30:17,317
I knew the

244
00:30:18,455 --> 00:30:19,381
I must go

245
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:24,205
Doug, every day at home

246
00:30:24,206 --> 00:30:26,144
And, I mean, I know he has friends
with my Stiefbroer

247
00:30:26,145 --> 00:30:30,508
but komaan, Scott is not that cool
and he is always there when I'm watching TV

248
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:32,213
So I think he sees me.

249
00:30:32,904 --> 00:30:33,627
I'm back

250
00:30:34,882 --> 00:30:36,064
What's that? Is that new?

251
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:38,153
He is a freak

252
00:30:40,561 --> 00:30:43,287
He wore a cowboy outfit and he
had a moustache

253
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,454
Was he friendly?

254
00:30:46,408 --> 00:30:47,904
I need coffee
-- Melissa?

255
00:30:50,347 --> 00:30:54,763
I was thinking ...
Since I've scheduled

256
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:03,749
I was thinking that I might
a portion of the money could get

257
00:31:05,857 --> 00:31:07,059
Thus a 40 dollar

258
00:31:10,755 --> 00:31:12,291
That seems to me fair

259
00:31:15,037 --> 00:31:15,899
Yes that's right

260
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:25,257
20%
Thanks Shirley

261
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:35,882
Oh my god, this is not great?

262
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:39,949
Yeah, a lot of fun with all the kots to
to overcome your parents come home

263
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,678
What?
-- It is totally amazing

264
00:31:43,888 --> 00:31:46,070
Shirley, we need to talk with Doug

265
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:48,054
Ok

266
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:52,545
Hey
-- Hey

267
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,586
Hey
-- Hey

268
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:57,076
I have a friend for what weed

269
00:31:57,922 --> 00:31:58,689
Interested?

270
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:00,239
it is amazing

271
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,753
I do not really ...
-- Natural

272
00:32:03,785 --> 00:32:06,884
Erm Shirley, if you later a lift
to house searches, can I bring you

273
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:07,748
If you have a need

274
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:13,998
I'm with Melissa came just ...
maybe yes ...

275
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:37,374
I must kotsen.

276
00:32:48,021 --> 00:32:48,464
What about it?

277
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:50,930
I've had phone calls from two
of Jerry's friends.

278
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:54,354
That's great!
-- Great? That is not great!

279
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:57,338
Jerry could not keep his mouth, we
go to prison

280
00:32:57,339 --> 00:33:02,118
We are minor, a few hours compulsory
guidance and we are there from

281
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:08,499
Wives, parents, children.
-- Ensure all for themselves

282
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:14,413
They always believe that their men from them,
their daughters are virgin

283
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:19,497
and their sons no pijpbommen in the basement
because they go there to death if they believe something else

284
00:33:20,992 --> 00:33:23,665
They are the ones who make it so easy
to get away to come here

285
00:33:24,027 --> 00:33:26,613
They want both Thursday
-- I have Jerry Thursday

286
00:33:26,614 --> 00:33:27,614
That I know

287
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:29,878
Can you take one of them?

288
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:36,765
Then there is still without a date

289
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:39,416
Find someone else to baby-sitting

290
00:33:40,355 --> 00:33:42,976
Jesus, Melissa
-- You know what the pimps say:

291
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:46,087
I have no whore of it
She was already a whore.

292
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,408
That's great, where did you hear that?

293
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:50,699
Wait, I get more beer

294
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,255
And then ... Who's the whore?

295
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:08,301
Oh yes, that's clever

296
00:34:11,941 --> 00:34:15,658
No, no, they would never ...
-- They do not.

297
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,029
But let her take that decision

298
00:34:20,446 --> 00:34:23,911
For once in her life. Let her
a decision on something

299
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,388
Do you want me to row?

300
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,758
Hey

301
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:45,995
Ga you go?
-- Yes I am waiting for Melissa

302
00:34:51,078 --> 00:34:53,347
Are you cold? Do you want my ...
-- No.

303
00:34:54,037 --> 00:34:55,229
Certainly?
-- Thanks

304
00:34:58,582 --> 00:35:02,872
Excuse me ...
-- No Problem

305
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,305
It seems always kissing or better in the cold

306
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:24,586
Oops

307
00:35:28,298 --> 00:35:30,174
Ok er ... Nice hotels

308
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,192
Nice hotels

309
00:35:55,955 --> 00:35:58,027
I crept out
-- Rebel

310
00:35:58,028 --> 00:35:59,528
I am a rebel

311
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:16,008
Treasure?

312
00:36:20,063 --> 00:36:22,688
Your mother says you've Peroxide?

313
00:36:30,491 --> 00:36:31,834
How was it ...
-- Good

314
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:33,724
Was there a lot of people?
-- Yes

315
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:43,169
Er ... The step of your girlfriend ...
-- Scott

316
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:48,916
Yes, he has to call you ... So ...
you go along?

317
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:51,175
Where?

318
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:53,402
Er no, are you two ...
-- No.

319
00:36:56,178 --> 00:37:02,411
Indeed, he seems a nice boy

320
00:37:02,412 --> 00:37:06,485
I mean, cool, he looks cool

321
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:11,279
Big.
-- Pap I'm tired

322
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:18,496
Thus ... I see you tomorrow
-- Slaapwel

323
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,134
Are the children calm?

324
00:38:02,475 --> 00:38:03,126
Where are we?

325
00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:05,026
A friend of mine has lived here

326
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:11,312
If we stay in the car or do we
in the grass?

327
00:38:11,853 --> 00:38:12,555
What?

328
00:38:14,851 --> 00:38:16,168
Come on, no games

329
00:38:16,974 --> 00:38:18,137
Stop astublieft

330
00:38:20,321 --> 00:38:24,611
You ... Wait, Shirley said that one of you
they were ...

331
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:26,662
one of their what?

332
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,290
Oh Shit

333
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:36,826
Er ... I knew that everything would go wrong
I knew the

334
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:38,892
This did not happen

335
00:39:00,564 --> 00:39:01,500
Jesus

336
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:11,432
Brenda, if you go home, I want you
take a picture of yourself

337
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:16,670
Because now you perfection ...

338
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:26,444
And I want you to that picture every day
look, and never change

339
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:32,089
Erm ... Ok

340
00:39:38,302 --> 00:39:40,039
We have nothing to do

341
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,892
You can talk, I can listen

342
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:19,819
Hello?
-- How is it?

343
00:40:20,103 --> 00:40:22,295
I'm on the babysitting
-- For whom?

344
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:24,678
Listen, I'm doing now ...

345
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:27,459
Shirley, since when babysitting your ...
-- Excuse

346
00:40:29,537 --> 00:40:33,023
I must go.
-- Shirley, Shirley ... Auw!

347
00:40:33,513 --> 00:40:34,129
Is it?

348
00:40:34,976 --> 00:40:35,992
Yes, I'm fine.

349
00:40:37,597 --> 00:40:38,841
I'm gestruikeld, I'm so awkward

350
00:40:40,134 --> 00:40:42,068
Can we get started? It is late

351
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:10,440
How long already?
-- Nearly a month now.

352
00:41:11,795 --> 00:41:13,592
You do differently lately.

353
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:24,622
You do not need to do what you do not want
-- That does not make good what you've done

354
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,124
Who?

355
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:32,810
Who has a babysitter?

356
00:42:02,962 --> 00:42:05,168
Shirley Hey, I want a kitten Order

357
00:42:05,973 --> 00:42:09,599
If you do not say on the phone?
Melissa?

358
00:42:12,027 --> 00:42:16,854
I want a babysitter in order to
my offspring to watch.

359
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:18,187
That is better

360
00:42:18,707 --> 00:42:19,635
Make sure she has big tits.

361
00:42:54,708 --> 00:43:01,543
No, they have a new way to share
We no longer have the brackets.

362
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:03,423
They do no more long divisions

363
00:43:04,162 --> 00:43:07,274
and Bailey is the only one in which these kindergarten
"After the division."

364
00:43:07,275 --> 00:43:10,450
So we had to a conference with
other parents with gifted children

365
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:14,126
It was interesting how they taught us to
their small brains to stimulate

366
00:43:14,919 --> 00:43:16,590
Using them now not all
calculators?

367
00:43:16,591 --> 00:43:18,456
Bailey's teacher says that he
no need

368
00:43:18,626 --> 00:43:22,177
The other day we were watching TV
and he turned around and says:

369
00:43:22,626 --> 00:43:24,587
Mama, I should study.

370
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:26,527
Can you imagine the proposals?

371
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:29,537
He is still a child

372
00:43:32,474 --> 00:43:35,214
I saw what you did on the Mustang
bill.

373
00:43:35,215 --> 00:43:36,169
And what do you think?

374
00:43:37,296 --> 00:43:38,724
Not determined your best work.

375
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:44,846
If you have suggestions ...
-- It seemed more like a crude version

376
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:47,542
Especially because it's yours.

377
00:43:48,933 --> 00:43:50,436
Is there anything on?

378
00:43:53,114 --> 00:43:58,357
There is nothing in your hand. Nothing.
I do not know. I thought it was good

379
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:01,827
And if you think that there is work to
is that so, what can I do about it?

380
00:44:01,828 --> 00:44:04,252
Have you heard? We have
same babysitter

381
00:44:04,253 --> 00:44:05,893
Really?
-- Yes Shirley

382
00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:08,843
But sometimes Shirley, sometimes the other
girls

383
00:44:08,844 --> 00:44:10,641
She has a whole bunch of girls
who works for her.

384
00:44:10,642 --> 00:44:13,384
Really?
-- Let him the ticket.

385
00:44:18,161 --> 00:44:19,933
My god, look!

386
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:22,642
She is very enterprising

387
00:44:35,095 --> 00:44:36,715
I've seen the ticket

388
00:44:41,162 --> 00:44:41,974
Yes.

389
00:44:43,151 --> 00:44:44,807
Sooner or later there will be someone behind.

390
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:00,612
You're right.
-- About what?

391
00:45:01,595 --> 00:45:04,899
There you call so many men that women
suspicious.

392
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:09,431
Keep it there and then just ...
-- Dollar 200?

393
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,829
Look at the risk, look at
the reward.

394
00:45:14,742 --> 00:45:15,509
Look at me.

395
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,988
Ga back in your car!

396
00:45:20,223 --> 00:45:20,960
Let me reassure!

397
00:45:21,694 --> 00:45:23,998
You have those tickets.
Is that what you want to do? Do you want this?

398
00:45:24,129 --> 00:45:25,515
I thought that it went to us

399
00:45:25,618 --> 00:45:27,594
Would you not? Pay
there was no longer!

400
00:45:28,127 --> 00:45:33,333
I stood here! You got that money from you
bag and you gave it to me!

401
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:35,117
So I do not try to blame
do feel.

402
00:45:35,118 --> 00:45:37,084
You have not by how far you
it is, do you?

403
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,094
You risk everything! Teenagers!
-- I wish they did not

404
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:45,290
Pap Hello!
-- Hello

405
00:45:50,222 --> 00:45:55,062
The price goes up.
300 Dollar from now.

406
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:30,353
Are you here for one reason or
just boring to do?

407
00:46:30,513 --> 00:46:32,125
Do you look nice?

408
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,401
Where have you met?
-- Summerset

409
00:46:38,178 --> 00:46:40,521
Do you ever borrow?
-- It is probably too big for me.

410
00:46:43,116 --> 00:46:44,084
They have also in black.

411
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:46,402
Dad says that I do not get more money
until I get better points at school.

412
00:46:49,727 --> 00:46:51,227
I can help you with money.

413
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:01,737
Hello
-- Brenda

414
00:47:02,418 --> 00:47:04,970
I have the pressure tonight so it is
Nadine well as babysitting?

415
00:47:12,851 --> 00:47:13,899
Can I get you alletwee?

416
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,800
It is not good, but ga.

417
00:47:31,283 --> 00:47:33,475
Great ... 7 hours ...

418
00:47:33,758 --> 00:47:34,658
Brenda!

419
00:47:34,659 --> 00:47:36,104
Ok, I have to go, day boys

420
00:47:39,074 --> 00:47:40,148
Hey.
-- What is happening?

421
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:41,739
Where were you during lunch?

422
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,371
I was in the chill with
those handsome guests.

423
00:47:46,903 --> 00:47:48,198
Got my 20%?

424
00:47:49,694 --> 00:47:51,861
I'm not gone?
-- What?

425
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,911
Jesus
-- He gave no!

426
00:47:57,105 --> 00:47:58,060
That is ...
-- It is OK

427
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:04,575
Got my 20%?

428
00:48:04,934 --> 00:48:06,990
We can help you with the mathematics.
-- Keep your mouth

429
00:48:08,943 --> 00:48:11,315
Why should I pay you anything?
I have this guy fucked.

430
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:13,878
Nadine's how it works.

431
00:48:14,385 --> 00:48:17,313
I make appointments, I care
there that everything is in order.

432
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:19,410
I get a percentage of what
you deserve

433
00:48:26,202 --> 00:48:27,355
It is 60.

434
00:48:36,804 --> 00:48:39,991
Should I encourage you to schedule the Video
or was it for once?

435
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:41,282
I'm still sometimes

436
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,046
Do not you bus

437
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:52,638
Hello?

438
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:55,503
George, it's Nadine
You know me still.

439
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:00,213
Some friends also want babysitting

440
00:49:00,214 --> 00:49:02,425
I've actually been something
Shirley governed

441
00:49:02,426 --> 00:49:05,011
George, Shirley's friends
not at all like these girls.

442
00:49:06,656 --> 00:49:09,139
And George, let this
between our two keep

443
00:49:10,522 --> 00:49:12,865
Oh, watch out for your head
Sorry, oh God.

444
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:24,593
Slowly, slowly, ok? 

445
00:49:41,157 --> 00:49:42,818
I've only had 2 phone calls
Last week

446
00:49:42,819 --> 00:49:45,361
I tell you: it is Nadine.

447
00:49:49,113 --> 00:49:51,042
Brenda!
-- Hello

448
00:49:51,997 --> 00:49:53,041
Come here.

449
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:56,545
What is happening?

450
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:02,381
Does Nadine other things?
-- No.

451
00:50:02,771 --> 00:50:04,766
I do not think so ... No
-- Are you sure?

452
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:05,767
I do not think

453
00:50:06,525 --> 00:50:08,133
Can you find out?
-- How?

454
00:50:09,902 --> 00:50:11,166
Look at home was around.

455
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:14,274
Can you do that?
-- Yes, yes, no problem

456
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:17,880
Thank you!

457
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:22,274
She is lying

458
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:37,948
No additional money or phone numbers?
-- No, nothing of that

459
00:50:39,499 --> 00:50:41,913
And its box?
-- Her box?

460
00:50:42,845 --> 00:50:46,005
Erm ... I do not think so, no.

461
00:50:46,735 --> 00:50:47,463
Have you looked?

462
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:48,962
I've had a couple days ago
still looking.

463
00:50:50,067 --> 00:50:52,427
Ok, Thank you Brenda

464
00:50:53,943 --> 00:50:55,447
Everything OK?
-- Yes

465
00:50:55,448 --> 00:50:56,448
Are you sure, because ...

466
00:51:18,297 --> 00:51:20,362
What do you do?
-- Allow simply lookout!

467
00:51:20,363 --> 00:51:22,884
On the lookout for what?
-- We are losing time

468
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:26,686
Shirley, komaan, Shirley
-- I have said that we had to call Jerry

469
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:29,499
Shirley!

470
00:51:31,806 --> 00:51:34,847
I said it ...
-- This is burglary, komaan, we go ...

471
00:51:34,848 --> 00:51:35,781
We are now al

472
00:51:35,782 --> 00:51:38,927
There is nothing broken
-- It's not true, it is simply not true.

473
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,683
Michael has a moral crisis.

474
00:51:50,464 --> 00:51:52,240

A meeting

You can not take any money from my pocket.

And you do not run around in an outfit
Dollar, 1200

Oh, it's dinnertime.

00:57:02,274 --> 00:57:05,551
Jerry Hey, look at all these beasts

518
00:57:25,045 --> 00:57:28,192
Hello, are you nervous?

519
00:57:29,462 --> 00:57:30,890
You need not be nervous

520
00:58:19,441 --> 00:58:22,371
Hey, stand up

521
00:58:22,577 --> 00:58:23,475

It is my ... Medication

524
00:58:33,825 --> 00:58:34,861
What is happening?

525
00:58:35,082 --> 00:58:37,333
Oh, that stain, it seems as if
you have in your pants geplast

526
00:58:40,464 --> 00:58:44,951
Have you ever ... something done with
that other girls?

527
00:58:51,272 --> 00:58:56,100
You know who's really ...
really special?

528
00:58:57,218 --> 00:58:58,203
Brenda

529
00:59:00,733 --> 00:59:03,493
Every time I get her, give
I need a little extra tip

530
00:59:03,494 --> 00:59:04,240
because ...

531

It is not as if they were something ...
exceptionally ... game does

Nothing so what I can tell ...

533
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:23,195
It is more ...

534
00:59:25,597 --> 00:59:27,908
You know, it's just so
Young and stupid

535
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:32,086
She has no idea what
they get from us, no idea

536
00:59:33,509 --> 00:59:40,455
Monday she looks back and thinks they:
wow, that was really something special

537
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:43,559
It is something special, man

538
00:59:46,564 --> 00:59:47,860
I do not know

539
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:51,994
We are the best thing these girls
will ever overcome.

540
00:59:55,295 --> 01:00:00,954
Jesus, Erm ... Nadine ... You are ...

541
01:00:10,451 --> 01:00:13,514
Stupid old people, thinking that X
makes you horny

542
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:22,833
It is ... it is exonerating

543
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:16,240
No, that's not good

544
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:29,648
Got water?

545
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:45,275
Hey, come here, come here

01:02:52,008 --> 01:02:52,924
I am here inside.

547
01:02:53,682 --> 01:02:56,082
Brenda, is everything okay?
-- Yes

548
01:02:56,083 --> 01:02:57,099

There you are.

551
01:03:05,023 --> 01:03:06,736
What is happening?
-- I want the stops.

552
01:03:08,991 --> 01:03:13,479
Have you taken too much?
-- I do not know, but not much

553
01:03:15,864 --> 01:03:20,471
Come here, I try to calm down
since I was always very good at

554
01:03:20,646 --> 01:03:23,358
Yes?
-- Yes, what you want to do ...

555
01:03:24,306 --> 01:03:26,510
You're really ... sweaty.

556
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:31,829
Just ... Look at ... not look at me
Look at yourself, look in your eyes

557
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:34,650
Concentrate on your eyes

558
01:03:36,028 --> 01:03:37,052
What is happening?

559
01:03:41,332 --> 01:03:44,318
What is happening?
-- I do not like to see myself

560
01:03:46,443 --> 01:03:50,443
What are you talking about?

561
01:03:51,801 --> 01:03:55,601
My god, look at those eyes

562
01:03:56,948 --> 01:04:03,470
Beautiful, beautiful eyes, they are green
with small blue dots

563
01:04:03,738 --> 01:04:04,866
Stop

564
01:04:05,549 --> 01:04:09,219
I can do anything about it
-- I do not know, I feel sick

565
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,395
I have taken too much

566
01:04:13,035 --> 01:04:13,835
I make it better

567
01:04:14,891 --> 01:04:16,503
No, no, I ga vomiting

Okay ...

01:05:07,031 --> 01:05:08,151
Fuck!

586
01:05:17,228 --> 01:05:18,547
That is not worth the damned

587
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:47,400
Boys, it's time to go to
go to bed

Come on boys, touch me not to, ok!
Touch me not to

Come on boys, we go to bed, ok?

01:06:17,526 --> 01:06:20,344
Brenda, what ...
-- Driving! Ride!

596
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:28,757
Brenda
-- Who stores with doors?

597
01:06:29,674 --> 01:06:31,849
She was in the babysitting and they
called me hysterical on

598
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,788
Should I call you Mom?
-- No.

599
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,072
I'm sorry
-- What happened?

600
01:06:49,646 --> 01:06:50,865
I can not ...
-- It is okay

601
01:06:51,277 --> 01:06:54,177
This is me not ...
-- I can not ... Brenda

602
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:55,804
I can not do more

603
01:06:55,805 --> 01:06:58,693
I ga for you and I do these things
with strangers

604
01:06:58,694 --> 01:07:01,177
And then I come home and I have that
stuff from my hair washing

605
01:07:02,163 --> 01:07:03,105
I can not do more

606
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:07,284
Listen to me Brenda, if you look

607
01:07:08,145 --> 01:07:10,433
But be silent!

608
01:07:12,788 --> 01:07:14,052
Familieproblemen

609
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:16,187
Yes, really ...

610
01:07:17,294 --> 01:07:18,311
I must go

611
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:37,953
I'm allowed

612
01:07:39,891 --> 01:07:42,241
I graduated a year earlier,
I am ready in June

613
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:45,152
Leave me?
-- Brenda You can not let go

614
01:07:47,049 --> 01:07:48,744
They will tell everyone

615
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,749
Are you afraid that the university
no permits whores?

616
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:54,996
She herself does not indicate
if they are in the club's

617
01:07:55,804 --> 01:07:57,463
Verknoei not, Shirley

618
01:07:58,192 --> 01:07:59,873
We have worked too hard

619

Ga go home, you have a test tomorrow.

620
01:08:22,059 --> 01:08:24,383
On the side, on the side ...
-- Do not hurt him

621
01:08:29,145 --> 01:08:32,505
Tell your sister that she should remain silent
whether we address it to

622
01:08:32,996 --> 01:08:34,148
Leave her alone damned

623
01:08:41,593 --> 01:08:43,573
Oh my god, what happened?

624
01:08:43,574 --> 01:08:44,532

I've fought
-- With whom?

625
01:08:44,533 --> 01:08:46,418
There is nothing happened
-- Scott, who has done this?

626
01:08:47,713 --> 01:08:48,833
Have you seen my thing?

627
01:09:12,834 --> 01:09:14,771
What have you done?
-- What is your problem?

628
01:09:14,772 --> 01:09:16,685
Talk not to me as if I
am an idiot

629
01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:18,674
You're crazy to be

I did it, so you this
can keep rotating

633
01:09:26,441 --> 01:09:29,375
In a few months, I'm away
Who is your help?

634
01:09:31,044 --> 01:09:33,592
You control
-- Not about you

635
01:09:33,593 --> 01:09:37,537
This has always been your game
I just played it

636
01:09:50,098 --> 01:09:51,386
Hey what are you doing home so early?

637
01:09:52,448 --> 01:09:54,046
Mikey's director called

638
01:09:54,753 --> 01:09:58,067
Mikey told his teacher for his kl ...
a pillow.

639
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:00,412
What did he ...?
-- That is not funny

640
01:10:00,413 --> 01:10:03,818
Your son laughs, and he is
not even twelve?

641
01:10:04,786 --> 01:10:06,594
I can not believe it
-- Why are you home?

642
01:10:07,981 --> 01:10:09,667
I am of the mustang-taking
met

643
01:10:12,877 --> 01:10:13,914
Are you fired?

644
01:10:13,915 --> 01:10:17,561
No, I'm not relieved, but
taking a minor move

645
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:19,650
In other words, a demotie?

646
01:10:19,651 --> 01:10:24,275
No it's not demotie. George thinks
just that I'm better somewhere else

647
01:10:24,276 --> 01:10:28,054
Have you told what happened?
-- Hold on, hold on

648
01:10:28,055 --> 01:10:30,532
You work so hard you can
-- I am a mature man ...

649
01:10:30,533 --> 01:10:33,117
... and I can fight my own
and that I have done?

650
01:10:33,118 --> 01:10:35,264
And so it is ..
-- It is everything we worked for!

651
01:10:35,265 --> 01:10:37,105
What do you want? How much do you want?

652
01:10:37,106 --> 01:10:39,098
What makes you happy?
We have the

653
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,138
How much security do you have?
-- Oh my God

654
01:10:42,139 --> 01:10:45,191
What?
-- I can not have this conversation now

655
01:10:45,192 --> 01:10:46,142
I'm sorry

656
01:10:47,689 --> 01:10:50,885
That is good, walk away,
every time, every time

657
01:10:50,886 --> 01:10:51,886
Each time

658
01:10:51,887 --> 01:10:54,471
If you have a problem with me?
Tell me

659
01:10:54,642 --> 01:10:56,982
If I do something wrong ...
Tell me

660
01:10:56,983 --> 01:10:59,885
I would not have to tell you that.
I am not your conscience

661
01:11:02,205 --> 01:11:04,369
Why do not you ga to top
talk with your son?

662
01:11:05,643 --> 01:11:07,315
I Ga to the vrijdagsvergadering

663
01:11:08,009 --> 01:11:11,225
What do you mean?
we had plans

664
01:11:11,226 --> 01:11:13,119
Yes, plans change

665
01:11:23,139 --> 01:11:24,303
Hey champion.

666
01:11:28,277 --> 01:11:31,854
Okay, what is the name of that teacher?

667
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:33,270
Mr. Lebette

668
01:11:36,415 --> 01:11:38,263
Size, you can not just
people press

669
01:11:38,264 --> 01:11:39,264
I have already heard mama

670
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:42,200
I know how you feel,
I know how you feel

671
01:11:42,201 --> 01:11:45,947
I am also angry, I become angry at
my boss, because he never listens

672
01:11:45,948 --> 01:11:51,122
and he has these rules he imposes
because he says what people want to do

673
01:11:52,445 --> 01:11:53,237
Why?

674
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:03,477
I would have him say that he
kloten can kiss my

675
01:12:04,672 --> 01:12:06,494
I must tell him that he
his kloten can cushion

676
01:12:06,495 --> 01:12:07,943
That's what I'm supposed to do

677
01:12:09,532 --> 01:12:11,004
Are you hungry?
-- Yes

678
01:12:11,005 --> 01:12:12,205
What do you think of a large pizza?
-- Okay

679
01:12:12,839 --> 01:12:15,613
You know where the issue lies?
-- In the big slide

680
01:12:15,614 --> 01:12:19,337
That's right, order two large pizzas,
no olives, and also question Adam

681
01:12:19,338 --> 01:12:20,687
And do not forget him tip to give

682
01:12:21,866 --> 01:12:23,138
Ga Where you going?

683
01:12:26,188 --> 01:12:27,717
Do you not to be Adam?

684
01:12:28,498 --> 01:12:31,826
Not at all
-- Thanks, and he no olives

685
01:12:32,454 --> 01:12:34,806
And this, this is for you

686
01:12:39,967 --> 01:12:43,190
What? You have this arrangement already weeks!

687
01:12:43,908 --> 01:12:48,396
Shirley Sorry, but if I fail to
This test could I not to Cancun

688
01:12:50,016 --> 01:12:52,542
Can you find anyone else?
-- Do you love me for a ride?

689
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,175
Listen, I'm sorry, I can
Just do not.

690
01:12:58,357 --> 01:13:01,237
What was that?
-- My life

691
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:02,832
I can still speak

692
01:13:07,486 --> 01:13:09,171
She deserves the Brenda

693
01:13:20,093 --> 01:13:21,945
Is it normal not later?

694
01:13:22,749 --> 01:13:24,223
Gail has my event cancelled

695
01:13:43,865 --> 01:13:47,454
I just wanted to say that I am
sorry ... on the pills.

696
01:13:48,904 --> 01:13:50,693
And how about that whole thing ...

697
01:13:54,832 --> 01:13:56,417
But, you know, Gail and I ...
we are simply not

698
01:13:57,567 --> 01:13:59,632
Gail and I ...
-- Keep non astublieft

699
01:14:03,829 --> 01:14:05,501
We are terrible people

700
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:09,326
Probably we deserve each other

701
01:14:11,287 --> 01:14:14,183
But it is something for later
nostalgic about to be

702
01:14:18,807 --> 01:14:22,072
No, I've told nonsense for a
Much of my life

703
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:25,020
But some things out of what
your mouth ...

704
01:14:25,112 --> 01:14:27,961
What do you think will happen?
-- I do not know

705
01:14:27,962 --> 01:14:29,605
Are we running away together?

706
01:14:29,606 --> 01:14:34,687
Get the clothes on anyone of us
hold, which depends on us

707
01:14:34,688 --> 01:14:36,751
What do you think will happen?

708
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:37,693
Listen to me!

709
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:41,612
You'm the first thing I would like
fifteen years.

710
01:14:41,613 --> 01:14:44,862
I can simply no secret life
more suffering, do you?

711
01:14:45,563 --> 01:14:46,865
I need you

712
01:14:46,866 --> 01:14:49,022
I need you in every part of my life

713
01:14:49,023 --> 01:14:51,479
I need you ...

714
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:01,115
Why should you do?

715
01:15:01,116 --> 01:15:03,666
Why can not you just
alone?

716
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:05,808
Should I pay you? is that what you want?
Should I pay you?

717
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:07,422
Is this what all this means for you?

718
01:15:08,106 --> 01:15:10,406
I'll pay you to listen to me
I'll pay you to be with me

719
01:15:10,407 --> 01:15:12,847
I'll pay you to turn me into
I'll pay you ...

720
01:15:12,882 --> 01:15:14,933
I want this no longer among us

721
01:15:14,934 --> 01:15:16,396
Do you understand? I have no longer needed

722
01:15:17,303 --> 01:15:19,023
Tell me how I can back
gain

723
01:15:20,237 --> 01:15:22,182
Say me that I have any part of your back
gain

724
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,461
It is too late

725
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:28,425
Who is here within?

726
01:15:36,037 --> 01:15:38,880
You know that this is private property?
-- No. sorry that I did not know

727
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:43,534
What are you doing here?
-- I just love of trains.

728
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:44,975
I just look around

729
01:15:47,141 --> 01:15:49,009
Is there someone with you?

730
01:15:49,748 --> 01:15:50,960
No.
-- Are you sure?

731
01:15:52,283 --> 01:15:56,819
Yes, I ... there is none, I just love
trains, so I came.

732
01:15:56,873 --> 01:15:58,070
In order to look around, that's all

733
01:16:00,354 --> 01:16:02,958
It is time to go
-- Yes, sir, thank you

734
01:17:13,582 --> 01:17:15,203
Buk you

735
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:25,770
Hello
-- It's Shirley, Brenda is there?

736
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:29,168
They can not come to the phone

737
01:17:32,364 --> 01:17:35,172
Well, can I speak Nadine?

738
01:17:35,273 --> 01:17:36,573
She is busy

739
01:17:38,191 --> 01:17:39,800
Scott, give her the phone

740
01:17:41,295 --> 01:17:42,443
She is in the babysitting

741
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:50,127
I try to not to hate

742
01:17:51,798 --> 01:17:53,502
Call astublieft no return

743
01:18:07,552 --> 01:18:11,128
What? What?
What are you doing?

744
01:18:13,318 --> 01:18:16,311
Hello?
-- Nadine did it again

745
01:18:18,418 --> 01:18:22,658
She takes back to work behind my back
She is now someone to fuck.

746
01:18:23,563 --> 01:18:26,590
I know where they go.
Where are you?

747
01:18:31,863 --> 01:18:33,110
There, running

748
01:18:43,925 --> 01:18:47,276
You're guilty me something for this
Shirley, a lot of guilt.

749
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:53,086
Hey, what are you doing ...

750
01:18:53,177 --> 01:18:54,640
Hey! Wait!

751
01:18:57,128 --> 01:18:58,568
Keep your damn mouth!

752
01:18:58,569 --> 01:18:59,320
Come here!

753
01:18:59,321 --> 01:19:01,367
Wait, wait! Stop!

754
01:19:02,131 --> 01:19:03,441
Astublieft, Shirley!

755
01:19:06,189 --> 01:19:08,590
What have I told you?
What have I done you?

756
01:19:08,591 --> 01:19:09,591
I can not check

757
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,565
Pap?

758
01:20:06,952 --> 01:20:07,982
You had earned the

759
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:10,056
You had earned it ...

760
01:20:54,205 --> 01:20:56,337
We all lead secret lives

761
01:20:58,010 --> 01:21:00,464
Even if only in our heads

762
01:21:08,704 --> 01:21:10,792
I think the question is: Why?

763
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:20,094
Are there not simpler ways
to wake up pinching myself?

764
01:21:29,072 --> 01:21:32,020
I ask no forgiveness for what
I've done.

765
01:21:33,727 --> 01:21:35,318
I have to live with my own sins

766
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,151
I think it's just one of
those moments was

767
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:10,685
A unique detail ... In another
simple life
