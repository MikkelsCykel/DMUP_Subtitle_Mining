1
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,511
It wasn't always like this.

2
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,809
Before Paris,
people didn't drink our wine.

3
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:33,285
I mean, my friends did, but you could
hardly consider their palates discerning.

4
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,548
Hell, we were farmers, sort of.

5
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,114
# When the sun comes up
on a sleepy little town #

6
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,314
# Down around San Antone #

7
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,018
# And the folks are risin'
for another day #

8
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,890
# Round about their homes ##

9
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,027
I guess I'm late.

10
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,399
I told him you were
under the weather.

11
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,339
I don't think he bought that one.

12
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:36,314
Come on, Ken. You know I don't come
around here asking for money unless I need it.

13
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:40,318
- What's wrong with the old grape press?
- It's bruising the grapes.

14
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:44,015
It's not about getting it done.
It's about getting it done right.

15
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,786
It's about making the best
goddamn wine that we can.

16
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,521
Jim...

17
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,759
I have no interest
in taking your dream away.

18
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,528
But maybe it's time
you look for a new one.

19
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,298
You want me to sign every page?

20
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,598
This is your third loan.

21
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,668
You default,
we take Château Montelena.

22
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,522
Bonjour, madame.

23
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,831
You see, Maurice...

24
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:29,356
just as Degas used paint...

25
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,869
Rodin used bronze...

26
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,872
Debussy, the piano...

27
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,500
Baudelaire, language...

28
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:41,536
so HenriJayer and Philippe de Rothschild
used the grape.

29
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,175
Great wine is great art, my friend.

30
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,709
I am, in effect, a shepherd...

31
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,188
whose mission is
to offer the public...

32
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,191
another form of great art...

33
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,557
and to guide...

34
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,530
its appreciation... thereof.

35
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,864
Well, a shepherd...

36
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,506
by definition, needs a flock.

37
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,872
And a business, by necessity...

38
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,079
needs customers.

39
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:19,244
So, if I were to subscribe
to that proviso...

40
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,050
would you be considered a customer?

41
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,051
No.

42
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,060
No, I would be considered...

43
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:33,690
an enthusiastic... advocate.

44
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,146
- Steven Spurrier.
- Uh-huh.

45
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,900
That's oaky.

46
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,099
Oh, yeah.

47
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,836
And smoky. l-

48
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,108
I detect bacon fat...

49
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:06,174
laced... with honey melon.

50
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,918
Oh, yes.

51
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,451
And a fine, smooth finish.

52
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,533
- I'm gonna have to make some changes.
- What changes?

53
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:27,369
I have to actually
sell some wines, for one.

54
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,035
- Why?
- Because this is a business, Maurice!

55
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,670
- Aha.
- "Aha" what?

56
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:37,477
You've got it all mixed up.
You have L 'Académie du Vin...

57
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,008
a school whose mandate,
unless I am somehow mistaken...

58
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,453
is to educate on wine.

59
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,548
And what do you have
on your shelves?

60
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,923
One Chianti and three Rieslings.

61
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,326
The rest are all French.

62
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,297
It might as well be
L 'Académie du Vin Française.

63
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,301
But even if it was
L'A cadémie du Vin Française...

64
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:01,432
it should seek to present its subject
in a global context.

65
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,067
What about the rest
of the world, huh?

66
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,373
I just read an article
that said California...

67
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:10,472
is gonna produce wine that will rival
the finest of the French.

68
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,919
And when that happens,
I'm going home.

69
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,512
No offense, but I don't foresee...

70
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,027
the imminent cultivation
of the Chicago vine.

71
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,288
I'm from Milwaukee.

72
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:32,368
Oh, crap.
Mike, it's not clear.

73
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,668
I was hoping for more.

74
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,709
Shh, shh.

75
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:41,679
Hey. We're racking the wine again.

76
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,238
Dad, you gotta be kidding me.

77
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,519
Outside. Now.

78
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,852
No one in the valley racks
more than three times.

79
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,823
We do.

80
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,621
Huh? Huh?

81
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,662
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

82
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,890
Whoa.

83
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,126
We've racked the wine five times.

84
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,570
Come on. Aren't we fighting?

85
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,200
Come on. Mike says we're gonna
rack it one more time.

86
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,972
Huh? That chardonnay
has gotta be clear!

87
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,673
Hell, we'll set
a world record then, huh?

88
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,197
Who the hell is that?

89
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,035
Ah. I made it.

90
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,166
Can I help you?

91
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:47,338
- Yeah, I'm Sam.
- Yeah.

92
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,713
Your eager and willing intern?

93
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,912
- You're Sam?
- Sam I am.

94
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,385
- Your tire's shot.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know.

95
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,621
But you know what I discovered?
You really only need three, don't ya?

96
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,357
Yeah, I made it all the way from
Fairfield on three, no problem.

97
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,298
Oh, God.

98
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,472
- Ow.
- So, you, uh-you okay?

99
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,913
Yeah, no, no. l-

100
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,544
I mean, " the world
breaks everyone...

101
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,489
and, uh, afterward many are stronger
at the broken places. "

102
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,857
- Hemingway, right?
- Yeah.

103
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:41,662
Yeah, originally.
But, um, you'll hear my dad say it a lot.

104
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,764
Come here. I just wanna
show you something.

105
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,535
Just take a second.

106
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:57,772
So let's say you're strolling down the street.
Now, which business do you notice?

107
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,717
Yours...

108
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,084
or mine?

109
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:07,091
Well, it depends if you're looking for
a bottle of wine or a limo tour of the city.

110
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,093
Well, maybe so.

111
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,927
But Pierre Tari seeks out
my business, not yours.

112
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,899
Promotion, Stevie boy.

113
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,664
That's the key to any
successful business venture.

114
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,572
- Promotion.
- Pierre Tari?

115
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,041
- Yes.
- Secretary general...

116
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:28,376
of the Association
des Grandes Crus Classés?

117
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,540
Yes again.

118
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:34,177
Maurice, I have an idea.

119
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,949
- You sure he's in there?
- Absolutely.

120
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,183
Every Tuesday.
My guy, Yves Magnon, used to drive him.

121
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,021
I see him.

122
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,148
Ah. Uh-

123
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:43,221
No.

124
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,223
Well?

125
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,124
- Done.
- Wow.

126
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:52,324
- He agreed, huh?
- He had a couple of stipulations.

127
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:57,028
- Like what?
- First, I have to come up with 500 francs by Tuesday.

128
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,036
You mean you have to pay him?

129
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:02,596
I will be making a charitable contribution
to the federation.

130
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,076
Ah. Hey, maybe it'll get you
a better table at their next dinner.

131
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,413
- Blind tasting, huh?
- Yeah.

132
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,416
Sends out a message of impartiality.

133
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,453
I don't think Tari and the otherjudges
need to see a label to tell the difference...

134
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,218
between a Mouton Rothschild
and a California twist-top red.

135
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,418
If the French lose,
they might bring back the guillotine.

136
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:25,725
Every great entrepreneurial
inspiration has its risks.

137
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,232
What about publicity, huh?
Hey, I know this guy, George.

138
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,326
He's a great writer.
He was even published in TIME magazine.

139
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,065
Huh. The well-known wine journal.

140
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,336
It's too American. Too up itself.
We need to involve the real news outlets.

141
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,845
- You mean the French outlets.
- Maurice, this is a sophisticated story.

142
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,006
It will lend itself
to sophisticated publications...

143
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,107
that appeal to
a sophisticated readership.

144
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,311
I'll call George.

145
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,847
Wow. Would you look at that?
There must be over 500 words there.

146
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,258
This article's all about
women's fashion accessories.

147
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:59,456
Maurice, this doesn't
even credit George Taber.

148
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,829
It's because George
is a ghostwriter.

149
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,436
And how do you substantiate
the work of a ghost?

150
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,368
And how do you substantiate
the work of a ghost?

151
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,895
- Has George ever written about wine?
- He's an oenophile.

152
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,964
That'll be a no then.

153
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,114
Complex and a bit woolly.

154
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:21,620
I think it's a seducer.

155
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:25,521
I'm going to California to try and find
some respectable competition.

156
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,857
The wines will have to arrive a month
or so early so they'll have time to recover.

157
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,387
Are you saying that wine gets jet lag?

158
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,663
No. It gets what is commonly
referred to as "bottle shock."

159
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,636
Which might, of course, improve it.

160
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,005
So this is it.

161
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,049
Uh, grocery store.
Old bank.

162
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,845
Nice.

163
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:56,319
- This is Gustavo.
- Gustavo.

164
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,982
Hey, hey, boy.

165
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,856
Chico.

166
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,555
Check my back.
Make sure it's clear, will ya?

167
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,861
Yeah, you. Come on. Check my back.
Make sure it's clear, will ya?

168
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,662
Stop, stop.

169
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,739
Oh, shit.

170
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,776
Apologize.
You should have said "please."

171
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:22,246
- Let go of my antenna.
- You didn't say please because you assume that I serve you.

172
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,215
- If you put a crinkle in that-
- Because you are a racist.

173
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:29,721
- Who do you think you are, Cesar Chavez?
- I am Gustavo Brambila!

174
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,800
- Should we run?
- Yes.

175
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:49,972
Hey. Hey. Hey, man, my friend doesn't
wanna fight, all right?

176
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,239
But he also doesn't wanna be addressed
with disparaging colloquial expressions...

177
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,213
that imply some sort of genetic
or cultural inferiority...

178
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:59,809
or that are simply used out of some
form of inappropriate ethnocentrism.

179
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,991
That was a good shot.

180
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,394
Some solid force behind it. But let me give you
some advice.

181
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,932
- Don't telegraph your moves, man.
- Do you do this often?

182
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,299
- Change things up on me. Come on!
- No. Not really.

183
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,272
Ooh! And now I got your number.
Let's see. Come on.

184
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,139
Excuse me. Big guy, if I may?

185
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,270
- Hi. Hi.
- I got you.

186
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:32,477
Have you considered that you might
be swinging at the wrong dude?

187
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,510
I mean, when you think about it,
it was Gustavo here who broke your antenna.

188
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:40,150
Why are you swinging at Bo who was really
just trying to make sense of the situation?

189
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,659
It's just- It's not logical to me.

190
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,128
- She's right.
- Thank you.

191
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:49,361
Do we really need to fight to
bring this to some sort of resolution?

192
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,460
Keep on movin', man. Come on.
I'm gonna have to deck ya.

193
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,506
- Hippies.
- Come on, come on. That's all you got?

194
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,133
I didn't even bleed. Ha!

195
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,767
Rock]
- [People Chattering]

196
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,178
Something I can help you with?

197
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,239
No.

198
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:12,785
I can't believe you did that!

199
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:17,488
- Ice!
- He stopped a left cross with his face to protect my virtue.

200
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:24,700
- Hey, Bo.
- Hey, Joe.

201
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,707
You didn't call. Having trouble
with that big, old dialing finger again?

202
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,970
Yeah.

203
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,309
- So you're a Joe?
- My father was the original Joe.

204
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,815
Left the place to me.

205
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,744
Oh, three.

206
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:47,053
So, why Montelena?

207
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,993
Well, you have good history
and good terroir.

208
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,223
They like our dirt.

209
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,733
Well, dirt was good enough
for Al Lovering Tubbs in 1882...

210
00:18:55,801 --> 00:19:00,101
when he went and bought
253 acres of the stuff, right?

211
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,074
- 254.
- That...

212
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,044
and... yours was the
only position I was offered.

213
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:11,606
Well, you know, history does judge
a prizefighter by the bouts he selects.

214
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:15,211
And the ones he avoids.

215
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:19,587
Life lessons from a surf bum
and a wannabe winemaker.

216
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,626
I am here because I wanna learn...

217
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:25,460
everything there is to know
about viniculture and viticulture.

218
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,260
Hear! Hear!
Don't we all?

219
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,462
Oh, Gustavo is very modest when
he's not snapping off the antennas...

220
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,698
of racist truckers twice his size.

221
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,833
- Modesty is the virtue of slaves.
- Oh, cheer up, Stavo.

222
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:43,373
Gustavo Brambila was raised
in the vineyards of Northern California.

223
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:46,475
He has our valley's grapes
in his blood.

224
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,419
If you pour this Mexican hombre
a glass of wine...

225
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,582
he can tell you how much cabernet
and how much merlot's in the blend.

226
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,559
He can even tell you the vintage.

227
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,993
Bullshit.

228
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,588
- Bullshit!
- I'll be right back.

229
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,401
Hey, Joe.

230
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:08,531
What have you got in the back room?

231
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,508
- You got money?
- Yeah.

232
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,239
Pick any three for me
and put 'em in paper bags.

233
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,013
Hey, listen.

234
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,317
I take 60% off the top, okay?

235
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:28,416
- What? I gotta buy the wine.
- Okay.

236
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:31,930
- Mm-mmm.!
- She's not gonna sleep with you.

237
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,591
She's gotta sleep eventually.

238
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,100
Yeah.
In her own bed.

239
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,865
Hey, everybody.
Listen up.

240
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:44,341
Who here wants to wager a little money
that this Mexican...

241
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:49,278
son of an immigrant field hand...

242
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,612
can't guess what kind of grapes
are in these wines...

243
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,675
that our kind bartender
has personally selected?

244
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,812
Fuck you. Fifty percent.

245
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,483
Don't break my antenna.
I'm just trying to get us paid.

246
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,891
Any asshole can tell a merlot
from a zinfandel.

247
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,691
Yeah, maybe. But can any asshole
tell you the vintage?

248
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,860
All right. Ten bucks.
And he has to guess all three.

249
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:15,305
- Ten bucks. It's hardly worth the trouble.
- Okay. Twenty.

250
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,842
And I get to slow dance with her.

251
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,901
You're on.!
Anybody else?

252
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,378
I want 20% for that.

253
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,007
- I'll give up 10 if you give up 10.
- Okay.

254
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,575
All right. I'm flush!

255
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,918
Gentlemen, action if you
want it, put it on the bar.

256
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,838
It's cabernet.

257
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:53,401
- Yep.
- 1971.

258
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,205
- Ridge.
- Yep.

259
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:00,683
- Let's see the bottle.
- Oh, that's nothin'.! A recent vintage.!

260
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,248
Dances like a lullaby
at the tip of my tongue.

261
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,386
Sonoma. Pinot noir.

262
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,855
1962...

263
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,634
Buena Vista.

264
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,968
- Yep.
- How does he do that?

265
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,998
- Attaboy, Stav. Go get 'em, baby.
- It's not from Napa.

266
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:33,111
I can't tell you whether
it's a merlot or cabernet.

267
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,593
Oh, dear God.

268
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,361
I can't say because...

269
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,730
it's a 1947 Cheval Blanc.

270
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,497
About half merlot,
half cabernet franc.

271
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,336
- Amazing!
- Ooh!

272
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:01,607
Yes.! Thank you.! Yes.!
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

273
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,081
1947 Cheval Blanc,
greatest wine ever made.

274
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,422
Very nice.

275
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,958
- Thanks.
- Yes, yes, yes.

276
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,517
Twenty, 40, 60, 70...

277
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,257
80, 90...

278
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,265
$100.

279
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,996
- Sweet!
- The Cheval Blanc was 50 bucks.

280
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,029
How 'bout we throw in
the other two wines for free.

281
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:32,474
- Enjoy.
- Uh-

282
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:36,503
I believe you owe her 10 too.

283
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,811
- Oh.
- Thank you.

284
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:42,411
Hey. I thought you were gonna lead
with the Buena Vista.

285
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,887
No, Joe switched 'em.
I had nothin' to do with that.

286
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:47,187
Yeah. I mean-

287
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,160
- For the Cheval.
- You hustlers.

288
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,221
Hand over my 10.

289
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,460
Thank you.

290
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:59,527
Rock]

291
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,595
Who is it?

292
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,725
It's, uh, me, Gustavo.

293
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:42,143
Sorry. Did I wake you?

294
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:47,114
Maria Callas and I,
we don't sleep much.

295
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,522
I need to check the wine.

296
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,424
Someday we'll do this
in plain daylight?

297
00:24:56,795 --> 00:25:00,925
I think I'd sleep much better
if I sold my grapes to Gallo.

298
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:36,598
- I think it's time to bottle.
- The third act of the grand opera.

299
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:40,729
The wine in the glass
before it is no more.

300
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,772
Taste that wine.

301
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:49,371
Tell me if you still would
have rather sold your grapes to Gallo.

302
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,364
Not bad.

303
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:13,370
When can we tell people?
I hate secrets.

304
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,530
Soon.

305
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,104
Soon.

306
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,989
Oh, for Christ's sake!

307
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,829
Stupid "assing" car!

308
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:22,297
Of all the stupid shit!

309
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,641
I got a better jack in the truck.
Is there a spare in that trunk?

310
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:05,615
Oh, yes. And a first-aid box
with a snakebite kit.

311
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,415
Ah. Alls we'll need is the spare.

312
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:14,884
So, the Académie du Vin in Paris...

313
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,396
is gonna give people instruction
in California wine?

314
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,397
Part of my thinking, yes.

315
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:24,162
I just have to be sure I'm not introducing
anything completely unpalatable.

316
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:28,502
Well, there are plenty
of palatable wines in this country.

317
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,803
- You don't have to worry about that.
- Yes, well-

318
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:35,938
My definition of palatable might be
slightly different from yours.

319
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,606
Why is that?

320
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:41,675
Oh, years of total immersion
in a nation...

321
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:45,086
devoted to its enological endeavors.

322
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:49,684
One can't just decide to be a vintner,
and then conveniently become one.

323
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,595
- There are dynasties at play.
- That isn't true in California.

324
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,428
I rest my case.

325
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,527
- You're a snob.
- Am I?

326
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:02,129
It limits you.

327
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,841
Well, thanks for your help,
mister-

328
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,108
Barrett. Jim Barrett.
I own Château Montelena...

329
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,706
conveniently, of course.

330
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,356
Can I help you?

331
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:32,055
Mr. Barrett.

332
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:37,092
I didn't introduce myself.
Steven Spurrier.

333
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:43,300
- What do you want?
- To taste your chardonnay.

334
00:30:46,243 --> 00:30:51,476
- No.
- Did I mention that the tasting was blind?

335
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,947
Rich, round, layers of tangerine...

336
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,244
peach.

337
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,085
Andjust a kiss of oak.

338
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:42,155
Like I said, people make some
pretty good wine in this area.

339
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:49,432
- That's why I'm here.
- Really?

340
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:54,035
Because the world, or anybody who's at all
conscious about what we're trying to do here...

341
00:31:54,111 --> 00:31:58,673
tends to think of us as a bunch of hicks
taking on the French.

342
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,715
True enough.

343
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:06,985
You know, I don't know about you.

344
00:32:07,057 --> 00:32:11,460
But one thing we've learned around here is
that if one person succeeds, we all succeed.

345
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,463
So I won't speak for them.

346
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,965
They might wanna be involved.

347
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:18,194
So I'll make some calls.

348
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,864
That's very magnanimous of you.

349
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,908
How much do I owe you?

350
00:32:35,085 --> 00:32:37,349
You took money for a tasting?

351
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,523
Yeah.

352
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:44,652
- Is that some new policy we have?
- Nope.

353
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,739
Hey, Bo.

354
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:04,974
Did you grow up in Napa?

355
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,210
No, I came here after high school.

356
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:10,515
- Is it your father's idea to give me a tour?
- Nope.

357
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:13,785
- What's your position at the vineyard?
- Ooh, cellar rat.

358
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,258
Oh. And you?

359
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,228
I am the intern to the cellar rat.

360
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:23,392
#Freedom don't come easy, babe #

361
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:27,198
# When your spirit's
flying up among the clouds #

362
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:30,570
# And when you're faced with
the wise man's road #

363
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,201
- # You gotta know where to go #
- Where to first?

364
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:37,179
Karen Thompson's new winery.
She makes a dynamite sauvignon.

365
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,308
A woman?

366
00:33:40,384 --> 00:33:45,321
Yeah, we embrace the enological talents
of womenfolk here in our valley.

367
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:47,357
Oh.

368
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:49,358
Good to know, Bo.

369
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:53,157
# Sun and the stars are
a travelin'man's companion #

370
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,255
# Leadin'the way
for his journey #

371
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:58,529
He wants to pay for the tasting?

372
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:00,661
My dad says take his money.

373
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:05,569
# Mm-hmm #

374
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:09,443
# Leadin'the way
The first to come #

375
00:34:09,513 --> 00:34:14,007
# Showin'the way
for his children #

376
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:16,985
Mr. Robbins.
Hey, can we get a barrel sample...

377
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:19,818
for this, uh, French wine snob?

378
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,620
He doesn't think
we make real wine here.

379
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:27,255
- Sure thing. Wanna grab it yourself, Bo?
- Yeah.

380
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,265
# Mm-hmm #

381
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,261
You can leave your money
on the way out.

382
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,205
So you're having a contest.

383
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:44,713
I suppose you could call it that.

384
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:49,219
You're going to be
a very popular man, Mr. Spurrier.

385
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:56,222
# Mm-hmm #

386
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:58,488
# Yeah #

387
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,659
- Thank you, Mr. Barrett.
- Sure thing, Brit.

388
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:06,532
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

389
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,232
- There he is.
- He's here.

390
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:13,299
Mr. Spurrier. Mr. Spurrier.

391
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:16,869
Hello, everybody.
Thanks so much for coming.

392
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:20,474
I'll need some bottled water,
flat, preferably Vittel.

393
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:24,078
Wow, that was interesting in
a hail-to-the-queen sort of way.

394
00:35:24,154 --> 00:35:27,555
Uh, some water biscuits
or a French roll.

395
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,856
And then I'll meet you all
one at a time.

396
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,362
I'll be right here.

397
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:37,662
- What now?
- Oh, I don't know.

398
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,669
Get a burger, or maybe...

399
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,570
we just go somewhere,
get naked and screw.

400
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,404
No, I'd rather clean the thrasher.

401
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,444
# Yeah ##

402
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:49,445
Yeah, let's get a burger then.

403
00:35:49,513 --> 00:35:52,277
Where the hell am I
gonna get Vittel?

404
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,099
#I recall once upon a time #

405
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:25,574
# Livin'was so easy
and I felt so fine #

406
00:36:27,217 --> 00:36:30,050
# But my, my, my #

407
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,281
# Right before my very eyes #

408
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,257
Hey.
Seen Gustavo?

409
00:36:37,027 --> 00:36:38,824
No.

410
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:42,457
Are you gonna help me with this,
because this thing's a bitch, or no?

411
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,128
Nah.
You're doing great.

412
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:56,175
# Thirty minutes after
my ship set sail ##

413
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:08,387
I'll talk to you later, all right, dude?

414
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,442
Do you have any ambition at all?

415
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,607
Uh-

416
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,674
Uh, I don't know.

417
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,547
See the Dead live at the Cow Palace?

418
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,450
Not really, no.

419
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:48,187
Maybe it's all my fault.
Maybe I just gave you too much.

420
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:50,699
Maybe it's all been too easy for ya.

421
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,461
I don't think so.

422
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,098
Really, I don't.

423
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:08,482
You have until the end of the year.

424
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:12,579
You go back to school,
you get a degree...

425
00:38:12,656 --> 00:38:16,717
or you're outta here
and you're on your on.

426
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,887
Okay?

427
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:21,055
I'll think about it.

428
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:24,396
And you have to get a scholarship
because I'm broke.

429
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,663
You're not that broke.

430
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:30,867
We need 10 more barrels. You know
how much those Limousin oak barrels cost.

431
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,102
You don't have money for barrels?

432
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,668
We can't afford four new tires
for the truck.

433
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,941
I heard you only need three.

434
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:43,475
And we owe the bank.

435
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,217
You wanna fight?

436
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,781
Which one were you with today?

437
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,790
Shelly.

438
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,197
Shelly who?

439
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,735
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

440
00:39:12,382 --> 00:39:15,874
How could you not know?
She drove you home, for God's sake.

441
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,251
You probably slept with her too!

442
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:25,454
I slept with the person,
not the name.

443
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,622
Oh, God, Bo.

444
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:31,828
It's 1976.
Woodstock was seven years ago.

445
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:43,576
# I'm walking in shadows
I cannot see #

446
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:49,051
# Faces, they smile
when I fall or flee #

447
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,421
# Doors without windows
all shuttered tight #

448
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:57,927
# Again #

449
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:01,226
# I just might
pass this way again #

450
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:06,566
# I just might
pass this way again #

451
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:10,963
# I just might
pass this way #

452
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,601
# I just might
pass this way again #

453
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,702
Is that Orion's belt?

454
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,972
I have no idea.

455
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:27,322
You know that Woodstock
was seven years ago?

456
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,951
That long, huh?

457
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:35,465
# I'm walking in shadows
I cannot see #

458
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:41,064
Do you think I'm a loser?

459
00:40:42,572 --> 00:40:46,167
Well, I mean, pretty much
everyone else does, but...

460
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:49,906
I haven't made up my mind yet.

461
00:40:55,218 --> 00:40:58,449
I think I should do
something about it.

462
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,393
Probably wouldn't be a bad idea.

463
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,726
# The night, she is hot #

464
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,169
# Creole girls, they sing #

465
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:17,706
# My heart, it is pounding #

466
00:41:17,874 --> 00:41:20,365
# My ears, they ring #

467
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:25,575
# The spell has been cast
down in New Orleans #

468
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:28,910
# I just might
pass this way #

469
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,820
# I just might
pass this way again ##

470
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,774
- So what did he think?
- Excuse me?

471
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,614
The tea bag, the Brit.

472
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:06,385
Did he like your wine?

473
00:42:08,658 --> 00:42:12,617
Come on, Gustavo.
It's a small valley.

474
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,358
You think I wouldn't find out?

475
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:20,635
- l- I thought you'd be mad.
- I am mad.

476
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:24,469
You should have been
straight with me.

477
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:32,312
I'd like for you to try it.

478
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:34,816
Nope.

479
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,979
You're on your own now, kid.

480
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,248
Are you firing me?

481
00:42:42,325 --> 00:42:45,852
I can't afford you anyway.

482
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:50,662
Come on, Jim.
What am I supposed to live on?

483
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:54,329
When your focus is elsewhere,
you're not a good employee.

484
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:58,170
And your focus has been
elsewhere for some time now.

485
00:43:02,946 --> 00:43:04,937
You people.

486
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:12,151
You think you can just...
buy your way into this.

487
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:16,657
Take a few lessons.

488
00:43:16,726 --> 00:43:19,991
Grow some grapes.
Make some good wine.

489
00:43:20,063 --> 00:43:22,964
You cannot do it that way.

490
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,864
All right, all right.

491
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,199
You have to have it in your blood.

492
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:32,207
You have to grow up with the soil
underneath your nails...

493
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:36,211
and the smell of the grape
in the air that you breathe.

494
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:39,476
The cultivation of the vine
is an art form.

495
00:43:39,549 --> 00:43:41,813
The refinement of its juice
is a religion...

496
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:44,149
that requires pain...

497
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:48,317
and desire and sacrifice.

498
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:50,325
Amen.

499
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,962
My father knew that.

500
00:43:58,034 --> 00:44:03,267
He was a field hand and he never had
the opportunity to make his own wine.

501
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,207
I know that.

502
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:09,905
And I'm gonna make it
happen one way or another.

503
00:44:25,762 --> 00:44:28,424
Thanks, dude.

504
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:31,797
Oh, yeah. Careful, dude.
She's fragile.

505
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:33,869
Thank you, sir.

506
00:44:59,127 --> 00:45:01,595
Mom.

507
00:45:01,663 --> 00:45:03,597
Bo. Hi!

508
00:45:03,665 --> 00:45:05,895
- How are you?
- Good. Are you good?

509
00:45:05,967 --> 00:45:08,162
Mm-hmm.

510
00:45:10,138 --> 00:45:14,438
Mr. Relyea.
Mrs. Relyea.

511
00:45:19,848 --> 00:45:21,839
Bill.

512
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,121
Brian will be really excited that we saw you, Bo.

513
00:45:29,557 --> 00:45:32,492
- How is Brian?
- Oh, he's having a hell of a time.

514
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,290
He loves Yale. Your mom says that
you're working for your dad.

515
00:45:35,363 --> 00:45:38,264
Have you given up school then?

516
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:46,332
The arts program is thriving
under Laura and my expert guidance.

517
00:45:47,976 --> 00:45:50,945
... such great things for those kids.

518
00:45:51,012 --> 00:45:53,674
I guess you boys
don't eat much up there.

519
00:45:56,017 --> 00:45:59,282
Oh, we eat. We do.

520
00:45:59,354 --> 00:46:04,724
We're getting together, um, for dinner
at the Chart House, if you wanna join us.

521
00:46:04,793 --> 00:46:08,524
Um, oh, hey, I'd love to,
but I, um-

522
00:46:09,965 --> 00:46:13,731
Yeah, I gotta get back.
With me gone, we're shorthanded.

523
00:46:13,802 --> 00:46:17,738
There's -There's so much
to do as it is. You know.

524
00:46:17,806 --> 00:46:19,364
- Honey.
- Hmm?

525
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:22,569
- Tell me how much you need-
- No, Mom.

526
00:46:22,644 --> 00:46:25,704
so we can get on to the more pleasant
part of our... visit.

527
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,714
Come on.

528
00:46:51,506 --> 00:46:53,736
Check it out.
I'm gonna be mobile again.

529
00:46:53,808 --> 00:46:56,368
- Yeah? You need help?
- Okay. Here?

530
00:46:56,444 --> 00:46:58,537
Hop on.

531
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:04,146
You said that to him?

532
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:06,210
Yeah.

533
00:47:06,287 --> 00:47:09,586
Shit.

534
00:47:09,657 --> 00:47:11,852
What are you gonna do now?

535
00:47:14,562 --> 00:47:16,553
I'm not sure.

536
00:47:16,631 --> 00:47:19,293
Can I try it?

537
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:21,494
Your wine?

538
00:47:23,938 --> 00:47:26,338
It, uh...

539
00:47:26,408 --> 00:47:29,343
made Señor Garcia cry.

540
00:47:30,645 --> 00:47:33,136
Then again, he was listening
to Maria Callas at the time.

541
00:47:39,721 --> 00:47:42,212
I got some Portuguese sardines...

542
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:44,622
and crackers inside.

543
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:49,325
You think this goes well with fish?

544
00:47:51,032 --> 00:47:53,830
Yeah. Yeah, l- I think so.

545
00:47:53,902 --> 00:47:55,893
Good.

546
00:47:57,038 --> 00:47:58,596
Hey, Sam.

547
00:48:00,575 --> 00:48:05,569
- Yeah.
- I don't think your car is safe to drive.

548
00:48:05,647 --> 00:48:09,981
- Why not?
- The, uh-The axle's bent.

549
00:48:10,051 --> 00:48:13,179
- That's sweet.
- What?

550
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:16,416
You're worried about me.

551
00:48:22,897 --> 00:48:25,798
To Gustavo Brambila...

552
00:48:25,867 --> 00:48:28,267
renegade...

553
00:48:28,336 --> 00:48:31,100
who worships
the sanctity of the vine.

554
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:36,173
And can't afford a full tank of gas.

555
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:57,282
Sam!

556
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:03,228
- Hey.
- Oh, man.

557
00:50:03,298 --> 00:50:05,789
We gotta get out
to the vineyard. Come on.

558
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:07,960
Uh, yeah.
Just a second.

559
00:50:18,346 --> 00:50:21,406
Bo!

560
00:50:24,819 --> 00:50:28,186
Bo!
Come on, Bo!

561
00:50:38,066 --> 00:50:41,627
Hey. Just a little lighter
on that part, okay?

562
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:15,530
- Where's Bo?
- I don't know.

563
00:51:15,603 --> 00:51:17,696
He took the truck.

564
00:51:19,107 --> 00:51:21,041
He didn't come by to pick you up?

565
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:25,876
Yeah, but I wasn't about to dive
in the back while it was driving away.

566
00:51:36,157 --> 00:51:40,787
Well, Sam, this is where wine
is made, the vineyard.

567
00:51:40,862 --> 00:51:45,162
And the vineyard's best fertilizer
is the owner's footsteps.

568
00:51:46,934 --> 00:51:50,062
It's alluvial, sedimentary,
volcanic soil.

569
00:51:51,572 --> 00:51:54,006
- Dry.
- Right.

570
00:51:54,075 --> 00:51:57,442
You want to limit the irrigation
'cause it makes the vines struggle...

571
00:51:57,512 --> 00:52:00,447
intensifies the flavor.

572
00:52:00,515 --> 00:52:05,418
A comfortable grape, a well-watered,
well-fertilized grape...

573
00:52:05,486 --> 00:52:09,786
grows into a lazy ingredient
of a lousy wine.

574
00:52:13,061 --> 00:52:16,258
So, from hardship
comes enlightenment.

575
00:52:18,633 --> 00:52:20,726
For a grape.

576
00:52:44,292 --> 00:52:47,261
"Wine is sunlight...

577
00:52:47,328 --> 00:52:49,922
held together by water. "

578
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,062
The poetic wisdom of the Italian physicist,
philosopher and stargazer...

579
00:52:57,138 --> 00:53:00,073
Galileo Galilei.

580
00:53:09,317 --> 00:53:12,343
It all begins with the soil...

581
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,583
the vine, the grape.

582
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:02,965
The smell of the vineyard.

583
00:54:04,372 --> 00:54:06,533
Like inhaling birth.

584
00:54:07,842 --> 00:54:11,778
It awakens some... ancestral...

585
00:54:11,846 --> 00:54:15,577
some... primordial-

586
00:54:17,618 --> 00:54:19,552
Anyway, some deeply imprinted...

587
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,784
and probably subconscious place...

588
00:54:23,858 --> 00:54:25,792
in my soul.

589
00:55:49,944 --> 00:55:51,878
Everything all right here?

590
00:55:51,946 --> 00:55:54,744
These Californian wines...

591
00:55:56,284 --> 00:56:00,243
are all... so good.

592
00:56:01,622 --> 00:56:03,556
What were you expecting?

593
00:56:03,624 --> 00:56:05,558
Thunderbird?

594
00:56:34,389 --> 00:56:36,254
- What did you do?
- Huh?

595
00:56:36,324 --> 00:56:38,690
- What'd you do?
- The-We needed them, Dad.

596
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,421
Huh?

597
00:56:40,495 --> 00:56:43,487
- You send them back, all right?
- You know full well we can't send them back.

598
00:56:43,565 --> 00:56:45,157
- Just send them back.
- You wanna fight?

599
00:56:45,233 --> 00:56:48,293
No. No, goddamn it!
I don't wanna fight!

600
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:50,098
I just want to- to-

601
00:56:50,171 --> 00:56:51,433
God.

602
00:56:52,273 --> 00:56:54,764
To not fail at this.

603
00:56:54,843 --> 00:56:57,607
To not completely fail.

604
00:56:58,947 --> 00:57:01,814
Oh, God.

605
00:57:01,883 --> 00:57:03,441
Are you okay?

606
00:57:03,518 --> 00:57:06,316
Yeah. Just-

607
00:57:10,258 --> 00:57:12,658
Don't -

608
00:57:12,727 --> 00:57:15,787
Just don't ever pull
a stunt like that again.

609
00:57:19,067 --> 00:57:21,535
I solved the problem.

610
00:57:21,603 --> 00:57:23,537
Oh. I owe her now.

611
00:57:23,605 --> 00:57:26,073
- Think of it as a gift.
- Gift like that costs more than money.

612
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:28,837
Why? Because you might
actually have to say thank you?

613
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:31,879
- I don't wanna owe anybody.
- You owe the bank 12 and a half percent.

614
00:57:31,946 --> 00:57:34,210
Pay her back if you want. Or not.

615
00:57:34,282 --> 00:57:36,876
Whatever. She's not gonna
charge you interest.

616
00:57:36,951 --> 00:57:39,852
I'd rather owe 10 banks
than owe your mother.

617
00:57:41,189 --> 00:57:44,920
Oh, by the way, I fired Gustavo.

618
00:57:44,993 --> 00:57:48,190
What? Wh-Why would you do that?

619
00:57:48,263 --> 00:57:50,527
He's running his own operation now.

620
00:57:50,598 --> 00:57:53,431
What are you talking about?

621
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:55,435
Ask him.

622
00:57:55,503 --> 00:57:57,266
Knock, knock.

623
00:57:59,941 --> 00:58:01,033
Whoa.

624
00:58:03,678 --> 00:58:05,407
Putting some blood
into it now, are you?

625
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,175
Can I help you?

626
00:58:08,449 --> 00:58:11,612
Could I purchase two bottles
of the '73, please?

627
00:58:11,686 --> 00:58:14,246
It's not ready.

628
00:58:18,826 --> 00:58:21,056
I'll hold onto it.

629
00:58:21,129 --> 00:58:24,792
Does this mean that you've picked
the wines for your tasting?

630
00:58:24,866 --> 00:58:28,996
I'll be making a formal announcement
to the invited wineries and to the press.

631
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,630
I can't spoil
the bubble of surprise now.

632
00:58:31,706 --> 00:58:36,405
Right. Wouldn't wanna
pop any bubbles.

633
00:58:38,012 --> 00:58:43,075
And when will this formal
declaration be taking place?

634
00:58:43,151 --> 00:58:45,085
In due course.

635
00:58:45,153 --> 00:58:47,986
Why don't I like you?

636
00:58:48,056 --> 00:58:50,149
'Cause you think I'm an asshole.
And I'm not really.

637
00:58:50,225 --> 00:58:53,058
I'm just British,
and, well, you're not.

638
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:58,065
l- It's because...

639
00:58:58,132 --> 00:59:02,000
I think you've designed
this whole tasting thing...

640
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:05,471
to embarrass the Americans
on their birthday.

641
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,940
- Why would I do that?
- To somehow...

642
00:59:08,009 --> 00:59:11,001
- make yourself more popular among your peers.
- Dad.

643
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:13,946
No. l-lf there's one thing I know...

644
00:59:14,015 --> 00:59:16,006
it's people.

645
00:59:19,053 --> 00:59:21,419
Well...

646
00:59:21,489 --> 00:59:23,480
good to see you again.

647
00:59:37,572 --> 00:59:39,597
You know, Montelena
could have used the exposure.

648
00:59:39,674 --> 00:59:43,633
What if we'd won?
People might then actually buy our wine.

649
00:59:43,711 --> 00:59:46,145
They'd never let us win.

650
00:59:46,214 --> 00:59:47,442
Who is "they"?

651
00:59:47,515 --> 00:59:50,575
Him. The Brit.
They- the French wine cronies.

652
00:59:50,652 --> 00:59:53,678
They're in the French wine trade.

653
00:59:53,755 --> 00:59:55,723
They're not looking to change that.

654
00:59:57,392 --> 00:59:59,383
It's a mistake, Dad.

655
01:00:28,456 --> 01:00:32,358
Man, this is the, uh-
the heaviest glass of wine I've ever had.

656
01:00:32,427 --> 01:00:35,157
- Don't be so melodramatic.
- Hey, I'm serious, dude.

657
01:00:35,229 --> 01:00:37,390
Taste it.

658
01:00:39,734 --> 01:00:43,500
- Did you sleep with her?
- Oh, come on, Bo.

659
01:00:43,571 --> 01:00:46,062
- Admit it. Admit it.
- You of all people.

660
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,700
- How many different girls have you been with-
- This is different.

661
01:00:48,776 --> 01:00:50,437
Taste the wine, please.

662
01:00:56,784 --> 01:00:59,218
Did the Brit like it?

663
01:01:01,289 --> 01:01:03,257
He bought two bottles.

664
01:01:03,324 --> 01:01:04,916
That says something.

665
01:01:04,992 --> 01:01:07,893
Ten bucks.

666
01:01:10,031 --> 01:01:12,192
Are you seeing her?

667
01:01:12,266 --> 01:01:14,131
What does-What does that mean?

668
01:01:14,202 --> 01:01:17,365
- You know exactly what that means.
- I don't know.

669
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:20,874
She liked my wine.

670
01:01:21,876 --> 01:01:24,071
- A lot. You know-
- Uh-huh.

671
01:01:24,145 --> 01:01:26,477
I can't believe you're jealous.

672
01:01:26,547 --> 01:01:29,311
- Come on. I'm not jealous.
- You're jealous. Yes, you are.

673
01:01:29,384 --> 01:01:32,251
- I'm not.
- Okay. Well, then, she was, um-

674
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:36,586
Mmm. She was good.

675
01:01:36,657 --> 01:01:39,490
- I've never had a girl say my name like that, right?
- All right.

676
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,824
- Enough.
- She moaned my name-

677
01:01:41,896 --> 01:01:44,592
- Did you actually sleep with her?
- Yeah, I slept with her, dude.

678
01:01:44,665 --> 01:01:46,690
Bullshit. I don't f-

679
01:01:48,836 --> 01:01:52,431
Don't lay that rich guy bullshit on me.
I work my ass off.

680
01:01:56,043 --> 01:01:59,171
- I'm out there 12 hours a day.
- I couldn't even come and play.

681
01:01:59,247 --> 01:02:02,182
- Play? Oh, come on.
- Taste the fuckin' wine, please!

682
01:02:11,726 --> 01:02:13,318
It's good.

683
01:02:13,394 --> 01:02:14,918
Good?

684
01:02:14,996 --> 01:02:17,624
What kind of an opinion is that?

685
01:02:17,698 --> 01:02:20,531
A good one.

686
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:30,208
If I had been born with your privilege-

687
01:02:30,278 --> 01:02:32,007
Excuse me?

688
01:02:33,214 --> 01:02:35,205
I wouldn't have squandered it.

689
01:02:49,764 --> 01:02:53,962
The white zone is for
immediate loading and unloading of passengers-

690
01:02:54,035 --> 01:02:56,299
- No parking.
- Excuse me.

691
01:02:57,705 --> 01:02:59,002
Hey.

692
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:02,233
Bo. Are you going somewhere?

693
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:04,301
I'm sorry about my dad.

694
01:03:04,378 --> 01:03:06,676
He can be a little, uh, impulsive.

695
01:03:06,747 --> 01:03:08,715
- I could think of other words.
- Uh...

696
01:03:08,783 --> 01:03:11,479
- pigheaded maybe?
- That would be one of them.

697
01:03:11,552 --> 01:03:15,181
I wanted you to have two bottles of
our chardonnay- for the competition.

698
01:03:15,256 --> 01:03:17,087
If you decide to choose them.

699
01:03:18,526 --> 01:03:20,517
Is your father okay with this?

700
01:03:20,595 --> 01:03:23,189
Ye-Yes.
Absolutely.

701
01:03:23,264 --> 01:03:25,255
Right.

702
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:28,097
Hello, and thank you for flying
with TWA today.

703
01:03:28,169 --> 01:03:30,103
My name is Becky.
How may I help you?

704
01:03:30,171 --> 01:03:33,436
- I will be traveling on Flight 349 to Paris this morning.
- How many persons traveling?

705
01:03:33,508 --> 01:03:35,100
Just one.

706
01:03:35,176 --> 01:03:37,371
And how many suitcases?

707
01:03:37,445 --> 01:03:41,438
Also just one.
Oh. And this one I'll have to carry.

708
01:03:41,516 --> 01:03:43,074
And, uh, these.

709
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:46,779
- What is in the box, sir?
- The sweet nectar of the Napa Valley.

710
01:03:46,854 --> 01:03:49,084
- All the bottles are properly packed.
- I'm sorry, sir...

711
01:03:49,156 --> 01:03:52,717
but F.A.A. rules only allow you
to bring one bottle of wine in a travel bag.

712
01:03:52,793 --> 01:03:55,785
Beyond that, you have to make
special customs arrangements.

713
01:03:55,863 --> 01:03:59,060
These wines are scheduled
to be served in a competition in Paris.

714
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:02,261
I can't have them
jostled about in cargo.

715
01:04:02,336 --> 01:04:04,133
I'm so sorry.

716
01:04:04,205 --> 01:04:05,467
Excuse me.

717
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:08,134
A lot of people waiting.

718
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,705
Sorry, sir.

719
01:04:13,481 --> 01:04:17,474
People, can I have
your attention, please?

720
01:04:17,552 --> 01:04:21,454
Who in this line is going
to Paris on Flight 349?

721
01:04:23,157 --> 01:04:25,591
Guten Morgen.

722
01:04:30,031 --> 01:04:34,491
Ja.

723
01:04:34,569 --> 01:04:37,003
They can each carry one.

724
01:04:37,071 --> 01:04:39,904
Hello, everybody.
My name is Bo.

725
01:04:39,974 --> 01:04:42,442
My family runs a small
vineyard here in Napa.

726
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:44,637
- Is your last name Gallo?
- God forbid.

727
01:04:44,712 --> 01:04:46,680
No, sir. It's Barrett.
The French have invited...

728
01:04:46,747 --> 01:04:48,942
certain American vintners...

729
01:04:49,016 --> 01:04:51,780
to compete in a tasting in Paris.

730
01:04:51,852 --> 01:04:53,877
I am technically not French.

731
01:04:59,427 --> 01:05:01,827
You think you can beat the French?

732
01:05:01,896 --> 01:05:04,262
We don't know, but we, uh-

733
01:05:04,332 --> 01:05:06,630
we certainly want a chance to try.

734
01:05:06,701 --> 01:05:09,932
The only problem is we can't
get our wine there without your help.

735
01:05:10,004 --> 01:05:14,134
See, I'm only allowed to carry on
one bottle of wine, and I brought twenty-f-

736
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:19,976
uh, 26 bottles of wine back to Paris without
them being shaken or bumped around.

737
01:05:20,047 --> 01:05:22,277
Will anybody carry a bottle for me?

738
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:24,841
I'll take one.
And so will my husband.

739
01:05:24,919 --> 01:05:26,853
I'm always proud
to help a bellwether.

740
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:29,481
I'll take one. I'll carry one for you. Sure.

741
01:05:29,557 --> 01:05:31,320
Okay.

742
01:05:33,194 --> 01:05:36,561
- Thank you so much.
- My granddaddy made hooch during prohibition.

743
01:05:36,631 --> 01:05:38,826
Marvelous.

744
01:05:38,899 --> 01:05:41,129
Treat these bottles with care,
everybody.

745
01:05:41,202 --> 01:05:43,193
- Thank you.
- I know I speak on behalf...

746
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:45,966
of all vintners in Napa Valley
when I say thank you.

747
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,009
And I'll meet you all
outside customs in Paris.

748
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,414
- Well done.
- Cheers.

749
01:05:54,482 --> 01:05:56,416
Safe flight.

750
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,351
Hi.

751
01:06:42,763 --> 01:06:44,856
Oh, God.

752
01:06:44,932 --> 01:06:46,763
Someone die?

753
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:54,199
- Yes!
- We are not gonna participate.

754
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:59,404
What are you talking about? Even after
everything you said to him, he picked our wine.

755
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:04,417
- That means something, Dad.
- Yeah, it means he thinks I'm a sucker.

756
01:07:04,485 --> 01:07:07,147
- Oh, Je-
- Hey. That contest is, what, two weeks from now?

757
01:07:07,221 --> 01:07:09,314
- Yeah.
- Whatever we do to get our bottles there...

758
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:11,324
they won't show well.
That's guaranteed.

759
01:07:14,895 --> 01:07:17,796
Wine's in Paris.

760
01:07:17,865 --> 01:07:21,096
I went to the airport
and had each bottle hand-carried.

761
01:07:25,106 --> 01:07:28,337
- You gave him my wine?
- No, I gave him our wine.

762
01:07:28,409 --> 01:07:30,969
- I told you not to.
- You were being pigheaded.

763
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:37,340
Pack your bags.

764
01:07:38,686 --> 01:07:40,677
You're outta here, kid.

765
01:07:43,023 --> 01:07:45,014
You're kicking me out.

766
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,251
I'm firing you.

767
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:07,707
Rock]

768
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:16,815
# Keep on driving me, baby #

769
01:08:50,157 --> 01:08:52,148
Dad?

770
01:08:57,464 --> 01:08:59,022
There he is.

771
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:02,330
What the hell's going on?

772
01:09:02,403 --> 01:09:05,895
The prodigal son come to
have a laugh at his father.

773
01:09:05,973 --> 01:09:08,271
I'm leaving.

774
01:09:10,945 --> 01:09:12,936
And there's nothing left to leave.

775
01:09:18,452 --> 01:09:19,942
Yeah, you're not the first.

776
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:21,851
I'm gonna call Sam.

777
01:09:21,922 --> 01:09:24,789
She'll help you upstairs
and clean this shit up.

778
01:09:24,859 --> 01:09:27,020
- Hey. Take this bottle.
- I don't want the bottle.

779
01:09:27,094 --> 01:09:28,561
- Take the bottle.
- I don't want the bottle!

780
01:09:28,629 --> 01:09:31,097
Take the bottle and look at it
in the sunshine.

781
01:09:56,924 --> 01:09:58,915
Why is it brown?

782
01:10:00,661 --> 01:10:03,255
Every bottle in this room is brown.

783
01:10:04,832 --> 01:10:08,131
Every single bottle.

784
01:10:08,202 --> 01:10:11,729
Maybe Gustavo was right.
Maybe-

785
01:10:13,807 --> 01:10:17,208
Maybe you gotta grow up
with dirt under your finger.

786
01:10:17,278 --> 01:10:19,974
I don't - I don't know.

787
01:10:20,047 --> 01:10:22,447
No.

788
01:10:22,516 --> 01:10:24,916
You made this wine perfectly.

789
01:10:30,891 --> 01:10:32,256
It tastes fine.

790
01:10:32,326 --> 01:10:34,317
Yes, it does.

791
01:10:34,394 --> 01:10:36,487
'Cause we made...

792
01:10:36,563 --> 01:10:38,793
buttery...

793
01:10:38,866 --> 01:10:41,357
beautifully layered...

794
01:10:43,437 --> 01:10:46,372
beautifully balanced chardonnay.

795
01:10:48,008 --> 01:10:51,705
And it's brown.
Brown, brown, brown.

796
01:10:57,384 --> 01:11:00,285
Now I gotta find a guy
who can haul away 500 cases of wine...

797
01:11:00,354 --> 01:11:02,345
because I can't stand
to look at this...

798
01:11:02,422 --> 01:11:04,322
shit...

799
01:11:04,391 --> 01:11:06,552
anymore.

800
01:11:09,196 --> 01:11:11,130
Get outta here.

801
01:11:19,239 --> 01:11:23,039
The French flag is a bit more prominent
than the American flag, isn't it?

802
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,101
Well spotted, Maurice.
Life isn't fair.

803
01:11:25,179 --> 01:11:29,639
Could you grab me a Bâtard-Montrachet
and a Chambertin from the cellar?

804
01:11:38,992 --> 01:11:41,790
Do you see them?
They're on the left.

805
01:11:49,336 --> 01:11:51,861
Wine the color of shit.

806
01:11:53,307 --> 01:11:55,298
Interesting.

807
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:04,740
Hey.

808
01:12:04,818 --> 01:12:08,584
Rich, full-bodied...
and brown.

809
01:12:11,191 --> 01:12:13,853
- Does it taste brown too?
- No.

810
01:12:13,927 --> 01:12:15,758
There's someone we need to go see.

811
01:12:15,829 --> 01:12:18,024
- Come on. Give me the keys.
- Where we goin'

812
01:12:18,098 --> 01:12:20,032
Get in the car, Bo.

813
01:12:34,882 --> 01:12:37,316
Well, it's always hard to know what went wrong.

814
01:12:37,384 --> 01:12:40,820
So many things can happen. But once it's
in the bottle there's nothing you can do.

815
01:12:40,888 --> 01:12:42,856
It's probably oxidized.

816
01:12:42,923 --> 01:12:45,153
The taste becomes metallic.

817
01:12:45,225 --> 01:12:47,284
But that's just it.
The wine tastes fine.

818
01:12:47,361 --> 01:12:51,161
And my father's a perfectionist.
No air touches the wine after it's in the barrels.

819
01:12:53,967 --> 01:12:56,231
Did you bring a bottle?

820
01:13:08,048 --> 01:13:10,608
I've read about it,
but I've never seen it.

821
01:13:10,684 --> 01:13:14,085
You can make a wine too perfectly.

822
01:13:14,154 --> 01:13:17,851
This reductionist technique, excluding as much
oxygen as possible from the process...

823
01:13:17,925 --> 01:13:19,916
after fermentation,
is the best way to make chardonnay.

824
01:13:19,993 --> 01:13:23,986
- Yeah, but- - But there's a natural
browning enzyme in white wine...

825
01:13:24,064 --> 01:13:27,522
an enzyme that's neutralized if it comes
into contact with even a tiny bit of oxygen.

826
01:13:27,601 --> 01:13:28,829
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

827
01:13:28,902 --> 01:13:31,166
If no oxygen gets in...

828
01:13:31,238 --> 01:13:35,174
which is practically impossible,
a brown discoloration occurs in the bottle.

829
01:13:35,242 --> 01:13:38,609
But it's only temporary. Perils of perfection.

830
01:13:38,679 --> 01:13:41,113
So what do we do?

831
01:13:41,181 --> 01:13:43,775
Mmm. My understanding is
it only lasts a couple days.

832
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:45,784
I'll bet by morning, back to normal.

833
01:13:45,852 --> 01:13:47,979
- Wait. You're sure?
- Yeah.

834
01:13:48,055 --> 01:13:49,989
Absolutely. It tastes great.

835
01:13:50,057 --> 01:13:52,048
- Thank you, sir. Go.
- All right. We gotta go.

836
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:54,116
- Keep the bottle!
- Thank you.

837
01:13:58,432 --> 01:14:00,798
No. No, no, no.

838
01:14:00,867 --> 01:14:02,858
What's that?

839
01:14:14,381 --> 01:14:16,372
Come on.

840
01:14:18,919 --> 01:14:22,912
- Gas would have been good.
- Yeah.

841
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:25,481
Hey.
Slow down. Come on.

842
01:14:28,161 --> 01:14:31,028
All right, Chevy. Huh?

843
01:14:31,098 --> 01:14:34,864
Wanna stop for
just a second? Hey. Hey.

844
01:14:34,935 --> 01:14:36,425
Come on.

845
01:14:36,503 --> 01:14:38,027
Hey, come on!

846
01:14:38,105 --> 01:14:40,198
Hop out for just a sec, please?

847
01:14:40,273 --> 01:14:42,833
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

848
01:14:42,909 --> 01:14:45,173
Your decency, people?

849
01:14:49,416 --> 01:14:52,579
- Sometimes it's about technique.
- Oh.

850
01:14:54,654 --> 01:14:56,884
Can't you help?

851
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:06,055
- Oops.
- Hello, ma'am.

852
01:15:06,133 --> 01:15:10,263
That kind of indecent exposure
is illegal and improper.

853
01:15:10,337 --> 01:15:14,273
Excuse me. Officer. Officer. Uh, we need to
make a phone call. It's an emergency.

854
01:15:14,341 --> 01:15:16,741
- I'll call you a tow truck.
- Okay. That's it.

855
01:15:18,478 --> 01:15:21,504
Officer, I am being
improper and illegal.

856
01:15:21,581 --> 01:15:25,039
Could you please arrest me
and take us to a phone?

857
01:15:25,118 --> 01:15:27,518
Excuse me, Officer.
You, uh-

858
01:15:27,587 --> 01:15:29,578
Are you staring at her breasts?

859
01:15:29,656 --> 01:15:31,214
- I really think he is.
- I think you are.

860
01:15:31,291 --> 01:15:33,452
Okay, okay. I'll- I'll drive you.

861
01:15:33,527 --> 01:15:36,325
Just put your breasts away.

862
01:17:02,382 --> 01:17:04,873
Shenky!

863
01:17:04,951 --> 01:17:07,715
Shenky. My dad.
Where is he?

864
01:17:07,787 --> 01:17:11,245
Found the old battle armor.
Went to get his old job back.

865
01:17:11,324 --> 01:17:14,725
- Where's the chardonnay?
- Big truck came by this morning.

866
01:17:14,794 --> 01:17:18,890
Probably on the bottom
of Old Goose Lake Landfill by now.

867
01:17:37,851 --> 01:17:39,842
Jim?

868
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,911
This way.

869
01:17:44,457 --> 01:17:46,789
Hey. It's Jim.

870
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:48,851
Huh.

871
01:17:53,466 --> 01:17:57,266
- Bill's with a client. He'll be right in.
- Uh, wait.

872
01:17:57,337 --> 01:18:00,773
Marge, this is not a gift, but...

873
01:18:01,775 --> 01:18:04,266
could you put this behind your desk?

874
01:18:05,478 --> 01:18:09,073
- What's this?
- And if I ever...

875
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,184
get another wild hair up my butt...

876
01:18:12,252 --> 01:18:15,153
you can just hand me that bottle.

877
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:21,950
Jim, I am really sorry that things
didn't work out for you up north.

878
01:18:24,898 --> 01:18:28,129
- Uh-
- Oh, here.

879
01:18:42,549 --> 01:18:46,246
- Jim.
- Hey, Bill.

880
01:18:53,927 --> 01:18:56,589
When I was a kid, I had a dog.

881
01:18:56,663 --> 01:19:01,965
Just a scruffy little thing. Brown, one ear
sticking up. The other one flopping down.

882
01:19:02,035 --> 01:19:04,697
To me, that dog was a champion.

883
01:19:04,771 --> 01:19:07,706
But as much as I tried,
as much as I hoped...

884
01:19:07,774 --> 01:19:11,767
never so much as an honorable mention
at the school dog show.

885
01:19:11,845 --> 01:19:13,039
Huh.

886
01:19:13,113 --> 01:19:15,547
I loved that dog.

887
01:19:15,615 --> 01:19:17,810
But the world around me
didn't see what I saw.

888
01:19:17,884 --> 01:19:20,853
To them, Pudge was just a...

889
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,014
scruffy, brown dog.

890
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:31,292
So, this, uh, hobby
of yours didn't pan out.

891
01:19:31,364 --> 01:19:34,731
Well, I've talked to the other partners,
and, uh...

892
01:19:34,801 --> 01:19:37,326
we've agreed to have you back.

893
01:19:37,404 --> 01:19:39,395
But not as a partner.

894
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:43,509
Ah.

895
01:19:47,247 --> 01:19:49,613
I guess it's true.

896
01:19:51,318 --> 01:19:55,186
I am a loser.

897
01:19:57,223 --> 01:19:59,817
Yeah.
Probably right, but...

898
01:20:00,827 --> 01:20:03,159
you got a good heart.

899
01:20:05,165 --> 01:20:07,565
Well, so do you.

900
01:20:07,634 --> 01:20:09,625
I know.

901
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:16,735
No, I had, uh- I had open-heart
surgery when I was 12.

902
01:20:17,944 --> 01:20:21,107
And my mother
always told me that-

903
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:23,649
that my heart has a history and...

904
01:20:23,717 --> 01:20:25,685
that that's what makes it special.

905
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:31,056
Well, that and the scar that I have.

906
01:20:31,124 --> 01:20:34,252
So when the cop pulled over, you think it was the...

907
01:20:34,327 --> 01:20:36,625
breasts or the scar?

908
01:20:36,696 --> 01:20:39,221
I think it was the heart.

909
01:20:40,533 --> 01:20:42,467
Oh, come on.

910
01:20:42,535 --> 01:20:44,469
Looked like a breast man to me.

911
01:20:44,537 --> 01:20:47,267
Stop it.

912
01:20:51,845 --> 01:20:53,779
- Hey.
- Hey.

913
01:20:53,847 --> 01:20:55,781
Hey.

914
01:20:55,849 --> 01:20:58,545
Heard what happened.

915
01:20:59,619 --> 01:21:01,610
Sorry.

916
01:21:02,689 --> 01:21:04,680
You, uh...

917
01:21:04,758 --> 01:21:06,726
told your dad yet?

918
01:21:07,994 --> 01:21:10,326
- No.
- I mean, it'd kill him.

919
01:21:10,397 --> 01:21:15,027
500 cases of perfect wine...

920
01:21:15,101 --> 01:21:17,399
dumped.

921
01:21:18,405 --> 01:21:20,396
Blind taste test?

922
01:21:20,473 --> 01:21:23,340
Not for me, Joe.
I'm sticking with vodka.

923
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:26,470
- I'm not in the mood for it now.
- Come on, you guys.

924
01:21:26,546 --> 01:21:29,106
I bought a ton of
this stuff this afternoon.

925
01:21:29,182 --> 01:21:31,173
Tell me what you think.

926
01:21:45,498 --> 01:21:46,965
Go ahead.

927
01:21:56,743 --> 01:21:59,974
Bo, y-you gotta try this.

928
01:22:00,046 --> 01:22:02,310
Bo, this is the best...

929
01:22:02,382 --> 01:22:05,317
chardonnay I've ever tasted.

930
01:22:16,529 --> 01:22:18,224
Two guys stopped
in for a burger earlier.

931
01:22:18,298 --> 01:22:21,131
They had a bunch of wine
on its way to the dump...

932
01:22:21,201 --> 01:22:24,693
and they were wondering
if they could make a little extra cash...

933
01:22:24,771 --> 01:22:27,137
by recycling the bottles.

934
01:22:32,278 --> 01:22:34,906
Yeah. I'm a fan of recycling myself.

935
01:22:34,981 --> 01:22:37,040
I offered 'em a few bucks
to take care of it for 'em-

936
01:22:37,116 --> 01:22:39,641
in the name of ecology,
first and foremost.

937
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:43,314
- How much do you want for 'em?
- Just leave me a case.

938
01:22:44,657 --> 01:22:46,318
Bill, it's Bo.

939
01:22:46,392 --> 01:22:49,054
- Tell him I'll call him back.
- It's forJim.

940
01:22:49,128 --> 01:22:52,222
- Tell him I'll call him tomorrow.
- He says it's urgent, Jim.

941
01:22:54,968 --> 01:22:57,436
- Yeah.
- I am staring at...

942
01:22:57,504 --> 01:23:01,531
500 cases of golden-colored
Château Montelena.

943
01:23:04,744 --> 01:23:07,508
Dad.

944
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:09,571
Bo.

945
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:12,584
That's not funny.

946
01:23:12,652 --> 01:23:14,779
It turned back, Dad.

947
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:20,255
Dad?

948
01:23:20,326 --> 01:23:21,691
Marge. Marge.

949
01:23:21,761 --> 01:23:23,888
Give me-

950
01:23:25,498 --> 01:23:27,022
Oh.

951
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,226
Ho, oh, oh!

952
01:23:28,301 --> 01:23:29,893
Okay. Corkscrew.
You have a corkscrew?

953
01:23:29,969 --> 01:23:31,766
Does anybody have a corkscrew?

954
01:23:31,838 --> 01:23:34,602
Just a little-
Anybody have a corkscrew around here?

955
01:23:34,674 --> 01:23:36,039
Does anybody-

956
01:23:36,109 --> 01:23:38,134
This is a law office,
for criminy's sake.

957
01:23:38,211 --> 01:23:40,805
My God! Uh, just anything
that I could use?

958
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,279
Do you have any corkscrews?

959
01:23:42,348 --> 01:23:43,747
No?

960
01:23:43,816 --> 01:23:45,807
Hang on to this.

961
01:23:46,653 --> 01:23:49,281
Jesus! J- Jim.

962
01:23:50,823 --> 01:23:51,983
Marge.

963
01:23:52,058 --> 01:23:54,492
Give me that, honey. Clear.

964
01:23:54,561 --> 01:23:55,755
- Jim, Jim, Jim.
- Clear, clear!

965
01:23:55,828 --> 01:23:57,295
All right.

966
01:23:57,363 --> 01:23:59,297
Hee-yah! Ha!

967
01:23:59,365 --> 01:24:02,334
All right. Marge, give me a glass.

968
01:24:02,402 --> 01:24:04,063
- Here.
- Oh.

969
01:24:06,205 --> 01:24:08,196
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

970
01:24:15,214 --> 01:24:16,408
Baby!

971
01:24:16,482 --> 01:24:19,849
Oh. Marge. Marge!

972
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:23,916
Oh, my God.!
Taste that.

973
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:26,857
You'll wanna taste this.
Get a glass. Get a glass.

974
01:24:26,926 --> 01:24:30,828
Ah! You'll tell
your children about this wine!

975
01:24:30,897 --> 01:24:33,263
Oh, Jim.

976
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:35,460
That is some chardonnay.

977
01:24:35,535 --> 01:24:38,299
Yeah! Finish it up.
Finish it up, all of you.

978
01:24:38,371 --> 01:24:41,238
All right.
All right. Well-

979
01:24:41,307 --> 01:24:43,298
Enjoy the chardonnay.

980
01:24:52,518 --> 01:24:54,452
I don't understand.

981
01:24:56,222 --> 01:24:59,453
I don't see why we need to make
such a big deal out of this.

982
01:24:59,525 --> 01:25:02,517
Somebody has to go...

983
01:25:02,595 --> 01:25:04,722
to represent our interests.

984
01:25:04,797 --> 01:25:06,025
Jim.

985
01:25:06,099 --> 01:25:08,101
- I think it should beJim Barrett.
- I agree.

986
01:25:08,234 --> 01:25:09,963
Yeah. Yeah.

987
01:25:10,036 --> 01:25:11,298
I think so.

988
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:14,828
I think that my son, Bo, should go.

989
01:25:14,907 --> 01:25:17,137
Bo?

990
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:21,544
l-I don't know, Jim. l- I think we need someone
they're gonna look up to. No offense, Bo.

991
01:25:21,614 --> 01:25:24,549
My vineyard was on the ropes.

992
01:25:26,419 --> 01:25:28,387
Bo here brought it back.

993
01:25:29,455 --> 01:25:32,583
If it gets rough,
he can take the punches.

994
01:25:32,658 --> 01:25:34,592
My vote goes to Bo.

995
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:37,322
Does anybody have
any problem with that?

996
01:25:37,396 --> 01:25:39,728
Okay.

997
01:25:39,799 --> 01:25:41,164
So...

998
01:25:41,234 --> 01:25:44,670
Bo, you'll represent us?

999
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,414
Yes, I will, sir.

1000
01:25:56,482 --> 01:25:58,416
Proudly.

1001
01:25:58,484 --> 01:26:00,748
If one of us wins,
we all win, right?

1002
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:03,516
- Amen.
- That's the spirit.

1003
01:26:03,589 --> 01:26:08,720
Now, that, uh, plane ticket is gonna be, uh,
pretty pricey at this latejuncture.

1004
01:26:08,794 --> 01:26:11,627
So let's put it in the hat, boys.
Come on. Let's go.

1005
01:26:11,697 --> 01:26:13,858
Don't be shy, boys.
Step right up and fill the hat.

1006
01:26:13,933 --> 01:26:16,424
There you go. There you go.
Goodjob.

1007
01:26:16,502 --> 01:26:19,198
Thank you.
Thank you. Well done.

1008
01:26:19,272 --> 01:26:22,435
That's it, boys. Step right up.
Fill it up.

1009
01:26:22,508 --> 01:26:24,533
Right to the top.
There you go.

1010
01:26:44,797 --> 01:26:45,957
Need any help?

1011
01:26:46,032 --> 01:26:49,195
Uh, well, uh...

1012
01:26:49,268 --> 01:26:51,259
stacked all the chocks.

1013
01:26:52,538 --> 01:26:55,132
Uh, put all the fittings away,
coiled all the hoses.

1014
01:26:55,208 --> 01:26:57,904
Thanks, but I think
I have it covered.

1015
01:26:57,977 --> 01:27:00,104
Oh, shame, you know.

1016
01:27:00,179 --> 01:27:02,443
'Cause I was just, uh...

1017
01:27:02,515 --> 01:27:04,449
doing my nails.

1018
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,743
I wanted to say good-bye.

1019
01:27:09,956 --> 01:27:11,947
You know, in case
I don't see you tomorrow.

1020
01:27:14,093 --> 01:27:16,084
Thanks.

1021
01:27:17,964 --> 01:27:19,955
Uh, well, night.

1022
01:27:23,936 --> 01:27:27,099
Good luck.
Not just for Montelena.

1023
01:27:27,173 --> 01:27:29,471
For Napa.

1024
01:27:29,542 --> 01:27:31,339
That's a lot of luck.

1025
01:27:32,478 --> 01:27:35,777
That's why it was a kiss
and not a handshake.

1026
01:27:37,316 --> 01:27:39,784
I could use another one.

1027
01:27:39,852 --> 01:27:43,948
Seeing as how there are
12 vineyards involved.

1028
01:28:14,553 --> 01:28:16,487
Where'd you get this?

1029
01:28:16,555 --> 01:28:19,183
- Joe's.
- Fair and square?

1030
01:28:19,258 --> 01:28:23,251
Oh, yeah.
Man, she pulls out a 1950...

1031
01:28:23,329 --> 01:28:28,062
Château Latour
Pauillac Bordeaux blend.

1032
01:28:28,134 --> 01:28:30,193
- Oh, yeah.
- I wish I could've seen that.

1033
01:28:30,269 --> 01:28:32,260
Yeah.

1034
01:28:32,338 --> 01:28:35,830
- It's too much.
- No, no, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.

1035
01:28:35,908 --> 01:28:38,433
Good luck out there.

1036
01:28:38,511 --> 01:28:41,708
You know,
thanks for representing us.

1037
01:28:45,651 --> 01:28:47,585
Gustavo.

1038
01:28:48,654 --> 01:28:51,214
- Hey, Jim.
- You know...

1039
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:55,784
there's a few things around here
that I could use some help with.

1040
01:28:58,064 --> 01:28:59,998
You, uh...

1041
01:29:00,066 --> 01:29:02,694
offering me my job back?

1042
01:29:04,603 --> 01:29:06,594
Yeah. Am I driving you or not?

1043
01:29:06,672 --> 01:29:10,233
Yeah. We're going.
We're going. I'm driving.

1044
01:29:10,309 --> 01:29:14,075
No. No, you're not.

1045
01:29:45,277 --> 01:29:47,302
Bonjour.

1046
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:49,974
Excuse me. I'm, uh-

1047
01:29:50,049 --> 01:29:52,313
Monsieur Barrett!
Monsieur Barrett!

1048
01:29:52,385 --> 01:29:54,751
- Monsieur Barrett. Monsieur Barrett.
- Bonjour.

1049
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:55,809
- Yeah, bonjour, bonjour.
- Oui.

1050
01:29:55,888 --> 01:29:57,185
- Oui.
- Bonjour, bonjour.

1051
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,694
Don't worry about it, kid.
I speak American.

1052
01:30:03,763 --> 01:30:06,596
- Oh, thank God.
- You look kinda young to have your own vineyard.

1053
01:30:06,665 --> 01:30:09,657
Maybe that's why your wine is brown.

1054
01:30:09,735 --> 01:30:13,102
My wine is not brown.
Please tell me it's not brown.

1055
01:30:23,716 --> 01:30:24,842
Voilà.

1056
01:30:24,917 --> 01:30:27,715
So, what do you think?

1057
01:30:27,787 --> 01:30:30,654
Where's the press?

1058
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:34,883
One reporter? That's it?

1059
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:40,489
One great journalist
is worth a dozen hacks, Bo.

1060
01:30:40,566 --> 01:30:42,500
- What's his name?
- Who?

1061
01:30:42,568 --> 01:30:45,230
The great wine journalist.

1062
01:30:45,304 --> 01:30:47,795
George Taber.

1063
01:30:47,873 --> 01:30:50,535
George Taber?

1064
01:30:50,609 --> 01:30:54,409
He, uh, rarely takes credit.
Come on.

1065
01:31:12,631 --> 01:31:15,964
Here's the wine list
and the corresponding numbers.

1066
01:31:16,035 --> 01:31:19,903
The numbers were picked randomly,
so nobody knows which number is which.

1067
01:31:24,276 --> 01:31:26,642
It's a big responsibility, George.

1068
01:31:26,712 --> 01:31:28,771
Yeah. I got it.

1069
01:31:28,848 --> 01:31:30,782
I got it.

1070
01:31:45,831 --> 01:31:47,560
Bonjour. Ça va?

1071
01:31:58,844 --> 01:32:01,244
Okay. Allons-y.! Let's go. Let's go.

1072
01:32:02,848 --> 01:32:04,975
Let's go. You're not a teamster,
you know.

1073
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:07,883
Mesdames et messieurs, bonjour.

1074
01:32:58,304 --> 01:33:00,397
It looks like a tough bunch.

1075
01:33:00,472 --> 01:33:03,134
Best palates in the business.

1076
01:33:26,532 --> 01:33:29,194
What's he saying?

1077
01:33:29,268 --> 01:33:32,362
Where I come from,
they call it a left-handed compliment.

1078
01:33:32,438 --> 01:33:34,906
But I don't think they have
a name for it in England.

1079
01:33:34,974 --> 01:33:36,908
It's too embedded in their culture.

1080
01:35:02,194 --> 01:35:04,185
Hmm.

1081
01:35:12,805 --> 01:35:15,137
- Hmm.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

1082
01:35:34,393 --> 01:35:36,691
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1083
01:35:36,762 --> 01:35:39,754
- Maurice, wh-
- They seem to be confused.

1084
01:35:46,572 --> 01:35:48,164
Confused about what?

1085
01:35:50,242 --> 01:35:51,869
About which wines are French...

1086
01:35:53,445 --> 01:35:54,969
and which ones are yours.

1087
01:36:44,496 --> 01:36:45,986
Merci.

1088
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:50,068
Merci.

1089
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,640
One.

1090
01:37:04,716 --> 01:37:06,707
Puligny-Montrachet.

1091
01:37:06,785 --> 01:37:09,117
- Two.
- Meursault Charmes.

1092
01:37:11,757 --> 01:37:14,225
- Three.
- Chalone Vineyards.

1093
01:37:17,396 --> 01:37:20,194
- Four?
- Château Montelena.

1094
01:38:06,912 --> 01:38:09,972
- I'm glad you could come.
- Thanks.

1095
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:14,678
No matter what happens,
no matter what is said, stand tall.

1096
01:38:14,753 --> 01:38:17,017
Now...

1097
01:38:17,089 --> 01:38:19,114
do you have anything
decent to wear...

1098
01:38:19,191 --> 01:38:21,125
and perhaps a comb in here?

1099
01:38:21,193 --> 01:38:24,788
- Yeah, I think.
- Change.

1100
01:39:26,258 --> 01:39:28,818
We won?

1101
01:39:41,173 --> 01:39:43,107
A stunning success. Stop.

1102
01:39:43,175 --> 01:39:45,837
Took first place
with le premier cru. Stop.

1103
01:39:47,479 --> 01:39:51,210
Yeah.

1104
01:39:51,283 --> 01:39:53,274
Who is this?

1105
01:39:54,319 --> 01:39:57,686
- TIME magazine?
- TIME magazine?

1106
01:39:57,756 --> 01:39:59,724
TIME magazine, man!

1107
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:01,725
Well, yeah, I guess, you know...

1108
01:40:01,793 --> 01:40:04,455
if you want to,
you can take a picture of me, but I'm...

1109
01:40:04,529 --> 01:40:06,532
really not that pretty.

1110
01:40:06,665 --> 01:40:08,792
A statement?
Uh, I don't know.

1111
01:40:08,867 --> 01:40:12,496
I suppose, um-
I guess, uh-

1112
01:40:12,571 --> 01:40:15,438
I'd have to say that...

1113
01:40:15,507 --> 01:40:19,671
it's not bad
for kids from the sticks.

1114
01:40:19,745 --> 01:40:21,872
Yeah. Not too bad.

1115
01:40:24,616 --> 01:40:26,607
"Not bad for kids from the sticks."

1116
01:40:26,685 --> 01:40:28,619
- It's from California?
- Mm-hmm.

1117
01:40:28,687 --> 01:40:30,279
- Château Montelena.
- It won?

1118
01:40:30,355 --> 01:40:32,289
It won. Excuse me.

1119
01:40:32,357 --> 01:40:35,952
May we have a bottle of the '73
Montelena chardonnay, please?

1120
01:40:36,028 --> 01:40:40,465
No, sir. We do not carry it, but you are
the eighth person to ask for it within the hour.

1121
01:40:41,567 --> 01:40:43,797
Hi. I'd like to buy
a bottle of the, uh...

1122
01:40:43,869 --> 01:40:46,337
- '73-
- Montelena chardonnay.

1123
01:40:46,405 --> 01:40:49,738
- Yes.
- Why is everyone asking for the same wine?

1124
01:41:02,487 --> 01:41:04,478
- Salud.
- Salud.

1125
01:41:29,881 --> 01:41:31,872
- You okay, pally?
- Well...

1126
01:41:33,218 --> 01:41:35,152
I'm a pariah
among the cavistes...

1127
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:38,451
and persona non grata
to the vintners.

1128
01:41:39,725 --> 01:41:41,283
Well, I guess it could be worse.

1129
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,351
No.

1130
01:41:45,797 --> 01:41:49,392
We have shattered the myth...

1131
01:41:49,468 --> 01:41:52,369
of the invincible French vine.

1132
01:41:52,437 --> 01:41:54,962
And...

1133
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,031
not just in California.

1134
01:41:58,810 --> 01:42:01,643
We've opened the eyes of the world.

1135
01:42:01,713 --> 01:42:05,513
And you know what I say?
I say amen to that, brother.

1136
01:42:05,584 --> 01:42:07,711
You mark my words.

1137
01:42:07,786 --> 01:42:10,778
We'll be drinking wines from...

1138
01:42:11,790 --> 01:42:14,156
well, South America.

1139
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:17,490
Australia. New Zealand.

1140
01:42:18,664 --> 01:42:20,598
Africa. India.

1141
01:42:21,833 --> 01:42:23,323
China.

1142
01:42:25,537 --> 01:42:28,131
This is not the end, Maurice.

1143
01:42:29,708 --> 01:42:32,233
This is just the beginning.

1144
01:42:42,187 --> 01:42:46,089
Welcome to the future.

1145
01:42:47,159 --> 01:42:49,354
A'salùte.

1146
01:43:07,345 --> 01:43:11,748
# Don't you feel it growin'
day by day #

1147
01:43:11,817 --> 01:43:15,548
# People gettin'ready
for the news #

1148
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:18,020
# Some are happy #

1149
01:43:18,090 --> 01:43:20,650
# Some are sad #

1150
01:43:20,726 --> 01:43:24,093
# Whoa, we got to let
the music play #

1151
01:43:25,097 --> 01:43:27,292
Oh.

1152
01:43:28,834 --> 01:43:30,825
We did it.

1153
01:43:30,902 --> 01:43:33,462
We did.

1154
01:43:33,538 --> 01:43:35,403
Now we gotta do it again.

1155
01:43:36,875 --> 01:43:39,241
And it's not gonna be any easier.

1156
01:43:39,311 --> 01:43:42,610
Nope.

1157
01:43:45,684 --> 01:43:47,618
I heard a wise man once say...

1158
01:43:47,686 --> 01:43:50,621
we're all a little stronger
in the broken places.

1159
01:43:52,591 --> 01:43:55,458
# Oh, we're gonna dance
our blues away #

1160
01:43:55,527 --> 01:43:56,789
Sam around?

1161
01:43:56,862 --> 01:43:58,591
She's down there.

1162
01:44:03,001 --> 01:44:04,696
- Yeah!
- # Whoa, Listen to the music #

1163
01:44:04,770 --> 01:44:08,137
# Listen to the music
Listen to the music, Whoa #

1164
01:44:08,206 --> 01:44:10,868
# Listen to the music
Listen to the music #

1165
01:44:10,942 --> 01:44:16,005
# Listen to the music
all the time #

1166
01:44:18,116 --> 01:44:20,710
# Whoa ##

1167
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:41,626
- # Wine, wine, wine #

1168
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:44,760
- # Wine, wine, wine #

1169
01:45:44,836 --> 01:45:47,464
- # Wine, wine, wine #

1170
01:45:47,539 --> 01:45:50,201
- # Wine, wine, wine #

1171
01:45:50,275 --> 01:45:52,937
- # Wine, wine, wine #
- # Oh, boy #

1172
01:45:53,011 --> 01:45:55,377
# Pass that bottle to me #

1173
01:45:56,882 --> 01:45:59,942
# If you want to get along
in New Orleans town #

1174
01:46:00,018 --> 01:46:02,646
# Buy some wine
and pass it all around #

1175
01:46:02,721 --> 01:46:05,383
# Age runs up 49 #

1176
01:46:05,457 --> 01:46:07,925
# All those cats
they love sweet wine #

1177
01:46:07,993 --> 01:46:10,553
# Drinkin'wine spo-dee-o-dee
Drink wine #

1178
01:46:10,629 --> 01:46:13,723
# Oh, wine spo-dee-o-dee
Drink wine #

1179
01:46:13,798 --> 01:46:16,460
# Wine spo-dee-o-dee
Drink wine #

1180
01:46:16,534 --> 01:46:18,593
# Pass that bottle to me ##
