1
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:24,991
Hows it look?

2
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:27,227
Like another New Mexican shithole.

3
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,598
A perfect spot for a nest.

4
00:01:35,902 --> 00:01:38,204
Lets hit it.

5
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,009
All right. Gio.

6
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,891
- Everything set?
- Ready, boss.

7
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,933
We think weve got a nest inside this place.

8
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:26,724
Figure on at least six goons,
maybe more.

9
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,765
Chances are well find a master.

10
00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:31,521
Rule number 5: If you find the nest,
you find the master.

11
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,445
He wont leave it on its own.

12
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,128
It is strictly by the book today gentlemen.
Questions?

13
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:41,731
Lets get to work.

14
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:43,771
- Ill do it, boss.
- My turn.

15
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:03,079
Anthony.

16
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:06,764
Easy with that door.
Slow and easy.

17
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:08,206
Sorry, boss.

18
00:07:10,224 --> 00:07:11,271
Jesus!

19
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:20,676
- What was that?
- I dont know.

20
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:30,915
Wake you up, Montoya?

21
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:34,370
Relax. Dead body.
Bled out and cold. Been here a while.

22
00:07:34,444 --> 00:07:36,548
Dead body.
Bled out and cold.

23
00:07:37,196 --> 00:07:39,050
Suck it up.

24
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,626
- Get her off!
- Hold your fire!

25
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:57,726
Now fire!

26
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:08,916
- What?
- I dont know. Hang on.

27
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:13,973
Whats going on in there?

28
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:20,022
Deyo, dont leave me hanging.
What`ss going on?

29
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,459
We got a live one.
Female goon.

30
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:26,040
Well save her for you.

31
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:31,604
Open wide.

32
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:43,095
Stick her!

33
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:47,988
Take her!

34
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:54,167
- We got a fish! Go!
- Go for Montoya.

35
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:01,398
Were losing him!

36
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:03,056
Reload.

37
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:11,316
Shit!

38
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:19,282
- Catlin!
- Safety on.

39
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:20,974
- Got it?
- Clear!

40
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:26,951
Oh, Lord.

41
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:37,483
Reload.

42
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:44,496
Come on. Right here.

43
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:49,966
Die!

44
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,205
Fucking die! Die!

45
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:05,963
Not only ugly, he smells bad.

46
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,266
Give me the radio.

47
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,471
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah, boss.

48
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,541
Weve got another one. He`ss dead.
Send in the cable. We`lll hook him up.

49
00:11:13,613 --> 00:11:15,139
Give me a minute.

50
00:11:16,652 --> 00:11:19,303
May her souI and all the souls
of the faithful departed...

51
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:21,924
with the mercy of God
rest in peace.

52
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:23,370
Amen.

53
00:11:33,098 --> 00:11:35,432
Nothing like a little head,
eh, Padre?

54
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,618
Okay, boys, time to mop it up.

55
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:50,589
Deyo, Ortega, Bambi, upstairs.

56
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:53,564
Catlin, Anthony and Davis, basement.

57
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:14,332
Enjoy the barbecue, baby.

58
00:12:57,342 --> 00:13:00,375
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

59
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:01,939
nine!

60
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:05,242
Goons, man! Thats not
a bad day`ss work.

61
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:08,789
- Thats my lucky number.
- You`rre the man.

62
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:13,042
What is it, Jack?
Is something wrong?

63
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:15,930
Yeah. Where was the master?

64
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,296
- Want us to check the house again?
- Hes not there.

65
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:23,407
Do you suppose theres
another nest somewhere?

66
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:27,574
Sure as hell better not be.

67
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:29,583
All right, lets get out of here.

68
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:14,830
Thank you for your help.

69
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:18,826
Ive spent the last two weeks running
whores and buying liquor for this bunch.

70
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:21,800
- When the hell they gonna leave?
- Were clearing out tomorrow.

71
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:24,207
I cant say I`mm sorry to hear it.

72
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:28,495
You get that package from us?

73
00:14:28,561 --> 00:14:31,343
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good. Then youre happy.

74
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:33,318
You all work together?

75
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:35,082
Thats right.

76
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:37,006
What do you do?

77
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:38,794
We kill vampires.

78
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:41,645
I briefed Rome. Theyre wiring a payment
to the Monterey account.

79
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:45,126
Cardinal Alba is flying into Santa Fe.
He wants to meet with you tomorrow.

80
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,737
- Tomorrows my day off.
- Jack, not anymore.

81
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,871
Listen, what do you figure happened
to the master?

82
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:54,915
I dont know.

83
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:57,640
The master wont usually leave a nest
filled with goons.

84
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:00,839
What says hes still in New Mexico?
He could be anywhere by now.

85
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:03,908
Why would he run? Its not like
he knew we were coming.

86
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,249
Really, what do you guys do?

87
00:15:06,316 --> 00:15:09,185
Im not kidding.
We kill vampires.

88
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,779
Catlin, tell the lady what we do
for a living.

89
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:16,160
Kill vampires. Hunt them down,
kick the shit out of them.

90
00:15:18,345 --> 00:15:19,555
Right.

91
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:23,487
I know how you feel, baby.
Nobody believes in vampires.

92
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:28,000
The thing is, we know vampires
are stalking the earth.

93
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:30,079
We also know theres a God.

94
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:32,356
We just dont understand Him.

95
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:35,453
Nice party.

96
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:38,273
Yeah.

97
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:43,070
Youve got something
other than me on your mind.

98
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:47,076
Feel like telling me about it?

99
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:50,847
I was looking for something today.
I didnt find it.

100
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,194
That can be a real pain in the ass.

101
00:16:01,155 --> 00:16:03,872
Maybe you should try looking
somewhere else.

102
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:08,061
I can tell you where
you might want to start.

103
00:16:09,186 --> 00:16:10,560
Youre right.

104
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:15,513
I shouldve been looking
in a whole different place.

105
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:22,015
Why dont you get me something
to drink...

106
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,877
and we can meet
back in your room.

107
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:35,481
Thats the first good idea
I`vve heard today.

108
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:21,425
Deyo, give me a couple beers.

109
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:28,108
You are magnificent!
Have I ever told you that?

110
00:17:28,183 --> 00:17:31,030
- You better slow down, Padre.
- No, no. Im not drunk.

111
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:33,462
Really? Are you on acid?

112
00:18:04,658 --> 00:18:06,512
Doesnt it feel beautiful?

113
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:08,911
Something youll never forget.

114
00:18:09,873 --> 00:18:11,978
I know I wont.

115
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:28,458
I think were out of beer.

116
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:31,974
I think we ought to knock over
a liquor store.

117
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:34,566
Why not?
I dont give a shit anymore.

118
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:41,060
I got beer.

119
00:18:41,132 --> 00:18:43,271
I got beer in the other room.

120
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:46,657
Fucking people. I dont know why
I gotta take care of everybody.

121
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:53,249
And you. You dont go anywhere.

122
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:55,559
I got plans for you.

123
00:20:27,774 --> 00:20:29,814
Jack Crow.

124
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,270
- Wait. The pickup.
- Keys!

125
00:21:02,457 --> 00:21:04,431
Come on! Come with me.

126
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:07,695
Did he bite you?

127
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:10,550
Wait. Wait. I can use you.

128
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:11,989
Come on!

129
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:15,056
Leave the bitch. Shes dead anyway.

130
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:17,428
Take her. I can use her. Go!

131
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:27,307
Step on it, goddamn it!

132
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:32,628
- Hit it!
- Im going!

133
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:43,498
- Hes right behind us!
- Come on, go!

134
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,908
Shoot him!

135
00:22:57,736 --> 00:22:59,296
You okay?

136
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:08,028
Can you walk?

137
00:23:08,998 --> 00:23:10,908
You alive? Come on.

138
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:16,192
- What are you doing?
- Shes going with us.

139
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:20,545
- He just bit her.
- She hasnt turned yet. Come on.

140
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:22,467
Shes on her way.

141
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:25,347
Its under 48 hours. The telepathic
link with the master won`tt hold.

142
00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:28,412
So what? After that shes going
to start receiving his thoughts.

143
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:30,425
- Seeing what he sees.
- Exactly.

144
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,809
Like a surveillance camera, so we can
find him and shove a stake up his ass!

145
00:23:34,883 --> 00:23:38,396
Im gonna use this piece of shit to get
to the master and to who tipped him off.

146
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:40,954
We were set up.
He knew my fucking name.

147
00:23:42,498 --> 00:23:44,385
- Who the fuck set us up?
- I dont know.

148
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:46,870
But I want the son of a bitch.
Can you walk?

149
00:23:46,945 --> 00:23:50,043
Wake up! Can you walk?
Are you with me?

150
00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:52,406
Come on!

151
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,367
Do you hear me? Well?

152
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:57,945
Fuck, yes. This aint my first time
to dance. Let`ss go.

153
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,750
Hey, cowboy.

154
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,196
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Im gonna borrow your car.

155
00:25:51,696 --> 00:25:54,216
- Just say, "Help yourself. `
- Say what?

156
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:58,541
Shut up or Ill blow your teeth
out the back of your head! Back off!

157
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:01,261
Help yourself.

158
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,530
Much obliged, partner.

159
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:18,506
Get in!

160
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,251
Take her to Apache Springs,
Plaza HoteI.

161
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:02,464
Hole up there.
Ill find you as soon as I can.

162
00:27:03,174 --> 00:27:05,312
Dump this thing and take the jeep.

163
00:27:05,381 --> 00:27:08,414
- You cant bury them all.
- Get going.

164
00:27:08,485 --> 00:27:10,175
I need to talk to you.

165
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:12,000
Were wasting time.

166
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:15,843
Rule number 7:
Never bury a team member by yourself.

167
00:27:15,908 --> 00:27:19,420
- This comes under special circumstances.
- The whole teams been slaughtered!

168
00:27:19,491 --> 00:27:22,557
- I can handle it!
- Bullshit! You know better!

169
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:27,608
Got any ideas?

170
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:31,424
Yeah. Kill the whore, bury the team
together and head back to Monterey.

171
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:42,139
- If you want to pull out, go ahead.
- I didnt say that.

172
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,338
Somebodys changed the rules.
We gotta do whatever it takes.

173
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:47,512
Less than 11 hours
until the sun goes down.

174
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,452
If youve got something else to say,
spit it out!

175
00:27:50,526 --> 00:27:53,973
Yeah, Ive got something else to say.
Don`tt take too fucking long!

176
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,204
I get nervous when youre not around.

177
00:31:25,088 --> 00:31:26,942
I need a room.

178
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:29,942
- For how long?
- A few days.

179
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:33,244
Its $375 a week...

180
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:36,126
plus $25 for your cable TV.

181
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,229
Whats the fucking total?

182
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:45,433
Its $400.
Is that your girlfriend?

183
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:48,315
No, its my fucking mother.
Give me the key.

184
00:31:56,636 --> 00:31:58,937
Come on. Take my arm.

185
00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:08,851
Wake up, will you?
Lets go.

186
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:13,719
Jack Crow.
Cerritos and 14th in Santa Fe.

187
00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:15,672
Need immediate pickup.

188
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,870
None of them.

189
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,310
Im alone.

190
00:32:21,496 --> 00:32:22,870
Dead.

191
00:32:23,864 --> 00:32:27,573
Sources close to fhe investigation
report all bodies were decapifated.

192
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:29,493
The remains of the heads...

193
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,925
were found buried a mile away
from the murder scene.

194
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,478
The number of confirmed dead
now stands af 19...

195
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,884
with police still combing the ruins
of the motel.

196
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,878
Well be standing by all day
to bring you any further updafes.

197
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:29,965
Forget it.

198
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,323
Ah, Jack.

199
00:33:39,341 --> 00:33:41,991
Come.
Please sit down.

200
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:48,424
Whos this?

201
00:33:49,452 --> 00:33:51,840
This is Father Adam Guiteau.

202
00:33:51,915 --> 00:33:54,632
Father Adam is in charge
of our archives.

203
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,073
A bookworm.

204
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,800
Hes completely familiar with
all your activities, so speak freely.

205
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:04,200
Tell me what happened.

206
00:34:06,537 --> 00:34:09,057
We cleaned out the nest
near Fort Union.

207
00:34:09,128 --> 00:34:12,477
That night, a master showed up.
No master was ever like this.

208
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:15,072
Superhuman strength, unkillable,
like a machine.

209
00:34:15,144 --> 00:34:18,438
We didnt stand a chance.
So tell me if I`mm wrong, Cardinal.

210
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:22,878
Couldnt he be the one we talked about,
the one we knew would come one day?

211
00:34:22,951 --> 00:34:25,155
There are some other developments.

212
00:34:25,223 --> 00:34:26,913
Sad developments.

213
00:34:28,422 --> 00:34:29,796
Tom.

214
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:34,555
Our Tom Callahan is dead.

215
00:34:35,844 --> 00:34:39,324
The whole European team is wiped out.

216
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:41,501
- When?
- Three days ago.

217
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:44,321
Callahans team was clearing
a large nest near Cologne, Germany.

218
00:34:44,387 --> 00:34:47,965
Local authorities reported it
as a terrorist act.

219
00:34:51,331 --> 00:34:53,119
We found this there.

220
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,729
Is he the one?

221
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:03,263
Yes.

222
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:09,972
- What is this?
- Celebratum.

223
00:35:10,048 --> 00:35:13,593
Its medievaI Latin for "celebrate. ```
Celebrate this-

224
00:35:13,664 --> 00:35:15,573
Celebrate what?

225
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,973
We dont know.

226
00:35:19,038 --> 00:35:21,973
Ive authenticated the portrait.
It was painted in 1340.

227
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:25,046
The subjects name is,
was, Jan Valek.

228
00:35:25,118 --> 00:35:27,670
Born in Prague, 1311.
He was a priest...

229
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:30,588
who turned against the church and led
the Bohemian peasants in an uprising...

230
00:35:30,653 --> 00:35:33,369
actually capturing severaI small towns.

231
00:35:33,436 --> 00:35:37,658
Valek was captured, tried for heresy
and burned at the stake.

232
00:35:37,724 --> 00:35:42,066
But after his death there were reports
that he was seen walking at night.

233
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:44,856
It was said he killed the living
to drink their blood.

234
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:47,825
They opened his grave,
and it was found empty.

235
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:50,484
Its the first known case of vampirism.

236
00:35:50,555 --> 00:35:52,377
A priest.

237
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,897
Valek is not like the other masters
you have hunted before.

238
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:57,871
Hes the first and most powerful.

239
00:35:57,945 --> 00:36:00,400
Of our slayers, you are the only one...

240
00:36:00,473 --> 00:36:03,058
who faced Valek and survived.

241
00:36:05,016 --> 00:36:08,332
Im going back out.
You mind if I hang on to this?

242
00:36:08,408 --> 00:36:10,611
Ive been in contact with Rome.

243
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:14,901
The Vatican Council requests
that you rebuild your team.

244
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:17,966
- There isnt time.
- You are to return to Monterey.

245
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,177
Recruit new team members...

246
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:22,929
and try again
when you are at full strength.

247
00:36:22,997 --> 00:36:26,794
Father Adam will accompany you
and take the place...

248
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:29,171
of poor Father Giovanni.

249
00:36:29,237 --> 00:36:30,611
I dont think so.

250
00:36:36,212 --> 00:36:37,805
This is nonnegotiable.

251
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:41,355
Valek is the original,
the source of the disease!

252
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:43,816
The first vampire
created by the Catholic church!

253
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:46,890
- By accident.
- Shut the fuck up!

254
00:36:46,962 --> 00:36:49,133
This was your fight, Cardinal.
Now it is mine.

255
00:36:50,098 --> 00:36:51,472
Jack!

256
00:36:55,985 --> 00:37:00,239
If you refuse to obey the rules,
the operation will be cancelled...

257
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:02,377
the funding with drawn.

258
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,782
Do you have any idea how this Valek
knows my name?

259
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:21,892
Stay close to him.

260
00:38:26,532 --> 00:38:28,386
Whats your name?

261
00:38:30,723 --> 00:38:33,057
Do you understand whats happening?

262
00:38:34,723 --> 00:38:36,097
Help me!

263
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:39,993
Dont fuck with me, honey!

264
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:42,553
Ill snap your neck like a twig.

265
00:38:43,938 --> 00:38:46,491
Nod your head yes or no.

266
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:49,016
Do you understand
whats happened to you?

267
00:38:49,793 --> 00:38:51,167
Do it!

268
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,746
All right.

269
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:57,150
Im gonna explain it to you.

270
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,573
Im going to take my hand
off your mouth.

271
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,813
You scream-

272
00:39:06,654 --> 00:39:08,029
Good.

273
00:39:12,253 --> 00:39:14,773
Now, whats your name?

274
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:19,189
Katrina.

275
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,075
Okay, Katrina, heres the score.

276
00:39:29,915 --> 00:39:32,467
I took off your clothes.
I cleaned you up.

277
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:35,352
I tied you down.
I also saved your ass.

278
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:38,483
Youve been bitten by a vampire.

279
00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:40,463
Do you remember the party at the motel?

280
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:43,766
Big guy, pointy teeth,
really shitty breath?

281
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:47,248
Dont worry,
it`lll come back to you soon.

282
00:39:48,441 --> 00:39:51,855
A master vampire has a telepathic link
with his victims.

283
00:39:51,928 --> 00:39:54,579
Youre gonna help us find him.

284
00:39:54,648 --> 00:39:57,495
While hes sleeping,
we unleash on him.

285
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:59,413
Youre the bait, honey.

286
00:40:00,151 --> 00:40:01,973
Sorry.

287
00:40:11,605 --> 00:40:13,459
I know alI about you, Mr. Crow.

288
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:16,524
I know that your parents
were bitten by vampires...

289
00:40:16,596 --> 00:40:19,410
and you were raised by the Church,
brought up to be its master slayer.

290
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:24,179
The truth is, I didnt want
to be forced on you like this.

291
00:40:24,243 --> 00:40:27,854
I was supposed to take over
for Father Giovanni when he retired.

292
00:40:27,923 --> 00:40:32,395
Ive always dreamed of this, ever since
I first heard about the slayers.

293
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:36,240
I wanted to be part of the team,
just do whatever I could.

294
00:40:36,305 --> 00:40:40,134
For example, if you wanted to receive
the Sacrament of Confession-

295
00:40:40,209 --> 00:40:41,583
Fuck it!

296
00:40:53,391 --> 00:40:55,595
Who set us up?
Was it you?

297
00:41:00,398 --> 00:41:02,470
I dont know what you`rre talking about!

298
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:05,607
If you dont think I`lll kill you
`ccause you`rre a priest...

299
00:41:05,677 --> 00:41:08,044
you are seriously misjudging
the wrong motherfucker!

300
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:10,280
Go ahead and kill me!

301
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:13,250
I dont know what you`rre talking about!

302
00:41:13,324 --> 00:41:14,698
I dont.

303
00:41:19,499 --> 00:41:20,873
Well see.

304
00:41:27,882 --> 00:41:30,631
Where are we going?

305
00:41:31,465 --> 00:41:33,407
You have to tell me whats going on.

306
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:37,573
- Have you ever seen a vampire?
- No.

307
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:40,161
First of alI, theyre not romantic.

308
00:41:40,233 --> 00:41:43,298
Its not like they`rre a bunch of fags
hopping around in rented formal wear...

309
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:45,986
seducing everybody in sight
with cheesy Euro-trash accents.

310
00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:48,445
Forget whatever youve seen in movies.

311
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:51,170
They dont turn into bats.
Crosses don`tt work.

312
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:53,540
You want to try garlic?
Stand with garlic around your neck...

313
00:41:53,606 --> 00:41:56,868
one of these buggers will bend you over
and take a walk...

314
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:59,967
up your strada chocolatta while hes
sucking blood from your neck, all right?

315
00:42:00,038 --> 00:42:02,493
And they dont sleep in coffins
lined in taffeta.

316
00:42:02,565 --> 00:42:06,307
You want to kill one, you drive
a wooden stake right through his heart.

317
00:42:07,269 --> 00:42:09,603
Sunlight turns them
into crispy critters.

318
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,874
Got it?

319
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,306
See this map?

320
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:17,153
This map shows all the encounters
in the United States...

321
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:19,390
as far back as the 1800s.

322
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:21,792
- Ive never seen this.
- No one has outside the team.

323
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:24,095
Look at the southwest.
See the spiral pattern?

324
00:42:24,162 --> 00:42:27,390
If you time sequence all the encounters,
you get a logarithmic pattern...

325
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:28,864
ever widening.

326
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:33,085
Its a search pattern, Padre.
They`rre looking for something.

327
00:42:33,153 --> 00:42:34,941
Do you know what it is?

328
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:37,343
I heard stories when I was young.

329
00:42:38,592 --> 00:42:40,599
Something about a black cross.

330
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:43,354
About vampires walking in the sunlight.

331
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:47,358
Padre, can I ask you something?

332
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,732
Yeah.

333
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:52,628
When I was kicking your ass back there,
did that give you wood?

334
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:55,260
What?

335
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:57,780
Did you get a mahogany from that?
Tell the truth.

336
00:42:59,485 --> 00:43:02,267
Im just fucking with you.
Forget about it.

337
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:48,500
Oh, Jesus.

338
00:44:02,324 --> 00:44:04,658
What time is it?

339
00:44:06,963 --> 00:44:08,337
9:10.

340
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:18,896
You want one?

341
00:44:20,978 --> 00:44:23,214
Youve got to eat something.

342
00:44:23,281 --> 00:44:24,688
I cant.

343
00:44:26,737 --> 00:44:29,071
I wouldnt mind a cigarette, though.

344
00:44:34,607 --> 00:44:37,127
We need to work on this.

345
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:39,882
The less you eat, the faster the virus
moves through your bloodstream.

346
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,706
Virus?

347
00:44:41,774 --> 00:44:45,090
Yeah. Thats what I call it.
Nobody knows what it really is.

348
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:47,915
Poison, Kool-Aid, whatever,
it all does the same thing.

349
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:49,956
Turns you into a vampire.

350
00:44:59,276 --> 00:45:01,415
What happened to the other girls
at the party?

351
00:45:02,508 --> 00:45:04,449
They didnt make it.

352
00:45:04,523 --> 00:45:05,897
Im sorry.

353
00:45:07,435 --> 00:45:09,289
You remember now?

354
00:45:10,282 --> 00:45:14,341
Some.
Why doesnt anyone know?

355
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,319
Nobody wants to know.

356
00:45:16,394 --> 00:45:19,077
Thats how vampires survive.
They`rre smart.

357
00:45:19,146 --> 00:45:22,342
They keep their numbers low, live in
small bands. The world never catches on.

358
00:45:24,616 --> 00:45:27,398
Will I end up being one?

359
00:45:27,464 --> 00:45:31,522
I dont know for sure.
Probably.

360
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:35,715
Unless we find him before you turn.

361
00:45:35,783 --> 00:45:38,335
Then maybe theres a chance.

362
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:43,486
Look, heres what we do know.

363
00:45:43,557 --> 00:45:46,404
Youre connected
to the master vampire now.

364
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:50,495
Hes a part of you,
and this link will grow.

365
00:45:51,621 --> 00:45:55,646
Youll never be able to get him
out of you, not while he exists.

366
00:45:56,932 --> 00:45:58,972
Then I dont want to live.

367
00:46:00,643 --> 00:46:02,017
You may not.

368
00:46:20,769 --> 00:46:23,037
Can I get dressed now?

369
00:46:23,105 --> 00:46:24,479
Sure.

370
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,341
Could you get me a towel or something?

371
00:46:29,183 --> 00:46:31,452
Its not like I haven`tt seen you naked.

372
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:32,729
Fuck it.

373
00:46:32,799 --> 00:46:36,410
Easy. Ill get you a towel.
One towel coming right up.

374
00:46:36,478 --> 00:46:38,333
I wont peek.

375
00:46:49,084 --> 00:46:52,379
Nice try.
Leave the door open.

376
00:46:52,444 --> 00:46:54,266
No way.

377
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:55,705
A little bit.

378
00:48:21,935 --> 00:48:25,033
- What the fuck you doing?
- Damn it! Let me go!

379
00:48:35,277 --> 00:48:36,870
Look what you did!

380
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,609
You fucking bit me!

381
00:48:44,684 --> 00:48:46,407
Are you nuts?

382
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,245
Where are you going?

383
00:48:50,316 --> 00:48:52,966
You bite me, huh?
Get up!

384
00:48:53,035 --> 00:48:55,271
Fucking bite me!

385
00:48:57,898 --> 00:48:59,272
Fucking bitch!

386
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:03,816
Fuck!

387
00:49:07,689 --> 00:49:09,063
Goddamn it.

388
00:49:27,206 --> 00:49:29,093
Fucking stupid whore.

389
00:49:38,788 --> 00:49:40,162
Yeah.

390
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:42,627
Where are you?

391
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:47,932
Im fine.
Yeah, I`mm fine.

392
00:49:48,003 --> 00:49:49,377
Room 312.

393
00:49:49,443 --> 00:49:52,257
Im coming up. Stay put.

394
00:49:58,977 --> 00:50:01,846
Im Father Adam Guiteau.
You`rre Tony Montoya, I believe.

395
00:50:01,921 --> 00:50:03,775
You look different than your picture.

396
00:50:03,841 --> 00:50:06,939
Im an archivist.
I`vve studied the team extensively.

397
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:18,228
Whats this bruise on her jaw?

398
00:50:20,158 --> 00:50:23,453
I had to hit her.
She was trying to kill herself.

399
00:50:23,518 --> 00:50:25,558
I had to pull her off the fire escape.

400
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,145
Then I fell through the window.

401
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,874
Thats all?

402
00:50:36,636 --> 00:50:38,010
Yeah.

403
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:45,657
- Whyd you slug her?
- I cut my arm on broken glass.

404
00:50:45,723 --> 00:50:48,886
I was pissed. I dont know.
I fucking slugged her. Who cares?

405
00:50:54,873 --> 00:50:57,906
This is our new padre.
Weve been ordered back to Monterey.

406
00:50:57,977 --> 00:50:59,504
Rebuild the team. Start over.

407
00:50:59,577 --> 00:51:01,846
- Were going back to Monterey?
- No.

408
00:51:01,913 --> 00:51:05,687
Callahans whole team is gone.
Slaughtered.

409
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:09,265
- Its just us now.
- That`ss right.

410
00:51:10,295 --> 00:51:14,485
- Who is she?
- Some hooker. Bitten by Valek.

411
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:17,071
Vampires are psychically linked
to each other.

412
00:51:17,142 --> 00:51:20,109
As soon as she hooks into Valek...

413
00:51:20,182 --> 00:51:22,069
we go looking for him.

414
00:51:22,133 --> 00:51:25,002
- We have orders to follow.
- Fuck you, Padre.

415
00:51:25,077 --> 00:51:29,811
Language! If youre not going to follow
orders, I`lll call Cardinal Alba.

416
00:51:34,452 --> 00:51:36,940
Excuse me. Language.

417
00:51:41,074 --> 00:51:45,329
Lets have a chat about language.
See if this syntax works for you.

418
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:49,005
You dont make a phone call,
you don`tt blow your nose...

419
00:51:49,074 --> 00:51:51,626
you dont wipe your ass
unless I tell you, okay?

420
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,765
Show me.

421
00:52:25,452 --> 00:52:27,340
Here we go.

422
00:52:27,404 --> 00:52:29,825
Katrina, can you hear me?

423
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,914
- What is it?
- Theres someone else now.

424
00:52:34,987 --> 00:52:37,954
Someone youre connected to in your
mind. You know who I`mm talking about?

425
00:52:39,178 --> 00:52:41,731
What are you seeing?

426
00:52:42,954 --> 00:52:44,612
I cant.

427
00:52:44,681 --> 00:52:47,877
Yes, you can.
Youre here with us and you`rre safe.

428
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:50,498
Where is he?
What are you seeing?

429
00:52:51,273 --> 00:52:52,734
Its dark.

430
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:54,118
Keep trying.

431
00:52:57,096 --> 00:52:58,470
Its a map.

432
00:52:59,464 --> 00:53:01,569
A circle on the map.

433
00:53:06,247 --> 00:53:08,668
- We need a location.
- Im working on it.

434
00:53:08,742 --> 00:53:11,109
- Before she loses him!
- You want to switch places?

435
00:53:11,174 --> 00:53:13,595
Just come on.

436
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:15,939
Katrina, listen carefully.

437
00:53:16,005 --> 00:53:18,688
I need to know exactly where you are.

438
00:53:18,757 --> 00:53:21,244
What youre seeing right now.
Details.

439
00:53:30,692 --> 00:53:32,993
He killed the priest!

440
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:36,768
- All right, youre safe.
- A priest? What priest?

441
00:53:38,786 --> 00:53:40,247
Moving now.

442
00:53:40,322 --> 00:53:41,882
Stay with it.

443
00:53:41,954 --> 00:53:43,808
Theres a sign.

444
00:53:43,874 --> 00:53:47,135
On the highway.
It says San MigueI.

445
00:53:47,201 --> 00:53:50,583
San Miguel? Come on, keep trying.
You have to.

446
00:53:50,656 --> 00:53:52,249
I cant.

447
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:54,906
- Goddamn it!
- The links broken.

448
00:53:54,976 --> 00:53:57,245
What priest is she talking about?
Goddamn it!

449
00:53:57,312 --> 00:54:01,305
I can get a list of the churches in
San Miguel if you let me use the phone.

450
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:04,505
Call every church.
Find one where an old padres missing.

451
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:08,119
Road trip, Montoya. Your job
is to watch this girl. Goddamn it!

452
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,868
Whats wrong with you?

453
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:16,218
Im just tired, that`ss all.

454
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,608
Is there something
you want to tell me?

455
00:54:29,563 --> 00:54:31,951
Nothing youd want to listen to.

456
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,400
I got the fax this morning
from the cardinals office in Santa Fe.

457
00:54:44,473 --> 00:54:46,709
Youre an investigator
working for the Catholic Church?

458
00:54:46,777 --> 00:54:50,453
Right. We looking into a pattern
of anti-Catholic hate crimes.

459
00:54:51,224 --> 00:54:53,329
- May I?
- Its pretty damn savage.

460
00:55:01,942 --> 00:55:04,494
What about the old priest?
Any of this blood his?

461
00:55:04,565 --> 00:55:08,242
- His name is Father Molina.
- Sorry.

462
00:55:10,101 --> 00:55:12,654
You get something on this case,
youll share it with me, right?

463
00:55:12,725 --> 00:55:14,099
Thats right.

464
00:55:14,164 --> 00:55:17,459
- I better not find out different.
- You wont.

465
00:55:17,524 --> 00:55:20,241
So far it looks like all of this blood
is from Mrs. Fisher.

466
00:55:20,308 --> 00:55:22,991
We wont know for sure until we get
a sample through pathology.

467
00:55:23,059 --> 00:55:25,098
Was anything stolen?

468
00:55:25,171 --> 00:55:27,375
- Just Father Molina.
- We found him.

469
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:33,576
Lord!

470
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,127
I dont gef this!

471
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,803
Why come to North Podunk and attack
some old priest and a cleaning lady?

472
00:55:53,871 --> 00:55:56,173
Does that make sense?
Valek didnt feed on them.

473
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:59,784
Father Molina was a well-known scholar
of early Catholic history in the U.S.

474
00:55:59,854 --> 00:56:02,057
- Who gives a shit?
- I dont know?

475
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:04,678
I dont know why Valek killed him.

476
00:56:04,749 --> 00:56:07,596
- Whats this symbol?
- The church doesn`tt know.

477
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,431
You and the cardinal
are Iying sacks of shit.

478
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,410
Help me.
The hours getting late.

479
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:19,459
Its a medieval astronomical sign...

480
00:56:20,619 --> 00:56:22,473
for the sun.

481
00:57:26,689 --> 00:57:29,853
There are seven more with him now.

482
00:57:31,617 --> 00:57:35,326
- Powerful!
- Are they masters?

483
00:57:35,392 --> 00:57:36,603
Yes.

484
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:28,311
Padre...

485
00:58:32,697 --> 00:58:35,827
Im beginning to like you,
so don`tt make me hurt you, okay?

486
00:58:35,895 --> 00:58:38,830
Tell me what you know.
Ill buy you a beer and get you laid.

487
00:58:38,904 --> 00:58:42,449
You dont tell me,
I`lll have to start cutting on you.

488
00:58:44,534 --> 00:58:47,665
No, you wont.
You`rre a righteous man.

489
00:58:49,046 --> 00:58:51,631
Besides, I serve a higher master
than you.

490
00:58:51,701 --> 00:58:55,759
Any secrets I keep are kept to protect
the church and its followers.

491
00:58:57,205 --> 00:58:59,060
- Open your mouth.
- What?

492
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:01,165
Open your mouth.

493
00:59:07,539 --> 00:59:09,448
Give me your hand.

494
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:19,047
Listen to me, you fuck!

495
00:59:20,178 --> 00:59:24,487
My father kept a secret once.
He had been bitten by a vampire.

496
00:59:25,585 --> 00:59:28,432
He kept it a secret
from me and my mother.

497
00:59:28,496 --> 00:59:30,984
By the fifth day, he was turning.

498
00:59:31,055 --> 00:59:33,738
That night he attacked my mother.

499
00:59:33,808 --> 00:59:36,360
And then he came after me.

500
00:59:36,431 --> 00:59:39,692
I killed my own father, Padre.

501
00:59:39,758 --> 00:59:42,125
I got no trouble killing you.

502
00:59:43,598 --> 00:59:45,158
Last chance.

503
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:50,667
Now open your motherfucking mouth.
Open your fucking mouth!

504
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:54,437
What? You ready?
Excuse me. What?

505
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:58,305
Valek is looking for an ancient relic:
the Cross of Berziers.

506
01:00:05,547 --> 01:00:08,743
After his trial, fhe church declared
Valek was possessed by demons.

507
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:11,712
He was taken to a small town
in France called Berziers.

508
01:00:11,786 --> 01:00:13,793
Exorcism was performed...

509
01:00:13,866 --> 01:00:17,826
using an ancient, forbidden form
of the ceremony.

510
01:00:18,857 --> 01:00:24,093
It was long, and very brutal.
And then something went wrong.

511
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:36,229
A wooden gate is opening.

512
01:00:41,286 --> 01:00:46,173
The accounts are confused,
but they refer to an inverse exorcism.

513
01:00:46,245 --> 01:00:49,823
The body is destroyed,
but the possessed soul remains.

514
01:00:49,893 --> 01:00:52,281
The exorcism transformed Valek
into a creature...

515
01:00:52,356 --> 01:00:54,876
whose body is dead,
but who lives on.

516
01:00:54,948 --> 01:00:57,403
- A vampire.
- Yeah, a vampire.

517
01:01:43,869 --> 01:01:45,243
Its a cross.

518
01:01:58,651 --> 01:02:01,465
The stories you heard
abouf the black cross are true.

519
01:02:01,531 --> 01:02:04,530
If was used in Valeks exorcism,
then taken back to Rome.

520
01:02:04,602 --> 01:02:07,569
Its known as the Berziers Cross.

521
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:10,482
The cross was shipped
to the New World.

522
01:02:10,553 --> 01:02:13,400
It was moved from one
Spanish mission to another.

523
01:02:13,465 --> 01:02:16,432
Its exact location was kept secret
even from the Vatican.

524
01:02:16,504 --> 01:02:18,358
For hundreds of years it was lost.

525
01:02:18,424 --> 01:02:21,325
Then Cardinal Alba discovered the name
of the only living priest...

526
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,636
who knew the location
of the cross.

527
01:02:24,823 --> 01:02:26,350
Father Joseph Molina.

528
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:30,704
Cardinal Alba and I came to the
United States to find Father Molina...

529
01:02:30,774 --> 01:02:33,774
to reclaim the Berziers Cross,
and that is all I know.

530
01:02:44,437 --> 01:02:48,397
Youre a good man.
Welcome to the team.

531
01:02:53,332 --> 01:02:55,720
God forgive me.

532
01:03:05,425 --> 01:03:06,799
He found it.

533
01:03:09,937 --> 01:03:11,311
Lets hit it.

534
01:03:16,912 --> 01:03:18,821
Wait! Wait, stop the car.

535
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,345
That way.

536
01:04:32,901 --> 01:04:34,275
It was here.

537
01:04:50,242 --> 01:04:53,057
Damn!
You picking up anything?

538
01:04:54,754 --> 01:04:56,826
Hes gone.

539
01:04:56,898 --> 01:05:00,476
- You dont look so good.
- She hasn`tt turned. She can`tt eat.

540
01:05:00,545 --> 01:05:02,649
Maybe she wants human blood.

541
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,535
- I said she hasnt-
- I heard.

542
01:05:10,176 --> 01:05:14,136
- Why dont you back off?
- What`ss with you?

543
01:05:14,207 --> 01:05:17,949
Whats with me? What`ss with you?
You`rre being a fucking asshole!

544
01:05:18,015 --> 01:05:20,698
What the fuck is your problem?

545
01:05:20,766 --> 01:05:22,708
Youre not falling
for this half-dead-

546
01:05:27,837 --> 01:05:30,292
- Nice shot. Want to try again?
- Stop it!

547
01:05:30,365 --> 01:05:32,786
- Get the fuck outta here!
- What are you doing?

548
01:05:32,861 --> 01:05:36,635
- Were about to have a good fight.
- No!

549
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:41,172
Do you know why Valek wants
the Berziers Cross? Think about it.

550
01:05:41,243 --> 01:05:45,683
He wants to finish his transformation.
The exorcism was never completed.

551
01:05:45,754 --> 01:05:48,885
Valek was left vulnerable,
able to survive only at night.

552
01:05:48,954 --> 01:05:51,604
So if he completes the ritual-

553
01:05:51,673 --> 01:05:54,390
I think the balance shifts.

554
01:05:55,417 --> 01:05:59,889
For 600 years, Valek has wanted
to find a way to live in the daylight.

555
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,618
Oh, fuck me.

556
01:06:01,688 --> 01:06:04,143
Now with the Berziers Cross, he will.

557
01:06:04,216 --> 01:06:08,590
A master vampire, able to walk
in the sun, unstoppable...

558
01:06:08,663 --> 01:06:10,572
unless we stop him.

559
01:06:12,534 --> 01:06:14,476
Well have to finish this
some other time.

560
01:06:15,607 --> 01:06:19,665
- Yeah.
- Eight hours of sun left. Come on.

561
01:06:23,989 --> 01:06:25,899
Come on, baby.

562
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:32,626
Thats where he is.

563
01:06:32,691 --> 01:06:34,513
Santiago.

564
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,767
The place looks empty.

565
01:07:06,831 --> 01:07:08,686
Hes near.

566
01:08:36,578 --> 01:08:38,465
Hello?

567
01:08:40,705 --> 01:08:43,039
What do you figure
the population is? 20?

568
01:08:43,105 --> 01:08:45,210
Id say 30, maybe more.

569
01:08:45,281 --> 01:08:47,648
Now the question is,
how many of them are goons?

570
01:08:47,713 --> 01:08:51,422
Worst-case scenario, half:
15 dead, 15 goons.

571
01:08:51,488 --> 01:08:54,422
If he took the town, Valek would
had to have been here several days?

572
01:08:54,495 --> 01:08:56,088
Thats right.

573
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,193
He set this up, slowly,
one goon at a time.

574
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:03,092
Now hes got the Cross, and the biggest
nest of blood-drinkers ever known!

575
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:06,646
- What have we got? Three slayers.
- Two slayers!

576
01:09:09,469 --> 01:09:12,764
Its time to kill some vampires.
You with us, Padre?

577
01:09:15,837 --> 01:09:18,105
Yeah, Im with you.

578
01:09:18,173 --> 01:09:20,027
Get a location.

579
01:09:28,315 --> 01:09:30,169
Where is he?

580
01:09:38,009 --> 01:09:40,759
Everywhere.

581
01:09:42,873 --> 01:09:46,353
Katrina, baby, listen.
Is he in there?

582
01:09:47,256 --> 01:09:48,630
Yes.

583
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:51,890
Hes in there.

584
01:09:51,959 --> 01:09:54,064
In the dark.

585
01:09:54,135 --> 01:09:56,556
All right. Good girl.

586
01:09:58,935 --> 01:10:02,993
- The best-constructed building in town?
- The jail of course.

587
01:10:03,062 --> 01:10:05,745
Bingo. She senses him in there.

588
01:10:05,814 --> 01:10:07,853
- She telling the truth?
- Yeah.

589
01:10:07,925 --> 01:10:12,496
- Suppose hes taken control, using her?
- I guess I`lll pay with my life.

590
01:10:12,564 --> 01:10:15,411
Youre not the only one, amigo.

591
01:10:15,476 --> 01:10:17,963
Youre not the only one.

592
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,618
Can you hear me?

593
01:10:53,487 --> 01:10:56,967
Im sorry.
It`ss going to be all right.

594
01:10:58,094 --> 01:11:00,199
Ill take care of you.

595
01:11:05,229 --> 01:11:07,368
I promise.

596
01:12:21,762 --> 01:12:23,966
Oh, shes thirsty.

597
01:12:24,034 --> 01:12:26,270
- She smells your blood.
- Oh, God.

598
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:32,794
Padre, your neck!
Cover your neck!

599
01:12:34,624 --> 01:12:36,118
Take the woman!

600
01:12:44,671 --> 01:12:46,329
Cocksucker! Come on!

601
01:12:52,478 --> 01:12:54,965
Padre, kill it! Goddamn it!

602
01:12:56,733 --> 01:12:59,634
Dont just stare! Kill it!

603
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:07,697
With the stake! Kill him
with the stake through the heart!

604
01:13:08,731 --> 01:13:10,422
Yes! Yes!

605
01:13:16,346 --> 01:13:19,510
How do you like your stake, bitch?

606
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:03,632
- There another way up from the cells?
- Doesnt look that way.

607
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,547
Coming out of the elevator
makes it a straight shot to the door.

608
01:14:06,611 --> 01:14:09,993
- That means using the cable.
- Well attach the cable to the Jeep.

609
01:14:10,067 --> 01:14:13,776
- Yank them into the sun fast.
- Someone has to drive the jeep.

610
01:14:13,842 --> 01:14:17,998
- How do you lure them into the elevator?
- Someone has to be inside.

611
01:14:18,066 --> 01:14:21,099
Escape hatch, huh? Yes.

612
01:14:21,169 --> 01:14:24,038
When they get inside,
one of us goes up through the hole.

613
01:14:24,113 --> 01:14:28,651
The other guy presses the button.
The doors shut, theyre trapped.

614
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,891
- It has to be me.
- What?

615
01:14:30,959 --> 01:14:33,861
You have to be here
to fire the crossbow.

616
01:14:33,935 --> 01:14:36,455
You want to drive the jeep?
Ill do it.

617
01:14:36,527 --> 01:14:38,534
I cant drive.
I never learned.

618
01:14:39,854 --> 01:14:44,196
Okay. Lather up and shave your ass.
Youre the bait. Let`ss go.

619
01:14:56,684 --> 01:14:58,789
Listen to me!

620
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:03,202
Youve got to try to hold on.
Okay?

621
01:15:06,218 --> 01:15:08,389
- You seen Valek?
- Nothing yet.

622
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:11,840
- Anything?
- There.

623
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:15,971
There.

624
01:15:19,912 --> 01:15:22,083
Im ready.

625
01:15:22,152 --> 01:15:24,835
Youve got to be fleet of foot.

626
01:15:24,905 --> 01:15:27,043
- Im not kidding.
- I know.

627
01:15:27,112 --> 01:15:29,894
- I used to play soccer.
- Soccer?

628
01:15:29,959 --> 01:15:32,577
- I was captain of my team.
- Id better be the one-

629
01:15:32,647 --> 01:15:35,265
- No, Ill be fine.
- You will?

630
01:15:35,335 --> 01:15:38,465
Dont worry about me.
Just shoot when the door opens.

631
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,389
You can count on that.

632
01:15:43,621 --> 01:15:45,825
- Padre?
- I know.

633
01:15:50,852 --> 01:15:53,722
- Montoya, hes on his way down.
- Hooked and ready, Jack.

634
01:16:43,421 --> 01:16:45,013
What are you doing?

635
01:16:51,324 --> 01:16:53,266
Get back in the fucking elevator!

636
01:17:04,602 --> 01:17:05,496
Shit!

637
01:17:08,633 --> 01:17:11,480
Get ready, Montoya.
Here we go.

638
01:17:44,372 --> 01:17:45,746
Padre?

639
01:18:03,953 --> 01:18:05,000
Open!

640
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:16,138
Montoya, go!
Die, you bloodsucker! Pull!

641
01:18:38,764 --> 01:18:41,797
Padre, you okay?
He didnt bite or scratch you?

642
01:18:41,868 --> 01:18:43,723
Okay, come on.

643
01:18:46,283 --> 01:18:48,836
No! Keep the door- Shit!

644
01:18:48,907 --> 01:18:51,427
- Sorry.
- Monitors.

645
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:55,715
Its going all the way down.

646
01:18:55,786 --> 01:18:58,087
Okay. Im bringing it up.

647
01:18:58,153 --> 01:19:00,357
- Sorry about the doors.
- No harm, no foul.

648
01:19:03,017 --> 01:19:06,432
- You did good. Running out of time.
- I have to do it again, dont I?

649
01:19:12,008 --> 01:19:14,462
Why arent the doors opening?
What`ss wrong?

650
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:21,405
Jack! Look at this.

651
01:19:22,822 --> 01:19:24,032
What?

652
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:35,391
Shit!

653
01:19:45,539 --> 01:19:46,913
Shit!

654
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:55,103
Go!

655
01:20:03,232 --> 01:20:05,501
Montoya, go, go!

656
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:18,292
- Go! Goddamn it, go!
- Come on!

657
01:20:22,525 --> 01:20:23,736
Shit!

658
01:20:26,429 --> 01:20:30,323
- You never told me they could do that.
- I didnt know they could.

659
01:20:30,396 --> 01:20:32,949
Get out of the way!

660
01:20:36,923 --> 01:20:39,411
Come on, do it, you fucking bitch!

661
01:20:41,755 --> 01:20:44,821
Hook it up!
Padre, get a spike!

662
01:20:47,546 --> 01:20:49,334
Shell take you with her!

663
01:20:49,402 --> 01:20:51,768
Come on!

664
01:20:58,552 --> 01:21:00,341
Die!

665
01:21:01,464 --> 01:21:05,238
Die, you fucker, die!

666
01:21:25,493 --> 01:21:27,086
Look at the sun!

667
01:21:28,437 --> 01:21:32,014
- Were finished.
- No, we gotta go back.

668
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:36,425
Rule number 10:
You cant kill a master at night.

669
01:21:37,683 --> 01:21:39,407
Its over.

670
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:42,791
Hes right.

671
01:21:42,866 --> 01:21:44,426
Lets go.

672
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:08,877
Hello, Jack.

673
01:22:23,693 --> 01:22:25,481
You motherfucker!

674
01:22:35,819 --> 01:22:37,444
Go!

675
01:22:48,073 --> 01:22:51,269
The war is over, crusader.

676
01:24:28,283 --> 01:24:29,908
Hello, Jack.

677
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:35,792
From your expression...

678
01:24:35,866 --> 01:24:38,899
I assume you couldnt possibly
understand my presence here.

679
01:24:38,969 --> 01:24:42,863
Im sorry to disillusion you.

680
01:24:42,937 --> 01:24:47,955
As one grows old,
as death approaches...

681
01:24:48,024 --> 01:24:52,279
we begin to question our faith...

682
01:24:52,343 --> 01:24:54,383
and I have found my lacking.

683
01:24:54,455 --> 01:24:57,324
Is there a God?
Is there a heaven?

684
01:24:57,398 --> 01:24:59,918
I can no longer answer this for certain.

685
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:02,957
Ive witnessed no miracles,
had no visions...

686
01:25:04,629 --> 01:25:08,207
and the prospect of death terrifies me.

687
01:25:08,277 --> 01:25:12,881
I realized Ive only one alternative.

688
01:25:12,948 --> 01:25:16,973
And I made a bargain,
with the devil, if you wish.

689
01:25:17,043 --> 01:25:21,298
You are truly
a pile of dogshit, Cardinal.

690
01:25:21,363 --> 01:25:24,810
Yeah, thats right.

691
01:25:24,882 --> 01:25:28,679
Thats correct, Jack,
and I can live with that.

692
01:25:28,754 --> 01:25:33,194
After Ive given Valek what he wants,
he will fulfill our bargain.

693
01:25:33,265 --> 01:25:38,480
And I will be transformed
into one of his new children.

694
01:25:39,505 --> 01:25:41,643
Its beautiful, isn`tt it?

695
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,363
Eternal life.

696
01:25:45,872 --> 01:25:50,149
Immortality can change your heart.

697
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:56,681
Why dont you prove you can kick my ass?
Come on. Untie me.

698
01:25:56,750 --> 01:26:01,484
Come on, you fucking pole-smoking
fashion victim. Come over here.

699
01:26:01,549 --> 01:26:02,759
Jack.

700
01:26:02,829 --> 01:26:06,473
Five minutes, then you can bite my ass.
Would you like that? See me tied up?

701
01:26:06,541 --> 01:26:08,483
What will silence you?

702
01:26:08,557 --> 01:26:11,109
Come on, untie me, you prick.

703
01:26:12,363 --> 01:26:14,567
Perhaps this will help.

704
01:26:20,523 --> 01:26:24,319
Apparently your friend
is one of my children now.

705
01:26:26,666 --> 01:26:29,153
You are alone, crusader.

706
01:27:29,057 --> 01:27:31,031
What do you want from me?

707
01:27:37,024 --> 01:27:39,871
Oh, you hate me so, dont you?

708
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:43,062
But you made me, crusader.

709
01:27:43,135 --> 01:27:45,623
You hate what youve made,
you fear it...

710
01:27:45,695 --> 01:27:47,799
because it is superior to you.

711
01:27:48,862 --> 01:27:51,895
For 600 years,
Ive fed on your kind at will.

712
01:28:03,708 --> 01:28:07,002
- Why not kill me and get it over with?
- Because youre needed, Jack.

713
01:28:07,803 --> 01:28:11,796
The ceremony is a reenactment
of the original exorcism.

714
01:28:11,867 --> 01:28:14,550
It requires the blood
of a crusader...

715
01:28:14,618 --> 01:28:18,196
and his crucifixion
upon a burning cross.

716
01:28:18,266 --> 01:28:20,949
The climax of the ceremony
must coincide...

717
01:28:21,018 --> 01:28:24,181
with the first rays
of the rising sun.

718
01:28:25,369 --> 01:28:26,929
Sorry, Jack.

719
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:18,443
You motherf-

720
01:29:57,036 --> 01:29:59,043
What will you do, Valek?

721
01:29:59,116 --> 01:30:03,174
Youve got nobody to complete
your ritual! The sun`ss rising.

722
01:30:05,162 --> 01:30:08,097
You will finish the ritual.

723
01:30:09,674 --> 01:30:12,903
- Try and make me.
- Attaboy. Fuck with him!

724
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,679
Looks like youre shit out of luck.
Give it up!

725
01:30:32,903 --> 01:30:35,324
- Finish it.
- No.

726
01:30:40,966 --> 01:30:43,780
Come on, Padre!
My nuts are on fire!

727
01:31:19,264 --> 01:31:21,751
Come on.
Lets go kill some vampires.

728
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:33,839
End of the line.

729
01:32:45,172 --> 01:32:47,692
You still with us, Crow?

730
01:32:50,323 --> 01:32:52,592
I dont burn so good these days,
bloodsucker.

731
01:32:54,387 --> 01:32:56,242
Give me the cross.

732
01:32:56,307 --> 01:32:59,503
This cross?
Let me just ask you one thing.

733
01:32:59,570 --> 01:33:02,952
After 600 years,
hows that dick working? Pretty good?

734
01:33:03,026 --> 01:33:04,236
Huh? Come on!

735
01:33:04,305 --> 01:33:06,672
The cross!

736
01:33:13,328 --> 01:33:14,735
Suck this!

737
01:33:18,095 --> 01:33:20,778
Die, die, you fucker! Die!

738
01:33:25,326 --> 01:33:26,700
Die!

739
01:33:38,733 --> 01:33:40,587
You cant kill me.

740
01:34:00,714 --> 01:34:04,008
You ugly blood-sucking fucker, die!

741
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,894
Shit!

742
01:34:21,894 --> 01:34:23,137
Jesus.

743
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:40,667
Listen.
Its going to be okay.

744
01:34:40,739 --> 01:34:44,000
IlI be right back. Okay?

745
01:34:54,402 --> 01:34:56,670
Put your head back.

746
01:35:25,469 --> 01:35:27,291
You look like shit.

747
01:35:30,044 --> 01:35:32,182
Where are you going?

748
01:35:33,692 --> 01:35:35,514
South.

749
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:37,467
You love her that much?

750
01:35:39,611 --> 01:35:41,880
We make the perfect couple.

751
01:35:41,947 --> 01:35:43,954
- Youre not leaving!
- Padre.

752
01:35:44,027 --> 01:35:45,717
Back off.

753
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:50,897
Dont make me come over there
and beat the shit out of you, Padre.

754
01:35:50,969 --> 01:35:53,238
- Back off!
- Hes a vampire, Jack!

755
01:35:55,737 --> 01:35:59,697
Rule number 1: If your partner
is ever bitten by a vampire...

756
01:36:01,016 --> 01:36:02,390
never...

757
01:36:02,456 --> 01:36:04,496
ever let him live.

758
01:36:12,854 --> 01:36:14,578
Im not a slayer anymore.

759
01:36:15,766 --> 01:36:19,540
Besides, the way I figure it...

760
01:36:19,605 --> 01:36:23,663
the two of you got plenty to do
cleaning the rest of them out.

761
01:36:23,733 --> 01:36:27,377
Meanwhile, she hides in the van out of
the sunlight while you go to the border.

762
01:36:27,444 --> 01:36:29,680
Try to catch it by nightfall.
Is that it?

763
01:36:29,748 --> 01:36:32,748
I need a vacation.

764
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:35,121
When did she first bite you?

765
01:36:37,139 --> 01:36:39,375
Two days ago.

766
01:36:39,443 --> 01:36:41,385
I still covered your ass.

767
01:36:42,418 --> 01:36:44,328
Yes, you did.

768
01:36:49,169 --> 01:36:51,274
I owe you two days back.

769
01:36:55,665 --> 01:36:58,479
- What would you say, Padre?
- Youve got two days.

770
01:37:09,678 --> 01:37:11,172
Wherever you go...

771
01:37:14,573 --> 01:37:16,428
I will find you.

772
01:37:16,493 --> 01:37:21,577
I will hunt you down,
and I will kill you.

773
01:37:21,644 --> 01:37:23,499
The girl, too.

774
01:37:33,803 --> 01:37:35,658
Vaya con Dios, my friend.

775
01:37:55,239 --> 01:37:57,443
Vaya con Dios, slayer.

776
01:38:04,550 --> 01:38:07,452
Time to slay some vampires, Padre.

777
01:38:07,526 --> 01:38:10,176
- You up for it?
- I guess so.

778
01:38:10,245 --> 01:38:13,441
- Its just the two of us.
- No, Mr. Crow.

779
01:38:13,509 --> 01:38:15,582
He was always with us.

780
01:38:21,349 --> 01:38:22,810
Fair enough.

781
01:38:24,739 --> 01:38:27,292
Let me ask you a question.

782
01:38:27,363 --> 01:38:30,591
When you were stabbing that vampire,
did you get a little wood?

783
01:38:30,659 --> 01:38:32,513
- Mahogany.
- Excuse me?

784
01:38:32,578 --> 01:38:34,683
Ebony. Teak!

785
01:38:34,754 --> 01:38:36,761
Are you possessed by demons?

786
01:38:36,834 --> 01:38:39,517
- A major chubby.
- Language, Padre.
