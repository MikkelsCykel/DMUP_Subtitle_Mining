00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,910
Hey,Jim, you ready
for your Christmas present?

4
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,491
We're now the biggest little ad agency
on the West Coast.

5
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,958
- Oh, we got it back?
- Yeah. I pitched. They caught.

6
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,250
We closed. We got the Infinity Airlines
account for the next two years.

7
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:34,334
- They love us. Yeah.
- This is great, Buddy.

8
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,170
I thought he was gonna
give me a corsage.

9
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,840
Thought he was gonna
kiss me right there.

10
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,429
- did he sign?
- Yeah, I got the signed contract
in front of me. I'm looking at it.

11
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:44,968
You want a quote? He said,
''I can't see why we would ever leave.''

12
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:48,396
- Buddy, this is great.
You did great, man. You did it.
- Yeah.

13
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:51,898
Yeah, no problem.
I'm on the 6:00 flight.

14
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,025
I think I'm flying free for life.

15
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:56,152
Hey, Buddy, you really
came through on this one.

16
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,232
- Well, what can I tell ya?
- That's some Christmas present.

17
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:02,405
No problem, man. All right.
I'll see you in a bit. Bye.

18
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:05,786
Is it supposed to snow
like this all night?

19
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:09,208
Thank you for your patience
this snowy holiday season.

20
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:11,536
- If you have not met--
- Shit.

21
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,378
O'Hare is hell with runways
and a couple of TCBYs.

22
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:17,839
- L.A.?
- Yeah. Why? Does it show?

23
00:02:17,927 --> 00:02:21,379
I-- I think I, um, flew out with you
on Tuesday. Ron Wachter.

24
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:23,928
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Buddy Amaral.
- Hello, Buddy.

25
00:02:24,017 --> 00:02:28,014
Good to see ya. I don't know. I've seen
worse. I think we'll get out of here.

26
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:30,346
- Good.
- Hey, Buddy. You made it out.

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,769
-Janice, I was gonna call you.
- Yeah, I was gonna hold my breath.

28
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:36,319
Nice talking to you.

29
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:40,271
- So did we like your dog-and-pony show?
- Well, what can I say? You know?

30
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:42,489
- Love at first sight.
- Mmm, lucky us.

31
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:44,569
- So you on the 6:00?
- Yes, I am.

32
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:46,987
-Just about to push it back.
- No.

33
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:50,082
- Mm-hmm.
- Goddam it.

34
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:52,705
Well, time for a drink?

35
00:02:52,795 --> 00:02:56,579
Yeah, that's why they called me in
on my day off. Drinks with the freight.

36
00:02:56,674 --> 00:03:00,089
So next time? Yeah? I'll call ya.

37
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:02,169
Whatever.

38
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:11,428
Oh, sorry. Sorry. It's this bag.

39
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:13,644
- I don't know where I am.
- It's all right, man.

40
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:16,353
You got your whole, uh,
Let's Go.: Europe thing happening there.

41
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:19,064
It's-- I understand.
Eurail pass, yogurt...

42
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:21,146
get stoned, see the Anne Frank house.

43
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,525
- Sorry?
- Sit down.Join us. Have a drink.

44
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:25,993
- Hi.
- This is Mimi.

45
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:28,533
- Hi.
- We've known each other
for, uh, what? Five minutes?

46
00:03:28,621 --> 00:03:31,871
- I think she's bored with me already.
- Well, thanks. Sure. Why not?

47
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,496
The line at the snack bar
is like an hour.

48
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:42,001
Let me guess. Uh, English teacher?

49
00:03:42,093 --> 00:03:46,589
- Let me guess. Agent.
- Advertising.

50
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:50,299
- It's like agenting without the heart.
- What? Am I that much of a cliché?

51
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:53,144
Hey, don't look at me.
I'm just sitting here eating nuts.

52
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:55,470
- And I'm not a teacher. I'm a writer.
- A writer?

53
00:03:55,564 --> 00:03:57,806
That's what I started out at.
Couldn't make a living.

54
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,518
- I write for TV.
- TV, huh?

55
00:04:01,612 --> 00:04:03,651
So, that, uh,
''I'm so much better than you'' look...

56
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:07,072
I saw on your face when
I said advertising, I must have,
uh, must have imagined that.

57
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,531
- Maybe on his face you imagined it.
- I got nothing against advertising.

58
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,612
- It pays me, I guess.
- That's right. It does.

59
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:14,908
- What-- What do you do again?
- I told you I'm with
the National Organ Center.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,242
- I'm in development.
- You got to love that.

61
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:21,084
I mean, she's in organ development.
Can't, uh--

62
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:25,419
She has this whole great speech on here
that David Crosby gives, actually...

63
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,503
about, uh, transplants and stuff.

64
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:29,303
It's pretty, uh, pretty compelling.

65
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:32,555
I write plays too. That's what I was
doing in Chicago. A play of mine opened.

66
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:34,302
- Oh? Good for you. Where?
- Yeah? What TV shows?

67
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:35,936
Oh, it was no big deal.
It was a little theatre.

68
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,689
Oh, I'm here again next week.
I love plays. What's it called?

69
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:40,896
No, it closed. It closed.

70
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:46,488
Um, it was a limited-- It was--
It's called Lilacs in the dooryard.

71
00:04:46,572 --> 00:04:50,107
I wonder why we have plays any more.
Hello. We got movies.

72
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:53,155
Check a movie out.
You know what I mean?

73
00:04:54,872 --> 00:04:57,707
Hmph. Not in here.

74
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,496
- Yeah.
- What's a ''dooryard''?

75
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:04,920
It's from a Whitman poem. ''When lilacs
last in the dooryard bloomed.''

76
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:09,503
Well, yeah, I mean--
What is a dooryard?

77
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:13,794
Oh, look.
They just put sandwiches out.

78
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,179
Oh, great. Okay.

79
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,844
Oh, man. Another line.

80
00:05:19,938 --> 00:05:21,646
You know, I think I'm actually
gonna go check on my flight.

81
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:23,724
- You guys want me to check yours?
Where ya headed?
- Great.

82
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:25,311
- Yeah.
- Dallas.
- Dallas?

83
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:27,193
- L.A.
- Oh, yeah, L.A., me too.

84
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:29,852
- Okay. I'll just be back in a minute.
- Thanks a lot.

85
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:34,111
- All right.
- And, uh, thanks.

86
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,288
- You don't know what a dooryard is.
- I--

87
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:41,746
This is what it is.
You have no idea. You--

88
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:45,493
Oh, this Greg guy
better stick to writing TV.

89
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:47,580
Did you read this review?

90
00:05:47,673 --> 00:05:50,923
Boy, they don't like something,
they don't keep it a secret, do they?

91
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,094
- Oh, here he comes.
- Hey, we thought we'd lost you.

92
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,849
So you're still on for 1 0:00.
They say it's gonna take off.

93
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:59,055
- Nothing for Dallas yet.
- Oh.

94
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:01,135
Yeah, it'll be tomorrow
at the earliest.

95
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,517
Bet the airport hotels are swamped.

96
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:06,476
Hey, you know what? Why don't you take
this hotel voucher? Room's guaranteed.

97
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,559
I'm gonna stick around here
and see if something opens up.

98
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:10,443
- Oh, what? You took a bump?
- Hey, you know.

99
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:14,396
Two coach tickets, anywhere
in the U.S. or Mexico, plus 200 bucks.

100
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:17,575
I did this show down in Mexico, and
I promised my kids I'd take them, so--

101
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:21,243
- Well, 200 and coach? It's--
- What? I should have haggled?

102
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:24,202
Oh, he's pulling your leg.
You did great.

103
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:27,708
Tell my wife that. Abby.
I just gave her the good news.

104
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:30,121
Turns out I was supposed to work the
Christmas tree lot with Scott tomorrow.

105
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:32,587
I forgot.
It's a father-son Cub Scout thing.

106
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:35,676
- You have any pictures?
- Yeah, sure.

107
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,389
- Oh, she's pretty.
- Isn't she?

108
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:42,467
- Yeah.
- Our neighbour Donna and Abby.

109
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,265
They went to the mall and
did these glamour photo things.

110
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:48,640
- How old are your boys?
- Scott's seven and Joey's four.

111
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:52,018
- Oh, he's so cute.
- Say hello.

112
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,150
Oh,Jesus. You're not taping over
the Crosby speech, are you?

113
00:06:54,238 --> 00:06:58,734
Oh, relax. I fast-forwarded.
Crosby's fine. He's there. Okay?

114
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:01,281
Here you go. Say something
for the transplant, uh, kids.

115
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,490
Well, uh, save a life
and become a donor.

116
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:06,657
Do what David Crosby said.
What did David say?

117
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:10,538
Uh, ''Sorry I drank.
Thanks for the liver.''

118
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:14,674
We-- We are here, for one thing, to
celebrate the opening and the closing...

119
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:18,590
- Oh, no, please.
- of the new play,
When Lilacs Something On The dooryard.

120
00:07:18,678 --> 00:07:20,801
- Right. That's it.
- And we're here with the author, uh--

121
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:22,052
- Greg.
- Greg--

122
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,553
-Janello.
- And I want to say that the critic
for the Chicago Weekly Times...

123
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:28,637
- is an idiot and an asshole...
- You read the review?

124
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,137
and wouldn't know a good play
if it punched him in the face.

125
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:34,767
- And, Abby, please, forgive him, huh?
- Infinity Airlines...

126
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:36,320
- Yeah, please.
- is pleased to announce...
- He did it for you...

127
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:38,776
- whoever you are.
- I did. I love you.
- the boarding of Flight 82
to Los Angeles.

128
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:41,782
- Uh, that's me.
- First-class passengers--

129
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:45,284
- Well--
- I'm gonna go to the men's room.

130
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,826
So it was great meeting you guys.
Thanks for, you know, nuts and...

131
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:52,247
- Yeah.
- everything.
- Yeah.

132
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:53,285
- Yeah.
- You too, man.
- Yeah.

133
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:54,921
- Nice meeting you.
- It was nice hanging out
with you guys, okay?

134
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:57,413
- All righty.
- Hey, good luck getting,
uh, wherever you're going.

135
00:07:57,508 --> 00:07:59,500
You too. Good night.

136
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:01,586
See ya.

137
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:06,720
Well, if you ever get to Dallas.

138
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:15,607
Hey, Greg. Greg!

139
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:19,441
- Hey!
- Go sell a Christmas tree for me.

140
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:24,032
- What?
- Go ahead. Take it.

141
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:27,153
No, I-- I want the layover,
if you know what I mean.

142
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:31,741
You know, Mimi, organ development,
video camera. Think about it.

143
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,241
This is incredibly generous.
I just wanted to say that.

144
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:36,458
It's a comp. It's free.
Take it. It's fine.

145
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:39,001
Oh. Oops.

146
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,459
- Hey.
- Hello, sir.

147
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:45,422
- I really appreciate it.
- Look, man, you're doing me a favour.

148
00:08:45,513 --> 00:08:46,888
- You're saving my marriage.
- You hear me?

149
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:48,965
- You have no idea.
- Take care of yourself.

150
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:50,600
- Thanks a lot. All right. See ya.
- All right. Take it easy.

151
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:54,932
- It was great meeting ya.
- Your ticket?

152
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:57,560
You know what?
You just took it.

153
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,642
What?

154
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:17,367
- Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the final boarding call...
- Still have that, uh, hotel voucher?

155
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:18,871
for Flight 82 to Los Angeles.

156
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:21,833
- Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the final boarding call...
- Don't you just love air travel?

157
00:09:21,923 --> 00:09:23,797
for Flight 82 to Los Angel--

158
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,050
Can I get you something else, sir?
Something to drink?

159
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:37,470
What? Sorry.

160
00:09:37,564 --> 00:09:40,481
Can I get you something to drink?
Some coffee, soda, water?

161
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,689
Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine.

162
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:36,653
- E-mails--
- Ever since America--

163
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:38,122
- What time is it?
- We're here at
the O'Hare Airport Sheraton...

164
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:40,697
- where friends and family
of passengers of Flight 82...
- Something happened.

165
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:43,627
have gathered to await bulletins
from Infinity Airlines.

166
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:47,543
Now, once again,
if you arejust tuning in, about an hour
and eight minutes after take-off...

167
00:10:47,632 --> 00:10:52,128
Infinity Flight 82, the last flight to
take off from O'Hare before it closed...

168
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,426
disappeared from
radar screens over Kansas.

169
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:57,384
Now this has not been officially
confirmed by Infinity...

170
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:00,144
but we're hearing reports
from Marysville, Kansas...

171
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:02,765
that a crash site
indeed has been found.

172
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:16,825
Hello? Mom, what is it?
Is something wrong?

173
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,152
Chicago.

174
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:21,238
No, he's coming back tomorrow.
What--

175
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:26,033
What?

176
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:28,286
Oh,Jesus. They said Infinity?

177
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,582
No, no, no. Okay,
he's-- he's-- he's not taking that.

178
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:35,961
I spoke to him. Mother, stop it.

179
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:39,968
Will you put--
Will you put Les on the phone, please?

180
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:42,596
Just put--

181
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:44,144
Oh--

182
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:50,099
Les, what's the flight number?

183
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:55,188
Oh, thank God.
No, he's not on that flight.

184
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,235
He's coming back tomorrow.
He-- He hasn't even left yet.

185
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:03,993
Tell her--
What is she saying?

186
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:08,410
Because he probably doesn't know.
He's in an airport hotel or something.

187
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:12,085
Listen, I'll-- I'll call you
as soon as I know anything, okay?

188
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:14,924
I just don't want to tie up the--
the phone right now.

189
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:17,297
Okay.

190
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:30,519
Now with 56--

191
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:34,106
Aviation sources tell us that
in an air disaster of this magnitude...

192
00:12:34,194 --> 00:12:37,479
those aboard the plane,
208 passengers and eight crew members...

193
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:39,565
would be unlikely to survive.

194
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:43,026
Witnesses near the scene,
some 7 5 miles northwest of Topeka...

195
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:46,488
report seeing a huge fireball
seconds after impact.

196
00:12:46,581 --> 00:12:48,573
We are looking now at pictures
of the field--

197
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:08,179
- Hey,Janice.
- Oh, God, Buddy!

198
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:11,684
- I knew three girls on the crew,
and the co-pilot was my friend.
- Yeah, listen.

199
00:13:11,772 --> 00:13:15,639
We got a problem, okay?
The roster's not right.

200
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:18,356
- Oh,Jesus.
- You got to get into the system.

201
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:20,568
- Can you do that?
- Who was he?

202
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:25,401
J-A-N-E-L-L-O. Greg Janello.

203
00:13:27,913 --> 00:13:30,320
Was he on that flight?

204
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,452
Thank you.

205
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:42,044
Okay, so, um, Flight 31 ?
That's leaving when?

206
00:13:45,013 --> 00:13:48,429
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

207
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:51,636
Okay. See? Now you can relax.

208
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,638
- I just wish he would call me.
- Yeah, well, he's asleep.

209
00:13:56,732 --> 00:14:00,433
You don't get news reports
when you're sleeping.

210
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:03,101
Come on. Drink this.
Then I'm gonna go home.

211
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:06,613
And if you need me,
I'm just across the street.

212
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:09,026
Don't you have anything better
than this to eat? I'm so hungry.

213
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,657
- I want something bad.
- Mama?

214
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:14,997
- Hey, what are you doing up?
- Can I watch TV?

215
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:18,616
No, silly-billy.
Ya can't watch TV.

216
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:20,705
Now come on.
Let Aunt Donna tuck ya right back in.

217
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:24,712
I'll take care of him.
Oh, my big boy!

218
00:15:10,596 --> 00:15:13,467
What time is it in Chicago?

219
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:16,013
It's 9:00.

220
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:22,306
Jesus Christ, Donna.
Where the hell is he?

221
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,855
- I don't know.
- Hey.

222
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:27,315
There is someone at the door.

223
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:35,071
Mrs Janello?

224
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:37,403
- Are you from the airline?
- Yes.

225
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:40,332
I'm Kevin Walters,
and this is Ellen Seitz.

226
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:44,746
- Um, ma'am, the reason that we're--
- No. He's-- He's taking a later flight.

227
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:48,088
When's the last time
you spoke to him?

228
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:52,753
Um, well, last night
at about 8:00.

229
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:55,597
Uh, 8:00.
That's 1 0:00 p.m., Chicago.

230
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:58,255
We have conflicting manifests.
One of them--

231
00:15:58,351 --> 00:16:01,102
We can't tell yet
if it's accurate or not--

232
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:03,180
One of them lists your husband
on Flight 82.

233
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:08,100
No, see, I know he got-- he got--
he got bumped. He's on a later flight.

234
00:16:08,194 --> 00:16:10,482
Um, we have a crisis centre at LAX.

235
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:13,109
That's where the first news will be.

236
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,617
Okay.Just a minute.

237
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,994
- Nope.
- Okay, okay. We're gonna go together.

238
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:31,081
- And Jack is gonna watch the children.
- Donna. Do not cry.

239
00:16:32,843 --> 00:16:36,046
- please do not cry.
- I'm not crying.

240
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,561
Ladies and gentlemen, we are making
our final approach into Los Angeles.

241
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,874
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

242
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,044
- So this flight was okay?
- Well, it landed.

243
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,750
- Yeah.
- You know, that's good. How ya been?

244
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,833
Okay. How you been?

245
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:17,048
Those poor people.
It's terrible.

246
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:05,757
Mrs Janello. This--

247
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:15,021
Oh! Oh, no! Don't touch me!
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

248
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:17,232
Stay away! No!

249
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:44,677
- You want a drink?
- Uh, no, thanks.

250
00:18:46,848 --> 00:18:50,383
Infinity's already called. They want us
to help out with damage control...

251
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:52,802
TV spots, print, you know.

252
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:55,019
Yeah.

253
00:18:56,816 --> 00:19:00,150
Weather conditions there
improved somewhat this afternoon...

254
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:03,071
allowing for the removal of several
sections of the downed plane--

255
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:06,774
So you might want to go easy
on the drinking.

256
00:19:06,868 --> 00:19:08,991
- I don't want you hung over.
- Along with the aeroplane's
data recorder...

257
00:19:09,078 --> 00:19:11,071
which was located
and retrieved earlier today.

258
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:13,156
- So first thing tomorrow, okay?
- The fuselage section--

259
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:27,967
- George, line three.
- Got it. Thanks.

260
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:30,628
- Yeah, take down the blue ones.
- They're waiting on ya.

261
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:33,642
- Hey, Dionne, where's Jim?
- Yeah.

262
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:36,847
- No, they're all in a meeting.
-Jim?

263
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:39,512
- Conference room.
- Hey. What is this?

264
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:43,819
What happened to six months trying
to create a consistent, you know,
brand image in the public eye?

265
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:45,612
Who okayed-- What is this?
This is dog shit.

266
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:48,817
Buddy, come on. It's just
giving families numbers to call, okay?

267
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:52,324
- It's not like tomorrow's ad.
- Hey, weren't you supposed
to be on that plane?

268
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:56,659
No, I, uh, stayed over another night.
What do you mean, tomorrow's ad?

269
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,869
- I think you want
to recut the commercial--
- That's Todd Exner, damage control.

270
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:02,333
- please, people, um--
- Infinity.

271
00:20:02,422 --> 00:20:04,913
- We don't have a lot of time today.
- I'll be brief.

272
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:08,092
I want to thank you all for your ideas,
but, uh, I'm gonna recommend...

273
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:11,463
to the board that we go
with the concept that, uh,Josh
and Sharon have been working on.

274
00:20:11,556 --> 00:20:14,509
That's Karen actually.

275
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,640
It's based on a wire photo
out of Chicago.

276
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:19,728
I'm gonna need someone to lock down
the rights on this pronto.

277
00:20:19,814 --> 00:20:22,435
Is that a joke?
You gotta be kidding me.

278
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:25,728
You're not gonna run
this sentimental, self-serving crap.

279
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,192
- Excuse me?
- I mean, who cares how
Infinity Airlines feel?

280
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,901
Who gives a shit?
They crashed the plane. So what, right?

281
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:33,363
Uh, happens all the time.
They'll do an investigation.

282
00:20:33,452 --> 00:20:36,369
The FAA in ten months will say
it was a hydraulic line...

283
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:38,993
or a fuel line or a rudder
or something, right?

284
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:41,538
I mean, shit happens.
It happens to TWA. It happens to Delta.

285
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:44,663
It happens to United. Why are we gonna
take responsibility for bad luck?

286
00:20:44,755 --> 00:20:46,996
I don't think we want
to hide our heads in the sand.

287
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:51,218
plus, you don't originate campaigns.
Okay, Karen? Neither do you,Josh.

288
00:20:51,303 --> 00:20:53,295
We all do, together.

289
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:55,179
Buddy, this is not about
running the ball around you.

290
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:57,257
Okay, let's get on this, all right?

291
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,141
I want to fax a copy
to the board by noon.

292
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:02,263
USA Today, New York Times,
Chicago Tribune, L.A. Times.

293
00:21:02,355 --> 00:21:03,814
Okay? Come on. Let's go.

294
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:11,020
She was the little girl who won prizes
for her art in grade school...

295
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:17,158
swam on her high school team...

296
00:21:17,244 --> 00:21:21,953
married her college sweetheart
and started a family.

297
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:27,418
While the people of Infinity
mourn the loss of Carol Wilson...

298
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:29,497
flight attendant...

299
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,006
the people of Clayton, Missouri,
mourn the girl they grew up with.

300
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:36,842
Hey, Buddy. Look, I can cover you for
like five months of staff meetings...

301
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,804
but not six, okay?

302
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:40,717
Will you call me, please?

303
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:43,181
Carol, who told friends...

304
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,137
¨¨When you fall down,
get up and try again. '¨

305
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:51,476
Who said, ¨¨When it's dark outside...

306
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,061
it's up to us
to look for the light. '¨

307
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:58,568
Boy, kind of makes you wish you crashed
more often, doesn't it, Todd?

308
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,487
There are 2 1 6 stories of our friends
and family on Flight 82.

309
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,538
This one is Carol's.

310
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:17,259
And this year's winner for
the best national campaign is...

311
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:24,385
Tang-Weller-- client: Infinity Air,
the ¨¨We Remember¨¨ series.

312
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:29,105
- You sit down.
-Jim, what are you doing?

313
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,431
- Sit down.
- No,Jim. It's my account.

314
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:34,360
- It's my account.
- please.
- Can't you control this idiot?

315
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:42,863
Next year. Next year.

316
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,823
Congratulations.

317
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:56,537
Uh, this is terrific. Thank you.

318
00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:59,206
Thank you for this award.
It's great.

319
00:22:59,302 --> 00:23:02,801
Uh, boy, it's so heavy.

320
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:04,763
That's what you're
supposed to say, right?

321
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:08,514
That and, uh, ''Oh, this is
what it looks like up close.''

322
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:12,102
It's, uh-- But thank you.
This is great. Uh--

323
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,689
It's good to see all of you.
It really is.

324
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:20,734
'Cause I've been, uh-- I haven't
been around much this year and, uh--

325
00:23:20,823 --> 00:23:23,029
You know--

326
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:25,489
See, I was supposed
to be on that flight.

327
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:27,617
Yeah.

328
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:33,078
It's ironic, 'cause I could have
been one of those people who--

329
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:36,418
who believed so much in
Infinity Airlines that they were...

330
00:23:36,505 --> 00:23:40,372
glad to die just so it could show
how well it handled it, really.

331
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:42,460
You know, isn't that
what we're sayin'?

332
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:45,886
''Hey, we crashed,
but we're hurting...

333
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:50,765
and we're humble, and, uh,
we're ready to sell some tickets.''

334
00:23:50,852 --> 00:23:52,679
All right. Thank you!
Thank you very much.

335
00:23:52,771 --> 00:23:56,638
Um, thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.

336
00:23:56,733 --> 00:24:00,351
Shame about the dead people. It's an ill
wind, but it blew us right onto the map!

337
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:02,272
please. Come on.

338
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:05,649
It's fine,Jim. I'm fine.
All right. Get off me.

339
00:24:05,742 --> 00:24:07,533
No more. No more.

340
00:24:13,124 --> 00:24:16,789
So is there a party after?

341
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:32,555
Now that you're done with rehab,
what's next? Uh, meetings, counselling?

342
00:24:32,643 --> 00:24:35,264
No, I'm good. I'm fine.
I just want to get back to work.

343
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:38,355
You know what? You should take
your time. I mean, we're in good shape.

344
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,599
How could you be in good shape?
I've been gone for 90 days.

345
00:24:40,692 --> 00:24:43,777
Hey, hey, you've been gone for a year,
since the crash, but who's counting?

346
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:47,611
- You look good though.
- Yeah.

347
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:49,692
- Think it'll take?
- Yeah.

348
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:52,276
Hmm? Feeling good?

349
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:54,363
Good.

350
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:10,092
Ah, here.
Two floors, 24,000 square feet.

351
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,509
Uh, employee and client parking, and
within one block we have two banks...

352
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,969
a Kinko's and
a couple dozen Starbucks.

353
00:25:18,062 --> 00:25:20,055
- Oh, what's the rent?
- No, no, no, we buy.

354
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:23,267
I've already got a deal with the owner.
You know, he wants to get out
of the landlord business.

355
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:28,270
Old guy, not very sawy. He'll do it
for 1 .8 and without a broker.

356
00:25:30,324 --> 00:25:32,364
Wow. Sounds great.

357
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:34,693
When do I, uh--
When do I get to see it?

358
00:25:34,787 --> 00:25:36,993
That is assuming, you-- you know,
you want my input.

359
00:25:37,081 --> 00:25:41,493
Look, it's gonna be great, Buddy.
You're gonna love it.

360
00:25:41,585 --> 00:25:44,621
Don't fight it because
you were out of the loop.

361
00:25:44,713 --> 00:25:49,174
I-- I know, man.Jim, come on. It's
great. It's fine. It's gonna be great.

362
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:51,797
- Oh.
- Okay?
- Oh.

363
00:25:51,887 --> 00:25:55,137
Just--Just excuse me
for a second.

364
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,998
Sure you want to do that?

365
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:27,956
Whoop!

366
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:30,419
Wrong drink. It's mine.
It's apple juice.

367
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:32,500
Right.

368
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:42,424
Uh, you don't want to stare at me
like that in the men's room.

369
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,642
It's sexual harassment.

370
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:50,232
Are you kidding? I'm not gay.

371
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,103
No, but I am,
and you are my boss.

372
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:57,447
- At least, officially so.
- Since when?

373
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:01,033
Since about a week after
they shipped you to palm Springs.

374
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:04,038
You had some sort of a breakdown
during an awards ceremony?

375
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,200
Or that-- That's what I heard.

376
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,499
It wasn't a breakdown, okay?
It was an episode.

377
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:12,833
- What do you do here exactly?
- Uh, p.A. Office floater.

378
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:15,415
I work with the computers mostly.

379
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,673
Would that have been your first drink
since they released you?

380
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:22,516
Boy, you got some nerve, kid.

381
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,051
Relax. I'm a drunk too.

382
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:29,312
Six years sober. AA and NA.

383
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:35,644
- We hired you?
- Well, I had to sign
a no-episode clause, but yeah.

384
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:39,107
Look, if you want some help with
your reentry, I'd be happy to oblige.

385
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,322
Just, you know, don't screw up.

386
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,743
There's a lot of really
nice people working here,
and why should they pay for your shit?

387
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,119
'Cause I own 20%% of the company.

388
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,615
And in case you were picking pimples
when they covered this in your rehab...

389
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,501
alcoholism is a disease.

390
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:55,287
Yeah, yeah, they--
You can catch it from open bottles.

391
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:01,007
You're not gonna make me feel guilty
for something I had no control of.

392
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,883
Oh, oh, you're--
you're that type. Cool.

393
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,928
When was the last time
anything was your fault?

394
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,096
I don't believe this guy.

395
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:14,649
Did they do AA up where
they dried you out? You know,
the whole 1 2 steps, all that jazz?

396
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:18,317
Yeah, yeah, they tried,
but I don't believe in God.

397
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:20,397
He'll be crushed when He finds out.

398
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,990
You're not gonna last
a week sober.

399
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,750
- Fuck you.
- Welcome back, Boss.

400
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:35,493
Hey, pS, you're fired.

401
00:29:48,492 --> 00:29:52,110
Livin'in the middle of the ocean

402
00:29:52,204 --> 00:29:56,036
With no future, no past

403
00:29:56,124 --> 00:30:00,074
And everything
that's good right now, well

404
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:04,002
I don't wish for it to last

405
00:30:04,758 --> 00:30:08,091
I'll step through brilliant shades

406
00:30:08,178 --> 00:30:11,048
Every colour you bring

407
00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:15,433
'Cause this time, this time, this time

408
00:30:15,518 --> 00:30:19,136
Is finejust as it is

409
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:25,233
And today is whatever
I want it to mean

410
00:30:27,238 --> 00:30:29,231
Today

411
00:30:29,323 --> 00:30:32,277
Is whatever I want it to mean

412
00:30:32,368 --> 00:30:35,867
Yeah, hey, hey

413
00:30:35,955 --> 00:30:41,115
Ooh, hey, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

414
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,203
Yeah, yeah

415
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:54,467
- Hello?
- Uh, just a minute.

416
00:30:54,556 --> 00:30:56,964
Okay, come on. Get in here.
Come on.

417
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,051
Come on, come on.

418
00:31:08,445 --> 00:31:10,153
- Hi. Hello.
- Hi.

419
00:31:10,238 --> 00:31:13,689
I'm sorry. I just had to,
uh, put the dog in the bathroom.

420
00:31:13,783 --> 00:31:16,321
Hi. I'm Abby Janello,
Vinegrove Realty.

421
00:31:16,411 --> 00:31:19,614
Buddy Amaral, just driving by,
saw your sign.

422
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:22,244
You know what? Actually
the dog's not supposed to be here...

423
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:25,003
but, um, my friend who was
supposed to-- to watch him--

424
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:28,419
he can't be left alone--
she has a doctor's appointment.

425
00:31:28,506 --> 00:31:32,551
Everything's fine and then,
involuntary urination.

426
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:34,628
Well, I hope the doctor
doesn't keep her waiting.

427
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:38,508
No, the dog.

428
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:42,846
Oh, right. You're kidding.
That's very funny.

429
00:31:42,937 --> 00:31:45,344
- Well--
- This is a wonderful property.

430
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:48,642
It's, uh, Buddy, right?
Are you interested?

431
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:51,486
You want to check it out?
You know, it'll just take a minute.

432
00:31:53,947 --> 00:31:56,355
Sure.

433
00:31:58,118 --> 00:32:02,579
Um-- Sorry. The last, uh, person
I showed this to smoked.

434
00:32:02,664 --> 00:32:07,291
- ...in coffee prices should the bad
weather continue in South America.
- Um-- Oh, crap.

435
00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:11,291
Uh, there's been a lot of interest
in this property.

436
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:14,086
Turn down the news.

437
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:19,632
That's better, right?
Um, okay. Well, here is the set-up.

438
00:32:19,723 --> 00:32:23,056
And there's my card.
Um, that beeper number's actually--

439
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:28,018
Ow! I'm-- I'm actually between beeper
numbers at the moment, so, you know--

440
00:32:28,106 --> 00:32:30,098
-Just ignore that. Um--
- Maybe you should let him out.

441
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:33,275
So, um, what, uh--
what line of business are you in?

442
00:32:33,361 --> 00:32:35,353
What's his name?

443
00:32:36,906 --> 00:32:40,738
- The dog. What's his name?
- Fred.

444
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,988
You know what?
He-- He-- He doesn't like people.

445
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:48,247
And he's not trained,
because I've only had him a year.

446
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:53,286
Hey, Fred, it's okay.
Hey, Fred, Fred. Come on. Got ya, Fred.

447
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,334
See? I'm great with dogs. Fred.
Rottweilers are great.

448
00:32:56,425 --> 00:33:00,505
I had one when I was a kid.
Fred, good boy. Here you go. See?

449
00:33:02,556 --> 00:33:06,767
Yeah. Um, you know what?
Actually, do you mind coming back?

450
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:09,971
Oh, my God. My-- My boss is--
My boss is coming right now...

451
00:33:10,063 --> 00:33:12,981
and, uh, well, I think it would be
better if you came at like noon.

452
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,362
-I'm sorry. Is something wrong?
-I didn't say it was a Rottweiler, okay?

453
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:25,115
I saw you-- I saw you
with the dog outside.

454
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:29,153
That was half an hour ago. You said you
were just-- you were just passing by.

455
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:31,870
I was. I was passing by
half an hour ago.

456
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,952
I went to a meeting,
and I came here.

457
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,370
I swear to God if you say one more word
I'm-- I'm gonna open this door.

458
00:33:36,464 --> 00:33:39,630
All right, calm down. Whoa.
All right, hold on.

459
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:42,173
All right. Y-Y-You don't understand.
Everything's fine, okay?

460
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:44,254
- Easy. Easy, Fred. Fred! Fred!
- Get out!

461
00:33:44,347 --> 00:33:46,469
Fred! No, Fred!

462
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:49,048
- Buddy! Stop it!
- Lady! Lady!

463
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:51,598
- Buddy! Buddy! Stop it!
- I'm just lying here!

464
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:54,308
- I'm not doing anything!
- Not you! The dog!

465
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,640
- Buddy! Come on! Buddy!
- Dog? What? Ow! My leg!

466
00:33:59,194 --> 00:34:02,065
Come on! Let's go! All right.

467
00:34:02,156 --> 00:34:04,825
- You told me the dog's name was Fred!
- Sorry.
- Damn it!

468
00:34:04,908 --> 00:34:08,657
- My God!
- I probably pissed him off
calling him Fred.

469
00:34:08,745 --> 00:34:13,407
What was I supposed to do, you know?
You can't go around telling a client
that they've got a dog's name!

470
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,951
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not. Look at this.

471
00:34:17,045 --> 00:34:20,461
Look at the jacket, the pants.
I didn't see a licence on the dog.
Does the dog have a licence?

472
00:34:20,548 --> 00:34:23,633
Oh, my God, please.
You don't understand.
I cannot lose this job, okay?

473
00:34:23,718 --> 00:34:29,175
If you cause trouble, I-- I-- please!
You've got to let me take care of it.

474
00:34:31,684 --> 00:34:35,468
I got him about
a year ago for my boys.

475
00:34:35,563 --> 00:34:39,892
They like him. It's just--
It's a lot of work, and-- I don't know.

476
00:34:39,984 --> 00:34:44,812
I think they think of him as
a consolation prize for their father.

477
00:34:44,905 --> 00:34:49,484
He, um-- divorced me last year.

478
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:52,780
Well, we-- we divorced each other.

479
00:34:52,872 --> 00:34:55,707
Oh.

480
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:58,364
I didn't do it to bribe them.
I swear.

481
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,125
I just thought that, you know,
it'd be a good distraction.

482
00:35:02,214 --> 00:35:05,334
Worked better on Joey,
'cause he's only five.

483
00:35:05,425 --> 00:35:10,253
Yeah, I was almost married once
myself a couple of years ago.

484
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:13,099
- Really? What happened?
- Oh, I don't know.

485
00:35:13,183 --> 00:35:15,888
Some couples are lucky.
Some aren't.

486
00:35:15,977 --> 00:35:20,307
Yeah. We weren't so lucky.

487
00:35:22,484 --> 00:35:26,647
Greg used to, uh, write for
this TV show called The Midnighter.

488
00:35:26,738 --> 00:35:29,858
Did-- Did you-- Did you ever
watch that? It was syndicated.

489
00:35:29,949 --> 00:35:34,777
He wrote some episodes.
I mean, I mean, he still, you know,
writes episodes 'cause he's on staff.

490
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,158
You only took two puffs
of your last one.

491
00:35:41,252 --> 00:35:43,577
That's 'cause I don't really smoke.

492
00:35:44,755 --> 00:35:48,089
Yeah, well, last year
I started chewing the gum, you know?

493
00:35:48,175 --> 00:35:50,215
Because my friend Donna--
She was trying to quit smoking.

494
00:35:50,302 --> 00:35:52,793
And she found out that the gum
was soothing to the nerves.

495
00:35:52,888 --> 00:35:55,177
So I started chewing it,
then I got hooked on the gum.

496
00:35:55,266 --> 00:36:01,268
And then I got TMJ from the chewing,
so this is just to get me off the gum.

497
00:36:01,355 --> 00:36:04,024
I'm ten days off the gum.

498
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:07,311
Sounds like a good plan.
Next week you'll be on heroin.

499
00:36:07,402 --> 00:36:10,985
- Oh, God.
- Hey, mister.

500
00:36:11,073 --> 00:36:13,908
- Hey, mister, it's ready.
- See?
- Oh.

501
00:36:13,992 --> 00:36:16,483
- An hour or less.
- Look at that.

502
00:36:16,578 --> 00:36:19,116
Um, listen, when you--
When you get the bill, you know...

503
00:36:19,206 --> 00:36:21,779
for having the pants rewoven,
I want you to send it to me.

504
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:25,125
There's my number. I'm serious.
please. please. Not a discussion.

505
00:36:25,211 --> 00:36:27,251
Thank you.

506
00:36:30,091 --> 00:36:32,712
Oh.

507
00:36:32,802 --> 00:36:34,878
- Thanks.
- Sure.

508
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:37,047
Come on, babe.

509
00:36:38,474 --> 00:36:41,843
Well, it was nice
to meet you and Buddy.

510
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:48,690
You, uh-- You weren't really interested
in seeing any property, were you?

511
00:36:51,028 --> 00:36:55,441
Copies. Sign's still up there. And
you launched into your whole spiel...

512
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:57,525
- Okay. Okay. I know.
- and the dog and I--

513
00:36:57,618 --> 00:36:59,610
I'm sorry.

514
00:37:03,248 --> 00:37:04,826
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

515
00:37:04,917 --> 00:37:06,909
- Take care.
- Bye-bye.

516
00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:18,884
Oh, for God sake!
What the hell did you eat?

517
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:24,184
- The thing about heroes
is they demand more--
- Yeah,Judy.

518
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:29,856
Tell Karen that the-- the colour
on the GMC animatic is way, way too hot.

519
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:33,357
And before we test, I want
to go non-announce on the VO.

520
00:37:33,444 --> 00:37:36,362
Keep-- You know, get the guy
who did Southwest for us last summer.

521
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:40,825
- You-- L-Listen to this.
- In the tradition
of the great GMC truck--

522
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,903
Yeah. Okay? Not that.

523
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:45,118
Come on, you guys.

524
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:49,246
Get it together. Oh.

525
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:10,354
Hey, Scott, I said lights out.
I mean it.

526
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:14,388
- Hello.
- Uh, hello. Uh, is this Abby Janello?

527
00:38:14,484 --> 00:38:17,818
Uh, yes, this is--
this is her-- she?

528
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:20,989
- Uh, this is Buddy Amaral.
- Oh.

529
00:38:21,074 --> 00:38:24,110
- You know, the guy from the strip mall.
- Mm-hmm. Of course.

530
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,907
Um, did you-- did you get
an estimate on the pants?

531
00:38:26,997 --> 00:38:30,448
No. don't worry about the suit.
I-It's business, right? Listen.

532
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,578
My firm, Tang-Weller,
we're, uh, we're relocating here.

533
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,873
We're trying to get out
of this building, and our current
realtors aren't quite cutting it.

534
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:39,882
I thought, you know,
maybe you could help us out.

535
00:38:39,968 --> 00:38:43,134
Me? Uh, you know what?
I don't, uh--

536
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:47,633
We have about 7,000 square feet here.
We need about three
or four times as much.

537
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:51,260
To buy, not to lease.
Somewhere under two.

538
00:38:51,354 --> 00:38:54,224
- Can you do that?
- M-Million? Two-- Two million.

539
00:38:54,315 --> 00:38:57,232
Yeah. What do you think?

540
00:38:57,318 --> 00:39:00,687
You know, why me? You know,
I honestly don't have the experience.

541
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:03,864
'Cause you're hungry.
You'll try harder, you know.

542
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:06,736
I'm hungry because I suck, okay?

543
00:39:06,827 --> 00:39:09,828
You know what? Let me put you
in touch with Norma, because
she's really the one that handles--

544
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:12,487
You know-- You know, I just--
I would rather that, uh, you did it.

545
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,370
And could you come by the office
around 1 0:00 on Monday?

546
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,461
And it'd be great
if you had two or three properties
to show us right then, you know?

547
00:39:18,547 --> 00:39:21,382
Same area.
Venice, Santa Monica, Marina del Rey.

548
00:39:21,466 --> 00:39:26,461
And there's one property
in particular that I'd like you
to show us on Abbott Kinney.

549
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:30,422
- 1 8385--
- Uh, hold on one sec.

550
00:39:30,517 --> 00:39:33,850
1 8385 Abbott Kinney.
The seller is primed.

551
00:39:33,937 --> 00:39:36,724
In fact, he doesn't even
have a broker, so, who knows?

552
00:39:36,815 --> 00:39:39,103
Maybe you can book
a double commission.

553
00:39:39,192 --> 00:39:41,683
I can give it a shot,
you know, but, uh--

554
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:44,565
Great. I'll call you
at your office tomorrow
and fax you over the specifics--

555
00:39:44,655 --> 00:39:46,031
- Say thank you.
- What?
- What we're looking for.

556
00:39:46,115 --> 00:39:48,108
- That kind of thing.
- Say thank you.
- You okay with this?

557
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:52,364
Uh, uh, yes. Yeah, sure.
It's fine. Thank you.

558
00:39:52,455 --> 00:39:55,124
Great. All right. Good night.

559
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:02,372
- He wants to give me some business.
- I'll bet.

560
00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:09,543
Yeah, yeah, I know. I know.
But when do you need it by?

561
00:40:11,598 --> 00:40:16,094
Hi. I'm Abby Janello.
I'm here to see Buddy Amaral.

562
00:40:16,186 --> 00:40:20,350
I'm early. Should I just
sit down or-- Oh, sorry.

563
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,433
- Okay, well, it's on its way.
- Excuse me. Hey.

564
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:31,199
- Abby?
- Oh, hi.

565
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:32,778
Hey.

566
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:36,452
Gee, I hope you're not getting too
optimistic. You're, uh, packing already?

567
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:39,742
Oh, no, there were-- Uh, there were--
there was a problem with this.

568
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:43,203
Uh, the matt job.
I don't think they were acid free,
which is key for matting.

569
00:40:43,296 --> 00:40:45,703
You should always make sure
that your matts are acid free.

570
00:40:45,798 --> 00:40:49,001
Otherwise, you'll, uh-- you'll--

571
00:40:49,093 --> 00:40:51,880
- Have acid.
- Exactly.

572
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,673
Well, I read through
the materials...

573
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:58,383
that you faxed over about your set-up
and your business here and, uh--

574
00:40:58,477 --> 00:41:00,636
Oh, I-- I don't know
much about advertising...

575
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,722
if you don't count Bewitched.

576
00:41:02,815 --> 00:41:04,807
Well, we got our share
of twitching noses here...

577
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,483
but with our drug intervention
programme, that's on the decline.

578
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,061
-Joke.
- Oh, that's very funny.

579
00:41:11,156 --> 00:41:14,525
- Did you find any properties?
- Yeah, I, uh--

580
00:41:14,618 --> 00:41:16,943
I have three besides
the one that you mentioned.

581
00:41:17,037 --> 00:41:19,706
- The owner gave you the listing?
- Yeah, but I had to promise him...

582
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,372
that I'd get a higher price
to make up for the commission.

583
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:28,122
Um, there is an offer for 1 .8,
but it-- it seems fishy.

584
00:41:28,215 --> 00:41:30,503
Yeah. Look, you know what?

585
00:41:30,592 --> 00:41:33,712
When you bring it up to Jim,
just say you found it.

586
00:41:33,803 --> 00:41:36,341
- Who's Jim?
-Jim's my partner.

587
00:41:36,431 --> 00:41:39,515
partner and boss, sort of.
Remember Larry Tate?

588
00:41:39,601 --> 00:41:43,433
He doesn't always like my ideas. Uh,
I think if you said it was yours just--

589
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:45,977
- Oh, I don't know. I don't know
if I'm so comfortable with that.
- No, it's fine. Believe me.

590
00:41:46,065 --> 00:41:49,268
- Ah, you must be--
- Abby Janello, Vinegrove Realty.

591
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,353
- You must be Larry.
-Jim.

592
00:41:51,446 --> 00:41:53,771
Jim. I'm pleased to meet you.

593
00:41:53,865 --> 00:41:55,987
Ah. Well, hey,
any friend of Buddy's.

594
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:58,946
Um, so you two guys
met at palm Springs?

595
00:41:59,036 --> 00:42:01,243
- No. No, I--
- Well, should we get going?
Is your car outside?

596
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,406
Uh, yeah. Listen, I've got the, uh,
meeting with the attorney at 1 :00...

597
00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:05,491
so we should probably
take two cars.

598
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:08,206
Okay, um, I'll drive us,
if that's okay with you.

599
00:42:08,295 --> 00:42:11,249
Uh, sure. Great. I just have some papers
in the car that I should--

600
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:14,092
- Or we can just meet you
out right out front?
- Okay.

601
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:16,334
Don't, uh, mention palm Springs.

602
00:42:16,428 --> 00:42:18,421
- It's supposed to be anonymous.
- Oh, right. Oh, right.

603
00:42:18,514 --> 00:42:20,886
And-- And-- And you made
a Larry Tate crack before I came in.

604
00:42:20,974 --> 00:42:22,350
No.

605
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:28,353
Half an hour maybe.
She's got one more space to show me,
so I should be there before--

606
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,520
Ah, shit. No.
Not this building.

607
00:42:32,611 --> 00:42:34,650
Oh.

608
00:42:44,706 --> 00:42:48,573
Buddy. Can I speak with you?

609
00:42:50,753 --> 00:42:53,754
I do have other--

610
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,046
- This is the building.
- Oh, you think so?

611
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:59,337
No, no, no. This is the building,
the one I want. The photos?

612
00:42:59,428 --> 00:43:01,587
Oh. I gave her the specs.

613
00:43:01,681 --> 00:43:03,720
I guess there's only so much
inventory on the market, huh?

614
00:43:03,808 --> 00:43:06,559
I wanna kill him.
I mean, we had a deal and now
he goes and gets himself a broker.

615
00:43:06,644 --> 00:43:10,558
Look, we can't let her show us this.
We gotta get out of here
before the broker shows up.

616
00:43:10,648 --> 00:43:13,851
Hey, Abby, when's the, uh,
seller's broker showin' up?

617
00:43:13,942 --> 00:43:18,022
Um, I'm-- I-- I'm the seller's broker.
It's my listing.

618
00:43:20,324 --> 00:43:22,316
Look, I understand
your disappointment...

619
00:43:22,409 --> 00:43:24,402
but the seller
was bound to get some advice.

620
00:43:24,494 --> 00:43:27,365
No one would let him
do a deal of that size without
a broker or a lawyer or someone.

621
00:43:27,456 --> 00:43:28,784
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

622
00:43:28,874 --> 00:43:32,077
And how did he happen
to, uh, find you?

623
00:43:32,169 --> 00:43:37,126
Um, I approached him. Look, he's gonna
list it 2.1 . That's still under market.

624
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:41,082
He was gonna sell it to me for 1 .8.

625
00:43:41,177 --> 00:43:43,502
Well, say you go in at 1 .9,
what were you putting down?

626
00:43:43,596 --> 00:43:47,890
Well, we were thinking of, uh, 30%%
of 1 .8 at a fixed eight and a half.

627
00:43:47,976 --> 00:43:51,226
You'd be tying up a lot of cash
for a commercial property.

628
00:43:51,312 --> 00:43:54,681
I mean, I say you go in at 20, 25, at
the most, and free up some of that cash.

629
00:43:54,774 --> 00:44:00,859
Thirty percent of 1 .8 is what?
540 K.

630
00:44:00,947 --> 00:44:04,612
I say you go in at 20%% of 1 .9.

631
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,527
That's 380 K.

632
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:11,530
Meaning we finance
1 520 at seven and three-quarters,
and I can source that cheaper for you.

633
00:44:11,624 --> 00:44:16,036
That's, um, 1 0,880 a month.
That's a $ 1 ,200 difference.

634
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:18,833
- You can pass that on easy.
- I don't know.

635
00:44:19,965 --> 00:44:23,381
Are you, uh, waiting for me to offer
to kick in some commission?

636
00:44:23,468 --> 00:44:28,011
Well, this is an easy deal for you.
It's not like you had to knock around
for six months to find it.

637
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:30,885
Okay, one point.

638
00:44:33,395 --> 00:44:37,724
That's a cheque for 20 K at escrow.

639
00:44:37,816 --> 00:44:42,442
But that's it, you know, because he can
get 2.1 if he waits even two months.

640
00:44:42,529 --> 00:44:47,653
But, you know,
whatever you want to do, so--

641
00:44:47,742 --> 00:44:50,862
Well, thank you for your time.

642
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:56,374
All right, all right. Bring her
by my office, and, uh, I'll sign it.

643
00:44:56,459 --> 00:44:59,709
- Thank you. Yes, I will.
- Mm-hmm.

644
00:45:02,965 --> 00:45:06,299
Wow. How long you been doing this?

645
00:45:06,385 --> 00:45:11,177
Oh, my God. I don't even know
where the words came from.

646
00:45:11,265 --> 00:45:13,304
I did feel terrible
about lying though.

647
00:45:13,392 --> 00:45:16,179
Oh, you didn't lie.
You just didn't tell the whole truth.

648
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:20,054
Yeah, well, like I tell my kids
that that's called lying.

649
00:45:20,149 --> 00:45:24,478
My God. Norma is gonna die.

650
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,357
This is so out of my league.
I always got the feeling...

651
00:45:27,447 --> 00:45:32,572
that she gave me the job out of pity,
you know, my divorce and--

652
00:45:32,661 --> 00:45:34,653
Well, maybe this will
get you off strip mall patrol.

653
00:45:34,746 --> 00:45:37,118
God, wouldn't that be great?

654
00:45:39,209 --> 00:45:43,337
Um, so, why did he think
that we, uh, met in palm Springs?

655
00:45:43,421 --> 00:45:46,755
Is he mixing me up with
a girlfriend or something?

656
00:45:46,841 --> 00:45:48,964
Hmm. I don't know.

657
00:45:49,052 --> 00:45:52,136
I might have told him you were a friend
of a friend.Jim doesn't like realtors.

658
00:45:52,221 --> 00:45:56,800
I'm the salesman, you know? He doesn't
like salesmen. I like salesmen.

659
00:45:56,893 --> 00:45:59,514
Greg had a thing
against salesmen too.

660
00:45:59,604 --> 00:46:01,976
He wouldn't let Scott sell
chocolate bars for the school...

661
00:46:02,064 --> 00:46:04,816
'cause he didn't want
his kids selling anything.

662
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,474
I mean, he still doesn't.

663
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:10,143
And now I am. It's funny.

664
00:46:17,663 --> 00:46:20,830
Okay, so, um, do you just
want me to write this up here or--

665
00:46:20,916 --> 00:46:24,748
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Okay.

666
00:46:24,837 --> 00:46:27,624
Um, thank you. I owe you.

667
00:46:28,757 --> 00:46:31,628
Don't worry about it.

668
00:46:33,512 --> 00:46:36,003
- Take care.
- Okay.

669
00:46:49,486 --> 00:46:51,644
- Okay.
- No, those two racks stay there.

670
00:46:53,781 --> 00:46:55,774
Yeah, okay.

671
00:46:56,784 --> 00:46:59,869
Yeah, thanks.

672
00:47:02,582 --> 00:47:06,200
Well, we're gonna have trouble
from Legal on eight.

673
00:47:06,294 --> 00:47:09,294
You know what? Forget it.
Ship it. Let them tell us.

674
00:47:11,006 --> 00:47:14,790
- There you are.
- Go!
- Thanks.

675
00:47:14,885 --> 00:47:19,262
- Hey!
- Hey. What are you doin' here?

676
00:47:20,933 --> 00:47:26,058
Uh, well, I was just
in the area, I guess.

677
00:47:26,146 --> 00:47:28,222
Wow. It looks like
the move's on track.

678
00:47:28,315 --> 00:47:31,435
Yeah, yeah.
It's, uh, this weekend.

679
00:47:31,526 --> 00:47:36,023
- You need Jim?
- Um, no, I just, uh--

680
00:47:37,407 --> 00:47:40,990
- Um, I just wanted to--
- What?

681
00:47:41,077 --> 00:47:45,455
Well, I wanted to thank you.

682
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:50,001
I, uh-- Well, I got
two tickets for the Dodgers.

683
00:47:50,086 --> 00:47:53,669
I know you like them,
because I saw your coffee mug.

684
00:47:53,756 --> 00:47:55,915
They're for Friday.

685
00:47:56,009 --> 00:47:59,175
I thought we could, you know,
go or-- if you want...

686
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:01,385
or-or you could just have them.

687
00:48:01,472 --> 00:48:03,465
Both, if you're-- if you're--
if you're seeing some--

688
00:48:03,558 --> 00:48:05,550
I mean, if you have a friend
who likes them.

689
00:48:05,643 --> 00:48:10,519
Well, that's really nice.
I-- I-- I-- um-- Thank you.

690
00:48:10,606 --> 00:48:13,097
Oh, shit, Friday.

691
00:48:13,192 --> 00:48:15,517
I have, uh, a business dinner.

692
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:17,604
These clients are coming down
from San Francisco. Otherwise--

693
00:48:17,696 --> 00:48:19,736
No, that's been moved
to Monday, remember?

694
00:48:19,823 --> 00:48:22,860
- Is it?
- Mm-hmm, and it's a lunch.

695
00:48:24,953 --> 00:48:28,488
Well, great. The Dodgers.

696
00:48:33,795 --> 00:48:36,582
- Excuse me. I think this is my seat.
- Oh, hi.

697
00:48:36,673 --> 00:48:39,627
Um, somebody--
I think that's back there.

698
00:48:39,718 --> 00:48:43,762
- Someone's sitting here.
- I didn't hear you leave
- I'm sorry.

699
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,807
I wonder how am I still here

700
00:48:51,646 --> 00:48:56,308
And I don't want to move a thing

701
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:59,900
It might change my memory

702
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:06,700
Oh, I am what I am

703
00:49:06,786 --> 00:49:09,621
I'll do what I want

704
00:49:09,705 --> 00:49:14,497
But I can't hide

705
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:16,578
-And I won't go
- Hey.
- Hi.

706
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:19,161
- How ya doin'?
- I won't sleep
- pretty good, but I feel bad.

707
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,961
- I think I told you
to come way too early.
- No, this is great.

708
00:49:22,051 --> 00:49:26,629
I can't breathe
until you're resting here with me

709
00:49:26,722 --> 00:49:29,557
And I won't leave

710
00:49:29,641 --> 00:49:31,800
And I can't hide

711
00:49:31,894 --> 00:49:33,637
- I can't breathe
- Oh, come on! Come on, come on.

712
00:49:33,729 --> 00:49:35,139
Beat it out!
Beat it out! Beat it out!

713
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:37,686
- Until you're resting here
- He's out now.

714
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:41,274
With me

715
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,987
- You're still here, huh?
- Yeah.

716
00:49:50,078 --> 00:49:52,747
That was rude of me, I think.
I should have taken longer.

717
00:49:52,831 --> 00:49:55,500
Oh, I am what I am

718
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:58,668
I'll do what I want

719
00:49:58,753 --> 00:50:01,505
- But I
- Could I have the hamburger and fries?

720
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:03,748
Can't hide

721
00:50:03,841 --> 00:50:06,546
And I won't go

722
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:09,340
I won't sleep

723
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:12,466
And I can't breathe

724
00:50:12,558 --> 00:50:15,559
Until you're resting
here with me

725
00:50:15,644 --> 00:50:19,144
-And I won't leave
-Um, may I have the grilled cheese and--

726
00:50:19,231 --> 00:50:21,224
I can't hide

727
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:23,890
I cannot be

728
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:28,447
Until you're resting
here with me

729
00:50:28,532 --> 00:50:31,568
You know, I don't think
I've ever bought a woman
a grilled cheese sandwich before.

730
00:50:33,412 --> 00:50:35,404
Well, that's what my boys
always order, and after a while...

731
00:50:35,497 --> 00:50:37,537
you know, you kind of
get hooked on 'em.

732
00:50:37,624 --> 00:50:41,373
- There's probably some kind of gum
for that too, right?
- Oh, I am what I am

733
00:50:41,461 --> 00:50:44,213
I'll do what I want

734
00:50:44,297 --> 00:50:46,967
- You want to sit for a while?
- But I

735
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:50,170
- Can't hide
- Yeah. Sure.

736
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:01,146
- Is this your car?
- No.

737
00:51:01,231 --> 00:51:04,599
This is Greg's, my-- my ex.

738
00:51:07,653 --> 00:51:10,191
Mine's in the shop, so--

739
00:51:14,744 --> 00:51:17,116
Sittin' in cars at the diner.

740
00:51:19,081 --> 00:51:22,331
I never did that, did you?

741
00:51:22,418 --> 00:51:25,502
No. No diners.

742
00:51:25,588 --> 00:51:27,627
Bars.

743
00:51:32,761 --> 00:51:36,759
- I had a baby in a car.Joey.
- Really?

744
00:51:36,849 --> 00:51:41,760
I mean, not actually in the car.
We made it to the ER, but--

745
00:51:41,853 --> 00:51:45,222
Not this car.

746
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:49,479
It was a Datsun. Remember those?
I had it in school.

747
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:53,614
I was-- Well, Greg was driving...

748
00:51:53,698 --> 00:51:56,368
and I just knew
I was gonna have this baby...

749
00:51:56,451 --> 00:51:59,405
and he would not pull over.

750
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:01,572
So I got it in
my mind that, you know...

751
00:52:01,664 --> 00:52:03,657
I didn't wanna have the baby
in the front seat.

752
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,288
You know, like it wasn't safe.

753
00:52:06,377 --> 00:52:09,746
So I tried to climb in the back seat...

754
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:13,837
and I broke his nose with my foot.

755
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:18,173
I had this contraction, and, pow.
I just got him right there.

756
00:52:18,264 --> 00:52:22,724
And he could not drive.
I mean, the blood was pouring.

757
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:24,968
So I had to drive the rest
of the way to the hospital...

758
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:28,645
screaming and crying and driving.

759
00:52:32,111 --> 00:52:34,981
And he had a beautiful nose.

760
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:40,066
I mean, you know,
a good face, handsome, but...

761
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,698
a beautiful nose.

762
00:52:42,788 --> 00:52:45,824
That's all I could think about
the whole time I was delivering.

763
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:48,952
Oh, I ruined his nose.

764
00:52:53,048 --> 00:52:56,832
And later, you know, he didn't
even know he did this, but--

765
00:52:56,926 --> 00:53:00,378
When we'd have a fight, you know,
he'd kind of touch his nose like--

766
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:03,342
You know, like Danny Kaye
in-- in White Christmas with the arm.

767
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:05,425
Like, ''You owe me, pal.''

768
00:53:05,518 --> 00:53:09,516
Oh, God, it used to make me so mad.

769
00:53:13,651 --> 00:53:15,442
What?

770
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,947
I don't know how women
get so brave. That's all.

771
00:53:21,033 --> 00:53:24,865
You think that's brave?
I was so scared.

772
00:53:24,954 --> 00:53:27,824
God, I'm always so scared.

773
00:53:27,915 --> 00:53:30,785
It's not brave
if you're not scared.

774
00:53:37,925 --> 00:53:43,346
Well, you have a good face too.

775
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:26,378
Okay. Well, um, thank you.

776
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:32,674
- Thanks for the tickets.
- No problem.

777
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,898
- Good night.
- Good night.

778
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,656
Good night.

779
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,767
- What do you think?
- It's fine.

780
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:19,898
You get a window. I get to work
for a guy who gets a window.

781
00:55:19,982 --> 00:55:23,102
What are you doing in here already?
It's not even 8:00.

782
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,352
I'm early.

783
00:55:25,446 --> 00:55:28,067
How'd the date go with the realtor?

784
00:55:28,157 --> 00:55:31,407
- It was fine, I guess.
- Fine, huh?

785
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,530
I thought she was nice.
What happened?

786
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,910
What is this, Gay Confidant Day?

787
00:55:36,999 --> 00:55:39,241
You want me to hang on
while you go get a blow-dryer?

788
00:55:39,334 --> 00:55:42,917
Hey, I don't give a shit.
I'm just making conversation.

789
00:55:43,005 --> 00:55:46,338
Well, it went fine, you know.
I'm not interested, so, uh--

790
00:55:46,425 --> 00:55:49,876
If she calls, just, uh, tell her
I'm out or tell her I'm busy...

791
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:54,632
and take a message and tell her
I'll get back to her, okay?

792
00:55:54,724 --> 00:55:57,097
And if she calls back?

793
00:55:57,185 --> 00:56:00,221
Just keep taking messages.
She'll get the point.

794
00:56:00,313 --> 00:56:02,389
You know, that's what
I love about working for you.

795
00:56:02,482 --> 00:56:06,811
It's a total freedom from
hero worship. It's very refreshing.

796
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:11,023
Look, you're the client.
That's not what I'm saying.

797
00:56:11,115 --> 00:56:13,191
I'm just saying it's not in sync
with your brand positioning.

798
00:56:13,284 --> 00:56:15,526
It's Jim on three. Urgent.

799
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,862
Right. Okay.
Can I call you right back?

800
00:56:17,955 --> 00:56:20,625
All right. Thanks. What's up,Jim?

801
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:24,575
No, it's Abby.
It's Abby Janello. Hi.

802
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:28,419
Hey. Oh. I-- I just--
I thought you were somebody else.

803
00:56:28,507 --> 00:56:34,131
Um, how are ya? I, uh-- I had
a really good time the other night.

804
00:56:34,221 --> 00:56:38,883
Really? Um, listen,
I'm just across the street...

805
00:56:38,976 --> 00:56:41,383
and I've got all these extra sets
of keys for the doors and everything.

806
00:56:41,478 --> 00:56:45,262
I thought maybe I could, um,
you know, buy you and Jim a drink...

807
00:56:45,357 --> 00:56:48,062
to celebrate moving in.

808
00:56:48,151 --> 00:56:52,730
Jim's in a meeting,
uh, and I-- I don't drink.

809
00:56:54,408 --> 00:56:57,361
- Uh--
- Oh.

810
00:56:57,452 --> 00:57:00,536
Um, uh, uh, okay.
I can just, uh, mail them.

811
00:57:00,622 --> 00:57:03,492
How about ten minutes?

812
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:05,741
Okay. Great.

813
00:57:05,835 --> 00:57:07,828
I'll see you there.

814
00:57:12,926 --> 00:57:15,926
You know what, Seth?
That's not funny, okay?

815
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:17,755
You don't know what
you're messin' with.

816
00:57:35,754 --> 00:57:37,912
- Hey.
- Hey.

817
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:41,921
I ordered you a club soda.
Hope that's okay.

818
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,003
Yeah, that's fine.

819
00:57:48,558 --> 00:57:51,429
You know, my husband
didn't drink either.

820
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:53,512
Not even champagne at our wedding.

821
00:57:58,693 --> 00:58:00,982
I used to drink.
I just don't any more.

822
00:58:01,904 --> 00:58:04,193
Oh.

823
00:58:04,282 --> 00:58:07,448
- AA?
- Yeah, six months.

824
00:58:07,535 --> 00:58:09,574
Oh, well, that's great.

825
00:58:09,662 --> 00:58:12,995
I had an uncle
who was in AA...

826
00:58:13,082 --> 00:58:15,953
and he was, like,
a really bad drunk.

827
00:58:16,043 --> 00:58:17,787
So was I.

828
00:58:22,007 --> 00:58:24,379
I'm sorry. I--
I don't know why I said that.

829
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:28,718
The drinking wasn't the worst part.

830
00:58:31,642 --> 00:58:34,927
It was the thinking
I was such hot stuff.

831
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:37,772
I've always been
one of those people.

832
00:58:37,856 --> 00:58:40,429
Born salesman. A closer.

833
00:58:40,525 --> 00:58:43,396
- p eople person.
- Ew.

834
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:47,152
But I wasn't,
not by a long shot.

835
00:58:48,116 --> 00:58:51,319
It's like how everybody thinks that
they have a-a good sense of humour...

836
00:58:51,411 --> 00:58:53,238
or good taste...

837
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,618
or they're a good driver.

838
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:59,496
I'd be driving along
and I'd, uh...

839
00:58:59,586 --> 00:59:01,625
happen to look up
in the rearview mirror.

840
00:59:03,214 --> 00:59:05,966
And there'd be all these...

841
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:10,214
bloody people
and crashed cars in the street...

842
00:59:10,304 --> 00:59:14,883
and I'd think, ''Jesus, there's a lot
of bad drivers in this neighbourhood.''

843
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:20,013
That was me with people.

844
00:59:22,233 --> 00:59:24,225
I'd like to, uh--

845
00:59:26,278 --> 00:59:28,354
I'd like to tell you
that I've wised up...

846
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,648
but I don't know.

847
00:59:38,415 --> 00:59:40,408
Yeah.

848
00:59:42,002 --> 00:59:44,457
I get it.

849
00:59:44,546 --> 00:59:47,713
You're bad with relationships.

850
00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:50,006
And as a person who's standing...

851
00:59:50,093 --> 00:59:52,382
in the road ahead of you, thanks.

852
00:59:53,596 --> 00:59:55,922
I'll be, uh...

853
00:59:56,016 --> 00:59:59,266
getting on the sidewalk now.

854
00:59:59,352 --> 01:00:03,136
- Abby--
- No, you know, it's okay. I--

855
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:06,481
I took a shot, you know?
I think I misread stuff...

856
01:00:06,567 --> 01:00:09,058
and I'm sorry.

857
01:00:11,405 --> 01:00:14,940
I'm just really grateful to you for
throwing me the sale and everything.

858
01:00:16,452 --> 01:00:18,445
Bye.

859
01:00:23,626 --> 01:00:25,334
Abby. Abby.

860
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:30,038
- Abby, wait a second, all right?
- I am not divorced, Buddy.

861
01:00:30,132 --> 01:00:33,003
My husband died
a little over a year ago...

862
01:00:33,093 --> 01:00:35,169
and I am sorry that
I wasn't honest with you about it.

863
01:00:35,262 --> 01:00:37,504
But you know what?
It's too soon for me...

864
01:00:37,598 --> 01:00:40,717
and it is way too soon for my boys,
so just leave me alone.

865
01:00:40,809 --> 01:00:44,143
- I'm sorry.
- Everybody's sorry.

866
01:00:44,229 --> 01:00:46,435
And nobody's to blame except,
you know, sometimes I think...

867
01:00:46,523 --> 01:00:49,559
exactly the opposite is true.

868
01:00:49,651 --> 01:00:52,272
God. Do you have a cigarette?

869
01:00:52,362 --> 01:00:56,573
- No. Abby, I-I think--
- I'm sorry that I lied to you.

870
01:00:56,658 --> 01:00:58,650
But I like thinking
of me and Greg as divorced.

871
01:00:58,743 --> 01:01:01,578
Everybody's divorced.
Feels like a decision we made...

872
01:01:01,663 --> 01:01:05,707
instead of fate or bad luck
or chance.

873
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:07,950
- plane crash.
- Come on, please.

874
01:01:08,044 --> 01:01:10,416
Let's just go back inside
and start over, okay?

875
01:01:10,505 --> 01:01:14,123
Don't be nice to me.
Everybody is nice to widows.

876
01:01:14,217 --> 01:01:19,258
You were the first person in over a year
who was nice to me who didn't know.

877
01:01:19,347 --> 01:01:22,929
Listen, I was wrong in there.

878
01:01:23,017 --> 01:01:25,638
I just didn't want you to think
I was this great guy.

879
01:01:25,728 --> 01:01:28,183
I wanted to tell you
before you found out for yourself.

880
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:33,438
I got scared.

881
01:01:35,195 --> 01:01:37,437
What is it that you want, Buddy?

882
01:01:42,578 --> 01:01:46,160
Your company.
The pleasure of your company.

883
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:50,538
I want your input
on video rentals.

884
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:53,414
I stand there for hours,
and I can't pick anything out.

885
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:58,083
I want someone
to say good night to.

886
01:01:59,886 --> 01:02:04,762
A last call of the day.
I don't have a last call of the day.

887
01:02:04,849 --> 01:02:06,723
Do you?

888
01:02:06,809 --> 01:02:09,763
Don't feel sorry for me.

889
01:02:09,854 --> 01:02:12,345
I'm happy.

890
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,812
I'm widow happy.
I'm widow-with-two-kids happy.

891
01:02:14,901 --> 01:02:16,893
If you grade on a curve, I'm happy.

892
01:02:20,781 --> 01:02:23,107
I don't feel sorry for you.

893
01:02:24,827 --> 01:02:28,243
- Okay?
- Oh.

894
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:30,323
Well--

895
01:02:36,338 --> 01:02:38,580
Okay, then nothing
with knives, snakes...

896
01:02:38,674 --> 01:02:41,343
or women that have to go
undercover as hookers.

897
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:44,712
The videos.

898
01:02:46,181 --> 01:02:48,174
Okay.

899
01:02:55,857 --> 01:02:57,482
Don't worry. I don't think
he's bored, do you?

900
01:02:57,567 --> 01:03:00,770
Honey, it's a cookout.
Of course he's bored. Aren't you?

901
01:03:00,862 --> 01:03:03,068
So how far has it gone?

902
01:03:03,156 --> 01:03:05,991
Nowhere. You know, he's nice.
It's not-not a big deal.

903
01:03:06,075 --> 01:03:07,700
Mm-hmm.

904
01:03:07,785 --> 01:03:10,074
It's just that, um...

905
01:03:10,163 --> 01:03:13,164
you know when you go to a table and
a guy does that, like, halfway thing...

906
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:14,909
like he's gonna stand up?

907
01:03:15,001 --> 01:03:16,993
He does that.
I love it when guys do that.

908
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:29,881
Mom? Mom, can I be excused?

909
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:32,180
Yes, you may be excused.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

910
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:34,675
CD-Rom, not AOL, okay?
It costs money.

911
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:37,439
Hey, do you have, uh, ¨¨Where's Waldo¨¨?

912
01:03:37,523 --> 01:03:39,729
I'm eight, okay?

913
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:43,900
- Come on,Joey.
- Mama?
- It's okay.

914
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:46,609
You can take that in.Just don't put
the-- don't put the drink on the desk.

915
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:49,272
- Okay.
- I knew I shouldn't have
brought up Waldo.

916
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:52,986
Well, he is eight.
I mean--

917
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:56,164
- Hey, here, let me help you with that.
- Oh, no, no, no.
I'm gonna do it later.

918
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,513
And you're ready for take-off.

919
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:24,026
Hey, Scott.
What are you doing?

920
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:27,394
- Losing.
- pull up! pull up!

921
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,439
Yeah? Is it hard?

922
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:34,107
I'm done.
You can play.

923
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,163
And you're ready for take-off.

924
01:04:47,257 --> 01:04:50,342
We're losing altitude.
pull up! pull up!

925
01:04:52,804 --> 01:04:55,722
Sorry.

926
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,014
He's still, uh, very angry.

927
01:04:58,101 --> 01:05:00,426
- Thanks. It's okay.
- He's angry at me.

928
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,854
He's angry at Greg.
He's angry at Joey.

929
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:06,099
This is great.

930
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:11,523
And he's scared to fly.

931
01:05:11,614 --> 01:05:14,152
You know, I was thinking of maybe
taking them on a little flying trip...

932
01:05:14,242 --> 01:05:17,741
somewhere close so that
if they can't make it,
I can rent a car and drive back.

933
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:20,533
That sounds good.
It could work.

934
01:05:25,336 --> 01:05:27,329
That's a nice computer.

935
01:05:30,341 --> 01:05:32,333
Yeah.

936
01:05:33,469 --> 01:05:35,876
Greg got it to, uh,
celebrate his play.

937
01:05:35,971 --> 01:05:39,423
He had this play on in Chicago.
That's why he was there.

938
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:42,886
¨¨Lilacs in the dooryard. ¨¨

939
01:05:42,978 --> 01:05:45,184
Not the title I voted for.

940
01:05:46,815 --> 01:05:51,109
I mean, who knows what a dooryard is
anyway? It's weird.

941
01:05:59,161 --> 01:06:02,280
He wasn't even supposed
to be on that flight.

942
01:06:02,372 --> 01:06:04,828
Even the paperwork was all wrong,
you know?

943
01:06:04,916 --> 01:06:09,293
Which really made me crazy,
because it got me thinking...

944
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:11,371
like, if I was, you know,
getting the boys ready...

945
01:06:11,464 --> 01:06:13,587
to put them on the bus,
and Donna would say...

946
01:06:13,675 --> 01:06:16,000
''Oh, I'm going down there, you know.
I'll just take them.''

947
01:06:16,094 --> 01:06:18,086
And I would think...

948
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:21,470
''Well, which one's supposed to crash?''

949
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:25,340
You know? I mean, do I send them
with Donna or do I put them on a bus?

950
01:06:25,436 --> 01:06:27,808
Which one is doomed?

951
01:06:27,897 --> 01:06:30,020
Or is the whole thing
gonna happen tomorrow?

952
01:06:30,107 --> 01:06:32,100
It's crazy.

953
01:06:39,241 --> 01:06:40,617
Abby--

954
01:06:43,245 --> 01:06:45,238
What?

955
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:51,830
Do you have a good lawyer...

956
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,542
for your case against the airline?

957
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:56,624
Uh, I don't really know.

958
01:06:56,717 --> 01:07:00,299
I think so. You know, I'm just sort of
in with the group of other families.

959
01:07:00,387 --> 01:07:03,304
I have his card right there
if you want to see it.

960
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:06,225
I've got a meeting
with him on Thursday.

961
01:07:06,309 --> 01:07:08,765
Yeah. Well...

962
01:07:08,853 --> 01:07:10,846
what I can do, if you like...

963
01:07:10,939 --> 01:07:14,521
is have our lawyers call around,
ask some questions about him.

964
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:16,767
For free.

965
01:07:16,861 --> 01:07:19,317
Oh, I see. You, uh--
You're after my money now.

966
01:07:19,405 --> 01:07:22,905
- Is that it?
- Yeah. Well, not just the money.

967
01:07:22,992 --> 01:07:24,985
What the money can buy.

968
01:07:45,723 --> 01:07:47,715
Hey, Scott.

969
01:07:49,726 --> 01:07:52,478
- Uh, thank you very much.
- Yeah, thanks. Thanks for coming by.

970
01:07:52,563 --> 01:07:54,555
- It was great to see you.
- I'll let myself out.
- Okay.

971
01:07:54,648 --> 01:07:56,641
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

972
01:07:58,443 --> 01:08:00,436
See you, pal.

973
01:08:20,089 --> 01:08:22,082
Okay, coming.

974
01:08:28,514 --> 01:08:31,052
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm sorry. I just--

975
01:08:31,142 --> 01:08:33,134
I didn't know where to go,
and Donna has the kids.

976
01:08:33,227 --> 01:08:35,683
That's-- That's fine. I'm glad I was--
I was here when you called.

977
01:08:35,771 --> 01:08:39,816
Come on in. Do you want, uh,
some dinner or a drink or, uh--

978
01:08:40,943 --> 01:08:42,936
Here, sit down.

979
01:08:50,077 --> 01:08:51,737
I settled.

980
01:08:51,829 --> 01:08:54,154
I saw my lawyer today,
and I settled.

981
01:08:58,293 --> 01:09:00,962
Okay.

982
01:09:01,046 --> 01:09:03,038
It's not okay.

983
01:09:08,345 --> 01:09:11,595
It's like saying, you know,
I'm fine. I'm over it.

984
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:15,133
That's what everybody
wants me to feel anyway...

985
01:09:15,226 --> 01:09:18,642
even Donna,
who's been so good.

986
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:20,722
Or my mother.

987
01:09:21,941 --> 01:09:25,986
''Only a plane crash, sweetie.
You gotta bounce.''

988
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:28,063
That was her take on it.

989
01:09:29,657 --> 01:09:32,860
So that's what I've been doing--
bouncing.

990
01:09:32,952 --> 01:09:36,570
It's just like crashing, except
you get to do it over and over again.

991
01:09:37,415 --> 01:09:39,822
Yeah, I know what you mean.

992
01:09:39,917 --> 01:09:43,251
I mean, I can imagine
how that might feel.

993
01:09:45,506 --> 01:09:47,582
It's the way they talk about him...

994
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:51,502
like he's this saint.

995
01:09:53,472 --> 01:09:56,639
And I don't even recognize
who they're talking about any more.

996
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,107
It's not that he wasn't
a really good man, you know?

997
01:10:13,283 --> 01:10:15,572
He was.
He was a really good man.

998
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:20,072
But he wasn't perfect.

999
01:10:21,916 --> 01:10:24,787
He was a little tight with money,
for one thing.

1000
01:10:29,006 --> 01:10:30,999
I want to blame him...

1001
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:37,303
or to be angry at him
or whatever because...

1002
01:10:40,685 --> 01:10:42,677
when I don't...

1003
01:10:44,605 --> 01:10:46,598
he gets really far away.

1004
01:10:49,777 --> 01:10:51,769
God.

1005
01:10:52,905 --> 01:10:55,941
And I did love him, you know?
I really did love him.

1006
01:12:16,194 --> 01:12:19,528
You sure you don't want me to drive
you home? At least follow you?

1007
01:12:19,614 --> 01:12:21,607
No, I'm fine.

1008
01:12:24,369 --> 01:12:26,907
Listen, I know what you're thinking.

1009
01:12:26,996 --> 01:12:28,989
I'm this widow and
I've got these two kids...

1010
01:12:29,082 --> 01:12:31,370
and I'm probably not ready.

1011
01:12:31,459 --> 01:12:34,128
At least, that's what I think
to myself half the time.

1012
01:12:35,338 --> 01:12:38,292
So--

1013
01:12:38,382 --> 01:12:41,502
You're off the hook, okay?
You don't have to say another word.

1014
01:12:47,516 --> 01:12:49,509
Can I see you this weekend?

1015
01:12:51,395 --> 01:12:54,230
No.

1016
01:12:54,315 --> 01:12:57,102
No, this weekend is our little
test trip down to palm Springs.

1017
01:12:57,192 --> 01:12:59,066
Oh, right.

1018
01:12:59,153 --> 01:13:03,399
We had to drive to the funeral,
because Scott wouldn't get on the plane.

1019
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:08,117
And I really don't want my kids to spend
the rest of their lives afraid to fly.

1020
01:13:08,203 --> 01:13:10,872
- But Monday, maybe.
- Yeah.

1021
01:13:10,956 --> 01:13:13,494
Or I could come with you guys.

1022
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:15,742
Uh-- I wouldn't mention Waldo.

1023
01:13:18,004 --> 01:13:20,127
I did promise them the water park.

1024
01:13:20,215 --> 01:13:22,503
What, they're afraid
of water now too?

1025
01:13:22,592 --> 01:13:26,341
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- Okay.

1026
01:13:26,429 --> 01:13:28,552
It's a--
It's a big plane, right?

1027
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,632
I think so.

1028
01:13:31,935 --> 01:13:34,425
'Cause those would be better
for the kids.

1029
01:13:48,993 --> 01:13:50,985
The captain let you
go up there and everything.

1030
01:13:51,078 --> 01:13:52,952
Whatever.

1031
01:13:53,038 --> 01:13:55,197
That was all right, huh, guys?

1032
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:57,330
- There was a few bumps,
but I was, you know--
- Sir...

1033
01:13:57,418 --> 01:14:00,205
- fine, right?
- do we need to discuss
a little attitude adjustment...

1034
01:14:00,295 --> 01:14:02,288
- before we get to the water park?
- Get on.

1035
01:14:02,381 --> 01:14:04,373
- Come on.
- What do you think?

1036
01:14:04,466 --> 01:14:07,716
Though you may not drive

1037
01:14:08,804 --> 01:14:10,843
A great big Cadillac

1038
01:14:10,931 --> 01:14:14,763
Here, let me test this out
for you, because I'm worried
that maybe it's not--

1039
01:14:14,851 --> 01:14:19,809
- You may not have
- Yeah, it's good.

1040
01:14:19,898 --> 01:14:22,056
- I don't know.
- A car at all
- What do you think?

1041
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:24,439
- Can you handle it? Hey!
- Got it!

1042
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:27,612
- You got it. Very nice.
- Yes!
- But just remember

1043
01:14:27,697 --> 01:14:30,698
Forget it. We don't wanna go
on this dumb ride anyway.

1044
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:33,571
- We want snow cones down at--
down at the bottom.
- Hey, hold on.

1045
01:14:33,661 --> 01:14:35,903
Abby? Abby? Abby?

1046
01:14:35,997 --> 01:14:38,239
Just be thankful

1047
01:14:38,332 --> 01:14:40,906
Can you teach me how to--
how to dive, Mom?

1048
01:14:45,131 --> 01:14:47,170
I'm scared! I'm scared!

1049
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:55,381
That was fun!
That was a good one!

1050
01:15:01,355 --> 01:15:03,394
Hey, Mom!
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom!

1051
01:15:04,775 --> 01:15:06,898
All right. No, no.
Let me go now. Let me go.

1052
01:15:06,985 --> 01:15:12,490
You may not have

1053
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:15,065
A car at home

1054
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:19,869
-Just be thankful
- driving to the bank

1055
01:15:19,956 --> 01:15:23,123
Sunroof top
digging the scene with gasoline

1056
01:15:23,209 --> 01:15:26,246
For what you've got
Ooh, ooh

1057
01:15:40,977 --> 01:15:43,432
- Hey, boys.
- Yeah?

1058
01:15:43,521 --> 01:15:45,763
- You ready?
- Yep. Where is it, Scott?

1059
01:15:45,856 --> 01:15:48,692
- Oh, yeah. It's right down here.
- I wanna do it.

1060
01:15:48,776 --> 01:15:51,184
- Okay.
- Okay, close your eyes and pick one.

1061
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:54,687
- What is this?
- Oh, come on.Just do it.
We'll tell you later.

1062
01:16:00,746 --> 01:16:02,822
You can open your eyes now.

1063
01:16:02,915 --> 01:16:06,081
Okay, now read it. We couldn't decide
on a name, so it's up to you.

1064
01:16:06,168 --> 01:16:08,374
- Uh, ¨¨Darth.¨¨
- Yes!

1065
01:16:08,462 --> 01:16:12,791
- That was mine. That was mine.
- It was my second choice, okay?

1066
01:16:12,883 --> 01:16:15,718
The boys don't think you should have
the same name as the dog.

1067
01:16:24,269 --> 01:16:26,475
That's good, because, uh,
that's a good name for him.

1068
01:16:26,563 --> 01:16:30,311
Darth-- because the dog's black
and he-he kind of looks like Vader.

1069
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,439
No, that's your new name.

1070
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:38,989
Hey, seat belts, please.

1071
01:16:41,911 --> 01:16:44,402
What are you, uh, doing tomorrow?

1072
01:16:46,123 --> 01:16:48,116
You tell me.

1073
01:16:50,711 --> 01:16:54,376
There's just something
that I wanted to, uh, tell you...

1074
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,088
which is sort of hard to say...

1075
01:16:58,177 --> 01:17:00,964
so I wanted to just tell you now
that I was gonna tell you...

1076
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:04,554
so that-- so that, uh, you know,
tomorrow you'd hold me to it.

1077
01:17:07,227 --> 01:17:09,897
You know, it's probably nothing.
It's not a, you know--

1078
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,973
- It's just something I wanna tell you.
- Then tell me now.

1079
01:17:13,358 --> 01:17:15,434
No, I'll tell you tomorrow.
It's, you know--

1080
01:17:15,527 --> 01:17:18,065
I mean, uh, you just gotta
make me tell you.

1081
01:17:18,155 --> 01:17:20,990
Oh, great. Well,
this'll be a fun 24 hours.

1082
01:17:21,074 --> 01:17:24,360
It's nothing. Relax.
It's fine, you know.

1083
01:17:27,497 --> 01:17:30,166
All right.
Well, whatever it is...

1084
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:33,120
thank you for today.

1085
01:17:33,211 --> 01:17:35,204
It was the least I could do.

1086
01:17:50,686 --> 01:17:52,679
Can I help you?

1087
01:17:55,816 --> 01:17:59,399
- Hi.
- Hi.

1088
01:17:59,487 --> 01:18:02,156
Are you--
Are you Mrs Janello?

1089
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,232
Yes.

1090
01:18:06,201 --> 01:18:08,953
Now that I'm here,
I wish I'd just mailed this.

1091
01:18:09,037 --> 01:18:11,659
Hi, I'm Mimi prager.

1092
01:18:11,748 --> 01:18:13,741
Hello.

1093
01:18:15,544 --> 01:18:17,536
Here.

1094
01:18:28,932 --> 01:18:31,221
Would you like to come in?

1095
01:18:31,309 --> 01:18:33,551
And I hadn't looked at it
since then...

1096
01:18:33,645 --> 01:18:36,930
but I, uh, I was looking up
this speech I'd given...

1097
01:18:37,023 --> 01:18:39,479
and there it was.

1098
01:18:39,567 --> 01:18:41,726
I remembered the review for his play
was in the Chicago papers...

1099
01:18:41,819 --> 01:18:44,489
so I checked their archives
and, uh--

1100
01:18:44,572 --> 01:18:46,612
Well.

1101
01:18:48,367 --> 01:18:50,574
You probably don't even wanna see it.
You know, I just-- I thought...

1102
01:18:50,661 --> 01:18:53,496
- since I had this business trip, and--
- Thank you.

1103
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:57,826
I'm sorry.

1104
01:19:00,087 --> 01:19:01,831
He seemed like a very nice man.

1105
01:19:07,261 --> 01:19:09,419
Oh! Uncultured creatures!

1106
01:19:11,932 --> 01:19:14,601
- I hate it when she does that.
- Hey,Joey, Scott.

1107
01:19:14,685 --> 01:19:17,010
Hi, Mr Amaral.

1108
01:19:17,104 --> 01:19:19,429
What's going on? Shh.

1109
01:19:19,523 --> 01:19:21,848
- Where's your mom?
- She's in the bathroom.

1110
01:19:21,942 --> 01:19:24,018
She's been in since Rosie.

1111
01:19:24,111 --> 01:19:26,648
- Boy. Who was on Rosie?
- I don't know.

1112
01:19:30,492 --> 01:19:32,650
Abby?

1113
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:41,830
Abby?

1114
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,335
- You all right?
- I'll be out in a minute.

1115
01:19:45,423 --> 01:19:47,416
Okay.

1116
01:19:52,096 --> 01:19:54,254
- Let go!
- Give me that!

1117
01:19:54,348 --> 01:19:56,341
Guys. Hey, Scott. Hey.

1118
01:19:56,434 --> 01:20:00,182
Hey, stop.Joey, Scott.Joey, Scott,
your mom's trying to relax, okay?

1119
01:20:00,271 --> 01:20:02,477
Okay? Relax. Watch TV.
What do you wanna watch?

1120
01:20:02,565 --> 01:20:06,099
- I wanna watch my video.
- All right, great.

1121
01:20:06,193 --> 01:20:08,269
Scott. Scott!

1122
01:20:08,362 --> 01:20:11,398
Scott, stop it.
Scott, don't hit your brother, okay?

1123
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:13,613
- He bit me.
- Well, he's younger than you.

1124
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:16,370
Joey.Joey, apologize, all right?

1125
01:20:16,453 --> 01:20:18,659
Say you're sorry. Can you do that?
Can you do that for me?

1126
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:23,041
- Say you're sorry.
- That's Dad!
- We are here to celebrate...

1127
01:20:23,126 --> 01:20:25,534
the opening and the closing, sadly...

1128
01:20:25,629 --> 01:20:29,496
of the-- the new play
Lilacs Something On Your Dooryard.

1129
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,714
- That's you.
- We're here with
the author tonight, uh--

1130
01:20:31,801 --> 01:20:33,960
- Greg.
- Greg--
-Janello.

1131
01:20:34,054 --> 01:20:37,220
-And I would like to say, for one
thing, that the critic for the Chicago--
- That's G-A--J-A, not G-I-A.

1132
01:20:37,307 --> 01:20:39,762
Hey, that's my dad!
I wanna see that!

1133
01:20:39,851 --> 01:20:42,638
You knew him?
When was that taken?

1134
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:46,764
- Uh--
- Boys.

1135
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:51,312
- Go to your room until I call you.
- But that was Dad.

1136
01:20:51,404 --> 01:20:53,646
Scott, please.

1137
01:21:01,747 --> 01:21:05,448
- Who gave this to you?
- Mimi.

1138
01:21:05,543 --> 01:21:08,330
Mimi prager. Remember her?

1139
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:12,038
Abby-- Abby, I said
I was gonna tell you something.

1140
01:21:12,132 --> 01:21:14,967
Remember I said I had something to tell
you? That's what I was gonna tell you.

1141
01:21:15,052 --> 01:21:19,464
That's a lie. Another lie.

1142
01:21:19,556 --> 01:21:23,601
He took my place,
and I felt responsible.

1143
01:21:23,685 --> 01:21:27,730
And I wanted to make sure
you were okay-- you and your kids.

1144
01:21:27,814 --> 01:21:30,103
Who the hell do you think you are?

1145
01:21:30,192 --> 01:21:32,979
God? Some goddam angel...

1146
01:21:33,069 --> 01:21:35,560
come to make sure
the victims are alive and well?

1147
01:21:35,655 --> 01:21:37,980
You lied to me.

1148
01:21:38,074 --> 01:21:40,565
I mean, I never expected
to fall in love with you.

1149
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:43,412
God, you're a liar.

1150
01:21:43,496 --> 01:21:45,738
No. You know that's true.

1151
01:21:45,832 --> 01:21:47,824
I want you...

1152
01:21:47,917 --> 01:21:50,538
out of this house.

1153
01:21:50,628 --> 01:21:53,795
I don't want to see you again.

1154
01:21:53,881 --> 01:21:56,004
I don't want you to call.

1155
01:21:56,092 --> 01:21:58,843
I don't want to hear your voice
on my machine.

1156
01:21:58,928 --> 01:22:02,842
- Look, you have to let me explain.
- You son of a bitch.

1157
01:22:02,932 --> 01:22:06,217
You lied to me. Get out!

1158
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:08,931
What's wrong, Mom?

1159
01:22:10,773 --> 01:22:14,473
Do you want me to say what you did
in front of them?

1160
01:22:14,568 --> 01:22:18,779
Because I will do almost anything
to get you out of here.

1161
01:22:18,864 --> 01:22:21,153
You better go, Mr Amaral.

1162
01:22:24,661 --> 01:22:26,654
Yeah, I think so too, Scott.

1163
01:22:26,747 --> 01:22:28,739
I think you're right.

1164
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:32,033
I'm gonna go.

1165
01:22:32,127 --> 01:22:35,626
- I'll call you.
-Joey, come out here.

1166
01:22:37,757 --> 01:22:40,379
I want you to say goodbye to them.

1167
01:22:40,468 --> 01:22:44,418
I don't want another guy
just disappearing from their lives.

1168
01:22:45,306 --> 01:22:47,050
Abby, please.

1169
01:22:50,144 --> 01:22:52,896
Mr Amaral won't be
coming around any more.

1170
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:55,103
Abby--

1171
01:22:55,191 --> 01:23:00,149
You can leave,
or you can say goodbye and leave.

1172
01:23:15,461 --> 01:23:20,169
Uh, I gotta go away for a while.

1173
01:23:20,257 --> 01:23:23,673
- Why?
- Because I, uh...

1174
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,919
I kept a secret from your mom.

1175
01:23:26,013 --> 01:23:28,717
You're not supposed
to tell a secret.

1176
01:23:31,017 --> 01:23:33,390
Well, then it wasn't a secret.

1177
01:23:33,478 --> 01:23:37,523
It was just--
I just didn't want to tell her.

1178
01:23:37,607 --> 01:23:40,893
Why can't you say you're sorry?

1179
01:23:40,986 --> 01:23:43,227
I am sorry.

1180
01:23:44,697 --> 01:23:48,066
Don't worry about it,Joey.
All right? Come on.

1181
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:50,199
Come on.

1182
01:23:57,335 --> 01:24:00,205
Okay, you have to let me call you.

1183
01:24:00,296 --> 01:24:02,419
Get out...

1184
01:24:02,506 --> 01:24:04,748
before I tell them who you are.

1185
01:24:25,821 --> 01:24:28,526
Hi. You've called theJanello house.

1186
01:24:28,615 --> 01:24:30,774
You can leave a--
please leave us a message.

1187
01:24:30,867 --> 01:24:32,860
Thanks. Bye.

1188
01:24:44,547 --> 01:24:47,121
Hey, Scott.

1189
01:24:47,217 --> 01:24:49,209
Uh, she's not home...

1190
01:24:49,302 --> 01:24:52,920
and even if she was--

1191
01:24:53,014 --> 01:24:55,421
She doesn't wanna see me.

1192
01:24:55,516 --> 01:24:57,509
Nope.

1193
01:24:59,061 --> 01:25:02,181
You know, Scott, I'd understand it
if you were pretty mad at me too.

1194
01:25:03,983 --> 01:25:05,976
It's okay.

1195
01:25:11,615 --> 01:25:13,608
All right, pal, I'll see you.

1196
01:25:15,411 --> 01:25:18,328
Did he say anything
about Christmas trees?

1197
01:25:18,414 --> 01:25:21,996
- What?
- My dad.

1198
01:25:22,084 --> 01:25:25,500
He was supposed to sell Christmas trees
with me the next day, and...

1199
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:27,580
maybe that was why
he got back on the plane.

1200
01:25:27,673 --> 01:25:31,457
And he did and it crashed, so...

1201
01:25:31,551 --> 01:25:33,793
I was just wondering
if he said anything about that.

1202
01:25:45,648 --> 01:25:47,641
Well--

1203
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:55,733
Nah, he didn't mention that to me.

1204
01:25:55,825 --> 01:25:58,197
Yeah, he just said, you know, he--

1205
01:25:58,286 --> 01:26:00,611
He said he just wanted to get home.
Everybody at the airport...

1206
01:26:00,705 --> 01:26:04,156
kind of just wants to get home,
that's all.

1207
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:08,912
Yeah, because he didn't need
to sell those trees with me.

1208
01:26:09,005 --> 01:26:12,208
I didn't even want to.

1209
01:26:12,299 --> 01:26:14,625
Everyone has fake ones anyway.

1210
01:26:18,931 --> 01:26:21,552
Yeah, no, he just-- he just--
He said he wanted to get home to work.

1211
01:26:21,642 --> 01:26:25,686
I remember him saying something about
work, but, uh, nothing about any trees.

1212
01:26:25,771 --> 01:26:27,763
I'm sure of that.

1213
01:26:29,691 --> 01:26:31,684
Do you think I should tell my mom?

1214
01:26:33,362 --> 01:26:35,935
Because maybe she thinks...

1215
01:26:36,031 --> 01:26:39,731
it's because she yelled at him
over the tree thing.

1216
01:26:39,826 --> 01:26:42,400
You know, Scott,
I don't think, uh...

1217
01:26:42,495 --> 01:26:45,699
your mom will believe me.

1218
01:26:45,790 --> 01:26:48,910
But you believe me, right?

1219
01:26:49,002 --> 01:26:50,994
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1220
01:26:51,087 --> 01:26:53,080
That's good.

1221
01:27:02,682 --> 01:27:04,473
Could you help me with these?

1222
01:27:04,559 --> 01:27:07,132
Donna, he should've told me.

1223
01:27:07,228 --> 01:27:11,178
Of course.
Lying like that is terrible.

1224
01:27:11,273 --> 01:27:14,025
It's like telling people
you're divorced when you're not...

1225
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:16,232
or that you found a property
for your biggest client on your own...

1226
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,313
without help.

1227
01:27:20,074 --> 01:27:23,193
Look, he just wanted to see
if you guys were okay.

1228
01:27:23,285 --> 01:27:26,156
Yes, but then he should've
left us alone.

1229
01:27:26,246 --> 01:27:28,618
Yeah, I keep forgetting.
Who bought who the Dodger tickets?

1230
01:27:30,918 --> 01:27:33,872
Look, guys screw up.
That's what they do.

1231
01:27:33,962 --> 01:27:38,209
It's in their manual, right after
''Love your grill, leave socks on floor.''

1232
01:27:43,763 --> 01:27:47,631
But if you can't forgive him,
you can't.

1233
01:27:47,726 --> 01:27:49,802
It's not that I can't forgive him.

1234
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,018
Do you know how I spent the night
after he left?

1235
01:27:56,943 --> 01:27:59,648
Trying to figure out if I was glad...

1236
01:27:59,737 --> 01:28:01,860
that he didn't get on that plane.

1237
01:28:04,367 --> 01:28:07,368
If I say I'm glad he's alive,
I'm glad he found me that day...

1238
01:28:07,453 --> 01:28:10,158
or if I lie and I say I'm not,
either way it feels like...

1239
01:28:10,248 --> 01:28:13,616
I'm doing something wrong
to someone I--

1240
01:28:13,709 --> 01:28:15,951
to both of them--
to him and Greg.

1241
01:28:16,045 --> 01:28:18,334
Being with him is like
making a choice.

1242
01:28:18,422 --> 01:28:20,628
You don't have that choice, Abby.

1243
01:28:23,052 --> 01:28:25,756
You have other choices.

1244
01:28:28,307 --> 01:28:30,299
It just can't be him, that's all.

1245
01:28:31,727 --> 01:28:34,348
Okay, then, fine.
But whether it's Buddy...

1246
01:28:34,438 --> 01:28:37,273
or someone else a year from now...

1247
01:28:37,357 --> 01:28:40,311
whoever you choose will be there
because Greg isn't.

1248
01:28:42,195 --> 01:28:44,188
That's just how it is.

1249
01:28:51,996 --> 01:28:55,662
Hey,Jim.
Seth said you wanted to see me.

1250
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:58,751
How's it going, Frank? What's up?
Are we being sued or something?

1251
01:28:58,836 --> 01:29:01,754
Infinity Airlines,
according to its marketing Vp...

1252
01:29:01,839 --> 01:29:05,422
is deciding today whether our services
will be required in the future.

1253
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:07,170
What? Why?

1254
01:29:07,261 --> 01:29:09,799
Apparently, they received,
uh, some information...

1255
01:29:09,889 --> 01:29:13,258
that you coerced an Infinity employee
to illegally...

1256
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:15,888
board a passenger
under your name onto Flight 82.

1257
01:29:15,978 --> 01:29:18,599
Yeah. I mean, we dealt with this
a year ago after the crash.

1258
01:29:18,689 --> 01:29:20,765
It was a computer problem
or something.

1259
01:29:20,858 --> 01:29:23,349
They have a correct version
of the roster in their system.

1260
01:29:23,444 --> 01:29:27,026
Yes, they do.
Uh, you know a Janice Guerrero?

1261
01:29:28,657 --> 01:29:31,611
She was fired six weeks after
the accident for altering the roster--

1262
01:29:31,702 --> 01:29:35,746
removing your name, in fact,
and adding the name of a Greg--

1263
01:29:35,831 --> 01:29:37,870
What does this have to do with
our-- our situation with Infinity?

1264
01:29:37,958 --> 01:29:41,208
The suit is being brought against
Infinity by the victims' families.

1265
01:29:41,294 --> 01:29:45,078
They wanna prove that the airline didn't
follow procedures, even technicalities.

1266
01:29:45,173 --> 01:29:48,507
So Infinity wants to make sure
that if you get called to testify...

1267
01:29:48,593 --> 01:29:50,669
that you tell the court
what you told us today--

1268
01:29:50,762 --> 01:29:55,388
that you did not persuade this
gate attendant to board someone else.

1269
01:29:55,475 --> 01:29:57,930
- Is this woman gonna testify?
- Maybe.

1270
01:29:58,019 --> 01:30:01,803
But she's not the most credible witness.
She's a bitter ex-employee, ax to grind.

1271
01:30:01,898 --> 01:30:04,104
Infinity's position is that
the roster screwup...

1272
01:30:04,192 --> 01:30:07,062
is a harmless computer glitch,
it's no big deal.

1273
01:30:07,153 --> 01:30:09,644
They just wanna know
if you have a problem with that.

1274
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:24,327
Mr Amaral?

1275
01:30:30,801 --> 01:30:35,214
If you're just joining us, it is day 7
of the civil trial against Infinity.

1276
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:38,840
And believe me, tensions which have been
running high since this trial began...

1277
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:41,935
are likely to reach
their peak today.

1278
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:45,638
The plaintiffs in this case are
the survivors of three passengers--

1279
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:49,516
two of whom, ironically, were seated
just across the aisle from each other...

1280
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:51,189
in seats 1 8--

1281
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:53,236
And here comes today's
principal witness.

1282
01:30:53,323 --> 01:30:55,399
Her testimony
about the flagrant disregard...

1283
01:30:55,492 --> 01:30:57,947
for safety procedures
was extremely damaging.

1284
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:00,527
We're gonna move over and just see
if we can get a word with her.

1285
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:04,915
Uh, Miss Guerrero?
Miss Guerrero, we're live here.

1286
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:07,207
Do you feel that
your testimony was--

1287
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,334
Quick question.
Miss Guerrero?

1288
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:20,884
please, please. No comment.
Thank you very much.

1289
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:24,059
Hey, I'm gonna go get the kids.
You wanna come along?
We'll grab some dinner.

1290
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:26,718
No, no, I'm okay.
I'm fine, thanks.

1291
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:28,806
Okay. I'll be back.

1292
01:31:34,488 --> 01:31:36,231
- Mr Amaral.
- Yes.

1293
01:31:36,323 --> 01:31:39,822
You were scheduled to be a passenger
on Flight 82, were you not?

1294
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:42,483
Yes, that's right.

1295
01:31:42,579 --> 01:31:44,572
In fact, when the plane went down,
your name was on...

1296
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:47,416
the first list of passengers,
was it not?

1297
01:31:47,501 --> 01:31:49,493
Uh, that is correct.

1298
01:31:49,586 --> 01:31:54,047
But instead, a Mr Greg Janello
was in your seat, isn't that correct?

1299
01:31:54,132 --> 01:31:56,801
- I believe so, yes.
- You believe so?

1300
01:31:58,011 --> 01:32:00,003
Uh--

1301
01:32:01,264 --> 01:32:03,257
Yes, he was in my seat.

1302
01:32:04,601 --> 01:32:09,512
Do you know how Mr Janello happened
to be on that plane occupying your seat?

1303
01:32:09,605 --> 01:32:12,227
- No, I don't know.
- Excuse me?

1304
01:32:13,693 --> 01:32:17,109
I'm-I'm-I'm just very confused about a
lot of things that happened that night.

1305
01:32:17,196 --> 01:32:19,485
- I don't--
- Well, you're not confused...

1306
01:32:19,573 --> 01:32:22,029
about having just taken an oath
to tell the truth, are you?

1307
01:32:22,118 --> 01:32:26,162
- Objection, Your Honour.
- I'll rephrase, Your Honour.

1308
01:32:26,247 --> 01:32:31,870
Mr Amaral, did you have a conversation
that night with Mr Janello?

1309
01:32:31,961 --> 01:32:36,622
Mr Mandel, I had a lot
of conversations with a lot of people.

1310
01:32:36,715 --> 01:32:39,123
You know, everything was delayed...

1311
01:32:39,218 --> 01:32:42,717
and I-I, uh, don't remember every--

1312
01:32:46,516 --> 01:32:49,470
This is Mr Janello.

1313
01:32:49,561 --> 01:32:51,554
Did you have a conversation
with this man?

1314
01:32:56,318 --> 01:32:58,310
Yes, I did.

1315
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:05,774
And did you offer
to switch boarding passes with him?

1316
01:33:05,869 --> 01:33:08,110
- No, I did not.
- No?

1317
01:33:13,459 --> 01:33:16,330
I just gave him mine.
I didn't take his.

1318
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:19,540
And when Miss Guerrero
recognized you at the gate?

1319
01:33:20,883 --> 01:33:24,667
- Yeah, I talked her into it.
- By telling her if they didn't board
you or someone claiming to be you...

1320
01:33:24,762 --> 01:33:28,510
they'd have to wait while they took
your luggage out of the hold?

1321
01:33:28,599 --> 01:33:31,304
- Basically, yeah.
- Are you aware that airlines...

1322
01:33:31,393 --> 01:33:33,884
have to deplane the luggage of
passengers who don't make the flight...

1323
01:33:33,979 --> 01:33:36,055
- as an anti-terrorism measure?
- Yes.

1324
01:33:36,148 --> 01:33:39,433
It's, uh, so that somebody
doesn't check a bomb...

1325
01:33:39,526 --> 01:33:41,519
and then not get on the plane.

1326
01:33:41,612 --> 01:33:44,103
Mm-hmm.
So this employee of Infinity...

1327
01:33:44,198 --> 01:33:46,688
disregarded a safety measure due to
her desire to make the schedule?

1328
01:33:46,783 --> 01:33:49,239
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Sustained.

1329
01:33:49,327 --> 01:33:51,865
You know, she-she was just trying
to do me a favour. It wasn't--

1330
01:33:51,955 --> 01:33:54,991
No one's blaming you, Mr Amaral.

1331
01:33:55,083 --> 01:33:56,791
It wasn't your job to make sure
the airline...

1332
01:33:56,877 --> 01:33:59,035
followed their own safety procedures,
now, was it?

1333
01:34:07,262 --> 01:34:10,298
He was scared.

1334
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:12,382
Excuse me?

1335
01:34:14,769 --> 01:34:17,260
I didn't remember that until now.

1336
01:34:19,607 --> 01:34:21,896
Not scared, just nervous.

1337
01:34:23,069 --> 01:34:25,476
Not a good flier.

1338
01:34:25,571 --> 01:34:28,774
He told me he used to be braver
when he was like me--

1339
01:34:28,866 --> 01:34:31,701
by himself, no family.

1340
01:34:31,785 --> 01:34:34,074
No, uh...

1341
01:34:34,163 --> 01:34:36,155
people in his wallet.

1342
01:34:38,667 --> 01:34:40,873
He had a wife now...

1343
01:34:40,961 --> 01:34:42,954
two kids.

1344
01:34:46,049 --> 01:34:48,457
Two boys.

1345
01:34:49,678 --> 01:34:52,928
And he knew that, uh...

1346
01:34:53,014 --> 01:34:55,766
if something happened to him...

1347
01:34:55,851 --> 01:34:57,843
if he didn't come home...

1348
01:34:59,020 --> 01:35:02,389
that wasn't something that
anybody could make up for.

1349
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:06,439
If you-- If you tried, I mean.

1350
01:35:09,113 --> 01:35:11,106
Only somebody who, uh--

1351
01:35:12,825 --> 01:35:15,316
Only somebody who didn't
understand anything would try.

1352
01:35:21,417 --> 01:35:23,410
But I didn't know that then.

1353
01:35:26,964 --> 01:35:30,380
I just thought, here.

1354
01:35:30,468 --> 01:35:33,919
It's a ticket.
It's free. Take it.

1355
01:35:34,013 --> 01:35:36,005
You'll be fine.

1356
01:35:37,224 --> 01:35:39,217
And he did.

1357
01:35:43,272 --> 01:35:45,264
And he died.

1358
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:49,356
So that's what I gotta carry.

1359
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:56,362
I'd just like to say that I'm sorry.

1360
01:36:00,330 --> 01:36:02,323
You're excused, Mr Amaral.

1361
01:36:05,502 --> 01:36:07,578
Am I?

1362
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:09,663
Excused?

1363
01:36:32,194 --> 01:36:35,195
Infinity Airlines today settled
the last of the lawsuits...

1364
01:36:35,281 --> 01:36:39,065
that have gone to trial as a result
of the 1 999 crash in Kansas...

1365
01:36:39,159 --> 01:36:42,778
in which the 2 1 6 people aboard
Flight 82 lost their lives.

1366
01:36:49,753 --> 01:36:52,161
- Hey, Seth.
- Hey.

1367
01:36:52,256 --> 01:36:55,292
Word is you pretty much
single-handedly sank Infinity.

1368
01:36:55,384 --> 01:36:59,298
Yeah. I noticed a chill
on the way in.

1369
01:36:59,387 --> 01:37:03,337
Yeah? Well, bundle up.
Uncle Jim wants to see you.

1370
01:37:05,018 --> 01:37:07,509
Could you do me a favour
and type this up for me, please?

1371
01:37:38,467 --> 01:37:42,512
- I thought Jim's speech was nice.
- Yeah, but everyone else-- Whoo.

1372
01:37:42,596 --> 01:37:45,965
I know. I don't think
I've ever been to a farewell party
where the theme was relief.

1373
01:37:46,058 --> 01:37:48,928
Well, I like to leave a place happier
than when I found it, you know.

1374
01:37:49,019 --> 01:37:52,684
They were happy, all right.
I was dodging cartwheels all afternoon.

1375
01:37:53,899 --> 01:37:56,816
So are you gonna find a new job
or are you gonna go out on your own?

1376
01:37:56,902 --> 01:37:59,819
- I stole you plenty of office supplies.
- Yeah.

1377
01:37:59,905 --> 01:38:04,033
I don't know. I'm kind of
all sold out, you know what I mean?

1378
01:38:04,117 --> 01:38:06,110
I told Jim you could handle
the transition.

1379
01:38:06,202 --> 01:38:09,203
He said he was gonna move you into
account traffic.

1380
01:38:09,289 --> 01:38:11,780
He came up with that all on his own?

1381
01:38:11,875 --> 01:38:15,208
Yeah, roughly.
Means you get your own assistant.

1382
01:38:15,295 --> 01:38:18,545
Is this you asking me for the job?

1383
01:38:18,631 --> 01:38:20,920
You want to, uh, catch
an AA meeting tonight?

1384
01:38:21,009 --> 01:38:24,460
Yeah. Uh, there's the one--

1385
01:38:30,518 --> 01:38:32,060
Hey.

1386
01:38:33,437 --> 01:38:35,430
Hey.

1387
01:38:38,234 --> 01:38:41,353
Uh, I-I need to get back to work...

1388
01:38:41,445 --> 01:38:44,612
and take down
the ''Good Riddance'' banners.

1389
01:38:44,698 --> 01:38:48,067
We love the new building.
Lots of space, and...

1390
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,153
even more after today.

1391
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:59,620
I resigned about three minutes
before Jim was gonna fire me.

1392
01:39:05,385 --> 01:39:07,674
You're moving.

1393
01:39:07,762 --> 01:39:10,384
Yeah. I can't afford
this place any more.

1394
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:14,841
How are the boys?

1395
01:39:16,354 --> 01:39:18,845
They're good.

1396
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:22,523
Scott told me
that you came to see him.

1397
01:39:22,610 --> 01:39:24,982
And he told me what you said.

1398
01:39:26,114 --> 01:39:29,399
Well, it wasn't Scott's fault.

1399
01:39:31,244 --> 01:39:33,995
Or yours.

1400
01:39:35,122 --> 01:39:38,289
Or even mine,
which is something that I thought...

1401
01:39:38,375 --> 01:39:40,368
for a really long time.

1402
01:39:41,504 --> 01:39:46,746
And you really helped me see that,
and I wanted to tell you, so--

1403
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:51,594
Can you just stay for, like,
a few more minutes?

1404
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,838
please?

1405
01:39:57,894 --> 01:40:01,477
You know what Greg said
that last night he called?

1406
01:40:04,651 --> 01:40:07,486
That he had met some really
nice people in the bar.

1407
01:40:11,116 --> 01:40:13,737
And I think he was right.

1408
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:19,452
Abby, wait.

1409
01:40:19,541 --> 01:40:21,747
What?

1410
01:40:31,135 --> 01:40:34,504
Should I sell this place
right away or, uh...

1411
01:40:34,597 --> 01:40:37,349
lease it out
until the market peaks?

1412
01:40:39,226 --> 01:40:42,975
I was hoping
you could help me handle that.

1413
01:40:50,612 --> 01:40:55,488
Why me? I mean,
I really don't have the experience.

1414
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:59,153
Yes, you do.

1415
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:05,493
Can we try?

1416
01:41:07,504 --> 01:41:11,371
I know you're scared, Abby.
I am too.

1417
01:41:16,513 --> 01:41:19,086
It's not brave
if you're not scared.

1418
01:41:28,024 --> 01:41:31,938
You'd better not be waiting for me
to kick in any commission.

1419
01:41:32,028 --> 01:41:34,020
Deal.

1420
01:41:36,032 --> 01:41:38,653
Come on. I'll show you
how it looks from the beach, okay?

1421
01:42:12,234 --> 01:42:16,777
Been running from these feelings
for so long

1422
01:42:16,863 --> 01:42:20,279
Telling my heart
I didn't need you

1423
01:42:20,366 --> 01:42:24,613
pretending I was better off alone

1424
01:42:24,704 --> 01:42:28,452
But I know that it's just a lie

1425
01:42:28,541 --> 01:42:32,870
So afraid to take a chance again

1426
01:42:32,962 --> 01:42:36,794
So afraid of what I'd feel inside

1427
01:42:36,883 --> 01:42:39,919
But I need to be next to you

1428
01:42:40,011 --> 01:42:42,762
Need to be next to you

1429
01:42:42,847 --> 01:42:47,140
Oh, I, oh, I

1430
01:42:47,226 --> 01:42:50,761
I need to share every breath with you

1431
01:42:50,854 --> 01:42:53,524
Share every breath with you

1432
01:42:53,607 --> 01:42:58,020
Oh, I, oh, I

1433
01:42:58,112 --> 01:43:02,061
I need to know I can see
your smile each morning

1434
01:43:02,157 --> 01:43:05,407
Look into your eyes each night

1435
01:43:05,494 --> 01:43:09,408
For the rest of my life

1436
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:14,993
Here with you, near with you
Oh, I

1437
01:43:15,086 --> 01:43:18,870
I need to be next to you

1438
01:43:20,508 --> 01:43:25,550
Need to be next to you

1439
01:43:25,638 --> 01:43:30,466
Right here with you
is right where I belong

1440
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,810
I'll lose my mind
if I can't see you

1441
01:43:33,896 --> 01:43:38,274
Without you, there is
nothing in this life

1442
01:43:38,359 --> 01:43:41,977
That would make life
worth living for

1443
01:43:42,071 --> 01:43:46,400
I can't bear the thought
of you not there

1444
01:43:46,492 --> 01:43:50,157
I can't find what I feel any more

1445
01:43:50,246 --> 01:43:53,531
'Cause I need to be next to you

1446
01:43:53,624 --> 01:43:56,376
Need to be next to you

1447
01:43:56,460 --> 01:44:00,671
Oh, I, oh, I

1448
01:44:00,756 --> 01:44:04,374
I need to share
every breath with you

1449
01:44:04,468 --> 01:44:07,137
Share every breath with you

1450
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:11,514
Oh, I, oh, I

1451
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:15,644
I need to know I can see
your smile each morning

1452
01:44:15,729 --> 01:44:18,979
Look into your eyes each night

1453
01:44:19,065 --> 01:44:23,193
For the rest of my life

1454
01:44:24,946 --> 01:44:28,529
Here with you, near with you
Oh, I

1455
01:44:28,616 --> 01:44:32,032
I need to be next to you

1456
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:36,532
I need to have your heart
next to mine

1457
01:44:38,251 --> 01:44:41,168
For all time

1458
01:44:41,254 --> 01:44:44,919
Hold you for all of my life

1459
01:44:45,007 --> 01:44:49,254
I need to be next to you

1460
01:44:55,893 --> 01:44:58,894
I need to be next to you

1461
01:44:58,979 --> 01:45:01,684
Need to be next to you

1462
01:45:01,774 --> 01:45:06,151
Oh, I, oh, I

1463
01:45:06,236 --> 01:45:09,735
I need to share
every breath with you

1464
01:45:09,823 --> 01:45:12,528
Share every breath with you

1465
01:45:12,617 --> 01:45:16,995
Oh, I, oh, I

1466
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:21,030
I need to know I can see
your smile each morning

1467
01:45:21,126 --> 01:45:24,411
Look into your eyes each night

1468
01:45:24,504 --> 01:45:28,715
For the rest of my life

1469
01:45:30,301 --> 01:45:33,966
Here with you, near with you
Oh, I

1470
01:45:34,055 --> 01:45:37,755
I need to be next to you

1471
01:45:39,852 --> 01:45:42,522
Oh, I

1472
01:45:42,605 --> 01:45:45,440
Oh, I need to be

1473
01:45:45,524 --> 01:45:48,015
Need to be next to you

1474
01:45:48,110 --> 01:45:50,684
- Oh, I
- Share every breath with you

1475
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:53,235
Oh, I

1476
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:58,953
I need to feel you in my arms, baby

1477
01:45:59,038 --> 01:46:01,659
- Oh, I
