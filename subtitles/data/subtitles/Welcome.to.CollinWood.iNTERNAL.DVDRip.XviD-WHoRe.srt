00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,941
I'm the wrong guy! I'm the wrong guy!
I'm the wrong guy! I'm the wrong guy!

2
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,893
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

3
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:32,114
Your mother's a whore! Man! Come on.

4
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:55,094
What's so fucking funny?

5
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:58,987
Hey, keep laughing at me
and I'll kill you.

6
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:03,533
I'm not laughing at you.
I'm laughing at life.

7
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:05,551
Life ain't funny, so quit it!

8
00:03:05,714 --> 00:03:11,214
Listen to me.
I'm gonna tell you a secret.

9
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:14,925
A secret so you can laugh too.

10
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,051
Listen to me, you fool!

11
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:24,042
I am gonna tell you something
that will change your life.

12
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:31,410
You remember the old brick building
on Chester Avenue?

13
00:03:31,572 --> 00:03:35,434
- There's a million brick buildings on...
- No! No.

14
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:37,841
The old flour factory.

15
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,002
With the bright gold brick.

16
00:03:52,437 --> 00:03:53,811
What about it?

17
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:58,795
I'll wait for you
and think of you every night.

18
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:00,624
Listen to me, idiot.

19
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:06,987
I need a Mullinski.
I want you to go back to Collinwood.

20
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:11,348
Find someone to take the rap
for this car fiasco for me.

21
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:14,060
I'll pay 15 grand.

22
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:18,386
Fifteen grand?
Where are you gonna get 15 grand?

23
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,331
From a shoebox.

24
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:24,498
What shoebox?

25
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:28,467
It's under my bed.

26
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:33,777
You said we couldn't get married,
because you were broke.

27
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:39,924
You lied to me, you son of a bitch.
Of all the shit you've put me through.

28
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:43,187
If we'd used that money,
I'm stuck in here.

29
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:46,288
- You want that? You want me in jail?
- No. No.

30
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:50,864
- I want you to buy me a ring.
- All right. Listen to what I'm saying.

31
00:04:51,593 --> 00:04:56,611
I heard about a job in here.
The greatest job I've ever heard of.

32
00:04:56,776 --> 00:05:01,565
It'll give us all the money we could
ever use for the rest of our lives.

33
00:05:01,832 --> 00:05:06,239
If I get you a Mullinski,
will you marry me?

34
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,160
Will you?

35
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:11,779
All right! All right! On my mother.

36
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:17,533
All right. I'll get you a Mullinski.

37
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:28,578
- Who is it?
- It's Rosalind, Toto. Open up.

38
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:30,493
Toto no here!

39
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:32,931
No Toto.

40
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:37,565
- How'd you find me?
- This is where you live?

41
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:41,988
- Well, how do you know?
- It's me, Rosalind. Cosimo's woman.

42
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:47,200
Sweet Jesus. He gave me up, didn't he?
I tried to get him out of that car.

43
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:50,911
- I swear to God!
- Relax, old man. He didn't give you up.

44
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:53,345
- He needs your help.
- How can I help?

45
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:58,494
I'm like a caged animal! All day,
cops everywhere. I don't eat or sleep.

46
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,232
The cops can only get you through
Cosimo, and he'd never give you up.

47
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,178
But you've gotta help.
He needs a Mullinski.

48
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,892
I can't Mullinski for him.
I already did.

49
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:13,816
- The judge would lock us both up!
- No. He needs you to find a Mullinski.

50
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:18,268
- The offer's 15 grand.
- Fifteen.

51
00:06:18,435 --> 00:06:23,192
I spent a year in isolation for him,
he only gave me five.

52
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:27,835
Yeah, well, somebody told him
about a job in there.

53
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:31,777
A job? What kind of job?

54
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:34,689
Can I trust you?

55
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:40,349
He says it could be his Bellini.

56
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,512
- Fifteen for a Mullinski?
- Yeah.

57
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:48,527
- What's the charge?
- Grand-theft auto.

58
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:51,207
Shit, forget it. I can't do it.

59
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:56,494
What are you talking about?
Grand-theft's easy, I did it.

60
00:06:58,095 --> 00:07:04,075
It's not the time. It's my mother.
She'd die on the spot.

61
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:08,363
Well, she'd die happier knowing
you had 15 grand in your pocket.

62
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:11,593
What are you, sick?
Forget it. I'm not doing it.

63
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,535
Look, you're gonna turn down
15 grand for a Mullinski?

64
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:19,079
What do you want from me?
I told you, I can't do it.

65
00:07:19,248 --> 00:07:22,860
Let Cosimo rot.
He's the biggest asshole in Collinwood.

66
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,854
- Look, swear you'll never repeat this.
- What?

67
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:31,563
Swear. Cosimo will kill me
if he ever finds out I told you.

68
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:36,550
- Come on. All right, I swear.
- Cosimo, he's got this big job lined up.

69
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:40,333
- Big? How big?
- Huge.

70
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:43,688
All that's huge about Cosimo
is his fat head.

71
00:07:43,857 --> 00:07:47,653
- He says it's his Bellini.
- His Bellini.

72
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:50,989
Everybody in this neighborhood's
got a Bellini.

73
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:52,746
- Hey, Mickey.
- What's up?

74
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:55,848
- How's your Bellini?
- Watch your mouth.

75
00:07:57,713 --> 00:08:00,561
No. Cosimo's...

76
00:08:00,722 --> 00:08:02,577
Cosimo's is real.

77
00:08:02,738 --> 00:08:05,389
A lifer gave it up to him
in the joint.

78
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:09,547
That's why he's so desperate
to find a Mullinski.

79
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:12,656
A lifer gave it up to him?

80
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:15,949
You see, I figure...

81
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:23,537
...if we help Cosimo get out, maybe we
can get in on some of the action.

82
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:30,873
- How much action?
- Cosimo says 300 grand.

83
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,707
- Holy shit.
- Yeah. I know.

84
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:38,900
I don't know.

85
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:45,177
Look. How much money did you wake up
with in your pocket this morning?

86
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,468
Fifty-five cents.

87
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,735
What have you got to lose?

88
00:08:55,999 --> 00:09:00,190
- Do you know Leon?
- That Negro who hides his sister?

89
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:03,581
He's a nut case,
but he always needs dough.

90
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:07,486
I can't do it.
My sister's engaged to be married.

91
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:13,366
Jesus. This will pay for the wedding.
This is 10 grand we're talking about.

92
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:18,358
Fiancé's a snob from the suburbs. If I
go to the pen, there'd be no wedding.

93
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,945
This is crazy. How hard can it be
to find a Mullinski?

94
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:25,245
You gotta know somebody
that could use the dough.

95
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:29,751
- Friends who'd be better off in jail.
- What the fuck does that mean?

96
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:31,776
It means what it means.

97
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:37,721
Screw Cosimo. Why give a shit?
He's the biggest asshole in Collinwood.

98
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:43,454
- Yeah, but he's got a Bellini.
- What are you doing to me?

99
00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:47,709
- You wanna find a Mullinski?
- Every sucker's got a Bellini.

100
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:51,671
This one's legit.
A lifer gave it up to him.

101
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,876
Anybody who helps
can get a piece of the action.

102
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:58,359
- Why didn't the lifer pull it?
- Because he's a lifer.

103
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,767
He went to the pen before he could.

104
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:05,373
A genuine Bellini?
You swear on your mother?

105
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:09,567
I swear on my mother.

106
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:13,153
Goddamn.

107
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,128
You fellows know Riley?

108
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:23,906
What the fuck are you doing?

109
00:10:25,476 --> 00:10:28,476
I just got the baby to sleep
after three hours.

110
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:30,842
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

111
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:37,283
It's all right.
It's just... He's very neurotic.

112
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:39,233
Noises...

113
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:44,319
...and bright lights upset him terribly.

114
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:49,057
I'm sorry. If you're here for pictures,
I'm out of the business.

115
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:55,039
My wife's in the pen. I had to sell my
cameras to buy diapers and baby food.

116
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:58,148
But if you're interested...

117
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:02,235
...I'm selling drinking glasses.
I paint them.

118
00:11:02,407 --> 00:11:06,946
They're all hand-painted. By me.
If you're interested.

119
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:14,178
- Sweet Jesus, I am so broke.
- Funny you should mention that.

120
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:15,905
You got a job?

121
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:20,417
Cosimo needs a Mullinski.
He's willing to pay 10 large for it.

122
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:22,275
Ten large?

123
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:30,432
That's two bucks a jar.

124
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:34,566
I can't. It's impossible.
I got the kid, for chrissake.

125
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,705
- Where's your wife?
- Seneca.

126
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:40,355
They gave her a year for fraud.
Even with a newborn.

127
00:11:40,522 --> 00:11:44,352
They set her fine at 1000 bucks.
Christ.

128
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:50,721
We're so broke, she had to do the time.
A year for 1000 bucks. I know.

129
00:11:50,891 --> 00:11:54,470
You know, they've got
a fabulous nursery at Seneca.

130
00:11:54,636 --> 00:11:57,386
- I was born there.
- We're in a real pickle.

131
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:00,331
We need a Mullinski.
We need one fast.

132
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:02,249
You're not gonna...

133
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:06,183
You're not gonna get an ex-con
for grand-theft auto.

134
00:12:06,349 --> 00:12:11,106
You need somebody with a clean record
so the judge'll go easy on him.

135
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,312
Jesus, it's not like
the old days anymore.

136
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,593
You guys know Pero?

137
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:25,959
Baby coming through.
Baby coming through.

138
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,436
Baby coming through.
Baby-fucking-coming through.

139
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:31,680
Here, let's put this on you.

140
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,310
- Are you out of your lunatic mind?
- What?

141
00:12:42,473 --> 00:12:46,368
- Cosimo won't share his job with them.
- It was an accident.

142
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:50,497
- I was talking, my mouth slipped.
- He's gonna kill me for this.

143
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:52,072
He's gonna kill me.

144
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:56,488
- I'm not going to prison for that fool.
- Not even for 15 grand?

145
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:00,194
- You told us 10.
- My boxing career's about to take off.

146
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:03,012
- You're fighting a priest.
- A tough priest.

147
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:06,526
You rather I fight a woman?
Tonight, I fight a priest.

148
00:13:06,697 --> 00:13:09,118
Tomorrow, I fight
for the championship.

149
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,250
- This jackass is our last chance.
- Maybe sweeten the deal.

150
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:17,574
He's this close. I say we go
equal parts on another 1000.

151
00:13:17,738 --> 00:13:20,291
A thousand dollars
would get my wife out.

152
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,931
What is it with you guys?
You gotta spend money to make money.

153
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:29,637
Man, she's right. If we don't
spring Cosimo, there's no job.

154
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:34,275
We'll go 16,000 on the deal.

155
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:40,547
I don't need it. When my career takes
off, I'm spinning on this neighborhood.

156
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:43,431
- Mahlovic, you're up! Let's go.
- All right.

157
00:13:43,594 --> 00:13:45,634
See you after the fight.

158
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:48,191
Pero, buma- ye!

159
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:51,494
I'm so pretty. I'm so pretty. Come on!

160
00:14:08,524 --> 00:14:13,445
Cosimo Cosanawowski, for attempted
grand-theft auto, you are sentenced to...

161
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:17,801
- Stop the proceedings! Stop!
- Order. Order.

162
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:21,793
- Hold on! Hear me out. Hear me out.
- Remove him.

163
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:29,255
Please, Your Honor, I'm here to confess.
That man is innocent.

164
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:33,354
Your Honor, I can no longer live
with the guilt.

165
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:38,054
It was me who was stealing that car.
I confess.

166
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:43,620
My brother Cosimo, Saint Cosimo,
as he's known on the streets...

167
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:47,394
...was only trying to stop me.
I told him:

168
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:50,312
"Cosimo, I mean to steal this car.

169
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:55,264
I am a car thief.
I steal cars. By myself."

170
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:58,502
I'm gonna kill you!

171
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:02,344
- Wait. Hold on.
- You're the worst Mullinski ever.

172
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:08,489
Not only that, you added six months.
Six months to my sentence.

173
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,806
Six months. Six months.
Who cares about six months?

174
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,392
I just got three fucking years, man!

175
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:19,937
I want my money back. Otherwise,
you're gonna die in this prison.

176
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:22,080
- Get out.
- Fine. I don't care.

177
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,184
I don't care about anything anymore.

178
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:27,967
What's the matter with you?

179
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,980
Come on. Prison is easy, you puss.

180
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:35,782
No. You don't understand.
I betrayed my brother.

181
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:37,636
Maybe he deserved it.

182
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:43,584
He's dying, you jackass!
My real brother, Bleeko, is dying.

183
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,535
Now he'll have to die alone.

184
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:51,136
Just last week he said to me...

185
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:57,382
He said, " Pero, be there for me
in the final moments...

186
00:15:57,544 --> 00:16:02,148
...when death has me in its deadly grip.
Don't let me go it alone."

187
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:06,851
I swore to him I wouldn't,
but I betrayed him.

188
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:10,399
For a lousy 16 grand.

189
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:33,148
- You're a sick bastard.
- No, I'm not laughing at you.

190
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:38,532
I'm laughing at... You wanna hear
something gonna cheer you up?

191
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:41,508
You know that old building
on Chester Avenue?

192
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:45,892
- There's a million old buildings.
- The factory with the gold brick.

193
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:49,947
- What about it?
- It's not a flour factory anymore.

194
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,239
Half became apartments.
Guess what's on the other half?

195
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:55,998
I don't care.

196
00:16:57,188 --> 00:17:00,155
- A jewelry shylock.
- So what?

197
00:17:00,324 --> 00:17:03,902
So my cellmate, the bricklayer,
he split the building.

198
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:06,043
- He pulled a Krazner.
- What?

199
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:07,838
You know, a Krazner.

200
00:17:08,004 --> 00:17:12,194
He mortared the wall between
the apartment and the shylock...

201
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:15,323
...with sand and water.
You can push through it.

202
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:20,281
Shylock's a big shot. The bricklayer
said he has a fortune in that safe.

203
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:23,135
You still have to break
into the apartment.

204
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,221
That's the beauty of it. Nobody lives
there. It's vacant. You can walk in.

205
00:17:28,484 --> 00:17:31,167
You're a bigger jackass
than everyone says.

206
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:34,812
- What are you talking about?
- lf this job is so good...

207
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,730
...why didn't the old man
pull it himself.

208
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,218
Two days before the job,
he fights with his wife.

209
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,242
Shoots her dead. He's a lifer now,
so he gave me the job.

210
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:51,128
You were to spring me so I could
pull it. Now we're in the can together.

211
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:54,654
- Funny shit, huh?
- Yeah, it is.

212
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,081
- I mean, really funny, right?
- You have no idea.

213
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:01,788
- You're free to go.
- Thanks.

214
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:05,338
Where's he going?
You told me you had three years.

215
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:09,085
You know, I did,
but the judge suspended the sentence.

216
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:15,583
I'm gonna fucking kill you! You son
of a bitch. Your mother's a whore.

217
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:19,609
- My mother's a what?
- A whore! Your mother's a whore!

218
00:18:28,835 --> 00:18:34,170
- Goddamn! Shit. Come to see me home?
- I want the money back.

219
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:38,430
I did my job, baby. It's not
my fault the judge didn't buy it.

220
00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:43,231
- I'm dead if I don't get that money.
- Look who flew the coop.

221
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:45,282
If it isn't a $ 16,000 man.

222
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:50,331
We don't care what went wrong. We just
want our stake in the money back.

223
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:53,499
What's the fuck's the matter
with you people?

224
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,536
- That money's mine.
- We don't want trouble.

225
00:19:05,564 --> 00:19:09,557
- You want me to take it out of your ass?
- Fuck you!

226
00:19:11,388 --> 00:19:13,177
You want more, funny boy?

227
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:15,129
- Christ.
- Where's the money?

228
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:18,292
- I don't have it.
- Well, you better find it.

229
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,285
- Jesus Christ!
- Just give us the money.

230
00:19:23,451 --> 00:19:25,655
I gave the money to my debtors.

231
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,365
- All 16,000?
- I still owe another 5 to Leo the Lip.

232
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:34,866
- He's lying.
- Wait, wait. I got the Bellini.

233
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:38,351
- I got Cosimo's Bellini.
- Bullshit. Stick him again.

234
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:43,094
I swear to God! I told him I got
three years, and he gave it up to me.

235
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:47,088
- So what?
- So I'll cut you in on it.

236
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:48,970
Equal shares. All of you.

237
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:52,840
It's the greatest job I ever heard of.
A jewelry shylock.

238
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:54,530
Let's hear it then.

239
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:57,514
- I can't breathe.
- Let him up. Let him up.

240
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:03,905
You watch yourself, fucker.

241
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:06,176
Fuck.

242
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:12,743
- I feel weak.
- Shit.

243
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,013
Jesus, we killed him.

244
00:20:16,363 --> 00:20:19,429
The safe's on the second floor
of the pawnshop.

245
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,811
The apartment next
to the pawnshop is empty.

246
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:28,519
We break into the apartment,
smash a hole in the wall...

247
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,325
...climb into the shylock's
and crack the safe.

248
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:36,903
That's the easy part.

249
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:41,891
Trouble is that building's like
a fortress. The front door's alarmed.

250
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,223
The best way is through
the coal chute next door.

251
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:48,005
Take the back fire escape to the roof.

252
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:52,579
Then we drop to the apartment window,
and we cut it open.

253
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,396
Anybody know a safecracker?

254
00:20:56,139 --> 00:21:01,289
- Jerzy Antwerp is the only one I know.
- Wait a minute. Hold him, would you?

255
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,518
I got an idea.

256
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:09,926
I was thinking, with a camera, I could
shoot the shylock opening the safe.

257
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:12,906
- We could get the combination.
- Brilliant.

258
00:21:13,163 --> 00:21:15,050
Where we gonna get a camera?

259
00:21:15,212 --> 00:21:20,645
We could pay a little visit
to a guy I know at the flea market.

260
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:28,998
So, what are you hocking today, Riley?
Your kid?

261
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,269
Treat me with more respect.

262
00:21:31,436 --> 00:21:35,843
It just so happens I came
into some money. I'm a buyer today.

263
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:42,056
- It's nice. I like the browns.
- Yes, but what about the reds?

264
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:45,414
What do you think? It's for my sister.

265
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,336
Is there too much red?

266
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,802
She's been institutionalized, and the
color red makes her bark like a dog.

267
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:56,778
Yes, after all, I believe
there is too much red.

268
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,454
I'm sorry, Oswald,
but your paintings are crap.

269
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,562
Let's go to Sears.

270
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:09,669
Okay. Here we go.

271
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:15,403
- What is this?
- Sorry.

272
00:22:15,565 --> 00:22:18,053
I shot some footage of him
for his mom.

273
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:19,912
He's a cute baby.

274
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:24,236
That's his new food.
He's not taking to it too well.

275
00:22:24,397 --> 00:22:26,470
- I like it.
- Riley, come on.

276
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,124
- It's good food.
- You're killing me.

277
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:30,570
Here we go.

278
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:36,395
- The Hassenfeffer 622.
- Is that good or bad?

279
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:37,986
Neither.

280
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:42,120
Okay, okay, watch this.

281
00:22:52,077 --> 00:22:55,045
- Seventy-eight.
- Seventy-seven.

282
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:57,830
- Eight.
- Seventy-eight. Eight.

283
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:01,094
- Whoa.
- Jesus Christ.

284
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,570
- Seventy-seven.
- What's that number?

285
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:12,359
Seventy-eight.

286
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:16,780
- What is the number?
- It's an eight. Seventy-eight, eight.

287
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:19,014
- That's great.
- We did nine takes.

288
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:22,858
Every time, on the last number,
he does this.

289
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:24,614
He's like a gimp.

290
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:26,636
Sorry.

291
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,004
So, what do you think?

292
00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:36,333
Well, as a film, it's a disaster.

293
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,906
It's a documentary.
It's supposed to look like that.

294
00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:46,567
The good news is,
the safe is crackable.

295
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:50,249
So how do we...? What do we...?

296
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:54,691
How do we do this?
Do I carry you on my back?

297
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:59,177
This may be a shock, but I don't
go out in the field anymore.

298
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:03,170
- See. What the hell's he doing here?
- I teach.

299
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:06,121
For 500 bucks,
I show you how to do it.

300
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:08,226
- 500 bucks?
- 500 bucks?

301
00:24:08,397 --> 00:24:09,989
Be quiet. The baby.

302
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:16,708
We're all tapped out here. That's why
we're doing this job in the first place.

303
00:24:16,876 --> 00:24:19,975
- We'll cut you in.
- I don't take back-end money.

304
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,409
- There's a fortune in that safe.
- Five hundred bucks, that's a deal.

305
00:24:25,803 --> 00:24:28,454
- My time is valuable.
- All right. Hold on.

306
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:29,863
Hold your horses.

307
00:24:30,027 --> 00:24:32,874
Can you get us through a Krazner wall?

308
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:37,829
Well, who do you think Krazner called?

309
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,394
- All right. So then it's a deal.
- Good.

310
00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:45,800
Be at my place Saturday afternoon.

311
00:24:45,963 --> 00:24:49,737
If you'll excuse me,
I have a class to teach in Youngstown.

312
00:24:51,787 --> 00:24:57,024
Five hundred bucks? Did I mention I'm
trying to get my wife out of the clink?

313
00:24:57,194 --> 00:25:01,220
- Where can we get that kind of money?
- We could mug someone.

314
00:25:01,386 --> 00:25:03,720
There's gotta be something.

315
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,841
I think I can get the money.

316
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:15,040
- How much do you need?
- Just a small loan for a new suit.

317
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:20,039
I met a nice girl.
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

318
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:22,241
You're getting married?

319
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:25,311
- lf she says yes.
- So how much?

320
00:25:26,665 --> 00:25:28,639
Five hundred dollars.

321
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:32,965
Five hundred dollars?
It must be some suit.

322
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:37,985
It's beautiful.
With buttons and shoes.

323
00:25:38,152 --> 00:25:42,757
Well, I hope she can make
an honest man out of you.

324
00:25:44,936 --> 00:25:47,173
At the usual interest?

325
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:52,615
- At the usual interest.
- We're still better than Leo the Lip.

326
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:55,622
There are many methods
to cracking a safe.

327
00:25:55,784 --> 00:26:01,447
Each method has an inverse relationship
between quickness and cleanness.

328
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:07,189
The quickest is Lipchiski Method, named
for its originator, Theodore Lipchiski.

329
00:26:07,356 --> 00:26:12,758
The Lipchiski Method requires a stick
of dynamite and a match. Very quick.

330
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:17,942
But as we learned when Lipchiski blew
himself up in Toledo, it's not clean.

331
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:23,346
Hence, I teach the circular-saw method.

332
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:28,786
Not the quickest, but the cleanest.
You and your loot will emerge unharmed.

333
00:26:28,957 --> 00:26:33,081
This is the method that I was taught.
It is what I believe in.

334
00:26:33,245 --> 00:26:38,363
- You want Lipchiski, go somewhere else.
- The police are here! They're coming!

335
00:26:38,526 --> 00:26:40,947
They were just here. Hide the safe.

336
00:26:41,118 --> 00:26:43,933
- Where?
- Hide the fucking safe. Throw it off.

337
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:46,396
- We can't move it.
- The cops are here.

338
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,100
You think that's funny?
You son of a bitch.

339
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,026
You little son of a bitch.

340
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,452
Fucking midget.
I'm gonna come out of this chair.

341
00:26:55,615 --> 00:27:00,121
I'm gonna fuck you up.
I hate that fucking kid.

342
00:27:03,006 --> 00:27:04,381
Where was I?

343
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:08,318
- Circular...
- Circular saw. Circular-saw method.

344
00:27:09,823 --> 00:27:14,199
You take the saw like so:
You apply it like so:

345
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:18,590
You crank it like so:
In three hours, you got your hole.

346
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:20,159
- What time is it?
- Two.

347
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,062
- We'll now begin a full demonstration.
- The police are here!

348
00:27:24,224 --> 00:27:27,999
Baby! Sgt. Babitch is here.
He's coming around the back.

349
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,772
- He'll bury us. Hide the fucking safe!
- What? Where?

350
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,630
All right, guys. Take five.
That's good.

351
00:27:45,793 --> 00:27:49,819
Babitch! What a surprise.
You caught us on laundry day.

352
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:52,407
You sing while you launder?

353
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:56,439
- Speak English.
- We're a chorus for the church.

354
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,774
- Which church is that?
- It's the...

355
00:27:59,938 --> 00:28:01,694
We tour.

356
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:09,566
Would you know anything
about a job in Youngstown?

357
00:28:09,762 --> 00:28:12,926
A safe with a hole
about the size of your head.

358
00:28:14,082 --> 00:28:15,643
Where's Youngstown?

359
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,733
Now, wait a minute here.

360
00:28:23,214 --> 00:28:25,516
I know all you guys.

361
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:28,357
You're all from Collinwood.

362
00:28:30,446 --> 00:28:32,356
And you're all bums.

363
00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:38,691
You're Pero Mahlovic, aren't you?
I knew your brother.

364
00:28:38,862 --> 00:28:43,237
He was a shitty fighter,
which is more than I can say for you.

365
00:28:43,406 --> 00:28:46,887
- What's your angle here, Mahlovic?
- I'm the tenor.

366
00:28:47,055 --> 00:28:49,062
You're a joker, huh?

367
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:53,575
Well, you keep laughing, champ.
All the way to the pen.

368
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,222
If a job goes down in the next few
weeks, I'll know whose asses to string.

369
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:07,213
Jesus.

370
00:29:08,943 --> 00:29:11,278
You better watch your back, boys.

371
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:15,119
Where have you been?
My kid's starving.

372
00:29:15,312 --> 00:29:20,200
- The bus never came. I had to walk.
- Down you go. Good boy.

373
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,214
Give me a square,
and I'll forget about it.

374
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:27,500
The shylock comes at 6.
He opens up at 7.

375
00:29:27,664 --> 00:29:29,125
Good luck.

376
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,105
Hey, give me a light.

377
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:44,202
Jesus, she's a live one.

378
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:50,189
Yeah.

379
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:20,554
What the fuck is this, man?

380
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:25,928
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
- What the fuck is this?

381
00:30:26,477 --> 00:30:32,326
My best friend's cousin told me
the old ladies are the shylock's aunts.

382
00:30:34,253 --> 00:30:36,523
They're getting senile.

383
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:40,906
So he moved them in next door
to keep an eye on them.

384
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,536
- The girl's their maid.
- The maid, huh?

385
00:30:46,894 --> 00:30:50,691
Well, don't worry.
I once seduced the first lady.

386
00:30:54,927 --> 00:30:58,604
You sure this isn't gonna
make you jealous or anything?

387
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:00,425
You're a piece of work.

388
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:05,163
As hard as you find it to believe,
I think you're a pig.

389
00:31:17,712 --> 00:31:20,462
- Shit.
- You're a real pizda. You know that?

390
00:31:20,624 --> 00:31:22,795
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

391
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:28,457
- Baby, where you going in such a hurry?
- Your mama teach you how to walk?

392
00:31:28,624 --> 00:31:32,487
Whoa, slow down, sugar.
Give a little love to a black man.

393
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:34,183
Whoa, whoa.

394
00:31:35,024 --> 00:31:38,505
Look at that. Baby got an ass
like bubble-gum ice cream.

395
00:31:38,673 --> 00:31:40,266
The kind we like to lick.

396
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:44,230
Why don't you leave the girl alone,
you street bums.

397
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:46,742
Scram, before we lay one on you.

398
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,785
- I'll carve you like a turkey, honky.
- Put the knife away.

399
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,359
Hit me.

400
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,080
Put the knife...

401
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:05,494
- Don't hit me no more.
- Hurry up. Go get her.

402
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:07,575
- Are you okay?
- Go get her.

403
00:32:07,746 --> 00:32:11,423
Miss! Miss, I don't mean any harm.

404
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:14,395
Miss. Are you all right, miss?

405
00:32:14,562 --> 00:32:18,392
That was quite an experience.
Every day, I say to myself:

406
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:23,265
" Pero, you're a lucky man. Your father
could afford a private school...

407
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:28,249
...where among gaining a degree in
learning, you also mastered boxing."

408
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:33,024
- That was quite a punch you threw.
- It was just a couple of bums.

409
00:32:33,188 --> 00:32:37,825
- I wanted to make sure you're okay.
- I'm fine. Now excuse me, I'm late.

410
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,650
You're late? That's funny. So am I.
Which direction are you going?

411
00:32:42,821 --> 00:32:45,855
- This way.
- That's funny. So am I.

412
00:32:46,213 --> 00:32:49,279
- What are you late for?
- I'm meeting my boyfriend.

413
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:52,958
- He's a doctor.
- A doctor. Really? What do you do?

414
00:32:53,126 --> 00:32:57,055
Me? I don't work.
I shop. I play tennis.

415
00:32:57,222 --> 00:32:59,841
Oh, really? Well, I'm a salesman.

416
00:33:00,006 --> 00:33:02,373
Congratulations. What do you sell?

417
00:33:02,534 --> 00:33:07,204
All sorts of things.
Big things. Expensive.

418
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:09,789
- You from around here?
- No, Collinwood.

419
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:14,498
Even though I could afford more,
I live humbly. I like humble people.

420
00:33:14,663 --> 00:33:19,552
For instance, if you were, say,
I don't know, a maid and not an heiress...

421
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,720
...I'd still think you were
just as pretty.

422
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:25,639
Hey, what's happening, young blood?

423
00:33:27,113 --> 00:33:30,212
Crazy kids.
That's a joke we play on each other.

424
00:33:30,377 --> 00:33:32,100
So where do you live?

425
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:37,154
I live in an apartment with my aunts,
but my boyfriend's building me a house.

426
00:33:37,322 --> 00:33:40,192
- The doctor?
- No, the other boyfriend.

427
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,986
You have another boyfriend?

428
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:47,108
Yeah, I have lots of boyfriends.
I think it's best that way.

429
00:33:50,411 --> 00:33:54,405
- So you going to ask me out, or what?
- I thought...

430
00:33:54,572 --> 00:33:56,394
What about your boyfriends?

431
00:33:56,622 --> 00:34:00,452
They understand I'm a liberated woman.
How's Sunday?

432
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:03,918
- Sure.
- All right.

433
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:09,993
- We'll meet at your house?
- Yeah, we can't. It's being...

434
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,435
...deloused.

435
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,967
- There's a street carnival.
- Yeah.

436
00:34:14,128 --> 00:34:16,910
- On St. Clair.
- Okay, yeah, 4:00, then.

437
00:34:17,072 --> 00:34:20,847
- In front of the church.
- In front of the church.

438
00:34:21,488 --> 00:34:23,146
Okay.

439
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:25,068
Okay.

440
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:30,608
- Okay.
- Bye.

441
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:36,782
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

442
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:42,670
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

443
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,196
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

444
00:34:53,362 --> 00:34:55,784
I'm gonna kill that...

445
00:35:07,763 --> 00:35:10,763
Hey, I don't want to miss my bus now.

446
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:25,296
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

447
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:30,126
Look, a fun house!
I love fun houses.

448
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:34,702
Hey, if it's fun you want,
it's fun you get.

449
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:43,979
Where did you go?

450
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,444
Which one is you? Where are you?

451
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:50,705
Guess you'll just have
to kiss me and find out.

452
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,365
Come here.

453
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:54,225
Come here.

454
00:35:58,744 --> 00:36:00,599
Where you going?

455
00:36:03,063 --> 00:36:06,642
- I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch!
- Cosimo! What the...?

456
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,022
Want something, baby?

457
00:36:12,185 --> 00:36:14,770
- Jesus Christ, where's Mahlovic?
- Why?

458
00:36:14,936 --> 00:36:16,725
- Didn't you hear?
- What?

459
00:36:16,888 --> 00:36:21,045
- Cosimo broke out of the joint!
- There goes Cosimo!

460
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:24,787
- I'll kill you! Your mother's a whore!
- He's got a gun!

461
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,389
You sick bastard!

462
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:32,374
- You stole my Bellini!
- Wait, wait!

463
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:36,053
You puta! I'll spit on you!

464
00:36:36,214 --> 00:36:39,410
- I'll spit on all of you!
- Baby, please. Relax.

465
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:42,541
I got it all planned out.
We can all share.

466
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,532
You traitorous whore!

467
00:36:52,725 --> 00:36:55,442
Listen to me,
and listen to me good, okay?

468
00:36:55,605 --> 00:37:00,077
This job is mine! Anybody tries
to take it, I'm gonna kill them.

469
00:37:00,244 --> 00:37:04,466
I'm gonna kill anybody!
Anybody!

470
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:10,889
You okay?

471
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:12,881
- He get you good?
- No.

472
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,667
Just get away from me.

473
00:37:22,545 --> 00:37:24,170
Fuck him.

474
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:27,660
Leon.

475
00:37:28,241 --> 00:37:31,339
Leon, stakeout. Let's go.

476
00:37:31,504 --> 00:37:34,187
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for Leon.

477
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:37,199
- Leon ain't here.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.

478
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,628
I'll let him know you came by.

479
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,441
Shit. I'm Basil.

480
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:45,544
- What?
- Tell him Basil came by.

481
00:37:47,118 --> 00:37:48,874
I will.

482
00:37:49,038 --> 00:37:50,631
And you?

483
00:37:52,205 --> 00:37:54,147
Are...?

484
00:37:55,053 --> 00:37:58,249
Right. I'm Michelle.

485
00:37:58,412 --> 00:37:59,590
Leon's sister.

486
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:04,360
- I'm Basil.
- I know. You said it, like, three times.

487
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:10,624
That's a pretty ring.

488
00:38:11,147 --> 00:38:16,514
It's from my fiancé.
He's a salesman from the suburbs.

489
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:23,427
So...

490
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:25,154
...Basil...

491
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:28,070
...you wanna come in?

492
00:38:41,223 --> 00:38:44,223
This place is kind of stale,
don't you think?

493
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:48,351
Maybe we could, you know,
go to your place or something.

494
00:38:50,183 --> 00:38:55,517
- But my aunts will be there, so...
- So we'll stay in the living room.

495
00:38:55,686 --> 00:38:59,101
- No, I can't leave, really.
- Why not?

496
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:01,603
- Because.
- Because what?

497
00:39:01,764 --> 00:39:05,823
- I told another date to meet me here.
- Another date?!

498
00:39:05,921 --> 00:39:10,874
I cannot be dating just one guy.
It'd be like I'm married or something.

499
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,902
Dear God, woman!
All these other loves in your life.

500
00:39:15,072 --> 00:39:17,527
It's enough to make
a man feel impotent.

501
00:39:17,696 --> 00:39:20,478
If you ask me,
you should only be dating me.

502
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:23,006
I'll date whoever I please.

503
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:24,955
- Hello, Beddo.
- Hi, Carmela.

504
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,177
- Hi. This is my date.
- lf you don't mind.

505
00:39:29,342 --> 00:39:33,532
This is your date?
What is this, a joke?

506
00:39:34,558 --> 00:39:36,860
Excuse us, please.

507
00:39:37,022 --> 00:39:39,029
Another polka heading your way.

508
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:43,605
Here we go with something called
" My Little Darling."

509
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:50,132
I'm starting to think
we should just forget this job.

510
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,122
It's spinning out of control.

511
00:39:52,284 --> 00:39:55,251
This job's not spinning
out of control. You are.

512
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,267
Try getting into her apartment,
not her pants.

513
00:39:58,427 --> 00:40:02,388
I've been trying to get in
that apartment for two weeks.

514
00:40:02,556 --> 00:40:07,377
- She's a tease. I don't understand her.
- You're falling in love with her.

515
00:40:07,547 --> 00:40:12,435
- I don't fall in love, sweetheart.
- Oh, please.

516
00:40:12,603 --> 00:40:14,904
It's all over your face.

517
00:40:21,017 --> 00:40:23,439
Motherfucker.

518
00:40:25,242 --> 00:40:27,510
- Hands off, midget.
- What did you say?

519
00:40:27,673 --> 00:40:29,713
- She's with me tonight.
- Really?

520
00:40:29,881 --> 00:40:33,459
- Yeah, really.
- Well, he's with me.

521
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:36,817
Who is he, your pimp?

522
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:53,557
Come on, come on.
Come on. Want some, tough guy?

523
00:40:54,949 --> 00:40:57,185
What the fuck are you doing?

524
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:02,368
How could you lose your head over
this hussy? She's a maid, for chrissake!

525
00:41:05,765 --> 00:41:07,772
Wait, Carmela. Carmela.

526
00:41:07,941 --> 00:41:09,501
Carmela, wait a second!

527
00:41:09,669 --> 00:41:11,905
I'm sorry for the disturbance.

528
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:15,102
But I was enjoying an evening
with my girlfriend...

529
00:41:15,268 --> 00:41:18,302
...when that mob attacked me.
- Get out of here.

530
00:41:19,428 --> 00:41:22,527
Pero Mahlovic. 122 Ivanhoe.

531
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:26,816
- Sgt. Babitch, thank God you're here...
- Shut up.

532
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,929
The way you're going,
I should have them reserve you a cell.

533
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,256
You're such a kidder, Sgt. Babitch.
This is a very dangerous area.

534
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,038
Don't get smart with me,
you little prick.

535
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:43,710
- I will shit in you.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know.

536
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:47,488
I'll be seeing you around, champ.

537
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:51,840
Okay, then.

538
00:41:52,739 --> 00:41:55,674
Maybe at the mixer next week?

539
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:04,767
So that was very noble of you,
what you did tonight, you know.

540
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,516
No one's ever fought
over me that much.

541
00:42:07,682 --> 00:42:11,327
Well, I can't help it.
I guess I feel compelled.

542
00:42:14,434 --> 00:42:17,249
Why did that girl say
those things about me?

543
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,028
You know, she was jealous.

544
00:42:20,194 --> 00:42:21,917
Yeah.

545
00:42:24,354 --> 00:42:26,939
She was telling the truth.

546
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,944
I'm really just a maid.

547
00:42:31,105 --> 00:42:34,847
I thought because you were
a big salesman and everything...

548
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:37,759
...you wouldn't like me as much, so...

549
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:42,198
Please. We live in a democracy.
I don't care you're a maid.

550
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:45,500
You can be anything you want.

551
00:42:45,665 --> 00:42:47,901
I know. I just...

552
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:52,189
I don't know. I was just being silly.
I'm a silly liar.

553
00:42:52,353 --> 00:42:55,451
You're not silly.
You're not silly.

554
00:42:56,465 --> 00:42:59,781
- You know those old ladies I work for?
- Yeah.

555
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:02,822
They're going out of town on Tuesday.

556
00:43:02,993 --> 00:43:08,328
And I live over on the West Side,
and I was thinking you could...

557
00:43:09,201 --> 00:43:12,201
...come over for a nice,
romantic dinner.

558
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:16,297
I'd like that. I'd like that a lot.
What did you say?

559
00:43:16,465 --> 00:43:20,971
- That I'm off on Tuesday night and I...
- No, no, no. The old ladies.

560
00:43:21,136 --> 00:43:24,432
They're going to see
their mother in Steubenville.

561
00:43:24,593 --> 00:43:27,375
- You could come to my place.
- I could.

562
00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:30,864
Except, I have a date.

563
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,914
- You have a date?
- With my brothers.

564
00:43:36,721 --> 00:43:39,819
We bowl. In a bowling league.

565
00:43:40,496 --> 00:43:43,180
I like to bowl. Could I come?

566
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:47,367
It's a men's league.

567
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,091
Yeah.

568
00:43:50,704 --> 00:43:53,966
But we could go out another night.
This weekend.

569
00:43:54,129 --> 00:43:58,636
- One more beer!
- Give me the money and get out!

570
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,531
- Get the fuck out!
- Your mother's a whore!

571
00:44:03,696 --> 00:44:08,006
Carmela. Look at me.
Look at me for a second.

572
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:13,226
I like you.

573
00:44:14,673 --> 00:44:16,560
I like you a lot.

574
00:44:17,009 --> 00:44:18,831
I like you too.

575
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:21,807
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

576
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,793
No!

577
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:31,151
- No! Help! Help me!
- Give me the purse!

578
00:44:31,313 --> 00:44:33,484
Somebody help me!

579
00:44:46,224 --> 00:44:51,275
What a shitty way to go, huh?
Snatching a purse like a street punk.

580
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,597
- Something ain't right in the world.
- He had a tough life.

581
00:44:55,761 --> 00:44:58,478
His mother was a whore.

582
00:44:58,641 --> 00:45:01,936
Sorry, I can't go in.
Death scares him.

583
00:45:03,984 --> 00:45:06,254
Excuse me, gentlemen. It's time.

584
00:45:07,568 --> 00:45:11,824
We ain't done nothing to Cosimo
that he ain't done to somebody else.

585
00:45:11,985 --> 00:45:16,622
- Still don't make it right, I guess.
- He was a good friend to me.

586
00:45:16,785 --> 00:45:19,687
What are you talking about?
He was an asshole.

587
00:45:19,856 --> 00:45:22,507
He'd screw his mother
and not think twice.

588
00:45:22,672 --> 00:45:24,233
Watch your mouth.

589
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,811
It's not about him anyway.
Okay?

590
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:32,555
It's about the job.
We worked hard for this thing.

591
00:45:32,721 --> 00:45:35,852
This is our dream
we've been building here.

592
00:45:36,976 --> 00:45:40,272
What's your son gonna eat?
Your guilt?

593
00:45:40,785 --> 00:45:44,941
Who'll pay for that wedding reception?
The memory of Cosimo?

594
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:50,631
You're the poorest man I ever seen.
Did Cosimo ever help you out?

595
00:45:50,801 --> 00:45:54,150
And you. Are you gonna stay
a bum all your life?

596
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:58,827
This is about the job, plain and simple.
We all need it to survive.

597
00:45:58,993 --> 00:46:03,368
And there ain't a goddamn thing
we can do to change that.

598
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:06,695
How you doing?

599
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:10,729
It's Antwerp.

600
00:46:10,897 --> 00:46:13,548
The tools are ready for tonight.

601
00:46:13,713 --> 00:46:19,496
They're in a duffle bag in a dumpster
in the back of your building. Got it?

602
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:22,928
Why are you dressed like a priest?

603
00:46:23,217 --> 00:46:25,039
You're an idiot.

604
00:46:26,193 --> 00:46:27,622
You see that?

605
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:33,482
Babitch smells blood.
Good luck.

606
00:46:38,194 --> 00:46:41,161
- He's putting the screws on us.
- Don't worry.

607
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:44,526
We pull this job,
we'll all end up in the slammer.

608
00:46:44,689 --> 00:46:48,366
Don't worry about Babitch.
I'll take care of Babitch.

609
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:51,533
My place, 8:00.

610
00:46:51,698 --> 00:46:53,771
We need this.

611
00:46:54,641 --> 00:46:56,464
We need this.

612
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:13,967
What the fuck is this?

613
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,705
It's almost $ 16,000.

614
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:24,651
If something should happen
to go down tonight...

615
00:47:24,818 --> 00:47:27,240
...I'm hoping you'll forget...

616
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,579
...you ever saw us.

617
00:47:36,181 --> 00:47:38,996
Stupid bastard.
What the fuck are you doing?

618
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:42,059
Give me one good reason
not to bury your...!

619
00:47:42,229 --> 00:47:44,401
Give me one good reason.

620
00:47:44,565 --> 00:47:46,704
Babitch.

621
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:52,019
What do you make?
What are you making, 30,000 a year?

622
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:57,044
You live in a one-bathroom house, man.
You got four kids.

623
00:47:57,205 --> 00:48:01,940
You drive a Chevette. Your wife
rides the bus to work. For what?

624
00:48:02,102 --> 00:48:05,997
Just so you can protect some money
in some rich guy's safe?

625
00:48:07,126 --> 00:48:08,882
For what?

626
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:19,857
Look at me.

627
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:23,570
Nobody gets hurt.

628
00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:25,941
They won't get hurt.

629
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:39,058
Now get off my porch.

630
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:48,981
You know, you should get going.
Leon will be here any second.

631
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:54,162
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe it's
time we tell your brother about us.

632
00:48:54,327 --> 00:48:56,182
Tell him what?

633
00:48:56,343 --> 00:48:58,253
About us.

634
00:48:58,775 --> 00:49:01,874
- That we're in love.
- You crazy?

635
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,585
You think I'm gonna leave
my fiancé for you? Come on.

636
00:49:05,752 --> 00:49:08,686
- But we're in love.
- But he has a good job.

637
00:49:08,887 --> 00:49:11,887
He can get me out
of this neighborhood.

638
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:15,958
- I can get you out of here.
- And take me where? To jail?

639
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,454
What do you want, then?

640
00:49:18,616 --> 00:49:21,201
Your rich man?
Is that what you want?

641
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:24,629
- Is that gonna make you happy?
- Yeah.

642
00:49:26,744 --> 00:49:28,238
No.

643
00:49:29,751 --> 00:49:31,475
I don't know.

644
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,287
Well, what do you want?

645
00:49:36,152 --> 00:49:39,054
I want an honest man.

646
00:49:42,424 --> 00:49:44,082
You all right?

647
00:49:44,248 --> 00:49:45,841
I'm fine.

648
00:49:46,008 --> 00:49:49,652
- You want a drink?
- No. Thank you.

649
00:49:49,815 --> 00:49:51,277
What do you want?

650
00:49:51,669 --> 00:49:56,971
I need a favor. Only you can help me.
Will you watch him for me tonight?

651
00:49:57,141 --> 00:49:59,988
I don't want anything
to do with this anymore.

652
00:50:00,148 --> 00:50:04,522
I know you don't, but I don't
have a choice. I need the money.

653
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:06,513
For him.

654
00:50:06,675 --> 00:50:08,780
I'm not good with children.

655
00:50:08,947 --> 00:50:10,670
Listen to me.

656
00:50:11,314 --> 00:50:13,289
I need your help.

657
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:20,014
I think you're a good person, Rosalind.
You're one of the nicest people I know.

658
00:50:20,178 --> 00:50:22,381
And he needs that.

659
00:50:22,545 --> 00:50:24,269
And I think maybe...

660
00:50:24,433 --> 00:50:26,288
...you need that too.

661
00:50:37,808 --> 00:50:39,912
He's so tiny.

662
00:50:41,263 --> 00:50:42,855
Please.

663
00:50:45,614 --> 00:50:49,607
All right, but just for tonight.

664
00:50:49,774 --> 00:50:53,156
I put his things in that box.

665
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:01,481
If he cries, whistle.

666
00:51:01,644 --> 00:51:05,256
Just whistle to him. He...

667
00:51:10,092 --> 00:51:12,939
Don't worry. You'll see him tomorrow.

668
00:51:27,882 --> 00:51:31,874
If they don't get here in five minutes,
we go without them.

669
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,099
- I'm sorry. Sorry, I'm late.
- What's this? We don't need this.

670
00:51:36,563 --> 00:51:39,083
- It's not a prop. I was beaten.
- Beaten?

671
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,199
By the cops?

672
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:43,336
No. Oswald.
The guy we stole the camera from.

673
00:51:43,504 --> 00:51:46,667
I ran into him and his brother.
They broke my arm.

674
00:51:46,831 --> 00:51:49,678
- For stealing a camera?
- It was a good camera.

675
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:52,555
This is a disaster. What are those?

676
00:51:52,878 --> 00:51:55,081
Hydrocodone...

677
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:57,252
...bitar... Bitartrate.

678
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:01,412
They're bullshit! I've taken bunches,
and they don't do shit.

679
00:52:01,578 --> 00:52:04,709
You took bunches of these?
What's wrong with you?

680
00:52:04,874 --> 00:52:06,760
You wanna go into a coma?

681
00:52:06,921 --> 00:52:10,182
Are you telling me
I don't love my own son?

682
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:16,763
- He's out. Get him out of here.
- No, we can't do the job without him.

683
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:20,194
- He's useless! Look at him!
- I'll take him home.

684
00:52:20,357 --> 00:52:22,723
What? We've gotta leave for the job.

685
00:52:22,884 --> 00:52:25,404
I've been meaning
to tell you something.

686
00:52:25,571 --> 00:52:28,799
You're not cutting me out!
You or any of you.

687
00:52:28,962 --> 00:52:31,514
I'm clean enough to go to the cops.

688
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:36,120
I'm clean enough to go on this job,
aren't I? Aren't I?

689
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:40,509
- You wouldn't. You wouldn't dare.
- You try me.

690
00:52:41,246 --> 00:52:42,839
Jesus.

691
00:52:43,005 --> 00:52:48,405
- Where the fuck hell is Leon?!
- I'll cut you, boy. I'll cut you good!

692
00:52:48,572 --> 00:52:50,327
Wait! You don't understand.

693
00:52:50,491 --> 00:52:54,068
She was a beautiful flower,
and you plucked her.

694
00:52:54,234 --> 00:52:57,233
- I'll make you bleed.
- Listen to me. I love her.

695
00:52:57,401 --> 00:53:01,011
- No. No. No.
- We wanna get married.

696
00:53:01,176 --> 00:53:05,485
She's already engaged!
And not to a goddamned dirty thief!

697
00:53:05,655 --> 00:53:09,134
I'm not a thief anymore. I quit.
I'm done with all this.

698
00:53:09,302 --> 00:53:12,748
- What did you say?
- That's what I wanted to tell you.

699
00:53:12,084 --> 00:53:13,994
I'm not going tonight.

700
00:53:14,165 --> 00:53:16,402
- I'm in love with Michelle.
- Shit!

701
00:53:16,565 --> 00:53:17,994
I wanna marry her.

702
00:53:18,166 --> 00:53:21,516
I have to be an honest man to do that.

703
00:53:22,743 --> 00:53:25,078
So I got a job.

704
00:53:25,815 --> 00:53:28,085
Jesus-fucking-Christ.

705
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:30,485
This is a fucking fiasco.

706
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:39,991
If you still wanna kill me, I'll be
at the nickel factory on St. Clair.

707
00:53:40,156 --> 00:53:41,366
I start tonight.

708
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:09,166
This Bellini is starting to look
like a real fucking Kapuchnick.

709
00:54:09,334 --> 00:54:10,960
Watch your mouth!

710
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:15,318
Are you insane?
You trying to jinx us?

711
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,782
- Where are you going?
- To do the job.

712
00:54:17,944 --> 00:54:20,400
Can we do the job
with only four of us?

713
00:54:20,569 --> 00:54:24,344
At this point,
I don't give a good goddamn.

714
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:27,792
Wait a minute, here.

715
00:54:29,852 --> 00:54:32,340
Let's calm down
and get our minds right.

716
00:54:32,508 --> 00:54:36,404
Minds right? You're standing there
with a fucking butcher's knife.

717
00:54:38,654 --> 00:54:39,603
Hi.

718
00:54:42,975 --> 00:54:45,823
- The girl, she's here! Out the window.
- Who?

719
00:54:45,984 --> 00:54:50,076
- The chick, the maid. Out the window!
- Oh, my God!

720
00:54:53,506 --> 00:54:56,856
- I'm not going out there.
- It's the only way. Go.

721
00:54:57,026 --> 00:55:00,606
There's no place to go
once you get out except down!

722
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:04,258
Oh, my God!

723
00:55:04,421 --> 00:55:07,204
- Carmela.
- Pero?

724
00:55:07,365 --> 00:55:09,754
What a surprise.
How did you find...?

725
00:55:09,926 --> 00:55:12,742
How did you know where to find me?

726
00:55:14,447 --> 00:55:18,855
- Is this your place?
- No, this is much too modest for me.

727
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,479
This is my brother's place.

728
00:55:21,648 --> 00:55:26,537
My brother Mico.
He's an artist. He likes the squalor.

729
00:55:26,705 --> 00:55:29,607
- Hi, Mico. I'm Carmela.
- Hello, young woman.

730
00:55:29,777 --> 00:55:33,258
I'd shake your hands,
but I'm inspecting these bottles.

731
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:36,432
What's the matter?

732
00:55:36,594 --> 00:55:39,693
I'm afraid of...
I'm afraid of heights.

733
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:46,505
I wanted to tell you something.

734
00:55:46,675 --> 00:55:50,418
I quit the old ladies tonight. Yeah.

735
00:55:51,507 --> 00:55:55,250
- You'll find another job.
- You would've been so proud of me.

736
00:55:55,412 --> 00:55:59,373
I never told you this before,
but they were really terrible to me.

737
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:03,916
The things they would make me do.
They're incontinent, for God's sakes.

738
00:56:04,085 --> 00:56:09,836
But then I met you, and you made me
feel like I was worth something.

739
00:56:10,005 --> 00:56:14,130
I thought, " I have Pero. I don't have
to take this crap no more."

740
00:56:14,294 --> 00:56:18,189
So I called them "spoiled babies,"
and they fired me.

741
00:56:19,478 --> 00:56:21,518
They were so upset by it...

742
00:56:21,687 --> 00:56:25,549
...they canceled their stupid trip
to Steubenville tonight.

743
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:28,435
What? What?

744
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:33,172
Yeah, but then they went anyway
because they're stubborn old bats.

745
00:56:33,336 --> 00:56:37,264
And I kept the keys.
We should go back and wreck the place.

746
00:56:37,432 --> 00:56:40,083
My, my, my.
She didn't turn the keys in.

747
00:56:40,248 --> 00:56:42,550
Yeah, I heard her, Mico.

748
00:56:42,713 --> 00:56:47,253
You know what? You're very upset.
Maybe I should take you home.

749
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:52,087
I don't wanna interrupt your bowling.
Won't you miss Pero at bowling?

750
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:56,506
My arm's broken. I'm not going
to a fucking bowling match!

751
00:56:57,659 --> 00:57:01,434
Poor Mico.
He's so upset because he can't bowl.

752
00:57:16,825 --> 00:57:18,735
The window seems to be okay.

753
00:57:18,906 --> 00:57:23,663
If you have any more problems,
just give us a call. Hello.

754
00:57:24,794 --> 00:57:25,743
Okay.

755
00:57:25,914 --> 00:57:27,889
Am I dead?

756
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:31,857
There you go.
So where's the next window?

757
00:57:35,612 --> 00:57:39,541
Next stop, 25th Street. Ohio City.

758
00:57:44,222 --> 00:57:46,905
I like your brother Mico.

759
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:50,012
He's a little strange though.

760
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:52,189
He had...

761
00:57:52,863 --> 00:57:55,798
...syphilis as a baby.

762
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,550
Yeah.

763
00:57:59,968 --> 00:58:01,790
You know what?

764
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:07,229
Now that I think about it, I wish
I didn't have those keys on me.

765
00:58:07,393 --> 00:58:10,460
If anything were to happen
while they were away...

766
00:58:10,626 --> 00:58:13,082
...those old crows,
they would blame me.

767
00:58:13,251 --> 00:58:17,507
How could they blame you?
You're a small girl. That's nonsense.

768
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:20,799
- Could you do me a huge favor?
- Sure.

769
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:23,714
Could you take the keys
on your way home...

770
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:28,797
...and drop them off with the janitor?
I would just sleep so much better.

771
00:58:28,965 --> 00:58:33,025
But how could they blame you?
You're a small girl. That's...

772
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:37,052
Oh, no. Pero, they're not here.
Oh, my God.

773
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:40,354
I think I left them in the front door.
Oh, my God!

774
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:43,618
Someone will rip that place off.
We gotta go back.

775
00:58:43,783 --> 00:58:45,572
- Driver!
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

776
00:58:45,736 --> 00:58:48,606
Hold on a second.
Let me take a look.

777
00:58:48,777 --> 00:58:52,355
- No, they're not in there.
- Look, there they are.

778
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:59,814
- Thank you. They would have killed me.
- No wonder you couldn't find them.

779
00:58:59,978 --> 00:59:03,361
Look at all this lipstick.
One for every boyfriend?

780
00:59:03,531 --> 00:59:05,222
No.

781
00:59:06,763 --> 00:59:09,579
Well, there's only one from now on.

782
00:59:11,807 --> 00:59:14,905
Don't worry. You sleep good tonight.

783
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,754
And I'll take the keys back. Okay?

784
00:59:17,918 --> 00:59:19,926
- Yeah.
- All right.

785
00:59:20,094 --> 00:59:22,712
You're always so good to me.

786
00:59:22,878 --> 00:59:25,977
No, you are. You're the best.

787
00:59:35,453 --> 00:59:38,835
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Did you get the keys?

788
00:59:39,101 --> 00:59:42,548
I couldn't get near them.
We gotta go in the old way.

789
00:59:42,716 --> 00:59:46,938
- But we're two hours behind.
- So let's move, then. Let's go.

790
01:00:05,914 --> 01:00:08,631
Motherfucker!

791
01:00:09,562 --> 01:00:11,350
Don't come down! Don't...

792
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,610
- I can't swim!
- Goddamn!

793
01:00:18,777 --> 01:00:21,046
- I can't swim!
- Come on.

794
01:00:22,169 --> 01:00:23,663
Goddamn toothless...

795
01:00:26,168 --> 01:00:29,780
- Put your goddamn pants on.
- I'll catch pneumonia.

796
01:00:29,944 --> 01:00:33,490
Come on, let's go.
Quit messing around. Let's go.

797
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,896
You ready?

798
01:00:57,014 --> 01:01:00,396
- Can you get it?
- No. Not yet.

799
01:01:00,566 --> 01:01:02,354
- Higher.
- Wait.

800
01:01:03,221 --> 01:01:04,650
Just a few more inches.

801
01:01:04,821 --> 01:01:06,609
One, two...

802
01:01:08,981 --> 01:01:10,955
I got it.

803
01:01:14,644 --> 01:01:17,513
- I think he bit off his tongue.
- No.

804
01:01:17,684 --> 01:01:20,269
No, it's right there.

805
01:01:22,419 --> 01:01:24,208
You want one of these?

806
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:30,706
All right, we're losing time.
Let's go. Come on!

807
01:01:57,968 --> 01:01:59,397
Shit!

808
01:01:59,568 --> 01:02:00,997
Hot!

809
01:02:01,616 --> 01:02:03,852
Shit! Hot!

810
01:02:04,624 --> 01:02:06,446
Seems sturdy.

811
01:02:06,671 --> 01:02:08,165
I don't know.

812
01:02:09,054 --> 01:02:11,289
We should test it.

813
01:02:11,452 --> 01:02:13,044
Test it?

814
01:02:35,757 --> 01:02:38,210
- Chill, Riley! Chill!
- Go on. Go on.

815
01:02:51,011 --> 01:02:53,628
- Okay. Go.
- I can't.

816
01:02:53,794 --> 01:02:56,181
What? What do you mean, you can't?

817
01:02:56,352 --> 01:02:58,139
He's afraid of heights.

818
01:03:03,483 --> 01:03:05,271
You have to.

819
01:03:09,431 --> 01:03:11,535
I can't.

820
01:03:13,941 --> 01:03:17,103
Stop moving around, Toto. Stop it.

821
01:03:18,097 --> 01:03:20,038
Get your hands off my face!

822
01:03:20,209 --> 01:03:23,502
Stop moving around
like a fucking monkey.

823
01:03:23,822 --> 01:03:25,447
I'm scared.

824
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:37,151
Get him off me! Get him off me!

825
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:41,058
Oh, my God! Whatever about my ass
being all over his lap.

826
01:03:41,219 --> 01:03:44,380
You cause enough embarrassment
to last a year.

827
01:03:44,545 --> 01:03:46,715
When we went to your mother's...

828
01:03:46,879 --> 01:03:49,365
- My shorts are coming down.
- Shut up.

829
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:55,062
And who came in? Your cousin,
Clarence. You were making eyes at him!

830
01:03:55,226 --> 01:03:57,591
That's so sick.
It's your own cousin!

831
01:03:57,752 --> 01:04:00,336
- What about Eddie?
- I'm going back inside.

832
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:04,941
- lf you cause a scene, I'm leaving.
- We should stay out here all night!

833
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:07,855
- Screw you!
- Where are you going? Come back.

834
01:04:09,201 --> 01:04:11,654
Get him off me! Get him off me!

835
01:04:13,486 --> 01:04:15,459
Go. Go.

836
01:04:17,452 --> 01:04:20,766
Next time I say to keep your pants on,
keep them on!

837
01:04:20,938 --> 01:04:22,911
It's this one.

838
01:04:24,935 --> 01:04:28,162
- It's this one. It's this one.
- Get the thingy.

839
01:04:49,784 --> 01:04:50,732
Come on.

840
01:05:00,752 --> 01:05:06,084
Oh, jeez. This place is like a palace.

841
01:05:17,097 --> 01:05:21,471
All right. It wasn't that heavy.
Stop being so goddamn dramatic.

842
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:26,495
This is it. Guys, come on.
Come here. Hurry up.

843
01:05:26,663 --> 01:05:29,412
We can drill a pilot hole right there.

844
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:46,076
This is it.

845
01:05:55,587 --> 01:05:57,659
- Fuck!
- Shit!

846
01:06:03,778 --> 01:06:06,680
Put this in.
Plug it up. Plug it up.

847
01:06:09,569 --> 01:06:14,008
- What a bizarre wall.
- You hit the plumbing, asshole.

848
01:06:15,456 --> 01:06:18,107
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

849
01:06:38,877 --> 01:06:43,545
Ms. Wiener, I'm in the apartment now,
and everything looks fine.

850
01:06:45,148 --> 01:06:48,725
Wait. There's some water
on the floor or something.

851
01:06:50,522 --> 01:06:52,595
Goddamn! Oh, fuck!

852
01:06:52,762 --> 01:06:55,609
No, it's the cat, Ms. Wiener.

853
01:06:56,634 --> 01:07:00,621
No, the cat peed on the floor again.

854
01:07:00,787 --> 01:07:04,426
No, I will not. No, I'm the janitor.
I'm not your maid.

855
01:07:04,589 --> 01:07:08,380
What's that? Yeah, a very nice
young man returned the keys...

856
01:07:08,551 --> 01:07:11,961
...for the girl
about three hours ago. Yeah.

857
01:07:12,129 --> 01:07:15,027
Yeah, okay.
I'll leave them right here. Good.

858
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,722
Yeah, I'll lock up.

859
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:20,049
Yeah, okay. Bye, Ms. Wiener.

860
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:21,993
Bitch.

861
01:07:22,162 --> 01:07:25,354
Goddamn fucking cat.
I can't believe this shit.

862
01:07:25,517 --> 01:07:27,521
Crazy fucking people.

863
01:07:30,469 --> 01:07:32,539
Okay, okay...

864
01:07:32,706 --> 01:07:36,890
- You miserable son of a bitch.
- I had to return them for an alibi.

865
01:07:37,051 --> 01:07:41,168
- lf I kept them, she could finger me.
- You sold us out for a woman?

866
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:44,775
They would've had her arrested
if the joint got robbed.

867
01:07:44,943 --> 01:07:49,376
So we had to crawl in like "aminals"?
We wasted half the night.

868
01:07:49,544 --> 01:07:52,703
Look. What's done is done.

869
01:07:53,026 --> 01:07:56,795
And all the arguing in the world
is not gonna change it.

870
01:07:56,956 --> 01:08:00,431
Now let's just shut up
and get out the Antwerp.

871
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:31,968
Come on. Come on. It's giving.

872
01:08:32,134 --> 01:08:35,642
It's been giving
for the last 40 minutes.

873
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:41,393
I need a breather, man.

874
01:08:42,965 --> 01:08:47,530
So how much do you
really think is in that safe?

875
01:08:47,693 --> 01:08:49,992
Well...

876
01:08:50,153 --> 01:08:55,361
...Cosimo said that the old man swore
to him that it was at least 300 grand.

877
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:59,988
Goddamn. That's a lot of money.

878
01:09:00,154 --> 01:09:03,793
A person could live several lives
with that kind of money.

879
01:09:05,648 --> 01:09:09,508
I'm gonna buy a big loft
with my share of the loot.

880
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:12,681
And one for my boy.

881
01:09:13,069 --> 01:09:17,158
I'll pay them off so he never has
to work a day in his life.

882
01:09:17,643 --> 01:09:20,457
I'm gonna move to the country.

883
01:09:21,513 --> 01:09:24,894
Houses there are so far apart
you can sit on your porch...

884
01:09:25,064 --> 01:09:27,845
...and read the newspaper
in your underwear.

885
01:09:29,862 --> 01:09:33,341
I'm gonna buy my wife
a new gravestone.

886
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:36,514
You know, one that stands up.

887
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:41,756
With little angels carved. In marble.

888
01:09:42,368 --> 01:09:44,701
So, what are you gonna do?

889
01:09:46,751 --> 01:09:49,652
I think I'm gonna build a gym.

890
01:09:49,821 --> 01:09:53,333
I know everybody thinks
I'm not much of a fighter...

891
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:57,393
...but I think I'd be a good teacher,
you know, for the kids.

892
01:09:57,562 --> 01:10:00,877
Man, I can't wait another minute.

893
01:10:02,775 --> 01:10:06,090
Come on, guys,
let's go get the goddamn loot.

894
01:10:06,934 --> 01:10:11,056
Toto, get us some water.
It's like a jungle in here.

895
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,772
All right, come on.

896
01:10:18,321 --> 01:10:20,523
Something's happening.

897
01:10:24,271 --> 01:10:26,092
It's giving.

898
01:10:27,853 --> 01:10:30,241
Shit. Here it comes.

899
01:10:33,674 --> 01:10:35,015
Here it comes.

900
01:10:45,701 --> 01:10:47,871
Yes! Yes. Yes.

901
01:10:54,466 --> 01:10:57,400
Good, sweet Jesus.
How did you get in there?

902
01:10:57,570 --> 01:11:00,188
I'm getting the water.

903
01:11:00,354 --> 01:11:02,209
My God.

904
01:11:03,457 --> 01:11:04,919
It's the kitchen.

905
01:11:05,089 --> 01:11:07,707
- The kitchen?
- What are you saying?

906
01:11:07,873 --> 01:11:10,175
It's the kitchen!

907
01:11:12,192 --> 01:11:16,763
Cosimo said the wall was in the
living room. This is the living room.

908
01:11:16,928 --> 01:11:22,198
How can this be the living room
if that's the fucking kitchen?!

909
01:11:22,815 --> 01:11:28,696
What do you think,
it's in the fucking closet?

910
01:11:32,639 --> 01:11:35,705
- Shit.
- You moron.

911
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:38,391
You unbelievable idiot moron.

912
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:43,379
How was I supposed to know
they had two living rooms?

913
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:46,517
- Who has two living rooms?
- You should've looked.

914
01:11:46,685 --> 01:11:50,198
You should've looked
while we were busting our asses.

915
01:11:50,365 --> 01:11:53,212
- I got the water!
- Unbelievable hack.

916
01:11:53,372 --> 01:11:55,379
You poser. You've killed us.

917
01:11:55,548 --> 01:11:57,752
- Me?
- Yes, you. You've killed us.

918
01:11:57,916 --> 01:12:02,454
What are you talking about? We move
the crank in here and do it again.

919
01:12:02,619 --> 01:12:06,710
It's 3 a.m. We'd never get
through the wall and crack the safe.

920
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:09,592
- We could drill fast.
- It's impossible!

921
01:12:09,755 --> 01:12:12,689
We'd drill our way
into the joint. It's over.

922
01:12:13,115 --> 01:12:17,238
We can still do it.
We can still do it.

923
01:12:17,594 --> 01:12:19,001
I'm telling you.

924
01:12:19,162 --> 01:12:22,871
- Leon, help me.
- We'll never make it, man.

925
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:29,137
Hey, Toto. Come on.

926
01:12:31,417 --> 01:12:36,272
God, I needed that money.
I needed it so bad. You've ruined us.

927
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:40,663
What are you talking about?
I did everything. From the start.

928
01:12:40,824 --> 01:12:46,671
I got the Bellini. I planned the job.
I wooed the girl. I paid off Babitch.

929
01:12:46,839 --> 01:12:51,062
I did everything. I gave everything
I had for this! Everything!

930
01:12:52,022 --> 01:12:56,146
You know what we did? We believed.

931
01:12:56,311 --> 01:12:59,474
You gave us hope
with your fucking Bellini.

932
01:12:59,653 --> 01:13:03,547
And then you ripped our hearts out,
and you smashed them.

933
01:13:03,716 --> 01:13:05,504
What is that? What?

934
01:13:05,668 --> 01:13:10,457
Christ, I'm more broke now than
when I started this fucking thing!

935
01:13:10,627 --> 01:13:13,790
I wish I'd never met you.
Any of you!

936
01:13:15,202 --> 01:13:18,268
Jesus, I think I'm gonna be sick.

937
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,495
I'm sorry.

938
01:13:30,496 --> 01:13:33,692
I got a kid, for chrissake.
What am I gonna do?

939
01:13:33,856 --> 01:13:38,427
Sweet Jesus.
Hey, guys, take a look at this.

940
01:13:38,591 --> 01:13:41,656
It's a cookie-jar stash.

941
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:47,125
There must be 1000 bucks here.
Not a bad consolation prize, huh?

942
01:13:47,294 --> 01:13:49,301
Let me see that.

943
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:04,663
It's delicious.

944
01:14:04,827 --> 01:14:08,023
The girl must have made it
before they fired her.

945
01:14:08,186 --> 01:14:13,520
I'm gonna heat this up.
At least we'll eat good before we go.

946
01:14:21,976 --> 01:14:24,626
The pilot light must be out.

947
01:14:25,751 --> 01:14:27,693
Got a match?

948
01:14:30,454 --> 01:14:33,356
Wait a minute. Does anybody smell...?

949
01:14:42,453 --> 01:14:46,991
I think it's probably a good idea
if we don't see each other anymore.

950
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:57,324
Wait a second.

951
01:15:00,466 --> 01:15:03,280
I gotta give you your cut of the take.

952
01:15:23,538 --> 01:15:26,503
It's for your wife. Get her home.

953
01:15:34,953 --> 01:15:36,381
Thanks.

954
01:15:46,049 --> 01:15:48,152
What are you gonna do?

955
01:15:49,182 --> 01:15:51,636
It just wasn't our night.

956
01:15:53,055 --> 01:15:56,636
I better get home
and apologize to my sister.

957
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:02,619
Be well, old man.

958
01:16:05,672 --> 01:16:08,129
If you get any more Bellinis...

959
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,556
...just give me a call.

960
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:25,302
So...

961
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,431
...where are you going?

962
01:16:33,598 --> 01:16:35,093
I don't know.

963
01:16:35,454 --> 01:16:39,843
Get cleaned up,
and maybe I'll go see Carmela.

964
01:16:41,094 --> 01:16:43,474
That's a good idea.

965
01:16:44,472 --> 01:16:47,211
She's a nice girl.

966
01:16:47,627 --> 01:16:49,028
Yeah.

967
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:56,762
I'll see...

968
01:16:58,143 --> 01:17:01,674
Hey, this safe...

969
01:17:01,903 --> 01:17:05,977
...this job, it's nothing.

970
01:17:06,141 --> 01:17:08,205
It's just money.

971
01:17:09,137 --> 01:17:12,386
Money comes, money goes.

972
01:17:13,885 --> 01:17:16,492
I'm an old man, I know.

973
01:17:17,741 --> 01:17:20,284
But to have someone...

974
01:17:22,202 --> 01:17:24,777
...somebody to walk with...

975
01:17:25,644 --> 01:17:27,708
...at your side...

976
01:17:29,117 --> 01:17:31,051
...is everything.

977
01:17:32,973 --> 01:17:35,233
She's a nice girl.

978
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,181
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

979
01:17:40,181 --> 01:17:50,181
