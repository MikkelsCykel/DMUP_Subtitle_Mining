1
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,360
I can't remember
the last time this thing worked.

2
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,960
Son, you got a gift.

3
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,600
Your man, on the other hand...

4
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,520
Do me a favor,
tonight when you close...

5
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,840
...double check and make sure
everything is locked.

6
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,760
Had a few things walk out of here.

7
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,880
Now, you know, Soul Joe,
I'll never steal nothing from you.

8
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,480
After everything you did for me?

9
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,760
Just keep a lookout.

10
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,400
Damn.

11
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,360
Rob from the rich
and give to myself.

12
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,200
- Lee John, what the hell you doing?
- Getting my money on.

13
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,120
- Man, we putting that back.
- No, we not!

14
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,840
Put it back! It's going back in.

15
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,640
You gonna get us fired?

16
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,960
Hey!

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,080
No...

18
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,760
That's my TV!

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,760
Somebody gonna get pregnant
tonight. That's what's up.

20
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,280
Come on, Rell, man,
that's my new joint, man.

21
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,640
- You get the job?
- Do it look like I got the job?

22
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,720
I got us a job.

23
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,640
Where?

24
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
You need to take the stickers off.
You ain't even never got no weed.

25
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,760
Twenty-four-inch
chrome-plated rims.

26
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,440
Twenty-four-inch chrome plate,
real deal.

27
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,280
Custom leather seats.

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,640
Custom, cush leather seat.

29
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,920
Ten chairs. Twelve-hundred dollars
apiece.

30
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,640
You do the maths.

31
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,920
You have 24 hours.

32
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,000
Ticktock, gunshot.

33
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,400
Bullet. Bullet.

34
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,760
Bullet, bullet, bullet.

35
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,200
You think that's 24 hours from now...

36
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,280
...or from when he said it
10 minutes ago?

37
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,440
Hey, is that Jamaican time
or American time?

38
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,480
<i>What is this, man,
Pimp My Wheelchair?</i>

39
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,840
What this is,
is us getting paid $3000...

40
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,160
...to deliver these wheelchairs
across town.

41
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
What the hell was that?

42
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
What the hell?
Why you run the light?

43
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,440
Police!

44
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,080
I ain't going back to jail, man!
I ain't going back to no jail!

45
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,360
We've got a beige van
going over Fourth Avenue.

46
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,440
Police, black man, wheelchair?
That's jail!

47
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,920
All right, don't panic. Just roll.

48
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,560
You didn't lock the back latch!
We're losing chairs!

49
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,480
Oh, man!

50
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,960
It's not my van!

51
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,080
This is my cousin Doug's.
With the one eye.

52
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,320
This is his van.

53
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,560
He said he fixed it!

54
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,840
Yo! Yo, those are our chairs, man!
They're taking our chairs!

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,880
Don't worry about them chairs,
just worry about them cops.

56
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,560
They coming on us! They still on us!

57
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,080
They still on us, man.
Turn right here, right here.

58
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,760
Watch out! Watch out!

59
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,000
What had happened,
it was me and LeeJohn.

60
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,920
- We was driving...
- Shut up.

61
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,440
- Your Honor! I was...
- Yo, wait... You better shut up.

62
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,800
Wouldn't be in this damn mess
if it wasn't for you.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,080
- For me?
- Yeah.

64
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,160
Wait a minute, now it's my fault
because I was trying to help you out?

65
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,960
- Shut the hell up.
- The both of you, shut up!

66
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,720
Mr. Jackson...

67
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,840
...six months ago you were caught
shoplifting at a Stop and Shop...

68
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,160
...with a box full of Ding Dongs...

69
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,040
...and a six-pack of
banana-strawberry Boone's Farm.

70
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,960
Your Honor, it was Goober Grape.

71
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,760
When the arresting officer
searched you...

72
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,040
...he found a $20 bill
in your pocket.

73
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,480
Why didn't you pay for it?

74
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,520
Because this dude named Bo Peep
was on my ass about $20 and I...

75
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,000
And you, Mr. Washington.

76
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,600
You scored higher on your SAT than
anyone in your graduating class...

77
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,120
...and yet you've been
in three juvenile detention centers...

78
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,280
...twice on house arrest
and once on probation.

79
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,720
A perfect example of potential
with no purpose.

80
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,400
Zero.

81
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,880
Anything either of you
have to say for yourself?

82
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,600
If I go to jail,
they're gonna make me a woman.

83
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,160
LeeJohn Jackson has been shuffled
from one foster home to another.

84
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,720
Durell Washington is the product of a
single-parented home, Your Honor...

85
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,000
...never having the benefit
of a father figure.

86
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,840
Your Honor, the youth of our city
need to be given a chance.

87
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,280
Yes, the youth do.

88
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,880
But with respect, Your Honor,
these are grown-ass men.

89
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,920
- What is your problem?
- You need a hobby.

90
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,640
You need another hobby
besides sending black men to jail.

91
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,840
- I'll send any man to jail I want.
- Order in the court!

92
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,640
- You better watch your language.
- My bad, Your Honor.

93
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,920
Given the record that Mr. Jackson
and Mr. Washington have earned...

94
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,520
...I have every right to send the both
of you to jail for a very long time.

95
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,600
- Come on, man...
- But I'm not gonna do that.

96
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,200
Now, I've decided to forgo
any possibility of a jail sentence...

97
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,400
...under the condition that the both
of you perform community service.

98
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,880
- I love my community.
- I got no problem with that.

99
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,600
Five thousand hours
of community service!

100
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,960
Five thousand hours?

101
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,600
Goodbye, and good riddance.

102
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,640
- Do we get paid for this?
- I ain't doing no 5000 hours, man!

103
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,720
I ain't doing no 5000 hours. Get off!

104
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,080
- I said, let go! Hell, no!
- Five thousand...

105
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,760
Attica! Attica!

106
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,920
Get them out of here.

107
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,680
All right, Ish Kabibble.

108
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,040
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,160
I know. I know you sorry.

110
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,280
You know how I know?

111
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,240
Because you was sorry
in kindergarten...

112
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,360
...you was sorry in elementary,
and super sorry in junior high.

113
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,960
Would've been sorry in high school,
but you never went.

114
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,680
I went to high school.
I just didn't graduate.

115
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,400
I hate you.

116
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,120
Yeah? Well, I love you.
It could always be worse, Rell.

117
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,760
Worse? What could be worse?

118
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,920
Yo, Rell, you got to walk with me
over here, man.

119
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,600
Don't leave me hanging like this.

120
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,480
- That's your problem.
- Rell...

121
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,040
That's your problem.

122
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,880
Don't do it.

123
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,640
Yo, Blahka.

124
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,920
Blahk? Open up, Blahk.
Hey, what's up?

125
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,680
My favorite buffalo soldier.
Man, we heard you was in the region.

126
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,280
Myself and Durell.
Durell is gonna come over... Durell?

127
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,480
I'm done with criminal activity.

128
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,560
Man, he ain't gonna come over
right now, because he's preoccupied.

129
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,400
But listen, man, we was looking for
you and searching high and low, baby.

130
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,080
Twenty-four hours was up
72 hours ago.

131
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,600
But you, I know, but...
What had happened was that...

132
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,000
Ten chairs. Twelve-hundred dollars
apiece.

133
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,080
You do the maths.

134
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,560
Ticktock, gunshot.

135
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Blahka?

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,040
Blahka!

137
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,000
- Who is it?
- It's me.

138
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,160
Me who? It ain't nobody that pay bills
in here. Say your name.

139
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,720
Omunique, open the door.

140
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,000
You got a damn peephole.

141
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,160
What you want?

142
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,760
Not you.

143
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,120
I came to walk my son
to the bus stop.

144
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,560
Yo, move back.

145
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,120
- Now, where's my money?
- I ain't giving you nothing.

146
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,960
- Oh, really?
- I gave you money Friday.

147
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,240
- What you do with it?
- I bought gum.

148
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Don't make me file
these court papers, Rell.

149
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,760
Don't make me do it.

150
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,440
Don't make me put the man in
the middle. I promise you I will.

151
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,240
Rethink it. Dig in them pockets
and pull out something.

152
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,720
That's what I thought.

153
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,360
- Might as well be pimping. Here.
- Give me...

154
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,400
Forty dollars?
What I'm supposed to do with this?

155
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
What you always do with it.
Complain about it, then go spend it.

156
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,120
You know what? You come here
every day with the same thing:

157
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,440
Nothing. He don't eat air.

158
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
Well, learn how to cook.

159
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,160
We got bills up in this house.

160
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,040
Why don't you contribute, pay,
do something?

161
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,760
Hey, Dad.

162
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,320
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

163
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,440
Rell? Come say hello to your father.

164
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,960
Girl, don't play with me.

165
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,920
Hey, hey, hey. What's up, man?

166
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,880
- How you doing?
- I'm doing good.

167
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,000
What's up with this hair?
Look like a S.O.S. Pad.

168
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,400
Tell your mama you want your hair
done as good as she do her clients.

169
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,680
And you tell your father he should
either contribute to my business...

170
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,720
...or stay out of it.

171
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,760
Shit.

172
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,680
I put in some work.

173
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,600
What up, little gangster?

174
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,600
Hey, hey, man.
Watch your mouth around my son.

175
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,160
- Why you sweating?
- It's hot in here.

176
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,120
I've been trying to say
it's a little stuffy up in here.

177
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,480
Rell, go get your backpack
for school. And comb your hair.

178
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,200
Hey, what are you doing?

179
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,440
Fixing your raggedy-ass thermostat
before my son dies of heat stroke.

180
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,480
Anyway...

181
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,040
I'm thinking about moving down South
to Atlanta with my grandmother.

182
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,320
You out your rabid-ass mind?
You ain't taking my son nowhere.

183
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,240
What you say?

184
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,200
Listen, my lease is up on the shop.

185
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,520
The owner got somebody
to pay a year in advance...

186
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,760
...so unless you got $ 17,342,
I gotta go.

187
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,720
Why you can't do hair out
your house like you been doing?

188
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,040
I can't run an entire salon
out of my house, Durell.

189
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,280
I got equipment, I got employees.

190
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,600
You got clients.

191
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,360
And I got goals.

192
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,480
Durell, I was two stylists away
from filling up my shop.

193
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,600
I'm tired of struggling.

194
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,240
I'm tired of our son
watching me struggle.

195
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,240
I don't want to take Rell away from
you, but I gotta do what's best for him.

196
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,520
And I gotta do what's best for me.

197
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,680
What's best for him
is to be with his father.

198
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,840
Really?

199
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,160
What about what's best for me?
Or does that even matter to you, ever?

200
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,720
No, it don't.

201
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,400
Because you not my responsibility
no more, he is.

202
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,200
Why are you always doing this to me?

203
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,040
I'm not raising the next man's kid,
I'm raising your son!

204
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,640
- Your son.
- You keep your ass out of it, okay?

205
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,240
Stop disrespecting my clients!

206
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,560
Sit there and worry about getting
your hair burnt.

207
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,240
What you need to do is stand up
there and burn a job out.

208
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,520
That's what you need.

209
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,080
- Stop.
- I'll pull a track out.

210
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,480
You ain't gonna pull out nothing.
Not up in here, you ain't. I'm good.

211
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,280
Your client's disrespecting me.

212
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,400
Don't talk about her weave.
That's her hair.

213
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,560
Listen, I'm asking you right...

214
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,160
Baby, hey.

215
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,800
Come give me a hug.
You got your bags?

216
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,600
You gonna have a good day
at school?

217
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,360
Give me a soul kiss?

218
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,440
- I love you.
- Love you too.

219
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,520
You think he can fix the cable too?

220
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,680
No, why don't you fix the cable?

221
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,000
How you gonna ask another man
to fix the cable?

222
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,240
He fixed the air.

223
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,960
Old boy up there, he don't
be messing with you, do he?

224
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,120
No, he just sleeps all day, you know,
since the cable stopped working.

225
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,520
Yeah. Man, your mama
sure know how to pick them.

226
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,560
She picked you,
I mean, you weren't so bad.

227
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,040
What you mean, I wasn't so bad?
Don't be pushing on me, boy.

228
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,800
- You know I'm B-mo's finest?
- Yes.

229
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,480
Am I B-mo's finest? All right, then.
Let it be known. All right.

230
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,080
Okay, okay.

231
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,880
You ever finish that report on what
you want to be when you grow up?

232
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,040
Yeah, I wanna be
like LeBron James.

233
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,760
You and every other little kid
in the 'hood.

234
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,600
Just in case that don't work...

235
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,280
...not saying it won't, but if it don't,
you gotta have a plan B.

236
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,120
What's a plan B?

237
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,880
A plan B is like a backup plan
if your original plan don't work.

238
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,880
Okay. So, what's your plan B?

239
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,160
My plan B...

240
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,440
My plan B is...

241
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,440
...to make sure your peanut head
get on the bus on time every morning.

242
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,600
That's my plan A and B.

243
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,000
Dad, you need a plan C.

244
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,520
You need to get on that bus.

245
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,520
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

246
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,440
I know what my plan B is.

247
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,480
- What?
- It's to be just like you.

248
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,960
I want you to promise me something.

249
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,680
Promise me you'll be better than me.

250
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,360
- I want you to promise something too.
- What?

251
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,200
Please don't let Mom take me
to Atlanta.

252
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,800
Please?

253
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,320
Oh, man, don't worry about that, man.
Ain't nobody gonna take you nowhere.

254
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,640
All right, man.
Go on and make your bus.

255
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,600
Yeah, come on, Rell!

256
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,520
Get your lazy ass up.
Let's go to work!

257
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,240
Let's go, Rell, come on!
Get the molasses out your ass!

258
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,120
Seventeen thousand, three hundred
and forty-two dollars in a month?

259
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,320
Because she wants you
to pay her bills?

260
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,120
Selfish.

261
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,440
And she know damn well
I can't leave the state.

262
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,880
By the time I see my son again, he
gonna be graduated from high school.

263
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,840
There's always college.

264
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,800
You really don't care
somebody's trying to kill us?

265
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,760
Us? They're trying to kill you.

266
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,080
Now, this was your idea, remember?
I don't even know these dudes.

267
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,480
You got your ass in it,
you can get your ass out of it.

268
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,240
Matter of fact, all I'm really worried
about is getting 17 G's...

269
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,280
...so my son don't have
to move to Atlanta.

270
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,400
You see that whole conversation there
that came out of your mouth?

271
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,920
Selfish.

272
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,800
Yeah, that's me. Selfish.

273
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,800
Crenshaw. Crenshaw.

274
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
What?

275
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
May I have three slices of lemon...

276
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,960
...four packs of sugar
and a tall glass of ice water?

277
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,240
With no attitude.

278
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,640
So one lemonade?

279
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,400
Well, let me rephrase it for you...

280
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,200
...I know you was in special ed
and I'm gonna forgive you...

281
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,800
...but I would like
three free slices of lemon...

282
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,000
...four free packs of sugar
and a tall glass of free ice water.

283
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,040
And it's called baby hair
because it's for babies.

284
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,440
You know what? I got some more
baby hair, wanna see it?

285
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,520
You shouldn't have
never messed with that girl.

286
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,680
Durell, get down.

287
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,120
It's Blahka, man.

288
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,880
- It's Blahka.
- So?

289
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,240
I know where
we can get the money from.

290
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,080
- Who?
- Mordecai.

291
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,840
He gives out loans at a massage shop
in the west side of Baltimore.

292
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,080
I can get the money I need and
you can get the money you need.

293
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,720
Hi, how are you?

294
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,240
You speak my language.
We're here to see Mordecai.

295
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,440
Our Swedish massages
start at 49.50.

296
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,320
We need to talk to Mordecai,
we trying to get a loan here.

297
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,640
So, what sort of massage will it be?

298
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,320
Didn't you hear me?

299
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,160
Let me speak to you over here
for a minute.

300
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
That's the code, man. Damn, relax.

301
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,920
We came here to get a loan.

302
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,760
And I'm getting a massage.

303
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,880
- Are you coming or not?
- Not.

304
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,520
Let's go, baby.

305
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,480
You like Minnie Riperton?
I love Minnie Riperton.

306
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,040
- Yo, LeeJohn?
- I save that for special occasions.

307
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,400
Hey, LeeJohn?

308
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,920
Hey, yo, LeeJohn, we need
to find Mordecai and get out of here.

309
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,440
God.

310
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,160
Hey, man, let's go.

311
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,240
My name is LeeJohn Jackson,
and I'm a Leo.

312
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,000
King of the jungle.

313
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,880
Do you wanna know my name?

314
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,520
I just don't want to know your name,
I want you to whisper it in my ear.

315
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,440
Mordecai.

316
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,360
Bitches, help me! Shit.

317
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,040
That's a man, dog! LeeJohn!
That's a man!

318
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,920
I won't tell if you don't tell!

319
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,040
Don't bring your ass around here
unless you ready to borrow money!

320
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,160
Playing with my emotions.

321
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,520
Hey, yo, about last night?

322
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,200
About the fact that you was
enjoying that massage, by a man?

323
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,440
Hey, Durell, I was not enjoying
no massage by no nasty...

324
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,760
Just because a man sings a slow jam
while another man's massaging him...

325
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,640
...does not mean he was enjoying it.

326
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,760
- What does it mean?
- I'm in love with Minnie Riperton.

327
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,800
That song touches
a sensitive side of me...

328
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,320
...so I wanted to share it
with other men.

329
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,200
Hey, man! Yo, homey!
Yo, that could be one of our chairs!

330
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,320
No, not today.

331
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,040
- We gonna get creamed...
- Not today.

332
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,200
That's our chair.

333
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,120
- Don't worry about that chair.
- Blahka!

334
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,560
That's what you need
to be worrying about. That right there.

335
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,440
Now let the church say amen.

336
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,600
Or a-woman.

337
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,000
Hey there, Beige.

338
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,040
That's what I'm talking about.

339
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,200
See, now, that's the reason why I sing.

340
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,040
Yo, LeeJohn, where you going?

341
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,280
I'm gonna meet me
a Mary Magdalene!

342
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,280
- Get your ass out of the street.
- Wait.

343
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,320
Man, you better get back over here.

344
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,520
LeeJohn! Yo, LeeJohn!

345
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,480
Wait for me.

346
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,200
Durell, man, this is like Club Jesus.

347
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,960
And they got a open bar.
Look at this.

348
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,480
VIP.

349
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,960
In the cheap seats? Come on, man,
this is the Rosa Parks section.

350
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,480
You remind me of my uncle, man,
his name was Tom.

351
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,480
My knee.

352
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,000
Hey, y'all got Cheez Whiz?

353
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,040
I don't know what goes on in church.
I've never been.

354
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,400
You have a three-drink minimum?

355
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,760
I'm getting tore up from the floor up.

356
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,440
These people be feeling it.

357
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,680
The presence of the Lord...

358
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,400
...is here.

359
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,080
Hallelujah.

360
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,320
I would like all of our visitors here
in the church today to please stand.

361
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,480
- Right now.
- Welcome.

362
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,040
- That's all right.
- Welcome to the house of the Lord.

363
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,800
Y'all know,
the first time, you're a visitor...

364
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,520
...the next time, you're family.

365
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,120
Hallelujah. Welcome, sugar.

366
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,960
See, y'all visiting today, so y'all
may not know here at First Hope...

367
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,840
...we don't believe in last hope,
amen?

368
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,600
When you go for three months
without paying your electric bill.

369
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,800
And you hope they don't cut you off.

370
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,680
Say it now, preacher, say it!

371
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,480
I'm talking about you, Sister Baker.

372
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,320
You need to just slow down, baby.

373
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,360
Over the last year and a half,
we've raised almost $230,000.

374
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,200
- Say amen, church.
- Yes!

375
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,320
Bingo. Yahtzee.

376
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,280
Which, as you know...

377
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,240
...we are considering using
to build a new sanctuary...

378
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,960
...in a less...

379
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,320
- Urban.
- Congested neighborhood.

380
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,360
He's using big words now.
Sanctuary. Congested. That means...

381
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,960
- The ghetto.
- Ghetto. Yeah.

382
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,360
Oh, no, sugar. Right here, right here.
It's all right, right here.

383
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,880
Ain't nothing wrong.

384
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,880
Oh, Lord, my husband's
turning over in his grave.

385
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,000
Even if we don't move,
even if we stay right here...

386
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,480
...we still need some more money...

387
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,560
...to help us with these costly repairs
and improvements here in the church.

388
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,560
Like central air, for one thing.

389
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,480
So I'm calling on you because
we need your help.

390
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,800
Anybody in the church this morning
who's got $ 100 hope...

391
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,880
...stand to your feet right now.

392
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,400
Don't stand up if you ain't got it.

393
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,040
- That's a lot of $ 100 hope up in here.
- I'm getting them on camera phone.

394
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,960
Now, Malachi 3 and Verse 8,
it asks a simple question.

395
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,960
Will a man rob God?

396
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,360
Hundred dollar down to
a penny with a hole in it...

397
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,280
...stand to your feet right now.

398
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,360
Now, I want you all
to turn to your neighbor.

399
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,320
- Get some of these people...
- Look your neighbor in the eye...

400
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,680
...and say to him or her...

401
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,720
...the same thing that was said
over a thousand years ago.

402
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,960
- Will a man...
- Will a man...

403
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,200
...rob God?
... rob God?

404
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,480
I'm not robbing no church, man.

405
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,640
Would you...?

406
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,280
Ain't anybody talking about
robbing no church.

407
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,680
I'm talking about robbing
the people in the church.

408
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,720
Like they ain't never
done nothing wrong.

409
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,360
I remember one time, my foster mother
took me into a street service...

410
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,120
...and they was giving out free food
to people who was getting baptized.

411
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,880
And just because I wasn't getting
baptized, I couldn't eat.

412
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,240
- And I couldn't swim.
- Okay, get over it.

413
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,280
How many times
you gonna tell this story?

414
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,600
A million more!

415
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,920
Get over it.

416
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,280
Look, that is God's money,
and God do not want Blahka to kill us.

417
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,080
LeeJohn, I'm not robbing
no damn church.

418
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,720
All right, don't rob the church.

419
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,640
But when Durell Jr. Is in Atlanta calling
some big, ugly black dude "Daddy"...

420
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
...don't be mad at me.

421
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,000
Watch your mouth.
My son ain't going nowhere.

422
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,040
I'll come across this table
on you, boy.

423
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,640
It ain't the first time
you came across the table on me.

424
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,960
- Won't be the last time.
- I'm telling the truth.

425
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,520
Now you wanna
explode in violence?

426
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,040
Yeah?

427
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,800
Durell, I'm leaving next week.

428
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,720
Next week?
What happened to next month?

429
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,920
Landlord said I have to have the
money by next week. I don't have it.

430
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,560
Do you?

431
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,160
- No.
- Of course you don't.

432
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,960
Now where you gonna get
the money from?

433
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,800
<i>Record your message
after the tone.</i>

434
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,800
<i>Hey, Dad, it's me. You promised.</i>

435
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,840
<i>You promised that you won't
let Mom take me to Atlanta.</i>

436
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,520
<i>I love you. I gotta go. Bye.</i>

437
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,800
Everybody and their mother
thought they was gonna win.

438
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,840
Well, you tell Scott when I get
his money I will give it to him.

439
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,200
Okay? He can't get what I ain't got.

440
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Right.

441
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,760
I'm in.

442
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,640
Let me call you right back.
I'll call you right back.

443
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,360
Look, now, all we got to do...

444
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,600
...is get to whoever got the money
before they get to the bank.

445
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,040
No. We ain't letting the money
get out.

446
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,120
We gonna get it while it's still in there.
Tonight.

447
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,440
That's what I was saying.
We gonna go get the money tonight.

448
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,240
Before it walks out of there.

449
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,000
- Yes.
- Through here.

450
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,000
I don't care about that goddamn pole,
man. Let's go.

451
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,240
Wait, I see something.

452
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,160
Put that damn thing down.
Let's go.

453
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,160
That scared the hell out of me.

454
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,720
Come on, man.

455
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,080
Come on, D.

456
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,160
D? Let's go, baby.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

457
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,520
What the hell you doing?
What the hell you doing?

458
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,400
- Why you got that in my face?
- Just trying to...

459
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,960
Man, you're so dumb sometimes.

460
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,480
Damn. I broke it.

461
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,800
Durell, that's a sign, man.
That's a omen, man.

462
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,920
Things happen for a reason, Durell.

463
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,640
The universe
is starting to speak to us.

464
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,120
We can go that way.

465
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,200
I'm not climbing up there.
I'm not Spider-Man.

466
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,760
- And I'm not scaling no wall.
- Who plan was this?

467
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,800
This was my plan, but I ain't
said nothing about scaling no wall.

468
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
No. No. No, Durell, no.

469
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,280
Ten wheelchairs, 1200 apiece.
You do the math.

470
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,520
Kiss my ass, Rell.

471
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,760
Don't bust your ass.

472
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,200
Who the hell you looking for?

473
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,280
- I ain't see you.
- I'm standing right here.

474
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,600
- I gotcha.
- All right. You gotta stop tweaking.

475
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,160
Get it together.
LeeJohn, get it together.

476
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,760
- Okay.
- Come on.

477
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,480
Hurry up.

478
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,280
That's my knee.

479
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,160
Mother-fletcher.

480
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,400
- Hey, Durell?
- What?

481
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,840
- He keep looking at me.
- Who?

482
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,400
White Jesus.

483
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,680
No matter where I go...

484
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,400
...the eyes go with me.

485
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,640
White Jesus!

486
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,040
Damn.

487
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,480
What happened?

488
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,000
My grandmama done gave 31 G's
to this church.

489
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,400
We should've robbed her ass.

490
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,000
- Hey, D?
- What?

491
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,960
You think there's really a hell?

492
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,640
Because I'm not a bad person.
I just be in bad situations.

493
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,160
You know what it is? My foster mother
used to beat me too much.

494
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,600
She used to come in and say:

495
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,960
"I'm gonna beat you till candy
come out. I'm gonna beat you till... "

496
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,880
- What's this?
- Pastor's study.

497
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,600
Lock that door.

498
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,280
- Yo, Durell?
- What?

499
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,080
They doing the same thing.
Look at the eyes.

500
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,160
Don't worry about them pictures.

501
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,800
I didn't kill the dream.

502
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,480
Jackpot.

503
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,080
- Pot-jack. That's good work, homeboy.
- For shizzle.

504
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,680
We ain't got time for that.

505
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,640
- Be careful. Don't blow us up.
- Let's get this guap.

506
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,000
Man, you know that ain't
no damn cherry bomb. Come on.

507
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,440
You know what you doing?

508
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,760
- Lf you blow us up, boy, I'll...
- Hit the deck!

509
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,920
Get your head down.

510
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,880
Try it again.

511
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,160
- Do you know what you're doing?
- I know what I'm doing.

512
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,560
Keep your mouth shut
and you won't get shot!

513
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,120
- Oh, my...
- Open up that safe.

514
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,320
What safe?

515
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,120
- That safe.
- Oh, man.

516
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,560
Still ain't open, man!

517
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,120
- All right, give me the combination.
- I don't know...

518
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,680
- Don't get cute, Pink!
- I don't know the combination!

519
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,280
You got the key,
but you don't know the combination?

520
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,640
Don't lie to me.

521
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,480
What are you doing?

522
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,880
Come here! Look, man.
What the hell wrong with you?

523
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,840
You know this is your plan?
You remember?

524
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,680
Not to put a grown-ass man
in time-out, it wasn't!

525
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,920
I'm climbing out that window,
and I'm jumping off that fire escape...

526
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,400
...and I'm gonna boogie-woogie
my black ass out of here, right now!

527
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,040
No, you ain't. No, you...

528
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,760
- Who is that?
- Don't know.

529
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,280
All right, Pink.
You know what I got in my pocket?

530
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
All right, get over here.
Open that door.

531
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,040
- Deacon?
- Okay, okay.

532
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,520
Why is this door locked, Deacon?
Oh, you have company.

533
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,120
Timmy, sit down over there.

534
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,440
Well, no smoking in the church.

535
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,920
Sorry.

536
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,480
I'm Doris McPherson,
the church secretary...

537
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,960
...and this is my son, Timmy.

538
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,520
Timmy, stop all that jumping.
Stop, stop.

539
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,600
And you are?

540
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,880
- Leonard.
- Leonard.

541
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,240
Leonard.

542
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,800
You're both named Leonard?

543
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,040
Yeah, but we say it differently.

544
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,760
It's a family tradition that both
the boy cousins is named Leonard.

545
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,920
Interesting.

546
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,360
The pastor would like
you to come to the meeting...

547
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,680
...so that we can get started
and leave early.

548
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,680
He'd also like you to bring
the financial records, okay? All right.

549
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,440
Timmy, come on. Baby, come on.

550
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,680
Very nice meeting you, Leonard.
Leonard.

551
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,440
Please bring the records now,
Deacon.

552
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,360
Who else is here?

553
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,920
- Everybody.
- Everybody?

554
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,640
Get over here.
Open that safe, right now!

555
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,000
Could you come now? Deacon?

556
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,880
- Let's leave right now!
- Shut up. Open.

557
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,080
If I don't go,
they're gonna keep coming back.

558
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,080
That's why we should be out of here.
Let's take flight!

559
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,800
- Deacon? The pastor, he's waiting.
- Come on, let's go.

560
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,280
Congregations move all the time,
Tianna. It's called progress.

561
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,840
No, Daddy, it's called profit...

562
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,760
...which is why the deacon
is always trying to get us to move.

563
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,600
Don't do that. Let me tell you,
you blow that bugle one more time...

564
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,160
...you hear,
Jesus himself gonna have to come...

565
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,560
...and get off the cross and save you,
you hear me?

566
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,880
Come on, baby,
just sit where you always sit.

567
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,960
- You find the deacon?
- He's behind me.

568
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,680
I told him to come,
we been here all day, everybody tired.

569
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,280
Stop with the imaginary friends.

570
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,000
- Slow down.
- Okay, relax. I'll do whatever you say.

571
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,280
Here's what we gonna do.

572
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,080
You go in there and you answer
whatever question they got...

573
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,160
...excuse yourself,
and then we gonna ease on out.

574
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,120
They ask who we are, we here
to fix the church, you got that?

575
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,480
Do you got this? Okay.

576
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,400
That is the most crackish idea ever.

577
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,160
What, more crackish
than selling wheelchairs?

578
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,560
I don't know yet.

579
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,400
But they don't know us.
They gonna know something's wrong.

580
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,360
The only way they gonna know
something...

581
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,160
...is if you act like something
is wrong, so don't.

582
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,440
Something is wrong!

583
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,760
- Oh, there he is.
- Oh, well, Deacon.

584
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,160
How gracious of you to return.

585
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
Tianna, don't start now.

586
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,000
Everyone, this is Leonard.
And this is...

587
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,160
- Leonard.
- So both of y'all named Leonard?

588
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,160
It's a family tradition.

589
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,480
All of the first boy cousins
are named Leonard.

590
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,000
Yeah, and they're doing some work
on the church...

591
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,640
...so I'm gonna straighten them out
and be right back.

592
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,600
I hope you work
on this air conditioning.

593
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,680
It's hotter than four sisters in a phone
booth with G-strings on, that's hot.

594
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,360
Why would we do work
on the old church?

595
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,960
I mean, we're obviously just gonna
move to a new church, right, Deacon?

596
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,880
That decision hasn't been made.
Hold on.

597
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,720
I thought the deacon had
already made that decision for you.

598
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,440
And for me. Oh, well,
and for all of us, actually.

599
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,640
Momma T, did you know that
the deacon cast your vote?

600
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,640
- Were you aware?
- You cast her vote?

601
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,880
No.

602
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,080
You mean that you let him
cast your vote and not cast mine?

603
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,640
Darling, I would never let anybody
take our voices away.

604
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,440
Lord have mercy.

605
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,680
What is this about?

606
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,240
Well, Momma T, that's
not entirely true, I didn't do that.

607
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,200
The money that we raise...

608
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,440
...should be used to fund
outreach programs in this community.

609
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,160
Yes, and a foster-care center
would be nice.

610
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,840
A convalescent home,
after-school programs.

611
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,880
The church
should inspire the community.

612
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,280
What about folks that walk to church
and can't afford transportation?

613
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,680
Maybe moving the church
will inspire them to get a job...

614
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,920
...so that they can
afford some transportation.

615
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,920
- Deacon.
- I thought we hadn't decided...

616
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,040
...whether we were gonna
move the church.

617
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,200
You know what?

618
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,720
I thought the same thing,
until I found these...

619
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,640
...on my daddy's desk.

620
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,920
Those are ideas, Pastor.

621
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,840
Just, you know, possibilities in case
we all voted to move the church.

622
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,280
I'm trying to be prepared.

623
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,000
Arthur, is this true?

624
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,280
As I told my inquisitive daughter...

625
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,320
- Nosy daughter.
- Deacon.

626
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,120
Momma T, I haven't made
any decision yet, okay?

627
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,280
That's why we're meeting here
this evening.

628
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,600
Right, and I wanna participate
but I have some...

629
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,040
Look, right there. He's planning
to put an ATM right in the church.

630
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,160
Will be right back.

631
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,560
Well, you can't do any business yet.

632
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,920
Why not, lady? We gotta go.

633
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,800
Because we haven't prayed yet,
and we need to pray on this.

634
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,920
Lord have mercy.

635
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,480
Like my late husband
used to always say:

636
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,840
"Man should always pray
and not faint. "

637
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,440
Luke's 18:1.

638
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,120
I don't mean to disrespect
your husband, Luke 18 and 1...

639
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,280
...but is he gonna help us
with this drywall?

640
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,840
Because I got to get these tools
off the truck.

641
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,800
Oh, he's so funny, don't you think?

642
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,520
You gentlemen...

643
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,120
...will join us in a moment of prayer,
won't you?

644
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,240
Everybody join hands.
Take his hand, Timmy.

645
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,120
Arthur.

646
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,680
Precious Father...

647
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,800
<i>Precious Father</i>

648
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,760
<i>We need you now</i>

649
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,840
We come to you this evening...

650
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,560
...thankful for yet another opportunity
to join as one.

651
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,880
<i>Thankful for you today, right now</i>

652
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,480
You said, where two
are gathered in your name...

653
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,160
Matthew's 18:20.

654
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,280
...there you'd be.

655
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,680
Thank you, Jesus.

656
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,200
We ask today that you not only
speak to our minds and our hearts...

657
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,520
Or our wallets.

658
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,160
Lord, pray for all the parents that keep
bringing their babies down here...

659
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,000
...to get baptized,
without giving them a hot bath.

660
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,920
Last time, there was a ring around the
pool, and Brother Bertware got gout.

661
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,520
But also to our purpose.

662
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,760
Yes, and speaking of that, please,
everybody...

663
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,000
...please pray for Sister Cora.

664
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,800
Pray for her, she got her head stuck
between the doors at Walgreens.

665
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
She was trying to change the station...

666
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,440
...on her iPod
her grandbabies bought her.

667
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,000
What a gift. What a gift.

668
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,800
We also seek your guidance today...

669
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,480
...so that we seek your will
and not ours.

670
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,520
- Or the deacon's.
- Or Tianna's.

671
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,640
All these things we ask...

672
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,080
In Jesus' name...
Let's get to work... Amen.

673
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,000
Amen.

674
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,120
All right, I gotta go. I love you.
Gotta go home.

675
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,760
It's first Sunday. They not supposed
to rehearse till second Sunday.

676
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,360
- Well, they can't rehearse tonight.
- Why not?

677
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,760
Because it's just not a good night.
I'll be right back.

678
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,400
I'm gonna construct some construction
that needs to be constructed.

679
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,040
Exactly what I was talking about.

680
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
Wait, Tianna, hold on.
Why can't they...?

681
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,800
You're supposed to be singing
from your diaphragm.

682
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,640
And you are singing from somewhere
you have pain and anger.

683
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,800
We don't need that.

684
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,200
Why are you singling me out?

685
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,960
I'm not singling you out,
you are singling yourself out.

686
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,880
You can't be Deniece Williams,
you can't be a black butterfly.

687
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,720
- Somebody got to be a moth or one...
- Rickey, excuse me.

688
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,960
Like a flying roach.

689
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,400
- Rickey.
- You not supposed to.

690
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,200
- You supposed to be the...
- Excuse me.

691
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,600
- Yes, may I help you?
- You can't meet here tonight.

692
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,520
Really? That's kind of interesting,
because I am here tonight.

693
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,560
- Why I can't be here?
- You can't meet...

694
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,120
...because we're meeting here.

695
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,000
You know what, is there a problem?
Is this personal?

696
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,920
I am the deacon here,
and you need to...

697
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,360
The problem, Rickey, is that he's
always trying to control everything.

698
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,920
That's exactly what his problem is.
Back to y'all.

699
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,000
One, two, three, four.

700
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,160
Excuse me!

701
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,080
Excuse me, man.

702
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,920
Excuse you?
Don't nobody even know you.

703
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,640
Come on, let's sing.
They letting strangers just walk in.

704
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,320
- How you doing?
- Good, thank you. Right, here we go.

705
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,160
- What's over there?
- I'm about to do something.

706
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,240
- What you about to do?
- Just go over there and sit.

707
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,040
Daddy, can I talk to you in private?

708
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,640
Hey there, Leonard.

709
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,320
- Replacement.
He is the head deacon.

710
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,760
Everybody! Shut the hell up!

711
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,040
All that construction
has poor Leonard on edge.

712
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,120
First of all, my name ain't Leonard.

713
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,600
- It ain't?
- No.

714
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,400
- You Leonard?
- I'm still Leonard.

715
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,520
All right, Leonard.

716
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,600
Second of all, we didn't come
to repair this church.

717
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,760
We came to rob it.

718
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,520
Is this some sort of a joke, sir?
Nobody has time for this.

719
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,960
I'm gonna need everybody...

720
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,360
Who are these two clowns
you brought in here?

721
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,560
You have to tell us what's going on.

722
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,760
- Where you going? Get off of me!
- They won't shoot the baby.

723
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Durell, you better get down,
somebody got a gun.

724
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,480
That's me with the gun, fool. Get up.

725
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,520
You got a gun?

726
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,640
In the church?

727
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,640
God gonna whip your ass!

728
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,120
Go lock all the doors.

729
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,360
Now, we didn't come here
to hurt nobody, but we will.

730
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,840
All we want is the money.

731
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,600
Take your two-ways,
cell phones, beepers...

732
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,760
...anything you got that beep, buzz
or get on my nerves...

733
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,960
...put it in the basket.

734
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:59,080
Drop it in the bucket.
Save yourself a trip to the hospital.

735
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,160
Now, we gonna take this deacon
to the back.

736
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,520
He gonna open up this safe
and we gonna get out.

737
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,520
Simple and plain.

738
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,840
- Oh, my God!
- What's wrong with him?

739
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,760
Get your ass back!

740
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,680
The hell wrong with you?

741
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,160
You sure you wanna do that?

742
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,000
Look around you. You're not gonna
get away with this. This is a church.

743
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,480
I'm gonna get away with it,
just like you been getting away with it.

744
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,920
Selling hope.

745
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,040
Take his ass to the back,
he gonna open up this safe...

746
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,760
...and we gonna walk out that door.

747
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,920
And I'm gonna hope
I don't have to pull this trigger.

748
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,120
I can tell you gonna be trouble.

749
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,480
We need to sit you down.

750
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,720
<i>We've seen your faces,
and that's not good.</i>

751
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,240
But perhaps...

752
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,800
...I can somehow persuade the others
to let the two of you just walk out...

753
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,800
...and we can pretend this never
happened. But if I open this safe...

754
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,840
Never mind.

755
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,320
- It's gone.
- Gone?

756
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,440
Who would steal money
from a church?

757
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,520
- What?
- See, this is exactly why...

758
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,120
...I wanted to move the church
out of this community.

759
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,000
To avoid this type of thing.

760
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,080
This has nothing to do
with the community.

761
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,720
This has everything to do
with these two fools here.

762
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,680
These two fools are the community.

763
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,680
Hold up. What's he talking about?
Who you calling "fool," chump?

764
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,880
The two fools
waving a gun in a church.

765
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,320
Don't call the two Leonards "fools. "

766
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,200
I told you my name ain't Leonard.

767
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,200
- What is your name?
- I'm LeeJohn and that's Durell.

768
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,680
Oh, LeeJohn.

769
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,080
Leonard!

770
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,240
You just told them our real names.

771
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,680
Come back over here and sit down.

772
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,320
All right, one thing I do know,
whoever stole that money...

773
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,040
...is still up in here, right now.

774
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,400
Who's to say?

775
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,840
Was the safe broken into? No.

776
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,360
Is the money missing? Yeah.

777
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,360
Yet everybody that got the
combination is sitting right here...

778
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,760
...on the same night the money come
up missing. Ain't that a coincidence?

779
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,920
Leonard? Leonard!

780
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,760
Leonard! You and your crazy logic!

781
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,720
Now, how you know they the only
ones that know the combination?

782
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,480
Ain't nobody meeting on the money
and how to spend it...

783
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,120
...unless they know where it is.
Simple.

784
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,200
We certainly don't have it.
None of us. We just got here.

785
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,400
You should point this at whoever's
been here since the 1:00 service.

786
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,560
Hanging around...
We certainly wasn't in here.

787
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,320
I was not gonna be in somebody's
meeting sweating my perm out...

788
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,240
...long as it take me
under some irons.

789
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,080
This is not even my church.
I saw this on MySpace.

790
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,960
I'm just not a good hostage in a...

791
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,360
Since nobody left the church,
that mean the money is still here.

792
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,240
So one of y'all either got it
or know where it is.

793
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,960
So we ain't leaving until we find it.
Now is the time to start snitching.

794
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,200
You know something?

795
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,360
If you didn't have that gun,
I'd come over...

796
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,480
Tianna. Hush.

797
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,520
I wanna see Jesus too,
but I don't wanna see him tonight.

798
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,080
Whose phone is that?

799
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,800
Who got a phone?
Didn't I tell you to put it in the basket?

800
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,480
That's probably Jesse Jackson
calling to free me.

801
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,560
That's your phone.

802
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,360
<i>- Hey, man.
- Hey, Dad.</i>

803
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,240
My PSP just stopped working.

804
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:48,960
Handle this.

805
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,080
- Handle what?
- Just sit there and hold that.

806
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,760
What, that?

807
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,240
Why there always got to be
a sidebar with you? Here.

808
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,720
- When's the last time you charged it?
- Last night.

809
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,480
Try turning it over
and just take the battery out.

810
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,760
Okay.

811
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,480
<i>Wipe off the battery terminal...</i>

812
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,400
<i>...but not with your hand, okay?</i>

813
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,120
All right.

814
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,320
It's his son.

815
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,320
Try it again.

816
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,640
It's working.

817
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,440
I gotta go. I love you, Dad.

818
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,160
I love you too.

819
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,560
I'm sick of this bullshit.

820
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,040
I need to know where this money
is right now!

821
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,680
Please, have some respect
for the house of the Lord.

822
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,040
I gotta use the bathroom!

823
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,920
Okay, let these people
finish robbing.

824
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,600
- I gotta use it now!
- Shut him up.

825
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,200
Why don't you just let the boy
go to the bathroom?

826
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,960
Just mind your own business.

827
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,760
You might as well let him pee
because he's gonna pee regardless.

828
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,120
I was watching him earlier.

829
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,760
He hadn't been drinking water,
so it's probably ammonia.

830
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,960
You don't want that strong smell.
I'm gonna take him to the house...

831
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,480
...and make sure he's hydrated
and get juice in him.

832
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,040
I'll bring him right back here.

833
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,880
And I'm gonna get Momma T,
I saw what you had for breakfast.

834
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,400
I know you probably bubbling.

835
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,120
LeeJohn, take that little boy
to the bathroom.

836
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,240
I'm not gonna let anybody take
my Timmy to the bathroom.

837
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,720
Well, then let him pee in your purse.

838
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,120
Sit down!

839
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,440
Okay, the double doors.
The first door on the left.

840
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,440
Make sure you jiggle the handle after
you use it because it'll make noise.

841
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,000
Go ahead, Timmy, go on.

842
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,160
Why do I have to take him
to the bathroom?

843
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,160
I gotta figure out
who got this money.

844
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,160
Why don't you take him and
let me figure out who got the money?

845
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,040
Wait a minute, this is my idea.

846
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,120
Why do you
always gotta give the orders?

847
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,760
- You wanna give orders now?
- Please don't let him.

848
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,320
- I might.
- All right.

849
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,080
We got church people held hostage.

850
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,960
The money we came to steal?
Somebody stole it.

851
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,000
They done seen our faces and
because of you, they know our names.

852
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,200
LeeJohn and Durell.

853
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:13,080
See? So, what you suggest, huh?

854
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,960
You the smart one now.

855
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,120
And make sure
you jiggle the handle too.

856
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,160
Tuck your shirt in so I can
take you back to your moms, man.

857
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,280
She ain't my mama!

858
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,160
What you mean,
she ain't your moms?

859
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,120
This is my mom and this is me.

860
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,200
She said she's coming back to get me.
Least, that's what she said.

861
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,080
Yeah, well...

862
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:55,240
...until she do,
tuck your shirt in your pants.

863
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,960
Boy, nobody never teach you how
to tuck your shirt in your pants?

864
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,640
No.

865
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,280
You know, that's all right.
Nobody never taught me either.

866
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
But this how you do,
you put the left in first.

867
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,160
Why?

868
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,800
Well, I don't know.
Who's doing the tucking?

869
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,640
Put your left in first...

870
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,840
...then you put your right in.
Let me see you do it.

871
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,400
Yep.

872
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,120
Yeah, that's it.

873
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,240
Why don't somebody tell them where
the money is so we can go home?

874
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,800
You know, Leonard...

875
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,080
...maybe you should ask someone who
wishes we didn't have the money...

876
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,520
...so we couldn't move the church.

877
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,920
Deacon, you out of line.

878
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,800
- You are way out of line.
- Out of line?

879
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,280
Yeah, out of line.

880
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,520
- We need a safer environment.
- You have never...

881
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,360
- This is the wrong time to be arguing.
- Everybody just shut up! Shut up!

882
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,080
Y'all fuss and fight more
than me and LeeJohn up in here.

883
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,720
- Who's that?
- Mr. Wally.

884
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,320
He cleans the church.

885
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,400
Make a move,
I'll pop a cap in your ass.

886
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,760
You don't need to be scared.
He ain't got that many bullets.

887
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,720
He'd need one of them ones
where the bullets come all the way...

888
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,040
- He's legally blind.
- He can't see.

889
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,120
- He's partially deaf.
- He can't hear.

890
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,200
Then why y'all got this man
cleaning up?

891
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,160
He's free.

892
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,320
You don't need to clean
the church tonight.

893
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,440
Hey, man? Not tonight.

894
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,760
- Come again?
- Not tonight, man.

895
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,080
If I can't clean tonight,
it throws my whole week off.

896
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,520
What about my Monday appointment?
Can't do that till Tuesday.

897
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,760
What about my Tuesday appointment?
Can't do that till Wednesday.

898
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,600
What about my Wednesday
appointment?

899
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,760
Can't do that till Thursday.
What about my?

900
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,120
He's free.

901
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,920
Can't do that till Friday.

902
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,600
What about my Friday appointment?
Can't do that till Saturday.

903
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,680
Yo, who was that?

904
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,400
That was the blind and deaf
cleaning man.

905
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,120
You was supposed
to lock the doors.

906
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,280
I did! I ran out of chain!

907
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,040
Okay. Here's what we gonna do.

908
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,000
A little one-on-one session.

909
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,960
See if I can jog some memories.

910
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,960
So you, big mouth.

911
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,360
- Got your big mouth.
- Lay one hand on my daughter...

912
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,360
- I'll go first.
- No, no, no.

913
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,440
I'll go first. I'll talk to him.

914
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,960
I would go first, but first
has already been taken twice.

915
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,960
- I will go first.
- But, Pastor, listen...

916
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,760
- It's fine, Deacon.
- Daddy, you...

917
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,720
It's fine. Honey, it's fine.

918
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,040
It's fine. The Bible says first
will be last. I'm gonna be last first.

919
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,960
You can go first.

920
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,960
All right.

921
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,360
I'm gonna take his ass up there
and figure out where this is, okay?

922
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,400
You keep a eye on everybody.
Anybody move, you know what to do.

923
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,560
What?

924
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,000
- Take that.
- Another gun?

925
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,880
Who are you?

926
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,520
I'm telling you, King,
it's the mambo sauce.

927
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,800
That's the magic, my man.

928
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,280
- I hear you. I hear you.
- I'm telling you, boy.

929
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,000
Look at that. It's a disgrace.

930
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,800
The church owns that building,
right?

931
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,240
Yeah. If they're not gonna take care
of it, they should sell it.

932
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,400
<i>Why would I steal money
from my own church?</i>

933
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,760
We're here to find out.

934
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,200
Don't you got a Rolls-Royce?

935
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,200
- Bentley? Phantom?
- Ford.

936
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,560
- You throw some D's on that bitch?
- On a Ford?

937
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,520
I love Momma T. I do.

938
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:29,800
You are talking about
one of the sweetest, kindest...

939
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,480
...most gentle women ever.
But she'll steal.

940
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,240
At my age...

941
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,400
...the only thing
I'm looking to steal is time.

942
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,440
All the money in the world
can't buy that.

943
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,560
I love Sister Doris like...

944
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,080
Like she was my own sister.

945
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,200
But raising other people's children
is not cheap.

946
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,000
Kids is a necessary expense of life.

947
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,160
Every penny I get,
I put on that boy's costumes.

948
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,840
Last Christmas,
he was the Virgin Mary.

949
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,560
Thanksgiving, he was a drumstick.
Easter, he had to play a egg.

950
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,720
Anytime you wanna pitch in and help,
you are welcome. It is not cheap.

951
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,040
But I don't steal from nobody.

952
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,320
I love the deacon as...

953
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,960
It's endless. Got such
a dashing figure. Very articulate.

954
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,680
He's got to be getting some money.

955
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,360
Listen, I was brought here
to help fill the safe, not empty it.

956
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,480
Little pink shirts. I know they cost.

957
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,040
I think there's a lot of jealousy...

958
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,520
...about me and about
what I've done for the church.

959
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,600
Tianna. We talk like girlfriends.
Chitter-chatter.

960
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,080
Always, always, "How are you?"
"I'm good, how are you?" "I'm great. "

961
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,720
She doesn't lie,
but you can tell she's thinking it.

962
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,040
Okay, but why would I steal
from my own father?

963
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,960
- Get your nails done.
- I do my own nails.

964
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,040
- Get your car fixed.
- I ride the train.

965
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,520
- Get your hair did.
- I don't have any hair!

966
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,120
To keep this church
from moving to the suburbs.

967
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,160
Help!

968
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,280
Shut it up!

969
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,920
Please don't make me use this!

970
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,320
- Yo, Durell?
- Please help us!

971
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,680
- You're hurting my arm!
- Everybody:

972
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,840
Be quiet!

973
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,920
Get up! Get in the basement.

974
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,240
Hurry up, Pink. Get up in there.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

975
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,000
LeeJohn, handle it.

976
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,120
Hey, Kirk Franklin, hold up.

977
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,480
I need to go with them...

978
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,800
- Boy, come on. You going with me.
- Where we going?

979
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,360
You gonna be the lady of the house.

980
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,800
Hello, upstanding gentlemen
of the law.

981
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,760
This church owns the building
across the street, right?

982
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,920
Yes.

983
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,000
Are you aware there's some
illegal activity taking place there?

984
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,240
<i>Yes, my Lord</i>

985
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,040
I'm just the choir director...

986
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,640
...but I will tell the pastor,
who is the shepherd of our flock.

987
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,240
We are sheep
and he shepherds us.

988
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,400
Don't be too late.

989
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,920
We saw some unsavory characters
lurking around there.

990
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,680
When you say unsavory,
you mean jaywalkers...

991
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,920
...or you mean like actual
robbers and thieves and killers?

992
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,000
Which one? Like, how unsavory?

993
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:12,000
Murder unsavory, or just regular,
run-of-the-mill unsavoriness?

994
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,480
Okay, well, you have a good evening,
all right? Just be careful.

995
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,360
Okay, then. All right.

996
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,880
Y'all can make this a base camp
at any...

997
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,520
- They was still talking to me.
- Thought that was cute, huh? Let's go.

998
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,080
Did it look like he was winking at us?

999
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,520
He's the choir director.

1000
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,240
All right, look.

1001
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,760
Don't y'all wanna go home?
I ain't got time for this.

1002
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,440
Now, y'all need to tell me
what I need to know.

1003
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,600
Don't y'all wanna go...?

1004
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,600
Don't y'all wanna go home?
Because I do.

1005
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,160
So somebody need to tell me
what I need to know.

1006
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,720
Look, if we have to comb this church
inch by inch...

1007
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,520
What now?

1008
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,400
It's all this humidity,
mixed with emotions and excitement.

1009
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,040
Mixed with the fact that we're being
held hostage by gangbangers...

1010
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,600
...in a church with no air.

1011
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,120
Tianna, get me a wet towel
for this child.

1012
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,160
Wait a minute, where you going?

1013
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,160
I'm getting her a wet towel.

1014
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,600
She needs some air!

1015
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,440
She needs to lose a few pounds...

1016
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,200
...if she's gonna be
landing on people like that.

1017
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,600
- Rickey.
- I'm just saying...

1018
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,920
...that would help
if people gotta catch her.

1019
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,360
- Thank you.
- Put it on the back of her neck, baby.

1020
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,680
All the money you making on
Sundays, why you can't get the air on?

1021
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,640
The air conditioning works,
it just don't work all the time, that's all.

1022
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,600
- Why doesn't somebody just fix it?
- Fix what?

1023
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,800
The air. Durell could fix anything.

1024
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,520
Remember that time your
aunt Cynthia's freezer broke...

1025
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,040
...after she went shopping?

1026
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,920
You came right over and fixed it.

1027
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:49,080
I don't remember.
Matter of fact, it ain't even hot to me.

1028
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,240
So we straight.

1029
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,680
- What church are you in?
- Rickey, sit down.

1030
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,520
What? No, get your hands off of me.

1031
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,880
- Sit down, man.
- It is hot as Satan's toenails in here.

1032
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,000
Rickey? Are you all right?

1033
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,400
Yes, I'm all right.
Are you all right, Miss I-Just-Fainted?

1034
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,200
I'm just a little frustrated.

1035
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,320
I'm not scared no more.
I'm not just gonna keep being scared!

1036
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,000
Okay? So shoot me. Shoot me.
Here I am, shoot me.

1037
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,280
- Go ahead, shoot him.
- Shoot him. Go ahead.

1038
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,160
You'll probably really shoot me.

1039
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,560
Rickey, sit your butt down.

1040
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,440
Would you make sure that I look
good in my casket when I... Lord!

1041
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,480
- Shut up!
- I'll scratch his eyes.

1042
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,080
Just fix the a. c., Durell.

1043
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,880
- Y'all get off of me! Get off of me!
- Don't trip out on me right now.

1044
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,760
Do anybody know
where this air-conditioning unit is?

1045
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,120
Hold up. Let me get that light.

1046
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,000
Come on, give it up.

1047
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,160
You're supposed to be fixing
the air conditioner, not taking a tour.

1048
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,720
I know.

1049
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,360
Let's go.

1050
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,560
First, we got to look for this money
in one more place.

1051
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,480
As hard as it is to keep crime out of
the streets, now it's in the church.

1052
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,400
Why would y'all steal money
from church?

1053
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,800
Because to them, it's not a church.

1054
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,280
It's a building on the corner
next to a liquor store.

1055
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,520
Where the neon wine-and-beer sign
is brighter than the cross.

1056
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,000
You know, if we separate the two
like I've been wanting...

1057
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,120
...maybe ours would shine brighter.

1058
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,040
Brighter because we're brighter,
Deacon?

1059
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,240
Or brighter
because we're separate?

1060
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,520
I want the key to that cabinet
right there...

1061
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,440
...and I know you got it, so don't lie.

1062
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,480
Were y'all trying
to blow open the safe?

1063
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,800
It wasn't my idea.

1064
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,240
You find it?

1065
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,320
Do it look like I found it? Let's go.

1066
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,040
What kind of name is LeeJohn,
anyway?

1067
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,920
When I was born, my mother had
two boyfriends. Lee and John.

1068
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,000
She ain't know who my real father
was, so she named me LeeJohn.

1069
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,840
Of course.

1070
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,560
I don't think I would've told that.

1071
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,440
Hot.

1072
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,000
You know...

1073
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,960
...if that doesn't work,
there's always Sho-Blo.

1074
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,360
Yeah, well, maybe it'll work
if I can get...

1075
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,560
If I can get the light pointed straight.

1076
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,120
Oh, yeah, the problem is the light.
It's my fault.

1077
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,360
I'm hungry.

1078
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,920
I'm hungry too.

1079
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,200
When are you not hungry?

1080
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,600
Well, I have some leftover chicken,
ham, potato salad, greens...

1081
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:30,240
...and some peach cobbler
from this afternoon's dinner.

1082
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,600
I could fix something up
if y'all would like to eat.

1083
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,840
What about a 8-year-old boy who was
hungry and didn't know how to swim?

1084
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,160
Was scared to get baptized because
he thought he was gonna drown?

1085
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,640
<i>- How come he couldn't eat, huh?
- What?</i>

1086
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,680
Is that a yes or a no on the chicken?

1087
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,120
How do you know how to fix
air conditioners, anyway?

1088
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,600
When you grow up in a house
and everything around you is broke...

1089
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,320
...that's what you do.

1090
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,440
You fix things. Watch this.

1091
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,640
Oh, my gosh.

1092
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,720
Hit that light.

1093
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,040
Don't wanna electrocute myself.

1094
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,240
Wow, you know, this thing has never
worked right. You're pretty good.

1095
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,480
I mean, you're obviously not good,
but what you just did was good.

1096
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,800
- You always so stank?
- Only when I'm hungry.

1097
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:33,680
And when I'm being held hostage at
gunpoint, I get a little a cranky.

1098
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,040
Maybe I got a good reason.
You ever think of that?

1099
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,400
You mean like Robin Hood?
Or, in your case, robbing the hood?

1100
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,800
Take from the poor
and give to the poor?

1101
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,800
Trying to give something
I never had.

1102
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,120
- A felony record?
- No, a father.

1103
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,040
Do you have a tissue I can borrow?

1104
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,120
I seem to have left mine
in the bucket...

1105
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:54,240
...along with anything that would
beep, buzz or get on your nerves.

1106
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,760
My mother died when I was 6.
You don't see me robbing a church.

1107
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,120
Yeah, sometimes you gotta do what
you gotta do to get where you going.

1108
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,600
Would that be jail?

1109
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,640
Parenting from within the penal
system, that would be brilliant.

1110
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,440
That's not smart.

1111
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,400
- You wouldn't even understand.
- And I don't want to.

1112
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,480
What you care for anyway,
church girl?

1113
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,200
- I don't.
- Good. Neither do I.

1114
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,720
- Good.
- Good.

1115
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:16,880
Good.

1116
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,200
G- double-O-D.

1117
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,600
- Good.
- Perfect.

1118
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,800
Wait a minute.

1119
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,960
- Thank you.
- Oh, Sister Doris' chicken.

1120
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,720
That's good.

1121
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,680
I brought you some food.
I know you hungry too.

1122
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,800
I don't have to get baptized, right?
Because I can't swim.

1123
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,720
No.

1124
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,840
- There you are.
- Thank you.

1125
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,200
It's good, ain't it?

1126
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,120
Something about you
remind me of my husband.

1127
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,680
I think it's your nose.
He had a wide one just like you.

1128
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:06,040
Oh, he was a beautiful man
inside and out.

1129
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,200
One of the best deacons this church
ever had. No matter what they say.

1130
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,120
He loved my cooking too.

1131
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:17,800
You know, today was his birthday,
and nobody remembered but me.

1132
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,360
He's been gone, what, six years?

1133
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,000
He loved the birthday parties
I planned for him.

1134
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,200
You like birthday parties, Leonard?
I mean, LeeJohn?

1135
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,600
- I don't know, I never had one.
- You never had a birthday party?

1136
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:35,040
When they took me to my foster home,
they lost my birth certificate...

1137
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,960
...so nobody never knew
when my birthday was.

1138
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,240
I know when it is.

1139
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,040
You do? When?

1140
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,760
Today.

1141
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,440
Give me your hand.

1142
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,000
Happy birthday.

1143
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,440
Come on, now.

1144
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,440
It's all right.

1145
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,800
It's all right.

1146
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,080
Yes, it is.

1147
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,400
It's all right.

1148
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:53,800
LeeJohn.

1149
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,800
The hell you doing?

1150
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,080
You hungry?

1151
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,840
It's blowing harder
than it's ever blown before.

1152
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,760
It's a miracle.

1153
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,040
It's air. The same air as before,
just a little cooler.

1154
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,320
A young man
as good with his hands as you are...

1155
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,280
...should have more options
than robbing.

1156
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,680
- I'm all out of options now.
- That's not true, son.

1157
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,240
Don't, that's not true.

1158
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,040
You're only out of options
when you stop looking for them.

1159
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,640
- Durell?
- Go back over there.

1160
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,840
- I need to talk to you.
- I don't wanna talk to you right now.

1161
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,920
Can I talk to you for one minute?

1162
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,760
I don't wanna do this anymore.
These people ain't did nothing to us.

1163
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,520
You came and got me from
my grandmama house with this...

1164
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:39,480
...and you don't wanna go through
with it? Trying to punk out?

1165
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,840
I ain't no punk, man.

1166
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,080
You ain't forgot
you need this as bad as me?

1167
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,960
I'll think of something,
and I don't know what it is.

1168
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,120
But I know...

1169
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,040
...it ain't gonna be this.

1170
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,680
Durell, not this.

1171
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,680
Our jobs would be easier if people
would just listen and go home.

1172
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,760
Pastor knows they
supposed to be out by 10.

1173
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,280
I don't know what y'all did,
but I don't like it.

1174
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,800
Now stop playing with me and just
give me the money and we can leave.

1175
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,360
For some reason,
y'all think I won't use these.

1176
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,880
It's simple! Just give up the money!

1177
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,480
I thought you were supposed
to be cleaning.

1178
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:29,800
I told you, he's blind.

1179
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,880
- Can't see, and he's deaf.
- He can't hear.

1180
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,200
I've been cleaning this church
for 30 years. Seen a lot of things...

1181
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,680
...found a lot of things too.

1182
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,560
Why y'all got this man cleaning?

1183
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,080
- Because he's free.
- But never nothing like this.

1184
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,280
Evening.

1185
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,840
All right, get back! Sit back!
Sit down.

1186
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,840
- Look at all that money.
- Yeah.

1187
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,920
It's probably just the cleaning man,
you know?

1188
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,240
Or not.

1189
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,200
We got a 10-31 in progress at the
corner of Preston and Greenmount.

1190
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,640
A perp with a gun.
Request for immediate backup.

1191
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,120
That's our money.

1192
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,560
Son, that's God's money.

1193
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,680
LeeJohn, let's roll.

1194
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,240
LeeJohn.

1195
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,480
I think I'm gonna stay here
with them, Durell.

1196
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,200
It's your son, isn't it?

1197
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,080
Tell him what you're doing.

1198
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:49,120
You want him to hear it on the news?
Or read about it in tomorrow's paper?

1199
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:08,120
I get up every morning, and I take
my son to school every morning.

1200
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,440
He look at me, he don't see no thug.

1201
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:20,680
He see a man, all right?
I'm somebody to him.

1202
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,840
So you did this for your son?

1203
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,480
- Momma T.
- Momma T.

1204
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:32,200
You're doing this for yourself.

1205
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:38,280
Blaming everybody
but the one person responsible.

1206
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,000
You're a coward.

1207
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:49,240
Using foul language
and shooting guns off in the church...

1208
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,160
...you ought to be ashamed
of yourself.

1209
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,840
You deserve to lose your son.

1210
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,760
I'm not gonna lose my son!

1211
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:07,680
If this is what he sees in the morning
when he looks at you...

1212
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,520
...you've already lost him.

1213
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,880
<i>A perfect example of potential
with no purpose.</i>

1214
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,440
<i>I know what my plan B is.
It's to be just like you.</i>

1215
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:20,440
We can't lose any more sons.

1216
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,360
I'm not losing my son.

1217
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,560
Come on, LeeJohn, let's go.

1218
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,880
- Individuals and suspects in the...
- Close the door.

1219
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,000
We want you
to release the hostages.

1220
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,760
Come out with your hands
in the air.

1221
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,720
Durell, man!

1222
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,400
We're going to jail!

1223
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,760
We're not going to jail!
Let me just think.

1224
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:10,480
What are you talking about?
They got this whole place surrounded.

1225
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,920
- We going to jail!
- Calm down!

1226
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,960
Pastor, isn't there something
we can do?

1227
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:18,120
Help the police put these criminals
behind bars where they belong.

1228
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,000
Deacon, I was talking to the pastor.

1229
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,320
You heard Momma T.

1230
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,160
They in here, waving
and shooting guns, and we're not...

1231
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,360
I haven't called your name all day!
Don't talk to me, okay?

1232
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,320
Quiet!

1233
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,840
I have an idea.

1234
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,480
Durell, come on, cut me out this chair,
I'll show you.

1235
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,640
Show me what?

1236
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,400
Son, I'm gonna show you
a better option.

1237
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,040
Come on, son.

1238
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,960
Pastor, they need to go to jail.

1239
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,440
They got two guns in here...

1240
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:49,440
...they're obviously gangbangers
and thugs and hoodlums.

1241
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,680
This doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't...

1242
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,880
Pastor? Pastor.

1243
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,120
- What?
- You're doing the right thing.

1244
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:00,520
What are you gonna do? You're
putting your ministry in jeopardy.

1245
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:04,320
Suspects inside the church!
Come out with your hands in the air!

1246
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,040
I am gonna go outside...

1247
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:14,040
...and tell those policemen this
was all just a big misunderstanding.

1248
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,520
You're gonna go out there and lie?

1249
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,280
Deacon, I'm gonna go and help.

1250
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:21,320
I'm gonna go out there,
and I'm gonna tell them the truth.

1251
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,160
That we were being held hostage
by terrorists.

1252
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,320
Or have we all forgotten that?

1253
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,440
What about forgiveness, Deacon?

1254
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,120
Or have you forgotten that?

1255
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,520
Pastor, these...

1256
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,960
I wasn't held hostage.

1257
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,440
- Neither was I.
- Me neither.

1258
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,240
What's a hostage?

1259
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,760
A hostage is what we were in that
basement for four and a half hours.

1260
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,480
I'm gonna need therapy.
I need Dr. Ph...

1261
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,760
Okay, maybe not.

1262
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,720
Well, I was held hostage.

1263
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,920
And when the policemen get in here,
I'm gonna tell them exactly that!

1264
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,400
Do whatever you want.

1265
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,160
LeeJohn, Durell, y'all come on
with me. Come on.

1266
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,160
You can't be serious.

1267
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:15,040
You're a man of God,
and they're taking advantage of that!

1268
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,280
If we turn them in,
we can get a reward!

1269
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,000
We can do something.
We can do something to help.

1270
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,240
If you're going, I'm coming too.

1271
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,240
Hey, hey, hey.

1272
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:29,080
Where y'all going?
Sit down, sit down.

1273
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,920
Everybody's doing they part.
Sit down.

1274
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,160
Our part is singing.

1275
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:37,560
That's our part, what we do here
in the church as a choir, sing.

1276
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,560
We make things better, singing.

1277
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,400
Suspects, your time is up,
we are entering the building!

1278
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,560
- Police!
- Okay.

1279
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:03,920
Don't shoot! We're up here!

1280
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,760
There's a laundry chute
behind these.

1281
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,200
It's never been used,
first time for everything.

1282
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:09,720
Okay. Where does it go?

1283
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:13,200
To the basement. And there's a door
downstairs that'll get you out, I hope.

1284
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,840
- The rest is up to you.
- We gotta try.

1285
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:19,360
Pastor, what are you doing?
I'm getting the police.

1286
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,840
Police! We're up here!

1287
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,480
Let's go, guys, follow me.

1288
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,600
Hey, you better give me
those pistols.

1289
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,480
Thanks, man.

1290
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,480
You're doing the right thing.
Don't worry.

1291
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,880
Everything's gonna be okay.
Just have faith.

1292
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,560
Guess I'm supposed to go first,
right?

1293
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,280
I know you smarter than that.

1294
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,720
D, try not to break your neck.

1295
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,720
I didn't think you cared.

1296
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,320
I'll try.

1297
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,040
God bless you, son.

1298
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,520
Bye, LeeJohn!

1299
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:07,480
Goodbye, Timmy!

1300
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,120
Okay, let's go. Go, go, go.

1301
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,120
Durell, don't leave me!

1302
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,560
Come on, Rell, don't leave me!
Wait up!

1303
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,920
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

1304
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:34,320
- Spiderwebs! Spiderwebs!
- Go, go, go!

1305
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,960
Come on!

1306
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,600
Wait a minute.

1307
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,720
Yo, hey, that's our chair!
You ain't even crippled!

1308
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,480
Retreat!

1309
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,120
This way! Move!

1310
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,720
Yo, hold up.

1311
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,600
All right.

1312
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,880
This way, this way.

1313
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,560
Come on, come on, boy!

1314
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,400
Wait up! Wait up, Rell!

1315
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:44,840
- Rell!
- Hurry up.

1316
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,320
- Hurry up.
- Freeze!

1317
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,320
Back there, right there! Look!

1318
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,760
Freeze!

1319
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,480
You robbed a church?

1320
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,600
Your Honor, Mr. Judge,
it wasn't like that.

1321
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,840
We wasn't trying to rob.
We was gonna rebuild.

1322
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,240
We was gonna refurbish it
and everything. We...

1323
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,560
Allegedly robbed a church,
Your Honor.

1324
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,720
Your Honor, I haven't been to church
in a while... I apologize.

1325
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,120
- But the last I checked, the Holy Ghost
doesn't hold people hostage...

1326
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,960
...and the pastor isn't packing.

1327
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,120
- Lf it pleases the court...
- I object to trying to please the court.

1328
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:24,040
Lewis, when are you going
to get a life...?

1329
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,240
You commit a crime,
you have to do the time.

1330
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,960
Can I speak?
Your Honor, can I speak?

1331
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,400
Can I speak for myself?

1332
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,800
- No objection to that, Your Honor.
- Why not?

1333
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,280
- I don't wanna go back to ja...
- Let me just say this.

1334
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:38,840
- We're in bad enough shape as it is.
- Okay, thank you. Just sit down.

1335
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,920
Judge Galloway, how many times
have you seen me in this courtroom?

1336
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:47,040
And how many times have you said
the same thing you saying today?

1337
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,600
And here I am again.

1338
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,000
Man, my whole life
I done made bad decisions.

1339
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,400
Like the one you're making now?

1340
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,800
And my whole life,
I done blamed everybody...

1341
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,080
...but the person that's
responsible for those decisions.

1342
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,800
That's me.

1343
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,080
So it was my idea to go up
in that church. I want to apologize...

1344
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:09,880
Wait, that was my idea. We was
sitting in Cookie's that night and I...

1345
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,200
Sit your ass down!

1346
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,760
Now, Your Honor,
can we please get back to the facts?

1347
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:18,280
I have a witness that'll testify that
the defendants not only had firearms...

1348
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,760
...but they used them to
hold members of the church hostage.

1349
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,680
And they almost stole $64,000.

1350
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:32,040
Well, on first Sunday, you wrote down
that we took in $34,000.

1351
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:36,280
- Young lady, you'll have to sit down.
- But, Your Honor, I have proof.

1352
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,840
Bailiff, escort the young woman
to the witness stand.

1353
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,360
Go on up there, talk to him.

1354
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,080
Wait, what is that? What is that?

1355
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,640
Thieves in the temple.

1356
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:49,320
She's falsifying pieces of paper.
I don't know what that is, Pastor.

1357
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,840
In the report on first Sunday...

1358
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,520
...the deacon wrote down
that we only took in $34,000.

1359
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,600
- Pastor...
- He just said...

1360
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,040
...that they almost stole $64,000.

1361
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:10,120
- I did?
- Oh, now there's a discrepancy.

1362
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:13,200
- Why is she doing this to me?
- You see right here?

1363
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,120
Why are you doing this?
I'm not the one on trial.

1364
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,400
- Is there anything else?
- No. No, there isn't.

1365
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,960
- Deacon...
- What's going on, Deacon?

1366
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:29,440
...exactly how much money
was raised on the first Sunday?

1367
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,080
Well, I object, Your Honor.

1368
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,360
- No, I object.
- Well, everybody objects.

1369
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:34,880
Answer the damn question.

1370
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:39,960
Look, the deacon is not on trial here.
However, these two miscreants are.

1371
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:43,000
Miscreants?
We are African-American.

1372
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,080
They held members
of the church hostage!

1373
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,080
These are criminals of the first order.
Period.

1374
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,280
The counsel will sit down.

1375
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,240
And the deacon
will answer the question.

1376
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,400
- The court is waiting.
- Yeah, answer the question.

1377
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,320
Well, Your Honor...

1378
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,680
If I may, Your Honor...

1379
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:12,240
...like you, I handle lots of paperwork
each and every day.

1380
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,960
And if an error was made...

1381
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:19,720
...in my haste, I must've mistakenly
entered a three instead of a six.

1382
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:26,080
I have never known the deacon
to make a mistake.

1383
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,520
Ridiculous.
People make mistakes all the time.

1384
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:31,320
You mistakenly got caught.
That's what happened.

1385
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,400
- Are you stealing the money?
- Of course not.

1386
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,720
I'm not angry.
If you did it, just say you did it.

1387
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,800
I came here to improve the church.

1388
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,840
I didn't steal the money.
I did not steal the money.

1389
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,600
I wasn't stealing money.

1390
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,000
Look, Pastor...

1391
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,360
...I'm investing it.

1392
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,240
He's an investor now.
Is he a stockbroker or a deacon?

1393
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:57,440
Order, order! Order in the court!

1394
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,320
Invested it where?

1395
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:04,200
In an escrow account for a piece of
land I wanted the church to purchase.

1396
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,920
Who? She don't go to this church.

1397
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:10,400
We aren't affecting the community,
the community is affecting us!

1398
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,720
I'm not infected.
I have papers to prove I'm not infected.

1399
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,760
It's them! These two right here!
They're the problem!

1400
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,560
Order, I said! Order in this court!
I've had enough.

1401
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,400
- Your Honor, let me finish.
- Sit down!

1402
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,800
- Sit down!
- Tough decisions have to be made!

1403
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,640
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

1404
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,960
- Sit down.
- You're lying again.

1405
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,400
Counselor?

1406
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:34,120
You have a witness to testify
that the defendants...

1407
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,680
...held members of the church hostage
with firearms...

1408
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,240
...while attempting to steal
from Sunday's offering?

1409
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:42,000
Look, Your Honor...

1410
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,040
Actually, Your Honor...

1411
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,120
...we have a lot of witnesses here...

1412
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,960
...that are willing to testify to
a lot of things, like embezzlement.

1413
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:53,280
- Embezzlement?
- Misappropriation of funds?

1414
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,960
Falsifying documents!

1415
01:23:55,160 --> 01:24:00,280
Not to mention wearing a Easter suit
with a Halloween shirt-and-tie set.

1416
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,400
Now, that is not true!

1417
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,280
I will not have this man denigrating
my wardrobe in open court!

1418
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,320
Your Honor, can I just?

1419
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:11,400
Let me just get a second here,
and I appreciate it, Your Honor.

1420
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,680
We need to have a word.

1421
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:16,800
Listen, I just need you to go up there
and tell him what is going on!

1422
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,200
Can you please have a seat?

1423
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,960
You have a degree, don't you?
Use it!

1424
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,400
- Counselor?
- Yes?

1425
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,280
Do you have a witness or not?

1426
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,080
Your Honor, if I may?

1427
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,880
It was a very long day,
and we had three services...

1428
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,240
...normally, it's two, and it was...

1429
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,760
...late...

1430
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,240
...and hot and dark.
- And no.

1431
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:43,080
No, Your Honor,
we have no more witnesses.

1432
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,680
Your Honor, if it pleases the court...

1433
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:50,120
...I would like to motion that the case
against Durell Douglas Washington...

1434
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:52,760
...and LeeJohn
James Jacob Jackson...

1435
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:57,080
...be dismissed due to
lack of evidence and witnesses.

1436
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:02,280
Yes, and because they didn't do it.

1437
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,160
Motion granted, case dismissed.

1438
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,080
This is a travesty!

1439
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,440
Praise the Lord.

1440
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,720
Pastor! Pastor!

1441
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,720
Oh, yeah!

1442
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,920
I'm just trying to get...

1443
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,880
Ten chairs, $ 1200 apiece.

1444
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,120
Check it out.
You stole them wheelchairs...

1445
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,080
...and then somebody stole them
from us.

1446
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,320
So the way I look at that,
I think we even.

1447
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:49,440
My baby mama might have
took my son away from me today.

1448
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:52,480
And if y'all gonna kill us
over some chairs, then go ahead.

1449
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:57,720
But kill him first
because it was his dumb-ass idea.

1450
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,800
We still have business.

1451
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,400
Go get your son, man.

1452
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:10,400
- Ticktock, gunshot.
- Leave me.

1453
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:13,800
Omunique?

1454
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,400
Omunique?

1455
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:25,440
Where did you get it, huh? Where?

1456
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,880
What is this?
I don't know what this is.

1457
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,960
Rell and I were leaving for the train
station when I hear a knock.

1458
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,880
I open it, nobody's there,
just this bag...

1459
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:38,440
...filled with $ 17,342 exactly!

1460
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:41,480
You stole it, didn't you?
Did you steal this?

1461
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:44,040
I know where it came from,
but I did not steal it!

1462
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,520
If I told you,
you wouldn't even believe me.

1463
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:48,680
I wouldn't even believe me.

1464
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:53,000
Look. Now, somebody gave me
this money.

1465
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:58,280
But since we got it,
I need to know something.

1466
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,960
You staying or you going?

1467
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:02,920
- That's not fair.
- You got enough money.

1468
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:05,680
You got what you need.
What you gonna do?

1469
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,040
You gonna take my son
away from me?

1470
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,280
And move to Atlanta?

1471
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:15,720
Don't take my son from me. Okay?
That's all I got.

1472
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:21,000
All right, you wanna break me now?
He's all I got. I ain't got nothing else.

1473
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:24,000
I'll do whatever I can.
I'll come around more.

1474
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,920
Whatever you need from me,
I can do that.

1475
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,640
- I'm a different man now.
- What's different?

1476
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,760
I'm different. I'm changed.

1477
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,000
You gonna stay?

1478
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,840
What you gonna do?

1479
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,200
We're...

1480
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,640
We're gonna stay.

1481
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,480
Thank you.

1482
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,920
I told you. Didn't I tell you?
Didn't I tell you?

1483
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,800
- Yes.
- Ain't nobody gonna take you from me.

1484
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,600
Nobody.

1485
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,240
I love you.

1486
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,880
Thank you.

1487
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:48,160
<i>It was no mistake how those two boys
landed in our church.</i>

1488
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:54,560
<i>They weren't all bad,
just 180 degrees from good.</i>

1489
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:58,560
<i>They just needed a change
in direction...</i>

1490
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,600
<i>...and that's what we all need
sometimes.</i>

1491
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:28,840
<i>I figure...</i>

1492
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:33,720
<i>...if God can give these two boys
a second chance...</i>

1493
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,000
<i>...then why can't we?</i>

1494
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,320
<i>Why can't we?</i>
