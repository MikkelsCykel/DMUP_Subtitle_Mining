1
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,399
What's up?

2
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,690
You're in my fucking spot.

3
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:57,209
You're still in my fucking spot.
Are you hard of hearing?

4
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:44,539
What's up, man? That shit was
shorter than Danny DeVito.

5
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,519
Get out of here!

6
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,452
-Don't fucking touch me!
-I'm sick of these guys.

7
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:55,655
Check it out, Hong Kong.
We didn't order no Chinese food.

8
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,746
Grandpa, please. I'm leaving now...

9
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,291
-Can I help you?
-Here for the apartment.

10
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:15,467
Grandpa, someone's here
for the apartment.

11
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,309
No drugs, no smoking,
no dogs, no loud music.

12
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,733
No friends coming in and
out late at night.

13
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,367
Hola, preciosa!

14
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,496
Talk with us for a second.
Come on pretty girl.

15
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:56,083
I don't want any trouble.

16
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,263
Yo, check it out.

17
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,510
Look, I know you see me here
all the time, you don't want this?

18
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:11,307
-Chinga por Ia madre.
-Hija de Ia gran puta!

19
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,477
Fucking bitch. Kick rocks, then.

20
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,282
Hey, Theo, look over here.
It's the Chino!

21
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:45,349
Hong Kong, it costs a bill
to park here, Chino.

22
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,729
Never touch my car.

23
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:03,567
Puta, are you fucking crazy?

24
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,112
Hold the motherfucker.

25
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,960
Damn homeboy - these percs
got me all fucked up.

26
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:14,307
-What the fuck happened?
-Dash, before you get on my ass...

27
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:18,054
What the fuck happened?

28
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:23,897
This fucking chino went crazy,
smiled took my wallet, broke my arm.

29
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:29,235
-Get the fuck out of here.
-I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

30
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,860
Didn't hear?
Get the fuck out of here.

31
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:53,093
Get on this shit. We need to know
if Antuan's moving in on me.

32
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,349
-I'm sorry?
-I'll take care of it.

33
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,056
Ahora!

34
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,037
-Raise.
-Most like money, but damn.

35
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,589
One of Dash's boys just got
handled on their block-

36
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:37,178
-by one cat. You go find this dude.
Do you hear me?

37
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:43,723
If he could handle all the men by
himself, we could probably use him.

38
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:49,941
Since y'all are all blah, blah, blah,
let's see how much you want to do it.

39
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,653
All in.

40
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:31,233
I really have tried.
Some things just never change.

41
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,707
She's dead.

42
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:32,999
I tried, but I couldn't stop it.

43
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:40,798
Nothing can change that.
Put it behind you.

44
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,561
Can you do that?

45
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,722
How?

46
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,860
Stand up.

47
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:12,203
Lie on the ground.

48
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,922
Get kicked like a dog. Stand like
a man, get kicked like a man.

49
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,350
Are you angry?

50
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:36,770
You've got two tigers inside you.
A weak one, who does not believe...

51
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:41,066
...and a courageous one, who does.

52
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:44,452
Which one will win?

53
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,706
The one you feed.

54
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:27,405
Gimme the key. Ever since we run
the Dogs out, it's been good money.

55
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:33,668
Smooth like mayonnaise,
or a baby cheek.

56
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,124
Where we dropping this money?

57
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:40,667
I think...fifth row, second stack.

58
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:47,010
They could have told us all this shit
was gonna be wrapped up.

59
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,143
Mike?

60
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,227
Mikey?

61
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,149
Mike?

62
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,685
Mike?

63
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,546
So, you calling me a liar?

64
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,053
Not calling you a liar.
I call you a cheater!

65
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:30,558
You know what's your problem is.
You have a habit getting in the way.

66
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,469
Last thing you say before
I beat your ass!

67
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:37,186
You and your loco friend.
Where's the money?

68
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:40,227
Gentlemen!

69
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,950
I use that term with
the greatest liberty.

70
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:56,918
So we have a dilemma.
The floor's open.

71
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,876
He's getting greedy,
trying to break the peace.

72
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,793
This mierda puta
took the bags.

73
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,338
We made the drop.
You believe this crack head?

74
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,306
Silencio! Basta!

75
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,814
We have a more pertinent and
important dilemma here. My take.

76
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:28,484
By all accounts, the figure
should start with a three.

77
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,411
But all I've got is a two.

78
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,576
Easy... - Stop crying
and pick up the money.

79
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:44,048
Now you pick him up. Don't
look at him. Pick him up.

80
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:51,890
We're going to count the money,
in twos. Ready, set, go.

81
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:56,394
Two, four, six.

82
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:00,352
-Eight, a thousand.
-A thousand.

83
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:05,236
-Are you listening?
-Two, four, six, eight.

84
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:13,029
-Two thousand.
-Two. Not three.

85
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:17,199
-Enough.
-Not enough. You fix it.

86
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:21,666
I don't give a shit what happens
between Spics and Schwartzes.

87
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:26,292
I don't eat fried bananas and
I don't eat collard greens.

88
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:34,342
Shut up! Don't ever be short on my
cut again. Fix it by midnight.

89
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,978
Okay?

90
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,068
Messing up my business.

91
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,250
Where's my fucking money!

92
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,173
Where's my fucking money?

93
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:57,428
What does this mean?
Where's my fucking money?

94
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:04,480
We kill each and every one of these
fucking putos. Vamanos!

95
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,474
Where's the fucking money?

96
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:53,154
Is this a fucking joke to you?
What does this mean?

97
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,992
It's the symbol for change.

98
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,155
-Who did this?
-Think, man.

99
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,791
-Hong?
-Exactly.

100
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,588
Vamanos! Let's kill this puto.

101
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:16,879
Hey, Djingis. Exactly how do you
expect to get your money?

102
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,635
You can't get bread from a dead man.

103
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,649
Down on your knees!

104
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:31,220
Legs to the back.
Now, put your knees forward.

105
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:37,226
Keep your fear inside. Understand?

106
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,609
Chair.

107
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:46,523
Use the position...instinctively.

108
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:51,194
You are in enclosed
space...point of kicking.

109
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,584
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

110
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:03,377
Pow, you have connected.
I will show you.

111
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,463
You kick slowly.

112
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:12,135
Stop. There, do you see?
Much better.

113
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,301
Guard. Foot.

114
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:26,320
Relaxed.
Breathe, breathe.

115
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:30,699
That's good. Okay. Now, here.

116
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:36,072
Pull it back. Use the balance.

117
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,557
Do you have fucking problem?

118
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:27,141
Hong. Let's go.

119
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,956
Mr. Hong.

120
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,882
My grandfather's name
was Vittorio Cigno.

121
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,261
That's the English bastardization
of a beautiful name.

122
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:02,644
Victor Swan.
But you can call me Mr. V.

123
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:08,895
So why are you here?
And not the bad guys.

124
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,526
I arrested you for your protection.

125
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:16,737
-What protection?
-Same as I give everyone in town.

126
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:23,573
You want to play rough,
you play by the rules.

127
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:28,286
-Where's the money?
-At the warehouse.

128
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,626
6th row. 2nd stack.
4th from the bottom.

129
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,132
Is that so?

130
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,933
Check the warehouse. Sixth row,
second stack.

131
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,721
Fourth from the bottom,
call me when you get there.

132
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:52,235
Mr. Hong, I have to know if I can
trust you. This is Mr. Beech.

133
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:56,568
He's become a liability.
The address is on the back.

134
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:02,153
There's only one game here.
My game.

135
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,786
Very good. Well...

136
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:19,345
Welcome to St. Jude.

137
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,179
No!

138
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,593
Come in.

139
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:50,394
-How did you get out of jail?
-They let me go.

140
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:54,807
Is that how you think you're gonna
solve St. Jude's problems?

141
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,070
-It's a start.
-Until they kill you.

142
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,823
Everyone dies.

143
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:08,366
My grandfather wants you out.

144
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:14,243
If you want me to leave, I'll leave.

145
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:21,508
Just...be careful who you hurt.

146
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,014
I swear to God,
I'm losing my mind.

147
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,899
I'm not bugging,
I heard these things.

148
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:24,859
They walk around in
little shoes and shit.

149
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,824
They're in the fucking walls, Tony.

150
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:40,338
The other night, I'm laying here and
I open my eyes. See that?

151
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,715
Those motherfucking eyes are
looking at me!

152
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:47,218
What's funny?
What are you laughing about?

153
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,472
-Take it down!
-That's sacred shit!

154
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,385
-Calm down.
-I'm not high!

155
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,725
I don't have to calm down.
Don't I look calm?

156
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:01,107
I didn't come here for this shit.

157
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:07,190
-Tell me you didn't hear that.
-I didn't hear shit.

158
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,824
-There's somebody here.
-Calm down.

159
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:14,822
Get down? I'm not dying on my
knees, I'm standing on my feet.

160
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,743
-Fuck you! Fuck you!
-Sit down!

161
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,708
-Fuck you. Bring it, bitch!
-Shut up!

162
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:26,341
-You're bugging!
-Don't forget who I am.

163
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,922
-I'm burning myself.
-Sit down!

164
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:32,259
Get your ass up and
check out behind the wall.

165
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,554
-You've got the gun!
-I've got your back.

166
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,812
You go. If something happens,
I've got you.

167
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,601
And you're smoking my shit,
look at all the shit you're smoking.

168
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:47,943
Smoking shit, you're popping pills.
Get the fuck out, man.

169
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:52,409
What the fuck? You're throwing
fucking guns at me?

170
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,947
From here, I'll get that reach
and knock you out.

171
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,866
Don't trick me.

172
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,501
Towel. Oh, fuck.

173
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,165
Tony!

174
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,095
-Don't shush me!
-Shut up!

175
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,058
Look in the wall! Tony!

176
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,733
Yo, Beech.

177
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,524
-Your door is open.
-What are you, retarded?

178
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,820
-I did shut it when I got here!
-Then close it again!

179
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:41,375
-What the fuck? Tony!
-There's a guy over here!

180
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:46,209
-Who'd be in here?
-A fucking ninja!

181
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,419
-A ninja?
-I'm out of here!

182
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:53,637
You're goddamn right, you're outta
here. Get the fuck out.

183
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:20,031
No, don't kill me!

184
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,574
Bang.

185
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:26,541
I killed you, understand?

186
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:32,339
Get out of town and
never come back.

187
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,016
You're late, douchebags.

188
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:48,984
The old man don't like late.

189
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,036
-Spit it out.
-Where's our protection?

190
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,538
What are we paying you for?

191
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:06,953
The protection I provide is from the
police. You complain to me.

192
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:11,419
If you two can't handle
your own shit on the street-

193
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,009
-I'll find somebody who can.

194
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:19,093
From this day forth, you are in
partnership with Mr. Hong.

195
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,428
Split three ways.

196
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:28,145
-It's not your call, Mr. V!
-Everything in St. Jude is my call.

197
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,484
What the fuck, this is bullshit!

198
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,813
Oh, take it easy.

199
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:45,953
There's a saying from the people
where I come from.

200
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,870
Fritto il pesce, aperti cosce,
tutto va bene.

201
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:56,089
It means: Fried fish. Open thighs.
Everything's fine.

202
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,929
You work with Hong.

203
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,795
-What do you have against Hong?
-Nobody knows who he is.

204
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:26,512
Or where he came from.

205
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,676
Does it matter?

206
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:32,939
I don't trust anything
that's too good to be true.

207
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:42,737
Do you know what
Sluder's Syndrome is?

208
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:46,324
It's when a person with a chronic
disease is cured.

209
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:50,457
And they missed the disease.

210
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,789
Because they don't know
how to live without it.

211
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:41,212
Mr. Lord, you're looking fit. I wish
you hadn't chosen this shithole.

212
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:47,052
Apologize. I hear you have
problem in St. Jude.

213
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:52,640
-You're hard of hearing.
-Devil Dogs can take care of ninja.

214
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:55,726
The one who give you the problem.

215
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:59,609
Problems? Mr. Lord, we've got no
problems in St. Jude.

216
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:03,192
Matter of fact, in St. Jude,
we have no problem.

217
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:09,487
The kids are swinging and the roses
are growing in the town square.

218
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:13,748
I got no business with you.
You got no business in St. Jude.

219
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:17,877
Okay, bro. Whatever you say.

220
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:22,086
Alright, bro.

221
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,568
It is because he did not understand.

222
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:56,288
Bang. Don't think about the gun.
Think about the man.

223
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,827
Come in.

224
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,948
Hey.

225
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:45,923
The neighbors are just very happy.

226
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,170
Tell them I said "thank you".

227
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:56,301
Fuck you!
Don't mess with the Devil Dogs.

228
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,895
What the fuck?

229
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,947
I'll fuck you up now.

230
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:51,273
Three rules you live by.
One: don't harm civilians.

231
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:55,535
Two: no dealing to kids. Adults only.

232
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,242
The price of a bag goes up by half.

233
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,827
All transactions are pushed
to the borders.

234
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,460
Three: no guns.
Only cowards use guns.

235
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:09,090
-And the Devil Dogs.
-Shut up when the man is speaking.

236
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,422
Understand?

237
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,797
You heard him?

238
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:37,694
-Is it too much to ask for a croissant?
-Perfetto.

239
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,158
Mr. V!

240
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,879
-Sgt. Howe here is very very upset.
-So?

241
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:54,010
So? So. What's all this
about a “new way"?

242
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:57,342
-What do you mean, "new way"?
-Let him finish.

243
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,967
Disarming your men.
Are you fucking nuts?

244
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:05,309
It's too damned close
to the Devil Dog territory.

245
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,600
They can't afford the prices,
but are buying anyway..

246
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:13,112
That's just bad business.

247
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:18,243
-The floor is open.
-If I may...

248
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:23,077
The people of St. Jude feel safer.

249
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,539
They say we cleaned it up.

250
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,829
Is that what they say?

251
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:35,469
It seems to me the police force
should be keeping the people safe.

252
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:39,464
So I have an idea. You do your job
and you do your job.

253
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:44,477
And don't come here telling other
people how to do theirs.

254
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,772
Capito.

255
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,195
I say let's eat.

256
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,585
Come to Papa.

257
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,084
Fuck!

258
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:38,481
Howe. Stop whatever you're doing
with that bitch and call me now.

259
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:45,283
Call me. I don't know where you are,
but get to your phone.

260
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,535
Dial my number, call me.

261
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,913
Something is missing.
I think you know what it is.

262
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:56,874
So get to the phone and
call me now. Got it?

263
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:03,046
Fuck!

264
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:10,092
Where's Feldman?

265
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,557
Yes, it's Mr. V,
now where's Feldman?

266
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,144
-What would I want with him?
-I don't know.

267
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:24,443
There's something happening. I don't
know what it is. Stay by your phone.

268
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,797
Feldman!

269
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:58,648
-You're so fucking hot.
-Shut up, pig.

270
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,234
I'm naughty.

271
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:09,992
You slut, you can do better than
that, bitch. Come on.

272
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:16,286
Shut the fuck up.

273
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:20,620
-What the fuck?
-Where's my money?

274
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,793
I don't know. Watch what
you're doing, man.

275
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:27,836
-Step aside.
-What the fuck?

276
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:31,597
-Come on, man.
-Wear this. Let me show you how.

277
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:35,885
-Where's my money?
-I don't know what the...

278
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:40,306
You and Feldman know where the
money was. Where's Feldman?

279
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:44,102
-I don't know.
-Hold your fist like this.

280
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:50,571
-Are you learning something here?
-Yes, sir.

281
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:55,113
-Take one. Spin that.
-I don't know where Feldman is.

282
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:59,079
I swear to God, I'm not that stupid.

283
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:04,042
-Lay off the croissants, Howe.
-Please, please. Come on!

284
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:08,254
-I'm going to shoot your weewee.
-Please, I swear to God.

285
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,762
-Where's Feldman?
-Please, I don't...

286
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,016
Ready? Oh, that was one.

287
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:21,147
-Here's two. No.
-I didn't. I didn't.

288
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:26,895
-Where's Feldman? Here's three.
-Please, you're making a mistake.

289
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:31,316
-No!
-Say goodbye to weewee. Click.

290
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:35,532
-Here comes four.
-No!

291
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:41,534
Shut up.

292
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:47,673
Alright.

293
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:52,302
This is a mistake. Please don't.
No, God, boss.

294
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:01,767
Hang up your makeup, fat boy.
We've got work to do.

295
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,899
Thank you, doll.

296
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,205
Mr. V wants to see you.

297
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:23,664
Come on, Hong, don't bust my balls.

298
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:29,666
-What's going on?
-I don't know, he don't tell me shit.

299
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:35,505
Feldman ripped him off. Now he don't
trust no one but you.

300
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:38,971
Maybe he wants you to kill him.

301
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:48,438
Get in the car. Please.
it's been a long day.

302
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,094
Here we are.

303
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:26,435
Mr. V's right over here. I'm getting
hungry, you want a sandwich?

304
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:34,901
Yeah.

305
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,509
Hey, there he is.

306
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:00,799
You sleep okay?

307
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,763
You got a phone call.

308
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:11,104
I'm disappointed, Hong. I thought you
were a man I could trust.

309
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,485
I was mistaken.

310
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:19,196
You didn't deliver on
a single favor I asked you.

311
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,502
You know this guy? Hey, asshole!

312
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:37,927
-Is this the guy who killed you?
-I don't know him!

313
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:40,554
Let me talk, please!

314
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:45,725
Oops.

315
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,768
Here.

316
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:55,812
Officer Fizar.

317
00:55:55,978 --> 00:56:00,233
I'd like you to meet Mr. Hong.

318
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,824
Hello, Mr. Hong,
it's nice to meet you.

319
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,068
Hard head, right?

320
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:25,170
Here's your phone.
Keep it in your pocket next time.

321
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:30,841
Let's get these guys in a box.

322
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:58,039
Mr. V? Feldman. Yeah, we got him.

323
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,212
Did you put a bullet in his brain?

324
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:09,050
I'm sorry?

325
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:15,720
Feldman, tell me
you put a bullet in his brain.

326
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:21,234
-Mr. V, he's dead, no question.
-Are you fucking kidding me?

327
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:27,190
You stay where you are.
I'm coming down there.

328
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:50,216
-It's been a good day.
-Where is he?

329
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:54,474
Where's his head? Here?

330
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,940
Open it.

331
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,233
Shit!

332
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:20,501
No, no, no! Howe, come on.
Mr. V, the guy put him in the box.

333
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:24,580
We got him. Mr. V, we got him.

334
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:29,877
No, you didn't.

335
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:31,332
What you guys want?

336
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:36,004
Motherfuckers got business here?

337
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:10,545
-You're trying my patience, Mr. Lord.
-It's what I do.

338
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:23,092
You don't have to try any longer.

339
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:35,358
-What about the ninja?
-He's gone.

340
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,773
Do we have a deal?

341
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:47,248
We have deal, bro.

342
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,418
Yes, bro.

343
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,838
You're the man now.

344
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:55,810
You think your life is over?

345
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:03,571
-I killed her.
-And there's no changing that.

346
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:08,201
But that doesn't mean
you should also die.

347
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:20,255
I made a mistake once in a
moment of fury.

348
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:26,639
I killed my own son.

349
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:38,522
On that first day, in the yard,
I thought of my son.

350
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,275
They say my rage is inside of you.

351
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:48,573
I will never forgive myself.

352
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,984
Neven

353
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:56,907
But I must still
do good in this world.

354
01:07:57,073 --> 01:08:00,202
And so should you.

355
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:06,424
You have the dragon eyes.
The spirit of the grand masters.

356
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:11,596
But you have strayed from your path.

357
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:21,891
When you get out, there is
something I need you to do for me.

358
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:30,400
There is a town called St. Jude.
A town that has fallen into darkness.

359
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:34,953
You must go there.

360
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:58,870
Okay, Hong. Wherever you are.

361
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:12,292
Back in Da Nang, there was guy
in the platoon... Coakley.

362
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:19,011
We didn't pay much attention to him.

363
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:24,805
And one day we got ambushed.
Six of us pinned down in heavy fire.

364
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:31,229
Then... a VietCong hand grenade
drops in to finish us off.

365
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:38,907
We were six sitting ducks,
everyone kissing their ass goodbye.

366
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:42,072
Except Coakley.

367
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:48,291
He goes gung-ho, dives on it
and covers it up with his helmet.

368
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:50,751
And then boom.

369
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,801
Not a scratch.

370
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,964
Damndest thing I ever saw.

371
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:04,512
Platoon got so inspired,
we jumped up and started firing.

372
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:11,313
Standing there in the wide open,
fighting back.

373
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,480
Fighting back.

374
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:21,744
In that moment, we were invincible.

375
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:31,166
I know who you are. You're Coakley.

376
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:38,095
-I'm not Coakley.
-Yeah, well. I'm not Tiano.

377
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,850
You kept calling me that last night.

378
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:47,729
I haven't heard that name in a while.

379
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:52,897
Your car, that's his ride.

380
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:56,855
Right?

381
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:05,615
He was from St. Jude. The only one
that could stand up to the gangs.

382
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,960
Nothing's been the same since he
went away.

383
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:30,009
Who is this guy? Word on the street
is he's a fucking ghost.

384
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:34,054
Word on the street,
this is your job, to find the ghost.

385
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,724
I know you'll take care of it,
move out of the way.

386
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,902
Mira esta!

387
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:52,080
Make money instead of losing money.
Your bro just lost his damn money.

388
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:55,833
Whose Timex watch is this?
I don't take Timex.

389
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:04,213
-We were just talking about you.
-I heard.

390
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:33,871
-What the fuck!
-I decide when you breathe. Understand?

391
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:37,125
Go to hell!

392
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:40,457
Call Mr. V.
Tell him we want to meet.

393
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,418
What? Who the fuck
do you think you are?

394
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:49,132
Okay, stop. Stop, stop!
Alright.

395
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:54,472
-Call him.
-Okay. Just loosen your grip.

396
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:10,025
Mr. V? Seargent Feldman.

397
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:54,730
Lazarus, risen from the grave.

398
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:58,271
Albeit it a little bloody.

399
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:03,818
Where's my money, Hong?

400
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,829
I got your money.

401
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:13,707
-Where is it?
-You'll leave St. Jude?

402
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:17,043
Then I'll give you your money.

403
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:23,804
I capito.

404
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:28,054
Better go now.

405
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:01,501
Where's my money?

406
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:09,888
Or what?

407
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:12,644
You're going to shoot me with that?
