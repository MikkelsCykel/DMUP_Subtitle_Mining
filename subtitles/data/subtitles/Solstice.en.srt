It was after we got

And I was at this crosswalk
across from St.Jackson's.

00:45:17,392 --> 00:45:21,190
There was this group of people
across the street waiting for the light.

They were all dressed in black. They must have
been on their way to a funeral or something.

there's this girl across the street
underneath an umbrella.

It's her clothes.

and I'm just standin' there, you know?

What do you mean?

595
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:14,724
In Haitian folklore
twins are called the Marasa.

596
00:49:14,734 --> 00:49:17,317
They're believed to be
two halves of the same soul...

I don't have to.

00:49:36,493 --> 00:49:38,694
She had this when she died.

604
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:42,180
It's hard to explain, but...

605
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,869
every time I leave it somewhere...

606
00:49:44,878 --> 00:49:46,756
it comes back to me.

607
00:49:46,766 --> 00:49:49,732
Voduns believe objects
that follow people around...

608
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:52,595
are usually associated with curses.

609
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,900
[Sighs]
So you're saying I'm cursed?

610
00:49:56,909 --> 00:50:01,796
Really depends whether or not
you believe in that sort of thing.

611
00:50:01,805 --> 00:50:04,740
I don't know what I believe anymore.

612
00:50:06,286 --> 00:50:08,200
[Sighs]
Tell you what.

613
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:11,524
Now you may think
I'm the one who's crazy...

614
00:50:11,534 --> 00:50:15,609
but we can do this thing
my grandmother used to do.

615
00:50:15,694 --> 00:50:19,012
[Nick] It was her way.
of trying to communicate with the dead.

616
00:50:19,022 --> 00:50:21,028

I got wine in my face.

00:50:40,525 --> 00:50:42,443
You "wined" me.

622
00:50:42,478 --> 00:50:45,028
So this is the part
where we drink the Kool-Aid, right?

623
00:50:45,037 --> 00:50:47,908
Yeah. Can I ask why we have to
do this in the water?

624
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:51,556
Well, they say water's the best conductor
between our world and the next, so-

625
00:50:51,566 --> 00:50:53,860
Right. Right.

Megan, you should
just lay down. Please.

Oh, that's enough.

We're their ride back.
We can't just leave 'em here.

839
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,891
I don't trust that Nick guy. And there's
something up with all of his voodoo crap!

We were terrified of this place
when we were kids.

01:12:32,388 --> 01:12:36,464
Megan, what can you
possibly hope to find out here?

848
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:41,698

- You're my problem. You're everybody's problem.

Who the hell do you think you are?

You Cajun freaks like messing
with people's heads? Is that it?

859
01:13:08,164 --> 01:13:10,283
Shut up!
Christian, please.

Yes! No! Shut up!

Um, we're gonna go to the bridge
and we're gonna have the police-

Isn't that your sister's?

I thought it was.

Why would your sister
have a key to Malin's bike?

01:18:51,842 --> 01:18:54,176

Come back here!

You don't understand!

960
01:19:22,626 --> 01:19:25,146
Somebody help me!

961
01:19:27,841 --> 01:19:29,368
Don't go!

962
01:19:29,377 --> 01:19:31,963
Megan!

963
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:39,002

No!

No!

967
01:19:49,697 --> 01:19:52,185
It was an accident!

968
01:19:54,785 --> 01:19:56,703
Malin, I'm sorry!

969

[Police Radio Chatter]

971
01:20:06,273 --> 01:20:08,924
God! I didn't see him.

972
01:20:08,993 --> 01:20:10,903
- [Megan Screaming] No!
- I didn't see him.

973
01:20:10,913 --> 01:20:14,328
No! No! No!

974
01:20:14,401 --> 01:20:16,319

[Police Radio Chatter Continues]

977
01:20:43,233 --> 01:20:45,502
Hey, baby.

978
01:20:45,569 --> 01:20:47,487
It's okay.

979
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:51,287
It's gonna be all right.

980
01:20:51,297 --> 01:20:54,069
I can't believe this is happening.

981
01:21:22,465 --> 01:21:27,543
[Nick] I wanted to let you know, Megan,
that I ran into Leonard the other day.

982
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:31,058
He wanted me to thank you
for finding Malin.

983
01:21:39,393 --> 01:21:41,367
[Megan]
I went by his place this morning.

984
01:21:41,377 --> 01:21:43,295
He wasn't home.

985
01:21:44,353 --> 01:21:47,003
It's probably just as well.

986
01:21:50,721 --> 01:21:53,981
- You just get off work?
- Yup. Last day.

987
01:21:54,016 --> 01:21:56,534
- One more week and I 'm out of here.
- [Chuckling]

988
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:58,454
What, um- What about you?

989
01:21:58,464 --> 01:22:03,287
Just wanted to see this place
one last time before my folks sell it.

990
01:22:03,297 --> 01:22:05,215
Understandable.

991
01:22:07,649 --> 01:22:10,398
- Maybe when you come to the city,
I can show you around.

992
01:22:10,408 --> 01:22:11,190
That'd be great.

993
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:14,844
-Just no more black magic.
- You got it.
