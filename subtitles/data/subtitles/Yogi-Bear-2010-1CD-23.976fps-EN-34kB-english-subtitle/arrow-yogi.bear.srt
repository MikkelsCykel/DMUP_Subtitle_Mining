1
00:00:20,637 --> 00:00:22,434
<i>Jellystone Park.</i>

2
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:27,565
<i>One of the nation's oldest and most</i>
<i>beautiful stretches of wilderness.</i>

3
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:31,475
<i>For years, families have headed out</i>
<i>from the busy city...</i>

4
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:34,811
<i>... eager to enjoy a little camping,</i>
<i>fishing...</i>

5
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:40,650
<i>...and, of course,</i>
<i>observing the park's natural wildlife.</i>

6
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:53,129
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced
myself to that pic-a-nic basket.

7
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:57,501
You know, Yogi,
we could just hunt for food.

8
00:00:57,707 --> 00:00:59,140
All the other animals do.

9
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:03,740
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has
everything a bear needs.

10
00:01:03,913 --> 00:01:08,145
And I'm not just talking about the treats
and snack-type goodies. No.

11
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,481
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more
than that.

12
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:15,317
It holds dreams.

13
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:17,791
What are we looking at?

14
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:19,485
I don't know.

15
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,686
Hook me in.

16
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:22,798
You sure it'll work, Yogi?

17
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:25,867
Well, you know, Boo Boo,
I'm smarter than the average bear!

18
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:38,371
All right!

19
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,106
Ranger Smith!

20
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:16,413
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.

21
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:18,281
- A what?
- A bear disturbance.

22
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:20,718
- I think it's probably...
- I know who it is.

23
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:23,392
Why didn't you just say
"bear disturbance"?

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,925
Well, I...

25
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,863
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.

26
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:30,761
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:

27
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:34,063
"To protect and preserve."

28
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,761
Did you just make that motto up?

29
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,304
Yeah, I did. Do you like it?

30
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:43,038
Ranger Jones, you know that, well,
being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.

31
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:44,737
It's about keeping the park safe.

32
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,350
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.

33
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:52,420
Yeah, I know. Besides,
that motto was still in the testing phase.

34
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,353
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.

35
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:59,723
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.

36
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:02,727
Okay, copy that, sir.

37
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:05,561
Um, I'm actually gonna hop
in the Armadillo, make some rounds.

38
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:09,398
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is
for head ranger use only.

39
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:12,336
I might need it at any moment to deal
with a park emergency.

40
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:14,772
Why don't you finish stacking
those trail maps?

41
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,970
Yeah, sure. Okay.

42
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:22,945
Yeah, because that's what future
head rangers do, they stack maps.

43
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,381
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

44
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:27,648
Our days of getting banged up
to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.

45
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:31,624
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are
going to fall into our arms.

46
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,852
Soldering iron.

47
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:35,190
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

48
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:37,526
Okay. That should do it. Test rock.

49
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:40,260
Okay, Yogi.

50
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:42,594
Weight sensor triggered.

51
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,364
Basket in position.

52
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,235
Launch spring starts coiling.

53
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:48,809
Firing pin drops. And...

54
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,508
Bull's-eye!

55
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:54,847
I'm so smart it hurts!

56
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:57,145
You're standing on the soldering iron.

57
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,344
Or it's that.

58
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:01,713
Hot, hot, hot!

59
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,387
There's the test rock.

60
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:08,696
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket
to fall into our arms.

61
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:12,198
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you...

62
00:04:12,368 --> 00:04:14,836
A genius never questions his instincts,
Boo Boo.

63
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,596
When you have a mind like mine...

64
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:19,901
...you can't blink or you'll put a kink
in your think.

65
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:22,677
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

66
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,608
We've got our first customers.

67
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:27,807
And they have pie!

68
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,152
I wonder what kind it is.

69
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,981
Yogi, are you out here?

70
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:33,554
- It's Mr. Ranger.
- Aah!

71
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:37,490
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence. I was never here.

72
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,854
Look... Ow!

73
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:41,896
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.

74
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,689
Did you just...?

75
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:48,268
Did you guys...? Did you...?
Oh, never mind.

76
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:51,930
Look, there was a complaint about a bear
interfering with a family picnic.

77
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:55,441
I see. And you'd like us to mount
some sort of investigation?

78
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:57,243
No, I think it was you.

79
00:04:57,413 --> 00:05:00,712
What?! How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?

80
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,851
Let me press my lips against
your forehead.

81
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:07,886
Wait! You're not pressing your lips
against my forehead.

82
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,617
Hey, it's a lot better than the way
they take my temperature.

83
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:15,226
No, look, Yogi,
we've been over this many times.

84
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:19,027
Bears are supposed to avoid people,
not run around stealing their food.

85
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:22,660
I agree, sir. That's why my friend Boo Boo
and I would never think...

86
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,568
...of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.

87
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:32,314
Huh. It missed.

88
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:38,042
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.

89
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:40,212
We'll keep our eyes peeled.

90
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,948
I wonder if he noticed the pie.

91
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:46,461
<i>Ra... Smith. You have a vis... Over.</i>

92
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:48,494
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.

93
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:51,633
- Sorry. Some lady's here to see you.
- Send her in.

94
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:54,497
- Okay. I'll be in the Armadillo.
- Or you could be...

95
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,228
- Map stacking?
- Map stacking.

96
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,165
- Ranger Smith?
- Yes.

97
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,443
- Hello. I'm Rachel Johnson.
- Hi.

98
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,776
I was hoping to talk to you about
filming a documentary here.

99
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,645
Sure. I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.

100
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:12,481
Sorry. My work isn't...
My brain isn't working right.

101
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:15,021
- I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
- Oh.

102
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:18,456
<i>Datura stramonium</i>.
It's known to cause delirium...

103
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,755
...cramping and nausea. Heh.
- Cramping and nausea.

104
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,194
You've read
<i>The North American Wilderness Guide.</i>

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,959
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants
and animals I see.

106
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,197
- I like to... Me too.
- Ha, ha! Yeah.

107
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:37,603
Ranger Smith. At your service.

108
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,839
You want to film a documentary
in Jellystone?

109
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:42,041
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.

110
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:45,320
- Written on a piece of bark.
- That was you!

111
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,979
Yes. I'm sorry about that.

112
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:52,150
I was in Sumatra,
living among the orangutans at the time...

113
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,729
...and they get very nervous if they spot
anything from the modern world.

114
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:57,195
Really? Wow, that's amazing.

115
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:59,534
Then what did you use for ink?

116
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:01,033
Bird poop and spit.

117
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,496
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?

118
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,165
Well, I was hoping to shoot
a local species.

119
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,005
Something to really capture the beauty
of a national park.

120
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,010
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?

121
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,172
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.

122
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,578
- Brown bear?
- Yes.

123
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,343
One that talks? Those are so rare.

124
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,683
- None that I can think of.
- Named Yogi? Wears a hat and a tie?

125
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,256
No, that doesn't ring a bell.

126
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:25,826
I think he's standing on the roof,
trying to steal your lunchbox.

127
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:29,530
I smell PB and J.

128
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:34,998
I'm all done.

129
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:39,774
Oh, right. That Yogi.

130
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:46,371
Bankrupt? No, no, no. We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.

131
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,141
They do when they're broke, sir.

132
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:50,308
We just have to find some money
somewhere.

133
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:51,885
I'm about to run for governor.

134
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,454
How am I gonna do that
when my own city is bankrupt?

135
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:57,218
Okay, yes. Thank you.

136
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,988
- Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
- Yikes! Wow. Ha.

137
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:02,859
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.

138
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,694
Just bill it to the city, okay? Thank you.

139
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,927
Ugh. How did we ever go so broke?

140
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:12,336
- I think we just spent too much.
- Hmm. Is there anything we can sell?

141
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:15,375
You already sold the public golf course
to condo developers...

142
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:18,480
...two of the three fire stations to
that frozen yogurt company.

143
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:20,912
You were selling the library,
but it burned down.

144
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,416
Oh, yeah. That was gonna be one of
those make-your-own-doughnut places.

145
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,645
- No.
- Yeah.

146
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:28,483
- If you could dream it up, you could make it.
- Ah. Love those.

147
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:30,849
We gotta think of something here.

148
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:35,123
Well, if we don't have anything to sell,
maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.

149
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:36,959
I don't understand those words.

150
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:40,569
Like when we sold the bottling rights
to the water in Lake Beuclair.

151
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:42,067
- We made a fortune.
- Yeah.

152
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:44,934
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place
to throw old mattresses.

153
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,369
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm.

154
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:50,740
We just don't have any more resources
to exploit.

155
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:53,214
Or do we?

156
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,144
Jellystone.

157
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:59,118
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural
land, we can sell the logging rights.

158
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,312
Here.

159
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:03,481
This company says they'll give us
thousands of dollars an acre...

160
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:06,127
...just to cut down the trees
or something.

161
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:11,790
That'll be enough to balance the budget
and give each citizen a big fat check.

162
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:17,466
You have any idea how many votes
that'll buy me?

163
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,269
- Enough to be the next governor?
- Exactly.

164
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:24,539
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.

165
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:28,241
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.

166
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:31,147
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.

167
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,013
And you wouldn't be able to eat.

168
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:35,481
I'm okay!

169
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:40,118
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce
you to Rachel Johnson...

170
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,321
...who's here to make a nature
documentary.

171
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,969
What the heck was that?

172
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:50,128
I was saying hello.

173
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:52,831
I lived in a den with brown bears
for six months.

174
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,909
Only bear I've ever lived with
is Boo Boo.

175
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:58,205
And he only makes that sound after
he's eaten baked beans. Heh, heh.

176
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:00,849
I have problems with baked beans.

177
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,986
And for a little bear,
he makes a lot of stink.

178
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:08,317
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters
you can film instead.

179
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:14,157
- Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
- No, you know, I really, really like these two.

180
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,161
- Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
- Huh?

181
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,497
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.

182
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,936
Yes. Of course with a camera.

183
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:27,542
Heh-heh-heh. I knew that.

184
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,871
But not just any camera.

185
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,909
This isn't gonna make me look fat,
is it?

186
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,108
No, you are gonna look great.

187
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:39,550
Okay, just a few more adjustments.

188
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,883
Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.

189
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,855
My mornings are often rushed.

190
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:48,759
It's fine, Boo Boo. This is going to be
a whole new perspective for a documentary.

191
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:53,766
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true
wilderness in all its natural glory.

192
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:55,460
No other human in sight.

193
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:57,606
That sounds like my apartment. Ha, ha.

194
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:03,475
Uh, you know, because I live alone.

195
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:05,841
Well, plenty of women have tried
to change that.

196
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,744
It's just, I haven't found one that...

197
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,011
- Likes you?
- What? No. No, that...

198
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:12,245
Will return your calls?

199
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,820
Can you stop helping, please?

200
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:16,856
Sir, I can see you like this lady.

201
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:19,187
But your courting rituals need work.

202
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:23,423
What you need to do is follow her around
for two days making snorting sounds.

203
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,362
Then fight any male that looks at her.

204
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:28,867
And then, of course, urinate on her
to mark her as your territory.

205
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:30,164
Works every time.

206
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:31,931
I got it under control, Yogi.

207
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,009
- Boo Boo, you're rolling.
- Cool.

208
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:39,671
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found
in North America and Alaska.

209
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:44,843
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears
are also the national animal of Finland.

210
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,783
I don't think you have to narrate.

211
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,322
But I liked where you were going with it,
Boo Boo.

212
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:51,255
- I was hooked.
- Really?

213
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:55,261
Yes. Now try to film from flattering angles,
if you know what I mean.

214
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:59,868
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the
lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.

215
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:11,304
Oh, no.

216
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,743
Ranger Smith! Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.

217
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,245
What's he doing here?

218
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,446
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.

219
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:23,285
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.

220
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:26,656
Jones, you know
I'm the only other ranger here, right?

221
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,921
Yeah.

222
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:31,364
- Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
- You could've just called.

223
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:33,764
Yeah, but I thought
this would be more friendly.

224
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,097
I'm really working on my people skills.

225
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:38,433
Anyway, I am closing your park down.

226
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:41,868
- Okay.
- What?

227
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:45,042
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city
way too much money.

228
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:48,513
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget
in 10 years.

229
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,653
You know, it's hard to compete with
all those amusement parks...

230
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:55,382
Oh, hey, you're not kidding. Oh, have you
guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?

231
00:12:55,558 --> 00:13:00,291
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster
there, it's made completely out of logs.

232
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:03,557
It's just like they rode in the
pioneer days. It's unbelievable.

233
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:08,567
Sir, Jellystone is special. Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.

234
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:11,638
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.

235
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:14,871
Well, uh, you actually
don't have a choice.

236
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:17,336
Have you read the city bylaws lately?

237
00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:19,777
Chapter 6. Section 73.

238
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:22,645
"Any municipal property
that can't generate enough money...

239
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:24,445
...to cover its operating budget...

240
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,713
...can be rezoned for other uses."

241
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:31,053
And since Jellystone loses money
every year, we're shutting it down.

242
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:35,758
Uh, sorry?

243
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,224
- I thought that went well.
- Yeah.

244
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:41,692
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.

245
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:45,466
Who says we can't cover our budget? Park
doesn't report earnings till next quarter.

246
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:47,336
Yeah, which is like one week away.

247
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,274
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.

248
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:53,882
We wish. Yeah. Try 30,562.

249
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,214
That's probably a couple hundred extra
for the map stand.

250
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,020
I think it's confession time.

251
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:05,422
- I only pretended to fix it.
- Thanks, Jones.

252
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,824
Sounds like you're in pretty deep
there, Smith.

253
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:12,093
Maybe we are. But this is one of the last
places families can go to be close to nature.

254
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,292
The world needs that.

255
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:15,334
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.

256
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:17,665
I'm mayor of this city.

257
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,001
And this city needs this park rezoned.

258
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:21,642
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,471
I feel awful about it.

260
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:25,375
Even though I look really good.

261
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:28,142
This is a new suit.

262
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:31,285
So, okay.

263
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,513
Maybe we don't have our operating
budget today. But you know what?

264
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,251
- A lot can happen in a week.
- All right. Have it your way. Take a week.

265
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:42,090
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?

266
00:14:42,264 --> 00:14:43,322
Four dollars.

267
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:45,797
Four dollars, huh? Four whole dollars?

268
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,095
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.

269
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,467
Well, I only need to come back in here
like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?

270
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,842
In a week! Do I have time for that?

271
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:57,603
- Impossible.
- Oh, shoot.

272
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:04,876
<i>You want-a some-a lasagna?</i>

273
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:06,351
You hungry, buddy?

274
00:15:06,522 --> 00:15:08,387
Of course! I'm always hungry.

275
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:10,422
I was talking to my pet turtle.

276
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:11,651
Here you go.

277
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,660
That better not be my beef jerky.

278
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:20,829
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?

279
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,834
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.

280
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,597
It's my masterpiece.

281
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:26,707
The Basket-Nabber 2000.

282
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:30,276
The most advanced pic-a-nic
basket-stealing technology ever invented.

283
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,141
Wow.

284
00:15:32,314 --> 00:15:33,747
Climb aboard.

285
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,645
This glider can steer...

286
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:39,185
...dive, shoot rubber bands at
pesky-type birds...

287
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,152
...and even has an air bag.

288
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,386
Had an air bag.

289
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,027
Sorry, Yogi.

290
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:50,188
Not to worry. We could cushion our landing
with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.

291
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,766
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?

292
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:55,836
A little wobbly,
like it's not tied on very tight.

293
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:57,438
You won't feel that in the air.

294
00:15:57,606 --> 00:16:00,370
Get ready to fly faster than the speed
of sandwich, Boo Boo.

295
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,534
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.

296
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,509
- Yogi!
- Uh-oh.

297
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:08,206
That's not his happy voice.

298
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,217
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.

299
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,513
Stealth mode?

300
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:15,248
Wow. How are you able to...?

301
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:16,857
Oh.

302
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,690
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir. Welcome.

303
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:24,026
Can I interest you in a sody pop?

304
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,297
- There you go.
- When did you steal our vending machine?

305
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,563
I, um... I'm repairing it, sir.

306
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,606
This machine gives its sodas away
for free when a bear kicks it.

307
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:36,711
Look, a camper has reported some
missing fishing poles...

308
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,746
...so I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it was you.

309
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,713
Fishing poles? Sir, I'm a bear.

310
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:46,116
If I wanted to catch fish,
I would just use my...

311
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:47,781
Your paws, Yogi.

312
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:51,891
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?

313
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,559
What's that?

314
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,890
- What's what?
- That thing.

315
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:57,965
- What thing?
- The thing under the blanket.

316
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:00,624
- Blanket?
- The object right behind you.

317
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:02,896
Oh. Oh, that. Heh.

318
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:04,733
A sculpture.

319
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:08,308
I'm sculpting now. Mostly landscapes.

320
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:09,808
And where's Boo Boo?

321
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:11,468
- France.
- What?

322
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:14,514
- That's not close by, is it?
- No.

323
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:16,617
Then he's in the bathroom.

324
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,979
- Excuse me.
- Wait!

325
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,681
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.

326
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:29,654
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger,
it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.

327
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:32,860
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000"
right here, Yogi.

328
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:35,833
I do regret calling it that now.

329
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:38,802
I know I'm always saying,
"Stay away from the campers."

330
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,636
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.

331
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:45,880
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week,
this park's getting rezoned.

332
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:48,243
Rezoned? What does that mean?

333
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:50,351
It means the park won't
be a park anymore.

334
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,714
The city will use this land
for something else.

335
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:55,584
So we have got to do everything
we can to help save it.

336
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:59,990
Which means you have gotta stop stealing
food so that campers will leave here happy.

337
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,629
But they do leave here happy.

338
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:05,893
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear
is special. People come here for that.

339
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:09,162
It's like catching a foul ball
at a baseball game.

340
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,796
Nope. It's like getting your food stolen
at a baseball game.

341
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:16,376
Come on, Yogi. Would it really be so hard
to be a regular bear?

342
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:19,378
You know, to forage for food,
to walk around on all fours...

343
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:21,914
...to hibernate a little, or a lot.

344
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:24,450
If nature had meant for me
to be a regular bear...

345
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,418
...it wouldn't have given me
such a good thought-cooker, sir.

346
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:30,080
I can't help it if my melon is
full of smart juice.

347
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,693
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.

348
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,853
There are repercussions to stealing
people's picnic baskets.

349
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:37,326
Not in my experience, sir.

350
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:45,766
On the other hand...

351
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:51,244
Ranger Smith,
mind if I borrow the 'dilla?

352
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:54,109
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.

353
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:59,414
Jones, I would really prefer it if you
focused on just maintaining the park instead.

354
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:02,489
Let me deal with the visitors
until you've had more experience.

355
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:06,219
Sorry, sir. Guess that's just
the Eagle Scout in me, you know?

356
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,023
Always wanting to be in control,
be a leader.

357
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:12,561
Live up to this fanny pack
full of merit badges.

358
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,396
You know that fanny pack is for
first aid supplies, right?

359
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,233
A merit badge in first aid is the only
supply I need, sir.

360
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,638
Right, but it might not be the only
supply a hurt person needs.

361
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,072
You seen Rachel?

362
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,146
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.

363
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:29,413
She can't be far. I'll drive. Let's roll.

364
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:33,550
Jones.

365
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,701
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.

366
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:54,776
A timeless stretch of wilderness
untouched by man.

367
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:57,210
Oh.

368
00:19:57,512 --> 00:19:58,672
Ranger Smith.

369
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,781
Wow, heh.

370
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,611
What's with the fancy outfit?

371
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,614
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.

372
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,780
You know, in case there's, you know...

373
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,789
- I don't know how to talk to girls.
- Oh.

374
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,394
Why do you think
I spend so much time with animals?

375
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:18,363
All you have to do is scratch their backside
and you've got a friend for life.

376
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,658
Try that with people...

377
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:23,965
...and all of a sudden you're the weird girl
on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.

378
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:29,271
Um, uh, listen. I was wondering, you know,
if you were...

379
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:33,039
I mean, it's getting late and
we could, uh... If you want.

380
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:35,183
I mean, it's not that...
You don't... It's...

381
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,443
You know, it's not a worry. Don't worry.

382
00:20:37,786 --> 00:20:39,219
Did you just ask me to dinner?

383
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:41,720
Yes. I did. Heh.

384
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,120
- Good, you got that, huh?
- Yes.

385
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:47,990
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.

386
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,155
- Very gourmet.
- Really? Where?

387
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,891
So close you won't believe it.

388
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,468
Wow, how did you ever find this place?

389
00:20:57,639 --> 00:20:59,004
This is a four-star porch.

390
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,837
And fresh from the hot plate,
I give you...

391
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:06,646
...rack of Spam.
- Oh.

392
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:08,949
Wow.

393
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:10,948
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.

394
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,916
No, it actually looks wonderful.

395
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:15,883
Great.

396
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:19,556
You know, this really is a peaceful place.

397
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:22,253
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.

398
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:24,763
My father was a ranger
when I was a kid...

399
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:28,630
...and he turned this park into the number
one tourist destination in the state.

400
00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:32,035
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds...

401
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:35,472
...swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.

402
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:36,668
This is really good.

403
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:39,075
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.

404
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:42,307
I spent so many years learning everything
I could about the park...

405
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:43,849
...so I'd be a better ranger.

406
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:47,716
Maybe instead, I should have come up
with a gimmick to get people to come here.

407
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,119
You know, change the name to
Extreme Jellystone.

408
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,627
- I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
- You do?

409
00:21:55,864 --> 00:21:56,922
You're right.

410
00:21:57,699 --> 00:21:59,758
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.

411
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:02,028
- Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Except a place without him.

412
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:04,069
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.

413
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,900
Madame Moviemaker Lady.

414
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:10,443
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense
to show you the utmost respect.

415
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:11,977
Hi. Ha, ha.

416
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:13,409
What do you want, Yogi?

417
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,346
Well, I was thinking about the park's
prickly predicament...

418
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:18,645
...and I would like to do my part to help.

419
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:22,889
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $100.

420
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:28,928
I was going to use it on myself,
but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.

421
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:32,030
Well, thank you, Yogi. That's...

422
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:34,733
That is very sweet.

423
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,298
- Where does a bear get money from?
- That brown box by the parking lot.

424
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,175
The park donation box.

425
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:43,777
Yep. But I want you to have it.

426
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,879
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.

427
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:48,778
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.

428
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,851
But what this park needs is visitors
and lots of them.

429
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,612
Well, I can help you there, sir.

430
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,281
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.

431
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,256
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.

432
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:03,929
<i>I like big butts and I cannot lie</i>
<i>You other brothers can't deny</i>

433
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:06,533
<i>That when a girl walks in</i>
<i>With a itty-bitty waist</i>

434
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:09,499
<i>And a round thing in your face</i>
<i>You get sprung</i>

435
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,673
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.

436
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:17,437
You're right. We need something
flashier than music. Not a problem.

437
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:21,480
I've got this water-skiing routine
that will change the face of entertainment.

438
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,050
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.

439
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:26,881
- And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
- No, you don't.

440
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:28,716
- I want to try it.
- I don't care.

441
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,381
I hate to interrupt,
but you're not gonna water-ski...

442
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,529
...or dance or do anything
that might disturb the campers, okay?

443
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:37,221
If what you really want to do
is help save this park...

444
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:40,766
...you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?

445
00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:43,137
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.

446
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:45,637
I will be seen, but not heard.

447
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:47,172
Or seen.

448
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,899
Fine.

449
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,610
Huh?

450
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:52,446
You guys done with that Spam?

451
00:23:52,981 --> 00:23:55,472
- Get out of here.
- Okay. Sheesh!

452
00:23:58,787 --> 00:23:59,981
Hey.

453
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:02,483
What's this?

454
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:03,885
Seasons pass applications.

455
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:06,186
Unfortunately,
not a lot of takers on those.

456
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:10,320
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees? That's a bargain.

457
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:13,559
If this were a place people wanted
to visit throughout the year.

458
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:16,101
Maybe Yogi was on to something.

459
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:19,536
- You said the park was turning 100, right?
- Right.

460
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,903
Well, a big event could really
pull people in.

461
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:23,476
Yeah, you're right.

462
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:27,274
We could have, like, a moss collection day
or a big squirrel chase.

463
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:29,178
- Or...
- Fireworks.

464
00:24:29,351 --> 00:24:31,285
Yes. Exactly. Why didn't I think of that?

465
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:35,583
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.

466
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:38,089
If even half of the people
buy season passes...

467
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,251
...the park makes enough money
to stay open.

468
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:41,861
Right. Let's get the word out.

469
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,793
I think I can help with that.

470
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:53,403
That is great.

471
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,702
How did we pay for it?

472
00:24:55,877 --> 00:24:58,846
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant...

473
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:01,608
...but I rearranged the letters right
before the plane took off.

474
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,649
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.

475
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:09,415
You're pretty cool yourself.

476
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,218
I do have my own kind of
natural swagger.

477
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:17,429
Jellystone National Park, 100th year
anniversary. There'll be fireworks.

478
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,590
Just stay calm, Jones.

479
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,864
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo
making park-impacting decisions, but...

480
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:26,564
- Hey, 100th year anniversary.
- Thanks.

481
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:29,437
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.

482
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:33,945
Even if those orders make you look
like a giant Cheez-It.

483
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:37,110
Mr. Mayor!

484
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,344
Hi, Mr. Mayor.

485
00:25:39,754 --> 00:25:43,815
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any... No!

486
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:48,623
Oh, okay. Is it a double tap
or do I have to press it...?

487
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,698
- Oh, dang it!
- I got it, sir.

488
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,235
Yeah. That's exactly what I did.

489
00:25:55,403 --> 00:25:56,995
Let me see one of those fliers.

490
00:25:58,373 --> 00:26:02,935
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 100th
anniversary with fireworks and fun."

491
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:05,978
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?

492
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,547
He's gonna try to make the budget
selling season passes.

493
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:13,748
Yeah, ugh. It's not a very good idea,
in my opinion.

494
00:26:13,922 --> 00:26:17,221
But nobody consulted me, because my job
is just to maintain the park...

495
00:26:17,392 --> 00:26:19,952
...which is basically poking trash
with a stick.

496
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:24,895
Yeah. Yeah, why is a guy with your talent
doing this insulting grunt work?

497
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:26,397
You should be running a park.

498
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:28,968
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says
I have to pay my dues.

499
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:30,161
- Excuse me?
- What?

500
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,203
- He has to pay his dues? Ha.
- Ha, ha.

501
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:34,274
Nobody pays dues anymore.

502
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:37,343
You gotta be in charge now
while you still know everything.

503
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,207
- That's what I've been saying.
- Yeah.

504
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:43,511
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be
the head ranger of Jellystone already.

505
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,654
- You'd put me in charge?
- In a second. Yes.

506
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:51,724
You know, if this centennial festival didn't
work out, I probably could relocate Smith.

507
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:56,894
You know, uh,
maybe you could help me with that.

508
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:58,896
Make sure it doesn't succeed?

509
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:00,728
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?

510
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:04,497
No. Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.

511
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:08,939
It just so happens that the only way to
do that is to bring down this festival.

512
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:12,837
But spend the rest of your life
as second-in-command if you like.

513
00:27:13,014 --> 00:27:15,505
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.

514
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:20,219
Well, you just think about it and give
me a call, okay? Here's my card.

515
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:22,182
So long.

516
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,086
Hey. Now why is it doing that?

517
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:29,556
No. Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind...

518
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:33,623
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.

519
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:36,032
Let me tell you,
this festival is gonna be huge.

520
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:39,640
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think
until I reach head ranger status?

521
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:42,299
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.

522
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:43,808
Ha, okay.

523
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:45,002
Are you serious?

524
00:27:45,513 --> 00:27:48,311
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.

525
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:49,950
This festival's gonna be great!

526
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:59,058
I can't wait 12 years.

527
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,411
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms. Thank you.

528
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,072
Seasons pass order forms,
$10 off today. Ah, enjoy.

529
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,140
I can't take it, Boo Boo.

530
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:26,514
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?

531
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:31,125
And I have to sit up here while they're
having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?

532
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:33,859
And they have doughnuts.

533
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:35,120
Doughnuts!

534
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:48,806
<i>Yogi, what are you doing?</i>

535
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:51,871
- Yogi!
- I'm going.

536
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:53,445
Hey.

537
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:55,849
Wait. Don't do it, Yogi.

538
00:28:56,384 --> 00:28:58,318
You promised Mr. Ranger.

539
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:02,650
You're right. I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.

540
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:06,385
Here.

541
00:29:07,962 --> 00:29:12,092
I want you to handcuff me to this tree
and not unlock it no matter what I say.

542
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:13,427
Okay, Yogi.

543
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,934
- Okay, unlock me.
- Huh?

544
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:19,698
It was a bad idea. Unlock me.

545
00:29:21,776 --> 00:29:25,439
Unlock me!

546
00:29:36,157 --> 00:29:38,022
Okay. Here you go.

547
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,052
Folks, I hate to say this,
but there are no spots left.

548
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,461
Forecast called for thunderstorms. Severe
lightning. I fear for your young ones.

549
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,996
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.

550
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:51,263
Oh, no.

551
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:57,141
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.

552
00:29:57,312 --> 00:29:59,974
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.

553
00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:01,308
That's a good point, sir.

554
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:05,146
You were gonna handle this situation,
yet there are quite a few people here.

555
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,880
Sir, I tried. All last night
I spent taking down fliers.

556
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,684
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle
to back up traffic.

557
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:13,919
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.

558
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:17,030
- Nothing is working.
- You need to think of something, don't you?

559
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:20,895
Or maybe you're just not
head ranger material.

560
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,331
Mr. Mayor. Mayor's yes man.

561
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:24,199
So glad you could join us.

562
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:26,772
I saved you a nice spot next
to the porta-potties.

563
00:30:26,941 --> 00:30:29,409
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.

564
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:33,240
You know, I'm just so glad that these
festivities are going so well, Smith.

565
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,109
I just hope nothing goes wrong.

566
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:46,023
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.

567
00:30:46,194 --> 00:30:49,254
I've seen hundreds of people filling out
seasons pass order forms.

568
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,990
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.

569
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:54,566
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.

570
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:57,030
Yogi.

571
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:05,244
Hey, guys. Sorry, just wandering around,
bored out of my mind.

572
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:09,611
Bored? But the 100th anniversary
extravaganza's going on.

573
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,446
Yeah, more like 100th anniversary
lame-aganza.

574
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,383
You know, because it's so lame.

575
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:16,820
People see fireworks every day
in the city.

576
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:19,482
They thought they'd
see something different here.

577
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:20,992
I knew it.

578
00:31:21,162 --> 00:31:23,426
I should be out there doing my
water-ski routine.

579
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:26,658
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith
is holding me back.

580
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:28,233
I don't know, Yogi.

581
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:31,031
Mr. Ranger is usually right about
these things.

582
00:31:31,205 --> 00:31:35,335
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?

583
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,071
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.

584
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:42,739
He said he's gonna start moving the park
to his apartment piece by piece.

585
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:45,545
- How big is his apartment?
- There's still time.

586
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,245
I won't be able to do the half-hour
artistic program...

587
00:31:48,423 --> 00:31:50,186
...but that was more for me anyway.

588
00:31:50,358 --> 00:31:52,053
These people need the razzle-dazzle.

589
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:54,490
I don't think we've practiced
the razzle-dazzle.

590
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,654
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.

591
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,595
Yogi, I really don't think we should...

592
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:04,602
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant
ideas with common sense a thousand times.

593
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:06,205
Has it ever worked?

594
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:07,500
No.

595
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,405
Then let's go, go, go.

596
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,148
What does that taste like?

597
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:21,913
Unemployment?

598
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,558
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

599
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:35,035
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.

600
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,068
My pleasure.

601
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,198
You know, um, Rachel,
I've been wanting to tell you...

602
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,877
...well, how much I...
- Ranger...

603
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,105
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.

604
00:32:47,281 --> 00:32:51,047
But I have never felt so...

605
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,244
...gushy. Ha-ha-ha.

606
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:54,445
- You know?
- Ranger...

607
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:57,682
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.

608
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:58,883
It's like this:

609
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:01,387
Oh, no.

610
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:03,456
<i>I...</i>

611
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:04,791
<i>... saw you at the station</i>

612
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:06,092
<i>Had a heart palpitation</i>

613
00:33:06,267 --> 00:33:08,462
<i>My sickness was love</i>
<i>And you're the medication</i>

614
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:09,762
<i>Rachel</i>

615
00:33:09,937 --> 00:33:11,495
- <i>Rachel</i>
- The microphone is on.

616
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:12,765
<i>And it comes around again</i>

617
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,535
<i>Rachel, Rachel, Rachel</i>

618
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:18,406
The microphone is on.

619
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,308
Yes, the mic...

620
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,887
Hi. Hello...

621
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:32,322
...and welcome to
the 100th anniversary of Jellystone!

622
00:33:35,797 --> 00:33:41,599
Thank you. It is so wonderful to see
so many people here today.

623
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,829
I've noticed many of you filling out
your seasons pass order forms.

624
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:47,702
We're more than happy to collect those
after the fireworks.

625
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:51,402
But first, please, sit back,
get comfortable...

626
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:53,308
...and enjoy the show!

627
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,243
- Terrific.
- Mr. Mayor?

628
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,785
That's not the right music.

629
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:15,502
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!

630
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,495
Oh, no.

631
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,039
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.

632
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:22,233
Okay.

633
00:34:28,883 --> 00:34:30,714
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?

634
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:32,477
Looking good, Yogi.

635
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,019
- This cannot be happening.
- Oh, it's happening.

636
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,157
Hello, Jellystone!

637
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:42,893
No, don't encourage him!

638
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,229
They love me. I can do no wrong.

639
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:49,062
Watch this.

640
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:51,569
All right, Boo Boo! Turn up the heat!

641
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,570
Phase two, go.

642
00:34:58,246 --> 00:35:01,181
I'm an unstoppable water-skiing
machine.

643
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:09,813
Ta-da!

644
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,356
Oh, wait. There's more.

645
00:35:14,996 --> 00:35:16,190
How about if I heat things up?

646
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,967
<i>Don't need nothin' but a good time</i>

647
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:28,802
<i>And it don't get better than this</i>

648
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:30,902
Yogi!

649
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:32,568
Yogi, your cape.

650
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:34,772
I know. It is magnificent.

651
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:36,109
And on fire.

652
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,213
Huh? Fire!

653
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,291
- Turn the boat!
- Huh?

654
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:52,091
- Turn, Boo Boo!
- Hang on, Yogi!

655
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:57,903
Too much razzle!

656
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,884
- Nice one.
- Thanks.

657
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,220
Jump!

658
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,807
Let's go.

659
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,280
Out of my way!

660
00:37:08,075 --> 00:37:09,940
This could not have gone more perfectly.

661
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,711
Hey, you got a little, uh...

662
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,074
Never mind. Let's go.

663
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:23,716
Mr. Ranger, I thought...

664
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:28,048
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.

665
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:31,658
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.

666
00:38:31,826 --> 00:38:34,192
If you could just be a regular bear.

667
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:36,990
You know, sitting in the woods,
minding his own business.

668
00:38:37,164 --> 00:38:40,600
But no, you're different. You're smart.

669
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:44,226
And you'd rather spend your days
being selfish and destructive...

670
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,134
...while everyone else pays the price.

671
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:48,942
But I guess it wasn't enough,
screwing up my life.

672
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,977
No, this time you had to go
and bring down this entire park.

673
00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:55,949
So tell me, Yogi...

674
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:00,411
...how smart are you now?

675
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:11,023
Hey, there! That was quite a show
you put on yesterday. Ha-ha-ha.

676
00:39:11,198 --> 00:39:13,166
I can't wait to see what you do with this.

677
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:14,767
That's your new assignment.

678
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:18,336
Evergreen Park. Oh, I think
you're just going to find it delightful.

679
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:22,500
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones
is gonna be taking over here.

680
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:25,371
Ranger Jones?

681
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,508
Well, I have got a press conference
to plan.

682
00:39:30,684 --> 00:39:34,176
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.

683
00:39:35,156 --> 00:39:38,592
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor! Ha-ha-ha.

684
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,318
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?

685
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:42,826
Uh, no.

686
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:49,725
You did everything you could.

687
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:52,065
Doesn't matter.

688
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,901
This park needed a ranger
who could make it popular again.

689
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:57,408
I'm just some guy who knows
how old every tree is.

690
00:39:57,578 --> 00:39:59,978
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.

691
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:05,141
Face it. You and I are just two people who
care about things that nobody else does...

692
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,150
...and that's why we're alone.

693
00:40:08,222 --> 00:40:12,022
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?

694
00:40:13,461 --> 00:40:16,521
Rachel, you and this park have
one thing in common.

695
00:40:16,697 --> 00:40:19,257
You both deserve a better man than me.

696
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:46,026
I can't believe he's really gone.

697
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,257
Yogi, are you okay?

698
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,194
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.

699
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,799
Ranger Smith was right.

700
00:40:54,502 --> 00:40:56,265
My whole life, I've been different.

701
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,998
But it's done nothing but hurt people.

702
00:40:59,173 --> 00:41:04,270
The world would be better off if
I was only as smart as the average bear.

703
00:41:04,778 --> 00:41:06,746
Yogi, what are you doing?

704
00:41:07,314 --> 00:41:09,407
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.

705
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:13,849
- I am going to forage for food in the wild.
- Huh?

706
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:16,421
Might even catch some fish.

707
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,956
With my paws.

708
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:25,990
I'm just gonna grab a little something
for the road.

709
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:28,863
Some chips and soda.

710
00:41:29,036 --> 00:41:31,766
And this. Peach pie.

711
00:41:31,939 --> 00:41:34,032
Any more of that casserole?

712
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,368
Top shelf.

713
00:41:35,543 --> 00:41:38,740
I'll be out there. Fending for myself.

714
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,610
Foraging for food in the wild.

715
00:42:05,973 --> 00:42:10,706
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.

716
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,482
Let's see what you got.

717
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:47,342
Perfect.

718
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:53,283
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.

719
00:42:54,922 --> 00:42:58,289
No more food. No more pic-a-nickers.

720
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:00,359
How could this get any worse?

721
00:43:03,063 --> 00:43:04,394
Oh.

722
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:10,268
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.

723
00:43:32,293 --> 00:43:33,624
- Come on.
- I've got it, sir.

724
00:43:33,794 --> 00:43:35,625
This is unbelievable.

725
00:43:37,998 --> 00:43:40,865
Ah, Evergreen Park. Lovely, isn't it?

726
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,868
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.

727
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,233
Look at these trees. They're all plastic.

728
00:43:46,407 --> 00:43:49,274
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution...

729
00:43:49,443 --> 00:43:51,570
...have left a plastic-like coating on them.

730
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:55,910
Think people will be happy you're closing
the most beautiful park in the state?

731
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:59,143
Well, they will be when they find out
it's making the city rich...

732
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,084
...and giving each citizen a check
for $1000.

733
00:44:02,256 --> 00:44:03,553
How is that even possible?

734
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:07,626
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been
some agricultural interest in the park.

735
00:44:08,162 --> 00:44:12,121
And it's a lot more profitable than people
in station wagons making s'mores.

736
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:17,095
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.

737
00:44:17,705 --> 00:44:20,572
I hate this car. I hate it.

738
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,656
Yeah!

739
00:44:44,832 --> 00:44:46,663
Oh, hey, there he is. Ha-ha-ha.

740
00:44:46,834 --> 00:44:49,098
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!

741
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:51,895
I, uh...

742
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:54,336
Just finishing some stamping.

743
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:57,500
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.

744
00:44:57,678 --> 00:45:00,738
Quick thing. You'll probably notice
some giant trucks rumbling by.

745
00:45:00,914 --> 00:45:05,010
We're just clearing a little patch of trees
for my press conference. No big deal.

746
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:07,449
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?

747
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,784
Oh, yeah. Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.

748
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,983
Actually gonna improve the park
quite a bit.

749
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,027
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed
as head ranger...

750
00:45:16,196 --> 00:45:19,563
...is that you need more clear spaces here,
and you are absolutely right.

751
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:22,759
Now you can host concerts and
Boy Scout jamborees.

752
00:45:22,936 --> 00:45:25,336
That's a pretty smart move there,
Head Ranger Jones.

753
00:45:25,506 --> 00:45:28,134
I have some other park improvements
I want to run by you.

754
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:32,335
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.

755
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:34,777
Look into the security arrangements
for tomorrow.

756
00:45:34,948 --> 00:45:36,210
I don't want any surprises.

757
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,078
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.

758
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,085
What do you got?

759
00:45:41,622 --> 00:45:44,614
I'm hungrier than the average bear.

760
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:49,252
I wish I could find a bush that tasted
like birthday cake.

761
00:45:55,936 --> 00:45:57,164
Gotcha.

762
00:45:58,572 --> 00:46:02,030
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.

763
00:46:05,646 --> 00:46:07,739
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere
for you.

764
00:46:07,915 --> 00:46:12,614
Not now, Boo Boo. I'm busy foraging.

765
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:20,584
Come on, Yogi.

766
00:46:20,761 --> 00:46:23,229
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.

767
00:46:23,397 --> 00:46:25,228
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.

768
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:29,301
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.

769
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:32,132
I wouldn't even be standing
if my paws didn't hurt.

770
00:46:32,306 --> 00:46:35,901
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.

771
00:46:36,243 --> 00:46:39,337
Hey, hey, Boo Boo. You're right, I'm not.

772
00:46:39,513 --> 00:46:41,640
I failed at that too.

773
00:46:41,815 --> 00:46:45,046
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.

774
00:46:45,786 --> 00:46:47,651
What are you doing? I'm not...

775
00:46:48,856 --> 00:46:51,552
Yogi, you have to use your smarts
for good.

776
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:55,354
And if you can't see that,
maybe you are just an average bear.

777
00:46:55,529 --> 00:46:56,928
Come on.

778
00:47:00,434 --> 00:47:02,834
Now do you understand?

779
00:47:03,003 --> 00:47:05,699
What's going on, Boo Boo?

780
00:47:05,873 --> 00:47:07,033
I don't know.

781
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:08,765
But whatever it is...

782
00:47:09,276 --> 00:47:12,302
...I think they're just getting started.

783
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:22,152
Boo Boo...

784
00:47:22,322 --> 00:47:25,758
...get my collar.

785
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:33,960
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.

786
00:47:34,468 --> 00:47:35,662
Where are we going, Yogi?

787
00:47:35,836 --> 00:47:37,827
We can't get Jellystone back alone,
Boo Boo.

788
00:47:38,005 --> 00:47:40,269
My thinker is good,
but Ranger Smith's is better.

789
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,533
He was going to a place called
Evergreen Park.

790
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:44,199
That's right. In the city.

791
00:47:44,378 --> 00:47:46,141
The city? That's a long walk.

792
00:47:46,313 --> 00:47:47,541
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.

793
00:47:47,714 --> 00:47:51,377
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat
to keep our feet off the street.

794
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:55,317
Get ready for it. Here it comes.

795
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:57,514
Run, Boo Boo, run!

796
00:47:58,692 --> 00:48:00,216
Hurry, Boo Boo.

797
00:48:00,394 --> 00:48:02,885
I think we gotta jump for it. Ready?

798
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:07,055
All aboard.

799
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,461
Good.

800
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,296
Yogi, grab my paw.

801
00:48:14,441 --> 00:48:15,840
Sorry.

802
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:19,576
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get...!

803
00:48:26,853 --> 00:48:29,287
I guess it makes a stop here.

804
00:48:29,456 --> 00:48:30,480
Yup.

805
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,096
Looks like Evergreen Park is about
two miles away from here.

806
00:48:41,268 --> 00:48:44,635
Two miles? I'll have to tap into
my emergency rations.

807
00:48:44,805 --> 00:48:46,170
Snack break.

808
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:51,368
Come on, Yogi. We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.

809
00:48:51,545 --> 00:48:52,569
Downhill?

810
00:48:53,113 --> 00:48:55,274
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.

811
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:58,418
Any chance my friend and I might
borrow your wheely-basket?

812
00:48:58,919 --> 00:49:00,250
Is that chocolate?

813
00:49:06,727 --> 00:49:08,695
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.

814
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,092
I'm okay, Ma. Just...

815
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:15,132
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least
there's nothing here to drive me crazy.

816
00:49:15,302 --> 00:49:17,702
- Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Hey, Yogi.

817
00:49:20,507 --> 00:49:22,407
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.

818
00:49:23,243 --> 00:49:24,608
What are you guys doing here?

819
00:49:24,778 --> 00:49:26,405
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.

820
00:49:26,847 --> 00:49:31,079
But don't worry, my days of goofing
things up for you are over.

821
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:33,742
Hey, move that shopping cart!

822
00:49:41,461 --> 00:49:42,485
I'm okay!

823
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,727
I'm just gonna put this over here.

824
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:51,529
What do you want? I don't have a life
left for you to ruin anymore.

825
00:49:51,705 --> 00:49:56,005
Sir, I know I messed things up
and I'm sorry.

826
00:49:56,176 --> 00:49:57,666
I never meant to.

827
00:49:57,844 --> 00:50:00,108
You and Boo Boo are the best friends
I ever had.

828
00:50:00,647 --> 00:50:03,411
And I've never done anything
but think of myself.

829
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:07,679
And now Jellystone is just gonna be
a big field of stumps.

830
00:50:08,355 --> 00:50:09,379
What?

831
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:11,456
They've started cutting down the trees.

832
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,785
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.

833
00:50:15,962 --> 00:50:17,759
We have to save it, sir.

834
00:50:18,365 --> 00:50:20,265
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.

835
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,368
I'm no smarter than you.

836
00:50:23,503 --> 00:50:24,697
I lost Jellystone.

837
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:26,966
I lost Rachel.

838
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:31,010
It's over.

839
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:35,711
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things
from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.

840
00:50:35,882 --> 00:50:39,511
One: light mayonnaise is not nearly as
good as regular mayonnaise.

841
00:50:39,686 --> 00:50:42,985
And two: you can't fail if
you never stop trying.

842
00:50:43,156 --> 00:50:45,147
You have to fight for the things
you love...

843
00:50:45,325 --> 00:50:48,692
...whether it's a park,
a girl or a roast beef sandwich.

844
00:50:48,862 --> 00:50:49,886
Don't give up now.

845
00:50:50,897 --> 00:50:52,888
We're all Jellystone's got.

846
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:55,962
You're right, Yogi.

847
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,902
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try. Come on.

848
00:51:01,374 --> 00:51:03,740
- Shotgun.
- Aw.

849
00:51:11,918 --> 00:51:13,715
I never thought I'd see this.

850
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,890
Happy 100th anniversary, Jellystone.

851
00:51:19,059 --> 00:51:20,651
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?

852
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:23,154
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.

853
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,991
Let me in, please.

854
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:29,101
No can do. Park is closed to the public
until the press conference. Mayor's orders.

855
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:32,534
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.

856
00:51:34,975 --> 00:51:36,499
I'm sorry.

857
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,042
I don't really take orders from a...

858
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,947
I lived with gorillas, pal.

859
00:51:43,116 --> 00:51:45,016
I know rage.

860
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,119
You do not want me to go gorilla
on you.

861
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,883
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.

862
00:51:55,962 --> 00:51:58,260
- Thank you.
- Okay.

863
00:52:01,635 --> 00:52:02,897
Rachel.

864
00:52:04,805 --> 00:52:06,830
Ranger Smith.

865
00:52:07,274 --> 00:52:09,037
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

866
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,508
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.

867
00:52:13,113 --> 00:52:14,273
I think you're perfect.

868
00:52:14,447 --> 00:52:17,678
I think any guy in the world would be
lucky just to stand next to you.

869
00:52:18,518 --> 00:52:19,644
You really mean that?

870
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,845
Of course I do.

871
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:26,249
It's just, when I lost Jellystone,
I felt like such a failure.

872
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,396
But losing you has felt much,
much worse.

873
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,327
I'm like...

874
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,828
I'm like a genus without a phylum.

875
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,769
That's the sweetest thing anyone's
ever said to me.

876
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:48,805
- So, um, we're still here.
- Mm-hm.

877
00:52:50,283 --> 00:52:52,649
Oh, right. Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?

878
00:52:52,819 --> 00:52:54,616
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Okay.

879
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,983
I was reviewing the documentary footage
from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.

880
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,618
Oh, my. I see it.

881
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:05,026
I have a bald spot back there!

882
00:53:05,198 --> 00:53:09,294
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.

883
00:53:09,736 --> 00:53:12,705
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.

884
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,504
True. You know they don't come
out of that shell?

885
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:18,439
I tried one time to see what one
would look like without it.

886
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,943
But, nope, they're sewn in.

887
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:25,312
This is no regular turtle. See the bulging
frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?

888
00:53:25,485 --> 00:53:27,180
A frog-mouthed turtle?

889
00:53:27,354 --> 00:53:29,618
Yup, <i>Rafetus swinhoei</i>.

890
00:53:30,223 --> 00:53:31,656
But those are extinct.

891
00:53:31,825 --> 00:53:34,259
For a hundred years,
but apparently one still exists.

892
00:53:34,427 --> 00:53:38,022
And he lives in there. But they won't let me
through the gates to go find him.

893
00:53:38,198 --> 00:53:41,167
But if Jellystone has an endangered
species living in it, then...

894
00:53:41,334 --> 00:53:44,167
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.

895
00:53:44,337 --> 00:53:46,669
That turtle can save this park.

896
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,037
Now I feel kinda bad about using him
as a foot stool.

897
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,456
You've seen the filmmaker?

898
00:54:03,623 --> 00:54:05,386
Well, we spoke. About extinct turtles.

899
00:54:05,592 --> 00:54:08,823
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle
living here in the park?

900
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,259
According to Miss Johnson's film,
there is.

901
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:12,455
An extinct turtle?

902
00:54:12,632 --> 00:54:16,762
That's great. Visitors will come from miles
around to see an endangered species.

903
00:54:16,937 --> 00:54:20,270
Yes, they will, and that is great.

904
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,533
We need to find this turtle.

905
00:54:22,709 --> 00:54:25,576
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out. The whole deal.

906
00:54:25,745 --> 00:54:27,906
The sooner we get to him the better.

907
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:31,676
Oh, we need a head ranger
who's good enough to find it.

908
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:34,581
Someone who thinks like a turtle.

909
00:54:36,823 --> 00:54:38,381
I am that head ranger.

910
00:54:38,558 --> 00:54:41,652
Well, then why are you still here?

911
00:54:48,735 --> 00:54:50,168
He's back.

912
00:54:50,337 --> 00:54:51,599
Come on.

913
00:54:51,771 --> 00:54:54,638
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.

914
00:54:54,808 --> 00:54:57,299
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.

915
00:54:57,477 --> 00:54:59,707
We'll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.

916
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:03,872
No. A turtle that's endangered can't
be removed from its natural habitat.

917
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,210
It's against federal law.

918
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,819
It is? Wow, I've never heard of that law...

919
00:55:07,988 --> 00:55:11,890
...in chapter 4, subsection 6
of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.

920
00:55:12,692 --> 00:55:15,684
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.

921
00:55:15,862 --> 00:55:18,422
These people have no idea where
my cave is.

922
00:55:18,598 --> 00:55:20,463
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.

923
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:21,657
<i>Copy.</i>

924
00:55:21,835 --> 00:55:23,996
Wow, that backfired.

925
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:28,938
Okay. You know what? Fine,

926
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,876
You win.

927
00:55:33,513 --> 00:55:34,878
What are you doing?

928
00:55:35,048 --> 00:55:36,845
I have a plan.

929
00:55:38,218 --> 00:55:40,413
One of the advantages...

930
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:44,121
...of having lived here since
I was a kid...

931
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:48,192
...is I know this park
like the back of my hand.

932
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:49,623
Let's go!

933
00:55:50,563 --> 00:55:52,155
Hold on, boys.

934
00:55:52,332 --> 00:55:54,095
All right.

935
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,721
Hey, there, little buddy.

936
00:56:15,889 --> 00:56:17,686
Hello, there.

937
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,060
Uh-oh. Sorry about that.

938
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,960
- Mayor Brown.
- This had better be good, Jones.

939
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,463
<i>I found the turtle.</i>

940
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,158
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.

941
00:56:29,335 --> 00:56:31,496
But now I have him secure
at the picnic area.

942
00:56:31,671 --> 00:56:32,899
<i>Jones, you're a hero.</i>

943
00:56:33,073 --> 00:56:35,633
Sit tight. My chief of staff is
on his way to get him.

944
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,174
Copy that.

945
00:56:37,343 --> 00:56:39,709
Head Ranger Jones over and out.

946
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:45,374
He found the turtle.

947
00:56:45,552 --> 00:56:47,019
Dang it.

948
00:56:49,789 --> 00:56:52,815
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.

949
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,984
Well, there is one way.

950
00:56:58,031 --> 00:56:59,191
There it is.

951
00:56:59,365 --> 00:57:00,730
My masterpiece.

952
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,960
- You really think you can pull this off?
- I know I can, sir.

953
00:57:04,137 --> 00:57:08,096
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box
and fly away like a fuzzy bird.

954
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:12,840
And I've got the best copilot
a basket-snatching machine could have.

955
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:16,504
- I don't know how to fly this thing.
- Well, you'll pick it up as we go.

956
00:57:19,786 --> 00:57:21,344
Okay.

957
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,251
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?

958
00:57:24,424 --> 00:57:25,789
Copy that, ground control.

959
00:57:25,959 --> 00:57:28,484
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.

960
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:30,891
- Flight systems check. Boo Boo?
- What?

961
00:57:31,064 --> 00:57:33,726
- Can you reach the pedals?
- If I point my toes.

962
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,924
Flight systems are go.

963
00:57:35,502 --> 00:57:38,938
Remember what I told you about flying
gliders, Yogi. Don't fight the wind.

964
00:57:39,105 --> 00:57:43,064
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up
that turtle, we'll get along just fine.

965
00:57:43,243 --> 00:57:45,575
- All right.
- Start pedaling, Boo Boo.

966
00:57:46,279 --> 00:57:47,473
All right.

967
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:51,945
Here goes.

968
00:57:52,919 --> 00:57:56,150
Hold on, Boo Boo. Fasten your seat belt.

969
00:57:56,322 --> 00:57:57,653
But there isn't one.

970
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,552
- Here we go!
- Oh, Yogi!

971
00:58:05,632 --> 00:58:07,156
The wind should carry you south!

972
00:58:07,634 --> 00:58:08,999
We'll meet you there!

973
00:58:09,169 --> 00:58:10,761
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.

974
00:58:10,937 --> 00:58:13,064
This machine is equipped
with landing gear.

975
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,673
We'll touch down as soft as a feather.

976
00:58:20,847 --> 00:58:21,871
Whoops.

977
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:34,255
This is your captain speaking.

978
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:37,294
We'll reach our turtle target
in about two minutes.

979
00:58:37,463 --> 00:58:40,830
So let's go ahead
and start the beverage service.

980
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:46,003
- Yogi, look out.
- Aah!

981
00:58:46,472 --> 00:58:48,440
- Trees!
- Yes, trees!

982
00:58:50,643 --> 00:58:52,338
I got it. I got it.

983
00:58:52,879 --> 00:58:53,937
I got it.

984
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,808
I don't got it!

985
00:58:55,982 --> 00:58:57,142
Pull up.

986
00:58:57,317 --> 00:58:58,841
- Hey!
- Pull up!

987
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,821
You did it, Yogi.

988
00:59:06,759 --> 00:59:08,954
Oh. Yeah.

989
00:59:09,362 --> 00:59:12,889
Ha-ha-ha. Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.

990
00:59:13,399 --> 00:59:14,457
- The city zoo?
- Yep.

991
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,829
They got a nice spot ready
in the reptile house.

992
00:59:17,003 --> 00:59:19,062
The city zoo doesn't have
a reptile house.

993
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:20,763
They're building one.

994
00:59:21,074 --> 00:59:23,304
- Who is?
- Builders.

995
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:25,376
Sure you're trying to
protect the turtle?

996
00:59:25,545 --> 00:59:27,604
Yeah, we love turtles.

997
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:32,046
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until
I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?

998
00:59:32,218 --> 00:59:36,552
All right. You're gonna find this out in a
few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.

999
00:59:37,056 --> 00:59:39,957
We gotta lose this turtle
to sell logging rights to the park.

1000
00:59:40,126 --> 00:59:41,753
Logging? The whole park?

1001
00:59:41,928 --> 00:59:45,022
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.

1002
00:59:45,198 --> 00:59:46,222
And they'll grow back.

1003
00:59:46,399 --> 00:59:47,923
Yeah, in like 200 years.

1004
00:59:48,101 --> 00:59:51,070
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.

1005
00:59:52,872 --> 00:59:55,841
Ha-ha-ha. Turtle target acquired.

1006
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,034
I need 20 more feet of altitude.

1007
00:59:58,211 --> 00:59:59,803
Engage the hand pedals.

1008
00:59:59,979 --> 01:00:02,345
You couldn't put the hand pedals
by you?

1009
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:04,779
There's a suggestion box behind
the seat, Boo Boo.

1010
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:14,091
Wait, you don't want to approach him
like that. He's poisonous.

1011
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,284
He's in a basket.

1012
01:00:15,461 --> 01:00:17,258
But he can spit. Poison.

1013
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:19,796
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.

1014
01:00:19,966 --> 01:00:23,026
- I'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
- What are you looking at?

1015
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,965
- Hook me in, Boo Boo.
- Okay.

1016
01:00:25,138 --> 01:00:26,400
And fire!

1017
01:00:28,074 --> 01:00:29,564
Here you go. Huh?

1018
01:00:30,977 --> 01:00:32,604
Yogi, wait!

1019
01:00:32,779 --> 01:00:34,770
Here I come!

1020
01:00:40,586 --> 01:00:41,917
He's going for the turtle.

1021
01:00:45,925 --> 01:00:48,052
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Hey!

1022
01:00:52,098 --> 01:00:55,090
Look, Boo Boo! We got the turtle!

1023
01:00:55,268 --> 01:00:57,293
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?

1024
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:00,102
That bear knows how to steal a basket.

1025
01:01:00,273 --> 01:01:03,071
Everybody after that glider now!

1026
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,938
I'm not gonna let a bear
make me look bad.

1027
01:01:06,779 --> 01:01:08,007
Been there, buddy.

1028
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:12,277
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.

1029
01:01:12,452 --> 01:01:14,579
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.

1030
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,984
Remember what Miss Movie Lady
said about...

1031
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:20,953
Never mind.

1032
01:01:21,127 --> 01:01:23,618
- Hang on, Boo Boo.
- What do we do now?

1033
01:01:23,796 --> 01:01:25,855
Did you check the safety manual?

1034
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,757
It's just a picture of us screaming.

1035
01:01:32,672 --> 01:01:34,162
We've got to deject, Boo.

1036
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:35,671
Don't you mean eject?

1037
01:01:35,842 --> 01:01:39,005
Eject is up. Deject is down.

1038
01:01:39,178 --> 01:01:43,945
In case of emergency your seat can also
be used as a flotation device!

1039
01:01:55,528 --> 01:01:58,759
Hey, told you. Nothing to worry about.

1040
01:02:00,233 --> 01:02:02,599
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.

1041
01:02:02,769 --> 01:02:04,828
Let me see how our little passenger
is doing.

1042
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:07,734
Wonder why they call him
a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?

1043
01:02:08,341 --> 01:02:09,706
Hey!

1044
01:02:13,613 --> 01:02:14,807
Hey, guys, over here!

1045
01:02:16,215 --> 01:02:18,410
Yogi, grab the branch.

1046
01:02:19,452 --> 01:02:21,079
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.

1047
01:02:25,091 --> 01:02:26,683
- Welcome aboard.
- Yogi.

1048
01:02:26,859 --> 01:02:28,827
We were trying to get you off the raft.

1049
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:32,227
Yeah, that makes more sense.

1050
01:02:32,398 --> 01:02:34,263
You guys did it. You saved him.

1051
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,033
Oh, no.

1052
01:02:39,906 --> 01:02:41,498
They're gonna catch us downstream.

1053
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:43,039
I'm on it.

1054
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:45,006
No, Yogi, don't.

1055
01:02:47,747 --> 01:02:50,875
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.

1056
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:54,713
Yeah, because now we are headed straight
for the Jellyjarring Rapids.

1057
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:58,385
- Grab a paddle.
- Tuck your head in, little buddy.

1058
01:03:00,326 --> 01:03:01,452
Brace yourselves.

1059
01:03:01,627 --> 01:03:03,151
Oh, come on, turtle.

1060
01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:08,130
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft
for just such an occasion.

1061
01:03:08,301 --> 01:03:10,098
You better hang on. Mr. Ranger said...

1062
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:11,793
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.

1063
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:15,134
Just sit back and let Mother Nature
carry us to...

1064
01:03:18,744 --> 01:03:21,474
I think Mother Nature's
kind of cranky today.

1065
01:03:42,001 --> 01:03:44,060
You okay, Yogi?

1066
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,261
Fine!

1067
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,369
Turtle!

1068
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:52,008
Who's that? I can't see.

1069
01:03:54,213 --> 01:03:56,010
Come here, turtle.

1070
01:03:56,182 --> 01:03:57,843
- Got him.
- Good work, Boo Boo.

1071
01:03:58,017 --> 01:03:59,416
We made it through the rapids.

1072
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:02,418
Yeah, but that means the falls are
just up ahead.

1073
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,420
Hold on!

1074
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:24,041
Yogi. Yogi.

1075
01:04:31,317 --> 01:04:33,911
Now who says there are no rides
at Jellystone?

1076
01:04:34,086 --> 01:04:37,317
Yeah, you've definitely got
the thrill part down.

1077
01:04:41,027 --> 01:04:44,463
<i>Please, take your seats.</i>
<i>The press conference is about to begin.</i>

1078
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,622
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.

1079
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:53,538
- Ranger Jones?
- I messed up pretty bad, sir.

1080
01:04:53,706 --> 01:04:55,901
- I know. It's okay.
- I wanted to be head ranger.

1081
01:04:56,075 --> 01:04:59,977
Because you're a good head ranger and
I value leadership. I have a merit badge...

1082
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,239
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.

1083
01:05:02,415 --> 01:05:03,746
Yes. Get in.

1084
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:10,647
Boo Boo! Boo Boo! Wait up!

1085
01:05:17,263 --> 01:05:18,821
Well, well.

1086
01:05:20,032 --> 01:05:21,226
Guess who we found.

1087
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,392
Starts with T and ends with a... "Urtle"?

1088
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:26,197
It's over. Call off the logging.

1089
01:05:26,372 --> 01:05:30,172
The law says this park is now
a protected nature preserve.

1090
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:33,176
You think I care about what the law says?

1091
01:05:33,613 --> 01:05:36,878
Or about some endangered
"frog-mouthed turtle"?

1092
01:05:37,049 --> 01:05:39,745
Or some stupid park for families
to have a picnic in?

1093
01:05:39,919 --> 01:05:42,114
I care about power, you pinheads!

1094
01:05:42,288 --> 01:05:43,516
And I'm gonna get it.

1095
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:45,748
Nobody knows this turtle exists.

1096
01:05:45,925 --> 01:05:48,723
And nobody ever will.

1097
01:05:51,297 --> 01:05:52,457
You found the turtle.

1098
01:05:53,399 --> 01:05:56,425
Get this thing out of here before
anybody else sees it.

1099
01:05:57,937 --> 01:05:59,564
- Rachel!
- Oh!

1100
01:06:01,807 --> 01:06:03,297
Yogi!

1101
01:06:05,478 --> 01:06:06,911
Yogi, here!

1102
01:06:09,782 --> 01:06:11,272
Thank you.

1103
01:06:11,784 --> 01:06:14,309
- Yogi.
- I'm sorry. He was open.

1104
01:06:14,487 --> 01:06:15,818
Ha, ha.

1105
01:06:17,123 --> 01:06:20,923
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a press conference.

1106
01:06:23,496 --> 01:06:25,157
I can still tell them what you did.

1107
01:06:25,331 --> 01:06:29,062
Oh, yeah? Without that turtle or a scrap
of evidence, go right ahead.

1108
01:06:30,436 --> 01:06:33,098
Well, you might as well tell them
Bigfoot is here. Ha-ha-ha.

1109
01:06:33,606 --> 01:06:36,302
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.

1110
01:06:36,475 --> 01:06:38,170
Try to keep your dignity.

1111
01:06:38,344 --> 01:06:39,811
It's all you have left.

1112
01:06:43,382 --> 01:06:46,545
You know what? I'm taking care of
this thing myself this time.

1113
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:49,517
That's the only way to make sure
the job is done right.

1114
01:06:49,689 --> 01:06:52,123
But that's why I'm the mayor's
right-hand man, right?

1115
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:56,193
Because I don't make mistakes.

1116
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,126
Hey, you know, people are wondering:

1117
01:07:00,299 --> 01:07:02,699
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown
to be governor?"

1118
01:07:02,868 --> 01:07:04,267
Well, how about this:

1119
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:09,101
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget
from a deficit into a surplus!

1120
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:15,809
And put $1000 into the pocket
of every citizen of this city!

1121
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:22,819
Now before I sign the paperwork
that will save the city...

1122
01:07:22,988 --> 01:07:28,290
...why don't you all take a look at my
first campaign ad for governor?

1123
01:07:29,161 --> 01:07:32,528
<i>Mayor Brown,</i>
<i>the right choice for governor.</i>

1124
01:07:32,698 --> 01:07:35,997
We're out of time. Must be something
we can do. Anybody have any ideas?

1125
01:07:36,168 --> 01:07:39,501
Well, I guess this is going to be
a pretty sad documentary, huh?

1126
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,130
Are you...? Is he still filming?

1127
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,039
I needed more footage,
so I told him to keep it rolling.

1128
01:07:46,212 --> 01:07:49,238
I can plug that into the video feed
right up there.

1129
01:07:49,915 --> 01:07:52,281
I just need a way to distract the guards.

1130
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:55,682
I think we can take care of that.

1131
01:07:55,855 --> 01:07:57,755
<i>He supports public safety.</i>

1132
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:03,392
<i>All right, hurry up, people. Focus.</i>

1133
01:08:03,562 --> 01:08:05,894
<i>Let's go save those orphans.</i>

1134
01:08:06,065 --> 01:08:07,896
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!

1135
01:08:08,067 --> 01:08:10,160
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.

1136
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,566
<i>Don't stop believing</i>

1137
01:08:14,874 --> 01:08:16,739
<i>Hold on to that feeling</i>

1138
01:08:16,909 --> 01:08:19,104
<i>He's tough on crime.</i>

1139
01:08:24,116 --> 01:08:27,916
Hey, hey, hey, look at this. Keep your eye
on the little bear. Look at the skills.

1140
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:30,853
Amazing!

1141
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:36,524
<i>And here's what Mayor Brown...</i>

1142
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:40,187
<i>...proudly has to say</i> <i>about
protecting our natural resources.</i>

1143
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,260
<i>You think I care about
what the law says?</i>

1144
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,361
<i>Or about some endangered</i>
<i>"frog-mouthed turtle"?</i>

1145
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,600
- <i>Some stupid park for families to picnic in?</i>
- No. No.

1146
01:08:50,776 --> 01:08:54,212
<i>No. I care about power, you pinheads!</i>

1147
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,642
Oh, boy.

1148
01:08:55,815 --> 01:08:57,646
<i>Nobody knows this turtle exists.</i>

1149
01:08:57,817 --> 01:08:59,580
<i>And nobody ever will.</i>

1150
01:09:04,323 --> 01:09:07,759
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.

1151
01:09:11,363 --> 01:09:16,096
Okay. No. Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please. That was not real.

1152
01:09:16,268 --> 01:09:21,001
Trust me, there is no such thing as
a frog-mouthed turtle.

1153
01:09:22,374 --> 01:09:24,342
He's right next to me, isn't he?

1154
01:09:24,543 --> 01:09:25,976
Okay.

1155
01:09:28,848 --> 01:09:30,975
- We did it, Yogi!
- Up high, Boo Boo!

1156
01:09:32,651 --> 01:09:35,779
- All right!
- We got it! Yogi!

1157
01:09:35,955 --> 01:09:37,547
All right, and now...

1158
01:09:38,524 --> 01:09:39,684
Miss Moviemaker Lady.

1159
01:09:41,894 --> 01:09:43,418
Hey, we did it.

1160
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:46,625
Hey, Mr. Ranger!

1161
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:48,528
- Come on, Boo Boo.
- Okay.

1162
01:09:50,236 --> 01:09:51,396
I was wrong, Yogi.

1163
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:54,004
I say from here on,
we just be proud of who we are...

1164
01:09:54,173 --> 01:09:57,267
...and fight for the things
we're passionate about, like this park.

1165
01:09:57,977 --> 01:09:59,001
And Rachel.

1166
01:09:59,178 --> 01:10:01,146
And pic-a-nic baskets?

1167
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:03,812
And pic-a-nic baskets.

1168
01:10:04,316 --> 01:10:06,648
- Aw, come here!
- No, you don't have to...

1169
01:10:09,989 --> 01:10:11,980
Okay. All right, that's...

1170
01:10:12,391 --> 01:10:14,188
I'm good.

1171
01:10:15,828 --> 01:10:19,195
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.

1172
01:10:19,365 --> 01:10:21,560
Hey, there, buddy.

1173
01:10:21,734 --> 01:10:25,534
No, no, no, I never took a kickback
on anything in my entire career.

1174
01:10:25,704 --> 01:10:27,535
No one loves turtles more than I do.

1175
01:10:27,706 --> 01:10:30,732
And nature in general. I love trees.

1176
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:32,370
Oh, no, you don't!

1177
01:10:36,882 --> 01:10:37,906
Gorilla?

1178
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:39,914
Himalayan snow leopard.

1179
01:10:40,586 --> 01:10:41,951
Huh.

1180
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:54,098
Welcome to Jellystone, home of
the frog-mouthed turtle. And brochures.

1181
01:10:54,266 --> 01:10:56,166
I'm Ranger Jones.

1182
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:59,600
<i>Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.</i>

1183
01:10:59,772 --> 01:11:02,434
<i>A wonderful little piece of paradise.</i>

1184
01:11:02,608 --> 01:11:06,635
<i>Where families come</i>
<i>and soak up the tranquility of nature.</i>

1185
01:11:07,746 --> 01:11:08,838
<i>It's a place that...</i>

1186
01:11:10,215 --> 01:11:11,739
<i>Huh?</i>

1187
01:11:13,419 --> 01:11:14,943
<i>Never mind.</i>

1188
01:11:15,654 --> 01:11:16,780
Hey, hey, hey!

1189
01:11:26,165 --> 01:11:27,894
Hi. Welcome.

1190
01:11:30,469 --> 01:11:34,200
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna
be staying in Jellystone for a while.

1191
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,500
And what animal will you be observing?

1192
01:11:36,675 --> 01:11:41,510
Well, I thought I would observe
the courting rituals of...

1193
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,307
...the American ranger.

1194
01:11:43,482 --> 01:11:47,578
I happen to hear the American ranger
is a very charming...

1195
01:11:47,753 --> 01:11:49,414
...intelligent, attractive species.

1196
01:11:49,588 --> 01:11:51,146
One that always keeps his cool.

1197
01:11:51,323 --> 01:11:54,918
Even when basket-stealing bears
push his buttons?

1198
01:11:55,094 --> 01:11:57,562
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.

1199
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,665
And I'm just not gonna let it
bother me anymore.

1200
01:12:00,833 --> 01:12:02,562
Besides...

1201
01:12:03,435 --> 01:12:05,767
...I have more important things
to focus on.

1202
01:12:07,506 --> 01:12:08,734
Oh...

1203
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:12,976
I...

1204
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:18,448
Let's... Let's try that again.

1205
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:28,024
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!

1206
01:12:28,193 --> 01:12:30,627
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!

1207
01:12:39,004 --> 01:12:41,700
Yogi!

1208
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:45,309
I love this place.

1209
01:12:46,845 --> 01:12:49,837
Yogi! Hey!
