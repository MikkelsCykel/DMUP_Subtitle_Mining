1
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,088
Where are they?

2
00:02:16,682 --> 00:02:19,880
They're probably just running late.
They'll be here.

3
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:24,599
I see them!

4
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:27,797
Daddy!

5
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:34,807
How are you, sweetie?

6
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:36,505
Good to see you.

7
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:41,839
- Hi there.
- How are you?

8
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:47,016
- He's cute. Great!
- Thanks.

9
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:49,225
We got to go.

10
00:02:49,683 --> 00:02:52,350
- We should go.
- I have my number.

11
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,215
I won't be in Chicago for a few days.
I'm going to the Cape...

12
00:02:57,475 --> 00:03:00,392
Same B & B as last year?
I have the number.

13
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,840
Say bye to your mom.

14
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,506
- Give me a kiss.
- Bye, Mom.

15
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,225
I love you.

16
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:11,465
Call me. Anytime.

17
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,434
- Bye.
- Love you.

18
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:25,091
Bye, Mom.

19
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:07,092
Sorry to be so late, ladies.

20
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:13,894
Financial consultant.
Recently divorced.

21
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:21,176
Did you notice the way
he ate his pancakes?

22
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:23,645
He took his time on every bite.

23
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:25,968
Get a grip.

24
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:30,270
You know what they say about
tall, lanky men, don't you?

25
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,937
They have enormous feet.

26
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:34,228
Morning.

27
00:04:34,562 --> 00:04:38,260
I happen to know he's going
to the theater today, a matinee.

28
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:40,687
I think I'll take the harbor tour.

29
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:04,971
"Dear Catherine:

30
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:08,065
I'm sorry I haven't talked to you
in so long.

31
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,565
I feel I've been lost...

32
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:13,513
...no bearings, no compass.

33
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:17,815
I kept crashing into things, a little
crazy, I guess.

34
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:21,899
I've never been lost before.

35
00:06:22,232 --> 00:06:24,389
You were my true north.

36
00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:29,305
I could always steer for home
when you were my home.

37
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:33,306
Forgive me for being so angry
when you left.

38
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:36,233
I still think
some mistake's been made...

39
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:39,233
...and I'm waiting for God
to take it back.

40
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,858
But I'm doing better now.

41
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:46,983
The work helps me.

42
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,858
Most of all, you help me.

43
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:55,233
You came into my dream last night
with that smile...

44
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:57,859
...that always held me
like a lover...

45
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:00,265
...rocked me like a child.

46
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:04,348
All I remember from the dream...

47
00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:06,432
...is a feeling of peace.

48
00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:14,192
I woke up with that feeling...

49
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:17,557
...and tried to keep it alive
as long as I could.

50
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:22,182
I'm writing to tell you that
I'm on a journey toward that peace.

51
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,557
And to tell you I'm sorry
about so many things.

52
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:31,526
I'm sorry I didn't take
better care of you...

53
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:35,985
...so you never spent a minute
being cold or scared or sick. "

54
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:44,350
"I'm sorry I didn't
try harder to find the words...

55
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,350
...to tell you what I was feeling.

56
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,850
I'm sorry I never fixed
the screen door.

57
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,350
I fixed it now.

58
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,486
I'm sorry I ever fought with you.

59
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:57,527
I'm sorry I didn't apologize more.

60
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,236
I was too proud.

61
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:01,944
I'm sorry I didn't
bring you more compliments...

62
00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:05,476
...on everything you wore and
every way you fixed your hair.

63
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:08,309
I'm sorry I didn't hold on to you
with so much strength...

64
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:10,861
...that even God
couldn't pull you away. "

65
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:13,101
Signed, "All my love, G."

66
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:16,726
That is so sad.

67
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,226
It's not that. It's just...

68
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:20,820
...so honest.

69
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:24,653
This could be hundreds of years old.

70
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:26,810
It's typed, Alva.

71
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:32,977
Pretty good.

72
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:34,977
Meaning you wish you'd written it.

73
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:37,195
I'd have e-mailed her.

74
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,477
Anyway, I know what you wish.

75
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:42,144
You wish it had been addressed
"Dear Theresa. "

76
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:45,310
Come on now, Charlie...

77
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:48,352
...any girl would want
to be loved like that.

78
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,904
To be somebody's "true north"?

79
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:52,644
Are you kidding?

80
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:56,352
Lonely women, particularly?

81
00:08:56,613 --> 00:08:58,071
Is that how you see me?

82
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:01,186
Did you talk to anybody on your trip?
Tell any jokes?

83
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:03,353
I had a good time.

84
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:04,696
Really?

85
00:09:04,946 --> 00:09:05,978
Came back a day early.

86
00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:09,228
I happen to like my job.

87
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:12,572
You're in denial.
You should be writing.

88
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,353
You better hope I stick to research.

89
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:17,270
I don't think you can
do your column without me.

90
00:09:17,614 --> 00:09:22,187
Ever notice that most people here refer
to me as Mr. Toschi, out of respect?

91
00:09:22,447 --> 00:09:24,822
I knew you before
your teeth were capped.

92
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:29,312
I knew you when your step was swift
and your heart was high.

93
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:33,697
Al Giddons, "Lakefront Winter. "
Harcourt-Brace, 1948.

94
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:36,406
Thought I made that up.

95
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:02,271
Hey, Jase! How are you?

96
00:10:02,657 --> 00:10:04,449
Hi, Lina.

97
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,532
No, sorry.

98
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:09,074
I just was expecting him to call.

99
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,105
No, I'm not worried. I just miss him.

100
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:14,939
I know.

101
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:18,147
What?

102
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:21,897
No, I just got it. Why?

103
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:26,439
What?

104
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:34,814
I can't believe he did this.

105
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,689
I can't believe it!

106
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:39,939
- Why are you so annoyed?
- It's wrong to print it.

107
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,950
It's private.
It's somebody's intimate thoughts.

108
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:45,981
It's not your letter!

109
00:10:46,242 --> 00:10:49,023
I know it's not my letter.
I found it.

110
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:51,742
Is this personal?
Is that why you're pissed off?

111
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:54,909
I'm not pissed off! I'm just...

112
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:57,742
...a little pissed off.

113
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:23,035
You had your chance
at the Christmas party.

114
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:25,743
Morning, doll.

115
00:11:27,868 --> 00:11:28,868
Look at this.

116
00:11:29,952 --> 00:11:32,983
Letters to the paper about
the message in the bottle.

117
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:34,108
What?

118
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:36,744
And two more boxes.
Take those to research.

119
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:39,483
I found him in the mailroom.
Nice ass.

120
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:41,817
Charlie wants us to drop everything.

121
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,817
And do what?
Answer all of them?

122
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:46,483
Go through them and
count the pros and cons.

123
00:11:46,744 --> 00:11:48,150
Get rid of the nutso letters.

124
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:52,077
Then we'll do excerpts. The paper
wants us to milk it. This is big.

125
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:54,202
Bigger than
the low-fat muffin scandal.

126
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:56,494
Bigger than
the mayor and the teacher.

127
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:58,119
It's amazing.

128
00:11:58,994 --> 00:12:00,869
"Your column sucks the big one. "

129
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:02,494
- Negative, I think.
- Listen.

130
00:12:02,744 --> 00:12:05,203
"If only more men would have
the sensitivity...

131
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:08,026
...to talk about how they feel,
instead of...

132
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:10,359
...hiding behind
the Sports Channel... "

133
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,828
"My niece sent it to me.

134
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:15,203
It might be from the same person.

135
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:17,495
So I'm enclosing it here. "

136
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:20,537
What?

137
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,287
What?

138
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:25,412
"Dear Catherine. "

139
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,360
No. Are you kidding? Really?

140
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,693
Out loud. Read it out loud.

141
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:37,287
"Dear Catherine:
There isn't an hour without you in it.

142
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:39,569
I mend the boats, test them...

143
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:43,079
...and all the while
the memories come in like the tide.

144
00:12:44,371 --> 00:12:46,444
I thought today
of when we were young...

145
00:12:46,704 --> 00:12:49,486
...and you left our world
for a bigger world.

146
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:52,746
I was a lot more scared
than I would admit.

147
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,778
I fought my fear...

148
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:57,788
...by telling myself
you'd come back someday...

149
00:12:58,038 --> 00:13:01,986
...and trying to think of the first
thing I'd say when I saw you again.

150
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:05,445
I must have tried out
100 possibilities.

151
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:08,028
What did I finally say?

152
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,486
Not much.

153
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,997
My mouth wouldn't work,
except to kiss you.

154
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,205
When you said, 'I'm here to stay'...

155
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:18,164
...that said it all.

156
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:20,778
Well, I'm doing it again.

157
00:13:23,247 --> 00:13:26,695
I keep imagining what I'd say to you
if somehow you came back. "

158
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:30,821
Bob. It's Theresa at the Tribune.

159
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:33,164
I know, it's been a while.

160
00:13:33,414 --> 00:13:35,071
I've got something for you.

161
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:36,529
It's two traces.

162
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:39,654
A sheet of stationery
has an imprint on it.

163
00:13:39,915 --> 00:13:42,373
Also,
where do I go for a typewriter trace?

164
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:44,331
The typewriter you're looking for...

165
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:47,113
...is an Olympic Herzfogen 980.

166
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:49,040
German. And old.

167
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,040
Would it have been sold commercially...

168
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,998
...in the last 30 years?

169
00:13:54,248 --> 00:13:55,873
Well, it's been re-keyed.

170
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:59,488
People who like manuals
buy these reconditioned.

171
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:03,082
This letter was probably typed
within the last 5 years.

172
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:04,790
So he's out there.

173
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:06,707
And he could be young.

174
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,155
You'll like this.

175
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,905
Remember the report I did?
Cork came back.

176
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,249
It's been in the water
approximately two years.

177
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:16,041
That's it? Two years?

178
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,749
Thank you.

179
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,072
Don't look at me.

180
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,572
Aqua glass.

181
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:22,864
Eighty-nine...

182
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,041
...looks like an "A."

183
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,166
I'm sending you Polaroids.

184
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:39,781
That sounds great.

185
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,615
You like the baby, then?

186
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:45,240
You're always so busy.

187
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,875
I never get a chance to talk to you.

188
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:49,990
- Hang up!
- Hang on one second.

189
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:54,865
Remember the message
on the restaurant wall in Virginia?

190
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:57,365
The stationery, the logo
and the typewriter are there.

191
00:14:57,626 --> 00:15:00,490
Hit line five.
She's waiting for you.

192
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:03,282
- I never get to talk to him.
- Call him back.

193
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:04,741
Can she fax it?

194
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:07,699
Fax it? It's Virginia.
Ellie's House of Crabs.

195
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,699
How do I know if
she has a fax machine?

196
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,241
Have her fax it.

197
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:13,116
Fine.

198
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:17,335
Right. Tell me about Bunker Hill.

199
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,366
"To all the ships at sea
and all the ports of call.

200
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:30,127
To my family and to all
friends and strangers. "

201
00:15:30,377 --> 00:15:32,335
- No "Dear Catherine"?
- Not this time.

202
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:34,710
The stationery
and typewriter check out.

203
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,794
We think maybe this is
the first one or the final one.

204
00:15:39,627 --> 00:15:42,002
"This is a message and a prayer.

205
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:45,252
The message is that my travels
taught me a great truth.

206
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:48,367
I already had what
everyone is searching for...

207
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:50,336
...and few ever find:

208
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:53,784
The one person in the world
who I was born to love forever.

209
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:56,169
A person like me, of the Outer Banks...

210
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:58,003
...and the blue Atlantic mystery. "

211
00:15:58,253 --> 00:15:59,993
Outer Banks.
That's North Carolina.

212
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:03,253
Right. But it's about a dozen towns.

213
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:06,868
Only four support a boat-building
and restoring company.

214
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:08,045
Then we got him.

215
00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:11,326
We've got stringers there,
and a sister paper in Wilmington.

216
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:14,285
I bet we find this guy
before the week's out.

217
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,493
Any bets, girls?

218
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:21,004
What?

219
00:16:21,254 --> 00:16:22,087
I want to go.

220
00:16:22,337 --> 00:16:23,660
She wants to do it.

221
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:25,743
You find this guy, then what?

222
00:16:26,004 --> 00:16:28,494
I don't know. I'm not sure.
But I want to go.

223
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:31,254
Can't spare you. Need you here.

224
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:37,160
You're the one that sent me to India
for the column on smokestacks.

225
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:40,671
You sent her to Texas for 3 days,
talking to Marines.

226
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:42,244
That was different.

227
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:44,494
Why do you have to
do this personally?

228
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:46,880
What do you mean?
I'm intrigued, so what?

229
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,994
Intrigued?

230
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:50,078
What if he's covered in tattoos...

231
00:16:50,338 --> 00:16:52,411
...and has four serious convictions?

232
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:53,963
Tell her.

233
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:57,547
I'm only afraid that...

234
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,922
...your expectations are too high.

235
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:02,380
I don't have any. This is research.

236
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:06,537
You're thinking Heathcliff.
You're thinking Hamlet.

237
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:09,120
This guy is probably Captain Ahab.

238
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:11,797
Are you saying that I can't go?

239
00:17:15,131 --> 00:17:17,172
It's called a risk, Charlie, right?

240
00:17:17,422 --> 00:17:19,881
Something you've been
telling me for two years.

241
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:21,673
"Take a risk. "

242
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:23,381
Remember when you asked
me to call...

243
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:26,381
...all the stationery stores
in the Outer Banks area?

244
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:29,746
- I've got other names for you.
- I got it.

245
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:32,048
What? You got what?

246
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,871
I called one in Morehead City.

247
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:36,506
They remembered
the little sailboat logo.

248
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:40,256
They said it was designed
by the customers.

249
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,090
It's them.

250
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:44,746
Don't tell Charlie.

251
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:47,246
He'll try and make you
do this over the phone.

252
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:48,788
You got him, Theresa.

253
00:17:49,423 --> 00:17:51,413
Now go knock on his door.

254
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:20,250
Ma'am?

255
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:24,844
Can I help you?

256
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:30,583
Sorry, I just admire these
older homes.

257
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:32,333
You're in real estate?

258
00:19:34,177 --> 00:19:35,011
No.

259
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,125
Could I take
a photograph of the house...

260
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:41,302
...for a publication?

261
00:19:41,552 --> 00:19:42,928
Jehovah's Witness?

262
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:47,292
Photograph.
Well, I never thought of that.

263
00:19:48,428 --> 00:19:50,053
Can't say yes or no.

264
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:51,584
And why's that?

265
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:53,167
That's my son's place.

266
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:56,293
I live back down...

267
00:19:56,553 --> 00:19:57,584
...thataway.

268
00:19:57,928 --> 00:20:00,053
So you're going to have to ask him.

269
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:03,501
He'll be kicking around the harbor.
Garret Blake.

270
00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:06,053
Never wears a hat.

271
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:08,845
Great. Thank you.

272
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:11,210
Is it Playboy?

273
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:14,710
I always admired your covers.

274
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:16,918
Never bought the magazine, though.

275
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,710
Well, there's always tomorrow.

276
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:54,847
Great day, isn't it?

277
00:20:55,097 --> 00:20:57,305
It's a beauty.
Wish I was out on the water.

278
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:58,930
Yeah, I bet.

279
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:04,170
Great boat.
Are you restoring it?

280
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,087
Yeah, doing the best I can.

281
00:21:08,306 --> 00:21:10,295
Do you restore boats for a living?

282
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:12,847
No, I'm just a weekend warrior.

283
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:15,556
You got a boat that
needs some work done?

284
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:16,639
Actually...

285
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:20,389
I got a man here in town.
He's got a shop.

286
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:23,296
He's working on the schooner there.

287
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:26,379
The 40-footer.
Sweet lines on that boat.

288
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,546
You can't beat the old woodies.

289
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:29,598
Great, thank you.

290
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:32,088
- You bet. You have a nice day.
- You too.

291
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:02,724
I love the older, the wooden boats.

292
00:22:03,183 --> 00:22:06,714
It must be a 40-footer?
A schooner, right?

293
00:22:06,974 --> 00:22:08,516
It's an Alden Schooner.

294
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:11,891
1922, out of Maine.

295
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:15,923
Is she yours?

296
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:18,808
Nope.

297
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:21,350
Just putting her back in shape.

298
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:23,840
Sweet lines.

299
00:22:28,308 --> 00:22:29,881
You want to step aboard?

300
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:35,715
There's some wet spots.

301
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:48,674
She's a beauty.

302
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:52,184
Was she in bad shape?

303
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:53,976
Neglected.

304
00:22:54,518 --> 00:22:55,351
Unappreciated.

305
00:22:56,893 --> 00:22:57,924
I know how she feels.

306
00:22:59,643 --> 00:23:00,476
Doubt it.

307
00:23:03,518 --> 00:23:04,351
You a tourist?

308
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:07,799
I'm just getting acquainted
with the place, the people.

309
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:11,091
I'm Theresa...

310
00:23:11,352 --> 00:23:12,268
...Osborne.

311
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,133
Garret Blake.

312
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:17,758
You sound like up north.

313
00:23:18,144 --> 00:23:19,342
Do I?

314
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:21,175
Chicago.

315
00:23:21,435 --> 00:23:22,550
I'm in research.

316
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,342
On what?

317
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:29,800
Just about everything.
For a newspaper.

318
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:34,884
Is there anywhere I can do
some sailing while I'm here?

319
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:37,478
You could rent
a boat on the other side.

320
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,426
Oh, no, I mean,
I'm not experienced...

321
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:41,551
...at all.

322
00:23:42,603 --> 00:23:44,561
I'd like to be. I just...

323
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,728
I'm from the Prairie State, so...

324
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,103
I'm a dodo in the water.

325
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:59,103
Sorry to have interrupted your work.
Thank you.

326
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:05,385
I'm taking her out tomorrow morning.

327
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:08,427
Test sail.
Round the point and back.

328
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:10,177
Just about an hour.

329
00:24:11,687 --> 00:24:13,062
Do you want to come along?

330
00:24:16,312 --> 00:24:17,427
That'd be nice.

331
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:19,062
About seven.

332
00:24:19,312 --> 00:24:20,344
Great!

333
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:23,479
If you come earlier...

334
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,302
...I'll be in that diner over there.

335
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:26,969
Earlier than seven?

336
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:30,719
Great. I'll see you here.

337
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:32,938
Or at the...

338
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:34,105
...at the diner.

339
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:09,387
- Hi, Chet. How you doing?
- All righty.

340
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:14,398
Jesus, Chet! You always have
the same people in here every day.

341
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:19,679
All the tourists go
to the Pancake Palace.

342
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,346
Let them!

343
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:26,096
And what do you got?
The same fishermen.

344
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:27,721
A would-be carpenter.

345
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:30,815
And a nearsighted mechanic.

346
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:33,638
And a thief who wants
to be a shipwright.

347
00:25:34,898 --> 00:25:36,888
Now don't start any shit, Johnny.

348
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:40,982
A thief is somebody who keeps
property belongs to somebody else.

349
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,024
Am I right?

350
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:45,857
You ain't right if the courts say
you ain't right, right?

351
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:48,430
Loudmouth asshole.

352
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:50,014
What'd you say?

353
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,191
How'd you know I was talking
to you, Johnny?

354
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:57,191
I'm calling Pete right now.

355
00:25:57,441 --> 00:26:01,056
You two bust up this place again
and charges will be pressed...

356
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:03,608
...arrests will be made,
and I ain't bluffing!

357
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:07,139
Man who's a thief
deserves to be in jail.

358
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,306
I never took a damn thing from you
or anybody in this town.

359
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:14,431
- I say different.
- You're a liar, Johnny.

360
00:26:14,692 --> 00:26:16,015
Don't ever call me a liar!

361
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:18,265
Come on, grab hold of him!

362
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:26,890
Will you guys get ahold of them?

363
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,348
Will you separate them?

364
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:32,692
Garret, come here.
Now get off him.

365
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:34,359
Get over here!

366
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:39,557
Now leave it alone.

367
00:26:39,817 --> 00:26:41,526
Just walk away for once.

368
00:26:42,984 --> 00:26:44,359
He ain't worth it.

369
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:46,932
Go on.

370
00:26:47,151 --> 00:26:49,026
Didn't you see what he...?

371
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,068
Come on, easy.

372
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:53,724
- Settle down, John.
- Go ahead, Garret.

373
00:26:53,985 --> 00:26:56,058
- He ain't worth it.
- Let me go!

374
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,693
It's all over.

375
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:25,850
Thought you wouldn't come.

376
00:27:26,736 --> 00:27:29,059
I came to say I'm not coming.

377
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:34,528
I didn't want to not show,
because I hate people like that.

378
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:37,184
I'm sorry you saw that.

379
00:27:37,986 --> 00:27:39,101
Does that happen a lot here?

380
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:41,768
I mean, instead of bowling or...

381
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:48,945
Maybe I'll see you around.

382
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:51,570
I'm still going to
run her out for a test.

383
00:27:54,112 --> 00:27:55,570
Just a short sail.

384
00:27:56,112 --> 00:27:58,945
I don't know, you know.
What if you got mad at me?

385
00:27:59,487 --> 00:28:00,977
It's a small boat.

386
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:03,852
I don't like fighting, Theresa.

387
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,279
Bowling, either.

388
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,779
Before you go, would you...

389
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:13,154
...untie that, toss it in?

390
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:15,519
Appreciate it.

391
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,696
Thanks.

392
00:28:57,781 --> 00:28:59,187
Where am I not in your way?

393
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,562
I'll get around you.

394
00:29:13,823 --> 00:29:15,781
Should I just jump over?

395
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,479
I'm sorry, I...

396
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:21,729
...I used to be better with people.

397
00:29:23,823 --> 00:29:25,448
So you used to be charming?

398
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:28,990
Sorry I missed that.

399
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:56,949
Who is that man in the diner?

400
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,075
It's an old thing.

401
00:30:00,783 --> 00:30:02,741
I don't want to pry.

402
00:30:03,158 --> 00:30:04,481
How old?

403
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:11,648
So this is what you do?
Research?

404
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:15,867
No, actually,
it's called conversation.

405
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,773
I might be able to help you.
I have a degree.

406
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:25,857
So you stole his girlfriend
in the eighth grade?

407
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,732
No.

408
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:31,440
I married his sister.

409
00:30:34,951 --> 00:30:36,149
So, your turn.

410
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:37,274
Right?

411
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:40,826
Still married?

412
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:44,524
You?

413
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:48,316
I have a son.

414
00:30:49,326 --> 00:30:50,493
A great son.

415
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,993
Date much?

416
00:30:55,827 --> 00:30:56,660
You?

417
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:00,441
You're getting the hang of this.

418
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:02,202
Watch your head with the boom.

419
00:31:45,828 --> 00:31:47,870
Do you hear from your mama?

420
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,276
Got a letter.

421
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:54,162
Still doesn't like you.

422
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,162
No fooling.

423
00:32:05,704 --> 00:32:08,235
Looks a little small for you.

424
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,819
What?

425
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:11,246
The jacket.

426
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:12,704
What jack...

427
00:32:15,538 --> 00:32:16,861
- It's hers.
- Whose?

428
00:32:17,913 --> 00:32:19,569
Woman from today.

429
00:32:19,996 --> 00:32:21,736
She left it on board.

430
00:32:23,163 --> 00:32:25,653
Well, did you tell her?
Did you call her?

431
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:27,038
No.

432
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:30,788
I thought maybe you'd drop it off
for me in town at the hotel.

433
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:34,455
I'm not going to do it.
Take her the jacket.

434
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,570
You don't want to see her again?

435
00:32:40,497 --> 00:32:41,330
Maybe.

436
00:32:41,622 --> 00:32:42,820
So?

437
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,112
So, Dad, it's not an easy thing.

438
00:32:50,122 --> 00:32:51,664
You be her.

439
00:32:52,247 --> 00:32:53,279
I'll be you.

440
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:55,862
Here's your jacket.

441
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,612
Jackets like that...

442
00:33:01,998 --> 00:33:04,571
...don't come along
every week, you know.

443
00:33:16,123 --> 00:33:17,290
One second.

444
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,874
You forgot this.

445
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:28,447
Thank you.

446
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:31,322
I stayed in.
I didn't even notice.

447
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:33,155
Thanks.

448
00:33:35,207 --> 00:33:36,614
You want to come in?

449
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:45,864
Nice place.

450
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,614
It's Victorian, 1911.

451
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:52,531
Made into an inn in 1944.

452
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,083
But...

453
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:56,291
...you probably knew all that stuff.

454
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,781
I've never been in here.

455
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:01,292
Oh, well.

456
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:04,531
Why would you be in here?
You're from here.

457
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,698
This is your hometown.

458
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,542
I had a really good time today.

459
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:15,448
The boat did well.

460
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:18,282
We didn't have to bail or anything.

461
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:26,699
Thanks for bringing the jacket.

462
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:28,334
You're welcome.

463
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,376
I just said thank you
about eight times...

464
00:34:32,626 --> 00:34:35,459
...because I have no idea
what to say.

465
00:34:36,084 --> 00:34:39,991
I wonder why you're here, because
you don't know what to say either.

466
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:41,533
I'm wondering that too.

467
00:34:50,543 --> 00:34:51,783
You eat meat?

468
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,085
Eat red meat?

469
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,283
Sometimes.

470
00:34:57,919 --> 00:35:00,408
I make a perfect steak.

471
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,669
It's the best thing I do.

472
00:35:07,586 --> 00:35:09,159
- You're bragging.
- I know.

473
00:35:10,377 --> 00:35:11,836
But it's true.

474
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,909
Well, that's very interesting.
Thanks for telling me.

475
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:20,669
I'd like to make you one...

476
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:22,284
...tomorrow night.

477
00:35:22,544 --> 00:35:23,742
You would?

478
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:32,618
You know, on the boat today...

479
00:35:32,878 --> 00:35:34,784
...I had a good time too.

480
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:43,201
What time?

481
00:35:44,754 --> 00:35:46,295
Six.

482
00:35:47,504 --> 00:35:49,629
It's 18 Foster Lane.

483
00:35:50,004 --> 00:35:51,035
I know.

484
00:35:52,129 --> 00:35:53,077
You do?

485
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:55,962
I know...

486
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:58,285
...it's got to be on the water.
Right?

487
00:35:59,421 --> 00:36:01,994
Right. Everything's on the water.

488
00:36:04,046 --> 00:36:05,952
- Night.
- See you.

489
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,714
You found it.

490
00:36:37,547 --> 00:36:38,745
Come in.

491
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,370
I didn't know you were so close.

492
00:36:41,714 --> 00:36:43,089
You walked!

493
00:36:44,547 --> 00:36:45,745
I hope you like red.

494
00:36:46,214 --> 00:36:48,370
I do. I already have one opened.

495
00:36:51,464 --> 00:36:52,704
You need some help?

496
00:36:52,964 --> 00:36:53,798
No.

497
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:55,089
Just...

498
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,048
...make yourself welcome.

499
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,829
- Can I pour you a glass?
- Yeah, please.

500
00:37:06,215 --> 00:37:07,788
What a great house!

501
00:37:09,382 --> 00:37:10,840
The light in here...

502
00:37:24,924 --> 00:37:27,247
I love this boat painting.

503
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:30,007
It's incredible.
You can hear it, almost.

504
00:37:30,257 --> 00:37:31,455
The wind.

505
00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:34,622
Is it a local artist?

506
00:37:35,424 --> 00:37:37,049
It's my wife, Catherine.

507
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:40,747
She died two years ago.

508
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,175
I'm sorry.

509
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:18,665
Do you paint also?

510
00:38:27,968 --> 00:38:30,801
My dad died when I was in college.

511
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:34,208
I remember my mom kept
one of his shirts...

512
00:38:34,468 --> 00:38:37,551
...on the back of a chair
in my parents' bedroom.

513
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:40,374
And she probably
left it there for...

514
00:38:42,718 --> 00:38:44,958
Maybe it's still there,
I don't know.

515
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,845
Look, I was nervous...

516
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:29,876
...so I drank too much wine.

517
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:34,126
But listen, there's something
that I should tell you.

518
00:39:34,387 --> 00:39:36,293
I was nervous too.

519
00:39:39,012 --> 00:39:40,012
I just...

520
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:45,012
What?

521
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,085
I didn't...

522
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:56,044
I don't do this.

523
00:39:56,346 --> 00:39:57,429
Thank God.

524
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:59,304
I don't do this either.

525
00:39:59,554 --> 00:40:00,877
I'm not good at this.

526
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:09,138
For two people that don't do it,
we do it pretty well.

527
00:40:15,722 --> 00:40:18,336
Does it feel cold enough for a fire?

528
00:40:25,514 --> 00:40:28,003
I thought we were still in love.

529
00:40:29,347 --> 00:40:31,670
But maybe I didn't even
think about it...

530
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:35,764
...because I had my son,
my work, my husband.

531
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:38,889
I was on my way to becoming a writer.

532
00:40:39,264 --> 00:40:41,004
And David and I...

533
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:44,514
...were even talking about
having a second child.

534
00:40:45,514 --> 00:40:47,223
Can you believe that?

535
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:51,212
Then one day I was just
driving along...

536
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:55,004
...and I saw them.

537
00:40:56,973 --> 00:40:58,848
David and this woman...

538
00:41:00,432 --> 00:41:02,140
...walking into the park.

539
00:41:05,515 --> 00:41:08,598
And it was just a glimpse.
It was a second.

540
00:41:08,848 --> 00:41:10,390
And I knew.

541
00:41:12,765 --> 00:41:16,672
I sat there in my car. I didn't
shut off the engine. I just sat...

542
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,672
...for an hour and a half.

543
00:41:21,724 --> 00:41:23,797
You're faced with the impossible...

544
00:41:24,057 --> 00:41:25,849
...and it takes an hour and a half.

545
00:41:34,766 --> 00:41:37,006
It was going on almost a year.

546
00:41:45,308 --> 00:41:47,839
I can't believe I just
told you all that.

547
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:52,683
I mean, this stuff
happens to everybody, right?

548
00:41:55,225 --> 00:41:57,600
But it happened to you, Theresa.

549
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,809
And I'm sorry.

550
00:42:08,142 --> 00:42:11,174
That kind of stuff
happen in St. Claire?

551
00:42:12,226 --> 00:42:14,893
Everything happens in St. Claire...

552
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:17,716
...eventually.

553
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:28,601
Tell me about Catherine.

554
00:42:33,477 --> 00:42:34,560
Well...

555
00:42:36,977 --> 00:42:38,935
...we grew up together.

556
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,185
She was kind of...

557
00:42:46,185 --> 00:42:49,717
People were drawn to her
by her smile...

558
00:42:50,144 --> 00:42:51,467
...her enthusiasm.

559
00:42:54,936 --> 00:42:57,852
She could brighten up
a whole room...

560
00:42:58,144 --> 00:42:59,634
...whole town.

561
00:43:03,728 --> 00:43:06,342
I called her Saint Catherine.

562
00:43:11,686 --> 00:43:13,061
How did she die?

563
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:18,884
She was ill.

564
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,843
She was fragile.

565
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:25,395
I'm sorry.

566
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:30,687
It's all right.

567
00:43:31,062 --> 00:43:31,927
It's okay.

568
00:43:33,854 --> 00:43:35,395
Have you lived here
your whole life?

569
00:43:35,645 --> 00:43:36,593
Not yet.

570
00:43:39,729 --> 00:43:40,896
This place...

571
00:43:42,104 --> 00:43:44,479
...used to be all dirt roads
and marsh grass.

572
00:43:44,729 --> 00:43:45,646
Really?

573
00:43:46,312 --> 00:43:47,687
My mom hated it here.

574
00:43:47,938 --> 00:43:50,938
She took me away to Virginia
when I was ten.

575
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:53,302
But I came back when I was 16...

576
00:43:55,021 --> 00:43:56,479
...and never left.

577
00:43:57,146 --> 00:43:59,553
I missed it.
I missed the smell of it...

578
00:43:59,813 --> 00:44:01,553
...working on the water...

579
00:44:02,396 --> 00:44:03,771
...missed my dad.

580
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:07,511
The quiet.

581
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,095
The wind.

582
00:44:11,688 --> 00:44:13,813
The wind?
You call that wind?

583
00:44:14,272 --> 00:44:15,386
The wind...

584
00:44:15,897 --> 00:44:18,022
...in Chicago in the wintertime...

585
00:44:19,147 --> 00:44:22,262
...you walk with your back to it
or it cuts your face.

586
00:44:22,522 --> 00:44:23,553
Takes your breath away.

587
00:44:28,064 --> 00:44:30,106
We got the oldest oak tree...

588
00:44:30,397 --> 00:44:31,772
...in both Carolinas.

589
00:44:32,481 --> 00:44:34,856
You try and top that.

590
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:44,556
I just want to be close.

591
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:20,901
Watch the dust.

592
00:46:25,276 --> 00:46:26,985
She took a look at my plans...

593
00:46:27,235 --> 00:46:29,058
...and never said a word.

594
00:46:30,193 --> 00:46:32,975
A week later she had it on canvas.

595
00:46:33,568 --> 00:46:35,891
This was going to be the first.

596
00:46:38,402 --> 00:46:40,975
Designing and building
my own boats...

597
00:46:41,777 --> 00:46:43,267
...that was the plan.

598
00:46:45,027 --> 00:46:47,402
This was going to be
my signature boat...

599
00:46:47,652 --> 00:46:49,277
...the one we'd never sell.

600
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:53,236
And when will you finish it?

601
00:46:57,611 --> 00:47:00,069
I haven't touched it in two years.

602
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,111
Someday.

603
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:04,601
Right.

604
00:47:05,903 --> 00:47:06,934
Someday.

605
00:47:08,778 --> 00:47:10,601
And you'll take me out
on that boat?

606
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:14,143
Around the point, where the wind
will scare me to death?

607
00:47:18,945 --> 00:47:20,768
There will be no wind tonight.

608
00:47:23,404 --> 00:47:24,726
And you know that?

609
00:47:27,112 --> 00:47:28,987
I'm the son of a fisherman.

610
00:47:29,404 --> 00:47:31,195
You watch the Weather Channel.

611
00:47:32,446 --> 00:47:34,519
Will you sail with me tonight?

612
00:47:39,571 --> 00:47:41,477
I go back in a few days.

613
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:45,811
And I can't change that,
because my son's coming home.

614
00:47:46,404 --> 00:47:49,738
I don't know if this makes sense.
Maybe...

615
00:48:01,697 --> 00:48:03,655
Well, that's a mistake...

616
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,436
...letting her taste your coffee.

617
00:48:07,822 --> 00:48:09,614
Well, she liked it last night.

618
00:48:09,905 --> 00:48:11,728
She was just being polite.

619
00:48:12,364 --> 00:48:14,739
Nobody likes it, take my word.

620
00:48:15,405 --> 00:48:16,353
Be good.

621
00:48:19,822 --> 00:48:20,822
Oh, Lord.

622
00:48:21,364 --> 00:48:22,281
Now what?

623
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:28,395
Go easy.

624
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,229
Hold it right there.

625
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:39,406
You stay out of our way!

626
00:48:39,656 --> 00:48:41,031
You're not welcome here, Johnny.

627
00:48:41,281 --> 00:48:42,688
You better stay out of our way!
Both of you!

628
00:48:42,948 --> 00:48:44,688
Guess the courts
turned you down again?

629
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,782
- It's not your business.
- It's settled.

630
00:48:47,032 --> 00:48:49,105
No, we just want the paintings.

631
00:48:49,365 --> 00:48:50,771
They were part of our life here, Marta.

632
00:48:51,032 --> 00:48:53,271
The only one who sees them is you.

633
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:55,240
People should see them.

634
00:48:56,032 --> 00:48:57,230
Please, Garret.

635
00:48:57,782 --> 00:48:59,574
It's all you left us of her.

636
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:04,032
That's the first time you
called me her killer, Hank...

637
00:49:04,282 --> 00:49:05,282
...at least to my face.

638
00:49:05,532 --> 00:49:06,855
Nobody killed her.

639
00:49:07,116 --> 00:49:10,064
He left her alone when
she was sick and weak.

640
00:49:10,324 --> 00:49:12,647
- She wanted to come home to us!
- This was her home!

641
00:49:12,907 --> 00:49:14,074
Now he's killing her mother.

642
00:49:14,324 --> 00:49:16,366
I hear her heart break
every goddamn day.

643
00:49:16,616 --> 00:49:18,158
I gave you everything of hers.

644
00:49:18,408 --> 00:49:20,481
The paintings!
You got yourself another woman.

645
00:49:20,741 --> 00:49:23,439
- What the hell do you care?
- You son of a bitch.

646
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,158
Just stay out of this.

647
00:49:25,408 --> 00:49:26,575
Step aside!

648
00:49:30,616 --> 00:49:31,731
She painted them here.

649
00:49:32,241 --> 00:49:33,325
She hung them here.

650
00:49:34,158 --> 00:49:37,075
She was the last to touch them!
That's how it'll stay!

651
00:49:39,408 --> 00:49:41,565
This is what you want, isn't it?

652
00:49:42,075 --> 00:49:44,117
If I cut it up
you can all have a piece.

653
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:45,648
You can all have a piece of her!

654
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,523
Just set it down, Dad.

655
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:49,575
Step aside!

656
00:49:52,576 --> 00:49:53,898
My God...

657
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:57,065
...is this what she is to you?

658
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:02,274
Something to fight over, pull apart?
Look at you.

659
00:50:02,701 --> 00:50:04,993
All three of you
have blood in your eyes.

660
00:50:05,409 --> 00:50:06,691
Is that for Catherine?

661
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:11,368
Or is that so you can walk around and
beat your chest like a bunch of apes?

662
00:50:11,618 --> 00:50:13,108
Goddamn it, you're outside of this.

663
00:50:13,368 --> 00:50:14,910
Well, I loved her too.

664
00:50:15,243 --> 00:50:17,451
And I want something
to remember her by.

665
00:50:17,701 --> 00:50:19,358
Piece of this will do.

666
00:50:25,535 --> 00:50:26,702
She'd hate this!

667
00:50:27,118 --> 00:50:28,316
She'd hate it, Hank.

668
00:50:28,577 --> 00:50:29,983
Dodge is right.
She'd hate this...

669
00:50:30,244 --> 00:50:31,702
...worse than dying!

670
00:50:52,494 --> 00:50:53,692
Crazy people.

671
00:50:55,661 --> 00:50:57,870
They're only half the war.

672
00:50:59,911 --> 00:51:02,693
You saw them.
You heard what they said.

673
00:51:04,203 --> 00:51:06,901
But you carry your half around
pretty good too.

674
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:39,292
Are you okay with this?

675
00:53:47,459 --> 00:53:48,782
Until you...

676
00:53:53,917 --> 00:53:57,907
...I didn't even think about
being close to anybody else.

677
00:53:58,876 --> 00:54:00,251
Sometimes...

678
00:54:07,418 --> 00:54:09,293
...I still feel her. She's...

679
00:54:10,126 --> 00:54:11,324
...here.

680
00:54:12,835 --> 00:54:15,293
And I don't want to
cheat you, Theresa.

681
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:18,546
You're going to eat
that whole bag?

682
00:55:18,796 --> 00:55:20,671
Why do you have
two bags of marshmallows?

683
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,254
Ammo.

684
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:04,005
Wait.

685
00:56:06,922 --> 00:56:08,745
It's so great here.

686
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:34,996
It was so nice outside.

687
00:56:35,257 --> 00:56:38,340
I decided to set the table out there.
Is that okay?

688
00:56:40,298 --> 00:56:42,590
You said to come in, right?

689
00:56:43,632 --> 00:56:44,747
I know.

690
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:48,465
We can eat
in the kitchen if you want.

691
00:56:48,715 --> 00:56:53,122
And I got angel food cake,
so I hope your dad likes cake.

692
00:57:01,591 --> 00:57:03,497
I was going to put that back.

693
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:10,591
Look, I just didn't know
where the boundaries were.

694
00:57:16,758 --> 00:57:19,289
I didn't know where
the boundaries were either.

695
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,456
Let me get this out of the way.
I'm sorry.

696
00:57:22,717 --> 00:57:23,665
I really...

697
00:57:26,592 --> 00:57:27,456
Let me get it.

698
00:57:27,717 --> 00:57:29,259
Let me clean it up, okay?

699
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,425
- I'll get a rag. I can do it.
- I'll get it.

700
00:57:33,675 --> 00:57:34,790
I said, I'll get it!

701
00:57:38,842 --> 00:57:40,915
Just give me a minute.

702
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:04,333
So you're the jacket.

703
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,093
Yeah, that's me.

704
00:58:07,343 --> 00:58:09,958
You were looking around here
a couple days ago.

705
00:58:10,218 --> 00:58:11,541
Find what you wanted?

706
00:58:12,968 --> 00:58:14,083
I don't know.

707
00:58:15,343 --> 00:58:16,885
I'm Theresa.

708
00:58:18,927 --> 00:58:20,094
Dodge.

709
00:58:21,052 --> 00:58:22,333
Like the pickup.

710
00:58:23,344 --> 00:58:26,208
He said you were pretty.
He should've said beautiful.

711
00:58:26,844 --> 00:58:28,667
Why didn't he inherit that charm?

712
00:58:29,761 --> 00:58:32,219
You had a fight.
That's a good sign.

713
00:58:33,052 --> 00:58:34,334
I made a mistake.

714
00:58:36,344 --> 00:58:38,959
I moved something
out of its place.

715
00:58:41,344 --> 00:58:43,386
Don't pay that any mind.

716
00:58:43,845 --> 00:58:45,084
He's still not right about it.

717
00:58:45,428 --> 00:58:48,345
It's like a truck hit him.
Swear to God.

718
00:58:52,178 --> 00:58:56,043
Clams, better here than anywhere.
Come on inside.

719
00:58:57,137 --> 00:58:58,845
It's pretty crowded in there.

720
00:59:01,345 --> 00:59:02,918
You want to take a walk?

721
00:59:08,887 --> 00:59:10,262
He won't tell you much.

722
00:59:10,512 --> 00:59:13,127
The man talks
about as much as a fish.

723
00:59:13,721 --> 00:59:14,804
Anyway...

724
00:59:15,054 --> 00:59:17,721
...wasn't good
right from the beginning.

725
00:59:18,512 --> 00:59:21,127
Her family thought
that she would be the one...

726
00:59:21,388 --> 00:59:24,669
...to bust out of here
and just shake the world.

727
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:26,888
Garret was too much like them.

728
00:59:27,138 --> 00:59:30,221
They thought, anyway,
that he would be...

729
00:59:31,763 --> 00:59:34,711
...an anchor around her,
keep her life small.

730
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:37,544
How did she die?

731
00:59:39,847 --> 00:59:43,045
Pregnancy just took
the stuffing right out of her.

732
00:59:44,972 --> 00:59:47,972
Keeled over at her parents' house
and they kept her there.

733
00:59:48,222 --> 00:59:52,003
So Garret went over
and kicked the door down.

734
00:59:52,264 --> 00:59:53,920
Carried her out.

735
00:59:54,264 --> 00:59:55,753
She was glad too.

736
00:59:57,347 --> 01:00:00,962
He took care of her
the best he could...

737
01:00:02,014 --> 01:00:04,420
...for about a month, I guess.
And then...

738
01:00:05,431 --> 01:00:06,972
Well, she just...

739
01:00:07,222 --> 01:00:08,545
...gave out.

740
01:00:16,098 --> 01:00:19,046
Now you know why Garret
don't talk much.

741
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:22,598
Because his old man never shuts up.

742
01:00:22,848 --> 01:00:24,556
Can we eat now?

743
01:00:31,723 --> 01:00:33,682
You ought to
knock down some walls.

744
01:00:33,932 --> 01:00:35,724
It's getting too crowded in there.

745
01:00:36,307 --> 01:00:37,630
Can't afford it.

746
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:39,515
Do the work ourselves.

747
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:42,005
Just end up looking like a boat.

748
01:00:42,265 --> 01:00:43,505
Add a deck.

749
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,963
A couple of rooms.

750
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:48,224
Why? You thinking about moving in?

751
01:00:51,932 --> 01:00:54,880
Not in a million years.
You'd like that though, wouldn't you?

752
01:00:55,141 --> 01:00:56,255
Keep your eye on me.

753
01:00:56,516 --> 01:00:58,839
He's afraid I'm going to
go back to my old habit.

754
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:00,422
Anybody want any cake?

755
01:01:00,683 --> 01:01:02,058
I used to drink like a fish.

756
01:01:02,308 --> 01:01:04,631
It ruined my health.
It's no deep, dark secret.

757
01:01:04,891 --> 01:01:07,756
Well, it's no citizen award
either.

758
01:01:08,016 --> 01:01:10,058
Two beers a day, that's my limit.

759
01:01:10,308 --> 01:01:12,048
Change the subject?

760
01:01:17,725 --> 01:01:20,475
The subject is change.
People change.

761
01:01:20,725 --> 01:01:23,642
Even you.
That is the subject.

762
01:01:24,475 --> 01:01:25,934
Good dinner.

763
01:01:29,767 --> 01:01:31,392
You were the best thing about it.

764
01:01:31,642 --> 01:01:35,965
If I was about 150 years younger,
you'd be in trouble, young lady.

765
01:01:38,101 --> 01:01:39,382
Where you going?

766
01:01:40,767 --> 01:01:43,059
Taking my dessert on the beach.

767
01:01:43,309 --> 01:01:44,507
Thanks.

768
01:01:51,268 --> 01:01:52,810
He likes me.

769
01:01:54,435 --> 01:01:55,383
Well, he's a...

770
01:01:55,726 --> 01:01:57,101
...good man.

771
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,966
He said you were a pain in the ass.

772
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:07,935
Kidding. That was me.

773
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:11,758
Well, he's right.

774
01:02:14,102 --> 01:02:16,425
You are the best thing
about this dinner.

775
01:02:17,435 --> 01:02:19,592
And this day...

776
01:02:21,602 --> 01:02:23,811
...and this year.

777
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:30,384
I wish it was simpler.

778
01:02:32,103 --> 01:02:33,811
I wish it was easier.

779
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,592
And I'm sorry.

780
01:03:25,605 --> 01:03:27,730
Well, I'm not expecting flowers, but...

781
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,605
...will we call each other?

782
01:03:30,396 --> 01:03:31,428
Well...

783
01:03:32,063 --> 01:03:33,886
...look, I was kind of...

784
01:03:34,147 --> 01:03:35,720
...hoping for flowers.

785
01:03:43,564 --> 01:03:45,272
I could live here.

786
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,022
I didn't say that to scare you.

787
01:03:50,272 --> 01:03:52,512
I scared you, didn't I?

788
01:03:57,772 --> 01:03:59,814
So will you come and visit me?

789
01:04:00,647 --> 01:04:01,679
You mean inland?

790
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:03,846
I don't go inland.

791
01:04:05,356 --> 01:04:06,471
We have a lake.

792
01:04:07,398 --> 01:04:09,054
A big lake.

793
01:04:09,606 --> 01:04:12,940
Okay. I'll just go back to
my work and my son and...

794
01:04:14,773 --> 01:04:16,929
...you'll just forget about me, right?

795
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:20,107
Every day.

796
01:04:25,107 --> 01:04:27,013
I've got your number, sailor.

797
01:04:27,607 --> 01:04:29,596
And you've got mine. So...

798
01:04:42,774 --> 01:04:43,805
Bye.

799
01:06:13,277 --> 01:06:15,350
- And then what happened?
- Later, later.

800
01:06:16,777 --> 01:06:18,850
The wanderer returns.
How are you?

801
01:06:19,444 --> 01:06:21,517
Yeah? So, solve your mystery?

802
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,142
There was no mystery.

803
01:06:24,403 --> 01:06:26,392
He lost his wife, Catherine.

804
01:06:27,028 --> 01:06:28,403
She was an artist.

805
01:06:28,653 --> 01:06:31,059
And dead but not forgotten.

806
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,320
Right. So that's it,
end of story?

807
01:06:34,611 --> 01:06:37,101
Basically, yeah.
There's no story.

808
01:06:37,611 --> 01:06:40,184
Kind of like...
Was it me that said that?

809
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,351
So!

810
01:06:42,612 --> 01:06:44,768
Toodle-loo, on your way.
That's enough.

811
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:48,403
Any regrets?

812
01:06:49,862 --> 01:06:50,695
Zip.

813
01:06:50,945 --> 01:06:52,518
No? Good.

814
01:06:56,945 --> 01:06:58,571
So, what was she like?

815
01:07:02,112 --> 01:07:05,394
She's beautiful and wispy and...

816
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:07,529
...a great artist.

817
01:07:08,071 --> 01:07:09,529
And she's everywhere.

818
01:07:09,779 --> 01:07:11,238
She's in his house.

819
01:07:11,488 --> 01:07:13,727
She's in the shop.

820
01:07:14,404 --> 01:07:15,436
The whole town knew her.

821
01:07:15,696 --> 01:07:17,155
Is he still in love with her?

822
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,821
She isn't gone.

823
01:08:01,906 --> 01:08:04,604
That's for you.
And that's very interesting.

824
01:08:23,449 --> 01:08:25,105
Research. This is Theresa.

825
01:08:27,407 --> 01:08:28,730
It's me.

826
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:31,647
Garret.

827
01:08:32,324 --> 01:08:33,491
I know.

828
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:37,314
Sorry, I've been...

829
01:08:38,157 --> 01:08:40,116
I'm finishing the boat.

830
01:08:41,449 --> 01:08:42,397
My boat.

831
01:08:43,783 --> 01:08:45,574
Ljust wanted to tell you.

832
01:08:46,324 --> 01:08:47,814
How are you?

833
01:08:50,075 --> 01:08:52,231
It's been a quiet few weeks.

834
01:08:55,825 --> 01:08:57,148
I didn't know...

835
01:08:57,408 --> 01:08:58,814
...what to say.

836
01:09:00,325 --> 01:09:01,898
I still don't.

837
01:09:02,783 --> 01:09:04,273
Need some help?

838
01:09:05,492 --> 01:09:07,981
I was counting on it.

839
01:09:10,284 --> 01:09:11,367
Question:

840
01:09:11,617 --> 01:09:14,982
Were we just a casual thing
or something else?

841
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:17,659
Possibly a beginning?

842
01:09:17,909 --> 01:09:20,065
Just answers, no pressure.

843
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:27,107
Just a playboy?
Nail those tourist women.

844
01:09:27,368 --> 01:09:28,649
I've only...

845
01:09:29,576 --> 01:09:32,357
...cared about two women
in my whole life.

846
01:09:32,826 --> 01:09:34,201
Catherine and...?

847
01:09:34,451 --> 01:09:36,326
Some city girl.

848
01:09:36,743 --> 01:09:38,066
Big mouth.

849
01:09:38,326 --> 01:09:39,608
Pushy.

850
01:09:41,493 --> 01:09:42,660
Thanks.

851
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:46,285
You just called
to tell me about the boat?

852
01:09:48,327 --> 01:09:49,358
I miss you.

853
01:09:51,285 --> 01:09:53,191
I miss all of it.

854
01:09:57,910 --> 01:10:00,202
Why don't you come see me, Garret?

855
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:04,744
It's just a visit.
It's not a promise.

856
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,911
Is that enough?

857
01:10:09,077 --> 01:10:11,744
Listen, you think I'm betting on us,
but I'm not.

858
01:10:11,994 --> 01:10:14,150
I'm just as scared as you are.

859
01:10:15,161 --> 01:10:17,119
And I miss you too.

860
01:10:19,661 --> 01:10:21,453
Okay. When?

861
01:10:22,578 --> 01:10:25,109
When should I come?

862
01:10:26,578 --> 01:10:28,151
Yesterday.

863
01:10:29,286 --> 01:10:31,276
You're not coming by boat,
are you?

864
01:10:32,286 --> 01:10:34,693
Jet Ski? Windsurfer?

865
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:46,870
So behave yourself.

866
01:10:47,745 --> 01:10:48,745
You got your ticket?

867
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:53,068
Of course I have my ticket.

868
01:10:53,704 --> 01:10:55,162
Got my name on all my clothes.

869
01:10:55,454 --> 01:10:57,829
And I got a quarter for a phone call.

870
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:00,246
You got a gift for that kid of hers?

871
01:11:01,288 --> 01:11:03,496
Get one at the airplane gift shop.

872
01:11:04,288 --> 01:11:07,319
Don't get into any fights
or anything.

873
01:11:07,996 --> 01:11:08,944
There it comes.

874
01:11:09,246 --> 01:11:11,152
Right on time,
just like your old man.

875
01:11:11,413 --> 01:11:12,736
Don't throw your back out.

876
01:11:12,996 --> 01:11:14,819
Take your pills.

877
01:11:15,496 --> 01:11:20,236
By my count, there should be 2 beers
left in the fridge when I get back.

878
01:11:21,122 --> 01:11:23,736
That's a sorry occupation,
counting other people's beers.

879
01:11:23,997 --> 01:11:26,663
If you get Kenny or
any tourist kids to score you beer...

880
01:11:26,913 --> 01:11:28,080
...I'll hear about it.

881
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:30,486
I got two counties covered.

882
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:36,320
That lady sure got you gut-hooked.

883
01:11:38,289 --> 01:11:39,778
How'd you get to be so mean?

884
01:11:40,831 --> 01:11:41,997
See you in a week.

885
01:11:44,164 --> 01:11:46,456
The hell you say!

886
01:11:47,289 --> 01:11:49,862
Not with your
plane ticket on the seat here!

887
01:12:00,748 --> 01:12:01,779
Good dog.

888
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:28,874
I think he's here, Mom.

889
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:37,239
You're kind of nervous.

890
01:12:37,499 --> 01:12:38,583
Really?

891
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:40,291
I look great though, right?

892
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:43,750
Okay, is what I meant.

893
01:12:50,125 --> 01:12:51,750
You made it.

894
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:54,531
Come in.

895
01:13:03,959 --> 01:13:07,042
I think he's disappointed that
you don't have a captain's hat on.

896
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:09,834
That's what he was expecting.
Right?

897
01:13:10,084 --> 01:13:11,459
Come on in.

898
01:13:19,626 --> 01:13:23,126
I don't know if it suits
a boy your age, but...

899
01:13:23,376 --> 01:13:24,241
It's great.

900
01:13:24,959 --> 01:13:26,282
Thanks.

901
01:13:27,126 --> 01:13:28,407
Sweet, Garret.

902
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,585
He's into this mayhem thing.

903
01:13:36,835 --> 01:13:38,626
I think it's a male deal.

904
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,668
Garret, thank you.

905
01:13:45,418 --> 01:13:47,293
She hates chocolates.

906
01:13:47,627 --> 01:13:49,002
It's really weird.

907
01:13:49,252 --> 01:13:50,116
True?

908
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:56,127
Yes, but it was very sweet of you.

909
01:13:56,585 --> 01:13:57,961
Excuse me.

910
01:14:03,169 --> 01:14:05,211
Thank you.
That's what I really wanted.

911
01:14:14,961 --> 01:14:17,117
You got to be beat, no?

912
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:21,836
I hope this is okay.

913
01:14:22,086 --> 01:14:23,909
This is fine.

914
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:26,326
I mean, this is perfect.

915
01:14:27,962 --> 01:14:32,118
Tomorrow night, Jason will be at
a friend's house. So...

916
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,076
Meaning what?

917
01:14:36,337 --> 01:14:37,618
Shut up.

918
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:41,837
- I know this isn't very romantic.
- What?

919
01:14:42,087 --> 01:14:43,202
This is my life.

920
01:14:43,462 --> 01:14:45,254
No, this is...

921
01:14:45,504 --> 01:14:47,077
...nice.

922
01:14:47,337 --> 01:14:48,504
It's nice.

923
01:14:48,754 --> 01:14:50,910
I just want you to know me.

924
01:14:51,504 --> 01:14:54,338
Just the day-to-day, regular me.

925
01:14:56,629 --> 01:14:58,369
You think you know me?

926
01:15:19,672 --> 01:15:20,536
What?

927
01:15:21,213 --> 01:15:22,130
What?

928
01:15:24,547 --> 01:15:25,870
He's not coming.

929
01:15:29,297 --> 01:15:30,922
But I've come so far.

930
01:15:37,881 --> 01:15:40,037
I don't even know.

931
01:15:44,173 --> 01:15:45,829
I'm glad you're here.

932
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:49,256
I'm glad I'm here too.

933
01:16:08,507 --> 01:16:10,080
We're almost there.

934
01:16:23,132 --> 01:16:24,622
Wait. Is that him?

935
01:16:25,174 --> 01:16:26,205
That's him.

936
01:16:29,091 --> 01:16:30,914
Oh, my God.
Don't say a word.

937
01:16:31,216 --> 01:16:32,383
Hey, buddy!

938
01:16:32,633 --> 01:16:33,633
What are you doing here?

939
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:37,175
Train's pretty cool.

940
01:16:37,425 --> 01:16:38,800
Can I use the computer?

941
01:16:42,675 --> 01:16:44,216
Jason wanted to surprise you.

942
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:46,539
- Hope it's okay.
- It's fine.

943
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,883
It's only for a minute, then
we'll hop back on that train.

944
01:16:50,133 --> 01:16:51,623
He's scared of it, Mom.

945
01:16:53,467 --> 01:16:55,175
I'm not scared of it.

946
01:16:58,342 --> 01:17:00,248
Annie. Garret.

947
01:17:02,675 --> 01:17:05,207
This is where I work.

948
01:17:10,967 --> 01:17:12,509
It was nice meeting you.

949
01:17:20,468 --> 01:17:23,801
Well, now I can
picture you on the job.

950
01:17:28,676 --> 01:17:30,635
So that's him. That's Ahab?

951
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,916
That's him.
He's no Captain Ahab.

952
01:17:33,177 --> 01:17:34,802
Smile at him. Be friendly.

953
01:17:36,677 --> 01:17:38,416
- Friendly people.
- I know.

954
01:17:38,677 --> 01:17:40,666
He's smiling at her.
That's sweet.

955
01:17:40,885 --> 01:17:42,625
Oh, behave!

956
01:17:43,844 --> 01:17:47,458
You're so negative, Charlie.
Don't you want her to be happy?

957
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:51,417
She'll smell of haddock
for the rest of her life.

958
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,386
I don't know what I was expecting.

959
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:56,511
I mean, I didn't realize...

960
01:17:56,844 --> 01:17:58,042
...everybody's close.

961
01:17:59,219 --> 01:18:01,969
Theresa, this came as
a big surprise to me...

962
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,886
...but apparently it is the poodle
that is the number one dog.

963
01:18:06,511 --> 01:18:08,636
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

964
01:18:09,094 --> 01:18:11,553
- Hi, Lina.
- Hi, Jason.

965
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:16,001
Jason is taking Garret
into town sailing now.

966
01:18:16,261 --> 01:18:17,209
Really? So soon?

967
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:19,345
If he doesn't get lost first.

968
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:21,553
I know there's a lake
around here somewhere.

969
01:18:21,803 --> 01:18:22,918
He senses that.

970
01:18:23,178 --> 01:18:26,095
Sensitive. If you
get into any trouble at all...

971
01:18:26,345 --> 01:18:29,293
...certainly give me...
the paper... a call.

972
01:18:30,887 --> 01:18:33,012
- You want to steer?
- Sure.

973
01:18:33,262 --> 01:18:34,543
You're the captain.

974
01:18:35,054 --> 01:18:37,627
You got to keep us going straight.

975
01:18:38,054 --> 01:18:39,543
Straight ahead.

976
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:51,158
Here you go.

977
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,867
- How you doing?
- Good.

978
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:57,784
The gang.
Hi, Lenny.

979
01:18:58,325 --> 01:19:00,065
- Bye, Mom.
- Have fun.

980
01:19:01,242 --> 01:19:02,982
- Say bye to your mom.
- See you!

981
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:35,983
I'm not used to having you here.

982
01:19:39,619 --> 01:19:41,660
It's okay, Garret.

983
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,702
It's nice...

984
01:19:46,702 --> 01:19:48,827
...being among your things.

985
01:19:51,744 --> 01:19:53,786
Well, is it what you expected?

986
01:19:56,369 --> 01:19:57,828
It's comforting.

987
01:20:18,578 --> 01:20:21,203
You're making me self-conscious.

988
01:20:23,162 --> 01:20:24,818
What are you looking at?

989
01:20:25,662 --> 01:20:27,485
Theresa in her home.

990
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,079
The regular everyday...

991
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:36,246
...Theresa.

992
01:20:53,788 --> 01:20:54,986
Wait.

993
01:20:56,663 --> 01:20:57,996
I really...

994
01:20:58,246 --> 01:21:00,403
...wanted to make this right.

995
01:21:01,788 --> 01:21:05,622
I just wanted to straighten up
my room and light a candle and...

996
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:10,570
And I need to take a shower.

997
01:21:18,372 --> 01:21:19,955
Garret, wait.

998
01:23:02,542 --> 01:23:05,574
One, two, three...

999
01:23:05,834 --> 01:23:08,709
...four, five, six.

1000
01:23:10,959 --> 01:23:12,543
- That was a goodie.
- So scared.

1001
01:23:12,793 --> 01:23:14,376
I'm so scared.

1002
01:23:14,626 --> 01:23:16,210
That was big.

1003
01:23:18,751 --> 01:23:22,116
I'm going to take a shower. Finally.

1004
01:23:25,335 --> 01:23:26,835
Wait. Just...

1005
01:25:15,131 --> 01:25:17,204
You're not going to believe what...

1006
01:25:22,922 --> 01:25:25,079
Oh, God. Garret.

1007
01:25:25,423 --> 01:25:27,298
Where did you get this?

1008
01:25:31,339 --> 01:25:32,423
I found it.

1009
01:25:32,673 --> 01:25:34,465
What do you mean, you found it?

1010
01:25:34,715 --> 01:25:36,538
I found it on the shore.

1011
01:25:38,006 --> 01:25:39,423
Garret, wait.

1012
01:25:40,173 --> 01:25:42,131
It came to me.

1013
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:44,298
You have to trust me.

1014
01:25:44,757 --> 01:25:45,621
Trust you?

1015
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:50,288
I just had to meet the person
that wrote it. I had to meet you.

1016
01:25:50,632 --> 01:25:53,007
- I was going to tell you before.
- How could you find me?

1017
01:25:53,257 --> 01:25:57,799
Because I tracked all of the messages
and there were clues...

1018
01:25:58,299 --> 01:26:00,174
All of the messages?

1019
01:26:02,424 --> 01:26:05,539
They've all been found and people
saw it in the column and they wrote.

1020
01:26:05,799 --> 01:26:08,372
I swear to God, I was
going to tell you, Garret.

1021
01:26:08,632 --> 01:26:09,580
Garret, wait.

1022
01:26:09,841 --> 01:26:11,341
I got to get out of here.

1023
01:26:16,591 --> 01:26:17,622
Garret, wait!

1024
01:26:17,883 --> 01:26:19,622
Why did you do this?

1025
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,800
Why?!

1026
01:26:23,883 --> 01:26:25,675
Were you curious?

1027
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,883
- It's goddamn research!
- No, I'm falling in love with you!

1028
01:26:30,133 --> 01:26:32,883
First in the letters
and then when I met you!

1029
01:26:33,133 --> 01:26:35,123
And I'm sorry! I was afraid!

1030
01:26:35,383 --> 01:26:38,175
I was afraid if I told you
that I would push you away!

1031
01:26:38,425 --> 01:26:40,081
Just like I'm doing now.

1032
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:42,800
Wait!

1033
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:44,384
No matter what you think of me...

1034
01:26:44,634 --> 01:26:46,373
...and no matter what happens now,
I want you to know...

1035
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:47,967
...how much I care for you.

1036
01:26:48,759 --> 01:26:50,582
And it shouldn't matter...

1037
01:26:50,842 --> 01:26:53,332
...what brought us together, Garret.

1038
01:26:53,801 --> 01:26:56,592
I sent those letters into the sea
to her. Not to you!

1039
01:26:57,051 --> 01:26:58,551
Not to all your friends at work!

1040
01:26:58,801 --> 01:26:59,801
I know.

1041
01:27:00,051 --> 01:27:02,009
They all knew about me, didn't they?

1042
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:04,259
All about Catherine?

1043
01:27:04,509 --> 01:27:08,124
My life was changed
by those three letters.

1044
01:27:08,385 --> 01:27:10,458
- I didn't want it printed in the paper.
- Two letters.

1045
01:27:10,718 --> 01:27:13,635
- You've got to believe me.
- I sent two letters to Catherine.

1046
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,052
What?

1047
01:27:17,677 --> 01:27:20,510
I have all of the letters.
I have all three.

1048
01:27:23,218 --> 01:27:24,802
Where's the third letter?

1049
01:27:26,385 --> 01:27:28,094
Is it in that drawer?

1050
01:27:37,094 --> 01:27:38,427
Catherine?

1051
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:06,585
To all the ships at sea...

1052
01:28:06,887 --> 01:28:09,012
...and all the ports of call.

1053
01:28:09,262 --> 01:28:10,637
To my family...

1054
01:28:10,887 --> 01:28:13,179
...and to all friends and strangers.

1055
01:28:13,845 --> 01:28:16,929
This is a message and a prayer.

1056
01:28:17,637 --> 01:28:21,335
The message is that my travels
taught me a great truth.

1057
01:28:23,137 --> 01:28:25,679
I already had what everyone
is searching for...

1058
01:28:25,929 --> 01:28:27,669
...and few ever find:

1059
01:28:28,346 --> 01:28:30,221
The one person in the world...

1060
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:33,044
...who I was born to love forever.

1061
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:37,461
A person like me, of the Outer Banks...

1062
01:28:37,721 --> 01:28:39,961
...and the blue Atlantic mystery.

1063
01:28:42,221 --> 01:28:44,888
A person rich in simple treasures...

1064
01:28:45,138 --> 01:28:48,138
...self-made, self-taught.

1065
01:28:49,888 --> 01:28:52,638
A harbor where I am forever home.

1066
01:28:52,888 --> 01:28:55,722
And no wind or trouble...

1067
01:28:56,180 --> 01:29:00,180
...or even a little death
can knock down this house.

1068
01:29:02,805 --> 01:29:07,931
The prayer is that everyone in the
world can know this kind of love...

1069
01:29:08,139 --> 01:29:10,295
...and be healed by it.

1070
01:29:10,681 --> 01:29:15,504
If my prayer is heard, then there
will be an erasing of all guilt...

1071
01:29:15,764 --> 01:29:17,806
...and all regret...

1072
01:29:18,098 --> 01:29:20,806
...and an end to all anger.

1073
01:29:21,723 --> 01:29:23,223
Please, God.

1074
01:29:24,181 --> 01:29:25,462
Amen.

1075
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,848
I never knew what she wrote.

1076
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:43,015
She...

1077
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:45,796
...never came back from that day.

1078
01:29:48,682 --> 01:29:51,682
I dried her.
I tried to keep her warm.

1079
01:29:52,682 --> 01:29:54,672
Took her to the hospital.

1080
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:57,349
She never...

1081
01:30:01,849 --> 01:30:04,391
She died three days later.

1082
01:30:07,016 --> 01:30:09,589
I keep thinking if she hadn't
gone out that day...

1083
01:30:09,849 --> 01:30:11,433
Garret, she knew.

1084
01:30:14,766 --> 01:30:16,350
She said it.

1085
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,516
"Not even a little death can
knock down this house. " She knew.

1086
01:30:27,517 --> 01:30:29,017
I want to...

1087
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:30,892
...keep this.

1088
01:31:41,936 --> 01:31:44,936
I'm sorry.
Would you rather be alone?

1089
01:31:51,686 --> 01:31:53,270
Has he called?

1090
01:31:56,437 --> 01:31:58,395
I left him a message, though.

1091
01:32:00,478 --> 01:32:02,301
I said I was sorry.

1092
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,510
And I asked him to call.

1093
01:32:07,104 --> 01:32:08,979
Well, then, he will.

1094
01:32:11,895 --> 01:32:13,718
Lina, do you remember...

1095
01:32:14,646 --> 01:32:17,187
...what I was always complaining about?

1096
01:32:18,021 --> 01:32:20,510
All those times you let me cry
on your shoulder about David.

1097
01:32:20,771 --> 01:32:22,021
Remember?

1098
01:32:23,229 --> 01:32:25,802
Honesty. Trust.

1099
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:32,354
I was so scared.

1100
01:32:34,021 --> 01:32:35,271
I don't...

1101
01:32:36,355 --> 01:32:39,271
I was falling in love
with Garret and I...

1102
01:32:40,896 --> 01:32:42,605
Half of my mind was saying,
"Tell him"...

1103
01:32:42,855 --> 01:32:44,897
...and the other half was saying...

1104
01:32:47,272 --> 01:32:50,147
..."Just wait. He's not
going to understand.

1105
01:32:50,522 --> 01:32:51,636
Wait till the right moment.

1106
01:32:51,897 --> 01:32:54,605
Just wait till you have the
right words. " You know?

1107
01:32:55,772 --> 01:32:58,147
And I blew it. I just...

1108
01:32:58,397 --> 01:33:01,106
...killed it by being what I hate:

1109
01:33:01,356 --> 01:33:02,356
A liar.

1110
01:33:02,606 --> 01:33:04,189
You're not a liar.

1111
01:33:05,314 --> 01:33:07,220
But to him I am.

1112
01:33:09,231 --> 01:33:12,345
And I don't think he's ever
going to be able to trust me now.

1113
01:33:12,856 --> 01:33:15,429
Don't you understand we all
have our own little lies...

1114
01:33:15,689 --> 01:33:18,398
...and our little unspoken truths?

1115
01:33:18,648 --> 01:33:22,596
And you just have to have a little
faith that he'll understand that.

1116
01:33:24,773 --> 01:33:26,273
I don't know.

1117
01:33:28,356 --> 01:33:30,346
I don't know if he can.

1118
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:37,690
I saw his pain. He was holding her
letter and he was reading it.

1119
01:33:37,982 --> 01:33:39,774
And there was just...

1120
01:33:41,482 --> 01:33:43,857
...so much pain and...

1121
01:33:44,857 --> 01:33:47,649
He has so much love for her,
you know?

1122
01:33:50,649 --> 01:33:51,930
I don't know.

1123
01:35:24,569 --> 01:35:28,434
You said if I was ever thinking about
writing a piece for the paper...

1124
01:35:29,819 --> 01:35:30,767
No kidding.

1125
01:35:33,986 --> 01:35:35,486
Is he in here?

1126
01:35:35,944 --> 01:35:37,028
No.

1127
01:35:37,903 --> 01:35:39,319
Other stories.

1128
01:35:39,570 --> 01:35:41,070
Good stories.

1129
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:43,268
It's about time.

1130
01:35:45,528 --> 01:35:47,851
People get hurt, they shut down.

1131
01:35:48,570 --> 01:35:50,393
Till the pain goes away?

1132
01:35:51,737 --> 01:35:53,018
I don't know.

1133
01:35:53,737 --> 01:35:57,737
Maybe you just learn to take it in
like everything else.

1134
01:35:59,112 --> 01:36:02,112
Kind of like a few pieces of cork
in a great glass of wine.

1135
01:36:02,362 --> 01:36:04,102
You don't want to miss the wine.

1136
01:36:05,362 --> 01:36:07,435
Is that in here?

1137
01:36:07,696 --> 01:36:09,821
The cork in the wine thing?

1138
01:36:10,821 --> 01:36:11,654
No.

1139
01:36:11,904 --> 01:36:14,029
Good. I hate it.

1140
01:36:20,571 --> 01:36:24,154
It may be that most of us
write our own life story...

1141
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:26,477
...making it up as we go along.

1142
01:36:27,405 --> 01:36:31,571
But others seem to have lives
that are already shaped and planned...

1143
01:36:32,196 --> 01:36:33,905
...inescapable...

1144
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:36,603
...perfect as a circle.

1145
01:38:41,284 --> 01:38:42,618
Open it.

1146
01:38:43,868 --> 01:38:45,284
Slowly.

1147
01:38:50,618 --> 01:38:52,608
- This is exciting.
- It is.

1148
01:38:58,743 --> 01:39:00,483
Front page of the section!
Great!

1149
01:39:01,410 --> 01:39:02,327
Thanks, bud.

1150
01:39:02,577 --> 01:39:03,775
Can I cut it out?

1151
01:39:04,285 --> 01:39:05,233
Sure.

1152
01:39:07,035 --> 01:39:09,025
- Is this okay?
- That is great.

1153
01:39:09,285 --> 01:39:11,327
That's perfect. Thank you.

1154
01:39:18,994 --> 01:39:20,077
Here's your mail, ma'am.

1155
01:39:20,327 --> 01:39:21,161
Thank you.

1156
01:39:21,411 --> 01:39:22,327
Sure.

1157
01:39:54,787 --> 01:39:56,329
Nice.

1158
01:39:56,954 --> 01:39:58,995
I love what you've done here.

1159
01:39:59,995 --> 01:40:02,068
- Very minimalist.
- Very nice of you to stop by, sir.

1160
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:06,537
Yes, well, I come bearing a gift
for your new phone booth office.

1161
01:40:06,787 --> 01:40:08,444
- Can I hang it?
- That is so sweet.

1162
01:40:08,704 --> 01:40:10,204
I know.

1163
01:40:17,288 --> 01:40:19,246
You'll never guess who it is.

1164
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:25,746
You seem happy.

1165
01:40:25,996 --> 01:40:28,038
Is anything all right?

1166
01:40:31,955 --> 01:40:33,413
Ahab.

1167
01:40:35,038 --> 01:40:36,153
May I?

1168
01:40:40,372 --> 01:40:43,487
If you decide to go do something
wild and ridiculous...

1169
01:40:43,747 --> 01:40:45,539
...it'll only prove one thing.

1170
01:40:45,789 --> 01:40:47,414
And what's that?

1171
01:40:49,372 --> 01:40:52,570
He's one lucky old son of the sea.

1172
01:40:58,206 --> 01:41:00,529
That's a Charlie Toschi quote.

1173
01:41:17,207 --> 01:41:20,873
You know, somebody's going to think
you're drying your skivvies up there.

1174
01:41:25,124 --> 01:41:26,582
You look nice.

1175
01:41:26,832 --> 01:41:28,822
Yeah, well, it hurts.

1176
01:41:57,208 --> 01:41:59,250
She's beautiful, Garret.

1177
01:42:00,458 --> 01:42:01,875
Thanks, Marta.

1178
01:42:03,875 --> 01:42:05,417
Go get them!

1179
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:12,406
Nice job, Garret.

1180
01:42:41,376 --> 01:42:42,835
To Catherine.

1181
01:42:43,085 --> 01:42:44,251
To Catherine.

1182
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:46,543
Wish to God...

1183
01:42:50,585 --> 01:42:52,575
Wish to God she was here today.

1184
01:42:58,043 --> 01:42:59,544
Every day.

1185
01:44:42,714 --> 01:44:44,922
My dad said you were there.

1186
01:44:45,339 --> 01:44:46,839
Wish I'd have known.

1187
01:44:48,214 --> 01:44:50,704
A surprise. Dumb idea.

1188
01:44:50,964 --> 01:44:52,298
No, it's...

1189
01:44:53,214 --> 01:44:54,871
It's great to see you.

1190
01:44:57,381 --> 01:44:59,590
- Glad you came.
- Me too.

1191
01:45:00,715 --> 01:45:03,423
I saw the boat. It's beautiful.

1192
01:45:03,673 --> 01:45:05,048
It's great.

1193
01:45:06,006 --> 01:45:07,663
I'm happy for you.

1194
01:45:08,381 --> 01:45:10,257
You want to come inside?

1195
01:45:31,382 --> 01:45:32,841
I'm sorry.

1196
01:45:34,382 --> 01:45:36,507
What I said must've hurt you.

1197
01:45:41,549 --> 01:45:44,466
I just heard what
you couldn't tell me.

1198
01:45:46,425 --> 01:45:48,633
Or maybe what I couldn't hear.

1199
01:45:49,050 --> 01:45:51,206
And I understand now.

1200
01:45:52,383 --> 01:45:54,925
I think it's so beautiful
the way you love her.

1201
01:45:55,175 --> 01:45:57,248
No, you don't have to say anything.

1202
01:45:57,842 --> 01:46:00,550
It's what made me want to find you.

1203
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:07,300
Then stay with me.

1204
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:08,748
Come inside.

1205
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:10,842
Just stay as long as you want.

1206
01:46:11,092 --> 01:46:14,790
I thought about it. I thought about
a lot of things sitting out here.

1207
01:46:15,842 --> 01:46:17,009
And I can't stay.

1208
01:46:17,342 --> 01:46:18,426
Why?

1209
01:46:18,676 --> 01:46:20,415
Because if you can,
you'll come to me...

1210
01:46:20,676 --> 01:46:24,343
...when it's right.
And if it's not right, it's okay.

1211
01:46:25,468 --> 01:46:27,124
Because I wouldn't...

1212
01:46:27,759 --> 01:46:29,551
...regret one minute.

1213
01:46:30,926 --> 01:46:31,926
Not one.

1214
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:36,510
Bye.

1215
01:46:46,593 --> 01:46:48,583
I don't want to lose you.

1216
01:46:51,719 --> 01:46:53,094
Then don't.

1217
01:47:10,844 --> 01:47:13,678
Why do you always sit
in the same place?

1218
01:47:13,928 --> 01:47:15,469
What the hell you care where I sit?

1219
01:47:15,719 --> 01:47:19,470
I'm curious. You started
sitting here 10, 11 years ago.

1220
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:20,751
For chrissake!

1221
01:47:21,011 --> 01:47:22,886
You used to sit over there.

1222
01:47:39,637 --> 01:47:41,710
Get the boy a cup of coffee.

1223
01:47:48,554 --> 01:47:50,137
You look like hell.

1224
01:47:52,554 --> 01:47:53,887
I'm okay.

1225
01:47:54,887 --> 01:47:56,596
Catch up to her?

1226
01:48:01,304 --> 01:48:02,554
You let her go.

1227
01:48:03,929 --> 01:48:05,513
I don't want to talk about it.

1228
01:48:05,763 --> 01:48:07,138
- Listen, I was...
- Go away.

1229
01:48:14,555 --> 01:48:16,263
She made up her mind.

1230
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:18,753
- The hell you want?
- Persistence.

1231
01:48:19,013 --> 01:48:21,847
Get crazy. Go nuts.
A fight, for chrissake.

1232
01:48:22,138 --> 01:48:23,847
You spent one afternoon with her.

1233
01:48:25,097 --> 01:48:27,253
You don't even know who she is.

1234
01:48:29,555 --> 01:48:30,389
What's...?

1235
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:32,139
Chicago.

1236
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:34,764
Three minutes. Get on the phone.

1237
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,597
It's your last chance.

1238
01:48:51,014 --> 01:48:52,890
Of course she walked away.

1239
01:48:53,223 --> 01:48:54,681
She ain't stupid.

1240
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:58,140
Think she wants to try
to come between you and...

1241
01:48:58,390 --> 01:49:00,879
- I don't have it all figured out.
- Who the hell does?

1242
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:04,223
Think it's easy for me to see
another woman in your house?

1243
01:49:04,473 --> 01:49:05,973
Well, it ain't easy.

1244
01:49:06,557 --> 01:49:08,296
I'll tell you one thing...

1245
01:49:08,598 --> 01:49:10,807
...I'd give a million bucks
to see you grab her...

1246
01:49:11,057 --> 01:49:12,557
...and figure it out as you go along.

1247
01:49:12,807 --> 01:49:13,640
Just drop it!

1248
01:49:13,849 --> 01:49:15,182
- Drop it?
- Yeah. Drop it!

1249
01:49:15,432 --> 01:49:16,599
Just...

1250
01:49:19,932 --> 01:49:21,307
...forget about it.

1251
01:49:22,182 --> 01:49:23,214
I can't!

1252
01:49:28,099 --> 01:49:29,474
I can't forget about it.

1253
01:49:30,849 --> 01:49:32,349
Why the hell not?

1254
01:49:33,558 --> 01:49:35,547
Because you're my boy.

1255
01:49:38,224 --> 01:49:40,183
- It's not your business.
- What?

1256
01:49:40,433 --> 01:49:43,183
I said it's not your business!

1257
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:45,558
Turn around.

1258
01:49:47,016 --> 01:49:48,558
Turn around.

1259
01:49:49,975 --> 01:49:51,600
Make a fist.

1260
01:49:51,850 --> 01:49:53,308
Make it!

1261
01:49:53,975 --> 01:49:55,475
Now you hit me!

1262
01:49:55,725 --> 01:49:58,215
Hit me in the face,
you son of a bitch.

1263
01:50:01,392 --> 01:50:02,809
Not my business?

1264
01:50:03,059 --> 01:50:05,382
My son is not my business?

1265
01:50:06,267 --> 01:50:08,257
What the hell else have I got...

1266
01:50:10,017 --> 01:50:11,559
...that's close to me?

1267
01:50:12,559 --> 01:50:14,059
Who else ever...

1268
01:50:15,226 --> 01:50:16,851
...stuck up for me?

1269
01:50:17,101 --> 01:50:18,976
Think I don't know your pain?
I do.

1270
01:50:19,893 --> 01:50:23,424
Some of it I put there.
Think I can forget that?

1271
01:50:25,851 --> 01:50:28,310
When she went to New York,
you could've gone with her...

1272
01:50:28,518 --> 01:50:31,143
...and here I was, sick,
drunk, flat on my ass...

1273
01:50:31,393 --> 01:50:33,049
...bringing you down.

1274
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:37,925
Maybe the two of you,
it could've been different somehow.

1275
01:50:41,685 --> 01:50:43,727
I didn't stay for you.

1276
01:50:45,310 --> 01:50:46,685
This is who I am.

1277
01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:49,602
This place.
This is where I belong.

1278
01:50:50,644 --> 01:50:53,477
She came back because she found out
she belonged here too.

1279
01:50:53,727 --> 01:50:55,967
She chose for herself.

1280
01:50:58,477 --> 01:51:00,550
God, I loved her for that.

1281
01:51:02,686 --> 01:51:04,394
So did I.

1282
01:51:06,228 --> 01:51:08,717
Now you choose. Choose...

1283
01:51:08,978 --> 01:51:12,561
...between yesterday and tomorrow.
Pick one.

1284
01:51:13,686 --> 01:51:15,061
Stick with it.

1285
01:51:15,686 --> 01:51:17,426
And I will shut up...

1286
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:19,895
...and leave you alone.

1287
01:51:52,563 --> 01:51:55,563
"So you'll always know where you are...

1288
01:51:55,938 --> 01:51:57,844
...and where home is.

1289
01:52:00,021 --> 01:52:01,730
Love, Theresa. "

1290
01:53:03,065 --> 01:53:05,221
You heading for blue water?

1291
01:53:06,232 --> 01:53:07,315
Yes, sir.

1292
01:53:08,732 --> 01:53:10,857
Well, you know what you're doing.

1293
01:53:12,065 --> 01:53:14,305
Got it all figured out.

1294
01:54:23,110 --> 01:54:24,026
Hey, bud.

1295
01:54:24,943 --> 01:54:26,141
Time to get up.

1296
01:54:28,902 --> 01:54:30,443
Another day.

1297
01:58:26,493 --> 01:58:29,691
They call him the Mayor of 43rd.

1298
01:58:29,952 --> 01:58:33,650
He's so sweet. He knows everyone.
Helps people.

1299
01:58:34,244 --> 01:58:37,327
The point is, it's his
70th birthday.

1300
01:58:38,285 --> 01:58:41,161
Theresa, there's a phone call
for you.

1301
01:58:41,411 --> 01:58:42,608
Can you take a message?

1302
01:58:42,911 --> 01:58:44,077
It's urgent.

1303
01:58:46,452 --> 01:58:47,827
Excuse me.

1304
01:58:48,077 --> 01:58:49,734
You better take it in my office.

1305
01:58:49,994 --> 01:58:51,494
Is it Jase?

1306
01:58:57,286 --> 01:58:58,619
Hey, girl.

1307
01:59:01,453 --> 01:59:03,109
I better...

1308
01:59:04,120 --> 01:59:07,984
...get this said
while I can still talk.

1309
01:59:09,078 --> 01:59:12,776
There was a boat, Theresa,
offshore in trouble.

1310
01:59:13,078 --> 01:59:14,870
A family, there was three of them.

1311
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:16,745
Garret tried...

1312
01:59:17,870 --> 01:59:20,579
Well, he tried to help, and...

1313
01:59:22,245 --> 01:59:25,037
It's bad. He went down.

1314
01:59:27,121 --> 01:59:28,454
What do you mean?

1315
01:59:28,746 --> 01:59:30,121
He went in after them.

1316
01:59:30,371 --> 01:59:34,121
He got two of them.
But he went down, Theresa.

1317
01:59:35,329 --> 01:59:37,235
I am so sorry.

1318
01:59:40,121 --> 01:59:42,079
That's all I got now.

1319
01:59:43,954 --> 01:59:45,288
Bye.

1320
01:59:50,663 --> 01:59:52,455
Oh, my God.

1321
02:01:57,834 --> 02:01:59,459
Hard times.

1322
02:01:59,834 --> 02:02:01,334
Come on in.

1323
02:02:09,418 --> 02:02:11,158
I found it on the boat.

1324
02:02:11,835 --> 02:02:13,491
It was in his slicker.

1325
02:02:37,419 --> 02:02:38,961
Dear Catherine:

1326
02:02:39,502 --> 02:02:41,294
My life began when I found you...

1327
02:02:41,544 --> 02:02:44,575
...and I thought it had ended
when I failed to save you.

1328
02:02:45,044 --> 02:02:49,294
I thought that hanging on to your
memory was keeping us both alive.

1329
02:02:49,544 --> 02:02:50,919
But I was wrong.

1330
02:02:51,336 --> 02:02:53,211
A woman named Theresa
showed me that...

1331
02:02:53,461 --> 02:02:55,868
...if I was brave enough to
open my heart...

1332
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:59,326
...I could love again,
no matter how terrible my grief.

1333
02:02:59,670 --> 02:03:02,753
She made me realize
I was only half-alive.

1334
02:03:03,003 --> 02:03:05,212
It scared me and it hurt.

1335
02:03:05,462 --> 02:03:10,170
I didn't know how much I needed her
till the night she flew away.

1336
02:03:11,504 --> 02:03:15,587
When that airplane took off, I felt
something inside me tear away.

1337
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:17,087
And I knew.

1338
02:03:17,337 --> 02:03:18,837
I should have stopped her.

1339
02:03:19,087 --> 02:03:21,160
I should've follo wed her home.

1340
02:03:21,671 --> 02:03:24,337
And now tomorrow, I'm going to sail
to the windy point...

1341
02:03:24,629 --> 02:03:26,952
...and I'm going to say goodbye to you.

1342
02:03:28,004 --> 02:03:29,963
Then I'm going to go to this woman...

1343
02:03:30,213 --> 02:03:32,619
...and see if I can win her heart.

1344
02:04:44,007 --> 02:04:45,996
If I can, I know you'll bless me.

1345
02:04:46,257 --> 02:04:47,757
And bless us all.

1346
02:04:48,590 --> 02:04:49,705
If I can't...

1347
02:04:49,965 --> 02:04:52,715
...then I'm still blessed because
I've had the privilege of loving...

1348
02:04:52,965 --> 02:04:54,674
...twice in my life.

1349
02:04:55,132 --> 02:04:56,507
She gave me that.

1350
02:04:56,757 --> 02:05:00,257
And if I tell you I love her
as much as I loved you...

1351
02:05:00,549 --> 02:05:02,622
...then you'll know the whole story.

1352
02:05:04,799 --> 02:05:06,872
Rest in peace, my love.

1353
02:05:07,133 --> 02:05:08,164
Garret.

1354
02:05:37,134 --> 02:05:40,134
If some lives form a perfect circle...

1355
02:05:40,842 --> 02:05:45,967
...others take shape in ways we cannot
predict or always understand.

1356
02:05:46,967 --> 02:05:49,926
Loss has been a part of myjourney.

1357
02:05:50,343 --> 02:05:53,676
But it has also shown me
what is precious.

1358
02:05:54,301 --> 02:05:58,676
So has a love for which
I can only be grateful.
