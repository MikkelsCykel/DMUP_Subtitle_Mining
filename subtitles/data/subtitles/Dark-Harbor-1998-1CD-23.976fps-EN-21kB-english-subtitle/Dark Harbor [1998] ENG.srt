1
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,405
Do you think
we're going to make it?

2
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,234
I certainly hope so.

3
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,918
Well, don't get carried away.

4
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:42,831
I' m not getting carried away,
l' m just trying...

5
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:44,911
Make sure we live first.

6
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:48,175
I don't think doing 65 on Route
One make us Bonnie and Clyde.

7
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:51,151
We'd hold up Fort Knox,
and we wouldn't be.

8
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:53,039
Just keep your eyes peeled.
Okay?

9
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:58,352
I mean it,
I need some help here.

10
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:01,168
This is like hydroplaning
through the goddamn Bayou!

11
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:04,016
Don't blame me because
you were 2 hours late.

12
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:20,173
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing, just watch the road.

13
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:27,056
-Slow down.
-What is it?

14
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,370
-Stop.
-What do you mean, stop?

15
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,963
-We' ll miss the boat.
-No, really, I saw something.

16
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:38,094
-Saw something? What?
-David, stop!

17
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,298
Jesus. Is he alive?

18
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:50,131
-No!
-What?

19
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:53,971
Don't touch him. We should call
the police and not get involved.

20
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:57,588
-lnvolved? He needs help.
-So, we' re calling the police.

21
00:02:57,588 --> 00:02:59,668
-But shouldn't we...
-No, trust me.

22
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:00,596
No.

23
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:03,312
No cops.

24
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,149
Do you know where you are?

25
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,630
-Sort of.
-What happened to you?

26
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:17,909
Can you move?

27
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:20,790
-l' m calling the police.
-I said no cops.

28
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,189
-We've got a boat to catch.
-David.

29
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:25,077
Alexis, please,
let me handle this.

30
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,438
We can't help you if you
don't let me call the police.

31
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:30,350
Then don't help me.

32
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:42,838
Would you like a cigarette?

33
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:45,711
Please.

34
00:03:56,312 --> 00:03:59,064
There's nothing in Lincolnville
but some payphones...

35
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:00,631
...and the ferry...

36
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:03,385
...and Pen Bay hospital
is only a few miles from here.

37
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:06,360
Why don't I just swing by.
I recommend you get looked at.

38
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,637
No, that's okay.

39
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:10,680
No doctors either?

40
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:13,593
Next thing,
it' ll be no lawyers...

41
00:04:13,593 --> 00:04:15,513
...and we' ll all
be out of business.

42
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:18,361
-Time's your boat leaving?
-28 minutes.

43
00:04:19,354 --> 00:04:21,077
How far is it?

44
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:24,154
About thirty miles.

45
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:26,041
Cutting it kind
of loose, huh?

46
00:04:26,874 --> 00:04:31,631
We wouldn't want to set off
any radar guns now, would we?

47
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:36,787
Maybe you should
pick it up a bit, dear.

48
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:53,175
Sorry.

49
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:58,619
It's not your fault.

50
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:01,815
So long.

51
00:05:04,573 --> 00:05:07,256
-Thanks for the lift.
-Are you sure you' re okay?

52
00:05:07,453 --> 00:05:09,213
Yeah, l' ll survive.

53
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:11,132
Okay then, bye, now.

54
00:05:11,132 --> 00:05:12,060
Wait.

55
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:15,900
He said he' ll survive.

56
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:20,635
-Naw, really.
-Please, take it.

57
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:25,501
-Be careful.
-Thanks.

58
00:05:29,374 --> 00:05:30,453
See you around.

59
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,438
I suggest you scrub
that hand with ammonia...

60
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,933
...as soon as possible.

61
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,856
Why, you wanna hold it?

62
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,311
Jesus!

63
00:05:57,152 --> 00:06:00,032
Who taught you to be such
a snob? I think it's sweet.

64
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:02,071
Yeah, so are circus dwarves.

65
00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:11,552
I' ll try and rustle up something
edible. Any requests?

66
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:14,782
I think I saw a Beluga and Dom
twin-pack in the coke machine.

67
00:06:15,393 --> 00:06:17,432
-What do you want?
-Surprise me.

68
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,051
Oh, God, you scared me.

69
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:47,939
-Sorry.
-Any luck?

70
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:50,819
Wow!

71
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:56,412
Remember when the ceiling
collapsed in Mustique?

72
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:58,052
How could I ever forget?

73
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:00,418
We had to sleep out
in that gazebo.

74
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:05,733
I remember, it's that goddamn
scorpion going for my jugular.

75
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:08,122
It was a grasshopper,
and it grazed your foot.

76
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:54,334
Lexie, what the hell are you
doing? I was watching that.

77
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:26,757
Two shots and you
turn into Mae West.

78
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:46,050
What's wrong?

79
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:49,771
Christ, we forgot
about the food.

80
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:51,659
-What food?
-On the dock.

81
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:54,668
You can't ring Mike
and Mary at this hour.

82
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,332
I' m not gonna let

83
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:58,219
...worth of salmon
sit out all night.

84
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:06,092
Mike? I wanted to let you know
we missed the last boat.

85
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:07,852
If it's not too much trouble...

86
00:09:07,852 --> 00:09:10,700
...could you buzz over
and grab the groceries?

87
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,654
Great, so it works out
either way.

88
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:18,573
Thanks. Go back to sleep.

89
00:09:18,573 --> 00:09:19,980
Good night.

90
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,381
They never made the drop.

91
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:26,763
-What are you doing?
-Going to sleep.

92
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:30,062
-With your coat on?
-Yep.

93
00:09:30,414 --> 00:09:31,974
Good night.

94
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:35,822
Okay.

95
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,037
Good night.

96
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,358
I wonder what happened
to that guy.

97
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:49,231
-What guy?
-From last night, on Route One.

98
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:52,111
Right, " Mr. No-Cops".
What about him?

99
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:54,032
Nothing.
I was just wondering.

100
00:09:54,032 --> 00:09:55,755
Wondering what?

101
00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:58,159
If he's alright, that's all.

102
00:10:10,673 --> 00:10:12,233
That's not funny.

103
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:14,192
I know, l' m sorry.

104
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:17,040
-But...
-But nothing, that hurts.

105
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:21,830
Right, I have retinal damage,
isn't that hilarious?

106
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:28,594
God. I better go get
myself a cup of coffee...

107
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,354
...before you have
an aneurysm.

108
00:10:30,354 --> 00:10:32,433
Boat coffee,
living on the edge.

109
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,321
Yeah, that's me, Wild Dave.

110
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:01,752
Did you remember
to bring the camera?

111
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:03,576
-I don't know, did l?
-I think so.

112
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:05,398
Yeah, you' re right, I did.

113
00:12:59,132 --> 00:13:01,019
Is this gonna be
a whole thing?

114
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:06,780
I' ll see you at the house.

115
00:13:07,772 --> 00:13:09,660
It's just a mushroom.

116
00:13:21,213 --> 00:13:24,094
Guess who I saw
on the ferry deck?

117
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,981
-Who?
-Jack Hoffman.

118
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:30,334
Busy at molesting some
teenage bimbo in daylight.

119
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:31,741
Surprise, surprise.

120
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:34,654
Poor Margo.

121
00:13:34,654 --> 00:13:36,541
Poor bimbo.

122
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,222
Would you be that open?

123
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:46,142
I don't know.

124
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:50,230
Wanna have supper
at the Blue Heron?

125
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:51,935
-Tonight?
-Yeah.

126
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:54,815
I thought it might be fun.
Maybe dance a bit.

127
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,131
Nah, let's just have
a quiet one.

128
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:01,056
Are you sure?

129
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:02,747
Yeah, I don't know,
l' m just not...

130
00:14:02,816 --> 00:14:04,377
You' re not what?

131
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:06,780
In the mood.

132
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,136
I see.

133
00:14:16,097 --> 00:14:18,268
Another quiet one.

134
00:14:23,137 --> 00:14:24,698
Well, what do you want,
then?

135
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:27,512
-For dinner?
-For dinner.

136
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:30,306
-How about lobster?
-Lobster's fine.

137
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:32,674
Lobster it is.
I' ll have Mike swing over.

138
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:34,113
No, l' ll go.

139
00:14:34,113 --> 00:14:36,961
-You sure?
-Yeah, I could use the ride.

140
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:49,955
Come on, baby, Wild Dave
is taking you for a ride.

141
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,355
-What in God's name?
-Just go with the flow.

142
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:53,475
Where to?

143
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,876
Where did you agree
to become Mrs. Weinberg?

144
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:58,916
-Are you serious?
-Next stop: Twin Bards.

145
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,371
-What about the lobsters?
-We don't need them.

146
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,443
David.

147
00:15:06,277 --> 00:15:08,164
Get in the boat...

148
00:15:08,837 --> 00:15:10,080
...my love.

149
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:31,774
Fuck.

150
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:34,981
What's wrong?

151
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:43,142
Take the tiller.

152
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:48,897
How does it look?

153
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:54,279
David, it's pretty tricky,
why don't we head back?

154
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,621
Give me the read.

155
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:58,536
O, eight-seven...

156
00:15:58,536 --> 00:16:01,417
...o, eight-nine...

157
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:02,344
...o...

158
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,256
...eight-six... it keeps moving.

159
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,573
Head up. Take her to a hundred
and hold your course.

160
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:13,000
Why don't we just head back.
We can beat it to Brackett.

161
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,302
Nonsense, where's
your sense of adventure?

162
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,753
-There they are!
-You've got the Twins?

163
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:22,437
Edge her four degrees
to port...

164
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:24,354
...and we' re dead-on.

165
00:16:35,114 --> 00:16:36,194
Steady.

166
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:39,722
Hold her right there.

167
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:46,443
I hope you know what you' re
doing; l' m not impressed.

168
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:47,905
Honey, have a little faith.

169
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:10,924
Lex?

170
00:17:13,836 --> 00:17:14,763
Yeah?

171
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:17,644
Are you okay?

172
00:17:19,117 --> 00:17:21,133
I' m fine. I was looking.

173
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:23,369
I didn't see anything coming.

174
00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:27,181
Don't worry.

175
00:17:28,653 --> 00:17:30,214
Get the flares.

176
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:32,458
Get the flares, right.

177
00:17:34,414 --> 00:17:36,173
We don't have any flares.

178
00:17:36,173 --> 00:17:38,254
-What?
-Fourth of July, remember?

179
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:41,134
-You didn't replace them?
-I didn't think...

180
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:44,134
Exactly, you didn't think.
Make sure we' re not sinking.

181
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,056
-Wait here, l' ll go check.
-Check what?

182
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:01,424
-We don't know where we are.
-We' re on land...

183
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:03,216
...unless that's a UFO.

184
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,703
-l' m coming with you.
-Stay here, watch the boat.

185
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,792
David!

186
00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:45,875
How was I supposed to know?
What's he doing, stalking us?

187
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,242
David, do you think so?

188
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:53,522
Thank God.

189
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,795
Glad to see
you guys are happy.

190
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:02,675
No, we' re not,
we' re just glad you' re right.

191
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,595
I didn't know it was you.

192
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:07,279
I just heard my wife scream.
It was instinct.

193
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:09,712
I've been seeing a lot
of instinct lately.

194
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:20,013
This oughta hold us
till it lifts.

195
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:21,653
When will that be?

196
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:23,573
You know what they say
about Maine...

197
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:25,963
...if you don't like
the weather, wait 5 minutes.

198
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:33,781
No, we' re fine, thank you.

199
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:38,101
Your wife looks hungry.

200
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,022
Thank you.

201
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:49,655
How did you end up out here,
If you don't mind me asking?

202
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,535
I couldn't find a spot
to settle last night...

203
00:19:52,535 --> 00:19:54,445
...so I ended up crashing
on the ferry...

204
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:57,336
...and before I knew it,
she was moving...

205
00:19:57,336 --> 00:20:00,183
...and when we landed I just
started roaming around...

206
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:01,656
...the town.

207
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:03,575
-Haroldsberg.
-Right.

208
00:20:03,575 --> 00:20:05,943
I ended up finding, well...

209
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,336
...sort of borrowed
a little boat.

210
00:20:09,336 --> 00:20:10,580
Borrowed?

211
00:20:11,737 --> 00:20:13,559
He really is a lawyer,
isn't he?

212
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:17,396
We get the Harvard
Law Review every month.

213
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:22,102
So anyway, l' m just...

214
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,153
...sort of zoning out a bit...

215
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:27,001
...when all of a sudden,
sun goes off like a light...

216
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,913
...then banged
into this place...

217
00:20:29,913 --> 00:20:32,281
...grouped up past
all these screaming seals.

218
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:34,714
That's when I heard:
" Hello, hello".

219
00:20:34,714 --> 00:20:36,602
-Seals?
-Yeah, tons.

220
00:20:36,794 --> 00:20:39,642
-My God, this must be...
-Seal Rock. No shit.

221
00:20:40,474 --> 00:20:43,419
Captain Compass, I ' m not
the one who veered off course.

222
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:45,394
I didn't exactly
have a radar, did l?

223
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:53,876
-You want one?
-She doesn't smoke those.

224
00:20:57,275 --> 00:20:59,031
So, what exactly is it...

225
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:01,912
...that you do, anyway?

226
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:08,272
What do you do
to support yourself?

227
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:11,613
Nothing much.

228
00:21:11,613 --> 00:21:14,012
Is that a full-time
occupation?

229
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:15,899
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

230
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:19,733
Let's see, no cops...

231
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:22,013
...no home, no job,
no name, no nothing.

232
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:24,094
You should run
for President in 2000.

233
00:21:24,094 --> 00:21:25,555
Country could start fresh.

234
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,341
That's it, further out!

235
00:21:32,254 --> 00:21:34,141
She is almost free.
Keep swinging.

236
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:47,582
You' re probably wondering
about the road last night.

237
00:21:48,414 --> 00:21:49,494
No, not really.

238
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:53,375
David was a
little curious, but l...

239
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,782
It's okay.

240
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,143
Let's just say...

241
00:21:59,135 --> 00:22:01,023
...sometimes people...

242
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:03,903
...sort of catch you
when you' re down...

243
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:06,783
...and try to take
advantage of you.

244
00:22:08,673 --> 00:22:11,356
Then when they find out
they can't...

245
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:14,880
...well, they make you pay.

246
00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:18,233
Honey?

247
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:22,081
-Yeah!
-Where is the sugar?

248
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:25,757
Where it always is.

249
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:28,702
Oh, right. Sorry!

250
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:30,913
You have a beautiful home,
Mr. Weinberg.

251
00:22:30,913 --> 00:22:31,840
Thanks.

252
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:34,561
It isn't mine exactly.

253
00:22:36,514 --> 00:22:38,882
My great grandfather
built it.

254
00:22:39,394 --> 00:22:41,282
-It's beautiful.
-Thank you.

255
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:46,083
Hot, hot, hot!

256
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,795
-Thank you.
-Thanks, hon.

257
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:51,039
You earned it.

258
00:22:57,572 --> 00:23:00,474
I want you guys to know
how much I appreciate this.

259
00:23:01,316 --> 00:23:03,876
It's been along time
since I've been inside.

260
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:05,796
-It's our pleasure.
-Warm shower...

261
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:07,203
...never hurt anyone.

262
00:23:12,996 --> 00:23:14,884
Another day, another day.

263
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,325
Let it die.

264
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:30,757
I' m beat.

265
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:32,645
How about you, honey,
you tired?

266
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:37,926
Yes, David, l' m tired.

267
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,522
You don't have to be.

268
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:45,639
I know, sweetheart, but I am.

269
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:47,527
I' m exhausted.

270
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,273
No! Let him sleep.

271
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,840
What do you mean,
let him sleep?

272
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,662
He's not supposed
to sleep over.

273
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:04,776
I know, but he fell asleep.

274
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,143
That's what sleeping over is,
falling asleep.

275
00:24:09,577 --> 00:24:12,457
Come on, you can't throw
him out. Where's he gonna go?

276
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:15,206
Please, he lives
on roadsides.

277
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:20,041
What would people say if they
knew who we had here?

278
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,817
The paranoid schizophrenic
standing in front of me?

279
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:26,922
I offer a quick shower, and
now we' re harboring a fugitive.

280
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:30,121
Fugitives who give you bread
after you smash their heads in.

281
00:24:30,121 --> 00:24:32,650
If you' re afraid,
why'd you drag him back here?

282
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,298
What, and leave him out
there after he helped us?

283
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:37,419
Exactly...

284
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:38,825
...helped us.

285
00:24:39,818 --> 00:24:42,218
Great, now l' m Mr. Bad Guy.

286
00:24:42,218 --> 00:24:44,939
You' re not Mr. Anything.
In fact, do what you want.

287
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:46,979
I' m going to bed. I' m tired.

288
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:18,896
You want me to go, right?

289
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:20,977
No, not at all,
I just couldn't sleep.

290
00:26:20,977 --> 00:26:22,864
I thought you might
need a blanket.

291
00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:25,736
Thanks.

292
00:26:28,657 --> 00:26:30,064
Wanna have a seat?

293
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:48,622
Can I ask you something?

294
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:49,746
Sure.

295
00:26:51,699 --> 00:26:53,586
Do I make you nervous?

296
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,401
No, not at all.

297
00:26:58,356 --> 00:27:00,079
Are you sure?

298
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:36,724
Put it out.

299
00:28:00,696 --> 00:28:03,543
-Who do you think you are?
-You know who I am.

300
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:21,785
What are you doing here?

301
00:28:22,138 --> 00:28:23,698
I never left.

302
00:28:24,697 --> 00:28:26,584
Take off my boots.

303
00:28:57,755 --> 00:28:59,163
You are up.

304
00:29:18,877 --> 00:29:20,284
Clever.

305
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:23,164
Good morning, gentlemen.

306
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:28,957
Sorry about dozing off
like that last night.

307
00:29:28,957 --> 00:29:30,877
Don't be silly.
How's your head?

308
00:29:30,877 --> 00:29:31,805
I' ll live.

309
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:35,198
Thanks for the blanket,
by the way.

310
00:29:35,198 --> 00:29:36,126
You' re welcome.

311
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:40,318
I thought you might be cold.

312
00:29:40,318 --> 00:29:42,398
I was. Thanks.

313
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:43,805
That was sweet, dear.

314
00:29:47,198 --> 00:29:49,020
-Are you hungry?
-Already ate.

315
00:29:50,014 --> 00:29:52,862
-Hope that's okay.
-Of course it is.

316
00:30:03,455 --> 00:30:05,343
Great, the phone's dead.

317
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:08,219
It's probably the storm.
Give it a few.

318
00:30:18,657 --> 00:30:20,698
-Sugar?
-Two spoons. Thanks.

319
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:27,424
Oh, my God!

320
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:36,960
David, it looks amazing.

321
00:30:49,955 --> 00:30:51,199
Not bad.

322
00:30:51,714 --> 00:30:53,315
Not bad at all.

323
00:30:53,315 --> 00:30:55,236
If you do say so yourself.

324
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:58,083
Well, a man
of hidden talents.

325
00:30:59,075 --> 00:31:02,818
-You did this?
-Just wanted to say thank you.

326
00:31:07,717 --> 00:31:09,636
Anyway,
after I weaseled out...

327
00:31:09,636 --> 00:31:12,516
...of the vodka-Santa Claus
Fiasco at Cheltenham...

328
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:14,437
...I show up at Yale thinking:

329
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:16,325
"Okay, time to crack down".

330
00:31:17,317 --> 00:31:20,997
But of course tragedy struck
me before I ever unpacked.

331
00:31:20,997 --> 00:31:23,269
I had the misfortune
of being struck down...

332
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:25,798
...by the most deadly
pair of wild blue eyes...

333
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:27,813
...God ever had
the audacity to create.

334
00:31:27,813 --> 00:31:31,078
-He was a junior from El Paso.
-A Texas boy at Yale.

335
00:31:31,078 --> 00:31:33,638
Yeah, with a bad habit
of stealing horses...

336
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:36,518
...at four in the morning,
and sneaking into my window...

337
00:31:36,518 --> 00:31:40,315
...with waffles and a bottle
of Wild Turkey. He was nuts.

338
00:31:43,174 --> 00:31:44,775
So whatever
happened to him?

339
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:47,492
My mother scared him off
and she married a Du Pont.

340
00:31:48,935 --> 00:31:50,695
What's a " Du Pont"?

341
00:31:50,695 --> 00:31:52,734
An obsolete tribe
from Delaware.

342
00:31:55,495 --> 00:31:58,496
What about you,
have you ever been in love?

343
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:01,863
Naw, not in any sense
of the word.

344
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:11,496
This was so good.

345
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:12,936
Glad you liked it.

346
00:32:12,936 --> 00:32:14,824
Now l' m set
for a good month.

347
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:18,177
A month's a long time.

348
00:32:18,697 --> 00:32:19,624
I know.

349
00:32:21,097 --> 00:32:23,658
So, are you two,
going across any time soon?

350
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:26,822
-Across?
-The water; to the ferry.

351
00:32:27,497 --> 00:32:29,993
I hope you don't think
you' re leaving, do you?

352
00:32:29,993 --> 00:32:31,138
Yeah, I thought l...

353
00:32:33,097 --> 00:32:35,072
I' m sorry,
you must not know the rule.

354
00:32:37,898 --> 00:32:39,786
You didn't tell him the rule?

355
00:32:41,257 --> 00:32:42,698
What rule?

356
00:32:42,698 --> 00:32:45,098
If you come to my house,
and do what you did...

357
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:47,722
...then you have to accept
the following challenge:

358
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:50,379
Delay your windy departure
until this evening...

359
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:54,155
...so that I may match
this formidable feast...

360
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:57,099
...with a modest meal of my
own; the victor be determined...

361
00:32:57,099 --> 00:32:59,849
...by the eminent
culinary critic...

362
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,940
...Alexis...

363
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,860
...Chandler Weinberg...

364
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,260
...whose impeccable taste
has only grown...

365
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,626
...more precise
and unforgiving...

366
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,546
...over the years.

367
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:15,298
Rules are rules.

368
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,188
Yes!

369
00:33:29,261 --> 00:33:31,628
Nine. Serving two.

370
00:33:38,158 --> 00:33:41,420
You haven't got a prayer if you
let me get under it like that.

371
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:50,344
You' ll get that later, right?

372
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:01,327
Game point.

373
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,520
-Fuck!
-l' m sorry. I' ll get it.

374
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,688
-Be my guest.
-See all that green stuff?

375
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:18,601
It's poison ivy.

376
00:34:18,961 --> 00:34:20,400
Clever.

377
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,481
-Cowardly is more like it.
-Alright.

378
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:25,328
Put the knives away,
l' ll get the goddamn birdie.

379
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:27,401
Careful.

380
00:34:38,738 --> 00:34:41,138
-Easy, easy.
-Hold still, be a man.

381
00:34:41,138 --> 00:34:44,455
That thing feels like
a Brillo pad, you be a man.

382
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:02,700
-Honey?
-Yeah?

383
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,608
Will you put
some cream on my back?

384
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,380
In a minute.

385
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,799
Lower.

386
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,160
-What are you doing?
-Going to play gold, what else?

387
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,080
Really,
thanks for warning me.

388
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,800
I told you last week.
Where the hell's my glove?

389
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,702
-No, you didn't.
-Well, actually, I did, but...

390
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,681
...Larry Cohen has Lasker teed
up for me on the first hole...

391
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:17,721
...so I don't have time to play
Alzheimer's poker with you?

392
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:20,441
-The famous Lasker deal.
-The one and only.

393
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:22,362
What's it been,
two years now?

394
00:36:22,362 --> 00:36:25,081
Somebody has to do
the dirty work around here.

395
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:26,968
Don't embarrass yourself,
David.

396
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:30,042
I think you' re
projecting, dear.

397
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:32,857
I' ll get the lobsters.
Dig up some steamers...

398
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,897
...and please don't forget
the mushrooms.

399
00:36:35,897 --> 00:36:37,338
Where's... what's his name?

400
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:39,418
Still zoned out
on the hammock?

401
00:36:39,418 --> 00:36:41,499
Have him run a comb
through his hair.

402
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:44,345
Larry might stop by
for a scotch after golf.

403
00:36:47,194 --> 00:36:49,333
-Put some clothes on, will you?
-Yes, sir.

404
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:57,143
I love you.

405
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,408
Sorry.

406
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,401
Sorry. I just came in here to
shut my eyes, if that's alright.

407
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:27,896
I didn't mean to wake you.

408
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:30,785
No, it's okay.

409
00:38:32,258 --> 00:38:34,778
-What time is it, anyway?
-About three.

410
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:38,455
-Where's...?
-David. He's playing golf.

411
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:46,179
I think you might've left
one of these by the hammock.

412
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:48,066
I' ll pick it later.

413
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:50,979
Looks like quite a collection.

414
00:38:50,979 --> 00:38:53,881
Yeah, every once in a while,
I float something out there.

415
00:38:54,819 --> 00:38:56,740
Are you a writer?

416
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,628
No, I wouldn't go that far.

417
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,540
Mind if I take a peek?

418
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,427
Only if you don't mind.

419
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:06,467
No.

420
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:21,504
Wait, why are these all
in different handwriting?

421
00:39:21,702 --> 00:39:23,676
'Cause different people
wrote them.

422
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:27,397
-You said that...
-No, they' re my words.

423
00:39:27,397 --> 00:39:29,667
I just don't
write them myself.

424
00:39:31,557 --> 00:39:33,117
Mind if I ask why?

425
00:39:34,118 --> 00:39:36,965
'Cause I never really
learned how, that's why.

426
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:44,198
That's every funny.

427
00:39:44,198 --> 00:39:46,630
I hope the transcriber
wasn't a nun.

428
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,965
I don't think so,
check the bottom corner.

429
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:53,285
Sandy Diamond?

430
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,679
Oh, Randy. Sweet fella.

431
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:59,080
Ran a scuba clinic
in Des Moines.

432
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,967
A scuba clinic
in Des Moines?

433
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:03,367
You should've seen
the " Ashram" in Vegas.

434
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:04,797
I think l' ll pass.

435
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,647
You' re gonna
get that later, right?

436
00:40:23,498 --> 00:40:25,897
Can I get you something?
Are you hungry?

437
00:40:25,897 --> 00:40:27,177
No, thanks.

438
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:28,966
If you need anything,
let me know.

439
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:38,824
That's our honeymoon in Capri,
I look awful.

440
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:54,655
We got that in Prague.
Said it belonged to Mussolini.

441
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:16,748
My dad shot that in Kenya.

442
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,810
Where's this from?

443
00:41:39,918 --> 00:41:43,082
-You don't mind, do you?
-No, not at all. Help yourself.

444
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,359
Want some?

445
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:00,359
Sure, just a touch.

446
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,280
So anyway, Clarice drags me
to Bloomies go get...

447
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,360
...all my new
boarding school stuff...

448
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,160
...and I fall in love with
these horrid red pumps.

449
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,549
-Nine years old, huh?
-10, thank you very much.

450
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:23,984
Anyway, the big day comes,
l' m all packed up and waiting...

451
00:42:23,984 --> 00:42:26,865
...in the car to take me to
the airport to pick up mummy...

452
00:42:26,865 --> 00:42:29,647
...who came from Munich
to get me up to school...

453
00:42:30,641 --> 00:42:32,561
...when all of a sudden...

454
00:42:32,561 --> 00:42:35,409
...Lulu starts reading
the Bible to me.

455
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:37,361
Who's Lulu?

456
00:42:37,361 --> 00:42:40,338
She was the new nanny. Clarice
got fired the week before.

457
00:42:40,338 --> 00:42:44,082
-Why?
-I don't know. She drank.

458
00:42:44,082 --> 00:42:46,002
Anyway, when we got
to the airport...

459
00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:47,922
...I was so excited...

460
00:42:47,922 --> 00:42:50,770
...I ran like a madman
to meet mummy at the gate...

461
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:53,682
...but instead of
hugs and kisses...

462
00:42:53,682 --> 00:42:55,603
...all I got...

463
00:42:55,603 --> 00:42:57,643
...was a dead cold glare.

464
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:02,290
Not a big fan of red pumps.

465
00:43:06,163 --> 00:43:07,090
What?

466
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:20,980
You' re it!

467
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,442
Wait, I can't...!

468
00:43:23,381 --> 00:43:26,228
-Sorry, are you okay?
-Better be, you' re it.

469
00:43:30,102 --> 00:43:31,029
Push!

470
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:39,661
Harder!

471
00:43:50,263 --> 00:43:52,019
Hold it right there, partner.

472
00:43:56,983 --> 00:43:59,831
My name's Tex,
what's yours?

473
00:44:04,664 --> 00:44:05,592
Wilma.

474
00:44:08,504 --> 00:44:10,616
Funny, you don't look
like a Wilma to me.

475
00:44:10,616 --> 00:44:11,598
Yeah?

476
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,167
Who do I look like?

477
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,528
I'd think you look more...

478
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,847
...Iike a Marilyn.

479
00:44:25,721 --> 00:44:27,641
Alright,
l' m afraid you got me.

480
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:29,528
Yeah, I think I do.

481
00:44:32,442 --> 00:44:34,165
I think I got you, too.

482
00:44:34,521 --> 00:44:35,450
Yeah?

483
00:44:36,282 --> 00:44:38,006
How's that, Miss Monroe?

484
00:44:40,122 --> 00:44:42,937
-'Cause your name isn't Tex.
-ls not?

485
00:44:43,002 --> 00:44:44,725
What is it, then?

486
00:44:45,402 --> 00:44:46,329
Jack.

487
00:44:47,803 --> 00:44:48,730
Jack?

488
00:44:51,643 --> 00:44:53,531
Happy birthday...

489
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:56,563
...to you.

490
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,138
Happy birthday...

491
00:45:03,324 --> 00:45:04,251
...to you.

492
00:45:07,483 --> 00:45:09,305
Happy birthday...

493
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,668
...Mister President...

494
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,507
...happy birthday...

495
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:18,428
...to...

496
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,420
...you.

497
00:45:29,982 --> 00:45:31,061
Ready?

498
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:35,742
Hello? Earth to Mars.

499
00:45:35,742 --> 00:45:36,985
I' m sorry.

500
00:45:37,661 --> 00:45:39,385
Can I ask you a favor?

501
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:41,949
Sure, what is it?

502
00:45:42,462 --> 00:45:44,767
I've got something
on the tip of my tongue.

503
00:45:44,767 --> 00:45:47,320
Would you mind helping me
before it slips away?

504
00:45:48,703 --> 00:45:50,110
Okay, sure.

505
00:46:03,744 --> 00:46:04,824
Shoot.

506
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,439
It's funny...

507
00:46:09,279 --> 00:46:11,167
...your worst nightmare...

508
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:13,567
This is it?

509
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,764
-Yeah.
-Sorry.

510
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,720
It's funny,
your worst nightmare...

511
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,567
...always seems so far away.

512
00:46:29,281 --> 00:46:31,202
Then, all of a sudden...

513
00:46:31,202 --> 00:46:32,282
...there it is...

514
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:36,128
...Iike a monstrous
tidal wave.

515
00:46:39,522 --> 00:46:41,889
You try to escape,
but you can't.

516
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:45,729
You struggle...

517
00:46:47,202 --> 00:46:48,609
...you struggle...

518
00:46:49,602 --> 00:46:50,529
...you struggle...

519
00:46:53,283 --> 00:46:55,323
...your desperate
cries unheard.

520
00:47:00,004 --> 00:47:01,891
Then something
strange happens:

521
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,747
You stop struggling.

522
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,548
Your cries take flight...

523
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,348
...and you forget
you' re drowning.

524
00:47:24,901 --> 00:47:26,981
Yeah, your John Hancock.

525
00:47:26,981 --> 00:47:28,868
Now we can go.

526
00:47:35,622 --> 00:47:37,510
So how' d you
and David meet?

527
00:47:37,701 --> 00:47:40,486
I lost my mind for a few years
after college...

528
00:47:40,486 --> 00:47:41,827
...and he saved me.

529
00:47:42,342 --> 00:47:44,229
Sounds like a good deal.

530
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:03,400
I hope we get lucky.

531
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,123
So, where are they?

532
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:07,207
Be patient.
It's not so simple.

533
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,120
When they' re here...

534
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,008
...they' re hidden.

535
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,593
When they' re not...

536
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,804
...you think they are...

537
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,207
They' re clever.

538
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:21,127
They' re fickle.

539
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:24,489
They feel you coming
and then they hide.

540
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,369
Hey.

541
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,121
Not bad...

542
00:48:37,962 --> 00:48:39,722
...but guess what?

543
00:48:39,722 --> 00:48:41,762
-What?
-You killed it.

544
00:48:42,762 --> 00:48:45,162
You have to break it
above the bulb...

545
00:48:45,162 --> 00:48:46,623
...otherwise
no more can grow.

546
00:48:47,563 --> 00:48:49,162
But you have
great instincts.

547
00:48:49,162 --> 00:48:50,443
It's a "chanterelle".

548
00:48:50,443 --> 00:48:52,330
David's gonna love you.

549
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,427
I' m in love with you.

550
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:10,823
I know it's kind
of sudden, but...

551
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,867
...now that I've laid
eyes on you...

552
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,267
...well, it's just all over.

553
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,147
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

554
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:28,621
The Amanitus Muscarius
is a rare coastal mushroom...

555
00:49:28,621 --> 00:49:31,621
...originally used by the
lroquois to combat red malaria.

556
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:34,061
It also happens to be...

557
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:36,429
...a highly potent
aphrodisiac.

558
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:40,742
Then there's its infamous
sister the Amanita Rubinica.

559
00:49:41,262 --> 00:49:43,531
Affectionately known
as the " Purple Julie"...

560
00:49:44,142 --> 00:49:46,116
...it' ll kill you
in less than a minute.

561
00:49:47,022 --> 00:49:48,782
Guess what they have
in common?

562
00:49:48,782 --> 00:49:49,709
What?

563
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,902
They' re twins.

564
00:49:53,743 --> 00:49:55,630
How can you tell them apart?

565
00:49:56,399 --> 00:49:58,439
" Purple Julie", purple poison.

566
00:50:00,399 --> 00:50:02,319
The Amanitus Muscarius.

567
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,206
-The aphrodisiac?
-Right.

568
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:08,368
How do you know
so much about mushrooms?

569
00:50:08,368 --> 00:50:09,316
My father.

570
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:13,712
He used to drag me out here
from the time I'd walk...

571
00:50:13,712 --> 00:50:16,305
...and go on about their
differences, their stories...

572
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:18,606
...their flavors and
their powers, everything.

573
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,288
Should've seen his eyes
when he talked about them.

574
00:50:22,288 --> 00:50:23,401
Pure magic.

575
00:50:25,361 --> 00:50:27,084
Does he still come out here?

576
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,160
He committed suicide
when I was eight.

577
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,008
-l' m sorry.
-Don't be. He's better off.

578
00:50:34,961 --> 00:50:36,722
What about your mom?

579
00:50:36,722 --> 00:50:37,966
We don't speak.

580
00:50:39,761 --> 00:50:40,841
Why's that?

581
00:50:41,681 --> 00:50:43,405
She hates David.

582
00:50:49,362 --> 00:50:51,249
Pick a hand.

583
00:50:57,939 --> 00:50:59,466
What are you doing?

584
00:51:33,941 --> 00:51:35,348
Behave.

585
00:51:35,701 --> 00:51:37,262
I am behaving.

586
00:51:57,431 --> 00:51:58,379
No.

587
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,367
Let's go, it's getting late.

588
00:52:24,185 --> 00:52:25,264
Are you coming?

589
00:52:28,185 --> 00:52:30,072
I have to be getting back.

590
00:52:46,427 --> 00:52:48,314
Look, I just want
to tell you...

591
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:53,043
-I'd like to say...
-Apology accepted.

592
00:53:00,283 --> 00:53:02,202
-Hello.
-Hi, honey.

593
00:53:02,202 --> 00:53:04,854
How' d it go with Lasker?
You've been gone forever.

594
00:53:07,963 --> 00:53:09,370
David, are you okay?

595
00:53:10,299 --> 00:53:12,242
Yeah, it's just...

596
00:53:15,164 --> 00:53:18,045
-I had some bad clams.
-You had clams?

597
00:53:18,045 --> 00:53:20,443
After golf? But I got
clams for dinner.

598
00:53:20,443 --> 00:53:22,811
-I know.
-Why'd you only get 2 lobsters?

599
00:53:24,765 --> 00:53:26,653
Well, I just...

600
00:53:27,645 --> 00:53:30,492
Because I didn't think
I want to eat any dinner...

601
00:53:31,005 --> 00:53:32,445
...'cause of the clams.

602
00:53:32,445 --> 00:53:35,325
Right. And Larry?
He didn't come back with you?

603
00:53:35,325 --> 00:53:36,405
No, he didn't...

604
00:53:38,205 --> 00:53:39,965
He said to say hi.

605
00:53:39,965 --> 00:53:41,853
Hi from Lasker, too.

606
00:53:43,966 --> 00:53:45,853
I should sit down.

607
00:53:54,462 --> 00:53:56,350
I think I need a compress.

608
00:53:56,543 --> 00:53:59,391
Will you go into the kitchen
and get me a wet cloth?

609
00:53:59,391 --> 00:54:02,588
Lex, he doesn't know
where anything is.

610
00:54:03,103 --> 00:54:04,183
I' ll go.

611
00:54:12,703 --> 00:54:14,591
You have a very loyal wife.

612
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,720
I think tonight's
not such a good night...

613
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,384
...for this food showdown.

614
00:54:20,384 --> 00:54:22,304
I' m gonna put him to bed...

615
00:54:22,304 --> 00:54:24,214
...and run you over
to lslesboro, okay?

616
00:54:26,144 --> 00:54:28,032
She may be right.

617
00:54:28,385 --> 00:54:30,905
We should probably
take a rain check.

618
00:54:33,825 --> 00:54:35,745
Okay, but I got to say...

619
00:54:35,745 --> 00:54:38,233
...I was kind of looking
forward to the challenge.

620
00:54:41,505 --> 00:54:43,393
You know what, so was l.

621
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:47,202
I fact,
I think a warm shower...

622
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:50,104
...and a cold drink will put
me right back in the swing.

623
00:54:51,043 --> 00:54:53,923
-David, I don't think...
-Exactly, don't think...

624
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,167
...drink!

625
00:55:08,324 --> 00:55:10,212
It's amazing, David.

626
00:55:29,925 --> 00:55:31,648
So did you two
have a good day?

627
00:55:33,765 --> 00:55:35,326
I gave him the grand tour.

628
00:55:42,662 --> 00:55:44,223
How did you like it?

629
00:55:45,702 --> 00:55:46,783
It was nice.

630
00:55:52,423 --> 00:55:55,303
-Good luck.
-Thanks for everything.

631
00:55:55,303 --> 00:55:57,063
See you in twenty.

632
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:59,583
Call the phone company,
it's still out.

633
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:01,023
Done.

634
00:56:02,024 --> 00:56:03,911
Here, this is for you.

635
00:56:04,904 --> 00:56:06,627
How about that?

636
00:56:06,824 --> 00:56:09,158
-How thoughtful.
-I made it here.

637
00:56:10,664 --> 00:56:12,552
It's very nice, thank you.

638
00:56:49,002 --> 00:56:50,890
What are you doing
back here?

639
00:56:51,883 --> 00:56:54,729
Is everything okay,
where's David?

640
00:56:55,723 --> 00:56:57,643
We got in a little...

641
00:56:57,643 --> 00:57:00,261
He's outside
closing up or something.

642
00:57:00,523 --> 00:57:02,890
-You got in a little what?
-Jam.

643
00:57:03,403 --> 00:57:05,323
Boat died.

644
00:57:05,323 --> 00:57:08,043
-Had to paddle back.
-l' m sorry.

645
00:57:08,043 --> 00:57:10,252
I' ll be right back,
do you need anything?

646
00:57:10,252 --> 00:57:11,845
A sea plane would be nice.

647
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:41,000
There you are, poor thing.
What happened?

648
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:44,622
The boat conked out halfway
there. It was a nightmare.

649
00:57:44,622 --> 00:57:46,541
-I know, I heard.
-Did you?

650
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:48,942
-Yes, I did.
-So, I guess James Dean

651
00:57:48,942 --> 00:57:50,863
...is gonna be making
himself at home.

652
00:57:50,863 --> 00:57:52,783
We could always call
Mike and Mary.

653
00:57:52,783 --> 00:57:55,215
What are you gonna do,
scream across the bay?

654
00:57:55,215 --> 00:57:56,942
-Right, the phone.
-The phone.

655
00:57:56,942 --> 00:57:59,791
Why is this all my fault?
You think I want him here?

656
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:01,232
-I don't know, do you?
-No.

657
00:58:01,232 --> 00:58:02,824
Good. That makes two of us.

658
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:10,510
You know...

659
00:58:11,503 --> 00:58:12,910
...I look at you...

660
00:58:14,864 --> 00:58:16,304
...and it' s funny...

661
00:58:16,304 --> 00:58:19,152
...you don't remind me
of myself exactly...

662
00:58:23,184 --> 00:58:25,868
...but you remind me of
a certain time in my youth.

663
00:58:26,865 --> 00:58:29,745
I remember what I used
to think love was then.

664
00:58:29,745 --> 00:58:32,592
I thought it was
the fireworks...

665
00:58:33,584 --> 00:58:35,408
...the explosions...

666
00:58:37,521 --> 00:58:39,245
...the highlights.

667
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:46,449
But it's not.

668
00:58:50,162 --> 00:58:51,723
It's time.

669
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:54,610
To go through seasons
together...

670
00:58:54,802 --> 00:58:56,526
...through change...

671
00:58:57,523 --> 00:58:59,411
...through the
ups and downs...

672
00:59:00,562 --> 00:59:02,163
...to be able...

673
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,051
...to look your beloved...

674
00:59:04,244 --> 00:59:06,131
...in the eye and say:

675
00:59:09,044 --> 00:59:10,931
" We did that, together...

676
00:59:11,284 --> 00:59:12,844
...as one".

677
00:59:14,324 --> 00:59:16,211
" We chose each other...

678
00:59:18,644 --> 00:59:20,913
...above all others".

679
00:59:27,285 --> 00:59:28,365
That is...

680
00:59:29,206 --> 00:59:30,285
...Iove.

681
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,947
It's unexplainable.

682
00:59:33,461 --> 00:59:35,021
It' s a secret...

683
00:59:37,301 --> 00:59:39,636
...that can only be known...

684
00:59:41,142 --> 00:59:42,385
...once...

685
00:59:42,582 --> 00:59:44,470
...you've done...

686
00:59:44,822 --> 00:59:46,383
...the time.

687
00:59:58,422 --> 01:00:00,626
It's nice what
you said downstairs.

688
01:00:03,864 --> 01:00:05,587
I meant it.

689
01:00:10,424 --> 01:00:12,344
What a weekend, huh?

690
01:00:12,344 --> 01:00:14,067
You' re telling me.

691
01:00:19,064 --> 01:00:20,952
Sorry I left you alone today.

692
01:00:21,304 --> 01:00:22,866
Don't worry.

693
01:00:24,825 --> 01:00:26,712
So everything was okay?

694
01:00:27,225 --> 01:00:28,152
Yeah, you know?

695
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,408
You weren't bored
or anything?

696
01:00:33,882 --> 01:00:35,442
No, not especially.

697
01:00:37,241 --> 01:00:39,609
I mean, I wasn't not bored...

698
01:00:40,121 --> 01:00:42,489
...I' m glad you got to do
what you wanted.

699
01:00:44,922 --> 01:00:45,849
Good.

700
01:00:47,802 --> 01:00:49,842
Just as long as
you were not bored.

701
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:33,209
Morning, sweetheart.

702
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:36,885
Morning.

703
01:01:38,206 --> 01:01:39,613
What's wrong?

704
01:01:39,965 --> 01:01:41,527
Look in the mirror.

705
01:01:46,366 --> 01:01:49,214
-Christ.
-Want me to put Calamine on?

706
01:01:49,726 --> 01:01:51,614
-No.
-Suit yourself.

707
01:01:56,862 --> 01:01:59,765
-How long have you been up?
-I don't know, an hour.

708
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,450
Are you ready?

709
01:02:03,647 --> 01:02:05,535
Almost. Are you?

710
01:02:09,408 --> 01:02:11,295
Got over an hour.

711
01:02:11,808 --> 01:02:13,247
Where's your watch?

712
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:15,424
-l' m not wearing it.
-You always wear it.

713
01:02:15,424 --> 01:02:16,569
Not today.

714
01:02:23,009 --> 01:02:26,624
So, where's our little friend?

715
01:02:26,624 --> 01:02:28,511
Outside, I think.

716
01:02:32,385 --> 01:02:34,654
-I better take care of the boat.
-It's done.

717
01:02:36,225 --> 01:02:38,401
-What do you mean, it's done?
-He did it.

718
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:39,863
-When?
-This morning.

719
01:02:42,146 --> 01:02:44,033
Said it was a loose spark.

720
01:02:44,866 --> 01:02:46,753
Speaking of the Devil...

721
01:02:51,585 --> 01:02:54,466
-Morning, David.
-lt' ll be ready in a minute.

722
01:02:54,466 --> 01:02:55,394
Cool.

723
01:02:56,546 --> 01:02:58,306
What' ll be ready
in a minute?

724
01:02:58,306 --> 01:03:00,067
-My shirt.
-His shirt.

725
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,954
It was still wet this morning.

726
01:03:02,307 --> 01:03:04,478
-Don't you have another one?
-Nope.

727
01:03:07,907 --> 01:03:09,828
Don't, it's going to spread.

728
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:11,715
Where else can it spread?

729
01:03:14,627 --> 01:03:16,896
I' ll just go and see
if your shirt's ready.

730
01:03:20,388 --> 01:03:22,210
I like your face...

731
01:03:24,165 --> 01:03:27,013
Your watch.
The face is cool.

732
01:03:30,885 --> 01:03:32,805
Alexis gave that to me.

733
01:03:32,805 --> 01:03:33,885
It's beautiful.

734
01:03:34,566 --> 01:03:37,765
We fixed the phone,
by the way. Alexis and me.

735
01:03:37,765 --> 01:03:40,449
-Really? When?
-This morning. Woke me up...

736
01:03:41,446 --> 01:03:44,381
...and asked me to hold two
wires together while she taped.

737
01:03:45,286 --> 01:03:46,530
Any calls?

738
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:51,206
-Thanks.
-So, you' re quite the mechanic.

739
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:53,703
It was nothing,
I found the cable cut out back.

740
01:03:53,703 --> 01:03:55,046
It's probably raccoons.

741
01:03:55,046 --> 01:03:56,807
-Good for you. Any calls?
-No.

742
01:03:56,807 --> 01:03:58,567
There were 2 messages
in Boston.

743
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:00,679
Larry called Boston.
Lasker looks 50-50.

744
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:02,503
Tom is desperate
for squash.

745
01:04:02,503 --> 01:04:05,000
He's always desperate.
Did you call anybody?

746
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,210
No, why?

747
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:10,344
No reason. I was wondering
if it was calling out or not?

748
01:04:10,344 --> 01:04:14,054
Of course it is. How do you
think I checked the machine?

749
01:04:18,408 --> 01:04:19,269
Yeah.

750
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,120
Would you like anything?

751
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,520
-No, thanks.
-Come on, eat something.

752
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,982
How about a banana?

753
01:04:26,504 --> 01:04:28,392
Dab of milk would be nice.

754
01:04:38,026 --> 01:04:40,106
-So is everything okay?
-Yes. Thanks.

755
01:04:40,106 --> 01:04:41,350
Okay, bye.

756
01:04:44,265 --> 01:04:45,673
Who was it?

757
01:04:45,866 --> 01:04:48,550
-Mike.
-Good, are they coming by?

758
01:04:49,482 --> 01:04:51,626
Still in Portland
with Mary's mother.

759
01:04:51,626 --> 01:04:54,790
They' ll be back tomorrow.
Mary says hi.

760
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,114
What's so funny?

761
01:05:00,106 --> 01:05:01,547
I don't know.

762
01:05:01,547 --> 01:05:02,953
Couples, I guess.

763
01:05:03,148 --> 01:05:04,907
Couples?

764
01:05:04,907 --> 01:05:07,084
Maybe someday,
you' ll look in the mirror...

765
01:05:07,084 --> 01:05:08,812
...and have a snicker
to yourself.

766
01:05:08,812 --> 01:05:10,153
Come on, David.

767
01:05:12,107 --> 01:05:13,667
Here it comes.

768
01:05:15,947 --> 01:05:17,289
I don't want one.

769
01:05:17,804 --> 01:05:19,244
You always have a banana.

770
01:05:19,244 --> 01:05:22,188
Not today, so next time you
feel the need to generalize...

771
01:05:22,188 --> 01:05:25,964
...you can say: " You almost
always have a banana".

772
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:28,812
Thank you, David, maybe
I won't say anything at all.

773
01:05:31,725 --> 01:05:33,765
-May I have a cigarette?
-Yeah.

774
01:05:45,647 --> 01:05:47,207
There's more in the fridge.

775
01:05:55,566 --> 01:05:57,127
Would you like a glass?

776
01:06:07,247 --> 01:06:10,411
-Would you like a glass, David?
-No, I wouldn't. But thank you.

777
01:06:17,103 --> 01:06:19,624
Are your hands dirty,
Alexis?

778
01:06:22,064 --> 01:06:22,991
Excuse me?

779
01:06:23,504 --> 01:06:26,384
I was wondering why you were
cleaning a clean glass.

780
01:06:26,384 --> 01:06:29,264
I thought maybe it was
because your hands were dirty.

781
01:06:29,264 --> 01:06:32,242
I don't know what kind of
poison is flowing through you...

782
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:34,313
...but whatever it is
keep it to yourself.

783
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:36,748
Sorry about this.

784
01:06:36,945 --> 01:06:39,537
I know this isn't as much
fun as the boat house...

785
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:42,833
...but life isn't all
cowboys and lndians, is it?

786
01:06:46,546 --> 01:06:47,974
Is it?

787
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:52,107
What in God's name
are you trying to accomplish?

788
01:06:54,226 --> 01:06:56,146
It's not too bright in here,
is it?

789
01:06:56,146 --> 01:06:58,418
Honey, would you close
the shades for him?

790
01:06:58,418 --> 01:07:01,353
You know how much he likes
the shades closed in the day.

791
01:07:05,267 --> 01:07:07,372
All right, l' ll do it.

792
01:07:11,507 --> 01:07:15,021
-You bastard.
-I was setting the right mood.

793
01:07:15,284 --> 01:07:18,388
Maybe you should go outside
and take a walk and cool down.

794
01:07:18,388 --> 01:07:20,308
-Should l?
-Yes, I think you should.

795
01:07:20,308 --> 01:07:22,004
Wouldn't that be
convenient?

796
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:25,364
Especially if I kept walking
and then you and Valentino...

797
01:07:25,364 --> 01:07:28,244
...could call all your friends
and maybe even " mummy"...

798
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:32,085
...if she' ll take the call, and you
let them know that bastard...

799
01:07:32,085 --> 01:07:34,517
...with his endless mood
swings and depressions...

800
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:37,366
...is gone once and for all;
the gold-digging kike...

801
01:07:37,366 --> 01:07:40,086
...who squanders
the family millions...

802
01:07:40,086 --> 01:07:41,686
...and makes
everyone miserable...

803
01:07:41,686 --> 01:07:43,605
...is finally out
of the picture.

804
01:07:43,605 --> 01:07:46,006
Wouldn't that be a relief?

805
01:07:46,006 --> 01:07:48,534
No more deadbeat days,
no more sleepless nights...

806
01:07:48,534 --> 01:07:51,158
...no more David Weinberg.
Wouldn't that be a dream?

807
01:07:51,158 --> 01:07:52,686
I feel so sorry for you.

808
01:07:52,887 --> 01:07:55,126
Yeah, you better be
sorry for me.

809
01:07:55,126 --> 01:07:56,886
Who wouldn't feel
sorry for me?

810
01:07:56,886 --> 01:08:00,301
Seven years stuck
in a coffin with you.

811
01:08:10,423 --> 01:08:11,830
A coffin?

812
01:08:13,784 --> 01:08:14,864
A coffin.

813
01:08:17,144 --> 01:08:19,511
Are you sure you want
to say that, David?

814
01:08:20,024 --> 01:08:22,544
I was sure the day
I married you.

815
01:08:25,304 --> 01:08:28,152
I just didn't have
the courage to admit it.

816
01:08:34,905 --> 01:08:37,142
Have I gone too far?

817
01:08:40,185 --> 01:08:42,551
Should I not be honest?

818
01:08:46,426 --> 01:08:50,106
There she goes: the Lexie
Chandler we all know and love.

819
01:08:50,106 --> 01:08:53,146
When in doubt,
shut them out!

820
01:08:53,146 --> 01:08:55,067
Shut, shut, shut.

821
01:08:55,067 --> 01:08:57,466
Shut, shut, shut,
shut them out!

822
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,866
Shut them out till
all the doors are closed.

823
01:08:59,866 --> 01:09:02,138
She's dragged us all down
into her coffin...

824
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,146
...just like daddy.

825
01:09:11,483 --> 01:09:12,564
Get out.

826
01:09:15,324 --> 01:09:16,752
Get out!

827
01:09:19,964 --> 01:09:21,393
Get out!

828
01:09:22,045 --> 01:09:23,473
Get out!

829
01:09:30,525 --> 01:09:31,604
Get out.

830
01:09:35,325 --> 01:09:36,983
Excuse me?

831
01:09:39,165 --> 01:09:40,092
Get out.

832
01:10:05,183 --> 01:10:06,427
David, no!

833
01:10:29,985 --> 01:10:30,913
David!

834
01:11:13,188 --> 01:11:15,359
David, l' m begging
you please...

835
01:11:16,068 --> 01:11:16,995
No!

836
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:50,593
He's all yours, Lex.

837
01:11:51,591 --> 01:11:53,478
Get off my island, David.

838
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:57,317
Your island?

839
01:11:57,830 --> 01:11:59,652
My island.

840
01:12:00,486 --> 01:12:02,046
Alas!

841
01:12:03,047 --> 01:12:04,291
The wolf...

842
01:12:04,967 --> 01:12:06,854
...sheds her wool.

843
01:12:07,367 --> 01:12:08,774
Alas!

844
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:53,896
Are you okay?

845
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:56,777
Where is he?

846
01:12:57,226 --> 01:12:58,471
Gone.

847
01:12:59,626 --> 01:13:01,514
Did you call the police?

848
01:13:02,506 --> 01:13:03,435
No.

849
01:13:05,387 --> 01:13:06,794
No cops.

850
01:13:40,909 --> 01:13:42,797
What are we going to do
with that?

851
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:56,627
It's funny...

852
01:14:56,627 --> 01:14:59,475
...your worst nightmare
always seems so far away.

853
01:14:59,986 --> 01:15:02,191
Then, all of a sudden...

854
01:15:02,387 --> 01:15:03,987
...there it is...

855
01:15:03,987 --> 01:15:06,191
...Iike a monstrous
tidal wave.

856
01:15:07,188 --> 01:15:10,035
You try to escape,
but you can't.

857
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:13,395
You struggle, struggle
and struggle...

858
01:15:13,907 --> 01:15:15,948
...your desperate
cries unheard.

859
01:15:17,748 --> 01:15:19,635
Then something
strange happens.

860
01:15:21,108 --> 01:15:22,515
You stop struggling.

861
01:15:23,508 --> 01:15:24,948
Your cry takes flight...

862
01:15:24,948 --> 01:15:26,388
" Your cry takes flight.

863
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:28,309
...and you forget
you' re drowning.

864
01:15:28,309 --> 01:15:30,197
And you forget
you' re drowning".

865
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:33,109
Those were the
departing words...

866
01:15:33,109 --> 01:15:34,996
...of a unique
woman of courage...

867
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:37,869
...for whom the
struggles of life...

868
01:15:38,389 --> 01:15:40,593
...had become
too much to bear.

869
01:15:41,429 --> 01:15:43,670
Let me implore you,
however...

870
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:45,557
...amidst your sorrow...

871
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:48,917
...to remember little
Lexie Chandler...

872
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:52,246
...the incarnation
of pure innocence...

873
01:15:52,246 --> 01:15:54,167
...and wondrous joy...

874
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:56,086
...bounding barefoot...

875
01:15:56,086 --> 01:15:58,006
...along the rocky shores...

876
01:15:58,006 --> 01:15:59,413
...of Dark Harbor.

877
01:16:40,249 --> 01:16:42,453
That was a beautiful service,
Paul.

878
01:16:55,067 --> 01:16:55,994
David.

879
01:17:02,267 --> 01:17:03,194
Alexis.

880
01:17:06,587 --> 01:17:08,954
Tale off the glasses, David.

881
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:25,275
Her suicide note.

882
01:17:32,029 --> 01:17:33,752
Thank you for coming.

883
01:20:00,646 --> 01:20:01,726
Finally.

884
01:20:24,649 --> 01:20:26,055
How are you?

885
01:20:29,928 --> 01:20:32,295
I have had some bad nights.

886
01:20:36,169 --> 01:20:38,274
Well, I am here now.

887
01:20:41,929 --> 01:20:42,856
That is...

888
01:20:44,809 --> 01:20:46,697
...all I wanted.

889
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:50,057
You proved it.

890
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:56,068
I hope so.
