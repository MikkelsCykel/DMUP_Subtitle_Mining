1
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,230
Out west there was this fella,

2
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,356
fella I want to tell you about,

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,512
fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski -

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,876
at least that's the handle
his parents gave him.

5
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,270
But he never had
much use for it himself.

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,069
This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.

7
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,392
Now, Dude, that's a name
no one would self-apply

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,311
where I come from.

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,996
There was a lot about the Dude
that didn't make sense to me,

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,197
and a lot about
where he lived, likewise.

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,631
But then again,

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,554
maybe that's why I found
the place so darn interesting.

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,072
They call Los Angeles
the City of Angels.

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,197
I didn't find it
to be that exactly.

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,397
But there are
some nice folks there.

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,711
'Course I can't
say I seen London,

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,109
and I never been to France,

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,954
and I ain't never seen
no queen in her damned undies.

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,918
But I'll tell you what,

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,070
after seeing Los Angeles

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,913
and this story
I'm about to unfold,

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,312
well, I guess I seen somethin'
every bit as stupefyin'

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,073
as you'd see
in any other places,

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,276
and in English, too.

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,079
So I can die
with a smile on my face

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,232
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,880
Now, this story
I'm about to unfold

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,030
took place
back in the early 90s,

29
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,830
about the time of our conflict
with Saddam and the Iraqis.

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,196
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man -

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,239
I won't say a hero,
'cause what's a hero?

32
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,118
But sometimes there's a man -

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,078
and I'm talking
about the Dude here -

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,594
sometimes there's a man...

35
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,231
Well, he's the man
for his time and place.

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,390
He fits right in there,

37
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,994
and that's the Dude,

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,957
in Los Angeles.

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,759
And even if he's a lazy man,

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,673
and the Dude was
most certainly that,

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,196
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,111
which would place him high

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,192
in the running
for laziest worldwide.

44
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,510
But sometimes there's a man,

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,477
sometimes...

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,551
there's a man...

47
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,428
Wow, lost my train
of thought here.

48
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,512
But... ah, hell.

49
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,352
I done introduced him enough.

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,477
'This will not stand.

51
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,235
'This will not stand,
this aggression against Kuwait.'

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,911
Where's the money, Lebowski?

53
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,109
I want that money, Lebowski.
Bunny says you're good for it.

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,714
Where's the money, Lebowski?

55
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,916
Where's the money, Lebowski?

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,195
Where's the fucking
money, shithead?

57
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,555
It's down there somewhere.
Let me take another look.

58
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,438
Don't fuck with us!

59
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,713
Your wife owes money
to Jackie Treehorn.

60
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,712
That means you owe
money to Jackie Treehorn.

61
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,519
Ever thus
to deadbeats, Lebowski.

62
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,999
Don't do that...

63
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,271
- Not on the rug, man.
- See?

64
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,352
See what happens, Lebowski?
You see what happens?

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,352
Nobody calls me Lebowski.
You got the wrong man.

66
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,078
I'm the Dude, man.

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,153
Your name's Lebowski, Lebowski.
Your wife is Bunny.

68
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,720
My... my wife... my wife, Bunny?

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,870
Do you see a wedding ring?

70
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,155
Does this place
look like I'm married?

71
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,515
The toilet seat's up, man.

72
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,511
What the fuck is this?

73
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,637
Obviously, you're not a golfer.

74
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,596
- Woo?
- Yeah?

75
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,990
Isn't this guy supposed
to be a millionaire?

76
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,752
Fuck!

77
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,474
- Yeah, what do you think?
- He looks like a fucking loser.

78
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,313
Hey, at least I'm housebroken.

79
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,154
Fucking time wasted.
Thanks a lot, asshole.

80
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,796
I'm throwing rocks tonight.
Mark it, Dude.

81
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,156
This was a valued rug.
This was a...

82
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,038
It really
tied the room together.

83
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,156
So this was a valued...

84
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,878
- What tied the room together?
- My rug.

85
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,791
- Were you listening, Donny?
- What?

86
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,235
Were you listening
to the Dude's story?

87
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,639
I was bowling.

88
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,599
You have no frame of reference,
like a child who wanders in...

89
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,432
Walter, what's the point?

90
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,511
There's no reason -
here's my point, Dude -

91
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,875
- there's no reason...
- Yeah, what's your point?

92
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,155
- Huh?
- Walter, what is the point...

93
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,549
We know who is at fault here.

94
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,517
What the fuck
are you talking about?

95
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,239
No, what the fuck are you...
I'm not...

96
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,232
We're talking about
unchecked aggression here.

97
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,992
- What is he talking about?
- My rug.

98
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,435
Forget it,
you're out of your element.

99
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,195
The Chinaman who peed on my rug,
I can't go give him a bill.

100
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,874
So what the fuck
are you talking about?

101
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,996
The Chinaman
is not the issue here.

102
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,992
I'm talking about
drawing a line in the sand.

103
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,275
Across this line, you do not...

104
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,796
Also, Dude, "Chinaman" is not
the preferred nomenclature.

105
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,757
"Asian-American," please.

106
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,276
This isn't a guy who built
the railroads here...

107
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,749
- What the fuck...
- He peed on my rug.

108
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,469
- He peed on the Dude's rug.
- You're out of your element!

109
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,313
Dude, the Chinaman
is not the issue here.

110
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,595
- So, who... who...
- Jeff Lebowski.

111
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,229
The other Jeffrey Lebowski,
the millionaire.

112
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,039
That's fucking interesting, man.
That's fucking interesting.

113
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,112
Plus, he has the wealth
and the resources...

114
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,668
so there's no reason,
no fucking reason

115
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,274
why his wife
should go out, owe money,

116
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,828
and then they pee
on your fucking rug!

117
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,592
- Am I wrong?
- No.

118
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,272
- Am I wrong?
- But...

119
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,112
OK, then.

120
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,715
That rug really tied
the room together, did it not?

121
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,916
- Fuckin' A!
- And he peed on it.

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,513
Donny, please.

123
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,353
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

124
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,477
His name is Lebowski?
That's your name, Dude.

125
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,916
He should compensate me
for the fucking rug.

126
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,549
His wife owes money,
and they pee on my rug?

127
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,189
- They pee on your fucking rug.
- They peed on my fucking rug.

128
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,998
That's right, Dude.

129
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,152
They peed on your fucking rug.

130
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,838
This is the study.
The various commendations...

131
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,911
Jeffrey Lebowski.

132
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,072
- Honorary degrees, etcetera.
- Very impressive.

133
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,549
Oh, please feel free
to inspect them.

134
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,916
- Oh, I'm not really that...
- Oh, please, please.

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,309
That is the key
to the city of Pasadena,

136
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,678
which Mr Lebowski received in
recognition of various civic...

137
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,512
Oh, that's the Los Angeles

138
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,273
Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award,

139
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,828
which is... not
necessarily given every year.

140
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,230
Hey, is this, uh,
is this him with Nancy?

141
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,279
Yes, indeed, that is Mr Lebowski
with the First Lady...

142
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,828
That's Lebowski
on the left there?

143
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,434
Of course.
Mr Lebowski on the left...

144
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,478
He's a cripple... you know,
a... handicapped guy?

145
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,870
Mr Lebowski is disabled, yes.
This picture was taken

146
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,838
when Mrs Reagan was
First Lady of the nation.

147
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,753
- Yes, yes. Not of California.
- Pope John.

148
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,229
He met privately
with the president,

149
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,834
but there was no time
for a photo opportunity.

150
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,036
- Nancy's pretty good.
- Wonderful woman!

151
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,872
These are...

152
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,032
Those are Mr Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

153
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,156
Different mothers?
Racially, pretty cool.

154
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,434
They're not literally
his children.

155
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,750
They're the Little
Lebowski Urban Achievers,

156
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,115
inner-city children of promise

157
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,873
but without the means
for a higher education.

158
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,679
Mr Lebowski is committed
to sending them to college.

159
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,228
Excuse me. Thank you, thank you.

160
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,153
Far out. Think he's
got room for one more?

161
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,435
One, uh... Oh!

162
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,750
You never went to college.
Please, don't touch that.

163
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,638
Yeah, I did, but I spent
most of my time...

164
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,632
occupying various
administration buildings,

165
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,631
smoking a lot of Thai stick,

166
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,234
breaking into the R.O.T.C.
And bowling.

167
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,675
To tell you the truth,
I don't remember much.

168
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,191
OK, sir, you're a Lebowski,
I'm a Lebowski,

169
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,111
that's terrific.

170
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,112
But I'm very busy,
as I imagine you are.

171
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,475
What can I do for you, sir?

172
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,950
Well, sir, it's this rug I have,

173
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,793
it really tied
the room together...

174
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,555
You told Brandt, he told me.
Where do I fit in?

175
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,757
Well, they were
looking for you, these guys.

176
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,796
I'll say it again.

177
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,917
You told Brandt
on the phone, he told me.

178
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,752
I know what happened. Yes?

179
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,230
So you know that they were
trying to piss on your rug?

180
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,629
Did I urinate on your rug?

181
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,188
Did you personally
come and pee on my rug?

182
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,397
Hello! Do you speak English?
Parla usted ingles?

183
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,392
I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

184
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,438
No, like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

185
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,590
I want to understand this, sir.

186
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,229
Every time a rug is
micturated upon in this city,

187
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,878
I have to compensate...

188
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,635
Come on, man, I'm not
trying to scam anybody here.

189
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,438
I... I was just...

190
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,830
You're just looking for
a handout like every other...

191
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,593
Are you employed, Mr Lebowski?

192
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,150
Wait, let me
explain something to you.

193
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,550
I am not Mr Lebowski.
You're Mr Lebowski.

194
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,473
I'm the Dude.
So that's what you call me,

195
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,836
you know, uh, that
or, uh, his Dudeness,

196
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,753
or Duder, or, you
know, uh, el Duderino,

197
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,832
if you're not into
the whole brevity thing.

198
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,276
- Are you employed, sir?
- Employed?

199
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,434
You don't look for a job
dressed like that on a weekday?

200
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,432
Is this a... What day is this?

201
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,910
Well, I do work, sir.
So if you don't mind...

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,230
No, I do mind. The Dude minds.

203
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,276
This will not stand, you know.

204
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,352
This aggression
will not stand, man.

205
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,228
- I mean, your wife owes...
- My wife is not the issue!

206
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,233
I hope that my wife will learn
to live on her ample allowance.

207
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,471
If not, that's
her problem, not mine,

208
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,471
just as the rug is your problem,

209
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,872
just as every bum's lot in life
is his own responsibility,

210
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,235
regardless of who
he chooses to blame.

211
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,312
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.

212
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,119
Some Chinaman
took them from me in Korea.

213
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,192
But I went out
and achieved anyway.

214
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,989
I cannot solve your problems,
sir, only you can.

215
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,955
- Oh, fuck it.
- "Oh, fuck it."

216
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,634
Yes, that's your answer
to everything.

217
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,119
Tattoo it on your forehead.

218
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,351
Your revolution
is over, Mr Lebowski!

219
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,954
Condolences! The bums lost!

220
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,555
My advice to you
is to do what your parents did!

221
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,358
Get a job, sir!

222
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,433
The bums will always lose!
Do you hear me, Lebowski?

223
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,953
The bums...

224
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,155
How was your meeting,
Mr Lebowski?

225
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,552
OK. The old man told me
to take any rug in the house.

226
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,633
Well, enjoy, and perhaps
we'll see you again, Dude.

227
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,474
Sure, if I'm in
the neighbourhood, you know,

228
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,357
and, um...

229
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,670
I need to use the john.

230
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,119
Blow on them.

231
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,475
Go ahead, blow.

232
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,156
You want me to blow
on your toes?

233
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,357
Uh-huh. I can't blow that far.

234
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,517
Are you sure he won't mind?

235
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,229
He doesn't care about anything.
He's a nihilist.

236
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,788
Oh, that must be exhausting.

237
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,598
You're not blowing.

238
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,513
He has to be getting along,
Mrs Lebowski.

239
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,670
Oh, you're Bunny.

240
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,270
I'll suck your cock for $1,000.

241
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,912
Wonderful woman.

242
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,560
We're very fond of her.
Very free-spirited.

243
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,200
Brandt can't watch,
or he has to pay 100.

244
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,672
That's marvellous.

245
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,349
I'm just gonna
go find a cash machine.

246
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,474
Whoo! Slamming them tonight!

247
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,630
You guys are dead in the water.

248
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,393
All right! Way to go, Donny!

249
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,029
If you will it, it is no dream.

250
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,112
You're 20 minutes late, man.
What the fuck is that?

251
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,031
Theodore Herzel.

252
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,033
The state of Israel. If you
will it, Dude, it is no dream.

253
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,715
The carrier. What's
in the fucking carrier?

254
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,236
Oh, Cynthia's dog.
I think it's a Pomeranian.

255
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,390
I can't leave him,
he eats the furniture.

256
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,914
I'm watching it
while they're in Hawaii.

257
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,276
- You brought it bowling?
- "Brought it bowling"?

258
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,397
I didn't rent it shoes,
I'm not buying it a beer,

259
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,516
he's not taking your turn, Dude.

260
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,831
If my ex-wife asked me
to take care of her dog

261
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,514
while she and her boyfriend
went to Honolulu,

262
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,272
I'd tell her to fuck herself.

263
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,316
Dude, you don't have an ex,

264
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,312
and this is a fucking show dog
with fucking papers.

265
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,791
You can't board it. It gets
upset. Its hair falls out.

266
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,836
Over the line!

267
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,230
Sorry, you were over the line.
That's a foul.

268
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,231
Bullshit. Mark it 8, Dude.

269
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,073
Excuse me, mark it zero.
Next frame.

270
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,310
Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it 8, Dude.

271
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,551
This is not 'Nam, this
is bowling. There are rules.

272
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,870
Hey, Walter, come on,
it's Smokey.

273
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,997
His toe slipped over.
It's just a game.

274
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,516
It determines who enters
the round-robin. Am I wrong?

275
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,318
- Yeah, but...
- Am I wrong?

276
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,277
Yeah, but I wasn't over.

277
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,954
Give me the marker, Dude.
I'm marking an 8.

278
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,510
Smokey, my friend,
you're entering a world of pain.

279
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,989
- Walter...
- You mark that frame an 8,

280
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,878
you're entering a world of pain.

281
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,633
- I'm not...
- A world of pain.

282
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,029
Look, Dude,
this is your partner.

283
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,838
Has the world gone crazy?

284
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,593
Am I the only one
who cares about the rules?

285
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,999
Mark it zero!

286
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,072
- They're calling the cops.
- Mark it zero!

287
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,754
- Put the piece away.
- Walter...

288
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,354
You think I'm fucking around?
Mark it zero!

289
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,996
All right, it's fucking zero.

290
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,277
You happy, you crazy fuck?

291
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,875
It's a league game, Smoke.

292
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,959
You can't do that, man.

293
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,275
These guys are like me.
They're pacifists.

294
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,316
Smokey was
a conscientious objector.

295
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,039
I myself dabbled in pacifism,

296
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,111
not in 'Nam, of course.

297
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,668
You know he's got
emotional problems.

298
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,990
You mean, beyond pacifism?

299
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,436
He's fragile, very fragile.

300
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,115
I did not know that.

301
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,237
Well, it's all
water under the bridge,

302
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,834
and we do enter
the next round-robin.

303
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,309
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're not wrong.

304
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,517
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're just an asshole!

305
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,070
OK. We play Quintana
and O'Brien next week.

306
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,754
They should be pushovers.

307
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,229
Man, will you just...

308
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,470
Just take it easy, man.

309
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,790
That's your answer
for everything, Dude.

310
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,749
Look at our current situation
with that camelfucker in Iraq.

311
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,070
Pacifism is not
something to hide behind.

312
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,276
Just take it easy, man.

313
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,237
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

314
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,676
- Waving the fucking gun around?
- Calmer than you are.

315
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,398
Just take it easy!

316
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,316
Calmer than you are.

317
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,196
'Dude, this is Smokey.

318
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,271
'I don't want to
be a hard-on about this.

will submit this to the league

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,039
'So, like I say,
you know, fair warning.

324
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,076

325

this is Brandt at, uh,

- Hey, Monty.

Dude, I... I finally got...
the venue I wanted.

335
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,436
I'm performing my dance quintet,
you know, my cycle,

at Crane Jackson's Fountain
Street Theatre on Tuesday night.

337
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,798
And, well, I'd love it
if you came and gave me notes.

338
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,711
I'll be there, man.

339
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,351
Tomorrow's already the 10th.

340
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,237
Far out.

341
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,275
Oh. Oh, all right, OK.

342
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,874

We've had terrible news.
Mr Lebowski's in seclusion.

353
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,634
Mr Lebowski.

354
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,194
Funny...

355
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,196
I can look back
on a life of achievement,

356
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,430
challenges met,

357
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,397
competitors bested,

358
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,119
obstacles overcome.

359
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,595
I've accomplished more
than most men

360
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,148
and without the use of my legs.

361
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,718
What...

362
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,236
What makes a man, Mr Lebowski?

363
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,516
Dude.

364
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,873
I... I don't know, sir.

365
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,997
Is it being prepared
to do the right thing?

366
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,790
Whatever the cost?

367
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,599
Isn't that what makes a man?

368
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,671
Sure, that
and a pair of testicles.

369
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,996
You're joking. But...

370
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,716
Perhaps you're right.

371
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,189
You mind if I do a "J"?

372
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,594
Bunny...

373
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,031
Excuse me?

374
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,554
Bunny Lebowski,

375
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,438
she is the light of my life.

376
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,512
Are you surprised
at my tears, sir?

377
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,276
Fuckin' A.

378
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,477
Strong men also cry.

379
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,555
Strong men also cry.

380
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,792
I received this fax
this morning.

381
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,276
As you can see,

382
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,316
it is a ransom note.

383
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,153
"We have Bunnie."

384
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,552
Sent by men who can't achieve
on a level field of play.

385
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,234
"Gather one million dollars

386
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,232
in unmarked,
non-consecutive twenties."

387
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,118
- Weaklings!
- "Await instructions."

388
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,918
- Bums!
- "No funny stuff."

389
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,356
- Bummer.
- Huh?

390
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,317
This is a bummer, man.

391
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,197
That's, uh, that's a bummer.

392
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,875
Brandt will
fill you in on the details.

393
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,557
Mr Lebowski will make you
a generous offer

394
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,519
to act as courier once we get
instructions for the money.

395
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,999
Why me, man?

396
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,038
He believes the culprits
might be the people

397
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,509
who, uh... soiled your rug,

398
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,991
and you're in a unique position
to confirm or disconfirm this.

399
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,275
He thinks
the carpet-pissers did this?

400
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,794
Well, Dude, we just don't know.

401
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,230
Fucking Quintana.

402
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,629
That creep can roll, man.

403
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,676
Yeah, but he's a pervert, Dude.

404
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,432
Yeah.

405
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,398
No. He's a sex offender
with a record.

406
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,916
He did six months for exposing
himself to an 8-year-old.

407
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,992
When he moved to Hollywood,
he had to go door-to-door

408
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,798
to tell everyone
he was a pederast.

409
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,155
What's a pederast, Walter?

410
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,595
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

411
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,036
- So... How much they give you?
- 20 grand, man.

412
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,715
- And I get to keep the rug.
- Just for making a hand-off?

413
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,916
Yeah. They gave Dude a beeper.

414
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,629
- So whenever they call...
- What if it's during a game?

415
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,474
- If it's during league play...
- What's during league play?

416
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,472
Life doesn't stop and start
at your convenience,

417
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,552
- you piece of shit.
- What's wrong with Walter?

418
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,200
I figure it's easy money.
It's harmless.

419
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,716
- She probably did it herself.
- What do you mean, Dude?

420
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,394
Rug pee-ers didn't do this.
Look at it.

421
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,268
A young trophy wife
marries this guy for his money.

422
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,669
She figures
he isn't giving her enough.

423
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,637
You know, she owes money.

424
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,315
- That fuckin'... bitch.
- It's all goddamn fake, man.

425
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,470
It's like Lenin said.

426
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,518
You look for the person
who will benefit,

427
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,637
- and, uh, you know...
- I am the walrus?

428
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,995
You know, you'll, uh...

429
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,594
- You know what I'm saying.
- I am the walrus.

430
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,432
That fuckin' bitch!

431
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,239
- I am the walrus.
- Shut the fuck up, Donny!

432
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,754
V.I. Lenin.
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

433
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,035
What the fuck
is he talking about?

434
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,032
Fucking exactly what happened.
That makes me sick.

435
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,714
- What do you care, Walter?
- Those rich fucks.

436
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,552
This whole fuckin' thing.

437
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,518
I didn't watch my buddies die
face-down in the mud

438
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,558
so that this fucking strumpet,
this fucking whore...

439
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,995
I don't see
any connection with Vietnam.

440
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,513
No literal connection.

441
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,433
Face it, there's no
connection. Your roll.

442
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,239
- But my point is...
- Your roll.

443
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,231
Are you ready to be fucked?

444
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,596
I see you roll your way
into the semis.

445
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,240
Dios mio, man.

446
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,278
Liam and me,
we're gonna fuck you up.

447
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,558
Yeah? Well... you know,
that's just like, uh...

448
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,517
your opinion, man.

449
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,033
Let me tell you
something, pendejo,

450
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,032
you pull any crazy shit with us,

451
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,395
you flash a piece out
on the lanes,

452
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,438
I'll take it
and stick it up your ass

453
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,557
and pull the fuckin' trigger
till it goes click.

454
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,068
- Jesus.
- You said it, man.

455
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,152
Nobody fucks with the Jesus.

456
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,831
8-year-olds, Dude.

457
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,119
Ohh, man.

458
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,597
They called 80 minutes ago.

459
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,353
Take the money,
drive north on the 405.

460
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,477
They will call you with
instructions in 40 minutes.

461
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,394
One person only. They were clear
on that, or I'd go with you.

462
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,119
- What happened to your jaw?
- Oh, nothin'.

463
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,155
Here's the money. And the phone.

464
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,834
Please, Dude,
follow their instructions.

465
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,319
All right.

466
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,836
- Her life is in your hands.
- Oh, man, don't say that.

467
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,831
Mr Lebowski asked me
to repeat that.

468
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,150
- Her life is in your hands.
- Shit, man.

469
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,992
Her life is in your hands, Dude.

470
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,913
Report back to us
as soon as it's done.

471
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,191
Where the fuck are you goin'?

472
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,157
Take the ringer. I'll drive.

473
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,800
- What? The what?
- The ringer.

474
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,757
The ringer, Dude.

475
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,995
- What the...
- Have they called?

476
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,072
- What the hell is this?
- My dirty undies, Dude.

477
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,628
Laundry. The whites.

478
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,315
I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies.

479
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,470
The weight.
The ringer cannot look empty.

480
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,312
What the fuck are you thinking?

481
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,675
You're right, Dude.
I got to thinking,

482
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,479
why should we settle for
a measly fuckin' 20 grand...

483
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,279
We? You said
you just wanted to come along.

484
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,669
Why should we settle
for 20 grand

485
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,320
when we can keep
the entire million? Am I wrong?

486
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,119
Yes, you're wrong.
This isn't a game, man.

487
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,430
It is a game.
You said so yourself.

488
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,080
- She kidnapped herself.
- I said I thought...

489
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,836
- Dude here.
- 'Who is this?'

490
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,390
Dude the bagman.
Where do you want us to go?

491
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,233
- 'Us? '
- Shit!

492
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,590
Yeah, you know,
me and the driver.

493
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,877
I'm not handling the money,
driving the car...

494
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,793
- 'Shut the fuck up! '
- Are you fucking this up?

495
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,871
Who is that?

496
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,394
That is the driver.
I told you...

497
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,429
- Shit!
- What the fuck's goin' on?

498
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,590
- Walter!
- What the fuck is goin' on?

499
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,877
He hung up! You fucked it up!
You fucked it up!

500
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,679
- Her life was in our hands.
- Easy, Dude.

501
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,035
We're screwed now.
We don't get shit.

502
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,953
They're gonna kill her.
We're fucked, Walter.

503
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,316
Nothing is fucked, Dude.
You're being very unDude.

504
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,630
They'll call back.
She kidnapped...

505
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,477
You see?
Nothing's fucked here, Dude.

506
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,869
They're a bunch
of fuckin' amateurs!

507
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,235
Hey, will you shut the fuck up?

508
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,118
Don't say peep
while I'm doin' business here.

509
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,430
OK, Dude, have it your way.

510
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,040
- But they're amateurs.
- Fuck.

511
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,111
- Dude.
- 'OK, we proceed,

512
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,270
'but only if there's
no funny stuff.'

513
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,157
Yeah, yeah.

514
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,196
'So no funny stuff, OK? '

515
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,840
Just tell me
where the fuck to go.

516
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,874
That was the sign, man.

517
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,032
So all we gotta do
is get her back.

518
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,237
No one can complain,
and we keep the baksheesh.

519
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,878
Terrific, Walter,

520
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,394
but how are we
gonna get her back?

521
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,391
That's the simple part, Dude.

522
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,109
We make the hand-off,
I grab one, beat it out of him.

523
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,351
- Huh?
- Yeah. That's a great plan.

524
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,716
That's fucking ingenious,
if I understand it correctly.

525
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,756
It's a Swiss fuckin' watch.

526
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,593
Yeah, the beauty
of this is its simplicity.

527
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,240
If it gets complex,
everything can go wrong.

528
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,311
If I learned one thing
in 'Nam, it's...

529
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,428
- Dude.
- 'You're coming to a bridge.

530
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,351
'When you cross the bridge,

531
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,638
'you throw the bag from the left
window. You're being watched.'

532
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,199
Fuck!

533
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,157
What'd he say?
Where's the hand-off?

534
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,550
There isn't one, we throw
the money out of the car.

535
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,030
We throw the money
out of the moving car!

536
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,351
We can't do that.
That fucks up our plan.

537
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,510
Call 'em and explain it to them.

538
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,673
You're plan is so simple
I'm sure they'll understand.

539
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,355
I'm throwin' the money, Walter.
We're not fuckin' around.

540
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,635
Bridge is comin' up.
Give me the ringer.

541
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,076
Fuck that. I love ya,
but you have to face the fact

542
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,754
- you're a goddamn moron.
- No time to argue.

543
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,432
- Hey, man.
- The bridge.

544
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,875
Hey, Walter! Hey! Walter!

545
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,076
There goes the ringer!

546
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,791
- What the fuck?
- Here, your wheel.

547
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,714
At 15 mph, I roll out,
grab one and beat it out of him.

548
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,552
- The Uzi.
- Uzi?

549
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,870
- I'm not rolling out naked.
- Walter, please!

550
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,757
15, Dude. This is it.

551
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,511
We have it! We have it!

552
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,513
We have it!

553
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,636
We... have it!

554
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,675
Aw, fuck it, Dude.

555
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,751
Let's go bowling.

556
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,272
Etz chaim he, Dude,
as the ex used to say.

557
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,316
What the fuck does that mean?

558
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,789
What the fuck
are we gonna tell Lebowski?

559
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,711
Huh? Oh, him. Uh...

560
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,070
Well, what exactly
is the problem?

561
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,116
The problem is...

562
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,395
What do you mean, what's the...

563
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,596
There was no...

564
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,114
We... we didn't, uh...

565
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,919
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

566
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,036
The poor woman...

567
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,590
That poor slut kidnapped
herself. You said so yourself.

568
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,148
I said I thought
she kidnapped herself.

569
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,471
- You're the one who's certain.
- 100% certain.

570
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,154
- They posted the next round.
- Shut the fuck...

571
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,708
- When do we play?
- This Saturday.

572
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,791
Saturday?
They have to reschedule.

573
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,472
What am I gonna tell Lebowski?

574
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,949
I told that fuck
at the league office...

575
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,600
- Who's in charge of scheduling?
- Burkhalter.

576
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,592
I told that kraut
I don't roll on Shabbos.

577
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,513
- He already posted it.
- He can fuckin' unpost it!

578
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,797
Who gives a shit?
They're gonna kill that woman.

579
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,871
What am I gonna tell Lebowski?

580
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,633
She'll get tired
of her game and go back.

581
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,109
- Why not on Saturday?
- I'm Shomer Shabbos.

582
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,838
What's that?

583
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,797
What do I tell Lebowski?

584
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,474
Saturday is Shabbos,
the Jewish day of rest.

585
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,120
I don't work,
I don't drive a car,

586
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,760
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven,

587
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,910
and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

588
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,712
Sheesh.

589
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,916
Shomer Shabbos!

590
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,912
- Walter, how am I gonna...
- Shomer fucking Shabbos.

591
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,390
- That's it! I'm outta here.
- Come on, Dude.

592
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,158
Dude! Dude!

593
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,231
Look, you just tell him...

594
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,357
Tell him we made the drop
and everything went...

595
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,954
- How'd it go?
- Went all right.

596
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,237
Walter, we didn't make
the fuckin' hand-off.

597
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,278
They didn't get the fuckin'
money! They're gonna...

598
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,831
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

599
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,753
If you can't go by car, how
do you get around on Shammos?

600
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,637
Really, Dude, you surprise me.

601
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,837
They're not gonna do shit.
What can they do to her?

602
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,239
They're amateurs, and meanwhile,

603
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,074
who's sittin' on a million
fucking dollars? Am I wrong?

604
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,917
Who's got a million
fuckin' dollars in our car?

605
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,592
Our car, Walter?

606
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,275
What do they got? My dirty
undies. My fuckin' whites.

607
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,710
Say, Dude...

608
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,598
where is your car?

609
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,352
Who's got your undies?

610
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,079
- Where's your car, Dude?
- You don't know?

611
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,199
It was parked in a handicap
zone. Perhaps they towed it.

612
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,039
You fuckin' know
it's been stolen.

613
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,874
Well, certainly,
that's a possibility, Dude.

614
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,630
Oh, fuck it.

615
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,390
- Where you goin', Dude?
- I'm going home, Donny.

616
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,552
- Phone's ringing, Dude.
- Thank you, Donny.

617
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,276
Uh... yeah...

618
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,508
Green... uh, some brown or...

619
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,875
rust colouration.

620
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,838
Was there anything
of value in the car?

621
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,593
Oh. Uh, yeah...

622
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,831
a tape deck,
some Creedence tapes,

623
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,150
and there was a... uh...

624
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,750
My briefcase.

625
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,511
In the briefcase?

626
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,674
Uh, papers.

627
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,751
You know, just papers.

628
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,037
You know, my papers.
Business papers.

629
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,751
And what do you do, sir?

630
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,637
I'm unemployed.

631
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,392
My rug was also stolen.

632
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,675
Your rug was in the car?

633
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,591
No, here.

634
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,910
Separate incidents?

635
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,439
'The Dude is not in... '

636
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,592
Do you find them much,
these stolen cars?

637
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,274
Sometimes.

638
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,035
- No hope for the tape deck.
- Or the Creedence.

639
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,476
Well, what about, uh...

640
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,152
The briefcase?

641
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,879
'Mr Lebowski,
I'd like to see you.

642
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,270
'My name is Maude Lebowski.
I'm the one who took your rug.'

643
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,269
Guess we can close
the file on that one.

644
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,190
Elfranco, ayúdame abajo.

645
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,398
I'll be with you
in a moment, Mr Lebowski.

646
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,708
Does the female form make you
uncomfortable, Mr Lebowski?

647
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,836
Is that what
this is a picture of?

648
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,433
In a sense, yes.

649
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,876
My art is strongly vaginal,
which bothers some men.

650
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,919
The word itself makes some
men uncomfortable. Vagina.

651
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,513
Oh, yeah?

652
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,876
They find it difficult to say,
but without batting an eye,

653
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,873
a man will refer to his dick
or his rod or his... johnson.

654
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,394
- Johnson?
- All right, Mr Lebowski.

655
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,198
Let's get down to cases.

656
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,555
My father agreed
to let you have the rug,

657
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,949
but it was a gift from me
to my late mother,

658
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,917
and not his to give. Now...

659
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,911
Your face.

660
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,389
As for this kidnapping...

661
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,473
I know all about it,
and that you acted as courier.

662
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,599
Let me tell you something.
It stinks to high heaven.

663
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,831
Right, but let me explain
something about the rug.

664
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,117
- Do you like sex, Mr Lebowski?
- Excuse me?

665
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,191
Sex. The physical act of love.

666
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,271
Coitus. Do you like it?

667
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,237
I was talking about my rug.

668
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,676
- You're not interested in sex?
- You mean coitus?

669
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,594
I like it. It's a myth about
feminists that we hate sex.

670
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,514
It can be a natural, zesty
enterprise. But some people -

671
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,194
satyriasis in men,
nymphomania in women -

672
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,840
engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

673
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,117
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, Mr Lebowski.

674
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,795
They cannot love
in the true sense of the word.

675
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,156
Our mutual acquaintance,
Bunny, is one of these.

676
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,117
Listen, Maude,

677
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,909
um, I'm sorry if your
stepmother is a nympho,

678
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,594
but what has that
to do with, uh...

679
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,275
- Do you have any Kahlua?
- Take a look at this, sir.

680
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,675
Oh, I know that guy.

681
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,236
He's a nihilist.

682
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,636
Karl Hungus...

683
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,880
- 'Hi.
- Hello. Meine dispatcher says

684
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,554
'there's something
wrong mit deine kabel.

685
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,757
'Come in. I'm not sure
exactly what's wrong.

686
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,434
'Zat's why they sent me.
I am an expert.

687
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,790
- 'The TV's in here.'
- You recognise her, of course.

688
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,757
'That's my friend. She came
over to use the shower.'

689
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,956
The story is ludicrous.

690
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,998
'Meine name is Karl.
Ich bin expert.'

691
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,877
'You're here to fix the cable.'

692
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,396
You can imagine
where it goes from here.

693
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,870
- He fixes the cable?
- Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

694
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,157
Little matter that she pursues
a career in pornography

695
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,390
nor that she's been
"banging" Jackie Treehorn,

696
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,789
to use the parlance
of our times.

697
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,589
But I am one of the two trustees
of the Lebowski Foundation,

698
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,477
the other being my father.

699
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,391
The Foundation
takes youngsters...

700
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,232
Shit, yeah, the achievers.

701
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,834
Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers, yes.

702
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,912
I asked my father about
his withdrawal of $1 million,

703
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,560
and he told me
about this abduction.

704
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,473
It is preposterous.
This compulsive fornicator

705
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,835
is taking my father
for the proverbial ride.

706
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,150
- But my...
- I'm getting to your rug.

707
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,037
My father and I don't get along.

708
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,237
We don't approve
of each other's lifestyles.

709
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,995
But I hardly wish to make his
embezzlement a police matter.

710
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,232
I propose that you try
to recover the money.

711
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,630
Well, I could do that.

712
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,553
If you do so,
I will compensate you

713
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,552
to the tune of 10%
of the recovered sum.

714
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,153
A hundred...

715
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,597
...thousand, yes, bones or clams
or whatever you call them.

716
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,229
Yeah, but...
what about my, uh...

717
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,278
Your rug. With that money
you can buy any rug

718
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,920
that doesn't have
sentimental value for me.

719
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,911
I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

720
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,560
Oh, that's fine.
That doesn't even, uh...

721
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,279
Here's the number of a doctor
who will look at it.

722
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,113
You'll receive no bill.
He's a good man.

723
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,919
- That's thoughtful, but...
- Please see him.

724
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,752
He's a good man.

725
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,074
Oh, well... all right.

726
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,075
He says, "My wife's a pain.

727
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,271
"She's always bustin'
my friggin' agates.

728
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,039
"My daughter's married
to a loser bastard,

729
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,714
"and I got a rash
so bad on my ass

730
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,475
"I can't sit down. But you
know me, can't complain."

731
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,597
Fuckin' A, man.
I got a rash, man.

732
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,352
Fuckin' A.

733
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,476
I gotta tell you, man,

734
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,916
earlier in the day,
I was feeling shitty, man.

735
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,592
Down in the dumps.

736
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,636
Lost a little money...

737
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,996
Hey, you know what?
Forget about it.

738
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,709
I can't be worried about
that shit. Life goes on, man.

739
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,677
Home, sweet home, Mr L.

740
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,835
Look. Who's your friend
in the Volkswagen?

741
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,313
Yeah, he followed us here.

742
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,551
When did he start foll...
What the fuck?

743
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,108
In the limo, you son of a bitch.
No arguing.

744
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,430
Careful, man.
There's a beverage here.

745
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,558
Start talking and talk fast,
you lousy bum.

746
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,949
We've been trying
to reach you, Dude.

747
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,759
Where's my goddamn money,
you bum?

748
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,637
W-well, we...

749
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,392
I don't...

750
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,517
They did not receive
the money, you nitwit!

751
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,229
- Her life was in your hands!
- This is our concern, Dude.

752
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,788
No, man, nothing is fucked here.

753
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,791
- Nothing is fucked?
- No, man.

754
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,952
The goddamn plane
has crashed into the mountain!

755
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,669
Come on, who are you gonna
believe, those guys or...

756
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,796
We dropped off the damn money.

757
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,711
We?

758
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,756
I.

759
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,389
The royal we.
You know, the editorial.

760
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,074
I dropped off the money
exactly as per...

761
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,469
I've got certain
information, all right?

762
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,154
Certain things
have come to light, and...

763
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,674
Has it ever occurred to you

764
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,799
that instead of,
you know, running around,

765
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,475
blaming me, given the nature
of all this new shit,

766
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,235
this could be a lot more...

767
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,231
Complex?

768
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,472
I mean, it might not be
such a simple, uh... you know?

769
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,518
What in God's name
are you blathering about?

770
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,910
I'll tell you
what I'm blathering about.

771
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,151
I've got information.
New shit has come to light.

772
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,356
And, shit, man...

773
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,990
She kidnapped herself.

774
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,952
Well, sure, man.

775
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,918
Look at it.
A young trophy wife,

776
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,150
in the parlance of our times.

777
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,152
She owes money all over town,

778
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,118
including to
known pornographers.

779
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,998
And that's cool. That's cool.

780
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,072
I'm saying she needs money, man.

781
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,310
And... and, you know,

782
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,312
of course they're gonna say
they didn't get it,

783
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,358
because she wants more, man.

784
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,637
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

785
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,829
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you, man? Sir?

786
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,595
No, Mr Lebowski,
it had not occurred to me.

787
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,036
That had not occurred
to us, Dude.

788
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,237
You guys aren't privy
to all the new shit, so...

789
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,436
you know. But...

790
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,671
Hey, that's what you pay me for.

791
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,392
Speaking of which,
do you think that you could...

792
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,516
give me my 20,000 in cash?

793
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,956
My concern is... and I gotta
check with my accountant...

794
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,679
but this might bump me
into a higher tax...

795
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,990
Brandt... Give him the envelope.

796
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,039
Oh, if you've already got the
cheque made out, that's cool00Oh

797
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,509
We received this this morning.

798
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,196
Since you have
failed to achieve,

799
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,556
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

800
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,235
since you have stolen my money,

801
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,357
since you have unrepentantly
betrayed my trust...

802
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,158
I have no choice

803
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:02,030
but to tell these bums
to do whatever is necessary

804
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:06,910
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

805
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,436
With Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this:

806
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:14,832
Any further harm
visited upon Bunny

807
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,276
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

808
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:25,515
By God, sir, I will not
abide another toe.

809
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,319
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

810
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,154
- Whose toe was it, Walter?
- How the fuck should I know?

811
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,708
Nothing about it indicates...

812
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,189
- The nail polish, Walter.
- Fine, Dude.

813
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:46,193
You can get nail polish and
apply it to someone else's toe.

814
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,191
Where the fuck
are they gonna get...

815
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,158
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.

816
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,310
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.

817
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,470
You don't wanna know about it.

818
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:59,269
I can get you a toe
by 3 pm, with nail polish.

819
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,238
These fuckin' amateurs.
They send us a toe,

820
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,756
we're supposed to shit ourselves
with fear. Jesus Christ!

821
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,798
They're gonna kill her
and then me.

822
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,111
Dude... that's...

823
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,998
That's just
the stress talking, man.

824
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,196
We have what appears to me

825
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,840
to be a series
of victimless crimes.

826
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,072
- What about the toe?
- Forget about the fucking toe!

827
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,232
Could you keep your voices down?
This is a family restaurant.

828
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,470
Dear, for your information,

829
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,870
the Supreme Court
has rejected prior restraint!

830
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,678
This is not
a First Amendment thing.

831
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,797
If you don't calm down,
you'll have to leave.

832
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,031
Lady, my buddies died
face-down in the muck

833
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,953
so we could enjoy
this family restaurant!

834
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,679
- I'm outta here.
- Dude, don't go away, man.

835
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,557
This affects all of us.

836
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,392
There are basic freedoms!

837
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,995
I'm stayin'.

838
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,191
I'm finishing my coffee.

839
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,760
Enjoying my coffee.

840
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,152
'The Dude is not in.

841
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,073
'Leave a message after the beep.
Thanks, man.'

842
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,711
'Mr Lebowski, this is duty
officer Rolvaag of the LAPD.

843
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,950
'We've recovered
your automobile.

844
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,996
'It can be claimed at... '

845
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,799
Far out, man. Far fucking out!

846
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,517
Hey! This is
a private residence, man.

847
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,150
Ah, nice marmot.

848
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:16,713
Vere is the money, Lebowski.
Ve vant the money, Lebowski.

849
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,399
You zink ve are kidding
or making with the funny stuff?

850
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,119
Things you haven't
dreamed of, Lebowski.

851
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,919
Ve believes in nossing,
Lebowski, nossing.

852
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,753
Ve come back
and ve cut off your chonson.

853
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,273
Excuse me?

854
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,193
I said we'll
cut off your johnson!

855
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,111
Just think about that, Lebowski.

856
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,031
Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.

857
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,793
Maybe we stomp on it
and sqoosh it, Lebowski.

858
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,671
It was discovered last night

859
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,832
- lodged against an abutment.
- Oh, man, lodged where?

860
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,957
You're lucky she didn't
get chopped, Mr Lebowski.

861
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,837
A joyride situation.

862
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,673
They abandon the vehicle
once they hit the wall.

863
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,991
My fucking briefcase!
Man, it's not here. Shit!

864
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,752
I saw the report. Sorry.

865
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,229
You gotta get in
on the other side.

866
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,677
The side-view was found
on the road by the car.

867
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,469
You're lucky they left the
tape deck, and the Creedence.

868
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,950
Aw, Jesus!
What's that smell, man?

869
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,759
Probably a vagrant
slept in the car

870
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,831
or just used it as a toilet.

871
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,150
Hey, man...

872
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,073
Are you gonna find
these guys, you know...

873
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,277
I mean, you got any
promising, uh, leads or...

874
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,352
Leads? Yeah, sure.

875
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,319
I'll just check with the boys
down at the crime lab.

876
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,597
They got four more detectives
working on the case.

877
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,989
They got us working in shifts.

878
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,551
Leads?

879
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,631
I hope the big Lebowski kills me

880
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,996
before the Germans
can cut my dick off.

881
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,711
That is just ridiculous, Dude.
No one'll cut your dick off.

882
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,593
- Thank you.
- Not if I have anything to say.

883
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,148
- That makes me feel secure.
- Dude.

884
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,959
- It makes me feel warm inside.
- Now, Dude.

885
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,190
This whole fuckin' thing.

886
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,558
I could be sitting here
with just pee stains on my rug.

887
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,473
- But, no, man, I gotta...
- Fucking Germans.

888
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,472
Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.

889
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,790
They were Nazis, Dude?

890
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,872
Come on, Donny, they
were threatening castration.

891
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,916
- Are we gonna split hairs?
- No.

892
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,911
- Am I wrong?
- Well, he...

893
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,592
They were nihilists, man.

894
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,035
They kept saying
they believed in nothing.

895
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,680
Nihilists.

896
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,149
Fuck me.

897
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,515
Say what you want about the
tenets of national socialism,

898
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,716
at least it's an ethos.

899
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,439
And also,
let's not forget, Dude,

900
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,830
that keeping wildlife,
an amphibious rodent

901
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,480
for, you know, domestic...

902
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,437
within the city...

903
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,397
That ain't legal either.

904
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,597
- Are you a fucking park ranger?
- No, I'm just...

905
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,592
Who gives a shit
about the fucking marmot?

906
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,797
- We are sympathising, Dude.
- Fuck sympathy.

907
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,759
I don't need your fucking
sympathy. I need my johnson.

908
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:23,071
- What do you need that for?
- You've got to buck up!

909
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,470
You cannot drag this negative
energy into the tournament.

910
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,518
Fuck the tournament.
Fuck you, Walter.

911
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,433
Fuck the tournament?

912
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,229
OK, Dude. I can see you
don't want to be cheered up.

913
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,517
Come on, Donny.
Let's go get us a lane.

914
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,157
- Another Caucasian, Gary.
- Right, Dude.

915
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,235
Friends like these,
huh, Gary?

916
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,311
That's right, Dude.

917
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,473
Do you have a good Sarsaparilla?
