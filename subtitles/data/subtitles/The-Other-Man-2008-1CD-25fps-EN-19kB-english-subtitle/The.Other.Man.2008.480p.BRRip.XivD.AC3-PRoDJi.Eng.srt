1
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,640
That's good.

2
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,920
Congratulations.

3
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,000
Shoes were really superb.

4
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

5
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,640
My pleasure.

6
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,080
Um, I'm off, Dad.

7
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,120
Excuse me.

8
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,160
<i>Is it to do with George?</i>

9
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,880
It always is.

10
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,840
Hey, hi.

11
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,480
Oh, my!

12
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,560
<i>How are you?</i>

13
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,600
How lovely to see you.

14
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,800
<i>Are you happy with your mother?</i>

15
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,400
Of course I am.

16
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,040
Thanks, Mom.

17
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,840
Tell George I'm sorry
he couldn't make it.

18
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,800
I will, I will.

19
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,080
Wonderful.

20
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,120
<i>How was it?</i>

21
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,360
Shoes were lovely, of course.

22
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,560
Dresses like handkerchiefs,
girls like stick insects.

23
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,000
<i>It's not catching, is it?</i>

24
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,400
Come on.

25
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,800
I should get you a jacket like that.

26
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,880
Hey, Peter.

27
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,160
<i>Eleanor, how are you?</i>

28
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
<i>You know Ralph?</i>

29
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,160
Yes, I know Ralph.

30
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,040
Can I just have a shot of you with...

31
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,240
I'll grab the table.

32
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,240
There she is.

33
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,280
Hi, oh.

34
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,320
I'm starving.

35
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,400
<i>Yeah?</i>

36
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,440
<i>It was all right, wasn't it?</i>

37
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,480
It was great.

38
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,240
Oh, shut up.

39
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,200
All right, I will.

40
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,040
Abigail fled.

41
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,080
Honestly, the two of you.

42
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,400
<i>What?</i>

43
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,840
I've got a daughter who
flees, a husband who jeers.

44
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,880
Oh, Lisa, come on.

45
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,920
I don't jeer.

46
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,080
I like your shoes.

47
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,680
It's the people in them I can't stand.

48
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,320
Oh, well.

49
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,200
Fish cakes.

50
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,800
Well, you won't get them in Milan.

51
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,560
<i>It is Milan, right?</i>

52
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,800
Gianni and Gianni.

53
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,520
<i>Which is the one who
still lives with his mum?</i>

54
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,000
Gianni, of course.

55
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,440
Actually, they both do.

56
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,120
A very old lady in black who hovers.

57
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,480
They make wonderful shoes.

58
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,680
Hey.

59
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,840
You make wonderful shoes.

60
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,880
Do you think two people

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,560
<i>...can live together all their lives?</i>

62
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,080
- Well, we've managed
more than half our lives.

63
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,160
<i>Do we have a problem?</i>

64
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,120
Of course we don't have a problem.

65
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,760
<i>Is that the problem?</i>

66
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,800
<i>Eh?</i>

67
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,480
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

68
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,520
Thinking.

69
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,960
Abigail, George.

70
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,160
<i>Will she get married?</i>

71
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,200
Abigail.

72
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,760
<i>What?</i>

73
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,920
Well, you know.

74
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,880
<i>Are you jealous?</i>

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,880
<i>What, of George?</i>

76
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
I think I like George.

77
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,560
- Well, you have a
strange taste in men.

78
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,440
We're not quite ready yet.

79
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,920
I'll come back.

80
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,640
- Do you never wish you
might be given the chance

81
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,840
<i>...to sleep with someone else?</i>

82
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,920
<i>Lisa, are you telling me something?</i>

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,680
I'm asking.

84
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,880
<i>Well?</i>

85
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,160
<i>Peter?</i>

86
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,320
No, I mean, no.

87
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,520
I don't want to sleep with someone else.

88
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,680
Maybe I haven't found
the right person yet.

89
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,200
No, never.

90
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
I promise.

91
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,680
It's a choice, not a promise.

92
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,080
You meet someone; you fall in love.

93
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,560
You have the opportunity.

94
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,240
You make a choice.

95
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,080
I chose you.

96
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,040
I do love you, you know.

97
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,440
<i>You do know that, don't you?</i>

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,560
If I didn't, I'd go.

99
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,600
<i>Go?</i>

100
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,840
Yes, just go, taking nothing,

101
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,000
...bare, start again.

102
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,840
Oh, that's all right then.

103
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,600
I need to tell you something.

104
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
No, don't move.

105
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,280
Don't move.

106
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,960
<i>Hmm?</i>

107
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,760
I don't want to worry you.

108
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,920
<i>Why would you?</i>

109
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,480
<i>What is it, Lisa?</i>

110
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,560
Nothing.

111
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Nothing, I'm fine.

112
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,160
<i>You sure?</i>

113
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,200
I'm sure.

114
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,240
I'm fine.

115
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,480
<i>Milan?</i>

116
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,560
The Giannis.

117
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,520
I told you.

118
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,920
Honestly, I'll ring.

119
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,840
<i>Dad?</i>

120
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,320
Upstairs.

121
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,240
Here, have them.

122
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,280
<i>Why?</i>

123
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,960
I don't want them.

124
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't want her stuff, Dad.

125
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,120
I don't want her things around.

126
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,160
You take them.

127
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,240
I know we're the same size.

128
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,560
It's just, it might be weird.

129
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,520
I don't know.

130
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,800
I wouldn't be happy having her stuff.

131
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,880
Mum's phone.

132
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,640
<i>Not Mum?</i>

133
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,960
Funny.

134
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,440
- You've always been like
this, even when I was little.

135
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,680
I remember I wrote you a story.

136
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,920
It was about a bear.

137
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,200
And I gave it to you, and you took it,

138
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,080
...and then you just went back
to what you were working on.

139
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,120
I'm talking, and you're not
even pretending to listen.

140
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,400
And I'm only talking so I don't
have to listen to your silences

141
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,640
...and not because
I think for one minute

142
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,280
...you'll take any notice
of what it is I have to say.

143
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,080
Mum asked me to put this here for you.

144
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,200
<i>What was that about?</i>

145
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,720
<i>Earth to Dad?</i>

146
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,680
<i>Dad?</i>

147
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,200
<i>Is that where she's gone, into orbit?</i>

148
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,760
You have one new message.

149
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,640
I just want to hear your voice.

150
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,960
That's all.

151
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,080
It's been so long.

152
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,880
I know I am wrong to ring you,
but I want to hear your voice.

153
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,000
I just want to hear your voice.

154
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,280
That's all.

155
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,280
It's been so long.

156
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,560
I know I am wrong to ring you,
but I want to hear your voice.

157
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,720
<i>You know Ralph?</i>

158
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,120
Hello, Mr. Ryman.

159
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,280
<i>Peter, how are you, dear?</i>

160
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,520
You know Eleanor.
- Hello, Peter.

161
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,600
<i>Did you know?</i>

162
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,640
<i>What?</i>

163
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,800
<i>Did you know about them?</i>

164
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,840
<i>Peter?</i>

165
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,560
Ralph.

166
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,600
<i>How long has it been going on?</i>

167
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,640
<i>Peter, are you all right?</i>

168
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,360
I should smash your fucking
computer over your fucking head.

169
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,640
<i>- Peter.
- What are you talking about?</i>

170
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,720
Lisa.

171
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,960
<i>Have you always been fond of her?</i>

172
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,320
- Of course.
- Uh-huh.

173
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,520
<i>And was she fond of you?</i>

174
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,200
I think so.

175
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,920
<i>But not like that.</i>

176
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,240
You can't believe we've
been having an affair.

177
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,880
Peter, that's not on.

178
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,520
And if she...

179
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,600
<i>...well, I couldn't blame her, eh?</i>

180
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,760
Ralph.

181
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,280
You know, I never
could for the life of me

182
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,800
...understand what she saw in you.

183
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,960
I don't see why I should be insulted.

184
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,040
I don't see why.

185
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,840
Peter,

186
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,800
...there is somebody.

187
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,120
She did have a friend.

188
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
We know nothing more.

189
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,000
Really, Peter.

190
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,120
<i>Who is he?</i>

191
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,200
<i>Why does there have
to be anyone else?</i>

192
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,360
<i>Because people always love her?</i>

193
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,400
- Abi...
- No.

194
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
You should be ashamed,

195
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,960
...asking things like that about Mum,

196
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
...ashamed.

197
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,440
<i>Everything all right?</i>

198
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,520
I'll see you in a minute.

199
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,560
Okay.

200
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,960
It was just the two
of us in Italy, Dad.

201
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,440
And we didn't go to Lake Como.

202
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,520
We went to Venice.

203
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,160
Here.

204
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,040
When I've washed my face,
you can use the bathroom.

205
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,840
We get up at 6:30,

206
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,840
'cause George goes to
work early, and so do I.

207
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,880
I'll wake you for breakfast.

208
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,960
Abi...

209
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,920
'Night.

210
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,080
<i>Dad?</i>

211
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,280
Morning, Peter.

212
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Hello, Mr. Ryman.

213
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,520
- Peter...
- Thanks, Gail.

214
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,720
<i>Peter?</i>

215
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,200
Peter.

216
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,560
Ralph.

217
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,000
It's Guy.

218
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,600
Ralph.

219
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,360
<i>Me?</i>

220
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,040
No, I wasn't thinking of you, Guy.

221
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,160
Well, it's good to see you back.

222
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,320
Look, I don't need to
bury myself, you know,

223
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,400
...or anything.

224
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,640
<i>Oh, who said you did?</i>

225
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,480
If you'd rather be at home, Peter,

226
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,520
...you're the boss.

227
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,600
We can manage.

228
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,440
<i>Do you have trouble with
badgers in your lawn, Guy?</i>

229
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,520
I can't stand them.

230
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,760
I want to kill the bastards.

231
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,480
<i>Could you get me Joy, please?</i>

232
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,800
We have two Joys, Peter.

233
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
Security Joy and Systems Joy.

234
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,960
Security.

235
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,000
Peter...

236
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,280
I don't want to be rude, Guy, but...

237
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,480
Well, if you need me.

238
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,440
Thank you.

239
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,520
Sit down, Joy.

240
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,320
I'm sorry about the ID contract.

241
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,720
I was always anxious about
it being rolled out before...

242
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,920
I have an email address,

243
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,600
...and I want an identity, Joy.

244
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,640
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

245
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,240
I want to know who he is,
where in the world he lives.

246
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,000
That's not legal, you know, Peter.

247
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,200
Then don't do it.

248
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,400
I won't.

249
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,120
I've never done it.

250
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,040
No, but you know what we do.

251
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,440
Hope to catch a data
package on one of its hops.

252
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,400
Get the IP fingerprints.

253
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,560
Try an SMTP connector to the server

254
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,840
...and request it takes a mail
for your guy's email address

255
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,800
...using VRFY and EXPN options.

256
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,720
Might get lucky.

257
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,920
It does rely on the server
being poorly configured,

258
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,200
<i>...but doesn't everything?</i>

259
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,640
Mm-hmm.

260
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,320
<i>So what do we know?</i>

261
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,200
He calls himself Ralph.

262
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,400
<i>Yes?</i>

263
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,880
I want to meet him.

264
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,520
I want to kill him.

265
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,760
<i>Who pays for the software?</i>

266
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,800
I do.

267
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,280
Not the firm.

268
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,600
Well, that's fine.

269
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,360
He mustn't know
you're looking for him.

270
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,160
I want it to be a big surprise.

271
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,320
Ah.

272
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,400
<i>"What's this rubbish
about our love having gone?</i>

273
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,440
"It's easy to say but can't be done.

274
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,440
"The past is still
very much alive for us.

275
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,840
"Your message has made me very happy.

276
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,440
Ralph."

277
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,440
"To say but can't be done,

278
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,280
"because the past is still
very much alive for us.

279

00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,920
Ralph."

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,480
Your message has made me"...

284
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,120
<i>You all right, Peter?</i>

285
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,640
You've been a cop, Eric.

286
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,760
<i>Where do I get a gun?</i>

287
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,800
<i>A gun?</i>

288
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,520
Yeah.

289
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,600
Well, you don't.

290
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,560
You don't want to think like that.

291
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,480
He wants me to get him a gun.

292
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,400
Don't be silly, Eric.

293
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,120
<i>Gail?</i>

294
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,680
<i>Could you get me a
flight to Milan tonight?</i>

295
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,440
Lisa's hotel... I
can't remember its name.

296
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,160
Oh, Peter.

297
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,600
Peter, Eric says...

298
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,040
Book it.

299
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,080
Please, Gail.

300
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,120
<i>Buona sera, signore.</i>

301
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,640
Mama!

302
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,600
If you want to leave a
message for Peter or Lisa,

303
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,920
...please speak after the beep.

304
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Beep!

305
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,440
<i>Dad, are you there?</i>

306
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,480
<i>Dad?</i>

307
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,160
Call me.

308
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,080
I don't know what you're up to.

309
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,200
<i>Campione del mondo, eh!</i>

310
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,520
<i>Ti faccio vedere io.</i>

311
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,680
<i>Bravo, bravo.</i>

312
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,000
<i>Grazie.</i>

313
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,760
<i>Scusi, signore.</i>

314
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,920
Excuse me.

315
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,400
Hmm.

316
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,520
I could never leave you.

317
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,480
<i>Why would you?</i>

318
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,240
Mm.

319
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,600
<i>Buon giorno, signore.</i>

320
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,200
<i>Come sta, Eduido?</i>

321
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,880
<i>Uh, e questa vostra tavola?</i>

322
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,280
<i>English?</i>

323
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
No, no, no, no.

324
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,440
Please.

325
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,600
Excuse me.

326
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,760
<i>That is the Queen's
Indian Defense, right?</i>

327
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,400
Yes, it is.

328
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,560
Love it.

329
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,440
Black is going to have
to sacrifice his queen.

330
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,200
But that's how it happens

331
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,440
...if you field the
Queen's Indian Defense.

332
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,040
There she goes.

333
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,640
Peter.

334
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,440
Uh, Ralph.

335
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,480
<i>Ralph?</i>

336
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,360
Another chess nut.

337
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,200
<i>Shall we play the game out?</i>

338
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,240
Please.

339
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,320
Good.

340
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,680
Thank you.

341
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,400
All right.

342
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,680
Here we go.

343
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,280
<i>Ralph, that's R-A-L-P-H, right?</i>

344
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,280
Of course, sir.

345
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,880
Father is Spanish, Mother English.

346
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,080
So it was not Raf-e, but Ralph,

347
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,760
...spelled R-A-L-P-H, of course.

348
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,800
She liked things to be
punctiliously correct,

349
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,480
...my mother.

350
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,120
She had her ups and downs,

351
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,840
...mostly down.

352
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,040
<i>Why Milan, of all places?</i>

353
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,920
I am a cosmopolitan.

354
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,200
I am not one for the same
place, same thing, day after day.

355
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,240
<i>Who is?</i>

356
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,320
<i>You?</i>

357
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,800
No.

358
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,040
I've traveled a fair bit on and off.

359
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,360
I enjoy London...

360
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,800
New York, never had much
time to get to know Australia,

361
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,760
...but I have, as it were,
circulated everywhere civilized.

362
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,960
Yes.

363
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,520
<i>England, Oxford, Cambridge?</i>

364
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,320
Cambridge.

365
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,480
Girlfriend I met here
lived in Cambridge,

366
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,600
...when I dabbled in
the fashion business.

367
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,920
She was in shoes.

368
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,960
Shoes.

369
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,280
When I say "shoes,"

370
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,920
...it is as if I say
Baryshnikov is a hoofer.

371
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,200
Yes.

372
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,720
It was here, in Milan.

373
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,920
I saw these red high heels.

374
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,560
And I saw this woman.

375
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,640
She was walking towards me.

376
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,240
And for a while... this
didn't seem credible,

377
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,040
...but all I saw was the shoes.

378
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,800
I make shoes.

379
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,720
<i>You?</i>

380
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:06,160
Uh, I'm interested in
poetry, and therefore, feet.

381
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,720
<i>Was this a long time ago?</i>

382
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,640
Oh, yes.

383
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,640
10... no, 12, 12 years.

384
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,040
<i>And when was the
last time you saw her?</i>

385
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,440
Actually, uh, nine months.

386
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,720
Yes.

387
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,520
But I have good reason

388
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,320
...for hoping to see her again soon.

389
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,280
Check.

390
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,880
<i>Dad?</i>

391
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,880
<i>Peter?</i>

392
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,480
<i>Peter?</i>

393
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,400
<i>Hello?</i>

394
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,720
Beep!

395
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,280
You have one new message.

396
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,360
Lisa, please, let me
hear your voice again.

397
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,520
I know I swore I wouldn't ring you,

398
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,440
...but your emails made me
desperate to hear your voice.

399
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,040
Call me, please.

400
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,040
Bye.

401
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,040
<i>What do you do in
Milan with those Giannis?</i>

402
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,080
Made me jump.

403
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,520
<i>Eh?</i>

404
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,480
Trade fair.

405
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,520
It's hell.

406
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,120
<i>Expect me to feel sorry for you?</i>

407
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,880
Mm-hmm.

408
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,680
<i>Do you desperately want to do that?</i>

409
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,120
<i>Was she often in Milan, your friend?</i>

410
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,280
Oh, yes.

411
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,720
I will make things easy for you,

412
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,640
...but don't doubt my
love because of that.

413
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,000
She would try to elude me.

414
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,040
I'd like to...

415
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,120
I'd like it to be that
things were different.

416
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,200
I know.

417
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,960
I was very persistent.

418
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,960
Yes, you know.

419
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,360
I mean, if we could be
together, live for one another,

420
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,120
...let nothing else matter.

421
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,560
But our world isn't like that.

422
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,640
Lisa...

423
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,680
No, I know.

424
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,080
Don't keep saying "I know."

425
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,520
- I know.
- I know.

426
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,600
I know.
- I know.

427
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,720
I know; I know.

428
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,160
I know; I know.

429
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,200
I know; I know.

430
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,800
I know.

431
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,880
I know.

432
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,920
I know.

433
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,840
<i>Oh, grazie.</i>

434
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,840
You gave me a shock.

435
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,280
I heard you coming.

436
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,840
<i>How was Milan?</i>

437
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,800
Lovely.

438
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,320
Fun.

439
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,480
<i>Everything all right?</i>

440
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,560
Yeah, of course.

441
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,360
I'm so happy to see you.

442
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,480
Hmm.

443
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,520
You meet someone; you fall in love.

444
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,600
You have the opportunity.

445
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,040
You make a choice.

446
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,360
<i>Lisa?</i>

447
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,240
<i>Ever had a woman you'd
like to live with?</i>

448
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,480
Plenty of women
desperate to live with me,

449
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,560
...but I don't live with anyone.

450
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,920
See them, yeah, often
for lengthy periods,

451
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,600
...but not live.

452
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,640
<i>Are you married?</i>

453
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,800
We have a daughter.

454
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,960
I have a son.

455
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,040
Hmm.

456
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,560
<i>Married long?</i>

457
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,720
Nearly 25 years.

458
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:55,040
We've both had separate careers
with all that that means.

459
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,560
Oh.

460
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,640
We've had a good marriage,

461
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,920
...always trusted each
other, never doubted.

462
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,120
Oh, well, that's fine, very good.

463
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,120
Grand, but not for me.

464
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,320
There's always doubt, my friend.

465
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,240
Marriage is hell, as I
am sure you have found.

466
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:16,120
I prefer hotels and heaven.

467
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,600
Come and see.

468
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:30,200
I kept it for you.

469
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,640
You have a bad bishop.

470
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,320
And I have a good one.

471
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,640
You swine, Ralph.

472
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,840
Excuse me.

473
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,320
Forgive me.

474
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,680
We Spanish are passionate people.

475
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,640
You do have a good one.

476
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,040
But check.

477
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,280
Unless you can swindle, cheat.

478
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,320
Not my game.

479
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,640
I haven't a spiteful bone in my body.

480
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,680
Excuse me.

481
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,560
<i>Lisa?</i>

482
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,240
<i>Lisa?</i>

483
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,040
I know you...

484
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,960
I know you are there, Lisa.

485
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,040
Answer me.

486
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,480
I know you are there.

487
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,480
Lisa, your emails.

488
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,960
Answer me.

489
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,920
I know you are there, Lisa.

490
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,240
Speak to me.

491
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,240
Let me hear your voice.

492
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,640
Darling, come on, speak to me.

493
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,360
<i>Lisa?</i>

494
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,160
Answer me.

495
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,200
Answer me.

496
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,800
I know you are there.

497
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,000
<i>Lisa?</i>

498
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,280
Darling, speak to me.

499
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,920
Lisa!

500
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,600
My love, the passion I give you

501
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,360
...can't be without you any
more than you can be without me.

502
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,040
If you leave me, I'll crash.

503
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,760
You frighten me.

504
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,960
I will.

505
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,200
Don't let it come to that.

506
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:02,680
<i>What else can I do?</i>

507
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,600
<i>Who are you happiest with?</i>

508
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,680
<i>Now?</i>

509
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,640
This moment.

510
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,040
You.

511
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,880
Soon I will be happy with another.

512
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,920
<i>Him?</i>

513
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,000
Of course him.

514
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,680
Excuse me.

515
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,160
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

516
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,080
I got a call yesterday.

517
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,960
It was a call from the shoe designer.

518
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,520
I can only describe her to you

519
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,640
...as the most beautiful
woman in the world.

520
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,800
I do now know she is

521
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,200
...the only woman I could ever love.

522
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,600
Check.

523
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,720
<i>She... she has rung you, has she?</i>

524
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,800
She has.

525
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,840
<i>You spoke to her?</i>

526
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,920
She has acknowledged my call.

527
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,200
<i>Do you ride?</i>

528
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,320
You know, with horses as with women...

529
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,880
...and of course, you know that.

530
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,720
But to have good hands is essential.

531
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,640
Checkmate.

532
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,880
<i>You bastard; how dare you?</i>

533
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,160
It's only a game
of fucking chess, man.

534
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,200
Oh, Lord.

535
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,680
3:00, I must fly.

536
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,760
<i>If you spoke to
her, what did she say?</i>

537
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:39,920
Dad.

538
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,160
Abigail.

539
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,600
We wondered where you were.

540
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,720
<i>Is George here?</i>

541
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,960
No, no, he's not.

542
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,240
<i>- Come on.
- Where are we going?</i>

543
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,280
<i>How to tell you?</i>

544
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,360
I've talked to him.

545
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,520
<i>What?</i>

546
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,600
Her lover.

547
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,640
<i>Huh? How?</i>

548
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,480
Not really talk to him;
I didn't say anything.

549
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,560
Mum's phone.

550
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,960
<i>I used ring back.
- Did you?</i>

551
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,080
Oh, of course you did.

552
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,680
Yeah, I talk to him every day.

553
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,920
We play chess together.

554
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,600
<i>What?</i>

555
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,440
He doesn't know who I am.

556
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,760
He's monstrous.

557
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,120
His hands in particular revolt me.

558
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,160
Pink hands!

559
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,240
I really don't want to know.

560
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,200
It's not the same for you.

561
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,520
He doesn't have horrible hands.

562
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,720
Oh, read his emails, here.

563
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,720
Oh, Dad.

564
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,480
Listen.

565
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:37,320
"I didn't touch you until you
put your arms around my neck

566
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,360
"on our first night.

567
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,000
<i>Don't you remember?"</i>

568
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,280
We never spent days and
nights in bed together.

569
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,680
"It was cold,

570
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,400
"so cold you didn't want to come out.

571
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,040
"And so I sat up and leaned across you

572
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,240
"and turned out the light on your side.

573
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,000
"And then you finally took
your arms from under the blanket

574
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,400
"and took me to you.

575
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,800
"I don't dare ask to see you again,

576
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,280
"but you should know I
would like that very much.

577
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,360
Ralph."

578
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,520
He calls himself Ralph.

579
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,040
He says things like

580
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,240
"the most beautiful woman in the world"

581
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,440
...in his well-pressed jeans,

582
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,000
...yellow socks, sacred Gucci loafers.

583
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,400
Fucking prick!

584
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,480
Gucci loafers!

585
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,160
<i>Have you been replying to him?</i>

586
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,360
<i>Hmm?</i>

587
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,440
He thinks she is.

588
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,360
Oh, no.

589
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,080
Oh, Dad, please.

590
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,240
<i>Just leave it, yeah?</i>

591
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,680
He says things like "took me to you."

592
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,840
<i>What was she thinking of?</i>

593
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,720
<i>What sort of woman would
believe that sort of crap?</i>

594
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,240
<i>How could she?</i>

595
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,280
Don't cry.

596
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,360
I'm not crying.

597
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,320
I wasn't enough for her.

598
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,560
I'm so bloody angry, I could kill him.

599
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,520
I was always faithful to her.

600
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,880
I thought we were close.

601
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,560
I thought we told each other everything.

602
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,120
But she was a different person.

603
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,200
She must have been.

604
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,520
Which is worse, that the
person you love is someone else

605
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,280
<i>...with another man, or
that they're the same?</i>

606
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,640
Please, Dad.

607
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,760
Please stop it.

608
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,320
It's so bloody insulting.

609
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,240
I can't take it anymore!

610
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,120
Just let it go!

611
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:15,840
I sat up and leaned across
you and turned out the light.

612
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:21,640
And then you finally took your
arms from under the blanket

613
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,720
...and took me to you.

614
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,920
You s... you scared me.

615
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,200
Yes, yes, I'm sure.

616
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,240
Yes.

617
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,320
You...

618
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,160
I wasn't, uh...

619
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,400
...you'll love this.

620
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,560
This is just... what
I am doing down here

621
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,400
...is just taking care
of the house tortoise.

622
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,560
<i>How do you say that in English?</i>

623
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,600
Tort... tort...

624
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,000
<i>Tortoise?</i>

625
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,680
<i>What? Tortoises.</i>

626
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,880
Tortoises, tortoises.

627
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,960
<i>You like tortoises?</i>

628
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,240
Don't touch me, please.

629
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,560
I don't blame you, messy business.

630
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,640
Come here.

631
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,960
Come here.

632
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,160
Ah, come here.

633
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,360
You know, when the old girl
started digging in the dirt...

634
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,520
...watch this...

635
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,480
I thought of everything

636
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,520
...except that she
might be burying eggs.

637
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,440
But that's what she
was doing, three eggs.

638
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,800
But she was... three.

639
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,560
So I moved it down here,

640
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,880
...and tiny little
tortoises hatched from two.

641
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,840
<i>Are you all right?</i>

642
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,920
<i>Tartaruga, the Italians call them.</i>

643
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,960
Two of them hatched out,

644
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,960
...but I lost one.

645
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,600
And I am sad to say, you
know, she went down the pan.

646
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,520
Sentimental sod.

647
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,600
Bastard!

648
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,720
<i>How dare he?</i>

649
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,680
I'll pay.

650
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,680
I'll pay him. I'll pay you.

651
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,760
I'll pay you.

652
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,000
I will pay you.

653
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,040
<i>What are you doing?</i>

654
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,440
I've just got time to get my flight.

655
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,480
None of this you're doing is right, Dad.

656
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,240
It's making you ill, and
it's making you awful.

657
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,280
<i>You're not stable, yeah?</i>

658
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,360
It's over.

659
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,680
Just let it go.

660
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,720
Move on.

661
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,760
No, Abi, sorry.

662
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,360
She's gone.

663
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,320
<i>Vai, vai, aeroporto.</i>

664
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:35,960
<i>Hello?</i>

665
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,520
Hey, Peter, I have a little problem.

666
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:44,160
Let me give you lunch tomorrow.

667
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,200
<i>Shall we meet at my apartment?</i>

668
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,640
<i>Buon giorno?</i>

669
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,360
Peter.

670
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,560
Come on up to my apartment.

671
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,320
<i>Your apartment?</i>

672
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,960
Come on.

673
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,600
Is this...

674
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,200
When I am in town, yes.

675
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,280
Hey, I've had some very exciting news,

676
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,640
...though it's rather hush-hush
from the fear of publicity.

677
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:38,320
She wants me to go to spend a
weekend with her in Lake Como,

678
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:46,000
...our usual hotel, my friend,
the celebrated shoe designer.

679
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,760
Um, it's nice.

680
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,760
You know, I was thinking, you know me,

681
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:58,080
...a second honeymoon in
Lake Como sort of thing.

682
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,880
And then we'd both go to London.

683
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,920
Well, to be honest,

684
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,000
...things are becoming
a little hot for me here,

685
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,360
...you know, the usual
temporary cash-flow problems.

686
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,840
I was thinking about
throwing her a surprise party.

687
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,280
You know, push the boat in

688
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,240
...and mark the beginning
of our life together.

689
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,360
<i>London?</i>

690
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,440
A celebration, but...

691
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,680
No, no, no buts; do it properly.

692
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,920
Push the boat in, well and truly.

693
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,360
Out, I mean.

694
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,400
<i>Do you think so?</i>

695
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,840
Let me foot the bill.

696
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:26,920
No, no.

697
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,520
The least I can do to help a friend

698
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,640
...who's temporarily on his uppers.

699
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,640
Uppers.

700
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,040
<i>How much?</i>

701
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,000
Oh, cash, of course.

702
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,160
I hope I am gonna get
invited to this London party.

703
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,200
Yeah.

704
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,240
<i>What do you have in mind?</i>

705
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,400
Colleagues of hers,
cosmopolitans like myself...

706
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,800
<i>More?</i>

707
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,360
Fashionistas, you know.

708
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,400
More.

709
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,160
<i>Why not?</i>

710
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,680
Good evening.

711
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,040
A reservation in the name of Carentis.

712
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,600
Your guest is already here, sir.

713
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,560
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

714
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,800
She won't be coming, Lisa.

715
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,320
<i>Lisa?</i>

716
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,440
She's dead.

717
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,040
Lisa,

718
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,800
...my wife, dead.

719
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,840
Me.

720
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:20,280
It's been me, you see.

721
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,720
<i>Aperitifs, signore?</i>

722
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,880
<i>What did she die of?</i>

723
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,960
Cancer.

724
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,760
<i>Bad?</i>

725
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:46,760
<i>Bad?</i>

726
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:50,040
She got so thin I could
carry her with one arm.

727
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,040
They say they know how to
cope with pain nowadays.

728
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,080
They do.

729
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,520
They did.

730
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,080
<i>Peter?</i>

731
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,720
<i>Do you want to come through?</i>

732
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,520
I wish she had screamed sometimes.

733
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,760
It'll be fine.

734
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,160
She didn't tell me she was
ill until it was too late.

735
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,680
I don't know why she did that.

736
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,120
It was so stupid.

737
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,640
Her doctor suggested it was vanity.

738
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,800
Shut up!

739
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,920
Of course it wasn't vanity.

740
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,680
She knew I wouldn't have
cared how she looked.

741
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,960
You do know she refused surgery.

742
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,840
I do now.

743
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,920
<i>Is Lisa proud of her looks?</i>

744
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,400
She didn't talk about it.

745
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:02,160
I suppose she... she didn't want to...

746
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:18,560
She never complained.

747
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,520
She...

748
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:40,080
She liked being beautiful.

749
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,920
It isn't a crime.

750
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,720
<i>What isn't?</i>

751
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,080
If she cared how she looked.

752
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,320
<i>It wasn't vanity.
- How dare you?</i>

753
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,080
She would have been just
waiting for it to go away.

754
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,120
<i>Go away?</i>

755
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,400
Yes, go away.

756
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,480
It was part of who she was.

757
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,040
Everything she did was perfection.

758
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,120
Don't be bloody silly.

759
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,240
It was the opposite.

760
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,040
She lived in the
perfection of the moment.

761
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,120
It wasn't perfection.

762
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,160
It was blindness.

763
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,280
<i>And what about the future?</i>

764
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,640
<i>Did that not matter?</i>

765
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:24,040
You know, I've been
very happy with you, Peter.

766
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,520
<i>Where?</i>

767
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:29,320
<i>Where were you happiest?</i>

768
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,960
<i>Hmm?</i>

769
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,000
Peter, l...

770
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,200
Write it down.

771
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,280
Here.

772
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,560
Go on.

773
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:41,640
Take the pencil.

774
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,880
Go on.

775
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,840
Write it down.

776
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,520
<i>I bet it will be the same, right?</i>

777
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,480
Smug bugger.

778
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,920
I have a better idea.

779
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,640
Write down somewhere we've never been

780
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,600
...that I could take you to.

781
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,560
You could take me anywhere.

782
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,440
<i>How did you find out about me?</i>

783
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:36,600
You were on a file called
"Love" on my wife's computer.

784
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,560
<i>You read my emails?</i>

785
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,640
All of them.

786
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,360
I pretend everything
is better than it is,

787
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,760
...that there is money when there isn't,

788
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,360
...make things more
beautiful than they are.

789
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,440
I can do that.

790
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:01,520
I am good at that.

791
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:06,400
Losers are brilliant
at making things pretty.

792
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:11,440
And I try to make the
world beautiful when I can,

793
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,960
...just bring it out
of... reach the core,

794
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,160
...the heart of things sort of thing.

795
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,480
And you...

796
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,800
You only see the surface.

797
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,720
George isn't the man for him.

798
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,680
But he is for me.

799
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,400
I know that.

800
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,720
<i>It doesn't have to
be either-or, does it?</i>

801
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,880
You can love two people at once.

802
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,120
Well, I think so anyway.

803
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,080
That's right.

804
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,360
Sweetheart, you know I've
always loved your father.

805
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,520
Mum, I know.

806
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,040
It's simple, really.

807
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,840
It's not just me anymore.

808
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,600
It's me and George.

809
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,200
And Dad thinks that's messy,

810
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,120
...and he does so love
everything in its place.

811
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,960
And he'll probably change all this,

812
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,440
...but he can't change me.

813
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,200
And sometimes I want to say to him,

814
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,120
...get a fucking life.

815
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:09,960
No.

816
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,520
Get your father.

817
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,840
No, no, I can do it; I can do it.

818
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,080
Get your father.

819
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,440
So well, that's it.

820
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,880
That's over.

821
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,280
You can still have your party for her.

822
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,360
I shan't be there, of course.

823
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,400
Of course.

824
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,080
You've had your revenge already.

825
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,960
I am a bullshitter who is a janitor

826
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,400
...who would take any job, any,

827
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:44,240
...brags about the past as if
it was a catalogue of glory,

828
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,960
...not unpaid bills and
bankruptcy and prison.

829
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,520
Oh, I'm sure.

830
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,200
I should have noticed.

831
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:56,480
Those emails sounded
as prickish as you are.

832
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,680
I saw them as beautiful, of course.

833
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:32,960
Do something for me.

834
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:38,200
Put this in one of the
red shoes in my room.

835
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,640
It's for Dad.

836
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,240
<i>How will he find it?</i>

837
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,760
He'll find it.

838
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,600
<i>But you know what?</i>

839
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:10,880
She knew everything about
me, and she paid my debts.

840
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:18,120
And she loved me in spite of it.

841
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:18,280
Thanks for the suit and the room.

842
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,240
Can't afford to pay you back,
but by God, I wish I could.

843
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,600
Feel free to enjoy your meal.

844
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,840
It's all right.

845
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,920
It's okay.

846
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,640
Let me go, Peter.

847
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,800
I can't.

848
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,520
You must.

849
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,160
That's mine.

850
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:31,840
Excuse me.

851
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,480
# You'll find a girl like you. #

852
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,400
# I'll find a guy like me. #

853
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,360
<i>Hello?</i>

854
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:44,560
<i>Abi, are you at work?</i>

855
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,680
<i>Dad?</i>

856
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,080
Okay.

857
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,160
<i>Listen, can I talk to you?</i>

858
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,800
Yeah, just talk, Dad.

859
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,360
It's what people do on phones.

860
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,480
<i>Abi, could you come up to London?</i>

861
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:02,440
I know it's short notice, but
if George could get away...

862
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,320
<i>Well, where?</i>

863
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,840
So, I said to Berlusconi, "Silvio,

864
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,280
"you can do more than
just a soccer team.

865
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,000
"You can run the country.

866
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,080
You can run the country."

867
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,120
He followed my advice.

868
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:17,400
Then he just said to me,
"Be my personal assistant."

869
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,000
I said, "I am just attending
a number of these now,

870
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,760
...and I don't know if
I'm gonna have the time."

871
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:22,800
Ralph.

872
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:23,880
You're looking well.

873
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:28,200
Good, wonderful you could come.

874
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,360
Do you know Peter Ryman,
a software designer,

875
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,600
...a friend of Bill Gates.

876
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,920
Reverend Tim Brookes.

877
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,240
We met the other day at the hospital.

878
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:44,080
Yes, I have a job there now.

879
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:48,880
Lisa was a happy woman

880
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,160
...as well as being
a great shoe designer

881
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,760
...and a great artist.

882
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,160
I can still see her now

883
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:06,920
...with her pencil and her
thumb never leaving the paper.

884
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,160
The line sweeping up
the heel to the upper

885
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:15,400
...along the top line,
across the throat,

886
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,880
...tracing the vamp...

887
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:26,720
Diving towards the toe,
stroking the sole to rise

888
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:31,280
...like a caress towards
the breast of the heel

889
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,320
...and down to its tip.

890
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,000
Sort of thing.

891
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,640
Lisa.

892
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,320
To Lisa.

893
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,000
Bravo, Ralph.

894
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:21,640
Look at him.

895
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:22,680
There he is.

896
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,640
Ralph.

897
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,200
We have Ralph.

898
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,360
<i>Dad?</i>

899
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,400
Our host.

900
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,800
God bless him.

901
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:17,640
And now my toast to Lisa, my wife,

902
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,160
...your friend.

903
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,320
My love.

904
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,560
To Lisa,

905
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,760
...and to our daughter, Abigail.

906
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,360
Abigail.

907
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:07,200
All that stuff about shoes.

908
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,200
Ralph.

909
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,120
Ralph.

910
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:17,360
Appalling, dreadful man.

911
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:20,840
But...

912
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,840
<i>Well?</i>

913
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,160
He was also rather wonderful.

914
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,040
And so was she.

915
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:46,400
<i>She really did know me, didn't she?</i>

916
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,240
Us.

917
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,480
Him.

918
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,080
The train now arriving
at platform seven

919
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:42,880
...is the 12:26 First Capital
Connect service to Cambridge,

920
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,200
...calling at Letchworth Garden City,

921
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:48,400
Royston, and Cambridge.

922
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:53,320
Platform seven is the 12:26
First Capital Connect service

923
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:57,240
...to Cambridge.

924
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,280
For safety reasons,

925
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:21,880
...please do not leave your
baggage and other items unattended

926
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,120
...in any part of the terminal.

927
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:28,840
Any unattended items will
be removed by the police.
