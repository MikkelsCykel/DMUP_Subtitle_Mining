00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,600
Are you Kathy Nicolo?

2
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,700
Yeah.

3
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,900
Is this your house?

4
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,300
<i>Nadi of course agreed
that it was a wonderful idea...</i>

5
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,400
<i>to cut down the trees
at our home on the Caspian.</i>

6
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,200
To have the sea spread before us.

7
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,900
To reach infinity with our eyes.

8
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,000
To see forever.

9
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,800
But then, our life
went the way of the trees...

10
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,200
when the Ayatollahs ripped the soul
out of our beautiful country.

11
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,800
Well, enough.

12
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,400
Today is not a day for the old.
It is a day for the young.

13
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,700
To the future.

14
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,100
To our Soraya. May she be a happy wife
as she is a bride.

15
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,200
And perhaps she will not forget
her poor mother and father so soon...

16
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,700
and return to us and give to us
many little grandbabies.

17
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,000
A father can dream.

18
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,300
He's so tanned.
Retirement has been good for the Colonel.

19
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,500
He's not retired. He works for Boeing.

20
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,900
He doesn't work for Boeing.
My son works for Boeing.

21
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,300
Who knows what he does now.

22
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,100
<i>- Hello.
- Kathy?</i>

23
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,300
<i>- What time is it?
- It's 9:00.</i>

24
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,000
Mom, that's 6:00 a. m. Here.

25
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,300
<i>I don't think 6:00 a.m. Will kill you.</i>

26
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,800
<i>Your father got up at 4:30 every day
of his life, God bless his soul.</i>

27
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,100
<i>So how is it going? How is the program?</i>

28
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Fine. I'm fine.

29
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,000
<i>One day at a time, right?</i>

30
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,100
<i>I just hope it's working.</i>

31
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,600
How is everyone there?

32
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,400
<i>Frankie's good. Salesman of the month
again. You know your brother.</i>

33
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,600
<i>His Lisa's in her seventh month.</i>

34
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,400
<i>How's your better half?</i>

35
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,000
Fine.

36
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,600
He's right here. He's sleeping.

37
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,800
<i>Sleeping?</i>

38
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,800
Mom, I'm really tired. I'm gonna go, okay?

39
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,200
<i>Listen, I almost forgot.
Your Aunt Frances won a trip to Reno.</i>

40
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,600
<i>And we'll come out on the 18th.
I thought we'd stop by to see you.</i>

41
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,300
<i>- The 18th?
- Yeah. Two weeks.</i>

42
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,200
Yeah, okay.

43
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,400
Nick's gonna be away on business, though.

44
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
<i>- Again?
- Yeah.</i>

45
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,500
I'm gonna go, okay, Mom?

46
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,400
<i>Listen, you're still not smoking, right?</i>

47
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,700
<i>- Bye.
- 'Cause, you know, they say...</i>

48
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,000
Just a second.

49
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,600
You Kathy Lazaro?

50
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,100
Yeah. Why?

51
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,800
Due to the nonpayment of business taxes
associated with this property...

52
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,300
the county has petitioned the court
on its behalf to reclaim these costs.

53
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,900
This should come as no surprise to you.
I'm sure you've had ample warning.

54
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
We've sent many notices.

55
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,500
Now the house is up for auction
starting tomorrow morning.

56
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Auction?

57
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
What are you talking about?
Are you out of your mind?

58
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
There's no smoking in my house.

59
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,600
Hey, Chuck.

60
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,700
Because I see your number right here.

61
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,200
Are we going to meet down there?

62
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,600
It's supposed to be a hot one today.

63
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
I'd dress lightly if I were you.

64
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,500
That's okay, because I'm not leaving.

65
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,200
I'm afraid you have no choice, Mrs. Lazaro.

66
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,700
All of your things will be
auctioned off with the property.

67
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
Do you want that?

68
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,800
Look, you can't evict me.

69
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,500
I never owed a fucking business tax.
It doesn't make any sense.

70
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,300
Okay. Well, this is where I get off.

71
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,400
Deputy Sheriff Burdon will assist you
with vacating the property.

72
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,900
Do you have a lawyer?

73
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,100
I can't afford a lawyer. I'm a house cleaner.

74
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,400
This is the number for
the Legal Assistance Office.

75
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,200
They might be able to help.

76
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,300
Nothing's written in blood.

77
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,600
You just have to clear out today.
You might be moving back in next week.

78
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,500
In the meantime...

79
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,900
maybe you can call some friends or family,
stay with them.

80
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,500
There's no one to call.

81
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,500
I tell you what.

82
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,800
I know some movers that owe me a favor.

83
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,300
Brian.

84
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,300
Why don't you go down to Safeway
and get some boxes.

85
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,700
Let's help this lady pack up.

86
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,900
Lester.

87
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,000
May I help you?

88
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,600
My car is parked here.

89
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
You asked yesterday also.

90
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,900
- What happened to you?
- I fell.

91
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,700
- Again?
- Yeah.

92
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,800
Wash up. Do not get blood on the floor.

93
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,300
The house was repossessed
for tax payment delinquency.

94
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,200
It's got three bedrooms, one bath.

95
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,200
A widow's walk would increase the value
of the property.

96
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,900
What is this "widow's walk"?

97
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,600
It's a deck on top of the house,
so you can see the ocean.

98
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,000
We still got some time here.
Feel free to take a look around.

99
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,700
<i>You should have a brown hat
on your head, not a blue one.</i>

100
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
<i>Why are you not working today?</i>

101
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,500
Nadereh...

102
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,500
today God has kissed our eyes.

103
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,800
Do you remember our bungalow
on the Caspian?

104
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,000
How I ordered the trees cut down
on the west side...

105
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,900
so that we may view the sea?

106
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,700
Please, be quiet.

107
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,600
Do you remember how the General
brought his family there for New Year...

108
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,200
how beautiful it was?

109
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,100
What is the matter for you today?

110
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,700
I today have bought
for us another bungalow.

111
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,500
I have purchased this home for a price
of which no one would believe.

112
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,400
It is worth two, maybe three times that.

113
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,900
We will live in this home
for a short while...

114
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,500
and then sell it and find one even better.

115
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,800
<i>I did not come to America
to live like an Arab.</i>

116
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,800
<i>A family roaming the street like gypsies.</i>

117
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,200
<i>I came to the States just to live normally.</i>

118
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,800
Perhaps you did not come here
to live like a gypsy.

119
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,400
But I did not come here
to work like an Arab.

120
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,900
To be treated like an Arab.

121
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,100
For four years, we have lived a life
which we could not afford...

122
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,100
and spent almost everything
to marry Soraya with a good family.

123
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,800
This apartment alone
has cost us over $140,000 in rent.

124
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,900
And what of Esmail's
university education?

125
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Soon we will have nothing.

126
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,800
Then you will see what it is like
to walk in the shoes of the gypsies.

127
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,700
So beginning tomorrow,
you will begin packing.

128
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,500
There's no more to discuss, Mrs. Behrani.
Do not open your lips.

129
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,300
$500?

130
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,200
They evicted you from your house
for that?

131
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,800
You got it.

132
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,100
Are you staying with friends?

133
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,500
Yeah, I'm with a friend.

134
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,400
How much is this going to cost me?

135
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
It's on a sliding scale.

136
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,200
How come you didn't
do something about this earlier?

137
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,000
I did. I went to the courthouse
months ago.

138
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,200
I signed a statement saying that
I never owed a business tax because...

139
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,600
I never owned a business.

140
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,300
I even had it certified.

141
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,900
And what about the follow-up mail?

142
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,100
I didn't open it.

143
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,700
It's very important to me
that I get my house back by the 18th.

144
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,500
I'm expecting company.

145
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,600
When did you sign that letter?

146
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
I don't know. March?

147
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
I hate to be the bearer of bad news...

148
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,200
but evidently
the county's already sold your house.

149
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,300
What?

150
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
No.

151
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,000
They can't do that.

152
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,200
The auction date has been set for months.

153
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,300
Look, don't worry.
I'll demand they rescind the sale...

154
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,900
or we'll file a lawsuit against the county.
We'll get your house back.

155
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,600
Before the 18th, right?

156
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,500
It's possible.

157
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,700
Fuck.

158
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Hello?

159
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,900
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

160
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,800
Don't do that.

161
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,400
You all right?

162
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,500
Yeah, I'm fine. You?

163
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,000
Good.

164
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,300
You working undercover or something?

165
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,700
Excuse me?

166
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,600
No, I'm off.

167
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,500
I just... I drive by this way...

168
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,600
and figured I'd check in on you.

169
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,000
See how you're holding up.

170
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,500
They already sold your house?

171
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,700
Technically, it's mine and my brother's.
My dad left it to us when he died.

172
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,200
I haven't told my family.

173
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,700
My lawyer is trying to get them
to rescind it.

174
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,400
So, I'm trying not to harp on the negative.

175
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,800
You have any kids, Mr. Burdon?

176
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Two.

177
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,000
Call me Lester.

178
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,000
My husband left me eight months ago.

179
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,100
No one knows that either.

180
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,200
Do you mind if I give you
some professional advice?

181
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,300
No.

182
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,600
Do it all through your lawyer, Kathy.

183
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,500
I wouldn't even drive past that house
till the keys were back in my hand.

184
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Thanks for checking in on me.

185
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Sure.

186
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,500
Night.

187
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,600
Kathy, wait.

188
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,200
Listen, this is my direct number
at the department.

189
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,600
Most the time, I'm out on patrol,
but if you ever need anything...

190
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,000
anything at all, just leave a message.

191
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,900
See you.

192
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,800
Good night.

193
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,200
It is like our garden in Isfahan.

194
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,400
<i>Hello?</i>

195
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,100
Yeah?

196
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,400
Your credit card didn't go through.
That's two days now.

197
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,000
God, I'm really sorry about that.

198
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,500
Look, I'm gonna
get my paycheck on Friday.

199
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,900
Is there any way
we can just let it slide until then?

200
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,400
The only affordable way
to put a terrace up there...

201
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,700
is to put the stairs on the outside.

202
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,500
It will have to block that kitchen window.

203
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,600
I could do that for about $1,000.

204
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,900
If we have to go through the roof,
you're talking $4,000 to $7,000.

205
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,400
But this window must be obstructed?

206
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,500
I don't see any other way.

207
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,400
That is acceptable.

208
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,400
Can you start today?

209
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,000
What are you doing?

210
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Excuse me?

211
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,000
What the fuck are you doing?
This is my house.

212
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,100
Who are you?

213
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,800
This is my house.
Who said you could do this?

214
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,200
- Are you Mrs. Behrani?
- No.

215
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,200
Mr. Behrani hired us.
You're gonna have to talk to him.

216
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,700
Fuck.

217
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
Shit.

218
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,100
Damn.

219
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,800
Stay right there. Don't move.

220
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Oh, man.

221
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,500
Let's get her inside.

222
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,900
Here. Come on.

223
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,200
Careful.

224
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,900
Can we use your bathroom?
She stepped on a nail.

225
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,300
Sorry, ma'am. Could we use
your washroom to clean her foot?

226
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,900
It is okay.

227
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
For one moment, please.

228
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

229
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,200
Have you had a tetanus shot lately?

230
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,900
I'm going to be sick.

231
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,800
Is she bleeding?

232
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,100
Excuse me.

233
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
I don't want to ruin your towel.

234
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,600
Here. I use this for skateboarding.

235
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Don't worry. I washed it.

236
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,300
Okay?

237
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,900
This is of course our family pictures.

238
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,000
Thank you.

239
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,000
I think I should go.

240
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,100
What happened?

241
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,000
I'll tell you what happened.
My yard is a construction site.

242
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,900
I'll tell you what happened.
My yard is a construction site.

243
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,800
- You were there?
- Yeah, I was there. I was at my house.

244
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,900
I stepped on some nails.

245
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,100
I was bleeding on my own doorstep,
waiting for a stranger to open my door.

246
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,400
You can't just go over there.
You gotta let us handle this.

247
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,000
I want them out of my house.

248
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,600
They're already more at home there
than I ever was.

249
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,800
Did you get their name?

250
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,800
Bahroony? Behmini, something like that.
I don't know. They're Middle Eastern.

251
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,700
- Gary?
- Yes, Connie?

252
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,200
Type up a letter to the courier service
and make sure it gets to a Mr. Behrmini.

253
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,100
It's damn hard to sell a house nowadays.

254
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,900
This is what you call a real buyer's market.

255
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,500
Sorry, but she comes in at $174,000.

256
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,900
- You're late, Behrani.
- I'm not late.

257
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,600
I have come to tell you that
I am no longer to return to this job.

258
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
You tell the office, Colonel?

259
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
No.

260
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,800
So why tell me, man?

261
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,900
Is this you?

262
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,000
"... inform you that
under these circumstances... "

263
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,500
"... we request that
you vacate the property immediately. "

264
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,800
Mother whores. God damn it.

265
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,900
Mr. Barmeeeny is here.

266
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,600
Mr. Barmeeny.

267
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
My name is Behrani.

268
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,600
Col. Massoud Amir Behrani.

269
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,000
I wish to speak with Mr. Walsh, please.

270
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,200
I'm Connie Walsh.
This is my office, Colonel.

271
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,700
Please come in.

272
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,400
I'm sure our letter came as a shock to you.

273
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,100
The situation is this:

274
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,300
Pacific County has made
a number of mistakes.

275
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,000
First, they levied a tax on my client
which she did not owe.

276
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,900
Second, they evicted her for nonpayment.

277
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And third, they auctioned the property...

278
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,300
and unfortunately, sir,
this is where you come in.

279
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
But I now own the house.

280
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,800
I paid for it in cash. I have a bill of sale.
Here, please.

281
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,600
Would you be willing to
sell the county back the house?

282
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,000
I can assure you they would make it
as comfortable a transaction as possible.

283
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,800
Please listen to me
very carefully, Miss Walsh.

284
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,200
The only comfortable
transaction possible...

285
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,900
is if the county tax office
paid to me $174,000.

286
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,800
Mr. Behrani, you only paid
a quarter of that amount.

287
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,300
The market can already pay me this.
Good morning, Miss Walsh.

288
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,300
Wait, please?

289
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,800
From a legal standpoint,
you are in the right.

290
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,500
But the true owner of this house
is living in a motel, Mr. Behrani.

291
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,800
All her belongings are locked in storage.

292
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,400
Now, why should she wait
to get back into her home...

293
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:11,000
that was wrongfully taken from her
just because you want to turn a profit?

294
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,800
Things are not as they appear.

295
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,800
It is a matter of necessity
for me and my family.

296
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,900
I'm sorry.
I do not have a choice in this matter.

297
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,700
This is a surprise.

298
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,800
Good one or a bad one?

299
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,800
It's good.

300
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,700
What happened to your foot?

301
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,500
I stopped by my house, and they were
doing some construction on the roof.

302
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,200
I stepped on some nails.

303
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,200
Thanks for letting me ride along
today, Mr. Burdon.

304
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,300
So, how's the El Rancho?

305
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,000
I'm not there anymore.

306
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,500
I'm staying at the Bonneville now.

307
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,000
I don't know it.

308
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,000
You're looking at it.

309
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,300
I haven't had a drink in three years, Lester.

310
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,800
I'm sorry.
I should have asked, I didn't know.

311
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,300
It's okay.

312
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,600
The fog's coming in.

313
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,300
I'd like to ask you
a personal question if I could.

314
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,300
Okay.

315
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,500
Just get it over with.

316
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,600
Why is your husband no longer with you?

317
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,100
I wanted kids.

318
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,500
He didn't want kids.

319
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,100
But I guess if he really wanted me,
he would have wanted them, too.

320
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,700
I think he's a fool.

321
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,000
Maybe we should find you a place to stay.

322
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,500
Do you remember
the beauty of the Caspian Sea, Esmail?

323
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,300
The water like glass,
the beach sand like gold.

324
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,800
It is beautiful here.

325
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,200
Massoud, when must we move again?

326
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,400
Not too soon.

327
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,000
Perhaps once we get a buyer,
we will tell them to wait until autumn.

328
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,900
Would you prefer that?

329
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,800
I will do as you wish.

330
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,500
There was this little runt of a guy.

331
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,300
Kept beating up his wife.
Except she wouldn't press charges.

332
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,800
We'd show up and they'd be, at the door,
like Romeo and Juliet.

333
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,700
Arm in arm.

334
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,600
She had welts and bruises all over her.

335
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,800
So, one night,
we get called out there again.

336
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:42,200
And I slip down their hallway,
and stuff two eight balls in his closet.

337
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,700
Turned out he was on parole.

338
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,700
He goes back to jail. She's safe.

339
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,800
And I slept like a baby.

340
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,600
Did I just lose you?

341
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,800
No.

342
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,500
I'm sorry.

343
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,400
To tell you the truth,
I think the wine is distracting me.

344
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,600
- I'll send it back.
- No, it's fine.

345
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,300
- You sure?
- Yeah.

346
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,900
See, when I think of my sobriety,
I don't think about wine.

347
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,800
Alcohol was never a problem.

348
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,300
You're a grown woman.

349
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,800
Cheers.

350
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,200
- What are your kids' names?
- Nate and Bethany.

351
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,000
Nate is four. Bethany is nine.

352
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,800
Where is your house?

353
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,600
Millbrae. In a housing development...

354
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,600
called Palomino Meadows.

355
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,100
You have to drive through it
to get to the mall.

356
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,200
Yeah, I know where that is.

357
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,100
God, I've probably driven by it
a dozen times.

358
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,700
I've probably even seen your wife.

359
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,100
Carol.

360
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,100
Yeah, Carol.

361
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,400
What's your situation, Les?

362
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,400
I married my best friend.

363
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,700
And for seven of the last nine years...

364
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,800
I haven't wanted to give her
more than a hug or a peck on the cheek.

365
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,200
That's my situation.

366
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,600
What about her?

367
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,100
It's not the same for her.

368
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,100
Do you want to come inside?

369
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,300
We are blessed.

370
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,700
What time is it?

371
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,000
- It's 10:00.
- Oh, God.

372
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,700
I should have been home hours ago.

373
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,900
I'm sure Carol called the department.

374
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,500
And I'm sure they asked her
if I was feeling any better.

375
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,300
Things are finally in motion.

376
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,000
I'm finally going to get it over with.

377
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,300
It?

378
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,200
Telling her the truth about how I feel.

379
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,100
How do you feel?

380
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,300
I feel found.

381
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,600
Well, Kathy, bad news.

382
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,600
The county's done their part...

383
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,800
but the new owner
won't go along with the deal.

384
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,500
He's asking
for four times what he bought it for.

385
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,300
We can sue the county,
but that'll take months.

386
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:23,900
Do you mean that
I can't legally get my house back?

387
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,300
It would have been a lot easier
if you'd just opened your mail.

388
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,600
You can't expect the law to work miracles.

389
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:34,300
I don't expect miracles.
I expect you to do your fucking job.

390
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,900
I don't know what I'm doing
sitting here talking to you.

391
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,500
And as you see, very excellent rooms.

392
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,200
It is cool inside, even during the day.

393
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,700
And from the widow's walk,
sunsets are quite beautiful.

394
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,700
There is very little fog in this area.

395
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,300
When would the house be available?

396
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,100
Not until autumn at the earliest. We would
need some time to find a new home.

397
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,800
That might work for us.

398
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,600
Yes, she has come for a tool her boyfriend
carpenter may have left behind.

399
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,600
I have been expecting her.
One moment, please.

400
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,700
I am happy you came.

401
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,800
Please, this way. I will show you.

402
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,700
My family knows nothing of this.
I'd like for it to remain so.

403
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,000
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

404
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,500
No, I'm quite certain I know who you are.

405
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,100
I'm Kathy Nicolo.

406
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,800
I know my lawyer talked to you,
Mr. Bahroony...

407
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,800
but I thought we could meet face to face.

408
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,800
My name is Behrani. Colonel Behrani.

409
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,200
Colonel Behrani, I'm sorry.

410
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,300
Look, my father left us this house.
He left it to me and my brother and...

411
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,300
Tell these things to the bureaucrats
at the county tax office.

412
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,700
They made the mistake, not I.

413
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:51,800
They said they'd give your money back,
and I know you've put that deck on.

414
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,700
I'm sure they'd repay you for that.

415
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,500
I'm sorry, miss, but I have
nothing more to say to anyone.

416
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,000
Why should I be penalized
for their incompetence?

417
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,500
You should sue them
for enough money to buy 10 homes.

418
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,800
I'll sell you this house for the right price.
That's all I require.

419
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,700
I do not know where he left his hammers.
There is nothing more to say of it.

420
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,100
Let go of me.

421
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,600
You can't expect to just move in here
and make money off of this.

422
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,300
This is my house.

423
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:20,700
I lived here, and you stole this house
from me, you son of a bitch.

424
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,400
This is a stolen house!
He's trying to sell you a stolen house!

425
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,500
What did you tell your kids?

426
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,400
I told them the truth.

427
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,200
My old man walked out on us.
I swore I would never do that to my own.

428
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,100
What happened?

429
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,000
My lawyer couldn't get the house back,
so I went to see the owner.

430
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,500
- And he put his hand on you?
- It's okay.

431
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,500
- Don't worry about it.
- That's not right.

432
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,300
He's got no right to do that.

433
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,400
Who is this guy?

434
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,800
His name's Behrani. He's a Colonel.

435
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,500
Behrani? What country is he from?

436
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,600
I don't know.

437
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,000
But his wife hardly speaks any English.

438
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,700
Maybe they haven't been here that long.

439
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,800
Maybe they don't know their way around.

440
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,700
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to pay him a visit.

441
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:36,300
Officers tend to listen to other officers.
It's worth a shot.

442
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,400
What if he doesn't listen?

443
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,700
Then I'll make him listen.

444
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,600
Little bird.

445
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,600
Welcome to our new home.

446
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,800
Does it go down the hill?

447
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,900
It is an investment property, Soraya.

448
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,800
You remember,
like our second home on the Caspian.

449
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,700
It's an investment home.

450
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,200
Let us go to the roof porch for the view.

451
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,900
Jesus, look at them.

452
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,000
What are they celebrating?
Stealing a woman's house?

453
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,000
Fuck these people.

454
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,300
<i>You're a very wise man, Genab Sarhang...</i>

455
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,100
to live in such a place
that gives you a view of God's wonders.

456
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,200
Did you post that sign, sir?

457
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,600
Yes, is there a difficulty, Officer?

458
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,200
And that's your sign
at the bottom of the hill?

459
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,400
Yes.

460
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,500
Please come in, Officer.

461
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,900
I am new to the area.
Is a permit required to post signs?

462
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:57,800
Not on the house.
But the utility pole, that's city property.

463
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,900
I see.

464
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,500
Very well. I'll put the sign elsewhere.
Thank you for informing me.

465
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,600
You're a long way from home, aren't you?

466
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,100
This is my home. I am an American citizen.

467
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:12,300
- Were you a General?
- I was a Colonel.

468
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,700
Tell me, Officer, what more can I do
for you this evening?

469
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,300
What's your name?

470
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,300
Massoud Amir Behrani.

471
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,400
And the names of your family?

472
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,800
Why do you need the names of my family?
What is your name, Officer?

473
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,900
Deputy Sheriff Joe Gonzalez.
Now let me ask you a question, Colonel.

474
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,800
Are you selling this house on your own?

475
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,100
I do not wish to offend, Officer...

476
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,800
but if you'd excuse me,
I have work to do this evening.

477
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,700
Civil Code 1101.

478
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,000
Yes, you have informed me.

479
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I suggest you come with me
to witness the removal of the sign.

480
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,300
No, I'm talking about
the disclosure law, Colonel.

481
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,700
You, the owner, have the obligation
to tell all prospective buyers...

482
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,900
anything about the property
they have a right to know.

483
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:58,800
I do not understand.

484
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,100
You sure about that?

485
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,200
Are you interrogating me, Mr. Gonzalez?

486
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:07,200
No, you tell me. I understand your friend,
the Shah, made a real habit of it.

487
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,400
I don't know who you think
you're speaking to, but I've had enough.

488
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,000
You've done your job. You may leave.

489
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:26,900
You're used to giving orders, aren't you?
Let me get right to the point here.

490
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,700
Pacific County has offered you money.
They don't want any trouble.

491
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,100
The only one that seems
to want trouble around here is you.

492
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:38,200
You don't want to do the right thing,
which is to sell this house back...

493
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:42,500
at the price you paid for it,
so it can be returned to the real owner.

494
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:46,300
The real owner, Mr. Behrani.
Now that just won't wash.

495
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,900
I have more than one contact
at Immigration.

496
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,300
People get deported every single day.

497
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,600
There are a lot of things I can do.

498
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,400
I suggest you call the movers
so I won't have to.

499
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,000
What happened?

500
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,900
Well, the guy's obviously
not right off the boat.

501
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,800
I think you're right.

502
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,200
He probably buys up seized property
just to make a killing.

503
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,000
I set him straight. I think he'll listen.

504
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,700
He will.

505
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,500
So what do we do now?

506
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,200
Look at us. We're both homeless.

507
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,800
My friend has a cabin a few miles south.
We can stay there.

508
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,800
Give to me answer, Behrani.
What did that man say of deporting?

509
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,300
- He said nothing, Nadi.
- Do not lie to me! I heard him!

510
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,000
Who was that man? Tell to me, Behrani.

511
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,000
<i>Behman behgoo, what have you done?</i>

512
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,700
It's none of your business
what I have done or not done.

513
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,300
Have you no faith in me? No respect?

514
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,900
That man only said
I must remove the sign. That's all.

515
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,600
Coward! Liar!

516
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,300
<i>You kasifliar!</i>

517
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:03,900
It is your fault
we were forced to flee from Iran.

518
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,200
It is your fault that we are here!

519
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,600
Yours and your Savak friends!

520
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,100
How long can we stay here?

521
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,200
Till we get things figured out.

522
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,400
You hungry?

523
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,500
I could eat.

524
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,900
Do you still love her?

525
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,800
Look, it's just...

526
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,900
It's not her.

527
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,700
She's a good person, a good mother.

528
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:56,000
Would this have happened anyway?
Even if you hadn't met me?

529
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,800
Yes.

530
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,300
I miss my dad.

531
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,200
He worked really hard for that house.

532
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,400
It took him...

533
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,100
thirty years to pay it off.

534
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,200
And it took me eight months to fuck it up.

535
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,100
We're going to get your house back. Soon.

536
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,800
When this is all done, I promise...

537
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,100
I'll move you back in myself.

538
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,200
My son...

539
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,500
do not follow the example of your father
one day when you are married.

540
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,600
Do not do as I did last evening.

541
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,800
Do not be disrespectful, son. Look at me.

542
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,900
- Were you a Savaki?
- No.

543
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,700
<i>I only bought fighter planes for
Shah-ansha.</i>

544
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,900
Why did that man say
we will be deported?

545
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,400
I do not know.

546
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:26,600
But we are American citizens.
We own this house.

547
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,600
They can do nothing to us now.

548
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,500
<i>I feel bad for that lady, Baba jahn.</i>

549
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:37,900
The woman's house was taken from her
because she did not pay her taxes.

550
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,500
That happens when one is not responsible.
Do you understand?

551
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,400
Do not feel bad. Americans,
they do not deserve what they have.

552
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,100
They have the eyes of children,
who are forever looking...

553
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,900
for the next source of distraction,
entertainment, sweet taste in the mouth.

554
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,500
We are not like them.

555
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:59,300
We know rich opportunities when we see
it and don't throw away God's blessing.

556
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,900
You know I must raise money
for your university education.

557
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,900
I can get another paper route.

558
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,200
I know.

559
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,200
You are kind child.

560
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,900
Quickly becoming a man.

561
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,000
You have my respect for your heart.

562
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,500
Soon all this will be over.

563
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,800
Thank you.

564
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,700
Have a good day at work.

565
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,600
You need to see
what you're doing to this family.

566
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:03,500
Look at your children,
at the damage you're causing.

567
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,700
- This is not the time for this, Carol.
- When is the time?

568
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,100
When I'm not on my way to work.

569
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,000
Stop it!

570
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,200
Do you want to get arrested?
Is that what you want?

571
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:21,400
You want to arrest me? God, go ahead,
arrest me in front of our children.

572
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,100
Daddy, please!

573
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,700
God, I didn't mean to do this.

574
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,900
Don't go. Please don't go.

575
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,700
We checked, and we have no Joe Gonzalez
on the force.

576
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,700
Did he have anything else on him?

577
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:42,100
Any pins, anything that might
help us to ID him?

578
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:45,100
We have hundreds of deputies
in the department.

579
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,000
He wore a golden star.

580
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,800
A badge with two pistol barrels crossed.

581
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,900
And letters of gold spelling F-T-O.

582
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,800
There are only eight Field Training Officers
in the whole department.

583
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,900
Tell me if you see him here.

584
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,100
Yes.

585
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:32,200
That is him.
That is the man who threatened me.

586
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,800
It's Burdon.

587
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,600
You're completely confident
this is the officer?

588
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:48,700
I'm sorry this happened to you, sir.
I can promise you it won't happen again.

589
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,200
What do you think?

590
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,200
I cleaned the whole place.

591
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,400
What's wrong?

592
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:24,200
Kath, I need to go home for a while today.

593
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:28,300
I need to go home and explain things
to Carol better...

594
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,900
to Nate and Bethany.

595
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,900
I should be home
when they come back from school.

596
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,400
You just said "home" three times.

597
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,700
It is my home.

598
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,400
At least until we make another one.

599
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,300
Are you coming back?

600
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,600
A couple of hours. Three at the most.

601
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,900
I'll understand if you don't.

602
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,500
I don't deserve you.

603
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,600
Of course you do.

604
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,300
Fuck.

605
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,300
I told the kids
that this was just temporary...

606
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:39,500
that you were just taking some time off,
like a vacation.

607
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,700
I didn't know what else to tell them.

608
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,500
Tell them the truth, Carol.

609
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,300
Hello.

610
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,300
<i>Deputy Lester Burdon?</i>

611
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,100
Hello?

612
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,300
<i>- Deputy Lester Burdon?
- Yes?</i>

613
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,900
This is Lt. Alvarez with Internal Affairs.

614
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,100
I'd like you to dispatch yourself
to my office immediately.

615
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,400
Can't it wait till I'm back on duty, sir?

616
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,700
<i>No, Deputy, it cannot.
You be in my office in 45 minutes...</i>

617
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,700
<i>or you can come in tomorrow
and drop off your badge.</i>

618
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,300
Please wait.

619
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,000
Excuse for me, please.

620
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:04,700
I am sorry for keeping you to waiting.
How is your foot?

621
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,200
Better, thank you.

622
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:10,600
Can I come in?

623
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:13,200
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

624
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,500
I grew up in this house.

625
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:26,100
It's the house that my father left
to me and my brother when he died.

626
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,600
The county evicted me
from this house by mistake.

627
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,300
And your husband bought it...

628
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,400
and now he won't sell it back
for less than four times what he paid.

629
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:41,300
Now, I don't want to argue with him.
You know, I really don't.

630
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:45,600
It's just that if this goes to court,
it could take months, and...

631
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:47,400
They are to deport us?

632
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,600
- I don't know.
- You must see.

633
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:55,400
They will kill us.
They will shoot my children.

634
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,900
You don't understand a word I'm saying,
do you?

635
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,100
Please, you are a very nice girl.

636
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:16,000
Please, you write for me everything.

637
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,300
I want for to understand...

638
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,500
for discussing with my husband.

639
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,300
You think you can frighten me?

640
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:06,300
You think you can frighten me with your
stupid deputy coming here, telling lies.

641
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:10,500
What do you think I am? Tell me that.
Am I stupid? Do you think I'm stupid?

642
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,500
In my country, you'd not be worthy
to raise your eyes to me. You are nothing!

643
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:18,600
And you can tell your deputy friend
his superior officers know everything.

644
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,900
You tell him that. This is our home!

645
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,400
- Please.
- Our home!

646
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:26,900
Please, stop!

647
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,100
<i>- K, is that you?
- Yeah.</i>

648
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:51,200
<i>Mom said you sounded strange
on the phone. What's going on?</i>

649
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,200
I need help.

650
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,800
<i>- I really need some help.
- What's wrong?</i>

651
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:01,100
Do you think you could just
come out here? Please?

652
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:07,700
<i>K, I'm sorry. I just got a real shit storm
going on over here.</i>

653
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:10,600
<i>We just got the new models in.
There's inventory.</i>

654
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:13,600
<i>I'll be right there. Just give me a second.</i>

655
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:18,000
I just feel lost, Frankie, you know?

656
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,700
I just...

657
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,800
I just feel lost.

658
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,700
<i>Look, Ma and the aunts will be out there
on the 18th.</i>

659
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,400
<i>They can help you, bring you back,
straighten you out, okay?</i>

660
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,400
<i>I'm sorry, K, but I got to go, okay?</i>

661
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:43,300
<i>All right, chin up, baby sister.
I'll call you later.</i>

662
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,100
Don't tell Mom, all right?

663
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,100
Okay, bye. Fuck.

664
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,300
Pack of Royals?

665
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:31,500
Wild night?

666
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,700
Seems to be heading in that direction.

667
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,800
- Have a good one.
- Thanks.

668
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,400
This, and three on two.

669
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,100
You need a funnel with that?

670
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,800
No. Just a book of matches.

671
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:59,700
I'm sorry.

672
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:27,200
I don't want the house anymore.

673
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:29,200
I don't care.

674
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:50,100
Don't go.

675
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:09,400
You must sleep now. You must rest.

676
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:09,000
Please? Some tea.

677
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,500
Please, have bath to relax.

678
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:07,900
That car in the driveway,
is it that woman's?

679
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
The woman has come here and tried
to take her own life. We must help her.

680
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,900
<i>Pesaram, she is a bird.</i>

681
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:15,600
A broken one.

682
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:21,100
Your grandfather used to say that a bird
which flies into your house is an angel.

683
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:24,200
You must look upon his presence
as a blessing.

684
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:28,000
<i>We have a guest in the house.
You must be a gentleman, joon-am.</i>

685
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:31,500
Very kind. Very polite.

686
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,000
Very quiet.

687
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,500
Hello?

688
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,600
Do you need anything?

689
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:42,300
Your mouth to open. Very good.
Your mouth.

690
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:45,300
Very good. Yes.

691
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:55,400
Very good.

692
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,300
I feel sorry for her.

693
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,100
We should have moved.

694
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:16,200
Yes, perhaps you're right.
We should have moved.

695
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:38,400
Put her down!

696
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:43,700
What did you do to her?
Step back. Shut up!

697
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,700
- Listen!
- No! Move!

698
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:48,500
Les, don't.

699
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:50,000
Move.

700
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,500
What did you do to her?

701
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,600
She took an entire bottle
of my mother's pills.

702
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:05,300
Bring them to me.

703
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,500
How many? When?

704
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,400
English!

705
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:21,800
My wife says 20 tablets,
perhaps half an hour ago.

706
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,100
My wife made her lose her stomach.
She has vomited the pills.

707
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:28,000
She also attempted
to shoot herself with that pistol.

708
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:32,000
I discovered her with it in her automobile.
She was quite upset.

709
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,900
She'd been drinking great deal.

710
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,600
That's bullshit.

711
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,100
Come here.

712
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:47,600
Pick her up. Carry her into that room.

713
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:55,600
Carefully!

714
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,400
Step away.

715
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,600
She'll be okay.

716
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,600
All right, come on.

717
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:34,200
I don't want to see this door move.

718
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:52,500
Get some rest in there...

719
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:56,400
'cause tomorrow you're selling this place
back to the county.

720
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:37,600
Fuck.

721
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:14,200
Yes?

722
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:17,300
- I have to go.
- Use the toilet.

723
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,400
Your mother will not look.

724
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:42,000
Today I want you to pretend
to be frightened of this man.

725
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:45,000
- You must do everything he says.
- Why?

726
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:48,300
He is a weak man,
he is nothing without his gun.

727
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:53,700
He's very scared,
and a scared man is dangerous.

728
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,400
We will remain...

729
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:00,400
<i>lions in our hearts, pesaram.</i>

730
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:25,200
- You're here.
- I'm here.

731
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:32,600
Sir? Please let us out
so my family can eat.

732
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:39,100
- What's going on?
- I locked them in the bathroom.

733
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:43,100
Why? That's crazy, Les.

734
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:46,400
No, what's crazy is trying to kill yourself.

735
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,400
Kathy, why?

736
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:54,100
I didn't think you were coming back.

737
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:57,300
Well, I'm back.

738
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,600
Do you really want to die?

739
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:05,300
I just wanted things to change.

740
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,900
You will get out
when you call the goddamn county!

741
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:13,700
Sir, may I speak with you?

742
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:22,300
What?

743
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,900
Please open the door.
I wish to speak with you directly.

744
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:37,400
I think I have a possible resolution.

745
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:40,000
You and I will go
to the government office...

746
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:43,800
and I will sign the necessary papers
for returning the house to them.

747
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:46,700
They to me will write a check for $45,000.

748
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:50,000
This check I will give to you
and the woman...

749
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:53,100
in exchange
for putting the house in my name.

750
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,500
- You would do that?
- I would do that.

751
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:02,600
Wait.

752
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:10,800
We can't do this, Les.

753
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,700
I think that this can all work out.
He signs the house to the county.

754
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:18,700
When he gets the check, he gives it to us.
Then you sign the house back to him.

755
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,800
It's wrong.
It's just wrong to do it this way.

756
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:23,600
This has got to work.

757
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:27,200
This way, at least you get some money.
He gets what he wants, the house.

758
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:30,200
It's a win-win situation. No one gets hurt.

759
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:31,800
Let's just go.

760
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,600
Please, let's just go.

761
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:37,900
Kathy, we could use that money.

762
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:41,200
To start new. It's our only choice now.

763
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:43,600
He'll never let it happen.

764
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,500
All right. Leave the keys
and go do what you promised.

765
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:55,500
But your son stays here with me.

766
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:58,200
You're not back soon...

767
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:00,500
Ishmael and I will be gone.

768
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:03,100
But we have made an agreement.

769
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:10,700
No, I will for you do nothing
without my son.

770
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:13,200
Nothing.

771
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:23,500
Shit.

772
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:27,300
Fine. Let's just do this.

773
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:47,800
Move it, Colonel. Come on.
You too, Ishmael.

774
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,700
Excuse me, Mr. Burdon?

775
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,900
- All right. Slow down.
- Deputy Sheriff Burdon.

776
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:56,400
Sir?

777
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,300
I know you're busy.

778
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:02,100
I just wanted to say
I appreciate everything you taught me.

779
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:04,900
I just wanted to say thanks.

780
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:08,400
I appreciate that.
And good luck to you, Brian.

781
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:23,800
All right.

782
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:27,500
You listen to me. When we get in there,
you and Ishmael here...

783
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:28,300
You listen to me. When we get in there,
you and Ishmael here...

784
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:32,600
you'll have to hear me a whole lot better.
You're gonna do exactly as I tell.

785
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:33,800
Help!

786
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:37,300
Somebody help us!
Somebody call the police, fast!

787
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,000
My name is Esmail...

788
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:42,100
not Ishmael.

789
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:47,600
Help, somebody call the police!

790
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:49,100
Esmail, please!

791
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,200
Drop it, now!

792
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:52,700
I said drop it!

793
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,500
Wait!

794
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:04,700
No!

795
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:12,600
We have an officer-involved shooting.

796
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,700
God damn you,
this kid is going to bleed to death.

797
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,600
Call to hospital!

798
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:22,500
Hospital!

799
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:27,300
I want only my son!

800
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:31,900
...medic here, now!

801
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:33,400
I want only my son.

802
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,200
Let go, sir!

803
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:43,400
It is him! He has done this! I will kill you!

804
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,700
I will kill you!

805
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:55,100
<i>Pesaram, I am here.</i>

806
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:25,800
What is your name, Deputy? Sir?

807
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:30,000
- What?
- What is your name?

808
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,500
I'm so sorry about all of this.

809
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:53,500
I have a headache.

810
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,200
Please, excuse for me.

811
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:15,900
Please, I must to my son.

812
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:31,700
Burdon corroborates the whole deal.

813
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,700
Mr. Behrani, you're free to go.

814
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:39,700
This is your recourse. You can
press charges against Deputy Burdon...

815
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:41,800
Please, I must to hospital.

816
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:43,500
Your son is at St. Vincent.

817
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,100
He's three blocks east of here.
We can give you a police escort!

818
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:56,100
I want only my son.

819
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:06,900
Emergency!

820
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,900
I must see my son. My son, he is here.

821
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,200
- He has been shot.
- His name?

822
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,000
What's his name, sir?

823
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,900
Behrani.

824
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:28,900
Esmail.

825
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:32,600
He's in Trauma.
You can wait in the lounge.

826
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,500
<i>Please, God, don't take my joon-am.</i>

827
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:45,900
<i>I make my nazr.
My nazr, hear me, please to hear me.</i>

828
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:49,500
I will give everything
to one who is less fortunate.

829
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,400
Yes! I will make it for the broken bird.

830
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,400
<i>Please, God, I'm making nazr
to this woman.</i>

831
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:58,200
To Kathy Nicolo. And I to you promise...

832
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:02,000
if you heal my son,
I will return her father's house.

833
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:06,800
<i>I will also give to her all the money I have.
My God, Khoda.</i>

834
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:09,300
<i>I make nazr only for my son.</i>

835
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,000
Please, I want only for my son.

836
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:15,200
I beg you. I will do whatever is your will.

837
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:19,600
I will purchase 10 kilos of the finest seed
and find an American mosque...

838
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:22,300
and I will feed them
to all the birds outside.

839
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:25,600
I will let the birds cover me
and peck out my eyes.

840
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:29,500
<i>Please, God, my nazr is in your hands.</i>

841
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:50,300
<i>You've reached the Burdon family.
We're not here right now...</i>

842
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:51,700
<i>but if you leave a message...</i>

843
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,800
<i>we'll call you right back!</i>

844
01:50:57,700 --> 01:50:59,300
Let's go, Burdon.

845
01:52:56,700 --> 01:52:57,800
Drink this.

846
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:01,200
Some tea.

847
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:50,300
I am tired.

848
01:53:56,400 --> 01:54:00,400
Soon we will return to
the flowers of Isfahan...

849
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,700
the mosques of Qom...

850
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:07,700
and to the fine hotels of old Tehran.

851
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:19,200
I have taken us so far off our course...

852
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:22,500
but now it is time to return.

853
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:25,900
It is time for us to go home...

854
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,000
to our destiny.

855
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:26,400
God.

856
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:16,100
No.

857
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:20,100
Please.

858
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:34,300
Are you Kathy Nicolo?

859
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:38,700
Yeah.

860
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:41,900
Is this your house?

861
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:52,300
No, it's not my house.

862
02:01:53,300 --> 02:02:03,300
