1
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:46,281
- If I was going, I'd go as a...
- A princess!

2
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,825
Yeah.

3
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:51,620
- Judy Baumer's going as a twirler.
- But she's so fat.

4
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:54,915
I'd rather go as Cinderella
or Peter Pan.

5
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:57,835
Peter Pan's a boy.
Tinkerbell's a girl.

6
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:03,674
- Phillip could go as Peter Pan.
- Phillip could go as a bump on a log.

7
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:07,803
- Why can't we just go once?
- Because we just can't, okay?

8
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:12,224
Our personal beliefs lift us
to a higher place.

9
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:16,853
- I'll get it.
- You got it last time!

10
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,773
Trick or treat!

11
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:23,068
I'm sorry, we don't take
no part in Halloween.

12
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:24,486
Excuse me?

13
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,488
We're Jehovah's Witness.

14
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:31,159
- Hey, Phillip Perry.
- Hey, Billy Reeves.

15
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,495
How'd you know it was me?

16
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:36,081
Come on, go eat your supper.

17
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,960
Come on, kids, let's go
to the next house.

18
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:42,212
Sorry for the bother.

19
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,899
- Evening, Larry. Forget something?
- Need to take some work.

20
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:07,529
- When are we gonna grab a cold one?
- Sooner the better!

21
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,280
- Hey, daddy!
- Yeah?

22
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:57,453
- You sure this goes on up to the vents?
- It used to, in the old days.

23
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:01,666
Because if it don't,
I'm gonna rip your tongue out.

24
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,293
You punk thief.

25
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:19,600
Move.

26
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:40,746
Damn if that old man ain't right.

27
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:23,497
Here's your trick!

28
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,584
Bombs away!

29
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:30,712
Oh, good one!

30
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:35,300
We really got him.

31
00:05:58,156 --> 00:06:01,284
You and me must be living right,
Butchie-boy.

32
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:06,372
Let's get something straight.
I don't like you.

33
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,875
As soon as we're on our way...

34
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:10,627
...that's it.

35
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,716
Who said I liked you?

36
00:06:44,535 --> 00:06:46,037
Keep your mouth shut.

37
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:51,417
God, I'd love to blow your brains out.

38
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,803
Good night, Larry.

39
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:14,690
Good night, Larry.

40
00:07:26,702 --> 00:07:28,954
Come on, wake up.

41
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:42,134
I like that one.

42
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:45,929
You sure are picky.
Wrong neighborhood for a Lincoln.

43
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:49,058
Hey, there's a Buick.

44
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:52,603
I don't want a Buick. I want a Ford.

45
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:56,774
Fords leak oil.
Besides, daddy, a car's a car.

46
00:08:02,654 --> 00:08:04,907
Take the Buick.

47
00:08:05,574 --> 00:08:09,411
As soon as we cross
the state line, I'll do just that.

48
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,335
I'm tired of waiting around.
I'm gonna go check down the block...

49
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,589
...for a Ford.

50
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:52,871
Go wake up your sisters.

51
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,812
I take mine fried.

52
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:46,674
A little on the bland side.

53
00:09:46,883 --> 00:09:51,763
Give me some of that ketchup,
would you? Now. Please?

54
00:09:57,685 --> 00:10:00,855
You haven't got a man around here,
now, do you?

55
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:04,984
No!

56
00:10:16,954 --> 00:10:19,206
We got a fighter here now!

57
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,083
No!

58
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,297
Oh, lookie here. Look, you got
a little man in the house.

59
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:31,552
No!

60
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:34,096
No!

61
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:45,858
I'm bleeding! You happy?

62
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:08,422
What's your name, boy?

63
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:11,508
Phillip.

64
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:17,806
Okay, Phillip, reach down
and pick up that pistola for me.

65
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:26,356
- Give it to me.
- Shut your mouth!

66
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:37,284
Pick it up and bring it over to me.

67
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,683
Point it at me.

68
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:08,857
Point it.

69
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:14,029
Now say "Stick 'em up."

70
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:20,410
Stick 'em up.

71
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,789
Perfect.

72
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:35,341
Put the gun down, old timer.

73
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:41,431
Put it down. You couldn't hit me
anyway. Probably shoot the boy.

74
00:12:42,473 --> 00:12:43,850
Leave her be.

75
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,977
- Mama?
- It's all right.

76
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:48,396
It's all right.

77
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:51,607
- Are you deaf?
- Set it on the ground.

78
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,609
Put it down.

79
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:56,112
Set it down! Down.

80
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:00,074
Shut up!

81
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,201
- I vote we take her.
- No.

82
00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:07,290
Then how are we gonna get out of here?
The whole neighborhood's awake!

83
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,836
- We'll take the boy.
- No!

84
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:28,519
Ain't you folks ever heard
of sleeping in?

85
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,252
I got it, sir.

86
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:58,632
Press has been waiting
almost an hour, Red.

87
00:13:58,841 --> 00:13:59,967
I hear you.

88
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:11,228
Yeah, I hear you. I understand.

89
00:14:11,437 --> 00:14:13,021
I understand.

90
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,528
Yeah. No, I'm here.
I'm just listening. Yeah, okay.

91
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:25,867
What'd he say?

92
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:28,036
- Who?
- The governor, Red.

93
00:14:28,203 --> 00:14:32,082
Well, he reminded me
that it's an election year.

94
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,917
- Hi.
- Hi.

95
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:37,379
I hope you don't drink before noon.

96
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:40,340
Oh, no, I don't.

97
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:45,303
The last one we had here,
seemed like she was on a liquid diet.

98
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:48,432
- Last what?
- Secretary.

99
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,100
Penny Monroe.

100
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:54,229
I believe you have me confused.
See, I'm from Huntsville.

101
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:56,898
I was assigned by the governor.

102
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,609
Adler, what is this?

103
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:05,240
It rings a bell. I think they sent
something over about her this morning.

104
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:08,910
- Who did?
- The governor, Red.

105
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:14,332
I'm Sally Gerber, criminologist
with the state prison system.

106
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:18,920
- Tom Adler, Texas Rangers.
- Hi.

107
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:24,926
Well, it's a new procedure. I was
assigned by the governor to work...

108
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:29,556
"Work with state law officials
in all affairs of penal matters...

109
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:33,017
...with the police."
This doesn't say anything...

110
00:15:33,226 --> 00:15:37,897
It includes parole, as well as
penal escape situations.

111
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:40,024
We'll be right there, Marge.

112
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:44,153
They're getting antsy, Red.
You scheduled it.

113
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:50,284
The idea is that an understanding
of case history...

114
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:55,790
...should, in parole situations, help
the subject to avoid habitual traps.

115
00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:58,126
And in penal escape situations...

116
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:02,964
...could identify those selfsame
traps as an aid to apprehension.

117
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:08,803
- Let me tell you, Miss Gerber...
- Sally is fine.

118
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,847
Let me tell you, Sally...

119
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:14,851
...this is not an escape.
This happens to be a manhunt.

120
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:18,521
And no talking around in circles
is gonna fix that.

121
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:22,900
- And what will?
- Us having a nose like a blue tick...

122
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:27,196
...that's a medulla with an antenna,
and a lot of coffee.

123
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:50,219
We got a handful of caps,
and you're shooting water tanks.

124
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,847
He's a smart guy, huh, Phillip?

125
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,651
Goddamn!

126
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:15,869
Okay, boys, that's enough!
The chief's got work to do!

127
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,163
Did the kid say anything?

128
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,624
- Good morning, Red.
- Good morning.

129
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,669
- So, what do you think?
- Looks good.

130
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,921
We're very proud of this baby.

131
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:29,675
Governor ordered it
for the parade in Dallas.

132
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:34,096
- You know President Kennedy's coming?
- Yeah, so I heard.

133
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,892
Latest technology.
Got an oversized engine...

134
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:42,396
...full kitchen, sleeping quarters.

135
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,648
Got room for gun racks.

136
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:48,777
Stove, fridge, even got a phone
to the governor's office.

137
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,029
- Fine piece of machinery.
- And...

138
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:54,241
...once it's back,
it'll be at your disposal.

139
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:58,870
It's perfect for lots of situations.
It's a headquarters on wheels.

140
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:00,914
We'll take it.

141
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:05,126
Chief? Stop taking pictures!
It's just not possible.

142
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:10,507
- Governor's gotta ride in it tomorrow.
- He gave this manhunt top priority.

143
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,760
But, Red-
Listen, you gotta believe me. Red?

144
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,763
- What's your name?
- Dick Suttle, the driver.

145
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,101
- Not anymore. Bradley?
- This man stays with his vehicle.

146
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,938
- You know how to work all the gadgets?
- Oh, yes, sir.

147
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,440
Okay, take a seat.

148
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,275
Excuse me, Red.

149
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:33,905
This here's Bobby Lee.
He's a specialist with the feds.

150
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,116
They want him to tag along.

151
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,623
Red, what am I supposed
to tell the governor?

152
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,919
Well, you tell him that
Miss Sally Gerber over there...

153
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,631
...from his office,
checked me out on this.

154
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,094
Oh, hell.

155
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,144
Hey!

156
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,028
Hello?

157
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,290
You coming or aren't you?

158
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,266
Not a scratch! You hear me, Suttle?

159
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:49,188
On the truck! On the trailer!
And you call me! You call me!

160
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,701
Why the hell we stopping?

161
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:08,040
- You said you had a cousin near here.
- So?

162
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,961
So call him. See if we can shack there
till things cool down.

163
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,700
Why'd he take the keys?

164
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,746
So I won't leave him.

165
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,250
Would you leave him?

166
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,630
Oh, yeah.

167
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,704
He must've moved.

168
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:34,834
Probably couldn't have heard him
anyways, my ear's still bleeding.

169
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,463
- You ever try that shit again-
- What?

170
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,298
What?

171
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,219
You were starting to threaten me.

172
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,013
It ain't a threat.

173
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,349
It's a fact.

174
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,229
Here, kid, take the wheel.

175
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,194
In two seconds, I'm gonna
break your nose.

176
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,487
That's a threat.

177
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:15,750
And that's a fact.

178
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,669
I'm gonna kill you for that.

179
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:23,049
And that's a threat.

180
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:26,636
Beginning to understand
the difference?

181
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:59,668
Phillip, listen up.
I'm gonna run in and get some smokes.

182
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:04,215
- Get beer.
- Here, hold this.

183
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,594
- Point it right between his eyes.
- What the hell?

184
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,265
If he so much as moves,
you pull the trigger.

185
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:16,685
Right here, see?
Put your finger on it.

186
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,402
You're a fucking crazy man.

187
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:30,240
That's a fact.
You're getting the hang of this.

188
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,508
How do? Where's your sodas?

189
00:23:48,675 --> 00:23:53,430
The hot ones are there. The cold ones
are in the back, in the cooler.

190
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:09,112
You ever shot a gun before, boy?

191
00:24:11,948 --> 00:24:13,617
Pow!

192
00:24:14,326 --> 00:24:18,371
- Knock you on your ass.
- Quiet, mister.

193
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,957
No...

194
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:25,295
You ain't never shot no gun before.

195
00:24:25,795 --> 00:24:30,759
Living with three split-tails.
No daddy around.

196
00:24:33,595 --> 00:24:36,639
You'll probably grow up queer,
you know that?

197
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:42,687
Now...

198
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:49,152
...I'm gonna lean up here
real slow and easy.

199
00:24:50,028 --> 00:24:51,362
Okay?

200
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,116
Just so that we can talk.

201
00:24:57,827 --> 00:25:00,288
There we go.

202
00:25:00,788 --> 00:25:04,125
Now we can have a real man-to-man.

203
00:25:06,002 --> 00:25:08,755
You are a man, now, ain't you?

204
00:25:10,506 --> 00:25:15,053
- Will this do it for you?
- This and a carton of Lucky Strikes.

205
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:21,851
Those are some real cute
little underwears you got on there.

206
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:26,731
Your mama sew your name in them?
Initials or anything?

207
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:32,737
Let's see what you got down there.

208
00:25:36,032 --> 00:25:38,326
Kind of puny, ain't it?

209
00:25:40,995 --> 00:25:43,414
The hand is quicker than the eye.

210
00:25:50,546 --> 00:25:56,594
Son of a bitch.
Hell's bells, no shells.

211
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:05,477
Come on up here
a little closer, boy.

212
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:10,524
- Those .38 shells you got up there?
- Yeah.

213
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:12,735
Why don't you give me a box?

214
00:26:15,446 --> 00:26:17,656
Goddamn! Jesus!

215
00:26:20,784 --> 00:26:22,161
Jesus!

216
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:43,348
Here, boy.

217
00:26:50,731 --> 00:26:52,816
All is forgiven, boy.

218
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,449
You best come here, boy.
You know I'm gonna find you.

219
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:06,014
Hey, boy, you best hope
I don't find you.

220
00:28:12,562 --> 00:28:15,523
What're you gonna do? Hit me with it?

221
00:28:21,988 --> 00:28:24,282
But you and me are friends.

222
00:28:52,393 --> 00:28:54,520
You got a phone?

223
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:57,064
No.

224
00:28:58,524 --> 00:29:01,569
Go inside, lie down till we're gone.

225
00:29:11,078 --> 00:29:13,080
Well, you coming?

226
00:29:17,084 --> 00:29:18,586
Get in.

227
00:29:41,942 --> 00:29:47,239
Red, I got a spot on them. A store
outside of Ben Hur, 50 miles from here.

228
00:29:47,447 --> 00:29:51,952
Yeah. Well, move that roadblock
on 28850 miles north.

229
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:56,331
- Figure they got that far?
- I don't know. But they don't either.

230
00:29:56,498 --> 00:30:00,502
They're just glad to be out.
This is a Sunday drive for them.

231
00:30:00,794 --> 00:30:05,507
Sunday drive, I like that. I never
heard you use that one before.

232
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,637
Is something bothering you?

233
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:15,642
It's perhaps premature, but...

234
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:20,105
...do you have an auxiliary roadblock
plan for when they split up?

235
00:30:20,272 --> 00:30:23,066
What makes you so sure
they'll split up?

236
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:26,653
If you got something in your craw,
spit it out.

237
00:30:27,487 --> 00:30:33,410
Their situation is an accommodation.
I don't think they'll be together long.

238
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:37,247
Haynes and Pugh are opposites, right?

239
00:30:37,414 --> 00:30:41,835
Haynes is a criminal's criminal.
Robbery, man-on-man confrontation.

240
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:47,173
Pugh has a rap sheet littered
with manslaughter, you name it.

241
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,136
- They'll split soon.
- What about the hostages?

242
00:30:51,344 --> 00:30:53,930
What are they gonna do?
Flip a coin?

243
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:56,850
It's happened before.

244
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:02,814
It's a dilemma they'll address soon.
That's why we gotta address it now.

245
00:31:02,981 --> 00:31:05,900
We don't have a dilemma.
Neither do they.

246
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:11,406
They'll get rid of one hostage and keep
the other. If they haven't already.

247
00:31:14,784 --> 00:31:21,082
Command, put your roadblock on 288,
north about 50 miles.

248
00:31:23,209 --> 00:31:25,712
That's right, 50 miles.

249
00:31:26,003 --> 00:31:27,296
Uh-huh.

250
00:31:29,132 --> 00:31:31,676
We need to talk, Chief Garnett.

251
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:34,095
You can call me Red.

252
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:35,888
Red...

253
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:39,642
...why are you so hell-bent
on embarrassing me?

254
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:43,396
I'm only hell-bent on one thing.
You get to know me...

255
00:31:43,563 --> 00:31:47,358
...you'll find having a sense of humor
will get you a lot.

256
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:52,238
I have a fine sense of humor.
But I won't be your straight man...

257
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:57,910
...so you can play hero to morons
who think you're Sherlock Holmes.

258
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:02,123
Oh, shit! Damn.

259
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:07,837
Arthur Godfrey said this stuff keeps
you young. I'm not sure it's worth it.

260
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:10,339
So that's my answer?

261
00:32:11,382 --> 00:32:14,343
This is your first time in the field?

262
00:32:14,552 --> 00:32:18,597
I thought so.
What was you expecting anyway?

263
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:21,934
You think I'm some dumb schoolgirl...

264
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:25,104
...who's wandered
into the boys' locker room?

265
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:28,148
You're wrong. I don't mean to boast...

266
00:32:28,357 --> 00:32:33,362
...but I happen to be one of the two
most intelligent people in this fiasco.

267
00:32:33,612 --> 00:32:37,116
I didn't ask that.
I asked what you're expecting.

268
00:32:37,282 --> 00:32:42,913
I expected to be allowed to do the
job assigned to me by the governor.

269
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:48,710
I like the governor. He and I go
quail hunting at least once a year.

270
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:53,298
But he knows that win, lose or draw,
this is my ship. Understand?

271
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:57,261
Yeah, I got that.
You know what that is? That's anarchy.

272
00:32:57,469 --> 00:33:01,473
And I call that horseshit,
to use a cowboy colloquialism.

273
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,978
No, I'll tell you what's horseshit.
Horseshit is responsibility.

274
00:33:06,144 --> 00:33:09,815
That's the guy
who has sleepless nights and ulcers.

275
00:33:10,023 --> 00:33:14,194
If this thing goes bloody,
the governor, he loses a few votes.

276
00:33:14,403 --> 00:33:17,030
Me, I'm the one who...

277
00:33:21,576 --> 00:33:27,541
I'll tell you what. You see me making
a wrong move, go ahead and speak up.

278
00:33:27,749 --> 00:33:30,544
I might not agree, but I'll listen.

279
00:33:30,752 --> 00:33:35,173
As for wounded pride, I'll buy
all the drinks when this is over...

280
00:33:35,382 --> 00:33:40,136
...but right now I got better things
to think about. That fair?

281
00:33:42,013 --> 00:33:43,556
Yeah.

282
00:33:44,641 --> 00:33:48,937
- Good. So who's the other one?
- Other one?

283
00:33:49,854 --> 00:33:52,857
You're one of the two brains.
Who's the other?

284
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:56,861
Haynes. We tested him in prison.

285
00:34:05,537 --> 00:34:06,955
Thank you.

286
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,877
Are you gonna shoot me?

287
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,713
No! Hell, no.

288
00:34:16,798 --> 00:34:19,259
Me and you are friends.

289
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:31,396
If I was choosing a running buddy, I'd
take you over him any day of the week.

290
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:39,070
- We got a positive I.D.?
- Yes, sir. Only the boy is hostage.

291
00:34:39,237 --> 00:34:42,323
Not five minutes ago,
we found this here.

292
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:50,998
Yeah.

293
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:54,835
At least now we know who's in charge.

294
00:34:57,588 --> 00:35:00,883
You ever ridden
in a time machine before?

295
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:05,096
- You have. What do you think this is?
- A car.

296
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:12,353
You're looking at this bass-ackwards.
This is a 20th century time machine.

297
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:15,981
I'm the captain
and you're the navigator.

298
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:24,073
Out there, that's the future.
And back there, well, that's the past.

299
00:35:24,281 --> 00:35:28,536
If life's moving too slow,
to project yourself into the future...

300
00:35:28,702 --> 00:35:31,538
...you step on the gas right here.

301
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:33,624
See?

302
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:40,297
And if you want to slow her down,
you just step on the brake here...

303
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:43,425
...and you slow her down.

304
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:53,018
This is the present, Phillip.
Enjoy it while it lasts.

305
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:08,325
Yes, sir, we're time-traveling
through Texas.

306
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:17,376
We gotta find us a Ford. My daddy
always drove Fords, you know that?

307
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,342
That's an intercom system.

308
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:30,138
Now, you can get and give information
to and from the rear vehicle.

309
00:36:30,347 --> 00:36:34,684
- How's it work?
- Well, you press the power button.

310
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:38,021
But if you've got
the volume turned up...

311
00:36:38,188 --> 00:36:39,856
Bradley, dang it!

312
00:36:40,357 --> 00:36:43,109
You will blow the speakers.

313
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:45,153
My God...

314
00:36:45,362 --> 00:36:47,030
There.

315
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,909
That should put his pecker
in a sling. Sorry, ma'am.

316
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:54,412
Dick humor, unique.
Shouldn't these be roadblocked?

317
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:56,915
Now, in a perfect world...

318
00:36:57,082 --> 00:37:00,960
...we'd lock arms and thrash
the bushes until he turned up.

319
00:37:01,169 --> 00:37:05,006
In a perfect world,
things like this wouldn't happen.

320
00:37:05,215 --> 00:37:07,884
Adler, we're proceeding on FM 1491.

321
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:11,721
Our locals are heading out.
You want to follow them?

322
00:37:12,889 --> 00:37:18,228
No, we'll just keep cruising.
He'll turn up eventually.

323
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,920
Okay, we're gonna do
some car shopping.

324
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:47,048
You ever play cowboys and Indians?

325
00:37:49,091 --> 00:37:50,927
See that Ford sedan?

326
00:37:52,845 --> 00:37:57,099
I want you to sneak over there
like an Indian and take a peek.

327
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,852
See if the keys is in it.

328
00:38:03,105 --> 00:38:05,775
Don't have to if you don't want to.

329
00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:09,945
But I'd appreciate it,
you being the navigator and all.

330
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:22,708
Hey, Phillip! Phillip!

331
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,711
Check for a radio too.

332
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:55,741
It's got keys and a radio. I checked.

333
00:38:56,825 --> 00:38:58,327
Good man.

334
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:01,497
Can we stop at the filling station?

335
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:06,835
- What for?
- Number one.

336
00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:13,717
This here's nature, Phillip.
You just pee over by the tree.

337
00:40:40,845 --> 00:40:43,973
- That's my car!
- Start, you son of a bitch!

338
00:40:58,321 --> 00:41:00,281
Get in the car, Phillip!

339
00:41:01,616 --> 00:41:03,868
Phillip, get in the car!

340
00:41:04,368 --> 00:41:05,912
Jump!

341
00:41:30,478 --> 00:41:34,815
- Goddamn, how many RCs did you drink?
- Four.

342
00:41:43,991 --> 00:41:47,286
Adler, if we get a clean shot,
can we take it?

343
00:41:47,494 --> 00:41:51,498
Red, if they get a clean shot,
should they take it?

344
00:41:57,504 --> 00:41:59,006
No.

345
00:42:02,259 --> 00:42:06,972
I don't want any half-ass sergeant
taking a potshot with a deer rifle.

346
00:42:07,181 --> 00:42:12,060
- Right thing to do, he's got the boy.
- You figure he'll just give up.

347
00:42:13,854 --> 00:42:18,901
- Maybe, maybe not.
- Well, now, there's a safe bet.

348
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:22,029
Well, he's better off now
than he was.

349
00:42:22,237 --> 00:42:26,616
That third eye Pugh is sporting
in the morgue speaks otherwise.

350
00:42:26,825 --> 00:42:29,911
Then why not just shoot to kill?

351
00:42:30,704 --> 00:42:32,539
Now, there's a brainstorm.

352
00:42:32,706 --> 00:42:36,126
The roadblock's got
the stolen vehicle's license.

353
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:41,381
- You still want to go to the farm?
- Yeah. Yeah, I got a hunch.

354
00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:46,595
Never met a brown-eyed Phillip before.

355
00:42:46,803 --> 00:42:50,932
- Who are you named after?
- My daddy.

356
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:55,645
- You and your old man get along?
- Yes, sir.

357
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:59,899
Toss the ball around,
play grab-ass in the yard?

358
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,901
No, sir.

359
00:43:03,403 --> 00:43:05,238
Why the hell not?

360
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:08,408
He ain't around, really.

361
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:12,370
Well, he is or he ain't.

362
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:19,210
When's the last time you saw him?

363
00:43:26,676 --> 00:43:30,096
Me and you got a lot
in common, Phillip.

364
00:43:30,972 --> 00:43:33,433
The both of us is handsome devils.

365
00:43:33,975 --> 00:43:36,019
We both like RC Cola.

366
00:43:36,269 --> 00:43:39,772
And neither one of us got
an old man worth a damn.

367
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:49,365
My mama says he'll come back.
Probably when I'm 10 or so.

368
00:43:50,992 --> 00:43:53,953
Well, she's lying to you,
pure and simple.

369
00:43:54,871 --> 00:43:57,957
All right? He ain't ever coming back.

370
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:05,923
Guys like us, Phillip...

371
00:44:06,132 --> 00:44:08,718
...we gotta be on our own.

372
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,804
Seek foolish destiny.

373
00:44:12,013 --> 00:44:14,807
That sort of thing.

374
00:44:21,105 --> 00:44:24,358
You responsible
for the maintenance on that?

375
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:27,945
That's right.
I'm the full-time driver.

376
00:44:28,154 --> 00:44:32,158
- What?
- It's slipping a bit going into second.

377
00:44:32,324 --> 00:44:36,203
Seems like somebody's been
heavy-footed with the clutch.

378
00:44:36,412 --> 00:44:39,707
I'd put that on a list if I was you.

379
00:44:44,211 --> 00:44:45,838
Well...

380
00:44:46,213 --> 00:44:49,466
...ain't no bodies here, thank God.

381
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:53,762
- You got the keys to this vehicle?
- No.

382
00:44:54,763 --> 00:44:58,392
- See if we got a pry bar in the car.
- Yes, sir.

383
00:45:05,691 --> 00:45:07,317
Here you go, Red.

384
00:45:07,526 --> 00:45:11,613
- You might want to wait in the boat.
- Please.

385
00:45:22,207 --> 00:45:24,793
Well, there's our bureaucrat.

386
00:45:37,347 --> 00:45:41,643
Nice to know the boy's
in good hands. Here.

387
00:45:41,852 --> 00:45:44,813
- I don't want-
- Gallows humor, Sally.

388
00:45:45,021 --> 00:45:48,233
Without it,
we'd all be losing our lunch.

389
00:45:49,693 --> 00:45:52,988
- Want some water?
- No.

390
00:46:20,265 --> 00:46:23,184
You ready to get into some britches?

391
00:46:23,393 --> 00:46:25,687
All right, then, let's go.

392
00:46:29,107 --> 00:46:34,445
First, we gotta come up with some
a. k. a.'s. You know, fake identities.

393
00:46:34,654 --> 00:46:38,408
Names to call each other
when we're around other folks.

394
00:46:38,616 --> 00:46:41,286
You go ahead and you think one up.

395
00:46:41,452 --> 00:46:44,455
- Whatever name you want.
- Any name I want?

396
00:46:44,622 --> 00:46:46,165
Any name you want.

397
00:46:51,963 --> 00:46:55,508
Well, hello there,
and welcome to Friendly's.

398
00:46:55,717 --> 00:46:58,136
Looks like he needs some pants.

399
00:46:58,344 --> 00:47:03,307
As a matter of fact, shoes and new
skivvies too. He'll tell you his size.

400
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:05,643
Go with the lady, Buzz.

401
00:47:06,227 --> 00:47:10,439
- Buzz.
- Buzz. Go with the lady.

402
00:47:10,648 --> 00:47:13,526
Buzz, what a cute little name.
Like a bee.

403
00:47:45,474 --> 00:47:49,436
Oh, look, a friendly ghost.
Say "Boo."

404
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,772
Boo.

405
00:47:51,981 --> 00:47:57,194
Not very scary. But you'll have
a whole year to work on it.

406
00:47:57,361 --> 00:48:01,365
It's a good price too.
What did you go as this year?

407
00:48:01,782 --> 00:48:03,492
A bandit.

408
00:48:20,342 --> 00:48:22,219
Oh, shit!

409
00:48:22,636 --> 00:48:24,179
- Pete.
- Yeah?

410
00:48:24,388 --> 00:48:26,765
This is Terrance. I think I got it.

411
00:48:30,811 --> 00:48:34,314
- What do you think?
- Look good.

412
00:48:37,067 --> 00:48:40,487
Will that be all for you today, sir?

413
00:48:43,281 --> 00:48:47,244
You folks are about the grinningest
bunch I ever seen.

414
00:48:52,749 --> 00:48:55,544
Mr. Willits holds
a contest every month.

415
00:48:55,752 --> 00:48:59,756
The friendliest employee gets
a $20 bonus.

416
00:49:07,097 --> 00:49:09,432
Pete, I'm all set down here. You?

417
00:49:10,475 --> 00:49:15,438
Copacetic. Let's just keep him tied up
till the state boys get here.

418
00:49:15,605 --> 00:49:18,316
The hunt continues for Butch Haynes...

419
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:22,278
...who escaped from the security unit
over in Huntsville.

420
00:49:22,487 --> 00:49:28,076
Haynes, 6'1", 185 pounds with
brown hair, is armed and dangerous.

421
00:49:28,284 --> 00:49:31,121
- He was last seen in...
- Here are the clothes.

422
00:49:31,287 --> 00:49:36,459
Buzz has his heart set on a Halloween
costume for next year. It's half off.

423
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:42,215
Four miles south of Desdemona.
Complicating attempts to catch him...

424
00:49:42,423 --> 00:49:46,928
...Haynes has an 8-year-old
boy with him as hostage.

425
00:49:47,136 --> 00:49:50,473
Authorities have found
the slain body...

426
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,227
We'll get it next time.
Go wait in the car, son.

427
00:49:54,435 --> 00:49:58,648
Hostage taken by Haynes
and his fellow escapee, Terry Pugh.

428
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:02,485
Billings ' body was found
in the trunk of his car.

429
00:50:02,652 --> 00:50:05,530
The car, used in the prison escape...

430
00:50:05,988 --> 00:50:10,827
...was discarded near a farm where
another car was stolen this morning.

431
00:50:11,035 --> 00:50:13,788
The stolen car is a yellow Ford sedan.

432
00:50:13,996 --> 00:50:18,376
Anyone who spots it should contact
law enforcement offiicials.

433
00:50:18,584 --> 00:50:21,837
As we reported earlier,
the body of Terry Pugh...

434
00:50:22,004 --> 00:50:25,383
You're truly the friendliest clerk
I ever met.

435
00:50:29,136 --> 00:50:32,473
Thank you for shopping Friendly's.

436
00:50:32,682 --> 00:50:35,601
Copy, 149, hold your 20.

437
00:51:29,238 --> 00:51:30,781
Damn!

438
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,747
What the-
What the hell?!

439
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,258
He's coming back!

440
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:58,308
Get out of there!
We can't lose both vehicles!

441
00:52:00,811 --> 00:52:04,022
I knew something was wrong
from the get-go.

442
00:52:26,461 --> 00:52:29,172
Look, he left his little boy!

443
00:52:33,468 --> 00:52:36,221
He's got the Casper costume!
He stole it!

444
00:52:43,645 --> 00:52:47,482
Buzz, you little shit!
Shoplifting is a crime!

445
00:52:49,525 --> 00:52:51,945
Up to you, Buzz!

446
00:52:58,826 --> 00:53:02,497
You'll never get away with this,
you little mister!

447
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,377
You ain't so friendly.

448
00:53:36,864 --> 00:53:40,576
Take them nasty skivvies off,
put these jeans on.

449
00:53:44,705 --> 00:53:48,918
- What do you got there?
- A ghost suit.

450
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:50,711
From the store?

451
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:53,422
You kiped it?

452
00:53:57,635 --> 00:54:00,346
Well, hell, Phillip, put it on.

453
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,057
You ain't mad?

454
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:09,480
Let's understand each other.
Stealing's wrong, okay?

455
00:54:09,688 --> 00:54:14,109
But if there's something you need bad
and you ain't got the money...

456
00:54:14,276 --> 00:54:17,071
...it's okay to take a loaner
on the item.

457
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:20,699
It's what you call
an exception to the rule.

458
00:54:23,744 --> 00:54:25,287
What's wrong?

459
00:54:26,205 --> 00:54:27,915
Nothing.

460
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:32,628
You don't want to get undressed
in front of me?

461
00:54:35,464 --> 00:54:39,218
You embarrassed because I might
see your pecker?

462
00:54:41,261 --> 00:54:42,930
It's...

463
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:44,681
...puny.

464
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:48,769
- What?
- It's puny.

465
00:54:50,937 --> 00:54:53,106
Who told you that?

466
00:54:55,942 --> 00:54:57,736
Let me see.

467
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:03,700
Go on, I'll shoot you straight.

468
00:55:07,245 --> 00:55:11,208
Hell, no, Phillip.
It's a good size for a boy your age.

469
00:55:16,004 --> 00:55:17,839
Here they come.

470
00:55:41,446 --> 00:55:44,783
He bought some tape, rope,
and clothes for the kid.

471
00:55:44,991 --> 00:55:48,411
The kid could have gotten away,
but he didn't.

472
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:52,040
- Probably scared to death.
- Well, one more thing.

473
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:57,086
- The kid stole a Halloween outfit.
- So they're a team.

474
00:55:57,295 --> 00:56:01,758
With a pit stop in Noodle,
they're heading for the Panhandle.

475
00:56:01,966 --> 00:56:05,178
- There's more roads than people there.
- How?

476
00:56:05,345 --> 00:56:08,931
Poor counties. They half-finish
a road, start another.

477
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,268
If anybody knows them back roads,
it's Red.

478
00:56:13,186 --> 00:56:14,687
Okay...

479
00:56:16,981 --> 00:56:18,566
...so...

480
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:24,780
...I'm Robert Haynes. Everybody calls
me Butch. I was born in Amarillo...

481
00:56:24,989 --> 00:56:28,451
...but grew up in the French Quarter
in New Orleans.

482
00:56:28,659 --> 00:56:31,120
What's she doing, Red?

483
00:56:32,038 --> 00:56:34,415
I killed a man when I was 8.

484
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,377
How did you kill him?

485
00:56:38,669 --> 00:56:43,382
Shot him with a .38. There was always
one lying around the dance hall.

486
00:56:43,591 --> 00:56:48,054
That's what they called it,
but it was a brothel. We lived there.

487
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:52,892
- What did the authorities do?
- Victim was wanted by the locals...

488
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:57,396
...so the whole thing got swept
under the carpet, Cajun-style.

489
00:56:57,605 --> 00:57:00,566
They didn't even send him to the juvie?

490
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,904
Put me in school. I was three
years behind, but I catch up.

491
00:57:05,196 --> 00:57:09,408
- Things are going pretty good now.
- Yeah, they are for a while.

492
00:57:09,617 --> 00:57:13,579
- And when I'm 12, Mama dies.
- What happened?

493
00:57:13,787 --> 00:57:18,626
Delilah Jane Haynes hung herself
in the bathroom of the whorehouse.

494
00:57:18,834 --> 00:57:22,254
Post-mortem check uncovered
last-stage syphilis.

495
00:57:22,504 --> 00:57:26,091
- Where's your father?
- Nobody knows where he is.

496
00:57:26,258 --> 00:57:31,138
Ditched when I was 6.
He was a small-time felon.

497
00:57:31,346 --> 00:57:34,433
Popped back up after Mama died.

498
00:57:34,641 --> 00:57:38,854
He'd just been put on parole,
so he moves us back to Amarillo.

499
00:57:39,062 --> 00:57:43,609
- A year later, I'm back in trouble.
- Kill somebody else?

500
00:57:45,861 --> 00:57:50,115
Saw a Ford coupe I couldn't resist.
So I took her for a spin.

501
00:57:50,532 --> 00:57:54,286
- Hell, that ain't no big deal.
- That's what I thought.

502
00:57:54,453 --> 00:57:59,875
But the judge didn't. I got four years
in Gatesville, toughest juvie in Texas.

503
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:05,255
That's where he learned to be
a criminal. We've seen that before.

504
00:58:08,675 --> 00:58:12,053
Butch, why don't you tell us
where you're headed...

505
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,556
...and save us some trouble.

506
00:58:14,764 --> 00:58:17,809
See, you missed it.
Because where I'm going...

507
00:58:18,018 --> 00:58:21,897
...isn't near as important
as why I'm going there.

508
00:58:22,105 --> 00:58:25,025
Shit! Because I'm running,
they're chasing...

509
00:58:25,191 --> 00:58:29,154
...I'd just as soon go north,
as south, as east, as west.

510
00:58:29,362 --> 00:58:31,323
It's a fun little game...

511
00:58:31,489 --> 00:58:35,744
...but right now, Haynes doesn't have
any idea where he's headed.

512
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:44,461
Hold your pointing finger
along the line of the road, okay?

513
00:58:44,669 --> 00:58:49,215
Okay, you got three lines
on a finger, don't you?

514
00:58:49,424 --> 00:58:54,762
Each one's an inch.
So how many inches to Childress?

515
00:58:56,514 --> 00:58:57,849
One...

516
00:58:58,016 --> 00:58:59,642
...two...

517
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:02,020
Six.

518
00:59:04,022 --> 00:59:07,066
You're a hell of a navigator, Phillip!

519
00:59:07,275 --> 00:59:09,902
A lot smarter than Terry.

520
00:59:10,486 --> 00:59:14,574
Of course, who you gonna brag
to about that?

521
00:59:16,701 --> 00:59:18,494
Lookie there!

522
00:59:20,955 --> 00:59:25,042
- What is it?
- It's kind of like a silver whale.

523
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:29,380
And there's people inside,
just like old Jonah in the Bible.

524
00:59:33,259 --> 00:59:37,096
Go like this,
maybe they'll honk back at us.

525
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:44,770
- What do you think?
- Well, okay, do it.

526
00:59:50,443 --> 00:59:52,737
The boy stole a Halloween costume?

527
00:59:56,323 --> 00:59:59,577
- Which one?
- It was Casper the Friendly Ghost.

528
01:00:00,953 --> 01:00:03,622
- That was them passing us!
- What?!

529
01:00:03,789 --> 01:00:05,791
- That was them!
- Turn around!

530
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,459
Bradley, turn around!

531
01:00:29,857 --> 01:00:34,445
It's not safe to do more than 65
with this much load.

532
01:00:37,406 --> 01:00:38,907
They're coming fast.

533
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:41,910
Get down in the seat
and lay down.

534
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:45,289
- Why?
- Hell, I don't know.

535
01:00:45,455 --> 01:00:46,999
Because I said so.

536
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:50,168
You're burning her up!

537
01:00:50,335 --> 01:00:51,545
Hold on.

538
01:00:54,006 --> 01:00:55,924
- Come on!
- Take that wide!

539
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:18,405
- What're you doing?
- I'm following the fugitive, fool!

540
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,741
What are you doing now?

541
01:01:23,618 --> 01:01:24,911
Uh, Red...

542
01:01:26,371 --> 01:01:27,414
Shit.

543
01:01:34,296 --> 01:01:35,338
Red?

544
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:42,846
Red's gonna be pissed now.

545
01:01:55,191 --> 01:01:56,734
Oh, God!

546
01:02:00,822 --> 01:02:02,699
Are you trying to kill us?!

547
01:02:02,866 --> 01:02:04,367
Shit.

548
01:02:05,451 --> 01:02:06,869
Yeah.

549
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,624
- Oh, my God.
- Idiot!

550
01:02:31,436 --> 01:02:35,565
Red, they wanna know
if the boy looked okay.

551
01:02:35,773 --> 01:02:39,110
- He was laughing and waving.
- Don't tell them that.

552
01:02:39,318 --> 01:02:40,695
No.

553
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,951
- They said the boy looked A-Okay.
- Well, that's great.

554
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:49,912
He'll be fine, Mrs. Perry.

555
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,873
This'll be over before you know it.

556
01:02:53,082 --> 01:02:57,586
You'll be home with your boy.
I promise.

557
01:02:58,421 --> 01:03:01,465
I want you to know
that I've okayed the use...

558
01:03:01,674 --> 01:03:06,554
...of a new high-tech mobile home
from which to conduct this manhunt.

559
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:12,268
It's an amazingly futuristic piece
of law enforcement equipment.

560
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:24,613
Started this road 20 years ago.
Still ain't finished.

561
01:03:30,035 --> 01:03:33,163
It appears to me
we got a decision to make.

562
01:03:38,627 --> 01:03:40,003
It's up to you.

563
01:03:40,212 --> 01:03:44,133
We can backtrack to the highway
or we can try it on foot.

564
01:03:44,299 --> 01:03:46,343
Where are we going?

565
01:03:53,684 --> 01:03:55,769
It's Alaska, Phillip.

566
01:03:56,228 --> 01:03:58,355
Last of the wild frontier.

567
01:03:58,855 --> 01:04:01,733
- It's pretty.
- It's beautiful.

568
01:04:02,526 --> 01:04:06,238
- You ever been there?
- No.

569
01:04:07,072 --> 01:04:09,741
I just got the one postcard.

570
01:04:10,993 --> 01:04:13,829
But anyhoo,
back to our present dilemma.

571
01:04:14,037 --> 01:04:17,416
- You feel like a hike?
- How far?

572
01:04:17,707 --> 01:04:19,751
Can't be more than, say...

573
01:04:20,502 --> 01:04:22,003
...1500 miles.

574
01:04:27,509 --> 01:04:31,054
You're probably right.
Go give our supplies a check.

575
01:04:40,522 --> 01:04:46,194
- What's it look like?
- A soda, some gum, and half a MoonPie.

576
01:04:47,237 --> 01:04:50,115
Rations for one, at best.

577
01:04:51,282 --> 01:04:52,701
Come on.

578
01:05:09,801 --> 01:05:11,094
Red!

579
01:05:11,261 --> 01:05:16,391
The governor insists on having the
trailer back for the parade tomorrow.

580
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:21,312
Tell him to come get it.

581
01:05:21,646 --> 01:05:23,147
Yes, sir.

582
01:05:30,571 --> 01:05:34,659
- Where are we going?
- We're going trick-or-treating.

583
01:05:40,081 --> 01:05:43,876
- What's the matter?
- We're not allowed to trick-or-treat.

584
01:05:44,335 --> 01:05:45,503
Huh?

585
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,838
My mama doesn't allow it.

586
01:05:48,923 --> 01:05:52,802
- Trick-or-treating? Why not?
- Against our religion.

587
01:05:53,177 --> 01:05:57,348
It's against your-
What kind of foolishness is that?

588
01:05:58,766 --> 01:06:00,434
Jehovah's Witness.

589
01:06:08,067 --> 01:06:10,361
Now, Phillip, I'm asking you.

590
01:06:10,569 --> 01:06:13,447
I ain't asking your mother or Jehovah.

591
01:06:13,781 --> 01:06:16,617
You wanna go trick-or-treating or not?

592
01:06:41,809 --> 01:06:45,020
Okay, all you gotta do
is knock on the door.

593
01:06:45,229 --> 01:06:49,399
And when they answer it,
you say, "Trick or treat." Got it?

594
01:07:03,956 --> 01:07:06,208
Now, wait till they come.

595
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:13,298
Now, Phillip.

596
01:07:13,507 --> 01:07:15,342
Trick or treat.

597
01:07:15,676 --> 01:07:19,346
If you ain't the cutest little ghost
I ever did see.

598
01:07:19,638 --> 01:07:22,516
- Say it again.
- Trick or treat, ma'am.

599
01:07:22,682 --> 01:07:27,104
Since Halloween was yesterday,
you're gonna have to trick me.

600
01:07:27,312 --> 01:07:32,609
And you missed them caramel
popcorn balls I made up special.

601
01:07:37,364 --> 01:07:39,449
Just wait right here.

602
01:07:40,867 --> 01:07:42,410
Perfect.

603
01:08:09,646 --> 01:08:12,232
- What do you say, Phillip?
- Thank you.

604
01:08:23,952 --> 01:08:28,164
Never underestimate the kindness
of the common man, Phillip.

605
01:08:29,165 --> 01:08:31,501
You sure there's no meat in there?

606
01:08:31,668 --> 01:08:36,506
Spam maybe? Vienna sausage,
anything like that?

607
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:38,257
Nothing.

608
01:08:44,096 --> 01:08:49,018
- Can you make some mustard sandwiches?
- Yes, sir.

609
01:08:49,185 --> 01:08:51,145
Well, go to it.

610
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:07,161
Here, you can spread it with that.

611
01:09:11,999 --> 01:09:15,628
Yeah, that one's mine.

612
01:09:53,415 --> 01:09:55,167
Be right back.

613
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:07,596
Don't be stingy with that mustard, now.

614
01:10:21,485 --> 01:10:24,571
Hold it right there. You can go.

615
01:10:32,579 --> 01:10:33,622
Butch!

616
01:10:34,748 --> 01:10:36,082
Butch!

617
01:10:37,209 --> 01:10:40,170
- Phillip!
- Butch, help!

618
01:10:42,714 --> 01:10:45,634
- Grab the kids. Quick! Run!
- Phillip!

619
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,427
Forget the car, Bob.

620
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:52,724
It's only got 1000 miles on it!

621
01:10:53,433 --> 01:10:55,769
- Phillip, hit the brake!
- Butch!

622
01:11:02,817 --> 01:11:04,194
Oh, my!

623
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,293
- Bad brakes.
- That was close.

624
01:11:23,087 --> 01:11:24,839
Bob Fielder.

625
01:11:25,256 --> 01:11:26,507
Edgar Poe.

626
01:11:28,509 --> 01:11:33,222
That scared me silly. You know,
I just had her a couple months.

627
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:37,435
- Yeah, she's a beaut, all right.
- Yeah?

628
01:11:37,602 --> 01:11:41,522
Bob, what with my brake problem,
I'd appreciate a lift.

629
01:11:45,109 --> 01:11:48,488
Me and my boy live
about five miles up the road.

630
01:11:48,696 --> 01:11:51,449
- I could pick up the car when I-
- Butch!

631
01:11:57,955 --> 01:11:59,582
The brake, Phillip!

632
01:11:59,749 --> 01:12:01,417
Step on the brake!

633
01:12:08,049 --> 01:12:11,552
Hell of a job, Phillip!
Never had a doubt!

634
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:26,108
You all right? I'd be happy
to move the kids there.

635
01:12:26,358 --> 01:12:30,696
No trouble at all, Bob.
No trouble at all.

636
01:12:33,324 --> 01:12:34,533
Thank you, sir.

637
01:12:41,999 --> 01:12:44,543
All right, thank you.

638
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:47,046
Can I see your license, sir?

639
01:12:47,254 --> 01:12:50,174
All right, thank you very much.
Bye, now.

640
01:12:53,677 --> 01:12:58,015
- Can I see your license, please?
- What's the problem, officer?

641
01:13:02,519 --> 01:13:06,190
We got an escaped convict.
Have a nice trip.

642
01:13:06,356 --> 01:13:08,025
Okay, thanks.

643
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:30,172
- We got two cars at your disposal.
- They got two cars they can give us.

644
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:35,552
Have them hold tight. I think we got
the best seat in the house right here.

645
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:39,848
Tell those roadblocks to call in dogs
and move north.

646
01:13:40,056 --> 01:13:45,520
We'll check every road and every farm
between San Angelo and Sweetwater.

647
01:13:46,062 --> 01:13:48,356
There's my Geritol.

648
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:11,880
- Patsy, look at what you're doing.
- Oh, no. Here.

649
01:14:12,088 --> 01:14:13,965
Look at what you did!

650
01:14:14,257 --> 01:14:17,635
What is wrong with you?
I told you! Look at me.

651
01:14:17,802 --> 01:14:22,557
I told you twice not to jump up
and down, didn't I? Now, didn't I?

652
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:26,477
It's all over your father's new car!

653
01:14:27,103 --> 01:14:30,690
Just get your bottom there
and stay, both of you!

654
01:14:34,777 --> 01:14:38,656
It's okay, sugar.
Daddy still loves you.

655
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:44,412
- So much for the new car smell.
- All right!

656
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:48,624
This'll be fine right here, Bob.

657
01:14:55,339 --> 01:14:58,801
But I do have one more favor to ask.

658
01:15:15,067 --> 01:15:17,820
Just a loaner, Bob. Not to worry.

659
01:15:18,487 --> 01:15:20,614
You'll get her back.

660
01:15:24,368 --> 01:15:29,790
It's new, so if you'd keep it under 45
for 500 miles, I'd appreciate it.

661
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,668
You know I will, Bob.

662
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,678
- They look funny.
- Maybe.

663
01:15:42,887 --> 01:15:44,972
But Bob did the right thing.

664
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:47,516
What if he'd put up a fight?

665
01:15:48,183 --> 01:15:52,354
I might've had to shoot him.
Where would that family be then?

666
01:15:52,813 --> 01:15:55,274
No, Bob's a fine family man.

667
01:15:55,441 --> 01:15:58,777
That's about the best thing
a fella can hope to be.

668
01:16:03,282 --> 01:16:05,868
Hold on, we're almost there.

669
01:16:09,288 --> 01:16:11,123
Keep together.

670
01:16:16,253 --> 01:16:19,214
Got through at Aspermont.
Coerced a motorist.

671
01:16:19,673 --> 01:16:24,636
Damn. Call Amarillo and tell them we
got a notion they're headed that way.

672
01:16:24,803 --> 01:16:25,846
Okay, Red.

673
01:16:26,013 --> 01:16:31,351
Tell you the truth, I hope they make it
over the border. Let the feds take it.

674
01:16:32,185 --> 01:16:36,356
I got things I could be doing.
I'm hungry. We got any food?

675
01:16:36,773 --> 01:16:40,068
- I don't know. Let me look.
- Sir...?

676
01:16:40,652 --> 01:16:45,657
- Red, they got T-bones in the fridge.
- Those were ordered special for...

677
01:16:45,866 --> 01:16:49,286
- And Tater Tots!
- He might not approve of this.

678
01:16:49,452 --> 01:16:51,079
That so?

679
01:16:52,914 --> 01:16:55,876
I do like Tater Tots.

680
01:16:56,626 --> 01:17:00,380
Can't find a coon-ass waltz
to save my ass.

681
01:17:04,092 --> 01:17:09,014
That stuff you told me about not
trick-or-treating because of Jehovah...

682
01:17:09,222 --> 01:17:11,558
...was you pulling my leg?

683
01:17:11,766 --> 01:17:13,143
No, sir.

684
01:17:14,436 --> 01:17:18,481
- What else ain't you supposed to do?
- We don't get Christmas.

685
01:17:18,648 --> 01:17:23,069
- You're shitting me.
- No birthdays, nor parties neither.

686
01:17:24,112 --> 01:17:27,490
You've never been to a carnival
neither, have you?

687
01:17:27,657 --> 01:17:29,033
No.

688
01:17:29,367 --> 01:17:33,371
- Cotton candy?
- Seen that once. It's...

689
01:17:33,705 --> 01:17:34,747
...red.

690
01:17:34,998 --> 01:17:37,500
No, it's not, it's pink.

691
01:17:37,667 --> 01:17:39,627
Never ate none though.

692
01:17:39,794 --> 01:17:43,047
- Roller coasters?
- Seen pictures.

693
01:17:46,467 --> 01:17:52,056
You have a goddamn American right to
eat cotton candy, ride roller coasters.

694
01:17:52,473 --> 01:17:53,599
I do?

695
01:17:54,475 --> 01:17:56,519
Hell yes, you do.

696
01:18:04,318 --> 01:18:08,656
Faster, Butch! Faster!

697
01:18:14,328 --> 01:18:16,455
Faster!

698
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:19,834
Yeah!

699
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:24,422
Come on, Butch, faster!

700
01:18:36,434 --> 01:18:37,768
Yes, sir.

701
01:18:37,977 --> 01:18:40,521
- You fellas dig in now.
- All right.

702
01:18:44,692 --> 01:18:46,110
It's hot.

703
01:18:53,033 --> 01:18:56,203
You think you're pretty smart, now,
don't you?

704
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:57,663
Excuse me?

705
01:18:58,872 --> 01:19:02,626
Well, you ain't smart,
but, goddamn, you are pretty.

706
01:19:03,502 --> 01:19:04,545
Please.

707
01:19:04,753 --> 01:19:10,926
I think business and pleasure should
just naturally mix, don't you?

708
01:19:13,262 --> 01:19:17,057
I mean, take me. I love my work.

709
01:19:17,683 --> 01:19:19,893
So did Hitler.

710
01:19:20,143 --> 01:19:23,188
Goddamn, you got a mouth on you.

711
01:19:23,355 --> 01:19:25,774
How do you like your steak, Sally?

712
01:19:26,233 --> 01:19:27,734
Rare.

713
01:19:27,901 --> 01:19:32,906
Good. I'll wipe its ass, herd it
through, and you can tear off a slab.

714
01:19:33,115 --> 01:19:36,368
On second thought, medium rare.

715
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:41,164
I don't care who you work for.

716
01:19:41,331 --> 01:19:45,460
You're here for one reason only.
You hear me?

717
01:19:49,631 --> 01:19:51,925
Anything else, chief?

718
01:19:52,926 --> 01:19:54,261
Yeah.

719
01:19:54,845 --> 01:19:58,306
You're in my office. Get out.

720
01:20:13,029 --> 01:20:15,031
Here you go.

721
01:20:17,325 --> 01:20:21,496
Thank you, Father, for your
bountiful nature and goodness.

722
01:20:22,622 --> 01:20:23,915
Amen.

723
01:20:24,082 --> 01:20:26,000
Now, dig in, Buzz.

724
01:20:26,167 --> 01:20:29,462
We call him that
because he eats like a buzzard.

725
01:20:30,255 --> 01:20:33,383
If it's dead, he'll swoop and chow.

726
01:20:43,059 --> 01:20:44,852
You Dottie?

727
01:20:45,019 --> 01:20:47,730
Eileen. Dottie died.

728
01:20:47,939 --> 01:20:50,692
Her son runs the place, but...

729
01:20:50,858 --> 01:20:53,277
...he ain't never here.

730
01:20:54,112 --> 01:20:55,571
Never?

731
01:20:55,780 --> 01:21:01,411
He leaves around 4. You know,
not much traffic after lunch.

732
01:21:17,552 --> 01:21:20,846
If you need me,
I'll be right over here.

733
01:21:37,321 --> 01:21:39,448
Eat your food.

734
01:22:26,078 --> 01:22:30,123
- Buzz, you can eat mine if you want.
- No, thank you.

735
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:33,961
Very polite.

736
01:22:35,128 --> 01:22:38,632
Well, I try hard but, you know,
since his mama died...

737
01:22:38,799 --> 01:22:40,592
My mama's not dead.

738
01:22:44,388 --> 01:22:48,475
Okay, Buzz, go on out in
the parking lot and chuck some rocks.

739
01:23:04,449 --> 01:23:08,411
So is she dead or not?

740
01:23:09,996 --> 01:23:13,333
Well, his biological mother is alive.

741
01:23:13,667 --> 01:23:17,170
She gave him up for adoption
to me and my wife.

742
01:23:17,879 --> 01:23:20,799
My dead wife, that is.

743
01:23:21,007 --> 01:23:24,803
She is... was Phil...

744
01:23:25,011 --> 01:23:29,349
Buzz's stepmother. So she's his mom.

745
01:23:29,557 --> 01:23:31,184
Was his mom.

746
01:23:31,392 --> 01:23:32,769
Stepmom.

747
01:23:33,937 --> 01:23:36,064
But she's dead.

748
01:23:36,981 --> 01:23:39,567
I am so sorry.

749
01:24:18,689 --> 01:24:20,191
Nosy little fella.

750
01:24:26,405 --> 01:24:28,282
Get in the car.

751
01:24:46,759 --> 01:24:48,886
You mad at me?

752
01:24:49,136 --> 01:24:50,554
No.

753
01:24:53,098 --> 01:24:55,559
You kissed her, huh?

754
01:24:56,352 --> 01:24:58,229
Just barely.

755
01:25:01,106 --> 01:25:02,608
Why?

756
01:25:04,109 --> 01:25:06,487
Because it feels good.

757
01:25:06,695 --> 01:25:10,449
- Ain't you seen your mama kiss a man?
- No.

758
01:25:15,287 --> 01:25:17,414
You kissed her backside, huh?

759
01:25:20,334 --> 01:25:23,504
Well, it's kind of hard
to explain, I...

760
01:25:24,296 --> 01:25:26,965
I know how it must've looked.

761
01:25:30,385 --> 01:25:34,431
- Hell, I don't know how it looked.
- Do you love her?

762
01:25:35,098 --> 01:25:38,227
- Who?
- The lady who cooked the hamburger.

763
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:42,230
Yeah, Phillip.

764
01:25:42,397 --> 01:25:44,107
Yeah, I love her.

765
01:25:47,653 --> 01:25:50,238
I kissed her butt, didn't I?

766
01:26:18,183 --> 01:26:20,226
If things go our way...

767
01:26:20,435 --> 01:26:23,855
...we'll be in Alaska
in four or five days.

768
01:26:26,107 --> 01:26:28,526
Get the jump on winter.

769
01:26:37,452 --> 01:26:38,953
What's wrong?

770
01:26:39,871 --> 01:26:42,415
I want to go home.

771
01:26:43,374 --> 01:26:48,213
- Then why didn't you stay at the store?
- Because.

772
01:26:48,379 --> 01:26:52,175
- Because why?
- Because I stole.

773
01:26:52,884 --> 01:26:56,220
They'll put me in jail.
I'll probably go to hell.

774
01:26:59,057 --> 01:27:01,476
Same difference, Phillip.

775
01:27:01,684 --> 01:27:03,227
Same difference.

776
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:10,109
We'll get you home soon.

777
01:27:10,735 --> 01:27:12,320
I swear, okay?

778
01:27:18,659 --> 01:27:20,870
- Butch?
- Yeah.

779
01:27:23,581 --> 01:27:25,333
I can drive.

780
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:33,382
Done proved that, ain't you? There's
lots and lots of stuff you can do.

781
01:27:33,549 --> 01:27:38,554
Lots and lots of stuff.
Reach in that glove box there.

782
01:27:40,264 --> 01:27:43,476
See if Bob's got a notepad
or something.

783
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,395
Good old Bob.

784
01:27:47,104 --> 01:27:49,857
- Can you write?
- I can print.

785
01:27:50,066 --> 01:27:51,650
Good enough.

786
01:27:51,859 --> 01:27:57,573
Make a list of everything you ever
wanted to do but wasn't allowed to.

787
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:59,200
Like what?

788
01:28:01,493 --> 01:28:03,204
Like...

789
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:05,414
...cotton candy.

790
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:08,250
Cotton candy.

791
01:28:09,627 --> 01:28:12,129
Hell, I don't know, it's your list.

792
01:28:18,552 --> 01:28:21,013
- Butch?
- Yeah.

793
01:28:21,221 --> 01:28:23,932
How do you spell "rocket ship"?

794
01:28:27,561 --> 01:28:31,064
I'll let those fellas
get a little more shut-eye.

795
01:28:31,273 --> 01:28:34,234
A few more hours of it, anyway.

796
01:28:34,443 --> 01:28:39,656
We'll get the patrol cars in
the morning and head up the Panhandle.

797
01:28:42,868 --> 01:28:45,996
Does that bring back any memories?

798
01:28:51,918 --> 01:28:54,338
You got a file on me too?

799
01:28:54,546 --> 01:28:59,843
Hey, it's the '60s, Red.
They got a file on everybody, right?

800
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:04,598
Just because it's written down,
that don't mean it's true.

801
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:07,100
True, absolutely.

802
01:29:07,267 --> 01:29:11,271
But you did work as county
sheriff in Amarillo and Austin...

803
01:29:11,438 --> 01:29:14,232
...before you became a Ranger.

804
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:16,985
Right so far?

805
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:22,490
Haynes' juvenile court record
lists you as amicus curiae:

806
01:29:22,699 --> 01:29:28,288
Evidence given by a non-party with
the intention of swaying the judge.

807
01:29:31,374 --> 01:29:36,713
Usually it comes in written form,
but there was no copy attached.

808
01:29:42,302 --> 01:29:44,053
Silence.

809
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:49,392
Okay. At least tell me why Haynes
did four years for a joyride, huh?

810
01:29:49,559 --> 01:29:54,439
What about probation?
The boy had a home, a father.

811
01:29:55,273 --> 01:29:57,525
What do your files say about him?

812
01:29:58,192 --> 01:30:03,531
It says he was a thief who did some
time, got out and stayed pretty clean.

813
01:30:04,407 --> 01:30:07,285
Your precious files are wrong.

814
01:30:09,579 --> 01:30:10,913
Okay.

815
01:30:11,873 --> 01:30:13,583
So tell me the truth.

816
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:22,592
Haynes' old man,
he was a career criminal...

817
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,762
...with a soft spot for whores.
One thing's for sure...

818
01:30:26,971 --> 01:30:33,060
...he beat the hell out of anything he
ever came across, screwed or fathered.

819
01:30:33,269 --> 01:30:34,770
If I...

820
01:30:36,522 --> 01:30:39,108
If the judge had let
the boy go with him...

821
01:30:39,275 --> 01:30:43,612
...he'd have a rap sheet as long
as your arm within a year.

822
01:30:46,032 --> 01:30:48,576
Gatesville isn't so bad.

823
01:30:49,118 --> 01:30:53,706
I've known kids there
who straightened up.

824
01:30:55,541 --> 01:30:58,252
One even became a priest.

825
01:30:59,462 --> 01:31:00,713
I don't get it.

826
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:03,799
Well, you don't get it.

827
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:08,721
In Texas, the bottom line is who
you know and what they owe you.

828
01:31:09,054 --> 01:31:12,808
That's how I do my job.
It's how you got your job.

829
01:31:14,226 --> 01:31:16,895
You are tough, aren't you?

830
01:31:18,063 --> 01:31:22,901
I bought that judge a T-bone,
and I told him to send the boy up.

831
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:26,280
I told him it was
the right thing to do.

832
01:31:28,949 --> 01:31:32,911
The judge went with me,
right down the line.

833
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,132
Butch. Come on, Butch.

834
01:31:45,299 --> 01:31:47,175
Butch, wake up!

835
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:49,678
Butch.

836
01:32:19,666 --> 01:32:22,085
I didn't mean to scare you.

837
01:32:23,712 --> 01:32:27,841
I work at night. Cooler.

838
01:32:28,675 --> 01:32:30,051
Your car break down?

839
01:32:30,218 --> 01:32:34,389
No, me and my boy was just catching
some shut-eye in your field.

840
01:32:34,681 --> 01:32:40,228
Oh, I don't own it.
I just work it for Mr. Andrews.

841
01:32:40,437 --> 01:32:42,355
Where you all from?

842
01:32:42,564 --> 01:32:45,734
Drove from Texarkana yesterday.

843
01:32:45,942 --> 01:32:49,070
- Long haul.
- You said a mouthful there.

844
01:32:50,113 --> 01:32:54,784
No sense sleeping in the car
when I got a foldout couch in there.

845
01:32:54,951 --> 01:32:58,079
Don't wanna put you out.
Gotta get on the road.

846
01:32:58,246 --> 01:33:04,002
No trouble. I'll wake you at first
light. Fill your belly with some food.

847
01:33:04,544 --> 01:33:06,004
Send you on your way.

848
01:33:12,593 --> 01:33:14,095
All right.

849
01:33:41,747 --> 01:33:45,126
He wake you all up?
Now, I told you not to do that.

850
01:33:45,334 --> 01:33:48,421
No. It's no harm, ma'am.

851
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:53,384
I'm Lottie, Mack's wife.
This here's my grandbaby, Cleveland.

852
01:33:53,592 --> 01:33:56,053
Name's Cleve. I'm 6.

853
01:33:57,179 --> 01:33:59,473
I'm 8. Mine's Phil...

854
01:34:01,267 --> 01:34:02,768
Buzz.

855
01:34:09,567 --> 01:34:12,486
We got us a creek down
the way. Wanna go?

856
01:34:12,653 --> 01:34:14,113
Sure thing.

857
01:34:15,573 --> 01:34:17,533
- Morning to you.
- Morning.

858
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:20,536
- Rest done you all good, huh?
- Want a plate?

859
01:34:33,215 --> 01:34:38,762
No. Hey, boy, run out there and
get my the

860
01:34:28,877 --> 01:34:32,005
Hey, you can't hear
me or something?

861
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:35,134
Boy ain't got sense
God give a chicken.

862
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:54,069
You want me to stay
on Highway 70?

863
01:34:54,278 --> 01:34:56,405
No, head on up
towards Amarillo.

864
01:34:56,613 --> 01:35:00,993
We'll either cross him down there,
or wave goodbye at the border.

865
01:35:03,912 --> 01:35:06,540
Again. Do it again.

866
01:35:09,126 --> 01:35:11,837
Where's the boy's mother?

867
01:35:12,337 --> 01:35:14,965
We left her at home this time.

868
01:35:15,924 --> 01:35:18,385
Boys' night out kind of thing.

869
01:35:20,387 --> 01:35:22,472
Say, lookie here.

870
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:24,141
Lookie here!

871
01:35:24,766 --> 01:35:29,563
Mr. Andrews gave it to us when
he got himself a newfangled one.

872
01:35:29,771 --> 01:35:31,398
Jesus.

873
01:35:38,905 --> 01:35:40,156
Now, this is music.

874
01:35:49,499 --> 01:35:52,794
You know how long it's been
since I heard this?

875
01:35:53,002 --> 01:35:56,214
Oh, that's an oldie, all right.

876
01:35:56,422 --> 01:36:02,637
Mrs. Andrews' maiden name was
Bourgeois. Half Creole herself, she is.

877
01:36:02,846 --> 01:36:05,557
Mr. Andrews, he don't like
nobody to know.

878
01:36:05,723 --> 01:36:08,768
I suppose that's why
he give them to us.

879
01:36:11,271 --> 01:36:13,940
Allyou-can-eat fiish fry
on Thursday...

880
01:36:14,107 --> 01:36:18,486
...at 7:00 in the school cafeteria.
Tickets are 3.50 each.

881
01:36:18,653 --> 01:36:21,197
You can stuff your kids for half that.

882
01:36:30,873 --> 01:36:32,625
Dance, Lottie?

883
01:36:32,834 --> 01:36:36,295
- Me? Goodness, no.
- Here.

884
01:36:40,258 --> 01:36:42,260
Just follow me.

885
01:36:58,359 --> 01:37:02,154
- Mr. Poe, you sure can move.
- Well, I ought to be able to.

886
01:37:02,321 --> 01:37:05,074
I was raised
in a dime-a-dance whorehouse.

887
01:37:05,241 --> 01:37:07,827
- You're fooling me.
- No, ma'am.

888
01:37:09,745 --> 01:37:14,708
My mama would dance out of the
frying pan and into the back room fire.

889
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:19,672
Get on your feet, Buzz.

890
01:37:22,174 --> 01:37:25,678
- You and Cleve shake a leg.
- Okay.

891
01:37:26,512 --> 01:37:28,889
Well, go on. Go on!

892
01:37:31,517 --> 01:37:32,810
Dance, boys.

893
01:37:37,898 --> 01:37:38,941
Spin me!

894
01:38:00,295 --> 01:38:05,926
Night before last, a man escaped from
maximum security with another convict:

895
01:38:06,301 --> 01:38:09,972
Terry James Pugh, who was
found dead near Ben Hur, Texas.

896
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:15,018
Shot through the head at close range.
Haynes took a hostage, a young boy...

897
01:38:24,528 --> 01:38:26,988
We'll be leaving soon enough.

898
01:38:28,031 --> 01:38:31,159
I'll kill all of you,
you try anything stupid.

899
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:40,710
What's wrong, Mack?
You look like you seen a ghost.

900
01:38:41,253 --> 01:38:43,255
Come on, Buzz.

901
01:38:43,421 --> 01:38:45,715
- Time to hit the road.
- Do me again.

902
01:38:45,882 --> 01:38:47,592
Get back over here, now.

903
01:38:47,801 --> 01:38:49,761
- Come on.
- Come on, now!

904
01:38:49,969 --> 01:38:52,597
- Come on, mister. Do me again.
- Come on!

905
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:23,044
What'd you wanna go
and hit Cleve for?

906
01:39:23,795 --> 01:39:27,340
He didn't move fast enough
for you? Is that it?

907
01:39:29,258 --> 01:39:34,013
Maybe he gets excited sometimes.
He don't hear everything you say!

908
01:39:36,349 --> 01:39:39,268
You make me sick to my stomach.

909
01:39:53,532 --> 01:39:54,659
Point it at him.

910
01:39:54,825 --> 01:39:57,036
- I don't wanna.
- Point it!

911
01:40:01,165 --> 01:40:03,542
Now, you wanna flip, son?

912
01:40:05,378 --> 01:40:07,129
Sure you do.

913
01:40:07,338 --> 01:40:12,384
Just put your hands between
your legs. I'm not gonna hurt you.

914
01:40:20,976 --> 01:40:23,395
He don't trust you no more.

915
01:40:27,566 --> 01:40:29,860
You gotta earn that, you know.

916
01:40:30,653 --> 01:40:33,530
Go ahead, put your hands
between your legs.

917
01:40:56,637 --> 01:40:59,598
Buzz, go out to the car,
get that rope.

918
01:41:02,893 --> 01:41:04,394
Phillip!

919
01:41:28,835 --> 01:41:34,007
Now, you hold that boy,
and you tell him you love him.

920
01:41:49,689 --> 01:41:53,068
Cleve, I love you.

921
01:41:53,276 --> 01:41:56,738
No, old man!
Say it like you mean it.

922
01:41:57,906 --> 01:42:00,658
- This boy knows I love him.
- Say it!

923
01:42:00,825 --> 01:42:02,368
Please, mister.

924
01:42:03,953 --> 01:42:06,748
I got a sense about you.

925
01:42:06,956 --> 01:42:11,044
I know you a good man.

926
01:42:12,086 --> 01:42:14,672
No, I ain't a good man.

927
01:42:14,964 --> 01:42:17,425
I ain't the worst neither.

928
01:42:17,759 --> 01:42:19,969
Just a breed apart.

929
01:42:26,309 --> 01:42:28,061
Now, say it, Mack.

930
01:42:29,979 --> 01:42:31,648
Say it!

931
01:42:33,608 --> 01:42:36,152
It don't cost nothing.

932
01:42:38,362 --> 01:42:40,156
Cleve...

933
01:42:42,408 --> 01:42:43,826
...I love you.

934
01:42:45,745 --> 01:42:47,413
God...

935
01:42:48,873 --> 01:42:50,917
...that's beautiful.

936
01:43:34,168 --> 01:43:35,461
Get on your knees.

937
01:43:39,381 --> 01:43:41,800
Put your hands
behind your back.

938
01:44:29,598 --> 01:44:32,809
You can go wait in the car
or you can watch.

939
01:44:34,186 --> 01:44:37,105
You're old enough
to think for yourself.

940
01:44:53,997 --> 01:44:55,707
Close your eyes, Cleve.

941
01:44:57,125 --> 01:44:59,627
Lottie, you hold the boy tight.

942
01:45:01,004 --> 01:45:02,964
You shut your eyes too.

943
01:45:07,677 --> 01:45:09,179
Please...

944
01:45:09,387 --> 01:45:10,847
...ain't no use in it.

945
01:45:11,055 --> 01:45:14,809
Mister, I'll give you
everything we got.

946
01:45:15,477 --> 01:45:19,981
Our Father, which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

947
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:25,445
Thy kingdom come, thy will be
done, on earth as it is in heaven.

948
01:45:25,653 --> 01:45:28,197
Mack, Cleve, say it with me.

949
01:45:28,364 --> 01:45:31,367
Give us this day our daily bread.

950
01:45:31,576 --> 01:45:35,788
Forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

951
01:45:35,955 --> 01:45:39,751
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

952
01:45:39,959 --> 01:45:42,879
For thine is the kingdom
and the power and...

953
01:45:43,046 --> 01:45:46,174
Forever and ever. Amen.

954
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:32,696
Phillip?

955
01:49:02,118 --> 01:49:05,663
Thanks for your hospitality.

956
01:49:29,812 --> 01:49:30,855
Phillip?

957
01:49:43,826 --> 01:49:45,327
What the hell?

958
01:50:13,772 --> 01:50:16,942
That was a hell of a thing
to do, Phillip!

959
01:50:19,862 --> 01:50:23,574
You're a hero! Probably
be in all the papers tomorrow...

960
01:50:23,782 --> 01:50:27,202
...how you saved those folks.
Truth is...

961
01:50:27,369 --> 01:50:30,539
...I don't think I'd have
killed them though.

962
01:50:30,747 --> 01:50:34,960
Only killed two people
in my whole life.

963
01:50:35,794 --> 01:50:38,171
One hurt my mama...

964
01:50:39,172 --> 01:50:41,216
...one hurt you.

965
01:50:50,725 --> 01:50:55,021
What say we talk this over?
Settle things man-to-man.

966
01:50:56,523 --> 01:50:58,984
Then we can be on our way.

967
01:51:00,569 --> 01:51:02,070
I'll even...

968
01:51:02,862 --> 01:51:05,240
I'll even let you drive.

969
01:51:05,448 --> 01:51:09,286
Knock that right off your list.
How would that be?

970
01:51:50,076 --> 01:51:53,871
That's his car. He's afoot.

971
01:51:54,038 --> 01:51:57,500
And he's got a pistol.
Mack says it looks like a .38.

972
01:52:22,775 --> 01:52:25,194
Alaska, Phillip. Wild and woolly.

973
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:30,032
Man against nature.
Me personally, I like them odds.

974
01:52:30,491 --> 01:52:33,077
I tell you my daddy lives there?

975
01:52:35,663 --> 01:52:37,248
He's a...

976
01:52:38,999 --> 01:52:42,044
He's the one sent
the picture postcard.

977
01:52:42,837 --> 01:52:46,048
Listen here what he says about it.
"Dear Robert:"

978
01:52:46,382 --> 01:52:52,304
Just wanted to tell you that me
leaving has nothing to do with you.

979
01:52:52,930 --> 01:52:57,977
Alaska is a very beautiful place,
colder than hell most all the time.

980
01:52:58,185 --> 01:53:02,106
Someday you can come and visit...

981
01:53:02,314 --> 01:53:06,193
"...and we'll maybe get
to know each other better."

982
01:53:09,279 --> 01:53:11,031
Short and sweet.

983
01:53:11,615 --> 01:53:13,951
That's the old man's style.

984
01:53:17,329 --> 01:53:21,458
We'll just rest a while.

985
01:53:23,627 --> 01:53:26,380
Then you make up your mind.

986
01:53:28,715 --> 01:53:30,551
How's that, Phillip?

987
01:53:34,888 --> 01:53:37,557
Town called Happy
over in Swisher County.

988
01:53:37,724 --> 01:53:41,478
Radio ahead so whoever gets
there takes it nice and easy.

989
01:53:41,645 --> 01:53:45,774
Governor's having the mother flown in.
You want her on standby?

990
01:53:45,941 --> 01:53:48,902
- Good idea.
- Yeah, have her helicoptered in.

991
01:54:01,665 --> 01:54:04,501
Well, one thing's for sure now.

992
01:54:05,710 --> 01:54:08,838
I definitely believe in ghosts.

993
01:54:12,133 --> 01:54:14,636
Never been shot before.

994
01:54:14,844 --> 01:54:16,179
I'm sorry.

995
01:54:16,888 --> 01:54:19,140
I know you are.

996
01:54:31,111 --> 01:54:35,949
Truth is, if it had to happen, I'm...

997
01:54:36,157 --> 01:54:38,576
I'm glad it was you.

998
01:54:41,454 --> 01:54:44,415
As opposed to someone
I don't know, I mean.

999
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,877
All things considered...

1000
01:54:49,379 --> 01:54:51,714
...I feel pretty good.

1001
01:55:06,938 --> 01:55:08,147
Listen up, boys!

1002
01:55:09,732 --> 01:55:10,983
You better run.

1003
01:55:14,362 --> 01:55:15,863
No, Phillip.

1004
01:55:18,241 --> 01:55:21,744
I need me a time machine
with a loud radio...

1005
01:55:22,245 --> 01:55:24,747
...to take me where I'm going.

1006
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:30,169
Walking's for squares.

1007
01:55:31,253 --> 01:55:33,589
Hand me that shotgun.

1008
01:55:42,765 --> 01:55:46,435
- You don't think he'll hurt the boy?
- No, he won't.

1009
01:55:49,522 --> 01:55:51,815
Garnett. Tom Hendricks, FBl.

1010
01:55:51,982 --> 01:55:54,985
- You have one of our men with you?
- We do.

1011
01:55:55,194 --> 01:55:57,363
- We cordoned off the area.
- Tight?

1012
01:55:57,571 --> 01:56:01,325
Watertight. Like a frog's pussy.
Sorry, ma'am.

1013
01:56:01,533 --> 01:56:05,120
No doubt an observation based
on personal experience.

1014
01:56:10,209 --> 01:56:11,251
Where are they?

1015
01:56:11,418 --> 01:56:13,796
By the pond,
behind that dogleg tree.

1016
01:56:13,962 --> 01:56:17,383
Officers are in a circle
around them 100 yards away.

1017
01:56:18,383 --> 01:56:20,761
You got no problem
if I handle this?

1018
01:56:24,723 --> 01:56:27,309
What say we both handle it?

1019
01:56:30,312 --> 01:56:31,355
- Bradley.
- Sir?

1020
01:56:31,563 --> 01:56:33,565
Get me a megaphone.

1021
01:56:33,774 --> 01:56:35,984
- One other thing, chief.
- Huh?

1022
01:56:36,193 --> 01:56:39,279
Haynes is wounded.
The boy gut-shot him.

1023
01:56:40,322 --> 01:56:41,865
You're kidding?

1024
01:56:44,785 --> 01:56:47,329
Red. Megaphone.

1025
01:56:53,877 --> 01:56:57,631
Butch Haynes. This is Red
Garnett of the Texas Rangers.

1026
01:56:57,798 --> 01:57:01,676
I know you're hurt. We got
20, 30 armed men up here.

1027
01:57:01,843 --> 01:57:04,054
I'm shooting you straight.

1028
01:57:04,429 --> 01:57:10,018
All this for me? I'm touched. I'm afraid
you'll have to back it up a step or two.

1029
01:57:10,518 --> 01:57:12,103
I'm headed to Mexico!

1030
01:57:12,354 --> 01:57:14,648
You're headed the wrong direction.

1031
01:57:15,231 --> 01:57:16,858
Lying to them, of course.

1032
01:57:17,025 --> 01:57:21,446
I'll tell you what. You let the
boy go, you and I'll talk about it.

1033
01:57:21,863 --> 01:57:25,241
Well, I appreciate the offer, captain!

1034
01:57:26,659 --> 01:57:30,163
But you know I can't do that!

1035
01:57:31,164 --> 01:57:35,502
If you and your pals
back out of here, well...

1036
01:57:35,710 --> 01:57:38,713
...I'll drop the boy at the border!

1037
01:57:39,506 --> 01:57:44,052
If you don't,
I'll shoot him in the head!

1038
01:57:44,844 --> 01:57:46,346
I mean it!

1039
01:57:51,392 --> 01:57:53,853
Don't look at me like that.

1040
01:57:54,812 --> 01:57:57,231
I don't even have a gun.

1041
01:58:02,987 --> 01:58:05,990
What did you do
with the pistola anyway?

1042
01:58:07,950 --> 01:58:10,244
Dropped it in the well.

1043
01:58:14,791 --> 01:58:16,292
That's good thinking.

1044
01:58:16,959 --> 01:58:19,545
They get away,
we're where we started.

1045
01:58:19,712 --> 01:58:24,258
- He kills the boy, he'll get the chair.
- He's killed two in two days.

1046
01:58:24,425 --> 01:58:28,721
- We don't know he killed them.
- Well, he wasn't sitting at home.

1047
01:58:28,888 --> 01:58:33,059
- Besides, who killed Pugh? Casper?
- All right, knock it off!

1048
01:58:33,351 --> 01:58:37,229
By the look of things,
it won't make too much difference.

1049
01:58:38,397 --> 01:58:42,401
- Concentrate on getting the boy.
- Where do you want me, sir?

1050
01:58:42,610 --> 01:58:46,197
Right here on the hood.
Can you handle that one?

1051
01:58:46,405 --> 01:58:49,784
Yes, I can, sir. Excuse me.

1052
01:59:10,304 --> 01:59:11,889
See, Phillip?

1053
01:59:13,891 --> 01:59:16,185
Dreams do come true.

1054
01:59:17,436 --> 01:59:22,441
- There's your rocket ship.
- You think I'll get a ride in it?

1055
01:59:23,442 --> 01:59:25,319
Today's the day.

1056
01:59:25,652 --> 01:59:29,406
- That would be the boy's mother.
- Go help her out, Adler.

1057
01:59:47,841 --> 01:59:51,053
All right, Butch.
We got the boy's mama here.

1058
01:59:58,852 --> 02:00:02,689
- What's wrong?
- It's my mama.

1059
02:00:03,690 --> 02:00:08,069
Now that you got yourself
a ghost suit...

1060
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:10,989
...think she'll let you
trick-or-treat?

1061
02:00:11,948 --> 02:00:14,034
I got to do one house.

1062
02:00:15,827 --> 02:00:17,037
Come here.

1063
02:00:22,292 --> 02:00:26,421
Put your-Put your mask back on.

1064
02:00:29,549 --> 02:00:32,052
Turn around and scare them.

1065
02:00:32,802 --> 02:00:37,390
Hello? Please. He's my only son.

1066
02:00:37,807 --> 02:00:40,643
I'll give you money, whatever I can.

1067
02:00:40,852 --> 02:00:44,814
Please! I just wanna
take him home with me.

1068
02:00:46,065 --> 02:00:47,901
Goddamn this son of a bitch.

1069
02:00:48,109 --> 02:00:50,653
- Let me see it, Red.
- Here, Bradley.

1070
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:53,281
You ready to go home?

1071
02:00:55,742 --> 02:00:57,243
Yes, sir.

1072
02:00:59,537 --> 02:01:03,916
Hey, captain! You got any candy?

1073
02:01:04,751 --> 02:01:05,793
What?

1074
02:01:06,002 --> 02:01:10,590
Candy! You know, Halloween candy!
Popcorn balls...

1075
02:01:10,798 --> 02:01:13,760
...caramel apples, gum!
Shit like that.

1076
02:01:13,926 --> 02:01:15,094
You all hungry?

1077
02:01:15,303 --> 02:01:18,431
You find me some candy...

1078
02:01:19,474 --> 02:01:21,434
...I'll deliver up a ghost!

1079
02:01:22,768 --> 02:01:24,270
- I got it.
- Get candy.

1080
02:01:24,437 --> 02:01:27,106
Okay, everybody! Got any gum, candy?

1081
02:01:27,273 --> 02:01:29,442
Any Juicy Fruit? Put it in there.

1082
02:01:29,609 --> 02:01:32,445
Let's go! Come on.
We ain't got any time.

1083
02:01:32,612 --> 02:01:36,115
She's gotta take him
trick-or-treating every year!

1084
02:01:36,657 --> 02:01:40,786
- You all set?
- You say when, I'll say dead.

1085
02:01:40,995 --> 02:01:42,955
- Give me your list.
- Butch?

1086
02:01:43,122 --> 02:01:45,291
Give me your list. Come on.

1087
02:01:45,499 --> 02:01:47,418
Come on, come on.

1088
02:01:48,961 --> 02:01:50,212
One more thing!

1089
02:01:50,588 --> 02:01:54,467
She's gotta promise
to take him to the fair...

1090
02:01:54,675 --> 02:02:00,014
...for roller coasters
and cotton candy whenever he wants!

1091
02:02:03,726 --> 02:02:07,855
I wanna go home. My mama's not bad.
She gives me those things.

1092
02:02:09,356 --> 02:02:11,400
Don't kid a kidder, Phillip.

1093
02:02:17,489 --> 02:02:22,161
I know just-
I know just how you feel, Phillip.

1094
02:02:22,661 --> 02:02:24,329
She promises!

1095
02:02:25,998 --> 02:02:28,000
Make her say it!

1096
02:02:31,670 --> 02:02:33,338
I promise!

1097
02:02:33,547 --> 02:02:38,844
- Can we trust her?
- She's a real good mama.

1098
02:02:43,182 --> 02:02:47,102
When you get home, you hide this.

1099
02:02:50,022 --> 02:02:53,567
You're not bad, are you, Butch?

1100
02:02:56,778 --> 02:02:58,280
Yeah.

1101
02:03:00,198 --> 02:03:01,908
Now, listen, Buzz.

1102
02:03:02,117 --> 02:03:03,702
I want you...

1103
02:03:04,536 --> 02:03:08,665
All right, now I want you
to step out there real slow...

1104
02:03:08,874 --> 02:03:11,251
...keeping your paws in the air.

1105
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:15,255
All right, now I want you
to strut over to them cops...

1106
02:03:16,548 --> 02:03:19,050
...and yell, "Trick or treat."

1107
02:03:20,886 --> 02:03:25,807
- What are you gonna do?
- Something will come to mind.

1108
02:03:34,733 --> 02:03:36,234
Bye, Phillip.

1109
02:03:37,569 --> 02:03:39,571
It's been one hell of a ride.

1110
02:03:44,242 --> 02:03:46,911
All right, captain!

1111
02:03:47,078 --> 02:03:52,125
Make way for
Casper the Friendly Ghost!

1112
02:03:53,543 --> 02:03:55,587
Friendliest ghost I know.

1113
02:04:00,383 --> 02:04:02,635
Put your mask on.

1114
02:04:04,137 --> 02:04:06,598
Put your paws in the air.

1115
02:04:10,351 --> 02:04:14,230
Now go tell them like I told you to.

1116
02:04:14,647 --> 02:04:16,149
Red...

1117
02:04:16,774 --> 02:04:18,860
Take a look at this.

1118
02:04:19,819 --> 02:04:21,529
Oh, it's him...

1119
02:04:22,905 --> 02:04:24,824
Come on, boy. Keep walking.

1120
02:04:41,674 --> 02:04:42,967
Keep walking, boy!

1121
02:04:47,638 --> 02:04:51,350
- Call your boy.
- Run! Phillip, run!

1122
02:04:51,559 --> 02:04:55,813
Phillip, honey, come on! Phillip!

1123
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:59,817
- He thought better of releasing him.
- It doesn't mean that.

1124
02:05:12,538 --> 02:05:17,876
Personally, I think we negotiated
a pretty fair deal.

1125
02:05:18,335 --> 02:05:21,297
Unless there's something else
you want?

1126
02:05:22,881 --> 02:05:25,426
Do they want to shoot you?

1127
02:05:51,285 --> 02:05:53,370
- Stay on ready.
- Yes, sir.

1128
02:06:07,592 --> 02:06:09,594
Well, I've seen it all now.

1129
02:06:10,095 --> 02:06:13,557
- What's he up to?
- Damned if I know.

1130
02:06:13,974 --> 02:06:16,059
He's giving himself up.

1131
02:06:16,226 --> 02:06:18,395
Keep in mind, he still has a gun.

1132
02:06:20,438 --> 02:06:25,861
So I guess-
I guess that's it for Alaska, Phillip.

1133
02:06:28,071 --> 02:06:31,908
Chief, we got an armed killer
and an innocent boy out there.

1134
02:06:32,951 --> 02:06:36,329
- You clean?
- As a whistle.

1135
02:06:36,538 --> 02:06:39,082
All right, you keep him locked down.

1136
02:06:39,499 --> 02:06:41,584
Don't squeeze till I say when.

1137
02:06:42,002 --> 02:06:44,295
Where the hell you going?

1138
02:07:13,992 --> 02:07:15,493
I'm unarmed...

1139
02:07:16,911 --> 02:07:18,788
...so throw your gun down.

1140
02:07:19,038 --> 02:07:21,749
If I had a pistola...

1141
02:07:23,543 --> 02:07:26,629
...I'd be headed
in the other direction.

1142
02:07:27,422 --> 02:07:31,926
My partner here, he got-
He got rid of the evidence.

1143
02:07:36,931 --> 02:07:38,683
Do I know you, friend?

1144
02:07:40,768 --> 02:07:43,563
No. Not really.

1145
02:07:46,816 --> 02:07:51,237
Well, look, I wanna talk to the boy.

1146
02:07:51,445 --> 02:07:54,907
Then we can take care of business.

1147
02:07:55,116 --> 02:07:56,158
How's that?

1148
02:07:56,659 --> 02:07:59,078
Only take a second.

1149
02:08:01,288 --> 02:08:02,331
Okay.

1150
02:08:09,922 --> 02:08:11,841
I wanna give you something.

1151
02:08:12,007 --> 02:08:14,218
Hold him. If he makes a move...

1152
02:08:14,635 --> 02:08:16,720
Give it a second.

1153
02:08:21,976 --> 02:08:24,687
Maybe someday you'll get to go...

1154
02:08:24,853 --> 02:08:26,689
He's going for his weapon!

1155
02:08:29,525 --> 02:08:30,734
No!

1156
02:08:32,152 --> 02:08:35,030
- Oh, God, no!
- Keep everybody back!

1157
02:08:36,699 --> 02:08:38,200
Butch!

1158
02:08:41,370 --> 02:08:46,583
Damn, Buzz.
Shot twice in the same day.

1159
02:09:02,266 --> 02:09:07,229
No need to worry.
Can't hurt nobody now.

1160
02:09:07,646 --> 02:09:09,731
Oh, my God!

1161
02:09:13,235 --> 02:09:15,737
Doesn't have a gun, chief.

1162
02:11:00,466 --> 02:11:01,967
- Back off!
- Easy, Red!

1163
02:11:02,176 --> 02:11:06,430
- What the hell was that all about?
- I didn't say "when."

1164
02:11:16,398 --> 02:11:17,900
Goddamn it!

1165
02:11:18,901 --> 02:11:21,987
Red, I thought he had a gun too.

1166
02:11:22,196 --> 02:11:24,949
There was just no way of knowing.

1167
02:11:45,886 --> 02:11:49,431
You know you did
everything you could...

1168
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:51,391
...don't you?

1169
02:11:54,561 --> 02:11:57,064
I don't know nothing.

1170
02:11:59,942 --> 02:12:02,736
Not one damn thing.
