1
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,400
Throngs of people outside still
waiting for the bride to appear.

2
00:00:40,435 --> 00:00:42,325
She's not in there. I can feel it.

3
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,796
Any moment now, she should
be leaving the hotel.

4
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,757
I overestimated her.
I thought she'd be more elusive.

5
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,591
- I don't understand what's
happening. - What is going on here?

6
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,913
I don't think they want us to know
which one the real bride is.

7
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,040
The streets are full of brides,
the skies are full of brides,

8
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:13,925
the press doesn't know
which way is up.

9
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,480
- I'm a genius. Still no sign
of Marco Ballani? - None.

10
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:20,640
- Our intelligence says he's gone
skiing. - Now?

11
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,153
Then we're good.

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,956
Hello?

13
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,680
You! What the hell
are you doing in there?

14
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:58,445
I am the wedding photographer.

15
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,285
Can I have the tall people
at the back?

16
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,040
- OK, buster, fun's over.
- How long have you been in there?

17
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:06,793
Oh, my God. This is not soda.

18
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,717
I'm gonna kill you!

19
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,158
- You are ruining my life!
- I've ruined plenty of lives.

20
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,076
You're nothing special.

21
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,045
You abscess!

22
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,313
When I do get married, you will not
even know what continent I'm on!

23
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,885
Marco Ballani, you golden Roman god!

24
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,480
I will not be defeated
by that disease of a man.

25
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:56,631
We're gonna have to
disappear completely.

26
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,073
We can get married in outer space.

27
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,236
Or the lost underwater kingdom
of Atlantis?

28
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,980
Outer space?
I don't think you can yet.

29
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:08,240
Is that what your intelligence
tells you?

30
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,072
We're gonna have to go somewhere
crazy remote.

31
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,036
Hi, Mum.

32
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,156
Oh, no.

33
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,310
- What's happened?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

34
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,592
- I'm fine. - Well, that's good.
Just so long as you're fine.

35
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,805
Are you going somewhere?

36
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,910
I don't suppose you're
in the mood for a wedding?

37
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,005
There is somebody out there for you,

38
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,925
somebody sensitive and faithful
and kind.

39
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,405
But you'll never meet him
if you're hiding here.

40
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,520
Good. I don't want to meet him.
He sounds like a twat.

41
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:51,633
I'm like kryptonite to men.

42
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:54,712
Kryptonite dipped in cellulite.

43
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,080
So, what's new on Hegg?
Give me the headlines.

44
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:02,405
One of Donald's sheep drowned.

45
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,874
They had to fish it out
with a curtain rail.

46
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,600
- Hello.
- Mild out, isn't it, Iseabail?

47
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:13,085
It's this global warming.

48
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,720
- Katie's back.
- Are we late?

49
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:20,518
Too late to marry him.

50
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,798
Quick!

51
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,069
Sorry. No.

52
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,876
Hi, Angus.

53
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,072
You're too late, Katie Nic Aodh.
He's mine now!

54
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,200
There's always the Oban tinker.
He'll be visiting come September.

55
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,965
And he's keen to marry
on account of his leg.

56
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,039
I'll marry you, Katie.
How old will you be in eight years?

57
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,472
- 40.
- Could have gone to 36.

58
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,600
- The return of the native.
- Hello, Laird.

59
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:15,955
That was quite the entrance, Katie.

60
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,600
And continuing the theme
of my public humiliation,

61
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:22,085
I may need my old job back.

62
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,200
What happened
to your fancy Edinburgh job

63
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,845
at the trouser catalogue?

64
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,474
I ran out of ways to describe
pockets.

65
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,085
If you don't mind me saying, Katie,

66
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,000
you've always had such a terrible
taste in men.

67
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:36,753
I know. I've gone man vegan.

68
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,960
They say after the first six years
you don't miss them any more.

69
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:42,085
You've picked the right spot
to try it.

70
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,910
There are no single men left
on Hegg, are there, after today?

71
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,073
Except for me, of course.

72
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,200
Perhaps you'll dance with me
later on.

73
00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:57,565
You'll not be forgetting Hegg law,
Laird.

74
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,560
- You must dance with us all.
Eldest to youngest. - Oh, yes.

75
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:04,445
The dance of the dead.

76
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,554
Which means I should get to you
about 4:30 in the morning.

77
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,796
So,

78
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,165
how long are you back for?

79
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,165
Well, actually,
I'm thinking of staying.

80
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,045
I thought you said nothing
ever happened here.

81
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,995
No. Well, nothing happening
is becoming more appealing.

82
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,680
So, this is all very grown-up.
You've a wife

83
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:35,325
- and a beard.
- Well,

84
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,600
Muireen thinks differently
of beards than you.

85
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:40,556
And marriage.

86
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,920
Look, I truly hope you'll be...

87
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:47,876
Aye.

88
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,485
Hegg: An Island History,

89
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,200
The Definitive Guide.
By Katie Nic Aodh.

90
00:09:33,235 --> 00:09:35,111
£5 a copy. We split the proceeds.

91
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,160
A guidebook to here? Don't be mad.

92
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:41,285
Come see our disused toilet

93
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,080
that may or may not be haunted
by the ghost of a drowned cow.

94
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:47,965
You see? We need to channel
this raw, creative energy.

95
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,040
Else you're liable to get restless
and go wandering off again.

96
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:53,192
Nobody's going to buy
a guidebook to Hegg.

97
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:55,310
Unless it's cheaper
than our toilet paper.

98
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,795
A marketing conference? Here?

99
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,520
- The tide has turned.
- For the marketeers.

100
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:07,637
£1 each
or £1.50 with hair.

101
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,525
They want my castle, just as it is,
for a week.

102
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,393
- Good luck to them.
- This is a beautiful island, Katie.

103
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,165
In a way...

104
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,920
New beginnings.
It's like the whale all over again.

105
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,977
You're not too young
to remember the whale, Laird?

106
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:29,000
- No, I remember.
- There'll be money in this lot too.

107
00:10:29,035 --> 00:10:31,965
No throwing yourself
at the men visitors, Katie.

108
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,312
We don't want them thinking this is
the Orkneys where anything goes.

109
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,720
Now, Katie, chop chop.
Chapter One,

110
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:40,925
in which a young woman and her laird

111
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,800
rescue their island from certain
doom by writing

112
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:45,631
a brilliant guidebook.

113
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,000
The island of Hegg
lies half-drowned and wind-battered,

114
00:10:58,035 --> 00:11:00,577
the furthermost drop
of the outermost spray

115
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:03,120
of the curling wave
of the Outer Hebrides.

116
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:05,525
It has a population of 75,

117
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,835
a majority of whom are probably
about...

118
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,996
75. Or even older.

119
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,685
Though Hegg no doubt has
a certain charm,

120
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,525
it has never been a popular
stop on the tourist trail.

121
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,716
Even the Vikings never showed
the slightest interest in us.

122
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:27,872
But the islanders remain
a hardy and resourceful people.

123
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,232
All those under 50 are now married,
except one.

124
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,205
The island has one B&B

125
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,005
which offers the traditional
Scottish breakfast of haggis,

126
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,360
sausage, chips and beans, or if
you're feeling more metropolitan,

127
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:44,565
you can have the continental
breakfast,

128
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,797
a bread roll,
two Weetabix and a Snickers bar.

129
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,245
Have we got any Michelin stars
I can put up?

130
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,800
- Are you not cold? Can I get you
a coat? - I'll be fine.

131
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:58,285
- As always. - You think?
- I'll be dying either way.

132
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,600
I've got to get out of here, Katie.
I've never been anywhere.

133
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:04,125
And I want to see the world,
overdose on daiquiris

134
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,154
and be thrown into a volcano.
But you need money for that.

135
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,829
If they ask,
we had two stars but they fell off.

136
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,720
Welcome to the Sunshine,
Hegg's only B&B.

137
00:12:19,755 --> 00:12:21,525
We have rooms available.

138
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,560
- We're looking for the castle.
- We're marketing people.

139
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:26,994
I'll take you there... for a tenner.

140
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,365
Mum!

141
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,311
I'll take you.

142
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,948
Oh, my God.

143
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,437
Do you like it?

144
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,073
It's spectacular.

145
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,955
And that was the last we any
of us saw of the Americans.

146
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,165
'The gilt work glistened proudly. '

147
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,228
'Time had in no way diminished
the splendours of this castle. '

148
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,672
We're dead. Lara's expecting to walk
straight into his stupid book.

149
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,478
She's not gonna blame you, Steve.
She is a reasonable woman.

150
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,040
Get me an office, a landline,
steeplejacks, welders,

151
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:36,165
£20,000 in cash,
50,000 gallons of water,

152
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,120
the construction crew
from Bonnie Prince Charlie

153
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:42,076
and a cappuccino.

154
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,965
A seal. Look. How cute.

155
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,560
I've no idea where we are,
but it's perfect.

156
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:09,085
'The sea turns
and shakes its manacles of salt

157
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,960
at the sharp rocks
on which too many waves have died. '

158
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:14,916
What's that?

159
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,350
It's you.
Chapter 49 of my favourite book.

160
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,994
- The Ornithologist's Wife.
- Really?

161
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:28,589
My husband is gonna be one of the
great writers of the 21 st century.

162
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,473
- So where are we exactly?
- You know where we are.

163
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,356
Do I?

164
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,473
No!

165
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,280
It's just how you described it.

166
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:13,565
We're on Hegg.

167
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,360
You don't remember it
from your many research trips?

168
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:19,485
Hey, you guys.

169
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,600
I don't know why
we didn't think of this before.

170
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:24,880
I'm sorry we can't have friends
and family.

171
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:26,598
But this is so special, isn't it?

172
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,878
It's perfect. And it's just us.

173
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,513
Let's go in. I have to see the Hall
of a Million Feathers.

174
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,996
- Should we? - Yes, you really
should. It's quite something.

175
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,445
Do you like your room?

176
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,645
We had 40 master craftsmen working
through the night.

177
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,760
- One of them was 80. - Why didn't
you just tell her I made it all up?

178
00:16:12,795 --> 00:16:15,280
When Lara wants to go
to the Big Rock Candy Mountain,

179
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:16,765
I don't take her to Elm Street.

180
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,280
This is your first time on Hegg,
isn't it?

181
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:20,845
You Googled the entire book.

182
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,314
You're the first person
ever to have a problem with that.

183
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,672
I need some air.

184
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,560
There are only seven people
in the world who know we're here.

185
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:35,974
Anybody asks,
you're at a marketing conference.

186
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:39,353
Keep your head down,
and wear a hat, Tolstoy.

187
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,280
If you can safely navigate
the many rabbit holes,

188
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:55,685
Hegg can be a great place to ramble.

189
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,775
And as the islanders say,
if you don't like the weather here,

190
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,830
just wait 20 minutes and maybe
you will. End of Chapter One.

191
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,759
Chapter Two: Hegg's top hot spots.

192
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,640
The people of the island are rightly
proud of this ageing public amenity.

193
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:23,240
The ornate urinals
are enamelled in peacock colours,

194
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,074
while the cow-sized cubicle is...

195
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,394
genuinely frightening.

196
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,756
Laird.

197
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,959
Hello?
Pretty sure that's not a real cow.

198
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,433
Unless it's got hold of a kazoo.

199
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,885
- Sorry.
- Oh, no, no, really. I'm...

200
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,640
The laird of the island has
a similar hat.

201
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,000
Sorry to barge in on you, Mrs...

202
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:18,285
- Not Mrs.
- No, no. No.

203
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,118
I was just pretending
to be the ghost of this cow,

204
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,153
which, of course,
sounds completely mad.

205
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,956
Not at all.

206
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,725
Sorry. From the outside,

207
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,560
your home looks like it might
be open to the public.

208
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:34,790
My home?

209
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,120
You don't live here?

210
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:40,885
Not in this toilet, no.

211
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,360
Here we live in primitive dwellings
anthropologists like

212
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:45,925
to call houses.

213
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,353
Please forgive me. I've spent a lot
of time with... hermits.

214
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,680
For someone in marketing,
you're not very good at lying.

215
00:18:54,715 --> 00:18:56,796
I'm still quite junior.

216
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,068
- Katie.
- I'm J...

217
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,160
John. John... son. John...

218
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:10,117
- John.
- John Johnson.

219
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:13,005
And I'm... I'm quite lost.

220
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,828
No wonder. That book isn't right
about anything.

221
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,320
You haven't read it. No one's read
it, not all the way through.

222
00:19:21,355 --> 00:19:23,640
That's the only book ever written
about Hegg.

223
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:25,565
Everybody who can read has read it.

224
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,840
- The Hegg Book Club gave it four
out of ten. - Four out of ten?

225
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,405
We thought it picked up
around page 600.

226
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,200
The architecture of the book
was probably quite deliberate.

227
00:19:34,235 --> 00:19:36,525
Wow, the Hegg Book Club
are a tough crowd.

228
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,600
Oh, and the love story?
I didn't buy that at all.

229
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:42,685
It was just soulless.

230
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,880
- Soulless? - Maybe his second
boo will be better.

231
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:48,045
- Is it out yet?
- Not yet, no.

232
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,125
God. It's been years.
Either he's very,

233
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,080
very blocked or it's even longer
than that one. Can you imagine?

234
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:58,709
Do you want me to carry it
for a bit?

235
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,725
Oh, no, no, no. You want lona.

236
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,840
There's no monastery here.
No monks. No miracles.

237
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,885
- That's OK.
- But no free accommodation here.

238
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,960
I believe in God so-so, but I'm also
very interested in yoga.

239
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:17,800
- Hung jury, you see.
So no discount. - No problem.

240
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:20,030
I will pay upfront, in full.

241
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,885
To be fair, he had to make it up.

242
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,400
You could cover Hegg in a pamphlet
of about five pages.

243
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,356
OK, I know where I am now.

244
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,445
Look, you're here to work,
obviously.

245
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,080
But if you ever fancy a coffee,
I just live at the B&B over...

246
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:40,833
down there, with my mother.

247
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,199
Just... I'm around most of the time,

248
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:47,039
and I'm a whole lot hotter than
I look.

249
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,636
We've got so much...

250
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,790
marketing to do.

251
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,553
OK. This wasn't...

252
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,753
I wasn't... I don't any more.

253
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,152
I've gone vegan anyway.

254
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,116
Yeah.

255
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,872
Sorry.

256
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,311
Bye.

257
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,876
Room three.

258
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,749
Blessings.

259
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,440
It's a hobby. I hope to capture one
of your very rare birds on film.

260
00:21:32,475 --> 00:21:36,960
We don't have any rare birds.
We have hedgehogs.

261
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,552
Yeah, well, I am here now.

262
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,855
I have just made the most
unbelievable

263
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,070
- twat of myself.
- We have a guest.

264
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,513
- I don't trust this monk.
- People say they monkey around.

265
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,230
- I think he's a journalist.
- Why?

266
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,877
Are you taking your pills properly?

267
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,669
Chapter One Jackson Kandinsky awoke
from hot dreams of lost things

268
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,676
and adjusted his testicular implant.

269
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,154
I'm a whole lot hotter than I look.

270
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,836
Yeah?

271
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,800
Are you sure it's so terribly
unlucky to make love

272
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:41,077
the night before the wedding?

273
00:23:41,112 --> 00:23:43,496
I hate it when you beg for sex.

274
00:23:43,531 --> 00:23:45,880
You are staggeringly beautiful.

275
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,197
Starve me of yourself.
Turn me concave

276
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,925
with caverns of longingness.

277
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh, God. Did I write that?
'Longingness. ' It's not even a word.

278
00:24:04,035 --> 00:24:08,080
No. That was just me saying
what I was thinking.

279
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:10,435
Oh, right. Sorry.

280
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,350
It finally got dark, then?

281
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,435
You're not a monk.
And you're not having my story.

282
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,795
Is that the Caledonian Press Agency?

283
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,956
Visualise your cellulite melting!

284
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,554
Come on! You're doing really well!

285
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,278
Oh, my God.

286
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,716
This is good. Feel the burn.

287
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,031
Lara?

288
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,760
When you say
'kind of like missing... '?

289
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:06,751
She's... She's totally gone.

290
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,285
OK, she saw him. Did he see her?

291
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,685
I don't know. He's disguised
as a wizard.

292
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,840
Some kind of brown wizard. And he's
in a tree right by the chapel.

293
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,520
How does he do this?

294
00:26:20,555 --> 00:26:22,476
He's amazing.

295
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,325
OK, he's in a tree. He wants a photo
of the happy couple.

296
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,760
Let's give it to him. We go through
with the wedding exactly as planned.

297
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:40,680
But with a stand-in. Ballani,
convinced he's at the real wedding,

298
00:26:40,715 --> 00:26:43,080
takes his photo and leaves.
Then we go find Lara,

299
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:44,445
bring her back to the chapel

300
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,320
and do it all over again,
this time for real.

301
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,605
You are amazing also.

302
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,674
- I'll go and tell James? - Don't
tell that Googling leech anything.

303
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:57,709
If James finds out Lara is missing,
he's gonna go looking for her...

304
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,240
Oh, you're in here. Anais-Anais,
I'm gonna do my own hair this time.

305
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:04,196
- Because I know what I want.
- Fine.

306
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,716
Everything all right?

307
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,435
- Yay.
- Yay.

308
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,916
- Good luck.
- All right.

309
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,600
But if James doesn't know that Lara
is missing, how is that gonna work?

310
00:27:21,635 --> 00:27:26,880
He has to think it's for real.
We need a decoy bride.

311
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:29,269
None of you are right.
Too tall, too black.

312
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,845
- I could do it.
- Don't be stupid.

313
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,605
Ballani knows you.
He needs to see you with James.

314
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,189
I just need somebody who can
walk 20 feet without falling over.

315
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,325
Who was that awful girl?

316
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,000
- But I don't look anything like
Lara Tyler. - That's true,

317
00:27:45,035 --> 00:27:48,640
but neither does she until these
ladies get their hands on her.

318
00:27:48,675 --> 00:27:52,560
- Hi.
- We think you're full of potential.

319
00:27:52,595 --> 00:27:55,165
- No. Sorry.
- £200.

320
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,600
I'm really not interested.
I'm off weddings.

321
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:00,365
£500. It's not a real wedding.

322
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,640
Are they ever? I nearly bought
a wedding dress once.

323
00:28:03,675 --> 00:28:06,757
- Cost the same as a Fiat Uno.
- £5,000.

324
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,965
Has somebody on the island
told you I'm a prostitute?

325
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,840
I'm really not interested,
and my mum'll be back in a while

326
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,685
and I said I'd cook her lunch, so...

327
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,440
One hour's improvisation.
No scenes of a sexual nature.

328
00:28:20,475 --> 00:28:24,160
£5,000. You can do something really
nice for your poor,

329
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:25,832
sick mother.

330
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,925
What the flipping heck are they?

331
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,793
I'm going to temporarily immobilise
your nasolabial folds.

332
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,800
- What are you doing?
- It's just like bleach.

333
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:46,337
- It'll make your hair lighter.
- No way.

334
00:28:46,372 --> 00:28:48,840
She is not putting toilet
cleaner in my hair.

335
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50,717
Don't be a diva.

336
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,516
No, no, no.

337
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,874
- Sorry.
- Hopeless.

338
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,885
Let's just make extra sure.

339
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,445
You're an Oscar nominee.
You ooze confidence.

340
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,320
You define poise. You're the face
that launched a thousand campaigns.

341
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:51,040
And your latest thing
is quoting Gertrude Stein.

342
00:29:51,075 --> 00:29:53,554
At length and from memory.

343
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,780
OK, Steve, we're in.
He's not inside we don't think.

344
00:29:57,815 --> 00:30:01,040
But safer to assume the place
is bugged. Over and out.

345
00:30:01,075 --> 00:30:03,759
Can you do an American accent?

346
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,596
Lara? You OK?

347
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:40,675
Hi. Will you love her,
comfort her,

348
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,557
honour and protect her,

349
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,360
and forsaking all others
be faithful to her

350
00:30:49,395 --> 00:30:51,920
for as long as you both shall live?

351
00:30:51,955 --> 00:30:53,876
Sì.

352
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,796
I will.

353
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,956
I will!

354
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:08,871
I, James Neil Arber, take you,
Lara Elizabeth Tyler,

355
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,159
to be my wife, for richer, for
poorer, in sickness and in health...

356
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,285
...to love and cherish

357
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,757
until death us do part. In the
presence of God, I take this vow.

358
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,440
I, Lara Elizabeth Tyler, take you,

359
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:37,085
James Neil Arber, to be my husband,

360
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,680
to have and to hold from this day
forward, for better, for worse,

361
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:47,085
for richer, for poorer,

362
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,140
sickness, health, love, death,
cherish.

363
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:51,160
In the presence of God,
I make this vow.

364
00:31:51,195 --> 00:31:53,116
Who has the rings?

365
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,400
- Steve, what the hell's going on?
- I'll explain it to you later.

366
00:31:58,435 --> 00:32:02,279
The ring text is optional, right?

367
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,445
I now pronounce you man and wife.

368
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,517
- You may kiss the bride.
- Who is this?

369
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,075
John Johnson.

370
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,150
Toilet girl?

371
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,880
We had to buy time to look
for Lara.

372
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:19,965
Who's we? Who's looking for her?

373
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,445
- The gang.
- The gang of beauticians?

374
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,605
Are you mad?
She could have fallen off a cliff!

375
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,000
You think Ballani is gonna believe
this toilet attendant is my wife?

376
00:32:28,035 --> 00:32:30,165
I am not a toilet attendant.

377
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,405
She has been hunted by the press
since she was 15.

378
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,380
So, guess what, that makes her a bit
jumpy. And what have you done?

379
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:37,320
You have lost her on a Hegg with the
one paparazzo she hates the most.

380
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,949
How... When did they do all this?

381
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,525
- This is my job, to protect
her career. - She's retiring.

382
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:49,953
- FYI, there's only you and her
that think that. - Steve. Steve!

383
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,805
- What?
- Is that the press?

384
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,245
Oh, God.
How the hell did this happen?

385
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,605
Can I please have my clothes
and my cheque?

386
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,245
- My mother's expecting me.
- I'm gonna find her.

387
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,360
We need is you charging around
attracting unwanted attention.

388
00:33:06,395 --> 00:33:09,989
Lara is missing.
There might be wolves out there.

389
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,360
You're absolutely right.
I wasn't thinking straight.

390
00:33:13,395 --> 00:33:16,120
Of course, If anybody can find her,
it's you.

391
00:33:16,155 --> 00:33:18,716
- This way, both of you.
- Thank you.

392
00:33:18,751 --> 00:33:21,277
This way. This is the back way out.

393
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,832
- An hour, you said!
- Yeah, well, I'm full of shit.

394
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,405
There must be a way out.

395
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,205
I am not a toilet attendant.
And I did tell you my name.

396
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,080
If only I could remember your name,
we could find a way out of here.

397
00:33:40,115 --> 00:33:42,840
Sorry. It's cruel to give
the servants names, isn't it?

398
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,805
Don't want to get
too attached to them.

399
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,718
Give you a white dress and suddenly
everything's about you.

400
00:33:47,753 --> 00:33:50,597
- This is not your big day, Katie.
- Nor yours, apparently.

401
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,959
You're having an 'Ornithologist's
Wife' themed wedding.

402
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,620
- And if we are?
- I suppose it could be worse.

403
00:34:03,655 --> 00:34:06,520
I could be trapped inside
Stephen King's honeymoon.

404
00:34:06,555 --> 00:34:08,365
Though apparently he's a nice guy.

405
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,000
- How much are you getting paid for
this, in hillbilly money? - No.

406
00:34:12,035 --> 00:34:14,230
So why are we doing that?

407
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,360
As long as they think Lara's in
the castle, they'll camp out there.

408
00:34:18,395 --> 00:34:23,388
As long as they're out there,
they're not looking for Lara.

409
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,180
Come on.

410
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:29,085
Strupak!

411
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,432
- Strupak! A pound.
- It's like tea.

412
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,645
It is tea.

413
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,000
Get a move on,
you carnaptious bampot!

414
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,833
There's money to be made.

415
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,800
A pack of journalists
just stepped off the ferry

416
00:34:43,835 --> 00:34:46,314
wi' more coming over the Minch.

417
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:48,793
It's like the whale all over again.

418
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,472
The happy couple.
Nice arse.

419
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,476
What's this?

420
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,036
IPhone.

421
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,236
Diamond earrings.

422
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,685
It's a party bag, isn't it?

423
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,792
You're getting party bags
from your own wedding.

424
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,485
You're too far gone to understand,
but it's so funny.

425
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm counting all my money on my very
expensive money-counting machine.

426
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:34,845
Bling! Bling!

427
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,480
Hello? Eight times six million

428
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:40,965
I'll just check for you.

429
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,240
Look, try to get your head round
this. I'm marrying Lara Tyler.

430
00:35:45,275 --> 00:35:51,400
I'm not marrying you.
This is Lara's idea... and my idea,

431
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:54,845
of a great wedding.

432
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,520
If I were marrying you, we would be
in the place of your choosing.

433
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,317
The bar of some brightly lit 2 star
hotel, no doubt, draped in tinsel,

434
00:36:00,352 --> 00:36:03,080
drinking German wine and watching
your cousins have sex in the car.

435
00:36:03,115 --> 00:36:05,389
- You're a horrible snob.
- So are you.

436
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,557
What an eclectic library.

437
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,268
Signed. That's tragic.

438
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,040
- Did you sign the register?
- You saw me. Why?

439
00:36:23,075 --> 00:36:25,076
Is that the legal bit?

440
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,759
- I think, in all the fuss,
I may have signed my own name. - So?

441
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,360
I can confirm
that Lara Tyler and James Arber

442
00:37:04,395 --> 00:37:08,120
were finally married today
in a small,

443
00:37:08,155 --> 00:37:09,965
tasteful private ceremony.

444
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,760
They will be leaving for a secret
honeymoon destination

445
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:16,045
in the morning, but, as you can see,

446
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,278
they will be spending their wedding
night in that turret there.

447
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,794
That window there

448
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,916
is where the action is.

449
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,196
- Thank you.
- Is there a picture of the dress?

450
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,120
Don't get the bottom
of the dress wet.

451
00:37:32,155 --> 00:37:33,645
Would you like me to take it off?

452
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,200
- You're not married already? I
imagine that might be helpful. - No.

453
00:37:37,235 --> 00:37:38,525
I remember now. Not married.

454
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,160
But still a world authority
on romance in literature.

455
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:44,760
- When not cruising toilets for men.
- Parasite.

456
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,005
I hope she's made you sign a prenup.

457
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,885
- How did they fit you into
that dress? - She has.

458
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,760
How does that work exactly? When you
get divorced, does she get half

459
00:37:53,795 --> 00:37:56,317
- of your unfinished books?
- I am no parasite.

460
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,805
I didn't even live
with Lara until recently.

461
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,080
She built me this gazebo
in the grounds where I write.

462
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:05,197
She keeps you in a shed
at the bottom of the garden

463
00:38:05,232 --> 00:38:08,280
- like a tortoise.
- Look, you're what? Late 30s?

464
00:38:08,315 --> 00:38:10,525
- 30, just.
- Still living with your mum?

465
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,045
I am living with my mother
temporarily because she is sick.

466
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,240
And what is it you do again? Are you
president of this Hegg Book Club?

467
00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:21,057
- Or do you just administer their
medication? - I too am a writer.

468
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:24,840
- A writer? Of what exactly? - Of
something that people actually read.

469
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:26,845
- Do you write cereal packets?
- Look...

470
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,160
Do you write your name over and over
in the dirt on the back of trucks?

471
00:38:29,195 --> 00:38:33,600
If you must know, I write
for an online menswear catalogue.

472
00:38:33,635 --> 00:38:38,045
A trouser catalogue.
I don't do it anymore.

473
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,920
What, 'five pairs of brown trousers
with elasticated waistbands,

474
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:42,725
£30 while stocks last? '
That kind of thing?

475
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,925
I have also written
the official guidebook to Hegg,

476
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,560
which is accurate than certain other
accounts of life on the island.

477
00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:50,790
That sounds fascinating.

478
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,085
Any news? Have you found her?

479
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,925
Hello! This island is much bigger
than you said, OK? Over.

480
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,040
Perhaps you'd like to do time
in the San Quentin nail bar instead.

481
00:39:02,075 --> 00:39:04,315
Keep looking. Over. And out.

482
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,036
Later.

483
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,679
Where is she?

484
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,680
- So what are we going for, then?
Fat or thin? - Both.

485
00:39:12,715 --> 00:39:15,400
'Podgy Hollywood star looks gaunt

486
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:17,118
on happy day'?

487
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,914
Assholes.

488
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,349
- Hello. - Move along now, ma'am.
No one gets in the castle.

489
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,885
She'll be lucky.

490
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,959
Would you have a portable telephone
that I could per chance borrow?

491
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,312
There's no reception, love.
Payphone in there.

492
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,880
Can I have a ticket
for the telephone, please?

493
00:39:41,915 --> 00:39:44,165
Keep the triples coming. I'm buying.

494
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,080
Look at her. Flashing her cash
about like the Sheikh of Oman.

495
00:39:49,115 --> 00:39:51,640
As if the story was hers to sell.

496
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,040
Hello. I am 'Stars Today'
and I am here to buy copy

497
00:39:58,075 --> 00:40:00,005
for our Lara Tyler wedding special.

498
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,125
Nobody's seen anything
and there are no pictures.

499
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,240
You mean you've got no pictures.
Marco Ballani will have pictures.

500
00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:09,276
What, that Marco Ballani?

501
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,916
Do you have the photo?

502
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,160
Marco! Have you got the photo?

503
00:40:19,195 --> 00:40:21,515
I have nothing.

504
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:28,460
What's this nameless new book
of yours about, then, if it exists?

505
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:33,560
It's about the end of the world
as seen through the eyes of God.

506
00:40:33,595 --> 00:40:35,516
Oh, dear.

507
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,325
Did no one tell you
to write about what you know?

508
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,060
She thinks you're a genius,
doesn't she? And you're trying

509
00:40:43,095 --> 00:40:45,760
to be one so you're good enough
to be with Lara Tyler.

510
00:40:45,795 --> 00:40:48,797
But it's left you totally blocked.
Pathetic.

511
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,600
Still living with your mum,
pretending to be a movie star,

512
00:40:51,635 --> 00:40:54,200
writing a guidebook about an island
no one will ever visit.

513
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:56,031
That's pathetic.

514
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,189
I'm going to open my presents now.

515
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,633
Ah! Did you not get your picture?

516
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,680
- Do I know you?
- No, you do not.

517
00:41:15,715 --> 00:41:19,085
No, I know only her.

518
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,560
Did you know she lived in her pool
for 2 weeks

519
00:41:21,595 --> 00:41:23,391
before filming 'The Drowning'?

520
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,325
I lived above her in her
pool house roof.

521
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,360
We are both obsessional
compulsional types, you know.

522
00:41:30,395 --> 00:41:33,325
- You didn't sell these?
- They are too personal.

523
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,318
And only now she has married someone
else do I realise...

524
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,714
I love her.
I am a cavern of longingness.

525
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,553
- Is that good English?
- Yeah.

526
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,998
I don't get it.

527
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,959
Lara and I like big cat
documentaries. Deal with it.

528
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,200
- What are you doing here?
- Where's Lara?

529
00:42:16,235 --> 00:42:17,965
As if I'd tell you.

530
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,300
Behind the back of the world's
most fascinating woman,

531
00:42:20,335 --> 00:42:22,600
you drink champagne
and you cavort with prostitutes.

532
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:24,830
I'm not a prostitute.

533
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,525
- I'm his wife.
- She is a horrendous mistake.

534
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,712
You have failed again to marry Lara.
This is a better match for you.

535
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,680
I'm sorry but I can't take your call
right now If that's Random House,

536
00:42:46,715 --> 00:42:49,285
I've had a succession
of computer issues and an illness,

537
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,550
it's going really well and I'll be
mailing some chapters at the week.

538
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,550
Well, it looks like I might have hit
on my very own Lara Tyler exclusive.

539
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,031
Are you gonna fight like a man
or just throw puffins at me?

540
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,200
I will find her. And when I find
her, I will have her.

541
00:43:35,235 --> 00:43:37,430
Not very likely.

542
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,276
Look.

543
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,125
- What are you doing? - I'm just
nipping out for some milk.

544
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,000
- What do you think you are? Tarzan?
- Lara's got a climbing wall.

545
00:44:11,035 --> 00:44:12,956
Of course she has.

546
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,360
- It's been an absolute pleasure.
- Oh, I'm staying here, am I?

547
00:44:16,395 --> 00:44:20,037
What makes your girlfriend more
of a priority than my sick mother?

548
00:44:20,072 --> 00:44:23,680
- There might be wolves out there.
- Wolves? There's no wolves.

549
00:44:23,715 --> 00:44:26,457
We don't even have bees.
She might stand on a hedgehog,

550
00:44:26,492 --> 00:44:29,165
which would be good, actually,
because we're overrun.

551
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,760
Save it for the second edition
of your dreary little guidebook.

552
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,716
If there is one.

553
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,565
Right, wait there. I'm coming
with you. I'm coming down.

554
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,520
The pedalo's full of water. You'll
get the bottom of the dress wet.

555
00:44:45,555 --> 00:44:48,440
You'll be released back into the
community shortly. Get back inside!

556
00:44:48,475 --> 00:44:50,476
- Goodbye!
- Stupid nails.

557
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,032
Don't look at my legs. Please.

558
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,999
You got the bottom of the dress wet.

559
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,560
- Thanks for saving my life.
- I'm sorry you nearly drowned.

560
00:46:09,595 --> 00:46:12,960
Don't be.
My life flashed in front of my eyes,

561
00:46:12,995 --> 00:46:15,725
and halfway through
I was just bored.

562
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,435
- Being drowned was a highlight.
- Me too, actually.

563
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,845
Quite nice to do something
productive for once.

564
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,591
You were right about me
staying with my mum. I am a loser.

565
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,400
Well, you were right
about my book being a bit soulless.

566
00:46:37,435 --> 00:46:39,356
And about me being blocked.

567
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,876
- I guess I'm the bigger loser.
- I'm definitely the bigger loser.

568
00:46:44,911 --> 00:46:49,513
- Oh, no. Not by a long shot. - Why
do you have to be so competitive?

569
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,950
...computer issues and an illness,
but it's going really well and...

570
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,005
James, I'm sorry.
I can't get into the castle.

571
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,200
You know in your book, the place
where they kiss? Meet me there.

572
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,954
Bring the priest and the rings.
I love you. I do love you.

573
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,630
The place where they kiss.

574
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,800
This is very kind of you, but
there's really no need. I can do it.

575
00:47:15,835 --> 00:47:17,756
Och, I insist.

576
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,068
I thought you were wonderful
in 'The Wolf and the Moon. '

577
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,000
So... Thank you for getting
the word out about my wedding.

578
00:47:29,035 --> 00:47:31,600
- How did it go?
- It didn't.

579
00:47:31,635 --> 00:47:33,556
Thanks to you.

580
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,396
Knock, knock.

581
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,396
Quills.

582
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,325
Christmas present from Lara.

583
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,716
She thought they might help
with the writing.

584
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,310
Must have been a terrible concert.

585
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:53,150
- Dad, gone.
We don't talk about him. - OK.

586
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,591
Throw the money over. The money
or the wheelchair with you in it.

587
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,596
Come on.

588
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,996
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

589
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,796
I'm thinking about it.

590
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,751
It needs... everything.

591
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,996
I like it.

592
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,220
April really is the cruellest month.

593
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:52,165
- Poor Angus.
- Sorry. Is he your?

594
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:57,300
No. Should have been, probably,
but I only go for arty types

595
00:50:57,335 --> 00:51:02,400
with monster commitment issues.
My ex-fiancé was in a band.

596
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:05,797
They just had a top 40 hit
with the song 'Bed Hopper'.

597
00:51:05,832 --> 00:51:09,125
- So the clues were there.
- I thought it was ironic.

598
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:14,000
Stupid. But, then, I also thought
he liked girls who, you know,

599
00:51:14,035 --> 00:51:17,045
give intelligent feedback.

600
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,920
And so he told me
I was just one song,

601
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:22,876
not a whole album.

602
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,565
I'm finished with relationships.

603
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,797
- They say it's when you stop
looking that you... - Get married?

604
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,045
Actually, marriage is becoming
surprisingly bearable.

605
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,760
At least the fact that you are going
to leave me for another woman

606
00:51:39,795 --> 00:51:42,069
has been agreed in advance.

607
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,676
What's she like?

608
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:50,000
I suppose she's just like
anybody else, just a normal girl.

609
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:54,391
No. No, she's rare and fine

610
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,640
and peculiar and modest.
And generous.

611
00:51:59,675 --> 00:52:02,108
And really, really nice.

612
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,030
And brilliant. At everything.

613
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,430
But can she do this?

614
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,430
No, I don't believe she can.

615
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,300
So you did all that with just
candle wax and powder?

616
00:52:35,335 --> 00:52:37,840
- Yeah. Is it all off?
- Yes. You're so beautiful.

617
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:40,205
I'm sorry I sold your story.

618
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,725
I need to get off this island,
you see, and soon.

619
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,925
And I need to see the world
and be thrown into a volcano.

620
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,192
- It is my destiny. - Oh, my God.
I just realised who you are.

621
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,480
You're Maggie,
the ornithologist's wife.

622
00:52:53,515 --> 00:52:56,285
James based her on you.

623
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,960
Maggie who would not bend,
who turns on her oppressors.

624
00:52:59,995 --> 00:53:02,285
Yes, that's me.

625
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:07,155
- You have been
such an inspiration to me. - Thanks.

626
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,360
I've just been kicked in the face
by the most beautiful woman

627
00:53:12,395 --> 00:53:15,477
in the world who is now walking
around outside dressed

628
00:53:15,512 --> 00:53:18,560
as my old boarding-school matron.
I will pay 200 grand

629
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:21,233
for that cover shot. Go and get it.

630
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:32,600
Retro classic.
100%/ pure new wool in a 13oz cloth.

631
00:53:32,635 --> 00:53:35,845
Untouched since 1978.

632
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,633
What would I do without you?

633
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,400
Katie, there's money on Whale Beach,
enough for us to go away.

634
00:53:42,435 --> 00:53:45,756
But we have to get down there
before the tide comes in.

635
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,149
- Connor?
- No, Mum.

636
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,440
- This is my husband.
- Your husband?

637
00:53:56,475 --> 00:53:58,617
It's been a bit crazy. Hi. James.

638
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,725
Why is he dressed as your father?

639
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,355
- Well, his girlfriend's missing...
- He has a girlfriend?

640
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,445
- Is this Toilet Man?
- What?

641
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,519
- The man you made a pass
at in the toilet. - No.

642
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,900
Why is there money on Whale Beach?

643
00:54:14,935 --> 00:54:16,965
Lara Tyler made me throw the cash

644
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,285
I got from selling her
wedding over the cliff.

645
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,640
She's not married.
She's on her way to Cathedral Cove

646
00:54:22,675 --> 00:54:24,312
to meet James Arber.

647
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,996
James...

648
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,756
Arber?

649
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,796
Indeed.

650
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,360
Very clever. So you manufactured
this whole situation.

651
00:54:37,395 --> 00:54:38,645
Big sack of cash for telling
the press,

652
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,400
another for playing the decoy.
When it's all over,

653
00:54:40,435 --> 00:54:41,805
the same again to set the record
straight.

654
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,620
Quite an industry you've made out of
ruining other people's happiness.

655
00:54:44,655 --> 00:54:47,400
Making cow eyes at me for hours
to add a little spice to the story.

656
00:54:47,435 --> 00:54:49,085
- Cow eyes?
- Let me tell you.

657
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,157
For a honeytrap to work,
there needs to be honey.

658
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,156
Do you like him?

659
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,360
He's an emotionally
retarded arty boy

660
00:55:16,395 --> 00:55:18,635
who's in love with another woman.

661
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,753
- Of course I like him.
- Did you tell him?

662
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,240
A life spent making mistakes
is so much better

663
00:55:28,275 --> 00:55:30,125
than a life spent doing
nothing.

664
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,120
Falling for your father was
the best mistake I ever made.

665
00:55:34,155 --> 00:55:35,314
I got you.

666
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,033
My worst mistake
was not going after him.

667
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,365
No. Would rather die.

668
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,920
Really? Then we'll get a big photo
of him and put it on the wall

669
00:55:46,955 --> 00:55:51,198
and you can throw darts at it
for the rest of your life.

670
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,910
Where do these stupid people kiss?

671
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,000
Hello. I'm wondering if you can
help me. Thank you.

672
00:56:15,035 --> 00:56:18,160
Is the Cathedral nearby,
or any other coves?

673
00:56:18,195 --> 00:56:19,957
I've become rather lost.

674
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,240
Oh, great. Now I've been recognised.

675
00:56:30,275 --> 00:56:33,125
Yes, I am James Arber.

676
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,045
I am marrying Lara Tyler.
Probably.

677
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,240
But if you could try not to mention
it to anyone

678
00:56:39,275 --> 00:56:41,470
and please don't call the press.

679
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,156
All right, yes.

680
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,360
Oh, no. No, that's not me.
That's...

681
00:56:55,395 --> 00:56:58,830
OK. Who to?

682
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,993
I'll just leave it blank for eBay.

683
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,956
I'll be getting along in a moment.
You've been very kind.

684
00:57:11,991 --> 00:57:14,993
But if you had a map of Hegg
I could possibly borrow...

685
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,353
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.
No. No.

686
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,870
Well, I might be a bit rusty.

687
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,791
Yeah. I've been concentrating
on the zither is the thing.

688
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,276
Beautiful.

689
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,075
Both deaf.

690
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,356
OK, one more. Yeah.

691
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,359
Hello, Mairead. Caleb.

692
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,125
Mild out, isn't it?

693
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,799
It's this global warming.

694
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:51,278
I heard my husband playing
the bagpipes.

695
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,112
It's a long story.

696
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:09,280
- Thank you. I was just coming back
to find you. - Really?

697
00:59:09,315 --> 00:59:11,191
Yeah. We need to get divorced.

698
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,005
Yes. Yes, of course.

699
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:21,591
We should go and find Reverend
McDonagh. He'll know what to do.

700
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,676
OK, don't flip out, but James
and that girl, they've escaped.

701
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,154
We need local intelligence.

702
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,038
Who's that awful woman?

703
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:48,240
I don't know where any of them are.
No one's been here.

704
00:59:48,275 --> 00:59:50,993
Yeah, see, I just don't believe you.

705
00:59:51,028 --> 00:59:53,712
Look, they could be anywhere by now.

706
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:00,000
But I think you know where they are.
And I think for the right price,

707
01:00:00,035 --> 01:00:01,956
you'll tell me.

708
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:07,525
I didn't sell your wedding.
My mum did.

709
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,360
- She's dying and a bit pissed
off about it. - Oh, I'm sorry.

710
01:00:11,395 --> 01:00:15,240
She just wants to see the world
before she goes.

711
01:00:15,275 --> 01:00:18,915
Ah, look. It's my country residence.

712
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,875
Quick, come on. Come on.

713
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,080
- Where in God's name are we? - This
book says it's a wildlife centre.

714
01:00:34,115 --> 01:00:36,496
You're a bleeding woman
with your map reading.

715
01:00:36,531 --> 01:00:38,878
No, it's the book. It's all wrong.
It's so heavy.

716
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,716
Is somebody there?

717
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:53,520
- Incomers! Incomers! - Sorry, love.
Didn't realise anyone lived here.

718
01:00:53,555 --> 01:00:57,274
- I'll throw another puffin on the
griddle for you. - No, thanks.

719
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,077
Griddled puffin? On a Friday?

720
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,520
Ah, our first home.
What a life we could have had.

721
01:01:09,555 --> 01:01:12,398
Yeah. Come on.

722
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,360
So you think this Reverend McDonagh
can help untangle us?

723
01:01:20,395 --> 01:01:24,480
Well, I can't recall going to him
with a similar problem,

724
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:26,436
but, yes, he'll know what to do.

725
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,560
There's something about islands,
isn't there?

726
01:01:30,595 --> 01:01:32,357
Or is it just that I'm from one?

727
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,759
- No, there's something about
islands. - And this is just Hegg.

728
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,560
We're the plain Jane
of the Hebrides.

729
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:42,774
You should see Barra. It's stunning.

730
01:01:42,809 --> 01:01:45,954
I like this one.
It's beautiful.

731
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,869
I wish I'd come here sooner.

732
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,715
- Stay away from her, Englishman!
- Angus!

733
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,600
- Mr April? - You come over here,
taking our women.

734
01:02:05,635 --> 01:02:08,239
Your women? Angus, don't!

735
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,320
Run away with me. I never thought
I had a chance with you

736
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:16,600
until you came back and then...
Marry me.

737
01:02:16,635 --> 01:02:20,285
You are married to Muireen.

738
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:24,200
But I don't want her. I never wanted
her. I always wanted you.

739
01:02:24,235 --> 01:02:27,160
Shame. You're married,
she's married. Oh, what a tragedy.

740
01:02:27,195 --> 01:02:29,520
She's married? Who to?

741
01:02:29,555 --> 01:02:31,405
To me.

742
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,396
Is that true?

743
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,120
Right, then. I'll fight you for her.

744
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:41,280
- No.
- No, no. I don't fight.

745
01:02:41,315 --> 01:02:43,080
I win. I get to keep her.

746
01:02:43,115 --> 01:02:45,036
Angus!

747
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,800
I wanted to grow old with you.
You're beautiful and clever now.

748
01:02:53,835 --> 01:02:55,325
It's easy to love you now.

749
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,240
But I'll still love you
when the wind's dried you out.

750
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:01,710
And when you're old and broken.
Will he?

751
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,120
Angus, I'm sorry.
Go back to Muireen.

752
01:03:09,155 --> 01:03:11,759
Sort it out. She loves you.

753
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,273
It's better
when people love you back.

754
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,076
So do you love him?

755
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,869
- Come on.
- I'm all right here.

756
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,445
Wow. It's just amazing.

757
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,995
I used to come out here a lot,
on my own.

758
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,720
Only married 5 minutes and already
chasing after another woman, eh?

759
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:04,245
Why not give this marriage
a go first?

760
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,239
Because the woman he's engaged
to is Lara Tyler.

761
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,035
She's an actress.

762
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:18,000
She's ultra beautiful,
mind-blowingly talented,

763
01:04:18,035 --> 01:04:22,445
and rare, and fine, and modest,

764
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,840
and generous, and nice,
and brilliant at everything.

765
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:30,257
- But he's married to you.
- Exactly.

766
01:04:30,292 --> 01:04:33,346
A mind-blowingly ordinary
shop assistant

767
01:04:33,381 --> 01:04:36,400
from the Outer Hebrides.
Bit of a comedown.

768
01:04:36,435 --> 01:04:38,356
You're not ordinary.

769
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,440
She could be Miss Universe
with a Nobel Peace Prize

770
01:04:43,475 --> 01:04:46,876
and she'd still be wrong
for somebody.

771
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:50,828
Weddings are like sunsets.
The romance of a moment.

772
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,480
Marriage is the sea
into which that red sun sets.

773
01:04:55,515 --> 01:04:57,885
We got married by mistake.

774
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:02,325
- Probably not the strongest basis
for an enduring marriage. - No.

775
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:07,760
Then, in days past, the MacNeils of
Barra, huge ginger brutes they were,

776
01:05:07,795 --> 01:05:11,560
would cross the Minch to Hegg
to steal our sheep

777
01:05:11,595 --> 01:05:13,645
and snatch a wife at the same time.

778
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:17,360
But if we could reclaim the woman
before consummation,

779
01:05:17,395 --> 01:05:21,005
the marriage didn't count.
It's still in Hegg law.

780
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,880
So if we can make it
to Cathedral Cove before nightfall,

781
01:05:23,915 --> 01:05:27,394
your licence with Miss Tyler
would still be valid

782
01:05:27,429 --> 01:05:30,873
and the original ceremony
could go ahead as planned.

783
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,032
If that's what you really want.

784
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,205
How long have we got
before it gets dark?

785
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:41,640
About half an hour. When God made
time, he made plenty of it.

786
01:05:41,675 --> 01:05:45,030
When God made twine,
he made balls of it.

787
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:52,191
Well, you think about it
while I get my things ready.

788
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:58,200
Oh, one last thing.
Has the marriage been consummated?

789
01:05:58,235 --> 01:06:02,432
- No.
- I just haven't had time.

790
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,239
When God made time...

791
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,598
Hello?

792
01:06:12,633 --> 01:06:14,476
Lara?

793
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,156
James?

794
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:22,672
- Why has she brought us here?
- What is this place?

795
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,885
How do you know when
you've met 'the one'?

796
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,480
Whenever you look at them,
you find yourself singing

797
01:06:36,515 --> 01:06:39,438
'You Are The Wind Beneath My Wings. '

798
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,125
Is that what happens
when you're with Lara?

799
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,816
They asked 10,000 men
to name their ideal partner

800
01:06:47,851 --> 01:06:51,472
and 9,800 said Lara.
Statistically that includes

801
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,676
at least 800 gay men.

802
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,920
If you're male and Lara Tyler's
interested in you, she's the one,

803
01:06:57,955 --> 01:06:59,876
it's kind of a rule.

804
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,913
If you can't be happy
with Lara Tyler,

805
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,480
you can't be happy with anyone.

806
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:19,154
You are sure about this? Because you
seem like a good match to me.

807
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:37,118
Do you, James Neil Arber,
take Katie Nic Aodh

808
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:42,156
- as your lawful wedded wife?
- No, I do not.

809
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:47,525
And do you, Katie Nic Aodh,
take James Neil Arber

810
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:53,669
- as your lawful wedded husband?
- Absolutely not. No. Thank you.

811
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:59,880
I would ask if you would now remove
and return your rings as a sign

812
01:07:59,915 --> 01:08:01,916
that you are not married.

813
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,912
Follow soon. We need to hurry.

814
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,791
Good thing there are no pets
involved.

815
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,560
If I wasn't in the middle
of the Atlantic

816
01:08:38,595 --> 01:08:40,720
after one of the strangest days
of my life,

817
01:08:40,755 --> 01:08:42,676
I'd...

818
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,070
James, wait.

819
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,357
If things don't work out
with Lara...

820
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,068
I mean, she's perfect, obviously.

821
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:07,205
But she gives you block.

822
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,710
So maybe you're not one
of the 9,800.

823
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,634
That's not so impossible, is it?

824
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:19,949
Because then
you could not marry her.

825
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:25,517
Then you could stay here.
With me.

826
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,756
I know.

827
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:57,110
This is where you tell me
I'm just one chapter,

828
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,476
not a whole book.

829
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,238
Go.

830
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,357
Go.

831
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:32,845
Guys! Lara's Tyler's not
in the castle.

832
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,960
They're getting married
now in the haunted toilets.

833
01:10:35,995 --> 01:10:38,793
It's a local tradition. This way!

834
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,630
- You OK? - Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

835
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:54,671
I don't really like big cat
documentaries.

836
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,636
That's OK.

837
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,155
If we're going to do this,
we'll have to be quick.

838
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:05,277
Do you wanna taste the icing?
Do you wanna taste the icing?

839
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,556
What is that?

840
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:17,040
Now, sweetie, I may look like
a simple, cake-baking,

841
01:12:17,075 --> 01:12:21,033
small-town mom, but inside...

842
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:25,195
I am a prize fighter,
and I will not rest while there

843
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,000
is a single rod of depleted uranium
anywhere

844
01:12:29,035 --> 01:12:31,833
in South Carolina.

845
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:37,480
Powerful stuff there. Lara Tyler
in 'Depleted', out on Friday.

846
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,805
There had been rumours
of retirement.

847
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,400
Last summer I was maybe thinking
of leading a more quiet life,

848
01:12:44,435 --> 01:12:46,356
but...

849
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,080
then I met this amazing
Scottish woman.

850
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:51,965
Terminally ill, never complained.

851
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,920
Actually, no, she did complain
about a lot of things.

852
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:59,071
I heard recently
that she passed away.

853
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:05,038
But I was able to help her fulfill
her dream to travel the world.

854
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,116
Thank you, Lara.

855
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,445
Hegg - An Island History,
Second Edition.

856
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:57,360
The Hegg is the furthermost drop
of the outermost spray

857
01:13:57,395 --> 01:14:00,285
of the curling wave
of the Outer Hebrides.

858
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,600
But for those curious enough
to take some time to discover her,

859
01:14:03,635 --> 01:14:07,565
Hegg's cliffs and moorlands,
meadows and sandy beaches

860
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,991
reveal her to be an island ready
to exceed all expectations,

861
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,805
a tiny rock of perfection

862
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:18,389
jutting out of the restless
Hebridean Sea.

863
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,553
This is James Arber's new book.
Much better, more mature.

864
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,636
And only one chapter.

865
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,245
Look. He dedicated it to Lara.

866
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:32,560
Katie, but you're leaving again,
so soon.

867
01:14:32,595 --> 01:14:34,685
Guidebooks don't write themselves.

868
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,965
But I'll never forget who gave me
my big break.

869
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,497
I just came in to say hi and bye.
I'm on the four o'clock boat.

870
01:14:41,532 --> 01:14:44,994
I've got a flight out to New Delhi
and then onto Singapore.

871
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:48,790
Harder to hit a moving target, eh?

872
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,160
I should have known that bloody
guidebook would take off.

873
01:14:53,195 --> 01:14:55,116
Idiot.

874
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,434
It's not the same without you,
Katie.

875
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,758
Never was. We miss you.
I miss you.

876
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,956
There Katie, that's for you.

877
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:09,552
It's a bride.
For luck. It's the last one.

878
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,445
- Thank you.
- That'll be £1.50.

879
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:18,120
- You off again, then, Katie?
- I'm trying to.

880
01:15:18,155 --> 01:15:20,680
She'll be back.
Her dad was a traveller,

881
01:15:20,715 --> 01:15:23,877
but her mam was a 'stay-at-home'.

882
01:15:23,912 --> 01:15:27,039
No, I'm not sure she was, deep down.

883
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,205
I really need to...

884
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,196
I'll warrant you're a bit of both.

885
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,116
Goodbye, all.

886
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,116
Hallo!

887
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,948
Hello! Hello.

888
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:22,525
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.

889
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,360
I was hoping for our first meeting
to be a bit more casual.

890
01:16:26,395 --> 01:16:29,125
What are you doing here?

891
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,520
I've been trying to get your
attention with conventional weapons,

892
01:16:32,555 --> 01:16:35,405
- phones, emails, that sort of
thing. - I've been away.

893
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,080
Yeah, and you're leaving again.
Did you not read my new book?

894
01:16:38,115 --> 01:16:43,165
- Not so much, no.
- You really should have read it.

895
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,600
- The Hegg Book Club gave it seven
and a half. - Seven and a half?

896
01:16:47,635 --> 01:16:49,397
That's generous
for the Hegg Book Club.

897
01:16:49,432 --> 01:16:51,125
They said it picked
up around page six.

898
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:55,520
- So you didn't see the dedication?
- It's dedicated to Lara.

899
01:16:55,555 --> 01:16:58,159
No! It's not!

900
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,836
It's not!

901
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:11,239
"To my wife.
A chapter can be a book. "

902
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,633
- What does he mean, a chapter
can be a book? - I don't know.

903
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,436
I don't know.

904
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,038
Have you got a radio?

905
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,574
He said to tell you,
the only person he ever wed was you.

906
01:17:39,609 --> 01:17:42,989
But he and Lara let the press think
they were married.

907
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,556
He's not married?

908
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:55,192
Katie, shall we go back?

909
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,516
Would you mind?

910
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,720
I can't believe you didn't read
my book.

911
01:18:19,755 --> 01:18:21,805
I couldn't really bring myself to.

912
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:26,152
Well, I hope you will one day,
because there's a character in there

913
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,994
kind of reminds me a lot of you.

914
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,240
It's a book about a man,
a really stupid man,

915
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:35,845
who makes a really bad decision,

916
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:39,429
and how he loses somebody
amazing from his life.

917
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:45,477
And how he comes to realise
he cannot continue in his life...

918
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,516
without her.

919
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,153
They say write about what you know.

920
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:01,231
So, obviously, I set it against the
backdrop of the Spanish Civil War.

921
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,005
- And Lara?
- She's absolutely fine.

922
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,340
We agreed we weren't right
for each other.

923
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:13,640
By the way, I read your
excellent guidebook.

924
01:19:13,675 --> 01:19:15,525
Really?

925
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:19,800
How embarrassing. I've been quite
rude about you in the new edition.

926
01:19:19,835 --> 01:19:23,509
Well, I love intelligent feedback.

927
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:26,620
And you're back
on Hegg now because?

928
01:19:26,655 --> 01:19:29,525
I'm on a sheep-stealing raid, yeah.

929
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:34,190
I thought I might grab myself
a woman at the same time, but...

930
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:39,629
Predominantly,
it's a sheep-snatching thing.

931
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,116
Do you want me to sign that for you?

932
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,996
Hey.

933
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,796
Hi.

934
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,836
I like this one.
