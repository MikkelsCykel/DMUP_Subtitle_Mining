There's a personal file.
Do you mind if I open it?

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,310
<i>No, sure. Go ahead.</i>

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,881
<i>Ti amo.</i>

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,361
<i>So you'd better ask that kind,
nice husband of yours to translate.</i>

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,490
He's got very delicate little ears.

6
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,933
He's dreaming
about his favorite things.

7
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:31,063
<i>He's dreaming about...</i>

8
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:34,540
a world without any weeds.

Justin Quayle,
it's time to get up.

10
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:45,048
Go away.
You're very annoying.
Time to get up, Justin.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,887
Get up.

12
00:00:54,663 --> 00:00:59,157
This is really just not fair.

13
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:01,759
It's time to get up.

14
00:01:01,837 --> 00:01:05,136
<i>Tessa, just let me sleep.</i>

15
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:07,573
<i>There's gardening to be done.</i>

16
00:01:07,643 --> 00:01:10,942
<i>Weeds to be pulled out.</i>

17
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,375
<i>Good morning.
Come back to bed.</i>

18
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:19,519
<i>Good morning.</i>

19
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:21,613
<i>Oh, sweetheart.</i>

20
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,968
<i>Moral dilemma, Ham.</i>

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,840
<i>And the person that I most
want to tell can't be told.</i>

22
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:47,742
<i>I had a creepy love letter today.</i>

23
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,909
It's not your fault.

24
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,283
<i>From a five-star creep.</i>

25
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:54,845
You've got to move on, huh?

26
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:58,484
<i>I've cold-bloodedly led on.</i>

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,996
<i>I stole something from him.</i>

28
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:06,125
<i>And worse,
I made him a vile promise...</i>

29
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:11,434
<i>that I have absolutely
no intention ofkeeping.</i>

30
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:15,966
Oh, do come in.
Yeah, please. Of course.

31
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:18,239
Thank you.

32
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:20,975
You lead the way.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Take a left.

33
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:26,612
<i>I really hate to think how
it would hurtJustin ifhe knew.</i>

34
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,555
<i>I've violated his code, Ham,</i>

35
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:33,253
<i>in the most cynical way.</i>

36
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:36,661
<i>And the end
thatjustifies my means?</i>

37
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:41,829
<i>I need this creep to help me
blackmail Her Majesty's government.</i>

38
00:02:41,903 --> 00:02:45,964
<i>Please tell me I'm not a ruthless bitch.</i>

39
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:50,705
<i>Please tell me thatJustin
would understand ifhe knew.</i>

40
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:54,146
<i>If you give me the wrong answer,
then I will push you into the Tiber...</i>

41
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,844
<i>like I did when we were 16.</i>

42
00:02:57,986 --> 00:03:00,011
<i>Ciao, my darling.</i>

43
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,249
<i>Thank you.
For what?</i>

44
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:08,922
<i>For this wonderful gift.</i>

45
00:03:08,997 --> 00:03:12,091
How very generous of me.

46
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:15,068
No,I..

47
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:31,779
Here, Justin, put this on.

48
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,594
I like it here.
This is where you work from?
Mm.

49
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:53,266
Amnesty.

50
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,275
<i>Won't make any difference.</i>

51
00:03:55,343 --> 00:03:57,504
<i>That's the official line
of the Foreign Office.</i>

52
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:01,743
<i>I thought you were like that.
I thought you were one of those
privileged revolutionaries.</i>

53
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:17,058
<i>- My lady.
- Am I?</i>

54
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:21,626
<i>These plants, If they were children,
you'd be prosecuted.</i>

55
00:04:21,703 --> 00:04:25,799
<i>I do water them.
When I remember.</i>

56
00:04:32,714 --> 00:04:35,080
<i>You say you're all into saving lives
around the world,</i>

57
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,778
<i>but you let your poor plants die.</i>

58
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:40,686
<i>I say put people first.</i>

59
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:47,126
<i>Why don't you water them?
You're being cruel.</i>

60
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:50,695
I feel safe with you.

61
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:54,626
<i>I can imagine when you were six.</i>

62
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:56,671
<i>You leading the revolution.</i>

63
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,919
Ham? Hi. It's Justin.
Listen.

64
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:17,118
Do you still represent that
dodgy client in Amsterdam?

65
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:22,620
Sorry.

66
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:28,467
Sorry. Sorry. I only just got it.
Directions for use.

67
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,437
No air travel, no credit cards.

68
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:34,600
Never say your name on the phone,
or the computers will kick in.

69
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:37,042
Dodgy client adds,
"Welcome to my world."

70
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:39,876
Well, I don't want his world.
No choice, old chum.

71
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:42,109
Actually, I'm getting
a bit paranoid myself.

72
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:45,175
Look, suppose I posited
that all this was just coincidence-

73
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:47,221
Tess killed by bandits,
pure and simple...

74
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:49,450
and that you're being
as paranoid as she was.

75
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:51,719
Ham.

76
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,822
Thanks for trying, Ham.

77
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,696
I have to finish what she started.

78
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:02,703
Well, look, look. I've got the address
of Aunt Claudia, the old bat in Rome.

79
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:05,569
If you need to contact me,
you'd better do it through her.

80
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,870
She adored Tess.

81
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:12,679
I failed her, Ham.

82
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,806
I lost my faith in her.

83
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:16,748
No, she forgives you.

84
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:20,715
She loved you rotten too,
you know.

85
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,519
You think?
Oh, yeah.

86
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:29,062
Thank you.

87
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,682
<i>It seems our erstwhile colleague
has disappeared.</i>

88
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:30,589
Four days ago he lunched
in London with Pellegrin,

89
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:36,096
<i>who describes him as overwrought,
after which he visited his wife's lawyer...</i>

90
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,689
before going off our radar.

91
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:42,066
The poor man seems
to have convinced himself...

92
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:46,870
there was a conspiracy against Tessa
in which we are all complicit.

93
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:52,235
<i>Lfhe has left the U.K.,
he did so without a passport.</i>

94
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:57,148
<i>Therefore, any contact from Justin
must be reported to me immediately.</i>

95
00:07:57,218 --> 00:07:59,550
In his own best interest.

96
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:04,788
No point asking if you've
heard from him, I suppose?

97
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,623
No, no, Tim, none at all.

98
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:12,689
Birgit, why are ThreeBees spending
$70 million testing Dypraxa for KDH?

99
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:15,065
I mean, is the African market
worth that much?

100
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:17,468
Tessa, you have to understand
the scale of this.

101
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,236
There is a T.B. Epidemic coming.
It will affect the entire world.

102
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:25,473
<i>Or, put into the language that stock
exchanges all over the world understand,</i>

103
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,209
<i>if the T.B. Market performs as forecast,</i>

104
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:31,252
<i>billions and billions of dollars
are waiting to be earned.</i>

105
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,719
<i>And the boy to earn them is Dypraxa.</i>

106
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:37,019
<i>Lf, of course,
the preliminary trials in Africa...</i>

107
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:40,220
<i>have not thrown up
any disturbing side effects.</i>

108
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,851
<i>Ich suche Birgit.</i>

109
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,125
<i>Ich bin Justin Quayle,</i>

110
00:09:12,193 --> 00:09:14,423
<i>Tessa Quayle's Ehemann.</i>

111
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:25,462
Michael Adams.

112
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:36,249
Okay, Herr Adams.

113
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:41,955
She collects Karl at 3:00
from the kindergarten at Bahnhofstrasse.

114
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,658
<i>¶¶</i>

115
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:08,306
Karl, here.

116
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:16,186
Birgit.

117
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:19,192
You sent this to my wife.

118
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,194
Justin.

119
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:24,663
I need to talk to you.
Our computers
were stolen last night.

120
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:26,723
Yes, I know.
They have never gone
this far before.

121
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:29,167
I can't be seen with you.
Sorry. I've Karl to think of.

122
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:31,296
Is there some safe place
we could talk?

123
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:33,636
Nowhere. Nowhere safe.
Nowhere?

124
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,700
Please. Just... a few questions.

125
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:39,508
Okay, let's talk here.
With these people.
All right.

126
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:43,517
Okay. My bike's across the street.
Ask your questions before we get to it.

127
00:10:43,585 --> 00:10:45,018
Is it a scam?
Scam?

128
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:48,522
Dypraxa.
Does it cure T.B.
Yes, it cures.

129
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,821
But it can also kill, you know,
because they haven't got
the formula right.

130
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:54,623
Right. So why don't they work on that?

131
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,033
It's cheaper to fix the trials.

132
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:04,469
Exclude the patients that
have side effects, you know.

133
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,474
To go back to the lab would
cost them time- two years-

134
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:11,808
millions of dollars, and other companies
would have time to produce their own cures.

135
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,870
Okay, next question.

136
00:11:13,948 --> 00:11:16,473
You said to Tessa in your e-mails
that the Kenyan government
had approved the trials.

137
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,076
Somebody bribed them.
Who?

138
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:21,553
ThreeBees, Lorbeer.
We don't know.

139
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:25,923
But $50,000 in the right hands,
and you can test battery acid
as skin lotion.

140
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:28,053
My bike's there.

141
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:31,098
Stop! Stop!

142
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:33,998
Stop!

143
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,118
<i>Who is Lorbeer?</i>

144
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:03,595
Birgit, is it a company?

145
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:06,532
A white coat.
He invented Dypraxa.

146
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,694
<i>When patients started to die,
Lorbeerjumped clear.</i>

147
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,399
<i>Is that why Tessa went to Lokichogio?
Is that where Lorbeer is?</i>

148
00:12:12,473 --> 00:12:14,532
Disappeared.
Murdered?

149
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,476
Disappeared.
We've gotta go. I'm sorry.

150
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:19,479
Where can I find him?

151
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:37,396
Birgit? Where?

152
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,400
Go back to Africa.
Lorbeer's still there.

00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:51,120
<i>Tessa, why didn't you tell me?</i>

157
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,027
<i>I could have helped you.</i>

158
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:03,872
<i>It is my sad duty to inform you
that Dr. Bluhm has been found.</i>

159
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,970
<i>I'll spare you the details.</i>

160
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:08,914
<i>Suffice to say, the poor fellow...</i>

161
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:12,714
<i>seems to have been tortured to death
on the same day Tessa was killed.</i>

162
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,221
<i>Which would seem to exonerate him.</i>

163
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,757
<i>Seem? So what's the new theory?</i>

164
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:20,089
That he tortured himself to death?

165
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:22,254
That'd save you looking
for anyone else, wouldn't it?

166
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,059
Moving on.

167
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,831
<i>What is the purpose of your visit?</i>

168
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:36,843
I'm seeing a friend.

169
00:15:38,913 --> 00:15:42,440
<i>Welcome to Kenya, Mr. Black.
Thank you.</i>

170
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,676
Has anyone seen
ThreeBees' share price lately?

171
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:51,118
Does that mean he won't be able
to contribute to tombola?

172
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:55,128
Hardly Kenny's fault if someone
put the word out on him.

173
00:15:55,196 --> 00:15:58,324
Wish I'd know that's all it took.
I'd have done it sooner.

174
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,768
<i>I expect he'll land on his feet.
Give him a life peerage.</i>

175
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:07,934
<i>Henceforth you shall be known as
Lord fucking Curtiss of fucking Kenya.</i>

176
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:29,489
Whoever you are, I don't
take kindly to being blackmailed.

177
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:38,229
<i>Christ. How did you get here?</i>

178
00:16:38,306 --> 00:16:41,571
Safari tour. Via Paris.

179
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:43,906
Hunting me now, Justin?

180
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:47,311
You're the one on the run.

181
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,209
I loved her.
I'm not ashamed of it.

182
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:56,484
Nor should you be...
if it were true.

183
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:59,791
It's not for you to tell me
how I felt.

184
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:05,260
If you've read that, you'll see
that I let her read something
she shouldn't.

185
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,267
Yeah. A letter from Pellegrin.

186
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:11,096
She trusted you.

187
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:13,163
What do you want for that?

188
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,576
I want to know why Pellegrin
suppressed Tessa's report.

189
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:22,241
It was him, wasn't it?
Don't try and play detective.

190
00:17:22,316 --> 00:17:26,116
ThreeBees, KDH, Dypraxa.
What's the story on that axis of evil?

191
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:30,521
KDH is Swiss-Canadian.
So why are we involved?

192
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,355
Curtiss is one of us.
He's British.

193
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,794
Christ, Justin, stop bleeding
for bloody Africa
and show some loyalty.

194
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:40,265
That plant KDH built in Wales
could have gone to France.

195
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:42,734
Fifteen hundred jobs
in a depressed region.

196
00:17:42,803 --> 00:17:45,101
We owed them.

197
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,635
They needed help
with the Dypraxa trials.

198
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:53,908
KDH needed
an investment partner here.

199
00:17:53,981 --> 00:17:57,542
<i>Curtiss and ThreeBees
served us both.</i>

200
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,212
And Tessa wanted what?

201
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,090
Pressure on Kenny...

202
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:11,264
to stop the tests,
redesign the bloody drug.

203
00:18:14,368 --> 00:18:16,928
Three years' delay,
millions of dollars.

204
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,867
Or?

205
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:24,638
<i>We're not paid
to be bleeding hearts.</i>

206
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,646
<i>You know that, Justin.</i>

207
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,284
<i>We're not killing people
who wouldn't be dead otherwise.</i>

208
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:36,353
<i>Look at the death rate.
Not that anybody's counting.</i>

209
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:40,292
But you were
a bleeding heart, Sandy.

210
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:44,991
<i>Tessa was your salvation,
wasn't she, from all this?</i>

211
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:48,800
You loved her. Remember?

212
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:53,874
<i>Pellegrin said the report
was too damaging...</i>

213
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:56,034
<i>and she had to be stopped.</i>

214
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:00,604
Oh, yes. She was stopped.

215
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:05,518
I betrayed her.

216
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:09,055
We all did.

217
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,320
You did it by... growing flowers.

218
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:23,065
How did you betray her, Sandy?

219
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:29,803
They wanted to know
what she was up to.

220
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:33,506
I'm the one who told them
she was going to Loki.

221
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:39,417
- Who did you tell?
- Pellegrin.

222
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:44,518
But God knows who he told.

223
00:20:18,492 --> 00:20:21,689
Ghita, get in the car.
Get in the car!

224
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:26,529
Go!

225
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:40,113
Get in.

226
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:44,083
Listen, fuckhead,
if I wanted you dead,

227
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:46,085
I would've brought Crick with me.

228
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:50,056
I wanna show you something.

229
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:53,059
Show me from there.

230
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:56,756
Don't mess me about.
I'm doing you a favor.

231
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,639
<i>How did you know where I'd be?</i>

232
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:16,876
<i>I've still got a friend or two, you know?</i>

233
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:23,215
<i>We're marked men, Quayle.
They've called in my fucking bank loans.</i>

234
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,987
<i>I'm finished.
They want you silenced.</i>

235
00:21:27,061 --> 00:21:31,464
<i>And they want another country's flag
flying over my pharma division.</i>

236
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:38,198
So, you've been asking
about Wanza Kilulu.

237
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:45,501
She's under there,
covered in quicklime.

238
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:48,548
<i>Her and 62 others
who never officially existed.</i>

239
00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:50,550
Dypraxa?

240
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:55,421
Yeah.

241
00:21:57,091 --> 00:22:00,549
Is that where I'm going?
Not on my agenda.

242
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:06,597
Then why are you
showing me this?

243
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:12,304
Let's just say
if I'm going to the wall,
I want a trophy.

244
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:16,469
That's what you lot do,
isn't it? Heads on walls.

245
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,506
I think I'll have Pellegrin's
fucking head on mine.

246
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,746
So, now you know where it is.
I'm not taking any fucking questions.

247
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:31,018
<i>What about Lorbeer?</i>

248
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:35,391
That Bible-thumping bullshitter,
he's doing his penance in the Sudan.

249
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:37,828
Jesus the healer.

250
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:54,169
<i>You don't know where I'm going?
You get one guess.</i>

251
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,916
I'm gonna surprise you, Tess.

252
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:02,581
- I love this man.
- Hello.

253
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:17,069
<i>I wish you had shared
just a few things.</i>

254
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,877
I love you.
I love you too.

255
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:47,586
Who did you think it was?

256
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:51,222
Fuck you, Donohue.
This is bandit country.

257
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:57,997
Did you tell Curtiss where I'd be?

258
00:24:58,072 --> 00:25:00,006
Ghita's car?

259
00:25:00,074 --> 00:25:03,339
Well, Ghita's
my only friend here, Tim.

260
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,878
I wouldn't want her
to get into trouble.
She won't.

261
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:11,640
You do have another friend,
believe it or not.

262
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,653
You won't find what
you're looking for in Loki.

263
00:25:16,156 --> 00:25:18,181
Let's be honest
with each other, shall we?

264
00:25:18,258 --> 00:25:21,193
That's a- a late career change
for you, Tim.

265
00:25:22,463 --> 00:25:26,092
There's something else
we have in common, you and I.

266
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:29,294
We'll both be dead by Christmas.

267
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:32,099
There's a contract out on you.

268
00:25:32,172 --> 00:25:34,732
Same people who did for Tessa,
I shouldn't wonder.

269
00:25:34,808 --> 00:25:36,742
Mine's cancer.

270
00:25:38,846 --> 00:25:41,246
My pain is controllable.

271
00:25:41,315 --> 00:25:45,513
I knew that you were ill.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

272
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:49,113
Yeah. Sandy tell you?

273
00:25:49,189 --> 00:25:51,123
He fingered Tessa.

274
00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:53,352
He said he'd made a phone call.

275
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:57,761
He didn't know they'd kill her.
Silly sod was besotted with her.

276
00:25:57,831 --> 00:26:00,925
But that's the way it works
with corporate murder.

277
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:03,936
<i>Boss gets wind of something,
calls in his head of security,</i>

278
00:26:04,004 --> 00:26:08,373
<i>who talks to someone,
who talks to a friend of someone.</i>

279
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:11,343
<i>Finishes up with an answering machine
in a rented office,</i>

280
00:26:11,411 --> 00:26:14,175
<i>a couple of sensitive gentlemen
in a blue pickup truck.</i>

281
00:26:14,248 --> 00:26:16,648
<i>They will never know
who ordered the hit.</i>

282
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,554
I can get you out of Kenya.

283
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,591
It's one of the few things
we still do well.

284
00:26:24,658 --> 00:26:26,819
Drop it now, and it's over.

285
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:29,260
I'll make sure word
gets to the right people.

286
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:33,459
Go home... and live.

287
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:36,094
But I don't have a home, Tim.

288
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,138
Tessa was my home.

289
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:43,900
Know about Bluhm?

290
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,911
What about Bluhm?

291
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,447
Let me tell you
what you're facing.

292
00:26:50,284 --> 00:26:53,879
They dragged him into the desert,
cut out his tongue,

293
00:26:53,954 --> 00:26:57,651
<i>chopped offhis manly apparatus
and stuffed them where his tongue had been.</i>

294
00:26:57,724 --> 00:26:59,817
<i>Then they crucified the poor bugger.</i>

295
00:26:59,893 --> 00:27:04,091
<i>Pathologist's opinion is
he was still alive when they nailed him up.</i>

296
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,189
<i>Of course, you might be lucky.</i>

297
00:27:06,266 --> 00:27:09,292
<i>It might be in their interest
to make yours look like suicide.</i>

298
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:11,303
Which it is.

299
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:15,808
Balance of mind disturbed.
No fuss, no inquiry.

300
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:18,242
Nothing.
Right.

301
00:27:18,312 --> 00:27:21,076
Well, thank you for the warning.

302
00:27:21,148 --> 00:27:23,343
You've been very kind.

303
00:27:26,153 --> 00:27:28,451
I was afraid you'd say that.

304
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,286
In case you meet any bandits.

305
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:41,219
I, uh- I wondered
if you could help me.
Yes, sir?

306
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:55,201
Thank you for agreeing
to take me, Mr.

307
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,244
Please. I can't hear you.
Please put these on.

308
00:28:58,312 --> 00:29:02,112
I said thank you
for taking me, Mr. Andika.

309
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:05,447
Jonah. No formalities up here.

310
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,920
<i>Do you know about
Southern Sudan, Mr. Black?</i>

311
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:11,514
<i>The place we're going to
is a food camp,</i>

312
00:29:11,591 --> 00:29:14,287
<i>but on the way we must drop
to some villages.</i>

313
00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:17,797
<i>We'rejust about to do a live run.
Take a look.</i>

314
00:29:27,574 --> 00:29:30,634
<i>His name is Brandt,
this man you want to see.</i>

315
00:29:30,711 --> 00:29:33,077
<i>He works at the clinic up there.</i>

316
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,081
<i>He's a good man,
but he pushes God with the pills.</i>

317
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,117
<i>Don't get him started.</i>

318
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:50,353
<i>Better strap yourself in.
We're landing on the surface of the moon.</i>

319
00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:18,984

320
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:27,825
¶¶

321
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:37,143
Hi. Uh, Robert Black,
freelance journalist.

322
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,144
I'm looking for Dr. Brandt.

323
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,874
Dr. Brandt? Yeah, he's just here.
He's traveling over from the village.
Thank you.

324
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:53,483
- Dr. Brandt?
- I'll see you over by the tent.

325
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,715
<i>My name is Robert Black.
I'm a freelancejournalist.
Uh-huh.</i>

326
00:31:19,786 --> 00:31:22,983
I'm told that you're the man to talk to.
I don't know
about that, Mr. Black.

327
00:31:23,056 --> 00:31:25,490
But I can tell you what's
happening around here, yeah?
Good.

328
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,550
Meet my self-appointed
assistant, Abuk.

329
00:31:27,627 --> 00:31:29,788
Abuk.
Hello. How are you?

330
00:31:29,863 --> 00:31:32,195
Hello. How are you?
I'm very well.

331
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,325
Follow me. Come this way.

332
00:31:35,402 --> 00:31:39,702
Youse need to go
all to the medical center,
quickly as possible.

333
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:43,869
<i>¶¶</i>

334
00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:48,474
<i>I only give the food
to the women, Mr. Black.</i>

335
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:52,245
<i>The women make the homes.
The men make the wars... and hooch.</i>

336
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:55,618
Adam was God's first draft.
He got it right with Eve.

337
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:57,816
You tell that
to your readers, Mr. Black.

338
00:31:57,891 --> 00:32:00,257
It's a philosophy
that I learned from my wife.

339
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:04,593
Cherish her, man. Cherish her.
One of God's finest creations.

340
00:32:04,664 --> 00:32:07,326
Now I'll show you
what the devil's up to.

341
00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:11,265
<i>¶¶</i>

342
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,803
¶¶

343
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,979
Our treatment center.
Pretty crude, isn't it?

344
00:32:27,053 --> 00:32:29,647
Well, I've seen hospitals
little better. In Nairobi.

345
00:32:29,723 --> 00:32:34,751
So have I. Gharan, what surprises
have they got in store for us this month?

346
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:39,265
<i>Have you checked those things?
Ja? Should be 40 boxes.</i>

347
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:44,325
<i>Free medicines, Mr. Black.</i>

348
00:32:44,404 --> 00:32:46,770
Most of them well beyond
their sell-by date.

349
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,367
<i>The drug companies donate them.
It's a tax break for them.</i>

350
00:32:50,443 --> 00:32:52,877
Disposable drugs
for disposable patients.

351
00:32:52,946 --> 00:32:56,643
Out here they have
absolutely no shelf life.

352
00:32:56,716 --> 00:33:00,049
Safest thing to do
is incinerate them.

353
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,490
Big pharmaceuticals are right up there
with the arms dealers.

354
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:12,455
This is how the world
fucks Africa, Mr. Black.

355
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,990
Blood on their hands?
It's how they expiate their guilt.

356
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:19,527
Pharmaceuticals,
the aid agencies, everybody.

357
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:23,042
This whole machine
is driven by guilt.

358
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:25,339
Is it?

359
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:28,176
And now you will sample
my goat stew. Come with me.

360
00:33:33,253 --> 00:33:35,414
<i>So tell me, Robert,</i>

361
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,116
<i>do you believe an individual
can redeem himselfby good acts?</i>

362
00:33:38,191 --> 00:33:40,125
Abuk.

363
00:33:40,193 --> 00:33:42,855
<i>I do, yes.</i>

364
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:45,659
Maybe the redemption
is in the struggle, huh?

365
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,758
God has your head.
The devil has your balls.

366
00:33:48,835 --> 00:33:51,167
So which particular devil had yours?

367
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,603
Oh, you don't want to know
about that, Robert.

368
00:33:53,673 --> 00:33:55,868
What's your paper
really interested in?

369
00:33:55,942 --> 00:33:58,740
In the big
pharmaceutical companies.

370
00:33:58,812 --> 00:34:02,509
African guinea pigs.
Cheap trials for unsound drugs.

371
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,449
Uninformed consent extorted
with threats against children.
Who are you?

372
00:34:05,518 --> 00:34:07,452
Christ!
Payoffs, cover-ups.

373
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,954
You were in Nairobi.
At the hospital.
Unmarked graves.

374
00:34:10,023 --> 00:34:12,457
I knew I'd seen you
somewhere before.
Murder.

375
00:34:12,525 --> 00:34:15,460
You're the husband.
That's right, Dr. Lorbeer.

376
00:34:15,528 --> 00:34:19,089
<i>Markus! Markus!</i>

377
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:32,474
Something's going on out there.
Why did my wife come here?

378
00:34:32,545 --> 00:34:35,343
She-They had written this report.

379
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:38,316
Sixteen pages of inspired guesswork.

380
00:34:38,385 --> 00:34:40,717
I was supposed to provide
the missing clinical data.

381
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,654
Testify on tape.
And did you?

382
00:34:43,723 --> 00:34:45,247
This could be a raid.

383
00:34:54,868 --> 00:34:58,269
<i>Tribesman. Nasty.
They steal cattle, food, children.</i>

384
00:34:58,338 --> 00:35:01,899
- I think maybe we should leave.
- Did you testify on tape?

385
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,842
She was a very persuasive woman,
your wife, Mr. Quayle.

386
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:07,175
And, no, I do not have the tape.
They took the tape.

387
00:35:07,247 --> 00:35:12,116
But you kept a copy
of the report, yes?
Yes, I did. You're welcome to it.

388
00:35:14,554 --> 00:35:17,785
Level four alert!
They're leaving in five minutes.

389
00:35:17,857 --> 00:35:22,294
<i>If you don't want to die, my friend,
you'd better come with me to the airstrip.</i>

390
00:35:22,362 --> 00:35:23,795
<i>Hurry.</i>

391
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:39,209
- We can still make it.
- What were Tessa and Bluhm
doing at Lake Turkana?

392
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:41,839
Are you crazy?
We've got to get out of here, man.

393
00:35:41,915 --> 00:35:44,213
I mean, these people,
they kill anybody. Sorry.

394
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:46,878
Have you lost your senses?

395
00:35:46,953 --> 00:35:49,478
- There was something else!
There was a letter!

396
00:35:49,556 --> 00:35:52,320
Look, you're a lunatic.
Do you know what you're doing?

397
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:54,952
You're killing us both.
We'll take our chances with them.

398
00:37:26,686 --> 00:37:28,813
No!

399
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,925
Get down!

400
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,054
Abuk!

401
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:52,637
<i>Abuk! You okay?
Come with us, quick. Run.</i>

402
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,229
<i>Run.</i>

403
00:38:55,575 --> 00:38:57,509
Wait. Wait!

404
00:39:05,451 --> 00:39:08,511
Be careful!
Abuk, be careful!

405
00:39:08,588 --> 00:39:10,749
Here!

406
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:18,463
Hurry on up!
Where have you guys been?

407
00:39:18,531 --> 00:39:20,692
Sorry about that, Jonah.

408
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:25,033
<i>- I'm sorry. I can't take the girl.
- I'm not leaving her.</i>

409
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:28,130
<i>- We're only allowed to evacuate aid workers.
- Well, to hell with what's allowed.</i>

410
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:31,438
I'll- How much do you want for her?

411
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:35,038
- Look, there's $800.
- Don't embarrass me.

412
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:38,049
You can't buy this. The rules
are made for good reason, please.

413
00:39:38,117 --> 00:39:40,881
This is a child's life!
There are no rules to cover that!

414
00:39:40,954 --> 00:39:43,286
Look, there are thousands
of them out there.

415
00:39:43,356 --> 00:39:45,688
<i>I can't make an exception
for this one child.</i>

416
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:49,694
Yes, but this is one we can help! Here.

417
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:54,358
<i>Abuk! Abuk! Abuk!</i>

418
00:39:56,569 --> 00:40:00,266
<i>Listen, that's the way it is here.</i>

419
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,706
<i>Keep your money.
Strap yourself in, and let's go.</i>

420
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,250
<i>¶¶</i>

421
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:19,087
<i>What- What'll happen to her?</i>

422
00:40:19,158 --> 00:40:22,821
<i>She might make it to a refugee camp...
if she's lucky.</i>

423
00:40:24,664 --> 00:40:27,963
<i>¶¶</i>

424
00:40:51,858 --> 00:40:54,088
This is what you came for,
I believe.

425
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:11,769
Your wife would have made that tape public,
Mr. Quayle, with my voice on it.

426
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,039
That letter was my insurance policy.

427
00:41:14,113 --> 00:41:17,446
But how did they know
where to find her?

428
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:21,977
They were on their way to Marsabit,
taking the whole rotten package
to Grace Makanga.

429
00:41:22,055 --> 00:41:24,046
Makanga would have put it
in front of the U.N.

430
00:41:24,123 --> 00:41:27,650
But someone knew exactly
where Tessa and Arnold would be.

431
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,664
That was me.

432
00:41:32,732 --> 00:41:35,326
I radioed Nairobi.

433
00:41:35,401 --> 00:41:38,564
KDH security man name of Crick.
God, Christ, man.

434
00:41:38,638 --> 00:41:41,607
I didn't know they
were gonna be murdered.

435
00:41:41,674 --> 00:41:44,074
<i>My oath to God.</i>

436
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,139
Crick's going to know
that you were up here.

437
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,082
<i>Going to be very interested
to know where you're headed.</i>

438
00:41:52,151 --> 00:41:54,813
What do I tell him?

439
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,687
He'll know.

440
00:41:58,758 --> 00:42:01,556
He's been there before.

441
00:42:03,096 --> 00:42:05,030
<i>Mr. A ndika?
Yeah?</i>

442
00:42:05,098 --> 00:42:08,932
<i>I'd like to apologize
if I embarrassed you earlier.</i>

443
00:42:09,001 --> 00:42:11,196
It's all right.

444
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:15,934
Do you think that it would be possible
to land the plane here?

445
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:19,808
<i>Lake Turkana? It's possible,
but you don't wanna go there.</i>

446
00:42:19,879 --> 00:42:22,109
It's-There's nothing there
but crocodiles.

447
00:42:22,181 --> 00:42:24,445
Let me take you back to Loki.

448
00:42:24,517 --> 00:42:26,747
Well, l- I wouldn't be alone for long.

449
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:30,220
Please. I'd be, um- I'd be grateful.

450
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,222
I have one more favor
to ask you, I'm sorry.

451
00:42:34,293 --> 00:42:37,126
Do you think you could post
that envelope for me?
It's quite urgent.

452
00:42:37,196 --> 00:42:38,891
Ah, Rome.

453
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:09,815
<i>If we have lost in Justin and Tessa...</i>

454
00:44:09,889 --> 00:44:12,414
<i>two valued friends,</i>

455
00:44:12,491 --> 00:44:17,827
<i>the diplomatic community
has lost a true gentleman-</i>

456
00:44:17,897 --> 00:44:20,889
<i>courteous, self-effacing,</i>

<i>large ofheart.</i>

458
00:44:25,638 --> 00:44:30,871
<i>That he chose to take his own life
in the same remote spot...</i>

459
00:44:30,943 --> 00:44:34,572
<i>where Tessa met her tragic death...</i>

460
00:44:34,647 --> 00:44:38,777
<i>is a sad reflection
ofhis tormented state of mind...</i>

461
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:42,719
<i>but also typical ofhis discretion.</i>

462
00:44:44,423 --> 00:44:48,120
<i>He would not have had us troubled.</i>

463
00:44:48,194 --> 00:44:52,654
<i>He would not have had us inconvenienced.</i>

464
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:56,862
<i>Nothing in his life became him...</i>

465
00:44:56,936 --> 00:44:59,461
<i>like the leaving it.</i>

466
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:15,153
I have, uh, chosen a text I know
Justin and Tessa would approve.

467
00:45:15,221 --> 00:45:18,884
It's an epistle.
Noncanonical.

468
00:45:22,194 --> 00:45:27,393
"My Dear Sandy:
Your naiveté is beyond belief.

469
00:45:27,466 --> 00:45:31,334
"Knowing our arrangements
with KDH and ThreeBees,

470
00:45:31,404 --> 00:45:33,736
"you send me
this half-baked report...

471
00:45:33,806 --> 00:45:37,037
"by some bleeding heart
diplomatic wife and her black lover...

472
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,441
<i>"and ask me to take action.</i>

473
00:45:39,512 --> 00:45:43,676
"The only action required,
apart from shredding the thing,

474
00:45:43,749 --> 00:45:47,446
<i>"is to keep a tighter rein
on your resident harlot.</i>

475
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,822
<i>"I want to know what she does,
where she goes, whom she meets.</i>

476
00:45:52,892 --> 00:45:56,123
<i>"The issue here is deniability.</i>

477
00:45:56,195 --> 00:45:59,358
<i>"If nobody told us
Dypraxa was causing deaths,</i>

478
00:45:59,432 --> 00:46:01,730
"we can't be held responsible.

479
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:05,134
"But, my dear Sandy,
should it ever become known...

480
00:46:05,204 --> 00:46:07,365
<i>"that we've closed our eyes to the deaths,</i>

481
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,341
<i>"none of us would survive the scandal.</i>

482
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:13,344
<i>"I still have great hopes of you.
My love to Gloria.</i>

483
00:46:13,412 --> 00:46:16,643
<i>Yours Sincerely, Bernard."</i>

484
00:46:16,716 --> 00:46:20,982
<i>This way, sir.
What do you have to say, sir?</i>

485
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,859
It was a bizarre sort of suicide.

486
00:46:32,264 --> 00:46:36,291
His body bore no fewer
than eight bullet wounds...

487
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:38,303
from three different guns,

488
00:46:38,371 --> 00:46:41,272
none of which was the one
found in his hand.

489
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,308
So who has got away with murder?

490
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:47,813
Not, of course, the British government.

491
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,408
<i>They merely covered up,
as one does, the offensive corpses.</i>

492
00:46:52,485 --> 00:46:57,582
<i>Though not literally. That was done
by person or persons unknown.</i>

493
00:46:59,225 --> 00:47:02,388
<i>So who has committed murder?</i>

494
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:07,524
<i>Not, of course, the highly respectable firm
of KDH Pharmaceutical,</i>

495
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,536
<i>which has enjoyed
record profits this quarter...</i>

496
00:47:11,604 --> 00:47:14,869
<i>and has now licensed ZimbaMed of Harare...</i>

497
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,933
<i>to continue testing Dypraxa in Africa.</i>

498
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:23,740
<i>No, there are no murders in Africa.</i>

499
00:47:23,816 --> 00:47:26,546
<i>Only regrettable deaths.</i>

500
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:31,750
<i>And from those deaths
we derive the benefits of civilization,</i>

501
00:47:31,824 --> 00:47:34,987
benefits we can afford so easily...

502
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,791
because those lives
were bought so cheaply.

503
00:48:10,229 --> 00:48:13,323
I know all your secrets, Tess.

504
00:48:16,168 --> 00:48:18,728
I think I understand you now.

505
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:56,731
<i>You want me to come home.</i>

506
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:04,381
But I am home.

507
00:49:32,444 --> 00:49:34,503
<i>Mr. Quayle.</i>

508
00:49:43,122 --> 00:49:44,919
Tess.
