1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,896
Mike, can you please
let these single people

2
00:00:00,973 --> 00:00:04,636
- have a private moment?
- I agree.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,838
Maybe after dinner you two
could go for a ride or something?

4
00:00:07,913 --> 00:00:11,110
Oh, that sounds great.
So nice.

5
00:00:11,183 --> 00:00:13,083
That sounds nice.

6
00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:15,620
Fun.

7
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:17,713
Trina ain't going
nowhere with him.

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,155
- Why not?
- Yeah, Mike.

9
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:23,752
Why can't this single woman go out
with this single man?

10
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:25,820
Can we just drop this, please?

11
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:28,332
I'm so agreeing with
Dianne right now.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,994
- Let him answer.
- Marcus, get your wife.

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,503
Come on, baby.
Give me that drink.

14
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:36,007
No. As matter of fact,
let me get another drink.

15
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:38,475
So Mike can tell us why
Trina can't go with Troy.

16
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:40,375
Angela...

17
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:43,244
really. It's no big deal.

18
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:47,240
OK. Let's do it.

19
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:48,339
- Come on.
- Mike.

20
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:49,714
- No, no. Come on. Talk to me.
- Calm down.

21
00:00:49,785 --> 00:00:51,013
- Eat your food, OK?
- No, no.

22
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:53,316
No. Let him talk.
Let him talk, Shelia.

23
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:54,980
She's just a little drunk.

24
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:56,081
Yeah. You know what, Marcus?

25
00:00:56,158 --> 00:00:57,625
I may be a little drunk
but somebody

26
00:00:57,693 --> 00:00:59,991
at this table got
some damn secrets.

27
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:01,086
- Really?
- That's enough.

28
00:01:01,163 --> 00:01:04,326
No, no, no. Dianne...
somebody got some secrets.

29
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:05,627
What are they?

30
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:07,601
You know, I'm so sick
of this. I'm sick of it.

31
00:01:07,669 --> 00:01:10,035
The reason she can't go
with this man or any other man

32
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:13,370
is because she's sleeping
with yours, Shelia.

33
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:16,773
What?

34
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:21,249
No.

35
00:01:22,284 --> 00:01:23,717
Yeah, Shelia.

36
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:32,822
Oh, hell.

37
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:40,360
Well, y'all,
thanks for dinner.

38
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,198
But I should be going.

39
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,900
I think you need to stay, man. We're gonna
need some law enforcement around here.

40
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:49,409
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:54,881
Is it true?

42
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:59,516
Yeah.

43
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:02,284
Yeah, it's true.

44
00:02:02,357 --> 00:02:06,350
That's my secret. I'm the bad guy.

45
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:10,489
I'm not the only married person
with a secret at this table.

46
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,499
Terry...

47
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:15,365
have you told your wife how you got
a DNA test on your daughter,

48
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:17,405
'cause you weren't sure
that she was yours?

49
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,770
Mike, don't go telling secrets, man.

50
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:21,832
Oh, no, no. Come on, Marcus.

51
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,775
Y'all talking about me. Hmm?

52
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:25,335
You put my secret out there.

53
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:28,473
Let's put everybody's secret
on the table, shall we?

54
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,644
Dianne, have you told
your husband that

55
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,211
you got your tubes tied after you
had Kenya and didn't tell him?

56
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:36,757
Hmm? That's what Shelia told me.

57
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:38,793
I'm sorry, Terry,
but your chances of having a boy?

58
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,954
- A little slim to none.
- Mike, wait. This has gone too far.

59
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,225
You are getting really dangerous now.
You need to stop this.

60
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:46,893
Gavin. Since you guys are walking
around here like the perfect couple.

61
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:51,428
Will you please inform your wife
how you came crying at my house

62
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:53,736
asking, "How could she be so stupid

63
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:57,267
"and not strap your son
in his car seat?" Hmm?

64
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:00,075
- What about that?
- You are a lowdown, dirty bastard...

65
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:01,342
- Shut up!
- No. You shut up!

66
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,249
- Marcus, please. Please.
- Oh, hell.

67
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,581
Please tell this woman the truth.

68
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:07,315
And I pray that it sets you free.
I pray, brother.

69
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:09,220
But I'm telling you, tell this woman

70
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,658
how Terry had to give you
a shot because you had VD.

71
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,855
Let's talk about condoms
now, shall we, Angela?

72
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,097
Oh, so you got VD?

73
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:21,260
Checkmate.

74
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:24,134
- Who you been with?
- Angela, let's discuss this in private.

75
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:25,104
No. You know what?

76
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:28,267
It seems like you guys
have been talking in private enough.

77
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:31,141
How long have you had it?

78
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:32,874
A week.

79
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:35,041
Was it Keisha?

80
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:39,614
No. You didn't get it from her.

81
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:42,452
You got it from Walter.

82
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:44,389
What are you talking about?
I ain't gay.

83
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,757
No. I slept with him.

84
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:47,988
I got a shot.

85
00:03:48,063 --> 00:03:49,928
I was just waiting
for you to say something.

86
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:52,626
Boom!

87
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:55,033
Yeah.

88
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:57,833
Mm-hmm.

89
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,464
Don't!

90
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,032
I hope he breaks
your throat. Touchdown!

91
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,010
Get off of me!

92
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,172
- Man, come on, man. Come on!
- Don't be putting your hands on me!

93
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:07,806
Arrest him!

94
00:04:07,883 --> 00:04:09,111
Get him. You see he
trying to kill me.

95
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:10,116
- Let me go.
- Arrest him, Troy!

96
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:11,846
That's why I slept with her!

97
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,148
You so damn evil!

98
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:16,213
You know what? You put your hands on
the wrong one, Marcus.

99
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,521
- I'm out of here.
- Get out of here.

100
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,584
Now, that's the best idea I heard
since we got up here.

101
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:23,495
Let's cut this trip short.
Baby, go pack our stuff.

102
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:25,396
We outta here.

103
00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:29,736
Look, I'm sorry
you had to hear this way.

104
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:33,001
Thank your friend over there.

105
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:35,008
It's over.

106
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:38,739
I'll be more than fair,
but I want a divorce.

107
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:42,271
Hey, you can have
the rental property.

108
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,215
I'll have Paco put
bars on there for you,

109
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:45,947
so don't thank me or nothing.

110
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:48,455
It's a rough neighborhood.

111
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:49,785
You can have your car.

112
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:52,827
And I'll figure everything else out.

113
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:57,791
Huh?

114
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:02,496
Whatever.

115
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:08,708
Oh, my God.

116
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,572
Oh, I hope he's dead.

117
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:22,152
I'll get my medical bag.

118
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:28,788
# Oh, oh #

119
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:37,568
# Mmm... #

120
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:43,840
# Oh #

121
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:51,512
# Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh #

122
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,384
# Yeah #

123
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:02,922
# Givin' up #

124
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:09,369
# It's hard to do #

125
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:20,944
# When you really #

126
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:24,713
# Love someone #

127
00:06:27,255 --> 00:06:30,122
# Givin' up... #

128
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:37,491
Shelia, you know you had the key
in the door.

129
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:40,693
You came to arrest me?

130
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:42,600
Actually, I saw
your car out front.

131
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,501
And I just came
to check on you.

132
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,877
Did I kill him?

133
00:06:49,944 --> 00:06:52,469
No. You didn't kill him, but, uh...

134
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:55,539
Heh. He's gonna have
one hell of a headache.

135
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:59,444
I should have killed him.

136
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:03,283
Shelia, you don't mean that.

137
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,521
Maybe you do.

138
00:07:09,464 --> 00:07:11,694
I gave him my life.

139
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:15,827
You know, he emptied out
my bank account?

140
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:20,273
I have $87 to my name.

141
00:07:21,843 --> 00:07:23,777
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

142
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:29,244
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

143
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:32,915
Well, if you've got a minute,
I'd like to show you something.

144
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:38,816
Hey, guys, I'm really
sorry about everything, OK?

145
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:41,123
I love you.

146
00:07:41,196 --> 00:07:44,290
I'll call you later.
Bye, baby.

147
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:46,765
If anyone hears from Shelia,
we'll let each other know, right?

148
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:48,769
- Yes.
- Bye, guys.

149
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:08,312
All right, daddy.

150
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:14,125
Give that man what he wants.

151
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:15,856
Have a safe drive.

152
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:26,671
Are we gonna talk about this?

153
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:30,309
Gavin, please.

154
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:32,278
Not right now.

155
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,616
Oh, you're not gonna...?

156
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:44,953
I'll do it.

157
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,770
What?

158
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:01,374
You wasn't even
gonna tell me, were you?

159
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,937
Why did you test our daughter?

160
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:10,746
Because you are so damn busy

161
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:14,345
that when you got pregnant,
we had sex what... once?

162
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:20,722
Well, what were the results?

163
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:24,462
What do you mean?
She's mine.

164
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:26,796
Really?

165
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:28,165
Huh.

166
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:32,204
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

167
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:34,241
What the hell
you saying, Dianne?

168
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:45,685
Yeah, OK.

169
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:47,653
OK.

170
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:05,503
It's snowing a little bit...

171
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:07,268
but this is where
I come to clear my head.

172
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:11,870
I just come right here.
I pray. I scream. I yell.

173
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:14,972
Do whatever I need to do.

174
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:17,882
And it's just me and God.

175
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:20,420
You ever come here to cry?

176
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:22,786
Yeah. That, too.

177
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:35,566
I can't even...

178
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:38,504
describe to you the pain I feel.

179
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:40,905
It's like I've been hit by a car.

180
00:10:43,845 --> 00:10:46,143
I keep trying to understand.

181
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:52,981
Why I'm... what did I do... so wrong?

182
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:56,320
Why he betrayed me?

183
00:10:57,692 --> 00:10:59,683
It hurts.

184
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:08,225
I have no life without him.

185
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:13,466
I can't even pray about it.

186
00:11:16,377 --> 00:11:18,709
You know, Shelia,

187
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,941
this is a great time
for a new start

188
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,778
if you want to stay.

189
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:57,580
Oh. I thought you were
still at work.

190
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:01,387
I took the day off.

191
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:06,219
I'm gonna get dinner started.

192
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:11,021
We need to talk, Patricia.

193
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:13,090
I don't think so.

194
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,965
I know you heard what Michael said
at the table.

195
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:22,165
So you're not gonna deal with it?

196
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:25,574
Look, Gavin, I have dealt with this, OK?

197
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,079
This is what I do for a living.

198
00:12:27,148 --> 00:12:29,048
I'm a doctor. I've dealt with this.

199
00:12:29,117 --> 00:12:30,948
Yeah, well, you haven't
talked to me about it.

200
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,542
So now you want to talk to me
the way you did Mike?

201
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,350
Now you want to cry
your eyes out to me?

202
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:37,220
It's not like you made
it easy for me to discuss this.

203
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,192
Yeah, we talk about...

204
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:43,389
Noah like has never here.

205
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:47,863
Can you look at his picture?

206
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,301
Patricia, please.
Please put...

207
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:52,635
Can you just look at his picture?

208
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,807
Gavin, I didn't know...

209
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:02,782
- I didn't know you blamed me for it.
- I...

210
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,182
OK. I blamed you.

211
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:07,187
I blamed... I'm sorry.

212
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:09,450
OK? I blame myself, too.

213
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:12,220
I blamed God, but...

214
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:15,456
It's no one's fault.
Baby, just look at the picture.

215
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:19,392
All right.

216
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,394
Steak or chicken?

217
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,959
Patricia, no!
Look at the picture!

218
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:24,504
No! You know what?
Stop it!

219
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:25,766
- Patricia, look at...
- Stop it!

220
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,273
- Patricia, Patricia...
- Gavin, just stop it!

221
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:28,603
Patricia, just look at the picture.

222
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:29,665
Stop with your pretending.

223
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:31,268
- I'm not...
- Stop. Would you...

224
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:32,312
you pretend that you love me.

225
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,371
Stop with all those lies!

226
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:35,973
- I can't take this.
- Patricia.

227
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,610
You know you hate me.
I hate myself for this!

228
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:39,948
- I don't hate you. Baby.
- This is my fault!

229
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:41,579
- No. Don't touch me!
- Baby.

230
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:43,089
- Don't touch me.
- OK. Well...

231
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:45,387
No. Will you just listen
to me for once, please?

232
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,087
- It's not your fault.
- This is my fault.

233
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:49,925
I walk around here
trying to act like "perfect Patty. "

234
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,988
You know, well,
perfect Patty messed up.

235
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:53,260
- OK?
- No one's asking you...

236
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,802
No. Will you just listen...
Listen for a minute!

237
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,497
- I'm not...
- Listen!

238
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,238
Perfect Patty messed up.

239
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:09,446
I was in a hurry.

240
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,644
And...

241
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:15,246
I strapped him in.
I strapped him in.

242
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:20,287
But I didn't secure it.
I didn't check.

243
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:23,455
Check to see
if it was secure. And...

244
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:27,831
It was raining. And...

245
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:31,030
I slid off the road, and now...

246
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:34,866
And now?

247
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:37,240
- Now he's dead.
- I know. I know, baby.

248
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,006
- I know.
- He's not coming back.

249
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,777
You know, Gavin, I can
deal with a lot of things,

250
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,681
but this...

251
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:47,653
I'm not strong enough
to deal with this, baby.

252
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:50,190
Hey, you don't have to be...

253
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:52,226
strong by yourself.

254
00:14:52,293 --> 00:14:54,625
Just let me be.

255
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:59,223
Let me be strong for you, OK?

256
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,894
We can make it through.

257
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:06,401
Baby, I'll be there for you.

258
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:10,169
No matter what.

259
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,109
Please...

260
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,661
I need to see Marcus.

261
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,565
OK.

262
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,034
Hold for one second.

263
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:41,968
What the hell
are you doing here?

264
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:45,035
- I need to see Marcus.
- No. You better get out of this building.

265
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,204
I need to see Marcus.

266
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,975
No. I said you better get out
of this building.

267
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:50,381
Oh, no, you didn't touch me!

268
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,510
I'm gonna pack you out of here!

269
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:53,986
You know who you
messin' with, huh?

270
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:57,081
- What are you doing here?
- Look, I need to talk to you.

271
00:15:57,158 --> 00:15:59,626
About what?

272
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:01,161
Do you mind?

273
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,525
Yes, I mind. Marcus,
you better get her

274
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:04,827
the hell out of here before
I throw her out on her face!

275
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,867
Marcus, you better get that ho!

276
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:09,027
You better check that ho!

277
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:11,503
- You know what?
- Angie, Angie, Angie.

278
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:13,130
Let me take care of this.

279
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,368
Yeah. 'Cause I know
how to handle it!

280
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:17,138
He got a handle.
He can handle all of this.

281
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:18,143
- Get her. Deal with her.
- All this!

282
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:20,578
He handles it. And well!

283
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:23,082
Well, Miss Press n' Curl. Ya ho!

284
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,880
Y'all know I don't take that.
I kick ass up in here every Tuesday.

285
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:28,444
Y'all know who you work for!

286
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,752
You know who you work for!

287
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:32,759
What is it?

288
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:35,887
Yeah. You know what?
She's right here in this office.

289
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:37,055
Angela, talk to her.

290
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:38,860
I think that's
what you should do.

291
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:41,231
I'm not gonna talk to her.
If she says one thing to me,

292
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:42,826
I'm going to jail for murder.

293
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:44,530
Well, I'm a lawyer.
I'll get you off.

294
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:46,334
- Shelia's on line two.
- Oh!

295
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:49,570
Guys, Shelia's on line two.
I'm gonna conference us in, OK?

296
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:52,010
But you know what?
If you got to be that damn tenderheaded,

297
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,706
why don't you get out
of my damn chair?

298
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:57,217
Get out of my chair
looking like next ghetto top weave.

299
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:59,775
- Oh...
- Shelia?

300
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:01,754
Are you OK?
We've been trying to reach you.

301
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:04,655
Yeah. I'm... Mike turned
my cell phone off.

302
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:06,886
Shelia, honey,
do you need some money?

303
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:08,553
Angela, I'm fine.

304
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:11,462
I got a job in a general store.

305
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:13,056
A general store?

306
00:17:13,134 --> 00:17:17,230
Don't ask.
I'll be all right.

307
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,534
Do you need a place to stay?
You can live with us.

308
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:22,303
No, Patricia.
I spent too much time

309
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:23,741
letting other people
take care of me.

310
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:25,802
I've gotta find my own way.

311
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,108
Where are you?

312
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:28,978
Just know I'm fine, Dianne.

313
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,542
I gotta do this on my own.

314
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,781
I'm really proud of you, Shelia.

315
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,884
I'm gonna call you guys soon.

316
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,153
I love you.

317
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,455
We're really sorry this happened.

318
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:44,157
- Shelia, I'm so sorry.
- I'll be all right.

319
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,722
Honey, I love you, OK?

320
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:49,531
- We love you.
- We love you.

321
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:52,128
I love y'all, too.

322
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:57,838
Um, Dianne, tell Terry
I said happy birthday, OK?

323
00:17:57,912 --> 00:18:01,075
Oh, my God!
Is that today?

324
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,139
Dianne, you didn't
forget, did you?

325
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:05,447
- Oh. I have to go.
- OK.

326
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,316
I'll talk to you.

327
00:18:07,388 --> 00:18:08,821
Later.

328
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:12,391
Hey, Sheriff.

329
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,492
Hey.

330
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:22,536
Hey!

331
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,735
Thanks for getting me this job.

332
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,367
Ha! You kidding me?

333
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:35,143
If it wasn't for you,
this place wouldn't even be open again.

334
00:18:35,216 --> 00:18:37,946
My daddy loved this store.

335
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:40,384
It's his lifelong dream, this place.

336
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,723
# Ooh, I want you #

337
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,487
# The right way #
# And I want you #

338
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,391
# I want you #

339
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:51,761
# But I want you to want me, too #

340
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:54,130
# Want me, too #

341
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,931
# Want you to want me #

342
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:58,938
# I want you to love me baby #

343
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:02,965
# Just like I want you... #

344
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,502
Oh.

345
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,912
You work out every day?

346
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:10,917
Not every day.

347
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,953
I should go with you sometime.

348
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:21,155
You know you laugh,
but you might actually enjoy it.

349
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,889
Keeps the stress down.

350
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,563
I couldn't run
from here to that door.

351
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,235
Maybe we can...

352
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:36,401
maybe we can start walking first.

353
00:19:36,477 --> 00:19:38,672
If you want to.

354
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:42,039
No.

355
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:43,811
You know, Shelia,
you've been putting in

356
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:45,613
a lot of time in this place,

357
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,551
you know, getting it
to be open and all.

358
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:49,919
Want to go to
the movies later?

359
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,287
# I want you #

360
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:56,295
# But I want you to want me, too #

361
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,354
# I want you #

362
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:01,128
# To want me, baby #

363
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:02,134
# Just like I want you #

364
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:04,103
Shelia?

365
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:05,638
What did you say?

366
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:06,673
Movies.

367
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,708
Have some fun.

368
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:09,902
Laugh, smile.

369
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:11,672
You want to go?

370
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,139
OK.

371
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:18,276
- # Oh, sugar #
- OK.

372
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:21,378
# To share is precious #

373
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:25,789
# Pure and fair #

374
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,157
# Ooh #

375
00:20:27,228 --> 00:20:28,695
Why the hell
was she at my salon?

376
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:30,059
She had to see me.

377
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,690
About what?

378
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:36,827
Angela, lay off.
I'm getting sick of this.

379
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,132
Oh, then leave.

380
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:40,173
You keep it up,
and that's just what I'm gonna do.

381
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:41,606
Oh, please, Marcus.

382
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:44,007
Please. You ain't going nowhere.

383
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:46,273
You know why
you ain't going nowhere?

384
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:48,338
'Cause... this is my money!

385
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,542
You need this money!

386
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,186
- I'm sick of you.
- Get out!

387
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:56,223
- Get out!
- What are you talking about?

388
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,814
- No, stop! Get...
- First of all...

389
00:20:57,892 --> 00:20:59,689
First of all!

390
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,593
It was my money that
started the damn business.

391
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:04,153
Now, you think I'm with you
for the money?

392
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:05,789
I'm with you because
I love you,

393
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:08,061
but you too damn stupid to see it.

394
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:10,194
I was with you
when you didn't have a dime.

395
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,398
And I've always
been there for you!

396
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:14,566
Not afraid to let you shine.

397
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:16,473
It's a damn shame
when you women are so used to

398
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:19,205
losing you don't realize
when you've won.

399
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,838
Kids, get your stuff.
Your daddy here.

400
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:24,009
I know you did not
bring this trick up into my house.

401
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:25,915
I have told you...!

402
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:28,614
Just shut up! Shut!

403
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:34,889
Now, Keisha...

404
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:37,123
this is my wife.

405
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:38,221
And you are going
to respect her.

406
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:41,735
So don't call our house
or come by my job

407
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:43,565
unless it's got something
to do with the kids.

408
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,367
We're done.

409
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,670
Now, I have to have
a relationship with you

410
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:51,404
because of them, and that is it.

411
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,810
So if it ain't got
nothing to do with the kids,

412
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:55,712
don't you call me!

413
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:58,775
And I'm gonna tell you this one time.

414
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:00,945
You better stop talking
to my kids about her,

415
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:02,613
do you understand me?

416
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,851
Yeah.

417
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:10,062
Wow. It's about time...

418
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,791
Hey! Shut!

419
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,630
Now, both of y'all,

420
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:16,897
better learn to get along
for the sake of these kids.

421
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:19,599
And stop acting like
you're both damn 5 years old!

422
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,477
Daddy.

423
00:22:26,347 --> 00:22:28,110
- Hi, babies.
- Hi, guys.

424
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:29,979
- Hey.
- Hi, honey.

425
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,177
Get in the car.

426
00:22:32,252 --> 00:22:33,879
Hop on in.

427
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:35,512
OK.

428
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:37,250
All right now.

429
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:41,158
Better put your seatbelts on.

430
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:43,890
OK. Now, daddy's gonna
see you guys a little later, OK?

431
00:22:43,964 --> 00:22:45,955
Put your seatbelt on.
Daddy loves you.

432
00:22:48,002 --> 00:22:50,368
Baby. Marcus,
where are you going?

433
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,348
Oh! I am so sorry I'm late.

434
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,081
I just, you know,
I got wrapped up,

435
00:23:41,155 --> 00:23:43,316
and it just slipped my mind.

436
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:48,492
It's all right, love.

437
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:51,497
You remember
what you want to remember.

438
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:53,897
Babe, I really am sorry.

439
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:59,768
OK. I will see you at
the office tomorrow, doc, OK?

440
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,603
OK, Pam.

441
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:03,666
Listen, thanks for
the cake and ice cream.

442
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:04,676
Anytime, Terry.

443
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:05,677
All right, darling.

444
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:07,407
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you, Pam.

445
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:09,142
Ha ha!

446
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,741
Are you two having an affair?

447
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:13,309
I think I better go.

448
00:24:13,387 --> 00:24:15,287
Yeah. You better.

449
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:17,289
And don't come
back to this house.

450
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,489
I'll see you at the office, Pam.

451
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:24,656
- OK.
- Thanks for being so nice.

452
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:26,130
Good night.

453
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,828
You fire her, and I mean it!

454
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:32,269
You don't come in this house
and give me any damn ultimatums.

455
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,440
What is going on?

456
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,636
You answer me

457
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:39,508
keep your voice down.

458
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,673
Our daughter is
in this room sleeping.

459
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:44,979
Don't you let
that whore back in this house again.

460
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:48,453
Now, look, I'm warning you.

461
00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:56,187
That whore has
tutored your daughter,

462
00:24:56,263 --> 00:24:57,958
went to her recital,
picked her up

463
00:24:58,031 --> 00:25:00,158
when you left her sitting
on the school steps twice.

464
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:03,397
OK, and what has she done
for my husband, I wonder.

465
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,098
I have to work, Terry!

466
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:09,108
This is not about your damn job!

467
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:12,634
It's not? Then where
is this coming from all of a sudden?

468
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:14,840
What the hell are you
talking about "all of a sudden"?

469
00:25:14,915 --> 00:25:16,382
This is not all of a sudden!

470
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,509
It's been... I don't even
know how long it's been

471
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:20,644
that I've been begging you,
I've been...

472
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:24,751
I have been begging you
to spend some time with me,

473
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,019
begging you for months.

474
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:27,617
And I have!

475
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,958
What kind of man has to make
an appointment to sleep with his wife?

476
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,498
Obviously, one who has
too much time on his hands.

477
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:35,558
Oh! What do you
want me to do?

478
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,665
What do I want you to do?

479
00:25:41,742 --> 00:25:43,437
What I want you to do.
How about the obvious?

480
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,977
How about baking
a cake for my birthday

481
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:48,173
or spending some time
with me or your daughter, OK?

482
00:25:48,248 --> 00:25:49,180
How about doing
what a wife does,

483
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:50,580
screwing me on a regular?

484
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:51,879
Can you handle that?

485
00:25:51,952 --> 00:25:52,884
You know what?
I am all for solutions,

486
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:54,250
but maybe we could
come up with something

487
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:58,121
that doesn't involve me
stepping back into the fifties!

488
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:02,128
You are so selfish.

489
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,394
I am not selfish.

490
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:08,024
Oh, what the hell are you talking about,
you're not selfish?

491
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,659
Dianne, you laid there
and had your tubes tied,

492
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,670
and you didn't even tell me?
You don't think that's selfish?

493
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,763
Look, this is my body, OK?

494
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,206
You don't have
to carry a child, I do!

495
00:26:16,276 --> 00:26:19,370
You don't have
to miss work, I do!

496
00:26:19,446 --> 00:26:21,937
Dianne, when you get married,
you give up the "Is" for us, OK?

497
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:25,712
You don't make those kind
of decisions without talking to me!

498
00:26:25,786 --> 00:26:27,777
What the hell am I doing?

499
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:29,219
I don't even know why
I'm having this argument with you.

500
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:31,689
I'm tired of arguing about
the same damn thing with you.

501
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:34,591
It's clear to me...
one thing, very clear.

502
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:39,759
You don't want to be married.

503
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:42,131
Can I tell you
what this is about?

504
00:26:42,202 --> 00:26:44,932
My entire career is
going way better than yours.

505
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:48,566
And you're having
some testosterone issues.

506
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,644
And you can't deal with it.

507
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,088
Have you lost your mind?

508
00:27:02,155 --> 00:27:04,749
No.

509
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:07,259
But I'm about to lose my wife.

510
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,937
I'm moving out.

511
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:36,685
I'll be right back.

512
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:43,159
I really love your dad's place.

513
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:46,495
But I got to pay you back.

514
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:47,897
I do!

515
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:50,937
Naw. It's all good.
Don't even sweat that.

516
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:52,266
Mm.

517
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:56,666
Are my legs supposed
to be this sore?

518
00:27:57,878 --> 00:27:59,675
No pain, no gain, right?

519
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:01,805
Huh.

520
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,381
Um...

521
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:11,617
I need to tell you something.

522
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:15,856
Yeah, sure. What's up?

523
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:21,292
I'm really vulnerable right now...

524
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:23,427
and, um...

525
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,709
we can't go to the movies
and hang out and stuff.

526
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:31,607
- What? What do you mean?
- I mean...

527
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:34,579
I just got to the point where I can say
Mike's name without crying,

528
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:37,947
and I don't want to get
caught up in what Patricia

529
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:41,476
and Dr. Phil call
"The Hero Syndrome. "

530
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:43,352
It's when somebody comes along

531
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:45,516
and they help you out,
and just 'cause

532
00:28:45,592 --> 00:28:48,925
they were being nice,
you fall for 'em, and...

533
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:51,964
you're just being nice.

534
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:53,897
I don't know, Shelia.

535
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:59,166
I could have this same hero thing
going on with you, too.

536
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,228
What are you talking about?

537
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:02,366
I'm serious.

538
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:05,002
I mean... look at you.

539
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:11,181
This man was trying
to break you,

540
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:14,550
and every day I see you take some
of that power back.

541
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:16,088
I didn't so anything.

542
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:18,522
I just signed the papers.
I didn't even fight.

543
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:20,992
Sometimes signing the papers is

544
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:23,791
all the fighting you need to do.

545
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,100
Don't play with me.

546
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:30,693
I'm not playing with you.

547
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:36,133
I mean, Shelia,
you are amazing,

548
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:39,201
intelligent,

549
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,941
spiritual, sexy.

550
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:43,676
Strong...

551
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,480
strong and beautiful woman.

552
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:48,612
Not as big as I am.

553
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:50,986
You know, if you're
not happy about the way you look,

554
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:52,547
then change it.

555
00:29:53,727 --> 00:29:55,888
Stop doubting yourself.

556
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:58,487
I mean, it's not attractive.

557
00:29:58,565 --> 00:30:00,829
I don't like it.

558
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:05,497
And hell, it makes me
uncomfortable for you.

559
00:30:05,572 --> 00:30:06,903
I'm sorry.

560
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,407
I'm just so used to...

561
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,380
Mike saying things, I...

562
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:18,043
try to beat him to it.

563
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:19,380
I ain't Mike.

564
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,784
Oh.

565
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,061
Mm.

566
00:30:35,135 --> 00:30:36,193
Mm.

567
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:40,228
Oh, Jesus.
Lord, have mercy. God.

568
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:42,207
I ain't thought that
in a long time.

569
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:43,572
Um...

570
00:30:43,643 --> 00:30:44,871
OK.

571
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:46,913
I think I need to pray.

572
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,912
Um...

573
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:50,006
can we pray?

574
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:53,983
All right.

575
00:30:54,154 --> 00:30:55,917
Well, I hope
she can help her now.

576
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:57,513
Well, if she can...

577
00:30:57,591 --> 00:30:59,923
what are you two doing here?
Did something happen?

578
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:01,358
- No.
- Did something happen to Shelia?

579
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:03,089
- No, no, no. Don't worry.
- No, honey.

580
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:04,858
- Calm down. We're OK.
- Oh.

581
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:07,263
I thought somebody
had died or something.

582
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:08,824
What are you doing here?

583
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:10,494
- Girl, we got men problems.
- Man problems.

584
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,764
Thank God it's just men.

585
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:13,829
OK. That I can deal with.

586
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:15,807
What happened?

587
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:16,968
OK. You ready for this?

588
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,476
Terry moved out.

589
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:21,605
He got his own apartment.
He's so upset with me.

590
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:23,672
And I have never seen
Marcus so mad at me.

591
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,844
He went off.
He set me straight.

592
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,785
And Keisha,
but she deserved it.

593
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:30,322
And Angie, you didn't?

594
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,914
You know, if I didn't
know these men,

595
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:33,721
I would just think
that they were crazy.

596
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:35,090
- They are.
- Yeah.

597
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:36,128
Come on, you guys.

598
00:31:36,196 --> 00:31:38,756
Will you call them
and talk to them?

599
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:40,094
Uh-uh.

600
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,565
No. I am not about to do that.

601
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:43,933
No. I'm not gonna be
all vulnerable.

602
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:46,268
You know, you guys
are just pathetic.

603
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:48,136
If you're not gonna
be honest with your husbands,

604
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:50,369
then who are you gonna
be vulnerable with?

605
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:52,604
- You!
- You!

606
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:55,011
Thank you very much, but...

607
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:58,244
this is the reason why
they're so upset at you.

608
00:31:58,318 --> 00:32:00,809
Because you haven't
been truthful with them.

609
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:02,479
Tell them how you want them
to hold you at night

610
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:05,024
and how you're afraid
for them to leave you.

611
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,217
Y'all know this.

612
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:08,386
Is she kidding me?

613
00:32:08,461 --> 00:32:10,156
I am not about to do that, period.

614
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,927
See, Angie, your problem
is you're afraid

615
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,763
that he won't do what it is
that you want him to do.

616
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:17,359
- You just stubborn.
- So?

617
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,065
I'll tell you what. I'm not ready to face
possible rejection.

618
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,505
- I'm just not.
- Me, either.

619
00:32:21,575 --> 00:32:23,270
Rejection?
Look at you guys

620
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:25,277
sitting here looking like little
lost puppies.

621
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:26,869
Tell them what you
tell me all the time.

622
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:30,246
Tell them the truth.
Tell them what you're feeling.

623
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:33,309
Ew... she makes me sick.

624
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:35,616
She's always got
something smart to say.

625
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:38,249
Listen, I want you guys
to do this little lesson here.

626
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:39,917
- Uh-oh.
- Here we go.

627
00:32:39,993 --> 00:32:41,654
Oh, come on.
You guys stop it.

628
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,320
Some big exercise.

629
00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:45,421
It's gonna work.
Gavin and I just did this.

630
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:48,262
So it's really gonna help.
Take this paper.

631
00:32:48,335 --> 00:32:54,137
On one side of it, I want you to list
all the bad he's ever done.

632
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:58,405
OK, and on the other side, I want you
to list all the good he's ever done.

633
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:01,675
Now, if the bad outweighs
the good, then so be it.

634
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:05,741
Don't hold on.
Just let it go. But...

635
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:08,310
but if this good
outweighs the bad,

636
00:33:08,388 --> 00:33:10,515
then y'all need to be
big little women

637
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,785
and fix this.
This is not healthy.

638
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:14,087
I don't want to be
a big little woman, Pat.

639
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,889
I want to be a little girl.

640
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:17,930
You are not in college
anymore, Angie.

641
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,898
- Just grow up.
- Yeah. Thank you.

642
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:22,230
Well, I got to get
to class, guys. So...

643
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:23,769
I'll see you
at the ceremony, yes?

644
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:25,304
Oh, no, no. We can't make it. Sorry.

645
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:27,670
- She's joking.
- I'm playing.

646
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:29,265
- Of course!
- We'll be there.

647
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:30,434
I want you married
with your husbands, all right?

648
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,375
Well, I might be there
with my new boyfriend

649
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:34,845
- if this list don't look right.
- Angie.

650
00:33:34,914 --> 00:33:37,246
If you do the work, it'll be fine.

651
00:33:37,317 --> 00:33:38,375
- All right.
- Bye.

652
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:39,713
- Bye, baby.
- Thank you.

653
00:33:39,786 --> 00:33:42,721
I tell you, I need a legal pad
to write this list, honey.

654
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,554
You know what I would do
if I was single right now,

655
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:48,924
you know what I'd be doing?

656
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:49,984
Sitting here having
a drink with y'all.

657
00:33:50,063 --> 00:33:51,360
Thanks for giving me a call.

658
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:52,796
They are wasted, man.

659
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:55,232
- We need another round!
- Where's your help, huh?

660
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:56,393
Night off.

661
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:57,401
Man, I told him, quit.

662
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,402
What's up, fellas?

663
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:00,063
- Hey!
- Hey!

664
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,074
How you doing, man?

665
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:03,439
I got the hen, man.

666
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,410
Oh, thanks.

667
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:07,571
We were sitting here
thinking of a way to kill our wives

668
00:34:07,647 --> 00:34:09,911
and wondering
if you could help us.

669
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:12,679
Hey, that always works.
Mm-hmm.

670
00:34:12,752 --> 00:34:15,050
- Oh, man.
- Tell me something, man.

671
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:21,492
Why is it that when a woman say
she want a good man

672
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:26,828
and then she get one, she do
everything she can to drive him crazy.

673
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,424
I got the answer.

674
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:29,991
'Cause women don't
know what they want,

675
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,005
especially yours.
Am I right, Gavin?

676
00:34:34,941 --> 00:34:37,034
I'm gonna divorce Dianne.
I'm gonna call her up and tell her,

677
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,476
"You know what?
We're getting a divorce. "

678
00:34:39,546 --> 00:34:41,639
Yeah, right. You and Dianne
are made for each other.

679
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:43,774
No. No. I ain't gonna call her.
I'm gonna send her a text.

680
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,408
You want to piss a woman off,
send her a text like something.

681
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:47,646
Oh, stop it.
Stop it, man.

682
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:50,121
You got a good woman.
You need to work it out.

683
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,717
Good woman or not,
she got to be willing

684
00:34:53,793 --> 00:34:55,818
to work it out.

685
00:34:58,031 --> 00:34:59,862
I had a good woman once.

686
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:01,696
Hmm.

687
00:35:04,137 --> 00:35:06,037
Anybody seen Shelia?

688
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:09,200
Boy, Angela talks to her
from time to time

689
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:10,435
- but...
- Really?

690
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:14,446
Sound to me like you miss her.

691
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:15,845
- I'm...
- What?

692
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:18,179
No! No!
I don't miss her.

693
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:20,685
You made a mistake.
It's OK to say so.

694
00:35:20,754 --> 00:35:22,119
I didn't make a mistake, all right?

695
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:24,486
Who are you talking to?

696
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:27,048
Heh. I should of just, you know...

697
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,925
I should of just...

698
00:35:29,996 --> 00:35:32,692
done a background
check on Trina.

699
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:34,427
Ha! Girl don't do nothing.

700
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:36,469
She don't cook, don't clean,

701
00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:40,165
don't... wash clothes.
Don't do...

702
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,834
take the garbage out.
She don't do...

703
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:44,900
she just don't.
Oh, she can shop.

704
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:47,606
'Cause she burning up
my American Express.

705
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,343
All right! Whoo!
Quality. Quality.

706
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:53,885
Hey, Gavin. You know
what that sound like to me?

707
00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:55,079
<i>80l20.</i>

708
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:56,747
I tried to...
yeah, right.

709
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:58,586
You think about that
with Dianne.

710
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:02,526
Man, I'm going back to her.
I'm just right now...

711
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:04,062
I'm teaching her a lesson.

712
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:06,462
Yeah. What lesson is that?

713
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:08,558
You know
what the lesson is?

714
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:10,626
I ain't gotta be there.
That's the real lesson.

715
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:12,796
I don't... I don't...
I don't have to be there.

716
00:36:12,872 --> 00:36:14,635
I can go.

717
00:36:14,707 --> 00:36:15,799
Boo-yah!

718
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:16,807
Yeah, that's great.

719
00:36:16,876 --> 00:36:18,468
Yeah. That's gonna look good.

720
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:20,706
36 years old.
Out there dating again.

721
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,214
Mm. That ain't the good look.

722
00:36:23,283 --> 00:36:26,252
Especially the way
you're missing your ex.

723
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:28,947
Hey, Mike. You got
what you wanted, didn't you?

724
00:36:38,298 --> 00:36:40,163
What's all this for?

725
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:42,724
I just thought
I would cook for you.

726
00:36:42,802 --> 00:36:45,270
Come on, baby. Sit.

727
00:36:45,338 --> 00:36:48,068
Oh, just let me
wash my hands.

728
00:36:48,141 --> 00:36:49,506
OK.

729
00:36:59,886 --> 00:37:01,353
Hello?

730
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:02,683
Hello?

731
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:03,813
Marcus?

732
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,358
Man, she has cooked.

733
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:09,224
She ain't said two words to me
since we got back.

734
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:11,388
I've been sleeping
with one eye open

735
00:37:11,464 --> 00:37:13,694
and she cooked.

736
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:15,495
Well, if she ain't cooking grits,

737
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:16,967
you ain't got nothing
to worry about.

738
00:37:17,036 --> 00:37:18,128
No, man.

739
00:37:18,204 --> 00:37:20,695
She's trying to kill me.

740
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:22,741
Look, I'm calling you
'cause I want you to know

741
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:25,607
if something happens to me,
I want y'all to know she did it.

742
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,168
Just go eat
your dinner, all right?

743
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:28,942
Angela's not that crazy.

744
00:37:29,015 --> 00:37:31,279
This is Angela.

745
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:32,943
You know what?
You're right.

746
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:36,147
She is kinda crazy.
Look, if anything tastes funny, spit it out.

747
00:37:36,222 --> 00:37:37,780
OK, OK.

748
00:37:37,857 --> 00:37:41,315
I love you, man.

749
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:43,521
I love you, too.

750
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:46,622
# Swift as a wind song #

751
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:52,968
# You sang the music of anhonest bird #

752
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,033
# I waited for some contradiction #

753
00:37:58,111 --> 00:38:03,549
# Truth was ringing in your every word #

754
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:09,577
# And every moment since then #

755
00:38:09,656 --> 00:38:13,490
# The one thing I can tell #

756
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:19,327
# Is that I belong with you #

757
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:26,066
# And no one else #

758
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,705
You haven't touched your food.

759
00:38:38,251 --> 00:38:40,811
It's good, but...
I'm just not that hungry.

760
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:43,117
You know what I'm saying?

761
00:38:43,189 --> 00:38:45,123
You're still lying.

762
00:38:52,465 --> 00:38:55,332
I'm just saying, look...

763
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:59,337
you ain't said two words to me,
and all of a sudden

764
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:04,502
I come home and you cooked.

765
00:39:04,577 --> 00:39:07,011
Marcus, look, I know
that I haven't been

766
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,480
the easiest woman
to get along with.

767
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:12,382
And I know it's been
hard for you.

768
00:39:12,452 --> 00:39:15,512
But none of that matters.

769
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:18,182
Life is too short.

770
00:39:18,257 --> 00:39:19,952
You're trying to kill me,
ain't you? Just cut to it.

771
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:21,823
Patricia gave you one of them
mind games to play on me.

772
00:39:21,894 --> 00:39:25,125
Now, if it's about Keisha,
we can talk about Keisha.

773
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:28,429
Marcus, it's not about her.

774
00:39:29,402 --> 00:39:31,836
It's about us, right?

775
00:39:31,904 --> 00:39:33,769
Honey, I love you.

776
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,637
I just want us
to start over again.

777
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:38,643
Just me and you.

778
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:41,236
If that's OK.

779
00:39:41,314 --> 00:39:43,282
You're serious?

780
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:44,748
Yes.

781
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,686
So...

782
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:54,454
if that is the case,

783
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:56,586
you gonna stop talking to me
like you crazy.

784
00:39:56,662 --> 00:39:58,289
Done.

785
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:01,433
We're gonna stay
committed to each other.

786
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:07,529
And know that I am
doing my best.

787
00:40:07,607 --> 00:40:09,939
I know you are, Marcus.

788
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:13,308
And I'm so sorry for making you feel
like you weren't.

789
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:15,244
One more.

790
00:40:15,314 --> 00:40:17,646
You're gonna have to
stop drinking.

791
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:22,752
OK!

792
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:25,814
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

793
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:35,165
Oh, one second. OK?

794
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:43,942
I love you, baby.

795
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:47,070
I love you, too.

796
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,470
Finished.

797
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:57,822
- I bought that in Africa.
- Did you really?

798
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,653
- Yeah. Me and Dianne.
- Wow.

799
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:02,353
Oh. It's gorgeous.

800
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:05,260
Come in!

801
00:41:05,331 --> 00:41:07,128
It was last year.

802
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,758
Really?

803
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:17,733
Dianne, what are you doing...?

804
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,505
Let me just say this, please.

805
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:23,481
I am wrong.
I am so wrong

806
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:26,177
for not telling you, and...

807
00:41:26,252 --> 00:41:28,482
I've just taken you for granted.

808
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:30,317
And I'll do anything.

809
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:32,983
I'll do whatever it takes,
whatever it takes

810
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:35,619
so that you can
just come home.

811
00:41:35,695 --> 00:41:39,722
Because... I made that list,

812
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:44,361
and I realize that I need you
and I love you.

813
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:45,836
What list?
What are you talking about?

814
00:41:45,905 --> 00:41:47,031
I'm gonna go.

815
00:41:47,106 --> 00:41:51,543
No, no, no.

816
00:41:51,611 --> 00:41:55,411
What are you saying?
Are you saying we can work it out?

817
00:41:55,481 --> 00:41:56,641
Yes.

818
00:41:56,716 --> 00:41:58,149
Let me ask you something.

819
00:41:58,217 --> 00:42:00,777
When we were in Colorado,
we were in the car,

820
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:05,313
and I said, "I tested
Kenya because, so and so. "

821
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:08,383
And then you said, "Huh,"
like she wasn't mine.

822
00:42:08,461 --> 00:42:11,487
- Were you having an affair or something?
- No!

823
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:16,297
Terry, I was just mad.
I just said that to get back at you.

824
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:18,633
To get back at me?

825
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:20,137
OK.

826
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:22,640
And we can work this out
through anything?

827
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:25,905
Yes.

828
00:42:25,978 --> 00:42:28,970
OK. I guess that means
I'll tell you this then.

829
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:31,676
She's pregnant.

830
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:37,450
With twins.

831
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:39,991
Oh, OK, OK.

832
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:41,583
OK, you know what?
We'll work it out.

833
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:43,390
We'll work it out.

834
00:42:43,462 --> 00:42:45,623
You mean it?

835
00:42:45,698 --> 00:42:46,687
Yeah.

836
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:50,027
OK.

837
00:42:50,102 --> 00:42:52,627
Well, just like you said
just to get back at me

838
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:54,570
I just did that
to get back at you.

839
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,870
- She's not.
- Oh, Terry!

840
00:42:56,943 --> 00:43:00,709
- Dr. Brock.
- We have never, ever, ever had an affair.

841
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,407
There's nothing going on.

842
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:04,210
And my boyfriend
would be very upset to hear you say that.

843
00:43:04,283 --> 00:43:06,217
Yes. He's a big linebacker.

844
00:43:06,285 --> 00:43:07,217
Thank God you got a boyfriend.

845
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:08,412
- Yes, I do.
- All right.

846
00:43:08,487 --> 00:43:10,216
Well, then can you
just come home?

847
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:12,382
Please take him.
Take him home.

848
00:43:15,294 --> 00:43:17,228
I'm very sorry.

849
00:43:17,296 --> 00:43:19,230
- I will lock up.
- All right. Lock up.

850
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:30,899
Hey.

851
00:43:30,977 --> 00:43:33,639
- How you doing, Marcus?
- Mike, Mike, look at you.

852
00:43:33,713 --> 00:43:35,442
Hey, boy, you looking
real sweet.

853
00:43:35,514 --> 00:43:37,345
Oh, nice suit.

854
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,850
I know your bald-headed ass
did not bring her up in here.

855
00:43:39,919 --> 00:43:41,682
- Baby.
- Yes, I did.

856
00:43:41,754 --> 00:43:43,449
All right. Come on.
Come on, now. Hey.

857
00:43:43,522 --> 00:43:45,012
- Hi.
- You look gorgeous.

858
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:46,115
Thank you.
So do you.

859
00:43:46,192 --> 00:43:47,682
And where have you been?

860
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,625
'Cause Pat's having a meltdown
about hair.

861
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:50,719
- Oh, are you serious?
- Yes.

862
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:52,024
Come on. I'm gonna
show you where she is.

863
00:43:52,098 --> 00:43:53,292
OK. I'll see you guys.
You look good. Bye, baby.

864
00:43:53,366 --> 00:43:54,890
Mwah!

865
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:58,994
Why is your wife so evil?

866
00:43:59,071 --> 00:44:01,198
You stop it. All right?

867
00:44:01,274 --> 00:44:02,901
I'm playing.

868
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,340
So, how you guys
been doing?

869
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,742
- We're good. How have you been?
- Good.

870
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:08,074
- Great.
- Good. Good.

871
00:44:08,147 --> 00:44:09,409
- You look good.
- Thank you.

872
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:12,280
Well, I'm gonna go to the ladies room
and freshen up.

873
00:44:12,351 --> 00:44:14,285
- All right.
- Ooh! Lipstick.

874
00:44:19,892 --> 00:44:21,450
Lipstick.
Don't kiss me.

875
00:44:21,527 --> 00:44:22,994
Stop, stop, stop.

876
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,880
Shelia?

877
00:44:47,053 --> 00:44:48,884
Heh.

878
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:54,717
- Trina.
- Wow.

879
00:44:54,794 --> 00:44:58,423
You look amazing.

880
00:44:58,497 --> 00:45:00,192
How... how are you?

881
00:45:00,266 --> 00:45:02,063
I feel amazing.

882
00:45:04,804 --> 00:45:05,771
Wow.

883
00:45:06,972 --> 00:45:09,941
I wondered what I would do
when I saw you again.

884
00:45:11,444 --> 00:45:16,541
If I would cuss you out
or stomp you on the street,

885
00:45:16,615 --> 00:45:18,708
whup that ass.

886
00:45:22,121 --> 00:45:23,486
And amazingly...

887
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:28,256
all I want to do is pray for you.

888
00:45:31,964 --> 00:45:33,932
But don't tempt me.

889
00:45:36,035 --> 00:45:38,026
Stay away from
the wine bottles, OK?

890
00:45:40,272 --> 00:45:42,399
Have a good evening.

891
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,455
Sheriff?

892
00:46:00,493 --> 00:46:02,586
Oh, what you doing here?

893
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:06,256
Well, we came to support Patricia
on her big night.

894
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:07,629
"We?" Who's we?

895
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,361
Me and my wife.

896
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,704
OK. I think I'm ready.

897
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:21,338
Shelia?

898
00:46:25,651 --> 00:46:27,676
Hello, Mike.

899
00:46:30,322 --> 00:46:32,517
Which way is it?

900
00:46:32,591 --> 00:46:34,149
Right up here
to the left, honey.

901
00:46:34,226 --> 00:46:36,558
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

902
00:46:42,868 --> 00:46:43,800
Perfect!

903
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:45,598
Thank you. So much.

904
00:46:45,671 --> 00:46:47,935
That's beautiful.

905
00:46:48,007 --> 00:46:50,066
Divas...

906
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:52,303
Oh, my God!

907
00:46:52,378 --> 00:46:54,346
Oh, you remembered.

908
00:46:54,413 --> 00:46:56,278
- How could I forget?
- What happened?

909
00:46:56,348 --> 00:46:59,283
Where? Oh...

910
00:46:59,351 --> 00:47:02,252
Oh, my God!

911
00:47:02,321 --> 00:47:05,051
We've been worried
about you, you know.

912
00:47:05,124 --> 00:47:06,216
I'm fine.

913
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:08,556
That's this glow that
I see happening here?

914
00:47:08,627 --> 00:47:10,788
I haven't seen that
in a long time.

915
00:47:10,863 --> 00:47:13,423
I'd like to think I had a little something
to do with that.

916
00:47:13,499 --> 00:47:15,729
Oh, hey, Troy.

917
00:47:15,801 --> 00:47:17,234
How you doing, ladies?

918
00:47:17,303 --> 00:47:18,634
What are you doing here?

919
00:47:18,704 --> 00:47:21,867
Shelia?

920
00:47:21,941 --> 00:47:24,774
I stayed in Colorado.

921
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:28,007
We're married now.

922
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,547
Get out!

923
00:47:29,615 --> 00:47:32,345
You're about to make me
have a heart attack.

924
00:47:32,418 --> 00:47:34,750
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

925
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,015
Troy, you gotta go.
Get out. Troy, get out.

926
00:47:37,089 --> 00:47:40,286
We need to speak to our friend,
so she can tell us what happened.

927
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:42,520
- All right, all right. I'm leaving.
- Bye.

928
00:47:42,595 --> 00:47:43,960
Oh, Shelia!

929
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:46,054
Shelia and Troy together?

930
00:47:46,131 --> 00:47:47,621
Yes. They're together.

931
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,224
They're together
and they look,

932
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:51,394
you know, she look really good.

933
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:52,698
She looks what?

934
00:47:52,771 --> 00:47:54,329
Did you hear?
I missed it, too.

935
00:47:54,406 --> 00:47:55,338
I said she looked good.

936
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:57,238
OK, she looked really good. Mike.

937
00:47:57,309 --> 00:48:00,301
- All right. She look really good.
- OK. Good.

938
00:48:00,379 --> 00:48:03,041
So, I, you know... it was just...
I haven't seen her in awhile.

939
00:48:03,115 --> 00:48:05,447
So it was kind of,
you know, ooh.

940
00:48:05,518 --> 00:48:07,543
What the hell
are you saying, man?

941
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,850
I'm just saying
it was kind of surprising.

942
00:48:09,922 --> 00:48:11,651
It was kind of
surprising to see her.

943
00:48:11,724 --> 00:48:13,123
To see her what?

944
00:48:13,192 --> 00:48:14,659
Yeah. I just haven't seen her
in awhile, that's all.

945
00:48:14,727 --> 00:48:17,252
- You miss her?
- What?

946
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:18,489
Come on, man.

947
00:48:18,564 --> 00:48:21,260
What, y'all drinking too much.

948
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,766
Troy.

949
00:48:22,835 --> 00:48:24,063
How you doing, guys?

950
00:48:24,136 --> 00:48:25,797
Hey, Sheriff.

951
00:48:25,871 --> 00:48:27,736
What's going on?
Good to see you, brother.

952
00:48:27,806 --> 00:48:29,273
Same here.

953
00:48:29,341 --> 00:48:32,333
Well, congratulate him. You know,
him and Shelia got married.

954
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:33,776
Right.
Hey, congrat...

955
00:48:33,846 --> 00:48:35,575
Can you believe
he married my ex?

956
00:48:35,648 --> 00:48:36,637
To you and Shelia.

957
00:48:36,715 --> 00:48:39,445
- To you and Shelia.
- Yes.

958
00:48:39,518 --> 00:48:40,450
Thank you.

959
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:41,451
He what now?

960
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,351
Said he married my ex.

961
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:45,890
One man's ex can be
another man's treasure.

962
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:50,952
So, um, she had
that gastric bypass?

963
00:48:52,131 --> 00:48:54,224
No.

964
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,599
Actually, we just...
we just worked out together.

965
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,160
Ooh.

966
00:48:59,238 --> 00:49:01,229
You know what
that means, right?

967
00:49:01,307 --> 00:49:04,470
L... I just can't
wait to see her.

968
00:49:04,543 --> 00:49:05,874
I want to see her, too, man.

969
00:49:05,945 --> 00:49:11,008
I can't wait to see
what working out will do for you.

970
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:13,779
I'm going to the table, man.
I can't play with y'all.

971
00:49:13,852 --> 00:49:15,581
Hey, man.
Don't be bitter, man.

972
00:49:15,654 --> 00:49:18,487
We're just... we're just
clowning around.

973
00:49:19,525 --> 00:49:21,493
Working out, man.
Working out.

974
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,790
I thought...

975
00:49:23,862 --> 00:49:26,626
I prayed...

976
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:29,190
that God would save my marriage.

977
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:36,332
But it wasn't built
on the right things anyway.

978
00:49:38,611 --> 00:49:43,913
I thought if Mike
got right, you know...

979
00:49:43,983 --> 00:49:45,917
if I lost the weight,

980
00:49:45,985 --> 00:49:48,010
that everything would be OK.

981
00:49:51,857 --> 00:49:53,552
It's been hard.

982
00:49:58,297 --> 00:50:00,322
It's been hard.

983
00:50:02,534 --> 00:50:04,468
But it's me.

984
00:50:04,536 --> 00:50:07,027
I did it.

985
00:50:07,106 --> 00:50:08,232
I'm doing it.

986
00:50:08,307 --> 00:50:10,138
That's right.

987
00:50:10,209 --> 00:50:12,370
And it feels so good.

988
00:50:12,444 --> 00:50:14,537
It feels so good.

989
00:50:14,613 --> 00:50:15,602
Oh!

990
00:50:17,683 --> 00:50:21,551
I thought that God
had given up on me.

991
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:27,420
Yeah.

992
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:31,528
Because...

993
00:50:31,597 --> 00:50:35,465
here I am in this marriage
and it don't work.

994
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:38,560
He don't love me,
he don't like me.

995
00:50:41,674 --> 00:50:44,199
But he brought me somebody.

996
00:50:46,712 --> 00:50:48,407
He is an amazing man.

997
00:50:49,448 --> 00:50:51,473
He is supportive.

998
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:53,575
He doesn't criticize me.

999
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:56,678
He walks with me.

1000
00:50:56,755 --> 00:50:59,417
He loves me through all of it.

1001
00:50:59,491 --> 00:51:01,652
You understand what I'm saying?

1002
00:51:01,727 --> 00:51:03,627
Oh, Jesus.

1003
00:51:03,696 --> 00:51:05,755
I didn't have that.
And I do now.

1004
00:51:05,831 --> 00:51:08,299
And...

1005
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:10,562
I wake up.

1006
00:51:10,636 --> 00:51:14,094
I wake up with so much joy
in my heart.

1007
00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:18,843
Oh!

1008
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:22,677
Oh, God.
Help us, Jesus.

1009
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:24,340
He already has, huh?

1010
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:28,182
I wake up with so much joy
in my heart.

1011
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:29,777
Ah.

1012
00:51:29,855 --> 00:51:32,551
You are so beautiful, Shelia.

1013
00:51:32,624 --> 00:51:35,184
Oh, my God.
But you are not...

1014
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,956
- with that makeup.
- Aah!

1015
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,759
We need to get it together.

1016
00:51:39,832 --> 00:51:41,527
- This is.
- No, we can't do that.

1017
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,465
Oh, my God.

1018
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:44,593
OK, we got to get it together.

1019
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:47,503
I need some tissue.
Oh, Jesus!

1020
00:51:47,573 --> 00:51:50,167
OK, give me some.
I need some powder.

1021
00:51:50,242 --> 00:51:52,107
First of all,
I'd like to thank everyone

1022
00:51:52,177 --> 00:51:54,577
for such a lovely, lovely evening.

1023
00:51:54,646 --> 00:51:59,709
I feel very proud to be
the first black woman

1024
00:51:59,785 --> 00:52:03,778
to receive this award.

1025
00:52:06,158 --> 00:52:08,149
I'm very blessed

1026
00:52:08,227 --> 00:52:10,718
to have won an honor

1027
00:52:10,796 --> 00:52:16,063
for a book that has given me
such gratification

1028
00:52:16,135 --> 00:52:22,563
and information...
and great vacations.

1029
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:27,245
Hey, we really didn't
get a chance to talk.

1030
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:30,076
On purpose?

1031
00:52:31,984 --> 00:52:34,578
Come on, Shelia.
Don't be like that.

1032
00:52:34,653 --> 00:52:38,248
What do you want, Mike?
I'm trying to listen to Patricia.

1033
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:42,684
Look, I'm sorry about
how all this went down.

1034
00:52:42,761 --> 00:52:44,558
Dianne, Terry...

1035
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:48,430
OK? I don't... I don't
want you to be mad at me.

1036
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,092
Marcus...

1037
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:51,261
forgiveness, you know?

1038
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:52,860
I want you to forgive me.

1039
00:52:52,938 --> 00:52:55,702
Isn't that what
the good book says?

1040
00:52:55,774 --> 00:52:57,765
Yes.

1041
00:52:57,843 --> 00:53:01,540
I forgave you a long time ago.

1042
00:53:01,613 --> 00:53:03,547
Because if I had stayed angry,

1043
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:06,812
I would have taken it
out on Troy.

1044
00:53:06,885 --> 00:53:08,853
And he is too good for that.

1045
00:53:08,921 --> 00:53:11,014
You understand?

1046
00:53:11,089 --> 00:53:12,181
Yeah.

1047
00:53:12,257 --> 00:53:14,725
- Yeah. He's too good for that.
- Mm-hmm.

1048
00:53:14,793 --> 00:53:20,698
Yeah. Hey, I was your first.
You never forget your first, right?

1049
00:53:20,766 --> 00:53:27,228
You did think you were my first,
didn't you?

1050
00:53:27,306 --> 00:53:29,604
I just wanted to say
sorry and, uh...

1051
00:53:29,675 --> 00:53:36,103
<i>you know, there's this, um,
there's this thing called the 20l80 rule.</i>

1052
00:53:36,181 --> 00:53:39,150
Mike...

1053
00:53:39,218 --> 00:53:43,518
<i>I know all about the 80l20 rule.</i>

1054
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:49,289
Look... I thank you for helping me
find myself then.

1055
00:53:49,361 --> 00:53:51,454
But the woman I am now

1056
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,327
is done with you.

1057
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:57,664
So turn around
and go back to Trina.

1058
00:53:57,736 --> 00:54:00,170
Your 20.

1059
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:01,968
I say clear and loud...

1060
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:06,136
for everyone to hear...

1061
00:54:06,211 --> 00:54:08,645
Gavin...

1062
00:54:08,714 --> 00:54:11,274
I love you.

1063
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:13,113
I love you.

1064
00:54:14,152 --> 00:54:16,814
And in closing,

1065
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:20,052
I would like for everyone
to remember

1066
00:54:20,125 --> 00:54:27,258
the greatest achievement
for any human being

1067
00:54:27,332 --> 00:54:30,460
is to love God...

1068
00:54:30,535 --> 00:54:33,504
yourself...

1069
00:54:33,572 --> 00:54:35,938
and others.

1070
00:54:36,008 --> 00:54:39,171
Thank you so much for this.
Thank you.

1071
00:55:55,053 --> 00:55:58,545
# Why do you tell me this #

1072
00:55:58,623 --> 00:56:05,119
# Were you looking for my reaction? #

1073
00:56:05,197 --> 00:56:08,997
# What do you need to know? #

1074
00:56:09,067 --> 00:56:15,438
# Don't you know
I'll always be your girl? #

1075
00:56:15,507 --> 00:56:19,375
# You do not have
to prove to me #

1076
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:24,905
# You're beautiful to strangers #

1077
00:56:24,983 --> 00:56:31,388
# I've got loving eyes of my own #

1078
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:33,651

1079
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:36,353
# I can tell #

1080
00:56:36,428 --> 00:56:40,159
# You belong to me #

1081
00:56:40,232 --> 00:56:42,166
# Tell her you belong... #

1082
00:56:42,234 --> 00:56:46,364
# You belong to me #

1083
00:56:46,438 --> 00:56:52,240

# You belong to me #

1086
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:08,082
# Can it be that you are not sure? #

1087
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,789
# You belong to me #

1088
00:57:11,863 --> 00:57:15,492
# Thought we'd closed the book #

1089
00:57:15,567 --> 00:57:20,903
# I thought we'd locked
the door, baby #

1090
00:57:20,972 --> 00:57:27,707
# You don't have to prove
you're beautiful to strangers #

1091
00:57:27,779 --> 00:57:33,945
# I've got loving eyes of my own #

1092
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:36,715

1093
00:57:36,788 --> 00:57:39,313

1094
00:57:39,391 --> 00:57:44,351
# You belong to me #

1096
00:57:48,433 --> 00:57:50,060
# Yes, you do #

1097
00:57:50,135 --> 00:57:52,763

1098
00:57:52,838 --> 00:57:55,500

1101
00:58:00,946 --> 00:58:03,312
# You belong to me #

1102
00:58:03,381 --> 00:58:05,815
# Won't you tell her, baby #

1103
00:58:05,884 --> 00:58:08,352
# You belong to me #

1104
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:11,480
# Tell her that I love you #

1105
00:58:11,556 --> 00:58:14,252
# You belong to me #

1106
00:58:14,326 --> 00:58:16,294
# Tell this woman #

1107
00:58:16,361 --> 00:58:18,921
# You belong to me #

1108
00:58:18,997 --> 00:58:24,367
# Tell #

1109
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:51,256
# You belong to me #

1110
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:54,890

all of my friends, baby #

1116
00:59:07,879 --> 00:59:10,404
# You belong to me #

1117
00:59:10,482 --> 00:59:12,507
# Told me this was going on #

1118
00:59:12,584 --> 00:59:15,747
# You belong to me #

1119
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,447
# Ah #

1120
00:59:17,522 --> 00:59:20,286
# You belong to me #

1121
00:59:22,527 --> 00:59:26,293
# You belong to me #

1122
00:59:26,364 --> 00:59:28,093
# I can't stand it, baby #
