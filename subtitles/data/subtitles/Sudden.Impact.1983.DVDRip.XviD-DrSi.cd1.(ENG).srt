1
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,824
All rise, please.

2
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:57,951
The Court of California
is now in session.

3
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,665
The Honorable Judge Lundstrom,
presiding.

4
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:04,088
Please be seated.

5
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:37,122
Mr. D'Ambrosia?
This case is a travesty!

6
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:42,336
You have no evidence whatsoever
linking the accused to the murder.

7
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:47,507
The gun found in his car was obtained
as the result of an illegal search.

8
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:51,387
In the eyes of the court
it does not exist.

9
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,015
The search was illegal
because Inspector Callahan...

10
00:06:56,438 --> 00:06:58,431
...and this is an old story...

11
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:03,810
...did not have sufficient probable
cause for detaining Mr. Hawkins.

12
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:09,319
The gun is inadmissible and
the charges against the defendant...

13
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:11,405
...are dismissed!

14
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,778
Mr. D'Ambrosia...

15
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:19,501
...be assured that I will discuss
your case-preparation techniques...

16
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:22,170
...with the district attorney.

17
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,377
Bailiff, next!

18
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,504
How many times, Callahan?

19
00:07:57,714 --> 00:08:01,843
You can't bust them
because you think they're dirty.

20
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:04,092
"Psychic" don't cut it.

21
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,204
Hey, Callahan.

22
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,377
Don't look so puked-out.
Better luck next time, fool.

23
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:46,100
Listen, punk.

24
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,311
To me, you're just dog shit,
you understand?

25
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:51,847
Many things can happen to dog shit.

26
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:54,605
It can be scraped up with a shovel.

27
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:58,983
It can dry up and blow away,
or be stepped on and squashed.

28
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:02,485
My advice:
Be careful where the dog shits you.

29
00:09:13,131 --> 00:09:14,709
Class act, Callahan.

30
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,920
A real class act.

31
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:49,577
Loretta.

32
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:59,707
You did real good with that cop!

33
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:04,911
Now, I want everything.
Money, watches, rings, everything!

34
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:07,628
Quick! Move!

35
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:10,759
Come with me.
We'll have a little party!

36
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:21,732
What are you doing,
you pig-head sucker?

37
00:11:24,777 --> 00:11:29,486
Every day for the last 10 years,
Loretta gives me a black coffee.

38
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:33,698
Today she gives me a black coffee,
but with sugar in it.

39
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:35,698
A lot of sugar.

40
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:38,287
I just came back to complain.

41
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:41,624
Now, you boys put those guns down.

42
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:45,047
Say what?

43
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,588
We're not just going
to let you walk out of here.

44
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:55,176
Who is "we," sucker?

45
00:11:56,854 --> 00:11:58,847
Smith and Wesson...

46
00:11:59,482 --> 00:12:00,561
...and me.

47
00:12:55,544 --> 00:12:56,955
Go ahead...

48
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:59,211
...make my day.

49
00:13:27,997 --> 00:13:32,789
Call D'Ambrosia in the D.A.'s office,
ask him if coffee is psychic.

50
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:47,804
- Ernie.
- What?

51
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:52,562
Look who's going into the hotel.
Is that who I think it is?

52
00:13:52,774 --> 00:13:54,352
Shit!

53
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,360
Why me?

54
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,189
A nothing detail!
A lousy peeper tour!

55
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,281
So, what do we do now?

56
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:05,329
Call Captain Briggs, let him decide.

57
00:14:15,758 --> 00:14:18,249
May I have your invitation, sir?

58
00:14:21,598 --> 00:14:24,718
I don't understand,
inspector Callahan.

59
00:14:30,357 --> 00:14:33,394
You know the number
for San Francisco General?

60
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:34,642
Yes, I do.

61
00:14:34,862 --> 00:14:38,362
Why don't you call,
have them send an ambulance?

62
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:40,864
Tell them there's two assholes...

63
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:44,577
...with multiple contusions
and sundry broken bones.

64
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,373
- Inspector Callahan.
- I want to talk to Threlkis.

65
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:52,626
At his granddaughter's wedding?
On what business?

66
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:57,503
- To help him catch the bouquet.
- They have harassment laws.

67
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,113
Sit down. Please.

68
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:16,690
Champagne? It's imported.

69
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:22,284
Men, like wine, should grow finer,
more civilized.

70
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:25,832
They should mellow,
become more worldly.

71
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:27,788
But not Callahan.

72
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:32,334
Callahan is the one constant
in an ever-changing universe.

73
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:37,055
Linda Doker?

74
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:40,763
Fished out of the bay a month ago.

75
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:43,848
Her breasts were slashed.
Her feet burned.

76
00:15:44,356 --> 00:15:46,681
Her face smashed to a pulp.

77
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:49,558
I read about it.
A hooker.

78
00:15:50,362 --> 00:15:52,190
A very expensive one.

79
00:15:52,406 --> 00:15:57,532
In fact, her specialty was making
old scumbags mellow and worldly.

80
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:02,866
She had a special customer
who said lots of things.

81
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:05,251
You are a fool, Callahan.

82
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:09,417
She may have been clever
and written them down.

83
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:11,710
Maybe she made a copy of it.

84
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:16,093
Maybe she didn't tell
when she was being tortured.

85
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:21,176
What will the scumbag's bosses
say when they find out?

86
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,773
Or his family?

87
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,146
Maybe his ass is in a wringer.

88
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,314
You fucking...

89
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:44,664
Someone help us.

90
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:48,378
Call an ambulance.

91
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:57,927
Sorry, inspector, but captain...

92
00:16:58,146 --> 00:16:59,177
What happened?

93
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:02,814
Someone grabbed their chest.
Must've seen the bill.

94
00:17:03,026 --> 00:17:04,355
Oh, my God.

95
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:25,547
Stand back, please.

96
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,309
Harry, wait till you see this.

97
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:41,141
Some stiff got himself
a. 38-caliber vasectomy.

98
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,400
Harry, you don't look so hot.

99
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:51,193
Bad night? All nookied out?

100
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:05,711
Gang hit? Screwed-up drug score?
Unlucky john?

101
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:08,088
Or an unhappy love affair?

102
00:18:09,141 --> 00:18:11,893
Don't tell me this shit's
getting to you.

103
00:18:12,103 --> 00:18:15,602
Not Harry Callahan. Say it ain't so.

104
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:20,603
No, this stuff isn't getting to me.
Shootings, knifings, beatings.

105
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:24,570
Old ladies getting bashed
for Social Security checks.

106
00:18:24,783 --> 00:18:28,069
Teachers being thrown out of windows.

107
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:31,787
- That doesn't bother me a bit.
- Harry, take it easy.

108
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:35,375
Or this job, wading through
the scum of the city.

109
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:41,134
Being swept away by bigger and bigger
waves of corruption and red tape.

110
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:44,637
That doesn't bother me.
You know what does?

111
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:48,551
You know what makes me sick
to my stomach?

112
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:51,771
Watching you stuff your face
with hot dogs.

113
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,563
Nobody, I mean nobody,
puts ketchup on a hot dog.

114
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,227
What the hell you talking about?

115
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:04,197
Having our fingers in the holes and
the whole dike is crumbling around us.

116
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:09,205
Lt. Donnelly says to get your... self
to the commissioner's office.

117
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,038
Swell.

118
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,366
- Leah, can I speak with you?
- Jennifer, what marvelous timing.

119
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm giving your work
the favorite positions.

120
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:53,877
I'm afraid you'll be wasting
good selling spots.

121
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:56,664
Nonsense.
They're the jewels of the exhibit.

122
00:19:56,885 --> 00:19:59,293
Don't be discouraged
if they don't sell immediately.

123
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:02,799
They're intense. People need time
to get used to them.

124
00:20:03,017 --> 00:20:05,852
I'm just getting used to them myself.

125
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:10,392
How can such a howl of anguish
come from such a sweet girl as you?

126
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,809
I'm leaving town.

127
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:15,696
- When?
- Today.

128
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:19,443
But you'll miss the exhibit,
the opening.

129
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,448
I'm better at painting
than receptions.

130
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:25,914
Can I give you an address
to send the paintings to?

131
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:29,910
Think positive. It's money
we'll send from the sales.

132
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:34,171
- Where are you going?
- North, to visit someone.

133
00:20:49,026 --> 00:20:51,066
Look at the blond baby!

134
00:20:51,696 --> 00:20:53,356
Mama, check it out.

135
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:56,820
How you doing?

136
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:02,574
She wants to play.

137
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:05,413
- Need a lift?
- Sure, baby.

138
00:21:06,212 --> 00:21:08,703
Then shove a jack up your ass.

139
00:21:13,804 --> 00:21:15,049
<i>Puta.

140
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:25,596
In 30 years of police work,
this is the most outrageous...

141
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:28,528
...transgression of authority ever.

142
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:32,106
- What the hell were you doing?
- My job.

143
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:36,827
It's your job to harass and incite
an old man into a heart attack?

144
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:39,280
My job's to investigate homicide.

145
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:43,201
That old man is the
biggest crime lord in the West.

146
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,745
How did I know
he would vapor-lock?

147
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:47,293
You hoped he would.

148
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:51,126
The Doker case is mine.
It's stuck. I broke it loose.

149
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:53,919
- With threats and intimidation.
- Any way.

150
00:21:56,518 --> 00:21:58,012
Are you aware...

151
00:21:58,353 --> 00:22:02,019
...that you've destroyed
months of surveillance work?

152
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:05,851
Thousands of dollars.
Hundreds of man-hours.

153
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,613
Investigations is busting its ass
to build a case on Threlkis.

154
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:15,986
He would've snaked out of it.
Maybe we saved the taxpayers money.

155
00:22:16,206 --> 00:22:19,160
I ought to bust your ass
down to Traffic.

156
00:22:19,585 --> 00:22:21,957
Or better, kick it off the force.

157
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:26,003
You're a dinosaur, Callahan.
Your ideas don't fit today.

158
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:28,545
What ideas are these?

159
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:31,878
Murder's a crime,
it shouldn't be punished?

160
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:35,595
Don't lecture me, you son of a bitch.

161
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:39,180
You know who you're talking to?
You know my record?

162
00:22:39,398 --> 00:22:42,768
You're a legend in your own
mind.

163
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:46,403
- Goddamn you, Callahan.
- Gentlemen, enough.

164
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:50,565
Inspector, your methods are
different. But you get results.

165
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,286
Often your successes
are more costly to the city...

166
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,876
...in terms of publicity and
destruction than most failures.

167
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:02,290
The press will have a field day
with this fiasco.

168
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:08,012
There may be legal repercussions.
There could be attempts at retaliation.

169
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:11,890
I think the inspector
should take some time off.

170
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:14,853
You're suspending me?

171
00:23:15,689 --> 00:23:18,856
I'm suggesting you vacation
until it's calm.

172
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:20,728
I'm not up for vacation.

173
00:23:21,153 --> 00:23:25,282
Callahan, I'm not fencing with you.
Take a few days off.

174
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:28,243
Harry, a couple of days.

175
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:37,663
Think things over, Callahan.
Get with it.

176
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,205
It's a new ballgame these days.

177
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,299
Funny, I never thought of it
as a game.

178
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:06,490
I examined your sister Elizabeth,
and I tested her again.

179
00:24:06,703 --> 00:24:08,780
There are no changes.

180
00:24:08,998 --> 00:24:12,581
The computerized tomogram
shows no evidence...

181
00:24:12,793 --> 00:24:14,870
...of chronic subdural hematoma.

182
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:17,294
Physically, she's in good shape.

183
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:21,796
She remains in a vegetative state
that we can't penetrate.

184
00:24:22,012 --> 00:24:25,097
Not even a primitive startle response.

185
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:28,511
We'll keep trying,
we're always hopeful.

186
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:30,388
You should be too.

187
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:02,925
Hi, baby.

188
00:25:04,434 --> 00:25:05,845
It's me.

189
00:25:08,438 --> 00:25:09,814
Jen.

190
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,401
I missed you.

191
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:50,271
Beth?

192
00:25:51,945 --> 00:25:53,819
I saw one of them.

193
00:25:55,282 --> 00:25:59,446
He just appeared on the street
in front of me.

194
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:05,284
At first I thought I was having
some horrible vision.

195
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:09,247
But no. He was there.

196
00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:13,425
Older and uglier.

197
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:17,596
I followed him.

198
00:26:21,102 --> 00:26:23,428
For days I watched him.

199
00:26:24,314 --> 00:26:26,354
Then I bought a gun.

200
00:26:27,818 --> 00:26:30,107
I followed him to a bar.

201
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:32,606
I let him pick me up.

202
00:26:34,033 --> 00:26:36,987
Let him drive me to a deserted spot.

203
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:39,288
Let him think...

204
00:26:40,457 --> 00:26:44,325
It was like I was outside myself.

205
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,412
Above me, looking down.

206
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:51,169
Then he touched me.

207
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,303
And I killed him.

208
00:26:59,937 --> 00:27:01,396
Beth?

209
00:27:04,108 --> 00:27:05,768
I love you.

210
00:30:53,821 --> 00:30:57,439
- Hell of a way to have a night off.
- You in on the act?

211
00:30:57,658 --> 00:31:00,743
No, for Christ's sake.
Back off a little.

212
00:31:00,995 --> 00:31:04,744
I worry about your ass.
It'll be shot off or kicked out.

213
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:06,867
What else is new?

214
00:31:07,544 --> 00:31:09,786
They're not a bunch of junkies.

215
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:13,421
To them, you killed Threlkis,
same as shooting him.

216
00:31:13,634 --> 00:31:15,841
They'll keep coming after you.

217
00:31:16,095 --> 00:31:18,468
Good, we'll know where they are.

218
00:31:20,642 --> 00:31:22,931
You're incredible, Callahan.

219
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:26,266
You're also on vacation
as of right now.

220
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:30,975
- I'm not up for vacation.
- You are, I just put you up.

221
00:31:31,195 --> 00:31:34,730
Go get some R and R
and stay out of trouble.

222
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:41,322
You hear me, Callahan?
Peace and quiet!

223
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:33,615
Good morning, Horace.

224
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:37,283
Sweet Sister Sadie,
where the hell did you get that?

225
00:33:37,502 --> 00:33:40,788
I've had it a while.
Thought I'd get used to it.

226
00:33:41,006 --> 00:33:45,004
I heard about the car.
Fabulous, coming after you in tanks.

227
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:50,593
Yeah, they're making those now, for
sheiks and business executives, hoods.

228
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:55,720
- Impregnable to anything but artillery.
- Well, you got that covered.

229
00:34:01,528 --> 00:34:02,608
Not bad.

230
00:34:03,489 --> 00:34:07,569
My ass! You have to strain
the remains for the fingerprints.

231
00:34:09,287 --> 00:34:12,205
Well, this is the. 44 Magnum Auto-Mag.

232
00:34:12,415 --> 00:34:14,207
It has a 300-grain cartridge...

233
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:18,749
...and, if properly used,
it can remove the fingerprints.

234
00:34:33,147 --> 00:34:37,145
I got just the place for you
to go on vacation.

235
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:40,153
- You got that wrong.
- You've no choice.

236
00:34:40,363 --> 00:34:41,857
I think I do.

237
00:34:42,073 --> 00:34:45,324
- You thinking about quitting?
- I might.

238
00:34:45,535 --> 00:34:48,572
Look at the field.
Look what you did there.

239
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:50,532
Not quite good enough.

240
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:54,160
You can't quit, that's what.
Okay, jamf?

241
00:34:54,378 --> 00:34:59,290
What's the brass going to do?
Who are they going to complain to?

242
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:03,922
And the PR men kissing ass,
ass that you kicked.

243
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:06,346
You're nothing but a cop.

244
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,975
That's all you've been
and all you'll be, jamf.

245
00:35:10,188 --> 00:35:11,350
Thank you, doctor.

246
00:35:11,564 --> 00:35:16,476
Listen, when you get cut,
you'll bleed P.D. Blue, jamf.

247
00:35:16,695 --> 00:35:18,070
What the hell's a "jamf"?

248
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,317
- That means you're a jive-ass mother...
- Forget I asked.

249
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,046
Almost there.

250
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:04,447
<i>l hope the house is suitable.

251
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:07,535
It's a bit deserted out in West Cliff.

252
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:12,164
I thought you'd appreciate
the solitude as you seek inspiration.

253
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:13,757
The house is lovely.

254
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:19,009
I've left the fridge stocked for you.
And there's firewood for a fire.

255
00:36:19,222 --> 00:36:21,630
Let's see, here are the keys...

256
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:25,348
...for the carousel house.

257
00:36:26,105 --> 00:36:28,430
Everything you need should be here.

258
00:36:28,649 --> 00:36:33,442
But if you have any additional wants,
we have an account in Dunstan's.

259
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:34,818
Thank you.

260
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:37,949
I can't tell you how happy we are...

261
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,205
...that you're doing this work
for the Historical Society.

262
00:36:42,415 --> 00:36:47,836
Because your work is so impressive
and so impeccably authentic.

263
00:36:48,546 --> 00:36:50,338
I do my research.

264
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:56,047
It must give you great satisfaction
to make old, ugly things right again.

265
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,552
Yes, sometimes it does.

266
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:51,469
Like what I brought you, baby?

267
00:39:05,114 --> 00:39:06,941
I like you, yeah.

268
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:08,760
Tell him that you like it.

269
00:40:08,977 --> 00:40:12,227
Don't forget,
l get my shot at the other one.

270
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:14,190
Come on, Alby.

271
00:40:14,566 --> 00:40:16,310
What are you, queer?

272
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:01,736
There he is.

273
00:41:02,202 --> 00:41:06,663
- We'll show you dog shit, Callahan!
- Come on. Let's go kick some ass.

274
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:47,849
There he is! We've got him!

275
00:43:19,187 --> 00:43:22,971
That's your idea of rest and
recreation? What's wrong with you?

276
00:43:23,191 --> 00:43:26,561
Briggs is berserk and
the commissioner's on my ass.

277
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:28,154
I'm sorry to hear that.

278
00:43:28,364 --> 00:43:30,606
Can't you do anything the easy way?

279
00:43:30,825 --> 00:43:33,399
- Am I on the job or not?
- You are.

280
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,612
Good. Then I'll get to it.

281
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,657
It's not what you think.

282
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:41,536
Remember that cock-shot stiff
by the Cliff House?

283
00:43:41,754 --> 00:43:45,205
He's been here a few years,
but in the shade.

284
00:43:45,758 --> 00:43:49,459
He looks small-time,
but maybe he was never caught.

285
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:50,960
And?

286
00:43:51,389 --> 00:43:54,556
He came from San Paulo,
born and raised.

287
00:43:55,185 --> 00:43:58,637
I want you to go there
and find out about him.

288
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,023
- What is this crap?
- It's a murder case, Harry.

289
00:44:03,236 --> 00:44:06,652
- You're shipping me out?
- I'm doing you a favor.

290
00:44:06,865 --> 00:44:08,988
You are a walking combat zone.

291
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:11,609
People seem to die around you.

292
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:14,450
I don't want civilians
taking the fall.

293
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:16,290
You want to work?
Fine.

294
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,000
You got your assignment.
Get the hell out of here.

295
00:44:20,213 --> 00:44:25,089
Take all the time you need. Maybe
the salt air will agree with you.

296
00:44:27,304 --> 00:44:28,549
Any comments?

297
00:44:32,059 --> 00:44:33,174
Swell.

298
00:45:56,903 --> 00:45:57,935
Freeze!

299
00:46:09,459 --> 00:46:10,787
Around the corner!

300
00:46:48,502 --> 00:46:51,836
What's the matter?
You trying to kill someone?

301
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:05,676
Excuse me.

302
00:47:29,255 --> 00:47:32,422
Police officer in pursuit
of a robbery suspect.

303
00:47:32,634 --> 00:47:35,671
- Shag his ass!
- Get that sucker!

304
00:47:35,888 --> 00:47:38,344
Nail that son of a bitch!

305
00:48:15,557 --> 00:48:17,549
Is he all right?

306
00:48:20,312 --> 00:48:23,681
I guess I'd better
read you your rights.

307
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:32,365
Best damn day trip I've had
since they put me in that home.

308
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,943
Holy mackerel.

309
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,660
So, you're the famous Harry Callahan.

310
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:46,548
I'll make this short and sweet.
I'll only say it once.

311
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,387
We don't need a hotshot to show
us dumb yokels how to do our business.

312
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,641
We know how to do our business,
so you keep your nose out of it.

313
00:48:58,855 --> 00:49:00,432
You read me, Harry?

314
00:49:01,432 --> 00:49:11,432
