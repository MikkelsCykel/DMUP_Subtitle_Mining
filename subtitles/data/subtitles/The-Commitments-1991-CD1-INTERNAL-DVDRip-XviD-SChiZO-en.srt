00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,356
It's not the singin'. It's how he does it.
The showmanship.

342
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,272

00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,919
It's the <i>act,</i> lads. Watch.

347
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,435

00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,113

Well, like... maybe we're

00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,759
D'yeh not get it, lads?

354
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,114
The Irish are the blacks of Europe.
And Dubliners are the blacks of Ireland.

355
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,238
And the northside Dubliners
are the blacks of Dublin.

356
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,030

God bless you, Brother Rabbitte.
Your band need a trumpet?

You're the same age as me da!

374
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,920
You may speak the truth.
But I'm 16 years younger than BB King.

375
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,560
- You've heard of BB King?
- I jammed with the man.

376
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,471
Piss off!

377
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,873
Leicester Mecca, 1972. Didn't give it me
best, though. Had a bit of a head cold.

378
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,156
What's your name, pal?

379
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,153
Joseph Fagan.

380
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,516
Joey "The Lips" Fagan.

381
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,717
And I'm Jimmy "The Bollix" Rabbitte!

382
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,635
I earned me name for me horn playin'.
What did you earn yours for?

383
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,952
- Don't get snotty with me, son.
- I get snotty with no man.

384
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,112
- You played with BB King?
- Among others, brother.

385
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,669
- Like?
- Have we got all day?

386
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,355
Screamin' Jay Hawkins. Martha Reeves.

387
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,510
Sam Cooke.

388
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,829
Poor Sam.

389
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,992
Otis Redding. May the Lord
have mercy on his sweet soul.

390
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,039
Joe Tex. The Four Tops. Stevie Wonder.

391
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,316
He was only 11. A pup.

392
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,517
- Wilson Pickett...
- Why are yeh in Dublin?

393
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,991
I'm tired of the road.
And me mammy isn't very well.

394
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,630
- Why would yeh want to join us?
- The Lord sent me

395
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,110
and the Lord blows my trumpet.

396
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,831
- What did Evel Knievel want?
- God sent him.

397
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,957
- What?
- God sent him.

398
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,236
On a fuckin' Suzuki?

399
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,831
Jaysis!

400
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,071
He can play. That's for sure.

401
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,551
- The Lord doesn't like it if we whisper.
- Why? Is he deaf?

402
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,951
I didn't join this band to sing
Moon fuckin' River.

403
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,000
It's merely my favourite lip-loosener.

404
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,037
We'll be playin' <i>soul.</i>

405
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,831
See, the Lord told me the Irish brothers
needed some soul. Well, Ed Winchell,

406
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,913
a Baptist reverend on Lenox Avenue
in Harlem, told me.

407
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,960
But the Lord told <i>him</i> to tell <i>me.</i>

408
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,830
He said the Irish brothers wouldn't be
shootin' the arses off each other

409
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,276
if they had... soul.

410
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,560
I can't figure him out, Jimmy. He talks
like a priest and he's wearin' slippers!

411
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,155
He's played with all the greats.
Even The Beatles.

412
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,640
- The Beatles?
- Yeah.

413
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,518

00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,829

416
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,756
- What's Steven Clifford doin' here? He's...
- What?

417
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,275
A medical student.
He's not like the rest of us.

418
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,910
Could be useful to have someone
that could bandage heads.

419
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,560
I'm worried about
the direction we're takin'.

420
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,156
Direction?! What magazines
<i>you</i> been readin', yeh tosser?

421
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,914
Look, with Joey and me,
we can touch greatness.

422
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,791
So if you want to be part of it, take in
the tea, and I'll bring in the Jaffa Cakes.

423
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,112
- It's the fuckin' Addams Family!
- The Addams Family!

424
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,874
Hold on, girls.
I think I've got a ladder in me tights.

425
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,520
Imelda! Come on!

426
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,913
Who the fuck will be lookin' at
your fuckin' thigh, yeh fuckin' eejit!

427
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,558
- Look at the size of that fuckin' doorknob!
- Fuckin' <i>huge!</i>

428
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,270
I hope some o' these fuckin' fellas
are gonna be rides.

429
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,479
- Are you sure this is the right place?
- I've never been here before!

430
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,917
- Who told yeh? It was Jimmy, was it?
- Fuck, I don't know.

431
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,593
Um... sorry. We were lookin' for a band.

432
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,071
Oh! That's my boy Joey's.
They're out the back.

433
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,750
Joey says no rehearsals till you get
friendly with your instruments.

434
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,594
- Friendly with mine already.
- Shut up, Declan.

435
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,674
Deco. If I'm gonna front the band,
I like the sound o' Deco.

436
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,356
Deco the bus conductor.
Is that top Deco or bottom Deco?

437
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,829
The only bollixin' thing that's important
is what this band's called.

438
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,877
Joey knows. Tell them.

439
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,911
We are...

440
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,275
We are...

441
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,879
At the end of the garden
you'll find a ladder.

442
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,599
- A ladder?
- Yes.

443
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,195
- Right. Thank you.
- You're welcome, girls.

444
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,832
- What are yeh gettin' us into, Bernie?
- Fuck off, Natalie! We've come this far!

445
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,480

446
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,597
Over the top! Over the top!

447
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,191
I'm not goin' over the fuckin' ladder!
<i>You're</i> over the fuckin' ladder!

448
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,391
You know 'em. You go.

450
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,559
- The Commitments?
- The Commitments?

451
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,751
It's a "The".

452
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,440
How do you spell it?

453
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,795
T-H-E.

454
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,076
It's very good. It's a statement.

455
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,278
- I still like A Flock of Budgies.
- Fuck me!

456
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,512
I just seen Imelda Quirke's arse

457
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,153

00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,555

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,030

- Dirty bastard!

474
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,115
I said the rhythm of soul

475
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,034

00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,120
Soul is the rhythm of sex.
Rhythm of the factory, too.

Sex and the factory.

Not much rhythm in guttin' fish!

Soul is the music that people understand.
It's basic and it's simple.

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,353
Mr Rabbitte, you've been collecting
unemployment benefit for two years.

667
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,591
Are you telling me you can't get a job?

668
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,718
We're a Third World country.
What can yeh do?

669
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,836
- Jimmy! Howayeh?
- Dean! Didn't know you were on the dole.

670
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,596
- Three months now. How about yourself?
- Lost count. Yeh know how it is.

671
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,593
- See you at Joey's. Tuesday, is it?
- Yeah, Tuesday.

672
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,319
See yeh there.

673
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,757
Jimmy! It feels much better
bein' an unemployed musician

674
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,309
than an unemployed pipe fitter!

675
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,076
Check that horn.

676
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,719
You?

677
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,592
Joey The Lips.

678
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,914
This is an all-star album. Very rare.

679
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,834
I'll get a pen, and then
I can autograph it for yis.

680
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,314
He's full of it.

681
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,279
Look, that's Joey there,
next to Otis Redding.

682
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,034
That could be anybody.
All yeh can see is the trumpet.

683
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,715
Look at this, then. "Trumpet, J Fagan."

684
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,918
- Ah, it's a very common name.
- Not in Detroit.

685
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,875
He's played with all the
greats, then? Your Joey?

686
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,670
Oh, yes, indeed.
He was in America for years!

687
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,673
But I'll tell you something that
nobody knows about my Joey.

688
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,676
Wherever he went, or wherever he played,

689
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,434
he <i>always</i> sent me a postcard.

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,433

- I have to. The stairs would kill him.

700
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,480
- Hello, Mrs McGloughlin. Is Bernie in?
- She is. Come on in, will yeh?

701
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,552
Close that door.

- Howyeh, Bernie.
- Howayeh, Jimmy?

703
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,679
If Jimmy wants tea,
you've to make it yourself.

704
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,831
Oh, I'm not bothered, thanks.

705
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,954
Move that washing

706
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,040
Bernie, you've been missin' rehearsals.

707
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,433
You can see why! Me ma can't work -
she's about to drop another one.

708
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,831
Me da's in the fuckin' hospital.
I'm the only one bringin' any money in.

709
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,276
- It's tough, I know, but...
- What?

710
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,195
It's hard when only two
backup singers show up.

711
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,840
You're not dumpin' <i>me.</i>
I brought in the other two.

712
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,912
Or is that why yeh fuckin' asked me?

713
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,595
You've got the best voice

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,798

Look at the bloody mess yeh made!

717
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,511
Look, Jimmy, I'll catch up.
I need this band more than any of us.

718
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,715
I need somethin' to look forward to.

719
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,632
A lot o' work.

720
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,716
If you didn't do it for God,
who would you do it for?

721
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,158
- Steven!
- Jimmy. Father Molloy will be here soon.

722
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,640
- Great sound, wha'?
- Yeah.

723
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,475
I wish my granny had
one of these we could borrow.

- They nicked it from Marvin Gaye.

One of sixteen vestal virgins leaving
for the coast. What's that mean?

734
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,520
I never understood that, either.

735
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,193
It's a very peculiar lyric.

736
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,269
Howayeh, Father?
Did you talk to the committee?

737
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,829
I have, and they've agreed in principle.

738
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,197
It would have to be the 28th
because Danny, our bingo caller,

739
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,000
is going into hospital to have
a tap put in his kidneys.

740
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,480

- Lads, it's a free country.
- But he's old and he's ugly.

You're young and you're uglier.

00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,354
You'd get off with Joan Collins
