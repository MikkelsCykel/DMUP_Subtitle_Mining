1
00:03:22,423 --> 00:03:25,128
Fuck you!

2
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,765
Oh no, not now.
Fuck!

3
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:06,264
APACHE LEAP

4
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,263
U TURN OK

5
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:03,405
I got a fire in here.

6
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:25,059
Who cut off my music?

7
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:32,694
You cut my music off.

8
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:36,732
Are you Harlin?
Is Harlin around?

9
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:40,279
I doubt it. He's dead.

10
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:43,374
- Are you the owner?
- Yes.

11
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:48,751
- Why do you call it "Harlin's"?
- Because Harlin used to own it.

12
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:54,587
Could you take a look at my car?
I think the radiator hose is bust.

13
00:05:56,766 --> 00:06:01,560
It's going to be a hot one today.
Then again, it might not be.

14
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,728
You can't ever tell. When it's hot,
I don't even like to get out of bed.

15
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:08,773
- Nor when it's cold.
- Harlin...

16
00:06:08,947 --> 00:06:13,775
- Darrell.
- I think the radiator hose is bust.

17
00:06:15,663 --> 00:06:20,789
- Your radiator hose is busted.
- I know. What did I just tell you?

18
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:24,294
If you know so much,
fix it yourself.

19
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:29,840
If I could, I wouldn't be here.
Fix it, or I'll go someplace else.

20
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:35,138
Someplace else?
That's 50 miles from here.

21
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,222
The station downtown
closed some three years ago.

22
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,184
Okay. Can you fix it or not?

23
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:47,364
- Yeah, I can.
- Great.

24
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:52,326
I'll see if I have a hose
like that one. It'll take some time.

25
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:56,542
- How much time?
- I don't know. Time.

26
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,542
- What time is it now?
- 10:20.

27
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:03,171
Arizona...

28
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:08,467
- It must be 90 already.
- 92.

29
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,769
- What happened to your hand?
- An accident.

30
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:18,222
You've got to be more careful.
Hands is important.

31
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:22,400
I don't know if you can still
see it, but when I was a kid...

32
00:07:22,573 --> 00:07:26,523
Interesting...
Where can I get something to drink?

33
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:30,286
There's a diner. It ain't much.

34
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:33,292
Us simple folk like it.

35
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:38,253
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Just be real careful with it.

36
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:46,384
- It's just a car.
- It's a '64 Mustang Convertible.

37
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:52,645
That's the reason why you live here
and I'm just passing through.

38
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:09,706
- I'll just get some things out.
- Knock yourself out.

39
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:09,649
Just like a town,
only uglier.

40
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:41,894
- Hey, you there.
- You want something, old man?

41
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:47,357
Run over to the corner there
to that machine and get me a pop.

42
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:52,157
- You can't do that yourself?
- Hell no, I'm blind.

43
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:55,862
- I lost my eyes in Vietnam.
- Sorry.

44
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,537
Don't be so sorry. Just get me
a pop before I die of thirst.

45
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:11,052
- Got change?
- You want a blind veteran's change?

46
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:14,558
What the hell has the world come to?

47
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:19,889
Get me a Dr. Pepper.
Cola's nothing but flavoured water.

48
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:25,692
And open it. I can't.
If you do it, that's a good boy.

49
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:28,737
Unbelievable. Fucking...

50
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:35,331
That's for Mother Earth.
I'm about 50% Indian.

51
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:39,666
- Congratulations.
- Here's to all our relations.

52
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,550
- You want some?
- I'll pass.

53
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:48,055
The dog looks sick.

54
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:53,433
That's because he's dead.
I hope you wasn't patting him...

55
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:57,474
- What do you want with a dead dog?
- He's only just dead.

56
00:10:57,652 --> 00:11:02,232
What was I to do? Me and Jesse
have been pals since the war.

57
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:05,943
Come on, Jesse.

58
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:10,914
See you later, unless
I come across something worse.

59
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,302
- Need a hand, beautiful?
- I'm just going to my car.

60
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:30,348
- That's right on my way.
- Mother warned me about strangers.

61
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:37,692
I'm Bobby. Now we're not strangers.
See how easy that was, beautiful?

62
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:42,029
- Do you have to call me that?
- I don't know your name.

63
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:46,154
- Maybe I don't want you to.
- Then why did you stop walking?

64
00:11:47,918 --> 00:11:51,371
- You're full of yourself.
- I like that about me.

65
00:11:51,547 --> 00:11:56,673
- It's Grace.
- Grace, can I carry your package?

66
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:05,511
- Can you manage? Shall I take that?
- No, it's no trouble.

67
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:10,019
- What happened to your hand?
- An accident.

68
00:12:10,193 --> 00:12:15,533
You should be more careful.
It's just drapes and curtain rods.

69
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:22,202
I got so tired of the old ones.
My mother made them.

70
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:27,831
I just knew I had to have these.
Ever felt you had to have something?

71
00:12:28,006 --> 00:12:32,715
- Yes, I have.
- This is it.

72
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:37,342
- Thank you, Bobby.
- You're welcome, Grace.

73
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:43,556
- You're not from around here.
- No, my car overheated up the road.

74
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:49,403
Lucky you weren't in the desert.
A day like today, you'd be dead.

75
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,160
When are you leaving?

76
00:12:57,331 --> 00:13:01,376
Not until I get my car back.

77
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:04,996
And here I made you
all hot and sweaty.

78
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:12,431
- Morning, Grace.
- Morning, Sheriff.

79
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:18,104
- Got my drapes.
- You got yourself a helper, too.

80
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:21,226
Morning, Sheriff.

81
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:31,995
- Nice to meet you, son.
- Same to you, Sheriff.

82
00:13:37,002 --> 00:13:41,629
I could use some help
getting these boxes in the house.

83
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:46,627
You could shower.
Get something cool to drink.

84
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,807
You're still lucky.

85
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:06,236
- Where are you coming from?
- All over. Detroit.

86
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,488
Chicago, Miami. I have some
unfinished business in Las Vegas.

87
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:16,958
- What is it you do?
- Whatever pays best. Bartending.

88
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:19,669
Used to teach tennis.

89
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,680
Used to play some competitively.

90
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,472
I never played tennis.

91
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:12,732
<i>- I'm sick of your bullshit.
- Easy, easy.</i>

92
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:17,779
<i>- Bobby, I want my money.
- You got that?</i>

93
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:23,193
<i>You'll get your money.
You don't have to do this.</i>

94
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:26,909
<i>You have two weeks, asshole.
Take two for now.</i>

95
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:34,837
<i>Finger one.</i>

96
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:47,396
<i>Finger two.</i>

97
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,356
- Some more lemonade?
- That would be great.

98
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:34,445
- What do you do, anyway?
- A little of this, little of that.

99
00:16:34,622 --> 00:16:38,702
- Mostly I tell fortunes.
- Where did you learn that?

100
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:43,329
From my father.

101
00:16:46,468 --> 00:16:49,802
Come here.

102
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:11,821
Sit down.

103
00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:21,539
There's something in your past...

104
00:17:21,717 --> 00:17:26,261
Something... There's a pain.

105
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:35,932
There's something you want badly.
It seems far away to you right now.

106
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:43,571
But you're determined.

107
00:17:43,742 --> 00:17:46,660
And you'll do what you must
to get it.

108
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:54,118
- You can tell all that by my face?
- All faces tell me the same.

109
00:17:54,922 --> 00:18:00,593
Everybody has a past. They have
pain and something they want.

110
00:18:02,764 --> 00:18:08,601
- What is it you want?
- The same thing you do.

111
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:18,607
Really?
I want to hang drapes.

112
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:36,468
Can you hold me?

113
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,726
Tighter. I won't break.

114
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:57,866
There. Lift me down.

115
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:07,960
You can put me down now.
I'm safe.

116
00:19:14,846 --> 00:19:18,512
I'm tired of hanging drapes.

117
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:25,392
- Now what should we do?
- I got an idea.

118
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:31,026
What would that be?

119
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:44,207
- All right, no more games.
- What game do you want to play?

120
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,880
You carry my parcels
and we go to bed?

121
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:54,055
- I'm going back to town.
- I like to know about a man first.

122
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:58,638
- Find out what he's made of.
- Thanks for the lemonade.

123
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,897
- You didn't answer me.
- You're still playing.

124
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:06,901
What is it you want?

125
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:40,265
Grace!

126
00:20:40,445 --> 00:20:43,944
Jake...
I thought you were in Phoenix.

127
00:20:44,115 --> 00:20:47,484
Who the hell is this?

128
00:20:47,661 --> 00:20:52,289
- Who in the hell are you?
- Her husband.

129
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:59,747
Who are you? It had better be good,
or I'll break you in half.

130
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:04,718
I was just giving your wife
a hand with the drapes.

131
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,175
- It didn't look like that.
- That's all.

132
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:12,813
- A lot that means.
- Grace, tell him.

133
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:21,738
I suppose he just wandered up here?
I should paddle your ass raw!

134
00:21:21,908 --> 00:21:27,414
You sucker me up here so the two
of us can beat each other over you?

135
00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:31,667
Forget it.

136
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:38,633
You don't just walk in and walk out.

137
00:21:38,803 --> 00:21:43,346
- You broke my nose!
- It ain't broke.

138
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:46,803
Get going, pipsqueak.

139
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:37,276
- What the fuck do you want?
- Hop in. You'll die in this heat.

140
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:43,493
You're not still upset over that
little love tap, are you? Get in.

141
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:56,884
- What happened to your hand?
- An accident.

142
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:00,643
- You've got to be...
- More careful. I know.

143
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:04,858
I'm Jake McKenna.

144
00:23:05,027 --> 00:23:11,280
- Bobby Cooper.
- What brings you to Superior?

145
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:16,113
- Car overheated.
- Is Darrell taking care of you?

146
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:22,827
- He's dumb as a sack of hammers.
- Yes, he sure is a character.

147
00:23:24,132 --> 00:23:28,676
- Where are you headed?
- California.

148
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:32,891
- Do you live there?
- A man wants me to sail his boat.

149
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:38,136
You're a sailor-man?
That would be the life.

150
00:23:38,315 --> 00:23:41,685
Just get on a boat and sail away.

151
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:47,318
- A man could disappear like that.
- If I'd known she was married...

152
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:54,492
It wouldn't have made a difference.
You're a man without scruples.

153
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,953
I can smell it on you.

154
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:04,178
Yeah, that's the sweat of a man that
hasn't an honest bone in his body.

155
00:24:05,971 --> 00:24:12,509
Don't be offended. A man without
ethics is a free man. I envy you.

156
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:17,979
A woman with her looks and a man
my age, what was I to expect?

157
00:24:18,151 --> 00:24:22,364
Women... Can't live with them,
can't live without them.

158
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:27,574
Can't live with them,
can't shoot them.

159
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:35,537
I bet she had you hard as a rock,
wiggling her ass in your face.

160
00:24:35,714 --> 00:24:41,551
You wanted to pull her pants down
and hog her out, and then I bust in.

161
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,807
You got a temper. I bet
you just wanted to snap her neck.

162
00:24:47,978 --> 00:24:52,107
I bet you just wanted to kill her.

163
00:24:53,401 --> 00:24:58,111
Would you? Would you kill her?

164
00:25:01,243 --> 00:25:06,950
- Why would I kill her?
- I'm sick of her little games.

165
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:11,586
You could do it and drift away
on that boat without being noticed.

166
00:25:11,755 --> 00:25:19,420
I'd love to split the $50,000 life
insurance policy with her murderer.

167
00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:23,809
I've done some things,
but I'm not a murderer.

168
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:28,433
How do you know
if you've never tried?

169
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,019
You're joking, right?

170
00:25:37,034 --> 00:25:42,539
That's right.
It's nothing but a joke.

171
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,827
Enjoy your stay, lad.

172
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:19,157
<i>- You got a soda?
- Habla slowly.</i>

173
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:23,745
- A cold soda.
- Something to eat.

174
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:27,338
No, no. Drink.

175
00:26:27,508 --> 00:26:32,420
Keep it in you and nobody gets hurt.
The same goes for you, punk.

176
00:26:32,597 --> 00:26:35,932
Give me the money.

177
00:26:48,324 --> 00:26:53,236
That's it? Lady, I've got kids
to put through school.

178
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:57,328
What have you got, pal?

179
00:27:01,715 --> 00:27:07,054
Beautiful. You're getting tasty.
Give me the pack.

180
00:27:08,764 --> 00:27:12,631
- It's just books.
- I'm a reader. Toss it.

181
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:17,272
- It's personal family things.
- Give me the bag.

182
00:27:17,441 --> 00:27:20,525
- No.
- No?

183
00:27:20,694 --> 00:27:26,152
- This is no good. Come on.
- No?

184
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:29,945
He doesn't want to give me the bag.

185
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:34,583
- He doesn't have to.
- Come on!

186
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,547
- Not my wedding ring!
- Extra never hurt.

187
00:28:00,782 --> 00:28:03,652
Murderer!

188
00:28:47,502 --> 00:28:53,671
<i>Señor,  you're hurt.
I'll call the police.</i>

189
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:57,675
No. No police.

190
00:28:57,847 --> 00:29:03,434
- Here. No police.
- $100, no police?

191
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:09,692
No police.

192
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,387
- What happened to your face?
- I had an accident.

193
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,603
Another accident?
You've got to be more careful.

194
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:45,692
What the hell happened to my car?

195
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:58,740
I had to change your bottom hose
too, but it runs like a dream now.

196
00:30:01,127 --> 00:30:05,707
- How much?
- Let's see...

197
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:11,424
You got parts and labour.
Let's just call it... $150.

198
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:16,143
- How much?
- 150.

199
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:21,354
- To replace a radiator hose?
- A hose in a 1964 Mustang.

200
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:24,812
It's a Ford, not a Ferrari!

201
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:29,781
It's not just a Ford.
It's a 1964 Mustang.

202
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:33,998
- What's that got to do with it?
- I don't know.

203
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,377
But it's the reason I'm living here,
and you're just passing through.

204
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,962
You owe me $150.

205
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,557
I just got rolled.

206
00:30:51,728 --> 00:30:58,692
Get out your American Express
gold card and call the guy on TV...

207
00:30:58,861 --> 00:31:04,021
- I don't have a credit card.
- Then you'll have to work this off.

208
00:31:05,452 --> 00:31:10,613
I've got a Movado. It's worth
$7,800. You could sell it for that.

209
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:19,670
- I can't see no numbers.
- That's why it's expensive!

210
00:31:19,843 --> 00:31:21,919
Look at the gold.

211
00:31:22,096 --> 00:31:26,011
No day, no dates. Far as I can tell,
this ain't worth a duck's fart.

212
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:34,643
I got this for $3.75. It's got lots
of doodads. I'll stick with that.

213
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:37,904
You son of a bitch!

214
00:31:38,073 --> 00:31:43,031
- My lawyer will shut you down.
- No credit cards, but a lawyer?

215
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:48,875
Sweet talk me all you want to,
but didn't you read this sign?

216
00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:54,965
- What sign? I want my car.
- I want my $150.

217
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:11,902
<i>- What's the line on Dallas?
- You deadbeat. Lose my number!</i>

218
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,688
<i>- Mike, you...
- Mike who?</i>

219
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:22,913
Cici, it's Bobby. I know
it's been a while, but I'm in a jam.

220
00:32:23,082 --> 00:32:26,368
<i>- You need money?
- $150.</i>

221
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:32,334
<i>No, you stole my CDs. Or was it
my ex-roommate, who you fucked?</i>

222
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:36,258
Okay, where's my Mr. Coffee?
Cici?

223
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:41,346
<i>- Rosarita. Bobby.
- Fuck you!</i>

224
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:50,612
<i>- Mom, it's Bobby. Your son.
- He's dead.</i>

225
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,447
<i>- No, I'm not dead.
- You are to me.</i>

226
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:02,787
Hallo? Mr. Arkady,
this is deadbeat Cooper calling.

227
00:33:04,004 --> 00:33:07,622
The motherfucker's calling collect.

228
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:14,803
Bobby, I expected to be seeing you,
not talking to you over the phone.

229
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:22,271
What a day I've had. This will sound
like a highly improbable story.

230
00:33:22,442 --> 00:33:29,987
I had the money. I'm on my way
to Vegas, and my car breaks down.

231
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:39,413
I go into this store to get some
food, and the place gets robbed.

232
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:45,008
- And the robber gets your money?
- There were two, and they got shot.

233
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:48,012
The old lady shot them.

234
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:55,393
<i>She kills them, and the money
in the bag gets shredded to pieces.</i>

235
00:33:55,563 --> 00:34:01,021
What are the odds?
So I thought maybe you could...

236
00:34:01,194 --> 00:34:09,025
Can't you wire me $150?
I'd pay it back with the rest.

237
00:34:09,203 --> 00:34:13,831
<i>- Which you don't have.
- I can sell my car in Vegas.</i>

238
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,370
Where are you?

239
00:34:18,797 --> 00:34:23,425
In this little shithole
200 miles east of Phoenix.

240
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:26,929
<i>Superior.</i>

241
00:34:30,603 --> 00:34:36,523
- Couldn't you send it...
- No! Listen to me, you punk!

242
00:34:36,693 --> 00:34:41,237
I don't care if you got hit by a
truck and run over by a steamroller.

243
00:34:41,407 --> 00:34:48,075
You owe me $13,000
and I want it on my desk tomorrow!

244
00:34:48,248 --> 00:34:50,954
<i>Or I'll show you what bad luck is!</i>

245
00:34:51,127 --> 00:34:54,211
- You understand?
- Fuck you too!

246
00:34:54,380 --> 00:35:00,086
- What did you say?
- No. I'm sorry.

247
00:35:00,262 --> 00:35:06,099
- There's just been so much stress.
- You've owed me for four weeks.

248
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:09,768
<i>Now you want another week.
That's five weeks.</i>

249
00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:14,567
That's also five fingers,
because it's a finger a week!

250
00:35:14,736 --> 00:35:17,940
<i>Come tomorrow and be nice.</i>

251
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:22,778
<i>And maybe I don't take
the other three fingers...</i>

252
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:36,459
Get your ass down to Superior.
This deadbeat won't see tomorrow.

253
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:07,503
You get three heads in a row,
odds are the next one will be tails.

254
00:36:08,173 --> 00:36:12,670
Shut up and drink your coffee,
and stop flipping that damn quarter.

255
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:25,643
- Can I get you something?
- A beer. A Beck's.

256
00:36:25,818 --> 00:36:30,362
- Ain't got Beck's. A-1, Coor's?
- Heineken?

257
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:35,491
- No. We've got Miller.
- Boyd thinks the odds are 50-50.

258
00:36:35,663 --> 00:36:40,040
- "Genuine Draft"?
- No, just regular plain old Miller.

259
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:44,077
You can fucking take it or leave it.

260
00:36:44,256 --> 00:36:47,708
I'll fucking take it.

261
00:36:48,261 --> 00:36:54,050
- Flo. A cheeseburger bleeding.
- I'll be right back with that beer.

262
00:36:54,226 --> 00:36:59,897
And a waitress named Flo...
Christ!

263
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:09,029
- He doesn't know statistics.
- What are you? A rocket scientist?

264
00:37:09,702 --> 00:37:13,072
Fucking cat.

265
00:37:13,247 --> 00:37:16,083
Got a quarter for the juke?

266
00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:20,415
I want to play a song.
Got a quarter?

267
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:25,542
- What happened to your hand?
- I cut myself shaving.

268
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,632
- Yes, I've got to be more careful.
- Any requests?

269
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:36,848
- All country shit sounds the same.
- How about I pick one out for you?

270
00:37:44,534 --> 00:37:50,537
Don't you just love Patsy Cline? Why
doesn't she put out more records?

271
00:37:52,376 --> 00:37:57,963
- Because she's dead.
- That's sad.

272
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:05,343
- Don't that make you sad?
- I've had time to get over it.

273
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:10,807
You ain't from around here, right?
Where are you from?

274
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:15,477
- Oz.
- No, you ain't from Oz!

275
00:38:15,652 --> 00:38:19,817
- Oz is from that movie.
- You are too quick for me.

276
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:25,827
No! I'm seeing,
but I'm not believing.

277
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:31,201
What are you doing with my girl?

278
00:38:32,129 --> 00:38:35,416
I asked you a question.

279
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:40,753
- Toby, we were just talking.
- Shut up. Get back to our table.

280
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:45,344
Don't make me ask you again.
What are you doing with my girl?

281
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:49,981
- I wasn't doing anything.
- That's not how it looked to me.

282
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:55,109
- You tried to make time with her.
- Is everyone in this town on drugs?

283
00:38:55,281 --> 00:38:59,231
- I just asked him for a quarter.
- Shut your mouth.

284
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:06,458
We've got business to take care of.
And I ain't never taken no drugs.

285
00:39:06,628 --> 00:39:11,206
Maybe you should. I wasn't
trying to make time with your girl.

286
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:14,550
I'm calling you out.

287
00:39:16,222 --> 00:39:19,223
You want to fight over her?

288
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:25,561
You don't know who I am.
The name's Toby N. Tucker.

289
00:39:25,732 --> 00:39:29,149
People call me TNT.

290
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:34,030
- You know why?
- They're not very imaginative?

291
00:39:34,201 --> 00:39:38,412
Because I'm just like dynamite.
When I go off, somebody gets hurt!

292
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,915
Fine.
I tried to make time with your girl.

293
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:47,079
Now I'm terrified, and I've learned
my lesson, and you can go away.

294
00:39:47,257 --> 00:39:51,587
- Jesus Christ.
- Stand up.

295
00:39:51,763 --> 00:39:57,005
- Or I'll beat you where you sit?
- Finish your pop and leave him.

296
00:39:57,185 --> 00:40:02,227
Don't you never mind, Flo.
This will be over real quick.

297
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:07,279
One Touch Toby.
Come on, pussy.

298
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:18,829
You're real lucky this time.
But I'm going to see this through.

299
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:24,251
I think I'll make you walk home.

300
00:40:28,471 --> 00:40:34,059
- What was that all about?
- Toby thinks everyone wants Jenny.

301
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:38,308
It's Jenny who wants every man
she sees.

302
00:40:38,482 --> 00:40:43,026
- I can't open off-sale for you.
- It's the desert.

303
00:40:43,196 --> 00:40:48,238
It makes people go bonkers.

304
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:54,081
- I'll help myself to some coffee.
- You be careful now.

305
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:03,005
- Son of a bitch!
- Look what you've done.

306
00:41:03,178 --> 00:41:07,507
- I burned my gun hand.
- It's all red.

307
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:11,515
I'll put butter on it later.

308
00:41:13,522 --> 00:41:16,690
Joe, get a mop and clean up.

309
00:41:18,486 --> 00:41:24,858
Shasta, don't scare that nice man.
Sorry about that, sugar.

310
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:29,533
Let's see. $3.25.

311
00:41:36,882 --> 00:41:40,217
Have a nice day.

312
00:41:40,387 --> 00:41:43,554
I'll sure try.

313
00:41:54,361 --> 00:41:58,406
Goddamn it!

314
00:41:59,242 --> 00:42:03,785
Why?
Get me out of this fucking town.

315
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:15,088
McKENNA REALTY

316
00:42:18,138 --> 00:42:21,804
<i>Jake's the name, 
real estate's my game.</i>

317
00:43:03,064 --> 00:43:03,690
What can I do for you, lad?

318
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:07,059
What can I do for you, lad?

319
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:11,068
- I hoped we could talk.
- About what?

320
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:17,742
About your wife. About your
$50,000 life insurance policy.

321
00:43:20,084 --> 00:43:26,254
- You'd split it with her murderer.
- I think the heat's getting to you.

322
00:43:26,425 --> 00:43:29,841
You brought it up.

323
00:43:30,012 --> 00:43:35,256
- I don't always mean what I say.
- You meant it.

324
00:43:35,435 --> 00:43:41,190
You're a slimy bastard who'd
have his wife killed to get rich.

325
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:46,234
- What does that make you?
- The slimy bastard that'll do it.

326
00:43:46,406 --> 00:43:51,994
You're a jealous man. If you can't
have Grace to yourself...

327
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:55,864
You're not the sharing kind.

328
00:43:57,377 --> 00:44:02,086
I have what you call
a love-hate relationship with Grace.

329
00:44:02,257 --> 00:44:06,386
- You love her, but you hate her.
- No, I hate loving her.

330
00:44:06,554 --> 00:44:10,303
I hate having to tolerate
the little games she plays.

331
00:44:10,475 --> 00:44:15,387
Like fucking half this town behind
my back and laughing at me. Bitch!

332
00:44:15,564 --> 00:44:22,315
She wants me to hit her. She
likes it. She likes to torture me.

333
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:31,286
But after all...
She's my family.

334
00:44:37,172 --> 00:44:42,512
She's my little girl.
My baby.

335
00:44:44,972 --> 00:44:52,602
I couldn't stand to watch her
as she sucks her last breath.

336
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:59,024
No. Not me.

337
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:06,784
But you...
You've got a killing in you.

338
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:15,924
Let's say I want the bitch dead.

339
00:45:16,092 --> 00:45:20,553
- What do you want?
- How do you put a price on murder?

340
00:45:20,722 --> 00:45:28,020
I put it at $50,000
minus your cut, of course. Which is?

341
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:36,442
- 20,000.
- I don't have that kind of money.

342
00:45:36,616 --> 00:45:41,658
- Getting the insurance takes time.
- How much can you get?

343
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:46,124
Maybe 10,000.

344
00:45:46,293 --> 00:45:50,244
- I need 13,000.
- That's a bit much.

345
00:45:50,423 --> 00:45:54,670
We're not talking about buying
a car, but about killing your wife.

346
00:45:54,844 --> 00:45:57,846
It's 13,000 or it's nothing.

347
00:46:13,074 --> 00:46:16,823
You drive a hard bargain.

348
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:22,533
But I had a feeling you were my boy
when I first met you.

349
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:27,705
It looks like
we've got ourselves a contract.

350
00:46:27,882 --> 00:46:30,504
Do we shake hands?

351
00:46:30,678 --> 00:46:35,719
If you can't trust the man
you've hired to kill your wife...

352
00:46:35,891 --> 00:46:40,270
It's got to look like an accident.

353
00:46:40,439 --> 00:46:43,558
If it don't, it's no good.

354
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:50,069
I'll be a penniless murder suspect
while you're living it up somewhere.

355
00:46:50,242 --> 00:46:54,026
How do you want it?

356
00:46:54,205 --> 00:47:00,207
- It can't be done at the house.
- I want some money up front.

357
00:47:00,378 --> 00:47:08,553
Why don't I buy you a plane ticket
while I'm at it? I know you.

358
00:47:11,307 --> 00:47:13,596
Listen...

359
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:19,011
<i>You go to the house to see her.
Tell her you had to see her.</i>

360
00:47:19,191 --> 00:47:25,941
<i>You sweet-talk the woman. A young
buck like you must be good at that.</i>

361
00:47:26,116 --> 00:47:31,537
<i>Then shift the conversation.
Talk about the Jeep. She loves that.</i>

362
00:47:31,705 --> 00:47:34,328
Maybe the only thing she does love.

363
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:39,003
<i>She'll take you for a ride out
in the desert, someplace quiet.</i>

364
00:47:39,173 --> 00:47:43,336
<i>Riding through the red rocks
and mesas. She loves it out there.</i>

365
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:46,133
So do I. We've got that in common.

366
00:47:46,305 --> 00:47:52,510
<i>There won't be anyone around
but you and some prairie dogs.</i>

367
00:47:54,147 --> 00:48:00,234
<i>And then... sweet-talk her.
It makes no difference to me.</i>

368
00:48:00,405 --> 00:48:03,988
<i>Put her at ease, 
and then...</i>

369
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:07,279
...do it!

370
00:48:14,296 --> 00:48:18,211
- You could leave him.
- It's not that easy.

371
00:48:20,011 --> 00:48:24,306
- Walk away.
- Maybe you can take chances.

372
00:48:24,474 --> 00:48:29,184
You can wander wherever
you please. I can't.

373
00:48:34,194 --> 00:48:37,230
I don't want to be alone.

374
00:48:43,538 --> 00:48:47,322
I wish I was a bird.

375
00:48:50,045 --> 00:48:57,045
Some of the old Indians thought
you could change into animals.

376
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:02,677
I wish I could. If I was a bird,
I'd fly to Florida.

377
00:49:02,851 --> 00:49:05,603
Disneyworld.

378
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:12,232
I've always wanted to go there.

379
00:49:12,404 --> 00:49:15,654
Then I'll fly to New York, maybe.

380
00:49:17,368 --> 00:49:22,576
Then I'd fly to St. Louis
and all over Texas.

381
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:27,290
Then I'll fly to California.

382
00:49:29,173 --> 00:49:32,923
Then I guess I would've seen it all.

383
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:38,385
Then I could die.

384
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:49,774
They say you don't feel anything.

385
00:49:49,947 --> 00:49:54,942
That the shock kills you
before you hit the ground.

386
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:05,913
I've always imagined
it's just like flying.

387
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:41,704
I bet, right now, you don't know
if you want to kill me...

388
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:48,341
...or fuck me.

389
00:51:47,623 --> 00:51:51,574
Stop! I can't!

390
00:51:54,548 --> 00:51:58,047
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

391
00:51:58,218 --> 00:52:01,422
Doesn't feel like nothing.

392
00:52:01,598 --> 00:52:05,299
Get out of town quick, Bobby.

393
00:52:11,526 --> 00:52:16,438
Don't do this to me. I've been
fucked over by too many women.

394
00:52:16,615 --> 00:52:19,782
You're the queen of hot and cold.

395
00:52:19,952 --> 00:52:26,157
- It's such a mess with Jake.
- I know all about being in a mess.

396
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:39,254
Jake was with my mom.

397
00:52:39,432 --> 00:52:42,469
After my real father died.

398
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,940
He used to call me
his "little half-breed".

399
00:52:53,115 --> 00:53:00,328
He kept my mom on the side.
He had a wife someplace else.

400
00:53:00,499 --> 00:53:03,998
<i>He'd control me.</i>

401
00:53:04,169 --> 00:53:07,337
<i>You look so pretty.</i>

402
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:16,348
<i>Put your arms around me.</i>

403
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:22,974
<i>- Why?
- Don't fuck around like your mama.</i>

404
00:53:24,526 --> 00:53:30,151
He was raping me the whole time.
For years.

405
00:53:30,324 --> 00:53:33,741
My mom...

406
00:53:35,747 --> 00:53:40,374
It tore her up 'cause she couldn't
do nothing about it.

407
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,391
She became an alcoholic.

408
00:53:56,771 --> 00:54:00,852
They found my mama down here.

409
00:54:03,237 --> 00:54:07,449
At the bottom of Apache Leap.

410
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:15,911
Virgil, Sheriff Potter, said
she was drunk and went insane.

411
00:54:16,085 --> 00:54:21,081
I'd never believe
she ran off that cliff by accident.

412
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:27,597
She was like me.
She just wanted to fly away.

413
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:35,644
I'm so sorry.

414
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:41,017
What are you going to? Life, right?

415
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:48,244
- Have you ever been to California?
- Yes.

416
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:55,784
- Is it pretty?
- It's another world.

417
00:54:59,176 --> 00:55:01,928
It's beautiful beaches
and blue water.

418
00:55:05,016 --> 00:55:08,849
Clear sky,
as far as the eye can see.

419
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:14,645
Take me with you.
I won't hang on you.

420
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:18,354
You can dump me there.
I just want to leave.

421
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:24,321
I can't leave before I get hold
of the $150 for that crazy mechanic.

422
00:55:24,497 --> 00:55:29,325
- Darrell? He and Jake...
- Do you have money?

423
00:55:29,503 --> 00:55:33,002
Jake only gives me $20 at a time.

424
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:40,009
If you could get money,
I could get us out of here.

425
00:55:43,685 --> 00:55:48,347
- There's money. A lot.
- Where?

426
00:55:48,524 --> 00:55:55,406
Jake hides it in a safe.

427
00:55:56,199 --> 00:56:01,539
In the bedroom floor. My mom said
there was more than $100,000 there.

428
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:07,333
- In cash?
- There's nothing else with Jake.

429
00:56:07,504 --> 00:56:12,214
He sits there, he laughs,
he talks to himself and counts it.

430
00:56:12,385 --> 00:56:16,762
$100,000... son of a bitch.

431
00:56:18,517 --> 00:56:22,515
What do you mean?

432
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:30,235
- We need the combination.
- It takes a key.

433
00:56:30,406 --> 00:56:33,193
He keeps it on him all the time.

434
00:56:36,746 --> 00:56:41,574
So it's slapping up against me
when we do it.

435
00:56:41,752 --> 00:56:46,047
Then how do we get it?

436
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:51,419
Kill him.

437
00:56:58,605 --> 00:57:02,769
I can't kill anybody.

438
00:57:02,942 --> 00:57:07,606
It's not like he's a young man.
He had time to live.

439
00:57:07,781 --> 00:57:12,859
It would be quick.
He doesn't even have to feel it.

440
00:57:13,037 --> 00:57:21,829
Do it at night. Come up
behind him when he's asleep.

441
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:25,589
Or when he's pounding me...

442
00:57:26,636 --> 00:57:29,591
Bobby!

443
00:57:29,765 --> 00:57:33,810
I see it.
It's in you. I see death.

444
00:57:33,978 --> 00:57:37,679
It's in your heart.
Do it for me.
