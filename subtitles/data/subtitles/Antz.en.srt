00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,355
All my life, I've lived
and worked in the big city

2
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,671
which, now that I think of it,
is kind of a problem,

3
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,156
since I always feel
uncomfortable around crowds.

4
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,073
I mean it.
I have a fear of enclosed spaces.

5
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,555
Everything makes me feel trapped.

6
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,599
I tell myself there's gotta be
something better out there.

7
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,796
But maybe I... I think too much.

8
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,838
I think everything
goes back to the fact...

9
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,474
that I had a very anxious childhood.

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,472
My mother never had time for me.

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,229
When you're the middle child
in a family of five million,

12
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,676
you don't get any attention.
How is it possible?

13
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,433
And I've had
these abandonment issues.

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,751
My father was basically a drone,
like I've said.

15
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,513
And the guy flew away
when I was a larva.

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,674
And my job, don't get me started,
because it really annoys me.

17
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,355
l-I was not cut out to be a worker,
I'll tell you right now.

18
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,273
l-l-I feel physically inadequate.

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,397
My whole life,
I've never been able to lift...

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,994
more than 10 times
my own body weight.

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,318
And, when you get down to it,
handling dirt is, you know... urgh,

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,039
is not my idea
of a rewarding career.

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,998
It's this whole gung ho,
superorganism thing...

24
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,719
that... that, you know, I can't get.

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,552
I try, but I don't get it.

26
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,394
I mean... I'm supposed
to do everything for the colony.

27
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,074
A-and what about my needs?
What about me?

28
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,994
I've gotta believe
there's someplace better than this.

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,198
Otherwise, I would just curl up
in a larval position and weep.

30
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,636
(Sighs) The whole system
makes me feel...

31
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,711
(Exhales) insignificant.

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,076
(Doctor) Excellent.
You've made a breakthrough.

33
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,391
- I have?
- Yes, Z. You are insignificant.

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,152
I am?

35
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,271
(Chattering)

36
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,476
(Ant) Ground floor.

37
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,276
(Babies crying softly)

38
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,874
- (Cries)
- Uh, worker.

39
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,631
Soldier.

40
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,551
Ooh. (Giggles)

41
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,756
- Uh-oh.
- Worker.

42
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,271
(Cries)

43
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,316
(Ant) Let's try it again.

44
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,150
Firm grip. Swing hard.
Back straight. Concentrate.

45
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,077
Follow through.

46
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,757
(Grunts)

47
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,869
OK. Got to keep a positive attitude.

48
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,713
Even though
I'm utterly insignificant.

49
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,796
I'm-I'm insignificant, um,
but with attitude.

50
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,110
- (Coughs)
- (Woman) Oh, sorry, Z,

51
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,714
- I didn't see ya.
- Great, Azteca.

52
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,354
I'm so meaningless, I'm invisible.

53
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,436
- (Grunts)
- (Laughter)

54
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,391
Now, you're getting it.

55
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,836
After all, it's not about you.

56
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,713
It's about us... the team.

57
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,314
It's about... this.

58
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,754
Uh, a giant hole in the ground?

59
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,469
- OK, people. Are we feeling good?
- (All) Yeah!

60
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,471
- Yeah.
- Great.

61
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,509
Now, R-1734 through Z-7829,
you guys are on wrecking ball.

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,352
- You got it.
- Swell.

63
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,596
- You got it.
- (Ant) All right.

64
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,750
(Enthusiastic shouts)

65
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,308
Now, remember, Azteca,
"Be the ball."

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,279
That's the main thing.
You know, be one with the ball.

67
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,191
Would you cut it out already?

68
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,590
Jeez. I love my work.
And you, well...

69
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,989
You think too much.

70
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,153
Come on, Z. Help us build
a bigger, better colony.

71
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,231
And try to be happy about it.

72
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,276
Sure, you know. I mean, why...

73
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,591
How could I be unhappy being
construction equipment?

74
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,274
- OK, workers, remember.
- Here it comes.

75
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,158
- Be the ball.
- Oh!

76
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,312
(Foreman)
Let the energy flow through you.

77
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,552
G-grin and bear it. This is...
this is for the colony. Oh.

78
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,312
- (All yelling)
- Ow!

79
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,870
T-this is just a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

80
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,952
- Hang on. Here we go.
- Faster. Harder.

81
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,474
Did you know
heights make me nauseous?

82
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,515
No.

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,909
(Ant) This is a ball!

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,434
- (All yelling)
- Hey!

85
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,709
- (Azteca) Oh, Z.
- Yes, yes. I dropped the ball.

86
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,233
(Ant) Workers. They're weak.

87
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,551
They lack discipline.
They lack commitment.

88
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,349
General, I know there's
been a glitch or two,

89
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,716
but everybody is working full tilt,
as it is...

90
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,154
You can't help it, it's your nature.

91
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,390
But in spite of your limitations,

92
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,313
you will finish
this tunnel on schedule.

93
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,197
Come hell or high water.

94
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,193
Anyone who falls behind
will explain why to Colonel Cutter.

95
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,876
And let me assure you, the colonel
is not as understanding as I am.

96
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,757
Dismissed.

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,117
Four more days, Cutter.
Four more days.

98
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,875
Then we can bid farewell
to their kind of incompetence.

99
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,313
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,391
A fresh start.

101
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,358
- Imagine it!
- A strong colony, sir.

102
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,317
A colony we can be proud of.

103
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,675
Yes, but we're not there yet.

104
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,356
We just got word that a termite army
has mobilised against us.

105
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,989
- Against us?
- We'll have to send troops...

106
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,877
to attack their colony.

107
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,269
Attack a termite colony, sir?

108
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,316
- That's suicide.
- Exactly.

109
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,188
- Do you have the list I asked for?
- Yes, General.

110
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,239
These are the units
loyal to the queen.

111
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,872
Hm. Then they're
the ones we'll be sending.

112
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,077
It's a shame.
There's some fine officers here.

113
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,233
Don't we need the queen's
approval to declare war?

114
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,276
Our very next stop, Cutter.

115
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,079
General,
we've been at peace for years.

116
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,072
- Why would they attack?
- They want our land.

117
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,234
They're desperate for new territory.
Perhaps they think we've grown soft.

118
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,871
Why don't we dispatch an ambassador,
negotiate a new treaty?

119
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,396
- We don't need to send soldiers.
- Believe me,

120
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,876
every ant in this colony
is so precious to me.

121
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,758
- (Grunts)
- That's why we must strike now.

122
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,910
We have the element of surprise.

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,798
If the termite troops
enter our colony...

124
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,759
Yes, General,
I know what they can do to us.

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,833
- Very well.
- You've made a wise decision.

126
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,356
In fact, you've ensured
the future of this colony.

127
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,151
Hello, General.

128
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,438
Princess Bala. What a nice surprise.

129
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,988
You look lovelier
each time I see you.

130
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,073
Thanks. I hope you're not
just here on business.

131
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,993
Oh, of course... (Chuckles)
of course not.

132
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,680
Because, um, it might be nice...

133
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,356
if we had a conversation once
before we get married.

134
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,434
You're absolutely right. Schedule me
some private time with Princess Bala.

135
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,876
Uh, sir, there is time now
for a personal moment.

136
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,315
We're a few seconds
ahead of schedule.

137
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,277
Excellent. Princess.

138
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,830
Well, a few seconds isn't much,

139
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,232
but I guess if it's quality time...

140
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,836
So, how was your day?
Anything interesting happen?

141
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,198
- We declared war.
- Declared war?

142
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,157
Boy, talk about a rough day.

143
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,199
Sir, I hate to interrupt,
but time stands still for no ant.

144
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,111
Princess.

145
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,676
Mom, could you remind me,
why am I marrying this guy?

146
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,638
Bala, do we have to argue
about this again?

147
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,508
We don't have anything in common.
The guy's a stiff.

148
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,194
Yes, darling.
I know the General is...

149
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,670
a little gruff
and somewhat overbearing at times,

150
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,558
but I know that he cares about you.

151
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,791
He's just not particularly good
at showing it.

152
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,668
But he was very persistent
when he asked to marry you.

153
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,432
But why me?

154
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,195
Because you're the one
who has to continue my work.

155
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,149
- What if I don't like my place?
- Everyone has their place, Bala...

156
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,232
you, the soldiers, the workers.

157
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,993
It's not that bad
being princess, is it?

158
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,311
Would you rather be
carting around dirt all day?

159
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,197
Mother, don't be so dramatic.

160
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,316
(Music plays)

161
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,198
At least they have some fun
every now and then.

162
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,910
- Two aphid beers.
- Why'd I have to be born a worker?

163
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,356
You soldiers get glory,
plus you get to go outside.

164
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,477
You meet interesting insects,
you kill them.

165
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,711
Yeah. But you get to spend
all day with those...

166
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,360
beautiful worker girls.

167
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,831
Weaver, they're career girls.
They're obsessed with digging.

168
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,799
I don't think I'm ever
gonna meet the right girl for me.

169
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,077
A girl for you?
I was talking about a girl for me.

170
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,469
Don't you want your aphid beer?

171
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,031
Call me crazy, but I can't drink
from the anus of another creature.

172
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,758
Suit yourself.

173
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,992
Ahh. Me, I'm cuttin' loose.
We got royal inspection comin' up.

174
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,790
Standing around like an idiot while
a bunch of blue-bloods smirk at you.

175
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,831
How do you put up with it?

176
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,639
Z, I've known you
for a long time, right?

177
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,915
You were born two seconds after me.

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,276
And ever since then
I've listened to you complain.

179
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,194
What are you bitching about?
We ants are running the show.

180
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,191
We're the lords of the Earth.

181
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,999
Hey, don't talk to me
about earth, OK?

182
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,595
Cos I just spent all day
hauling it around.

183
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,911
(Sighs) There's just
gotta be a better place.

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,468
There is. I've been there.

185
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,676
Sorry? Were you talking to me?

186
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,672
There is a better place...

187
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,432
Insectopia.

188
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,158
Oh, really?

189
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,435
Lunatic at three o'clock.

190
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,513
You can't understand till you
go there and see it yourself.

191
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,590
You can be your own ant there.

192
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,035
The streets are paved with food.

193
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,156
Nobody tellin' you what to do.

194
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,639
No wars.

195
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,278
No colony.

196
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,718
- I shoulda never left.
- Oh. Fascinating.

197
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,713
We were on a long-range recon.
I got cut off from my unit.

198
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,429
Nothing like post-traumatic stress
disorder to complete your day.

199
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,114
- Then I saw it! Insectopia!
- Hey!

200
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,111
You head towards the monolith.

201
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,749
Ten clicks past the canyons
to the land of red and white.

202
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,195
You've had enough for one night.

203
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,748
Come on. Before you get in trouble.

204
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,276
Head for the monolith. Listen to me!
The monolith!

205
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,197
That guy's got a screw loose.

206
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,748
- Across the lake!
- Insectopia. Hmm.

207
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,035
It'd be great if it were that easy.

208
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,669
- Yeah. Dream on, Z.
- Cross the lake!

209
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,558
Look for the land of red and white!

210
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,631
Wow!

211
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,190
This is so... gritty.

212
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,317
Ten minutes, right?
This place is off limits.

213
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,994
Just blame me.
Say it was all my idea.

214
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,108
- It is all your idea.
- Besides, no one will recognise us.

215
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,555
Come on, girls. What do you say?

216
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,837
Let's take a walk on the wild side.

217
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,515
(Dull voice on PA)
'OK, everybody, 6:15. Time to dance.'

218
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,558
- Time to cut a rug, Z.
- Oh, no. That's OK.

219
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,871
I'm gonna leave the rug
just the way it is, Weaver.

220
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,430
(# Slow jazz)

221
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,552
Step back, ladies.

222
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,950
I'm gonna ask one of these
workers to dance with me.

223
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,519
Oh.

224
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,876
What a bunch of losers.

225
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,669
Mindless zombies capitulating
to an oppressive system.

226
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,512
Hi. Wanna dance?

227
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,591
Absolutely.

228
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,790
Follow me.

229
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,395
So, how come I haven't seen you
around here before?

230
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,234
Oh, I don't get out much.
I, uh, I work over at the palace.

231
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,630
The palace?
I bet those royals really live it up.

232
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,156
Course they're all...
you know... from inbreeding.

233
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,389
What?

234
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,398
Yowch!

235
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,190
Y-y... yowch! Yowch.

236
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,231
- Yooowch.
- What on earth are you doing?

237
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,677
Well, actually, to tell you
the truth, I'm sort of making it up.

238
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,193
Really?

239
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,956
Why does everybody have to dance
the same? That's completely boring.

240
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,951
It's no fun.

241
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,429
(# Samba)

242
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,509
Hey. Watch your step, worker.

243
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,478
You watch yours
or you'll be in big trouble!

244
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,791
Th-th-that's OK.
I'll... let him off this time.

245
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,599
Are you crazy?
He's built like a pebble.

246
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,390
- Aren't you gonna defend yourself?
- Hey, buddy. Get back in place.

247
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,950
- Me? Uh... uh...
- What if he doesn't want to?

248
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,120
Yeah. What if I don't like my place?

249
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,556
- We got us a troublemaker.
- Buckle up, Spanky.

250
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,838
This one goes out
to all the lazy workers.

251
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,148
(Grunts)

252
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,800
Watch that aggressive behaviour,
buddy.

253
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,950
He's just a worker. (Muffled)

254
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,077
- (Ants shouting)
- (Chuckles)

255
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,471
Princess Bala! Princess Bala!
The guards are coming.

256
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,358
- Let's get outta here.
- Wait.

257
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,476
(Shouting and fighting)

258
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,755
Princess? You're a princess?

259
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,996
Uh... I gotta go.

260
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,231
- When can I see you again?
- Let me think.

261
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,992
Never.

262
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,594
- Bye.
- No, wait!

263
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,155
Oof!

264
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,351
# What a day it has been

265
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,273
# What a rare mood I'm in

266
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,239
# Why, it's almost like
being in love

267
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,997
# There's a smile on my face
for the whole insect race

268
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,516
# Why, it's almost like
being in love #

269
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,511
(Whistle blows)

270
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,197
Yowch.

271
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,395
(General chatter)

272
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,711
- Can I get you another one, pal?
- No... thanks.

273
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,076
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Yeah. I don't blame you.

274
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,709
It's always slow in here
before those royal reviews.

275
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,952
I guess soldiers need their shuteye
before they meet the queen.

276
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,598
That's it!

277
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,796
You know, I was once...

278
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,552
See ya.

279
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,715
(Snoring)

280
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,354
Psst. Weaver.

281
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,829
I figured it out. Weaver. Weaver!

282
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,757
What? What?

283
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,633
I got a great idea.
Switch places with me.

284
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,359
Let me go to the inspection
instead of you.

285
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,399
- What time is it?
- The royal family will be there.

286
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,314
- This is the only way I can see her.
- See who?

287
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,233
- Princess Bala.
- Are you nuts?

288
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,039
You want me
to switch places with you?

289
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,910
Do you know how much trouble you can
get into for impersonatin' a soldier?

290
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,468
It's trouble
just listenin' to someone

291
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,154
talkin' about
impersonatin' a soldier.

292
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,912
You have to help me.

293
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,913
If I can't see her again,
my life is not worth living.

294
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,157
P-p-please, Weaver. Please.

295
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,198
Switch jobs with me just, you know,
for a day.

296
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,953
Th-think of everything
I've done for you.

297
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,634
Hm. I can't think of anything.

298
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,633
OK. So, think of all the things
that I'm gonna do for you.

299
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,756
Would I meet some worker girls?

300
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,991
Are you kidding?
They always go for the new guy.

301
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,911
It's like a sport for them.

302
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,199
And they will definitely go for
an adorable little insect like you.

303
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,875
Weaver, I... I have to see her again.

304
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,158
Z, what kind of chance
do you have with a princess?

305
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,153
I mean, she probably
won't even remember you.

306
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,273
(Sighs) l-I know it sounds nuts...

307
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,396
but I have to try.

308
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,831
- Oh, boy.
- (Marching music)

309
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,110
Princess, fancy meeting you here.

310
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,038
What do you say we... lose this crowd?

311
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,556
Oh, me?
You know, I... I wear many hats.

312
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,279
You'd have to call me
a Renaissance ant.

313
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,998
(Man) Eyes right!

314
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,119
- Beautiful! Just beautiful!
- Mm.

315
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,277
- The precision. The order.
- Oh.

316
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,636
Princess Bala! Princess Bala!
Hey. It's me.

317
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,557
Remember Z from the bar?

318
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,950
Princess Bala!
Princess Bala! Princess...

319
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,634
Bala, you must encourage the troops.

320
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,517
Wave.

321
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,479
Oh. She sees me.
Excuse me, guys. l-I... Sorry.

322
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,711
- I just got a better offer. Excu...
- Company halt!

323
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,237
Princess! (Princess Bala!)

324
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,629
Quiet there! Get back in rank.

325
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,952
- You new, kid?
- Y-yes, but I'm gettin' out soon.

326
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,190
I got a trial membership.

327
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,272
Trial membership. (Chuckles)
Good one!

328
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,954
- Name's Barbatus.
- Z.

329
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,917
- Right face!
- Psst.

330
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,879
(Whip cracks)

331
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,439
Sacrifice.

332
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,796
To some, it is just a word.

333
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,950
To others, it is a code.

334
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,634
- I'm bad at word games.
- (Chuckles)

335
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,429
A soldier knows that the life
of one ant doesn't matter.

336
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,351
What matters is the colony.

337
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,796
He'll live for the colony,
fight for the colony,

338
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,438
die for the colony.

339
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,876
- This guy's crazy.
- I hear ya.

340
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,590
At 0800 hours, we received word
that the termite enemy has mobilised.

341
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,070
We have no choice
but to launch a pre-emptive strike.

342
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,628
You are the queen's finest.

343
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,393
I know you will all do your duty.

344
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,153
I am proud to send you into battle.

345
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,708
Into... I'm... I'm sorry. Into battle?

346
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,032
- Dismissed.
- Left face! Forward march!

347
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,873
I think there's been
a terrible mistake.

348
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,793
The truth is
I just... came for the speech.

349
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,314
Don't worry, kid.
I'll watch out for ya.

350
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,633
- Sound off.
- One!

351
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,631
- Two!
- Three!

352
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,836
- Huh?
- Five!

353
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,273
- Six!
- Seven!

354
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,713
- Eight!
- Nine!

355
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,153
- Ten!
- Eleven!

356
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,593
- Twelve!
- Thirteen!

357
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,029
# We ants go marching one by one
hurrah, hurrah

358
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,711
(All) # We slaughter termites
just for fun, hurrah, hurrah... #

359
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,234
So, these termites, th-they're...

360
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,356
We're talkin' pushovers, right

361
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,113
Not really,
they're five times our size.

362
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,078
And they shoot acid
from their foreheads.

363
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,037
Hey! Keep it movin', shorty!

364
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,796
(All) # We ants go marching
two by two, hurrah, hurrah

365
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,316
# We'll all be dead before
we're through, hurrah... #

366
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,756
Say, exactly... what exactly
does our platoon do?

367
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,992
I mean, will we be serving beverages
or processing paperwork?

368
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,516
Our platoon has the best assignment -
first into battle.

369
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,878
# We ants go marching three by three,
hurrah, hurrah

370
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,552
(All) Hurrah! Hurrah!

371
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,236
# We're off to face our destiny
hurrah, hurrah... #

372
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,278
Let's not...
We're being too hasty here.

373
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,476
These guys sound like bruisers.

374
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,154
How were you figuring
on beating them?

375
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,155
Superior numbers, kid. Overwhelm
their defences and kill their queen.

376
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,913
Fellas, you're being
a little extreme.

377
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,516
Let's influence their political
process with campaign contributions.

378
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,518
I like you, kid.
You got a sense of humour.

379
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,993
Forward!

380
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,833
Come on!
Let's kick some termite butt!

381
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,518
Over the top!

382
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,597
- (All shouting)
- Yeeow!

383
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,799
Yee-ha!

384
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,837
(Shouting stops)

385
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,957
- Where is everyone?
- Something's not right.

386
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,552
Don't be scared, kid.

387
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,751
- (Gasps)
- (Growls)

388
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,115
They're here! Ahh!

389
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,518
Attack!

390
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,118
(Shouting, roaring and screaming)

391
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,677
(Groans)

392
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,958
Come on!

393
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,232
- (Roars)
- Ahh!

394
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,068
Barbatus, you saved my life.

395
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,435
Don't get all sappy about it.

396
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,513
- Hey, guys! Behind you!
- (Roars)

397
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,112
Hey... hey, guys?

398
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,475
Can somebody help me here?
Anybody...?

399
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,234
Yeah!

400
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,276
(Grunting)

401
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,669
OK, mama! Unh!

402
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,716
Yeah. Oof!

403
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,751
Oh, yeah. Big guy comin' through.
(Grunts)

404
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,991
I love it.

405
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,437
Hey, hey, hey!
Take it easy, muscles.

406
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,358
You're makin'
the rest of us look bad.

407
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,271
What happened to Z?

408
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,239
He's... takin' a personal day,
so I'm filling in.

409
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,517
You fill in any more,
and you'll explode.

410
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,632
Eh, you got a problem?

411
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,236
No, uh... uh... Nobody told me
digging was so much fun.

412
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,198
You know, you pick the dirt up.
You move it.

413
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,478
You pick it up again.
You move it again. Lots of reps.

414
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,710
You exercise the arms
and the thorax.

415
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,473
Yes, I... I see what you mean.

416
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,511
- Yeah. Fascinating.
- Sorry, sir!

417
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,949
I was just chattin'
with my friend, sir.

418
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,318
You know, I just had a chat
with General Mandible.

419
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,439
Anybody who doesn't meet his quota
is going to be downsized.

420
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,830
Come on. Cut him a break. He's new.

421
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,954
Hey. What do you say we help
your attitude a little bit...

422
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,511
by taking away
your rations for the day.

423
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,431
Thanks for your time.

424
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,393
I don't know what came over me.
Talking back like that?

425
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,071
I must be losin' it.

426
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,037
Sorry I got you in trouble.

427
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,873
But, you can...
share my rations... Whoa!

428
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,837
If you want.

429
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,390
- Are you askin' me out to dinner?
- (Chuckles)

430
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,436
Oh, no. I...

431
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,798
Well, if you don't have
anything else planned...

432
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,952
(Laughs) I'll check my calendar.

433
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,792
You know,

434
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,917
I'm kinda glad Z's takin' a breather.

435
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,917
Kid!

436
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,116
Kid, over here.

437
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,198
Barbatus.

438
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,750
Be honest, kid. Am I hurt bad?

439
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,595
N-no. N-not at all. You're...
Actually, you're lookin' terrific.

440
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,831
You got, you know,
swell colour in your cheeks.

441
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,833
No. I can see it in your eyes.

442
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,751
I'm a goner.

443
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,991
Help me up, Z.

444
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,752
(Sniffs)

445
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,229
I c-can't feel my legs.

446
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,950
You gotta hang in there, buddy.
I know you're gonna make it.

447
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,235
Just take... take deep breaths.

448
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,437
Because I'm gonna try
and find your body.

449
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,354
It's bound to be...
out there... s-somewhere.

450
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,552
(Coughs, sighs)

451
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,114
B-Barbatus, hang on.

452
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,718
- B-Barbatus.
- Don't make my mistake, kid.

453
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,997
Don't follow orders your whole life.

454
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,993
Think for yourself. Ohh...

455
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,157
Barbatus.

456
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,797
(Cutter) We're on schedule. Work
is completed on "A" section, sir.

457
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,996
We're clearing "D" section now.

458
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,277
I want double shifts
around the clock.

459
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,079
- Is that clear?
- Crystal, sir.

460
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,435
Good. What about section...

461
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,557
- Excuse me, sir.
- This better be important.

462
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,710
It's the termite battle, sir.

463
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,476
The enemy was destroyed, but it was
a disaster for our troops, as well.

464
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,950
Well, that's terrible. Terrible.

465
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,316
There is good news, sir.
One soldier made it back.

466
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,072
- No kidding.
- What?

467
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,153
Word is spreading. The Queen
wants to meet the war hero.

468
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,559
Damn!

469
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,835
Good. Damn good.

470
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,558
Uh, I'll handle this.

471
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,959
(Footsteps approaching)

472
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,674
- Congratulations, soldier.
- (Ahem)

473
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,871
You're a little short for a war hero,
aren't you?

474
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,273
A war hero? Sir, l-I don't
actually think that I'm a hero.

475
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,396
Good. I don't like heroes.

476
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,630
But, sir. You don't understand...

477
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,711
(Crowd cheering)

478
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,308
I... I didn't do anything.

479
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,359
I mean, it was all horrible.
It was just... just a massacre.

480
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,431
A-a massacre upon a massacre.

481
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,909
That's good, soldier. Now, wave.

482
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,353
(Cheering)

483
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,399
There was nothing
you could do, Weaver.

484
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,040
You didn't know
they were going to war.

485
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,997
I just feel horrible.

486
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,073
Poor Z.
I should have never let him go.

487
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,278
Wait a minute.
That's no soldier. That's Z!

488
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,319
Z? The little guy made it!
(Chuckles)

489
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,118
(Crowd cheering)

490
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,552
Let's go, soldier.

491
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,789
(Cheers)

492
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,593
(Cheers)

493
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,153
As I was saying, son,
you are an ant after my own heart.

494
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,955
An ant that looks Death
in the face and laughs.

495
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,632
Well, the truth is,

496
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,678
l-I just make belittling comments...

497
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,832
and snicker behind Death's back.
(Chuckles)

498
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,957
(Queen) General Mandible.

499
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,397
Keep your comments to yourself.
Let me do the talking.

500
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,873
(Yawns)

501
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,748
May I present
Her Majesty the Queen.

502
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,353
Charmed. Charmed.

503
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,351
And the Royal Princess Bala.

504
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,395
(Purrs)

505
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,755
Welcome home, soldier.

506
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,197
We cannot begin to express our
gratitude for your heroic efforts.

507
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,511
The private asked me to convey
his humble appreciation.

508
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,353
Please, please,
it was nothing, really.

509
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,389
Just run-of-the-mill valour...
and extraordinary courage, you know.

510
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,631
In battle,
there's very little time to think.

511
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,917
One must attack! Attack! Attack!

512
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,594
- (Chuckles) Well, indeed.
- (Muffled)

513
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,196
As you can see, Your Highness, the
battlefield is fresh in his mind,

514
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,795
so this is the perfect time
to debrief the private.

515
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,792
Oh, please, General.
Not on our first date.

516
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,235
(Chuckles) "Not on our first date."

517
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,039
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

518
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,873
Well, maybe. Then again, maybe not.

519
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,430
And then... then again...
Yowch.

520
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,034
That's it! The guy from the bar.

521
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,793
- Don't... Shh.
- Bar? What bar?

522
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,077
I danced with this guy at the bar
the other night.

523
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,991
He was just a worker, then.

524
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,709
- What were you doing at a bar?
- That's what I want to know.

525
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,157
No. This isn't about me. I mean,
look what this worker's done.

526
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,437
You're thinkin' of someone else.
I am a soldier.

527
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,671
Exactly. You WERE a worker

528
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,399
but now, you're a war hero.

529
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,075
- He's a worker?
- A worker danced with my fiancée?

530
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,071
F-fiancée?

531
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,355
W-w-wait a minute.

532
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,000
This is not how it looks.
I can explain.

533
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,389
She was the one making all the moves.

534
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,311
Arrest him.

535
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,675
H-hey, wait, can't we discuss this?

536
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,149
What are you doing? Let go of her!

537
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,390
- He's taking her hostage!
- Huh?

538
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,836
No. No, I'm not.
I mean, yes, I am.

539
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,593
One more step
and the princess gets it.

540
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,353
Oh, let go of me!

541
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,635
Ow! Don't make me hurt her.

542
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,597
Get off!

543
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,311
(Both screaming)

544
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,556
(Groans) Ugh. Oh.
What are you doing, you creep?

545
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,552
Are you out of your puny little mind?

546
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,279
(Ant) There they are! Let's go! Move!

547
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,351
Oh, good.

548
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,477
Here they come,
to rescue me... and kill you.

549
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,879
Kill?

550
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,758
- Hey, you guys!
- Stop! What are you doing?

551
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,512
Get off, you little twerp!

552
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,273
Don't throw away
everything we've got!

553
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,357
What're you waiting for? Hello! Guys!

554
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,228
- Huh?
- What is it?

555
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,830
It's beautiful.

556
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,275
Ridgeway, get out of there!

557
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,552
- Oof!
- Oh!

558
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,468
(Both sigh)

559
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,075
- Oh, don't worry. I'm OK.
- You?!

560
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,073
You're OK?
Hey, who cares about you?

561
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,276
- I almost died.
- Calm down.

562
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,148
Don't let a little
near-death experience ruin your mood.

563
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,074
Hey, this is not a mood.
You're not listening to me.

564
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,912
Where am I?

565
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,592
Look, what's-your-name, just climb up
that tree and find out where I am.

566
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,672
Look, th-the trick is not to panic.

567
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,274
You know,
h-h-he w-who panics is lost.

568
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,716
What am I saying? We are lost.

569
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,832
- Whoa!
- (Gasps)

570
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,273
(Chuckles)

571
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,634
Ow!

572
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,073
I've been kidnapped
by the village idiot.

573
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,639
Who's the bigger idiot -

574
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,030
the idiot, or the idiot
who gets kidnapped by the idiot?

575
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,395
Did you talk those termites to death?

576
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,359
I can't believe you tried
to pass yourself off as a soldier.

577
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,271
Why are you stalking me?

578
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,511
Don't you realise that I'm...
out of your league?

579
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,831
YOU were cruising the worker bar
for action,

580
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,956
And you happened to find it...

581
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,669
the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker.

582
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,269
Please. I was slumming it.
Don't you get it?

583
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,115
I chose you because you were the most
pathetic little bug in the joint.

584
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,159
I was gonna let you become part
of my most erotic fantasies,

585
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,435
but now, you can forget that.

586
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,957
You know, I guess what you prefer
is Old Blood and Guts.

587
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,113
His idea of a romantic night out
is two seats at an execution.

588
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,760
You really chose the right husband.

589
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,671
For your information,

590
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,231
the General and I
are deeply, deeply in...

591
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,078
engaged.

592
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,072
You come right back
down here this instant!

593
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,869
We are marching straight back
to the colony so that I...

594
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,793
(Bala continues in background)

595
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,116
The monolith!

596
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,914
Wonderful. That's an appealing offer.

597
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,232
But, considering the options, you go.
I'm going to Insectopia.

598
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:01,236
Oh, come on. Insectopia?
You're crazier than I thought.

599
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,518
Yeah? Well, I happen to have it
on a very reliable source.

600
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,875
(Ahem) Or... or should I say,

601
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,951
a drunk, raving source?

602
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,192
But the point is, I'm convinced
the place definitely exists.

603
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,319
Stop! I order you to stop, worker!

604
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,836
Hey, I got a name, OK? It's Z.

605
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,798
And out here,
you can't order me around.

606
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,678
All right. Fine. No problem.

607
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,637
Oh...!

608
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,477
(Rumbling)

609
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,358
Wha-what? (Screams)

610
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,870
- (Growls)
- (Gasps)

611
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,997
Worker! Worker! Where are you?

612
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,153
Z? Z? Wait for me.

613
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,516
No more excuses, General.
I want my daughter back.

614
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,115
I'm beginning to doubt
your ability to handle this.

615
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,670
Your Highness, we will
spare no effort to bring her back.

616
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,312
Princess Bala is... essential
to all our plans for the future.

617
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,630
So he kills himself 100 termites,

618
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,635
gets a few medals, then bada-bing,
bada-bip, bags himself the Princess.

619
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,632
- He looks him in the eye...
- And says, "Bite me."

620
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,472
To General Mandible?

621
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,074
Buddy. Hey, hey, buddy.

622
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,515
You heard about the war hero named Z?

623
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,875
Runs off with the Princess, right?

624
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,317
When they sent the guards after him,
he just looks at 'em and boom!

625
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,473
- They burst into flames.
- Z? (Chuckles) You talkin' about Z?

626
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,632
I know Z. He's a friend of mine.
I think you...

627
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,395
- You know Z?
- Yeah. He's a worker.

628
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,436
A worker? That's impossible.

629
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,273
A worker can't do anything,
except work.

630
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,237
Yeah. We got no choice.

631
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,993
We do have a choice.
Uh, I mean, look at Z.

632
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,753
He wanted something,
and he went for it.

633
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:59,038
He's not alone. I was a soldier
and I switched places with him.

634
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,678
You're tellin' me...

635
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,558
- I don't have to be here?
- We've got a choice?

636
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,149
They don't want you to know,
but we don't have to work.

637
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,959
Workers control
the means of production.

638
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,951
If Z don't dig, I don't dig.

639
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,158
People, what is this,
an encounter group? Get back to work.

640
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,355
Why?

641
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,831
...on the tunnel! This guy, Z,
he's leadin' a revolution!

642
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,797
I'll... get back to you.

643
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,394
(All chattering)

644
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,872
Think about it, Z... two ants.

645
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,431
Who ever heard of two ants?
Two million ants, maybe. But two?

646
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,159
Look, I'm hungry, I'm thirsty...

647
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,800
And this whole desert thing?

648
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,270
- It just doesn't work for me.
- Yada, yada, yada...

649
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,709
It's about time you took me back.

650
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,308
Take yourself back. Phew.

651
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,796
Excuse me!
You kidnapped me, remember?

652
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,555
That means you have
certain responsibilities.

653
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,359
You can't just abandon me here.

654
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,989
- It's better than the colony.
- You're not serious?!

655
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,517
Maybe you were living it up,
but personally, this beats digging.

656
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,990
If you'd ever done
a day's labour you'd know.

657
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,754
Labour?
What do you know about labour?

658
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,559
How would you feel
if you had to give birth

659
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,393
every ten seconds
for the rest of your life?

660
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,631
- Gee.
- Water!

661
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,518
Ahh. All you think about is yourself.

662
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,955
Nobody else ever thought about me.

663
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,918
So I don't need anybody else.

664
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,718
Unh!

665
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,360
(Muffled) Help! Help me, Bala!

666
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,398
Help! B-B-B-B-Bala!

667
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,357
I'll get you out. Hold on.

668
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,515
Help, Ba...

669
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,109
(Both gasping)

670
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,676
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

671
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,753
Now, maybe we can put
this fantasy behind us...

672
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,910
and head back to the colon...

673
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,276
Oh, Z! What are you doing?

674
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,989
- We've gotta cross the lake.
- Am I missing something?

675
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,311
Didn't we just get OUT of the water?

676
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,799
Bala, look,
what have you got to lose?

677
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:49,079
I mean, think about it. Do you really
want to be Mrs Raving Lunatic?

678
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,989
There's a better place.

679
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,430
Z, please.

680
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,954
Just... gimme one chance.

681
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,235
If we don't find Insectopia soon,

682
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,596
I promise
I'll take you back to the colony.

683
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,433
(Bala) I hope you know
what you're doing.

684
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,272
(Z) Yeah, me too.

685
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,077
(Indistinct shouting)

686
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,356
(Chanting) We want Z! We want Z!

687
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,797
People, come on. I know some ants
who won't make their quota.

688
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,314
Buzz off, pawn of the oppressor.

689
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,113
(Chanting continues)
We want Z! We want Z!

690
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:52,557
Sorry, sir. I came as soon as I
heard. I was debriefing the trackers.

691
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,837
- And? What's the report?
- Well, this Z, sir...

692
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,876
He's one slippery character.

693
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,032
They lost Bala's trail
at the edge of the lake.

694
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,111
The lake?

695
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,873
(All) # All we are saying

696
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,270
# Is give Z a chance... #

697
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,749
What's that soldier doing there?

698
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,998
It appears he's holding hands, sir.
With a worker.

699
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,356
I don't like the way
things are going, Cutter.

700
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,874
I'm counting on you for results.

701
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,474
- Can I depend on you or not?
- Yes, sir.

702
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,755
All right. Let's wrap this up.

703
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:31,072
(Chanting)
We want Z! We want Z! We want Z!

704
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,277
I've heard a lot about this Z.

705
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,268
I even had the pleasure
of meeting him once.

706
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,271
But where is he now?!

707
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,794
Can anyone point him out?

708
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,469
I mean, if this Z
cares so much about us,

709
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,437
then why isn't he here?

710
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,438
I'll tell you why.

711
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,512
Because Z doesn't
give a damn about us.

712
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,591
(Ants murmuring)

713
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,275
That's why he kidnapped our princess
and ran away.

714
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,551
Z is no hero.

715
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,631
We are the heroes.

716
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,793
We are the ones ensuring
the future of our great colony.

717
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,589
And when we've completed
this magnificent structure,

718
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,240
we will reap the benefits -

719
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,198
more food and less work for everyone.

720
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,838
(Murmurs of approval)

721
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,639
And as further reward
for your efforts,

722
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,154
every one of you
will get the day off...

723
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,912
(Excited murmurings)

724
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,518
so you can be the guests of honour at
the MegaTunnel dedication ceremonies!

725
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,034
(All cheering)

726
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,196
Mandible! Mandible!

727
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,717
(Chanting) Mandible!
Mandible! Mandible! Mandible!

728
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,310
Now, bring me that soldier.

729
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,038
(Chanting) Mandible! Mandible!

730
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,917
(Yawns)

731
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,193
(Gasps) Oh, my God! Z! Come here!

732
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,033
It's Insectopia!

733
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,117
You were right. It really is here.

734
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,956
- Huh?
- All right. All right!

735
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,076
- You're a genius.
- Let's eat.

736
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,912
Mmph!

737
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,991
Huh. (Nervous chuckle)

738
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,838
(Muttering)

739
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,519
Well? What's the problem?

740
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,876
- There's some kind of force field.
- (Buzzing)

741
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,796
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me!
How do you get in?

742
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,834
Yes, well, I'm afraid
this is a private function.

743
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,232
- Who are your friends, dear?
- Crawling insects, poopsie.

744
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,312
Oh. The poor dears.

745
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,591
(Slowly) Uh, good morning.

746
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,478
- Huh?
- Darling, really.

747
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,195
Greeting every insect
that emerges out of the grass?

748
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,115
Pardon me!
I guess you don't recognise me!

749
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,871
I've been travelling
and I'm all... schlumpy.

750
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,871
I'm Princess Bala.

751
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,636
Oh! It's even worse.
They're Eurotrash.

752
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,395
Darling, they're poor.
They're dirty. They're smelly.

753
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,914
We have to help them.

754
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,073
If you'll just wait right here,
we'll fetch you a little something.

755
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,391
Oh, please, Muffy.
Not another crusade.

756
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,554
Chippie, we have a social obligation
to the less fortunate.

757
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,758
I know you laugh at my hobbies,
but this is important to me!

758
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,718
Mm. You have such a big heart.

759
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,872
That's why you're
my little cuddly-widdles.

760
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,795
Oh, my big, strong pheromone factory.

761
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,717
- Mmm!
- Oh!

762
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,833
Oh, brother.
Suddenly I've lost my appetite.

763
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,279
- You know...
- Muffy...

764
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,436
I guess I had imagined Insectopia...

765
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,189
I don't know... a little differently.

766
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,277
- Oh, Muffy!
- (Gasps)

767
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,796
- No! Oh, no! (Sobbing)
- Oh, no.

768
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,348
- Rumbling
- Look out!

769
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,599
Z, help me! Z!

770
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,712
Don't let me... Don't let me go, Z.

771
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,959
Get me out of here!

772
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,798
Bala!

773
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,318
Whoa, this is not good.

774
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,677
Whoa!

775
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,551
Whoa-oa-oa!

776
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,197
(Bala screaming)

777
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,112
Whoa!

778
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,999
Hi.

779
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,593
(Both screaming)

780
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,189
(Thud)

781
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,430
- Z?
- Yes?

782
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,753
It looks like this is it, just
when... I was starting to like you.

783
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,711
(Both scream)

784
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,996
Who the hell is that?

785
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,313
Uhh!

786
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,114
That's enough.

787
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,237
I ain't tellin' you nothin'.

788
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,711
Soldier, the princess is vital
to the future of this colony.

789
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,475
She must be returned
to take her proper place as queen.

790
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,755
We already have a queen.

791
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,429
As for your friend Z,
why should I hurt him?

792
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,431
(Chuckles) He's not important.

793
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,671
Now, soldier,

794
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,752
we all know that one individual ant
doesn't matter.

795
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,832
Not you...

796
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,956
- not Cutter...
- (Door opens)

797
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,315
- (Azteca grunts)
- Not even her.

798
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,590
Azteca! (Groaning)

799
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,274
Don't tell that tight-ass! Aagh!

800
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,430
- (Grunting)
- Where is Z?

801
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,592
- I don't know where he is!
- Hmm.

802
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,352
That's too bad.

803
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,477
(Azteca groaning)

804
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,079
Wait!

805
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,639
Insectopia.

806
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,349
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's where he'd be going.

807
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:37,594
Soldier, you think this is a game?
Insectopia does not exist.

808
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,318
As a matter of fact...

809
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,879
it does.

810
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,872
- Sir?
- I'll brief you on the co-ordinates.

811
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,838
You're gonna bring
the princess back.

812
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,115
And as for Z... Kill him.

813
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,078
But you said he didn't matter.

814
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,199
It's for the good of the colony.
You made the right decision.

815
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,636
Gentlemen, now you can see...

816
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,514
how dangerous individualism can be.

817
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,433
It makes us... vulnerable.

818
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,671
Let's go.

819
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,637
(Door slams)

820
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,554
Take him back to the MegaTunnel.
Put him on the front line.

821
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,598
Dismissed.

822
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,990
(Sighs) Jeez, what was I thinking?
I almost got you killed.

823
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,755
Z, you know, you really
shouldn't be so hard on...

824
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,719
(Straining) That's it.
I'm taking you back to the colony.

825
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,712
- Uhh! Ow! Oh.
- Uhh!

826
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,110
Insectopia.
You know, I must've been crazy.

827
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,792
- Z?
- But you know what?

828
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,836
- I admit it when I'm wrong.
- Z.

829
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,708
And this time, I gotta tell ya,
I was absolutely, 100%...

830
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,188
correct.

831
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,673
Have... have you ever seen
anything more beautiful in your life?

832
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,276
- It's... Insect...
- Shh! Don't jinx it. Come on!

833
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:20,351
# I can see clearly now
the rain is gone

834
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,591
(Burps)

835
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,151
# I can see all obstacles in my way

836
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,189
# Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind

837
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,477
- (Ladybug) Pardon us.
- # It's gonna be a bright

838
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:42,189
# (Bright, bright)
Bright sunshiny day

839
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,829
- (Insects squealing)
- # It's gonna be a bright

840
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,595
# (Bright, bright)
Bright sunshiny day

841
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:58,838
# Look all around
nothing but blue skies

842
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,758
# Look straight ahead nothing but

843
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,908
# Blue skies

844
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,117
# Whoa

845
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:22,593
# I can see clearly now
the rain is gone

846
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,557
(Buzzing)

847
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,235
# I can see all obstacles in my way #

848
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,551
All right, everybody.
I want all teams in place,

849
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,837
fully prepared
to seal the doors here and here.

850
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,390
'Make certain the digging crew
stays on schedule...

851
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,359
'for breakthrough
midway in the dedication ceremony.

852
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,159
'Now all we need is the princess.'

853
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,911
(Sniffs) Mm.

854
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:16,039
- This stuff tastes like crap.
- Really? Let me try some.

855
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,878
Hey, it is crap. Not bad.

856
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,999
- Somebody needs to feed that fire.
- Dude, I did it last time.

857
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,719
I'm not gonna get it.
It's not my job.

858
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:33,237
What about the new guy?
He hasn't contributed yet.

859
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:37,199
And... (Sighs) You know,
he just died in my arms like that.

860
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,956
I... You know, I don't think
he ever once in his life...

861
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,951
made his own choice.

862
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,718
I never knew it was like that.

863
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,870
I mean, up in the palace...

864
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,999
Well, I guess we just let the general
make all the decisions.

865
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:00,237
Let me ask you something. What
made you come to the bar that night?

866
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,835
I guess I was looking
for a little trouble.

867
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,912
Well, (Chuckles)
trouble's my middle name.

868
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,676
Actually, my middle name is Marion,
but... don't spread that around.

869
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,877
You're pretty strange.
You do know that?

870
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,396
Well... (Ahem) Strange
isn't the word I would use.

871
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,278
I like it.
You're not like anyone else.

872
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:26,195
Actually, now that you mention it,
there is a certain strangeness to me.

873
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,910
I mean, it's, you know, kind of
a bizarre quality. Some said "freak".

874
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,753
But it's, uh, you know, complimentary.

875
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,872
Hey, new guy!

876
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,712
We need more wood.

877
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,277
I'll be right back.
Just hold that thought...

878
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,318
whatever it is you were thinking.

879
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,995
Hey, you ever wonder why
they call you guys "pests"?

880
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,834
(Mosquito) What if, like,
we're just these tiny things...

881
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:01,198
and we're just, like, part of
this whole other huge universe...

882
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,590
that's, like, so big
we don't even know it exists?

883
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,632
(Ladybug chuckles)
Man, that is so deep.

884
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,994
Perfect.
Nothing like manual labour...

885
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,998
on the most romantic night
of my life.

886
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,911
(Buzzing)

887
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,712
Hi. I was in the neighbourhood
and I thought I'd drop in.

888
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,068
This is, uh, very bohemian.

889
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,230
Aloha, dude. Welcome to Insec...

890
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,550
- (Groans)
- (Insects gasp)

891
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,189
Sorry for interrupting.

892
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,910
You see, our princess has,
uh, gone missing,

893
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,150
and we're just sick about it.

894
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,429
She's about yea tall,
fairly easy on the eyes.

895
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,717
- Anybody seen her?
- (All) That's her.

896
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,910
Don't worry, Princess,
you'll be back home soon.

897
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,231
Listen, Cutter, I'm...
I'm not going back.

898
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,756
(Sighs) The thing is, Princess,
I got orders.

899
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,879
Orders? Can't you just once
think for yourself?

900
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,949
Well, that was very impressive.
Where's Z?

901
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,390
- Z? He's, uh...
- Dead.

902
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,195
Z's dead.
You don't need to worry about him.

903
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,035
Z's dead.
Well, he was an ant with ideas.

904
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,872
Too bad for him.

905
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,599
Princess, your colony needs you.

906
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,796
- (Grunting)
- (Bala) Cutter!

907
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,952
- Stop right now! Let go of me!
- Bala!

908
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,957
Stop, you...

909
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,439
Oh, no.

910
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,273
(Muttering) What am I gonna do?

911
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,557
All right, look.
Let's be rational about this.

912
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,552
You know, Bala and I,
she's a princess...

913
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,791
and I'm a...
I'm a soil-relocation engineer.

914
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,156
So... You know...
On the other hand, uh...

915
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,959
I've gotta go back for her.

916
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,958
(Chippie, drunk)
I'll... give you a lift.

917
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,157
Sss... Whoa! Ohh!

918
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,435
It's the least I can do.

919
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:11,958
Besides... it's what my waddly-kiddles
would want.

920
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,156
(Sniffling and sobbing)

921
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,118
Uh, look, how about
a cup of joe...?

922
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:21,034
- Well, old boy... saddle up.
- I saw a puddle of coffee there.

923
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,475
It... Whoa!

924
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,437
(Both groaning)

925
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,117
(Z) Look out!

926
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,834
(Bala grunting)

927
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,115
Ah, Princess.

928
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,636
- You're just in time.
- Take your hands off me!

929
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,188
General, what is going on here?

930
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,159
- I DEMAND an explanation.
- I'll explain... afterwards.

931
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,198
- Is the south-east entrance secure?
- Yes, sir.

932
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,077
Not afterwards. Now.

933
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,793
I don't like the way you think
or the way you run this colony.

934
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,111
And I don't like you.
The wedding is off.

935
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:06,273
- Things are going to change here.
- You're right, Princess.

936
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:10,353
Things are going to change.
Make her more comfortable.

937
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:14,069
- (Gasps)
- She'll be here for a while.

938
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,073
What do you think you're doing?
My mother will have your head.

939
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:23,154
I doubt that. (Chuckles) Ah, you've
got a fighter spirit, Bala.

940
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,152
Just what we need
to start our new colony.

941
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,152
We'll rinse away
the filth from our gutters.

942
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,471
We'll start anew,
with you by my side as my queen.

943
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,551
You're crazy.

944
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,877
I believe history
will see things differently.

945
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,032
All right, gentlemen.
Take your positions.

946
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,634
Someday... someday you'll thank me.

947
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,633
(Chippie and Z moaning)

948
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,632
(Z) Pull up! Pull up!
Aah! There it is!

949
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,836
(Chippie mutters and hiccups)

950
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,235
Oof! (Coughs) Oh!

951
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:07,552
Well, then, go get
the woman you love, Z.

952
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,949
So long, Chip. And thanks.

953
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,518
You there.
Where do you think you're goin'?

954
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,194
Me? Oh, no, I was just...
You know, I...

955
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,316
You're not supposed to be here.

956
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,279
Workers are to report
to the tunnel-opening ceremonies.

957
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:31,798
Yes, yes, of course. Well, I should
get going, then. I... (Ahem)

958
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,552
You know, the-the...

959
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:34,834
(Soldier) Hey!

960
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,957
- I'm going to the... the t-tunnel...

961
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,871
- Get moving.
- Better get...

962
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,475
I'm going to the
tunnel-opening ceremonies...

963
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,360
Excuse me, please.
Tunnel-opening ceremonies.

964
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,318
- Hey!
- Opening the tunnel. They need me.

965
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,960
- I'm the key man.
- Where are you going?

966
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,235
Tunnel-opening ceremonies.

967
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:01,071
- (Crashing)
- (Bala) Hey! Let me outta here!

968
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,593
Hey!

969
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,959
Gosh, this-this day just keeps
getting better and better.

970
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,514
(Bala shouting in distance)

971
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,953
(Bala) Are you listening to me
out there? I'm the princess!

972
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,837
Damn it!

973
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,590
- Wow, your manners haven't improved.
- Z!

974
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,035
(Gasps) Whoa! Whoa!

975
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,192
- (Gasps) Ooh!
- It's you. You came back for me.

976
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:38,876
Well, yeah, I came back for you.
I have strong feelings for you.

977
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,839
Let's face it, you're... you're...
you're beautiful...

978
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,913
A little combative at times,
but I think we can work on that.

979
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,592
You talk too much.

980
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:55,278
Gee, I think I'm about to become
the strong, silent type.

981
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,479
Come on. The city's deserted.
We'd better get outta here.

982
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,552
Z... (Sighs) We can't go.

983
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,235
Mandible's insane.
He... he keeps talking about...

984
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:11,154
washing away the filth
and-and changing history and...

985
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,357
and I think he's going to try
to kill my mother.

986
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,193
(Z) Not just your mother... everyone.

987
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,430
- What's going on?
- Look.

988
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,476
Here we are, safe in the city.

989
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,393
But they're gonna seal
everybody off in the MegaTunnel.

990
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,436
And... here's the lake.

991
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,875
You're right.

992
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,155
We can't leave now.

993
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,310
Come on. We gotta get down there.

994
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,756
Today is the realisation of a dream.

995
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,070
A dream of a proud colony.

996
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:44,233
A pure colony. A colony reborn.

997
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,356
(Cheering)

998
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,916
Moments from now
this tunnel will open.

999
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,834
The past will be washed away
and a new day will dawn.

1000
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,876
(Cheering)

1001
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,951
A stirring speech, General.

1002
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:03,237
I wish my daughter
were here to appreciate it.

1003
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:07,233
Your Majesty, I know
how concerned you are about Bala.

1004
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,788
But my scouts
are on her trail and...

1005
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,713
I don't want to discuss it.
Just find her.

1006
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,155
I will, Your Highness.

1007
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,031
Goodbye.

1008
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,437
(Soldiers talking)

1009
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,071
(Ants chattering)

1010
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,279
Seal up the doors.

1011
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:39,797
- Cutter, did you hear me?
- Sir, I've been thinking.

1012
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:44,158
Do we need to do this?
Look at what these workers have done.

1013
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,869
They got the right stuff.
Isn't there any other way?

1014
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,076
Cutter, you're a fine officer.

1015
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,993
You have discipline,
courage, ability.

1016
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:57,596
But you seem to have a weakness for
the lower orders I find disturbing.

1017
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,195
- Now, are you with me?
- Sir, uh... I apologise.

1018
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,192
- All right, then. Seal it up.
- Yes, sir.

1019
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,432
(Grunting)

1020
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,910
(Queen) As I look out
on this magnificent tunnel,

1021
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,070
I am filled with pride.

1022
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,958
- (Z) Jump!
- In these difficult times,

1023
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,510
it is a great solace to know
that you, our workers...

1024
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,909
- (Queen continues)
- Mom! Wait!

1025
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,278
Every worker in the colony is here.
Hey, that guy owes me money.

1026
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:39,831
(Queen) This tremendous
accomplishment is a testimony to...

1027
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,879
Go warn your mother.
I've gotta get to those diggers.

1028
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:47,839
- There's not enough time.
- Leave the pessimism to me, OK?

1029
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,751
- (Queen continuing)
- Ow!

1030
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,398
- Ooh!
- Yeeow!

1031
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,948
Excuse me! Sorry. Excuse me.

1032
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,157
When our expert diggers
break through to the surface...

1033
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,595
- Mom! Stop!
- The sun will pour in...

1034
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,717
Bala! Where've you been?
Are you all right?

1035
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,950
- I'm fine.
- What happened?

1036
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,640
Mother, we're in terrible danger.

1037
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,872
(Panting)

1038
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,837
(Sighs)

1039
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,309
Put your backs into it, people!

1040
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,039
Wait! Hold... Hey, stop digging!

1041
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,270
- Z? Is that you?
- We must stop!

1042
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,635
- Z! You're back!
- (Bones crunch)

1043
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,870
- Oh, Z! Oh.
- (Gasping) Weaver!

1044
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,997
Z! What's the matter?

1045
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,311
H-hold up, everyone.
Stop! Stop digging.

1046
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,960
- On whose authority?
- Your own authority.

1047
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,156
If you break through, we'll...

1048
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,549
Drown. This tunnel is going to flood.

1049
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,790
We've got to get everyone out.

1050
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,791
(All murmuring)

1051
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,395
Look, I got orders,
and those orders say "dig".

1052
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,870
What if someone ordered you
to jump off a bridge?

1053
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:59,714
Oh, I'm asking the wrong guy here.
Look, think for yourselves!

1054
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,553
Gimme that!
I've had enough out of you.

1055
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,596
Get back to work.

1056
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,910
(Weaver) What's that noise?

1057
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,115
Uh-oh.

1058
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,916
- Let's get outta here!
- Run!

1059
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,797
(All screaming)

1060
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,189
(Weaver) Run! Keep going!

1061
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,875
Everyone, listen to me.
We've all been deceived.

1062
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,118
We need to calmly
head toward the exits.

1063
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,397
- Run for your lives! Flood!
- No. Don't panic.

1064
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:31,677
- Don't panic!
- Every ant for himself!

1065
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,637
(Gasps)

1066
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,676
(All screaming)

1067
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,675
All the exits are blocked!

1068
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,711
- What do we do?
- There's nothing we can do!

1069
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,353
Yes, there is.
Weaver, give me a leg up.

1070
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,352
Everyone, listen to me!

1071
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,908
- Who the heck are you?
- He's Z!

1072
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,276
(All murmuring)

1073
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:31,478
Listen, we gotta help each other
get out before we all drown.

1074
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,755
- How?
- By making a ladder.

1075
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,034
A ladder!

1076
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,873
Hey, if we built this,
we can do anything.

1077
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,191
- OK, let's move it!
- All of you, gather round.

1078
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,838
You, start climbing.

1079
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:47,030
- Grab my arm.
- All right. Here I go.

1080
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,475
- Go, go, go!
- Right!

1081
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,430
- Excuse me, Your Majesty.
- (Grunting)

1082
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,199
Z, I've gotta help my Mom.

1083
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:01,068
Don't worry. I know almost
exactly what I'm doing.

1084
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,471
I'll see you at the top.

1085
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,557
(Mandible) Gentlemen,
there comes a time...

1086
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,790
in the evolution of a colony...

1087
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:17,668
when the strong are meant
to rise above the weak.

1088
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,156
Now is that time.

1089
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,708
'Below us right now,

1090

'the weak elements of the colony...

1091

'are being washed away.'

01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,956
Oh, God, we're not gonna make it.

1093
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,316
- We need more ants.
- You two better get up there.

1094
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,630
Weaver, you can't hold it alone.

1095
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,870
Get going.

1096
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,791
Hang in there, buddy.

1097
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,034
- Got it!
- Hurry up! Go, go, go, go!

1098

(Gasps)

1099
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,996
Our princess is secure,
and a glorious future is at hand.

1100
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,951
We can all stand proud.

1101
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,838
It is time for a new beginning.

1102

- (Soldiers gasp)
- What the hell is that?

1103
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,235
I think that's the weak element, sir.

1104
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:31,199
- Gimme... gimme a hand!
- Z! You?

1105
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:35,717
Let go! Don't you understand?
It's for the good of the colony!

1106
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:39,156
Wha-what are you saying?
We are the colony!

Cutter... what are you doing?

1109
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,477
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

1110
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,154
This is for the good
of the colony, sir.

1111
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,670
You useless, ungrateful maggot!

1112
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,591
I am the colony!

1113
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,240
- Look out!
- Oof!

1114

(Screaming)

1115

Z!

1116
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,677
Men, let's move it!
Get these ants up here.

1117
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,312
- Keep it moving.
- Thank goodness we made it.

1118
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,277
Wait here.

1119
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,358
- Uhh! OK.
- Thank you.

1120
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,072
Weaver.

1121
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,512
Where's Z?

1122
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,634
Oh, no.

1123
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,598
(Weaver) Back up, everybody, back up!

1124
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:58,468
- Give him some air. Back up.
- Z, oh, Z.

1125
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,958
Please wake up.

1126

(All cheering)

1130

Yowch!

1131
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,794
You know, Weaver,
you still owe me that dinner.

1132
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,753
- (Kissing)
- Babylove.

1133

- We made it, Z!
- You da ant!

1134
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,596
- Eh!
- You did it.

1135
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,716
We did it.

1136
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,995
- Oh!
- Fellas! Fellas, please!

1137
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,913
- This is very embarrassing!
- (Laughing)

1138
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,470

I probably could get used to this.
