3
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,680
- Move!
- Let's go, let's go!

4
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,720
We did it, right?

5
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,240
Whoa! What the hell are you doing?

6
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,880
- G-Girl!
- It's G-Girl!

7
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,480
Gun!

8
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,160
G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl!

9
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,800
Wow. If you could have any superpower,
what would it be?

10
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,960
The ability to blow myself.

11
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,840
That's quite a visual.

12
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,680
- But wouldn't it seem a little...
- Gay?

13
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,160
- No, not at all. Think about it.
- Yeah, really? It seems that way.

14
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,400
Oh, dude. Check her out.

15
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,000
Ooh. Wow.

16
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,960
What do we have here?
Kind of uptight librarian on the outside,

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,160
ready to rumble on the inside.

18
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,960
- Go ask her out.
- No. I'm not ready yet. I can't.

19
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, Matt. You're killing me.

20
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Your last insane girlfriend dumped you,
like, six months ago.

21
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,080
I would have ploughed my way
through half of SoHo by now.

22
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,840
That's cos you're soulless and shallow.

23
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,840
It is a blessing.

24
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,520
Go over there. Talk to her. Do it.

25
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,880
- Matt, say hi. Give me your bag. Come on.
- OK, OK.

26
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,880
Yes.

27
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,440
All out. Be strong. Breathe.

28
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,680
Eye of the tiger.

29
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,600
Hi.

30
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,680
Excuse me. I know I don't really know you,
but you look like a very interesting person,

31
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,320
so at the risk of totally humiliating myself,

32
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,200
I thought perhaps sometime
I might buy you a cup...

33
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,440
No!

34
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,320
It doesn't have to be a cup of coffee. It could
be whatever you want. A cup of anything.

35
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,120
Juice? Hey!

36
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,440
Hey!

37
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,800
Hey!

38
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,080
Hey!

39
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,720
Somebody stop that guy!

40
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,960
That's right. You better run, asshole!

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,360
Keep running, my man!
You don't want any of this. Keep running.

42
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,760
Yeah!

43
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,200
- What did you call me?
- Oh, shit!

44
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,720
What did you call me?

45
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,120
Idiot.

46
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,520
Come on! Get out of there.

47
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,400
Let's go! I know you're in there.
Get out of there!

48
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,800
Whoa!

49
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,640
Hey. How about it, huh?

50
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,720
So how about that cup of coffee?
Or it could be something more substantial.

51
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,920
- Like dinner?
- Yeah. That'd be great.

52
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,920
- Matt Saunders.
- Jenny Johnson.

53
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,320
Jenny Johnson. Wonderful name.
You got the whole alliteration thing going.

54
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,920
I grew up with a guy named
Francis Freddie Friedman.

55
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,680
A bit of a klepto, not the kind of guy you'd
want over if you had spare cash laying out.

56
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,400
Yeah, right. Right.

57
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,200
So, um... May I get your number?

58
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,920
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't give it out.
Privacy issues. I'll take yours, though.

59
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,440
- OK. Actually, I don't think I have a pen.
- I do.

60
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,920
Thanks. Isn't this something women do
just to blow off losers?

61
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,160
Yes, women do do that.

62
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,800
But that's not how I blow off losers.

63
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Hey, Saunders, heads up.

64
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,280
- Oh, you have bad reflexes.
- You know, you're a danger in the workplace.

65
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,640
Do you have the bathroom layouts
for the Beijing presentation?

66
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,720
- I'll take a look at those.
- I finished them up last night.

67
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,800
- Hey, Hannah.
- Hey, Vaughn.

68
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,000
- Looks good.
- Thank you.

69
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,200
What about... Is this OK?

70
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,560
It's a bit tight,
but I talked to the structural engineer...

71
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,040
- How's your boyfriend? Isn't his name Rick?
- Steve. He's good.

72
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,640
He just got back from Milan. Look at this.

73
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,840
- Milan?
- Yes, his new Joe Boxer ad campaign.

74
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,480
Wow. He's buff. Are you into that?

75
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,680
I would think this is more your style.
What do you think?

76
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,800
Two months in a gym, a personal trainer and
the right steroids, I look like that or better.

77
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,720
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

78
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,680
- What are you doing?!
- Huh?

79
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,360
Hey, Carla. Nothing. Just reshelving
some reference material, trying to stay ahead.

80
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,720
- You were staring at her butt.
- He was?

81
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,720
- No. No, I was not.
- Yes, he was.

82
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,720
Hannah, as you know, we have
a zero-tolerance policy for this behavior.

83
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,920
I actually read that memo twice. I got it.

84
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,080
You should be familiar with this part.

85
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,680
Would you like to file a grievance
at this time?

86
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,640
Um... I don't think so, Carla.

87
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,320
Because, as your supervisor, I am officially
giving you that opportunity right now.

88
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,400
And I thank you for that,
but I think I'm just gonna let this one slide.

89
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,000
That's completely your decision.

90
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,760
- Will you sign a statement to that effect?
- Sure. Yes.

91
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,880
You are lucky this time, Mr. Bottom Watcher.

92
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,280
- Hello?
- Matt? Hey. It's Jenny Johnson.

93
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,680
- Hey, Jenny. I wasn't sure I'd hear from you.
- So are we still on for dinner?

94
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,760
- Dinner? Absolutely. That sounds great.
- Is that a girl? A real, live girl?

95
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,760
A great new Indian place on Madison
just opened up. Eight o'clock?

96
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,720
Indian? Love it. I'll see you tomorrow night.

97
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,600
OK. Great. See you. Bye.

98
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,160
Saunders! Do you have a date?

99
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,360
Got a date. And it's a hot one.

100
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,680
So the assistant curator job's
really perfect for me.

101
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,920
I was an art history major in college.
It's the only thing I'm good at.

102
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,560
At least, the only thing I'm good at
I can make any money off.

103
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,760
- That sounded like I was talking about sex.
- No. No, it didn't.

104
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,040
Believe me, I didn't mean sex.

105
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,200
- I mean, I am good at sex.
- I'm sure you are.

106
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,520
- Now it sounds like I'm bragging.
- No, no.

107
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,080
I think I'm good at sex.
I don't know, you decide.

108
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,200
Me?

109
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,840
But not tonight. It's our first date.

110
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,240
Yeah.

111
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,240
So what do you do?

112
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,760
I'm a project manager at a design firm.

113
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,520
We design and build private estates,
libraries, hotels, that sort of thing.

114
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,320
Yeah, right now, we're...

115
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,360
- I'm sorry. Am I bothering you?
- What?

116
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,320
No. No. Um...

117
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,280
I was just trying to listen to something.

118
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,640
I don't hear anything.

119
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,440
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I have to go to the bathroom.

120
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,840
Sure.

121
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,400
- Yo, how's it going?
- Well, she's a talker, yeah.

122
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,680
<i>- Only question is, will you sleep with her?
- That's the only question, huh?</i>

123
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,160
Yes. I'm not just talking about your date
tonight. I am talking about life in general.

124
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,720
- That is the only question.
- What's going on there?

125
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,200
Uh, some big fire at 73rd and Broadway.
Everything's burning.

126
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,480
<i>- Is anyone hurt?
- I don't know. Probably.</i>

127
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,600
It's blocking my way to the gym.

128
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,880
My thoughts are with you
in this time of crisis.

129
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,840
Wow! Oh, man!

130
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,320
<i>- What's going on?
- It's G-Girl! She's doing her thing.</i>

131
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,040
Are you serious? You lucky SOB.
I've never even seen her in person.

132
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,120
How does she look?

133
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,000
She looks...

134
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,920
<i>- What?
- Blurry. But still pretty hot.</i>

135
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,920
<i>Yeah? What's she doing now?</i>

136
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,200
She's spinning around
like one of those things that spins.

137
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,040
<i>Amazing. That's unbelievable.</i>

138
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,400
Yeah. It's so cool.

139
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,400
Oh!

140
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,720
Yes. That's it, show's over.
She put the fire out. Fantastic.

141
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,480
G-Girl! G-Girl!
G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl!

142
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,920
Oh! OK.

143
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,720
And she's gone.
Flew off into the sunset. Amazing.

144
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,480
<i>Unbelievable. Hey, why do you think
they call her G-Girl?</i>

145
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,680
I don't know, like, "gorgeous" or "G-force"?
I'm not really sure.

146
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,000
<i>What do you think about "good kisser"?</i>

147
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,800
I can't believe I missed that.
I'm eating Indian food.

148
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,640
<i>Oh, wait, no, no. "Goddess woman".</i>

149
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,640
<i>- What about "G-spot"?
- I gotta go. Bye.</i>

150
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,560
Whoo!

151
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,400
Huge line. Sorry.
It was a really, really long line.

152
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,840
- You got a little something on your chin.
- What? Oh. Oh.

153
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,040
- I hate when that happens.
- When what happens?

154
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,120
Mystery smudges.

155
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,480
- Gotta go to the bathroom.
- Um... You didn't just go to the bathroom?

156
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,840
Are you keeping track? That's kind of creepy.

157
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,720
- She sounds like a nutcase.
- So you're saying she's perfect for me?

158
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,240
Crazy women are attracted to you.

159
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,080
It's like you give off a scent.

160
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,160
You should do a background check on her.

161
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,760
What do you think? Shall we
keep these walls brick or make it stucco?

162
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,240
- Did you kick the plug?
- I don't know.

163
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,760
- Let me handle this one.
- All right.

164
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,800
- Don't do that.
- Don't do what? What are you talking about?

165
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,400
You mean this?

166
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,760
Hey!

167
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,560
Sexual harassment's a two-way street. Don't
think cos I'm a guy you can manhandle me.

168
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,320
Hey! What the hell's going on here?

169
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,720
- Oh, no. Sorry, her...
- Steve.

170
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,480
Her computer had gone down.
I was plugging it back in.

171
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,560
- I'm screwing with you. I'm not worried.
- Oh. None taken.

172
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,600
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.

173
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,840
- Not here!
- Sorry.

174
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,280
See, Saunders? You need to be with someone
who appreciates you, like Steve here.

175
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,720
Yeah. I'm looking for Mr. Right.
Haven't found him yet, though. Not given up.

176
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,080
- Steve Ballard. Nice to meet you.
- This is Matt. You've met him, like, five times.

177
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,600
- Oh, right, right. Sorry.
- It's OK. I'm a very forgettable person.

178
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,520
When I was growing up, I'd come down
to breakfast and Mom would scream,

179
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,640
call the cops on me.

180
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,560
- It's a joke, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

181
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,960
- It's a good one. Got me back.
- Hey, baby, we should be going to lunch.

182
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,760
Hey, Saunders, that woman is trouble.
Do not call her.

183
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,400
- OK, we're done.
- What happened? We just started.

184
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,920
That's it. No. I got a twinge.

185
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,320
Dude, you should definitely call her back.

186
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,440
- Yeah? You think I should?
- Oh, yeah.

187
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,760
Cos she's good to go.

188
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,240
And you haven't gone in six months.

189
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,680
Oh, yes. Plus, what's the downside?

190
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,400
I don't know. She seems a little, uh...
She's neurotic, you know. And distant.

191
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,720
That's good. That's a good thing.
Neurotic and distant is a very good thing.

192
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,640
Yeah, neurotic women are hellcats in bed.

193
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,080
Plus, if she's distant,
you're both in it for the same thing.

194
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,160
Coitus maximus.

195
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,680
There's no, "Could she be the one? I'm falling
hard for her" kind of crap to get in the way.

196
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,360
It's just pure carnal nirvana.

197
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:49,280
- Your argument's repugnant and intriguing.
- That's kind of my thing.

198
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,760
- Oh, hey.
- Hi. Oh, wow. Thank you.

199
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,560
- You're welcome.
- A rose.

200
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,240
Different color roses mean different things.

201
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,320
Red ones mean passion or love,
so this is great.

202
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,520
But I'm not saying I think
you're telling me that you love me.

203
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,800
I mean, it's absurdly early for that.

204
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,600
But you never know. Maybe someday.

205
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,160
Or never. No pressure.

206
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,920
Let me get us a cab. Taxi.

207
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,320
Taxi!

208
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,880
Hey, it's stopping.

209
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,080
Here we go.

210
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,240
You OK?

211
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,960
At least we got a ride.

212
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,560
Can we stop by the gallery?
We opened a new show.

213
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,400
Sounds great.
Hey, thanks for stopping. Appreciate it.

214
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,280
Wow.

215
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,960
Wonder what she's looking at.

216
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,040
Ouch! That's gotta hurt.

217
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,960
So what do you think?

218
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,920
It's interesting. And a little disturbing.

219
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,760
I know. It's surprising
how frightening things attract us.

220
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:38,120
Matt, I have to help people every day,
and nobody's ever helped me except you.

221
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,200
You're my hero.

222
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,360
I'm sorry. What is it? Tell me.

223
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,480
It's your tongue. You're using it all wrong.

224
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,640
- What are you talking about?
- You shouldn't stick it out like a dead fish.

225
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,520
You're supposed to flick it a little.

226
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,800
I think that I was flicking it, wasn't I?
I was doing that.

227
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,400
- No. Not enough.
- Really?

228
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,760
I'm not used to having my tongue skills
critiqued like this, OK?

229
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,680
Maybe not to your face.

230
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,280
Oh, man.

231
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,760
Let me help you.

232
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,280
Close your eyes.

233
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,440
Now do what I do.

234
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,720
So, uh... this is my place.
I redesigned the space when I bought it.

235
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,520
- It's nice.
- Thank you.

236
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,360
This is the dining room.
Doesn't get a lot of use.

237
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,000
- Well, I could help with that.
- OK.

238
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,320
This is my fish. That's Biggie Smalls.

239
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,480
Hi, Biggie.

240
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,840
He's... he's never met a woman before.

241
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,280
Well, he's about to get an eyeful.

242
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,760
<i>- Will you show me the rest of your place?
- OK.</i>

243
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,400
<i>I'll take you over to the kitchen.</i>

244
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,240
<i>That's the refrigerator.
I can get you a juice, a beer.</i>

245
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,680
<i>I'll make you anything. Yeah.</i>

246
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,040
I'm not thirsty either.

247
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,800
- And this is the, uh...
- Bed.

248
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,520
Oh, that's a great sweater. Wow.

249
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,760
What a blouse.
Let me help with those buttons.

250
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,120
- I'm sorry. I need the, um...
- Oh, yeah. The bathroom? It's right there.

251
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,320
She goes to the bathroom a lot.

252
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,440
I'm ready.

253
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,280
That's what I call structural integrity.

254
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,600
All right! You should have
been dressed like that all night.

255
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,680
You look great.

256
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,560
Let me help you with this.

257
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,880
Ooh.

258
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,600
- I must be a little nervous.
- It's OK.

259
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,680
I got a closet full of 'em.
Let me handle this one, though.

260
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,040
- Let's take care of these.
- OK.

261
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,200
Thanks.

262
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,040
Who'd have thought we'd have ended up
like this after that day on the subway?

263
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,280
Ain't life grand?

264
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,600
- Matt?
- Yeah?

265
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,080
Do you mind if I get on top?

266
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,920
Trust me, it's better that way.

267
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,320
10-4.

268
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,200
Are you ready?

269
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,960
- OK.
- OK.

270
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,760
Here we go.

271
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,680
Wow.

272
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,960
OK, I get it.

273
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

274
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,040
Whoo! Whoo!

275
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,040
Oh, goddamn!

276
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,840
OK, now I need a break.

277
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,720
Agh!

278
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,280
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new one.

279
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,200
- A bed or a penis?
- Both.

280
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:00,040
There are three moments
I will remember until the day I die.

281
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,280
One, the look on my father's face
when I graduated from Harvard Law School.

282
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,600
Two, helping a beached
mother whale give birth.

283
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,120
And three,

284
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,320
you and me together, here, tonight.

285
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,000
Don't speak to me again, ever.

286
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,440
Uh-oh. Oh, no.

287
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,560
Water, please. Got a big night.

288
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,280
No, no, no.

289
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,840
Don't tell me. You have invaded the
female nation and spread your democracy.

290
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,280
What can I say? She's completely
different than I thought she was.

291
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,360
- Hot, though, right?
- Unbelievably hot.

292
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,440
I don't even know if I should tell you this.
I don't know if you can handle it.

293
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,240
I can handle it. Please?

294
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,800
- She broke my bed.
- Wow.

295
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,080
Busted it to pieces.

296
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,200
- And that's a good thing, right?
- Yeah. That's a good thing.

297
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,560
- I'm gonna see her again today.
- What are you talking about?

298
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,160
No! You have sex with her once
and then you move on.

299
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,720
Not if you get on the greatest ever roller
coaster, you don't. You get back in that line.

300
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,800
Get in line, ride two or three more times,
throw your hands in the air and scream.

301
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,960
But soon you're gonna end up nauseous.

302
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,960
Hey, guys.

303
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,080
- How are you guys doing?
- Keep that safety bar clamped down.

304
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,280
OK, I think you are gonna like this.
I have a little present for you, Saunders.

305
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,920
- Anything for me there?
- No. No, Vaughn.

306
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,840
- You have nice ears.
- Thank you.

307
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,600
- No lobes, though.
- An imperfection. We all got 'em.

308
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,520
Not me. Hey, so I downloaded some
Chinese phrases for you, for the presentation.

309
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,520
- What do you think? Thought it might help.
- That's great.

310
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,520
- I thought it would help.
- You're the best, you know that?

311
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,040
I know. I am.

312
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,800
Well, I gotta get going.
I'm going to see Jenny.

313
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,680
- You're seeing Jenny? Again?
- Yeah. Yeah.

314
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,720
- Oh. Things must really be going well.
- She broke his bed.

315
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,440
Thanks. That was really thoughtful of you.

316
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,240
- Oh, no problem.
- I'll see you two later.

317
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
- See you, Matt.
- Look after her, OK?

318
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,200
I will.

319
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,160
- Man, he's seeing Jenny again?
- Just a few more times.

320
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:24,120
- Matt Saunders? We're gonna take a ride.
- Wait a second! Hey! Wait!

321
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,480
Hey, now, look.
I don't appreciate being manhandled...

322
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,600
What's going on?

323
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,600
- Mr. Saunders, thank you for your time.
- OK. Now, who are you?

324
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,840
Who am I? Do you watch television,
Mr. Saunders? Read the papers?

325
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,120
- Use the net for anything other than porn?
- You're that Bedlam guy.

326
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,040
- Professor Bedlam.
- The "supervillain".

327
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,120
Please, I am not super, I am not a villain.
I'm just a regular man, like yourself,

328
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,280
with 10,000 times more money,
intelligence and taste.

329
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,280
OK, so what do you want from me?

330
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,880
Are you seeing anyone, Mr. Saunders?

331
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,960
Are you asking me out? Ow!

332
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,280
I want you to tell me everything you know
about your new girlfriend.

333
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,560
- Jenny?
- Yes. Jenny.

334
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,320
Where does she like to go?
What does she like to do?

335
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,280
What music does she listen to?
Is she afraid of bugs?

336
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,600
Is she a dog person or a cat person?

337
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,120
- Does she wear panties...
- OK, now, look. Hold on just a goddamn...

338
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,560
Now, look.
It's gotta stop with the slapping, all right?!

339
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:40,480
I just don't feel real comfortable telling you,
a total stranger, someone's private habits.

340
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,160
You gotta understand that, right?

341
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,920
Of course.

342
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Please, someone! Help! Help!

343
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,760
Save me! Please!

344
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,760
Weasel!

345
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,680
Hey! Help! Yeah, you! You!

346
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,960
Get somebody from the Park Service!

347
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,920
Oh, jeez!

348
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,360
No! Help me! Oh, no!

349
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,920
Oh, my God!

350
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,320
- G-Girl! G-Girl, you saved me. Thank you!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

351
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,880
- Whoa! Hold me! Hold me!
- Don't look at me!

352
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,080
- But I just wanted to...
- Don't look at me!

353
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,720
OK, yeah. No looking. Got you. Roger.

354
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,360
Wow.

355
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,520
Looks like little Jenny's
been cashing in on her superpowers.

356
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,840
Idiot! We don't want her to know
we dropped by.

357
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,840
Ah.

358
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,040
Perfect.

359
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,360
So I'm falling,
I mean, hurdling through the sky.

360
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,440
And just as I'm about to bite it,
and I mean out of nowhere,

361
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,880
she just catches me
and sets me right on the ground.

362
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,680
It was unbelievable.
The weird thing is, though,

363
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,360
that Bedlam guy,
he kept asking me about you.

364
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,000
- Do you know him?
- No, how could I know him?

365
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,840
- That's what I was thinking.
- So what was she like?

366
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,040
G-Girl?

367
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,680
I didn't really get a good look at her,
but to tell you the truth,

368
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,920
- she wasn't really what I expected, you know.
- In what way?

369
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,040
- I don't know. She just seemed a little...
- Brainy?

370
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,080
- Not really.
- Exotic? Effervescent?

371
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,600
No, I kind of got this vibe
she was a little nuts.

372
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,320
Nuts?! Maybe she was a little bit preoccupied,

373
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,760
having searched the entire city to save you

374
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,880
from being squished like a bug
on a windshield!

375
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,080
You girls all really stick together, don't you?

376
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,640
I like it. You're like one big gang.

377
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,840
- Rule number one about crossing the street?
- Look both ways.

378
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,680
That's right.

379
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,160
Jenny!

380
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,400
- One of you call 911!
- I'm fine. I'm fine. That was close.

381
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,120
I'm fine, I'm fine.

382
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,160
- You're not fine. How can you be fine?
- Look, Matt, I can walk.

383
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,760
Don't move. You probably have
internal bleeding and don't know it.

384
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,040
- No, not even a scratch.
- You are in shock.

385
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:05,520
Did anyone see this? It's like a miracle.
Truly, it's like a miracle.

386
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,200
I mean, are you sure that you're OK?
I mean, you seem to be walking fine.

387
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,600
Yeah.

388
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,320
This is the first time
that I've ever brought anybody here.

389
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,680
- Ever.
- Really? Wow.

390
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,600
Yeah, it seems like a really great place.

391
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,320
I'm still just kind of wondering
what the hell happened out there.

392
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,240
I know.

393
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,040
I didn't expect to do this.
At least, not yet anyway.

394
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,120
- But it's good. It's good.
- OK.

395
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:42,080
Cos what we have is so very, very special.

396
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,240
- I trust you.
- OK.

397
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,160
There should be nothing hanging between us.

398
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,040
Especially not this, don't you think?

399
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

400
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,760
I'll have to show you.

401
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,720
You look nice without your glasses.
You look good with them too.

402
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,360
I'll hold them for you.

403
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,360
OK...

404
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,440
I don't know what the explanation is,
but I like it already.

405
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,360
<i>Unless it's one of those Crying Game things?
It's not that, is it? I mean, I'm from Denver.</i>

406
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,080
Just wait.

407
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,040
You got a G-Girl costume on.
That's...

408
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,400
Kind of went all out, didn't you?

409
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,880
And you even dyed your...

410
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,000
Oh.

411
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,360
Wow!

412
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,400
Are you kidding me?

413
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,520
Oh, man. This is incredible.

414
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,880
- But you can't tell anyone!
- Yeah, nobody except Vaughn.

415
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,440
He slept with a Victoria's Secret model,
I've never heard the end of it.

416
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,080
- This will blow that out of the water.
- No! Nobody.

417
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,280
Matt, you have to promise me
you'll never, ever tell anyone.

418
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,200
<i>- Fine, you got it.
- No matter what, you will never tell anyone.</i>

419
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,320
Hey, I swear.

420
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,440
Say you'd rather have a chain saw
shoved up your ass than tell.

421
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,760
- Is that actually a possibility?
- Say it!

422
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,760
I'd rather have a chain saw
shoved up my ass than tell.

423
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,400
OK.

424
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,760
So this Bedlam guy, he's like
your arch nemesis or something?

425
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,440
Uh-huh. He's been a pain in the butt ever
since we had this falling out in high school.

426
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,760
- You guys went to school together?
- Mm-hm.

427
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,240
Wow.

428
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,160
By the way, his name's not really Bedlam.

429
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,640
It's Barry. Barry Edward Lambert.
Bedlam, get it?

430
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,800
<i>Back then, we were both kind of outcasts.
Everybody else hated us.</i>

431
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,080
Nerd alert! Here come the geeks.

432
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,440
<i>So we looked out for each other.</i>

433
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,040
<i>It's only natural
that we spent a lot of time together.</i>

434
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,520
<i>We really liked each other.</i>

435
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,680
<i>It was close to the end of our junior year</i>

436
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,440
<i>when I decided it was about time
to get the virginity thing over with.</i>

437
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,040
<i>I mean, Barry was harmless enough.</i>

438
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,000
<i>I figured it might as well be him, right?</i>

439
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,280
<i>He was having some trouble
getting his pants off.</i>

440
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,960
<i>And that's when it happened.</i>

441
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,440
Jenny!

442
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,080
Come on!

443
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,600
This is not how I planned this evening.

444
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,400
Oh, my God. Look at that.

445
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,080
It's so cool.

446
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:14,080
- What are you doing?
- Isn't it amazing?

447
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,160
Don't. It could be dangerous.

448
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,360
<i>When I got back to school,
even with a wig,</i>

449
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,440
<i>people noticed
there was something different about me.</i>

450
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,960
Hi, girls. Ooh, my glasses.

451
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,840
<i>And it worked for me.</i>

452
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,600
Hey.

453
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,920
Ugh!

454
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,400
<i>Unfortunately, Barry and I grew apart.</i>

455
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,680
<i>He stopped talking to me.</i>

456
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,000
<i>And then ignored me totally.</i>

457
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,440
Anyway, things got worse between us
after I graduated.

458
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,720
I committed to being a full-time superhero

459
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,720
and he fell into the evil mastermind business,
yada-yada-yada. That's my story.

460
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,120
Wow.

461
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,720
And this whole time,
I just had this weird feeling

462
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,320
that there was just something
a little off about you.

463
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,920
- Really?
- You just had a secret, that's all.

464
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,840
- A supersecret.
- Now we both do.

465
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,280
- May I ask you something?
- What?

466
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I just think it could
maybe be a fun thing to try.

467
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,640
It's kind of a request.

468
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,560
Sure.

469
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,520
- Be right back.
- OK.

470
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,040
Is this what you had in mind?

471
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,480
Oh, yeah. That's it.

472
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,680
Matt Saunders,
you've been a very, very evil boy.

473
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,280
I think you need to be brought to justice.

474
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,920
Yeah. I have been known
to bend a rule here and there.

475
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,800
Total unrelenting justice.

476
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,680
Hey! Wow! Shit!

477
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,800
- Don't let go, all right?
- Oh, no.

478
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,640
Oh, yeah, you got me.

479
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,440
Scared you.

480
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,120
Wow.

481
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,640
Wow, we are high.

482
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,640
- We are really, really high.
- Oh, yeah!

483
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,920
Jenny, you know, as fun as this is,
I'm feeling just a little bit emasculated here,

484
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,040
with you kind of carrying me around
like a toy poodle. But don't let go.

485
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,160
Careful. Where are you going?
Careful. Come on. Fly right.

486
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,960
Be careful.

487
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,280
- I've always wanted to try this.
- Try what?

488
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,600
That? Wow.
I'm not sure that's gonna work up here.

489
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,320
It's draughty too.

490
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,640
What if I do this?

491
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,720
- You're not wearing any underwear.
- Yeah. I thought it might be easier that way.

492
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,840
- Isn't this fun?
- It is fun. Yeah.

493
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,240
Puts a whole new twist on the mile-high club.

494
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
Ready?

495
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,440
Whoa. Not ready!

496
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,880
- No!
- Just go with it.

497
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,680
- Yeah, but...
- I know, I know! Don't stop! Yes.

498
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,840
- No!
- Yes!

499
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,040
- Oh, god, no!
- Yeah!

500
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,480
Jenny!

501
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,600
Yes!

502
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,920
Yes!

503
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,160
Don't ever do that again!

504
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,160
G-Girl's hair before.

505
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,560
Watch and learn.

506
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,640
Her body is made
of the toughest substance known to man.

507
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,280
But I know your secret.

508
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,800
All right, now. G-Girl's hair after.

509
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,040
Yes! Yes!

510
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,880
- Saunders, what's wrong?
- I got a splinter in my finger.

511
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,320
- Let me see.
- It's no big deal. I can get it out, I just need...

512
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,040
- Come here. I'm good at this.
- What are you gonna do?

513
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,640
Hold on.

514
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,680
Hey, how did you do that?

515
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Well, I have my ways.

516
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,640
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

517
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,800
Jenny, what...

518
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,040
What are you doing in New Jersey?

519
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,880
I called your office
and found out where you were.

520
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,600
I thought I would surprise you.

521
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,360
- Are you surprised?
- I am surprised. I wanted to...

522
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,160
Thanks. Good to see you.
Let me introduce you to Hannah Lewis.

523
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,800
- This is Jenny Johnson.
- Hi. It's really nice to finally meet you.

524
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,360
- Saunders talks about you all the time.
- I do.

525
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,800
- I feel like I already know you.
- Really?

526
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,720
Cos I feel like I'm just getting to know you.

527
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,000
OK. Hey, um... Got an idea.

528
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,000
Hannah and her boyfriend Steve, I was
thinking, maybe we go out this weekend,

529
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,320
just the two couples, two happy couples,
hit the town? What do you say?

530
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,040
- Great.
- Great.

531
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,480
Great.

532
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,200
Oh, OK.

533
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,200
Bye.

534
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,480
I'm sorry, guys. I have some bad news.

535
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,240
- You got a little something right there.
- Oh, thank you.

536
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,600
Steve can't make it.
He had an emergency thong shoot.

537
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,800
- A thong shoot emergency?
- Yeah, well, you know,

538
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,840
one bad wedgie can be fatal.

539
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,240
Yeah.

540
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,800
Where's our stupid waiter? Sir!

541
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,880
Hold on. Something's going on.

542
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,560
<i>The Pentagon has confirmed
an errant test missile</i>

543
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,720
<i>is in fact on a direct course
for the tristate area.</i>

544
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,000
<i>So far, all attempts to detonate or intercept
the missile have been unsuccessful.</i>

545
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,800
Great. Perfect.

546
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:35,200
<i>If it strikes within the city,
the death toll could reach into the thousands.</i>

547
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,960
- That does not sound good.
- Yeah, it sounds serious.

548
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,160
Maybe somebody should do something.

549
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,280
Mm-hm, yeah, like the air force.
It's their job, right?

550
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,320
So, Hannah, how long
have you and Matty known each other?

551
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,960
Well, we started working together at Cockrum
about three years ago.

552
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,800
<i>We're getting reports of sporadic
looting from the Bronx to Staten Island.</i>

553
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:04,600
<i>The government has urged people
not to panic and to stay in their homes.</i>

554
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,800
Mmm, gnocchi. Gnocchi sounds good.
Anyone want to share a gnocchi?

555
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,840
I'm sorry, but what if
the air force can't stop it?

556
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,000
Somebody else might need to step in.

557
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,000
Maybe somebody deserves one night out

558
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,720
without having to deal
with some impending disaster.

559
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,640
I think someone has earned it. Don't you?

560
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,520
Are you on a diet?
What are you gonna order?

561
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,920
I don't know. I mean, shouldn't
we be leaving? Is this safe here?

562
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,440
Sir! Can we get some service here?
I mean, I'm filling up on baguette.

563
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,600
I think everybody's preoccupied
with what's happening.

564
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,560
Maybe if someone
could just take care of the problem,

565
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,240
everyone can have a better night,
a smoother night, know what I mean?

566
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,480
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

567
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,760
In fact, I'd superappreciate it.

568
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,840
All right. Fine!

569
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,280
Is she OK? Where is she going?

570
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,680
She's fine. She gets stressed.
I have her looping around the block.

571
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,960
<i>Too late for a mass evacuation, the situation
is dangerous and potentially catastrophic.</i>

572
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,160
<i>But all the citizens of New York can do
is sit, wait and pray for a miracle.</i>

573
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:36,440
<i>We're now getting a live picture of the missile
as it approaches the city.</i>

574
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,600
<i>It appears certain that... Wait, what is that?</i>

575
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,880
<i>It is G-Girl!</i>

576
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,760
<i>- She is approaching the errant missile.
- Love that girl!</i>

577
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,320
<i>My God!</i>

578
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,800
<i>She just kicked it.</i>

579
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:00,920
<i>She just deflected the missile
away from the city.</i>

580
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,000
<i>We're safe! We are safe!</i>

581
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,320
G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl!

582
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,960
You know, Matt, there are some things
I don't need infravision to see through.

583
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,760
Sorry, what are you talking about?

584
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,240
You and that slut from your office - Hannah.

585
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:50,360
She is not a slut.
That is a terrible thing to say, Jenny.

586
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,120
- You want to screw her, don't you?
- No. No, I do not.

587
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,960
I don't believe you.

588
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,040
Can I say something?

589
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,080
Her boyfriend's a male model, OK? A model.

590
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,960
I don't think she'd be very interested
in a guy like me.

591
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,760
I see your point.

592
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,280
So you want to screw her, you just can't,
because she's got a boyfriend.

593
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,680
No, I'm just saying that we're friends
who work together. We're work friends.

594
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,840
Don't lie to me!

595
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,640
- What the hell did you do that for?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

596
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,560
I'll pay for that, I swear.

597
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,920
OK, don't... d-don't do that.

598
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,720
Don't cry, OK? It'll be OK.

599
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,280
I know I get a little crazy sometimes.

600
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,160
It's just...

601
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,360
I love you so much.

602
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,000
OK... OK...

603
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,720
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

604
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,880
Oh, sorry.

605
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,720
Look at her. She's like a cheerleader
from Spank Me University.

606
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,560
Dude, what's wrong?
You look like shit.

607
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,480
Let's go with the lighter weight today,
shall we?

608
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,120
I'm actually thinking that
my first impression of Jenny was accurate.

609
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:39,600
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, complete emotional basket case.

610
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,160
- Needy, jealous...
- Mm-hm. Jealous.

611
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,320
...control...
- Controlling. A trifecta. Perfect.

612
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,880
The truth is, I don't even love her.

613
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,080
I'm in love with somebody else.

614
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,320
You're in love with somebody else? Who?

615
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,720
Is it me? Oh, my God, it's me, isn't it?

616
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,080
I feel the same way. I totally...

617
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,200
That's not a good sign, is it?

618
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,880
- Who are you talking about?
- I don't wanna say. Not until I've told her.

619
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,520
But, I mean, first I have
to break it off with Jenny.

620
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,080
- God knows how I'm gonna do that.
- OK, come with me. Listen.

621
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,120
There are only two ways to successfully
break it off with a woman.

622
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,760
You can either be a jerk or a weenie.

623
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:27,240
Now, the jerk route is simple. You're like,
"Hey, babe, listen up. I'm dumping your ass."

624
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,160
Just like that. It's quick, it's easy, it's painless.

625
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,160
- I don't think you have the balls for it.
- Well, what's the weenie route?

626
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,240
OK, good. Weenie route. Let's go with that.

627
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,640
Sit real close, keep it romantic, OK?

628
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:46,200
Keep a kind of a sparkle in the eye,
take her hand. Give me your hand.

629
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,680
You say, "Sweetheart,

630
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,120
I think we need to take a little time off
from the relationship to re-evaluate things."

631
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,680
Don't return any of her calls
for a year and a half.

632
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,840
Pretty soon she'll give up
and you'll be in the clear.

633
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,080
I can't believe I actually listen to you.

634
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,440
Another thing. Make sure you do it
after you've had sex with her.

635
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,480
It's really difficult the other way around.

636
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,640
I was thinking, maybe we should
take a little time to...

637
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,840
re-examine where this is going.

638
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,080
My God.

639
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,440
Are you breaking up with me?

640
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,800
No. No. Not at all.

641
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:49,440
I mean, I just... I think it would be wise
to try and evaluate where we stand,

642
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,560
just to make sure we're on the same page.

643
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:00,080
So you're not saying that we should
start seeing other people or anything?

644
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,560
No. No.

645
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,120
No, I'm not saying that.

646
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,720
OK, good. You scared me there for a second.

647
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:16,480
Although seeing other people might
eventually be a part of the evaluation process.

648
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,360
Oh, my God.

649
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,720
You are breaking up with me.

650
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,360
- Jenny, it's not you, OK?
- Shut up!

651
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,600
I know exactly what it is.
It's that slut from your office, Hannah.

652
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,080
- You're sleeping with her.
- I am not sleep...

653
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,800
- But you want to!
- Jenny, now, hold on a second, OK?

654
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,440
You're such a liar!

655
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,840
Look, I am not a liar, all right? You wanna
know the truth? It's not Hannah, OK? It's you.

656
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,480
You're needy, jealous, manipulative.
I can't take it anymore.

657
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,040
- It's crazy.
- Don't call me crazy!

658
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:09,200
See? That's the kind of thing I'm talking
about. I can't handle that on a daily basis.

659
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,520
Well, handle this.

660
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:17,040
What are you doing?!

661
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,200
You are so gonna regret this.

662
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,960
Oh, man.

663
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,520
- Wednesday? Thursday?
- No. No.

664
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,720
Friday? Saturday? Sunday?
Brunch? In the day?

665
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,040
Don't speak to me.

666
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,040
Oh, well. Look at it this way.

667
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,360
The hard part is over.

668
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,160
I don't know. She said I'd regret it.

669
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,600
Don't worry about that. They always say that.

670
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,440
Yeah?

671
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,320
I guess you're right.

672
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:12,120
You know, there's something that I've been
dying to tell you ever since I found it out.

673
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,880
- Found out what?
- I just need you to promise me...

674
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,880
- I promise.
- Hold on, let me finish, this is serious.

675
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:24,920
- I need you to promise me that you're not...
- I promise. I won't tell anybody. Tell me.

676
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,000
You know Jenny?

677
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,880
Yeah.

678
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,160
She's G-Girl.

679
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,920
Bullshit.

680
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,200
Bullshit.

681
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,320
Apparently, this old dog
still has a few tricks left.

682
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,400
Oh, my God, you have been doing G-Girl!

683
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,120
- I know! It's unbelievable. Me.
- Incredible.

684
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,920
- I can't believe it.
- Knuckles.

685
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,920
Imagine the heat I'll have
with the women when they find out.

686
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,880
Wait. Whoa. Isn't she gonna mind
you revealing her secret identity?

687
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,480
I warned you, Matt Saunders!

688
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,720
No!

689
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,560
Watch it, dumb-ass!

690
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,760
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

691
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,880
What could be wrong?
Everything's great. Never better.

692
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,480
Tell me.

693
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,920
OK. I, uh... I broke up with Jenny.

694
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,560
You were right. I mean, she is
totally deranged, off-her-rocker crazy.

695
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,800
I should have listened to you
from the beginning.

696
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,880
Why don't you lay off
the crazy women for a while, huh?

697
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,560
Come here. I'm sorry.

698
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,400
Hey, Hannah.

699
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,160
There's been something that I've been
meaning to tell you for a long time.

700
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,240
Yes?

701
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,760
It's about you and...

702
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,760
- Sorry. Are you OK?
- Out. Now.

703
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,960
I'm going through a weird phase.

704
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,400
- I saw that!
- What? No, it was nothing, Carla.

705
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,000
Nothing? You knocked her down! You hit her!

706
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:43,160
- Was there groping? Did he grope you?
- No, it was an accident.

707
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,240
An accident? OK, like a fender-bender?

708
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,080
Here, we need to talk. Come here.

709
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,600
Listen, my friend.
You are headed for some serious trouble.

710
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,640
- Don't make excuses. That's the first mistake.
- OK.

711
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,960
You have got to get your mind out of the
gutter long enough to nail this presentation.

712
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,480
- I hear you, homegirl. I got it.
- What? What did you just call me?!

713
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,760
What? I don't know.

714
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:11,440
If the company doesn't get this project,
we're going to take a major hit.

715
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,440
You really have a problem. Call my therapist.

716
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,320
OK, I'll call him... her.

717
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,120
- Matt.
- What?

718
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,840
- Phone call.
- Oh, man.

719
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:27,560
That boy has a major case of the hornies.

720
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,680
Yeah?

721
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,120
There's the young kid that zooms around
in here. Did he do something?

722
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,880
- It's just up here.
- Looks like they broke in, fried the camera

723
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,160
and then blew a huge hole
through the wall.

724
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,480
- I've never seen nothing like it.
- Don't make no sense.

725
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,360
We got a lot of nice cars -
his is the only one they took.

726
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,080
Bitch.

727
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:52,880
Somebody went to a lot of trouble.
You know who could have done this?

728
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,280
No. No, I don't.

729
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:00,680
- Somebody with a grudge against you?
- Grudge? Against me?

730
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,200
No. No, I don't. I'm sorry.

731
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,480
- We'll let you know if it turns up.
- OK.

732
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:11,200
- Let's get to the paperwork.
- I wouldn't hold my breath on that, sir.

733
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,080
Gentlemen...

734
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,080
If you look closely, our model here...

735
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:21,320
What the hell...?

736
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,160
Oh, that's just great.

737
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,800
Oh, shit! I just got that fixed.

738
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:36,360
Sorry, just came to use your telescope.
Nice and dark, isn't it?

739
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,160
Wait a second. Is this all because of you?

740
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,080
Yep, that'd be me. Ah, yes.

741
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,280
There we go.

742
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,080
Come and have a look-see.

743
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,840
I don't see any...

744
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,720
- That's real mature.
- Save you a fortune in parking.

745
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,880
Why are you doing this to me?
I mean, you're supposed to be the good guy.

746
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,800
I am the good guy. You are the bad guy.

747
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,600
It's been a pleasure seeing you,
but I got a big day at the office tomorrow.

748
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,520
I've got an important presentation to make,
so I need to get some sleep.

749
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:26,600
I'm gonna have to say good night. You might
be the hottest girl I've ever gone out with,

750
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,520
but you wanna know something?
You're the craziest, hands down!

751
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,840
- Really?
- Aargh!

752
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,520
Dick?!

753
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,880
Will we begin soon?

754
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,480
I'm so sorry you've been kept waiting.
I apologize. It's very rude.

755
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,760
Just a few more minutes, please.

756
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,160
- Hi. Excuse me, hi.
- Glad you could join us.

757
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,840
Can you tell me why you're wearing a hat?

758
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,520
- No.
- Why am I not surprised?

759
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,920
- Hi. How are you?
- We can finally begin.

760
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,480
- Gentlemen, I give you Matt Saunders.
- You OK?

761
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,000
I'm fine. I'm fine.

762
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,160
OK, gentlemen...

763
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,960
OK. Our design integrates
classic architectural ideas

764
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
from the history of Chinese culture

765
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:40,640
and transforms them
into a contemporary 21st century esthetic.

766
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:47,040
But you can see clearly
that functionality has not been sac...

767
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,560
Sac...

768
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:57,080
Sacrificed, as you can see here
by the multiple entrances to the central

769
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,680
multipurpose courtyard area.

770
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,080
Exactly. Exactly. Right.

771
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:06,360
And with a total capacity for...

772
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,360
You are one sick bastard!

773
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,200
Oh, man. I am so, so sorry.

774
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,720
Thanks.

775
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,240
- You gotta laugh to keep from crying, right?
- Vaughn, shh!

776
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,720
Sorry.

777
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,400
<i>Man, no woman's ever done that to me,
and I actually am a dick.</i>

778
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,560
OK, all done.
I am so sorry that you got fired.

779
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,960
What happened in there?
Why did you...

780
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,960
It's hard to explain.
Let's just say it's a good time for me to leave.

781
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,120
- Where are you going?
- Don't know. Don't care.

782
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:06,120
Look, if there's something wrong,
I'd like to help.

783
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:12,840
Look, Hannah. Please just stay
as far away from me as possible, OK?

784
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,080
If something were to happen to you
because of me,

785
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:20,840
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

786
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,800
Oh, damn!

787
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,840
May we come in?

788
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,640
Nice place.

789
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,360
You broke her heart, didn't you?

790
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,680
What do you need? Why are you here?
I'm in the middle of a project.

791
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,320
The same as you -
to get her out of my life for good.

792
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,680
I want you to help me neutralize her.

793
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:08,880
Hey, whatever she's done to me,
I'm not gonna help you kill her.

794
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,520
I didn't say "kill", I said "neutralize".

795
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,800
It's a neutral word.
"Kill" is "kill". This is Switzerland.

796
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:21,600
I have developed the means
of permanently stripping her of her powers.

797
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,200
No powers?

798
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:28,480
So she'd just be another average,
everyday, run-of-the-mill, crazy ex-girlfriend?

799
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,480
Yeah. That's gotta be better.

800
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:36,040
- So what would you want me to do?
- Draw her out into the open.

801
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,240
Help me get her when her guard is down,
when she's vulnerable.

802
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,880
Look, I don't mean to offend you,
but you have a reputation for doing things

803
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,320
that most people would consider to be...

804
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,080
No-nos?

805
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,320
Yes.

806
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:53,480
Yeah. Nothing to worry about. I'm retiring.

807
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,720
- From supervillainy?
- Yeah.

808
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,960
That's good. Look, if you're going to retire,
why not just forget about her?

809
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,520
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm leaving town.

810
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:08,960
Because that woman, she just won't
leave me alone. She's obsessed with me.

811
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,880
She has harassed me at every turn
and she never, ever stops.

812
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:19,920
So when you finally realize that she is not the
woman who is ever going to forget about you,

813
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,800
- then you give me a call.
- OK.

814
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,560
All right?

815
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,480
Or you can email me
at "professorbedlam.com".

816
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,800
It's all one word.

817
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:41,840
I think I'll just, uh... give running away a try.

818
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,360
<i>It's Matt.
Please leave a message.</i>

819
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,680
<i>Matt, it's Hannah.
Are you there? Please pick up.</i>

820
01:02:54,720 --> 01:03:00,000
<i>I... I need your help.
Something really bad's happened.</i>

821
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:05,960
<i>- Oh, God, I guess you're not there. Bye.
- Hannah!</i>

822
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,760
Who is it?

823
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,480
It's me, Matt. Open up.

824
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,440
Hannah. Are you OK?
What did she do to you? Is she here?

825
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,280
- Is who here?
- G-Girl!

826
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,840
G-Girl? Like the superhero?

827
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,200
Yeah, G-Girl the super...

828
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,640
Why did you call me?

829
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
- Steve was cheating on me.
- Oh, thank God.

830
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,400
What?

831
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,400
Thank God that you found out
sooner rather than later.

832
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,160
I am sorry.

833
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,960
Yeah, I caught him in bed
with another woman.

834
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,600
Actually, two other women.

835
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:11,000
Maybe three.
I don't know - I didn't really get a good look.

836
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:14,160
- Three?
- Yeah.

837
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,000
Wow.

838
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:20,320
Steve was so good-looking
and he loved jazz and rock-climbing.

839
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,760
He took me to nice places
and gave me multiple...

840
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:27,120
I don't really need to hear that.

841
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:36,200
The thing is,
I never really had any fun with him.

842
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,360
Not like I have with you.

843
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:44,840
You've been
a really good friend to me, Saunders.

844
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,360
Hannah, the thing is,

845
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,480
I don't wanna be just a friend any more.

846
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,800
- You don't?
- No.

847
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,400
Look...

848
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:03,160
Hannah, my life has been really crazy lately.

849
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,200
But it has made me realize
what's most important to me.

850
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:11,800
Seeing you at work every day, that was
always the thing I looked forward to the most.

851
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:18,040
You're the smartest,
most beautiful girl that I've ever met.

852
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:23,240
And I'm completely
and totally in love with you.

853
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,480
Oh.

854
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:48,120
Oh, that was great. Didn't hurt at all.

855
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:55,280
I probably shouldn't tell you this,
but this might be the best moment of my life.

856
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,120
That's not fair. I was gonna say that.

857
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,640
Oh.

858
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,600
Hey! Sweetie!

859
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,320
Matt?

860
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,560
I hate you, Matt Saunders!

861
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,160
Get down!

862
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:55,560
Why did G-Girl throw a shark at us?

863
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,800
I can't tell you.

864
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,920
And she was so pissed off.
Have you done something?

865
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,440
- Are you in trouble?
- No. Well, yeah.

866
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,720
And as long as I'm here, so are you.

867
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,480
You gotta get outside the city.
Go someplace and hide.

868
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,400
San Diego. Tahiti. Utah.

869
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,920
No, not Utah, Utah sucks. Anywhere else.

870
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,600
But you gotta go someplace,
lay low for a while.

871
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,200
- I don't understand.
- Look.

872
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:26,240
If I ever see you again,
this will all be over, OK?

873
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,480
If?

874
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,520
Matt, wait.

875
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:06,240
- Oh, it's you.
- Come in. Wait here.

876
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,880
- Right here? Where?
- What? Right here.

877
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,240
- OK.
- Over there.

878
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,120
Wow.

879
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:42,160
Look, I'm here cos I need your help, OK?
I just need to know how we're gonna stop her.

880
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:47,880
I have spent the past ten years trying
to analyze the source of G-Girl's power.

881
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,240
It is a unique type of radiation
that permeates every cell of her body.

882
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:56,120
Yeah, I know about the meteor in high school.
She told me. I know.

883
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,120
- She told you that?
- Yeah.

884
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,600
Did she talk about me?

885
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,120
I mean, she said you guys were friends,
you had a falling out.

886
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,440
Bullshit! That meteorite
changed everything between us.

887
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:16,360
But now, I've got something
that will totally level the playing field.

888
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,840
That?

889
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,560
The rock?

890
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,480
No, the ham. Yes, the rock.

891
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,680
A special rock.
It was a rock that gave off the radiation.

892
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:36,320
I now have a rock
that will absorb the radiation.

893
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,920
So if you got Jenny
close enough to this thing...

894
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,040
It'll draw the radiation from her body,
sucking it out of her like a sponge.

895
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,560
Draining her of her powers permanently.

896
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,720
OK, so what do you need me for?
Why can't you just get her close to it?

897
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,440
With that superhearing of hers?

898
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,920
No, I need someone who can lure her to it.

899
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,600
Someone who she has no cause to fear.

900
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,560
A weak and powerless simpleton.

901
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,240
An idiot.

902
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:24,480
No, all of these invoices were
returned. None of them have been paid.

903
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,200
Call back.

904
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:32,880
And these two are supposed to be...

905
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,840
Hi.

906
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,240
Hi.

907
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,600
What's this?

908
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,440
It's just a little something
I thought I'd bring by...

909
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,200
- Flowers?
- Yeah.

910
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:53,080
You think flowers
are going to make me forgive you?

911
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,920
No. No, I do not think that.
I don't think that at all.

912
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,200
Then what the hell are you doing here?

913
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:06,880
OK, look. To be honest, I realize that
I've made the biggest mistake of my life.

914
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:14,600
I'm desperately in love with you and I'd
do anything for us to be together again.

915
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,080
I would.

916
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,920
Oh, God.

917
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,920
They're beautiful.

918
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,600
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

919
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,640
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

920
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:44,320
What do you think about today after work
you come by my place around seven

921
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:50,200
- and I'll make us a nice dinner?
- Seven? I'd love to.

922
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,000
Matt?

923
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,960
Matt?

924
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,480
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, Jenny.

925
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,680
Matt, it's beautiful.

926
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,720
Oh, what is that? Is that for me?

927
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,280
It is. It's a little something I got you cos...

928
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,720
I wanna apologize
for the terrible way that I've treated you.

929
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:44,160
- It just wasn't right.
- You're so sweet. You didn't have to.

930
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,520
- It's true, I'm sorry.
- What is it?

931
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:51,000
No peeking, OK? I want it
to be a surprise. Let's have a toast.

932
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,640
You are amazing.

933
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:57,280
<i>To second chances.</i>

934
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:01,160
<i>To second chances.</i>

935
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:06,280
The man's not bad.
He might have a future in our business.

936
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,560
You know, deep down,

937
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:13,160
I had a feeling that you'd realize
your mistake and come back to me.

938
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,120
You are wise.

939
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:21,640
- Do you wanna know a secret?
- Sure.

940
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:27,520
That's why I didn't kill you.

941
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,920
Matt?

942
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,640
You are the sweetest guy I've ever met.

943
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:57,480
- Oh, no, no, I'm not.
- Yes, yes, you are.

944
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,080
You're sweet.

945
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,520
Yummy.

946
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,600
Matt?!

947
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,480
What are you doing here?

948
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,040
Me?! What are you doing here?

949
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,360
<i>You said your life was in danger.
And what's she doing here?</i>

950
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,360
- Who's that? Do we know her?
- I don't know her.

951
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,600
I don't know her.

952
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:22,720
You know how you tried to steal my
boyfriend by being such a big, fat whore?

953
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:25,320
- It didn't work.
- Jenny, stop. Let me handle this.

954
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,800
- Are you back with her?
- No.

955
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,880
- What?
- Yeah.

956
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,920
Look, it's very complicated, OK?

957
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,720
How could you do this?
You told me you loved me.

958
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:37,640
Hannah, please, just do me a favor, OK?
Just leave.

959
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,760
I mean, just try to have a little self-respect.
You're starting to look pathetic.

960
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:47,360
Matt! You are not... Oh, my God. There you
are. Thank God. I've been calling you all day.

961
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,040
Playoff tickets. Amazing seats. You and me.

962
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,720
- Not now.
- Tonight. Third base line. Yahoo!

963
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:56,120
- Now is a terrible time, OK?
- Hey, what's in the box?

964
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:00,680
- Stay away from that box.
- You know, Hannah,

965
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,640
why don't you just run along before I have
to kick your ass back to Munchkin Land?

966
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,640
- Stay away from it.
- It looks big, it might be a nice present.

967
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,520
- Are you threatening me?
- Push me one more time and you'll find out.

968
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:15,720
Oh, yeah? What are you going to do?
Squash me with your gigantic feet?

969
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,880
- That's it!
- Don't touch me!

970
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,760
Just do me a favor and leave
and take Hannah with you...

971
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,640
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! You're G-Girl.

972
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:31,800
You have been doing G-Girl?

973
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:37,400
- Vaughn, open the box!
- Go! Go! Go! Watch the van!

974
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,720
Open the damn box!

975
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,080
Aargh!

976
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,480
- It's not much of a present.
- Agh!

977
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:49,200
I'm sorry.

978
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,960
You bastard!

979
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,520
Matt, that's a weird rock.

980
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,920
Ah.

981
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:09,960
A happy ending for everybody.
Well done, Mr. Saunders.

982
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,800
You did this? You helped him?

983
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:17,200
I'm really sorry.
You did throw a shark at me, you know.

984
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:21,840
Besides, Bedlam's gonna retire. It'll be OK.

985
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,560
You idiot!

986
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,680
Looks like you're done, honey.

987
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:33,360
You always thought
you were so much better than me.

988
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,240
Now it's my turn.

989
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,480
Now I'll be the one with the powers.

990
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:42,480
You'll be just plain old Jenny Johnson.

991
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,400
We're having a moment here.

992
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:53,360
- Not so tough now, huh?!
- Hannah, don't let her touch the rock!

993
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,360
Hannah!

994
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,880
Oh, no! Hannah!

995
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,480
I can't even see her. We gotta get down there.

996
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,080
Oh, man!

997
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,440
I think she's dead, Matt.

998
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,200
- I'm sorry. Let her go.
- We gotta dig her out!

999
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:26,520
- We gotta start the grieving process.
- Are you crazy?

1000
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,920
- Come here. Give me a hug, bear cub.
- You!

1001
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,600
I thought you were just a jerk!

1002
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,960
Now I find out you're really stupid.

1003
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,600
Teaming up with Barry?!

1004
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:50,640
You broke my heart
and now I'm gonna break your everything.

1005
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,800
Hey!

1006
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,440
Let go of my boyfriend, you crazy bitch!

1007
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:01,120
Bring it!

1008
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,120
Oh, man!

1009
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,200
Yes, girl fight!

1010
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,720
Stupid!

1011
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,440
Matt!

1012
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,360
No!

1013
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,560
Hannah!

1014
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,040
Hannah, are you OK?

1015
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,560
Oh, no!

1016
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,040
You rat!

1017
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:48,000
Oh, Matt. Matt, Matt, are you OK?

1018
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,840
Uh-oh.

1019
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,280
Wow!

1020
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,480
Hannah, stop. Come on, stop.

1021
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,000
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

1022
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,160
I'm fine too. I thought I twinged my knee,
but I'm all right.

1023
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:27,840
Come on. Forget about them. Let's go.

1024
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,440
Come on.

1025
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:36,960
They're gonna kill each other. This way.

1026
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:40,680
- Hey, it's you.
- Are you with them?

1027
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,720
As a matter of fact, I am.

1028
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:47,240
They went down there.

1029
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,960
Stop!

1030
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:12,000
Look at yourself.
You're terrifying these people.

1031
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:18,080
Jenny... Jenny,
this has gotta stop right now, OK?

1032
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,600
Please.

1033
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:22,040
Just give me that, OK?

1034
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,560
There you go. Just give it to me.

1035
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:29,280
Wow. That was a lot heavier than I thought.

1036
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,400
Hi.

1037
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:36,120
Look, God knows
I don't want you mad at me, OK?

1038
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:38,640
And I'm sorry if I ever hurt you.

1039
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:42,640
And yeah, I know what we had
was something special.

1040
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,960
And at times it was great.

1041
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:51,000
But it wasn't love, all right?
And deep down, you know that.

1042
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:56,280
You're a great girl.
And you deserve to be with the perfect guy.

1043
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,040
- You do.
- I do.

1044
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:03,320
And I know who the perfect guy for you is.
And he's here, right here, right now.

1045
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,080
Professor.

1046
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,880
- What?
- Barry?

1047
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,480
- Go on, Professor, tell her.
- Tell her what?

1048
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,320
She's my mortal enemy?
I want nothing but her destruction?

1049
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:21,360
- Come on, Barry, please.
- Please stop calling me Barry.

1050
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:25,080
It's true. This guy,
he's got a shrine to you in his house.

1051
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:28,760
There are pictures of you
all over the walls, just of you.

1052
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:33,040
This guy, he is hooked on you.
He really is.

1053
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:36,000
Is that true?

1054
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:46,560
Come on. You gotta open your heart to her.
It's now or never.

1055
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:50,280
It may be a little true.

1056
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:56,160
OK, OK, that's a good start.
Come on, Barry. Barry, come on.

1057
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,760
All right, all right!

1058
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,240
It's completely true.

1059
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:04,840
I love you.

1060
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,720
I've always loved you.

1061
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:12,200
But if you love me so much, then how come
you're always trying to hurt me?

1062
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:17,400
Because you hurt me. Because you
broke my heart into a billion pieces.

1063
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,240
You ignored me.

1064
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:23,600
You left me behind.

1065
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:29,840
So I thought if I had the powers,
you may learn to love me

1066
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:34,120
the way I have always loved you.

1067
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,160
Are you sure?

1068
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,120
Do you really love me?

1069
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:49,280
Oh, yeah.

1070
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:03,240
It's over. Can you believe it?
I'm free. You were great.

1071
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,800
I can't believe that fight.

1072
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,840
I still think she'd kick my butt,
but I got a few good punches in.

1073
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,880
You saved my ass in there.
You were wonderful.

1074
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:14,000
And I'm really sorry
I didn't explain things to you sooner,

1075
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:18,480
- but I was just trying to protect you.
- I totally understand.

1076
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,640
Good.

1077
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,600
- Oh, my God, my hair.
- Oh, it doesn't look that bad. You can fix it.

1078
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,560
Here, try this on.

1079
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,080
Thanks.

1080
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,200
See? Adorable.

1081
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,480
- Yes, you are.
- No, not me.

1082
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,240
- Come here.
- Agh!

1083
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,000
- Tight.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1084
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:41,640
- It's OK.
- I'm still getting used to all of this.

1085
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:47,480
You and me both. And you know, we're going
to have to talk about the relationship too.

1086
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,280
- Talk? You mean...
- Your powers.

1087
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:56,040
Just cos you have 'em doesn't mean
you have to use 'em, you know what I mean?

1088
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,120
You're a little scared of me.

1089
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:02,000
What? Scared?
No, come on, I'm not scared at all.

1090
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,720
Come here.

1091
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,600
Are you ready?

1092
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:18,200
Yeah! I am. I'm ready.

1093
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:21,880
OK. Here we go.

1094
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:29,400
OK, all right, I got it.

1095
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:40,760
- Hold on, I think I tweaked something.
- Oh, you poor baby.

1096
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,880
What the hell were you doing?!

1097
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,840
Sorry. Sorry.

1098
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,040
Oh.

1099
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:14,000
I brought it down for you.
Peace offering.

1100
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:20,280
You've done so much for us.
We couldn't be happier.

1101
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,840
- How...? How...?
- Asteroids.

1102
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,520
Most of that will just buff right out.

1103
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,240
- I'll fix that.
- I could trick it out for you.

1104
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,680
Rocket launchers, laser cannons,
voice-activated battle armor.

1105
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,920
Do you hear something?

1106
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,360
- No.
- There's a 747 in trouble.

1107
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,920
It's a 727. Time to go to work.

1108
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,080
You need a hand?

1109
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:51,640
- A hand?
- Yeah, any help?

1110
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:54,400
I never had any help.

1111
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,960
- Could be some heavy lifting.
- Yeah?

1112
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,840
- OK.
- Yeah? Really?

1113
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:03,000
- Yes.
- Yes! All right! Whoo!

1114
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,440
OK, ready. Whoo! Here I go.

1115
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,080
Yeah!

1116
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:22,080
- Love you, honey!
- We'll be waiting!

1117
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:26,200
What are we gonna do with this stuff?
Wanna get a beer?

1118
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,760
- Sure.
- Let's do it.

1119
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:29,200
My God! You really do have superpowers.

1120
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,080
Yeah. Well, it helps
when you haven't used them

1121
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:38,680
in two years, three months,
one week and four days.

1122
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:44,400
OK, now. I got one more in me. Here we go.

1123
