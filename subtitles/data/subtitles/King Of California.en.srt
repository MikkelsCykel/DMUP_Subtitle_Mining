Technically, what happened wasn't my fault.

- We gotta stick with the plan.
- No!

8
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:58,251
But these things should be taken
on a case-by-case basis.

9
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,589
In our case, I've always
been the responsible party.

Um, but instead of the Coke

I want a McFlurry

When my father went away,
I lived alone in our house.

Which was not exactly normal,
but at least I had a routine.

I could never exactly get comfortable

The boat stops outside
the maritime limit,

00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,889

in plastic bags,

It would've been easier
if we'd just sold the house,

44
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,909
because the way
the market was,

45
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,572
we would've cleaned up.

46
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,014
But Charlie grew up
in our house;

47
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,584
he refused to leave.

48
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,311
Even though we were
barely getting by.

49
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,921
Before I was born, he had
already lived several lives

50
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,659
and managed to avoid
fatherhood for a lot of years.

took him by surprise.

Once, when things went south
for Charlie in Saint Louis,

He said that everything
really started to go wrong after that.

And they didn't start going right again
until he found it two years later

in a pawn shop in Atlanta.

Pepper ate so many pancakes
at a Denny's that the busboys

had to unbolt the table

were considered heretical.

But that's not
what's important.

378
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,400
The thing that matters here
is that he was more accustomed

to communicating
with numbers than words.

- Oh.

Anyway, I noticed that some
of the passages repeated themselves.

I read the book again,
and sure enough they did.

I just wasn't thinking.

643
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,160
You never do.

644
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,397
Well, I'll get it back.

645
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,598
- How are you going to do that?
- I don't know.

646
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,696
But I will.

647
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,332
Well, I guess I'd better
get a move on

648
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,172
since I'm going
to have to take the bus.

649
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,042
Can't you get a friend
to give you a ride?

650
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,946
I don't have any friends.

651
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,849
What about that skinny one
who only eats carrots?

652
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,182
Carrots-and-Mountain Dew-Julia?

653
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,745
Right, Julia,
carrots, right.

654
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,880
She had an eating disorder.

655
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:09,585
She went to the hospital
and died.

656
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,217
Oh.

657
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,855
Well, in that case, maybe I can
go back down and get the car.

658
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,057
I'm sure he hasn't
sold it yet.

659
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,100
It wasn't that the car
was in such great shape.

660
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,431
- I'm sure the car...
- Stop! Stop!

661
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,936
I loved that car.

662
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,733
I know you did.

663
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,569
No, you didn't
because I never told you.

664
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,041
Why? Because you never listen.

665
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,943
All right, I'm an asshole.
That has been established.

666
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,413
Not to the extent that
I'm about to establish it.

667
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,418
You make fun of everything
I do, including my job.

No, I'm proud of you working.

No, it's wild.
Isn't it?

672
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:46,057
You don't take anything seriously, do you?

673
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,963
You think the world
is just here for your amusement.

674
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,159
- Look at the world.
- I do.

But unlike you,
I have to live in it.

he'd never pawn it again.

No.

Come on, come on!

757
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,465
[Miranda]
One of them is named Mike.

758
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:48,237
And the other one
is named Bruce.

759
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:51,075
Security guards
have master keys,

760
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:53,378
but the manager,
he's the only one

761
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,884
who has the great
grand master key.

762
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,580
It opens every single door.

763
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,054
He calls it the "God" key.

out to the beach on Saturdays.

play a little volleyball.

00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,749
Did you get sort of
a weird vibe

778
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:36,418
from these people?

779
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:38,586
- Kind of.
- Yeah.

780
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,926
That's because they're swingers.

781
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:43,295
What?

782
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,357
Do I gotta draw you
a picture?

783
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,699
What are you
talking about?

784
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,635
- You don't know, do you?
- No.

785
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:54,040
So nice that you don't
know everything.

786
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:56,544
Swingers, um...

787
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:59,547
Well, they're, you know,
people who like

788
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:02,812
to spice up their life
with different partners.

789
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:05,543
Oh!

790

Oh, my God.

791
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,856
They were talking
swinger code.

792
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,953
Oh, God,
that is so gross!

793
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,224
What am I going to do?

794
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,731
Why? Wh-What's the matter?

795
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,666
- They invited me to a barbecue.
- They what?

796
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:22,068
You were the one that told me
to accept any and all invitations

797
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,197
so that I can get to know
the people and the layout.

798
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,207
But I didn't mean that
you were supposed to go and...

799
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,867
I didn't know that
they were swingers.

800
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,139
It's cool, all right?
It's cool, it's cool.

in the 16th century in Spain.

He made up this place where
there was unlimited gold and pearls,

and beautiful, fierce women who
wore gold armor and rode wild beasts,
