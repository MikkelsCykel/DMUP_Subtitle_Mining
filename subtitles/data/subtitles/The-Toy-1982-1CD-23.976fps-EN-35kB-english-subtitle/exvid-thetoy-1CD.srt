1
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,206
Just to show you that
I have a good heart...

2
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:32,350
...I'll give you a ticket for some
mouthwash, because you got halitosis.

3
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,951
I'm gonna raise you
a dollar in food stamps.

4
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,817
There's a job at Haley's Car Wash.

5
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,620
You're not going to get it.

6
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,956
I'd like to call the hurry-up squad.
I've got a good hand.

7
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,727
What is this dog thing?
Nobody wants...

8
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,803
Who put that in?

9
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,737
There's a lot. I got two dogs.

10
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,909
Bring them down.
We'll barbecue them.

11
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,011
I'll do that.
You can eat them.

12
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,771
You're lucky it's not a cat.

13
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,954
Put some Alpo coupons in.
That's good food.

14
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:12,249
Pure horse meat.
Doesn't shrivel in the skillet.

15
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,187
You can spread it on bread.

16
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,758
Are we gonna play?
What have you got?

17
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,864
I got a straight.
I almost got a straight.

18
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,796
- Let me see your straight.
- A pair of sevens.

19
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,297
I got a pair of nines.

20
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,708
There are five, six puppies.

21
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,845
- How you doing?
- Hi, baby.

22
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,747
Can I take something?

23
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,942
- Take this.
- What can I get?

24
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,481
- You can get lost, Clifford.
- I like that. Get lost.

25
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,429
- Jack.
- How about a one-on-one, little man?

26
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,297
It's all right with me, big man.

27
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,566
Feel the ball. Bounce it.

28
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,704
- Jack.
- Let me have it.

29
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,740
Can't you play the game?

30
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,235
Are you gonna do
that every time?

31
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,306
Jack, your army buddy
came to my office today.

32
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:16,011
It was very embarrassing.
He's gonna auction off the house.

33
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:20,923
- He's gonna auction off the house.
- My parents gave it to me.

34
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,617
They gave you the mortgage.

35
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,492
- You know it's mine.
- We haven't paid in six months.

36
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,863
I haven't finished the book.
When I do, I'll get the money.

37
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,769
- Would you stop about the book?
- Angela, you know I'm a writer.

38
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:39,467
Yes, darling. You're a writer.
A very good writer.

39
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,510
- I am a writer, right?
- He is.

40
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,705
Everybody, ain't I a writer?

41
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,158
Stanley!

42
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,992
Register at the desk
if you want to take the class.

43
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,962
I want to see my friend
before he goes to work.

44
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,760
Jack, get out of here.

45
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:11,674
Why are you upsetting Angela,
telling her you're selling my house?

46
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,312
You're not going to sell it, right?

47
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,148
The house belongs to the bank...

48
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,153
...unless you come up
with a quick 10 grand.

49
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:29,885
I'm trying to stop them, but I can't
help if you don't have a job.

50
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,257
So get a job and get out, Jack.

51
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,093
I have a job.
Writing a book is a job.

52
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:38,964
Writing a book is a cop-out, Jack.
Now get a job.

53
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,335
A paying job will convince
them of your sincerity...

54
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,443
...and your honest intentions.

55
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,010
Ticklish!

56
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,543
Now why don't you get a job?
And don't touch me.

57
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,742
No physical contact.
We'll lose our license.

58
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,556
Get out of here, will you?
You're disrupting the cast.

59
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,091
Just get out! Out! Out!

60
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,231
Get a job! Get a job! Get a job!

61
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,016
Hey, brother. Where you going?

62
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,960
- Where you going?
- Clifford, I'm here for a job.

63
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,158
- What do you think we're in line for?
- The bus.

64
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,770
No. The job. I'll tell you
what to do. Just a moment.

65
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,704
- All you waiting on the job?
- Yeah. Get your bicycle.

66
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,708
Okay? There you go,
to the end of the line.

67
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,110
If you can't find it,
come back to the front again.

68
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,341
Watch the cars.

69
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,982
Oh, my God!
He's gonna hit that man!

70
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:43,221
Come on, Shorty. Come on.
Watch yourself. Come on.

71
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,260
There you go. Good boy.

72
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,394
Hey! What, you crazy idiot!

73
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,239
Yeah. No. Instruments? No.

74
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,947
Cleaning lady?
Cleaning lady?

75
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,819
Hey! Halt.

76
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,753
Hey, pops. What do you need?

77
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,257
Want to keep an eye on this for me?

78
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:29,469
- Hi, foxy lady.
- Thank you very much.

79
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,473
A quarter. I'll buy a car.

80
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,340
- I have a job for you. You mind?
- Not at all.

81
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,507
Hold those while I get in. Bless your
heart. Good luck to you. Thank you.

82
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,119
- Not for you.
- It's a free country.

83
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,755
- That's Fancy Bates.
- His daughter?

84
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,154
- Wife numero three.
- You think she is ready?

85
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,159
- Ready for what?
- Black experience.

86
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,796
You ready?

87
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,894
Take it easy, Fancy.

88
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,564
Miss Jackie Brown.

89
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,976
Is there no Miss Jackie Brown?

90
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,737
- That's me.
- Miss Jackie Brown.

91
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:11,144
- I got it.
- Not you. We need a part-time woman.

92
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,547
I can be a part-time woman.
I'm a part-time woman.

93
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,151
Jackie Brown.

94
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,486
Man, no jive. This is...
That's good.

95
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,492
That's very good.
You're what we call "overqualified."

96
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:28,463
Mr. Brown, we're looking for a woman
to do a little part-time cleaning...

97
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,636
...and you're a journalist.

98
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,805
Go see the people
in Mr. Bates' newspaper.

99
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,702
<i>The Bugle.
They aren't hiring any blacks.</i>

100
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,002
Is this a protest?

101
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,641
You're not starting
a sit-in, are you?

102
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,845
I just want a job.

103
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:51,319
Here's your Phi Beta. I'm sorry.

104
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:55,255
I can do anything a woman can do.
Almost.

105
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,986
No. Answer's no.

106
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,325
No now. No tomorrow. No next week.

107
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,298
No next month. No next year.

108
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,437
You know what I like about
this outfit, Mr. Morehouse?

109
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,735
Its open-mindedness.

110
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,903
I think you're trouble.
Mr. Bates doesn't want any trouble.

111
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:20,211
Thank you for coming. My secretary
will give you a parking validation.

112
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:25,288
I'm not trouble.
My girlfriend, she's trouble.

113
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,185
Is she foxy?
What kind of trouble could she be?

114
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,956
Oh, she's a legal staff
for the local Klanwatch.

115
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,931
She's very litigious.

116
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,502
Litigious.

117
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,998
- She sues people?
- Like in court.

118
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,473
Why don't you sit down?
You don't want this job.

119
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,509
No. I'll be truthful with you.

120
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:52,047
You'd have to come in two days,
on Tuesdays and Fridays...

121
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,481
...to serve a staff luncheon.

122
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,917
I waited tables in college.

123
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:01,753
Every weeknight you have to clean
the window displays for three hours.

124
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:05,761
- I'll take it.
- Is it that bad out there?

125
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,455
Worse.

126
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,396
How attached are you to that beard?

127
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:16,303
I'm not gonna vacuum with my beard.
That's the '60s. This is the '80s.

128
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,478
You see, we're part
of Mr. Bates' family here.

129
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,613
And none of us have beards.

130
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,612
I will not be denied, Sidney.

131
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,719
She's busy.
Come back about 3 o'clock.

132
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:33,187
I'm looking for Miss Ruby D. Simpson.

133
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,859
That's me.
What do you want?

134
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,155
I'm the new cleaning lady.

135
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,800
Lord, have mercy.
Morehouse done flipped his wig.

136
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,768
I'm the new cleaning lady.

137
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,377
Come on, honey. Walk this way.

138
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,311
Move it.

139
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,909
He's gonna want to see all of this.
So you know your job.

140
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,652
You want to be ready, right?

141
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,358
Chicken, Mr. Morehouse?

142
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,798
Please get some pants on
before Mr. Bates sees you, okay?

143
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,663
Okay, pilgrim.

144
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,554
Good morning, U.S.

145
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,948
- How are you, U. S?
- Pretty good.

146
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,362
- Mr. U.S., phone.
- No calls. Time is money.

147
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,293
- It's your son.
- Excuse me.

148
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,058
Time is money.

149
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,470
Hello, Eric.

150
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,969
How was the flight?

151
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,899
Good. Good.

152
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,980
I'm glad you're here.
We're gonna have a wonderful week.

153
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,616
And anything you want.

154
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:09,181
Anything. Absolutely.

155
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,517
Okay, son. I'll see you.

156
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,909
- That's my tomato salad.
- I'm sorry.

157
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,710
No, my salad.

158
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,076
Mine had four eggs on it.

159
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,052
I can... I can go help fix this.

160
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,489
I can fix this.

161
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,793
Excuse me, Mr. Morehouse.

162
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,901
I'm sorry, U.S. Goes back to you.

163
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,268
No, these other people got to eat.

164
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,076
Me, U. S?

165
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:21,022
He wants to talk to you.
Go on down there.

166
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,123
Cover your lip. Mustache.

167
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,989
Cover your lip.

168
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,257
Sorry, Mr. Bates.

169
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,847
You're very strong for a little lady.

170
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,408
And you have a lot
of hair on your lip.

171
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,884
We don't like our waitresses
to have hairy lips.

172
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,360
You see, I noticed...

173
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,835
- Tell you what. Shave.
- Shave?

174
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,466
And after you shave, you're fired.

175
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,105
Thank you, Mr. Bates.

176
00:15:56,522 --> 00:16:00,618
No, I can do it.
I can do it, Mr. Bates.

177
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,327
- What did he say?
- What a great man.

178
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:14,996
He says I'm sexy and
he loves the chicken.

179
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,436
Know what I mean, soul brother?

180
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,239
Power to the people. Right on.

181
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,601
Here we are, young man.
Shall I wait?

182
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,841
Give me a hand.
Somebody give me a hand.

183
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,205
Let's see, hand, football.

184
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,943
Do I have to stay? I'm an accountant.
Will he exceed his credit?

185
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,584
We gotta win this one.

186
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:04,779
There's six seconds or we
don't win the Super Bowl.

187
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,424
I didn't come this far to lose, okay?

188
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,990
He's fired. Did you fire him?

189
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,322
I didn't fire him.
You're the ones...

190
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,300
Go deep. Swing left on blue, okay?

191
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,370
On six. On three. On two.

192
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,733
Be ready. Somebody get Matoussac.

193
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:26,900
Okay! 36, 44, on blue!

194
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:29,503
Go for it!

195
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,587
I'm okay.

196
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,415
Blue, 26, 32.

197
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,521
It's always my toy department!
Why can't he get into stereos?

198
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,827
- Or something we don't even sell.
- We sell everything.

199
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,577
Don't know my own strength.

200
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,475
"Danger. Do not touch."

201
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,915
Wonder Wheel.

202
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,053
Looks like a job for me.

203
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,234
Wonder Wheel.

204
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,092
This is great.

205
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,936
Bounces. Dance on it.

206
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,168
<i>What's so dangerous about...</i>

207
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,072
It doesn't work.
That's why it's dangerous.

208
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,181
It works!

209
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:45,150
Wonder Wheel! Stop!
I admit it, it works!

210
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,549
Okay. Stop, Wonder Wheel!

211
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,626
Nice Wonder Wheel! Stop!

212
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,096
Stop the Wonder Wheel!

213
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,898
Help! Wonder Wheel!

214
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,638
I'm the Wonder Wheel
champion of the world!

215
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,813
Miracle Wonder Wheel!
The best one!

216
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,774
The best...

217
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,014
Wonder Wheel, no. Wonder Wheel...

218
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:19,221
Come on. Don't, you can't.
We've been through too much together.

219
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,086
Come on! Come on, Wonder Wheel.

220
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,228
Come on, you can do it.

221
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,728
I don't want to be
a Wonder-Wheel murderer.

222
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,163
I want you to play with kids.

223
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,997
You haven't even been to the zoo.

224
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,571
You never even touched water.

225
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,937
Come on, Wonder Wheel.
Where's your heart?

226
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,596
- I know what I want.
- He likes it.

227
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,858
- Let's blow it up right away.
- The black man.

228
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,970
He wants one in black, all right?

229
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:11,233
- The black man!
- He wants the black man.

230
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,607
No, Eric, no. Not today.
Not now. Not ever.

231
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,441
- Yes.
- He's not a toy.

232
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,620
He's trouble. See the mustache?
I asked him to shave.

233
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:27,121
- I really don't care.
- He's one of our cleaning people.

234
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,294
- I want him.
- He's not for sale.

235
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,395
- Why not?
- Because he's a person.

236
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,965
Daddy said anything I wanted,
anything in the store.

237
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:39,331
- You can't buy a human, Eric.
- Why not?

238
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,028
Because...

239
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,869
It's against the law, isn't it?

240
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,674
Doesn't my daddy make the laws?

241
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,180
I think he's got a point there.

242
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,853
Mr. Morehouse.

243
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,448
Now!

244
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,855
It's your department.

245
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,126
- Good choice.
- You'll have a wonderful time.

246
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,501
- Tim, Toys.
- Jack, Windows.

247
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,764
- Remember me?
- I'm fired, right?

248
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:19,273
No, no.
Do you see that kid over there?

249
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,616
- He's the son of our...
- Boss.

250
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,821
- He's bright.
- I see the resemblance.

251
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,648
- He'd like to take you home with him.
- Why?

252
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,326
It's just a joke.

253
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:39,793
What, is he sick? Nuts, right?
What are we talking about?

254
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,831
He's just used to
getting his own way.

255
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,328
- You guys are serious!
- No jive.

256
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,666
- You want me to go with him?
- Lf you wouldn't mind.

257
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,367
- I mind.
- I don't want him to get angry here.

258
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,478
He can do a lot of damage.

259
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,013
I don't care. I'm not going anywhere.

260
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,410
No, sir. Not me.

261
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,918
No now. No tomorrow. No next week.
I'm not...

262
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,647
No! As you say, you know?

263
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,554
I think we have to butter your bread.

264
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,964
You can't...
I can't be bought.

265
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,499
This got settled in the Civil War.
You can't have slaves.

266
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:21,639
We just want to rent
you for a little while.

267
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,105
- What is your hourly rate?
- I don't have...

268
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,206
By the hour.

269
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,082
I don't have to stay long?

270
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,447
You'll give a decent
burial to Wonder Wheel?

271
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,316
- Yes.
- That's my friend.

272
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,981
This is light.
Thank you.

273
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,220
It's a little light here.
Thank you.

274
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,989
A little light.

275
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,796
Very pleased to meet you.

276
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,562
This is Eric.
Eric, he has agreed.

277
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:57,208
His name is Jack Brown.
Jack, Master Bates.

278
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,212
Wrap him up.

279
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:07,078
Wrap who up?
I don't get wrapped.

280
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:10,982
I can't be wrapped unless you have
ribbon or something soft.

281
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,987
This is still light.

282
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,695
Elbows off the table.

283
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,767
Sit up, Eric.

284
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:31,699
Now, Eric, our stomachs digest
our food a lot better...

285
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,744
...if we eat some vegetables,
some starch and some meat.

286
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:39,906
In that order. Not all
the vegetables at one time.

287
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:43,110
- I hate liver.
- I only understand German.

288
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,948
I hate German.

289
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,152
Well, Eric...

290
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,189
...it certainly is a pleasure
to have you.

291
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,261
Now, what do you want to do first?

292
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,435
Six Flags? Delta Queen? New Orleans?

293
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,127
You know, I have a new helicopter.

294
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,306
How's school?

295
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,106
How's your math?

296
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,114
How are the boys?

297
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,957
Does Fancy have to come
to Six Flags with us?

298
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,099
Certainly not. Do you want
Barkley to take you?

299
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,701
I want you to take me.

300
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:39,107
Eric, I've got a surprise for you.
Your present's arrived.

301
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,605
Not until you finish your meal!

302
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,748
Now just a minute here!

303
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,120
Boys will be boys, God bless him.

304
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,361
- Finish your dinner.
- Get me a hammer.

305
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,159
- Not until you eat.
- Get me a hammer.

306
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:06,166
If you don't come
and finish your dinner...

307
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,635
...you won't open that until tomorrow.

308
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,705
Are you crazy?

309
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,940
What's going on in here?

310
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:20,049
She won't help me open my present.
She won't give me a hammer.

311
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,453
- What the hell is that?
- Help!

312
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,192
You said I could have anything.

313
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,688
Help, please. I need air.

314
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,865
Schatzie, get a hammer.

315
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:38,925
- Can I have some air?
- Who are you?

316
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:43,801
I'm the new part-time cleaning lady,
sir, at the store.

317
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,240
What are you doing in there?

318
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,039
Your son came along and asked them...

319
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,716
...to wrap me up, which they did,
in a box.

320
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,579
This box.

321
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:01,451
I hope you have a good
explanation for this.

322
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,426
You said anything in the store.
Well, he was in the store.

323
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,466
I get to open it. It's my present.

324
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,261
What?

325
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,371
Hurry!

326
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,940
Please hurry.

327
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,467
Didn't I tell you to shave?

328
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,831
- Sorry.
- Sir.

329
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,797
Sorry, sir.

330
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,838
- I mean, come here.
- No way.

331
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,744
Wait a minute.
Let's not be too hasty.

332
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,718
- I'll pay you on an hourly basis.
- Sir.

333
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,688
All right, I'll pay you
on an hourly basis, sir.

334
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:10,952
No.

335
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,727
What sort of a position
are you looking for?

336
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:19,233
- Slave sound too crass?
- I'm serious.

337
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:20,995
I am too.
I'm a journalist.

338
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:24,141
I've been trying to get
a job on your newspaper.

339
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:27,971
The only black people you hire
do windows, mop floors...

340
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:32,548
I don't like it. I tried it.
Believe me, I have dignity.

341
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:36,016
Take those firecrackers and...
Never mind.

342
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:43,589
- That's not the way out.
- Go get him, Daddy.

343
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,626
- Wait. What's your name?
- Jack Brown.

344
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,995
I only have the boy
for one week a year.

345
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,932
Get better lawyers. That's too long.

346
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,802
- I love him.
- Frankly, I don't give a damn.

347
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:02,173
- He wants you to stay.
- He wants to see if you can make me.

348
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,247
He's manipulative. It's a power play.

349
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:10,015
You know, if you were
a little less hysterical...

350
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:14,351
...you'd suggest I pay you
what I pay my reporters for a week.

351
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,762
- $400.
- For babysitting?

352
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,921
Step in my office.

353
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,668
Isn't that a magnificent
arrangement of dominoes?

354
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,772
It's really something.

355
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:33,910
- It took me over a month to set it up.
- A month? Wow!

356
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,577
It's rewarding. Have a seat.

357
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:50,560
I'm a man who gets what he wants
by patience.

358
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:54,458
Some people exercise
their tibias or fibulas...

359
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,234
I exercise my patience.

360
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,540
Patience.

361
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,282
No hole.

362
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:18,183
Just bite the end off.
And spit it in your hand.

363
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:31,401
Eric's not a bad boy.
High-spirited. I like that.

364
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,195
I like him.

365
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,996
- You'll like him.
- I'm crazy about him.

366
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,938
He should understand that money
means never being sorry.

367
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:44,104
That's about the only thing
he does understand.

368
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,381
That's not an ashtray, you asshole.

369
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,855
That's an ashtray.

370
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,996
What you're offering me isn't a job.
It's an insult.

371
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,430
I'm insulted and I'm splitting.

372
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:09,465
All right, what do you need?

373
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,002
I need?

374
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,903
- $10,000.
- Ten...

375
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,546
You're not a reporter.
You're a crook.

376
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,717
You didn't ask me
what I'd settle for.

377
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:24,854
- That's what I meant.
- Let's start at 1000 and work up.

378
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,648
That's highway robbery.

379
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,691
<i>I'd settle for $400
and a job on The Bugle.</i>

380
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,897
There isn't any job on the paper.

381
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,231
- 1500.
- Deal.

382
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,695
- 2000.
- Now, wait a minute.

383
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,096
We had a deal.

384
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:45,236
- Two-five.
- Fine, but for that kind of money...

385
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,037
...if Eric blows his nose,
you wipe it.

386
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,273
- 3000.
- Two-five.

387
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:54,178
- Two-seven.
- Two-five is my top.

388
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,253
- $3000.
- I wonder if Eric knows...

389
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:01,118
...what kind of bastard he's getting.

390
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,988
I may be a bastard, Mr. Bates,
but l...

391
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,716
- I'll kill you!
- Two-five is fine.

392
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,386
Two-five is excellent.

393
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,612
Are you at the store?

394
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,985
Well, where are you?
At U.S. Bates' house?

395
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,720
The U.S. Bates' house?
Clifford, hold it down.

396
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:44,300
- I'm working for U.S. Bates.
- "I'm working for U.S. Bates."

397
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,833
Not on the paper...

398
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,332
A toy?

399
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:52,100
- I'm U.S. Bates' toy. I'm not stoned.
- Let's play. Get off the phone!

400
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,406
No, he's not playing with me.
I'm his son's toy, Eric.

401
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,912
He's got a son and he hired me...

402
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:03,144
He's one of the nicest kids
I've ever met. He's really...

403
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,447
- Play with me!
- He's wonderful.

404
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,683
- Ask me how much I'm making.
- Get off the phone.

405
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:11,054
- Get off the phone!
- Just ask me.

406
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:15,460
- $2500 a week!
- Get off the phone!

407
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:20,394
- Say goodbye! Come on!
- He's a wonderful...

408
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,200
- He's just wonderful.
- You're paid to play, not to talk.

409
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,843
- Just a minute. How old are you?
- Nine.

410
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,478
You want to live to be 10?
Do you?

411
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:40,218
- Fancy.
- Wait until I'm done, U.S.

412
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,351
- I've got to talk to you.
- But I'm busy.

413
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,656
What I have to tell you is important!

414
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:52,569
- What am I supposed to do?
- How do you turn off this machine?

415
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,798
Oh, sugar. I like it like that.

416
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:11,115
- That was fun.
- Please. I have a headache.

417
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,017
I've got something to say.

418
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:17,160
Is it about the party?
Everything's arranged beautifully.

419
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,391
It's about Eric.

420
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:23,798
Oh, God!
Has it been a year already?

421
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,027
I forgot it was his week.

422
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:30,537
What do I have to do with him?
Take him to Six Flags?

423
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:32,939
He...

424
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,736
He bought a black man.

425
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:41,775
- I wasn't aware that we sold them.
- I wanted you to know...

426
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:45,251
...so you wouldn't be frightened
if you saw him.

427
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:50,120
- There's a black man in this house?
- It's only for a week.

428
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:54,931
- But why?
- To play with, he says.

429
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,761
To aggravate you and me, I say.

430
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,764
Heaven forbid! You just
tell him no, you ass.

431
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,103
That's U.S., not "you ass."

432
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:11,506
Well, I'm just gonna take a shower,
U.S.

433
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,623
Look out!

434
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,959
My bedroom's over here.

435
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:39,673
I am Swiss. I know nothing!
Oh, Eric!

436
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,648
- This is fun, Jack.
- Fun?

437
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,879
Look out!

438
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:16,502
I didn't figure your weight
in the turn. Great ride, though.

439
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,740
Are you all right, Master Bates?
Are you?

440
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,681
Jesus Christ! Are you crazy?

441
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,254
What are you doing?

442
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,721
Stop making faces.
Leave him alone.

443
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:34,825
Here's a hat. Now put it on.
Let's go!

444
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,023
Give him a ticket. Put it on.

445
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,236
I'm Eric Bates!

446
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,631
Chop, chop! Give him a ticket!

447
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,467
What's going on?
What do you mean?

448
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:48,873
Is everybody like this?
Does this go on every day?

449
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,480
- You can't talk.
- He's clean!

450
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,879
Thank you. That's more than
the floor is.

451
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,247
- Know what's on that floor?
- No.

452
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:58,922
Your dinner.

453
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,517
That was my dinner?
That was my dinner, Shirley Temple.

454
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:06,219
- I don't care. Get in!
- You don't...

455
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:11,197
- Got a license to drive on the steps?
- I don't need one. I'm Eric Bates.

456
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,700
You'll learn the hard way, laddie.

457
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:18,433
- I'm U.S. Bates' son!
- You got a jail around here?

458
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,270
- A jail?
- Yes!

459
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:23,504
- On the left.
- I'm Eric Bates! Put me down!

460
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,312
In the slammer, mammer.

461
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:37,586
Jack! Let me out of here!
Barkley, you're fired!

462
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,922
Well-played. Congratulations.

463
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,828
- Could you fix me a cheeseburger?
- What's going on?

464
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,697
- I didn't hear anything.
- What's going on?

465
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:50,135
He was driving down the steps.

466
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,970
I don't want this job.
I'm gonna lose it anyways.

467
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,270
Dad! Dad!

468
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:59,082
Calm down, calm down. Calm down!

469
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,513
- What's going on?
- It's my fault.

470
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,550
- My fault, sir.
- No, my fault.

471
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,187
Yes, it's his fault.

472
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,492
No, now Jack...
Daddy, we were...

473
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,218
...just playing.

474
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:15,923
- Right, Jack?
- Yeah, we were just playing a game.

475
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,663
Just playing, Daddy.

476
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:22,996
Come on, Jack. Let's go play
some more games.

477
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,432
Come on, Jack.

478
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,438
- Clean this up.
- Yes, thank you.

479
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,843
- There's a party about to happen.
- Thank you.

480
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:35,286
- Why did you stick up for me?
- I want you to stay.

481
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,619
- Why did you stick up for me?
- I want you to stay.

482
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:43,624
Why? Does it mean anything to you
that I don't want to stay?

483
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:47,730
- Lf you're paid enough, you'll stay.
- That's not the question.

484
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,560
Daddy's giving you a lot of money.

485
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:56,397
That has no significance here.
Understand?

486
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:00,907
I am talking about, I have pets.
I have friends.

487
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,774
I got 16 plants, and my lady.

488
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:07,144
- Your old lady won't mind.
- My old lady? No.

489
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,649
- My lady.
- Put this on.

490
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,982
A costume?
This is for a short person.

491
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,718
- I need something that fits.
- I bought some for Barkley.

492
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,624
- Maybe they'd fit you.
- Maybe.

493
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,765
- Let's go play a game.
- "Let's go play a game."

494
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,798
- Come on.
- "Come on."

495
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,027
"Got some for Barkley."

496
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,866
<i>Keep your hands up.
Proteot yourself at all times.</i>

497
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,079
Box the robot.

498
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,875
This is better than Disneyland.
You know that?

499
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:48,288
<i>Keep your hands up.
Proteot yourself at all times.</i>

500
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:02,228
<i>Keep your hands up.
Proteot yourself at all times.</i>

501
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,770
Come on. Get up.

502
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,976
Are you all right?

503
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,246
Let's go play the game.

504
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,016
<i>- Foul! Foul! Foul!
- What game?</i>

505
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,659
The air hockey game. Come on.

506
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,894
You ready? I'm gonna win, right?

507
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:32,502
- You're not gonna win.
- Lf you win, you can go home with pay.

508
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,227
- For the week?
- Sure.

509
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:39,837
- $2500 for a couple of hours?
- Sure. Why not?

510
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:44,606
- What's Money Bucks gonna think?
- I can deal with my daddy.

511
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,716
You can't deal with me.
I was very good.

512
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,476
I'm pretty good.

513
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:54,056
Let's say every goal I get,
you have to stay another year.

514
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,852
- For every goal? Okay.
- That's one year!

515
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,562
- I wasn't ready.
- So? I make the rules!

516
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,130
- That's one year.
- You cheat!

517
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,665
- Two years.
- I wasn't ready.

518
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:09,805
I'm the king of ghetto hockey.
You ain't gonna beat me.

519
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:15,678
Watch it, watch it, watch it!
Tricker! One year. That's one.

520
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:21,114
- Come back. The game's not over.
- I'm not playing.

521
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:25,516
You're gonna quit because
I was winning? You hate to lose?

522
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,123
I don't feel like playing anymore.

523
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:31,123
- What if I tell your dad?
- He doesn't care.

524
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:34,195
He doesn't care his son is a quitter?

525
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:38,767
He doesn't care what I am,
as long as I stay out of his way.

526
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,439
- My little dove, it's bath time.
- I'm busy.

527
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,703
- Come on now. The water's ready.
- No!

528
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,211
Hello, Mr. Brown.

529
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,943
- Now! This minute!
- Not without my toy.

530
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:58,019
Good boy. You want your submarine?

531
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:03,091
- No. Jack.
- Oh, no! I'll tell your father!

532
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,854
Does everybody around here say that?

533
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,595
I'm not gonna say it anymore.

534
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:16,206
Not you. You can take a bath
in my room and I'll wash you.

535
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,843
- Meet you later.
- My room is the second door...

536
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:24,913
- What are you doing?
- Wow, this is... Are you kidding me?

537
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,514
I wanted a pool
but Dad said it was dangerous.

538
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,587
- It's great. Look at all...
- Don't touch!

539
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,884
It's Mr. Bates' collection
and I'm in charge.

540
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:39,824
Now, Eric, you get in the tub.
And you, out!

541
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:44,467
Eric, you're too big to bathe
with another naked man!

542
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:48,331
She's right.
You shouldn't bathe with a naked man.

543
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,133
I forbid you! Oh, God!

544
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,003
Here we go!

545
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,202
- Oh, my God!
- Do my back.

546
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,576
Mr. Bates!

547
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:04,247
<i>It Came from the Tub,
starring Eric Bates as "It."</i>

548
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:05,615
I like you.

549
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,123
No, you don't!

550
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:23,305
Let me guess. You're the new
second-floor sprinkler system.

551
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:27,603
I'm Jack Brown.
I'm sorry I messed up your carpet.

552
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:31,110
I wouldn't think this would
tickle a grown man.

553
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,373
Amazing.

554
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,982
What people will do for money.

555
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,431
Who do they think they are?

556
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,787
I'll kill him.
I'll pull his head off. I'll get him!

557
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,557
- Well, here they are now.
- Hi, U.S. How are you?

558
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,857
I'm fine. How are you?

559
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:27,529
- Fancy, you look so good tonight.
- Hi, sugar-pie!

560
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:32,698
I'm glad to see you. Look at those
bracelets. Where did you get them?

561
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,377
These old things?

562
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:38,571
The word I get is that
they're going to indict you.

563
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,410
Oh. State or federal?

564
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:46,647
Federal. Now where's that
limey of yours with the bourbon?

565
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,552
Barkley!

566
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:52,028
Your bourbon, my lords.

567
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,154
Thank you, my lords.

568
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:04,273
A federal case? Maybe we ought to run
a little party for the senator.

569
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:09,538
I always thought that they conducted
their proms in an excellent manner.

570
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:13,683
It used to be my pleasure
to buy the band uniforms.

571
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,944
And each year,
we'd have a different color.

572
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,681
Do you know why they're
having a party downstairs?

573
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:24,156
Because it's goodbye for you guys.

574
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:28,161
It's called a "wrap party."
This is all for you guys.

575
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,333
They're not selling you anymore.

576
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:34,061
They got a new toy to sell
called the "Jack Brown."

577
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:37,035
Me, the wind-up asshole.
Yes, that's me.

578
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:41,075
I'm taking over all of the stores
next Christmas.

579
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:46,409
Kids will holler for me. They won't
want no teddy bears like you.

580
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:50,314
And they won't want no sad pandas.
And no camels.

581
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,217
No tigers, leopards, lions, rabbits.

582
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:58,487
And orangutans. You understand?
Kids will want a Jack Brown wind-up.

583
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:04,032
"Mommy, I want a Jack Brown wind-up.
Suzy's can play basketball.

584
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:06,896
Otto's can drive a Cadillac.

585
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:10,471
He's real cute too
and I want to pinch his nose."

586
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:15,668
That's what I've done to myself.
I sold out to Morehouse, you know?

587
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:21,150
I'll end up in this room with
all you toys for the rest of my life.

588
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,759
What the hell is that?

589
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:36,459
Jesus! What the...

590
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,501
Why...

591
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:44,306
You think that's funny?
What do you think of this?

592
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:48,000
Goodbye! I want my clothes!

593
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:51,340
"Goodbye! I want my clothes!"

594
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,277
I want my clothes!

595
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:55,582
I want my clothes!

596
00:45:57,488 --> 00:46:01,447
- I'm not kidding!
- "I want my clothes! I'm not kidding!"

597
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:11,333
- I want my clothes.
- Mr. Brown. Now sit down for a minute.

598
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,834
They're in the dryer,
and they're all wet.

599
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:18,439
Now tell me something.
Are you brown all over?

600
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:23,978
You can talk dirty, if you like.
I'll jump on top of you.

601
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:28,641
How disgusting for him to force
himself into my room. Go to bed!

602
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:30,578
- Jack!
- What?

603
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,085
- Where you going?
- Home.

604
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,656
- Why?
- Are you that dumb, kid?

605
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,657
- Jesus!
- Aren't we full of surprises?

606
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:44,095
<i>I'm looking for the laundry room.
Fräulein's got my clothes.</i>

607
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:48,101
Yes, the laundry room.
Why don't you just follow me?

608
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:51,900
- See you, Eric. Thanks very much.
- You're welcome.

609
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:56,905
Excuse me. May I have your attention?

610
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:02,313
I just wanted you all to see
what U.S. Bought his boy today.

611
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,046
It doesn't even need batteries.
Isn't that sweet?

612
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:10,590
I hope it'll start a trend
to solve the unemployment situation.

613
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:14,821
If y'all want one for your children,
we're taking orders...

614
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:18,160
- We gotta talk.
- U.S., can't you take a joke?

615
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:22,134
- I'm embarrassed!
- That wasn't remotely amusing.

616
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,840
- Not remotely amusing.
- You're marking my arm, sugar.

617
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:30,480
I thought three weeks
with that shrink would do.

618
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,980
You gotta spend some quiet time
at the hospital.

619
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:38,985
I'm sorry. I was bragging.
You liked for me to brag on you.

620
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:41,154
Let loose of me.

621
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,658
You gonna deal with what happened?
Your wife embarrassed me!

622
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,797
So? You're getting paid.

623
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:51,832
It's your bedtime.
Put your toy away and go to sleep.

624
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,732
- You, come with me.
- You can't pay me enough money!

625
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:57,770
You'll get yours.

626
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,345
- Son of a...
- You can't leave!

627
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,018
- I can't?
- In your pajamas?

628
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,451
<i>- Fräulein's got my clothes.
- You won't get your money.</i>

629
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:18,890
Money? You're not hearing me.
I was embarrassed and humiliated!

630
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:21,963
You acted like money was important.

631
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:25,259
- I was wrong!
- Was I bad?

632
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:30,099
Were you bad? What you were gave
a new meaning to the word "bad."

633
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,798
Stop! Don't go out that door!

634
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,946
There's parking people out front,
and they'll laugh.

635
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,446
Go out the side door.

636
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:46,645
You sure? Listen to me,
you're something else, man.

637
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,825
You never cease to amaze me.

638
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:53,656
Each time I think you're a rotten kid,
you do something real nice.

639
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:58,531
- Thanks, pal. Take it easy.
- So long.

640
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:00,669
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Eric.

641
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:07,537
Eric! Open this door, you little shit!

642
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:14,480
- Should we do something?
- What else can go wrong?

643
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:18,212
Probably a short-circuited
wire or something.

644
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,982
Open the door, you bastard!

645
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,276
- He might be armed and dangerous!
- Negro!

646
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,439
- Grab him. Probably on drugs.
- Bet he got out of prison.

647
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:54,721
- Hey! Watch my car!
- He's high on marijuana, I bet!

648
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,423
It's only a fault
in the electrical system, I'm sure.

649
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:51,441
- Well, Rasputin, what's next?
- I want to go back to school.

650
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:55,346
- Before the end of spring vacation?
- Tonight.

651
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,850
- But this is my week.
- I knew you wouldn't let me.

652
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:04,089
What's wrong? What happened?
Are you disappointed...

653
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,319
...that I didn't drown?

654
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:10,557
It's always my fault.
Well, it wasn't. It was Fancy's.

655
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:14,396
She didn't have to take him down
and get him embarrassed.

656
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:17,940
Now he won't come back
no matter how much you pay.

657
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:22,737
I don't want to stay because
I don't have anyone to play with!

658
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,776
Don't, Dad! I want him back!
Don't! I want Jack back.

659
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:33,251
Please, Daddy. Please get me
Jack back. Please!

660
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,428
They've come for the pajamas.

661
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,336
Just a minute!

662
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,119
- Please, Mr. Brown!
- No.

663
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:13,455
- The kid needs a shrink.
- I agree with you.

664
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:19,124
I take a little something so I
can sleep, and tonight I took two.

665
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:20,730
And he told me...

666
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:25,465
...that I either do what he wants
or I can look for another job.

667
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,644
Please, open this envelope.
Just look at it.

668
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:29,971
Come on. No.

669
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:32,874
Please.

670
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,282
No. This is my house.

671
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,455
Let me say something.

672
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:43,148
It doesn't matter the compensation.
The answer is no!

673
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:47,557
Can I say something to you?
I admire your moral fiber.

674
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,700
Ten thousand dollars!

675
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,399
$10,000?
For a week or the rest of my life?

676
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:04,808
- He only has the kid for a week.
- $10,000?

677
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:10,748
Jack, now we can buy the house!

678
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,354
Come in. We'll discuss moral fiber.

679
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:16,856
Yes, Mr. Morehouse.
Jack, we're gonna buy a house!

680
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,925
- Want to take a nap?
- Yes.

681
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:22,326
We were about to make love.
You can join in.

682
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,089
Welcome home!

683
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:58,491
Mr. Brown, I'll make it pleasant.
I will scrub your back.

684
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:01,603
- I will draw a bath for you.
- Get it ready!

685
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:05,502
- I'll see you in 10 years.
- 10 years? Who needs it then?

686
00:54:25,472 --> 00:54:26,461
Morning, Barkley!

687
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,304
You're up early this morning.
Or didn't you go to bed last night?

688
00:54:31,511 --> 00:54:33,376
I went to bed.
Is this Jack's?

689
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,605
Yes, this is his breakfast.

690
00:54:35,849 --> 00:54:38,818
One, two, one, two...
Thank you.

691
00:54:41,621 --> 00:54:43,020
Come in.

692
00:54:44,157 --> 00:54:47,615
Here's your breakfast.
How are you this morning?

693
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:50,318
Fine, sir. Good.
Wonderful.

694
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:54,489
Better than the dinner I gave you
on the floor last night.

695
00:54:54,701 --> 00:54:56,032
Oh, this is great.

696
00:54:57,837 --> 00:55:00,397
Where would you like it?
Near the window?

697
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,370
Anybody seen the little monster
this morning?

698
00:55:02,575 --> 00:55:04,736
Do you want me to find him?

699
00:55:04,944 --> 00:55:08,778
He's a pain in the derrière,
I can tell you that.

700
00:55:08,982 --> 00:55:11,644
- Yes, well, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, sir.

701
00:55:32,472 --> 00:55:33,598
What the...!

702
00:55:34,941 --> 00:55:37,933
I've had it! I've had it with you!

703
00:55:38,144 --> 00:55:39,941
- This is it!
- Put me down!

704
00:55:41,081 --> 00:55:42,070
This is it!

705
00:55:42,282 --> 00:55:45,445
- No! No!
- Put me down!

706
00:55:46,853 --> 00:55:49,151
What the hell is this?

707
00:55:49,356 --> 00:55:52,223
Let me go!
Don't spank me, Jack.

708
00:55:52,425 --> 00:55:54,120
Please don't!

709
00:55:57,297 --> 00:55:58,559
What's wrong?

710
00:55:58,765 --> 00:56:02,360
What's wrong?
Why the hell did you pick me?

711
00:56:02,769 --> 00:56:06,102
You made me laugh.
I wanted a friend who made me laugh.

712
00:56:06,306 --> 00:56:08,467
Of all the things in the store,
you wanted a friend?

713
00:56:08,675 --> 00:56:11,735
If you want a friend,
you don't buy a friend.

714
00:56:11,945 --> 00:56:15,847
You earn a friend. You know,
with love and trust.

715
00:56:16,049 --> 00:56:19,780
I mean, you don't throw
firecrackers at them.

716
00:56:19,986 --> 00:56:22,716
You don't dump stuff on their head.

717
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:25,720
You don't throw their food
on the floor.

718
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:27,893
I've had enough of your routine.

719
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:32,087
You love a friend, you know?
You earn a friend.

720
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:34,528
Come see my train.

721
00:56:34,734 --> 00:56:37,032
Didn't you listen to me?

722
00:56:37,237 --> 00:56:39,728
You don't order your friends around.

723
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:42,305
If you have a friend,
you ask them.

724
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:43,698
Sorry.

725
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:47,402
Would you like to
come see my train, friend?

726
00:56:55,321 --> 00:56:56,913
I'm gonna kill you.

727
00:56:57,123 --> 00:56:59,023
I love you, Jack.

728
00:57:18,878 --> 00:57:22,143
We've got four more days.
What'll we do?

729
00:57:22,348 --> 00:57:24,441
Oh, I don't know.
Play?

730
00:57:25,084 --> 00:57:28,952
- Let's do something interesting.
- Watch this.

731
00:57:37,964 --> 00:57:42,833
Hey, I know what. We'll start a
newspaper. You can be a reporter.

732
00:57:43,036 --> 00:57:44,435
Boring.

733
00:57:44,904 --> 00:57:46,371
Come on, man.

734
00:57:46,573 --> 00:57:49,599
Listen, I'll be the editor
and you be the reporter.

735
00:57:49,809 --> 00:57:51,936
I'll call you "Scoop."

736
00:57:52,145 --> 00:57:54,136
Yeah, and you can take pictures.

737
00:57:54,347 --> 00:57:57,714
You got a Kodak you haven't
taken out of the box.

738
00:57:59,452 --> 00:58:03,252
Heaven forbid you might learn
something useful.

739
00:58:03,456 --> 00:58:05,356
- Boring.
- Boring?

740
00:58:05,558 --> 00:58:08,857
All this is not boring?
All this garbage?

741
00:58:09,095 --> 00:58:11,359
Look around!
You kidding me?

742
00:58:11,598 --> 00:58:16,035
I mean, all these people
kissing your ass isn't boring?

743
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:20,464
I have an idea.
You want to go fishing?

744
00:58:20,673 --> 00:58:22,573
For fish?

745
00:58:22,909 --> 00:58:27,676
We used to have all the hoi polloi
from town in this stream.

746
00:58:28,381 --> 00:58:32,977
Swimming, picnicking, leaving
their beer cans all over the place.

747
00:58:33,186 --> 00:58:35,211
So Daddy bought some piranhas.

748
00:58:35,421 --> 00:58:39,448
The first week, a cow
went in there. All gone.

749
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:41,251
Somebody's cow got eaten.

750
00:58:41,461 --> 00:58:43,952
I gotta pull my boots up
real high.

751
00:58:44,163 --> 00:58:46,996
Because the bullshit's
getting thick. Piranhas?

752
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,758
I'm not kidding!

753
00:58:48,968 --> 00:58:52,597
- Piranhas are South American.
- I'm not going in there.

754
00:58:52,805 --> 00:58:54,864
I'm going in there because...

755
00:58:55,074 --> 00:58:57,975
...you put a whoopee cushion under me.

756
00:58:58,177 --> 00:59:02,079
There's nothing here.
No piranhas!

757
00:59:02,282 --> 00:59:06,082
I'm not kidding you!
There are piranhas in there.

758
00:59:06,286 --> 00:59:08,481
Come on. Get out!

759
00:59:08,688 --> 00:59:11,680
Damn you!
Do you see any piranhas?

760
00:59:18,698 --> 00:59:20,165
Come on, Jack. Get...

761
00:59:24,837 --> 00:59:28,603
Come on!
You don't believe me?

762
00:59:30,643 --> 00:59:32,702
You didn't believe me, right?

763
00:59:34,814 --> 00:59:38,113
I'll never doubt your word again.
They're murderers!

764
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:40,980
- Shut up!
- What?

765
00:59:41,187 --> 00:59:44,850
- Hold the noise down.
- Who the hell was that?

766
00:59:48,595 --> 00:59:49,823
Mr. Morehouse.

767
00:59:55,401 --> 00:59:59,303
I came down to do a little
fishing this afternoon...

768
00:59:59,505 --> 01:00:01,063
...because I had a...

769
01:00:01,274 --> 01:00:05,108
...difficult morning.
- You had a difficult morning?

770
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:08,007
I had to let Mr. Geffran...

771
01:00:08,214 --> 01:00:10,114
...head of accounting, go.

772
01:00:11,584 --> 01:00:16,146
He was pushy, Eric. He insisted on
shaking hands with your father.

773
01:00:16,356 --> 01:00:18,950
- So what?
- He has very sweaty hands.

774
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:20,955
Very sweaty hands.

775
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,424
Your father said...

776
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:25,564
...get rid of him.

777
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:30,098
He fired a man
because he had sweaty hands?

778
01:00:30,303 --> 01:00:32,498
No, he made me do it.

779
01:00:33,373 --> 01:00:36,740
Good man. Father and husband.
Mortgage.

780
01:00:36,943 --> 01:00:39,503
Mr. Morehouse,
you gonna be all right?

781
01:00:39,712 --> 01:00:40,940
Yeah.

782
01:00:41,447 --> 01:00:42,812
We gotta go.

783
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:47,452
Good luck, Mr. Morehouse.

784
01:00:49,756 --> 01:00:53,317
You know, we could tell.
We could get even.

785
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:55,255
Who we gonna tell, God?

786
01:00:55,595 --> 01:00:59,156
What are you gonna say?
"Hey, God! Life's unfair."

787
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:02,357
You know what he's gonna say?
"Tough titty."

788
01:01:02,568 --> 01:01:04,559
No, in our newspaper.

789
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:08,233
We're not doing a newspaper,
remember?

790
01:01:08,441 --> 01:01:13,003
We could interview Fancy, Barkley
and everybody.

791
01:01:13,446 --> 01:01:16,711
They wouldn't talk to us.
They work for your dad.

792
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:18,713
You can make them talk.

793
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:22,385
<i>Didn't you see
All the President's Men?</i>

794
01:01:22,588 --> 01:01:25,887
Reporters make people talk,
if they're any good.

795
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:28,753
You told me you were good.
I believe you...

796
01:01:28,961 --> 01:01:32,761
...so we're gonna start a
newspaper. Let's shove off.

797
01:01:35,368 --> 01:01:36,995
I want to be the editor.

798
01:01:37,203 --> 01:01:39,501
I wanna call you "Scoop."

799
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:41,802
Shut up before I let you go.

800
01:01:42,008 --> 01:01:43,270
Don't let go.

801
01:01:45,044 --> 01:01:48,741
You don't know anything about
running a newspaper.

802
01:01:48,948 --> 01:01:50,472
You got that, Scoop?

803
01:01:50,683 --> 01:01:52,082
Quit calling me "Scoop."

804
01:01:52,285 --> 01:01:54,515
Just because your dad
owns one...

805
01:01:54,721 --> 01:01:57,519
...doesn't mean you can run one,
does it?

806
01:01:57,724 --> 01:01:59,248
I hate typing.

807
01:01:59,459 --> 01:02:03,589
I hate you calling me "Scoop."
I want to be the editor.

808
01:02:03,796 --> 01:02:06,264
You're doing it by yourself, champ.

809
01:02:09,202 --> 01:02:10,965
I'm doing it myself!

810
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:15,533
I'm doing it myself!
I'm doing it myself!

811
01:02:15,742 --> 01:02:18,302
Jack... Jack...
I'm gonna fall.

812
01:02:18,578 --> 01:02:20,773
I got you. I got you.
I got you!

813
01:02:21,981 --> 01:02:23,846
I got you!
You give up?

814
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:28,919
One, two, three, that's all!
I was robbed! This guy is...

815
01:02:30,256 --> 01:02:32,622
You're nuts, but I love you.

816
01:02:34,861 --> 01:02:39,127
Eric! Come on, Scoop. Get up!
Time to go to work.

817
01:02:39,332 --> 01:02:43,166
- Come on, I just...
- Come on, Scoop. Hey, wait!

818
01:02:43,369 --> 01:02:48,033
Just a minute, my friend. I'm gonna
take your picture for the paper.

819
01:02:48,241 --> 01:02:50,436
All right.
Say "cheese."

820
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:57,848
Jack, I'm gonna get you for this!

821
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,483
You're in for it.

822
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,860
Couldn't we get these in a 40-Iow?

823
01:03:10,062 --> 01:03:12,690
Come on, Jack.
I'll race you for a beer.

824
01:03:12,899 --> 01:03:15,060
The last one in is a rotten egg.

825
01:03:15,268 --> 01:03:17,964
Come on, Jack.
You gotta let me win this.

826
01:03:18,171 --> 01:03:20,537
Come on.
Don't do that to me.

827
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,368
Let's go up there, man,
and take a rest.

828
01:03:30,983 --> 01:03:32,211
Careful. It's hot.

829
01:03:32,418 --> 01:03:35,012
- Race you up to the top of the hill.
- Okay.

830
01:03:35,688 --> 01:03:37,918
First one up is a rotten egg.

831
01:03:41,227 --> 01:03:44,685
If my father's rotten,
does it mean I'll be rotten too?

832
01:03:44,897 --> 01:03:46,296
Probably.

833
01:03:46,499 --> 01:03:49,957
- What if I don't want to be?
- You can't do much about it.

834
01:03:50,169 --> 01:03:53,832
You're hopelessly locked in.
You can't avert it.

835
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,702
If you're hopeless too,
I don't mind.

836
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:58,872
What's Angela like?

837
01:03:59,078 --> 01:04:03,208
I thought we were talking
about your father.

838
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:05,115
What's she like?

839
01:04:06,853 --> 01:04:08,377
She's like America.

840
01:04:08,588 --> 01:04:11,682
She loves to fight. A good fighter.

841
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:15,054
She loves to take on
chemical companies. Like that.

842
01:04:15,261 --> 01:04:19,994
Stuff that pollutes the world.
And she loves the underdog.

843
01:04:21,033 --> 01:04:24,400
And she loves to be filled with
righteous indignation.

844
01:04:24,604 --> 01:04:28,938
She's pretty wonderful. Probably
what your father would call a pinko.

845
01:04:29,242 --> 01:04:31,506
Do you mate a lot?

846
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:34,544
What? Animals mate.

847
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:37,341
Well, you know, go to bed...
Make it.

848
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:41,077
- It's none of your damn business.
- What's it like?

849
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:43,983
Doesn't anybody talk to you,
like your father?

850
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:47,057
What do you do with your...

851
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,284
...thing?

852
01:04:48,494 --> 01:04:49,927
What do you do...

853
01:04:50,129 --> 01:04:54,088
Is this a hypothetical question or
is there a lady involved?

854
01:04:55,201 --> 01:04:57,396
Somebody going to your school?

855
01:04:57,603 --> 01:05:00,128
There's only boys in my school, dummy.

856
01:05:00,339 --> 01:05:01,738
What's her name?

857
01:05:06,345 --> 01:05:09,542
- Megan.
- Megan. You like her?

858
01:05:09,849 --> 01:05:11,783
Yeah. She goes to St. Mary's.

859
01:05:11,984 --> 01:05:15,385
We have stupid parties with them
all the time.

860
01:05:16,055 --> 01:05:19,149
Know what to do next time
you have a party?

861
01:05:19,358 --> 01:05:23,385
You go up to her, very gently.
Take her by the hand...

862
01:05:23,596 --> 01:05:28,624
...gently. You kinda pull her to you
and you jump on her bones.

863
01:05:28,834 --> 01:05:30,358
Oh, come on, Jack!

864
01:05:30,569 --> 01:05:34,369
- Are you serious? No kidding around?
- No.

865
01:05:36,042 --> 01:05:37,634
Why don't you call her?

866
01:05:37,843 --> 01:05:39,936
Play bingo or something.

867
01:05:40,146 --> 01:05:44,242
Buy her a puppy. Get her some ice
cream. Play tiddlywinks.

868
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:47,647
Jack, you're asking for it again.

869
01:05:50,022 --> 01:05:52,820
Show her how much money you have.

870
01:05:53,025 --> 01:05:56,552
Tell her you're from the
Bates Millionaire Club.

871
01:05:56,762 --> 01:05:59,356
Why won't anybody tell me?

872
01:06:00,566 --> 01:06:02,659
I was just kidding, man.

873
01:06:09,175 --> 01:06:12,542
Listen, you gotta be nice to her.

874
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:17,882
Tell her how you really feel.
Take a chance.

875
01:06:18,084 --> 01:06:20,951
Stop being so tough.
They don't like that.

876
01:06:21,153 --> 01:06:24,680
Women like it when you're
sincere. They respond too.

877
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:27,688
She'll look in your face,
check out your eyes.

878
01:06:27,893 --> 01:06:31,488
She'd really like you if you'd
show her what you're made of.

879
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:33,597
Do you know what I mean?

880
01:06:33,799 --> 01:06:36,495
And don't worry about your thing.

881
01:06:36,702 --> 01:06:38,897
Plenty of time for that.

882
01:06:39,105 --> 01:06:42,563
Just show her some of your heart,
what you're made of.

883
01:06:42,775 --> 01:06:45,107
You're made of a lot, you know.

884
01:06:49,115 --> 01:06:51,083
Yeah, but the guys at school say...

885
01:06:51,283 --> 01:06:54,810
...if you don't make it with
a girl a week, you'll go nuts.

886
01:06:55,021 --> 01:06:56,386
They're nuts.

887
01:06:57,123 --> 01:06:59,023
Don't you know that?

888
01:06:59,225 --> 01:07:03,127
Don't you know that physical love
is the easy part?

889
01:07:03,329 --> 01:07:07,857
The hard part is loving somebody
with your heart.

890
01:07:08,234 --> 01:07:09,929
That's the hard part.

891
01:07:10,136 --> 01:07:13,230
Yeah, but...
I love her with my heart.

892
01:07:13,439 --> 01:07:17,876
Well, do you ever tell her,
"I love you with all my heart"?

893
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:23,174
No. But I'm definitely gonna tell
her that I love her with all my heart.

894
01:07:23,382 --> 01:07:25,816
And then you're gonna
jump her bones?

895
01:07:26,018 --> 01:07:30,216
You gonna jump her bones?
Are you gonna jump her bones?

896
01:07:32,658 --> 01:07:35,252
Eric and I are gonna
start a newspaper tomorrow.

897
01:07:35,461 --> 01:07:37,793
I just love educational toys.

898
01:07:39,532 --> 01:07:42,057
I'll show him
how to do an interview...

899
01:07:42,268 --> 01:07:44,862
...and put it into
newspaper form.

900
01:07:45,071 --> 01:07:48,871
Use his camera.
He has a photocopier in his room.

901
01:07:49,075 --> 01:07:51,737
It's a shame
to waste that equipment.

902
01:07:51,944 --> 01:07:53,969
Wonderful. Splendid.

903
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:57,775
I was wondering if you'd
tell us how you and your wife met.

904
01:07:57,983 --> 01:08:00,713
And we'd sorta do
a practice run on you.

905
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,753
You'll have to practice
on someone else.

906
01:08:03,956 --> 01:08:06,481
- Daddy?
- It's just for your son, sir.

907
01:08:06,692 --> 01:08:10,150
It's not like everybody
doesn't know already.

908
01:08:10,996 --> 01:08:13,464
Around here.
But the boy...

909
01:08:15,568 --> 01:08:17,798
Are you ashamed of me?

910
01:08:18,904 --> 01:08:21,270
It's just the sweetest story.

911
01:08:21,474 --> 01:08:22,532
I love it.

912
01:08:22,741 --> 01:08:25,608
It's exactly like Cinderella.

913
01:08:27,813 --> 01:08:29,178
Off the record?

914
01:08:29,381 --> 01:08:32,976
- You give me your word?
- Absolutely. Off the record.

915
01:08:42,862 --> 01:08:44,420
Go ahead, sugar.

916
01:08:45,097 --> 01:08:49,864
Well, U.S. Was on his way home from
Colorado, visiting Numero Two.

917
01:08:50,069 --> 01:08:52,629
She's in a loony bin
in Colorado Springs.

918
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:56,239
What I was doing in Colorado
is irrelevant.

919
01:08:56,442 --> 01:09:01,243
It's where I might be shortly.
I think it's real relevant.

920
01:09:01,447 --> 01:09:05,383
You know, I don't believe
you know how to tell a story.

921
01:09:06,385 --> 01:09:08,853
She was a little-bitty thing.

922
01:09:09,054 --> 01:09:10,885
Scrawny, scared...

923
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:14,890
...wobbling on platform sandals.

924
01:09:16,662 --> 01:09:19,995
She was the newest, the youngest...

925
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:23,498
...and the worst waitress in the bar.

926
01:09:23,702 --> 01:09:26,728
It was a little bar outside of
Amarillo, Texas.

927
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:28,998
Right next to a motel.

928
01:09:29,808 --> 01:09:32,072
I remember she was...

929
01:09:32,411 --> 01:09:36,848
...wearing some kind of
rayon-like uniform.

930
01:09:37,049 --> 01:09:39,279
It hardly covered her.

931
01:09:39,485 --> 01:09:42,977
With some kind of
metal things on the front.

932
01:09:43,189 --> 01:09:44,747
Propellers.

933
01:09:45,658 --> 01:09:48,855
Propellers?
Is that what they were?

934
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,788
You didn't know that?

935
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:57,259
The place was called the Fly-By-
Nite. The motif was airplanes.

936
01:09:57,469 --> 01:10:02,168
All this time you didn't know
my metal things were propellers?

937
01:10:02,374 --> 01:10:05,969
You're the one
who doesn't know how to tell a story.

938
01:10:07,313 --> 01:10:09,679
U.S. Came through that door...

939
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:13,609
...like the archangel Gabriel.

940
01:10:13,819 --> 01:10:17,346
And he lifted me out of
all that misery.

941
01:10:17,556 --> 01:10:19,490
And he gave me new hair.

942
01:10:19,692 --> 01:10:22,559
And then he gave me new boobs.

943
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:24,285
And a mink coat.

944
01:10:24,496 --> 01:10:26,623
And a pink Continental.

945
01:10:26,832 --> 01:10:29,665
And a charge card at Neiman's.

946
01:10:29,868 --> 01:10:34,305
And I swear, if you don't believe
in prayers and miracles...

947
01:10:34,506 --> 01:10:36,838
...all you gotta do is look at me.

948
01:10:37,042 --> 01:10:38,031
I mean...

949
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:40,269
...I am living proof.

950
01:10:43,983 --> 01:10:46,850
What did your boobs look like before?

951
01:10:52,891 --> 01:10:55,223
Don't touch that table.

952
01:10:57,363 --> 01:10:59,058
Now get the camera ready.

953
01:10:59,265 --> 01:11:00,562
Stand over here.

954
01:11:01,133 --> 01:11:03,431
And don't forget to focus.
Okay?

955
01:11:03,636 --> 01:11:05,126
Sit in Daddy's chair.

956
01:11:05,337 --> 01:11:07,897
Why? I don't want to be
in the picture.

957
01:11:12,911 --> 01:11:15,505
What did you turn the light on for?

958
01:11:15,714 --> 01:11:18,512
Hit the button on the left
of the drawer.

959
01:11:26,025 --> 01:11:27,515
I'm waiting.

960
01:11:43,275 --> 01:11:44,970
Spoilsport.

961
01:11:51,216 --> 01:11:54,811
Your father is very strange.
Now take the picture.

962
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,920
Okay, duck.

963
01:11:59,591 --> 01:12:03,186
Now turn out the light.
Let's get out of here.

964
01:12:06,065 --> 01:12:08,158
I can't take you anywhere!

965
01:12:09,501 --> 01:12:11,469
Be careful of the table.

966
01:12:11,704 --> 01:12:13,069
Let's get out.

967
01:12:23,248 --> 01:12:27,309
- Why did you stop?
- My dominoes just went down.

968
01:12:28,654 --> 01:12:32,852
He says, "You're responsible for
the lunchroom." You know him.

969
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:36,926
I said, "Sure, yes. What'd you think?
You know that."

970
01:12:37,129 --> 01:12:40,792
And he said,
"You let that black man serve."

971
01:12:40,999 --> 01:12:44,992
I said, "Mr. Bates,
Mr. Morehouse hired him.

972
01:12:45,204 --> 01:12:47,172
I didn't hire him."

973
01:12:47,506 --> 01:12:50,964
Two more months, my pension
would've taken care of my kids.

974
01:12:51,176 --> 01:12:52,473
Can I take your photo?

975
01:12:52,678 --> 01:12:54,908
Why, sure!
Let me get fixed.

976
01:12:55,114 --> 01:12:57,912
I was employed...
What was I talking about?

977
01:12:58,117 --> 01:13:00,278
When you were in England, sir.

978
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,515
I'm so sorry.
Thank you very much.

979
01:13:03,722 --> 01:13:06,919
- I was employed by an English lord.
- Lord who, sir?

980
01:13:07,126 --> 01:13:11,256
A fellow called Lord Cavendish.
He met this fellow Bates.

981
01:13:11,463 --> 01:13:14,626
Met him in a theater queue or
somewhere.

982
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:18,462
I don't know. It turned out
they were both gamblers.

983
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:21,468
So they arranged to play
a game of billiards.

984
01:13:21,673 --> 01:13:25,109
Billiards. Take a pole,
hit the balls into pockets.

985
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:28,643
At any rate my friend,
my lord, my boss...

986
01:13:28,847 --> 01:13:32,442
...had a bit of luck
and he won a herd of cattle.

987
01:13:32,651 --> 01:13:35,848
Herefords or something.
About 700 of them.

988
01:13:36,054 --> 01:13:40,957
And Bates sent them over on a 747,
first class.

989
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:45,995
And that was 1978.
Good heavens, time goes quickly.

990
01:13:46,198 --> 01:13:48,928
Well, '79, it must have been.

991
01:13:49,134 --> 01:13:52,069
Well, Bates came over again
and he won me.

992
01:13:52,271 --> 01:13:55,331
Maybe Lord Cavendish
should get better at pool.

993
01:13:55,774 --> 01:13:57,765
God bless. God bless you.

994
01:13:57,976 --> 01:14:01,503
Here's to Cavendish.
May his pool game improve.

995
01:14:02,047 --> 01:14:05,380
- What'll we call it?
- Paste this down there.

996
01:14:05,584 --> 01:14:08,052
- Don't move that over here.
- Why not?

997
01:14:08,253 --> 01:14:10,380
It doesn't balance out.

998
01:14:10,589 --> 01:14:13,490
You put it across the top.
Big headline.

999
01:14:13,692 --> 01:14:14,989
That's a good idea.

1000
01:14:15,194 --> 01:14:17,754
You know, the morning crew
comes in at 8.

1001
01:14:17,963 --> 01:14:19,430
What morning crew?

1002
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:21,963
<i>- At the Bugle.
- So what?</i>

1003
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:26,228
Well, we need a press.
It's the only press in town, isn't it?

1004
01:14:26,438 --> 01:14:29,839
You wanna use your father's press
to print our newspaper?

1005
01:14:30,042 --> 01:14:31,566
Yeah, it'll irk him.

1006
01:14:32,544 --> 01:14:33,977
I think.

1007
01:14:38,417 --> 01:14:39,611
Got it, I got it.

1008
01:14:42,187 --> 01:14:43,950
Were you ever a thief?

1009
01:14:45,224 --> 01:14:46,316
Well, were you?

1010
01:14:46,525 --> 01:14:50,859
Don't you know it's part of the
black cultural imperative?

1011
01:14:51,663 --> 01:14:54,689
Come on. Grab this.

1012
01:14:56,301 --> 01:14:57,825
I've got the key.

1013
01:14:58,036 --> 01:15:01,870
You've got the key?
Why didn't you tell me?

1014
01:15:02,074 --> 01:15:03,132
You didn't ask.

1015
01:15:03,342 --> 01:15:04,707
I didn't ask, huh?

1016
01:15:08,714 --> 01:15:12,775
- Evening.
- Evening. Have a nice evening.

1017
01:15:15,988 --> 01:15:19,116
We really could
put out a paper every week.

1018
01:15:19,324 --> 01:15:22,987
Not just about Daddy, but
everything else that's wrong.

1019
01:15:23,929 --> 01:15:27,660
Best of all, I wouldn't have to
go back to that school.

1020
01:15:28,133 --> 01:15:30,158
Don't worry about that now.

1021
01:15:30,369 --> 01:15:33,202
The next phase is the press.

1022
01:15:33,405 --> 01:15:37,205
- No, gotta make a plate.
- Is there anything you don't know?

1023
01:15:38,844 --> 01:15:40,277
Police department?

1024
01:15:55,027 --> 01:15:58,190
<i>The Toy.
Oh, man. All right!</i>

1025
01:15:58,764 --> 01:16:00,493
- That's it!
- That is great!

1026
01:16:00,699 --> 01:16:02,826
- That's it!
- That's it!

1027
01:16:03,268 --> 01:16:05,862
- Police! Hands up!
- Let's get out of here!

1028
01:16:06,071 --> 01:16:07,834
Freeze! Put your hands up!

1029
01:16:10,409 --> 01:16:13,310
You can't arrest me.
My name is...

1030
01:16:13,612 --> 01:16:15,705
Take them in and book them.

1031
01:16:23,755 --> 01:16:25,086
What is he saying?

1032
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:29,056
And one of his gang came up
and stuck a gun in my ribs.

1033
01:16:29,261 --> 01:16:30,523
That dirty sucker!

1034
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:35,457
Pointing at me.
What's he telling them?

1035
01:16:35,834 --> 01:16:38,803
- I've got some friends.
- Wait!

1036
01:16:44,643 --> 01:16:48,306
Wait a minute. Those aren't my
friends. Is there a problem?

1037
01:16:53,051 --> 01:16:56,077
- Yes, there is.
- You're in big trouble.

1038
01:17:13,538 --> 01:17:17,998
Can you give me $10 for a cab?
All I need is 10. Just $10.

1039
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:35,752
Here you go.
Read this paper.

1040
01:17:35,961 --> 01:17:39,124
Sir? Sir?
Did you read that paper?

1041
01:17:40,298 --> 01:17:42,562
Get your paper!
Read all about it!

1042
01:17:42,768 --> 01:17:44,201
Here you go.

1043
01:17:48,473 --> 01:17:52,375
Read about how U.S. Bates
found his wife one day...

1044
01:17:52,577 --> 01:17:54,704
Holy shit!

1045
01:17:55,013 --> 01:17:56,776
Get your paper!

1046
01:17:57,983 --> 01:17:59,314
Paper. Free paper.

1047
01:17:59,518 --> 01:18:01,213
What do you think,
Mr. O'Brien?

1048
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:04,014
Forget you know me.

1049
01:18:05,157 --> 01:18:07,785
Jack, I gave out my last one.

1050
01:18:07,993 --> 01:18:10,860
Me too.
Let's go fishing.

1051
01:18:11,063 --> 01:18:14,624
Oh, man, am I tired!
Thank God this is over.

1052
01:18:23,275 --> 01:18:24,867
Mr. Bates, sir...

1053
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:27,205
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1054
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:32,748
Take a look at the newspaper
distributed by Eric and Mr. Brown.

1055
01:18:38,557 --> 01:18:43,290
- Eric is responsible for this?
- And Jack Brown, sir.

1056
01:18:44,062 --> 01:18:46,929
I want them both here...

1057
01:18:47,132 --> 01:18:50,192
...in my office, now.

1058
01:18:55,474 --> 01:18:58,136
<i>Attention, Jaok Brown
and Master Bates.</i>

1059
01:18:58,343 --> 01:19:03,178
<i>Report immediately to the offioe.
Repeat, immediately.</i>

1060
01:19:04,382 --> 01:19:06,748
<i>- Yes, you two.
- Okay.</i>

1061
01:19:09,521 --> 01:19:11,853
Would you have me stay or go?

1062
01:19:16,595 --> 01:19:17,823
Come in.

1063
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:24,992
Take a seat.

1064
01:19:30,542 --> 01:19:34,945
Eric, how many of those papers
did you hand out?

1065
01:19:35,147 --> 01:19:36,774
About a thousand.

1066
01:19:37,482 --> 01:19:40,474
I want each paper accounted for.

1067
01:19:40,685 --> 01:19:43,654
And then I want them shredded.

1068
01:19:43,855 --> 01:19:46,790
Let Carter do it.
I want you back here.

1069
01:19:47,692 --> 01:19:50,786
We'll make even more tomorrow
and sell them...

1070
01:19:50,996 --> 01:19:55,456
- That's one trick you won't manage.
- You wanna bet?

1071
01:19:56,101 --> 01:19:59,593
I assume, Brown, you know
the penalties for libel?

1072
01:19:59,805 --> 01:20:04,640
- Everyone knows it's true.
- They're lies if I say so.

1073
01:20:04,843 --> 01:20:07,505
- But it's the truth.
- The truth?

1074
01:20:10,515 --> 01:20:13,177
Truth has nothing to do with reality.

1075
01:20:13,785 --> 01:20:16,413
You have to deal with reality.

1076
01:20:17,189 --> 01:20:22,024
In reality, any one of these people,
with a little persuasion...

1077
01:20:22,227 --> 01:20:25,060
...will say what I want them to say...

1078
01:20:25,263 --> 01:20:27,925
...because I am reality.

1079
01:20:32,737 --> 01:20:34,830
Take your pants down.

1080
01:20:38,343 --> 01:20:42,837
I said, take your pants down.
Right here. Right now.

1081
01:20:46,718 --> 01:20:50,552
- I have to?
- Well, if you value your job.

1082
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:00,261
That's reality.

1083
01:21:08,506 --> 01:21:09,530
Get dressed.

1084
01:21:11,076 --> 01:21:15,638
<i>Mr. Brown, maybe I could use
your talents on The Bugle.</i>

1085
01:21:16,014 --> 01:21:19,814
- Cleaning lady get fired?
- Start Monday, in the newsroom.

1086
01:21:20,285 --> 01:21:23,482
A press card, salary, everything.

1087
01:21:28,693 --> 01:21:30,160
Your hand?

1088
01:21:50,582 --> 01:21:52,607
It's that bad out there?

1089
01:21:53,418 --> 01:21:54,680
Worse.

1090
01:22:14,773 --> 01:22:18,504
I got a job.
I guess I can be happy about that.

1091
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:21,411
Why are you so happy about it?

1092
01:22:21,613 --> 01:22:26,949
My father will tell you to drop
your pants, and you're gonna do it.

1093
01:22:27,552 --> 01:22:31,511
He treats people like nothing.
Didn't you read our paper?

1094
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:33,687
I can see the headline:

1095
01:22:33,892 --> 01:22:37,953
"Jack Brown Sold Out Today
to U.S. Bates, as Expected."

1096
01:22:38,163 --> 01:22:40,825
You want me to starve to death?

1097
01:22:41,032 --> 01:22:44,695
I can't feed myself
on high ideas and principles.

1098
01:22:44,903 --> 01:22:47,167
I thought you were world-class.

1099
01:22:47,772 --> 01:22:52,266
Your head's in this American dream,
but it doesn't work for me.

1100
01:22:52,477 --> 01:22:57,813
Truth, justice and the American way
do not work for me, okay?

1101
01:22:58,350 --> 01:23:00,784
I gotta play in the grownup world.

1102
01:23:00,986 --> 01:23:04,478
- You could've come to Houston with me.
- As your toy?

1103
01:23:04,689 --> 01:23:06,987
No, as my friend.

1104
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:15,598
Damn, man. I am your friend, Eric.

1105
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:29,876
- It's the senator!
- Senator Newcomb. Congratulations!

1106
01:23:42,961 --> 01:23:44,087
Senator Newcomb.

1107
01:23:53,638 --> 01:23:57,972
- Who's that?
- Angela. Jesus H. Christ!

1108
01:23:58,176 --> 01:23:59,473
That her full name?

1109
01:23:59,677 --> 01:24:01,645
Greetings, senator!

1110
01:24:01,846 --> 01:24:04,713
Oh, U.S., it's good to see you.

1111
01:24:04,916 --> 01:24:08,545
- You remember Terry Gay? My secretary.
- I sure do!

1112
01:24:08,753 --> 01:24:12,712
- You look good enough to eat.
- Say, what is all this?

1113
01:24:12,924 --> 01:24:16,860
I think it's the orchestra.
Come in. Party's in the back.

1114
01:24:17,062 --> 01:24:19,257
Senator, darling.

1115
01:24:20,732 --> 01:24:22,063
My wife.

1116
01:24:22,267 --> 01:24:25,498
We're not getting back in the bus.

1117
01:24:25,703 --> 01:24:29,264
Now, we can legally protest. We are...

1118
01:24:29,474 --> 01:24:31,203
You're Mr. Brown's...

1119
01:24:31,409 --> 01:24:34,435
He's raising money for the KKK fund.

1120
01:24:37,916 --> 01:24:40,282
The auction is tomorrow!

1121
01:24:40,485 --> 01:24:43,045
- Let's talk.
- What are you doing here?

1122
01:24:43,254 --> 01:24:45,814
What's going on? Where you going?

1123
01:24:46,024 --> 01:24:49,187
What are you doing?
Somebody could get hurt.

1124
01:24:49,394 --> 01:24:51,885
- I'm trying to help.
- You're not.

1125
01:24:52,097 --> 01:24:56,557
- They're raising money for the KKK.
- Lf you ever loved me, trust me.

1126
01:24:56,768 --> 01:25:01,330
- I'll take care of it. This is Eric.
- Nice to meet you.

1127
01:25:01,539 --> 01:25:04,440
Nice to meet you. You better be right.

1128
01:25:04,642 --> 01:25:08,373
You'd better be right.
Let's get back in the van.

1129
01:25:18,022 --> 01:25:21,890
Nobody throws a garden party
like U.S. Bates.

1130
01:25:25,163 --> 01:25:29,224
I appreciate you throwing
this party for us.

1131
01:25:29,434 --> 01:25:32,995
Old Democrats don't usually
support young Liberals.

1132
01:25:33,204 --> 01:25:38,141
Senator, we agreed to keep this
under our hats, remember?

1133
01:25:38,343 --> 01:25:41,642
If they knew it was a fundraiser,
we'd be alone.

1134
01:25:41,846 --> 01:25:45,043
- We wouldn't want that, would we?
- Pardon me.

1135
01:25:46,985 --> 01:25:50,580
You remember my pal
and fellow Klan member, Clancy.

1136
01:25:50,788 --> 01:25:53,222
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

1137
01:25:53,424 --> 01:25:55,984
The Klan really thanks you.

1138
01:25:56,194 --> 01:25:59,527
Democrats don't normally
support us in the open.

1139
01:25:59,731 --> 01:26:03,667
We agreed to keep that
under our hat, remember?

1140
01:26:03,868 --> 01:26:07,736
If they knew this was a fundraiser,
we'd be all alone.

1141
01:26:07,939 --> 01:26:10,635
Come on over and meet the senator.

1142
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:14,171
Meet my friend Clarence.

1143
01:26:14,379 --> 01:26:18,577
This is the senator. Photographer!

1144
01:26:18,783 --> 01:26:21,946
Take a little picture.
And make it good.

1145
01:26:24,222 --> 01:26:26,156
Hang on to your seat!

1146
01:26:33,298 --> 01:26:34,731
Hi, Dad!

1147
01:26:35,967 --> 01:26:38,731
What are you doing here, you asshole?

1148
01:26:38,937 --> 01:26:42,737
The question is,
what the hell you doing here?

1149
01:26:42,941 --> 01:26:43,930
You're fired!

1150
01:26:44,142 --> 01:26:46,975
You know who you're
taking a photo with?

1151
01:26:47,178 --> 01:26:48,338
No. Who?

1152
01:26:48,546 --> 01:26:51,640
The Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.

1153
01:26:52,383 --> 01:26:55,113
That'll surprise a lot of your voters.

1154
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:59,017
Mr. Bates'll get a lot of mileage
out of that photo.

1155
01:26:59,357 --> 01:27:04,556
- You're fired.
- Are the FCC, IRS, or FBI after you?

1156
01:27:05,997 --> 01:27:10,434
He doesn't know what he's saying.
Music! Everybody dance.

1157
01:27:10,635 --> 01:27:13,468
- Let's get him!
- Holy shit!

1158
01:27:23,748 --> 01:27:27,377
- Go for the tents!
- I'll get the other side!

1159
01:27:27,585 --> 01:27:29,416
Get the tents!

1160
01:27:31,923 --> 01:27:33,481
Duck, you suckers!

1161
01:27:36,327 --> 01:27:38,852
- Senator...
- Later, Bates.

1162
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:43,496
Fair-weather friend, the bastard.
I told you to dance!

1163
01:27:43,701 --> 01:27:44,690
Yes, sir!

1164
01:27:44,902 --> 01:27:46,836
Don't jump her. Just dance!

1165
01:27:47,038 --> 01:27:50,667
- Let's get them again!
- Let's go back for another try.

1166
01:27:51,576 --> 01:27:54,807
- Here they come again!
- Do your thing, Jack!

1167
01:27:56,948 --> 01:27:59,974
All right, war has been declared!

1168
01:28:02,587 --> 01:28:04,452
You show them, Jack!

1169
01:28:06,891 --> 01:28:08,552
Angela, this is for you!

1170
01:28:14,699 --> 01:28:17,463
What's the matter? I'm in the back.

1171
01:28:17,669 --> 01:28:21,867
- Hang on, wizard! Let's go to Oz.
- Let me off!

1172
01:28:22,073 --> 01:28:24,268
You want to get off here?

1173
01:28:25,410 --> 01:28:28,436
Way to go, Jack! All right!

1174
01:28:31,883 --> 01:28:35,979
You look like an Eskimo Pie.
No, I've got it. Al Jolson.

1175
01:28:36,187 --> 01:28:39,782
- Jack, look out!
- I'll give you an Eskimo Pie!

1176
01:28:39,991 --> 01:28:42,084
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1177
01:28:53,104 --> 01:28:55,971
<i>Fräulein, this is for you!</i>

1178
01:28:57,942 --> 01:29:00,103
I've had enough of this.

1179
01:29:00,645 --> 01:29:04,103
- Put that pie down!
- I didn't throw the first pie.

1180
01:29:04,315 --> 01:29:06,215
Klansman, let's go.

1181
01:29:16,694 --> 01:29:18,025
Why, you nitwit!

1182
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:28,031
Let's get out of here!

1183
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:30,707
- Move it!
- I'll get you!

1184
01:29:31,275 --> 01:29:35,541
- You trying to kill the kid?
- No! I'm trying to kill you.

1185
01:29:35,747 --> 01:29:37,544
Come on, Jack. Hurry up.

1186
01:29:41,886 --> 01:29:45,720
I'll get you!
There's no way to get away!

1187
01:29:45,923 --> 01:29:49,120
- Can't you go faster?
- I'm hurrying.

1188
01:29:53,164 --> 01:29:56,497
- Look out!
- You can't get away!

1189
01:29:56,701 --> 01:29:57,565
Look out!

1190
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:08,602
Holy cow! It works!

1191
01:30:09,547 --> 01:30:11,242
Daddy!

1192
01:30:12,717 --> 01:30:14,947
He's in trouble!

1193
01:30:18,656 --> 01:30:20,146
But I can't swim!

1194
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:26,653
You dirty son of a bitch!

1195
01:30:27,064 --> 01:30:30,522
What? I can't hear you, Mr. Bates.

1196
01:30:33,037 --> 01:30:34,334
Come on. Get out!

1197
01:30:37,542 --> 01:30:39,806
Daddy, are you okay?

1198
01:30:40,044 --> 01:30:42,103
Thank you, Jack. Thank you.

1199
01:30:56,928 --> 01:31:00,625
Mr. Bates, please don't shoot me!

1200
01:31:04,569 --> 01:31:06,196
Come in.

1201
01:31:13,377 --> 01:31:16,904
You saved my life.
So I guess I owe you one.

1202
01:31:25,223 --> 01:31:30,024
After what I did to your party,
I think we're even, okay?

1203
01:31:30,228 --> 01:31:33,493
You know, that kid loves you.

1204
01:31:34,031 --> 01:31:35,862
He never loved me.

1205
01:31:36,067 --> 01:31:39,468
Sorry to hear that.
Try talking to him.

1206
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:43,731
Yeah, I talk to him.
But he won't talk to me.

1207
01:31:46,477 --> 01:31:49,640
Your son loves you.
You gotta hug him.

1208
01:31:49,914 --> 01:31:51,814
You mean, physically?

1209
01:31:52,016 --> 01:31:55,952
Have you ever let your son
sit on your lap...

1210
01:31:56,153 --> 01:31:59,384
...and put your arms around him
and talk to him?

1211
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:02,718
Pretend I'm Eric,
and I'm home for a week.

1212
01:32:02,927 --> 01:32:07,557
"Dad, I haven't seen you in a while!
I wanna sit on your lap!"

1213
01:32:07,765 --> 01:32:10,427
- Are you crazy?
- Yes, but trust me.

1214
01:32:10,635 --> 01:32:14,002
"Come on, Dad, let's sit down!
Come on!"

1215
01:32:14,405 --> 01:32:19,001
"Pops, how you doing?
Boy, I had a great time all year."

1216
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:23,078
I'll sit in your lap.
"How you doing?" Hug me. Come on.

1217
01:32:23,281 --> 01:32:26,944
- Hug me and say, "I love you."
- I love you.

1218
01:32:27,151 --> 01:32:29,483
- Say it louder.
- I love you!

1219
01:32:37,728 --> 01:32:40,219
You kinky little devil, you!

1220
01:33:28,713 --> 01:33:31,648
I want you to understand something.

1221
01:33:32,116 --> 01:33:36,052
Whenever I drill an oil well,
buy a cable system...

1222
01:33:36,253 --> 01:33:39,450
...open a store, it's for you.

1223
01:33:40,257 --> 01:33:44,318
When you grow up, you'll control
South Central Louisiana.

1224
01:33:44,528 --> 01:33:46,393
And that's some trick.

1225
01:33:46,697 --> 01:33:50,497
Jack says life's about people,
not about your power.

1226
01:33:50,701 --> 01:33:54,296
He has no power.
Of course it's people for him.

1227
01:33:54,505 --> 01:33:56,405
He has nothing else.

1228
01:33:56,907 --> 01:33:59,808
He says friends
are most important.

1229
01:34:00,011 --> 01:34:02,275
I'm trying to talk to you.

1230
01:34:02,713 --> 01:34:07,878
He says you don't have any friends
and that you know two kinds of people:

1231
01:34:08,085 --> 01:34:12,749
- Ones that owe you and ones you owe.
- I've heard enough about Jack.

1232
01:34:12,957 --> 01:34:14,254
That's it!

1233
01:34:19,964 --> 01:34:23,365
Eric, I'm trying. Give me a chance.

1234
01:34:26,103 --> 01:34:30,005
How about you and me
going to Europe together?

1235
01:34:30,207 --> 01:34:33,574
There's no reason for you
to go back to camp.

1236
01:34:33,778 --> 01:34:37,009
We'll go to London, Paris, Rome.

1237
01:34:43,454 --> 01:34:45,752
It might have been a nice trip.

1238
01:34:57,168 --> 01:35:00,296
Good to see you.
How are things going?

1239
01:35:00,504 --> 01:35:02,904
The storm is moving southwest...

1240
01:35:03,107 --> 01:35:06,634
...so there's really no problem...
Mr. Bates! Eric!

1241
01:35:12,049 --> 01:35:15,485
Jesus! Come on,
follow that kid!

1242
01:35:28,099 --> 01:35:31,193
- Put it on my dad's bill.
- Okay, kid.

1243
01:35:34,739 --> 01:35:37,708
No. Running away, what is that?

1244
01:35:37,908 --> 01:35:40,468
- I wanna stay with you.
- No!

1245
01:35:45,516 --> 01:35:49,577
I don't like this mean game
you're playing with your dad.

1246
01:35:49,787 --> 01:35:54,247
He's reaching out to you.
He's making an effort. You're not.

1247
01:35:54,592 --> 01:35:58,926
You're a better person than that.
Give the man a break.

1248
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:03,994
Please.

1249
01:36:10,407 --> 01:36:11,897
Come here, man.

1250
01:36:14,011 --> 01:36:17,242
- I love you, Jack.
- I love you too, Eric.

1251
01:36:17,448 --> 01:36:20,144
But I want you to do what's right.

1252
01:36:21,018 --> 01:36:25,580
You, your father and me gotta be
the strangest people on earth.

1253
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:27,052
Do you know that?

1254
01:36:42,573 --> 01:36:44,871
I want you to do what's right.

1255
01:36:58,989 --> 01:37:03,824
If you love him and if you need him,
you gotta tell him so.

1256
01:37:04,228 --> 01:37:07,959
If ever two people needed
each other, it's you two.

1257
01:37:17,708 --> 01:37:19,039
You know...

1258
01:37:20,244 --> 01:37:21,905
...he's right.

1259
01:37:22,947 --> 01:37:26,678
I do need you. And I love you.

1260
01:37:28,919 --> 01:37:32,286
I love you, Daddy. I really love you.

1261
01:37:37,728 --> 01:37:39,821
I really love you.

1262
01:37:43,367 --> 01:37:45,232
Get in the car, son.

1263
01:37:48,038 --> 01:37:51,530
- You know that job I offered you?
- On the newspaper?

1264
01:37:51,942 --> 01:37:53,603
It's for real.

1265
01:37:54,378 --> 01:37:58,644
- You won't be sorry, U.S.
- "You ass." You're allowed.

1266
01:38:00,851 --> 01:38:03,319
Next year, he'll have two weeks.

1267
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,284
One week with me, one week with you.

1268
01:38:06,490 --> 01:38:08,515
All right!

1269
01:38:09,627 --> 01:38:11,822
- Take it easy.
- See you later!

1270
01:38:12,029 --> 01:38:13,894
To the airport, Mr. Bates?

1271
01:38:14,098 --> 01:38:16,794
- You're okay, "us."
- I'm okay, me too.

1272
01:38:17,001 --> 01:38:19,629
All right, I'll see you next year.

1273
01:38:20,137 --> 01:38:23,834
Hey, Jack. You got some rich friends.

1274
01:38:27,544 --> 01:38:31,105
That's all right, Roberts.
Oh, Mr. Brown!

1275
01:38:31,315 --> 01:38:35,718
- You want to talk to me?
- I don't know if you remember me.

1276
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,480
I'm Honey Russell, the D.A.'s wife.

1277
01:38:38,689 --> 01:38:42,625
We met at the Bates' party.
I want to talk to you a bit.

1278
01:38:42,826 --> 01:38:46,353
Fancy and I were talking
the other day...

1279
01:38:46,563 --> 01:38:50,465
...about the wonderful job
you've done with U.S.'s son.

1280
01:38:50,668 --> 01:38:55,128
Is it possible for you to come
and spend a few weeks with us...

1281
01:38:55,339 --> 01:38:58,536
...and sort of help us
with our son, Eugene?

1282
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:01,039
Up yours, you mother!

1283
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:07,815
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown! Gosh!
He'll never do that again. Please!

1284
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:13,080
Mr. Brown, please!
