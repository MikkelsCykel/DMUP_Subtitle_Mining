00:00:52,237 --> 00:00:56,071 
I am. It makes you not. 
You are an idiot.

00:00:56,237 --> 00:00:59,149 
That you can be.

00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:04,753 
Now, no one tøse boy. 
Do not worry.

00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:21,268 
Okay ...

00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:11,505 
I think it is nice,

00:02:11,677 --> 00:02:15,556 
It was ... 
Civiliseret.

00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:18,550 
Yes. 

16 
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:25,352 
It was good to see you. 
In the same way. Hello. 

17 
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:36,991

00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,115

00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:42,791

00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:45,391

00:02:45,557 --> 00:02:48,993 
Bye. 

22 
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:02,992 
Hello. 
Hello. 

23 
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:11,308 
EKSERNE 

24 
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,467 
Would you like to join up? 

25 
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:21,668 
No. 

26 
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:26,433 
It is not you. You are beautiful. 
But it is late. 

27 
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:31,751 
I also according to the girls at 
work has warned you against me. 

28 
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:35,432 
They have enough to say that I am a ... 

29 
00:03:35,597 --> 00:03:39,749 
I have a history with them, 
and it would be best for both of us 

30 
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:44,388 
if you learned my true self 
to know first. 

31 
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:52,231 
How old are you? 24? 25? 
23. 

32 
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:55,833 
I am 31 years. 
Do you know what that means? 

33 
00:03:55,997 --> 00:04:00,832 
It means that I can not risk 
around and bowl all kinds of girls. 

34 
00:04:00,997 --> 00:04:06,469 
Often I never talk with them again. 
It is both rude and immature. 

35 
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:09,549 
And it is shit embarrassing. 

36 
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:17,749 
At one point you are 
after more than just to have sex. 

37 
00:04:19,357 --> 00:04:23,032 
Do you know what I mean? 

38 
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:29,033 
So I go. I am, and I ask, 
I have to call later this week. 

39 
00:04:33,597 --> 00:04:36,350 
I follow you up to the door. 

40 
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:38,951 
FØRSTEDATE 

41 
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:45,113 
You are so sexy. How have I 
caught in a girl like you? 

42 
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:48,349 
It has been out here for four days. 

43 
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:51,907 
You must stop 
to live as a pig. 

44 
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:58,186 
How often should I say this to you? 
And what is it with shoes? 

45 
00:04:58,357 --> 00:05:01,793 
See them ... Clear, however. 
See all the shoes! 

46 
00:05:01,957 --> 00:05:07,634 
They can not all be your? 
If the shoe is, Dave? 

47 
00:05:07,797 --> 00:05:13,872 
No, I have said it 4000 times. 
And it is not considered to be an idiot. 

48 
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:17,029 
Oh God ... 
You are so sexy. 

49 
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:19,267 
Is she sexy? 

50 
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:24,589 
We go in the room. 
First, I have a little kagedej. 

51 
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:29,273 
Should we enjoy ourselves with kagedej? 
I shall, in any case. 

52 
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:33,828 
What would you do? 
Eat it. 

53 
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:39,395 
What are you doing home? 
Why are you not out of date? 

54 
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:50,387 
What are you doing here? 
You have freedom of tomorrow. Go However, in the city. 

55 
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:53,674 
You can not just sit here and lumre. 

56 
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:57,955 
It is Friday night! You are young! 
Do you know what I mean? 

57 
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:02,550 
Go out and knep. 
It is Friday night! 

58 
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:07,233 
Hello, it is the party? 
Where is it? 

59 
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:10,116 
BOFÆLLERNE 

60 
00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:13,747 
It is Tuesday. 

61 
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:18,785 
Dave? 

62 
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:22,154 
Dave! 

63 
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:30,152 
Inez so good tonight, right? 
Sexy? 

64 
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:33,946 
Cool and sexy? 

65 
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:42,268 
So I thought ... 

66 
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:49,146 
Would you like to join in to my room? 

67 
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:52,195 
Together with us? 

68 
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:03,305 
OK. 

69 
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,556 
I. OPTAKT 

70 
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,792 
How did that happen? 
It is still in progress. 

71 
00:07:37,477 --> 00:07:40,435 
Ken? 

72 
00:07:40,597 --> 00:07:46,513 
Will you do me a favour? 
Look not in the toilet and outside. Okay? 

73 
00:07:57,517 --> 00:08:01,908 
I am not one who does not eat. 
Fridge used to be full. 

74 
00:08:02,077 --> 00:08:07,390 
But I was a full day and lost 
drikkepengene somewhere 

75 
00:08:07,557 --> 00:08:10,913 
so I could not buy. 

76 
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:15,912 
I have bad news, and I hope 
do not you think I'm strange. 

77 
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:20,787 
But I have only cider. 

78 
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:28,070 
Blege means of teeth? 
Is that it? 

79 
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:33,436 
In the toilet Community? 
Do you think my teeth are too white? 

80 
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:37,431 
It is a bra in the living room, 
so you think enough, I'm sloppy. 

81 
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:43,149 
My teeth are white, because I as 
child slept under some special lamps. 

82 
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:51,150 
I was mørkeræd, so my parents 
bought some special lamps. 

83 
00:08:51,317 --> 00:08:55,629 
But they did just 
my teeth very white. 

84 
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:04,834 
"Berrycuda" ... Well. 

85 
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:08,194 
Refreshing. 

86 
00:09:09,357 --> 00:09:14,033 
When you say "lights" ... 
Well, that was a lie. 

87 
00:09:14,197 --> 00:09:18,076 
I do not know why I said it. 
There were no lamps. 

88 
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:23,869 
I'm just not used to be 
guys with the home on the first date. 

89 
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:29,634 
Listen here ... I've looked in many 
toilet create while I "tisset". 

90 
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:33,267 
You have probably not something in it, 
that would scare me away. 

91 
00:09:33,437 --> 00:09:36,986 
You seem enough, I'm sloppy. 
No. since. 

92 
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:43,789 
Yes, I think you're sloppy. 
But it is sgu just as much? 

93 
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:48,872 
It is not, therefore I am here. 
I am here because I think of you. 

94 
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:51,346 
I could not care less messy. 

95 
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:56,750 
Or that barnepigen from 
Muppet. Babyerne have been here. 

96 
00:09:56,917 --> 00:10:02,833 
Relax. I am not playing detective. 
Think not of what I think. 

97 
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:07,752 
We must le, we must talk, 
we must drink. Sound good? 

98 
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,670 
Yes. 

99 
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:14,476 
There is a problem. 
What? 

100 
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:21,031 
I would not drink it. 
No, it tastes as coins. 

101 
00:10:21,197 --> 00:10:23,392 
Come here. 

102 
00:10:26,957 --> 00:10:28,834 
Sorry. 

103 
00:10:36,197 --> 00:10:40,349 
I am full. What about you? 
Perhaps we have waited too long. 

104 
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:45,352 
Imagine if everything goes ... 
Do you think this is wise? 

105 
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:49,829 
I understand you, homo, but pay attention, 
I repeat it is not. 

106 
00:10:49,997 --> 00:10:54,309 
I would prefer not to date again, 
for all my guys have deceived me. 

107 
00:10:54,477 --> 00:10:57,071 
Apart from me, because we have not ... 

108 
00:10:57,237 --> 00:11:01,674 
If I do not have sex, I fall 
I just one of an idiot again. 

109 
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:06,957 
And you are the only man 
I can stand to look at right now. 

110 
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:10,905 
And you were smitten in a møgluder ... 
Run you right. 

111 
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:14,626 
As dissed you for seven months 
ago and was part against you in six years. 

112 
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:21,032 
Six years and four months. 
You need sex. In severe. 

113 
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:26,749 
Just focusing on that you need to 
have emptied bollerne. With the same. 

114 
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:31,274 
It is the only thing you have to think of 
for det her handler kun om det. 

115 
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:36,636 
I just will not break anything. 
Sometimes it means something. 

116 
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:42,030 
Sometimes kærtegner Monday face, 
Merging fingers, 

117 
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:44,870 
and whispers sweet words in your ear. 

118 
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:50,157 
And sometimes an explosion an explosion. 
Run on empty bollerne and fall asleep. 

119 
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:54,356 
And that is what we will do, 
This is what you have friends. 

120 
00:11:54,517 --> 00:12:00,069 
Then follow the plan and beverage, 
for then you get a blowjob. 

121 
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:03,946 
Will you? 

122 
00:12:10,157 --> 00:12:13,467 
Are you ready? 
Trimmet bottom? 

123 
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:16,356 
Yes. 
Give me five! 

124 
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:26,510 
Lovely. 

125 
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:32,434 
Yes, I got so much wine, 
when I was promoted. 

126 
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:38,069 
No, I thought this opportunity. 

127 
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:43,709 
Oh well. 
It also followed with promotion. 

128 
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:48,387 
But wine is also good. 

129 
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:53,995 
I am surprised, 
of course, you hate wine. 

130 
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:57,388 
Now I like it. 

131 
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:07,389 
Jasmine beats me to death. 

132 
00:13:07,557 --> 00:13:11,994 
Why? 
She is overprotective. 

133 
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:15,593 
I have not told it to anyone. 

134 
00:13:15,757 --> 00:13:19,830 
I was afraid they would say, 
that it was a stupid idea, 

135 
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:23,307 
or be happy, 
that we were together again. 

136 
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:26,628 
Or something. 

137 
00:13:28,077 --> 00:13:30,193 
Are you still? 

138 
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:33,155 
Sorry. 
No. Continue. 

139 
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:36,992 
I allowed just mouth run. 

140 
00:13:41,317 --> 00:13:43,877 
This is åndssvagt. 

141 
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:51,507 
Can you see? 
It need not be embarrassing. 

142 
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:57,912 
I thought we would chat a bit 
and then be a little horny. 

143 
00:13:58,077 --> 00:14:02,229 
And then we would go their separate ways. 
It thought I also. 

144 
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:05,707 
No, you did not. 
Look at your blouse. 

145 
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:08,630 
Look at your clothes. 

146 
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:12,710 
Kavalergang. 
I try. 

147 
00:14:12,877 --> 00:14:18,634 
The kind of blouses are designed to 
to get guys like me home. 

148 
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:22,995 
Guys like you? 
Men, which appears on babser. 

149 
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:25,148 
You are wrong. 

150 
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:30,471 
It is designed to get guys who 
you to want to come home. 

151 
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:34,789 
Now, I understand. 
Are you with? 

152 
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:40,156 
Yes. You would fill me with remorse. 
Anger is good. 

153 
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:44,196 
And it was not your intention 
to get me home? 

154 
00:14:44,357 --> 00:14:48,032 
No. 
I feel a slow down. 

155 
00:14:48,197 --> 00:14:52,031 
It was nice to see you. 
Greet Jasmine. 

156 
00:14:52,197 --> 00:14:55,872 
Greet your mother from me. 
I will. 

157 
00:14:56,037 --> 00:14:58,232 
You will not do. 

158 
00:15:02,877 --> 00:15:05,311 
Andrew? 
What? 

159 
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:10,631 
What is it? 
This is your birthday. 

160 
00:15:10,797 --> 00:15:15,154 
I would not take all 
opmærksomheden. I love you. 

161 
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:28,393 
You are the best. 
I am not so bad. 

162 
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:32,345 
Happy Birthday. 

163 
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:35,475 
Good night, sweetheart. 

164 
00:15:40,157 --> 00:15:43,149 
Abby ... 
Andrew. 

165 
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:47,350 
Abby ... 
Andrew. 

166 
00:15:47,517 --> 00:15:50,987 
I do not know 
I feel like tonight. 

167 
00:15:51,157 --> 00:15:53,148 
Was that a question? 

168 
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:57,549 
No. I am tired. 

169 
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:04,072 
There has just been 
so busy at work. 

170 
00:16:04,237 --> 00:16:08,230 
And I do not think 
that the new glasses are good. 

171 
00:16:08,397 --> 00:16:12,709 
I get tired in the eyes, 
and they hurt. 

172 
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:17,109 
And we ate a lot of pasta, 
so I'm just not in the mood for it. 

173 
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,871 
When will you be in the mood for it? 

174 
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:25,509 
Do you want a certain date? 
What about tomorrow or the weekend? 

175 
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:27,907 
We have not loved in three weeks. 

176 
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:32,707 
It is not three weeks ago. 
When we last loved? 

177 
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:37,395 
Andrew! 
Should I keep track? 

178 
00:16:37,557 --> 00:16:42,631 
The answer should always be "yesterday". 
No one does it every night. 

179 
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:48,110 
It makes Malcolm and Beatrice. 
They are chiropractors, so they lie. 

180 
00:16:48,277 --> 00:16:51,587 
I love you. 
I also love you. 

181 
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:56,785 
I need orgasmer, Andrew. 
I know this well. 

182 
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:02,036 
Okay. 
We do it. 

183 
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:08,113 
We do it now. 
I would do it. I'm ready. 

184 
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,747 
I am pleased. 

185 
00:17:15,597 --> 00:17:19,715 
Taxes? 
I thought you would start. 

186 
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:25,634 
I begin always. 
Will not you start this time? 

187 
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:32,509 
You are already switched on. You can start 
with me, so I make. 

188 
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:36,465 
No. 
For I know your number. 

189 
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:40,949 
You never use your mouth first. 
You wait until I do it. 

190 
00:17:41,117 --> 00:17:44,746 
And you're on, and passionate 

191 
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:49,274 
and may you just 
take me with the same 

192 
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:53,271 
and jump opportune my turn. 

193 
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:56,349 
I do not think it fits. 
Gu makes it all! 

194 
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:59,873 
How can you pretend otherwise? 

195 
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:05,595 
What's wrong with us? 
I would of course like to do it now. 

196 
00:18:05,757 --> 00:18:10,751 
You will have the passion and excitement. 
I am running on! 

197 
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:16,956 
What do you do? 

198 
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:20,826 
It's great. 

199 
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,146 
It's great. 

200 
00:18:31,997 --> 00:18:34,227 
Are you ready? 
Yes. 

201 
00:18:34,397 --> 00:18:39,630 
Are they new? 
Yes. 

202 
00:18:39,797 --> 00:18:44,951 
They look expensive. I thought 
we should be united on expensive purchases. 

203 
00:18:46,717 --> 00:18:51,313 
Andrew ... 
Sorry. 

204 
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:11,632 
So? 
I am not. 

205 
00:20:11,797 --> 00:20:16,154 
I said no, 
but I just look at 

206 
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:19,468 
and do my thing. 

207 
00:20:19,637 --> 00:20:24,028 
Well. 
I have always thought that you were sweet. 

208 
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:27,030 
Yes. 
Okay. 

209 
00:20:27,197 --> 00:20:31,588 
We do not always agree on everything, 
and sometimes I hate you sgu. 

210 
00:20:31,757 --> 00:20:36,911 
But we move soon, and we have 
I will bring it here, and here you are. 

211 
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:43,869 
I have always thought that you were ... 
She has always said you were sweet. 

212 
00:20:44,037 --> 00:20:47,234 
And we love each other so much. 
I love you. 

213 
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:50,707 
You are so sexy. 
Oh, how I love you! 

214 
00:20:50,877 --> 00:20:54,665 
You are the sexiest 
woman in the world. 

215 
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,954 
We will have new friends today. 

216 
00:21:01,757 --> 00:21:05,067 
There may be a problem. 
Is it me? 

217 
00:21:05,237 --> 00:21:08,468 
She is sexy, no? 

218 
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:12,994 
Yes, you are fantastic. 

219 
00:21:13,157 --> 00:21:17,116 
There is something that makes 

220 
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:21,236 
that I might not 
like it here. 

221 
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:38,876 
Gord? 
What? 

222 
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:45,469 
It? Is this the problem? 
That I knew very well. 

223 
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,276 
It will be great. 

224 
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:51,156 
Did you know? 
Are you on? 

225 
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:55,071 
How knew you? 
Now you are in any case, no? 

226 
00:21:55,237 --> 00:21:57,910 
Should I? 
Yes, certainly. 

227 
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:05,232 
Oh god. It is so frækt. 
You are so sexy. 

228 
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:08,594 
Just get going! 

229 
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:12,627 
It's great. 

230 
00:22:14,397 --> 00:22:17,548 
II. FORSPIL 

231 
00:22:21,117 --> 00:22:25,474 
It is so nice. 
Oh god. 

232 
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:28,674 
Do you? 

233 
00:22:30,197 --> 00:22:34,475 
I asked whether you believe it. 
Absolutely. 

234 
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:37,231 
Really? 
Yes. 

235 
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:43,787 
You believe that? 
Yes. 

236 
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:49,907 
Jamie ... I have no idea 
what you discuss. 

237 
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:57,229 
Did you, as you said, 
that you really believe me? 

238 
00:22:57,397 --> 00:22:59,388 
Yes. 

239 
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:06,346 
It says you enough for all the girls. 
Yes, I do. 

240 
00:23:07,557 --> 00:23:10,151 
Should I lie? 

241 
00:23:10,317 --> 00:23:14,356 
I say this to others, 
but with you, I think so. 

242 
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:20,547 
How should 
I could know the difference? 

243 
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:26,107 
I respect you enough 
to pack it away. 

244 
00:23:26,277 --> 00:23:29,633 
Respect is the opposite 
to think of any. 

245 
00:23:29,797 --> 00:23:35,110 
Not always. 
This does not, as I thought. 

246 
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:39,989 
Listen here. 

247 
00:23:40,157 --> 00:23:45,914 
I say simply that I think about you. 
If we have sex tonight, that is fine. 

248 
00:23:46,077 --> 00:23:50,195 
But if you do not trust enough for me, 
it is quite understandable. 

249 
00:23:50,357 --> 00:23:54,509 
And if that means that we must 
make the big things on hold, 

250 
00:23:54,677 --> 00:24:00,946 
and go back to talk, 
I can talk all night. 

251 
00:24:01,117 --> 00:24:06,032 
I want to know everything, 
there is to know about you. 

252 
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:10,392 
For example, what is it? 

253 
00:24:10,557 --> 00:24:13,549 
It is to rub cuticle. 

254 
00:24:13,717 --> 00:24:16,311 
How does it work? 

255 
00:24:16,477 --> 00:24:19,514 
Ken. 

256 
00:24:19,677 --> 00:24:23,556 
We do not need to talk. 
I believe you. 

257 
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:27,073 
Do you? 

258 
00:24:27,237 --> 00:24:31,435 
Does that mean that you do not 
like you about my conversation? 

259 
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:36,910 
I love the way you talk to. 
We can talk afterwards. 

260 
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:40,146 
Okay. 

261 
00:24:51,437 --> 00:24:55,350 
Thinking about others when we love? 
What? 

262 
00:24:55,517 --> 00:24:59,305 
Sometimes I feel 
that you are somewhere else. 

263 
00:24:59,477 --> 00:25:03,026 
Can you see what I do? 
How could I be? 

264 
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:06,951 
Sorry. You are right. 
Continue. 

265 
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:10,590 
Thank you. 

266 
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:17,267 
Is it because I is not smooth? 
Is it there for you not? 

267 
00:25:17,437 --> 00:25:21,112 
Who says that I am not? 
I do my best. 

268 
00:25:21,277 --> 00:25:25,429 
I stopped using wax, 
because you stopped to slikke me. 

269 
00:25:25,597 --> 00:25:31,274 
Do you want to talk about foot sex, 
or should I just do it? 

270 
00:25:31,437 --> 00:25:34,827 
Okay. Sorry. 

271 
00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:45,715 
You never look at me, 
when I'm down here. 

272 
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,550 
All four times? 

273 
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:52,426 
Thinking about others? 
No. 

274 
00:25:52,597 --> 00:25:56,067 
You may well say it. 
I do. 

275 
00:25:56,237 --> 00:26:01,186 
What? Why you say that? 
Only sometimes. To do this, too. 

276 
00:26:03,877 --> 00:26:06,869 
Yes, I do. 
Sometimes. 

277 
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:14,594 
Who? 
Who? Who's on your mind? 

278 
00:26:14,757 --> 00:26:18,955 
There are too many to list. 
Is not it the same every time? 

279 
00:26:19,117 --> 00:26:22,393 
There is a sea of people, 
I will never have sex with. 

280 
00:26:22,557 --> 00:26:25,867 
Thinking about the same every time? 

281 
00:26:26,037 --> 00:26:29,552 
Is it Malcolm? 
Is it because you think he is a doctor? 

282 
00:26:29,717 --> 00:26:34,666 
It is not Malcolm. 
Who is it? 

283 
00:26:34,837 --> 00:26:39,991 
Ian Ziering. He played Steve 
Sanders in "BeverlyHills" ... 

284 
00:26:40,157 --> 00:26:43,229 
I know who he was. 

285 
00:26:44,317 --> 00:26:48,151 
Are you sur? 

286 
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:52,071 
Let us continue. 
Okay. 

287 
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:55,035 
Let's just do it. 
I'm ready. 

288 
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:59,110 
Let us do it. 
Yes! 

289 
00:26:59,277 --> 00:27:04,749 
Where should we start? 
Would you like to start with a kiss? 

290 
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,475 
Stop! 

291 
00:27:23,637 --> 00:27:26,356 
You must not. 
What? 

292 
00:27:26,517 --> 00:27:30,066 
Do not look at me while. 
I can not cope. 

293 
00:27:30,237 --> 00:27:33,070 
You said that you thought about ... 

294 
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:38,265 
The other is: "A sexy girl look 
on me when she was sucking on. " 

295 
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:43,795 
With you is: "It is kris, 
and she has my cock in the mouth! " 

296 
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:46,869 
We drop blowjobbet. 

297 
00:27:48,397 --> 00:27:50,706 
Take the now calm. 

298 
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,914 
Let us put some music on. 

299 
00:27:54,077 --> 00:27:56,910 
Some of the bass. Something high. 

300 
00:27:57,077 --> 00:28:00,831 
Can I just ... 
We must have something kneppe music! 

301 
00:28:00,997 --> 00:28:03,306 
Fine enough. 

302 
00:28:04,477 --> 00:28:07,708 
We can skip over. 

303 
00:28:07,877 --> 00:28:11,506 
You are so homo. 
It is you who are homo. 

304 
00:28:14,677 --> 00:28:18,352 
It is better. We can ... 

305 
00:28:18,517 --> 00:28:23,227 
I hate the song. 
It was my and Dimitris song. 

306 
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:26,116 
Jessica and I had no song. 

307 
00:28:26,277 --> 00:28:31,635 
I thought about it, but then began 
idioten to play it everywhere. 

308 
00:28:31,797 --> 00:28:35,551 
  and each time I should 
be soft in the knees! 

309 
00:28:35,717 --> 00:28:38,675 
Can you see how excited you are? 

310 
00:28:38,837 --> 00:28:44,787 
You can pretend that I am him, 
and then you can give me a hiding. 

311 
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:49,508 
  Rend me! 
Sorry. It was stupid. 

312 
00:28:51,557 --> 00:28:55,914 
Do you want to talk about it? 
There we have it. 

313 
00:29:09,477 --> 00:29:12,753 
Is it fair that I am here? 
Yes. 

314 
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:18,867 
I just want to have it resolved. 
It's okay, right? 

315 
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:25,634 
I will not feel 
as a prick tomorrow. 

316 
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:30,075 
It is quite okay, that you are here. 

317 
00:29:40,477 --> 00:29:43,594 
You've come over me? 

318 
00:29:43,757 --> 00:29:47,227 
Hold on. do not it. 
You've come over me, no? 

319 
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:53,074 
Yes, Mia. 
It is just for fun, no? 

320 
00:29:53,277 --> 00:29:56,235 
Jo. Agree. 

321 
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:58,991 
So it is in order? 
Yes. Definitely. 

322 
00:30:02,037 --> 00:30:04,710 
Such. Hello, ladies. 

323 
00:30:04,877 --> 00:30:10,429 
Figures are not to my breasts. 
I am just polite. 

324 
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:19,069 
You would say that if you are still ... 
If it was not in order? 

325 
00:30:19,237 --> 00:30:24,311 
Maybe you should just 
stop talking. 

326 
00:30:31,357 --> 00:30:35,066 
So you did not 
that this would happen? 

327 
00:30:35,237 --> 00:30:39,753 
You have not tangaer, 
because this is pleasant. 

328 
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,829 
Just flå it. 
Just run! 

329 
00:31:26,997 --> 00:31:29,591 
Just flå it. 
What? 

330 
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:32,749 
Just flå it. 
Just do it. 

331 
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:34,908 
It is already on. 

332 
00:31:35,077 --> 00:31:38,547 
Yes, now. But before ... 

333 
00:31:38,717 --> 00:31:44,394 
It gave the sense, as I said it. 

334 
00:31:51,197 --> 00:31:55,031 
She like, 
that you take hold of her hair. 

335 
00:31:55,197 --> 00:31:58,712 
She like, 
that you take hold of her hair. 

336 
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:06,152 
You must not hold you back. 
Just the fleet and head on. 

337 
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:09,036 
But it goes well. 

338 
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:20,953 
I give you something. So when I 
says something, you should do it. 

339 
00:32:21,117 --> 00:32:24,905 
I am here also. 
It is also for my sake. 

340 
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:28,467 
It is not as 
to kneppe front of the dog. 

341 
00:32:28,637 --> 00:32:32,516 
I would not be an idiot. 

342 
00:32:32,677 --> 00:32:37,671 
I would like to see it go smoothly, 
and that it is sexy and delicious. 

343 
00:32:37,837 --> 00:32:42,706 
So I sit here. 

344 
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:47,632 
So I must address here? 

345 
00:32:48,997 --> 00:32:51,591 
It is great. 

346 
00:32:51,757 --> 00:32:55,955 
Just relax and do, 
what are you naturally. 

347 
00:32:56,117 --> 00:33:00,474 
How? 
Yes. 

348 
00:33:02,437 --> 00:33:05,668 
Such. 
Who is it? 

349 
00:33:05,837 --> 00:33:08,271 
Who is your new friend? 

350 
00:33:12,277 --> 00:33:15,633 
What happened? 
I put hårspray on there. 

351 
00:33:15,797 --> 00:33:19,426 
Parfumeflasken was empty. 
You must apologize. 

352 
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:24,591 
Okay! No more endearment. 
It is no one like. 

353 
00:33:24,757 --> 00:33:27,988 
I think about it. 
It makes no with the right to vote. 

354 
00:33:28,157 --> 00:33:32,116 
We kærtegner not even, 
so it should not do. 

355 
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:36,748 
So just go on and turn you loose. 

356 
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:41,547 
Treat her as a piece of meat. 
It's just fun sex. 

357 
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:46,074 
It is the exploration and fun. 
It is a erotiskforlystelse. 

358 
00:33:46,237 --> 00:33:49,866 
It is okay. 
Take me. 

359 
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:52,676 
Why do you see me? 
Take her. 

360 
00:33:52,837 --> 00:33:57,672 
I love you, Gord. 
It is so sexy. 

361 
00:33:57,837 --> 00:34:05,107 
Oh god. Continue. 
How, indeed. It is delicious. 

362 
00:34:06,437 --> 00:34:10,430 
III. SEX 

363 
00:34:12,957 --> 00:34:15,755 
Can I tell you something? 

364 
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:21,389 
I love your bedding. 
It is good, yes. 

365 
00:34:21,557 --> 00:34:24,390 
I do not use something. 
I know. 

366 
00:34:24,557 --> 00:34:28,516 
Do you have anything? 
I am at something. 

367 
00:34:28,677 --> 00:34:34,070 
I am healthy. I often checked. 
Otherwise, the girls had warned me. 

368 
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:39,265 
I drag me out. 
Just themselves. 

369 
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:45,467 
I promise that. And I promise not 
to destroy it totally cool bedding. 

370 
00:34:47,637 --> 00:34:51,027 
And you know what? 

371 
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:54,189 
You are beautiful. 

372 
00:34:54,357 --> 00:34:57,588 
I believe it. 

373 
00:34:57,757 --> 00:35:01,909 
Your eyes are as nøddebrune lakes. 

374 
00:35:03,357 --> 00:35:06,588 
Excuse me, I ... 

375 
00:35:06,757 --> 00:35:09,590 
I do not usually go to ... 

376 
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:15,106 
But you are beautiful shit. 

377 
00:35:15,277 --> 00:35:17,427 
Thank you. 

378 
00:35:19,437 --> 00:35:23,112 
Thank you. 
I know the look. 

379 
00:35:23,277 --> 00:35:28,146 
The look I give the girls who say, 
that they have never done it before. 

380 
00:35:28,317 --> 00:35:30,626 
I have destroyed it, right? 

381 
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:47,707 
Kris ... 

382 
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:52,030 
Oh, Kristine. 

383 
00:35:57,357 --> 00:36:02,954 
Kristine Armstrong! 
I need a little brash talk. 

384 
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:06,587 
The turn me on. 
Okay. 

385 
00:36:06,757 --> 00:36:11,467 
Just tell it with conviction. 
Come on. 

386 
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:16,836 
I knepper you so deeply in the ass, 
that your breath will smell of cock. 

387 
00:36:16,997 --> 00:36:22,674 
And then I come so hard in your mouth, 
the syringes out of your ass! 

388 
00:36:24,157 --> 00:36:27,035 
I am ... 
Gudfader. 

389 
00:36:27,197 --> 00:36:29,188 
Was it not what you wanted? 

390 
00:36:29,357 --> 00:36:33,066 
Why? 
Because you are a dirty whore. 

391 
00:36:33,917 --> 00:36:37,751 
Sorry. 
It is okay. It was my fault. 

392 
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:41,705 
Just go. 

393 
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:47,315 
Do you like it? 

394 
00:36:52,237 --> 00:36:57,152 
We should have sex, not talk about it. 
Perhaps it is not our fault. 

395 
00:36:57,317 --> 00:37:01,629 
Lysten will be less with age. 
We are 26! 

396 
00:37:01,797 --> 00:37:05,187 
It is not 19. 
You onanerer, when we do not have sex. 

397 
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:08,076 
Not every day. 

398 
00:37:08,237 --> 00:37:12,276 
Yes, but to have sex 
is quite different from that onanere. 

399 
00:37:12,437 --> 00:37:16,635 
It is like a energibar 
in relation to a meal. 

400 
00:37:16,797 --> 00:37:20,506 
And you eat energibarer. 
I have seen. 

401 
00:37:20,677 --> 00:37:24,636 
Yes. 
There you can see. 

402 
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:30,349 
Crap! Yes, we onanerer both, 
so why do we not? 

403 
00:37:30,517 --> 00:37:34,305 
Why do we not have more sex? 

404 
00:37:37,197 --> 00:37:40,269 
I think we both know that ... 

405 
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:44,908 
I am not so interesting in bed. 

406 
00:37:46,037 --> 00:37:52,112 
I can not excite you. 
And what is the purpose? 

407 
00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:58,034 
What? 
I have never been a sexdyr. 

408 
00:37:58,197 --> 00:38:00,916 
I can two posts. 

409 
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:05,628 
If you were not good, why should 
I would be with you? 

410 
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:10,188 
Because you are afraid to be alone. 

411 
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:12,552 
What? 

412 
00:38:13,717 --> 00:38:18,666 
Do you think that the only reason for 
I am with you, is ... 

413 
00:38:18,837 --> 00:38:22,113 
Oh god. 

414 
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:27,556 
Do you think I only with you, 
because I am afraid to be alone? 

415 
00:38:27,717 --> 00:38:32,074 
Is not it a little? 
Ask you? 

416 
00:38:32,237 --> 00:38:38,710 
If you think the only reason for 
that we are together ... 

417 
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:45,190 
I thought it was because I did not 
look so good as when we met. 

418 
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:48,155 
No, honey! 

419 
00:38:48,317 --> 00:38:52,674 
I think, in fact, you seem better. 
Do you? 

420 
00:38:52,837 --> 00:38:55,397 
Yes. 
Really? 

421 
00:38:56,517 --> 00:39:00,749 
You have taken on, and ... 

422 
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:06,028 
No, tax. 
I think it is positive. 

423 
00:39:06,197 --> 00:39:10,315 
You've got to fill. 
You does not look like a young girl more. 

424 
00:39:12,557 --> 00:39:17,677 
I thought ... I do not know what I 
must say. What should I say? 

425 
00:39:17,837 --> 00:39:23,195 
I want it to work. 
I will also. 

426 
00:39:26,757 --> 00:39:30,193 
Perhaps bored, we just 
after so long. 

427 
00:39:30,357 --> 00:39:32,632 
I think not. 
Admit it. 

428 
00:39:32,797 --> 00:39:38,667 
Yes, perhaps. 
Should we try something different? 

429 
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:41,305 
Okay. 

430 
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,186 
As what? 

431 
00:39:45,357 --> 00:39:50,556 
Something exciting? 
Okay. 

432 
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:54,266 
Do you as to make it 
in the bathtub? 

433 
00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:58,749 
I have a perfect idea. 

434 
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:06,909 
You have to do anything. 

435 
00:40:07,077 --> 00:40:09,637 
Everything you want. 

436 
00:40:09,797 --> 00:40:11,992 
Do you speak to me? 
Yes. 

437 
00:40:12,157 --> 00:40:14,625 
You can take her in the ass. 

438 
00:40:14,797 --> 00:40:20,030 
Had I forgotten me? Pause. 
I did not ass. 

439 
00:40:20,197 --> 00:40:26,147 
I would not stop. I thought 
I was close. I am. Continue. 

440 
00:40:26,317 --> 00:40:29,229 
Come on. 

441 
00:40:29,397 --> 00:40:31,672 
I did not in the ass. 

442 
00:40:31,837 --> 00:40:34,715 
Your hand ... 
It is on me. 

443 
00:40:34,877 --> 00:40:40,031 
I would just feel the rhythm. 
It was, therefore, I sneg me here. 

444 
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:43,872 
Such. 
No. 

445 
00:40:44,037 --> 00:40:48,235 
Gider you sit yonder? 
Yes, of course. 

446 
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:52,709 
Are you so in the ass? 
He has done everything else with you. 

447 
00:40:52,877 --> 00:40:58,986 
What does it mean when you say: 
"You have to do anything"? 

448 
00:41:01,557 --> 00:41:05,550 
I do not know. This means 
not ass. I do not. 

449 
00:41:05,717 --> 00:41:11,269 
We two make it after all. 
This is different. It is ...

450 
00:41:11,437 --> 00:41:16,431 
I think she believes 
that you are too great. 

451 
00:41:16,597 --> 00:41:19,157 
Is that what you meant? 

452 
00:41:31,077 --> 00:41:33,989 
A little slower. 

453 
00:41:34,157 --> 00:41:37,786 
If you want to control the pace, 
you must be at the top. 

454 
00:41:37,957 --> 00:41:42,747 
When did you last toned stomach? 
Slower. I believe it. 

455 
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:47,627 
Is it too much for you, Nancy? 
Call me not pigenavne. 

456 
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,869 
Suzie. Debbie. 
Keep up. 

457 
00:41:51,037 --> 00:41:54,473 
Team looked up! 

458 
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:02,952 
I was just about to come. 

459 
00:42:03,117 --> 00:42:07,474 
But you were not here yet. 
It is okay. 

460 
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:12,108 
No. Excuse me, 
I had to stop. 

461 
00:42:12,277 --> 00:42:14,916 
I knew what I did. 

462 
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:19,195 
I would have 
your first blob over. 

463 
00:42:19,357 --> 00:42:22,906 
Just relax. 

464 
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,991 
We? you have something to drink? 

465 
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:35,229 
It sounds good. Thank you. 

466 
00:42:37,877 --> 00:42:41,756 
What is wrong with you? 
Do you speak to me? 

467 
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:44,192 
No. 

468 
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,871 
Værsgo. 
Thank you. 

469 
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:37,150 
Calls to you that "the first blob"? 
You are better after the first. 

470 
00:43:37,317 --> 00:43:41,549 
So you must not hold back. 
You are more present. 

471 
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:45,266 
Dut rudder that you know everything about me. 

472 
00:43:45,437 --> 00:43:49,476 
You talked to your penis before, no? 

473 
00:43:49,637 --> 00:43:51,946 
Yes, I did. 

474 
00:43:53,237 --> 00:43:55,432 
IV. MELLEMSPIL 

475 
00:43:55,597 --> 00:44:01,194 
Can we keep a small break? 
Ja da. 

476 
00:44:01,357 --> 00:44:04,508 
I will still fall a little down. 

477 
00:44:04,677 --> 00:44:07,316 
Okay. 

478 
00:44:14,957 --> 00:44:17,027 
So ... 

479 
00:44:21,997 --> 00:44:24,386 
Why me? 

480 
00:44:24,557 --> 00:44:29,995 
We shall shortly move. 
And Inez know you. It is important. 

481 
00:44:30,157 --> 00:44:36,027 
She should really have a time prick, 
and you are well equipped. 

482 
00:44:36,197 --> 00:44:39,985 
We have lived together a long time, 
and I do not like about you more. 

483 
00:44:40,157 --> 00:44:43,308 
We were friends, but no longer. 

484 
00:44:43,477 --> 00:44:49,473 
When we do not live together, I will not 
hate you more. You understand ... 

485 
00:44:49,637 --> 00:44:56,588 
It is easier for me to see her 
do it with a ... 

486 
00:44:56,757 --> 00:45:00,432 
... I do not like. 

487 
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:04,954 
And Gord think that you are nice. 
Netop. 

488 
00:45:10,317 --> 00:45:14,515 
That here we had no problems 
with. We were good at. 

489 
00:45:14,677 --> 00:45:18,590 
But everything else on the other hand ... 

490 
00:45:20,557 --> 00:45:23,947 
What do you mean by that? 
You know you well. 

491 
00:45:24,117 --> 00:45:27,553 
Yes, but ... 
But what? 

492 
00:45:29,877 --> 00:45:34,189 
When we did not love, 
we had problems. 

493 
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,906 
That does not mean 
I do not need it. 

494 
00:45:38,077 --> 00:45:42,150 
Okay, but you 
blame me for it? 

495 
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:49,396 
Do you think that it was my fault? 
This is not about you. 

496 
00:45:49,557 --> 00:45:54,950 
Tell me not what I think. 
So you think it was my fault? 

497 
00:45:55,117 --> 00:45:58,473 
I know what you're thinking, 
because you are so easy to read. 

498 
00:45:58,637 --> 00:46:02,073 
Keep up now. 
I believe it. 

499 
00:46:10,237 --> 00:46:16,836 
Are you still with her ... 
No, I am not. 

500 
00:46:16,997 --> 00:46:22,310 
No. I am not so good 
to the standard conditions the past. 

501 
00:46:22,477 --> 00:46:29,315 
I have it all for fun. 
I would not be here if ... 

502 
00:46:29,477 --> 00:46:33,265 
Are you with someone? 
No. 

503 
00:46:33,437 --> 00:46:39,148 
As with his guy at work? 
What of them? 

504 
00:46:39,317 --> 00:46:43,469 
"What of them?" 
There were two. 

505 
00:46:43,637 --> 00:46:47,232 
The only thing you said to me, 
was Tristan. 

506 
00:46:47,397 --> 00:46:51,754 
Very macho. Did he 
tailor-made T-Shirts? 

507 
00:46:51,917 --> 00:46:56,115 
No. Keep up now. 
What is the second sop? 

508 
00:46:56,277 --> 00:47:01,476 
It does not matter. 
Is he one of my friends? 

509 
00:47:01,637 --> 00:47:04,071 
No. 
So, what he says. 

510 
00:47:04,237 --> 00:47:06,671 
No. 
No? 

511 
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:10,034 
Sig, hvad han hedder. 

512 
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:13,746 
Saliva. 
Is what he says. 

513 
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:16,477 
However, F. Mac. 

514 
00:47:16,637 --> 00:47:19,709 
You must not say anything. 
F. However, Mac? 

515 
00:47:19,877 --> 00:47:23,108 
It is his rap name 
or his street name. 

516 
00:47:23,277 --> 00:47:27,395 
Or prison name! 
What the hell is this? 

517 
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:29,707 
See how jealous you are. 

518 
00:47:29,877 --> 00:47:34,348 
No. I try to find out, 
what the "F" stands for. 

519 
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:38,749 
Why are you so jealous? 
I am not jealous. 

520 
00:47:38,917 --> 00:47:42,068 
I am not jealous. 

521 
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:45,229 
I just want to ... 

522 
00:47:45,397 --> 00:47:52,075 
I just want to ensure me, 
that you are being treated ... 

523 
00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:55,274 
I want you to be happy. 

524 
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:58,429 
I am. 

525 
00:47:59,557 --> 00:48:02,947 
Well. Well done. 

526 
00:48:05,277 --> 00:48:10,226 
And you? 
I am very happy. 

527 
00:48:11,477 --> 00:48:14,787 
Very happy. 

528 
00:48:20,037 --> 00:48:24,986 
Excuse me, I stopped. 
The urgency is not. It is in order. 

529 
00:48:25,157 --> 00:48:29,309 
You have been in bed with all 
the girls at work. Is it here? 

530 
00:48:29,477 --> 00:48:33,868 
I have not been in bed with everyone. 
For example, not Mariah. 

531 
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:40,590 
She began before you. And Christina 
was beautiful. I never touched her. 

532 
00:48:40,757 --> 00:48:43,749 
Shakira ... 

533 
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:49,787 
I lied. I read your CD. Covers. 
Yes, I have been in bed with everyone. 

534 
00:48:49,957 --> 00:48:56,146 
I thought just not, 
that there would be so much intimacy. 

535 
00:48:56,317 --> 00:48:59,468 
It is not, 
because I do not think about you. 

536 
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:04,836 
I said it too early. Maybe 
one should not say it in bed. 

537 
00:49:04,997 --> 00:49:08,034 
I do not know what I do. 

538 
00:49:08,197 --> 00:49:11,394 
As usual you say? 

539 
00:49:11,557 --> 00:49:17,314 
"You have a great ass." 
To help the self-esteem. 

540 
00:49:17,477 --> 00:49:21,948 
And what do you think of my ass? 
It is great. 

541 
00:49:22,117 --> 00:49:24,392 
I believe it. 
I do so also. 

542 
00:49:24,557 --> 00:49:30,473 
And believe me, for I am ass. Man. 
It is a masterpiece. 

543 
00:49:31,557 --> 00:49:36,392 
I am with you in again 
on one condition. 

544 
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:41,153 
Drop sødsuppe. Talk, 
for it is just not my style. 

545 
00:49:41,317 --> 00:49:43,672 
Is it an agreement? 

546 
00:49:45,717 --> 00:49:49,187 
Yes. 
Well. 

547 
00:50:03,357 --> 00:50:05,632 
I know what you're thinking. 

548 
00:50:11,797 --> 00:50:15,267 
No, I do not know what you're thinking. 
What you think? 

549 
00:50:15,437 --> 00:50:18,827 
In the first place: 
How did you get it from? 

550 
00:50:18,997 --> 00:50:24,993 
It was a premium for Michelle 
hen. I won it. 

551 
00:50:27,957 --> 00:50:31,233 
So you? 
I have it on. 

552 
00:50:31,397 --> 00:50:34,594 
And then? 
So I knepper you. 

553 
00:50:38,477 --> 00:50:41,150 
You like to get a finger up. 

554 
00:50:41,317 --> 00:50:44,787 
And you keep my hand there, 
when you are full enough. 

555 
00:50:44,957 --> 00:50:48,029 
It is a little larger than a finger. 

556 
00:50:48,197 --> 00:50:51,553 
We use as glidecreme. 
Really? 

557 
00:50:52,997 --> 00:50:58,754 
Will you not even try? 

558 
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:03,274 
It is ... 

559 
00:51:03,437 --> 00:51:09,387 
You have a g. Point, as we do not 
has found. Are not you curious? 

560 
00:51:09,557 --> 00:51:14,790 
What do I have? It knew I did not. 
How do you know? Where is it? 

561 
00:51:14,957 --> 00:51:18,188 
What do I have? 

562 
00:51:18,357 --> 00:51:22,430 
I am sorry that I brought that up as well. 

563 
00:51:22,597 --> 00:51:25,907 
I put it away. 
Relax and unwire. 

564 
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:32,833 
And then we can ... 
I do not know what to do. 

565 
00:51:40,077 --> 00:51:42,716 
What will you get out of it? 

566 
00:51:46,357 --> 00:51:51,670 
There is a small 
vibrating things in it for me. 

567 
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:57,108 
So you can get? 

568 
00:51:57,277 --> 00:51:59,711 
Oh yes. 

569 
00:52:10,117 --> 00:52:12,472 
Okay. 
Do you? 

570 
00:52:12,637 --> 00:52:15,435 
Yes, okay. 

571 
00:52:15,597 --> 00:52:18,634 
Okay. 

572 
00:52:18,797 --> 00:52:24,030 
I just ... 
lay you down. 

573 
00:52:24,197 --> 00:52:28,827 
Should we kiss a little first? 

574 
00:52:28,997 --> 00:52:32,273 
I do not think 
it will make me wetter. 

575 
00:52:32,437 --> 00:52:35,793 
I just ... 

576 
00:52:59,957 --> 00:53:02,994 
Do not worry, honey. 
It is just the tip. 

577 
00:53:03,157 --> 00:53:06,467 
It says they are all together. 

578 
00:53:07,797 --> 00:53:11,267 
Try to relax. 

579 
00:53:18,357 --> 00:53:20,917 
Taxes? 

580 
00:53:21,077 --> 00:53:24,149 
I am right here. 
I go nowhere. 

581 
00:53:24,317 --> 00:53:28,105 
Okay. It is okay. 

582 
00:53:34,797 --> 00:53:37,948 
Happy Birthday, darling. 

583 
00:53:48,117 --> 00:53:51,746 
New plan? 
Yes, just give me a moment. 

584 
00:53:51,917 --> 00:53:56,433 
Can I do anything? 
No, it is not about you. 

585 
00:53:56,597 --> 00:53:59,031 
What's on your mind? 

586 
00:53:59,197 --> 00:54:02,314 
I do not know. Patter. 

587 
00:54:05,677 --> 00:54:10,956 
Jessica called themselves athletes 
just because she jumped with horses. 

588 
00:54:11,117 --> 00:54:15,713 
What is it? 
Springridning. 

589 
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:21,235 
It is the horse, which is athlete. 
It makes all the work. 

590 
00:54:21,397 --> 00:54:26,027 
This is equivalent to 100 meters. runners 
Ol bar to a dwarf, 

591 
00:54:26,197 --> 00:54:29,553 
and then gave the dwarf medal. 

592 
00:54:29,717 --> 00:54:32,754 
Yes, it's fun. 

593 
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:38,469 
I do not think about her. 
Okay. 

594 
00:54:38,637 --> 00:54:41,629 
I believe it. 
Okay. 

595 
00:54:42,997 --> 00:54:47,946 
Should I? 
No. I fix it. 

596 
00:54:57,477 --> 00:55:01,755 
Maybe we should just stop there? 

597 
00:55:01,917 --> 00:55:06,991 
I undertake to blame for this. 
I thought it was a good idea. 

598 
00:55:07,157 --> 00:55:10,832 
Let us give each other hand 
and giving alcohol to blame. 

599 
00:55:10,997 --> 00:55:16,947 
Nope. You do not remember it as 
the evening, I could not get it up. 

600 
00:55:17,117 --> 00:55:21,349 
I'm just a little nervous. 
Everything makes you nervous. 

601 
00:55:21,517 --> 00:55:25,510 
Everything? Slikkede I do not 
20 minutes ago? 

602 
00:55:25,677 --> 00:55:28,714 
Only because you felt 
that you had to it. 

603 
00:55:28,877 --> 00:55:31,914 
You were sorry blowjob. The failure. 

604 
00:55:32,077 --> 00:55:36,707 
Listen here. 
None slikker of obligation. 

605 
00:55:36,877 --> 00:55:40,108 
I know how to think. 
I am not a møgluder, 

606 
00:55:40,277 --> 00:55:46,193 
as during six years 
do not bother teach you to know. 

607 
00:55:46,357 --> 00:55:50,145 
You played macho, because I always 
driller you that you are svans. 

608 
00:55:50,317 --> 00:55:54,515 
You stuck in my neck, 
because Dimitri always did. 

609 
00:55:54,677 --> 00:56:01,435 
We know everything about each other, and the 
Therefore, you can not get it up. 

610 
00:56:01,597 --> 00:56:04,634 
You did not know that I was 
smitten in you i4.klasse. 

611 
00:56:04,797 --> 00:56:08,472 
Yes, but I was 
together with Morris. 

612 
00:56:10,157 --> 00:56:13,354 
I was smitten in you in high school. 

613 
00:56:13,517 --> 00:56:17,874 
I knew it well, 
but I was with Jessica. 

614 
00:56:18,037 --> 00:56:20,870 
Did you know? 

615 
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:27,274 
Now, I am. 
This should never have happened. 

616 
00:56:27,437 --> 00:56:30,986 
I did not know that you knew it. 
Where are my pants? 

617 
00:56:31,157 --> 00:56:34,911 
I thought 
vi bare kunne gøre det, men... 

618 
00:56:35,077 --> 00:56:39,070 
Add as the pants from you, 
to hell! 

619 
00:56:39,237 --> 00:56:43,435 
An explosion is just an explosion. 
Did you might not it? 

620 
00:56:43,597 --> 00:56:47,226 
Did you or not? 
Should I answer it? 

621 
00:56:47,397 --> 00:56:51,436 
Let us do it. Afterwards, 
we have to be best friends again. 

622 
00:56:51,597 --> 00:56:57,354 
But right now is just a piece of meat. 
A delicious fisse with feet. 

623 
00:56:57,517 --> 00:57:00,748 
And I should just be 
a large cock with a face. 

624 
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,751 
Come to bed. 
It need not be so complicated. 

625 
00:57:04,917 --> 00:57:08,227 
It should not be so hard. 
Jo. 

626 
00:57:08,397 --> 00:57:11,707 
Not if we 
look at each other as meat. 

627 
00:57:11,877 --> 00:57:14,710 
I think it is tough. 

628 
00:57:19,877 --> 00:57:22,994 
Do you know what's going on here? 

629 
00:57:23,157 --> 00:57:28,390 
He points to you. He will 
have you back in bed. 

630 
00:57:28,557 --> 00:57:32,072 
If he could do so, 
he would do it. 

631 
00:57:32,237 --> 00:57:36,071 
Come to bed. 
We must kneppe. And that is all. 

632 
00:57:36,237 --> 00:57:40,276 
I will not fall for a prick? 
My engagement to be emptied. 

633 
00:57:40,437 --> 00:57:46,194 
We think only of ourselves? 
A sexy ass with eyes and ... 

634 
00:57:46,357 --> 00:57:49,986 
Are you ready? 

635 
00:58:00,917 --> 00:58:04,671 
V. ORGASME 

636 
00:58:09,157 --> 00:58:14,709 
How is it, honey? 
Fine. What about you? 

637 
00:58:14,877 --> 00:58:19,507 
Well. The vibrator is great. 

638 
00:58:19,677 --> 00:58:23,192 
Can I get longer? 
So ... 

639 
00:58:23,357 --> 00:58:27,396 
Let me find your g. point. 
My what? 

640 
00:58:31,877 --> 00:58:37,031 
How is it, honey? 
Not bad! 

641 
00:58:50,997 --> 00:58:54,273 
Hold on. Stop! 

642 
00:58:54,437 --> 00:58:57,509 
I come! 

643 
00:59:21,397 --> 00:59:25,276 
Why are you so slow? 

644 
00:59:28,277 --> 00:59:31,428 
I do not know. 

645 
00:59:37,997 --> 00:59:41,467 
Should I do it faster? 

646 
00:59:56,797 --> 01:00:01,712 
Maybe chess, we do it faster? 

647 
01:00:48,197 --> 01:00:50,757 
Good work. 
In the same way. 

648 
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:55,195 
Yes, there ... 
Do you like it, your møgluder? 

649 
01:00:58,397 --> 01:01:03,266 
I come soon. 
I do so also. 

650 
01:01:24,317 --> 01:01:27,275 
You are wonderful. 

651 
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:44,314 
It is better than I thought. 
It is so good. 

652 
01:01:44,477 --> 01:01:48,948 
You are so beautiful. 
I love you. 

653 
01:02:02,357 --> 01:02:06,111 
Thank you. 
Thank you, thank you, thank you. 

654 
01:02:12,717 --> 01:02:15,550 
You were incredible. 
Was I? 

655 
01:02:15,717 --> 01:02:20,666 
I got you to come once. 
I came three times. 

656 
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:26,230 
Holy shit ... 
Any comments? 

657 
01:02:26,397 --> 01:02:30,595 
There was a støn, 
which was just excessive. 

658 
01:02:30,757 --> 01:02:33,988 
Jaså? 
You know what I mean. 

659 
01:02:34,157 --> 01:02:39,072 
It was as ... 
That you should probably tone down a little. 

660 
01:02:39,237 --> 01:02:44,709 
It seemed a little taken. 
I shall remember for next time. 

661 
01:02:44,877 --> 01:02:48,267 
Do you know what you can do for me? 
What? Well ... 

662 
01:02:48,437 --> 01:02:53,306 
No, I have to me. 
Come not near me. I'm hypersensitive. 

663 
01:02:53,477 --> 01:02:56,469 
But you know what I need? 

664 
01:02:56,637 --> 01:03:00,391 
A portion is. And a cookie. 

665 
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:04,186 
Put it in a bowl 
and warm it in the microwave. 

666 
01:03:04,357 --> 01:03:08,396 
Do you want ice? 
Where is it just sweet. 

667 
01:03:08,557 --> 01:03:13,347 
You may have to be washing a bowl. 
I have nothing against. 

668 
01:03:13,517 --> 01:03:17,351 
And come with it? 
With a cookie? 

669 
01:03:19,597 --> 01:03:23,306 
I am glad that we did it. 
Hvabehar? 

670 
01:03:23,477 --> 01:03:29,791 
Of course I am pleased that we 
had sex. I am just glad ... 

671 
01:03:29,957 --> 01:03:34,951 
I stop to talk, 
because we are obviously agree on this. 

672 
01:03:36,597 --> 01:03:42,274 
I hope not, you need 
a long pause, for I am ready again. 

673 
01:03:50,077 --> 01:03:52,113 
You forgot my cookie. 

674 
01:03:54,357 --> 01:03:57,588 
Lift her legs up. 
How? 

675 
01:03:57,757 --> 01:04:01,796 
High up. 
Yes! Oh god. 

676 
01:04:01,957 --> 01:04:06,553 
Now I come. 

677 
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:09,470 
We did it. 

678 
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:13,516 
See me. 

679 
01:04:23,637 --> 01:04:28,392 
It was fantastic. 
In so sexy. 

680 
01:04:30,797 --> 01:04:35,712 
I know that we have had our 
differences, but it was fat. 

681 
01:04:35,877 --> 01:04:38,596 
I was so cheeky. 

682 
01:04:56,437 --> 01:05:03,354 
I go outside for a moment. 
If in need me ... 

683 
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:38,956 
One sip juice? 
During me no more? 

684 
01:05:39,117 --> 01:05:44,111 
Should I now buy a new carton? 
Do you think I am stupid? 

685 
01:05:44,277 --> 01:05:48,350 
If you believe that you are smarter than me? 
Take no clothes! 

686 
01:05:48,517 --> 01:05:52,476 
VI. EFTERSPIL 

687 
01:05:54,077 --> 01:05:58,070 
I did not hear 
Microwave say Ding. 

688 
01:05:58,237 --> 01:06:03,186 
I am confused. 
Masserede you nails band? 

689 
01:06:03,357 --> 01:06:08,306 
You said that you came four times. 
Løj you? 

690 
01:06:08,477 --> 01:06:12,265 
No, I lied. I ... 

691 
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:16,390 
What? 

692 
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:20,311 
I can not. 

693 
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:27,633 
I try and try. It is, 
as if there is something wrong with me. 

694 
01:06:27,797 --> 01:06:32,791 
It should be like 
be fun and non-binding. 

695 
01:06:32,957 --> 01:06:35,027 
But it is not. 

696 
01:06:35,197 --> 01:06:40,191 
For me it is so overwhelming. 
So personally. 

697 
01:06:40,357 --> 01:06:45,112 
I think of how I look like 
and what he thinks about me, 

698 
01:06:45,277 --> 01:06:47,472 
and what with the smell? 

699 
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:52,665 
And then I just do not. 
I can not. 

700 
01:06:55,637 --> 01:07:01,826 
I am just not enough 
right sexually brought. 

701 
01:07:04,557 --> 01:07:07,310 
I'm sorry. 

702 
01:07:08,757 --> 01:07:11,271 
I am truly sorry. 

703 
01:07:11,437 --> 01:07:15,225 
It should probably go. 

704 
01:07:19,237 --> 01:07:23,867 
So when you say that you do not 
is quite sexually brought ... 

705 
01:07:25,997 --> 01:07:28,830 
It was a lie. 
A brittle lie. 

706 
01:07:28,997 --> 01:07:32,512 
Not sexually brought? 
You lied sgu! 

707 
01:07:32,677 --> 01:07:36,306 
Take not the case on the road, 
because you could not give me orgasm. 

708 
01:07:36,477 --> 01:07:41,915 
There are plenty of girls, 
I can not give orgasm. Lots! 

709 
01:07:42,077 --> 01:07:46,548 
I left you, Jamie. 
My name is Dora. 

710 
01:07:46,717 --> 01:07:53,031 
Dora is not a sexy name, so when I 
moved, I decided Jamie. 

711 
01:07:53,197 --> 01:07:55,665 
Skiftede you name to Jamie Fox? 

712 
01:07:55,837 --> 01:08:01,070 
It is a sexy name. How could 
I know that I would win the Oscars? 

713 
01:08:01,237 --> 01:08:04,309 
You are sgu insane. 

714 
01:08:04,477 --> 01:08:08,868 
Yes, it is crazy to tell a lie 
to go to bed with someone? 

715 
01:08:09,037 --> 01:08:15,272 
I know you think of the innocent girls. 
So I played innocent. 

716 
01:08:15,437 --> 01:08:17,746 
I would kneppes. 

717 
01:08:17,917 --> 01:08:23,116 
I anede not that you would 
be soft and "love" with me? 

718 
01:08:23,277 --> 01:08:25,871 
How should I get? 

719 
01:08:26,037 --> 01:08:30,588 
You are not the man 
I have heard of. You are a hypocrite. 

720 
01:08:30,757 --> 01:08:35,911 
You exaggerate your accent 
and sticking peck in total with a toe ring. 

721 
01:08:36,077 --> 01:08:41,754 
Then you here 
and fired a lot of sødsuppe, 

722 
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:44,875 
and then call me a liar? 

723 
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:50,828 
Everything you have said tonight, 
meant that you had sex. 

724 
01:09:01,717 --> 01:09:04,026 
Hello. 
Was it good? 

725 
01:09:04,197 --> 01:09:06,870 
No. 
Was it bad? 

726 
01:09:07,037 --> 01:09:11,747 
I try sgu, 
but it's just all the lies. 

727 
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:15,512 
Never again. 
I swear, never again. 

728 
01:09:15,677 --> 01:09:18,908 
But was it worth it? 

729 
01:09:29,797 --> 01:09:34,917 
Do not you hear me? 
It was fantastic. 

730 
01:09:35,077 --> 01:09:37,955 
I said, wait. 
I said stop. 

731 
01:09:39,077 --> 01:09:42,308 
I said no. 

732 
01:09:45,717 --> 01:09:48,390 
Look at you. 

733 
01:09:48,557 --> 01:09:54,792 
Sorry. But I was so close. 
And it seemed as if you enjoyed it. 

734 
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:58,029 
This is not what this is about. 
. Not that? 

735 
01:09:58,197 --> 01:10:01,553 
If a girl says stop, 
so stop Monday. 

736 
01:10:01,717 --> 01:10:06,745 
We should come closer to each other, 
do something exciting together. 

737 
01:10:06,917 --> 01:10:11,115 
But you are in your own world. 
You do not listen to me. 

738 
01:10:11,277 --> 01:10:16,590 
In the mind røvpulede you Ian Ziering. 
Andrew ... Nut you? 

739 
01:10:18,077 --> 01:10:23,197 
Det er ikke det, det handler om. 
You were given as a bold orgasm. 

740 
01:10:23,357 --> 01:10:28,033 
How do you know? You wonder ... 
He had curly hockeyhår! 

741 
01:10:28,197 --> 01:10:32,110 
I know it, 
because I could feel it. 

742 
01:10:32,277 --> 01:10:34,586 
Could you? 

743 
01:10:34,757 --> 01:10:39,228 
When I was up in you, 
I could feel it when you came. 

744 
01:10:39,397 --> 01:10:44,027 
And also you have the 
semen overall. 

745 
01:10:55,357 --> 01:11:01,273 
It was not bad. And it was 
good to see you so excited. 

746 
01:11:01,437 --> 01:11:03,997 
It is long overdue. 

747 
01:11:04,157 --> 01:11:07,945 
And you made of the 
some new sounds. 

748 
01:11:11,077 --> 01:11:13,910 
Tax ... 

749 
01:11:14,077 --> 01:11:16,671 
I am not bored. 

750 
01:11:16,837 --> 01:11:20,273 
Is it a question? 
No. I say it. 

751 
01:11:22,277 --> 01:11:24,745 
I am not bored either. 

752 
01:11:35,277 --> 01:11:39,156 
It slipped my mind. Can we? 
Yes. Sorry. 

753 
01:11:59,797 --> 01:12:01,992 
But then ... 

754 
01:12:07,397 --> 01:12:09,706 
I thought that was what you would. 

755 
01:12:09,877 --> 01:12:14,632 
I did also. I do. 
You so fantastic, tax. 

756 
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:17,709 
I love you so much. 
I know this well. 

757 
01:12:17,877 --> 01:12:20,630 
I know this well. 

758 
01:12:20,797 --> 01:12:25,029 
Do you really? 
She did it for you. 

759 
01:12:25,197 --> 01:12:29,236 
No. She was just as much 
with at it as me. 

760 
01:12:29,397 --> 01:12:35,029 
She would just as much as me. 
I would just make you happy. 

761 
01:12:35,197 --> 01:12:38,314 
I would just make you happy. 
To do this. 

762 
01:12:38,477 --> 01:12:43,631 
No, see me. I deserve 
not a nice girl like you. 

763 
01:12:43,797 --> 01:12:47,915 
Everyone looks at us and think: 
"What does she do with that guy?" 

764 
01:12:48,077 --> 01:12:50,193

really deserve, so you were happy. 

766

which looks at such us ... 

767 
01:13:01,397 --> 01:13:04,389 
See for yourself, you notice it. 
I knew it. 

768 
01:13:04,557 --> 01:13:08,596 
Yes, I notice it, 
and I love it. 

769 
01:13:08,757 --> 01:13:12,033
