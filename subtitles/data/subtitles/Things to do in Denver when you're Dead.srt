Cinderella, dressed in yella,

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,826
went upstairs
to kiss her fella,

3
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:11,891
made a mistake
and kissed a snake.

4
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:15,665
How many doctors
did it take?

5
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:19,835
- One, two, three, four,
- Come on, pass the ball.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,903
five, six, seven, eight.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,948
Angie, go to your spot.

8
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:38,458
Higher!

9
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:43,191
Let's get the rhythm
of the stomp, stomp, stomp.

10
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:47,532
Cinderella, dressed in yella,

11
00:00:47,604 --> 00:00:50,971
went upstairs
to kiss her fella,

12
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:55,239
made a mistake
and kissed a snake.

13
00:00:55,312 --> 00:00:59,840
How many doctors
did it take?

14
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:03,181
One, two, three, four,

15
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:06,711
five... six...

16
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,556
seven... eight...

17
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:13,255
nine... ten...

18
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,060
11... 12...

19
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:19,226
13... 14... 15...

20
00:01:19,302 --> 00:01:22,760
16... 17.

21
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:28,436
- Okay, come on.
Cinderella, dressed in yella,

22
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:32,379
went upstairs to kiss her-

23
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:34,576
Hi.

24
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:36,949
What do you want,
doofus?

25
00:01:42,826 --> 00:01:45,056
Hey! Hey!

26
00:01:45,128 --> 00:01:47,688
Hey! Hey!
What're you doin'?

27
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:54,032
Loser! Loser! Loser!
Loser! Lo-

- No, in those days,

39
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:27,528
you wanted a piece of quim,
you knew where to go.

40
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:30,334
You left your wife at home.
You- You hit the spots.

41
00:02:30,407 --> 00:02:33,376
You'd run with a big noise guy-
you know, a cake eater.

42
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:36,742
Before you could say beef bayonet,
you got a bangtail on your arm...

43
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:39,509
sweet as Dutch cheese.

44
00:02:39,582 --> 00:02:41,948
Now you got your fuckin' AIDS.

45
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:44,486
You got your raised
feminist consciousness,

46
00:02:44,554 --> 00:02:46,488
whatever the fuck
that means.

47
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:50,356
Then you got your movements- a movement
for this, a movement for that.

48
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:53,021
You got too many movements,
ya ask me.

49
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:55,360
The only good movement's
a fuckin' bowel movement.

50
00:02:55,432 --> 00:02:59,095
Hey!

51
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:01,228
Look who's here!
Jimmy the Saint!

52
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:04,705
- Hit and run, Malt.
- All right.

53
00:03:04,774 --> 00:03:08,437
- What's the word, Jimmy?
- What's goin' on, Joe?

54
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:11,139
You heard about this thing,
that fuckin' Bernard?

55
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:15,310
- No, what happened?
- I knew the kid was lunchy, but not this fuckin' lunchy.

56
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:17,945
They picked him up at a schoolyard
fishin' for saplings.

57
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:21,684
- No shit.
- They oughta neuter that fuckin' kid.

58
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:24,056
It's a brain thing, Joe,
with Bernard, not a balls thing.

59
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:27,585
Aw, give it a name. Come on. Anything
you can say is a problem with a man.

60
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:29,632
It's a balls thing.

61
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:32,532
- Hey.
- Boat drinks.

62
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:34,832
Boat drinks.

63
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:37,372
Jimmy the Saint from Flatbush.

64
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,170
Went to seminary school
but lost the calling.

65
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:44,339
But in his day,
the bitch's bastard.

66
00:03:44,414 --> 00:03:47,315
o/ Turn the corner, fool
is what she said o/

67
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:50,182
o/ A hundred dollars
makes the talkin' said o/

68
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:53,450
o/ Edna Million
in a drop-dead suit o/

69
00:03:53,523 --> 00:03:56,048
o/ Dutch Pink
on a downtown train o/

70
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:59,357
o/ Two-dollar pistol
but the gun won't shoot o/

71
00:03:59,429 --> 00:04:01,488
o/ I'm in the corner
on the floor o/

72
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:04,032
Because after you've gone,

73
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,330
your money
goes to somebody else,

74
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:09,395
another man comes along
and marries your wife.

75
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:13,101
Your kids fall in love with strangers.

76
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:17,476
But if you've been good,
if you've been decent,

77
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:20,641
how you are remembered
cannot be sullied,

78
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:24,084
cannot be changed.

79
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:32,756
Very- Very nice,
Mr. Jergen.

80
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:34,763
Um, Barry, could you-

81
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:37,265
- Um, some water.
- Sure.

82
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,267
- We're doin' great.
- There you go.

83
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:42,065
Why don't we take a little break,
and we'll continue later?

84
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:44,072
All right.

85
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,405
- Two-six-eight-
- Easy. Easy, now.

86
00:04:47,477 --> 00:04:49,411
Good afternoon.

87
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:51,413
Julie, call and check
on that-

88
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:54,006
Here we have Mr. Jergen.
He's doing his taping.

89
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,551
Now, my associate Randall Cuffland,
who just went by,

90
00:04:56,619 --> 00:05:00,817
he follows a very carefully composed list
of questions which he poses to Mr. Jergen...

91
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,859
and which Mr. Jergen's loved ones
will be able to access once he's gone.

92
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:06,157
You understand?

93
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:09,130
I'd like to introduce you
to somebody.

94
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,224
Here, this way.

95
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:14,393
This is Stevie.

96
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:17,338
Stevie's father passed away,
pancreatic cancer,

97
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:20,774
at a time in late adolescence
when Stevie needed him the most.

98
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:24,143
So now Stevie needs advice from
his father, he comes back to see us.

99
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:26,580
- Understand? Let me show you.
- Right.

100
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:31,920
Hey, what's goin' on,
Stevie?

101
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:34,320
Hey, Jimmy. How are ya?

102
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:40,489
Uh, girls.
I don't know.

103
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:44,124
This is, uh-

104
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,465
Hey, if you chase
a dog, it runs.

105
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:52,338
Treat 'em like shit. That's what I did
to your mother, and she fell for me.

106
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:55,377
Two months later,
we were married.

107
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:58,710
You treat 'em like dirt
and they come running.

108
00:05:58,781 --> 00:06:00,715
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

109
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:02,774
Uh, your father suffers from-
What was it?

110
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:04,786
- Uh, diabetes.
- Ah, yes, diabetes.

111
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:07,948
- But his condition has taken a severe turn for the worst.
- Time is of the essence.

112
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:09,958
- Yes. Thanks.
- Thank you.

113
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:12,517
- Does he have any grandchildren yet?
- Uh, eight, all together.

114
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:15,621
Ah, I see. I'm sure they'll benefit
from a patriarch's advice-

115
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:18,166
maybe not now, maybe not tomorrow,
but someday soon.

116
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:20,532
- Good afternoon, Mr. Jergen.
- Yeah. Hi.

117
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:22,537
- Happy man.
- Thank you.

118
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:24,937
Take our brochure.

119
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:28,171
One for you. One for you. And please,
uh, give one to a friend.

120
00:06:28,244 --> 00:06:30,439
- Thank you.
- On your way out, there's a ledger there.

121
00:06:30,513 --> 00:06:32,913
- Please sign it. It's our mailing list.
- Thank you.

122
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:34,916
Thank you very much.

123
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:39,214
- Any luck?
- Nope.

124
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:43,225
He seemed into it, but she looked like
she was gonna launch lunch over Mr. Jergen.

125
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:45,227
- We'll get the next one, Jimmy.
- Right.

126
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:47,229
Uh-

127
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:50,027
- Happy hour at 6:00. I'll see you there.
- Okay.

128
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:05,812
o/ My baby's a superstar o/

129
00:07:05,882 --> 00:07:08,350
o/ She's in a class by herself o/

130
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:14,222
o/ I said my, my baby's
a superstar o/

131
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,656
o/ She's in a class by herself o/

132
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:21,122
o/ You don't think if love
mean anything else better o/

133
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:25,092
- o/ You got to have it Got to have it for himself o/
- Hey.

134
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:28,365
Just picked it up
for the newspaper ad.

135
00:07:28,438 --> 00:07:31,464
"Just because they're gone
doesn't mean they can't guide"?

136
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,305
- Who came up with that?
- I did.

137
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:36,311
- It's terrible.
- Why?

138
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:37,971
- It's clunky.
- Clunky?

139
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:40,208
- It's fucking clunky, Cuff.
- What's clunky?

140
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:43,775
- What do you know about clunky?
- I know about clunky, and that's fuckin' clunky.

141
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:48,813
I thought you people were supposed
to be good at this kind of shit.

142
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:52,918
- "You people"?
- Yes, you people. Homosexuals. You're not a homosexual now?

143
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:55,658
- "You people"?
- You people.

144
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:57,927
Every fag in the world
is good at this kind of shit,

145
00:07:58,001 --> 00:07:59,935
and I gotta wind up
with one that's clunky?

146
00:08:00,003 --> 00:08:05,168
Okay, Jimmy. Well, the video leasing
company called "you people" today,

147
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,732
and they said if they don't
have a check by the end of the week,

148
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,745
they're gonna come
and take all the equipment.

149
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:16,017
o/ Said that woman o/

150
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:19,111
o/ Man, she's such a dream
Ah o/

151
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:24,352
o/ I said that woman o/

152
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:26,952
o/ She's like something
you've never seen, ah o/

153
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,964
Jimmy.

154
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,759
So what do we do?

155
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:36,703
- Jimmy?
- I don't know, Cuff. Maybe we should let Julie go.

156
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:39,333
It's not like the phone actually rings
or anything.

157
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,209
Or maybe we could dip
into your boat fund.

158
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,215
I mean, you're never really gonna
buy a boat. We live in Denver, Jimmy.

159
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:49,877
Who has a boat in Denver?

160
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:52,250
Good-bye.

161
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:56,683
Hi.

162
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:04,461
Dagney? That's your name?
Tremendous name.

163
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:08,664
My name is Jimmy, and I just have
one simple, impulsive question:

164
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,137
- Are you in love?
- What?

165
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,676
- At the present time, are you in love?
- Why?

166
00:09:14,744 --> 00:09:17,372
Because if you are,
then I won't waste your time.

167
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:21,076
I mean, I'm not the type of man
to impede another man's happiness.

168
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,675
However, if you're
not presently in love,

169
00:09:23,753 --> 00:09:27,086
then I will continue my rhapsody,
because if I may so, Dagney,

170
00:09:27,156 --> 00:09:29,090
you are most definitely
the bee's knees.

171
00:09:29,158 --> 00:09:31,820
Does this rap ever work?

172
00:09:31,894 --> 00:09:35,352
Alas, in the old days.
Uh, now I rarely get a chance to try it.

173
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:38,332
But you haven't answered
my question.

174
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:40,961
- I forgot it.
- Are you in love?

175
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:43,938
- Well, there is someone.
- But?

176
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:49,069
We date. I have memorized his phone
number, but I won't use his toothbrush.

177
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:53,104
We're somewhere in between,
and he's crazy about me.

178
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:55,116
As he should be.
You glide.

179
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:58,017
- I glide?
- You glide. It's a very attractive quality.

180
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:02,615
Most girls, they merely plod along.
You, on the other hand, you glide.

181
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:05,490
Tell me about it.
What's his name? Chip?

182
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:09,588
- Alex.
- Same thing. Does he... make you thump?

183
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:11,895
Define "thump. "

184
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:14,436
Thump. When you think about him,
you can't eat, you can't sleep.

185
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:17,803
When he smiles, you forget about man's
inhumanity to man. Does he do that for you?

186
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:20,365
That's a ridiculous concept.
No one can do that.

187
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:23,776
Girls who glide need guys
who make them thump.

188
00:10:23,846 --> 00:10:25,780
"Girls who glide need guys
who make 'em thump. "

189
00:10:25,848 --> 00:10:28,442
- Have dinner with me.
- Aren't we the sultan of segue?

190
00:10:28,518 --> 00:10:32,249
- It's a beautiful month. Just have dinner with me.
- Are you gonna make me thump?

191
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:34,687
Or die trying.
Dinner.

192
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:41,830
Just dinner.

193
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:46,465
- I'm gonna regret this.
- Only if we're lucky.

194
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:49,562
o/ I took a peek through my window o/

195
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,370
- o/ And what'd you think I seen o/
- Right here.

196
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:55,433
o/ My baby settin'
beside another- o/

197
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:58,309
- See ya, Jack.
- I'll see ya.

198
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,116
- Oh, m- Oh, my- my lucky
fuckin' day. What? - Hey.

199
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:11,126
- Jimmy the Saint.
- Hello, boys.

200
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:13,788
- That's a nice suit. Versace?
- No.

201
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:14,761
- Armani?
- No.

202
00:11:14,831 --> 00:11:16,128
Hugo Boss?

203
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:18,599
- What's with this?
- Ellie's P.O. said he needed a hobby.

204
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:21,933
- Fashion is his hobby?
- He tried makin' his own pasta.

205
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:23,938
Didn't move him.

206
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:27,271
A three-button ventless.
I like that, Jimmy. Classy.

207
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:32,076
'Course, uh, you gotta
have the build for it.

208
00:11:32,148 --> 00:11:34,207
- What's up?
- He wants to see you, Jim.

209
00:11:34,283 --> 00:11:37,377
- Aw, come on. What for?
- Hey, what can I tell ya?

210
00:11:37,453 --> 00:11:39,421
He says, "Gus, I wanna
see Jimmy the Saint. "

211
00:11:39,488 --> 00:11:42,548
I said, "Boss, Jimmy the Saint
ain't mixin' it up no more. "

212
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:47,756
He says, "Gus, I wanna
see Jimmy the Saint. "

213
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,798
Here we are.

214
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:53,165
The point of me arguing
seemed, uh, specious.

215
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:56,705
Gus is readin' the dictionary.

216
00:11:56,772 --> 00:11:59,138
Good.

217
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,073
- When does he want to see me?
- Now.

218
00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:04,203
- Now?
- Anon.

219
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:31,096
You know the dance.

220
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:35,370
It's been a long time,
huh, Jimmy?

221
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:03,799
Long time, Jimmy.
You don't come around.

222
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,942
Been busy.
Workin' hard.

223
00:13:10,713 --> 00:13:12,647
Right.

224
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:44,006
Citizen now.

225
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,174
Legitimate businessman.

226
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:49,217
I heard
about your endeavor,

227
00:13:49,285 --> 00:13:53,654
some kind of support group thing
for dying fags or something.

228
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:58,990
- Something.
- I spend all my time with these two fuckin' morons...

229
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:01,689
and my village idiot son.

230
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:03,823
I miss my wife, Jimmy.

231
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,834
You remember Cynthia?

232
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,530
Beautiful lady. Special.

233
00:14:10,606 --> 00:14:14,235
Thank God she never had
to see me like this.

234
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:18,173
Look at you.
You got a lady?

235
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:21,341
- No.
- That's 'cause you're hangin' around...

236
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:24,614
with the virus breeders,
Jimmy: V.B.s.

237
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:26,985
You into that yet?
Bitin' the pillow?

238
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:29,650
- No.
- You will.

239
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:33,058
It's a liberal thing. One day
you're saving the rain forest,

240
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:35,063
the next you're chugging cock.

241
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:38,464
- Am I wrong?
- Talk to me, will ya?

242
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:43,801
I want peace.

243
00:14:43,873 --> 00:14:46,637
I'm ass-fixed
to this chair. I'm tired.

244
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:48,700
I'm old.

245
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:52,908
I shit in a bag.
I piss in another.

246
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:54,916
I got a nurse.

247
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:58,987
Call the nurse.

248
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:09,226
Hello, Melanie.
Nod to my friend Jimmy.

249
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:11,664
- Hello.
- How are you?

250
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:14,635
Excuse us.

251
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:19,941
She's a ten.

252
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:22,341
Jimmy, she's a planet
unto herself.

253
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:25,847
She can't nurse worth shit,
but I keep her on 'cause...

254
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:30,113
although I can't feel it, I know
I have erections in her presence.

255
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:31,744
- You understand?
- I understand.

256
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:35,086
Good. Then you'll understand
when I say this.

257
00:15:35,157 --> 00:15:40,618
Bernard, my son, he's all that's
left of my Cynthia,

258
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:42,664
and he's crazy
as a shithouse rat.

259
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:45,564
The other day
they catch him...

260
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:48,034
in the elementary school
playground...

261
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:50,902
grabbin' itty-bitty titty.

262
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:52,907
It was a mess.

263
00:15:52,975 --> 00:15:55,443
And the thing is,
I understand the problem.

264
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:57,945
Bernard's problem-

265
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,244
Do you remember Meg?

266
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,084
- Yeah.
- Meg was...

267
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:12,319
Bernard's high-school
sweetheart, you know.

268
00:16:12,394 --> 00:16:14,521
They kept it up
through college.

269
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:18,431
We thought they was
gonna get hitched.

270
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:30,102
Until she met
this beat Bruce.

271
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:33,580
Studying to be
an orthodontist.

272
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:36,914
She busted up with Bernard and moved
to L.A. with this beat Bruce.

273
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:42,824
Bernard's never been the same.

274
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:46,020
I understand part of this
was inevitable.

275
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:49,394
Being the son of me,
he lacks initiative.

276
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:55,370
Since this Meg thing,
his behavior is... worse.

277
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:59,430
Don't hurt me, man.
Oh, f- Oh! Oww!

278
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,703
And now,

279
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:07,044
this thing in the schoolyard,
uh, is a fiasco.

280
00:17:07,116 --> 00:17:09,949
My intelligence tells me...

281
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:12,180
this beat Bruce
is comin' to Denver.

282
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:16,657
Meet Meg's folks, ask their permission
to marry the little bangtail.

283
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:19,592
This can't happen.

284
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:22,893
Meg loved Bernard
for seven years.

285
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:25,627
She can learn
to love him again.

286
00:17:28,237 --> 00:17:32,537
- What do you want done?
- It's just an action. It's not a piece of work.

287
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:36,374
Catch the creep
out on the highway...

288
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:39,346
before he gets to Meg's,
brace him.

289
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:43,943
Make it so's he'd sooner
fuck the Fryolater than propose to Meg.

290
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:48,479
- Why me?
- Jimmy, you got the nice suit, you got the $70 haircut,

291
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:52,220
but you are taking a dump
in your video business.

292
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:54,489
I gotta call in the note.

293
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:57,532
What do you mean you gotta call in the
note? I didn't take the note off of you.

294
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,125
- I took it off of New Orleans Sal.
- Took it off New Orleans Sal?

295
00:18:00,202 --> 00:18:02,534
Who do you think New Orleans Sal
took it off of?

296
00:18:05,274 --> 00:18:08,835
Mmm, you ain't
no entrepreneur, Jimmy.

297
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:19,784
Okay. I need a crew.

298
00:18:19,855 --> 00:18:22,983
- Maybe four.
- I worship you.

299
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:26,994
I'm payin' 50 Gs straight out.
It's just an action.

300
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:28,996
Split it
any way you want.

301
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:31,862
You wanna throw those pathetic yuks
some scratch,

302
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:35,700
I applaud your...
sensitivity.

303
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:39,036
For Cynthia, do it.

304
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:41,201
For Cynthia-

305
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:44,303
may she rest in peace-
do it!

306
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,814
For the old days,

307
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:48,816
do it.

308
00:18:48,884 --> 00:18:51,148
For your fag business,
just do it.

309
00:18:53,956 --> 00:18:56,220
Hey. Here's Ellie.
Brought you some seltzer.

310
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:09,597
Aaarrghh!

311
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:12,004
Aarrghh! Come back!

312
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:15,908
- Aye! Got ya!
Arrghh! Got you too!

313
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:17,912
Ohh!

314
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,414
Oh, ya bloody son of the sea.

315
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:25,086
Arrghh!

316
00:19:25,154 --> 00:19:27,088
You can't
catch me!

317
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:29,090
Oh, shit.

318
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:34,624
Things are different now,
Slick.

319
00:19:34,697 --> 00:19:36,631
I mean,
we're dug in here,

320
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:38,667
and I'm managing
the park now.

321
00:19:38,734 --> 00:19:41,032
I do a few odd jobs,
make a little money.

322
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:44,231
I got free rent, got
a good situation here.

323
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:48,367
I understand. A one-shot deal.
We're in, we're out.

324
00:19:48,444 --> 00:19:52,210
Give it a name. If it's so easy,
why do you need a crew?

325
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:54,215
Safety in numbers.

326
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:56,717
Plus the man
wants to pay the freight.

327
00:19:56,785 --> 00:20:00,346
- Who am I to argue?
- I don't know, Jimmy.

328
00:20:00,422 --> 00:20:03,858
- I mean, I got more than myself to think about now.
- I understand.

329
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:07,657
I got Dodie.
She's pregnant again.

330
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,789
- You oughta put a harness
on that tool there.

331
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:13,130
Yeah, give it a name.
Anyway, I got her and the kids now.

332
00:20:13,202 --> 00:20:15,534
I know.
They're cute kids, man.

333
00:20:17,072 --> 00:20:21,031
My last bit, man,
locked down,

334
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,772
this is all
I thought about.

335
00:20:25,481 --> 00:20:27,506
Ten large.

336
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,143
Your call.
It's not my call.

337
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:32,847
Ten large there.

338
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:35,389
Come on. Let's go say
hello to Dodie, huh?

339
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:37,516
o/ When I reach that promised land o/

340
00:20:37,593 --> 00:20:40,255
- Hey. How ya doin', baby? Come here.
- Where you been?

341
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:43,560
- Remember Jimmy the Saint?
- Hello, Dodie.

342
00:20:43,632 --> 00:20:46,328
- Jimmy, want a Coke or something?
- Sure.

343
00:20:46,402 --> 00:20:50,498
o/ Brother, by and by o/

344
00:20:50,572 --> 00:20:54,508
o/ By and by
When I walk down the lonesome valley o/

345
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:56,669
o/ That adjoins
the lonesome sky o/

346
00:20:56,745 --> 00:20:59,908
- o/ Now I know my baby's waiting o/
- How are you, Dodie?

347
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:09,186
o/ By and by
Brother, by and by o/

348
00:21:09,258 --> 00:21:11,192
o/ By and by o/

349
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,353
o/ When I walk down
the lonesome valley o/

350
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:15,363
Let me ask you something,
Jimmy.

351
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:20,668
You gonna go through with this thing
no matter what?

352
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:26,233
I got to. He's got me
on the dangle.

353
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:28,333
o/ By and by o/

354
00:21:33,015 --> 00:21:34,949
Can't believe that Pieces,
of all people,

355
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:36,951
is workin'
in this fuckin' joint.

356
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:38,953
- Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
- You.

357
00:21:39,021 --> 00:21:42,047
- You stake me for a cup of coffee, baby?
- Fuck off, cheese breath.

358
00:21:42,124 --> 00:21:45,116
Look at you, filthy fucking Franchise.
You're still alive.

359
00:21:45,194 --> 00:21:47,128
Thought you were doin'
a stretch in County.

360
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:50,461
I escaped 'cause I was
missin' your nasty little pussy, baby.

361
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:53,194
Shut up. Hook me up.
Come on, Jimmy, five bucks.

362
00:21:53,268 --> 00:21:55,202
Give me five bucks
and I'll pay you back tomorrow, man.

363
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,204
What's the matter, baby?
Your spread ain't sellin'...

364
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,832
on account of you ain't takin' care
of the merchandise anymore?

365
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:02,604
- Hey, fuck you, Franchise.
- No, thanks.

366
00:22:02,678 --> 00:22:05,647
Jimmy knows I'm sweet on him,
don't you, Jimmy?

367
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:08,148
That's my boy.

368
00:22:08,217 --> 00:22:10,378
- Clean?
- Always.

369
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:14,750
- Right.
- That's my man.

370
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:18,224
Ooh! Me and Jimmy, one day
we's gonna have us a love child.

371
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,227
- Whatever.
- Ain't that right, Jimmy?

372
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:22,229
- Right.
- Hmm. Hey.

373
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:26,893
I gotta be goin'. The pussy posse's been
rollin' this neighborhood bustin' everybody.

374
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:29,460
Thanks for the money,
baby.

375
00:22:29,538 --> 00:22:31,472
Better stay clean.

376
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,942
- She don't look good, Slick.
- No.

377
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:40,607
Needle track city, man. You shouldn't
go contributing to her collapse, man.

378
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:43,048
Give it a name. Lucinda'll
be dancin' in the breeze...

379
00:22:43,118 --> 00:22:45,052
long after you and I
are takin' the dirt nap.

380
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,315
- Don't touch anything in here.
- Whatever.

381
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:49,949
I'm ready.

382
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:52,516
You still got that disease, Pieces?

383
00:22:52,594 --> 00:22:54,892
Cut the shit with that!

384
00:22:54,963 --> 00:22:58,091
It's Olden.
My name is Olden.

385
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:01,727
Always with this "Pieces" shit.
Have a little respect.

386
00:23:01,803 --> 00:23:03,737
Whatever, man, I'm sorry.
Didn't mean nothin' by it.

387
00:23:03,805 --> 00:23:05,864
Did they
find out what it is yet?

388
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:09,399
Naw. In fact, I lost
a toe the other day.

389
00:23:09,478 --> 00:23:11,742
Believe that shit?
A toe?

390
00:23:11,813 --> 00:23:16,216
I found a croaker downtown diagnosed it
as a circulatory problem,

391
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:18,446
a fuckin' circulatory problem.

392
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,457
I want to kill the bastard, but I can't
get my fuckin' fingers around his-

393
00:23:30,165 --> 00:23:33,498
- Ahh.
- Ow. This is a bad beat, Olden.

394
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:35,503
Aw, give it a name.

395
00:23:35,571 --> 00:23:37,596
You do your time.

396
00:23:37,673 --> 00:23:40,733
You make an oath
to go right and rigid,

397
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:42,743
and this is how
you end up,

398
00:23:42,811 --> 00:23:45,473
watching a bunch of raincoat types
kick their gongs around...

399
00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:47,674
and losin'
motherfuckin' toes.

400
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:54,020
The Man... mentioned me
in particular?

401
00:23:54,089 --> 00:23:56,455
Yes, he did.

402
00:23:56,525 --> 00:23:59,050
- I haven't seen him in years.
- He likes you.

403
00:24:00,362 --> 00:24:02,694
- Me?
- Oh, you're so hard.

404
00:24:02,764 --> 00:24:06,757
- So? Are you in?
- Absolutely, Jim.

405
00:24:06,835 --> 00:24:10,464
I'll use the dough
to get me a legit croaker,

406
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:13,975
diagnose my malady on the up-and-up
before I lose my dick.

407
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:18,775
We got a skull session tomorrow at
the Thick 'n' Rich. Can you make it?

408
00:24:18,847 --> 00:24:21,873
Aw, sh-

409
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,418
I'm already there, baby.

410
00:24:24,486 --> 00:24:26,477
- See ya.
- All right.

411
00:24:32,294 --> 00:24:34,922
You're breakin'
my heart here, ol' Franny.

412
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:39,390
Good to see you, Olden.

413
00:24:39,468 --> 00:24:43,302
I'm coming. I'm-

414
00:24:43,372 --> 00:24:46,432
o/ But that train
keeps a-rollin' o/

415
00:24:46,508 --> 00:24:49,443
o/ On down to San Antone o/

416
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:53,140
o/ When I was just a baby o/

417
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:55,479
o/ My mama told me
Son o/

418
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:59,042
o/ Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns o/

419
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:02,181
o/ But I shot
a man in Reno o/

420
00:25:02,257 --> 00:25:05,283
o/ Just to watch him die o/

421
00:25:08,196 --> 00:25:10,426
o/ When I hear
that whistle blowin' o/

422
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:13,730
o/ I hang my head and cry o/

423
00:25:13,802 --> 00:25:16,236
o/ Yeah o/

424
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:24,368
Critical Bill, man,
what the fuck are you doin'?

425
00:25:24,446 --> 00:25:27,711
Workin' out.
Don't bother him much.

426
00:25:27,783 --> 00:25:31,810
What's the matter with you, man? Why
don't you show some respect for the dead?

427
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:34,617
I knew this guy when he was alive.
He was a mammy rammer.

428
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:38,182
- He don't mind much.
- Old Man Carlotti know you're doin' this?

429
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,888
Oh, he don't mind much.

430
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:47,167
Bill,

431
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:51,831
uh, we're doin' an action
for the Man With The Plan.

432
00:25:51,907 --> 00:25:56,606
Small time, one night's work.
It's good for ten large. You want in?

433
00:25:56,678 --> 00:25:58,543
- Ten large?
- Yeah.

434
00:26:01,817 --> 00:26:04,377
Yeah.

435
00:26:04,453 --> 00:26:06,785
Okay. I guess.

436
00:26:06,855 --> 00:26:09,050
Good.

437
00:26:09,124 --> 00:26:12,184
Critical Bill,
you still crazy, man?

438
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,822
'Cause you still crazy, I say you stay here
and you beat up on all your old friends,

439
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:18,866
'cause we don't need you,
Bill, if you're crazy.

440
00:26:18,934 --> 00:26:21,198
I am what I am:

441
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:24,261
back of beyond,
right?

442
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:27,831
Same as always.
I'm in the back of beyond.

443
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:32,710
- Whatever.
- o/ And I'd let that lonesome whistle o/

444
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:35,306
o/ Blow my blues away o/

445
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,184
- o/ Yeah o/
- They call him Critical Bill...

446
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:44,725
because he never went up
against a guy Bill didn't put...

447
00:26:44,793 --> 00:26:47,956
the guy in a critical condition
at the very least.

448
00:26:48,096 --> 00:26:52,430
But in the days, there never was
a better wing man when things got dange.

449
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:55,402
Boy's got equal parts piss,
pesticide...

450
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,406
and pure petroleum jelly
runnin' through those veins.

451
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:02,910
All right, the kid's comin' in at
approximately 10:00 p. m. on Highway 70.

452
00:27:02,978 --> 00:27:06,675
Olden's gonna get us some uniforms,
and we already got a car.

453
00:27:06,748 --> 00:27:08,909
Olden and me are gonna
pull the kid over.

454
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:11,418
Bill, you're gonna be with Jimmy
in the moving van.

455
00:27:11,486 --> 00:27:15,820
Bring the kid there,
we scare him and that's it.

456
00:27:15,891 --> 00:27:18,985
It is what it is.
Bottom line, we're playing cupid...

457
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,996
to an overweight, silver-spooned,
simpleton, child-molesting fuck.

458
00:27:23,064 --> 00:27:27,000
That's what it is, but it's good
for ten each. Nobody gets hurt.

459
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:30,435
Give it a name.
Anybody got any questions?

460
00:27:30,505 --> 00:27:32,496
Ya got somebody
to keep the beat?

461
00:27:32,574 --> 00:27:35,907
Funny you should mention that.

462
00:27:35,977 --> 00:27:38,445
Everybody knows Easy Wind.

463
00:27:38,513 --> 00:27:41,004
Look at this. Look at this!

464
00:27:41,082 --> 00:27:43,744
All the pig brothers
from back in the day.

465
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:46,913
- Jimmy the Saint.
- Easy does it.

466
00:27:46,988 --> 00:27:49,957
- Big bad Franchise.
- Easy Wind, my brother from another mother.

467
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:51,788
Pieces Polymeros.

468
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,885
Yeah.

469
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,791
Hey, man, nobody told me
about this booyah, man.

470
00:27:57,866 --> 00:27:59,925
And nobody told me
I'd be humpin' with no inky-dink.

471
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:02,492
- All right, easy. Settle down.
- No, Jimmy, I can't roll with this.

472
00:28:02,571 --> 00:28:04,869
- No fuckin' way!
- Hey, watch your mouth!

473
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,932
- You boys used to be close.
- Yeah, 'til we ended up in jail together.

474
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:10,204
Homeboy turned out
to be a major-league fecal freak.

475
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:13,509
- What?
- Easy Wind spent his time in the joint raping kids.

476
00:28:13,582 --> 00:28:15,914
- Better than being a fecal freak.
- What?

477
00:28:15,984 --> 00:28:17,952
Fecal freak!
A brown boy!

478
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:21,182
- A fuckin' dookey taster!
- Jive-ass nigger-boy shine!

479
00:28:21,256 --> 00:28:23,190
Who the fuck do you
think you are?

480
00:28:23,258 --> 00:28:25,988
You son-of-a-bitch!

481
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:28,655
Sit down, Bill! Sit down!

482
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,221
- Sit down! Sit down!
- Sit down, man!

483
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:33,824
Children here, man!
There are children here.

484
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:37,201
Sit down! Get down!
We're in a goddamn malt shop.

485
00:28:37,272 --> 00:28:39,570
Sorry, Malt.

486
00:28:39,641 --> 00:28:41,575
Sit down.

487
00:28:41,643 --> 00:28:43,873
It's okay, kids.

488
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,948
Part of the show.

489
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:49,950
Nice.

490
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:53,384
Real nice.

491
00:28:57,225 --> 00:28:59,159
Fuckin' shit eater.

492
00:29:02,664 --> 00:29:05,394
Hey! Now settle down!

493
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:08,163
Motherfucker!

494
00:29:08,236 --> 00:29:11,797
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Old friends gettin' together.

495
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:14,000
Watch out, Bill!

496
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:16,305
Kind of brings a tear
to the eye, don't it, fellas?

497
00:29:16,378 --> 00:29:18,403
It's okay, kids.

498
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,314
- See ya around, Slick. Stay cool, Bill.
- Okay.

499
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:26,318
- What's up?
- Jimmy,

500
00:29:26,388 --> 00:29:29,687
you know, uh, when we go out there,
you know, on the highway...

501
00:29:29,758 --> 00:29:32,090
and we brace that kid?

502
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,323
I k- I would-
I would really like to be one-

503
00:29:35,397 --> 00:29:38,332
- I would like to be one of the cops, Jimmy.
- No, Bill.

504
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,301
Jimmy. Damn it, Jimmy,
I'm 41 fuckin' years old...

505
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:43,303
and they still call me
Critical Bill, you know?

506
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:45,430
I have really changed, man.
How do you think that makes me feel?

507
00:29:45,507 --> 00:29:47,532
Billy. You're beating up
on corpses, Bill.

508
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:50,169
Well, that's the point, Jimmy.
That's the thing, man.

509
00:29:50,245 --> 00:29:53,806
Doin' that with them- with them bodies,
I mean, that keeps my powder dry.

510
00:29:53,882 --> 00:29:57,511
- Billy.
- It keeps my powder dry. It keeps my powder dry, Jimmy.

511
00:29:57,585 --> 00:30:00,179
Listen to me. I haven't touched
a live person in years,

512
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:02,553
not since I started
that exercise program.

513
00:30:02,624 --> 00:30:04,888
You know? I mean,
the prison shrinks told me...

514
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,894
I should find myself
a healthy and creative outlet.

515
00:30:06,962 --> 00:30:11,092
- Well, I found it.
- Billy, I remember the things in the days. No.

516
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:13,600
Well, what do you mean,
a person can't change?

517
00:30:13,668 --> 00:30:16,603
I mean, word is on the street
that you changed in a big way.

518
00:30:16,671 --> 00:30:19,731
- How come nobody else can change but you?
- What happened inside, Bill?

519
00:30:19,808 --> 00:30:21,742
Please, Jimmy.
Please let me.

520
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,142
Come on, man. Just once.

521
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:28,772
Olden does
all the talking.

522
00:30:32,954 --> 00:30:35,320
- Okay, get out of here. Come on.
- Thank you, Jimmy.

523
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,722
- Yeah, okay. Let's go.
- Okay. All right. Thank you, Jimmy.

524
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:40,522
All right.
Don't be late.

525
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:42,620
Thank you, Jimmy.

526
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:47,930
Why do you teach
at Vail?

527
00:30:48,003 --> 00:30:51,200
The clientele at Vail
has more money,

528
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:54,002
so you make great tips
on private lessons.

529
00:30:57,645 --> 00:30:59,840
I'm sure you're
a fabulous skier.

530
00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:04,584
- I get down the mountain.
- I'm sure you do.

531
00:31:04,652 --> 00:31:06,586
I've never skied before
in my life.

532
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:13,559
The only skis in my neighborhood
were the Polish couple down the hall.

533
00:31:13,628 --> 00:31:15,858
Jimmy.

534
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:20,128
Jimmy "Lo Santo" Tosnia.
Giovanni, vieni 'ca.

535
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:23,728
Where you been? You don't come around
no more? You find a better joint?

536
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:25,739
I've been
a homebody, Sal.

537
00:31:25,807 --> 00:31:27,741
Dagney,
Salvatori D'amagli.

538
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:31,472
Piacere, bella.

539
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:35,710
- Watch it.
- Scusi.

540
00:31:35,784 --> 00:31:37,945
For the return
of Jimmy the Saint...

541
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:40,544
and for the angel
who brought him back to us.

542
00:31:40,622 --> 00:31:42,556
Grazie.

543
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:44,558
o/o/

544
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:47,459
I'm gettin' some pretty heavy
Lady and the Tramp vibes.

545
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:52,196
I'll translate.

546
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:55,930
o/o/

547
00:31:56,004 --> 00:31:59,030
- "Look at the sea. How beautiful. "
- o/o/

548
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:03,403
- "It inspires such feeling. "
- o/o/

549
00:32:06,014 --> 00:32:07,948
"Someone you're
thinking about. "

550
00:32:08,016 --> 00:32:12,009
o/o/

551
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:15,454
- I don't know what that means.
- o/o/

552
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:18,424
"You say you're leaving. "

553
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:20,518
o/o/

554
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:22,620
"Far away from my heart. "

555
00:32:22,697 --> 00:32:27,031
o/o/

556
00:32:27,102 --> 00:32:29,593
"From our land of love. "

557
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:32,231
o/o/

558
00:32:32,307 --> 00:32:34,707
"You have my heart,
but you won't return. "

559
00:32:37,612 --> 00:32:40,479
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

560
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,984
You didn't buy it, huh?

561
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:47,044
No, I didn't.

562
00:32:47,122 --> 00:32:49,852
- The maitre d', Sally?
- Yes.

563
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:52,256
- He called you Jimmy the Saint.
- Ah, yes.

564
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:55,228
- Well, how come?
- 'Cause I say 11 "Our Fathers"...

565
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,322
and a "Hail Mary, Full of Grace"
every time I go to bed...

566
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,333
and I never kiss
on the first date.

567
00:33:02,103 --> 00:33:04,037
- Really?
- Sad, but true.

568
00:33:05,106 --> 00:33:07,131
Do you wanna come in?

569
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:11,269
More than I want the ascot to
come back into style, but not tonight.

570
00:33:11,346 --> 00:33:13,814
Rules are rules.

571
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:18,385
You know, I could
look at you here forever.

572
00:33:18,453 --> 00:33:23,152
I wouldn't have to do anything else,
just stand and look at you.

573
00:33:23,224 --> 00:33:25,886
You're a thing
to be amazed by.

574
00:33:36,905 --> 00:33:38,839
Good night.

575
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:42,943
'Night.

576
00:34:05,733 --> 00:34:08,167
Hi.

577
00:34:08,236 --> 00:34:11,433
On the way out,
I happened to notice the time.

578
00:34:11,506 --> 00:34:15,408
It's now 12:04,
so... a new day.

579
00:34:15,476 --> 00:34:19,674
- So, technically-
- This is now our second date.

580
00:34:19,747 --> 00:34:22,011
Rules are rules.

581
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:24,483
Yes.

582
00:34:51,713 --> 00:34:55,649
The beginnings are always the best.

583
00:34:55,717 --> 00:34:59,915
When you first start
to explore each other, to learn.

584
00:35:03,424 --> 00:35:06,120
- I'll call you later.
When you watch the phone...

585
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:08,719
like it was the TV,
waiting for it to ring.

586
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:12,061
Oh, the insanity, that...

587
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:15,102
heartsick insanity.

588
00:35:15,169 --> 00:35:19,868
It always fades eventually,
but God, while it's happening,

589
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:22,535
there's nothing
like it in the world.

590
00:35:26,414 --> 00:35:30,441
o/ First you leave me, Then o/

591
00:35:30,518 --> 00:35:32,543
o/ You say you want me back o/

592
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,145
Talk to me, big man.

593
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:38,215
The big man is gettin'
older on the shoulder.

594
00:35:39,694 --> 00:35:41,662
Just hang tough.

595
00:35:41,729 --> 00:35:43,924
Enjoy the scenery.
It won't be long.

596
00:35:43,998 --> 00:35:45,966
Yeah, what fuckin' scenery?

597
00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:48,594
There's nothin' but cowshit
and fruit flies out here.

598
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:51,230
Then I'd advise you
to keep your mouth shut.

599
00:35:52,407 --> 00:35:56,776
o/ Why did I ever
ever say good-bye o/

600
00:35:56,844 --> 00:36:00,644
o/ I'm gonna crawl
right off and die o/

601
00:36:16,798 --> 00:36:19,824
Where is this asshole?

602
00:36:24,772 --> 00:36:27,536
o/ I may never be a king o/

603
00:36:27,608 --> 00:36:29,599
o/ May never be a millionaire o/

604
00:36:33,314 --> 00:36:37,774
o/ So, baby, I don't care o/

605
00:36:37,852 --> 00:36:41,583
o/ You know what to do, We're there o/

606
00:36:41,656 --> 00:36:44,090
- Shit.
- o/ This is my- o/

607
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:48,324
Sh-

608
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,841
The orthodontist has landed.

609
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:04,503
Here we go.

610
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:06,911
Okay, fellas.
Just stay cool.

611
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:09,916
Get him in that cruiser,
bring him down here...

612
00:37:09,984 --> 00:37:11,975
and we'll get this done,
then I'm buying at the Thick.

613
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:19,719
Nice.

614
00:37:22,563 --> 00:37:24,497
Aw, shit.

615
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:31,661
You don't say dick,
all right? Not dick.

616
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:33,866
My lips are locked.

617
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:35,909
The key is in the river.

618
00:37:43,117 --> 00:37:45,051
o/ What to do
We're there o/

619
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,643
o/ Yeah o/

620
00:37:55,363 --> 00:37:58,696
- License and registration.
- What was I doing wrong?

621
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:01,234
License
and registration.

622
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:05,929
o/o/

623
00:38:11,746 --> 00:38:13,680
You wanna step
from the vehicle, son?

624
00:38:16,384 --> 00:38:19,251
- Why?
- Just step from the vehicle.

625
00:38:22,723 --> 00:38:25,021
Can I see some I.D.,
please?

626
00:38:26,227 --> 00:38:29,390
- Now, son-
- Look, I know my rights, okay?

627
00:38:29,464 --> 00:38:32,160
I've heard about guys
impersonatin' cops, shakin' people down.

628
00:38:32,233 --> 00:38:35,464
I'm from L.A., okay? I know
about that thing. I know my rights.

629
00:38:35,536 --> 00:38:40,337
- Let me see some I.D. - That's, uh-
That's not the way we do things here.

630
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:42,740
I don't like the way
your uniforms fit.

631
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:46,712
You oughta take that bass
out of your voice right now, boy.

632
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:48,874
I got this
under control here.

633
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:53,981
Son, we need
some cooperation.

634
00:38:54,055 --> 00:38:56,853
You know, maybe I'm
just a complete asshole,

635
00:38:56,924 --> 00:39:01,884
but doesn't the highway fall under
the jurisdiction of the State Police?

636
00:39:01,963 --> 00:39:03,897
It does, doesn't it?

637
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:08,493
Well, what are a couple of Denver City
Police Department guys doing way out here?

638
00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:11,595
It's early yet.

639
00:39:11,672 --> 00:39:14,232
I got a bad feeling, Jimmy.

640
00:39:16,744 --> 00:39:19,042
How's it looking,
big man?

641
00:39:19,113 --> 00:39:21,980
Havin' a little chat.
Looking good.

642
00:39:22,049 --> 00:39:24,040
Hey, what's your badge number?

643
00:39:24,118 --> 00:39:26,951
Come on, fella.

644
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:31,048
- Just- Just be easy about this. - 'Cause
it seems to me on a night like this-

645
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:33,616
And again, it's really
just one guy talking-

646
00:39:33,694 --> 00:39:36,060
But you guys would have
department-issued raincoats.

647
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,622
You know, plastic hat guards, that kind
of thing. What's the matter?

648
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,464
- Couldn't steal those?
- We're cops.

649
00:39:42,537 --> 00:39:45,734
- You're cops.
- Listen, kid-

650
00:39:45,806 --> 00:39:49,537
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. God, time out.
Bro, what is up with your fingers, man?

651
00:39:51,612 --> 00:39:54,410
Carpentry accident.
What's that got to do with anything?

652
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:58,976
Carpentry accident? Okay, so tell me,
Officer Leper, how are things down at-

653
00:39:59,053 --> 00:40:02,682
You wanna see some I.D.?
I'll give you some fuckin' I.D.!

654
00:40:02,757 --> 00:40:05,817
- Billy! Jeez! Jesus!
- Fuckin' I.D.!

655
00:40:05,893 --> 00:40:09,727
- Stop it, Billy!
- I ain't a cop! I ain't a cop, am I?

656
00:40:09,797 --> 00:40:12,630
The kid's out of the van.

657
00:40:14,936 --> 00:40:17,097
- Stop!
- I'll make you fuckin' believe me!

658
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:19,571
- Billy! Billy!
- Goddamn right, I will!

659
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,370
- Come on! Hey, Billy! Easy! Easy!
- Do ya?

660
00:40:22,443 --> 00:40:26,243
- Do ya, boy? Huh?
- Billy, come on. Okay, buddy. It's okay.

661
00:40:26,314 --> 00:40:29,181
It's okay. Let's- Let's go.

662
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,708
- Let's go! Stop it!
- You fuckin' fecal freak, don't fuckin' do it.

663
00:40:32,787 --> 00:40:36,587
- Don't fuckin' do it.
- Let's go! Let's go! Stop it! It's okay.

664
00:40:36,657 --> 00:40:38,682
It's okay.

665
00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:44,261
Let's go. Come on.

666
00:40:44,332 --> 00:40:47,096
Let's... go.

667
00:40:58,346 --> 00:41:00,940
Dumb fuckin' cracker.

668
00:41:04,285 --> 00:41:08,619
- Put the knife down, damn it!
- What the fuck is that?

669
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:12,090
Surprise, surprise.
Billy tripped a fuckin' brain wire.

670
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,253
- Are you pointin' a fuckin' gun at me?
- Drop the blade now!

671
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:19,766
Drop it! I'll shoot you.
I will shoot you.

672
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:23,861
We got a thing here. Brown boy looks like
he wants to do a little roadside whittling.

673
00:41:23,938 --> 00:41:27,101
- Shit! Fuck! I knew it!
- Get over there, big man,

674
00:41:27,174 --> 00:41:29,108
right now.

675
00:41:29,176 --> 00:41:32,111
Fuck him!
I don't fuckin' believe this!

676
00:41:36,317 --> 00:41:39,480
Earl! Talk to me, Earl!

677
00:41:39,553 --> 00:41:42,420
Fuck, man! We're fucked!

678
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:54,358
Stupid cunt.

679
00:41:54,435 --> 00:41:57,700
Aah! Aah!

680
00:41:57,772 --> 00:42:00,639
Bill! Bilbo!

681
00:42:03,511 --> 00:42:07,242
No!

682
00:42:22,296 --> 00:42:24,992
What the fuck?

683
00:42:28,836 --> 00:42:30,827
Don't tell me.

684
00:42:30,905 --> 00:42:32,964
This is Meg.

685
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,974
Ohh.

686
00:42:36,043 --> 00:42:38,375
They did it, J.
They fucked it, man.

687
00:42:38,446 --> 00:42:40,937
They fucked it all.
They fucked it all, man.

688
00:42:41,015 --> 00:42:42,949
They're dead.
They're fuckin' dead.

689
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:45,508
I'm standin' here
with dead bodies, J.!

690
00:42:45,586 --> 00:42:48,419
And they're kids.
They're fuckin' kids, man!

691
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:50,423
Two of 'em!

692
00:42:50,491 --> 00:42:52,550
What the fuck
did you do?

693
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:57,359
Now, how the hell did she go and sleep
through this whole goddamn thing?

694
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:00,531
We gotta clean
this shit up, man!

695
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:04,298
We gotta clean this shit up, man, now!
Come on, Pieces!

696
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:19,112
The fuckin' booyah.
The fuckin' brown boy!

697
00:43:19,186 --> 00:43:21,450
He cut that kid's throat
for no good goddamn reason!

698
00:43:21,522 --> 00:43:24,582
Hey, he was a trash mouth!
He called Pieces a leper!

699
00:43:24,658 --> 00:43:26,853
We don't stand up for each other,
we're gone.

700
00:43:26,927 --> 00:43:30,385
That's why you fuckin' mud flaps are dyin'
off, 'cause you don't stand up for each other!

701
00:43:30,464 --> 00:43:33,695
- You crazy bitch! Shut the fuck up!
- Come on, motherfucker!

702
00:43:33,768 --> 00:43:37,795
- Fuck that! Fuck that!
- Shut the fuck up!

703
00:43:37,872 --> 00:43:40,534
- You crazy bitch.
- Fucking bullshit!

704
00:43:40,608 --> 00:43:43,168
Sorry, Boris.

705
00:43:43,244 --> 00:43:47,180
You know how this works.
The intended decedent goes on top here.

706
00:43:47,248 --> 00:43:50,217
Your whacks
go in the bottom.

707
00:43:50,284 --> 00:43:53,617
The bereaved family never has a clue...

708
00:43:53,687 --> 00:43:58,124
their beloved is to spend eternity
with a couple of hit vics.

709
00:43:58,192 --> 00:44:01,161
- Putting one down tomorrow?
- Thomas Donahue, the dry cleaner.

710
00:44:01,228 --> 00:44:04,857
- Pulled a gun on me, didn't ya?
- You're gonna be fuckin' dead!

711
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,479
The thing of it is,
I don't see how it's our fault.

712
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:26,748
I mean, the Man's intelligence said
she wasn't supposed to be in the van.

713
00:44:26,821 --> 00:44:30,052
How the fuck are we
supposed to know?

714
00:44:30,124 --> 00:44:32,718
This whole thing's been
bullshit from the start.

715
00:44:53,581 --> 00:44:57,449
Talk about what's compelling.

716
00:44:57,518 --> 00:45:02,148
- About, um, how one...
- Fuck it.

717
00:45:02,223 --> 00:45:05,124
visit to the doctor's office
can change your whole life.

718
00:45:05,192 --> 00:45:07,126
You can be thinking
about two million things-

719
00:45:07,194 --> 00:45:10,686
about, uh, work or about
the man you're dating...

720
00:45:10,764 --> 00:45:16,031
or your family or... the latest
Kevin Costner picture and...

721
00:45:16,103 --> 00:45:20,267
then all of a sudden
you feel a lump.

722
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:23,833
And you go
to the doctor's and, uh,

723
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:28,814
in the course of a single office
visit, everything changes.

724
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,319
You tell me there's a worse word in
the English language than "malignant. "

725
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,826
I don't think so. I really-
I don't think so.

726
00:45:48,769 --> 00:45:50,999
Hi, this is Dagney.

727
00:45:51,071 --> 00:45:54,666
Leave me a message after the tone
and I'll call you right back.

728
00:46:18,499 --> 00:46:21,957
You remember
Lieutenant Atwater, Jimmy?

729
00:46:22,036 --> 00:46:24,061
Hello, Jimmy.

730
00:46:34,315 --> 00:46:38,945
An action, not a piece of work.
I said that.

731
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:42,045
- Did I not say that?
- Sir, if I could just exp-

732
00:46:42,122 --> 00:46:44,750
Don't "sir" me, Jim!

733
00:46:48,128 --> 00:46:51,325
You gonna beg?

734
00:46:51,398 --> 00:46:55,357
Well, get down on your knees
in your pretty suit.

735
00:46:55,436 --> 00:46:57,495
Beg. Grovel!

736
00:46:57,571 --> 00:46:59,562
You asked me back in.

737
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,541
I'm taking you out.

738
00:47:06,246 --> 00:47:09,738
So that's it. You're gonna
send these two, and they're gonna...

739
00:47:09,817 --> 00:47:13,446
stab me in a crowded Italian restaurant,
garrote me in my sleep?

740
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,454
Never.

741
00:47:21,695 --> 00:47:23,925
Not these two, not that way.

742
00:47:23,998 --> 00:47:26,660
We go back, me and you.

743
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:30,295
You lent the operation
a modicum of class in the days.

744
00:47:30,371 --> 00:47:33,898
That's why-
the milk of human kindness-

745
00:47:33,974 --> 00:47:36,670
I'm giving you... an out.

746
00:47:36,744 --> 00:47:40,236
You got 48 hours.

747
00:47:40,314 --> 00:47:43,306
Put it in the wind.

748
00:47:43,384 --> 00:47:45,511
Leave Denver.

749
00:47:45,586 --> 00:47:48,316
Go to Rome,
visit the Vatican.

750
00:47:48,389 --> 00:47:50,550
Pray to the God you abandoned
back in Brooklyn.

751
00:47:50,624 --> 00:47:53,184
Just put it
in the fuckin' wind, Jim,

752
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,660
or else I gotta do you too.

753
00:47:55,729 --> 00:47:59,130
- What about the others?
- Buckwheats.

754
00:48:03,804 --> 00:48:08,241
It wasn't their fault. They were following
my orders. I take full responsibility.

755
00:48:08,308 --> 00:48:10,242
Lovely.

756
00:48:11,478 --> 00:48:13,969
You're not a human being,
you're a waltz.

757
00:48:14,048 --> 00:48:17,848
Buckwheats, Jim,

758
00:48:17,918 --> 00:48:21,115
to your miserable band
of misfits.

759
00:48:21,188 --> 00:48:23,520
Buck-fuckin'- wheats.

760
00:48:40,274 --> 00:48:42,401
Jesus Chr-

761
00:48:42,476 --> 00:48:44,501
I got it. Jesus.

762
00:48:50,684 --> 00:48:52,618
Watch the curb.

763
00:48:52,686 --> 00:48:55,883
Look at all them. That's a tribute.

764
00:48:55,956 --> 00:49:00,723
Try as we may, death
is not something we ever prepare for.

765
00:49:00,794 --> 00:49:04,787
Check it out.
Little Lord Homicide.

766
00:49:04,865 --> 00:49:07,663
Especially not with someone we love.

767
00:49:07,734 --> 00:49:09,668
Any word?

768
00:49:09,736 --> 00:49:11,670
Here he comes.

769
00:49:25,352 --> 00:49:27,286
I'm dyin' here, Jimmy.

770
00:49:27,354 --> 00:49:29,822
Give it to us straight, Slick.

771
00:49:31,959 --> 00:49:34,325
- Buckwheats.
- What?

772
00:49:34,394 --> 00:49:36,453
Buckwheats.

773
00:49:37,698 --> 00:49:41,896
- Oh, my God. Wow.
- He said that?

774
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:44,802
- That's what he said. Buckwheats.
- This is-

775
00:49:44,872 --> 00:49:47,636
Well, bagpipe that shit, man.
Let's take his fuckin' ass out.

776
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:52,111
Will you shut the fuck up? This sick-ass
got us in this shit in the first place.

777
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:55,273
It's impossible anyway. Ever since
the Man With The Plan got shot,

778
00:49:55,349 --> 00:49:57,283
the security around him
has been insane.

779
00:49:57,351 --> 00:50:01,310
- Be easier to whack the fuckin' President.
- What do we do?

780
00:50:01,388 --> 00:50:06,155
Leave town. Go under. I'm talkin' to some
people. If you go under, you'll be safe.

781
00:50:08,428 --> 00:50:12,831
That's buckwheats for all of us, Jimmy?
Even you?

782
00:50:15,669 --> 00:50:18,331
All of us, Franny.
Even me.

783
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:22,834
Buckwheats is a whole other animal.

784
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:26,846
A guy orders a buckwheats hit, it just
don't mean take the guy out,

785
00:50:26,914 --> 00:50:30,281
it means take the guy out
in the most painful way possible.

786
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,511
It means
the vic should suffer.

787
00:50:32,586 --> 00:50:35,851
Typical buckwheat hit
is to shoot a guy up the ass.

788
00:50:35,923 --> 00:50:37,857
Yeah, uh, ba-bing.

789
00:50:37,925 --> 00:50:41,292
A slug up the ass,
you don't die so much as...

790
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:44,797
contort for a good 15 minutes,
then you die.

791
00:50:44,865 --> 00:50:50,132
I imagine it's like
crappin' white-hot razor blades.

792
00:50:50,204 --> 00:50:52,138
- Whew!
- You know?

793
00:50:52,206 --> 00:50:54,504
Oh. Hmm.

794
00:50:55,976 --> 00:50:59,002
Ah.

795
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:02,105
Now, you wanna take care of business,
you gotta do it in close.

796
00:51:02,182 --> 00:51:04,548
I mean, you can't shit where you eat,
hear what I'm saying?

797
00:51:04,918 --> 00:51:08,479
I hear tell the Man With The Plan,
he put it on front street.

798
00:51:08,555 --> 00:51:13,390
He got a bit of business- called in
a guy from El Paso, a Mr. Shush.

799
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:17,897
They call him Mr. Shush
'cause he don't say much, you know?

800
00:51:17,965 --> 00:51:22,664
Can't even see his face.
Won't say five words unless you beg him.

801
00:51:22,736 --> 00:51:26,001
He's a turtle. Yeah,
I would've called him that: a turtle.

802
00:51:26,073 --> 00:51:28,098
Ow! Gee!
Pay attention, will you?

803
00:51:28,175 --> 00:51:30,575
Yeah, he's a turtle.

804
00:51:32,646 --> 00:51:37,515
The most lethal contract killer
west of the Mississippi.

805
00:51:37,584 --> 00:51:39,984
Oh, they say he's clipped
over 200 believers.

806
00:51:45,592 --> 00:51:48,652
Now, come on!

807
00:51:53,867 --> 00:51:57,030
What's up, bro?
What do ya need?

808
00:51:57,104 --> 00:51:59,072
What can I get for ya?

809
00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:10,783
Fuck this, man.

810
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:14,048
Oh, shit!

811
00:52:14,121 --> 00:52:17,784
Yes, sir, when Mr. Shush
accepts your buckwheats paper,

812
00:52:17,858 --> 00:52:22,886
it's time to kiss the day good-bye and
get real cozy with the notion of eternity.

813
00:52:25,299 --> 00:52:27,324
You sure about this shit?

814
00:52:27,401 --> 00:52:30,598
Yeah. I was
by the Lazy Bird today.

815
00:52:30,671 --> 00:52:33,504
Baby Sinister is most
definitely with the program.

816
00:52:33,573 --> 00:52:36,041
Baby Sinister hates
my fucking guts.

817
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:38,577
He owes me, Earl.
I called in a marker.

818
00:52:38,645 --> 00:52:41,910
Plus the idea of gettin' the Man
all crossed up appeals to him.

819
00:52:41,982 --> 00:52:46,282
He's bug-fucking crazy, man.
All the way live.

820
00:52:46,353 --> 00:52:48,287
So is the Man With The Plan,
Earl.

821
00:52:48,355 --> 00:52:51,756
They're all bug-fucking crazy. How do
you think they got to be big noises?

822
00:52:51,825 --> 00:52:53,759
o/ Kick back, relax
Watch us spin the wax o/

823
00:52:53,827 --> 00:52:57,024
o/ We'll never let 'em blow
'round no tracks o/

824
00:52:57,097 --> 00:52:59,065
- Baby inside?
- Yeah.

825
00:52:59,132 --> 00:53:00,997
Okay, let me see him.
I'm clean.

826
00:53:01,068 --> 00:53:04,003
What's happenin', man? You all set?

827
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:06,266
Okay. I owe you one.

828
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,002
o/ 'Cause there really
ain't much to say o/

829
00:53:09,076 --> 00:53:12,273
- o/ Except I got no- o/
- Okay, we're cool. Let's go.

830
00:53:12,346 --> 00:53:14,280
Come on.

831
00:53:21,355 --> 00:53:23,289
Damn.

832
00:53:24,858 --> 00:53:26,849
When your saviors look
like those motherfuckers,

833
00:53:26,927 --> 00:53:29,020
you know you done stepped
in it one time too many.

834
00:53:32,432 --> 00:53:35,458
Remember when you was a kid?
You'd spend the whole fuckin' year...

835
00:53:35,535 --> 00:53:39,471
waitin' for summer vacation, then it'd
finally come and just fly by just like that.

836
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:41,666
Mm-hmm.

837
00:53:41,742 --> 00:53:44,734
It's funny, Jimmy.

838
00:53:44,811 --> 00:53:49,373
Life has a way of passin' by faster
than any old summer vacation.

839
00:53:50,517 --> 00:53:53,486
It really fuckin' does.

840
00:53:55,288 --> 00:53:57,950
Give me a squeeze, big man.

841
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:05,721
Give me some.

842
00:54:08,468 --> 00:54:10,402
You're the man.

843
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:13,735
o/ I can drive lines in twos
and threes and fours o/

844
00:54:13,807 --> 00:54:15,741
o/ Just think how much is left
for encores o/

845
00:54:15,809 --> 00:54:18,505
o/ 'Cause when my mind locks in
on a dope idea o/

846
00:54:18,578 --> 00:54:21,069
o/ Motherfuckin' duck
She stand clear o/

847
00:54:21,148 --> 00:54:23,548
o/ 'Cause I'm the hip, the top
The point blank o/

848
00:54:23,617 --> 00:54:25,380
o/ Is true
You better keep your shank o/

849
00:54:25,452 --> 00:54:28,910
o/ 'Cause I got mine and I'm out
on the Soul Creek, uuh o/

850
00:54:28,989 --> 00:54:30,923
o/ Your face in the concrete o/

851
00:54:30,991 --> 00:54:32,925
o/ You wanna roll with
the niggers that don't play o/

852
00:54:32,993 --> 00:54:35,018
o/ I think you got false courage
Get up and dance o/oo/

853
00:54:35,095 --> 00:54:38,758
o/ Autumn meadows
melt in sunsets o/

854
00:54:38,832 --> 00:54:43,496
o/ My hair blowin'
in the breeze o/

855
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:46,403
o/ She can't
see me watchin' o/

856
00:54:46,473 --> 00:54:49,067
- What can I get you?
- Four beers, please.

857
00:54:49,142 --> 00:54:51,076
o/ And thinkin' o/

858
00:54:51,144 --> 00:55:05,554
o/ Love o/

859
00:55:08,295 --> 00:55:10,263
o/ It's bittersweet o/

860
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:13,299
- o/ And the sweet love- o/
- Jimmy!

861
00:55:23,443 --> 00:55:25,502
Where are you goin'?

862
00:55:28,215 --> 00:55:30,183
Got to meet a friend.

863
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:33,481
Oh.

864
00:55:37,591 --> 00:55:42,358
Who's that, uh, good-looking fella
you came in with? Is that Chip?

865
00:55:42,429 --> 00:55:45,262
Alex.

866
00:55:45,332 --> 00:55:49,996
There's a very endearing game-show-host
look to him. Does he have his own game show?

867
00:55:52,572 --> 00:55:54,563
Wanna go somewhere?

868
00:56:05,285 --> 00:56:07,913
1988.
It's a good year,

869
00:56:07,988 --> 00:56:10,354
I think.

870
00:56:10,423 --> 00:56:13,859
Is it the odd years,
or the even years?

871
00:56:13,927 --> 00:56:16,157
I don't know.

872
00:56:16,229 --> 00:56:18,754
- You don't know?
- No.

873
00:56:18,832 --> 00:56:22,199
Well, I thought
you knew everything.

874
00:56:22,269 --> 00:56:24,362
Uh-huh.

875
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,212
- Still ticking?
- Mm-hmm.

876
00:56:37,317 --> 00:56:39,251
Sorry.

877
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:43,680
Are you okay?

878
00:56:45,759 --> 00:56:48,956
Timing is everything.

879
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:51,088
What?

880
00:56:54,668 --> 00:56:57,159
You can go years
without a Dagney.

881
00:57:00,073 --> 00:57:04,009
You can be a man armed with
only a fork in a land of soup,

882
00:57:04,077 --> 00:57:06,136
and then one day
you meet one.

883
00:57:08,181 --> 00:57:10,149
And you see one.

884
00:57:12,586 --> 00:57:14,520
And then-

885
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:18,550
And then what?

886
00:57:28,201 --> 00:57:30,465
I gotta go.

887
00:57:31,538 --> 00:57:33,870
Now?

888
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,204
Yeah, now.

889
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:06,129
Sorry.

890
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:47,613
Olden?

891
00:58:49,182 --> 00:58:51,173
Hello, Jim.

892
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:00,184
Clever you.

893
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,353
Olden.

894
00:59:05,532 --> 00:59:07,625
How are you?

895
00:59:07,701 --> 00:59:09,726
- I'm all right.
- I see that.

896
00:59:09,803 --> 00:59:12,897
You seen Critical Bill around?

897
00:59:12,972 --> 00:59:16,669
- I can't find the man anywhere.
- Um, haven't seen him.

898
00:59:16,743 --> 00:59:19,712
Listen, I have
something for ya.

899
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,714
What's goin' on?

900
00:59:25,485 --> 00:59:27,544
Charter flight,
leaves in the morning.

901
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,145
- You got a layover in Rome.
- Ah, get outta here!

902
00:59:30,223 --> 00:59:34,023
The Greek islands. You'll be having
moussaka on Mykonos by dinner tomorrow night.

903
00:59:34,094 --> 00:59:37,154
- I-I don't think so, Jimmy.
- Hey, Olden, no more porn theaters,

904
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:39,630
no more scumbags
strokin' it around you.

905
00:59:39,699 --> 00:59:42,532
- The cool, blue waters of
the Mediterranean. - Ah, Jimmy-

906
00:59:42,602 --> 00:59:45,036
- What?
- I-I ain't gonna run.

907
00:59:45,105 --> 00:59:48,802
- What are you talkin' about, Olden?
- I been thinkin'.

908
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:54,211
- Olden, listen to me.
- I been thinkin' about this guy,

909
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:58,876
my neighbor next door
a few years ago, a citizen.

910
00:59:58,952 --> 01:00:04,015
Never married, no kids,
just a sweet guy.

911
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:08,026
And he got a cancer-
a bad one-

912
01:00:08,094 --> 01:00:10,119
and he was dyin'.

913
01:00:10,196 --> 01:00:13,188
I been thinkin' about him,

914
01:00:13,266 --> 01:00:16,064
thinkin' how
if in his last days...

915
01:00:16,136 --> 01:00:20,266
when he was layin' on the bed
starin' up at the ceiling...

916
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:23,207
in this shitty little
apartment...

917
01:00:23,276 --> 01:00:27,178
knowin' he was gonna die,

918
01:00:27,247 --> 01:00:30,148
was he sorry
he never did nothin'?

919
01:00:31,785 --> 01:00:35,050
Was he sorry he never
did the fox-trot...

920
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:37,817
with a $2,000-a-night
hooker...

921
01:00:37,891 --> 01:00:40,052
in a Paris nightclub?

922
01:00:42,362 --> 01:00:46,423
Jimmy, we did the things.

923
01:00:46,499 --> 01:00:49,593
Olden, I appreciate
what you're saying, but listen.

924
01:00:49,669 --> 01:00:51,933
I need you
on this island, man.

925
01:00:52,005 --> 01:00:54,064
Jimmy, Jimmy, uh-

926
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:59,339
- I need you there.
- I-I-I don't-

927
01:00:59,412 --> 01:01:02,347
I don't have any regrets.

928
01:01:02,415 --> 01:01:04,781
I'm not gonna stare up
at the ceiling.

929
01:01:04,851 --> 01:01:09,914
Maybe I coulda been
a better old man to my kids.

930
01:01:09,989 --> 01:01:12,958
Maybe I shouldn't have pulled
as much time as I did.

931
01:01:13,026 --> 01:01:15,654
But, shit, Jimmy,

932
01:01:15,728 --> 01:01:17,719
we did the things.

933
01:01:17,797 --> 01:01:20,357
Them days.

934
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:23,368
I had a snap-brim hat.

935
01:01:23,436 --> 01:01:27,566
You walk into a joint.
Ah! Forget about it.

936
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,871
Olden, I want you to take
this money, please.

937
01:01:30,944 --> 01:01:32,878
Take it.

938
01:01:32,946 --> 01:01:35,210
You keep it.

939
01:01:35,281 --> 01:01:37,408
You do something
good with it.

940
01:01:41,387 --> 01:01:44,117
I'm all right.

941
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:47,887
This is what I wanted
to tell you, Jim.

942
01:01:51,097 --> 01:01:53,930
- You all right?
- Ah.

943
01:01:55,668 --> 01:01:57,602
I'm okay.

944
01:02:00,206 --> 01:02:02,231
Well.

945
01:02:09,616 --> 01:02:11,584
Olden.

946
01:02:11,651 --> 01:02:17,089
Did you really do the fox-trot with a
$2,000-a-night hooker in a Paris nightclub?

947
01:02:17,991 --> 01:02:20,255
What do you think, Jimmy?

948
01:02:24,264 --> 01:02:27,290
Olden.

949
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:29,164
Boat drinks.

950
01:02:30,236 --> 01:02:32,295
Boat drinks, Jimmy.

951
01:02:36,409 --> 01:02:38,343
"Boat drinks. "

952
01:02:38,411 --> 01:02:40,345
That's a common toast
in prison.

953
01:02:40,413 --> 01:02:42,347
An ideal.

954
01:02:42,415 --> 01:02:45,248
Yeah, at the end of a long,
bad life, there you are...

955
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:49,186
on a big cabin cruiser
somewhere in the Florida keys...

956
01:02:49,255 --> 01:02:51,189
havin' boat drinks.

957
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,692
o/o/

958
01:02:56,763 --> 01:02:58,993
o/ Can't sleep o/

959
01:02:59,065 --> 01:03:02,592
- You seen Bill Dolittle around?
- No, man. I ain't seen nobody.

960
01:03:02,669 --> 01:03:06,036
- I don't know where he is.
- Where you runnin' off to?

961
01:03:06,105 --> 01:03:08,073
- Nowhere.
- Nowhere, huh?

962
01:03:08,141 --> 01:03:10,837
What's the matter with you?

963
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:13,936
Nothin'.
What's the matter with you?

964
01:03:14,013 --> 01:03:16,038
- Turn around.
- Why?

965
01:03:16,115 --> 01:03:18,083
- Turn around!
- Jimmy!

966
01:03:18,151 --> 01:03:20,085
- Turn around!
- There. Okay?

967
01:03:20,153 --> 01:03:23,350
Come here. Come here.

968
01:03:23,423 --> 01:03:26,256
- Let me see it.
- Fuck, man. What's it to you, anyway?

969
01:03:26,326 --> 01:03:28,317
You got a couple of dollars
for me today?

970
01:03:28,394 --> 01:03:30,692
Turn around. Let me see it.
The other way.

971
01:03:30,763 --> 01:03:32,697
- Don't fuck with me. Hey!
- Fuck, Jimmy!

972
01:03:32,765 --> 01:03:34,995
- Let me see it! What happened?
- There. Okay?

973
01:03:35,068 --> 01:03:38,834
- Fuck, nothing, all right? It's the same old fuckin' shit.
- What happened?

974
01:03:38,905 --> 01:03:41,874
It was a bad beat,
all right?

975
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:45,172
It's those fuckin' uptown
fuckin' motherfuckers.

976
01:03:45,244 --> 01:03:47,178
He's a regular.

977
01:03:47,246 --> 01:03:50,682
Guess he just kinda decided to have a
little party with a couple of beer bottles.

978
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:53,048
Oh, nice.
Beer bottles.

979
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,215
Look, I told him. I said, "Lucinda
doesn't fuckin' take no shit that way. "

980
01:03:57,290 --> 01:04:00,088
And he did
what he wanted and...

981
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:03,390
he took me out back and he alley-whipped
me, and that's what happened, okay?

982
01:04:03,463 --> 01:04:05,590
- And I'm fine.
- You happy with yourself?

983
01:04:05,665 --> 01:04:07,599
- An exciting life, isn't it?
- Hey, fuck you.

984
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:09,692
- Get in the fuckin' car. Get in the fuckin' car!
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

985
01:04:09,769 --> 01:04:13,068
- I don't need this fuckin' shit from-
- Get in the fuckin' car!

986
01:04:13,139 --> 01:04:16,131
Get in the car!
Get in the-

987
01:04:16,209 --> 01:04:18,234
Get in the fuckin' car.

988
01:04:18,311 --> 01:04:21,439
- Get in the car!
- One day I'm gonna fuckin' kill you, you know!

989
01:04:21,514 --> 01:04:25,109
- Get in the fucking car. Shut the fuck up.
- Okay, okay. Fuck you.

990
01:04:25,184 --> 01:04:27,118
What's his name?

991
01:04:27,186 --> 01:04:29,416
What is his name,
Lucinda?

992
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:32,583
- What is his name?
- I don't know.

993
01:04:32,658 --> 01:04:36,116
- You know where he works, and you don't know his name?
- I don't know his fucking name.

994
01:04:36,195 --> 01:04:38,595
Uh, where are
the accountants, please?

995
01:04:38,664 --> 01:04:41,258
- Um- - The accountants. I
need to see the accountants.

996
01:04:41,334 --> 01:04:44,997
- Where are they? - Uh, they're
down the ha- The- No. Hey, you can't-

997
01:04:45,071 --> 01:04:47,005
- You can't go down there!
- Fuckin' stop, Jimmy!

998
01:04:47,073 --> 01:04:50,372
- Is that him? Is that him?
- No!

999
01:04:53,346 --> 01:04:56,782
So this software package
can be applicable to all of your-

1000
01:04:56,849 --> 01:05:00,182
- What?
- Point him out.

1001
01:05:00,253 --> 01:05:03,450
- Point him out.
- He's that guy over there.

1002
01:05:03,523 --> 01:05:06,151
It's the blond guy.

1003
01:05:10,129 --> 01:05:12,324
- What is this?
- How are you?

1004
01:05:12,398 --> 01:05:14,491
What the hell are you-
Oh!

1005
01:05:16,702 --> 01:05:19,296
You liked it, huh?
Huh?

1006
01:05:21,374 --> 01:05:23,865
See that? See her?

1007
01:05:23,943 --> 01:05:27,606
Remember that girl? Do you remember
that girl? You remember her, right?

1008
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,148
You know what this maggot did to
that girl? Sit the fuck- Sit down!

1009
01:05:30,216 --> 01:05:32,275
Sit down!
Where are you going?

1010
01:05:32,351 --> 01:05:34,478
Huh? You wanna tell 'em
what you did?

1011
01:05:34,554 --> 01:05:36,522
Oh, my God.

1012
01:05:36,589 --> 01:05:38,750
Somebody get security on the phone.

1013
01:05:38,825 --> 01:05:41,851
He took a bottle-
not unlike this bottle, huh?

1014
01:05:41,928 --> 01:05:44,624
- I'm gonna get security.
- And he put this bottle in places...

1015
01:05:44,697 --> 01:05:46,631
where you're not supposed
to put bottles, huh?

1016
01:05:48,868 --> 01:05:52,565
How would you like it, huh? How would
you like it if I did it to you?

1017
01:05:52,638 --> 01:05:54,970
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Huh? How would you like...

1018
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:58,067
if I took this bottle
and shoved it up your ass?

1019
01:05:58,144 --> 01:06:01,841
- Every time you'd take a dump,
you'd need a nickel deposit!

1020
01:06:01,914 --> 01:06:04,041
- Come on, let's try it.
- Hey!

1021
01:06:04,117 --> 01:06:05,982
Jimmy! Jimmy!

1022
01:06:06,052 --> 01:06:07,917
- Come on. Come on.
- I've got him.

1023
01:06:07,987 --> 01:06:11,354
Come on, pal!
Come on! Move it out!

1024
01:06:11,424 --> 01:06:14,655
Let's say we take it outside.
- So he dropped the charges...

1025
01:06:14,727 --> 01:06:16,752
even though you
dogged him out like that.

1026
01:06:16,829 --> 01:06:20,663
Alternative would've been nastier. The
guy had a wife, a kid and a mistress.

1027
01:06:20,733 --> 01:06:24,191
Ooh, a wife and a mistress, huh?

1028
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:26,204
Those were the days,
eh, Jimmy?

1029
01:06:26,272 --> 01:06:28,536
Oh, shit.

1030
01:06:28,608 --> 01:06:29,768
Mooncalf alert.

1031
01:06:38,251 --> 01:06:41,778
Hey, Jimmy.

1032
01:06:41,854 --> 01:06:44,220
Jimmy the Saint.

1033
01:06:48,694 --> 01:06:52,323
Hey. Jimmy, you-

1034
01:06:52,398 --> 01:06:56,266
- Could I have a word with you for a minute?
- What's up, Bernard?

1035
01:06:56,335 --> 01:06:59,202
I mean,
i- in private, Jim.

1036
01:06:59,272 --> 01:07:01,433
No- No offense.

1037
01:07:06,846 --> 01:07:09,110
I'm very upset, Jimmy.

1038
01:07:09,182 --> 01:07:11,116
- I know that.
- Yeah.

1039
01:07:11,184 --> 01:07:15,120
- I heard about Meg.
- Oh, it's unbelievably sad. It's a heartbreaker, you know.

1040
01:07:15,188 --> 01:07:17,656
I mean, she's missing.

1041
01:07:17,723 --> 01:07:19,657
I mean, I don't know
what to do.

1042
01:07:19,725 --> 01:07:21,784
My letters come back,
"Return to Sender. "

1043
01:07:21,861 --> 01:07:25,456
I sent her flowers, right?
They came back dead.

1044
01:07:25,531 --> 01:07:29,262
Be patient.

1045
01:07:29,335 --> 01:07:31,269
She'll turn up.

1046
01:07:31,337 --> 01:07:34,738
Jimmy the Saint.

1047
01:07:36,943 --> 01:07:39,173
Look, I just need
some advice, you know?

1048
01:07:39,245 --> 01:07:41,475
I'm just-
Get on through it.

1049
01:07:41,547 --> 01:07:44,107
I mean,
I love her, Jim.

1050
01:07:45,184 --> 01:07:48,881
Hmm? I just
wanna talk to her.

1051
01:07:48,955 --> 01:07:52,914
I just want to hear her say,
"Bernard, I'm happy now.

1052
01:07:52,992 --> 01:07:56,359
I love this guy,
but I'm happy now. "

1053
01:07:56,429 --> 01:07:58,693
I mean, if I could
hear her say that,

1054
01:07:58,764 --> 01:08:01,289
I would get on
with the rest of my life.

1055
01:08:03,903 --> 01:08:08,772
See, her happiness is more important
to me than my happiness.

1056
01:08:08,841 --> 01:08:10,775
You understand?

1057
01:08:12,812 --> 01:08:16,009
I understand.
That's very noble of you.

1058
01:08:16,082 --> 01:08:18,016
Thank you.

1059
01:08:21,554 --> 01:08:25,615
She'll turn up, and you can talk to her
and tell her how you feel.

1060
01:08:25,691 --> 01:08:28,524
- Just be patient.
- Yeah.

1061
01:08:28,594 --> 01:08:30,528
You're right.

1062
01:08:32,164 --> 01:08:34,132
Thanks, Jimmy.

1063
01:08:35,468 --> 01:08:37,493
You know,

1064
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:39,902
I liked that thing
you said about bein' noble.

1065
01:08:39,972 --> 01:08:43,271
I could be noble.

1066
01:08:43,342 --> 01:08:46,743
I mean you,
you're noble.

1067
01:08:50,016 --> 01:08:51,950
I could be.

1068
01:08:53,786 --> 01:08:55,720
Hey.

1069
01:08:55,788 --> 01:08:58,814
You wanna go bowl a few strings
with me sometime?

1070
01:08:58,891 --> 01:09:01,917
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1071
01:09:01,994 --> 01:09:04,986
- You know "Diamond Mike" Ettlers?
- Yeah, I know him.

1072
01:09:05,064 --> 01:09:08,431
All-Strike Lanes?
From Brownville?

1073
01:09:08,501 --> 01:09:12,062
- Okay. I'll call you.
We'll bowl a few frames.

1074
01:09:12,138 --> 01:09:14,299
Great.

1075
01:09:14,373 --> 01:09:17,570
- Hey, that's great.
- Okay.

1076
01:09:18,644 --> 01:09:20,578
- Thanks, again.
- All right.

1077
01:09:20,646 --> 01:09:22,637
- Jimmy the Saint.
- All right.

1078
01:09:33,659 --> 01:09:37,959
I arranged this thing with Petey Weed for
you guys to go to Canada, if you want to.

1079
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:40,521
I got it.

1080
01:09:40,599 --> 01:09:43,625
I appreciate
what you're doin', Jimmy.

1081
01:09:43,703 --> 01:09:46,638
I really do, but I got
everything under control.

1082
01:09:46,706 --> 01:09:49,675
All right? Now, you oughta
get out of here yourself...

1083
01:09:49,742 --> 01:09:51,676
or you're gonna end up
terminal, man.

1084
01:09:51,744 --> 01:09:55,305
- I gotta find Bill first.
- Yeah, whatever.

1085
01:09:56,849 --> 01:09:59,511
Come here.

1086
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:08,293
Take this.

1087
01:10:09,729 --> 01:10:12,721
- What's that, your boat fund money?
- Take the money.

1088
01:10:12,798 --> 01:10:14,732
- I can't.
- Please.

1089
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,463
- No, Jimmy, I can't.
- I like it here.

1090
01:10:50,503 --> 01:10:52,471
Ah! Oh, baby!

1091
01:10:52,538 --> 01:10:55,507
I love it. Oh.
I love it.

1092
01:10:55,574 --> 01:10:58,065
You're so good to me.
You're so hard.

1093
01:10:58,144 --> 01:11:01,341
You're so strong,
make me so wet.

1094
01:11:01,414 --> 01:11:04,577
I love it.

1095
01:11:14,794 --> 01:11:17,194
I'm so-

1096
01:11:21,467 --> 01:11:23,662
Oh, God!

1097
01:11:57,002 --> 01:11:59,562
Do it quickly.

1098
01:12:04,276 --> 01:12:07,040
I love it.

1099
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:15,377
I-

1100
01:12:18,757 --> 01:12:21,248
Everybody stay together, now.

1101
01:12:25,865 --> 01:12:28,265
Ronald, come on.

1102
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:46,984
Are we having an affair?

1103
01:12:51,123 --> 01:12:53,523
What do you mean?

1104
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:57,085
You call me in the middle
of the afternoon...

1105
01:12:57,162 --> 01:13:01,030
and ask me to meet you
at the Natural History Museum.

1106
01:13:03,135 --> 01:13:05,729
Thanks for comin'.

1107
01:13:05,804 --> 01:13:08,967
o/o/

1108
01:13:09,041 --> 01:13:12,238
The fact of the matter
is by the year 2000,

1109
01:13:12,311 --> 01:13:14,245
every city will be black.

1110
01:13:14,313 --> 01:13:16,247
- The goddamn cities?
- That's right.

1111
01:13:16,315 --> 01:13:21,275
Thanks to the fax, the modem, the
conference call, Federal fuckin' Express,

1112
01:13:21,353 --> 01:13:24,845
the beast will be able to conduct
his business from his home...

1113
01:13:24,924 --> 01:13:30,089
in the white suburb, leavin' the city a
great wide war zone full of nuclear brothers.

1114
01:13:30,162 --> 01:13:32,392
So you're sayin', man,
the fax, modem, F.T.D.-

1115
01:13:32,464 --> 01:13:34,398
What the fuck you talkin'
about, "F.T.D."?

1116
01:13:34,466 --> 01:13:38,027
- You got to have flowers in the war zone, Baby.
- Hey. Man here to see you.

1117
01:13:38,103 --> 01:13:41,038
- Who's that?
- A fuckin' spooky-ass fuck.

1118
01:13:41,106 --> 01:13:43,370
Well, go find out
what he want, House.

1119
01:13:43,442 --> 01:13:45,376
The man says
he wants to see you.

1120
01:13:48,013 --> 01:13:52,973
- You definitely got some kind
of double-life thing happening.

1121
01:13:55,154 --> 01:13:57,088
Are you a gangster?

1122
01:13:58,490 --> 01:14:00,424
A gangster.

1123
01:14:01,493 --> 01:14:03,927
Do they still
have gangsters?

1124
01:14:03,996 --> 01:14:06,487
Yes.

1125
01:14:06,565 --> 01:14:09,659
"Jimmy the Saint" sounds
kind of gangsterish,

1126
01:14:09,735 --> 01:14:11,669
and you got
the slicked-back hair.

1127
01:14:11,737 --> 01:14:13,898
Hmm, always
a dead giveaway.

1128
01:14:13,973 --> 01:14:16,601
- Say, "You dirty rat. "
- What?

1129
01:14:16,675 --> 01:14:19,576
Say it. Go ahead.
"You dirty rat. "

1130
01:14:23,315 --> 01:14:25,408
You dirty rat.

1131
01:14:26,619 --> 01:14:30,487
Oh. No sale.

1132
01:14:30,556 --> 01:14:34,322
o/ I know the time's right, 'Cause chicks
be comin' on the blind side o/

1133
01:14:34,393 --> 01:14:36,554
o/ Never understood it
But remember I showed you o/

1134
01:14:36,629 --> 01:14:40,861
- o/ That in ideas you gotta look over your shoulder o/
- Boss.

1135
01:14:43,035 --> 01:14:45,230
I know you, Sylvester?

1136
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:50,936
Hey, turn that shit down.

1137
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:53,535
- o/o/
- I said, I know you?

1138
01:14:53,612 --> 01:14:55,944
- No.
- Then what the fuck you doin'...

1139
01:14:56,015 --> 01:14:58,142
comin' in my place
of leisure...

1140
01:14:58,217 --> 01:15:01,448
dressed like that,
frontin' me for a piece of ear?

1141
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,183
- I'm lookin' for Earl Denton.
- Oh, he lookin' for Earl Denton.

1142
01:15:05,257 --> 01:15:08,715
- Earl Denton.
- A.K.A. Easy Wind.

1143
01:15:08,794 --> 01:15:10,921
A.K.A. Easy Wind.

1144
01:15:10,996 --> 01:15:13,294
What the fuck?
You hear this boy?

1145
01:15:13,365 --> 01:15:17,563
- A.K.A. my dick, Uncle Salty.
- A.K.A. his dick, Uncle Salty.

1146
01:15:17,636 --> 01:15:19,934
I need to find Earl Denton.

1147
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:23,908
What are you
thinkin' about?

1148
01:15:26,712 --> 01:15:29,044
What are you
thinking about?

1149
01:15:30,883 --> 01:15:32,817
I asked you first.

1150
01:15:34,186 --> 01:15:36,450
I'm thinking
about getting married.

1151
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:44,127
Alex asked me
to marry him.

1152
01:15:44,196 --> 01:15:48,792
He did.

1153
01:15:48,867 --> 01:15:50,801
And what did you say?

1154
01:15:51,937 --> 01:15:54,428
I said
I'd think about it.

1155
01:15:58,110 --> 01:16:00,442
Are you in love?

1156
01:16:02,648 --> 01:16:06,084
Ladies and gentlemen, the museum
will be closing in five minutes.

1157
01:16:06,151 --> 01:16:09,746
Thank you for coming to the
Rocky Mountain Natural History Museum.

1158
01:16:10,823 --> 01:16:14,816
Hey, what'd you think?
Huh?

1159
01:16:14,893 --> 01:16:17,293
You think we're just
gonna give him up?

1160
01:16:17,362 --> 01:16:19,796
Hmm? Like I'm
your house nigger?

1161
01:16:19,865 --> 01:16:22,663
- Do he look like your house nigger, punk?
- Will you shut the fuck up...

1162
01:16:22,735 --> 01:16:24,669
for 11 seconds?

1163
01:16:24,737 --> 01:16:27,297
- That's cool. Go on.
- Please,

1164
01:16:27,372 --> 01:16:29,340
tell me where he is.

1165
01:16:29,408 --> 01:16:33,242
Cooperate
and no one gets hurt.

1166
01:16:39,184 --> 01:16:41,118
Say good-bye, bitch.

1167
01:16:42,521 --> 01:16:46,150
No, no, no, no.

1168
01:16:46,225 --> 01:16:48,625
Look at this shit! Come here!
- What's goin' on?

1169
01:16:48,694 --> 01:16:52,562
- Put- Put- Put the gun down, man.
- Shoot this motherfucker!

1170
01:16:52,631 --> 01:16:54,861
- Don't.
- You better let that motherfucker go!

1171
01:16:54,933 --> 01:16:57,299
Rooster, get this motherfucker
off of me!

1172
01:16:57,369 --> 01:17:01,499
- Fuck his ass up, House!
- You tell me where he is.

1173
01:17:01,573 --> 01:17:04,542
Motherfucker,
put the gun down!

1174
01:17:21,126 --> 01:17:23,151
Heh-heh! Oh, no, no.

1175
01:17:23,228 --> 01:17:25,196
See, that's not- No, you ain't-
It's cool.

1176
01:17:25,264 --> 01:17:28,324
It's- It's cool, man.
Just chill now.

1177
01:17:30,536 --> 01:17:32,470
A choice.

1178
01:17:32,538 --> 01:17:36,372
You could tell me where Earl Denton is,
or you could tell it to the worms.

1179
01:17:43,682 --> 01:17:46,913
- Jimmy?
- Hmm.

1180
01:17:46,985 --> 01:17:49,146
I been thinkin'.

1181
01:17:49,221 --> 01:17:52,987
There's this course.
It's massage therapy.

1182
01:17:53,058 --> 01:17:56,585
It's a 12-week program. When you
get out, you're a registered masseuse.

1183
01:17:56,662 --> 01:18:00,723
- I mean, boom, and I'm legit. I'm clean, just like that.
- Oh, just like that you're clean.

1184
01:18:00,799 --> 01:18:03,131
Yeah, just like that.

1185
01:18:03,202 --> 01:18:05,136
So I'm a masseuse.

1186
01:18:05,204 --> 01:18:10,665
I'm a citizen, and then I'm thinkin'-

1187
01:18:10,742 --> 01:18:14,769
Well, then, you never thought about
bein' a dad, have you?

1188
01:18:14,847 --> 01:18:16,940
- No.
- Never?

1189
01:18:17,015 --> 01:18:20,075
- Never.
- No?

1190
01:18:20,152 --> 01:18:23,144
'Cause I think
about bein' a mom a lot.

1191
01:18:23,222 --> 01:18:26,191
You know? I think
that it could, um-

1192
01:18:26,258 --> 01:18:28,852
Maybe it could get me
out of the life, you know?

1193
01:18:28,927 --> 01:18:32,795
Get me off the street,
maybe even... out of Denver.

1194
01:18:34,266 --> 01:18:38,600
I could go someplace warm,
where it's sunny all the time.

1195
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:41,764
- That'll be so cool.
- How you gonna support the kid?

1196
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,469
I don't know if anybody's told you,
but I.B.M.'s having a hiring freeze.

1197
01:18:45,544 --> 01:18:48,672
- I just told you.
- Massage therapy.

1198
01:18:48,747 --> 01:18:51,511
- Yeah, massage.
- You're gonna massage people.

1199
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:54,643
- Is it just me, or are you bein' a prick to me right now?
- I'm bein' a prick to you.

1200
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,018
- Yeah, that's what I thought.
- Why me?

1201
01:18:57,089 --> 01:18:59,455
- Why you?
- Yeah.

1202
01:19:01,026 --> 01:19:03,620
I don't know.

1203
01:19:03,695 --> 01:19:06,323
You're different, Jimmy.

1204
01:19:06,398 --> 01:19:08,798
And what you did today...

1205
01:19:08,867 --> 01:19:11,358
was like- God.

1206
01:19:12,905 --> 01:19:15,430
I mean,
you got some strength.

1207
01:19:15,507 --> 01:19:17,907
You got decency.

1208
01:19:17,976 --> 01:19:20,206
You know?

1209
01:19:20,279 --> 01:19:23,680
And you got a, mmm, beautiful ass.

1210
01:19:23,749 --> 01:19:26,684
Well, who needs strength and decency
when you have a nice ass?

1211
01:19:26,752 --> 01:19:28,686
Exactly. So,

1212
01:19:28,754 --> 01:19:30,688
like, I'm ovulating
right now.

1213
01:19:30,756 --> 01:19:33,953
We could do it. We could make it work.

1214
01:19:34,026 --> 01:19:37,223
- Right now you're ov- Right here.
- Right here if you want, baby.

1215
01:19:39,831 --> 01:19:44,165
What do ya think? I only got
two days, though. Two days.

1216
01:19:44,236 --> 01:19:48,002
Then I have to wait
a whole 'nother month.

1217
01:19:48,073 --> 01:19:50,064
What do you say, Jimmy?

1218
01:19:55,847 --> 01:19:58,680
Hey, Malt.

1219
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:01,719
Lucinda wants my baby.
Should I give her the seed?

1220
01:20:01,787 --> 01:20:04,051
That's just what
this world needs,

1221
01:20:04,122 --> 01:20:07,819
the unholy offspring
of you two beggar-smashers.

1222
01:20:07,893 --> 01:20:11,590
That kid'd be the Antichrist,
I tell ya that.

1223
01:20:11,663 --> 01:20:15,724
- Six-six-six all over his body.
- Yeah? What do you know?

1224
01:20:15,801 --> 01:20:19,328
You're just a soda jerk,
the emphasis on jerk.

1225
01:20:19,404 --> 01:20:22,999
- That's a funny one, Lucinda.
I never heard that one.

1226
01:20:24,242 --> 01:20:27,006
What are you still doin' here?

1227
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:29,138
They killed Olden.

1228
01:20:32,317 --> 01:20:36,344
- When? What happened?
- Tonight at the theater, man. They put one in his heart.

1229
01:20:36,421 --> 01:20:39,584
Only good thing was, he was...
dead before he hit the ground.

1230
01:20:44,429 --> 01:20:46,522
Shit.

1231
01:20:46,598 --> 01:20:49,965
What? What?

1232
01:20:50,035 --> 01:20:53,004
Just, uh, for a man that's got
a buckwheats hit on him, Jimmy,

1233
01:20:53,071 --> 01:20:55,130
you seem awful relaxed
in there, drinkin' a shake.

1234
01:20:55,207 --> 01:20:58,108
What is that supposed
to mean?

1235
01:20:58,176 --> 01:21:00,144
What are you saying,
Franny?

1236
01:21:00,212 --> 01:21:02,578
Fuck the Man. Whatever.
It's none of my business.

1237
01:21:02,647 --> 01:21:06,549
Yeah, I'm gonna be puttin' him on,
gotta get outta here.

1238
01:21:06,618 --> 01:21:08,552
Good luck, man.

1239
01:21:13,825 --> 01:21:15,759
Gotta go.

1240
01:21:17,429 --> 01:21:19,226
Hey!

1241
01:21:19,297 --> 01:21:22,460
Jimmy! Where ya
going to, a fire?

1242
01:21:24,236 --> 01:21:28,366
We had some
pretty good times there, huh?

1243
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:33,104
Easy. It's a grievous error
to still be here, Jim.

1244
01:21:41,953 --> 01:21:45,753
You're still here, Jimmy.
You're still in Denver.

1245
01:21:45,824 --> 01:21:49,954
Why don't you just walk over and spit
a green louie into my crippled face?

1246
01:21:50,028 --> 01:21:54,692
'Cause your still being here
is the equal of, I think, just that.

1247
01:21:54,766 --> 01:21:57,963
I'm leaving town. I'm already gone. I
wanna talk to you about Francis Chiser.

1248
01:21:58,036 --> 01:22:00,596
What about him?
Slower!

1249
01:22:00,672 --> 01:22:02,765
Rub slower.

1250
01:22:03,942 --> 01:22:06,035
You gotta call off your men
off of Chiser.

1251
01:22:06,111 --> 01:22:09,672
- I gotta?
- It would be good of you to call your men off of Chiser.

1252
01:22:09,748 --> 01:22:14,242
He's got a family. He's got
three kids, and he's got a wife.

1253
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:17,345
He won't be in your face.
He'll disappear. I guarantee it.

1254
01:22:17,422 --> 01:22:21,483
Disappear?
Like Easy Earl Denton disappeared?

1255
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:25,826
- What do you mean?
- It was a good play, Jim, but the niggers gave him up.

1256
01:22:25,897 --> 01:22:30,027
He was shot. Five bullets.

1257
01:22:30,102 --> 01:22:34,835
- He's gone, Jim.
First Pieces, now Easy Wind.

1258
01:22:34,906 --> 01:22:36,874
Took 20 minutes to die.

1259
01:22:36,942 --> 01:22:41,140
- Suffered like you would
not fuckin' believe.

1260
01:22:41,213 --> 01:22:45,206
You gonna stay here and die, Jimmy, like a
fuckin' dog in the street, like Easy Wind?

1261
01:22:45,283 --> 01:22:48,116
Bullet up the ass,
you don't die for 20 minutes.

1262
01:22:48,186 --> 01:22:52,316
We'll just talk about Francis.
He's got a family. He's got kids.

1263
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:55,382
I'd trade the memories of childhood...

1264
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:58,293
just to stroke
this girl's stomach.

1265
01:22:58,363 --> 01:23:00,695
The sense of touch
is easily...

1266
01:23:00,765 --> 01:23:04,201
the most underappreciated
of the five senses.

1267
01:23:07,139 --> 01:23:09,107
Okay.

1268
01:23:09,174 --> 01:23:12,109
Just so's he disappears.

1269
01:23:12,177 --> 01:23:15,476
He's got a family.
He's got three kids. They need him.

1270
01:23:16,815 --> 01:23:19,113
And you! Follow him.

1271
01:23:19,184 --> 01:23:21,744
Be gone, Jim. Fuckin' gone.

1272
01:23:43,608 --> 01:23:49,205
Joe, it's me, Jimmy.
Any luck finding Bill?

1273
01:23:49,281 --> 01:23:53,775
Yeah. Lou Brophy?
Okay.

1274
01:23:53,852 --> 01:23:57,083
Yeah. I'm ready.

1275
01:23:59,124 --> 01:24:01,058
Bye.

1276
01:24:17,042 --> 01:24:20,034
You're leaving tomorrow.

1277
01:24:22,147 --> 01:24:24,342
And you're not coming back.

1278
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:26,543
Am I right?

1279
01:24:30,622 --> 01:24:32,749
I could send for you.

1280
01:24:44,603 --> 01:24:46,764
Will you teach me
to ski?

1281
01:24:47,839 --> 01:24:49,773
Huh?

1282
01:24:53,445 --> 01:24:55,379
Nothin'.

1283
01:25:42,127 --> 01:25:45,096
Who's there?

1284
01:25:48,133 --> 01:25:53,332
- Billy, it's me, Jimmy.
I'm alone. Open up.

1285
01:25:53,405 --> 01:25:57,671
All right, Jimmy.

1286
01:25:59,711 --> 01:26:01,645
It's okay.

1287
01:26:09,854 --> 01:26:11,879
How'd you find me?

1288
01:26:14,626 --> 01:26:17,254
Billy,

1289
01:26:17,329 --> 01:26:19,957
what the fuck
are you doin', man?

1290
01:26:20,031 --> 01:26:23,262
He comes a-callin',
I'll be ready.

1291
01:26:36,481 --> 01:26:38,972
When was the last time
you went out, Bill?

1292
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:43,419
Couple of days ago.
I quit workin' at Carlotti's.

1293
01:26:43,488 --> 01:26:46,048
You sleep at all?

1294
01:26:46,124 --> 01:26:48,183
I been up
for four days straight.

1295
01:26:48,259 --> 01:26:50,625
Keeps you alert,
fine-tuned.

1296
01:26:54,399 --> 01:26:57,698
Billy, why don't we go out
and get something to eat?

1297
01:26:59,037 --> 01:27:01,938
I'm not real keen
on leavin' here.

1298
01:27:02,006 --> 01:27:04,474
- You hungry?
- No.

1299
01:27:04,542 --> 01:27:08,410
- 'Cause I could fix you up somethin'. You sure?
- No.

1300
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,414
I got beans.

1301
01:27:10,482 --> 01:27:14,179
Ah, I got corn.
I got... spinach.

1302
01:27:14,252 --> 01:27:16,413
It's all free.

1303
01:27:16,488 --> 01:27:19,582
Ahh. I got beef stew.

1304
01:27:19,657 --> 01:27:23,149
- You want me to fix you up some beef stew, some hard roll?
- No. No.

1305
01:27:23,228 --> 01:27:25,162
Thanks. It's okay.

1306
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:28,461
All right. Okay.

1307
01:27:28,533 --> 01:27:31,263
Jimmy, you know, I'm-

1308
01:27:31,336 --> 01:27:33,702
I'm glad you found me, man,
because I-I been-

1309
01:27:33,772 --> 01:27:35,865
I been wantin'
to talk to you.

1310
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:37,874
You know-

1311
01:27:41,212 --> 01:27:46,912
I been wantin' to apologize
to you, Jimmy, about that-

1312
01:27:46,985 --> 01:27:49,920
what happened out on the highway
the other night?

1313
01:27:49,988 --> 01:27:52,013
You know, man, I just-

1314
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:56,288
Well, I kinda lost my shit
out there, ya know?

1315
01:27:56,361 --> 01:27:59,956
But, damn, Jimmy, it was
kind of irresponsible of you...

1316
01:28:00,031 --> 01:28:03,262
to put me out on point
in the first place, ya know?

1317
01:28:03,334 --> 01:28:06,735
When you think about it,
it really was sorta your fault.

1318
01:28:06,805 --> 01:28:09,569
I mean, everybody knows...

1319
01:28:09,641 --> 01:28:12,303
I'm out of my tits.

1320
01:28:20,485 --> 01:28:24,046
Bill, I went to see
Red the lawyer.

1321
01:28:24,122 --> 01:28:28,320
- Mexico City.
- I ain't goin' nowhere, Jim.

1322
01:28:28,393 --> 01:28:30,384
They can send
who they want to send,

1323
01:28:30,462 --> 01:28:34,057
- I will fuck them up five days from Tuesday.
- Billy, listen to me.

1324
01:28:34,132 --> 01:28:37,192
Listen, the Man With The Plan's just a
fuckin' head. Ya ever think about that?

1325
01:28:37,268 --> 01:28:42,103
We all bow and cower and run chicken
from some fuckin' head!

1326
01:28:42,173 --> 01:28:44,403
Well, no more, Jimmy.

1327
01:28:44,476 --> 01:28:46,774
My new motto:
Fuck the head!

1328
01:28:46,845 --> 01:28:48,779
Ha! You like that?

1329
01:28:48,847 --> 01:28:50,781
Fuck the head!

1330
01:28:50,849 --> 01:28:53,716
Yeah, man!

1331
01:28:53,785 --> 01:28:56,913
Fuck the head.

1332
01:28:58,356 --> 01:29:00,984
They got Easy Wind, Bill.

1333
01:29:03,027 --> 01:29:05,621
I know. Easy Wind.

1334
01:29:05,697 --> 01:29:09,656
He was a fuck, but...

1335
01:29:09,734 --> 01:29:13,431
I kinda liked him anyhow.

1336
01:29:13,505 --> 01:29:17,271
When he started roundin' me on that
"fecal freak" stuff, it was lies, man.

1337
01:29:17,342 --> 01:29:20,402
- I know.
- I mean, not lies like you think, Jimmy.

1338
01:29:20,478 --> 01:29:23,743
Not out-and-out lies.
I mean, I ain't no brown boy.

1339
01:29:23,815 --> 01:29:27,615
- There was this one time. Marion in
the fuckin' basement. - Billy, you don't-

1340
01:29:27,685 --> 01:29:31,177
- I don't wanna hear about it.
- Especially in the basement, you got to prove yourself.

1341
01:29:31,256 --> 01:29:35,283
You don't, you're hosed. This one scale
offered me five centuries to do it.

1342
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,453
To do what, Bill?

1343
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:40,991
Eat it, man.

1344
01:29:41,065 --> 01:29:43,124
Not a lot. Just a-
Just a little piece.

1345
01:29:43,201 --> 01:29:46,796
- I don't want to hear about this.
- I'm sayin' Easy Wind is a lyin' moon cricket,

1346
01:29:46,871 --> 01:29:51,240
but maybe on this one he wasn't really
lyin', 'cause I did it for a small nickel.

1347
01:29:51,309 --> 01:29:53,504
See- See,
he leaves that part out.

1348
01:29:53,578 --> 01:29:58,982
Five yards, man, and it was
only a little bitty piece of shit.

1349
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:03,714
I mean, it didn't really
have no taste, either.

1350
01:30:03,788 --> 01:30:06,552
- Spongy.
- Jesus, Bill! Come on!

1351
01:30:06,624 --> 01:30:10,583
Well, it don't make me no fecal freak. Give
me some geezo juice around the basement...

1352
01:30:10,662 --> 01:30:12,596
and five yards,
and what the fuck, Jimmy?

1353
01:30:12,664 --> 01:30:15,428
- You might do it yourself.
- That's right. I might do it myself.

1354
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:19,300
I'm sayin' Easy Wind shouldn't oughta go
sayin' shit like that without, uh, uh-

1355
01:30:19,370 --> 01:30:24,103
- Qualifying it.
- Qualifying it. That's right, Jim. Without qualifying it.

1356
01:30:24,175 --> 01:30:26,166
That nigger's
just a trash mouth.

1357
01:30:26,244 --> 01:30:28,235
I'll tell you what.

1358
01:30:28,313 --> 01:30:32,079
He'll get himself killed
if he don't watch out.

1359
01:30:34,752 --> 01:30:37,516
Sure you don't want
somethin' to eat?

1360
01:30:37,589 --> 01:30:39,614
I gotta go, Bill.

1361
01:30:40,992 --> 01:30:43,654
- And when you're 70,
- Boat drinks.

1362
01:30:43,728 --> 01:30:47,357
you realize
that life is nonsense.

1363
01:30:47,432 --> 01:30:49,400
In the grand scheme
of things, uh,

1364
01:30:49,467 --> 01:30:52,061
one life is nothing.

1365
01:30:52,136 --> 01:30:55,572
One life is a...
mustard burp:

1366
01:30:55,640 --> 01:31:00,202
momentarily tangy,
then forgotten in the air.

1367
01:31:42,453 --> 01:31:44,614
o/ Mustang Sally o/

1368
01:31:48,793 --> 01:31:52,285
o/ Guess you'd better
slow your Mustang o/

1369
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:03,207
o/ Mustang Sally, baby o/

1370
01:32:03,274 --> 01:32:06,710
Unh! God! Jesus!
Jesus!

1371
01:32:06,778 --> 01:32:09,042
You like that, huh?

1372
01:32:09,113 --> 01:32:12,674
- What the fuck are you doin', Tosnia?
- Why are you followin' the girl?

1373
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:14,843
- Why are you followin'- You're a cop.
- I'm a cop!

1374
01:32:14,919 --> 01:32:18,980
- Talk to me, you shit! Why are you following the girl?
- Fuck you!

1375
01:32:20,491 --> 01:32:23,187
This girl had nothin' to do with this,
you understand me?

1376
01:32:23,261 --> 01:32:25,695
She has nothing to do
with this. I'm done,

1377
01:32:25,763 --> 01:32:29,130
but if you just fucking go near
that girl, if you fuckin' go near her,

1378
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,498
if she fuckin' stubs her toe
and you're in the same zip code as her,

1379
01:32:31,569 --> 01:32:33,503
I'm gonna come after you,
my friend!

1380
01:32:33,571 --> 01:32:36,597
You! You'll be wearing a
flag-draped coffin, you understand me?

1381
01:32:36,674 --> 01:32:39,302
Stay the fuck away
from her!

1382
01:32:39,377 --> 01:32:44,007
Ya hear me on this?
Stay the fuck away from her.

1383
01:32:44,082 --> 01:32:47,347
Hey, I got a better
question for you.

1384
01:32:47,418 --> 01:32:51,286
What's ugly, tattooed and just got
sliced up like provolone?

1385
01:32:53,324 --> 01:32:57,818
- What?
- No! Let me go! Let me go!

1386
01:32:57,895 --> 01:32:59,920
No!

1387
01:33:06,604 --> 01:33:09,801
Unh!

1388
01:33:13,945 --> 01:33:17,108
- Choo-choo?
- Choo-choo. Or airplane.

1389
01:33:17,181 --> 01:33:19,115
- Choo-choo. Airplane?
- Oh, let's do airplane.

1390
01:33:21,552 --> 01:33:24,077
That's enough of that one.

1391
01:33:25,957 --> 01:33:29,154
- Get the fuck in there.
- Jimmy Tos.

1392
01:33:30,762 --> 01:33:34,061
That's enough, sweetie.
Take the night off.

1393
01:33:34,132 --> 01:33:36,225
Go home. Rent a video.

1394
01:33:39,904 --> 01:33:44,102
What the fuck did you do
to my Irish mallet, Jimmy?

1395
01:33:44,175 --> 01:33:46,769
- Looks terrible.
- You gave me your word on Franchise.

1396
01:33:46,844 --> 01:33:49,608
Oh, yeah.
Gave you my word.

1397
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:51,807
Gee whiz. Well,
Jimmy, don't you see?

1398
01:33:51,883 --> 01:33:54,078
I'm a criminal.
My word don't mean dick.

1399
01:33:54,152 --> 01:33:58,919
You gave me your word. Your word!
Your word, you gave me the other day!

1400
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:03,586
- You gave me your word.
- o/o/

1401
01:34:07,131 --> 01:34:10,589
I met someone.
I met a girl.

1402
01:34:10,668 --> 01:34:13,865
I'm asking you:
I don't want her hurt.

1403
01:34:13,938 --> 01:34:19,535
I heard she's lovely. Maybe we'll
get her in here, dance for the boys.

1404
01:34:21,913 --> 01:34:25,076
- Jimmy! Jimmy!
- Ooh.

1405
01:34:25,149 --> 01:34:28,141
Get the fuck off me.

1406
01:34:29,487 --> 01:34:31,853
Jim! That's enough!

1407
01:34:34,792 --> 01:34:38,057
Ah, Jim! Jim!
Come on, here.

1408
01:34:38,129 --> 01:34:40,723
- Jimmy, for God's-
- Let me go. Let me go.

1409
01:34:40,798 --> 01:34:43,733
- Let me go!
- Come here!

1410
01:34:43,801 --> 01:34:45,826
You crippled fuck!

1411
01:34:47,839 --> 01:34:50,307
All right. All right. He's all right.

1412
01:34:50,374 --> 01:34:52,535
He's all right.
He's all right.

1413
01:34:52,610 --> 01:34:55,135
He's all right.
I know him.

1414
01:34:55,213 --> 01:34:57,204
He's a friend.

1415
01:35:01,319 --> 01:35:03,412
I love this new
tough-guy thing, Jim.

1416
01:35:03,487 --> 01:35:05,978
Very exciting.
Now get on your knees.

1417
01:35:06,057 --> 01:35:08,321
- What?
- Get on your knees.

1418
01:35:08,392 --> 01:35:12,351
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause I got pressure sores, Jim.

1419
01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:15,957
They leak pus.
Now get on your knees.

1420
01:35:16,033 --> 01:35:18,228
- No.
- o/o/

1421
01:35:19,737 --> 01:35:22,069
Uuh!

1422
01:35:22,139 --> 01:35:24,266
Good.

1423
01:35:28,779 --> 01:35:30,713
- Get on your belly.
- Gaah-

1424
01:35:30,781 --> 01:35:34,649
- I'm not gonna beg.
- Get on your fuckin' belly, Jim,

1425
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:38,621
before I send the boys out with 30 vials
of rock and your quim's address.

1426
01:35:38,689 --> 01:35:41,988
They round up eight
crackhead niggers...

1427
01:35:42,059 --> 01:35:44,220
who gang-rape her
if they want to pipe up.

1428
01:35:44,295 --> 01:35:47,856
- Now, get on your fuckin' belly.
- No.

1429
01:35:47,932 --> 01:35:51,095
- Aah!
- Beg for your life, Jim.

1430
01:35:51,168 --> 01:35:53,932
- I beg I die!
- Beg, you fuck!

1431
01:35:54,005 --> 01:35:55,973
- Beg, asshole.
- No.

1432
01:35:56,040 --> 01:36:01,137
Beg me or I'll let you suck my dead dick
in return for your life.

1433
01:36:01,212 --> 01:36:04,807
- No. -
Beg! - Beg.

1434
01:36:04,882 --> 01:36:06,179
- No!
- Beg, fuck!

1435
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:09,481
- No!
- Take out my dick.

1436
01:36:09,553 --> 01:36:11,077
- Wha-
- Huh?

1437
01:36:11,155 --> 01:36:15,114
Atwater, take it out.

1438
01:36:15,192 --> 01:36:17,820
Take it out!
Take it out!

1439
01:36:22,633 --> 01:36:24,965
Oh, please,
I don't want her hurt.

1440
01:36:31,709 --> 01:36:33,643
You scumbag.

1441
01:36:33,711 --> 01:36:36,509
Didn't you learn
nothing from me?

1442
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:40,346
Never beg.
Never, ever fuckin' beg.

1443
01:36:40,418 --> 01:36:42,978
Now I gotta
buckwheats you, Jim.

1444
01:36:43,054 --> 01:36:45,750
Go to Switzerland,
go to China,

1445
01:36:45,823 --> 01:36:47,791
go to the Washington
fuckin' Zoo,

1446
01:36:47,858 --> 01:36:49,826
but an example's
gotta be made.

1447
01:36:49,894 --> 01:36:53,421
And if your bangtail's
with you- if Miss Dagney Krofft,

1448
01:36:53,497 --> 01:36:56,466
ski instructor at Vail-
if she's with you,

1449
01:36:56,534 --> 01:36:59,799
then she goes too...
10 minutes before you...

1450
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:03,135
so's you gotta watch her,
you gotta watch her drain.

1451
01:37:03,207 --> 01:37:05,334
- Huh?
- Aah!

1452
01:37:05,409 --> 01:37:08,708
Or... maybe not.

1453
01:37:08,779 --> 01:37:11,247
Maybe I decide to be
a stand-up guy,

1454
01:37:11,315 --> 01:37:13,681
forget the whole thing.

1455
01:37:13,751 --> 01:37:17,710
Or buckwheats, or maybe
b- b-b-buckwheats, buckwheats.

1456
01:37:17,788 --> 01:37:19,722
Or no.

1457
01:37:21,959 --> 01:37:24,086
Live with that.

1458
01:37:24,161 --> 01:37:27,756
And the fun part, the real
shit-and-giggles part is...

1459
01:37:27,832 --> 01:37:30,266
you ain't never gonna
know what I decide...

1460
01:37:30,334 --> 01:37:32,825
'til you're staring
at your guts...

1461
01:37:35,406 --> 01:37:37,397
on the wall.

1462
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:48,584
- Shit!

1463
01:38:34,065 --> 01:38:35,999
Boat drinks, Malt.

1464
01:38:36,067 --> 01:38:38,001
- You all right, Jimmy?

1465
01:38:38,069 --> 01:38:40,094
- Boat drinks, Joe.
- o/ Latch on- o/

1466
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,374
o/ Don't mess
with Mister In-Between o/

1467
01:38:44,442 --> 01:38:47,138
Ah, he's got a lot on his mind.

1468
01:38:47,211 --> 01:38:50,806
What'd you say your name
was again, friend?

1469
01:40:13,697 --> 01:40:16,063
Par-tay!

1470
01:40:18,169 --> 01:40:20,899
I am Godzilla!

1471
01:40:20,971 --> 01:40:24,407
You are Japan!

1472
01:40:28,145 --> 01:40:32,411
Your reputation far exceeds
your skills, mammy rammer.

1473
01:41:02,246 --> 01:41:04,305
"Blood runs when the time comes. "

1474
01:41:04,381 --> 01:41:06,679
The first rule of the life.

1475
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:09,218
"The blood runs
when the time comes. "

1476
01:41:10,554 --> 01:41:15,287
Just because Mr. Shush is gone,
it don't mean shit.

1477
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:18,055
I hear he already
made a call.

1478
01:41:18,128 --> 01:41:22,497
The Mantirez brothers out of Albuquerque
have been called in.

1479
01:41:22,566 --> 01:41:27,333
"Assassinos locos. "

1480
01:41:42,486 --> 01:41:45,478
- Hi, baby.
- Jimmy, what happened to your face?

1481
01:41:45,556 --> 01:41:47,490
It's okay.

1482
01:41:47,558 --> 01:41:50,550
- Alex, how are ya?
- Ah, this is the guy, right?

1483
01:41:51,929 --> 01:41:54,363
- Yes, I'm the guy.
- Yeah.

1484
01:41:54,431 --> 01:41:56,558
Jimmy, what are you
doing here?

1485
01:41:56,634 --> 01:41:59,501
I have a favor
to ask.

1486
01:41:59,570 --> 01:42:02,630
o/ I thought that trouble
was my only friend o/

1487
01:42:02,706 --> 01:42:04,867
I bought this ring.

1488
01:42:04,942 --> 01:42:06,933
It's a good ring.

1489
01:42:08,812 --> 01:42:12,145
It's in your color. It's perfect.
I'd like you to give it to Dagney.

1490
01:42:12,216 --> 01:42:14,684
You, uh-

1491
01:42:14,752 --> 01:42:17,220
You wanna buy my engagement ring
for Dagney.

1492
01:42:17,288 --> 01:42:19,347
I bought your engagement ring
for Dagney.

1493
01:42:19,423 --> 01:42:21,516
Give her the ring, please.

1494
01:42:21,592 --> 01:42:23,583
- Jimmy, don't do this.
- Please. Please.

1495
01:42:23,661 --> 01:42:25,754
You don't think that
that's a little odd?

1496
01:42:25,829 --> 01:42:28,127
- Please take the ring.
- Dagney.

1497
01:42:28,198 --> 01:42:30,325
Open your heart
and take the ring.

1498
01:42:30,401 --> 01:42:31,698
- Take the ring.
- Don't do this.

1499
01:42:31,769 --> 01:42:35,261
- Is that what you want, Dagney?
- Take the ring.

1500
01:42:35,339 --> 01:42:39,173
Take the ring. Take the ring!
Take the ring!

1501
01:42:41,145 --> 01:42:43,340
What the hell
are you doing?

1502
01:42:43,414 --> 01:42:45,473
Sorry.

1503
01:42:45,549 --> 01:42:47,847
Look, I don't even
like you anymore, Jimmy!

1504
01:42:47,918 --> 01:42:51,513
You swept through here
talking the talk,

1505
01:42:51,588 --> 01:42:53,783
and ever since then
I don't know what's what.

1506
01:42:53,857 --> 01:42:55,791
You know what's what?

1507
01:42:55,859 --> 01:42:58,657
I'm just like all the others.
I just need you more than the others.

1508
01:42:58,729 --> 01:43:01,960
The other night, you were telling me
you were on the brink of an exception.

1509
01:43:02,032 --> 01:43:04,728
You know how many people out there
want a shot at bringing you paradise,

1510
01:43:04,802 --> 01:43:06,929
that want to spend the rest
of their days with you?

1511
01:43:07,004 --> 01:43:09,199
- You're doing the talking thing again!
- And I want to do that, see,

1512
01:43:09,273 --> 01:43:11,537
but I can't do it,
and I want to do that so badly.

1513
01:43:11,608 --> 01:43:13,769
Why? Just tell me why.

1514
01:43:13,844 --> 01:43:17,712
I'm dying. I went to see a doctor.
He tells me I'm dying.

1515
01:43:17,781 --> 01:43:21,444
He tells me I have to give
you back to all the others.

1516
01:43:21,518 --> 01:43:23,986
Dying? What do you mean,
you're dying?

1517
01:43:24,054 --> 01:43:28,821
Dagney, listen.
I really have to go. I'm- I'm-

1518
01:43:28,892 --> 01:43:33,852
I'm gonna cry here in the middle of Silver
Naked Lady, and it's bad for my reputation.

1519
01:43:33,931 --> 01:43:36,593
I love you.
You know that.

1520
01:43:36,667 --> 01:43:40,763
And I know if I'd had a chance to take possession
of your soul, I would have made it smile.

1521
01:43:40,838 --> 01:43:42,897
Don't cry.

1522
01:43:42,973 --> 01:43:45,498
- o/ Have a bad love o/
- o/ Bad love o/

1523
01:43:52,383 --> 01:43:54,783
- o/ Have a bad love o/
- o/ Bad love o/

1524
01:44:23,714 --> 01:44:25,648
Hey, Jimmy.

1525
01:44:25,716 --> 01:44:28,844
Well, how are you?

1526
01:44:28,919 --> 01:44:32,286
- Hey, did you wanna bowl?
- You need a ride, Bernard.

1527
01:44:32,356 --> 01:44:35,382
Gus and Ellie are supposed
to pick me up. You know, they always-

1528
01:44:35,459 --> 01:44:38,587
- I know.
- They're always late.

1529
01:44:41,231 --> 01:44:44,564
I'll come aboard with you.
What the hell. Sure. Huh?

1530
01:44:44,635 --> 01:44:47,604
Serve them guys right
for bein' tardy.

1531
01:44:49,273 --> 01:44:51,332
What happened to you?

1532
01:44:51,408 --> 01:44:53,342
Come on, let's go.

1533
01:45:17,501 --> 01:45:19,867
Somethin' wrong?

1534
01:45:19,937 --> 01:45:22,201
Yes.

1535
01:45:26,810 --> 01:45:29,472
Ugh.

1536
01:45:34,852 --> 01:45:37,252
Aw, s-

1537
01:46:24,501 --> 01:46:26,435
Lucinda.

1538
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:32,436
Hey, Jimmy.
What's up?

1539
01:46:35,312 --> 01:46:37,246
Get in the car.

1540
01:46:43,887 --> 01:46:48,256
What happened to you?
What happened to you?

1541
01:46:52,329 --> 01:46:55,389
It's gonna be
a beautiful baby, Jimmy.

1542
01:47:00,170 --> 01:47:02,570
Most of all,
you're gonna have to remember...

1543
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:04,698
it's not gonna be
a perfect world.

1544
01:47:05,809 --> 01:47:08,505
It's gonna be harder
than Chinese math.

1545
01:47:11,014 --> 01:47:13,278
But as cold as it's
gonna seem sometimes,

1546
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:17,013
you must have... faith.

1547
01:47:18,789 --> 01:47:21,314
- Jimmy?
- Gotta have faith.

1548
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,292
Have a list-

1549
01:47:25,362 --> 01:47:27,626
Come up with a list...

1550
01:47:27,698 --> 01:47:29,791
of what's
important to you.

1551
01:47:30,968 --> 01:47:34,062
The ten most important
things to you.

1552
01:47:34,137 --> 01:47:36,264
Write 'em down.

1553
01:47:37,608 --> 01:47:41,009
No one can satisfy all ten.
It's impossible.

1554
01:47:41,078 --> 01:47:44,980
If you can satisfy five or six,
you're nearly there.

1555
01:47:45,048 --> 01:47:47,414
You're on your way, kid,
to your own perfect world.

1556
01:47:54,091 --> 01:47:57,185
It's important
that you listen to your mother.

1557
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:02,764
She's a fine woman,

1558
01:48:02,833 --> 01:48:05,666
decent, smart.

1559
01:48:06,670 --> 01:48:09,468
You listen to her.

1560
01:48:15,479 --> 01:48:18,505
A good man
once told me that life goes by...

1561
01:48:18,582 --> 01:48:20,516
faster than summer vacation,

1562
01:48:20,584 --> 01:48:22,745
and he was right,

1563
01:48:22,819 --> 01:48:25,811
and one day you'll be old enough
to understand that.

1564
01:48:25,889 --> 01:48:28,323
So enjoy it.

1565
01:48:28,392 --> 01:48:30,792
Enjoy your life.

1566
01:48:30,861 --> 01:48:32,795
Enjoy it all.

1567
01:48:34,131 --> 01:48:36,122
You were on my list.

1568
01:48:40,003 --> 01:48:43,336
And me doing this
has given me...

1569
01:48:43,407 --> 01:48:45,841
my own perfect world,

1570
01:48:45,909 --> 01:48:47,934
and I thank you for that.

1571
01:48:48,011 --> 01:48:50,070
I really do.

1572
01:49:17,007 --> 01:49:20,374
They say the Man With The Plan
can never be killed,

1573
01:49:20,444 --> 01:49:23,106
but Jimmy the Saint,
he did it.

1574
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:27,276
He didn't have to scale no walls
or wrestle with no goons, either.

1575
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:29,511
He just took Bernard
out for a ride.

1576
01:49:29,586 --> 01:49:33,215
The Man With The Plan never
spilled another drop of blood again.

1577
01:50:12,062 --> 01:50:13,996
- Gentlemen,

1578
01:50:14,064 --> 01:50:16,157
we have boat drinks.

1579
01:50:20,537 --> 01:50:23,995
Oh, it's just the way we shake hands.

1580
01:50:24,074 --> 01:50:26,907
You press palms
upside like that.

1581
01:50:26,977 --> 01:50:30,310
You know why? Because when
we were locked down,

1582
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:33,315
in the visitors room
they had this clear plastic divider...

1583
01:50:33,383 --> 01:50:36,011
that separated you
from your visitor.

1584
01:50:36,086 --> 01:50:39,817
And you used to touch 'em hello and
good-bye like that.

1585
01:50:39,890 --> 01:50:45,157
Hey, I ever tell ya about
Jimmy "the Saint" Tosnia from Flatbush?

1586
01:50:45,228 --> 01:50:47,662
In his day,

1587
01:50:47,731 --> 01:50:50,393
the bitch's bastard.

1588
01:50:51,393 --> 01:51:01,393
