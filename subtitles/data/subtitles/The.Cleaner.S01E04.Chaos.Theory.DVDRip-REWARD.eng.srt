Previously on The Cleaner:

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,301
Everyone in position?

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,742
Depends on what position you
want.

4
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:13,370
-Akani.
-I slept with her,

5
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,074
but Melissa and me
were separated, and I'm sorry.

6
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,515
All right? I'm sorry<i>....</i>
every day since.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,245
When Lula was being born
in the hospital,

8
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,752
I was down the hallway
slamming dope,

9
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:21,913
and I made a deal

10
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,286
that if he got me

11
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,415
through that day that

12
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:27,620
I would become
his avenging angel.

13
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,197
What I love and hate

14
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,135
the most about numbers
is that they're infinite.

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,138
Never-ending.

16
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,140
Everlasting.

17
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,540
The numbers up here
have been haunting me

18
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,703
for almost a year,

19
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,213
so I try to remind myself

20
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,739
there are only ten numbers
that we use.

21
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,479
The same ten

22
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,146
that we learned to count to,

23
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,985
using our fingers
and our toes.

24
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,685
20, 40, 60, 80.

25
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,216
Plus $1 ,600.

26
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,092
Plus gas?

27
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,960
-I included gas, Swenton.
-God, not this again.

28
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,694
Ooh, you know what? Back off,
Ivanka Trump, all right?

29
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,463
Um, no, I'm talking about gas
for the, uh...

30
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:10,901
for the night
that I was on surveillance.

31
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,565
You were on the same address
for 11 hours, Swenton,

32
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,834
and the mark never moved.

33
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,068
-Plus $1 ,600.
-So, no gas?

34
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,170
-Darnell?
-Yo.

35
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,306
One, two, three, four, 500,
six, seven, eight.

36
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,441
When you put them

37
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,578
into different configurations,
they grow, and they multiply.

38
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,110
They split and divide.

39
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,452
Everything

40
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,651
in the universe can be measured

41
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,855
by our fingers and our toes.

42
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:36,987
Ten numbers.

43
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,291
Just ten.

44
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,765
Akani, plus $1,600.

45
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,961
Please. It's not like
she's gonna cash it anyway.

46
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,095
No, she's gonna use it as a
torch and stick it up your ass.

47
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,504
Okay, that makes us square
on the Oxy mom case.

48
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,802
Rock star, too.

49
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:49,968
As long as he stays clean.

50
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,135
Cynic.

51
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,610
-Realist.
-Gosh, you know,

52
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,135
-boots, new phone.
-Phone.

53
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,340
-Phone.
-But you guys should

54
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,643
really check out these boots.

55
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,207
They're kind of a faux
endangered reptile

56
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,513
-kind of thing.
-Swen, get a new phone.

57
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,249
Hey.

58
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,813
We got all the food.

59
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,257
Which means you got what?

60
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,852
Oh, sodas, chips, avocado

61
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,954
and salsa for the guac,
corn on the cob,

62
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,624
-salad, pie-- cherry.
-And rhubarb.

63
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,294
Okay, so we need, uh,
beef kabobs, fish kabobs,

64
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,860
and two vegetarian
for Quinn.

65
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,132
Don't let me forget.

66
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,800
Hey! He's coming, huh?

67
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,069
Yeah, he's coming.

68
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,406
Well, that's good.

69
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,071
Who is Quinn?

70
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,909
When I was a kid,

71
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,916
I worked in my father's diner--
his father's before that.

72
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,748
One day, my mom got sick,
and I had to work the register.

73
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,914
You got to understand,
math-- not my strong suit.

74
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:40,187
My dad was too busy on the grill
to show me what to do.

75
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,284
I just jumped into it.

76
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,521
Three dollars for a tuna melt.

77
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,189
Dollar fifty
for fries and a soda,

78
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,925
$6.89 for the Gyros plate.

79
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,330
Suddenly,

80
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,857
the numbers started
making sense to me.

81
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:49,994
I don't know why,

82
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,195
but they did.

83
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,864
Something clicked,
and since then,

84
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,874
they're my only constant.

85
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:00,536
My ship in the tempest-tossed
seas of life.

86
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,411
Oh, it wasn't that funny.

87
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,008
You're late for your next
class. Go.

88
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,589
So, when your dad
was in prison...

89
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,853
This is the second time,
right?

90
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,860
Yeah. For possession.

91
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,192
Anyway, he needed someone.

92
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,959
A friend.

93
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,260
Another prisoner?

94
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,528
Inmate.

95
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,899
Same difference.

96
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,267
Will you let her finish?

97
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,965
So that was Quinn, the friend?

98
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,631
Mm-hmm, and he...

99
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,141
And what was he in for?

100
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,403
Robbery.

101
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,637
I'm gonna lie to you.

102
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,407
It's the same old story, right?

103
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,607
-Wrong place at the wrong time.
-It can happen.

104
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,843
And I was... I was in a bad way.

105
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,317
I mean, I'm real bad.

106
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,912
So it was Quinn
who got me sober.

107
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,252
No, scratch that.

108
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,086
Quinn saved my life.

109
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,218
Hmm. "He shall give his angels
charge over thee to keep thee

110
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,593
lest anytime thou dash
thou foot against the stone."

111
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,757
Poetic.

112
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,528
Luke. Chapter four, verse ten.

113
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,829
Sounds like somebody

114
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,893
spends a lot of time
in hotel rooms...

115
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:58,995
with Mr. Gideon.

116
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,471
Wait.

117
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,804
I met that guy with Mick, right?

118
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,469
Uh, Quinn the Eskimo?

119
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,636
Yeah. Mick knew him.

120
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,509
But the trip is,
his name ain't Quinn.

121
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,174
He ain't even an Eskimo.

122
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,944
I mean...

123
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,383
But, Darnell,
you're right, he is...

124
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,817
he is some kind of angel.

125
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:14,945
Hmm.

126
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,215
You know, back then,

127
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,655
Quinn doesn't save me,
I'm thinking...

128
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,127
I don't know.
I end up like, uh...

129
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,186
Well, like Mick.

130
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,413
I don't even know
how you wrap your mind

131
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,680
around all this theory,
Professor.

132
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,711
I've been working this theory
for ten months.

133
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,587
If I can't wrap my mind
around it now...

134
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,986
Go on, get out of here.

135
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,824
Oh, I don't mind. I'll help.

136
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,387
Harry, go.

137
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,570
See you in class
tomorrow, Professor.

138
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,309
Yeah, I'll pick it up.

139
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,608
Charcoal for the grill,
mesquite chips. Got it.

140
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,943
Yeah, I'll be home soon.

141
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,948
I'm just, uh, finishing up here.

142
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,779
Bye.

143
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,308
Buying a new truck?

144
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,581
Some day.

145
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,112
Sounds like
you're throwing a big party.

146
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,419
Mega--

147
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,050
disco ball, DJ, tons of blow.

148
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,253
Oh, nice. Special occasion?

149
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,420
Nah.

150
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,622
Oh, just immediate family?

151
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,130
Couple of friends.

152
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,690
Yeah, I could cancel my plans.

153
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,465
Party might be a little too
low-key for your taste, Akani.

154
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,369
Are you sure?

155
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,306
Yeah.

156
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,634
Have fun.

157
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,620
You feel like conserving water?

158
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,861
Not so much.

159
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,766
What are you doing up so early?

160
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,237
I wanted to get my homework done
before school.

161
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,433
That's good. That's...
that's mature.

162
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,841
I wouldn't push that
maturity thing too much.

163
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,143
I peed in the shower.

164
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,520
Let me warm you up.

165
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,681
How have you been?

166
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,623
You and Teddy didn't come
to the house

167
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:06,784
for dinner Friday.

168
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,918
I know. I'm sorry.

169
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,120
We're good. Busy.

170
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,255
I'm taking
a few more classes at school.

171
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,356
Teddy's trying to get published
before the deadline.

172
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,559
-Hi, Mom.
-Oh.

173
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,965
Hi, Teddy.

174
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,162
Let me get you some breakfast.

175
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,538
Same weight
since high school, Mama.

176
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,338
Hey, Pop.

177
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,803
Come on. I want
to get to class early.

178
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,440
Bye, honey.

179
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,442
Tess, is he doing okay?

180
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,953
He's doing great.

181
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,148
He's just under
a lot of pressure.

182
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,351
We'll come by for dinner
this week.

183
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,360
Sofi, leave the beautiful
professor alone.

184
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,588
We got customers.

185
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,821
Bye.

186
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,172
Quinn.

187
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,043
Get out of my head.

188
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,506
The kids asked about him.

189
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,541
Good.

190
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,918
What did you say?

191
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,682
What they needed to know.

192
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,588
Which means what?

193
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,219
Which means, not as much
as you wish I did,

194
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,424
but more than
I would have on my own.

195
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,625
Well, that's the tricky
part, right, babe?

196
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,691
Telling our kids just enough

197
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,670
to, uh, keep their heads
clear, their eyes open,

198
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,674
but not so much
that you scare them off

199
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,266
from taking risks.

200
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,004
-Hmm.
-You know, the good ones.

201
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,480
We'll figure it out.

202
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,754
Mmm. Get out of my head.

203
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,760
Just so you know,
this is really gonna help

204
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,958
when I have nothing to say
in confession.

205
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,068
Do I have to stay here
for the party?

206
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,263
Yes.

207
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,635
Can I have a friend over?

208
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,139
-Of course you can, sweetheart.
-Good.

209
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,334
'Cause I was thinking maybe
I could invite Charlie Mintz.

210
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,503
You know what?
On second thought, no friends.

211
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,671
I told you.

212
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,304
Go get in the truck, all right?

213
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,372
We're gonna be late for school.

214
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,579
We're not, uh... we're not
at the boy talk moment, are we?

215
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,018
No.

216
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,045
Not yet.

217
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,922
Unless you got something

218
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,119
you might want
to talk to me about.

219
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,628
Can I talk to you later?

220
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,063
You sure can.

221
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,690
-All right, wait here.
-Dad, we're gonna be late!

222
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,291
Get in the truck!

223
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,303
I'll be right back.

224
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,328
ln 12 hours.

225
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,637
So, if I transfer my balance
to your card company,

226
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,075
how soon
can I get a cash advance?

227
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,634
It would normally take
two weeks,

228
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,773
-No. -but I can arrange to have
it done in ten business days.

229
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,146
That's-That's too long.

230
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,309
How about frequent flier miles?

231
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,787
No, I don't want airline miles,
Goddamn it!

232
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,947
-Hi, Teddy.
-Tess.

233
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,321
You missed the department
meeting again.

234
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,656
I covered for you.

235
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,559
The staff's sick
of hearing me talk.

236
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,791
-They'd rather dump me
and keep you. -And you?

237
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,958
I want to keep you, too.

238
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,934
You have to stop.

239
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,493
I will stop once

240
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,198
I get through this,
but it helps me write.

241
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,435
Tess, you understand
what this means for us

242
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,306
if I get published.

243
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,312
Tenure, a house,

244
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,814
kids.

245
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,613
Teddy... are you serious?

246
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,247
Come here.

247
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,382
Completely.

248
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,517
Mmm.

249
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,494
Hey.

250
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,834
You're looking good, Quinn.

251
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,101
Yeah. Mrs. Banks, you're a liar
and I love you for it.

252
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,705
Check out my husband
with Jasmine Marks.

253
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,110
-Flirt.
-Relentless.

254
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,613
I meant her.

255
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,684
How's he doing?

256
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,685
-He's good.
-Yeah.

257
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,686
Coaching Ben's football,

258
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,416
which basically just gives them

259
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,754
another reason to be pissed
at each other.

260
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,089
Lula's got him wrapped
around her finger.

261
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,685
Just like her mother?

262
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,060
Hardly.

263
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,086
He's clean.

264
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,861
Yeah.

265
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,198
And, you know, I think this...

266
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,704
deal he made--
if he's tempted to use,

267
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,967
the deal he made with God,

268
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,438
it stops him.

269
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,102
At least so far.

270
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,110
How's the marriage going?

271
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,271
Wow. Quinn, free therapy.

272
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,280
Yeah.

273
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,815
When he was shooting dope,
I was this heroic woman

274
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,377
just for sticking by him,
and now that he's some kind of

275
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,719
personal savior,
I'm just a lucky chick

276
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,452
who landed a guy
like William Banks.

277
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,584
I didn't mean that
the way it sounds.

278
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,621
You know what D.H. Lawrence
said about marriage?

279
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,998
Yes, I did a lot
of reading in the joint.

280
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,128
D.H. Lawrence said that
marriage was three things.

281
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,640
It was you, it was him,
and the third thing was

282
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,404
the thing that you created
together.

283
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,844
I don't know, maybe you just
got to work on that third thing.

284
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,110
You getting soft on me, Quinn?

285
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,482
I'm just counting on you two
to make it all work.

286
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,458
Cheers.

287
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,771
And I helped out his wife,
so he gave us an opportunity...

288
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,205
Excuse me?

289
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,538
-Yeah.
-Hi.

290
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,567
I'm looking for William.

291
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,136
D, you want to give me a minute?

292
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,114
I'm William.

293
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,174
What can I do for you?

294
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,858
A couple years ago,

295
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,422
you helped my cousin's wife,
Janelle Banick.

296
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,626
You may not remember.

297
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,135
Cross addicted
to Valium and alcohol.

298
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,501
60 day detox.

299
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,505
How's she doing?

300
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,905
Sober. Almost two years.

301
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,568
Ah, good. And you?

302
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,373
I'm not here to talk about me.

303
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:43,211
I have a colleague, a brilliant
mathematics professor actually.

304
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,184
He started using speed
about a year ago

305
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,947
when he started
working on his paper.

306
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,956
He, hopefully, will get
published this summer.

307
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,925
He used it to balance his class
schedule with his writing,

308
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:54,948
just speed.

309
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,188
And then he graduated
to cocaine.

310
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,195
Yeah.

311
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,993
Janelle told me about your fee.

312
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,293
Half now.

313
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,106
Please, I-I need your help.

314
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,909
Ben, if you want a ride,
we're leaving.

315
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,252
I'm coming.

316
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,278
Damn it.

317
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,731
All right, sit down, everybody.

318
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,297
We got a case up.

319
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,468
His name is Teddy Souplos.

320
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,968
He's a professor of mathematics
at Alta California University.

321
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:48,980
He's also a cocaine addict.

322
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,639
He's up for tenure this year.

323
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,241
If he doesn't publish,
he's done.

324
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,253
Publish or perish.

325
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,618
What? I watch TV.

326
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:57,622
Who made the touch?

327
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:58,623
Colleague.

328
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,522
All right, Akani, Darnell,

329
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,925
I want you hitting all the
dealer tracks on the West Side.

330
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,427
I don't actually
have to purchase

331
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,930
or take narcotics, do l?

332
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,192
Well, sometimes you might
have to make a buy.

333
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,825
Otherwise,
you get made as a cop.

334
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,860
And that is not so bueno, okay?

335
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:13,894
Let's go.

336
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,472
East Side are your weed dealers.

337
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,847
Mellow guys, good businessmen.

338
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,785
West Side: pharmaceuticals,
some meth dealers.

339
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,845
Not so nice.

340
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,753
Down by the water,

341
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,257
that's Shooters Row.

342
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,554
These fools even
suspect you're a cop,

343
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,855
they will drop you on the spot.

344
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,521
I don't want to speak
out of turn,

345
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,463
but you seem like
such a nice girl. l-I...

346
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,363
Don't patronize me with
the "nice girl" speech.

347
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,958
I'm here for the
same reason you are,

348
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,502
William is and I'm
pretty sure Swenton.

349
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:48,233
We're all here looking for
something better than we had.

350
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,832
Coke dealers take up

351
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,207
the entire North Side
of the park.

352
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,211
You go with cash,

353
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,644
you make a buy,
keep the conversation

354
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,977
to a minimum. Got it?

355
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,675
But William didn't say
I had to buy any drugs...

356
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:58,683
William's not here.

357
00:16:58,717 --> 00:16:59,843
I have seniority.

358
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:00,909
So go.

359
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,716
And, Darnell,

360
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,786
I'm not a nice girl.

361
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,931
Everything's been arranged
for you

362
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,268
to go under at the university.

363
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,772
Here's your lD,
your class schedule.

364
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,866
Now, I want you to go into that
school's payroll office and...

365
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:24,898
I know, I know, I know.

366
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,672
-Stick to financials.
-Right.

367
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,304
I'm kind of excited
I'm going back to college.

368
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,747
I mean, l-I told you about
how I applied to college?

369
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,547
By taking my old man's "Girls
of the Pac 10" issue of Playboy,

370
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,883
and I let that ship steer
my academic future.

371
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,718
I applied to all ten schools.

372
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,451
And how many did you get into?

373
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,459
Uh, surprisingly, Arizona State.

374
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,393
Swenton, do not
make me regret this.

375
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,691
Come on.

376
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,531
Ah! Ah! Ah!

377
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,763
Pre-med?

378
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,635
My mom is gonna be so proud.

379
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,765
I know I promised.

380
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,333
I just... I just need
a little bit more

381
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,708
so that I can write.

382
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,871
Teddy, no.

383
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,279
You-you... We want
a house one day.

384
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,078
Right, Tess?

385
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,812
Tess...

386
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,444
I need the money.

387
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,615
I'll pay you back.

388
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,681
Tess?

389
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,521
Hello?

390
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,790
Hello?!

391
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,136
Professor Souplos.

392
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,368
Hey. Hi, Harry.

393
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,706
Yeah, come on. Come on in.

394
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,802
You okay?

395
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,279
No, l-I'm okay, thanks.

396
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,339
Look, I realized today what l
want to write my thesis about.

397
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,782
When you were talking
about your parents,

398
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:40,807
something just clicked.

399
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,548
lt was completely inspiring.

400
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,954
And, like you said,
it would click, and it did.

401
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,957
That's excellent news.

402
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,482
Good for you. Good.

403
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,495
Can I ask you something, Harry?

404
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,191
Sure.

405
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,326
This is a rather
awkward request, so...

406
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,665
And feel free to say no.

407
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,638
But, uh, I just paid my rent,

408
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,232
and I'm being told that the bank

409
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,210
hasn't cleared my paycheck.

410
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,337
I-I know it's odd

411
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,210
-that I would even...
-How much do you need?

412
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,309
No, forget it.
You know, you don't have to...

413
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,217
I want to.

414
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,415
How much money do you need?

415
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,918
Uh, I guess

416
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,521
$500 would do.

417
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,930
Okay.

418
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,834
Actually, uh...

419
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,861
it would make my life easier

420
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,433
if we could get the cash, Harry.

421
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,074
Okay.

422
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,393
Teach just showed up.

423
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,125
Let's grab him.

424
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,066
Hey, there's about 150 yards
between him and us and about

425
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,193
400 rounds of ammunition.

426
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,203
Four hundred and eleven.

427
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,534
Darnell, don't.

428
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,233
This is what we do, right?

429
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,399
We protect the client.

430
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,840
-Shit!
-Unless you want to stand around

431
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,867
and buy more drugs.

432
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,746
Oh, William, pick up, pick up.

433
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,978
Man, we have a problem.

434
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,178
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

435
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,585
William, we've got a problem.

436
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,316
Darnell's gone rogue
at the park.

437
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,990
Shit.

438
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,524
Don't say a word.

439
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,093
-Just keep moving.
-What are you doing, man?

440
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,263
What the hell are you doing?

441
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,001
What you doing, William?

442
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,235
Keep moving.

443
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,142
You had one thing
to take care of, Akani.

444
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,116
You want to get into
a pissing contest with me?

445
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,015
What the hell are you doing
having him make a buy?

446
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,179
-Do you want to hear my side
of the story? -Not unless

447
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,781
it ends in "Yes, William, we did
exactly what you told us to do."

448
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,451
It's a slight variation
on that, man.

449
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,188
And you. You think you're
some kind of cowboy now, huh?

450
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,957
You gonna ride in
and save the day?

451
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,827
All you needed to do
was make the mark.

452
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,389
You do not make a move on him.

453
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,525
And you don't carry

454
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,263
unless the rest
of the team is aware.

455
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,203
I make the calls,
I set the plays.

456
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,603
You don't authorize
that kind of move.

457
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,766
Okay, I was just trying to...

458
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,340
Yeah.

459
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,505
I'm a patient woman, babe,
wouldn't you say?

460
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,514
Some would say saintly.

461
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,176
So, do you think it would be out
of character for this saint

462
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,618
to want to put her foot
up our son's ass?

463
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,451
What did he do?

464
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:33,686
Our son seems to think that
smoking is a good idea.

465
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:34,851
Are they ours?

466
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:35,985
Nope.

467
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,528
Well, then, babe,
you-you can handle this.

468
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:39,587
William, you better get home,

469
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,996
or you may be down one child.

470
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,795
I'm on my way.

471
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,495
All right, get off my truck.

472
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:45,969
Go home, get out of here.

473
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,266
Swenton's going under
in the morning.

474
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,671
Hey, do you want us to stay

475
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:49,696
on surveillance?

476
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,003
What, after you've been made?

477
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,599
Get off my truck.

478
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,728
Nothing to say?

479
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,736
Go to bed.

480
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,239
What about my homework?

481
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,639
Do your homework,
then go to bed.

482
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,903
What about dinner?

483
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,638
You don't get dinner.

484
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,174
You know, you're making

485
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:31,705
some great decisions
with your life.

486
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,146
I guess that makes me
the apple then, huh, tree?

487
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,395
Are you ready for school?

488
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:53,495
I've been thinking
about Mom and Dad's party.

489
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,005
What about it?

490
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,007
lt was almost normal, right?

491
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,441
Mom and Dad were getting along.

492
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,446
There were sort of
normal people in our house.

493
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,641
The singing along
on the guitar was queer,

494
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,446
but it was normal,
for our family.

495
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,544
We have to hurry.

496
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,111
I'm meeting Charlie Mintz
to help him cram

497
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,350
for the marine science quiz.

498
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,359
I heard about the cigarettes.

499
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,361
Dad got really mad, right?

500
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,862
It's none of your business, Lu.

501
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,947
Hey, did Lula talk to you
this morning?

502
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,280
No, uh-uh.

503
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,581
About what?

504
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,554
I don't know,
she wouldn't tell me.

505
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,951
But I think it's about...

506
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,121
boys.

507
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,222
That horny little Charlie Mintz.

508
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:55,760
Huh?

509
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,167
I'll talk to her.

510
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,908
Hey, are we alone right now?

511
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,035
Yeah.

512
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,305
Alone is nice.

513
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,870
Alone together is...

514
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,713
really nice.

515
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:13,843
Could be.

516
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,853
Really?

517
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,878
Maybe.

518
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,480
Hey, wait.

519
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,782
Hey, let's go to the bedroom.

520
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,582
What?

521
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,113
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

522
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,648
What? What did I do?

523
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,853
-No.
-Is it about the bedroom?

524
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:56,861
About going to the bedroom?

525
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,419
No, baby.

526
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:02,024
I'm sorry, baby.

527
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,661
I'm sorry,
I thought I was ready.

528
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,938
Damn it.

529
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,168
You've only been home
for a while.

530
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,307
I'm sorry.

531
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,100
I'm almost done.

532
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,665
I cracked the equation.

533
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,903
I'm almost done.

534
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,468
You're not even close
to being done.

535
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,412
-What are you talking about?
-I read it.

536
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,142
That morning that you went out

537
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,082
to score, I read your paper.

538
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,711
What were you doing
on my computer?

539
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,551
lt doesn't make any sense,
Teddy.

540
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,819
It's just thoughts
that don't connect.

541
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,325
That's because you
couldn't possibly,

542
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,190
possibly understand
that paper.

543
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,163
It's words that don't connect
to anything.

544
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:08,222
It's the best thing
that I've ever written,

545
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,063
and the fact that you
can't understand it

546
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,228
means absolutely nothing.

547
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,778
Tess!

548
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,926
Tess!

549
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,827
Okay...

550
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,441
Hey, Dr. Hanson, how are you?

551
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,170
Very well, thank you.

552
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,372
Fire.

553
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,471
Fire alarm, people!

554
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,209
There's a fire alarm!

555
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:32,511
I-I smell smoke.

556
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,518
I hope my car is okay.
Oh, wow, somebody...

557
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:35,678
Does somebody have a phone?

558
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,210
Anybody? I-I should...
I should...

559
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,416
We should probably
call somebody, right?

560
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:53,961
Go ahead.

561
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,165
All right, William, I'm in.

562
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:57,699
This college sucks, bro.

563
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:58,800
lt doesn't even
have a football team.

564
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,572
On point, Swenton.

565
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:01,738
What's that noise?

566
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,247
Um, nothing.

567
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,177
Souplos hasn't been paid
in months.

568
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,619
His last eight paychecks
were advanced.

569
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,680
All right, forget
about Teddy's financials.

570
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:13,691
Get Tess's.

571
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,420
-Why?
-Just do it.

572
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,594
Same thing.

573
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,427
They're advancing her checks,
too.

574
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,695
All right, look, get back
in the classroom.

575
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,031
Get eyes on Teddy.

576
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,036
Roger that.

577
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,128
And don't do a thing

578
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,763
unless you call me first,
you got it?

579
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,171
-All students and faculty
-I got it under control.

580
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,142
may return to their offices
and classrooms.

581
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,440
Go away, Lu.

582
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,777
It's me.

583
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,077
I'm busy.

584
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:41,847
I don't give a damn
if you're busy, Ben.

585
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,480
I want to know what the hell
you're doing smoking cigarettes.

586
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:45,682
You and Mom smoke.

587
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,952
Well, that's because

588
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,583
we're old enough to make
that stupid decision.

589
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,752
When you're older, you want

590
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,489
to do something that asinine,
be my guest.

591
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,759
Thanks, I'll give it
some thought.

592
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:54,822
You want to tell me

593
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,265
what the problem
is here, young man?

594
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,428
I don't know, Dad.
Why don't you tell me?

595
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,701
You better cut the crap.

596
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,106
What are you talking about?

597
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,512
Where did you get this?

598
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:22,549
ln the bathroom, on the floor.

599
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,687
-When?
-Yesterday.

600
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,163
ls it yours?

601
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,394
You know it's not mine.

602
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,369
-How come?
-What do you mean, how come?

603
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:33,495
What kind of question is that?

604
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,630
Because I'm clean,
that's how come.

605
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,697
And how am I supposed
to know that?

606
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,572
Because I told you that I am!

607
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,976
Where do you get off
asking me that?!

608
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,647
This is bullshit.

609
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:49,350
And I wanted you to hear this
from me, not Ben.

610
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,381
What?

611
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,493
ls it yours?

612
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,166
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

613
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,692
ls it yours?

614
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:08,933
Wow.

615
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,203
What am I supposed
to think, William?

616
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,404
You're supposed to think
it's not mine, babe.

617
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:16,743
You used to leave them
all over the house.

618
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,215
I used to pick them up
so the kids wouldn't find them.

619
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,081
And you always used

620
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,916
to tell me
that they weren't yours.

621
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,114
Well, I took responsibility
for that.

622
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,554
After you got clean,
what, the third time?

623
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,217
Don't give me that.
Don't give me that.

624
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,793
William, you're a great liar.

625
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,800
Okay, I know that.

626
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,701
So I'm gonna ask you
one last time.

627
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,731
ls it yours?

628
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,476
No.

629
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,708
It's not mine.

630
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,742
Then you find out whose it is,

631
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,914
who brought this into our home,
and you take care of it,

632
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:01,619
because whoever this belongs to
is not welcome in this house.

633
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,467
I'm terribly sorry I'm late.

634
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,603
Excuse me.

635
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,080
Terribly sorry I'm late,
everyone.

636
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,844
I was working on my paper,

637
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,478
and I got to thinking
about a couple of things.

638
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,987
The numbers that...

639
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,114
and there are only ten
of them<i>....</i>

640
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,489
I told you this.

641
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,995
About the fingers
and the toes, right?

642
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,500
Uh, but if you look...

643
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,503
at the-the equation,
the numbers that...

644
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,804
What's on my board?

645
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,278
Who was working on my board?

646
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,680
I saw an amazing opportunity
on the third parallel.

647
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,149
Did I ask for your help, Harry?

648
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:03,051
N-No, but you were...
Well, I just thought...

649
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,054
You thought what?

650
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,612
Thought I needed your help?

651
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,454
That-That you-you
were just gonna solve this

652
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:08,618
and save the day?

653
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,628
Shit, write my paper for me?

654
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:11,651
ls that what you thought?

655
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,323
I don't need your help, Harry.

656
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,695
I don't need any of it.

657
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,326
Wait, stop, I only figured
out a small piece of it.

658
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:18,300
Stop!

659
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,826
I didn't ask for your help.

660
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,429
I didn't ask for anything!

661
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,064
I'm sorry, I'm...

662
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,234
Please give me bars.

663
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,724
lt was just awkward as hell,
Quinn.

664
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,996
lt... you know,
it completely freaked me out.

665
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,162
There's my son,
my wife looking at me,

666
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,672
you know, looking at me
like they used to look at me,

667
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,107
practically calling me a liar
to my face.

668
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,302
No, you know what?

669
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,471
Melissa did call me a liar.

670
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,472
Whose rig do you think it was?

671
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,813
Oh, man, you don't
think it was mine.

672
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,378
Quinn, I don't know
what to think.

673
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:12,616
You don't think it was mine.

674
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,591
You know, I don't
know what to think.

675
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,327
I think you better sit down
right now, brother.

676
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:23,232
I think you better sit down
before I stand up.

677
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,803
I'm sorry.

678
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:33,369
I swear on the heads
of your children.

679
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,810
Look, you don't have to do that.

680
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,111
I swear on the heads
of Lula and Ben

681
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,980
that was not my rig.

682
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,486
Man, I wouldn't do
something like that

683
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,317
to you in your own home.

684
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,549
Hell, man,

685
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,286
the old Quinn wouldn't even
do something that low.

686
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:52,592
Well, maybe.

687
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,428
Whose do you think it was?

688
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:58,435
I don't know, but
I got to find out.

689
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,562
You're damn right you do.

690
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,939
I'm sorry, man.

691
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,849
Unbelievable.

692
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,320
The guy goes wacko, okay?
I can't get bars.

693
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,549
I'm thinking,
"When is this building built--

694
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:19,715
like, the 1940s or something?"

695
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,315
It's like a bomb shelter.

696
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,917
Couldn't get a signal
for like a quarter of a mile.

697
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,951
-Get a new phone. -Still
waiting on that phone call.

698
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:25,961
I couldn't get bars.

699
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,156
Get a new phone.

700
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,790
You know what?
lf it were up to me,

701
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,460
I would have just dropped him
right there in the room.

702
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:31,866
I mean, you had the green light.

703
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,962
You know what?
I... couldn't get a signal.

704
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,404
I would have done it
if it were up to me.

705
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,567
Bullshit.

706
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:38,632
I tend to believe her.

707
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,668
Excuse me,
I'm looking for William.

708
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:45,739
Hi, um...
William is right out front.

709
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:56,821
You were paying for his drugs
and you hired me.

710
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,022
I didn't know what else to do.

711
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,566
I should have told you.

712
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,364
I didn't want to keep
giving him money.

713
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,428
I didn't.

714
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,236
I also didn't...
want to lose him.

715
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,733
He's such an amazing
person, William.

716
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,270
Oh, I really wish that
you could see him the way

717
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,374
that I do.

718
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,416
So, what now?

719
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,726
Now?

720
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,921
He's lost your money.

721
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,727
He's not getting published.

722
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,790
He's losing his job.

723
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,631
He's losing his mind.

724
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,933
He's losing his family.

725
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,167
With everything he's lost,

726
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,074
I still can't promise you
he's bottomed out.

727
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,377
I made you some tea.

728
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,648
Oh, honey,
I'm not a tea kind of guy.

729
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,678
It's chamomile;
it will relax you.

730
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,587
Oh, I don't need to be relaxed.

731
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,354
A boy tried to kiss me.

732
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:42,763
Give me the tea.

733
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,702
I'm gonna kick
that Charlie Mintz's ass.

734
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,266
Actually, I tried to kiss him.

735
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:58,145
But Charlie
didn't want to kiss me.

736
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:05,854
Well, Lula, listen to me now.

737
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,824
Sometime in the very,
very distant future--

738
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,257
and I mean very distant--

739
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,920
there's going to be another
boy, not Charlie Mintz...

740
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,825
Dad.

741
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,423
...and this boy,

742
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,696
he's going to think you're the
prettiest girl he's ever seen,

743
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,293
he's going to think
you hung the moon,

744
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,202
and there will come a time

745
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,733
eventually when he'll want
nothing more than to kiss you,

746
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,607
and when that time comes,
baby...

747
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:28,805
Yeah?

748
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,541
I'm gonna want
to kick his ass, too.

749
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,850
All right?

750
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,875
-Okay?
-Okay.

751
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,405
Yeah.

752
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,963
Well, first off,
l'd just like to say

753
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:58,701
that it was a nice surprise
when I heard from you.

754
00:37:58,743 --> 00:37:59,869
I mean, I thought
our encounter was...

755
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,901
You'll get your money
if my guy is there.

756
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,276
Well, that would be terrific,
William.

757
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,805
Now, the financial agreement
we had was, uh...

758
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,317
-Three hundred.
-Cool.

759
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,875
Look, your boy
is down at MacArthur.

760
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,147
Dude is sketchy as hell.

761
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:11,586
His ass should be teaching
home ec.

762
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,681
First class--
how to take a bath.

763
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,316
Look, he ain't got shit
to buy shit

764
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,553
and he's looking to score.

765
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,084
He ain't going to be leaving
without scoring

766
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,619
and he ain't scoring
anytime soon.

767
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:20,892
I'm on my way.

768
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:21,898
With my money?

769
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,832
Yep.

770
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,907
Hey, Quinn.

771
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:32,374
Hello, Mrs. Banks.

772
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,674
You, uh, selling a little
door-to-door D.H. Lawrence?

773
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,074
No, I just came
to get my guitar.

774
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,105
Oh, right. Uh, hey, Lula,
can you grab

775
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,549
Quinn's guitar?

776
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,609
One second.

777
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:47,113
Your esposo told me
about the rig somebody left.

778
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,491
That's bad.

779
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,120
Yeah, you have no idea.

780
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,960
Oh, I do.

781
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,158
I saw the look on Will's face.

782
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,600
Hmm.

783
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,467
You have any idea
who it might have been?

784
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:05,032
Nah, it's...
maybe Crazy Kenny or Joy.

785
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:10,580
Here you go.

786
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:11,911
Thank you, darling.

787
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,747
It never ends.

788
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,117
-Bye, Quinn.
-I'll give you a call.

789
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,451
Okay.

790
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,478
Excuse me, Quinn?

791
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,184
Yes.

792
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,887
I don't know if, well...

793
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,328
What is it, Lula?

794
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,460
I just... I wanted to thank
you for saving my dad's life.

795
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,867
Hey, Lula, the phone's for you.

796
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,165
Coming.

797
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,732
-Bye.
-Bye.

798
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,326
Hey, man, can you hook me up?

799
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:02,958
Nah, man, I don't mess
with them illegalities, bruh.

800
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,625
See that cat right there?

801
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,159
He's been slinging all morning.

802
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,402
Hey, man, can you hook me up?

803
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,408
Maybe.

804
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,431
What you need?

805
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:13,670
Blow.

806
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:15,972
I got... I got this.

807
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,274
It's worth a lot.

808
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:18,338
It's worth...

809
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,145
-Oh, I know what it's worth.
-Yeah.

810
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,209
Ow...

811
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,447
What are you doing?

812
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,377
How are you feeling?

813
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:50,608
Numb, mostly.

814
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,878
I can't believe all
the horrible shit I did,

815
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,680
-the things I said.
-Well,

816
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,913
nothing that hasn't been done
bigger and better before you.

817
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:16,438
It's a start.

818
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,634
Thank you.

819
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,006
You're welcome.

820
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,279
Man, I just...

821
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:36,259
Man, I just couldn't...

822
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,284
I just couldn't keep clean.

823
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:41,526
Leaving the rig
in your bathroom...

824
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:49,702
I just... was really high, man.

825
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,336
l... heard somebody
and I just freaked.

826
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,015
I'm sorry, Will.

827
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,813
I get it.

828
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,790
I swore on your children.

829
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:11,022
I get that, too.

830
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,625
I need your help.

831
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,036
I know.

832
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,913
And I'm going to help you,
Quinn.

833
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:34,077
I'll help you get straight,
I'll help you keep straight,

834
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:35,085
but you can't...

835
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,987
ever come to my house again.

836
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,181
Not ever.

837
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,249
Why?

838
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,954
Don't ask me that.

839
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:48,931
Just know that I'm gonna do
my best to help you and...

840
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:51,332
that you're not welcome
in my house

841
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:54,098
ever again.

842
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:56,538
Man, I saved your life.

843
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,945
I know you did,
and now I need to live it.

844
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,511
We're even.

845
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,652
Thanks for waiting for me.
