1
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,334
Hike!

2
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,255
Martel!

3
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,258
Martel, you're a wimp!

4
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,678
I can't believe that.
Martel goes for a give-up slide.

5
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:20,057
- It did look cautious.
- I could have scored on that!

6
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,267
That could be the last play of the season.

7
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,562
In case you haven't heard,
the players' strike became official...

8
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,397
...at 4 p. m. Eastern time.

9
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,526
I'm sad that the players' demands,
which center around...

10
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:34,613
...a rise in the current salary cap,
have been rejected by the owners.

11
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,533
I have told my union brothers to walk.

12
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,577
Get me Jimmy McGinty!
Have him here tonight.

13
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:41,828
Yes, sir.

14
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,498
I'm here with Eddie Martel.

15
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:49,378
A lot of angry fans out there feel
that the players are being too greedy.

16
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,171
Anything you'd like to say?

17
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:54,341
Dwight, I know $5 million a year
sounds like a lot of money...

18
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:58,053
...but I have to pay 10 percent to my agent,
5 percent to my lawyer...

19
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,056
Do you know what insurance costs
on a Ferrari, mother...

20
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,392
Pat, back to you.

21
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,311
That was Washington running back
Malcolm Lamont.

22
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,898
It's all about money, folks,
but isn't it always?

23
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,360
Yes. This is Pat Summerall
for John Madden saying...

24
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,779
...so long from Nextel Stadium.

25
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,950
- You look like shit.
- I'm dying, Jimmy.

26
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,579
Come on.

27
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,456
You've been dying for 20 years.

28
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,675
- Give me a cigarette.
- I quit.

29
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,345
Nobody likes a quitter.

30
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,600
- See the game today?
- No.

31
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,101
Why, you liar.

32
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,189
Could you believe that slide by Martel?

33
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,150
What a pussy.

34
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,780
- What's up?
- Take a ride with me.

35
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,451
How's the wife?

36
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,453
She had her lips done.

37
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,789
I never even knew
you could have your lips done.

38
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,627
Looks like a largemouth bass.

39
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,966
I'm too old to screw around.
Let me give it to you straight.

40
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,259
I want you back.

41
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,055
- You already have a coach.
- I'll take care of it.

42
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,308
- Like you took care of me.
- Now, Jimmy...

43
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,977
Your players all flew home
to their castles...

44
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,604
...in their private jets.

45
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,856
We're gonna finish the season anyway.

46
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,317
I'm gonna use replacement players.

47
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,404
- Jeez, what a business.
- We've got four games left.

48
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,865
We win three, we're in the playoffs.

49
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:45,494
Really? Win three out of four
with replacement players?

50
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,204
That's not too much to ask.

51
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,290
You won for me once, you can do it again.

52
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,544
What's the matter, Jimmy?

53
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:57,047
Nobody's gonna give you
a better chance than this...

54
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,174
...after that Dallas mess.

55
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,179
- I was right about that.
- It had nothing to do with being right!

56
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,974
You went head-to-head
with an $8 million quarterback.

57
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,686
Who did you think was gonna win?
That's not gonna happen here!

58
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:15,357
I'm talking about a team
of poor nobodies who play to win...

59
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,609
...not a bunch of bitchy millionaires.

60
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:20,529
Come on, Jimmy!

61
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,365
I'm thinking.

62
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,204
Hello!

63
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:31,748
Hello!

64
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,056
I want total control of my team.

65
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,060
I want to be able to recruit anybody
that I want, no interference.

66
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,398
My word is my bond.

67
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,943
I want it in writing.

68
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,071
Okay, Jimmy.

69
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,615
Okay.

70
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,244
We thought we'd skip
special teams for now.

71
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,581
It'll be tough enough
to put together a team in a week.

72
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,375
- We're gonna go a different way.
- A different way?

73
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,837
Here's a list of people
I've been watching over the years.

74
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,090
They've all played football,
not all of them in the pros.

75
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,052
But they all have something
unique to bring to the game.

76
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,180
We'll take them and try
to put together a winning team.

77
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,475
If nothing else,
they should be fun to watch.

78
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,269
Daniel Bateman, SWAT team officer.

79
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:38,482
Awarded a Purple Heart for losing
a kidney during the Gulf War.

80
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,031
A walk-on at Michigan State
before he gave up football...

81
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,326
...to sneak back into the service
for one more tour of duty.

82
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:50,994
Clifford Franklin.

83
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:56,875
Great attitude, great desire, and
the fastest son of a bitch I've ever seen.

84
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,129
Clifford! Twinkie!

85
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,555
What's up, man? Got any Twinkies?

86
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:10,889
Can he catch?

87
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,360
That's why I have you.

88
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,363
André and Jamal Jackson.

89
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:30,367
Together, these guys were the best
tandem team of guards in the game.

90
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,707
- You're kidding me!
- André got traded and they fell apart.

91
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:40,836
He ain't our problem no more.
We gonna play football.

92
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,589
- Football?
- Football.

93
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:46,842
Nigel Gruff.

94
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,221
Striker out of Cardiff,
now residing in Hell's Kitchen.

95
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:56,018
He's called "The Leg" because he can kick
a soccer ball the length of the field.

96
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,477
Gentlemen...

97
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,856
...the drinks are on the house!

98
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,109
Bollocks!

99
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,029
Pissing away our money again?

100
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,490
- No, the money's on the way.
- Where? To the OTB?

101
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,368
I got a winning horse!
I swear on my mom's grave!

102
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,538
Your mother's grave?
He's swearing on his mother's grave!

103
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,874
Nigel, listen. I want my money!

104
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,793
- Has he kept in shape?
- By Welsh standards.

105
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,421
Shane Falco.

106
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,593
Shane Falco?
"Footsteps" Falco from Ohio State?

107
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,886
The same.

108
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,807
- He hasn't played in years.
- Should be well rested then.

109
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,397
You look like a swordfish I caught once.

110
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,733
He hit the deck just like that.

111
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,946
- You know who I am?
- Yeah.

112
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,156
You're Jimmy McGinty.

113
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,992
That old coach from the '80s.

114
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,955
We met just before the Sugar Bowl.

115
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,748
I remember.

116
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,377
Hell of a game that Sugar Bowl.

117
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,589
- What'd you lose that by? 40 points?
- That would be 45.

118
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:13,262
Sometimes a game like that sticks
with you. You never shake it off.

119
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,974
- Got three concussions to prove it.
- That's why girls don't play.

120
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,894
Why are you here, coach?

121
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,772
I'm back with the Sentinels.
I want you to quarterback.

122
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,608
I found the best guards
and a wide receiver...

123
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,318
...even you couldn't overthrow.

124
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,698
- I'm retired.
- Retired?

125
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,952
It looks like things have gone
real well for you since.

126
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,289
I got no complaints.

127
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,374
It's quiet here.

128
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,626
Nobody bothers me.

129
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,797
That's the great thing about plankton,
it pretty much keeps to itself.

130
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,970
You know what separates the winners
from the losers?

131
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,305
The score.

132
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,894
Getting back up
after being kicked in the teeth.

133
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,563
I watched films of your games
since the Sugar Bowl.

134
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,233
You shouldn't have been trying
to carry the whole team that first year.

135
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,777
Your teammates leaned on you
and you crumbled.

136
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:17,367
- Is that how you want to be remembered?
- I don't want to be remembered at all.

137
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,580
You're young. If you do well,
who knows what'll happen after the strike.

138
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:25,501
I'm not making you any promises,
but why don't you take a chance?

139
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:29,796
Rather than scraping crap
off the bottom of somebody else's toys.

140
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,270
Think it over.

141
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,733
You could be part of something.

142
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:57,324
I'm here to remind fans that what
the owners are doing is unconscionable.

143
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,035
They have blatantly hired scabs...

144
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:04,957
...which goes against our Constitution,
the Declaration of Independence...

145
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,669
...and the Emancipation Proclamation.
Here come the scabs now!

146
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,589
That's Eddie Martel!

147
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,007
That's Wilson Carr!

148
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,677
Hey, Wilson!

149
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,346
I love you, man! What's happening?

150
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,224
I love you, man!

151
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,145
I'm gonna bust a cap in your ass,
and in your ass!

152
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,605
Piss off!

153
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,482
Piss off!

154
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,179
Get that bible out of here!

155
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,350
Sorry about this.

156
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,730
Put God in your heart!

157
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,739
I'm very sorry.

158
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,332
Get a job, you wankers!

159
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:52,773
Looking good out there!
You've got the goods!

160
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,275
Where did you learn to catch like that?

161
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,797
Roberts, make that D-back commit
before you cut, all right?

162
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,590
Jimmy.

163
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:22,719
- My tight end is deaf.
- Yeah, I know.

164
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,806
Jimmy, how am I gonna coach a deaf man?

165
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,099
You won't need to.

166
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:30,811
Brian Murphy would've gone
in the first round if he wasn't deaf.

167
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,856
Played college ball
here in D.C. at Gallaudet.

168
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,984
But I've got to be able
to communicate with him and how...

169
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:38,986
Learn to sign.

170
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,237
Horseshit!

171
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,366
Look at it this way,
he'll never be called offsides on an audible.

172
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,452
- Good to see you.
- You too.

173
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,538
- How are you?
- Good.

174
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,916
This is "The Leg"?

175
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,671
I thought you told me he was solid muscle.

176
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,631
He's much stronger than he looks.

177
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,758
I'm wiry.

178
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,011
Go get some kicks in.

179
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,477
He's "wiry. "

180
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,147
"Wiry. "

181
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,538
I'm sure you've been briefed
as to your situation.

182
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,291
Coach McGinty wanted you
with us for five weeks...

183
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,168
...and the Governor's complied.

184
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,628
Nice watch.

185
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:38,795
What?

186
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,088
This?

187
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,965
It's a fake.

188
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,842
Damn thing's always broken.

189
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,261
It's only right twice a day.

190
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,263
Why don't we join the others?

191
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,558
No sense standing here by ourselves...

192
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,602
...out of screaming distance.

193
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,813
- Come on, let's fire out of there!
- Jimmy.

194
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:00,192
- Falco, when's he coming?
- Relax, he'll be here.

195
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,568
Come on, quick feet!

196
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:05,405
I am relaxed, but that's not the point.
It's nervous energy.

197
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,116
Case in point:
We don't have a quarterback, do we?

198
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:11,370
- Fire out of there!
- We don't have a game plan for Sunday.

199
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,541
The only good thing I can say
about our one offensive weapon is...

200
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,168
...it's "wiry. " What the shit is that?

201
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:19,628
No, no, it's "wiry. "

202
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:22,840
- However the hell you say it!
- Say it: "Wiry. "

203
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:27,928
"Wiry. "

204
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,014
Holy! Look at this mamma-jamma!

205
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,195
Have you lost weight?

206
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:46,989
Coach, don't say that.

207
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:50,284
You look great.
Why don't you work out on SOD?

208
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,618
SOD.

209
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,290
- He's lost weight?
- Sumo wrestler.

210
00:15:56,498 --> 00:16:00,627
Expert at pushing people around.
That's what pass blocking is, remember?

211
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:01,837
That's right.

212
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,047
Next one, 74. Come on!

213
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,175
Set, hut!

214
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:08,886
All right! Way to go!

215
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:14,183
It's all about pushing people around!
Set! Hut!

216
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:20,355
Come on, Sumo boy.
Let's see what you can do.

217
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:21,398
Set. Hut!

218
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:29,323
Yes! Good hit, Sumo boy!
Now get this off of me!

219
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,241
"That'll do, pig, that'll do. "

220
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:35,370
- Screw you, cockroach.
- You'll have to find your dick first.

221
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,706
Get this off of me!

222
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,350
Hey, scab!

223
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:00,062
- I don't want any trouble.
- You hear that?

224
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:03,065
He's taking away my job,
but he doesn't want any trouble.

225
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:06,860
Not only is he taking your job,
he's taking your parking space too.

226
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,195
What's up?

227
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,739
Is that right, Falco?

228
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,034
I didn't know it was yours. I'll move it.

229
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:15,702
No, let us do that.

230
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,705
Guys, move the new boy's ride for him.

231
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:21,041
Coming right up, Mr. Falco.

232
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,047
Ready?

233
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,509
One. Two. Three.

234
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,436
Thanks, guys.

235
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,189
Asshole.

236
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:47,693
Jesus! "Footsteps" Falco.
They must be getting desperate.

237
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,361
Hey, Falco!

238
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,738
You're not even a has-been!

239
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,324
You're a never-was!

240
00:17:58,495 --> 00:17:59,538
Go!

241
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:05,752
Come on, let's pick it up!

242
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:15,137
Form a line here! Let's go seven on seven.

243
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,391
Check it out, it's our new quarterback.

244
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,818
We're in business now.

245
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,823
You're late.

246
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,325
Car trouble.

247
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,660
You still got an arm?

248
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,834
Hey, Falco.

249
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:49,922
Go!

250
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,441
That's gonna leave a mark.

251
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,154
- Leo, Franklin's down again.
- I'm okay.

252
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,865
I'm okay. I'm okay.

253
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,450
Let's play some football!

254
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,478
Danny Bateman.

255
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,355
Shane Falco.

256
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:49,898
Nice pop, Danny.

257
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:51,817
Thanks, coach.

258
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,945
In practice, we don't hit the fellows
with the red shirts on.

259
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,241
I know, but I see that red
and I just want to go after it like a bull.

260
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:02,536
Okay, Danny.

261
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,204
Huddle up!

262
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:12,754
Get used to setting up on the run.
Move fast, think even faster.

263
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,841
- You'll live longer.
- I'm very interested in that.

264
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,134
Huddle up!

265
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:28,395
Hey! Shane Falco.

266
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:31,732
I lost a ton of money
on that Sugar Bowl of yours.

267
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,942
What a bloody shambles that was.

268
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,987
You could smell the stink
all the way back in Wales.

269
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,866
Nice meeting you.

270
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,116
Ready!

271
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:26,870
Ready!

272
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:43,804
Hut!

273
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:56,775
Shit! I forgot about the whole red
shirt thing! This game's confusing.

274
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,197
Remember...

275
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,908
...red means stop.

276
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,994
Like a streetlight, right?

277
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,788
- Yeah.
- Get on up.

278
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:13,876
Go ahead. I'm gonna lie here
a moment and collect my thoughts.

279
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,586
Work shit out, right?

280
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:25,721
- You should be glad he's on your side.
- Yeah.

281
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:39,067
- So you have a cheer or something?
- Are you ready?

282
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:42,487
"Let's hear it for the quarterback
Hey-hey, ho-ho

283
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:46,158
"Could anyone play better?
Say-say, no-no

- Thank you.

Can you dance?

Let me have some of that duck.

- What the hell is this?
- Chinese spareribs.

If you don't want it,
get the fuck out of here.

I'm trying to figure out
how the Chinaman over here...

298
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:42,965
...gets 700 pounds off of eating this shit.

299

I'm Japanese, not Chinese.

300

- Same difference.
- What?

301
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:48,804
It's the same difference!

302
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,764
All that big...

303
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,061
Nigger, please.

304
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,731
You do know Japan and China
are two different countries, right?

305

- You do know I got an atlas, bitch?
- Really, gangster?

Yeah.

We're on the same team! Now chill out!

- I'm not a mick! I'm bloody Welsh!

Whatever.

00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:49,072
Shit.

318
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:53,952
All I want to do is score one touchdown
before I hang up my pads. That's it.

319
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:55,913
You'll get it.

320
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:09,801
Hey, man.

321
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,180
Wilkinson! Earl Wilkinson!

322
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:17,601
I knew I recognized you, man! I knew it!

323
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:19,811
You played for Minnesota, baby!

324
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,732
Oh, shit! Earl Wilkinson, man!
Oh, my God!

325
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:27,778
You'd have been All-Pro
if you hadn't beat up them cops!

326
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:32,449
What I had meant to say was "allegedly"...

327
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:36,787
...allegedly beat up them cops
and because...

328
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:41,333
...a good Christian boy like you
would never do nothing like that!

329
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:43,126
That's right.

330
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:46,380
The way I heard it,
my man didn't even do nothing anyway!

331
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,966
Them cops were just jealous
of the black man.

332
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,802
Hear what I'm saying?
My boy's been living large!

333
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,305
I can't stand the cops!
I better not see a cop!

334
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:59,476
- I'll whip a cop's ass! Believe it!
- I'm a cop.

335
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,693
Look!

336
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,403
Bunt cake!

337
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:15,826
- Look at these yummy little monkeys!
- Hello!

338
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:17,244
Oh, hey.

339
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:20,998
Yeah.

340
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:26,253
- Are you Heather and Dawn?
- Yep, we sure are.

341
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,255
You don't know how excited I am...

342
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:31,758
...that I actually have some girls
with dance experience!

343
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:35,304
- I'm excited too!
- I know! Me too, too.

344
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:39,349
So, Heather, you were in Cats,
which is so terrific...

345
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,686
No, Pussycats.

346
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:45,939
You know, the club next to the airport?
Pussycats.

347
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:53,030
- That style of dancing would be...
- Is lap-dancing a style?

348
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:54,990
No. I mean...

349
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:58,202
Oh, my God, I forgot to tell you something.

350
00:26:58,368 --> 00:26:59,453
What?

351
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,289
She always does that.

352
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,753
I've seen all I need to see.

353
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,589
No way! I'm so excited!

354
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:11,757
Go suit up.

355
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:15,052
- Go down the tunnel and to the left.
- Okay.

356
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:21,225
If you guys have any friends down
at the club, would you send them over?

357
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:24,561
- Sure.
- Yeah, absolutely.

358
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:27,147
Where are you going, Number 48?

359
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:40,244
I was watching you today.

360
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:42,412
You looked good.

361
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:46,124
Good release, strong arm.
You're gonna do fine.

362
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,376
Thanks.

363
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,253
I'm Annabelle Farrell.

364
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:51,171
- Shane Falco.
- I know.

365
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,550
I remember you
from the '96 Sugar Bowl game.

366
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:57,427
Didn't anybody have anything
better to do that day?

367
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:01,849
You should get some help
to turn this back over.

368
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:05,978
Yeah, I was thinking
I'd call AAA later or something.

369
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:11,608
- Do you want a lift?
- Yeah.

370
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:14,653
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.

371
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:21,743
Why'd you stay in the pocket at practice?

372
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:24,496
I don't comment to quarterbacks
about style but...

373
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:28,167
...you need to keep scrambling
against Detroit, with Prescott back.

374
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,170
- Prescott hasn't crossed.
- He will on Sunday.

375
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:34,131
- It's a secret so you can't prepare.
- How do you know?

376
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:36,967
My friend's a cheerleader for Detroit.
She tipped me.

377
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:39,720
He's left-sided,
shotgun formation, roll right.

378
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:41,680
Van Gundy's on the right.

379
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:44,766
He's been All-Pro two years,
but one of my cheerleaders...

380
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,269
...is friends with a girl
who broke up with him.

381
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:49,855
He's been drinking ever since she left him.

382
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,151
He's hung over! He's a good second
slower off the snap than usual.

383
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,903
I'll stick to the right side.

384
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,697
Unless what they say
about Martinez is true.

385
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:04,328
- That was fun.
- This is great! You live out here?

386
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,330
Which one's yours?

387
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:09,917
Here. You see that white yacht
with the satellite dish?

388
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:14,421
I'm the old houseboat next to it,
covered in seagull shit.

389
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:17,341
What did you name her?

390
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,009
Phyxsius.

391
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:22,930
- Phyxsius, what does that mean?
- "Putting to flight. "

392
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:27,893
You want to come onboard for a beer?

393
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:32,606
Nothing personal,
but I don't date football players.

394
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:34,566
I don't blame you.

395
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:36,318
Not even quarterbacks?

396
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:41,073
Especially not quarterbacks.
You guys are the biggest babies of all.

397
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,033
The biggest babies?

398
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:44,535
Yeah.

399
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:48,205
- Thanks for the ride.
- Good luck on Sunday.

400
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,750
- Be careful out there.
- I will.

401
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:03,595
Shane.

402
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:05,722
What's up?

403
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:07,891
Just...

404
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:10,435
...watching the game.

405
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,231
Nervous?

406
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:16,525
No.

407
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,277
I'm good.

408
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:21,572
Like a duck on a pond.

409
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:24,575
On the surface everything looks calm,
but...

410
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:28,245
...beneath the water, those feet
are churning a mile a minute.

411
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:30,914
You'll be fine.

412
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:34,626
Find a way to lead your team.
Earn their respect.

413
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:36,545
Yeah.

414
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:40,591
How are you doing?

415
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:42,634
Me?

416
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:46,847
I'm just another duck on the pond.

417
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:51,560
Coach, can I ask you a question?

418
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:55,606
- Yeah, shoot.
- Why me?

419
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:01,778
I look at you and I see two men...

420
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:04,990
...the man you are,
and the man you ought to be.

421
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:07,534
Someday, those two will meet.

422
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:10,579
Should make for a hell of a football player.

423
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,085
Get some sleep, kiddo.

424
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,088
You play professional football tomorrow.

425
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:39,775
Welcome to Nextel Stadium,
in our nation's capital.

426
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,903
I'm Pat Summerall and with me,
as always, is John Madden.

427
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:47,074
Detroit bought an entire semi-pro team
once the strike happened.

428
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:49,952
Washington is going with
a bunch of unknowns.

429
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,371
Although we'll see a few guys
we know today.

430
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:56,250
Like Shane Falco, that talented quarterback
who fell out of sight...

431
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,961
...after a disastrous showing
in the Sugar Bowl.

432
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:07,636
Having a little snacky-poo
before the game?

433
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:11,431
- It does the body good.
- You are one crazy son of a bitch.

434
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:13,684
- You know how I know that?
- How?

435
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,687
Only a crazy son of a bitch
would eat eggs before a game!

436
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,230
I need to bulk up.

437
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:19,731
- You want one?
- No!

438
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,358
It's good for you.

439
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,579
Sentinels, listen up.

440
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:38,292
Welcome to professional football.

441
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:43,797
Some will say
that your accomplishments...

442
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:48,635
...will soon be forgotten, you're not
real players, this isn't a real team.

443
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:50,929
And I say that is bullshit!

444
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,684
Because, as of today,
you're all professional football players.

445
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:59,855
You're being paid to play.
I want you to remember that because...

446
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:03,650
...the men whose places you've taken
forgot that a long time ago.

447
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:06,028
Bring it in here.

448
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:07,946
Bring it in, guys.

449
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:10,407
Let's play some football!

450
00:33:10,616 --> 00:33:12,326
- D.C.
- All right!

451
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:15,204
For some of these players,
this is another shot...

452
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:17,414
...and a last shot for a guy like Falco.

453
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,958
Remember that beating he took
from Florida?

454
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:25,589
That's nothing compared to those beatings
he took in Seattle.

455
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:29,092
One thing we do know
is that Falco can take a hit.

456
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:32,888
Well, I'll tell you,
he's sure had a lot of practice at it.

457
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:43,732
Ladies and gentlemen,
your Washington Sentinels!

458
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:52,449
- Did you see that?
- That's a pretty good hit.

459
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:58,080
Will the medical trainers
please report to the east tunnel?

460
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,920
Maybe he was a little overanxious, huh?

461
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:11,260
And now,
the rest of the Washington Sentinels.

462
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:34,241
Kick-off!

463
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,876
Not bad, let's go!

464
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:49,423
There can only be one leader
out there, all right? You be it.

465
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:01,643
- That's where I stand.
- No, it's not.

466
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:04,188
- That's my spot in the huddle.
- It's not.

467
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:07,065
- Get to your spot.
- Let's go, chopstick!

468
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:09,735
Let's play football! What do you say?

469
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:18,827
- It's my spot now!
- Not for long, you tub of rice shit!

470
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:20,412
What's the problem?

471
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:22,623
You can't do jack shit!

472
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:26,001
- Pork rice!
- I'm Japanese, not Chinese!

473
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,753
Don't mess with my brother.

474
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:29,421
What's going on?

475
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:32,591
Something seems to be going on
in the huddle.

476
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,595
Falco's on his back.

477
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,306
They haven't had a play yet
and Falco's down.

478
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:43,685
He got hit by his own guy! He was
looking out his earhole for a minute!

479
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:45,479
This isn't a good sign.

480
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:50,025
- Am I hurt already?
- Your partner knocked your head off.

481
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:51,527
Let's go.

482
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:55,280
Come on, get it together!

483
00:35:57,282 --> 00:36:00,869
I'm the quarterback.
I'm the only one who talks in the huddle.

484
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:03,247
- But he was in my spot.
- I don't give a shit!

485
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,540
Now huddle up.

486
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:13,924
If you've got something to say,
raise your hand.

487
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:15,551
Is that understood?

488
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:20,138
Suppose you don't feel good,
or you're hurt.

489
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:22,432
Tell me before the huddle starts. Okay?

490
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:24,601
Okay, here we go.

491
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,896
DC Right, Switch, 25 Blast.

492
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:30,274
What?

493
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:32,442
- That's to the left?
- The right.

494
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:33,735
To the left!

495
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:39,283
Be quiet or they'll hear us, and then what?

496
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,371
Play game!

497
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,583
Number 16 on the offense! Five yards!

498
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:50,169
Well Pat, so far the Sentinels...

499
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:53,297
...have minus 10 yards offensively.

500
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:57,009
I've seen monkey-shit fights
at the zoo more organized than this!

501
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:02,764
DC Right, Pro, 424 Tomahawk,
on one, on one. Ready?

502
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:12,941
Ready?

503
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:17,112
I'm coming for you, Footsteps!

504
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:21,241
Green 22!

505
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,160
Hut! Hut!

506
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:27,122
Come on, Shane!

507
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:34,379
You could hear Falco's fillings
drop all the way up here!

508
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:38,467
Detroit takes over the football
with excellent field position.

509
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:40,219
Give me an S!

510
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:41,929
Give me an E!

511
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:43,597
Give me an N!

512
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,224
Give me a T!

513
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:46,475
Give me an... "

514
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,227
I! "

515
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:51,605
We'll get them next time.

516
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:59,029
Eagle over, cover four!

517
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:00,572
On three, get ready!

518
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:05,661
All day, blue eyes!
It's Christmas morning...

519
00:38:05,828 --> 00:38:08,497
...and Santa's coming down the chimney!

520
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:12,417
I'm gonna bury your family!
I'm gonna bury your dog!

521
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:14,837
Champ, champ!

522
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,051
Now that's football!

523
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:22,886
You get it? You like it?

524
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:29,393
The Sentinels have set a record
for penalties in the first three minutes!

525
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:33,480
- We're still waiting for the stats on that.
- Personal foul!

526
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:38,360
Number 56 on the defense!
Half the distance to the goal!

527
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:41,071
Bateman on that one.
That was just a cheap shot.

528
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,325
- That should be worse than a penalty.
- They're walking right through us!

529
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:51,540
Touchdown, Detroit!

530
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:58,130
Don't worry about it.

531
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,355
Let's go!

532
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:22,738
Double-slot Zag, okay?

533
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,990
- What?
- I don't feel too good.

534
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,201
- Suck it up.
- Come on!

535
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:29,161
Jesus Christ!

536
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:35,542
- Eggs!
- That's ripe!

537
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:39,213
What'd you eat, man?

538
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:42,216
If we don't move,
I'm going to blow chow, too.

539
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:46,386
We're in a huddle! Double-slot zag, 88...

540
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:49,806
Jesus!

541
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:51,808
Goddamn!

542
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:55,896
I tried to tell you, I can't be around
somebody puking or I start puking.

543
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:57,606
Shit.

544
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:00,609
Okay, okay!

545
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:01,902
On three...

546
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:06,698
...everyone move left. Ready?
Hut, hut, hut.

547
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:12,538
What the hell is that?

548
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,623
What?

549
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,920
John, how many years have we been
calling games together?

550
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:21,213
Nineteen, I think.

551
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:23,131
Ever seen anything like that?

552
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:26,969
Not on a football field.

553
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:30,264
- What are they doing?
- Beats me.

554
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:34,852
Look at it this way. It's the first thing
we've done together as a team.

555
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:37,479
- Hey!
- Clean it up! Let's go!

556
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:38,897
Break!

557
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:54,705
Ready? Blue 42!

558
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,293
Blue 42!

559
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:01,879
Hut!

560
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:21,607
First down, Washington.

561
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:25,486
- Was it out of bounds?
- Yes, on 23.

562
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:30,616
- Blue Right, 60, X Post.
- Blue Right, 60, X Post!

563
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:32,826
Let's go, let's go!

564
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:35,329
Go, from four. Hut!

565
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,470
Now we're rolling!

566
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,348
Signs of life from Washington here.

567
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:58,810
That last completion by Falco
puts them back in field-goal range.

568
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:00,979
- Field goal, let's go!
- Field goal.

569
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:02,064
Nigel.

570
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:08,987
It's over the bar, not under.
Okay? Go get 'em.

571
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,199
- Hold that.
- Here comes the field-goal team.

572
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:15,869
A 40-yard attempt for kicker Nigel Gruff,
against the wind.

573
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:20,791
Here's a guy from Wales,
and he's kicking his first field goal ever.

574
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,835
This is a tough distance.

575
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:41,770
Yeah, she's there! She's there!

576
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:45,899
- Boom! Boom!
- Nigel Gruff kicks and scores!

577
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:50,612
Halftime score: Washington 3, Detroit 14.

578
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,919
That's the second time
a Washington player has been...

579
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:09,423
- ... knocked out by his own teammate.
- There's a rule in sports:

580
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:12,926
Don't do anything great if you can't handle
the congratulations.

581
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:14,928
- There is?
- Yup.

582
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:17,431
Give me an S!

583
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:19,266
Give me an E!

584
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:20,934
Give me an N!

585
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:22,728
Give me a T!

586
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:24,730
Give me a...

587
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:34,531
Watch the wheel!

588
00:43:41,497 --> 00:43:42,956
All right, let's go!

589
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,344
Touchdown, Smith! That one gets
the Sentinels back into the game.

590
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:58,430
This guy is a heck of a player,
but I don't know him.

591
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,683
According to the Sentinels,
it says Ray Smith is...

592
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:04,478
That's weird!
No college given, no high school.

593
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:07,731
Just says he's been a resident
of the State of Maryland...

594
00:44:07,814 --> 00:44:10,734
...for the last two years,
and he likes to embroider!

595
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:13,737
- He does some fancy work with the ball.
- Weird.

596
00:44:20,828 --> 00:44:21,995
Ready!

597
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:26,708
Green 11!

598
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:29,002
Green 11!

599
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:37,678
Falco's sacked and the ball comes loose.

600
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:40,848
It's Detroit's ball
with only a minute remaining.

601
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:43,517
Let's go! Let's go!

602
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:46,103
Danny, Danny.

603
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:48,438
I need that ball. Get me the ball.

604
00:44:48,689 --> 00:44:49,773
You need the ball.

605
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:51,483
- Get me the ball.
- The ball.

606
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:53,193
Are you gonna get me the ball?

607
00:44:58,115 --> 00:44:59,950
I hope he doesn't kill somebody.

608
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:03,912
I'm back! I'm back!

609
00:45:04,163 --> 00:45:05,706
Get the ball!

610
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:23,432
I got it!

611
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:26,268
Now that is all-Madden team!

612
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:28,103
- You're the man.
- I'm the man!

613
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:30,939
- You got me the ball.
- I got you the ball!

614
00:45:37,488 --> 00:45:39,490
- Go sit down now, Danny.
- Okay.

615
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,995
- Number 56 recovers the ball.
- Falco!

616
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:48,457
We've gotta pass.
It's gotta be in the end zone.

617
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:52,085
DC Right, Zig, 90 Eagle. You can do this.

618
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:54,671
All right? Let's do it! Come on!

619
00:46:08,602 --> 00:46:11,230
- Blue 25!
- Here comes the pain, baby!

620
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:13,816
Blue 25!

621
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:18,237
- Check!
- What are you doing?

622
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:19,655
Check!

623
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:23,408
Black 32!

624
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:25,494
- What?
- He's changing the play.

625
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:27,871
He's checking off the run.
I told him to pass!

626
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,794
Shit!

627
00:46:59,403 --> 00:47:02,656
Falco calls an audible
at the line of scrimmage...

628
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:06,660
...and Cochran almost has a touchdown!
What a heartbreaker for Washington.

629
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:18,672
Final score: Washington 10, Detroit 14.

630
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:22,176
If I'd wanted Cochran to have that ball,
I'd have called it that way.

631
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:23,969
- I read blitz.
- Bullshit.

632
00:47:24,136 --> 00:47:27,139
I put the game in your hands.
You got scared.

633
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:28,473
I read blitz.

634
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:36,023
Winners always want the ball
when the game's on the line.

635
00:48:12,976 --> 00:48:16,355
WFAN, the Sports Fan's Show.
How do you feel about the strike?

636
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:21,151
The fans are getting screwed. I've got
season tickets I can't give away!

637
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,030
- What about the replacement players?
- They're nobodies.

638
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:36,083
"At first I was afraid
I was petrified

639
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:40,254
"Kept thinkin' I could never live
without you by my side

640
00:48:40,462 --> 00:48:44,550
"But then I spent so many nights
Thinkin' how you did me wrong

641
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:45,843
"And I grew strong"

642
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:48,428
Why'd you play that dumb-ass song?

643
00:48:48,637 --> 00:48:51,223
I put on The Commodores.
That shit just came on.

644
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:54,226
Can somebody please cut that bullshit off?

645
00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:58,814
- We did the best we could do.
- You don't get points for trying.

646
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:01,441
Let's face it, boys,
we screwed the pooch today.

647
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:06,530
Hey, there they are!

648
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,240
Ladies and gentlemen...

649
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:11,493
...your Washington Sentinels!

650
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:18,750
He's the luckiest guy here. At least
he couldn't hear the booing today!

651
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,088
Hello! Anyone home? Did I hear an echo?

652
00:49:23,922 --> 00:49:26,633
Where'd McGinty get Rain Man?
The Special Olympics?

653
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:30,345
No wonder they couldn't win.
He can't even order a drink!

654
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:37,186
- Lay off.
- Lighten up.

655
00:49:37,394 --> 00:49:38,854
It's not like he can hear.

656
00:49:39,104 --> 00:49:40,147
I can.

657
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:46,695
What's that say?

658
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:51,617
"One good thing about being deaf,
you can ignore the assholes. "

659
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:55,829
You asshole.

660
00:49:57,581 --> 00:49:58,624
That's funny.

661
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:06,381
It's cool!

662
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:10,427
You had enough?

663
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:14,973
You've got shit for brains,
but you've got balls.

664
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,141
Thank you.

665
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:21,772
Danny, remember what I told you
about red shirts in practice?

666
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:22,481
Yeah.

667
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:24,399
- Forget about it.
- Okay.

668
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:25,776
Martel.

669
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:36,411
Who's the man? Who's the man?

670
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,205
Come on! Come on!

671
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:45,379
Come on, come on! Stop!

672
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:49,007
Let's play football, bitch!

673
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:56,181
We are all God's children here!

674
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:12,906
"And deliver thee into the hands
of brutish men"...

675
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:21,081
Ezekiel 21:31.

676
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:28,046
This is some more bullshit!

677
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:30,215
It's more of a homecoming for you.

678
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:32,301
You gonna be a funny man?

679
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:35,554
Bateman! Wilkinson!
Come on, guys, what are you doing?

680
00:51:36,763 --> 00:51:38,390
Can't we all just get along?

681
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:42,728
Come on.

682
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:46,231
Why are we the only ones in this jail?

683
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:49,735
- Simple. They're winners.
- Hell, no. Not tonight.

684
00:51:49,902 --> 00:51:53,530
That was pretty sweet,
you sitting on Wilson's head, Jumbo.

685
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:56,408
Thanks, Jamal.

686
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:05,000
He wasn't the only one
who kicked ass tonight.

687
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:07,503
You're the man tonight, Clifford Franklin!

688
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:10,255
What?

689
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:12,758
You were hiding behind the jukebox.
Wasn't he?

690
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:19,932
At first, I admit, I was afraid.

691
00:52:20,891 --> 00:52:23,894
- Shit, I was petrified.
- You were petrified?

692
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:26,855
"Thinkin' I could never live
without you by my side"

693
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:30,692
- The Lord is by your side.
- Have mercy.

694
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:35,405
"And then I spent so many nights
thinkin' how you did me wrong

695
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:39,159
"And I grew strong"

696
00:52:39,451 --> 00:52:41,703
You know I hate this damn song.

697
00:52:41,912 --> 00:52:44,748
"I learned how to get along
And so you're back

698
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:46,750
"from outer space

699
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:50,921
"I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face

700
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:55,008
"I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key

701
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:59,137
"If I'd have known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me

702
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:00,514
"Go on, now, go

703
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,766
"Walk out the door

704
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:07,146
"Just turn around now
'cause you're not welcome anymore"

705
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:08,564
Remember this?

706
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:11,441
"Weren't you the one
who tried to hurt me with goodbye?

707
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:16,113
"Did I crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

708
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,116
"Oh, no, not I
I will survive

709
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:23,912
"As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive

710
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:27,791
"I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give

711
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,793
"And I'll survive

712
00:53:30,169 --> 00:53:31,336
"I will survive

713
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:33,964
"Hey, hey!

714
00:53:49,271 --> 00:53:52,566
"It took all the strength I had
not to fall apart

715
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,862
"Kept tryin' hard to mend the pieces
of my broken heart

716
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:01,074
"And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself

717
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:05,162
"I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high

718
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:08,081
- "And you see me"
- Four, five!

719
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:11,335
Okay, all right.

720
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:16,882
Frankie.

721
00:54:22,304 --> 00:54:25,849
If anything like this bar fight
happens again...

722
00:54:26,058 --> 00:54:28,811
...there'll be no place
on the team for any of you.

723
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:33,273
- Do I make myself perfectly clear?
- Yes, sir.

724
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:35,526
Just for the record...

725
00:54:36,693 --> 00:54:40,030
...I would've loved to have seen
Martel get his ass kicked.

726
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:41,532
Let's get out of here!

727
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:50,624
Hey, Shane.

728
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:54,169
What are you doing?

729
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:55,796
My job.

730
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,634
- You're a professional football player.
- Sure, this week.

731
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:03,387
When that's all over, you know...

732
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:07,182
...I'll be back here.
I don't want to lose my customers.

733
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:11,812
I was on my way to work.
Do you need a ride?

734
00:55:12,104 --> 00:55:13,272
I'm good.

735
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:17,568
- I got my truck back.
- How is it?

736
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:21,488
Flatter. But it runs.

737
00:55:23,615 --> 00:55:26,785
And you?
How are you running after last night?

738
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:30,080
You heard about that?

739
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,541
I think the whole town heard about that.

740
00:55:32,749 --> 00:55:34,960
Is that from the game or the fight?

741
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:39,256
I'm not sure. It's all blurred
into one big beating.

742
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,093
The good news is,
you guys got into a rhythm...

743
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:46,847
...apart from that vomiting thing,
which was on Sports Center.

744
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:48,473
Oh, God.

745
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:51,560
After that, the team was really clicking.

746
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,564
Yeah, it was starting to come together.

747
00:55:55,814 --> 00:55:56,815
Yeah.

748
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:01,570
- You want to sit down?
- No, I should go.

749
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:04,615
Thanks for coming by.

750
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:08,577
- Wow. Ow.
- What?

751
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:10,329
Oh! Ow!

752
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:12,122
Jesus!

753
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:15,083
- It looks worse than it feels.
- It looks like hell.

754
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:19,046
- Then it looks exactly like it feels.
- Here.

755
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:23,300
Wild yam?

756
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:24,635
Yeah.

757
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:30,182
Don't laugh, it works.
It's great for sore muscles and bruises.

758
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:33,852
- I use it all the time.
- You don't have to do that.

759
00:56:34,144 --> 00:56:37,981
Will you put it on? You can barely move.
This will be a little bit...

760
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:40,734
- Cold!
- Sorry, sorry.

761
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:44,029
Here, your shoulders.

762
00:56:47,616 --> 00:56:48,700
Better?

763
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:50,202
Better.

764
00:57:00,337 --> 00:57:02,714
You're the first player I can remember...

765
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:05,592
...who cares more about his teammates
than himself.

766
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:10,889
That's something this team's been
missing for a really long time.

767
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:14,560
It's a good thing you did last night.

768
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:16,603
It was just stupid.

769
00:57:20,107 --> 00:57:21,275
Thanks.

770
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:28,031
- I'm gonna be late for work.
- Practice?

771
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:29,658
No, actually, I have work.

772
00:57:30,075 --> 00:57:33,996
We only make $50 a game.
Gotta pay the bills, right?

773
00:57:34,246 --> 00:57:37,666
Mac's, down on A Street.
Come in, I'll buy you a beer.

774
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:39,793
All right, I'll do that.

775
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,007
Keep putting that yam on.

776
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,067
Guys!

777
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:14,244
You gotta be kidding.

778
00:58:14,703 --> 00:58:16,497
I didn't park in your space.

779
00:58:16,747 --> 00:58:18,624
No, no.

780
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:21,710
But, unfortunately,
you did park in Lamont's space.

781
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:26,965
- He's not nearly as lenient as I am.
- On three, fellas.

782
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:38,185
- We got this. We got this.
- You want to put the car back?

783
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:40,229
This is none of your business.

784
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:42,272
Shane is our business.

785
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:45,359
- We're the guards.
- And we protect our quarterback.

786
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:51,490
This is funny to them bozos.
You got a joke? You got a joke?

787
00:58:51,907 --> 00:58:54,201
That's your ride right there, ain't it?

788
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:56,036
Yeah.

789
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:03,210
That's my windshield!

790
00:59:03,377 --> 00:59:05,629
- Now, put the car back.
- Son of a bitch!

791
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:07,798
Son of a...

792
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:11,677
Oh, son of a bitch? I'm a son of a bitch?

793
00:59:13,929 --> 00:59:15,472
Stop, stop!

794
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:17,224
Come on, goddamn it, help me!

795
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,102
You're gonna pay for this!

796
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:24,439
No, I'm not. Stop messing
with my man, that includes his ride.

797
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:26,024
And wax that motherfucker.

798
00:59:26,608 --> 00:59:28,485
Give it a tune-up, too.

799
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:31,864
Ready to go to practice?

800
00:59:32,531 --> 00:59:34,241
Yeah, let's do that.

801
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:36,827
- How's that arm?
- Good.

802
00:59:37,536 --> 00:59:38,787
What's that smell?

803
00:59:39,163 --> 00:59:40,330
Wild yam.

804
00:59:40,706 --> 00:59:42,916
- That's nice.
- You like that?

805
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:48,547
And so, boys and girls,
if anybody does have any firearms...

806
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:51,341
...you need to turn them in
as soon as possible.

807
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:52,926
No questions asked.

808
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:55,721
Understood?

809
01:00:02,352 --> 01:00:03,103
All right.

810
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:06,106
Okay, coach, it's all yours.

811
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:17,618
Last Sunday, I saw a team on the field
play as hard as they could...

812
01:00:17,868 --> 01:00:19,745
...to win the football game.

813
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:23,916
We lost. Not because of effort or desire...

814
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:28,378
...but because of lack of leadership
and trust. One's been resolved.

815
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:32,216
But leadership means nothing
if a team doesn't believe in each other.

816
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:36,094
Players spend years together
before they develop trust.

817
01:00:36,345 --> 01:00:39,932
I'm asking you to do it in a week,
not a reasonable request, but...

818
01:00:40,098 --> 01:00:42,392
...these aren't reasonable times.

819
01:00:43,268 --> 01:00:47,314
I know you all have concerns
about this Sunday.

820
01:00:50,943 --> 01:00:52,402
But a real man...

821
01:00:55,948 --> 01:00:57,282
...admits his fears.

822
01:00:59,785 --> 01:01:02,079
I'm asking you to do that here, tonight.

823
01:01:04,623 --> 01:01:06,083
Who wants to start?

824
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:07,835
Let's talk about fears.

825
01:01:08,585 --> 01:01:09,962
Fears.

826
01:01:15,843 --> 01:01:18,136
I'm scared of spiders, coach.

827
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:23,517
- That's not what I meant.
- I'm afraid of spiders, too.

828
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:26,562
Goddamn spiders freak me, too, fellas.

829
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,439
Well, I didn't mean that.

830
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:32,734
Ever get one of those spiders
crawling up your arm?

831
01:01:32,943 --> 01:01:34,820
- Crawling on you?
- Damn!

832
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:38,323
Thanks, Jumbo. You can just
rock me to sleep tonight.

833
01:01:39,575 --> 01:01:44,288
Okay, that's great, but I'm talking
about what scares us on the field.

834
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:47,207
Like spiders on the field?

835
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:50,377
Can we get beyond the spiders, please?

836
01:01:52,004 --> 01:01:52,838
Bees.

837
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:54,673
Bees?

838
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:56,300
- Bees?
- Bees.

839
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:02,014
Anybody here afraid
of anything other than insects?

840
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:03,724
Come on.

841
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:05,851
Quicksand.

842
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:10,397
Shit, yeah!
Quicksand's a scary mother, man.

843
01:02:10,606 --> 01:02:14,026
It sucks you right in and even
if you scream, you get that muck...

844
01:02:14,234 --> 01:02:16,028
I don't think that's it.

845
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:19,573
That's not what he had in mind.

846
01:02:19,948 --> 01:02:22,493
- What's he talking about, then?
- Ask him.

847
01:02:25,662 --> 01:02:26,747
What's up, Shane?

848
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:31,001
You're playing...

849
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:35,881
...and you think everything is going fine.
But then one thing goes wrong...

850
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:37,216
...and another...

851
01:02:38,509 --> 01:02:39,760
...and another.

852
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:44,556
You try to fight back, but the harder
you fight, the deeper you sink.

853
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,767
Until you can't move.

854
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:50,145
You can't breathe...

855
01:02:51,897 --> 01:02:53,941
...because you're in over your head...

856
01:02:55,901 --> 01:02:57,152
...like quicksand.

857
01:03:04,493 --> 01:03:07,663
That's some deep shit.

858
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,126
Anything else you're afraid of?

859
01:03:14,795 --> 01:03:17,256
- Going back to the mini-mart.
- The shipping yard.

860
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:18,590
The auto plant.

861
01:03:19,258 --> 01:03:20,425
Prison.

862
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,719
Yeah, all right.

863
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:30,310
The truth is,
you guys have been given something...

864
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:32,396
...that every athlete dreams of:

865
01:03:33,772 --> 01:03:35,566
A second chance.

866
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:37,985
And you're afraid of blowing it.

867
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:39,945
We all are.

868
01:03:40,112 --> 01:03:43,031
But now our fear is shared
and we can overcome it together.

869
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:47,035
Let's lose that fear this Sunday
and put it into San Diego!

870
01:03:47,786 --> 01:03:48,954
Come on!

871
01:03:58,547 --> 01:04:01,300
Another vicious hit
by the All-Pro Hank Morris.

872
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:03,260
That's his third of the game.

873
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:05,137
It's just me, dickhead.

874
01:04:05,304 --> 01:04:08,390
I tell you,
he is really putting a hurt on Falco.

875
01:04:08,724 --> 01:04:11,477
I'm not sure how much more
of this abuse he can take.

876
01:04:12,978 --> 01:04:14,354
Huddle up!

877
01:04:14,563 --> 01:04:15,939
Huddle up!

878
01:04:17,816 --> 01:04:21,069
Same play, except let Morris by.
Nobody touch him.

879
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:24,490
- It's 16-0 already.
- I said let him through!

880
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:30,078
Get some penetration, Morris!
Get some penetration!

881
01:04:30,287 --> 01:04:32,080
Blue 88!

882
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:46,970
Now, that is a hit!

883
01:04:51,225 --> 01:04:52,226
Holy shit!

884
01:04:52,351 --> 01:04:55,604
Let's haul ass, round boy!
Follow me! Follow me!

885
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:02,402
Holy shit!

886
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:06,740
Go!

887
01:05:07,533 --> 01:05:08,700
Jump on his back!

888
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:11,495
Here it comes! I'm coming through!

889
01:05:12,454 --> 01:05:13,539
Jump on his back!

890
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:20,671
Fumiko scores!

891
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:23,215
I love to see a fat guy score!

892
01:05:23,423 --> 01:05:24,758
Why?

893
01:05:24,967 --> 01:05:29,012
Because you get a fat-guy spike,
and then you get a fat-guy dance.

894
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:33,934
Pork rice!

895
01:05:39,189 --> 01:05:40,816
That's not in the playbook.

896
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:42,901
Yeah.

897
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,237
Maybe we should put it in.

898
01:05:48,866 --> 01:05:50,242
Kick-off!

899
01:06:20,481 --> 01:06:24,067
So, Annabelle, what do you, like,
think of our friends?

900
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:26,445
I think...

901
01:06:27,488 --> 01:06:28,947
...they're friendly.

902
01:06:29,573 --> 01:06:30,824
I know! Aren't they?

903
01:06:31,325 --> 01:06:32,659
Yeah.

904
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:46,465
We'll stretch them right here.

905
01:06:50,761 --> 01:06:52,304
Green 95!

906
01:06:54,807 --> 01:06:55,808
Green...

907
01:06:57,518 --> 01:06:58,602
...95!

908
01:06:58,811 --> 01:06:59,812
What the hell?

909
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:10,030
Start the ball! Get the ball off!

910
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:13,659
Hold the play clock.

911
01:07:18,956 --> 01:07:20,999
Start the ball on the play clock.

912
01:07:28,298 --> 01:07:30,425
False start on the offense.

913
01:07:30,676 --> 01:07:34,179
Number 72, Number 77, Number 60...

914
01:07:34,429 --> 01:07:37,432
...Number 61, Number 87 and Number 53.

915
01:07:37,641 --> 01:07:38,892
Five yards.

916
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:40,978
Still first down.

917
01:07:41,228 --> 01:07:45,274
That's bullshit! The one girl slapped
the other girl on the ass, Jimmy.

918
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:46,650
You're killing me!

919
01:07:47,151 --> 01:07:49,862
You want to see mine?
I got something for you.

920
01:07:57,494 --> 01:07:59,538
- Here we go.
- Don't throw it!

921
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:10,132
Damn it! They did it again!

922
01:08:11,341 --> 01:08:14,052
Ray Smith with the interception.

923
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:16,388
First down, Washington.

924
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:20,726
- Nice going!
- You're killing me!

925
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:23,061
- Defense, get out there!
- Let's go.

926
01:08:25,856 --> 01:08:28,567
Stop her from shaking her ass
for two minutes!

927
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:31,111
98 Shake.

928
01:08:31,528 --> 01:08:32,529
98 Shake!

929
01:08:37,284 --> 01:08:38,619
Green 99!

930
01:09:00,849 --> 01:09:01,934
Not bad, Falco.

931
01:09:05,145 --> 01:09:07,439
Touchdown, Brian Murphy.

932
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:13,570
Everybody in the stadium knows
that an onside kick is coming...

933
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:15,739
...with 55 seconds left on the clock.

934
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:20,202
With just 55 seconds left,
Washington has to recover the ball...

935
01:09:20,452 --> 01:09:24,206
...call a time-out fast, so Gruff
will have a shot at a field goal.

936
01:09:30,671 --> 01:09:32,381
Big Bateman ends up with the ball!

937
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:33,715
Danny, go down!

938
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:36,343
No one's gonna tackle him.

939
01:09:36,593 --> 01:09:38,053
He's reversing his field!

940
01:09:38,262 --> 01:09:40,055
He's forgot the clock's running out.

941
01:09:40,305 --> 01:09:42,766
Well, he's trying to run out the clock.

942
01:09:43,183 --> 01:09:46,270
Danny, go down!
You're using up the clock!

943
01:09:48,772 --> 01:09:50,315
You won't see that every day.

944
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:51,984
Time out! Time out!

945
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:55,571
Nice hit, Shane!

946
01:09:57,447 --> 01:09:58,532
What do you think?

947
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:01,326
We don't stop the clock, it's over.

948
01:10:01,577 --> 01:10:03,120
Give me a chance, I'm bored.

949
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:06,623
You're looking at a 65-yard field goal.

950
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:10,669
You just hold it,
and I'll kick the bloody piss out of it.

951
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:14,214
What the hell?

952
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:15,632
What the hell!

953
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:17,467
Field goal!

954
01:10:24,808 --> 01:10:29,104
McGinty's gonna let Gruff
try this field goal from 65 yards out!

955
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:31,356
I don't know if he has enough leg.

956
01:10:31,565 --> 01:10:33,275
I think he's smoking on the field.

957
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:35,903
Smoking? I'm sure you just imagined that.

958
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:39,114
No, I saw the smoke and everything.

959
01:10:51,668 --> 01:10:53,378
Vito! Look who's on TV!

960
01:10:53,629 --> 01:10:56,965
He wants to keep his pub,
he's gonna stop blowing some kicks!

961
01:10:58,175 --> 01:10:59,676
I'm telling you, that's him.

962
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:28,705
It's straight enough.
If it's got the distance...

963
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:32,292
It has the distance! It's good!
Washington wins!

964
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:39,091
The 65-yard field-goal attempt
is good by Nigel Gruff.

965
01:11:42,344 --> 01:11:47,349
Final score: Washington 17, San Diego 16.

966
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:57,401
- You're the man!
- Oh, bollocks!

967
01:12:01,196 --> 01:12:02,197
Come here!

968
01:12:06,243 --> 01:12:08,370
Sorry, man. Sorry, excuse me.

969
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:11,915
All right. Good game.
We snuck by on that one.

970
01:12:12,207 --> 01:12:13,584
- I'll take it.
- All right.

971
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:16,378
I'll take it. Congrats.

972
01:12:20,841 --> 01:12:23,218
- What do you think of the new team?
- It's great!

973
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:24,928
These guys are like us.

974
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:28,390
This strike ain't about guys like me.
It's about them superstars...

975
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,060
...who want $8 million
instead of $7 million. To hell with them.

976
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:36,315
This is the most fun I've had
in football in years. Go Falco!

977
01:12:37,858 --> 01:12:40,736
All right. Let's go, baby, let's go!

978
01:12:40,986 --> 01:12:44,907
- I love you, Annabelle.
- I know you do, Alan. We're closed.

979
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:47,784
Oh, hey!

980
01:12:48,619 --> 01:12:50,579
- You can come in.
- Come on in, buddy!

981
01:12:50,787 --> 01:12:52,247
You go.

982
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:53,874
Out, out!

983
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:55,292
You're Shane Falco.

984
01:12:56,168 --> 01:12:59,713
- Way to go. You guys kick ass!
- Thanks.

985
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:03,133
- Way to go.
- Bye! Take care.

986
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:05,093
Hi.

987
01:13:06,136 --> 01:13:09,807
Sure it's okay? I don't want to get you
in trouble with your boss.

988
01:13:11,934 --> 01:13:13,727
No, she won't mind.

989
01:13:14,102 --> 01:13:15,938
Come on in. You want a beer?

990
01:13:16,271 --> 01:13:17,314
Sure.

991
01:13:18,607 --> 01:13:22,361
We were so tight.
We had so much fun in here.

992
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:25,781
Since I was five years old,
I've been sitting on those stools.

993
01:13:27,449 --> 01:13:30,744
And then after he died, I took over.

994
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,580
Is that you and him?

995
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:37,125
Yeah.

996
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:41,213
He was the biggest Washington fan
you have ever seen.

997
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:45,509
Other kids got bedtime stories,
I got football stories.

998
01:13:49,513 --> 01:13:51,473
He used to talk all the time...

999
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:54,977
...about the glory days of football.

1000
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:57,020
Said how they were...

1001
01:13:57,229 --> 01:13:58,981
...gone forever.

1002
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:03,443
I wish he was here to see you guys play.

1003
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:07,322
- I don't know about that.
- I do.

1004
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:08,740
Good game today.

1005
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:10,242
Thanks.

1006
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:25,007
It's late.

1007
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:27,134
Yeah.

1008
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:31,805
Us babies need our rest.

1009
01:14:32,097 --> 01:14:33,557
Yeah, you do.

1010
01:14:33,765 --> 01:14:36,768
I'm sorry, but between the guys
on the field...

1011
01:14:36,852 --> 01:14:39,938
...and the guys in the bar,
a girl's gotta keep her guard up.

1012
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:41,190
Yeah, I imagine.

1013
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,816
Yeah.

1014
01:14:45,527 --> 01:14:47,654
You coming to the game on Sunday?

1015
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:50,032
No, we don't travel with the team.

1016
01:14:53,911 --> 01:14:56,455
Can I see you when I get back?

1017
01:14:59,082 --> 01:15:00,083
Sure.

1018
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:06,673
Good night, Annabelle.

1019
01:15:08,091 --> 01:15:09,343
Good night.

1020
01:15:55,264 --> 01:15:58,684
- What do you do here, John?
- You go for it. You have to.

1021
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:03,438
But Falco's been shut down
by this defense all afternoon.

1022
01:16:07,151 --> 01:16:09,444
But I'll tell you this, all it takes...

1023
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:13,115
...is one big play to get him back
in the ball game.

1024
01:16:15,826 --> 01:16:18,120
And here goes Falco.

1025
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:31,592
Falco scores! Falco scores!

1026
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:42,603
Here's Falco. He'll try to reverse pivot,
turn and pitch out here.

1027
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:46,940
But in doing so, his left guard,
André Jackson, is going to pull...

1028
01:16:47,149 --> 01:16:50,027
...and Falco will hit him
with the ball in the back.

1029
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:52,946
Then it's gonna flop around the ground.

1030
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:56,658
Here comes Cochran, he'll kick it.
Franklin's gonna pick it up.

1031
01:16:56,867 --> 01:16:59,161
Franklin's gonna get hit right here.

1032
01:17:00,162 --> 01:17:04,458
The ball will go flying in the air.
Falco will pick it up...

1033
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:07,628
...and the guy who started the play, Falco...

1034
01:17:07,836 --> 01:17:10,589
...will end up with it
in the end zone for a touchdown!

1035
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:13,759
- Welcome to strike football.
- And the fabulous Falco.

1036
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:15,886
If they can win against Dallas...

1037
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:20,140
...they'll do what Washington
hasn't done in over seven years:

1038
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:21,558
Get to the playoffs.

1039
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:33,445
Call time out! Time out!

1040
01:17:33,612 --> 01:17:34,613
Time out!

1041
01:17:35,405 --> 01:17:37,533
Time out Washington.

1042
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:40,244
Franklin, come here, come here, come on.

1043
01:17:40,452 --> 01:17:41,453
I thought I had it...

1044
01:17:41,578 --> 01:17:43,789
Shut up. Give me the Stick 'em.

1045
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:48,377
- That's illegal.
- Think you'll go to football jail?

1046
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:51,255
Now, you know this don't look natural.

1047
01:17:51,421 --> 01:17:55,300
Don't talk. We'll run the same play.
You'll catch the ball.

1048
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:57,845
I look like I just jacked off an elephant!

1049
01:17:58,095 --> 01:17:59,429
Say you understand.

1050
01:18:00,347 --> 01:18:01,348
I understand.

1051
01:18:01,557 --> 01:18:04,726
Go out there and catch the ball
for a change, all right?

1052
01:18:11,692 --> 01:18:13,986
Damn! This cup is stuck!

1053
01:18:14,653 --> 01:18:16,780
Gonna need some time on this one.

1054
01:18:16,989 --> 01:18:20,075
Here we go. Same play.
Pro Right, Switch 9...

1055
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:21,785
Franklin!

1056
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:24,413
I can't get the damn cup off!

1057
01:18:25,038 --> 01:18:26,582
You can do this.

1058
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:30,043
It's one on one. Ready?

1059
01:18:39,178 --> 01:18:40,804
Ready!

1060
01:18:41,054 --> 01:18:42,514
Blue 89!

1061
01:18:42,764 --> 01:18:44,224
Blue 89!

1062
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:02,576
Franklin catches the ball!

1063
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:05,662
Who would've thought?
He never catches a ball.

1064
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:07,539
But he caught the ball!

1065
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:10,083
That makes the score 21 to 20.

1066
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:14,046
Conventional wisdom says
kick the extra point, tie the game...

1067
01:19:14,296 --> 01:19:17,799
...and go into overtime.
Especially with the playoffs on the line.

1068
01:19:18,008 --> 01:19:21,970
But Jimmy McGinty is anything
but a conventional guy.

1069
01:19:22,179 --> 01:19:23,931
And McGinty says, "Go for it. "

1070
01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:25,682
Let's go for the win!

1071
01:19:27,434 --> 01:19:29,853
I need a receiver!

1072
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:33,607
4-22 Y Cross, okay? We gotta have it!

1073
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:42,115
Ready? Go! Ready!

1074
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:50,958
This kind of situation has not been
Falco's strong point in the past.

1075
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:53,502
Falco rolls to his left and throws...

1076
01:19:54,878 --> 01:19:57,589
...right into the defender's hands.

1077
01:19:57,798 --> 01:20:01,718
And he drops it right into the unsure hands
of Clifford Franklin!

1078
01:20:01,927 --> 01:20:03,178
Washington wins!

1079
01:20:03,387 --> 01:20:07,307
What a lucky break for Shane Falco,
who threw a bad pass...

1080
01:20:07,558 --> 01:20:09,935
...that could've blown the game
for Washington.

1081
01:20:25,409 --> 01:20:26,785
Get over it.

1082
01:20:26,994 --> 01:20:28,453
It's a win.

1083
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:30,831
Better lucky than good?

1084
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:32,457
Right.

1085
01:20:41,008 --> 01:20:42,384
Shane Falco.

1086
01:20:42,634 --> 01:20:45,179
- Great game out there today.
- Thanks.

1087
01:20:45,429 --> 01:20:49,475
To what do you attribute this team's
sudden rise over these past few weeks?

1088
01:20:49,683 --> 01:20:53,479
You know, you should talk to Franklin.
He's the hero today.

1089
01:20:54,521 --> 01:20:56,565
Clifford Franklin. Terrific day today.

1090
01:20:56,773 --> 01:20:59,526
Yeah, today was a good day
for Clifford Franklin.

1091
01:20:59,693 --> 01:21:01,904
Clifford Franklin can't wait till tomorrow.

1092
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:04,698
Clifford Franklin gets better looking
every day.

1093
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:09,495
We're beginning to scratch the surface
of the talents of Clifford Franklin.

1094
01:21:09,745 --> 01:21:12,998
Clifford Franklin has moves even
Clifford Franklin ain't seen yet.

1095
01:21:13,749 --> 01:21:16,543
You showed us a few moves
today against Phoenix...

1096
01:21:16,668 --> 01:21:19,296
...but it could be a different story
against Dallas.

1097
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:21,840
That's the same story, different chapter.

1098
01:21:22,007 --> 01:21:25,886
The football is like a one-man cold
to Clifford Franklin.

1099
01:21:26,136 --> 01:21:30,265
Clifford Franklin's the only one catching it
and coming down with it.

1100
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:38,899
Cheers, babe.

1101
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:41,109
I think we got it.

1102
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:44,905
To victory!

1103
01:21:46,323 --> 01:21:49,743
Feels good, doesn't it?
One game away from the playoffs?

1104
01:21:49,993 --> 01:21:53,914
And the hunt? That ring's so close
you can almost feel it on your finger.

1105
01:21:54,164 --> 01:21:55,958
- What are you up to?
- What?

1106
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:59,628
I can't get excited about the future
of my team?

1107
01:22:01,046 --> 01:22:04,133
Okay, I got some great news.

1108
01:22:04,341 --> 01:22:07,511
Martel and Carr have crossed
the picket line.

1109
01:22:08,137 --> 01:22:11,723
With the deal I made them swallow,
I can't afford not to take them back.

1110
01:22:11,932 --> 01:22:13,016
No.

1111
01:22:13,517 --> 01:22:14,893
No what?

1112
01:22:15,853 --> 01:22:17,729
I'm sticking with Falco.

1113
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:19,731
Jimmy, come on.

1114
01:22:20,107 --> 01:22:21,817
Have you read the newspaper?

1115
01:22:23,193 --> 01:22:26,196
The entire Dallas team
has crossed the picket line.

1116
01:22:26,446 --> 01:22:28,824
Thanksgiving night
we play the world champions.

1117
01:22:29,533 --> 01:22:32,619
We have a deal.
No interference with my coaching.

1118
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:35,789
As long as the strike is on,
Falco is my quarterback.

1119
01:22:36,081 --> 01:22:38,959
We have to beat Dallas
to get into the playoffs.

1120
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:42,546
Falco can't do that.
You saw what happened yesterday.

1121
01:22:42,796 --> 01:22:44,590
Jesus Christ!

1122
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:48,093
Do you think he'll have
that luck against Dallas, too?

1123
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:51,013
- They'll murder him!
- He's just getting his game back.

1124
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:53,640
He falls apart
whenever the game is on the line!

1125
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:56,143
That's been his rap
ever since the Sugar Bowl.

1126
01:22:58,061 --> 01:23:01,273
There are 21 other guys
who put their faith in you to lead them.

1127
01:23:01,398 --> 01:23:03,775
They'd be heartbroken
if you abandoned them...

1128
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:06,069
...before the biggest game of their lives.

1129
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:11,617
You really are a son of a bitch,
you know that?

1130
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:21,585
What are you doing?

1131
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:24,421
I don't want to make
the same mistake I did in Phoenix.

1132
01:23:24,505 --> 01:23:26,882
We might end up
in that situation with Dallas.

1133
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:30,052
They like to send their safeties...

1134
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,096
...put the pressure on.

1135
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:35,390
Yeah, coach?

1136
01:23:36,517 --> 01:23:37,893
It's over.

1137
01:23:38,268 --> 01:23:39,353
Martel crossed.

1138
01:23:43,774 --> 01:23:45,150
I'm sorry.

1139
01:24:00,457 --> 01:24:03,544
"Chokes with the game on the line. "
Is that what O'Neil said?

1140
01:24:11,552 --> 01:24:12,928
It's okay.

1141
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,430
It's better for the team, right?

1142
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:17,558
I mean, Martel...

1143
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:21,353
...he is the best. The guy's got it all.

1144
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:23,063
No.

1145
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:25,941
He doesn't have heart.

1146
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:29,361
You do.

1147
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:36,118
It's been a privilege.

1148
01:24:38,453 --> 01:24:39,705
Thanks for believing.

1149
01:24:52,676 --> 01:24:54,428
You give them hell on Thursday.

1150
01:25:21,497 --> 01:25:24,500
I just wanted to tell you before you left...

1151
01:25:26,001 --> 01:25:27,002
I'm sorry.

1152
01:25:27,878 --> 01:25:29,755
- Thanks.
- No, really.

1153
01:25:30,672 --> 01:25:33,133
I think it's terrible
what they do to you guys.

1154
01:25:36,136 --> 01:25:39,890
They make you believe
that you're better than you really are.

1155
01:25:40,098 --> 01:25:42,226
Then they pull the rug out from under you.

1156
01:25:44,853 --> 01:25:48,482
The cruelest thing
that they can give guys like you...

1157
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:50,108
...is hope.

1158
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:58,450
You're a real class act, Martel...

1159
01:26:00,035 --> 01:26:02,079
...a real class act.

1160
01:26:03,747 --> 01:26:05,374
She deserves better.

1161
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,587
You're a sinking ship.
Don't drag her down with you.

1162
01:26:13,132 --> 01:26:15,008
Take care of my guys.

1163
01:26:19,138 --> 01:26:20,931
Come on, boys, let's go!

1164
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:24,518
Nothing but water left in here. Let's go.

1165
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,395
I have a date.

1166
01:26:26,562 --> 01:26:30,023
- But I love you, Annabelle.
- I know you do, Alan.

1167
01:26:30,274 --> 01:26:32,401
'Bye, you guys. Be careful!

1168
01:27:27,706 --> 01:27:29,416
Here he is!

1169
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:31,668
Ladies and gentlemen...

1170
01:27:32,002 --> 01:27:34,713
...Number 16 in your programs...

1171
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,549
...Number 1 in your hearts!

1172
01:27:37,966 --> 01:27:40,427
Shane Falco!

1173
01:27:43,055 --> 01:27:44,223
Falco! Falco!

1174
01:27:51,438 --> 01:27:52,815
Cheers. God bless you.

1175
01:27:52,898 --> 01:27:54,233
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1176
01:28:03,075 --> 01:28:04,243
Are you all right?

1177
01:28:07,621 --> 01:28:08,914
I'm done.

1178
01:28:09,081 --> 01:28:10,082
What?

1179
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:12,751
Martel crossed.

1180
01:28:12,918 --> 01:28:14,336
Bloody hell.

1181
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:17,756
When will you tell the guys?

1182
01:28:18,215 --> 01:28:20,425
- I don't want to ruin...
- No, no, wait.

1183
01:28:20,926 --> 01:28:24,763
Cut that music! Cut it!
Turn the music off! Cut it!

1184
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:27,266
Shane's got something to tell you.

1185
01:28:29,852 --> 01:28:31,728
I've got good news.

1186
01:28:32,437 --> 01:28:35,524
This Thursday you'll be with
the best quarterback in the league.

1187
01:28:35,649 --> 01:28:37,526
Damn right.

1188
01:28:40,154 --> 01:28:41,613
Martel.

1189
01:28:42,406 --> 01:28:43,574
He crossed.

1190
01:28:47,703 --> 01:28:49,288
Martel crossed.

1191
01:28:53,959 --> 01:28:56,879
While you guys are getting pounded
by Dallas...

1192
01:28:58,130 --> 01:28:59,298
...just kidding...

1193
01:29:00,716 --> 01:29:03,093
...I'll be drinking beer on my boat.

1194
01:29:03,677 --> 01:29:05,137
Kicking back.

1195
01:29:08,015 --> 01:29:09,475
Sentinels...

1196
01:29:10,142 --> 01:29:12,019
...raise your glasses.

1197
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:14,438
This is to Shane Falco.

1198
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:17,024
He's our quarterback.

1199
01:29:17,441 --> 01:29:19,026
He's our leader.

1200
01:29:20,027 --> 01:29:23,280
But most of all, he's our friend.
This is for you, man.

1201
01:29:23,697 --> 01:29:24,740
To Falco!

1202
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:29,995
Thanks.

1203
01:29:30,537 --> 01:29:31,872
Thanks.

1204
01:29:33,373 --> 01:29:34,833
It's been fun.

1205
01:30:59,001 --> 01:31:02,337
Welcome back to Nextel Stadium
in our nation's capital.

1206
01:31:02,588 --> 01:31:05,757
I'm Pat Summerall and with me,
as always, is John Madden.

1207
01:31:06,008 --> 01:31:09,261
It appears that the strike
is coming to a close.

1208
01:31:09,428 --> 01:31:12,431
Martel will be resuming
the quarterback position tonight.

1209
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,850
I gotta admit, I was looking forward...

1210
01:31:14,975 --> 01:31:18,312
...to seeing what Falco could do
with one more game.

1211
01:31:18,395 --> 01:31:21,315
He made amazing progress
the past few weeks...

1212
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,567
...under the tutelage of Jimmy McGinty.

1213
01:31:23,650 --> 01:31:24,651
He really did.

1214
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:28,989
But tonight it'll be Martel
leading Washington against Dallas.

1215
01:31:38,373 --> 01:31:40,751
I never thought I'd say this, but...

1216
01:31:41,001 --> 01:31:43,754
...I'm gonna kind of miss
those replacement games.

1217
01:31:43,962 --> 01:31:45,923
Bring back Falco!

1218
01:31:46,298 --> 01:31:50,344
ladies and gentlemen,
leading your Washington Sentinels today...

1219
01:31:50,552 --> 01:31:53,889
...welcome back Number 7, Eddie Martel.

1220
01:31:58,060 --> 01:31:59,311
Go on, boys!

1221
01:32:15,536 --> 01:32:16,995
Red 21!

1222
01:32:22,876 --> 01:32:25,629
Come on, Martel. Get moving!

1223
01:32:26,922 --> 01:32:28,632
Maybe you should try scrambling.

1224
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:31,510
Brilliant. How about a quick kick?

1225
01:32:49,862 --> 01:32:51,321
Hey, Butler.

1226
01:32:54,032 --> 01:32:56,076
- Red 38!
- Hey, man.

1227
01:32:56,285 --> 01:32:59,705
If it ain't any trouble,
I'd love to get your autograph after.

1228
01:32:59,955 --> 01:33:01,915
You want it, you got it, scab!

1229
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:03,417
All right.

1230
01:33:22,394 --> 01:33:25,564
Cochran fumbles the ball, Dallas recovers.

1231
01:33:25,731 --> 01:33:28,567
First down and goal on the two-yard line.

1232
01:33:31,612 --> 01:33:32,779
Hawk 9, Stay!

1233
01:33:33,030 --> 01:33:36,283
Bateman! Hawk 9, Stay!

1234
01:33:36,492 --> 01:33:38,869
Hawk 9, Stay!

1235
01:33:39,953 --> 01:33:41,413
I'm back!

1236
01:33:46,793 --> 01:33:48,587
Touchdown, Dallas.

1237
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:54,927
They're quitting on you!

1238
01:34:02,935 --> 01:34:04,102
Gold 41!

1239
01:34:17,157 --> 01:34:20,077
Pass intended
to Brian Murphy, incomplete.

1240
01:34:20,828 --> 01:34:22,454
Throw right, you're going left!

1241
01:34:22,663 --> 01:34:24,540
Right, right, right.

1242
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:27,042
You went left, I want you to go right!

1243
01:34:28,085 --> 01:34:29,419
No, right!

1244
01:34:29,586 --> 01:34:30,838
Right, you idiot!

1245
01:34:32,798 --> 01:34:34,675
Hey, easy!

1246
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:59,449
Brian Murphy fumbled the ball.
Dallas recovers.

1247
01:35:03,036 --> 01:35:04,037
Nice hands.

1248
01:35:04,163 --> 01:35:06,456
Three-two Magic, Rack Zero.

1249
01:35:06,665 --> 01:35:08,625
What the hell was that about?

1250
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:24,933
Touchdown, Dallas.

1251
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:05,224
Gruff, wake up!

1252
01:36:15,526 --> 01:36:16,527
What the...

1253
01:36:16,735 --> 01:36:19,196
Pass incomplete by Eddie Martel.

1254
01:36:24,743 --> 01:36:26,787
What the hell was that?

1255
01:36:27,079 --> 01:36:28,539
I'm talking to you!

1256
01:36:28,747 --> 01:36:30,374
I call the plays out on the field.

1257
01:36:30,541 --> 01:36:32,918
- That's not how I coach.
- I don't give a shit...

1258
01:36:33,043 --> 01:36:35,254
...because that's the way I play.

1259
01:36:35,796 --> 01:36:38,173
That's the end of the first half...

1260
01:36:38,382 --> 01:36:40,843
...with a score of Dallas 17, Washington 0.

1261
01:36:41,051 --> 01:36:42,052
Coach McGinty!

1262
01:36:42,261 --> 01:36:44,930
What will Washington need
to get back into this game?

1263
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:49,101
- Heart.
- I'm sorry?

1264
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:50,853
You've gotta have heart.

1265
01:36:51,019 --> 01:36:52,563
Can you elaborate?

1266
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:56,817
Miles and miles of heart.

1267
01:36:58,485 --> 01:37:01,905
There you have it,
in a word, from Coach McGinty...

1268
01:37:02,114 --> 01:37:05,284
...Washington will need "heart"
to get back into this...

1269
01:37:09,413 --> 01:37:11,957
I ran it like you said!
You just underthrew me!

1270
01:37:12,207 --> 01:37:15,544
This isn't a track meet, asshole.
You have to look for the ball!

1271
01:37:16,378 --> 01:37:18,672
I'll pull you off the field, you spoil punk.

1272
01:37:20,132 --> 01:37:24,678
Is O'Neil gonna side with a burnout coach
or someone who puts fans in the stands?

1273
01:37:25,012 --> 01:37:26,013
Son of a bitch!

1274
01:37:27,347 --> 01:37:30,434
What are you thinking about?
We got a game to play!

1275
01:37:30,684 --> 01:37:33,228
- No one can beat Dallas with these losers!
- I can.

1276
01:37:36,982 --> 01:37:40,402
Falco, great to see you.
Now, get the hell out of my locker room!

1277
01:37:40,652 --> 01:37:42,529
- Coach?
- What took you so long?

1278
01:37:42,988 --> 01:37:43,989
Traffic.

1279
01:37:44,948 --> 01:37:46,200
Suit up!

1280
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:47,284
What?

1281
01:37:48,785 --> 01:37:51,538
- O'Neil will fire your ass!
- It won't be the first time!

1282
01:37:51,705 --> 01:37:53,916
This is bullshit! I'll end this right now.

1283
01:37:54,166 --> 01:37:55,793
Come and get some!

1284
01:37:59,838 --> 01:38:01,632
You big fatty!

1285
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,183
This doesn't change anything.

1286
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:14,186
I'm an All-Pro quarterback!
I've got two Super Bowl rings!

1287
01:38:14,311 --> 01:38:16,271
You're no more than a replacement.

1288
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,648
Yeah.

1289
01:38:19,149 --> 01:38:20,859
I can live with that.

1290
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:26,490
My brothers, will somebody
please get this asshole out of here?

1291
01:38:28,283 --> 01:38:30,244
Get your hands off me, you gorilla!

1292
01:38:40,504 --> 01:38:44,091
Jimmy McGinty is anything
but a conventional guy.

1293
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:47,970
And McGinty says, with the playoffs
on the line, "Go for it. "

1294
01:38:48,178 --> 01:38:50,639
Get to the playoffs.
Something Washington...

1295
01:38:50,889 --> 01:38:54,143
...has not been able to do
against Dallas in seven years.

1296
01:39:08,699 --> 01:39:09,867
Falco?

1297
01:39:11,618 --> 01:39:13,495
What the hell is he up to?

1298
01:39:14,037 --> 01:39:16,498
Look, here comes Falco! Falco's back!

1299
01:39:16,874 --> 01:39:18,208
What happened to Martel?

1300
01:39:18,417 --> 01:39:20,627
I don't know, but the way Falco's running...

1301
01:39:20,752 --> 01:39:24,423
...and that look he has in his eye,
he thinks he's gonna play.

1302
01:39:28,927 --> 01:39:29,928
I'm sorry.

1303
01:39:31,889 --> 01:39:34,892
They're playing zone out there
and you can pick them apart...

1304
01:39:34,975 --> 01:39:36,602
...if you keep your eyes open...

1305
01:39:36,685 --> 01:39:41,064
He seems to be necking with
that cheerleader! That's what he's doing!

1306
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:45,444
Players aren't supposed to be
fraternizing with cheerleaders.

1307
01:39:45,652 --> 01:39:48,322
Yeah, but what are they gonna do?
Fire him?

1308
01:39:48,906 --> 01:39:51,283
- You give me strength.
- You're late for work.

1309
01:39:53,702 --> 01:39:54,870
Kick ass, Falco!

1310
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:01,210
What's all the celebrating about?
We're down 17-0.

1311
01:40:01,585 --> 01:40:03,045
It's nasty out there.

1312
01:40:03,295 --> 01:40:05,589
That's why girls don't play
the game, coach.

1313
01:40:05,839 --> 01:40:10,052
Listen up. This time tomorrow,
the strike will be officially over.

1314
01:40:10,803 --> 01:40:13,889
Dallas has made a big mistake.
They haven't been afraid of you.

1315
01:40:14,139 --> 01:40:17,476
They should be, because you have
a powerful weapon working for you.

1316
01:40:17,684 --> 01:40:19,728
There is no tomorrow for you.

1317
01:40:19,978 --> 01:40:22,523
That makes you all very dangerous people!

1318
01:40:29,863 --> 01:40:31,198
Kick ass on one. Ready?

1319
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:42,793
Clifford Franklin is looking for a new home.

1320
01:40:43,794 --> 01:40:45,420
Ready for some pain?

1321
01:40:45,629 --> 01:40:47,714
- Bring it on.
- It's coming.

1322
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:49,550
It's coming.

1323
01:40:49,758 --> 01:40:51,468
See him coming in motion?

1324
01:40:55,597 --> 01:40:57,391
I've never seen anything like this!

1325
01:40:57,599 --> 01:40:58,767
Unbelievable!

1326
01:41:00,102 --> 01:41:03,772
There's at least five, six flags out there.
Hats, everything!

1327
01:41:03,981 --> 01:41:06,441
This is what you call
an old-fashioned melee.

1328
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:09,736
Unnecessary roughness,
Number 16 and Number 34.

1329
01:41:09,987 --> 01:41:12,739
Fifteen yards, so that's, wait...

1330
01:41:12,948 --> 01:41:15,159
...45... 30...

1331
01:41:18,287 --> 01:41:19,913
How many yards so far?

1332
01:41:20,122 --> 01:41:22,416
Who do they think they're playing here?

1333
01:41:28,964 --> 01:41:30,591
Let's go! Come on!

1334
01:41:56,492 --> 01:41:57,493
My knee!

1335
01:41:58,327 --> 01:41:59,328
It's my knee!

1336
01:42:03,373 --> 01:42:05,083
I think I broke it.

1337
01:42:09,671 --> 01:42:11,048
Did I do it? Did I score?

1338
01:42:11,256 --> 01:42:13,801
- Yeah, you did it.
- God, it hurts!

1339
01:42:14,051 --> 01:42:14,968
I'm sorry.

1340
01:42:15,219 --> 01:42:18,555
Don't be sorry. Going out
in front of 80,000 people ain't bad.

1341
01:42:20,057 --> 01:42:22,518
You finish what you started.

1342
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:29,650
White 24!

1343
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:48,293
Blue 15! Hut, hut!

1344
01:43:16,905 --> 01:43:19,199
First down, Washington.

1345
01:43:21,743 --> 01:43:23,871
- Good job.
- I got skills.

1346
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:27,166
- Feel like running the ball?
- Better give it to Wilkinson.

1347
01:43:27,916 --> 01:43:29,084
He's going to jail.

1348
01:43:30,002 --> 01:43:33,005
- I'll clear the way.
- I'm right behind you.

1349
01:43:34,131 --> 01:43:35,757
We need it!

1350
01:43:47,936 --> 01:43:52,149
A gain of 20 yards by Ray Smith.
First down.

1351
01:43:58,780 --> 01:44:01,325
I know you're tired. I know you're hurting.

1352
01:44:01,533 --> 01:44:04,453
I wish I could say something
classy and inspirational...

1353
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:06,330
...but it wouldn't be our style.

1354
01:44:08,791 --> 01:44:10,125
Pain heals.

1355
01:44:10,459 --> 01:44:12,169
Chicks dig scars.

1356
01:44:12,586 --> 01:44:15,047
Glory lasts forever.

1357
01:44:15,297 --> 01:44:16,465
Right on, Shane.

1358
01:44:16,673 --> 01:44:19,134
Right on, baby!

1359
01:44:19,384 --> 01:44:21,345
Shotgun, DC Right.

1360
01:44:21,553 --> 01:44:24,640
Flip 90, Dig, on the center. Ready?

1361
01:44:40,656 --> 01:44:44,159
We're looking at a different team here
in the second half.

1362
01:44:44,326 --> 01:44:48,372
Absolutely. Washington is playing
like there's no tomorrow...

1363
01:44:48,622 --> 01:44:50,165
...because there isn't.

1364
01:44:51,250 --> 01:44:52,793
Touchdown, baby!

1365
01:44:53,043 --> 01:44:54,044
Son of a bitch!

1366
01:44:56,338 --> 01:44:58,549
Odd bullets, blitz coverage!

1367
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:11,854
Daniel Bateman comes up
with the big stop on third and one.

1368
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:13,397
That forces a Dallas punt.

1369
01:45:13,522 --> 01:45:18,485
Pat, with 28 seconds remaining,
Washington needs a decent return...

1370
01:45:18,861 --> 01:45:22,030
...in order to give Gruff
a shot to tie the game.

1371
01:45:45,262 --> 01:45:47,139
With 12 seconds remaining...

1372
01:45:47,389 --> 01:45:49,850
- It's yours, Nigel.
- ... a 32-yard field goal...

1373
01:45:50,058 --> 01:45:52,019
...will send this game into overtime.

1374
01:45:52,227 --> 01:45:54,897
Thirty-two yards is just
a chip shot for Gruff.

1375
01:46:11,079 --> 01:46:12,164
Are you all right?

1376
01:46:13,791 --> 01:46:14,875
I'm sorry.

1377
01:46:15,083 --> 01:46:18,086
I had the money but I pissed it
away down the track again.

1378
01:46:18,253 --> 01:46:20,631
What? What are you talking about?

1379
01:46:20,839 --> 01:46:22,633
They'll take my pub away from me.

1380
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,426
It's all I've got.

1381
01:46:25,219 --> 01:46:26,845
Come on, Shane!

1382
01:46:39,775 --> 01:46:42,861
It's a fake! Falco still has it!
He's running with it!

1383
01:46:52,204 --> 01:46:54,164
Touchdown, Falco!

1384
01:47:07,636 --> 01:47:10,722
Holding! Number 68 on the offense.

1385
01:47:10,973 --> 01:47:13,642
Ten-yard penalty. Repeat first down.

1386
01:47:13,851 --> 01:47:15,561
What a terrible call!

1387
01:47:15,811 --> 01:47:17,271
Time out!

1388
01:47:20,649 --> 01:47:23,318
- You okay?
- I broke my arm.

1389
01:47:23,861 --> 01:47:25,571
Cheers. You saved my ass.

1390
01:47:26,155 --> 01:47:27,239
Take care.

1391
01:47:27,489 --> 01:47:30,033
You'll have to explain to me
what that was about.

1392
01:47:32,035 --> 01:47:33,203
What's it gonna be?

1393
01:47:34,037 --> 01:47:35,664
I want the ball.

1394
01:47:36,665 --> 01:47:38,000
Winners always do.

1395
01:47:39,001 --> 01:47:40,627
Spread formation.

1396
01:47:48,343 --> 01:47:49,595
Damn!

1397
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:58,937
Sorry, Shane. I'm sorry, everybody.

1398
01:47:59,188 --> 01:48:02,024
No problem.
Just rip someone's head off on this one.

1399
01:48:02,232 --> 01:48:03,317
Consider it done.

1400
01:48:03,525 --> 01:48:07,529
All right. So besides me,
who really wants the ball?

1401
01:48:09,031 --> 01:48:10,574
Yeah, you want it, Brian.

1402
01:48:10,824 --> 01:48:14,578
Let's hook up.
DC Left, Wide Motion, 88 War.

1403
01:48:14,786 --> 01:48:15,954
Gentlemen...

1404
01:48:20,209 --> 01:48:23,462
It's been an honor to share
the field of battle with you.

1405
01:48:50,864 --> 01:48:52,241
We ain't losing this game.

1406
01:49:13,554 --> 01:49:14,555
Green 86!

1407
01:49:19,643 --> 01:49:21,520
Green 86!

1408
01:49:57,347 --> 01:50:00,100
Touchdown, Brian Murphy!

1409
01:50:01,226 --> 01:50:04,897
I knew it! I knew it all along!

1410
01:50:05,105 --> 01:50:08,609
Jimmy, you beautiful son of a bitch!
I knew you could do it!

1411
01:50:08,859 --> 01:50:13,071
Final score: Washington 20, Dallas 17.

1412
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:16,617
Washington goes to the playoffs!

1413
01:50:26,210 --> 01:50:27,211
You did it!

1414
01:50:28,796 --> 01:50:29,797
You did it!

1415
01:51:36,864 --> 01:51:41,160
When the replacement players
for the Sentinels left the stadium...

1416
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:43,370
...there was no ticker-tape parade...

1417
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:46,081
...no endorsement deals for sneakers...

1418
01:51:46,331 --> 01:51:49,168
...or soda pop or breakfast cereal...

1419
01:51:49,376 --> 01:51:51,753
...just a locker to be cleaned out...

1420
01:51:52,004 --> 01:51:54,047
...and a ride home to catch.

1421
01:51:54,298 --> 01:51:56,175
But what they didn't know...

1422
01:51:56,425 --> 01:51:59,178
...was that their lives
