1
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
What is it?

2
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,120
- What do they want?
- I do not know.

3
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,000
Pass... Pass.

4
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,200
Is it a cop?

5
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,160
I cannot see.

6
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,640
- What are they playing at?
- They are not playing...

7
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,760
- What are we going to do?
- I do not know.

8
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,440
Okay, hold on, guys.

9
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
There is a truck, too.

10
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,400
It is a cop.

11
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,000
You had better stop.

12
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,480
Sit tight and do not say anything,
let me talk.

13
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,640
We will be all right. Just relax.

14
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,760
- You ride at the speed you want here?
- You scared us to death, man.

15
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,640
- Do not call me "man", jew boy.
- Sir, what should I call you?

16
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,360
Do not call me anything,
nigger-Ioving jew boy, just listen.

17
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,960
Yes, sir.

18
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,120
You even smell like a nigger, jew boy.

19
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,000
- Take it easy, we will be all right.
- Sure you will.

20
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,120
He is seeing your face, that is no good.

21
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,240
It does not make a difference anymore.

22
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,200
They only left me a nigger,
but at least I shot me a nigger.

23
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,400
Yes, indeed.

24
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,680
Listen communists, niggers and jews.
Tell your buddies to spread the news.

25
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,040
The day of judgement will soon be nigh.

26
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,640
As the Lord in his wisdom
looks down from on high.

27
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,720
Will his battle be lost
by mixing the races?

28
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,440
We want beautiful babies,
not ones with brown faces.

29
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,840
Never, never, never, I say!
For the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay.

30
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,000
The Ku Klux Klan are better with lynches
than with lyrics.

31
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,680
Just read the file, Mr Anderson.
I can do without the cabaret.

32
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,640
You do not like me, boss?

33
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,240
Sure I do,
but I do not share your sense of humour.

34
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,840
Sometimes that is all you have left.

35
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
- How long have you been in the bureau?
- Three years.

36
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,640
- Right out of college?
- No, from the Justice Department.

37
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,640
Kennedy boy, now I see.

38
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,960
No, I do not think that you do.
Let us get this straight:

39
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,760
I have not had a pimple in years,
I shave every morning, -

40
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,680
- I even go to the bathroom by myself,
so you can quit this boss stuff.

41
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,840
I am in charge
because I have tried this before.

42
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,680
- Birmingham, Montgomery?
- Oxford.

43
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,680
I was with Meredith.

44
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,640
You were hit on the head
and got an promotion?

45
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,800
No. Shot in the shoulder.

46
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,560
- At least you lived.
- No, Meredith lived. That is important.

47
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,920
- What has four eyes and cannot see?
- What?

48
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,240
Mississippi.

49
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,360
Never, never, never, I say!
For the Ku Klux Klan is here to...

50
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,360
A big building for a small town.

51
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,480
Good Morning. My name is Alan Ward,
I am with the F.B.I.

52
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,440
Federal Bureau of Integration?

53
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,640
You are not exactly undercover, are you?

54
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,240
- We are here to see Sheriff Stuckey.
- The sheriff is busy now.

55
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,840
You will have to wait
or come back some other time.

56
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,280
We will wait.

57
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,800
Listen, you ass, you have
two seconds to get him out here, -

58
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,000
- or I will kick the door in, okay?

59
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,400
Looks like we have some company.
The Hoover boys have come down.

60
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,080
- How are you?
- Good.

61
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,920
- I am Sheriff Stuckey.
- Rupert Anderson.

62
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,480
Rupert, we have been expecting you.

63
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,040
- I assume you have met Deputy Pell?
- I sure have.

64
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,880
- Are you here about our nigger problem?
- No, it is a missing person case.

65
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,920
Come on.

66
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,160
Do you want the boy with us?

67
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,640
Sir, I am Special Agent Ward
and I am in charge of this case.

68
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,800
We think it might be more serious
than missing persons.

69
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,520
I do not think so, boy.

70
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,920
I think it is a publicity stunt
cooked up by that Martin Luther King.

71
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,640
Around 3 p.m. Deputy Pell
arrested 3 boys for speeding.

72
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,320
He held them in jail until 10 p.m.
And then released them.

73
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,000
They drove off. He says
he followed them to the county line -

74
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,680
- and never saw them again.

75
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,840
- Why did they not make a phone call?
- Why should they?

76
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,560
These boys were trained activists.

77
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,200
They are to check in every hour and the
moment they are released from custody.

78
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,880
The hotel is two minutes from the jail,
they could phone from the lobby.

79
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,440
- Maybe they went for a beer?
- Not these boys.

80
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,360
The Civil Rights Office made calls
when they did not check in.

81
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,880
The Sheriff's Office here said
they had no idea where the boys were.

82
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,360
First lie.

83
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,480
By who? The sheriff's office or
the Civil Rights Office?

84
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,440
Who would you believe?

85
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,680
Maybe you do not know it,
but I was a sheriff in a town like this.

86
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,880
- I know that.
- Lying does not come into it.

87
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,880
We were right on the border -

88
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,800
- and so far away from everything.

89
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,680
If a sheriff in a little town says "that
is what happened," then that is so.

90
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,360
Let us go and eat.

91
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,040
- We are full up, do you want to wait?
- Is it worth it?

92
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,040
We are not full for nothing. Will you
look at the menu while you wait?

93
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,680
- So will you wait or leave?
- We will wait, just to be near you.

94
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,840
- There are some empty seats down there.
- Mr Ward...

95
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,040
That is coloured.
Do not even think about it.

96
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,280
Some people here are ready to leave.

97
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,880
Are you not hungry, Mr Anderson?

98
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,000
Good afternoon. Looks good.

99
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,760
Do you mind if I ask a few questions?
I am looking for some information.

100
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,040
- I have nothing to say to you, sir.
- Just a few questions.

101
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,520
I have nothing to say to you, sir.

102
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,520
The three civil rights boys came here
to set up a voter registration clinic.

103
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,000
Before the locals could say yes,
the Klan burned them down.

104
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,800
Give the man a vote,
but do not let him use it.

105
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,000
What does the office in Rossville say?

106
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,800
They confirm that the boys came
to apologise to the congregation.

107
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:26,360
Sorry the folks did not get to vote.
Most probably did not know they had one.

108
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,800
Now you have no place to go on Sunday.

109
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,520
After they came here, they talked
to some locals down the road.

110
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,440
That is where we should start.

111
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,880
You can talk to them,
but they will not talk to you.

112
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,400
They have to live here
long after we have gone.

113
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,880
They would rather bite off their tongue.

114
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,960
Bureau procedure, Mr Anderson.

115
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,000
The church caught fire
and you ran home?

116
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,840
Yes, sir.

117
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,560
And then the four white men stopped you?

118
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,880
- And they attacked your husband?
- Yes, sir.

119
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,560
But you cannot identify them?

120
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,960
No, sir.

121
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,400
- Did you report this to the police?
- No, sir.

122
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,320
- You told the civil rights boys about it?
- Yes, sir.

123
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,640
Did they tell you
where they were going after that?

124
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,760
No, sir.

125
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,040
- Nothing?
- No, sir.

126
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,600
- All right, thank you.
- You are welcome.

127
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,040
Open up.

128
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,160
- Is your brother Halifair Finn?
- Yes, sir.

129
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,040
- Wake him up, we want to see him.
- Why?

130
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,640
- Just wake him up.
- What is the matter?

131
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,440
Get back here, you nigger!

132
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,040
We had better not catch you
talking to the F.B.I.

133
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,080
- You admire these kids, do you not?
- Do you not?

134
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,880
I think they are being used.

135
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,120
They are being sent down here
just to get their heads cracked open.

136
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,080
Maybe they believed in
what they were doing.

137
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,160
- Did they know they could end up dead?
- Maybe.

138
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,800
- In Washington they knew, did they not?
- Some things are worth dying for.

139
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,880
Down here they see things
a little differently.

140
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,360
People down here feel
some things are worth killing for.

141
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,840
Where does it come from,
all this hatred?

142
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,280
When I was a little boy...

143
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,680
...there was an old negro farmer
down the road, named Monroe.

144
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,880
He was... I guess he was
a little luckier than my dad.

145
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,920
He bought himself a mule.

146
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,400
That was a big deal around that town.

147
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,200
My daddy hated that mule -

148
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,800
- because his friends were always
kidding him about Monroe and his mule.

149
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,080
And Monroe was to rent another field
now he had a mule and...

150
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,560
One morning that mule was dead.

151
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,120
Poison in the water.

152
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,040
After that there was never any mention
of that mule around my daddy.

153
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,240
One time we drove down the road,
Monroe's place was empty.

154
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,720
He just packed up and left,
gone up north or something.

155
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,720
I looked over at my daddy's face...

156
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,520
...and I knew that he had done it.
He saw that I knew.

157
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,640
I guess he was ashamed.

158
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,480
He looked at me and said:

159
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,800
"If you are not better than a nigger,
who are you better than?"

160
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:24,040
- Do you think that is an excuse?
- No, it is just a story about my daddy.

161
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,640
Where does that leave you?

162
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,320
The old man was so full of hate -

163
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,000
- that he did not know that
being poor was what killed him.

164
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
Get the light! Get the light!

165
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,720
Are you all right?

166
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,360
I guess they know we are here.

167
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,160
Now you know what you are getting into.

168
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,040
I will call Washington for more agents.

169
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,040
Will it make a difference if I say
that is the wrong thing to do?

170
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,520
No.

171
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,520
The whole place for $75 a month.
It is private, central and perfect.

172
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,000
There is room for 100 more agents.

173
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,080
200 maybe.
More on the balcony.

174
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,800
We are trying to find the three boys.
I take all the help I can get.

175
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,240
When does the show start?

176
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,560
- Who is the big shot?
- It is the Klan.

177
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,720
No pointy hats,
but plenty of pointy heads.

178
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,800
Let me run a check on the plates.

179
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,800
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

180
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,960
- Say hello to Mayor Tilman here.
- How do you do, Anderson?

181
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,440
Mr Mayor, Mr Barber.
This looks like the place to be.

182
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,880
Even for me.

183
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,440
There is no place like a barbershop
to get the latest gossip.

184
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,360
- Where are you from?
- Thornton, Mississippi, sir.

185
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,920
- Just a spit from Tennessee.
- Then you know how we feel down here.

186
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,640
We do not like outsiders telling us
how to live our lives.

187
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:07,040
Our negroes were happy until those
college kids came and stirred things up.

188
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,640
- Before that nobody was complaining.
- Nobody dared.

189
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,000
We have a peaceful community down here.
They are like any other folks -

190
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,080
- if you push them too far.

191
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,640
It is like three sticks of old dynamite.

192
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,480
Shake it up... and we will be scraping
bodies off the street.

193
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,160
I am here to investigate the missing
three kids, ask some questions.

194
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,480
It all boils down to gravy. It would not
be enough to cover a chicken steak.

195
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,120
The kids you are looking for,
I bet you a shiny new dime -

196
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,680
- they are sitting up in Chicago now -

197
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,680
- drinking a cold beer,
laughing about all the commotion.

198
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,880
I sure hope so.

199
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:00,000
Tell your bosses that people have
the wrong idea about the South.

200
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,480
You know what I am talking about.

201
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,040
Everybody running around ragged,
backwards, illiterate, -

202
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,080
- eating sour belly and corn pone
three times a day.

203
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,960
The fact is
we have two cultures down here:

204
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,720
White culture...
and the coloured culture.

205
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,920
That is the way it always has been
and the way it always will be.

206
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,240
The rest of America do not think so.

207
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,000
The rest of America do not mean a shit.
You are in Mississippi now.

208
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,680
That is for sure.

209
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,720
- What is the score, Mr Barber?
- St. Louis on top, five to nothing.

210
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,400
- Do you like baseball?
- Yes, I do.

211
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,880
It is the only time a black man
can wave a stick at a white man -

212
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,840
- and not start a riot.

213
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,720
We checked the plates: Clayton Townley.

214
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,360
Townley, grand wizard of
the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

215
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,000
I think we have a lead on the car, sir.
We are waiting for a call.

216
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,840
Good.

217
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,080
You have an appointment for
next Tuesday. See you then, bye.

218
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,920
Good afternoon, ladies.

219
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,240
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

220
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,280
I just hate the way I look.

221
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,640
What do you think,
a permanent wave maybe, or a bleach job?

222
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,160
That looks good, did you get that here?

223
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,920
No, in Jackson.

224
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,040
I think a wig is your only help,
you cannot do much with that cue ball.

225
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,480
You can ask us some questions,
this is where you will hear it all.

226
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,680
Actually, I will. I wondered who that
was who drove in over there?

227
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,080
- I know it is not President Johnson...
- His name is Clayton Townley.

228
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,880
- Are you one of those F.B.I. Gentlemen?
- Yes, ma'am.

229
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:59,000
I think it is a shame if those
two boys are dead. I hope you find them.

230
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,440
Thank you. Actually it is three kids.
There was also a coloured kid.

231
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,600
You think you would have come
if it was not for those two white boys?

232
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,840
- Maybe not, Miss.
- Mrs.

233
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,240
Pell. Her old man is Stuckey's deputy.

234
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,640
But I am single.

235
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,200
Keep out of the way.

236
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,280
We will take care of this.

237
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,400
We will handle this.
We do not need your help!

238
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,200
Blood on the main street.
How will that look on the TV news?

239
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,960
It is the kid from the diner. Do not
talk to coloured kids with an audience!

240
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,440
They sent a message from the big boss.

241
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,480
I know, Clayton Townley,
chief pointyhead.

242
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,800
- Yes, how did you know?
- Bureau procedure, you should try it!

243
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,360
We did!
We found the car the kids were driving.

244
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,760
Good morning.

245
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,000
Good morning.

246
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,800
Two beer cans, a coca cola bottle,
a green plastic bottle, -

247
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,920
- a wristwatch that stopped at 12:45,
a set of keys. No bodies.

248
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,200
- I want the entire area searched.
- Yes, sir. It is a big swamp.

249
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,080
Every inch, Mr. Bird.

250
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,360
I guess they never left Mississippi.

251
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,440
They are dead.

252
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,160
- Mr Bird?
- Yes, sir.

253
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:09,200
There is a telephone at the truck stop.
Get on it and get me 100 more men.

254
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,160
100? ...Bureau people, sir?

255
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,040
I do not care if it is an army.
I want this entire swamp searched.

256
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:28,440
- Do not do it. You will start a war.
- It was a war long before we got here.

257
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,040
Get the fuck out of here!

258
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,840
The sheriff's alibi is solid. He was
playing poker with his wife's brother.

259
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,120
- The whole time?
- For three hours. He lost $11.38.

260
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,080
There is something else, sir.
We have trouble with the motel manager.

261
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,360
- What kind of trouble?
- He wants us out. Bad for business.

262
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,640
- Buy it.
- Sorry, sir?

263
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,440
Buy it! The motel.

264
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,920
- How high can I go?
- Whatever it takes.

265
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,240
Today in Jessup county, Mississippi,
amidst the violence that erupted, -

266
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,240
- the eyes of the nation
have been fixed -

267
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,160
- on the search for
the three missing civil rights workers.

268
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:14,280
I think it is a big hoax. If they are
in that swamp, then they asked for it.

269
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,080
Naval reserves have been brought in
to join F.B.I. Agents -

270
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,080
- in their search for the missing men.

271
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,680
I think they planned the whole thing.
They sit in New York and laugh at us...

272
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,600
- You think it is a hoax?
- Yes. They will not find anything.

273
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,640
Civil rights leaders are still
optimistic as to their whereabouts.

274
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,360
But privately there is concern
that they will never be found alive.

275
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,000
They came looking for trouble
and they found it!

276
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,400
This is Merrick Bobby, Network News,
Jessup county, Mississippi.

277
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,000
You ought to look up in Canada
for the boys.

278
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,520
They are not in our swamps here.

279
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,200
It is a publicity stunt dreamed up
by these N.A.A.C.P. People.

280
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,880
It stands for niggers, alligators, apes,
coons and possums.

281
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,960
You got your N.A.A.C.P.,
your S.N.C.C., your C.O.F.O.

282
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,800
You know what it all is?

283
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,240
B.U.L.L.S.H.I.T.
You got it?

284
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,480
One day we will not have to say:
"Good morning, sir, Mr Sheriff."

285
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,720
Maybe we will not have to say:
"Mr. Stuckey".

286
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,160
One day we will just say:
"Stuckey, our sheriff."

287
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,360
And one day the sheriff will not even
be a white man.

288
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,920
Hello.

289
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,800
Can I ask a few questions?

290
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,400
Can you tell me
what kind of flower these are?

291
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:11,680
I see them all over the place here.
I never saw such a pretty plant.

292
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,040
They are trumpet pitchers.

293
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,960
They are beautiful. They do not smell
so good, but they are really pretty.

294
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,880
It was nice talking to you.
Sorry about interrupting your meeting -

295
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,240
- but we cannot get anybody
to talk to us.

296
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,720
They "zip up",
like my mum used to say.

297
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,160
They will not talk to you because they
are afraid it will get back to the law.

298
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,400
- We are the law.
- Not around here.

299
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,120
We were sent here to find out
what happened to those three boys.

300
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,760
- They were here to help you.
- You should not talk to the coloured.

301
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,640
Who should we be talking to?

302
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,080
You should start with the sheriff's office.

303
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:08,080
- Why are you not afraid?
- Why are you not afraid?

304
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,560
Aaron, come on, son.

305
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,280
Good evening, Mrs Pell. I am
Agent Ward, this is Agent Anderson.

306
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,680
We are with the F.B.I. Is your husband
home? We want to have a word with him.

307
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,960
Come in.

308
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,080
The F.B.I. Gentlemen
want to ask you some more questions.

309
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,560
I will put your dinner in the oven.

310
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,560
Leave us alone.

311
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,280
Do you mind if I take a seat?

312
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,280
What is so important
you have to bother me at home?

313
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,000
I just wanted to run through your
movements on June 21st once again.

314
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,080
- June which?
- June 21st.

315
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,160
Deputy, we both know what day we are
talking about. Let us do this civilised -

316
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,560
- so you can get back to your ball game
and we can get back to Washington.

317
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,400
Please, do not let me interrupt you.

318
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:12,040
But when you have heard a question
asked a dozen times, it gets boring.

319
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,280
I guess so.

320
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,520
- You do not eat together?
- He works funny hours.

321
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,520
- Do you think it is odd?
- No, I work funny hours myself.

322
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,280
I eat when I am hungry, he eats
when he can. Can I get you something?

323
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,400
No, thank you.

324
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,560
It is a nice house.
How long have you lived here?

325
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:49,960
I was born here. But my father lost the
house in a poker game a long time ago.

326
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,040
We have been paying rent ever since.

327
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,240
It is a wicked game.

328
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,600
Poker.

329
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,600
Mr Anderson?

330
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,080
It was nice talking to you.
I have to go.

331
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,240
Do the pork chops still look good?
Bring me a beer, honey.

332
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:28,640
Let us get back to baseball. It is the
only game where a black man can...

333
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,240
...I know, I have heard that one.

334
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,720
50 minutes of his alibi
hinges on his wife. What is she like?

335
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,440
She is a nice lady.

336
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,880
How does a woman like that
end up with...

337
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,600
...the shithead in there?
You know these small towns.

338
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,960
The girl spends her time in high school
looking for a guy to marry -

339
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,680
- and the rest of her life
wondering why.

340
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,160
There is something wrong.
He is too confident.

341
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,880
- Did you see the wedding photograph?
- No.

342
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,680
The three ushers have this way of
hooking their thumbs in their belts -

343
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,480
- with three fingers pointing down.

344
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,200
What is that?
Some sort of masonic thing?

345
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,440
No! KKK.

346
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:33,280
Hi. There was a couple of things
I needed to check with you.

347
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,680
- My husband is not here.
- It was you I wanted to talk to.

348
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:44,160
Me?...
Okay, you had better come in then.

349
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,360
It will just take a minute.

350
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,960
My boss is a pain, a real college kid.
He has to dot all the i's...

351
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,720
What is it?

352
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,440
It is a tiny thing
we are not clear about.

353
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:07,200
- Shall I put your flowers in water?
- Actually, they are for you.

354
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,120
- They are beautiful.
- They are pretty, are they not?

355
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,000
But they do not smell nice...

356
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,600
- Can I get you anything? Some tea?
- Yes, thank you.

357
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,560
Do not look at that!
It is a terrible photo.

358
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,440
I do not know about that.

359
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,000
- Is this recent?
- No. I wish.

360
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,360
- This sure looks recent to me.
- We were married 14 years ago.

361
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,640
You are kidding me!

362
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,120
- Do you take sugar.
- I sure do.

363
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,400
- I grew up in a town like this.
- You were smart enough to leave.

364
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:06,480
- Why did you not leave?
- "For better or for worse."

365
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,680
How about you? Are you married?

366
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:19,280
I was... as I remember. She did not
last very long, I was never home.

367
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:25,200
She got fed up with phone calls from
Miami and postcards from Des Moines.

368
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,040
There was always a guy around.

369
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,160
Any guy that could spare the time for
a movie or a beer -

370
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,360
- or a quarter for the jukebox.

371
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,320
She left.

372
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,440
- How about you?
- You know the South, Mr Anderson.

373
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,400
Leave high school, marry the first boy
who makes you laugh.

374
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,160
Your husband is quite a guy.

375
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,200
My boss has this thing about an hour.

376
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,800
50 minutes that your husband says
he is with you.

377
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,240
- And I guess he was?
- Guess he was.

378
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,800
That is a pity. Then I do not have
an excuse for hanging around here.

379
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,600
- Thank you for the ice-tea.
- Thank you for the flowers.

380
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:40,720
- Do you know what kind they are?
- I was told they are trumpet pitchers.

381
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,480
Right, my daddy used to call them
ladies from hell because they are...

382
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,640
...Carnivorous.
- Yes, that is the word.

383
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:56,240
The pretty colour is the bait. The
insects tune in on them and they die...

384
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,000
Maybe I should have picked
something more appropriate.

385
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:21,960
"May the peace, the joy and the holy
ghost abide to you forever. Amen."

386
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,560
You have already been told once, nigger.
We do not have to tell you again.

387
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,600
If you make any more trouble flapping
your lips at those federal men, -

388
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,160
- we will have to put you in the ground.
Without a pine box.

389
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,840
Do you understand me?

390
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,560
How have the negroes been treated?

391
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,800
They are treated about fair.
As good as they ought to be.

392
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,800
The niggers around here
have been treated bad for a long time.

393
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,040
I think Martin Luther King
is one of the leaders.

394
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,360
J. Edgar Hoover said that he was
a communist, they had proof of that.

395
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,320
I do not know that for sure,
but that is what they say.

396
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,080
You really want to find that nigger?

397
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:57,160
They say we have to eat together and
use the same bathrooms as the niggers.

398
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,560
That is hard for some Mississippi folk.

399
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,280
They are not like us.
They do not take baths, they stink...

400
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,320
They are nasty...
They are just not like white folks.

401
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:18,320
- What happened to the three boys?
- Dead.

402
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,880
They are as dead as they can be.

403
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,160
Is she asleep? Is she?

404
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,520
I am sorry I woke you up.

405
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,600
Honey, I will be away a couple of hours.

406
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,440
- Mary, is that your Bessie's kid?
- Yes, she is growing up real quick.

407
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,520
Tuesday will be fine on those, Mary.

408
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,240
Funny...

409
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,240
Their kids are so cute.

410
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:20,320
Is that thing on again? If all of secret
service could not protect the President -

411
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,560
- how are we suppossed to protect
a few negroes?

412
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:29,080
It is nothing but a bunch of lowlife
white trash drinking too much alcohol.

413
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:34,000
More like paint thinner and snake juice.
This state is as dry as a Martini.

414
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,320
We have the alcoholics to prove it.

415
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,600
- Your name, please?
- Clayton Townley, local businessman.

416
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,240
Are you spokesman for the Ku Klux Klan?

417
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:58,280
I told you: I am a businessman. I am
also a Mississippian and an American.

418
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,920
I am tired of the way the Mississippians'
views are being distorted -

419
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,280
- by the newspapers and on TV.

420
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,360
So let us get this straight:

421
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,080
We do not accept Jews
because they reject Christ.

422
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:16,200
Their control of the international bank
cartels are today's communism.

423
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,800
We do not accept papists
because they bowed to a Roman dictator.

424
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,600
We do not accept Turks, Mongrels,
Orientals or Negroes -

425
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,880
- because we want to protect Anglo-Saxon
Democracy and the American Way.

426
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,720
Thank you, sir.

427
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:46,400
This coloured boy wants to
play football for Barry Bryan in Alabama.

428
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,440
So Barry says: "I will give you a try."

429
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,840
What will he run with? A watermelon?

430
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,400
He is going to keep on running, too.

431
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,560
He says:
"You get down there on the goal line."

432
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:03,960
He puts a whole other team there.

433
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:14,960
