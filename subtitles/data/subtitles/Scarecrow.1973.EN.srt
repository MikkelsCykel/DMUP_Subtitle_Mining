8
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,812

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,227
You talk to him.

12
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,787
Wait a minute. I値l get him on the wire.
Hold on there.

13
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,004
George. What the hell happened?

14
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,898
I talked to him.
I got Frank on the wire here.

15
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,536
You wanna talk to him?
All right, go ahead. Talk.

24

Okay, Lionel.

31
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:22,830
- From now on, you are "Lion," okay?
- Okay. Sounds good.

32
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:29,871
I知 gonna help you out here, young lady.

33
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:33,881
We really want to get our coffee.
Freezing our ass off.

34
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,720
I値l have some oatmeal.

35
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,589
What do you want?

36
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,623
Some corn flakes with a little milk.

37
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,887
- Oatmeal?
- Yeah, oatmeal.

38
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:51,233
And some scrambled eggs.

39
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,892
Anything else?

40
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:57,532
Bacon.

41
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,901
Toast.

42
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:02,641
Let me get that cream.

43
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:06,705
- You got any money?
- Yeah. Some. Not much.

44
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:11,276
That's okay,
because l got enough to get us started.

45
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:16,249
What kind of business?

46
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:31,835
Car wash.

47
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:35,536
- Car wash.
- Yeah.

48
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:40,909
It's nothing fancy, but everything is there,
and the best, too.

49
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:47,313
And l got the money to get us rolling.
It'll be "Maxy's Car Wash."

50
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:50,723
Car wash. Okay.

51
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:53,622
For every car, there is dirt.

52
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:58,731
- So we're partners. I think l get this.
- All right.

53
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:01,265
This your first day?

54
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:08,534
- Yeah. Partners.
- Great.

55
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:13,314
But you gotta work, though.

56
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:15,816
- Ain't afraid of that.
- All right.

57
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:20,487
- Fair and square, all right?
- Sure.

58
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:30,024
- What, you been drifting?
- Yeah. I致e been at sea.

59
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:32,127
- Yeah?
- Five years.

60
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,726
You?

61
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,470
No, l...

62
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:45,569
- I致e been in the joint.
- Joint?

63
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:51,846
I was in Quentin.

64
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:56,384
- How long?
- Six years.

65
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,590
That's a long time.

66
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:03,731
Why Detroit?

67
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,538
I値l show you something.

68
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:13,608
Open that up.

69
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:22,776
- It's a lamp.
- That's right.

70
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:25,554
Guy's carrying around a lamp in a box.

71
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:27,316
- For my kid.
- Yeah?

72
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:32,459
- You got a kid?
- Yeah, in Detroit.

73
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,928
I致e never seen it, so l don't know
if it's a boy or a girl.

74
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,991
That's why l got a lamp.

75
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:43,400
I figure a lamp would do fine either way,
you know what l mean?

76
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:45,997
- You never seen the kid, though?
- No.

77
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:49,001
But l send a lot of money to it.

78
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,013
- All the money l ever earned, l sent.
- Yeah?

79
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,147
Wasn't much, but l knew it helped.

80
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:01,313
- You got kids?
- No.

81
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:06,726
Listen, you can make a lot of money
in the car wash business.

82
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:11,356
Yeah. And you'll do better
than you ever have.

83
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:15,268
I got it all down to the percent.

84
00:14:15,538 --> 00:14:18,029
I know every penny, inside and out.

85
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:21,740
It's a foolproof enterprise.
Absolutely foolproof.

86
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,437
All right. Let's get started.

87
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:25,537
Hey, fella, you got nothing better to do...

88
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,674
than listen in
on other people's conversations?

89
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:38,683
I gotta tell you something about me.

90
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,955
I知 like the meanest son of a bitch alive.
You know what l mean?

91
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,134
I don't trust anybody. I don't love anybody.

92
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,976
And l can tear the ass
out of a goddamn elephant, too.

93
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,952
- We're gonna be partners, okay?
- Okay.

94
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,749
All right. Come on.

95
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,687
- Right?
- Right.

96
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,783
All right. But...

97
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:16,295
- you gotta be straight with me, right?
- Sure.

98
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:18,299
I mean fair and square.

99
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:22,195
We'll have a real good car wash business.

100
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,139
- Okay?
- Right.

101
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:28,907
Otherwise, I値l break your back.

102
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,479
Sounds fair.

103
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:36,114
Like this.

104
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:40,680
Damn.

105
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:47,489
- Don't bust my lamp, that's all.
- Yeah.

106
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,962
Can l have a bottle of beer
and a chocolate doughnut?

107
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,714
Do you think there's anything
we can do around here?

108
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:18,384
- Like, for a job?
- Yeah.

109
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,628
And stay out! I値l kick your ass!

110
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:32,196
- Son of a bitch, you... Come on out here!
- Get out of here, you bums!

111
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,509
- Go on!
- Get out of here!

112
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,106
Get going!

113
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,807
Hit the pavement!

114
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,944
- Get out of here!
- Come on!

115
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:48,251
- You're crazy! Get out of here!
- Fuck you!

116
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:54,628
Man, l didn't start it. I didn't.

117
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,757
- I did, right, Max?
- Yeah.

118
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,300
That bastard.

119
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:05,333
Bust his goddamn ass for him.

120
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:09,605
If l could have got a hold
of that fat bastard out in the alley...

121
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:11,703
I壇 have whipped his ass.

122
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,149
- You get in a lot of fights, don't you?
- You wanna start with me?

123
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,821
Go ahead. Put them up.

124
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,256
Guy must've had false teeth.

125
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:35,401
First time l got busted was for fighting.

126
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:41,001
I was screwing this cabdriver's wife.

127
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,739
He came home early.

128
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,375
We ended up out in the street,
and l was naked.

129
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:54,113
That's a beauty.

130
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:01,658
I really nailed him.

131
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,100
He was kind of a nice guy, too.
It's a shame.

132
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:12,938
You don't have to hit people.
Not if you make them laugh.

133
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:14,404
Bullshit.

134
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:18,174
Max, you know the story
of the scarecrow?

135
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:20,873
No.

136
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:23,110
You think crows are scared
of a scarecrow?

137
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,987
Yeah, l think they're scared. Why?

138
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,758
- No, crows are not scared, believe me.
- No, the goddamn crows are scared.

139
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:34,352
No. Crows are laughing.

140
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:40,298
- That's bullshit.
- That's right. Crows are laughing.

141
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:45,596
Look, the farmer puts out
a scarecrow, right...

142
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:48,507
with a funny hat on it. Got a funny face.

143
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:53,739
Crows fly by. They see that,
strikes them funny, makes them laugh.

144
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,877
The goddamn crows are laughing?

145
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:58,977
That's right. They're laughing
their asses off. Then they say:

146
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,683
"That old farmer Jones down there,
he's a pretty good guy.

147
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,219
"He made us laugh.
So we won't bother him anymore."

148
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:08,923
- The goddamn crows are laughing.
- They laugh.

149
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:15,094
I gotta tell you something.

150
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,507
That's the most harebrained idea
I致e ever heard.

151
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,306
Well, it's true. Laughing their asses off.

152
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:28,611
The crows are laughing at it?

153
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:32,784
Yeah, man.

154
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,187
- I guess the fish are reciting poetry.
- I guess so.

155
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:39,658
And the pigs are playing banjo?

156
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,897
And the dogs, let's see...

157
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:46,401
the dogs would be playing hockey, right?

158
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:50,702
- And the...
- Crows are laughing.

159
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:52,568
Crows are laughing. Right.

160
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:55,075
In the joint, l heard some tales.

161
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:57,974
Oh, boy, howdy. I heard some tall tales.

162
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,777
But at least those guys in there,
they had the decency to admit...

163
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,546
that that was just bullshit.
You know what l mean?

164
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,417
It was just bullshit.

165
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:10,086
They actually... They took pride...

166
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,960
Pride in it, that it was bullshit.

167
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,823
But the crows are laughing?

168
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:21,100
Oh, brother.

169
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:28,604
I mean, you're not playing
with a full deck, man.

170
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:31,271
You got one foot in the great beyond.

171
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:36,373
Max, what do you do when it's cold?

172
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,351
I put on more clothes.

173
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,515
I知 a cold-blooded bastard.
I can never get warm enough.

174
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:49,228
Gotta take a little nap after every fight.

175
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:56,368
- What's with the shoe?
- What's with minding your own business?

176
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,667
Boy, some partner l picked.

177
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:04,943
You didn't pick me. I picked you.

178
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:10,542
Why?

179
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,518
Because you gave me your last match.

180
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,828
You made me laugh.

181
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:41,875
The damn crows are laughing.

182
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:46,279
I remember the first time
l was in Catholic school.

183
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:50,121
A nun called me up in front of the class,
says, "Francis, stick out your hand."

184
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:51,557
So l stick out my hand.

185
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:54,857
She whacks it with a stick.
I said, "What did l do?"

186
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,490
She said, "You were talking."
I said, "No, l wasn't."

187
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,931
She says, "Yes, you were."

188
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:01,799
I said, "How could l be talking?
I don't know anybody here.

189
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,270
"This is my first day in school."

190
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,308
That's as far as we can take you.

191
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:10,240
Hey, chief, l thought
you were gonna take us to a town.

192
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:11,973
This is our town.

193
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:17,744
No wonder they lost the war.

194
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:21,281
Nobody can understand them.

195
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:41,139
- Been eating rice for a year?
- Yeah. We all have.

196
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:48,513
- My system couldn't handle that.
- No, it's very good for your system.

197
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,442
Look at my baby.

198
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,946
- He's healthy and pure.
- Yeah. Right.

199
00:22:55,257 --> 00:22:56,952
He likes you, Max.

200
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:04,189
I think your...

201
00:23:09,037 --> 00:23:11,938
This is it. This is our spot.

202
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,730
Are you sure?

203
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,608
Yeah, right here.
This is where we were going.

204
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,240
- Sure we can't take you anywhere?
- No, this is fine, man.

205
00:23:22,617 --> 00:23:24,482
You guys take it easy.

206
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:27,619
- Thanks for the lift.
- All right.

207
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,950
Okay, I値l close it.

208
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:32,152
- Have a nice day.
- All right.

209
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,089
Bye. Hope he feels better.

210
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:41,065
Give me half an hour with those kids,
I壇 get them straightened out.

211
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:43,604
- What happened?
- Can you imagine?

212
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:46,706
The kid unloaded on me...

213
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:49,869
and that broad has the nerve to say,
"Have a nice day."

214
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:54,742
- Let's get a drink.
- Okay.

215
00:23:56,284 --> 00:23:59,651
How come you didn't pound
that old lady in the mouth?

216
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:01,778
What old lady?

217
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,020
The one that hit you in the palms
with the stick.

218
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:06,918
She was a nun.

219
00:24:09,731 --> 00:24:13,599
Shut the door, you big dope.
You're letting all the smoke out.

220
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,768
Look at the size of that one.

221
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:26,137
How you doing, old-timer?

222
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:28,380
What'll you have, fellas?

223
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,146
Better check the big one's ID, Charlie.

224
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:33,787
If he can get it out of his pants.

225
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,117
Don't bother about her.
That's just Darlene. What'll you have?

226
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:42,459
- Give me a bottle of beer.
- Bourbon here.

227
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:46,926
Max, these two guys go into a bar, right.

228
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:50,169
And one guy says to the bartender,
"Two mugs."

229
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,332
Bartender says,
"l know that. What'll you have?"

230
00:24:54,142 --> 00:24:56,440
Bad. Better make that a double.

231
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,911
Don't go getting dangerous on us,
Superman.

232
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:07,054
Max, I知 the tallest man in this bar.

233
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:13,653
Scarecrow, what are you gonna do
when your old lady kicks you...

234
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,720
along with your lamp,
when you get to Detroit?

235
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:20,225
- I値l make her laugh first.
- You're gonna make her laugh first?

236
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:22,702
That's right. Can l have a glass?

237
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,863
- Where's the can?
- Over there.

238
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,534
People can't stay mad at you
if you make them laugh.

239
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,134
- Okay, you keep them laughing.
- Okay.

240
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,443
Hey, you. Big mouth.

241
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,283
He acts like the chief of police.

242
00:25:38,353 --> 00:25:40,787
Why don't you just unplug it?

243
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:43,517
Don't you point at me,
you rude son of a bitch.

244
00:25:43,892 --> 00:25:46,520
- Get out of here.
- No. Come on, cool it.

245
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:47,789
Stupid broad.

246
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:50,387
- What did you call me?
- I said, "Stupid broad."

247
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,591
Get out of here.

248
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:54,897
- I値l put you into the goddamn wall.
- You are real tough.

249
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:59,634
- I値l have a heart attack right on the floor.
- You'll never make it. Not with those.

250
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:03,166
Why don't you go in there
and empty your little lizard?

251
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,878
- I am talking to you!
- Get over here! Max!

252
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,042
Look!

253
00:26:16,224 --> 00:26:18,385
Come over here, you.

254
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:21,289
Goddamn.

255
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,725
Damn it.

256
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:29,201
- Come on.
- We can't.

257
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:33,737
Come on, for Christ's sake.
Get your shoes off.

258
00:26:36,811 --> 00:26:38,438
- I hurt you?
- No.

259
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:49,487
You got your boots on?

260
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:53,454
Let me give you a hand.

261
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,859
The boots.

262
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:01,965
- Why you worrying about them boots?
- Where are you...

263
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,733
- Wait. I can't see you.
- Just be patient.

264
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:06,068
A little patient.

265
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:07,836
Don't break my glasses.

266
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:11,106
Because l won't be able
to see anything if you do.

267
00:27:15,684 --> 00:27:16,878
Water.

268
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:23,688
Gotta wash your hands first.

269
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:25,589
- Are you nuts?
- What?

270
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:28,388
Gotta wash your hands first.

271
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,292
Oh, man.

272
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,091
Come on, Max.

273
00:27:33,168 --> 00:27:35,966
Who is this guy?
What a schmuck, this guy.

274
00:27:37,138 --> 00:27:38,366
Bull's-eye!

275
00:27:39,374 --> 00:27:41,433
- Max!
- Yeah?

276
00:27:42,844 --> 00:27:45,074
You ever see dawn from a ship?

277
00:27:48,616 --> 00:27:51,016
- Ever see dawn from a ship?
- No.

278
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,314
Oh, man.

279
00:27:53,355 --> 00:27:56,791
Always the same,
no matter what part of the world l was in.

280
00:27:56,858 --> 00:27:59,156
Always made me feel like a kid.

281
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:02,018
You are a kid.

282
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:09,628
- Feel better?
- Yeah. I知 telling you...

283
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:14,474
getting laid is sure good for my regularity.

284
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,241
- Max, I致e been meaning to ask you.
- Yeah?

285
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:21,674
In the joint, no women, right?

286
00:28:22,717 --> 00:28:23,809
No.

287
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:25,785
So how'd you get laid?

288
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,794
I知 gonna have that car wash.

289
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,504
And a deep freezer full of steaks.

290
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,873
And ass, buddy. I mean ass.

291
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:53,009
You should be more careful
where you drop your drawers.

292
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:56,278
Some scorpion will put
a lip-lock on your big ass.

293
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:58,916
It'll be his funeral.

294
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,346
- You ever eat in a hobo jungle?
- No.

295
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:08,089
Coley and me used to hit it
once in a while when we were drifting.

296
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,324
I haven't been there in about nine years.

297
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:13,431
We'll have breakfast there
tomorrow morning.

298
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:19,401
That's it. Damn it. That's where it was.

299
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:25,842
They must've chased all the hoboes
out into the desert...

300
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:28,745
or put them in the jail.

301
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,183
Looks like we buy our breakfast.

302
00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:36,518
How in the hell was l supposed to know
they tore the goddamn jungle down?

303
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:40,322
Coley and me used to eat there
with old-timers all the time.

304
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:44,756
Jesus Christ.
It's like I致e been asleep for nine years.

305
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,458
Shit!

306
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,071
Nine years.

307
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:55,675
- Max, so what?
- What do you mean, so what?

308
00:29:55,743 --> 00:29:58,940
I didn't plan, God damn it!
That's "so what." Look.

309
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:03,583
This is nine years of planning. Right there.

310
00:30:07,155 --> 00:30:11,319
Initial bank savings: So and so.
Accumulated bank interest: So and so.

311
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:14,555
Expected salary while l was
in the penitentiary: So and so.

312
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:17,826
Total: $2,648.73.

313
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,527
That's planning ahead. You understand?

314
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:25,637
By the way, that's something you don't do.

315
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:30,602
Just because the world
goes on changing, you know...

316
00:30:30,678 --> 00:30:33,044
it changes.
There's nothing you can do about it.

317
00:30:33,114 --> 00:30:36,743
Speaking of changing, it's been five years.
Your wife might be married.

318
00:30:36,818 --> 00:30:40,254
She might've moved away.
Why don't you give her a call?

319
00:30:40,321 --> 00:30:42,585
What are you shouting at, Max?

320
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,694
I wanna see my kid, right?

321
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:51,129
What am l gonna do,
shove the lamp through the phone?

322
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:56,662
Detroit's a long way from Pittsburgh.
Just call her. Plan ahead.

323
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:59,263
That's what I知 doing. I知 planning.

324
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:04,034
Look, if l go back and l call her,
she could tell me to buzz off.

325
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:07,971
And that's it.
But if l go there, and l see her...

326
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,843
don't matter what she says to me then
because l see my kid.

327
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,548
See, that's the worst that can happen.

328
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,055
I know what I知 doing.

329
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:29,092
All those old-timers.
This is all busted up. Hell.

330
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:35,902
Wonder what Coley would say.

331
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,711
There it is. That's Coley's house.
I didn't even have to look at the number.

332
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:56,321
- Flower house.
- It's a flower house. Right.

333
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:00,687
Coley!

334
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,802
Come on.

335
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,451
Coming.

336
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,625
What can l do for you?

337
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:45,135
God damn it, Max! Jesus Christ almighty!

338
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,877
- You look like Uncle Bert.
- Don't say that.

339
00:33:50,378 --> 00:33:53,575
- It's true, though, you do.
- Don't say it, though.

340
00:33:53,981 --> 00:33:55,448
Jesus Christ.

341
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,044
God damn it. Shit.

342
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:06,722
Let me look at that mug there.

343
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:09,322
That's beautiful.

344
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:18,636
Look at that mug, would you?
Is that beautiful, Lion?

345
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,032
This is my friend and business partner.

346
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:22,337
- Hi.
- Hi.

347
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:25,212
Are you all right? Did you hurt yourself?

348
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:26,712
- I知 okay.
- You sure?

349
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:29,716
Hi, Coley.
Max has told me nothing about you.

350
00:34:31,753 --> 00:34:34,187
Come on inside. God, Max. Come on.

351
00:34:44,098 --> 00:34:45,497
God damn it.

352
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,094
- Put your stuff down.
- Okay.

353
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:53,498
- What is all this?
- We went into the junk business.

354
00:34:53,574 --> 00:34:54,939
- "We"?
- Yep.

355
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,472
- You still married to that guy...
- Howard? No, sir.

356
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:03,779
I got me a business partner.
Name's Frenchy. She's dying to meet you.

357
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:05,949
Max, this is for you.

358
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:09,920
Max, let's see if you're still any good.
Come on. Put them up.

359
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:12,892
All right.
You know I知 the toughest, right?

360
00:35:16,964 --> 00:35:18,989
- Come on.
- Come on.

361
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:22,693
Hi.

362
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:29,166
He's just like you said.
Just like l thought he would be.

363
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:31,142
He's Max.

364
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:35,713
Yeah, I知 Max.
You cute little motor scooter, you.

365
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:40,081
Max, this is a lie detector,
and it really works.

366
00:35:40,154 --> 00:35:42,315
It's a gift to you from Coley's junkettes.

367
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:47,191
A lie detector? You know l just got out
of the joint, Coley. What do l need it for?

368
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:49,252
Put them on him. Come on.

369
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,996
Yeah, put them on me.

370
00:36:00,107 --> 00:36:02,405
Hello, Coley. Nice of you to call.

371
00:36:02,476 --> 00:36:05,775
- You have to concentrate.
- Okay. It's gonna be hard.

372
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:10,310
- Did you turn it on?
- You're turned on.

373
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:12,377
Stop.

374
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,281
Ask me why...

375
00:36:14,355 --> 00:36:16,915
How come you wear all these clothes?

376
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:18,822
All right. Why did the moron jingle?

377
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:19,985
Keep me warm.

378
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:21,358
Okay, let's see.

379
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,920
Ask me if l like you.

380
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:27,228
- Okay. Do you like me?
- Yes, l like you.

381
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:29,898
It says that's true.

382
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:35,866
- What is your name?
- Francis Lionel Delbucci.

383
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,410
- That's true.
- That's true.

384
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:39,946
- Where you headed?
- Pittsburgh.

385
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,476
Where?

386
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,752
Detroit, then Pittsburgh.

387
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,718
And is that your home, Detroit?

388
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,853
What did you miss most
when you were in prison?

389
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,567
Home cooking.

390
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:07,966
Coley, I知 gonna cook tonight.

391
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:11,139
Terrific.

392
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,600
- Hi there.
- Hi.

393
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:46,474
- Oh, no. This can't happen to me.
- What is it?

394
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:48,037
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

395
00:37:48,115 --> 00:37:50,174
A little person's got my fingers.

396
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:52,719
Let go. Come on, get your hands off.

397
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:55,017
You're crazy. Honestly.

398
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,338
- What is it?
- What are you doing?

399
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:17,205
- Making pie.
- Pie?

400
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:20,379
- What kind?
- Chocolate.

401
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:26,818
Keep it up.

402
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:30,254
Hey, Lion!

403
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,686
What?

404
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:37,263
- Where's my beer?
- The beer, it's coming.

405
00:38:37,531 --> 00:38:41,365
Listen, I値l bring the beer out myself
in just a minute, okay?

406
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:53,678
- No beer?
- She wants to bring it out.

407
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,511
Yeah? That's good.

408
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,813
Give me a hand here, will you?

409
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,078
All right, go.

410
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:10,363
That Frenchy has some set of jugs,
doesn't she?

411
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,058
Real eye-poppers.

412
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,959
- Let's put this over here by the fence.
- Okay.

413
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:20,568
If you'll work...
You gotta work, you know?

414
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,411
Coley, she works, right?

415
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:28,644
I don't understand how she keeps
everything in such a mess.

416
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:30,809
When we get the car wash...

417
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:33,680
everything's gonna be in order, right?

418
00:39:34,688 --> 00:39:35,950
Squared away.

419
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:38,958
Squared away.
And that's gonna be Maxy's job.

420
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:42,118
Keeping things in order,
washing those cars...

421
00:39:42,596 --> 00:39:44,894
and walking over to the bank.

422
00:39:45,032 --> 00:39:47,592
What do l do? What's my specialty?

423
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,868
I think your specialty
is going to be waxing.

424
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:55,636
Waxing? No.

425
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:59,201
No, and, keeping the customers happy.

426
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,314
That's it. That's my specialty.

427
00:40:01,382 --> 00:40:04,283
Keep them happy, keep them happy.

428
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:08,554
Look at this rusty piece of shit here.

429
00:40:29,442 --> 00:40:32,036
I could have sworn they were out here.

430
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,340
There you are!

431
00:40:46,126 --> 00:40:49,061
Here you are. Just as promised.

432
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,857
- Thank you.
- Here.

433
00:40:52,065 --> 00:40:53,396
Thank you.

434
00:40:55,201 --> 00:40:58,398
- How's your cake coming?
- Okay. It's a pie.

435
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:05,644
Good heavens.

436
00:41:07,981 --> 00:41:10,575
There ain't no better sound on earth.

437
00:41:12,685 --> 00:41:13,947
Maybe...

438
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:17,780
a couple of other things.

439
00:41:20,693 --> 00:41:23,924
- I値l go get you another one.
- No, that's all right.

440
00:41:23,997 --> 00:41:26,591
Wait till after l move this dryer here.

441
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:28,959
Can you just...

442
00:41:30,537 --> 00:41:33,335
You show me where to put it?

443
00:41:42,982 --> 00:41:44,449
Could you...

444
00:41:46,186 --> 00:41:48,381
Why don't you go right there...

445
00:41:49,889 --> 00:41:53,484
and fix the doors,
like we talked about before?

446
00:41:57,464 --> 00:41:59,261
- Fix the doors?
- Yeah.

447
00:42:03,937 --> 00:42:06,531
I don't know where to put it, really.

448
00:42:09,442 --> 00:42:12,673
Just anyplace. Coley usually does that.

449
00:42:12,745 --> 00:42:14,804
No. That's not right.

450
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,481
You see...

451
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:23,153
everything has its own place, right?

452
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,223
I mean, you have your own place.

453
00:42:27,961 --> 00:42:30,828
Hey, Max. Maybe l should move them?

454
00:42:32,232 --> 00:42:33,392
Right.

455
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:37,366
- Maybe l should move them.
- Yeah.

456
00:42:39,506 --> 00:42:43,033
That old dryer there,
it has to have its place, too.

457
00:42:45,478 --> 00:42:46,638
Right.

458
00:42:48,181 --> 00:42:50,172
- You're right.
- I知 right.

459
00:42:51,651 --> 00:42:53,983
Let's see. Just leave it there.

460
00:42:54,687 --> 00:42:57,520
- That's its place.
- That's real good.

461
00:43:02,428 --> 00:43:04,953
You and Coley hit it off pretty good,
don't you?

462
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:07,226
Yeah. She's my very best friend.

463
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,098
Excuse me. I have to get through here.

464
00:43:11,571 --> 00:43:13,095
You gotta work.

465
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:16,240
There we go.

466
00:43:21,114 --> 00:43:25,016
Damn kid didn't do anything
for the two hours we were out here.

467
00:43:31,024 --> 00:43:32,992
Why do they call you Frenchy?

468
00:43:37,797 --> 00:43:39,424
I don't know why.

469
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:42,863
I mean, it started
back when l was in high school.

470
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:48,029
Kids just started calling me Frenchy.
I don't know why.

471
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:03,082
What's for dinner?

472
00:44:08,695 --> 00:44:09,753
Shit.

473
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,921
I couldn't have been more than 11.

474
00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:16,230
No, 10, because Max was 16. That's right.

475
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:22,036
I was picking fruit all day,
and he was working in the slaughterhouse.

476
00:44:22,675 --> 00:44:25,872
I was draining blood
out of pigs for seven months.

477
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:30,206
Till the bastards found out
how old l was and canned me.

478
00:44:30,984 --> 00:44:32,417
Son of a bitch.

479
00:44:32,485 --> 00:44:35,079
Remember, then we got a job
in that fishery?

480
00:44:35,154 --> 00:44:38,248
And that foreman.
He tried to cheat you out of your...

481
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:40,652
Tried to cheat her out of her pay.

482
00:44:40,727 --> 00:44:43,059
I heard he grabbed her on the ass, too.

483
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:47,129
I hit that son of a bitch with a rock
right in the chops.

484
00:44:48,034 --> 00:44:50,195
Goddamn bastard.

485
00:44:51,337 --> 00:44:52,497
Jesus.

486
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:56,537
- I really gave it to him, you know?
- You sure did.

487
00:44:57,043 --> 00:44:59,671
- Screw the world, right?
- Right.

488
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:01,844
Feed them fish heads.

489
00:45:02,515 --> 00:45:05,075
- Right, Coley?
- Right.

490
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,550
- Am l right?
- Absolutely.

491
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:08,917
God damn it!
Did we fight our way through it or not?

492
00:45:08,988 --> 00:45:12,424
- We sure did.
- We fought our way through.

493
00:45:12,492 --> 00:45:14,460
- Okay.
- Shit.

494
00:45:14,527 --> 00:45:17,655
Take it easy, Max.
You have a whole half a life to go.

495
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:20,062
I知 gonna spend it washing cars.

496
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:24,598
I got my own place.

497
00:45:28,808 --> 00:45:32,835
Nobody gonna lay down the law on me,
God damn it! Son of a bitch.

498
00:45:33,379 --> 00:45:35,370
That's my own investment.

499
00:45:35,748 --> 00:45:38,717
Plastic pipe for durability.

500
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:42,185
- $600.
- Gotcha.

501
00:45:42,255 --> 00:45:44,155
Pure hair hand brushes.

502
00:45:44,824 --> 00:45:47,691
Two hundred smackers, right? Okay.

503
00:45:51,431 --> 00:45:55,128
The finest Mediterranean sponges. $300.

504
00:45:56,736 --> 00:45:58,829
$300 for the sponges.

505
00:45:58,905 --> 00:46:01,237
Pure flannel for polishing and drying.

506
00:46:01,774 --> 00:46:04,868
- I got an idea how to save money.
- How?

507
00:46:05,812 --> 00:46:08,906
Just put all your clothes on
and roll over the cars.

508
00:46:08,981 --> 00:46:10,846
Okay. Up yours, buddy.

509
00:46:15,254 --> 00:46:17,882
Wax buffers, $600. No.

510
00:46:19,158 --> 00:46:22,650
Wax buffers are $300.
$300 for wax buffers.

511
00:46:22,829 --> 00:46:24,922
- Buckets, 100. Big ones.
- Buckets.

512
00:46:25,064 --> 00:46:27,259
Big ones. You gotta have a lot of buckets.

513
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:30,393
- Gotta have a lot of buckets. And a radio.
- You got it.

514
00:46:30,703 --> 00:46:33,137
You gotta have a radio. And...

515
00:46:35,374 --> 00:46:37,569
Let's see, you gotta have...

516
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:41,505
You know what's happening, don't you?

517
00:46:44,183 --> 00:46:46,447
Gotta have a... And you and me, buddy...

518
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:50,421
scrubbing away, rain or shine,
and making that dough.

519
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,486
- You know what l mean?
- Raking it in.

520
00:46:53,893 --> 00:46:55,417
Bringing it in.

521
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:00,194
Go right back there. That's right.

522
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:02,560
Bring it in and bring the...

523
00:47:05,171 --> 00:47:09,198
And drinking spiked coffee, man,
and listening to the hit parade.

524
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:10,640
You got it.

525
00:47:13,546 --> 00:47:16,743
- Do they still have the hit parade?
- I don't know.

526
00:47:17,049 --> 00:47:19,040
Will you find out for me?

527
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:25,685
Old waxy Maxy, he knows. He's got it
all down. Don't worry about it.

528
00:47:27,627 --> 00:47:29,754
Want some more coffee, Lion?

529
00:47:32,231 --> 00:47:35,689
Don't you think it's time
you invited me to your house?

530
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:38,703
Gee, l thought you'd never ask me.

531
00:47:44,177 --> 00:47:45,667
Wait a minute.

532
00:47:47,647 --> 00:47:48,739
Okay.

533
00:48:00,626 --> 00:48:03,026
Come on, then, my little darling.

534
00:48:03,162 --> 00:48:05,756
You get your little self right there.

535
00:48:11,971 --> 00:48:13,962
You study them prices...

536
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,565
and you look at that catalog, right?

537
00:48:17,276 --> 00:48:20,006
And you just remember, up theirs.

538
00:48:21,647 --> 00:48:23,842
- That's anybody's.
- Anybody's.

539
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,963
About a week ago, l walk into this shop...

540
00:48:45,037 --> 00:48:47,164
to get a present for my kid.

541
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,341
And the salesgirl says,
"How old's the kid?"

542
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:54,146
I say, "Five." She says, "Boy or girl?"

543
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,974
"I don't know."

544
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:04,383
"See," l say,
"it never made any difference before..."

545
00:49:04,457 --> 00:49:06,322
but she says, "Five...

546
00:49:07,093 --> 00:49:09,220
"now it makes a difference."

547
00:49:11,931 --> 00:49:14,195
I guess that's when l grew up...

548
00:49:14,267 --> 00:49:16,030
because that was it.

549
00:49:18,204 --> 00:49:22,265
I knew l had to go back,
see my kid, face Annie.

550
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:25,169
What about Annie?

551
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,815
I don't know.
That's what I知 gonna find out.

552
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,511
And I知 glad of it, too, because...

553
00:49:38,157 --> 00:49:40,148
I知 headed for something.

554
00:49:43,195 --> 00:49:44,787
- You know?
- Yeah.

555
00:49:46,532 --> 00:49:49,126
And it's gonna be big. I can feel it.

556
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,033
'Cause I知 changing.

557
00:49:54,607 --> 00:49:57,132
I wish Max was headed for something.

558
00:50:05,384 --> 00:50:08,649
He is. Pittsburgh. With me.

559
00:50:10,389 --> 00:50:14,223
Listen, Lion, Max is very practical,
but he's very dumb.

560
00:50:17,997 --> 00:50:22,263
He's been putting money into that
stupid bank in Pittsburgh for years.

561
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:26,772
I don't see why it has to be Pittsburgh.
Why can't you open a car wash right here?

562
00:50:32,011 --> 00:50:33,103
Sure.

563
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:37,472
Maybe we could come back.

564
00:50:37,717 --> 00:50:39,275
- Really?
- Sure.

565
00:50:42,288 --> 00:50:44,984
Maybe we can come back from Pittsburgh.

566
00:50:46,592 --> 00:50:49,959
I tell you, that Frenchy
is 160-weight of mean woman!

567
00:50:50,763 --> 00:50:55,200
She did things l didn't think you could do
unless you were a snake. God almighty.

568
00:50:55,267 --> 00:50:57,929
- I gotta admire her talent.
- Yeah. And patient.

569
00:50:58,004 --> 00:51:00,564
I was so drunk, l kept falling off the bed.

570
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:04,200
She just reached down
and pulled me right back up again.

571
00:51:05,544 --> 00:51:08,069
- That is something.
- Hell of a woman.

572
00:51:10,683 --> 00:51:12,241
Hell of a woman.

573
00:51:25,498 --> 00:51:27,125
- Hey, Max?
- What?

574
00:51:27,566 --> 00:51:29,090
I致e been thinking.

575
00:51:29,168 --> 00:51:31,728
Maybe we ought to come back here
after Pittsburgh.

576
00:51:31,804 --> 00:51:34,671
- Now, listen...
- Down to the penny. I know all that.

577
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:38,335
- What's that got to do with Pittsburgh?
- That's where my money is.

578
00:51:38,878 --> 00:51:41,244
You got a special deal
with the bank president?

579
00:51:41,313 --> 00:51:43,076
You gonna wash cars in his vault?

580
00:51:43,149 --> 00:51:46,448
- Look, l make plans, l stick with them.
- All right.

581
00:51:49,188 --> 00:51:52,089
We got just enough money
to get us to Pittsburgh.

582
00:51:52,158 --> 00:51:55,286
Including a little stop-off in Detroit
to take care of your crap.

583
00:51:55,361 --> 00:51:57,420
- We're leaving tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

584
00:51:57,496 --> 00:52:00,897
Yeah, tomorrow.
Now let's go get Coley's birthday present.

585
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:18,839
These are nice.

586
00:52:22,421 --> 00:52:23,752
Listen...

587
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:28,855
when l yawn like that, you know...

588
00:52:28,928 --> 00:52:32,125
you get the girl's attention
at the cash register.

589
00:52:32,631 --> 00:52:34,155
Just like that.

590
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:37,194
- Get her attention.
- Why?

591
00:52:41,941 --> 00:52:43,306
Take a walk.

592
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:05,520
- I told you to get her attention, not mine.
- You didn't have to look.

593
00:54:05,591 --> 00:54:07,525
What do you mean, l didn't have to look?

594
00:54:07,593 --> 00:54:11,586
A madman goes crazy in a
department store and I知 not gonna look?

595
00:54:11,864 --> 00:54:15,027
This round's on the house.
Coley, happy birthday.

596
00:54:16,502 --> 00:54:18,060
This is for you.

597
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:20,771
All right, here you go.

598
00:54:21,407 --> 00:54:22,567
Everything's okay?

599
00:54:22,641 --> 00:54:26,600
I need a little help.
Somebody sprung a little for a free drink.

600
00:54:26,879 --> 00:54:29,712
- That's really nice.
- All l have to say...

601
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:36,715
it痴 mighty decent of you girls
to spring for this good-bye dinner.

602
00:54:37,223 --> 00:54:38,815
- No.
- Come on.

603
00:54:38,891 --> 00:54:42,622
- For a good-bye dinner? No.
- The next time we meet, we buy.

604
00:54:44,897 --> 00:54:48,389
In the meantime,
you've got to save your money.

605
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,561
'Cause that's the way you make it. That's
the way you hold on to it. Just like that.

606
00:54:52,638 --> 00:54:55,198
- And that's money.
- That's true.

607
00:54:55,274 --> 00:54:58,505
When l got out of the joint,
they paid me $291...

608
00:54:58,577 --> 00:55:01,808
and l kept $10 for myself and l put
every goddamn penny in the bank.

609
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,575
- Just don't get upset.
- I知 not upset.

610
00:55:03,649 --> 00:55:06,516
- You gotta watch out for your digestion.
- I知 not upset.

611
00:55:06,585 --> 00:55:11,147
Anyway, Frenchy and l are only too happy
to pay for a nice good-bye dinner.

612
00:55:11,223 --> 00:55:12,747
Right, Frenchy?

613
00:55:14,193 --> 00:55:16,058
We got that now, okay?

614
00:55:17,162 --> 00:55:20,461
- Are you ever coming back?
- Yeah, we're coming back.

615
00:55:21,867 --> 00:55:24,768
Someday. Jesus Christ.

616
00:55:32,177 --> 00:55:35,476
High school graduation
has its prom here every year.

617
00:55:37,182 --> 00:55:40,549
They even have <i>Pomp and Circumstances</i>
on the jukebox.

618
00:55:46,325 --> 00:55:48,190
That's real good, hon.

619
00:55:48,661 --> 00:55:51,721
You just keep feeding
that information in here.

620
00:55:53,265 --> 00:55:55,495
Did you get your lie detector?

621
00:55:58,537 --> 00:56:01,506
Max? Your lie detector, have you got it?

622
00:56:03,542 --> 00:56:07,444
Got your milk of magnesia, right?
Gonna need it.

623
00:56:09,114 --> 00:56:11,241
What are you laughing about?

624
00:56:11,317 --> 00:56:14,411
- What the hell are you laughing about?
- Nothing.

625
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,912
Max sleeps with his shoe under his pillow.

626
00:56:22,428 --> 00:56:25,591
- I said never mind.
- I want to ask you something.

627
00:56:25,698 --> 00:56:29,998
What's it feel like down there?
I mean, is it sort of a tightening...

628
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:32,936
Just drop it, will you?
Because l know what you're doing.

629
00:56:33,005 --> 00:56:35,030
- And l have my plans.
- Right.

630
00:56:35,107 --> 00:56:38,804
He's got his plans.
For every car, there's dirt.

631
00:56:39,378 --> 00:56:44,111
Right. We have cars in Denver.
We really do, and we have dirt, too.

632
00:56:44,216 --> 00:56:46,878
That's right. Sort of a stopped-up feeling?

633
00:56:46,952 --> 00:56:48,817
- Come on.
- Bound up?

634
00:56:50,689 --> 00:56:53,817
- A knocked-up feeling?
- We're gonna dance, okay?

635
00:56:55,794 --> 00:56:58,456
- Want to dance?
- Let's do it.

636
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:11,241
Where have you been?
I was trying to call you.

637
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:13,104
I致e been working.

638
00:57:13,178 --> 00:57:15,874
Working, my ass.
I致e been calling all hours of the night.

639
00:57:15,948 --> 00:57:18,348
- Motor mouth, you talking to this lady?
- Right.

640
00:57:18,417 --> 00:57:20,749
You better get that thing fixed.

641
00:57:27,426 --> 00:57:28,688
Let go.

642
00:57:46,945 --> 00:57:48,913
What the hell you doing?

643
00:58:05,063 --> 00:58:07,896
Guess you know about
everybody around here, don't you?

644
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:10,467
Not the way l know you.

645
00:58:28,921 --> 00:58:30,946
You wanna loan me
plane fare to Pittsburgh?

646
00:58:31,023 --> 00:58:32,081
Sure.

647
00:58:32,157 --> 00:58:34,125
I知 gonna fly out tomorrow to Pittsburgh.

648
00:58:34,193 --> 00:58:36,923
You go to Detroit
and give the goddamn lamp to your kid.

649
00:58:36,995 --> 00:58:39,759
By the time you get back,
I知 gonna have things rolling.

650
00:58:39,832 --> 00:58:41,800
I知 gonna have them rolling, boy.

651
00:58:41,867 --> 00:58:43,960
Drinks on the house for everybody!

652
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:53,438
We'll wash any car.
You name it, we'll wash it.

653
00:58:56,448 --> 00:58:58,507
Max, we're finished. Look.

654
00:59:03,822 --> 00:59:07,053
There's gonna be ladies' night...

655
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:10,094
every Monday night of the week.

656
00:59:13,265 --> 00:59:15,028
And we will have...

657
00:59:19,037 --> 00:59:21,267
- Free balloons.
- Free balloons!

658
00:59:22,975 --> 00:59:24,772
And we will have...

659
00:59:25,077 --> 00:59:26,977
- Lollipops.
- Lollipops!

660
00:59:28,714 --> 00:59:31,410
And free Alka-Seltzer for the grandpas.

661
00:59:33,018 --> 00:59:35,885
And a loaf of bread and a head of lettuce!

662
01:01:56,294 --> 01:01:57,318
You bastard!

663
01:01:57,396 --> 01:01:58,693
Get him!

664
01:02:18,216 --> 01:02:19,444
God damn it!

665
01:02:59,958 --> 01:03:01,585
You three in here.

666
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:23,270
Jesus Christ.

667
01:03:24,883 --> 01:03:28,683
Man, l was out and home free
after six years...

668
01:03:28,754 --> 01:03:33,020
and l listen to you one goddamn time,
I知 right back in again.

669
01:03:34,259 --> 01:03:37,524
I want to tell you something.
I don't want to see you...

670
01:03:37,596 --> 01:03:40,429
l don't want to hear you
for a whole month.

671
01:03:43,201 --> 01:03:46,193
Max, you were the guy
who punched him, not me.

672
01:03:48,273 --> 01:03:49,797
Can l help you?

673
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:56,544
You take a bunk
on the other side of the dormitory.

674
01:04:03,088 --> 01:04:06,023
Come on, Max.
We're going to be here a month.

675
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:16,767
Why don't you think of it this way?

676
01:04:16,835 --> 01:04:20,236
Max, we're shipmates,
and we're on a cruise together.

677
01:04:30,415 --> 01:04:34,078
Come on. It ain't so bad.
Max, really, it isn't.

678
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,424
It was all just a joke.

679
01:04:41,827 --> 01:04:43,988
I hope I知 not interrupting.

680
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:49,499
Maybe l can be of some help.
Riley's the name. Jack Riley.

681
01:04:50,702 --> 01:04:52,567
- I知 Francis.
- Francis.

682
01:04:54,072 --> 01:04:58,372
- And Max.
- We all get along pretty good in here.

683
01:04:58,443 --> 01:05:01,344
I guess you just got to know
who your friends are.

684
01:05:01,413 --> 01:05:03,074
Buzz off, friend.

685
01:05:06,084 --> 01:05:09,884
- Unpleasantness?
- He's just a little upset. Don't get mad.

686
01:05:10,755 --> 01:05:14,088
I知 not mad. I just thought
l could be of some help.

687
01:05:14,259 --> 01:05:15,385
Good.

688
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:19,391
You're open. I like that.
I think we're going to get along all right.

689
01:05:19,464 --> 01:05:21,398
Did you hear that, Max?

690
01:05:23,301 --> 01:05:26,293
Listen, l don't want to talk.
I want to be left alone.

691
01:05:26,371 --> 01:05:28,362
Now both of you, beat it.

692
01:05:34,846 --> 01:05:38,475
Friend, l don't think you understand.
I知 kind of the trustee of this unit.

693
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:40,745
I make up the work assignments.

694
01:05:40,819 --> 01:05:44,277
Take your work assignments
and stick them up your ass.

695
01:05:44,356 --> 01:05:48,588
With that attitude, you could end up
on the hog farm up to your ass in pig shit.

696
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:51,220
He'll be all right. He's just upset.

697
01:05:52,464 --> 01:05:55,524
Max always takes a nap when he's upset.

698
01:05:56,635 --> 01:05:59,331
Look, why don't we go find
this friend of mine, Mickey?

699
01:05:59,404 --> 01:06:02,237
I値l see if l can get you set up. Come on.

700
01:06:04,442 --> 01:06:06,307
- Max?
- You don't have to worry about him.

701
01:06:06,378 --> 01:06:09,313
I値l take care of you. Don't worry. Come on.

702
01:06:10,982 --> 01:06:13,780
- Max?
- Walk away.

703
01:06:22,994 --> 01:06:25,258
Okay. You want it that way...

704
01:06:27,465 --> 01:06:29,262
I知 going to go then.

705
01:06:56,628 --> 01:06:58,926
Francis, you light this for me?

706
01:06:59,764 --> 01:07:01,629
I値l give you a match.

707
01:07:03,134 --> 01:07:05,830
See all that dough l collected
back at the cannery?

708
01:07:05,904 --> 01:07:06,962
Yeah.

709
01:07:07,038 --> 01:07:10,906
Car lottery. You want in? I run it.

710
01:07:12,444 --> 01:07:14,969
I would, but l don't have any money.

711
01:07:16,514 --> 01:07:20,177
I thought you guys were opening up
some sort of a business.

712
01:07:21,586 --> 01:07:24,214
We are, but the money's in Pittsburgh.

713
01:07:24,522 --> 01:07:26,513
- Here you go.
- Pittsburgh?

714
01:07:27,392 --> 01:07:30,156
That's where we were headed
when we were picked up.

715
01:07:30,228 --> 01:07:31,525
Want one?

716
01:07:33,431 --> 01:07:35,592
- You want one?
- Okay.

717
01:07:36,668 --> 01:07:38,067
Pittsburgh.

718
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:44,265
He's probably going to be
over at the dairy.

719
01:07:44,409 --> 01:07:46,934
What's he doing there, milking cows?

720
01:07:47,045 --> 01:07:48,569
- Mickey?
- Yeah.

721
01:07:48,646 --> 01:07:50,841
He's the warden's son-in-law.

722
01:07:59,991 --> 01:08:01,652
Come on, Francis.

723
01:08:06,431 --> 01:08:10,094
Been looking for you.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

724
01:08:10,635 --> 01:08:13,069
How come you been looking for me?

725
01:08:14,172 --> 01:08:17,733
Business, what else?
Mickey Greenwood, Francis Delbucci.

726
01:08:18,076 --> 01:08:20,135
Hi. Nice to know you.

727
01:08:20,545 --> 01:08:23,673
Francis, l have to talk to Mickey
for a minute, all right?

728
01:08:27,886 --> 01:08:29,012
Look.

729
01:08:29,687 --> 01:08:33,179
Item 1: I got a fish up on number four
I壇 like to see on the hog farm.

730
01:08:33,258 --> 01:08:34,885
Is that possible?

731
01:08:36,961 --> 01:08:38,326
All right.

732
01:08:40,532 --> 01:08:43,524
Item 2: The lottery's all in. Here's yours.

733
01:08:45,804 --> 01:08:48,932
So how's Nancy? Give her my message?

734
01:08:49,874 --> 01:08:53,537
- Yeah. Sure.
- Give you a good ball?

735
01:08:54,846 --> 01:08:56,370
Yeah, she's...

736
01:08:56,514 --> 01:08:59,244
Right. You're getting
a little tired of her style.

737
01:08:59,317 --> 01:09:02,411
You want to be balling
something strange, right?

738
01:09:02,821 --> 01:09:04,880
But I値l give you a message...

739
01:09:04,956 --> 01:09:08,255
you take it into Denver,
she'll fix it all up for you. Okay?

740
01:09:08,526 --> 01:09:10,756
Meanwhile, can you do something
for my friend?

741
01:09:10,829 --> 01:09:12,387
Something easy?

742
01:09:15,467 --> 01:09:17,662
I don't know. What's he want?

743
01:09:19,037 --> 01:09:21,505
Francis, what kind of business
are you going into?

744
01:09:21,573 --> 01:09:22,870
Car wash.

745
01:09:33,618 --> 01:09:35,950
- Want me to wash that tire?
- No.

746
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:57,599
I didn't know we'd get into gambling.
I thought you were just...

747
01:09:57,675 --> 01:09:59,666
Shut up. You'll bring the heat down on me.

748
01:09:59,744 --> 01:10:01,177
I could get the maximum.

749
01:10:01,246 --> 01:10:04,977
You could also go out on the hog farm
instead of sitting on your ass all day.

750
01:10:05,049 --> 01:10:07,677
Show coordinator is a pretty easy job.

751
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:09,445
Okay.

752
01:10:11,356 --> 01:10:13,483
Where's the baseball scores?

753
01:10:16,194 --> 01:10:19,322
- Why don't you finish your dinner?
- Yeah. I値l be right back.

754
01:10:26,938 --> 01:10:28,269
Hi, buddy.

755
01:10:31,576 --> 01:10:34,477
Max, l didn't ask for that job. Believe me.

756
01:10:34,812 --> 01:10:37,280
I wouldn't wash cars without you.

757
01:10:42,587 --> 01:10:44,077
Want a cigar?

758
01:10:44,455 --> 01:10:46,923
I got one for you. Go ahead.

759
01:10:49,794 --> 01:10:53,525
You look tired, you know that, buddy?
They working you hard?

760
01:11:02,373 --> 01:11:03,840
I値l be back.

761
01:11:08,246 --> 01:11:09,736
Keeping warm?

762
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:21,253
You know something?

763
01:11:21,659 --> 01:11:26,323
I think you're going to be real sorry
when you find out l didn't do anything.

764
01:11:26,864 --> 01:11:29,332
- That it wasn't my fault.
- Francis!

765
01:11:31,369 --> 01:11:32,768
Real sorry.

766
01:11:35,974 --> 01:11:38,101
Go ahead. Have a good lunch.

767
01:11:40,778 --> 01:11:43,110
If l don't see you again, hello.

768
01:11:49,587 --> 01:11:51,111
You know, l...

769
01:11:52,357 --> 01:11:55,224
- I致e been thinking about something.
- Yeah.

770
01:11:56,261 --> 01:11:59,492
I think you'd make a good
assistant director for my talent show.

771
01:11:59,564 --> 01:12:00,758
What do you say?

772
01:12:00,832 --> 01:12:03,062
It's better than washing cars.

773
01:12:04,102 --> 01:12:06,366
- A talent show?
- A talent show.

774
01:12:06,938 --> 01:12:08,565
What would l do?

775
01:12:08,873 --> 01:12:13,572
You'd kind of help get the guys together,
you know, you'd rehearse the show.

776
01:12:14,379 --> 01:12:17,678
I need a little extra time
to take care of business.

777
01:12:20,051 --> 01:12:22,815
- It's easy.
- Okay.

778
01:12:28,059 --> 01:12:31,495
There's the hog farm. There's Max.

779
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:34,828
Can we pull over, do you think?

780
01:12:35,133 --> 01:12:37,567
Mickey, let's go over to Pigville.

781
01:12:41,339 --> 01:12:44,069
Hey, there, fella, can you
wrap me two pounds to go?

782
01:12:44,342 --> 01:12:47,607
I don't have too much time. Guess what?

783
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:53,139
I知 the director of the talent show.
Want me to make you a star?

784
01:12:54,085 --> 01:12:55,882
Your name in lights?

785
01:12:57,055 --> 01:12:59,956
You can bring your friends along
if you want.

786
01:13:01,225 --> 01:13:03,090
Let's get out of here.

787
01:13:03,328 --> 01:13:06,820
Us show people sure do envy
you simple men of the land.

788
01:13:10,802 --> 01:13:12,463
Have a nice life.

789
01:13:44,068 --> 01:13:45,194
Shit.

790
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:49,204
So he stands up there, right,
and he says, "No more jokes.

791
01:13:49,273 --> 01:13:52,106
"No more jokes until the end of the show."

792
01:13:58,549 --> 01:14:00,016
I got to pee.

793
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:06,318
- Your friend Max is out there.
- Max is going to be mad at me, too...

794
01:14:07,058 --> 01:14:09,720
because I知 getting drunk and he's not.

795
01:14:11,162 --> 01:14:13,653
You're a friend of mine. Max isn't.

796
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:17,794
Max is out there with all his friends.

797
01:14:21,506 --> 01:14:22,905
You said it!

798
01:14:23,808 --> 01:14:26,436
And you're in here having a good time.

799
01:14:27,044 --> 01:14:29,877
I told you it pays to be
a friend of Jack Riley's.

800
01:14:31,616 --> 01:14:35,108
- It sure does, Jack.
- Francis?

801
01:14:38,556 --> 01:14:40,956
You know how much time I知 doing?

802
01:14:41,993 --> 01:14:43,654
Goodness gracious.

803
01:14:43,728 --> 01:14:47,926
Just put these together...
Just put it on the hand.

804
01:14:48,266 --> 01:14:52,760
- You know how much time I知 doing?
- No. How much time are you doing?

805
01:14:54,939 --> 01:14:56,304
Eighteen months.

806
01:14:59,677 --> 01:15:01,736
- That's a long time.
- Yeah.

807
01:15:03,815 --> 01:15:08,115
- That's a long time.
- That's a lot of Sundays, I値l tell you that.

808
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:15,448
How about it?

809
01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:23,389
How about it?

810
01:15:24,802 --> 01:15:26,292
How about it?

811
01:15:28,172 --> 01:15:29,730
How about what?

812
01:15:30,074 --> 01:15:33,510
Yeah, how about it?
How about, you know...

813
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,714
giving old Riley a little relief?

814
01:15:43,654 --> 01:15:45,315
What do you mean?

815
01:15:46,357 --> 01:15:47,984
Relief for what?

816
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:50,852
What do you say?

817
01:15:57,535 --> 01:15:59,662
I don't know what you want.

818
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:12,840
Igor, you crazy monster.

819
01:16:13,718 --> 01:16:17,051
- Get out. Go back.
- Don't make fun of me.

820
01:16:18,289 --> 01:16:21,315
I知 not making fun of you.
What are you doing?

821
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:25,525
I知 kind of sensitive.
I値l show you what I知 doing.

822
01:16:27,565 --> 01:16:29,362
- Riley.
- What?

823
01:16:29,433 --> 01:16:30,661
Come on.

824
01:16:53,257 --> 01:16:56,158
- Just a little.
- I値l bite it off, you fuck.

825
01:17:04,101 --> 01:17:07,537
Riley, l didn't mean to hurt you.

826
01:17:08,706 --> 01:17:10,833
What's the matter with you?

827
01:17:21,052 --> 01:17:24,544
Mama's boy likes to play, but doesn't pay.

828
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:34,358
Stop it!

829
01:18:20,678 --> 01:18:22,168
Just cool it.

830
01:18:28,619 --> 01:18:31,986
Jesus Christ. Who did...

831
01:18:32,857 --> 01:18:34,950
Jesus Christ, man.

832
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,385
Riley tried to fuck me...

833
01:18:38,763 --> 01:18:41,823
so l had to kick the shit
out of him, you know?

834
01:18:42,433 --> 01:18:43,866
Jesus Christ.

835
01:18:52,443 --> 01:18:55,571
Got to keep the weight
on the balls of your feet.

836
01:18:56,013 --> 01:19:00,177
Otherwise, you slip down on your heels,
and you skid right into the pig shit.

837
01:19:04,055 --> 01:19:08,355
- On the balls?
- Yeah. Right on the balls.

838
01:19:11,896 --> 01:19:15,855
If you'd been out here in the first place,
you would have known all that.

839
01:19:16,567 --> 01:19:18,159
I had my laughs.

840
01:19:19,336 --> 01:19:22,237
- What did you say?
- I had my laughs.

841
01:19:22,473 --> 01:19:23,599
Yeah.

842
01:19:27,044 --> 01:19:29,342
I know somebody's not laughing.

843
01:19:32,383 --> 01:19:34,476
He wanted to be in show business.

844
01:19:34,685 --> 01:19:36,209
Show business.

845
01:19:38,255 --> 01:19:39,620
Come here.

846
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:44,855
Something l don't understand, you know?

847
01:19:44,929 --> 01:19:46,920
I just want to ask you...

848
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:50,997
how you people in show business...

849
01:19:51,068 --> 01:19:54,629
manage to stay in action
when you give it away like that?

850
01:19:56,707 --> 01:20:01,110
- What did l give away?
- You know, the whole business.

851
01:20:02,513 --> 01:20:04,504
The whole show business.

852
01:20:06,684 --> 01:20:09,585
You gave it to my partner Lion, didn't you?

853
01:20:11,689 --> 01:20:14,658
Didn't you, Riley?
Didn't you give it to him?

854
01:20:18,829 --> 01:20:20,854
Why don't you go fuck off?

855
01:21:24,094 --> 01:21:25,356
See that?

856
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:28,220
I saved that.

857
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,370
I was thinking about Detroit.

858
01:21:40,044 --> 01:21:43,207
Let's skip it. It don't feel good.

859
01:21:48,385 --> 01:21:51,786
- What do l do with my lamp?
- You mail it.

860
01:21:57,094 --> 01:21:58,789
It's not the lamp.

861
01:22:01,298 --> 01:22:02,925
It's Annie, Max.

862
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:06,829
That's why l got to go back. I owe Annie.

863
01:22:14,111 --> 01:22:18,172
Do me one favor, though,
let's make it fast.

864
01:22:21,218 --> 01:22:23,880
Stay on here till we get to St. Louis.

865
01:22:24,722 --> 01:22:29,421
Then we'll get off and catch
something else to get up to Detroit.

866
01:22:35,633 --> 01:22:37,294
I could use a drink.

867
01:22:38,235 --> 01:22:42,228
Eye to eye with me, the guy tells me
what freight train to catch.

868
01:22:42,606 --> 01:22:44,164
I値l be damned.

869
01:22:44,241 --> 01:22:46,937
That's because you look ridiculous.

870
01:22:47,011 --> 01:22:49,138
See, he saw the humor in it.

871
01:22:49,647 --> 01:22:51,774
- I see.
- Humor.

872
01:22:52,182 --> 01:22:53,376
Humor.

873
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:57,587
You know something, Max?

874
01:22:57,955 --> 01:23:00,617
You used to look scary and ridiculous.

875
01:23:01,058 --> 01:23:03,253
Now you just look ridiculous.

876
01:23:05,663 --> 01:23:08,962
Really? It's because
I知 becoming a scarecrow, right?

877
01:23:09,366 --> 01:23:12,631
That's right. You're a scarecrow.

878
01:23:12,703 --> 01:23:15,501
- I知 a scarecrow.
- You're also an asshole.

879
01:23:16,807 --> 01:23:20,573
- You're also a scarecrow, too.
- Okay. But unlike you, huh?

880
01:23:21,512 --> 01:23:24,845
I知 a scarecrow. That's right. You're right.

881
01:23:24,915 --> 01:23:28,282
Listen. Have you taken a good look
at your mug lately?

882
01:23:28,352 --> 01:23:30,217
Have you eyeballed it?

883
01:23:30,287 --> 01:23:33,484
If that's what being a scarecrow is,
l don't want any part of that.

884
01:23:33,557 --> 01:23:35,548
Scarecrows are beautiful.

885
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,225
Scarecrows are beautiful!

886
01:23:38,295 --> 01:23:39,626
Hey, miss.

887
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:43,832
Can we have some coffee down here
for Mr. Scarecrow?

888
01:23:45,102 --> 01:23:47,127
Scarecrows are beautiful!

889
01:23:47,905 --> 01:23:50,533
I知 feeling good. I really feel good.

890
01:23:51,275 --> 01:23:55,609
That's because you're learning, you know?
You're learning how to laugh.

891
01:23:56,347 --> 01:23:58,577
And guess what? I taught you.

892
01:23:59,783 --> 01:24:03,344
- I知 your... What do you call it?
- You're my taughter.

893
01:24:03,854 --> 01:24:05,446
- Taughter.
- Right?

894
01:24:07,391 --> 01:24:11,088
You're my teacher, buddy,
and I知 telling you it's really comforting.

895
01:24:11,161 --> 01:24:13,493
Will you fuck off? Jesus Christ.

896
01:24:14,264 --> 01:24:16,357
What's the matter with you?

897
01:24:16,467 --> 01:24:19,334
I thought you were a scarecrow.
What are you doing?

898
01:24:19,803 --> 01:24:21,794
Didn't you learn anything?

899
01:24:23,173 --> 01:24:26,506
- You show me how to handle a drunk then.
- Okay, I値l show you.

900
01:24:31,515 --> 01:24:32,641
Here.

901
01:24:44,661 --> 01:24:45,719
No.

902
01:24:47,698 --> 01:24:50,565
- You're losing him.
- I知 not losing him.

903
01:24:50,634 --> 01:24:52,101
Look at him.

904
01:24:53,570 --> 01:24:56,266
- You're losing him.
- I知 not losing him.

905
01:24:58,642 --> 01:25:01,236
That's my uncle you're making fun of.

906
01:25:03,247 --> 01:25:06,683
This is my wife here.
We were just having...

907
01:25:09,853 --> 01:25:11,616
Okay, down.

908
01:25:13,257 --> 01:25:16,055
- Okay, all right.
- No, Max.

909
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:18,624
Just one way. Get out of here.

910
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:25,267
- You okay?
- I知 okay.

911
01:25:25,335 --> 01:25:26,529
That's it.

912
01:25:26,603 --> 01:25:29,834
- No, no...
- That's it. Go ahead. Have a time.

913
01:25:29,907 --> 01:25:33,070
- But l...
- Go on. Have a time.

914
01:25:34,278 --> 01:25:36,007
- Have fun.
- Come on.

915
01:25:40,584 --> 01:25:41,949
Come here!

916
01:25:52,062 --> 01:25:55,463
Hello, Lion? Max wants to talk to you.

917
01:25:57,601 --> 01:26:00,092
Look at this. I知 an old scarecrow.

918
01:26:00,604 --> 01:26:03,437
Come on. Come on back here.

919
01:26:14,685 --> 01:26:16,915
- How about that?
- I知 going to help.

920
01:26:16,987 --> 01:26:20,445
Shake hands. He don't want to fight.

921
01:26:22,192 --> 01:26:24,786
Watch it, God damn it. Watch out.

922
01:26:27,264 --> 01:26:29,027
You okay, old-timer?

923
01:26:36,907 --> 01:26:38,568
Hold that for me.

924
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:48,950
Come on! Take it off! Bravo!

925
01:26:49,353 --> 01:26:50,752
Take it off!

926
01:27:14,945 --> 01:27:17,743
- He's something else.
- Bring on the girls!

927
01:28:38,562 --> 01:28:40,792
I had them laughing, didn't l?

928
01:28:41,632 --> 01:28:43,623
You're going places, Max.

929
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:52,533
You know what we're going to have
out in front of our car wash?

930
01:28:52,609 --> 01:28:57,012
- No. What?
- A scarecrow. That's what.

931
01:29:06,056 --> 01:29:07,717
Good night, world!

932
01:29:13,664 --> 01:29:15,325
Good night, world!

933
01:29:15,866 --> 01:29:17,527
You motherfuckers!

934
01:30:52,329 --> 01:30:56,026
I知 glad you wore your sweater,
'cause it's cold, you know.

935
01:30:57,934 --> 01:31:00,732
- Where's your house?
- It's right in there.

936
01:31:09,346 --> 01:31:10,711
Is that it?

937
01:31:15,152 --> 01:31:16,414
Go ahead.

938
01:31:21,691 --> 01:31:24,023
No, l think l should call first.

939
01:31:25,562 --> 01:31:28,190
- It don't feel right.
- All right, call.

940
01:31:29,766 --> 01:31:30,858
There's a phone over there.

941
01:31:34,471 --> 01:31:35,995
Just call them.

942
01:31:36,406 --> 01:31:38,203
Here, man, hold this.

943
01:31:51,188 --> 01:31:54,715
Just remember, all right,
that you're a person.

944
01:31:54,791 --> 01:31:56,725
You're a person, right?

945
01:31:56,793 --> 01:32:00,092
And you were a kid before,
and you've made mistakes...

946
01:32:00,163 --> 01:32:02,131
so you ran. That's all.

947
01:32:06,236 --> 01:32:08,534
- You sent a lot of money, right?
- Right.

948
01:32:08,605 --> 01:32:10,937
And you thought
that was going to make it okay?

949
01:32:11,007 --> 01:32:13,441
- But that doesn't make it, does it?
- No.

950
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:16,775
Okay. Now you're a man,
and now you're gonna straighten it all out.

951
01:32:16,847 --> 01:32:18,872
Max, let me make the call.

952
01:32:19,483 --> 01:32:21,610
Gonna straighten it all out.

953
01:32:50,247 --> 01:32:51,373
Mama.

954
01:32:57,687 --> 01:32:59,484
Joey the Banana King.

955
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:03,386
Joey the Banana King. What do you want?

956
01:33:11,501 --> 01:33:12,763
Francis.

957
01:33:20,777 --> 01:33:22,301
Where are you?

958
01:33:27,651 --> 01:33:28,709
Why?

959
01:33:37,861 --> 01:33:38,987
Talk?

960
01:33:41,464 --> 01:33:43,523
What are you... Are you staying?

961
01:33:46,736 --> 01:33:47,725
No.

962
01:33:51,341 --> 01:33:55,243
What's this, Joey the Banana King?

963
01:33:55,545 --> 01:33:57,342
Is that Joey Gleason?

964
01:33:57,547 --> 01:33:59,538
Yeah. I知 married to him.

965
01:34:04,654 --> 01:34:06,645
Did you hear me, Francis?

966
01:34:07,023 --> 01:34:09,548
Yeah. Joey Gleason.

967
01:34:13,096 --> 01:34:17,760
God. So then you're okay.
You're married, and you're all right.

968
01:34:21,471 --> 01:34:23,871
So what are you now, Mrs. Banana King?

969
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:26,909
Do you think that's funny,
you son of a bitch?

970
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,913
How long... When did you marry him?

971
01:34:35,185 --> 01:34:37,050
A couple of years ago.

972
01:34:40,323 --> 01:34:43,224
Thanks for the money, you bastard.

973
01:34:43,293 --> 01:34:46,353
We used your allotments
to set up his business.

974
01:34:52,636 --> 01:34:54,103
What, you...

975
01:34:56,339 --> 01:34:58,068
You didn't hear me?

976
01:35:06,349 --> 01:35:08,476
Yeah, l got it. I told you l got it.

977
01:35:08,551 --> 01:35:11,748
Thanks for a big fat nothing. You just left.

978
01:35:15,558 --> 01:35:17,492
Happy? Sure.

979
01:35:18,495 --> 01:35:22,226
Sure I知 happy.
I知 Mrs. Joey Banana King...

980
01:35:22,298 --> 01:35:24,459
and l look like an old lady.

981
01:35:25,268 --> 01:35:27,133
You left. You just...

982
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:31,270
You stinking shit. You coward.

983
01:35:33,943 --> 01:35:38,346
Sure, send the money and see the world.
Leave Annie here.

984
01:35:39,382 --> 01:35:43,944
Leave me here in this goddamn
stinking slum, you bastard, you!

985
01:35:44,454 --> 01:35:47,355
Please, Annie. Look...

986
01:35:49,859 --> 01:35:52,487
Annie, please. Look, let me come over.

987
01:35:52,762 --> 01:35:54,730
I don't want to see you!

988
01:35:55,532 --> 01:35:59,798
You just get away.
You just stay away, and get out.

989
01:36:02,505 --> 01:36:03,767
Oh, God.

990
01:36:28,498 --> 01:36:31,126
You didn't ask about the kid, Francis.

991
01:36:31,868 --> 01:36:33,426
I was going to.

992
01:36:36,306 --> 01:36:38,604
So what is it, a boy or a girl?

993
01:36:43,913 --> 01:36:45,073
Dead.

994
01:36:47,951 --> 01:36:49,316
It's dead.

995
01:36:55,158 --> 01:36:58,685
Never even got born, Francis,
'cause l was left alone.

996
01:37:01,931 --> 01:37:03,922
Did you hear me, Francis?

997
01:37:04,901 --> 01:37:07,062
Eight months. You know...

998
01:37:08,905 --> 01:37:12,898
l slipped on the front steps in the snow.
I fell down them.

999
01:37:12,976 --> 01:37:15,410
There was no one there to help me.

1000
01:37:16,613 --> 01:37:19,207
You know what l mean? I lost the kid.

1001
01:37:24,487 --> 01:37:26,512
It would have been a boy.

1002
01:37:31,327 --> 01:37:33,090
Never even got born.

1003
01:37:35,064 --> 01:37:38,090
Never got baptized.
You know what that means.

1004
01:37:38,735 --> 01:37:40,999
That soul cannot go to heaven.

1005
01:37:41,905 --> 01:37:44,999
That's what you did for your son's soul,
you bastard.

1006
01:37:45,074 --> 01:37:49,010
You sent it into limbo.
That soul cannot go to heaven.

1007
01:38:33,056 --> 01:38:35,047
- What is it?
- It's a boy!

1008
01:38:39,429 --> 01:38:40,896
That's great.

1009
01:38:45,869 --> 01:38:47,666
And what about Annie?

1010
01:38:47,737 --> 01:38:49,864
Annie got married. She's got a husband.

1011
01:38:49,939 --> 01:38:52,601
I don't feel l should go over there,
with the kid.

1012
01:38:52,675 --> 01:38:55,644
- I値l mess things up.
- All right, good. That's great.

1013
01:38:56,045 --> 01:38:57,910
You're my best friend.

1014
01:38:59,482 --> 01:39:01,313
- It's all over now, right?
- All over.

1015
01:39:01,384 --> 01:39:02,715
Okay, you're a man now.

1016
01:39:02,785 --> 01:39:04,980
- God damn it, you're a man.
- Let's celebrate.

1017
01:39:05,054 --> 01:39:07,488
All right, we'll celebrate.
We'll make it fast.

1018
01:39:07,557 --> 01:39:10,025
I know a place across the river
called Bell Island.

1019
01:39:10,093 --> 01:39:13,620
Me and Annie used to go there.
We're gonna make it fast.

1020
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:24,636
Okay, come on!
Going to read your fortunes. Hands out.

1021
01:39:24,707 --> 01:39:28,040
Who's first? Who's second?
Who's third? Who's fourth?

1022
01:39:28,111 --> 01:39:29,703
Okay, first you.

1023
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:37,577
See what this thing says?
You're going to open a button factory.

1024
01:39:37,687 --> 01:39:40,178
And then you'll go crazy
and eat all the buttons.

1025
01:39:40,256 --> 01:39:43,487
But that'll be okay
because you won't have to buy any food...

1026
01:39:43,559 --> 01:39:45,254
'cause you're full with buttons.

1027
01:39:45,328 --> 01:39:47,193
He'll be a button man.

1028
01:39:47,263 --> 01:39:50,061
I know what to do
to keep your hands warm.

1029
01:39:51,167 --> 01:39:54,330
- Stick them up.
- Give me a button.

1030
01:39:54,837 --> 01:39:57,135
I知 the button man, all right.

1031
01:39:58,875 --> 01:40:02,242
Stick up your hands. Come here.

1032
01:40:02,312 --> 01:40:04,337
Put a peanut up your nose.

1033
01:40:07,450 --> 01:40:10,851
After you find the missing treasure...

1034
01:40:12,422 --> 01:40:14,083
you're going to...

1035
01:40:15,959 --> 01:40:17,756
sprout wings and fly.

1036
01:40:18,161 --> 01:40:19,526
Read my palm.

1037
01:40:19,595 --> 01:40:21,358
Want to see <i>Treasure Island?</i>

1038
01:40:21,431 --> 01:40:23,865

1039
01:40:23,933 --> 01:40:27,835
Come over here. We'll do a bit together.

1043
01:40:37,246 --> 01:40:40,704
Aye, aye. Aye, matey.

1044
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:45,984
The wind looks a bit
to ruffle our sails, aye?

1045
01:40:48,057 --> 01:40:49,456
I don't want to do that.

1046
01:40:49,525 --> 01:40:51,618
Whatever you do, Jim boy...

1047
01:40:52,061 --> 01:40:54,928

1048
01:40:58,334 --> 01:41:01,963

I知 gonna cut me some young lads.

1050
01:41:09,312 --> 01:41:11,041
Where's me cutlass?

1051
01:41:11,781 --> 01:41:13,874
Where be me cutlass?

1052

Right here.

1053
01:41:15,918 --> 01:41:18,079
Where be me cutlass?

1054
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:32,390
He's in there.

1055
01:41:37,273 --> 01:41:39,138
Got to love Long John.

1056
01:41:40,176 --> 01:41:42,576
- How about Long John?
- You're Long John?

1057
01:41:42,645 --> 01:41:45,944
Got to love Long John.

1058
01:41:50,053 --> 01:41:51,077
No!

1059
01:42:05,768 --> 01:42:08,066
Let him go! Quit it!

1060
01:42:08,438 --> 01:42:11,032
My God! What are you doing?

1061
01:42:14,944 --> 01:42:16,741
What the hell you...

1062
01:42:22,318 --> 01:42:23,910
Give me the boy.

1063
01:42:25,455 --> 01:42:26,479
No!

1064
01:42:39,769 --> 01:42:41,634
Got to love Long John!

1065
01:42:43,272 --> 01:42:44,899
Get out of there!

1066
01:42:52,014 --> 01:42:54,608
Come on. Get off there!

1067
01:43:15,304 --> 01:43:16,566
Come on!

1068
01:43:34,824 --> 01:43:36,155
All right.

1069
01:43:54,977 --> 01:43:56,945
I知 going to fight them!

1070
01:44:02,485 --> 01:44:06,751
What are you doing?
What the hell's the matter with you?

1071
01:44:11,494 --> 01:44:12,688
Get some help!

1072
01:44:36,285 --> 01:44:39,083
- What's wrong with him?
- Your friend has serious trouble.

1073
01:44:39,155 --> 01:44:41,453
- Yeah, what...
- He's catatonic.

1074
01:44:42,758 --> 01:44:45,750
- How'd he catch that?
- It's nothing you catch.

1075
01:44:46,362 --> 01:44:49,058
There's an ambulance on the way
from Laguna Heights.

1076
01:44:49,131 --> 01:44:52,100
Would you tell them
that I致e got him sedated?

1077
01:44:52,268 --> 01:44:54,793
- What place is that?
- State Hospital.

1078
01:44:55,204 --> 01:44:58,173
- How long has he got to be in there now?
- There's no telling.

1079
01:44:58,241 --> 01:45:01,335
What do you mean?
Are you a doctor? Do you know or not?

1080
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:05,073
- Keep your voice down. This is a hospital.
- I know it's a hospital.

1081
01:45:10,553 --> 01:45:15,081
I知 going to take care of him.
I got the money. In Pittsburgh.

1082
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:21,129
He's just fooling around.
He's fooling around.

1083
01:45:51,994 --> 01:45:54,588
Christ, they got you all strapped up.

1084
01:45:56,499 --> 01:45:57,966
Look at that.

1085
01:46:05,308 --> 01:46:08,800
Jesus Christ. What have they done to you?

1086
01:46:16,419 --> 01:46:20,185
Jesus. This must be me dreaming, right?

1087
01:46:24,894 --> 01:46:26,418
God damn it!

1088
01:46:26,495 --> 01:46:29,692
Look, you skinny little bastard,
will you wake up?

1089
01:46:32,134 --> 01:46:33,396
Wake up!

1090
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:37,230
Get these goddamn straps off of you.

1091
01:46:41,077 --> 01:46:43,477
Look at me. Listen.

1092
01:46:45,147 --> 01:46:48,082
No goddamn way in the world
l can open up that car wash...

1093
01:46:48,150 --> 01:46:49,879
with you locked up.

1094
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:53,217
Who am l gonna trust?

1095
01:46:55,391 --> 01:46:57,188
We're going back to the phone booth.

1096
01:46:57,259 --> 01:46:59,386
I知 gonna take you back
to that phone booth...

1097
01:46:59,462 --> 01:47:03,193
and I知 gonna find out
what she said to you. You understand?

1098
01:47:08,804 --> 01:47:11,398
You and me, we think alike, don't we?

1099
01:47:12,174 --> 01:47:14,074
