<i>All I wanted was to be invisible.</i>

2
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,357
<i>It was a simple request.</i>

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,357
<i>It didn't involve anyone else.</i>

4
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,915
<i>When I was in a room with another person,</i>

5
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,435
<i>I felt like I was only half there.</i>

6
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,953
<i>When I was in a room with two other people,</i>

7
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,311
<i>I felt like a third of myself.</i>

8
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,028
<i>When I was in a room</i>
<i>with three other people,</i>

9
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,710
<i>I felt like a quarter of myself.</i>

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,599
<i>And when I was in a whole crowd of people,</i>

11
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,712
<i>I felt like nobody.</i>

12
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,273
I hate you.

13
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,755
Please.

14
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,839
...all of those things.

15
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,598
I think <i>he's</i> hot.

16
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,439
Tiff Peedle told me he only has one nut.
<i>That's</i> disgusting.

17
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,516
Tiff <i>Peedle's</i> a pathological liar.

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,789
You never know.

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,433
<i>There's</i> only one way to find out, really.

20
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,710
You're not doing that. Stop.

21
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,592
No. No.

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,039
Hey, Connor.

23
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,157
- Hey, <i>what's</i> going on?
- Nothing.

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,796
- He blatantly likes you.
- Do you think?

25
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,797
- Blatantly wants to fuck you.
- Oh, my God.

26
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,070
Frederica Diaz told me
he was a massive fuck.

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,634
- Frederica Diaz?
- Yes. Spanish exchange student?

28
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,797
Sophomore, fall, big butt, small skirts,
homeroom 42, remember?

29
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,399
- Yes.
- Yes. Right.

30
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,755
What?

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,590
- God.
- The freaks <i>don't</i> even want her.

32
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,394
Your new sister is Z-list.

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,999
<i>She's</i> not my sister.

34
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,352
<i>It's</i> karmic law, Nina. Your house is perfect,
your <i>mom's</i> a babe, your <i>dad's</i> hot.

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,913
<i>Don't</i> be gross.

36
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,120
And you're the prettiest girl in school.

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,555
Yeah, well, <i>I'm</i> fat.

38
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,638
Well, you were bound to inherit
a retard sooner or later.

39
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,269
Dot.

40
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,955
Do you mind if I sit down with you?

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,350
I could sure use some company.

42
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,680
Come on, we've been waiting for you.
<i>Let's</i> go.

43
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,633
Fuck! <i>It's</i> ridiculous!

44
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,274
Hurry up.

45
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,118
- Where was she hiding?
- She was in the bathroom.

46
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,559
What a freak.

47
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,799
<i>Can't</i> believe my parents took her in.

48
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,319
When she arrived last week,

49
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,829
she was holding a cardboard box
with her <i>dad's</i> ashes in it.

50
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,828
I really wish you would accept Dot, Nina.
We're all in this together.

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,076
Whatever. It <i>wasn't</i> my decision.

52
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,591
- <i>She's</i> sitting right there.
- So what? She <i>can't</i> even hear.

53
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,153
She <i>can't</i> even speak.

54
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,518
<i>It's</i> like <i>she's</i> a cat, or a dog or something.

55
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,039
My mom says hi.

56
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,472
She wanted me to tell you that her sister
is looking for an interior decorator,

57
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,068
if you're interested. She lives in Wallingford.

58
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,599
Well, I will give her a call.

59
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,473
<i>I'm</i> still very busy here, though.
I <i>haven't</i> even finished the kitchen.

60
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,068
Or the living room, or the dining room.

61
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,709
Will you help me with dinner, Dot?

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,877
<i>Don't</i> touch that, please.

63
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,795
<i>I'm</i> sorry. My <i>mom's</i> a total control freak.

64
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,115
This could be the fabric for our new couch.

65
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,518
Jesus Christ, Mom, she was just touching it.
<i>It's</i> not like she has cooties or something.

66
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,310
Besides, you're letting the retarded girl
touch our food.

67
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,829
Be careful, Nina, she can read lips.

68
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,392
Your bedroom looks great, Mrs Deer.

69
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,432
I love the new curtains.
They're very dramatic.

70
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,471
When were you in my bedroom?

71
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,160
We were just getting some lipstick, Mom.

72
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,917
Mr Deer did such a nice job
with this house.

73
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,397
<i>It's</i> the nicest house in Meriden,
everyone says so.

74
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,078
Thank you, Michelle.

75
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,670
Not like that, Dot.
You're wasting too much of the bean.

76
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,917
I was watching the news.

77
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,356
Why <i>can't</i> we watch something
that actually affects us?

78
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,476
- <i>Michelle's</i> staying for dinner.
- Not tonight, Nina.

79
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,397
Why, <i>there's</i> not enough food
with the deaf girl?

80
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,751
Your <i>father's</i> had a long day.
<i>I'm</i> sure he would like a quiet night.

81
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,236
Well, then,
why <i>doesn't</i> he dine alone with Dot?

82
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,197
Paul Deer, how nice to see you again.

83
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,872
Janice Feltswater.

84
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,913
<i>I'm Nina's</i> college advisor.
Parent-teacher conference.

85
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,109
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

86
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,516
I've been meaning to touch base with you.
Or your wife.

87
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,356
<i>I'm</i> concerned.

88
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,156
- About Nina?
- About Dot.

89
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,593
- The disabled girl you've taken in?
- <i>She's</i> deaf.

90
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,517
She seems very unhappy.

91
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,071
She just lost her father.
They were very close.

92
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,158
- What about her mother?
- Cancer, when Dot was seven.

93
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,359
- Tragic.
- Yes.

94
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,948
You are so good to have taken her in.

95
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,716
You're not only a brilliant architect,
you're a good man.

96
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,273
- Thank you.
- Olivia Deer?

97
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,072
- Yes.
- Something wrong?

98
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,634
My wife had a root canal.

99
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,149
- Ouch.
- Antibiotics.

100
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,032
- Well, it was nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

101
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,593
- Good night.
- Tell your wife hello.

102
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,790
- I will. Good night.
- Good night.

103
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,758
Hello, Dot.
Did you have a good day at school?

104
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,910
She spent most of the day in the bathroom.

105
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,669
<i>She's</i> a total freak.
<i>Can't</i> you just be, like, her un-godparents?

106
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,598
You look nice today.

107
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,990
I just said that you look nice today.

108
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,759
Well, I look like shit
and I need to wash my hair.

109
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,749
<i>Mom's</i> passed out in the living room.

110

Hey, come here. Take it.

111
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,588
<i>It's</i> great.

112
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,037
It's, like, socially acceptable.
<i>It's</i> legalised heroin.

113
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,192
My mom <i>won't</i> notice.

114
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,829
Pussy.

115
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,509
Hey.

116
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,349
Paisley.

117
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,075
<i>It's</i> hard work decorating, Paul.

118
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,275
I have to rely on the French
and Italians to send me fabrics.

119
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,277
Come on. <i>Let's</i> get you to bed. Come on.

120

Up you go.

121
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,475
Up.

122
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,428
You all right?

123
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,359
Thanks, hon.

124
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,429
Stop it.

125
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,035
- What?
- Looking at me like that.

126
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,398
- Like what?
- My hip still hurts at night.

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,638
This arrived today.

128
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,115
Now the room is finally finished.

129
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,879
<i>It's</i> perfect.

130
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,875
Good.

131
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,434
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

132
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,628
About Dot.

133
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,356
I want her here, Olivia.
It was the right thing to do.

134
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,957
- I should get the girls dinner.
- <i>Don't</i> say it like that.

135
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,549
<i>Don't</i> imply, every time you say
that you are going to do something,

136
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,274
you are implying I am not the one doing it.

137
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,277
You're tired, Olivia. Get some sleep.

138
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,075
No, <i>I'm</i> self-aware!
<i>I'm</i> incredibly fucking self-aware.

139
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,117
So, you think <i>Dot's</i> going to be able
to keep up with your classes at school?

140
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,199
I <i>don't</i> know, why <i>don't</i> you ask her?
You seem to be an expert in deaf-speak.

141
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,988
You know, <i>there's</i> an American Sign
Language course at the evening extension.

142
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,033
I thought it would be fun
if we all learnt a little sign language.

143
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,071
You mean <i>she's</i> actually staying?

144
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,239
Of course <i>she's</i> staying, Nina.
She <i>doesn't</i> have anybody else.

145
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,475
She <i>doesn't</i> have any family.
<i>She's</i> not as fortunate as you.

146
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,871
It <i>wouldn't</i> hurt for you to, you know,
take some sign language courses.

147
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,389
It <i>couldn't</i> help but look good
on your college applications.

148
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,034
People like to see a little initiative.

149
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,235
Hello? Yeah. I know.

150
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,595
Yeah, well, let me call you back. Okay.

151
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,308
You make yourself at home, okay, Dot?

152
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,399
<i>I'm</i> spending the night at Michelle's.
We have to practise our new routines.

Tonight?

154
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,598
Yeah, I wanted to give you
and your new daughter some time to bond.

155
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,878
Michelle Fell with Norman Griss,

156
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,155
Nina Deer with Nelim Sathime.

157
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,159
Oh, and, Dot,

158
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,229
for this dissection
you'll be partnered with Connor Kennedy.

159
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,229
Okay?

160
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,277
All right, everybody.

161
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,317
- Hi.
- Peel back that outer layer of skin

162
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,395
and get yourself acquainted
with the general anatomical structure.

163
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,996
<i>I'm</i> calling PETA.
This is major animal cruelty right now.

164
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,758
Save it, Miss Fell.

165
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,912
Gentle, Dot, slow.

166
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,997
The pig is already dead.

167
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,278
I <i>can't</i> believe that auditory waste product
gets to lab with Connor.

168
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,516
<i>It's</i> like Piln trying to hold fate.

169
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,278
And I want to fuck him.

170
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,835
Fuck him.

171
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,030
<i>He's</i> obviously afraid of commitment.

172
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,432
So, who do you want to bang-chung
these days, Nina?

173
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,589
No one.

174
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,673
Nina, you got to get it going.
You are 17 and you're still a virgin.

175
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,879
<i>Don't</i> worry, <i>I'm</i> not going to tell anybody.

176
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,389
<i>It's</i> just if you <i>don't</i> pop this thing
before the end of the year,

177
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,875
you're going to end up
being a high-school spinster.

178
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,955
Blatantly.

179
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,550
Now, I really just <i>don't</i> get it.
You could have anybody you wanted.

180
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,319
Except Connor. Dibs on him this semester.

181
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,235
Look.

182
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,353
<i>Dot's</i> found a companion
she can speak with.

183
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,118
Maybe Myrna will adopt her, and that way
she can have two deaf daughters.

184
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,237
<i>When Beethoven was 17 years old,</i>
<i>his mother died.</i>

185
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,030
<i>In 1801, when Beethoven first discovered</i>
<i>he was losing his hearing,</i>

186
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,071
<i>he got severely depressed.</i>

187
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,350
...he actually knows who I am.
I gave him two <i>weeks'</i> notice.

188
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,789
Watch, <i>I'm</i> telling you right now...

189
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,791
- What?
- Nothing, man.

190
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,194
- I want to see.
- <i>Don't</i> worry about it.

191
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,596
Hey, what the fuck? You <i>don't</i> want to fuck
with the master, baby.

192
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,075
- Come on.
- Hey, you guys, come on. <i>Let's</i> go.

193
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,157
<i>But he emerged from this moment of crisis</i>
<i>triumphant.</i>

194
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,069
<i>His middle period</i>
<i>is characterised by a heroic tone,</i>

195
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,757
<i>as in his opera,</i> Fidelio,

196
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,437
<i>where a wife saves</i>
<i>her imprisoned husband from murder</i>

197
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,276
<i>at the hands of his enemy.</i>

198
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,556
Come here, Dot.
<i>Don't</i> be scared, you need some colour.

199
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,391
<i>It's</i> too bad I stopped seeing you
after your mom died.

200
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,277
I always wanted a sister.

201
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,955
You know, maybe if you would have had
a female influence in your life,

202
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,593
you <i>wouldn't</i> look like a janitor.

203
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,795
There, looks perfect.
Now you actually look like a woman.

204
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,109
Later.

205
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,357
I had a pop quiz in history today. I got a B-.

206
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,637
- <i>That's</i> too bad.
- Michelle got a C.

207
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,192
I thought it was a good thing.

208
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,392
The least you could do
is say something supportive.

209
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,036
Your hair is getting so long.

210
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,753
<i>It's</i> so soft.

211
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,639
Thanks, Daddy.

212
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,110
<i>I was seven when my mom died.</i>

213
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,909
<i>After that, my father became my world.</i>

214
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,632
<i>When I was little,</i>
<i>even if I was just practising scales,</i>

215
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,391
<i>my father would press his back</i>
<i>against the base of our upright piano</i>

216
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,999
<i>with his eyes closed</i>

217
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,317
<i>so that he could feel the vibrations</i>
<i>of the piano strings.</i>

218
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,671
<i>It was his way of listening.</i>

219
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,475
<i>One day</i>

220
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,071
<i>we were eating French fries.</i>

221
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,713
<i>I was playing with the ketchup on my plate.</i>

222
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,029
<i>My father told me</i>
<i>he had to run across the street to the bank.</i>

223
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,675
<i>I said I had to go to the bathroom.</i>

224
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,757
<i>He told me to meet him</i>
<i>in front of the restaurant.</i>

225
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,471
<i>By the time I got there,</i>
<i>there were people everywhere.</i>

226
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,595
<i>My father had run in front of a truck</i>
<i>and was killed.</i>

227
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,190
<i>The police officer told me</i>
<i>that he probably died on impact.</i>

228
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,030
<i>It was fast, there was no pain.</i>

229
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,188
<i>I'm supposed to find comfort in that.</i>

230
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,794
<i>For the record, he had looked both ways,</i>

231
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,317
<i>but he couldn't hear the truck's horn</i>
<i>honking at him.</i>

232
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,917
<i>No one ran to save him.</i>

233
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,160
<i>No one bothered to run out and grab him.</i>

234
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,875
<i>If I had been there with him,</i>
<i>it would have been different.</i>

235
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,316
<i>If I hadn't left him alone.</i>

236
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,268
Daddy.

237
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,950
You have such a beautiful back.

238
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,310
If only you <i>weren't</i> so beautiful.

239
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,599
I gained three pounds.
I weighed myself in gym.

240
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,073
What was that?

241
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,355
How is the Alderside house coming?

242
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,834
Fine, fine.

243
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,194
<i>I'm</i> spending the night at Michelle's.

244
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,074
- <i>It's</i> a school night.
- And your point is?

245
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,232
- You're not going.
- Mom.

246
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,993
Why <i>can't</i> she go?

247
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,959
<i>Don't</i> contradict me just to contradict me.

248
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,951
We're just going to the movies
with a bunch of friends.

249
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,069
Boys?

250
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,554
- <i>It's</i> none of your business.
- <i>I'm</i> just curious.

251
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,433
Yeah, Michelle and I were gonna gang-bang
the entire varsity squad

252
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,676
in the back row of the Cineplex.

253
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,074
You're not going.

254
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,309
Why not?

255
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,351
I finished all my homework.

256
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,590
She finished all her homework.

257
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,039
- So can I go?
- Well, <i>it's</i> up to your father.

258
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,559
Thanks, Dad.

259
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,036
Hello? Yeah. I'll be out in a sec.

260
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,957
<i>Michelle's</i> waiting outside. Bye.

261
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,473
<i>What's</i> wrong?

262
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,435
- She thinks she can do whatever she wants.
- She just wants to go to a movie.

263
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,393
You're not helping me, Olivia.
You're not helping me.

264
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,272
<i>I'm</i> trying to raise her.

265
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,075
I am trying to do things right,
and you are not helping me.

266
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,838
You constantly contradict me.

267
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,428
Calm down. I hate it when you snap at me.

268
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,835
You undermine my authority.

269
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,032
- <i>Don't</i> be ridiculous, they're just girls.
- Jesus.

270
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,915
<i>I'm</i> sorry you had to see that, Dot.

271
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,909
Well, he loses his temper once in a while
for no good reason.

272
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,993
People can be very complicated, Dot.

273
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,758
You know, your mother was complicated.
Your mother was a slut.

274
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,750
I married the first man I was with,
but not your mother.

275
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,037
Your mother was a big, old, lucky slut.

276
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,551
You look like your mother, you know that?

277
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,559
You are the same age now
as your mother was when we met.

278
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,155
Hold on.

279
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,748
Here was our apartment after graduation.
We shared a bedroom.

280
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,113
I put that wallpaper up
with my own two hands.

281
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,278
God, look at my hair.

282
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,193
You know, you should make
more of an effort to keep up appearances.

283
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,310
There you go, you look much better.

284
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,996
I envy your mother sometimes.

285
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,277
Never having to grow old.

286
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,951
What, you want to go to a movie?

287
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,675
Of course. Sure, I can take you.

288
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,035
You're in no condition to drive.

289
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,550
<i>She's</i> all alone, Paul. She wants to go
to a movie. <i>It's</i> the least I can do.

290
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,669
The poor girl.

291
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,199
I'll drive her.

292
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,916
Paul is going to drive you.

293
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,868
Move over so I can sit next to Connor.

294
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,631
I want to see if he gets a hard-on
when I put my hand in his lap.

295
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,395
Should we ask Dot to sit with us?

296
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,073
- Some people prefer to sit alone.
- Yeah, dude. <i>She's</i> a buzzkill, man.

297
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,509
No, I... Seriously, guys, think about it.

298
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,792
I mean, imagine what <i>that's</i> got to be like,
you know? Not being able to hear?

299
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,438
- <i>It's</i> fucking depressing.
- She knows what <i>it's</i> like to hear.

300
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,313
She lost her hearing
when she was seven, after her mom died.

301
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,112
She was totally normal before that.

302
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,708
- <i>That's</i> cool.
- I <i>don't</i> know,

303
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,434
I bet <i>it'd</i> be harder losing something
than never having had it at all.

304
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,916
Okay, Deepak Chopra Winfrey.
Thanks for the life lesson.

305
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,796
<i>One day we wake up</i>
<i>and we realise the world sucks.</i>

306
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,111
<i>And we suck for being in it.</i>

307
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,639
<i>And we run away.</i>

308
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,154
<i>I'm</i> telling you, <i>she's</i> a hermaphrodite.

309
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,436
What? You <i>don't</i> believe me?

310
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,759
<i>Anything but to face ourselves as we are.</i>

311
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,036
<i>Anything to avoid asking</i>

312
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,669
<i>why we hate ourselves so much.</i>

313
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,274
How do you know if you're a good kisser?

314
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,073
What do you mean?

315
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,395
I mean, if you were a bad kisser,
do you think people would tell you?

316
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,318
Or do you think you'd, like,
actually live your whole life

317
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,749
thinking you were a good kisser?

318
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,473
I <i>don't</i> know.

319
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,796
<i>You'd</i> have to ask, I guess.

320
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,349
Find someone you really trust
and kiss them.

321
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,350
And then ask them how it was.

322
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,955
I guess.

323
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,919
<i>I'm</i> sick, Dot.

324
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,039
<i>I'm</i> sick and I hate it.

325
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,509
I thought

326
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,275
when you came here,
maybe things would change.

327
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,798
I thought maybe having
somebody else here would...

328
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,839
I <i>don't</i> know.

329
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,436
I <i>don't</i> know what I thought.

330
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,588
I hate it.

331
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,948
<i>If you could live anywhere in the world,</i>
<i>where would it be?</i>

332
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,234
I <i>don't</i> know.

333
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,477
Did you ever think about that before?

334
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,672
- Of course. I think about it all the time.
- Well, where then?

335
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,919
How about you?

336
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,633
Florida, maybe.

337
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,750
- Super sunny.
- Yeah.

338
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,599
Maybe Australia.

339
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,151
Random. Why?

340
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,112
<i>It's</i> really far away.

341
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,949
Whatever, Nina.

342
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,311
Just wait until your mom and dad are asleep
and sneak out. <i>It's</i> not that hard.

343
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,635
My <i>mom's</i> a chronic insomniac,
I do it all the time.

344
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,035
- I mean, with your mom it should be easy.
- Michelle.

345
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,709
Def Jam Records over there <i>won't</i> tattle.
She <i>won't</i> hear you.

346
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,553
- Look, I said <i>I'd</i> try.
- Come on, it'll be fun. <i>It's</i> just the four of us.

347
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,796
We've got the place to ourselves,
my <i>parents'</i> liquor cabinet.

348
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,558
Maybe you can snag some pills
from your mom.

349
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,955
Her <i>mom's</i> a major prescriptaholic.

350
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,509
- Michelle.
- What?

351
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,073
- Shut up.
- She is.

352
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,671
We're gonna be late for practise.

353
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,559
- Why the dramarama?
- Nothing.

354
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,352
Look at me right now.

355
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,471
<i>Brian's</i> parents are going to be gone
for one night.

356
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,318
Connor and Brian
want us to get drunk with them,

357
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,032
and you're not gonna fuck this up for me.

358
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,196
Why do I have to be there?
Why <i>can't</i> you invite Fiona?

359
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,390
Because he <i>doesn't</i> want to fuck Fiona.
He wants to fuck you.

360
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,238
Look, I said <i>I'd</i> try, Michelle. Drop it.

361
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,952
You know, your mom passes out
by 9:00 every night

362
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,640
and your dad must go to sleep sometime.

363
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,712
I gotta go to class.

364
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,476
- Hello?
<i>- How's my baby girl?</i>

365
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,029
What do you want?

366
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,755
<i>I just had a quiet moment at the office.</i>
<i>I thought I'd see how you're doing.</i>

367
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,633
- Fine.
<i>- Are you in your cheerleading uniform?</i>

368
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,272
I gotta get to class.
<i>I'm</i> turning my phone off.

369
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,873
Who was that?

370
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,157
My mom. <i>She's</i> so needy.

371
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,149
Shit!

372
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,669
Hey, Dot.

373
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,472
Life sucks, Dot. I feel like I can tell you this.

374
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,995
I feel like I can be honest
because you <i>can't</i> hear, or can you?

375
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,194
Look at you.

376
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,158
Eating your sandwich like a piglet
while I talk.

377
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,911
<i>It's</i> strangely comforting.

378
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,715
When I first met you,
and when you first moved in, I hated you.

379
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,438
I hated your face,

380
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,351
and your dumb blank stare.

381
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,075
But now that I feel like I know you again,
all <i>that's</i> changed.

382
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,029
<i>It's</i> so nice to know that <i>there's</i> someone
whose life sucks more than mine.

383
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,676
<i>I'm</i> gonna kill my dad, Dot.

384
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,509
Tonight.

385
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,072
I hate him, you know.

386
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,471
I hate him but I love him.

387
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,875
I hate it when he <i>won't</i> let me go out
with my friends,

388
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,116
but I love it when he fucks me.

389
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,628
I hate when he fucks me, too, though.

390
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,354
You see how that works?
It <i>doesn't</i> make any sense.

391
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,192
He likes it
when I bite on his nipples, though.

392
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,232
I stick the tip of his nipple between my teeth

393
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,798
and I rub my tongue back and forth on it,
like a windshield wiper.

394
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,398
It drives him wild.

395
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,110
I made him come once
just by sucking on his nipples.

396
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,435
I <i>didn't</i> even have to touch his dick once.

397
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,308
I love that I can tell you this shit.

398
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,152
Because <i>it's</i> like <i>it's</i> off my chest,
but <i>it's</i> still a secret, you know?

399
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,951
<i>Michelle's dad's</i> got a gun.

400
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,518
I know where it is.

401
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,515
But I figure <i>it'd</i> be too gross.

402
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,880
You know, with <i>Mom's</i> decorating and all.

403
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,354
Although <i>she's</i> probably already joined

404
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,358
Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe
in pill <i>popper's</i> paradise.

405
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,835
<i>She's</i> like an E! True Meriden Story.

406
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,112
<i>I'm</i> gonna do it late.

407
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,996
Mom <i>won't</i> wake up.

408
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,633
You <i>can't</i> hear.

409
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,193
It'll just be me,

410
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,354
my daddy,

411
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,113
and a bullet.

412
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,078
<i>Michelle's</i> gonna steal it for me
this afternoon.

413
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,555
Pow.

414
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,595
Hey, hey, sorry. Did I scare you?

415
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,039
I <i>didn't</i> mean to.

416
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,149
I was just looking for you.

417
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,554
I heard the music. That's, like, amazing.

418
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,558
I've never been good at anything
other than basketball.

419
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,075
Look,

420
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,191
I was just wondering when you wanted
to get together to write up the lab.

421
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,309
Dot.

422
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,549
Dot!

423
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,273
The wallpaper in the dining room
is revolting.

424
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,710
- They ordered the wrong paper.
- Yeah, well, it makes me nauseous.

425
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,229
They made a mistake. They'll replace it.

426
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,349
If I had to eat dinner
and look at that every day,

427
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,040
- I would seriously hurl.
- <i>That's</i> enough.

428
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,632
What? <i>I'm</i> just saying.

429
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,230
What, is it illegal now
to have an opinion in this house?

430
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,792
- <i>That's</i> Michelle.
- You two are joined at the hip.

431
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,150
Yeah, we're friends, Mom,
<i>that's</i> what best friends do.

432
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,236
If you had any, <i>you'd</i> know.

433
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,031
- Connor.
- I should have called.

434
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,991
- What are you doing here?
- Is she here?

435
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,519
She should be here by now.

436
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,915
You know Michelle,
<i>she'd</i> be late to her own funeral.

437
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,632
You can come in, though.

438
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,673
- I came to see Dot.
- Dot?

439
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,031
Yeah. I mean, she lives here, right?
She lives with you?

440
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,513
Yeah, totally.

441
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,195
Yeah, Dot totally lives here, yeah.

442
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,757
I figured it <i>wouldn't</i> make much sense
to call. Can I come in?

443
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,158
Yeah. Sorry. <i>I'm</i> totally rude.

444
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,556
My mom is decorating
so we're eating in the kitchen. Come on in.

445
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,035
Okay.

446
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,637
- You're not Michelle.
- No, <i>I'm</i> not.

447
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,316
- Who are you?
- <i>I'm</i> Connor.

448
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,870
You never told us about Connor, Nina.
Why the big secret?

449
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,879
He came for Dot.

450
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,676
What are you going to do with her?

451
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,068
We're lab partners in biology.

452
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,192
That must be Michelle.

453
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,192
Put this somewhere.

454
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,118
I waited until my dad was asleep.

455
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,949
- So, you go to school with Nina and Dot?
- <i>That's</i> right, sir.

456
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,959
Nina never mentioned you.

457
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,152
- <i>Don't</i> give him the third degree, Paul.
- What third degree?

458
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,080
- <i>Connor's</i> here.
- What?

459
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,518
He wants to see Dot.

460
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,916
Clearly an excuse. He knows we're like BFF.

461
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,238
- Fucking A. How do I look?
- Hot.

462
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,430
- Does he want to fuck me?
- Yes.

463
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,109
- Say it.
- Say what?

464
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,755
- Say he wants to fuck me.
- He wants to fuck you.

465
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,553
Connor Kennedy wants to fuck me.

466
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,075
Connor Kennedy wants to fuck you.

467
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,995
<i>Let's</i> rock.

468
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,635
Wait! Let me stash this.
The last thing I need is my dad finding it.

469
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,349
Dot and I actually have to go over
our biology lab.

470
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,835
I thought maybe we could go to the library.

471
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,756
Hi, Mr and Mrs Deer.

472
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,393
- Hi, Connor.
- Hey.

473
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,829
- Dinner looks great, Mrs Deer.
- <i>It's</i> from Bene, Bene. On York.

474
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,713
What are you looking at?

475
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,714
You think you two are the only ones
that do homework?

476
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,277
Okay. See you later.

477
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,228
- Where are they going?
- To the library.

478
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,189
- And you're letting her go?
- Why not?

479
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,153
- You never let me do anything.
- That is not true.

480
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,679
He could be some sick fuck,
you <i>don't</i> know.

481
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,279
He said he was a friend of yours
from school.

482
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,355
And you believed him?

483
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,552
You introduced us to him,
you let him in the house.

484
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,674
I just... I have a few questions about the...

485
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,994
About the lab.

486
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,150
See, I gotta get a good mark in bio

487
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,238
<i>'cause I need to pull a B to get this
basketball scholarship at UConn

488
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,318
and I know that <i>I'm</i> not going to get
anything better than a C- in English,

489
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,793
so I kind of need this.

490
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,353
Can I help you?

491
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,870
I think we need another minute.

492
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,439
What flavour?

493
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,714
<i>She's</i> deaf.

494
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,110
But if you speak slowly,
she can read your lips.

495
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,389
Vanilla?

496
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,148
Strawberry?

497
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,228
Chocolate?

498
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,076
Nothing for me. <i>I'm</i> fine, thanks.

499
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,708
Chocolate?

500
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,195
Do you think my nipples
are abnormally big?

501
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,753
Michelle, put your tit away.

502
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,314
Well, Steph Simon was talking about it
in the locker room.

503
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,793
- Your nipples?
- Nope.

504
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,512
Nipples in general.

505
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,833
- Dad! Jesus Christ, <i>can't</i> you knock?
- I did knock.

506
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,273
Yeah, but can you wait until I say
<i>"Come in,"</i> or something?

507
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,153
I just wanted to see
if <i>you'd</i> finished your homework.

508
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,192
I told you I did it this afternoon. Fuck.

509
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,114
Nina, can I talk to you for a second?

510
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,555
Nina?

511
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,392
- What?
- <i>It's</i> a school night.

512
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,999
- So what?
- And <i>it's</i> late.

513
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,553
You should be focusing on your homework.

514
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,033
- Send her home.
- We are doing homework.

515
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,037
You're not finished,
you're in there doing your nails.

516
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,628
Just send her home, okay?
<i>It's</i> a school night.

517
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,398
- You gotta go.
- Go?

518
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,837
- Go where?
- I <i>don't</i> know. Home, I guess.

519
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,791
- Why?
- Just because.

520
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,559
- What if Connor comes back?
- I'll call you.

521
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,989
Okay, well, <i>I'm</i> picking you up at midnight
and we're going to Brian's.

522
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,235
I can't!

523
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,749
<i>I'm</i> not stupid, Dot. <i>I'm</i> not.
People think I am,

524
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,558
but <i>I'm</i> not. I mean, I...

525
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,353
I have this learning disorder. I have ADD.

526
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,869
People think a lot of stupid things.

527
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,030
I mean, people think
I fucked Frederica Diaz, it's...

528
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,512
I think about you sometimes.

529
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,833
I think about how you look naked,

530
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,072
and how quiet you are.

531
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,554
Like a doll.

532
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,396
You're a virgin, too, <i>aren't</i> you, Dot?

533
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,958
Stop. Stop it.

534
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,669
<i>I'm</i> fat.

535
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,800
You always say that. Where are you fat?

536
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,038
- I <i>don't</i> see any fat. Where is the fat, here?
- Stop.

537
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,388
Any there?

538
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,353
- Here?
- Stop it.

539
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,795
- I have something for you.
- What?

540
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,276
- A present.
- No, you're just saying that.

541
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,960
No, <i>it's</i> true. <i>I'm</i> gonna give it to you.

542
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,354
But first...

543
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,639
What was that?

544
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,592
Dot broke the statue.

545
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,191
<i>I'm</i> gonna get the dustpan.

546
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,435
You're gonna have to be a little more
careful around here, young lady.

547
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,875
<i>Don't</i> touch it, you'll cut yourself.

548
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,835
Olivia.

549
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,153
Dad, I said I was tired.

550
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,840
Be honest. Do you think <i>I'm</i> fat?

551
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,948
Be honest.

552
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,995
I guess I can trust you, right, Dot? I mean,

553
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,153
why would you lie to me?
You <i>don't</i> care about me.

554
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,717
<i>Tonight's</i> the night, Dot.

555
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,559
I can feel it.

556
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,113
Tonight <i>I'm</i> gonna kill him.

557
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,312
And <i>I'm</i> gonna do it at midnight.
It'll be the perfect time.

558
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,438
You know, <i>it's</i> so good
that you <i>can't</i> hear, Dot.

559
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,996
Otherwise, <i>you'd</i> be, like, an accomplice.

560
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,439
<i>Department of Child Welfare.</i>
<i>Gina McQueen speaking.</i>

561
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,469
<i>Hello?</i>

562
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,589
<i>Hello?</i>

563
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,517
H-O-T, hot!

564
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,115
The Cougar team is hot.

565
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,836
H-O-T, hot!

566
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,118
When we say roar, you say net.

567
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,276
Go for the net. Meriden.

568
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,028
Meriden.

569
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,276
They got boys but we got men.

570
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,073
The Cougars stand up proud and tall.

571
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,555
The Cougars rock at basketball!

572
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,915
Hey.

573
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,913
I <i>didn't</i> see you there.

574
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,311
I suck at basketball and...

575
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,189
You know, usually when we win,

576
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,551
<i>there's</i> a whole bunch of people
waiting outside of our locker room,

577
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,113
cheering us on.

578
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,472
Got out fast today.

579
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,438
Nobody likes a loser.

580
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,194
You know,
I was thinking about you last night.

581
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,192
I was thinking that

582
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,599
if we went on a road trip,
how quiet it would be.

583
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,598
You know, we could go all the way
through Long Island to Pennsylvania.

584
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,359
You know,
<i>that's</i> where they make <i>Hershey's</i> chocolate.

585
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,799
Pennsylvania.

586
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,469
And all the lamp posts
look like <i>Hershey's</i> Kisses.

587
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,235
They give you free <i>M&M's</i> at the factory.

588
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,632
I can smell your hair.

589
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,957
It smells like cucumbers.

590
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,997
I got really, really hard last night.

591
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,638
I had to beat off.

592
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,154
And my mom was just outside of my room,
putting the towels away.

593
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,998
You know, I could hear her,

594
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,758
but I <i>couldn't</i> help myself.

595
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,434
I mean, I came four times.

596
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,355
I mean, four times, that <i>isn't</i> normal, is it?

597
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,159
What am I gonna do?

598
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,919
<i>I'm</i> this sex addict with a learning disorder
who forgot how to play basketball.

599
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,032
The <i>landscaper's</i> coming at noon tomorrow.

600
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,713
You told me already.

601
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,870
Is Nina at the basketball game?

602
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,997
<i>She's</i> your daughter.
You <i>don't</i> know where she is?

603
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,351
Well, of course I know where she is,
<i>she's</i> at the basketball game.

604
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,438
That boy that came over the other night
was on the basketball team.

605
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,676
- I thought he was very cute.
- Cute?

606
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,949
For Nina.

607
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,273
Careful, Olivia.

608
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,433
What with all these music videos
and magazines,

609
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,515
do you really think she needs you

610
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,029
to push her into dating
and dressing like a slut?

611
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,909
Paul?

612
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,598
Have I gotten fat?

613
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,396
<i>She's</i> only 17.
When you were 17, you were still a virgin.

614
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,269
Come on, just look. You <i>didn't</i> even look.
Come here, see if you can pinch an inch.

615
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,789
- See if you can pinch an inch.
- Good night.

616
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,039
You're mean. <i>I'm</i> sleeping on the floor.

617
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,554
- Get into bed, Olivia.
- I <i>don't</i> want to, <i>I'm</i> comfortable here.

618
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,355
- Get into bed.
- Leave me alone!

619
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,320
Olivia, get into bed.
You're gonna catch a cold.

620
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,192
Yeah, it'll be all your fault.

621
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,588
See, <i>I'm</i> still as light as a feather.

622
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,988
You know,
I've kissed a bunch of girls before.

623
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,753
<i>It's</i> all right.

624
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,473
But I've never done it, you know, the it.

625
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,039
Stuck it inside.

626
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,749
What?

627
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,748
What is it?

628
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,513
<i>That's</i> all right.

629
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,309
Nina?

630
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,155
Nina?

631
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,958
- What?
- <i>Where's</i> Dot?

632
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,877
How am I supposed to know?

633
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,790
- How was the game?
- It sucked.

634
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,429
We lost.

635
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,476
<i>Don't</i> get it on my uniform.

636
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,314
I've got something
that might make you feel better.

637
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,429
What?

638
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,792
- Daddy!
- Open it.

639
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,230
What? Oh, my God!

640
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,191
- I told you I got you a present.
- I love it!

641
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,356
- You really like it?
- Yes, I love it.

642
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,789
I love it, Dad. <i>It's</i> so great.

643
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,198
- Wait a minute, Dad, wait a minute.
- <i>What's</i> the matter?

644
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,309
Stop.

645
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,749
Gosh. I gotta iron my uniform
before I go to bed.

646
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,109
So...

647
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,358
I'll be in my room.

648
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,509
You okay?

649
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,909
Oh, shit.

650
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,316
Do you think I have a big dick, Dot?

651
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,715
I mean, I've measured it.

652
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,718
<i>It's</i> pretty small when <i>it's</i> soft,

653
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,037
but when it gets hard, <i>it's</i> pretty big.

654
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,029
Wait.

655
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,072
Dot! Wait!

656
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,669
Come in.

657
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,710
I knocked and waited this time.

658
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,479
<i>Don't</i> do that, I <i>can't</i> see what <i>I'm</i> doing.
I'll burn myself and be disfigured.

659
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,548
Dad, I gotta do this.

660
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,116
- Iron it before the next game.
- I <i>don't</i> like my uniform hot.

661
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,389
Stop it!

662
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,268
I like to iron it and let it cool off.

663
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,111
Dad, I have a secret for you.

664
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,514
- You do?
- Yeah.

665
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,471
- A surprise.
- Really?

666
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,954
Sit down.

667
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,033
Close your eyes.

668
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,230
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

669
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,115
I want you to be ready for this.

670
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,318
Keep them closed.

671
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,639
That feels nice.

672
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,391
I love you so much, Nina.

673
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,632
- What was that?
- Probably Dot. Honey, who cares?

674
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,910
Were you not gonna yell at her
for coming home so late?

675
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,679
No, no, no, no, no. Not right now.
<i>I'm</i> still waiting for my surprise.

676
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,793
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

677
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,152
I have to tell you something,
but you have to promise not to get angry.

678
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,192
Of course, of course, honey,
anything. Anything.

679
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,077
You have to promise first.

680
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,433
Just tell me.

681
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,879
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

682
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,638
- Swear!
- What is it?

683
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,869
<i>I'm</i> pregnant. You can open your eyes now.

684
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,913
- What do you mean, Nina?
- <i>I'm</i> pregnant, Daddy.

685
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,076
- <i>I'm</i> pregnant.
- Well, <i>that's</i> impossible!

686
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,599
You <i>don't</i> believe me?

687
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,350
- How do you know?
- I took a test!

688
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,439
- Those tests <i>aren't</i> accurate.
- They're 97% accurate, Daddy,

689
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,120
and I <i>haven't</i> had a period in six weeks.

690
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,389
Fuck!

691
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,228
<i>That's</i> it?

692
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,551
- <i>That's</i> all you're gonna say?
- What are you gonna do about it?

693
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,151
What am I gonna do about it?

694
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,836
What do you think <i>I'm</i> gonna do about it?

695
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,713
I <i>don't</i> want a baby with webbed feet
running around the house, Daddy!

696
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,671
- I just wanted to make sure.
- Do you think <i>I'm</i> crazy?

697
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,756
I just wanted to make sure!

698
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,359
I need $1,000.

699
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,239
$1,000?

700
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,590
<i>There's</i> an anonymous clinic in Fairfield.

701
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,518
- You <i>haven't</i> told anyone?
- Of course not.

702
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,788
All right.

703
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,913
I'll write you a cheque.

704
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,953
You <i>can't</i> write me a cheque, Daddy.
<i>It's</i> not anonymous. I need cash.

705
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,072
I'll get it tomorrow.

706
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,392
Where are you going?

707
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,868
<i>I'm</i> tired.

708
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,032
You're probably tired, too.
<i>It's</i> a school night.

709
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,389
<i>I used to hold my breath underwater</i>
<i>for long periods at a time.</i>

710
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,636
<i>My father took me to the YMCA</i>
<i>Saturday mornings.</i>

711
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,549
<i>Submerged in the pool,</i>
<i>I heard nothing but my own heartbeat</i>

712
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,511
<i>echoing against the water.</i>

713
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,989
<i>I would've stayed underwater forever</i>

714
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:03,318
<i>if my father hadn't been waiting for me</i>
<i>in the bleachers by the diving pool.</i>

715
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,228
I killed my goldfish when I was little, Dot.
I had six of them.

716
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,234
And I cut them in half with scissors.

717
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:20,435
<i>When someone is waiting for you,</i>
<i>you have to come up for air.</i>

718
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,436
I was braver when I was a kid.

719
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,315
Hey.

720
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,556
I was just wondering if <i>you'd</i> want...

721
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,315
Myrna, can you do me a favour
and ask Dot in sign language

722
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,032
if <i>she'd</i> go to the Spring Fling
with me tonight?

723
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,195
Sure.

724
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,155
- She says no.
- What do you mean, no?

725
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,236
- <i>That's</i> what she said.
- No, I mean, sign that back to her.

726
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,032
Sign back, "What do you mean, <i>no?"</i>

727
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,519
She says she <i>can't</i> go, she says <i>she's</i> sorry.

728
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,512
I <i>don't</i> understand.

729
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,949
She says to let it go now.
She says <i>she's</i> not right for you.

730
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:18,437
How does she know <i>what's</i> right for me?
Just ask her.

731
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,475
She says she belongs by herself.

732
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,558
<i>It's</i> just a dance.

733
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,189
Hey.

734
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,395
<i>I'm</i> taking you to the dance, Dot.

735
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,597
- Carrots.
- Me, too.

736
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,959
- <i>I'm</i> gonna make that fucking whore...
- Michelle, take it down a notch.

737
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,469
The whole world already knows
you're a cunt.

738
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,590
<i>There's</i> nothing left to prove.

739
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,276
I thought you could wear this to the dance.

740
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,038
I think it'll look pretty on you.

741
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,109
Suit yourself. Fine.

742
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:18,835
I'll just put it in the dumpster
or give it to the Salvation Army.

743
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,233
Dot, I have some good news for you.

744
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:36,435
After tomorrow night,
you are going to be an only child.

745
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,837
<i>That's</i> right, <i>I'm</i> taking off.

746
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,316
I mean, who wants to stick around
for murder charges? Not me.

747
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,998
<i>I'm</i> getting out of here.

748
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,638
I think maybe I could start over
in New Haven, you know?

749
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,398
I could work at a bar

750
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,519
or be a stripper.

751
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,793
I saw this show on MTV about strippers.

752
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,798
They make a lot of money
and <i>it's</i> easy, I guess.

753
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:04,112
Some of them even become famous,
like Courtney Love. She was a stripper.

754
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,996
I could be like her, maybe.

755
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,952
I mean, I <i>wouldn't</i> really care,
bunch of old guys looking at my tits.

756
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,236
<i>Wouldn't</i> matter, at least <i>I'd</i> be getting paid.

757
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,273
It was so hard

758
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,872
to lie to my dad about being pregnant

759
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,877
that I think a part of me thinks <i>it's</i> true.

760
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,559
Is that crazy?

761
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,149
I'll have $1,000, though.

762
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,556
That'll be enough to get me started
in New Haven before I have to get a job.

763
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,674
It'll be perfect.

764
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,709
You know, I am not letting you go
to the dance without lipstick,

765
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,478
I just <i>can't</i> do it.

766
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,515
This one smells like strawberries.

767
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,638
Connor will go crazy
when you go to kiss him.

768
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,675
Perfect.

769
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,357
Now you almost look human.

770
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,998
<i>Beethoven's best work</i>
<i>comes in his late period,</i>

771
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,356
<i>a period of complete deafness.</i>

772
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,958
<i>I imagine his mind</i>

773
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,392
<i>must have been the loudest silence</i>
<i>in history.</i>

774
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,878
You <i>don't</i> like it?

775
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,395
Dot, you <i>can't</i> go to the dance like this.

776
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,875
You look like you should be pumping gas.

777
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,593
What about Connor?
<i>He's</i> totally hot for you!

778
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,116
You are a major enigma, Dot.

779
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,231
I <i>don't</i> know how you do it.

780
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,394
Do you want to let me in on your secret?

781
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,839
<i>They say that the truth can set you free.</i>

782
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,273
<i>That's a lie.</i>

783
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,398
<i>The truth is, lies can protect us.</i>

784
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,913
<i>Lies keep us safe</i>

785
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,039
<i>from the truth.</i>

786
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:39,309
Nina?

787
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,394
- Nina?
- Jesus Christ, Dad, you scared me.

788
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,194
How do I look?

789
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,039
- I brought you the money.
- I look like shit.

790
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,991
$1,000, <i>isn't</i> that what you said?

791
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,439
$1,000, right.

792
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,710
- So you can fix the problem.
- Right. Fix.

793
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,115
Because you're pregnant,
I went to the bank and got cash.

794
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,316
- Great.
- Because you're pregnant.

795
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,317
Dad, I really wish
that you would stop saying it.

796
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,839
- That you're pregnant?
- Stop it!

797
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,871
- What? You're pregnant, <i>aren't</i> you?
- Dad.

798
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,991
- I can keep saying it.
- Well, I really wish you wouldn't!

799
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,395
- You're pregnant, Nina, say it!
- No!

800
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,509
<i>I'm</i> gonna go and get ready.

801
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,030
- I can say it over and over again.
- No! You're scaring me.

802
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,549
But no matter how many times I repeat it,

803
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,750
no matter how many times I repeat it,

804
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,348
it still <i>doesn't</i> make it true,
<i>isn't</i> that right, Nina?

805
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,435
Huh?

806
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,752
My daughter is a whore.

807
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,434
What is that?

808
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:41,750
<i>It is a neighbourhood</i>
<i>where 12 families have lost their homes.</i>

809
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,030
<i>- The fire broke Friday...</i>
- What is that?

810
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,435
Listen to me, Nina! Listen to me.

811
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,871
<i>I'm</i> sick of your bullshit.

812
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,760
I <i>don't</i> know what you're talking about.

813
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,795
- Tampons?
- I can explain.

814
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,277
- I bought you that purse.
- Dad.

815
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,550
As a present. And this is how you repay me?

816
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,750
By using it to hide your lies?

817
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,190
- They're Michelle's.
- Don't, Nina. Don't.

818
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:12,073
Are you trying to make me
into some kind of an asshole?

819
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,839
- Are you?
- Dad, I swear they're Michelle's.

820
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,469
<i>She's</i> not bringing her purse
and <i>I'm</i> carrying them for her.

821
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,953
No, Nina. No.

822
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,833
You lied to me.

823
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,551
Do you know how scared I was?

824
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,994
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

825
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,758
Do you know how frightened I was?

826
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,118
I love you, Daddy.

827
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,751
- What happened to my baby girl?
- <i>I'm</i> still your baby girl!

828
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:57,555
My baby girl who would listen to me
and tell me the truth.

829
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,750
I'll tell you <i>what's</i> happened to her.

830
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:03,031
- <i>She's</i> turned into a little bitch!
- <i>That's</i> not true.

831
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:06,630
- You're hurting me!
- Why did you lie to me?

832
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:11,112
- Why?
- Listen to me, Daddy, <i>I'm</i> sorry.

833
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,668
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

834
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,631
Daddy, stop it. Please.

835
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,997
I was scared, you know.

836
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,469
I was scared.

837
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,556
No, please. I have to get ready to go out.

838
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,594
Please <i>don't</i> do this. Don't, please.

839
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:39,955
Stop!

840
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,352
- No!
- You trying to make an asshole out of me?

841
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,469
Daddy, please,

842
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,919
- <i>don't</i> hit me. I have to go, please.
- No.

843
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,439
- No.
- We can do this when I get back.

844
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,232
- I have to get ready!
- No!

845
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,794
Please, I have to get ready to go out.

846
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,152
Please, <i>don't</i> do this, don't.

847
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,271
- Please! <i>Don't</i> make me do this!
- I loved you.

848
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,913
- Please!
- I fucking love you!

849
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,793
You're hurting me! Stop it, please!

850
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,873
Please stop.

851
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,159
Stop it! No!

01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,556
Please don't, please! Please, no!

853

No! You killed my daddy!

You lying fucking bitch!

If you <i>wouldn't</i> have been

this would've never happened.

No one would've known.

No one would have ever known.

Move it or lose it, Nina!

877
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,313
Get it together.

878
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,079
Come on, Nina.

879
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,112
Go around the front,
we'll meet you in a second!

880
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:29,715
Go.

881
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:45,359
Nina, we have to bury the backpack.
We have to follow the plan.

882
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,275
- Jesus, it took you guys long enough.
- I <i>didn't</i> realise she was coming.

883
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,229
- <i>What's</i> with the backpack?
- Let me see.

884
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,509
Stop it!

885
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,673
So secretive.

886
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,877
Your eyes are red. Red, right?

887
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,639
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

888
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,599
- <i>What'd</i> you take?
- I <i>don't</i> remember what they were.

889
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,270
I think one was vicodin and maybe codeine.

890
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,391
Well, did you bring me some?

891
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:29,195
No.

892
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,595
- Do you have any cigarettes?
- Yeah.

893
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,153
Hold these for me
because I've gotta go find Brian.

894
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,988
There you are. Do you want to go dance?

895
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:59,075
<i>Let's</i> take that bag off.
Come on, you <i>can't</i> dance with it on.

896
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,318
Come on, <i>let's</i> go.

897
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,795
You're shaking. Are you nervous?

898
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,870
I like dancing with you, Dot.

899
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:15,948
Dot, wait.

900
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,149
Dot?

901
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,953
Turn around, Dot.

902
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,313
Can you hear me?

903
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,788
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

904
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,753
You can talk?

905
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,433
You can hear?

906
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,150
You're a psycho, you know that?

907
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:05,796
- All those things I said to you were private.
- I know that.

908
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,590
You sat there
and you listened to me talk about my dick.

909
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,953
You sat there and you listened to me talk
about how many times I beat off.

910
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,911
- Connor, please.
- What?

911
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,789
You <i>don't</i> like to hear it any more, Dot?

912
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,951
<i>It's</i> not as much fun when you have
to come up with an answer, is it, Dot?

913
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,957
- Please.
- No.

914
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,555
Fuck you.

915
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,551
Nina. Come on, we gotta go.

916
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,350
- Where are we going?
- Follow me.

917
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:07,955
Here.

918
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,036
I think <i>that's</i> deep enough.

919
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,830
I never got to bury my father.

920
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,476
Your father must have known

921
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,992
that you could hear.

922
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,518
It was our secret.

923
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,998
Why did you do it?

924
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,792
Because you wouldn't.

925
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,548
No, I mean,

926
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,472
why did you pretend
you were deaf in the first place?

927
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:51,954
I just...

928
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,990
I wanted to be closer to him.

929
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,990
And invisible to everyone else.

930
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,360
- Well, you <i>can't</i> now.
- Why?

931
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:16,235
Because then we'll both be alone.

932
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,759
<i>Let's</i> go home.

933
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,110
Mom! Where are they taking you?

934
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:27,998
Nina, hold on, <i>I'm</i> going to go away
for a little while, okay? <i>I'm</i> not well.

935
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,395
I did a terrible, terrible thing.

936
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,792
I killed your father.

937
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,348
He went crazy. He was throwing things,

938
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,870
and breaking things,
and he told me he hated me.

939
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,673
And I took a piano wire

940
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,952
and I strangled him with it.

941
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:48,516
- Okay, <i>time's</i> up.
- Hold on one second! Just let me finish.

942
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,754
I <i>didn't</i> want him to hurt you.
Nina, I never wanted him to hurt you.

943
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,999
<i>I'm</i> sorry, Nina. Can you ever forgive me?

944
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,233
I am so sorry.

945
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,957
<i>People always talk</i>
<i>about the quiet before the storm</i>

946
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:31,640
<i>but no one talks about the quiet after.</i>

947
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,597
<i>At least after the storm</i>

948
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,437
<i>you know it's really over.</i>

949
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:11,034
<i>When Beethoven died in 1827,</i>

950
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,515
<i>over 10,000 people came to mourn.</i>

951
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,758
From the beginning.

952
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:26,353
<i>I used to fantasize that when I died</i>
<i>there wouldn't be a funeral.</i>

953
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:31,994
<i>Having led my life invisibly,</i>
<i>no one would come to mourn.</i>

954
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,912
<i>But being invisible isn't worth it in the end.</i>

955
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:50,239
<i>Because when you're invisible,</i>
<i>other people may not see you</i>

956
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,720
<i>but you can't help seeing other people.</i>

957
