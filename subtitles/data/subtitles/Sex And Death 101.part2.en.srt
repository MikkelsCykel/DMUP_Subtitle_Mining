1
00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:05,504
A place like east, give you a
knife, fork and tablespoon.

2
00:00:05,545 --> 00:00:08,465
Wrapped in a napkin,
two of them are used.

3
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:11,551
Most of coffees
they don't put the tablespoon.

4
00:00:11,593 --> 00:00:15,639
To the small one they put it in the washing machine
of plates time and again.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,475
Unconscious of value.

6
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:23,647
Not alone it passes the creatures of stories
but also to the objects.

7
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:26,608
there will be amusement in the chat tonight.

8
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:30,494
Him these making again.

9
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:34,741
That curious thing and seductora with the look.

10
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:39,454
Not it is unpleasant.

11
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:46,461
But you should know that recently
I left a bad relationship so... 

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,548
I have just come out of bad several relationships.

13
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:53,760
I promise not to fall in love of
you if your you promise the same thing.

14
00:00:57,597 --> 00:00:58,724
I promise it.

15
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:07,482
Favorite singer,
1, 2, 3.

16
00:01:07,524 --> 00:01:08,608
- Cats Cradle.
- Cats Cradle.

17
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:10,659
Where he/she was born,
1, 2, 3.

18
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:12,654
- Nashville Skylight.
- Nashville Skylight.

19
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:17,659
The movie but comic,
1, 2, 3.

20
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:19,661
- Hot summer.
- Cadyshack.

21
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:23,463
Types in dresses that original.

22
00:01:23,498 --> 00:01:25,500
A woman to which he likes Cadyshack.

23
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:26,668
Why non habira of liking me?

24
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:33,633
All those feelings returned.

25
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:37,721
Then the third desire came,
I said that he/she wanted an alabaza head.

26
00:01:39,598 --> 00:01:44,686
Clear, taenia in the list Dra. Mir... 

27
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:47,481
but this serious but that a romance.

28
00:01:47,522 --> 00:01:49,691
But that alone to be with somebody.

29
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:54,696
This serious love,
why to hurry the sex?

30
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:58,742
The whole day people take out
the cars of the front.

31
00:01:59,493 --> 00:02:02,496
This bastard poor person of the mean
it has not been played in months.

32
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:04,498
- It is tragic.
- If, it is it.

33
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:07,459
You say that you look for ideas
for an infantile book,

34
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:08,710
how's it going these inanimate objects?

35
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:11,511
The tablespoon that you/they never use.

36
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:14,549
The lost stocking that you
it gathers with their lost twin.

37
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:17,636
The multireproductor of disks that
it is sadly out before

38
00:02:17,677 --> 00:02:20,639
of finishing the cds.

39
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,520
- That is.
- It is this way.

40
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:29,564
Roderick.

41
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:33,568
I have looked for you all my life.

42
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:41,660
You are the best!

43
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:44,454
Salt.

44
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,751
That kiss confused me but there is not
anything a warm kiss after

45
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:52,125
a homemade delicious dinner.

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,464
Congratulations for the chef.

47
00:02:58,552 --> 00:03:03,557
I was in the kitchen and the chef
he/she also believes that you are grandiose.

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,651
I sit down it, this is not... 

49
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:10,731
- This well, alone you relax yourself.
- No, Roderick.

50
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:18,655
I adore you, seriously that if, alone I am

51
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:22,492
tangled with regard to the sex.

52
00:03:22,617 --> 00:03:24,619
- This well.
- You are comely.

53
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:27,622
Very much if you want to know it.

54
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:32,711
It is alone that you remind me a lot
to the type with the one that my he/she suckles it left

55
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:38,467
after the divorce, it was not same
to you but it was a crossing entity your

56
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:41,678
and Bam Bam, of Picapiedra.

57
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:45,564
Not I am saying that never anything

58
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,727
it passed among us alone I say that... 

59
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:52,647
If it is that it will happen.

60
00:03:53,523 --> 00:03:54,649
It will happen.

61
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,527
- Truth?
- If.

62
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:59,696
Why to worry for that reason?

63
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:02,657
You are the best.

64
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:05,577
I will clean.

65
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,706
Your you can rent a movie,
something comic.

66
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:22,719
I suppose that one can say
that there I enter the madness.

67
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:27,641
Thank you, Miranda and I went to
retrospective wing of Fellini.

68
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:31,728
He/she said the but comic,
if it continued I live Goes him... 

69
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,522
Did you already throw it to you?

70
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:36,656
Why the question?

71
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:39,694
- Did you already throw it to you?
- Did you already throw it to you?

72
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,448
Son, did you already throw it to you?

73
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:54,501
Allow me to tell them something, Miranda and me

74
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:56,676
we are building a
knot of trust and respect.

75
00:04:56,711 --> 00:05:01,675
Pardon for even to believe that the love is something
but that a coalition of genital.

76
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,470
We have to discuss something.

77
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:08,682
- Shit.
- What does it happen?

78
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:11,476
Shit, shit.
Alone you hide me.

79
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:16,565
- Is there a half strange type?
- If, I already saw it.

80
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:20,569
I met him in a party of
poetry in Halloween.

81
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:22,654
Not I can believe that I went to bed with the one.

82
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:25,699
In halloween, 2 weeks ago?

83
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:28,577
I told you that it was tangled with the sex.

84
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:31,663
But that entangled these put to bed.

85
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:34,624
That is amusing,
we go to another part.

86
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:37,586
Bam Bam.

87
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:46,595
In the old times it was well
if a woman didn't go to bed with you.

88
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:49,723
For that was not as if him
he/she was making with somebody but

89
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,602
Where this the vixen of
Jane Austen when you need it?

90
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:55,729
I chose to remember the good times.

91
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:59,649
As Miranda me toward feeling
as if it was in only in the Earth.

92
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:02,569
That time that he/she read my report.

93
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:08,658
It is wonderful, seriously that if.

94
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,623
- But later in the lunch.
- How was your salad?

95
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:20,629
Wonderful, seriously that if.

96
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:25,634
CONDONE HE/SHE QUARRELS HE/SHE WANTS TO KNOW:

97
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,636
DID YOU ALREADY THROW IT TO YOU?

98
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:32,766
In conclusion, ahead, crucify me,
I refuse myself to live in a society

99
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:36,686
that it has reduced to the world in:
"Did you already throw it to you?"

100
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:39,564
- The answer is not.
- The answer is not.

101
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:43,527
Not I believe that you have seen it neither he/she undresses.

102
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,496
Wonderful, seriously that if.

103
00:06:54,704 --> 00:06:55,705
Carajo!

104
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:03,588
Not I say that it won't happen
anything among us.

105
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:17,644
Dra. He/she looks... 

106
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:22,607
That is, Dra. Mirabella Stones.

107
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:29,531
No!

108
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:42,502
Don't make fun, Miranda told me that
it had left a bad relationship

109
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:44,713
And nobody has never had gender
when leaving this way a relationship.

110
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:49,468
" We go very quick, I don't feel well"

111
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:53,555
If somebody wants to make it
with you, he/she will simply make it.

112
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:57,726
- The rest is empty data.
- That everything is, does one scheme?

113
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,728
No, it schemes it... 

114
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:03,482
Clear, the wall has a connection.

115
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:05,657
I believe that it will be my death.

116
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:09,738
We go, cheer up, brother.
He/she looks at the kind side.

117
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:13,554
Although you went to a tropical island,

118
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:17,148
the 34 girls that are in the list.

119
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:20,707
they would go in jetskis to celebrate with you.

120
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:26,505
I don't like it, I don't want another
women, I want Miranda.

121
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:31,468
I have behaved well, it was something strange
at the beginning but I followed the current

122
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,763
sabotie the wedding, I lost the I deposit.
I played with the feelings of people

123
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:39,726
including me to myself and although
I don't care I, now if I care.

124
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:43,647
I found somebody that plays my heart.

125
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:46,650
And if they believe that the prediction... 

126
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:51,655
- The love is sometimes but strong... 
- No! It is not it!

127
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:04,751
I was so proud when
you buried the list in the patio.

128
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:10,590
Horoscopios, psychic, tarot letters,
attractions that predict the end.

129
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:13,635
Why should they know everything?

130
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:18,598
It is a good point, Sr. he/she remembers when
did he/she say that it schemes it a mystery it was?

131
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,483
It can have some flaw or something.

132
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:26,481
It is not of it schemes it, it is the progress,
he/she cannot make anything in this respect.

133
00:09:27,607 --> 00:09:30,527
To the science and the logic
they don't care if we die.

134
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,779
Excuse.

135
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,496
My God, the solution was
before our the whole time

136
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:42,587
Which is it?

137
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:45,625
Sucks, God that good.

138
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:49,629
The sex is work,
"Will he/she be having a good time?"

139
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:51,631
and to think of their feelings

140
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:56,511
but with the alone suck you throw
and from time to time you play him/her

141
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:58,520
the nape if you believe that you this
putting lazy.

142
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:02,684
Seriously, if somebody offered a buffet
of coitus or a suck in a stick

143
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:04,603
he/she would take the suck.

144
00:10:04,644 --> 00:10:06,563
They are sick.

145
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,609
I gave the heart to Miranda,
I want to have it in my arms

146
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:16,490
and to make him/her love feeling their to breathe.
Seriously you do believe that it would suck it to me?

147
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:20,118
Srta Nell has just put to sleep

148
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:23,705
to an entire fraternity in Ash-tree.

149
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,549
Death Nell? What is that they make another time?

150
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:31,630
It is the system, when a murderer in series
he/she has but of 10 you kill, they call each other.

151
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:33,673
I receive details.

152
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,721
seemingly it was the same one
fraternity that was forgiven

153
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:42,641
to sell the violation drug.

154
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,736
She put their own drug in the cake.

155
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:59,574
Does that entertain you Roderick?

156
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:02,577
I am revising my messages,
know-it-all schemes it this for

157
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:03,662
to receive another blow.

158
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:09,543
They love the concepts, the drawings.
They will publish it!

159
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:12,629
I owe you so much Rod.

160
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:16,717
Not there is way that we don't take place today,
I will be in your house at 8 o'clock.

161
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:21,430
It lists for the action.
I love you a lot.

162
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:28,645
- He/she is a very fortunate man... 
- It is for their voice!

163
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:33,483
Not you need the list, she doesn't think of you... 

164
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:40,615
I am for sure you sew very
important tonight they happened

165
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:44,619
Your penis in its vagina won't belong one to them.

166
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,582
But that the passes very well.

167
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:53,587
I would like to stay to talk but
I have an appointment with a lady.

168
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,641
Not I believe that he/she has seen it neither he/she undresses.

169
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,611
- Hello.
- Author.

170
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:19,738
Thank you that you/they eat excrement.

171
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:25,494
Lament so much to arrive late is
that it was a madness but I told them

172
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:27,746
to all that we would see them in the bar,
I invite, for the first time.

173
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:31,500
I thought that alone we would be
both, I made pasta

174
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:40,509
It is very sweet but we have to leave,
we are of celebration, my brother

175
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,470
and two Jessicas is already there
but it is not the great thing.

176
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,514
- He/she listens.
- Relax you.

177
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:48,517
Let us have a private party.

178
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:51,686
I thought that we had already overcome this.

179
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,608
No?

180
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:02,614
Miranda, you that you said that not
you were attracted to my but

181
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,742
that was before the trip,
before it lowered

182
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:07,619
the program of graphics to your laptop.

183
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:12,624
Why it is that the men believe that
the women are as thermometers

184
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:18,505
giants? every time that you/they make something
good for them, they put on but red

185
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,718
and but red and but and when we arrive
to the end, we have that follar.

186
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,553
That is not amusing!

187
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:27,556
- Shit.
- I sit down it.

188
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:31,518
Alone I will clean it.

189
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:37,524
Which are the words
that but they scare?

190
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,693
- " Let us be single friends"
- " Let us be single friends"

191
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,493
It is like a bad comedy.

192
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:50,746
Alone that... 

193
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,752
You know the difficult thing that it was for my to make
a true friend in the city?

194
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:01,673
He/she would die for you.

195
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:07,471
To who you believe that I dedicate him/her my book?
to my crazy parents?

196
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,559
To Roderick Blank, my friend.

197
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,569
Good celebration.

198
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,500
My God.

199
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,586
Shit that ugly celebration.

200
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:44,466
Your girlfriend finds out that her book
it will be published and...  it is terrible.

201
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:49,513
Not he/she was my girlfriend.

202
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:54,684
We are satisfied that the death
alone it has been an accident.

203
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,727
Alone?

204
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,647
Excuse, official wanted to give to Sr. Blank

205
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:00,607
the opportunity to say goodbye to their girlfriend

206
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,693
Not it is my...  can I be to alone with her?

207
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,495
My beautiful Miranda.

208
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:19,668
I never wanted this, alone he/she wanted.

209
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,590
They said that we would be never together.

210
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:31,513
But we will be the last in laughing.

211
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,724
Truth, love?

212
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:49,531
Now that I think it, maybe
that was not something good.

213
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,743
Him you my lover, this is sad.

214
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,663
It is desperate and disgusting.

215
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:03,545
But be like be, we have
that to leave the list.

216
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:08,550
To face to it schemes it, to the destination.

217
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,555
Stop soldier, we go you stop.

218
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,474
Allow it to leave, Sr. Blank.

219
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,601
This well, allow it to leave.

220
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:06,733
Poor person sweet man.
Poor person comely sweet man.

221
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:46,481
Pardon, believe me me also
he/she hoped it is a dream.

222
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,652
If it serves them as something my story
he/she has a satisfactory end.

223
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,532
But this it is not,
alone it is the number 67

224
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,708
My name?

225
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,547
4, 3, 2, 1.

226
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,674
New happy year!

227
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:07,708
- Nobody congratulates you.
- Thank You, Roderick Blank.

228
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:11,650
- Esther Fenchel.
- Your friends call you Terry.

229
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,529
No, but it is curious because
it is my husband's name, Terry.

230
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,532
Linda tie.

231
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:24,538
He/she leaves the bottle.

232
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,667
Gentlemen, The killer.

233
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,673
The prototype not!

234
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:39,553
To eat and to die from hunger.
To eat and to die from hunger

235
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:44,725
they asked me me to take a time
to take for a while away from all.

236
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,731
But there was not escape, notice several names
French and Italian in the list

237
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:55,575
so I thought of Europe, to listen
of the women you magnify

238
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,656
my friends concluded that he/she would have
the best vacations in my life.

239
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:02,451
I am glad them to enjoy it.

240
00:20:22,637 --> 00:20:26,683
Good night, you have that follarme,
so they come to make it.

241
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,604
Without dinner, it grabs pencil,
I will give you the address.

242
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:43,617
Hello? if, badge,
it was a joke, I sit down it.

243
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:46,495
- Your he/she suckles I answer?
- If.

244
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,497
- Serious?
- If.

245
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,625
I sit down it a lot.
Why do you laugh?

246
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,671
In my own way he/she attempts
to fight against the list.

247
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:01,468
but once but the list
wise but that me.

248
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:06,515
because he/she will know a woman
that it would solve all my problems.

249
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:10,477
- Hope?
- It was.

250
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,686
Roderick?

251
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:21,530
I have attempted per years that my mother
get up, your you made it in 5 seconds.

252
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,658
Tell me your poison.

253
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:28,703
Hope Hartlight was the author of the book
of self-help but sold.

254
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:33,542
I found it warm, passionate
and a little old.

255
00:21:33,577 --> 00:21:35,676
So I was not ataido to her.

256
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,673
But I won't get rid of making it
with her, so it passes their surprise

257
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:44,511
invite it to another appointment, imagining that
possibly we would have sex.

258
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,595
and it could continue ahead.

259
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,557
But it happened something... 

260
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,644
Hope listens to myself, it guides me.

261
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,147
Hope helps myself with its literature,

262
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:59,609
we passed the time playing chess.

263
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,615
As for my friends,
what do they believe?

264
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,703
Hope was the mother nature
that he/she came to save their souls.

265
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,580
If you allow it to go, I will bring it.

266
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:17,502
You seem me of person's type that
he/she makes fun of the anniversary of one month.

267
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,713
You have changed me.

268
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,591
You cured me.

269
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,474
It is very pretty what you said.

270
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,520
Do you know? I have that autografiar
books in Vemont

271
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:40,567
I believe that you should go with me,
they have a grandiose hotel.

272
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,489
We can sleep until late,
when he/she doesn't work, clear.

273
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:50,744
You could stay there and to make all that that
want, until walking nude in the patio.

274
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:58,668
Hope didn't disappear amid
the dinner, takes him/her a couple of weeks.

275
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,713
How it is that the answer to
my problems are not enough?

276
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,634
If my friend had been with Hope,
I had been proud of the one.

277
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,762
I suppose that that it is the problem,
proud but not jealous.

278
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,641
And a man prefers to have the jealousies
of somebody before their respect.

279
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,644
I hate to have said that.

280
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,651
Maybe hope was not the but
good with the one that you were.

281
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,612
But it was so proud of you

282
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,490
The married ones are taking
a lot of fever for that reason.

283
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,577
It seems that you broke the rule
of the woman of but of 35.

284
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,539
I thought that we would not make an intervention.

285
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,667
Not we would use that word
but undoubtedly it is it.

286
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,669
This well.

287
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,549
They continue thinking that there out
this the suitable girl for the one?

288
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:50,637
News of last minute, the woman
well-known with Death Nell, accent its

289
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,557
driver's license in the one
place of their last attack.

290
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,728
It is what the authorities waited

291
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:02,733
the whole year and we have the sole right.

292
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:07,695
Chuck chuck DJ Harry Hunt during

293
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:12,617
a commercial of their morning program.

294
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:14,661
I appreciate what you/they said... 

295
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,498
Hello?

296
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,502
Go up him/her, seriously they caught
to that satanic woman?

297
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,629
Not and it is said, fighter of the freedom.

298
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,760
Allow me to guess, he/she doesn't call himself Death Nell.

299
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,679
That such an intervention.

300
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,681
The name is Gillian Of Raisx.

301
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:40,687
Death Nell is Gillian Of Raisx

302
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:47,486
Gillian Of Raisx, x is silent
it was a name that it was I famliliar.

303
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:49,738
and when that happened it was because... 

304
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,535
Well, this not this happening.

305
00:24:55,577 --> 00:25:01,500
You what you/they are thinking, had
memorized the last name of the list

306
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:06,505
because nobody wants to think
in the last name, because

307
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,673
that means that... 

308
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,636
What did you tell him/her?
To where it was?

309
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,734
- Fred.
- It is something comic.

310
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,736
Not it is as if it was the next one.

311
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,739
Maybe be not the next one
but if the last.

312
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:36,576
Another woman should have in the one
planet that he/she calls himself as her.

313
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,662
Their last name also
with a silent x?

314
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:43,583
Tanquilizate, that Gillian Of Raisx
he/she can that it is not Gillian Of Raisx.

315
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:48,588
As you can see the you schemes
this bringing near to Death Nell.

316
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,676
At the beginning it didn't leave but... 

317
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:03,562
But coordinated, in this radio he/she would say
that inside a couple of weeks

318
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,689
the oracle will tell us where
Gillian Of Raisx stayed

319
00:26:05,724 --> 00:26:09,651
in the precise moment of
their demurrage, I assume that

320
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,737
he/she could stop to have sex with

321
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,495
- Twenty.
- Twenty.

322
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,615
women in next 2 weeks.

323
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,535
I have made it with 3 women
in all my life,

324
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,496
any if they don't count paying hence.

325
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,707
We can tell him/her that he/she doesn't have sex.

326
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,501
but he/she has to go but far from that now.

327
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,547
He/she has to take their mind for another route.

328
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,681
Read the book that he/she always wanted.

329
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,594
I see the models of airplanes like... 

330
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,638
It is grandiose but I have
that to return to the suck.

331
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,640
Fred, you don't help.

332
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,642
Does he like the bicycle?

333
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:48,482
Not I can believe that they are you are
my conversations now.

334
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,734
This tormented, give him/her one.

335
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,487
What? ah, if.

336
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,496
The mentioned oracle,

337
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,701
sometimes wandered in capturing criminals

338
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:04,706
it has solved the mysteries but
big of our culture.

339
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,502
and I believe that if we can him/her
to give one of those.

340
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:09,503
Anyone?

341
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,679
Who do kill Nicole Simpson?

342
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,509
- These joking.
- It is this way, allow me to see.

343
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,469
Who do shoot JFK?

344
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,679
He/she requests other, that taking like 20 minutes.

345
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,641
- How many planets do they have life?
- Eleven.

346
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,601
Eleven, that everything is?

347
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,645
How many but he/she wanted?

348
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,564
- Does God exist?
- Already coarse.

349
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,607
Alone one.

350
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,491
Please, they are bad.

351
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,486
Not he/she wants to be in THE the weekend.

352
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,529
Enough.

353
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:47,624
There are 20 shields between her and you.
Be conservative, don't use none

354
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,627
before catching it.

355
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,505
And remember... 

356
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,719
- A new existence Kingdom.
- Existence.

357
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,638
Without sex... 

358
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:03,724
Not there is death.

359
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,518
Good luck

360
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,653
If!

361
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:06,661
I never believed that the letters of
their magazine was true.

362
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,497
Up to now.

363
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:15,504
My best friend was in bicycle
when key in a well.

364
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:20,112
Fortunately for my friend,
a bus in in route to a camp

365
00:29:20,147 --> 00:29:24,554
religious stopped to make
what says the Bible and to help him.

366
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:27,557
They cleaned it and they put it
in the corridor of the bus.

367
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,601
He/she thought that they will help him.

368
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,604
In place they were helped themselves.

369
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:36,608
Among the girls of the bus they had
conversed about not having

370
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,486
lost their virginity

371
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:44,115
my friend's appearance in the highway
it was taken as a sign.

372
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:48,662
A pact was made, all would lose
the virginity and the one was the elect.

373
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:53,542
All virgins, all of 18.

374
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:59,589
There was 19 18 year-old cicas,
all virgins and in uniform.

375
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,468
They made a raffle and the
first were Mona Farlow.

376
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,721
Carajo.

377
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,641
Carajo!

378
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,703
One day that my friend never forgot was.

379
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,540
Some change before sending it?

380
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,545
I am curious,
was there a lot of blood?

381
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,676
That it cares, go the perversion
favorite of the man.

382
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:47,637
- You can die now.
- That is the problem.

383
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,735
Did I tell them the good news?
I will marry.

384
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,614
The fortunate one is Ethel Walters,
I hope they arrive to the wedding.

385
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,533
Do we know it?

386
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,661
Not him you, I have to put on
in contact with her immediately.

387
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,538
Are they made well-known the name?

388
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,749
Maybe you should go to bed.

389
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,551
Where was the driver?

390
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:24,758
it can be that they have been in another bus
but they could not have been alone.

391
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:29,471
The driver, doesn't believe recor... 

392
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,516
The driver.

393
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,603
There is here inside a lot of action,
I want some that.

394
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:40,565
Now relax you, the blanquitas
they won't tell to anybody.

395
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,658
Not you can go to bed with me.

396
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:54,496
Roderick, I am Trixie,
I won't violate you, that knows it.

397
00:31:54,531 --> 00:31:55,462
Leave me alone.

398
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,623
Salt, drinks big.

399
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,460
I have something for you, soon.

400
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,630
Angers to Australia, your flight comes out in
the morning, it begins to pack.

401
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:07,683
Not I can escape,
even so I would be.

402
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:12,472
I was in internet the whole night
I found another Gillian Of Raisx

403
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:15,475
- But their last name not... 
- If, with a silent x.

404
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,729
He/she is a biologist marima of Sidney.

405
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,694
Which is the tusk in the picture?

406
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,532
He/she has big bones and a great one
appetite for the life, imbecile.

407
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,499
What is that in their face?

408
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,746
An eruption for its
exploration in the reef.

409
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:41,460
For heaven's sake, Roderick, you prefer to die
that to make it with a fat.

410
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,462
with a slight skin condition.

411
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:46,673
Not it is so slight.

412
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,676
I am for sure... 

413
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:54,556
Buy you books for the airplane,
underline good conversations

414
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:57,559
If you won't seduce her... 

415
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,603
If I like dolphins.

416
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,569
Without caring what happens,
thank you to be with me.

417
00:33:07,604 --> 00:33:08,653
You are good friend.

418
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,701
- Is it good to not be lesbian?
- Send me a postcard.

419
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,580
With a koala in her.

420
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,547
Please you don't kill me.

421
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,718
If that wants, he/she listens, the oracle

422
00:34:12,753 --> 00:34:16,436
it completed, we have confirmation

423
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:20,684
that Death Nell will be here
in the hotel Maitre.

424
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:25,605
I am in their room, not this here
in this precise moment but

425
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:29,651
their things if they are, friends.
I have chills.

426
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:35,449
Their room, is the day of the innocent ones?

427
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,618
They are 12: 10 am officially
second of April.

428
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:44,583
If, Roderick, is new plans for today.

429
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,628
This is incredible.

430
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,715
Not they know like it has been.

431
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:58,513
I found the truth of truths
and it is not suckled neither straws.

432
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,601
He/she is former, former fiancés.

433
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:07,647
He/she listens, it revises the names in the list
Does some name appear twice?

434
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,651
No, then you don't tell me that never

435
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:15,530
you joined with a former one it stops you already know... 

436
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,698
Memory?

437
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,536
You are right, him toward with them
and then they returned for navidad.

438
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:26,666
And whenever it traveled to San Louis,
I always stopped in Diana Scott.

439
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:31,671
We will get you reelection sex,
I speak to you of wild sex.

440
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:35,717
He/she returns to Hope, the number 80, that that
they had it was real, she accepted you.

441
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:40,514
If, Hope, I have had so much women
interesting in my life that never

442
00:35:40,549 --> 00:35:42,516
I was worthy of them.

443
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:46,686
Not listen to Beta, the one hates
the erections and the amusement.

444
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:50,690
What you have to make is
to find that school bus

445
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:54,736
and to join with the Bible rats
of the number 81 up to 99.

446
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:59,491
- Maybe to pass at 84 o'clock and alone... 
- Mr.?

447
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,537
If, over there.

448
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:08,542
Make one of them to be changed
the name to Gillian Of Raisx.

449
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,751
Hold.

450
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:17,509
The theories in the table are good but
calm, Gillian arrived at the hotel

451
00:36:17,544 --> 00:36:22,556
in any moment but us
we don't believe in trials or arrests

452
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:28,645
so I want you to wait and not
leave your house.

453
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,564
This well.

454
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:34,443
- I will call you then.
- Here I will be, thank you.

455
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:54,731
Seriously they did think that I would survive easy?
Did they want him to be this way?

456
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,652
You that I promised them an end
satisfactory but there was not

457
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:02,447
I triumph from return to Fiona, Hope or nobody but.

458
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:05,665
Not I will pursue a taxi
neither I will stop a wedding.

459
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,538
Neither there will be a reconciliation
in a train platform.

460
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,582
Neither neither I will travel to Australia.

461
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,468
To escape to the sins

462
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,673
of April 2 it would feel very bad.

463
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:24,594
I suppose that my true destination
it was in a hotel in the center.

464
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:28,557
It will go out with a lady called Death.

465
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,685
Any God or it schemes I could survive now.

466
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:36,440
And that felt well.

467
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,658
If you live with the sword
you die for the sword.

468
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:51,621
A sexual remaining position
Karmasutra"

469
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,543
The end comes closer.

470
00:38:56,578 --> 00:38:58,503
And to arrive is the end.

471
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,547
All Fred revises.

472
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:06,470
My name is commanding Delta,
alone they enter, move.

473
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:16,688
Excuse, Srta. Death, Nell.
Do You Prefer Gillian?

474
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:19,524
I am no longer you afraid.

475
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,133
Death Nell this completed one.

476
00:39:24,168 --> 00:39:26,656
You look at it, he/she doesn't know that to make.

477
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,539
To where you go? he/she returns.

478
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:54,476
You caused a shock there out.
Did you love me something?

479
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:56,561
No, me... 

480
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:03,652
Hello.

481
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:10,617
There are agents away from your hotel
and in your room.

482
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:13,620
Thank you.

483
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:18,625
- Do you know that I don't sin truth?
- If.

484
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:24,506
Can I accompany?

485
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:47,571
Go.

486
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,532
This place is incredible.

487
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,535
I never heard of this place.

488
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,707
I discovered it the other night, there is not
many places here that they open up so late.

489
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:03,628
You know... ?

490
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:05,547
- I sit down it.
- Your dilo.

491
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:06,590
No, your.

492
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:10,510
This is strange for my.

493
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:13,513
He/she had never had a volunteer.

494
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:16,641
Some would make what is to have sex.

495
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:31,698
This has flavor to grape.

496
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:40,457
If you know that I cannot guarantee
when or if you woke up.

497
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,460
If, I understand.

498
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:53,678
It bothers you if I ask you,
tell me if it is very personal.

499
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:57,557
How did you arrive here?

500
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,643
In a sense but extensive.

501
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:04,648
Not it is as if he/she left it
to say to somebody or something like that.

502
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:09,611
Not him you... 

503
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:16,493
Not I will talk about my childhood
because that is not... 

504
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,622
My childhood was not better or worse
that the one of anyone.

505
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,710
Maybe a worse little bit but escape

506
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:32,509
There study poetry and chemistry, obviously
I am better mixing that speaking.

507
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:35,554
Not say that, I am enjoying it.

508
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,478
You are right, it is grandiose.

509
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:47,566
Alone I have read the things that came out in those
newspapers after the incidents

510
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,651
but what what you painted was
after the number 7?

511
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:54,698
My ecstasy, your alienation
it is not anything of tolerating.

512
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,492
It is good.

513
00:42:57,743 --> 00:43:01,580
Where was it? clear, before

514
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:04,666
to be able to graduate fall in love.

515
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:11,673
My husband was all it that you
it supposes that a girl wants.

516
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:18,472
I was their princess, the era
my charming prince.

517
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,558
Can I prove your food?

518
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,519
I change you for that tomato.

519
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:34,654
Not you have to continue if you don't want.

520
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:41,536
To tell the truth, it feels well
decil the bad thing aloud.

521
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:46,500
But when I said that it was
their princess.

522
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,668
Not it was mataforico.

523
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:54,508
Every week a new disguise
of princess and a wig.

524
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:57,636
In that way it is better,
as the he/she said it.

525
00:43:57,761 --> 00:44:01,723
At the beginning it was amusing
but later it was no longer it.

526
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,684
It became rude one day... 

527
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:21,451
- Do I hit you?
- No.

528
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:26,707
You know, I put to 20 men in coma
when you put that punishment class

529
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,668
the short answer is if.

530
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:35,465
It hit me and toward
all that was happened.

531
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:39,636
But anything above the neck,
the princess and the pirate.

532
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:44,599
The princess and the Viking,
the princess and the magician.

533
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:49,521
Occasionally it mixed it and we made
"The music's sound"

534
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:55,485
it could not be a crime,
the era my husband.

535
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:58,530
I didn't complain neither toward questions.

536
00:44:58,572 --> 00:45:02,743
but if somebody wanted to the
main character with ashtray

537
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:06,496
it was very good.

538
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:12,627
But I improve my posia, he/she gave me
much material to work.

539
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:15,756
You are good listening, seriously.

540
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:21,762
Then I arrive San Valentine's day.

541
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:28,643
Something came out good, my situation without
it thrills, my inability of changing.

542
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:31,646
but undoubtedly all he/she will write it.

543
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:35,734
And later... 

544
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,471
Should I have been happy not?

545
00:45:57,506 --> 00:46:00,467
They were about everything but
they could not wake up,

546
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:02,573
they thought that it was in coma.

547
00:46:02,608 --> 00:46:04,638
And there it was when I had the vision.

548
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:28,495
Carajo.

549
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:30,706
Carajo.

550
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:38,546
Do you know? I like to think that I put something

551
00:46:38,581 --> 00:46:41,591
interesting there out in the atmosphere.

552
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:49,683
The idea of a capable woman
of humiliating a man.

553
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:54,688
to be bad or without some reason.

554
00:46:57,566 --> 00:47:02,696
Good, the women have to fight
day and night with the impositions

555
00:47:02,738 --> 00:47:06,721
of the man forever so

556
00:47:06,756 --> 00:47:10,704
I planned to take control for a while.

557
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:14,541
I suppose.

558
00:47:15,584 --> 00:47:18,587
It is this way as I rationalize it.

559
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:20,714
I left.

560
00:47:20,756 --> 00:47:23,675
This well, we all are you leave.

561
00:47:25,594 --> 00:47:27,644
They are single games, names.

562
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,725
To who loved, to
who really loved.

563
00:47:33,477 --> 00:47:37,522
Did you give the heart?
Did they break yours?

564
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:41,568
Somehow... 

565
00:47:42,486 --> 00:47:46,573
he/she leaves you exhausted.

566
00:47:52,496 --> 00:47:55,499
I always like that word.

567
00:47:58,627 --> 00:48:05,467
Taciturn, dissipated, not well wornout,
those they are good.

568
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:10,680
But fatigue sounds what is.

569
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,646
And that better cure that to sleep?
To sleep a lot.

570
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:24,611
I pay, I insist.

571
00:48:27,656 --> 00:48:28,740
Roderick.

572
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:36,456
Would you care it?

573
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:40,502
You want him to take two for
if the first don't work?

574
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:47,718
Alone he/she thought that since we are together.

575
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:52,639
While I put one in your mouth your... 

576
00:48:57,686 --> 00:49:00,522
These sure one?

577
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:01,690
If.

578
00:49:02,524 --> 00:49:04,651
Not I will lie, I am flattered.

579
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,572
You would should.

580
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:12,451
Do we go to my room?

581
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:14,745
Not to that.

582
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:18,498
A different one.

583
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:22,627
If.

584
00:50:06,588 --> 00:50:10,550
So that is everything,
the end of my history.

585
00:50:10,592 --> 00:50:12,552
Good, of one of my histories.

586
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:16,723
He/she suckles, potato, I found a totato
for the picnic.

587
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:21,561
Seriously you are the farmer.

588
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:25,732
I believe that we already know that
there will be for the picnic.

589
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:29,569
Totate soup.
What do you find?

590
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:33,615
The history of like I wised up,
as I knew my wife.

591
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:40,622
As I learned that sometimes the answers
they are disguised questions.

592
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:46,545
The list becomes trained that the one
who that, where and when

593
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,588
it is never as important as the because

594
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:50,716
and the because neither it is so important.

595
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:28,712
If everything is a game, sometimes
the best thing that can make it is

596
00:51:28,754 --> 00:51:30,714
to press the reseteo button.

597
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:43,643
For the first time in my life I am me

598
00:51:43,685 --> 00:51:46,688
treatment of adding him/her the mature being

599
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:51,610
contentment, happy,
for the time being that this well.

600
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:58,492
The life resembles the death
they receive all like it or not.

601
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:04,623
But at the end, honestly
To who he cares a carajo?
