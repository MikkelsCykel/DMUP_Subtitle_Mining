00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,249
So, Nick...

2
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,169
...this is it?

3
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,754
As promised.

4
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,466
Let’s do it.

5
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,094
I have a plane to catch.

6
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,410
You know, Sonny...

7
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,414
...you're wrong about him.
He's clean, man.

8
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,167
We're about to find out.

9
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:22,226
Put your guns down.

10
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,525
Hello, Sascha.

11
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,028
I'm Sonny Ekvall.

12
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,572
You work for me.

13
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,119
Nicholas, what is all this?

14
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,205
Caught a little heat.

15
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,124
One of our guys
is double-dealing with the Feds.

16
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,418
It's no big deal.
Just procedure.

17
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,879
- A polygraph.
- Nick was against this.

18
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,631
I see.

19
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,717
He says you are one of my family.

20
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,221
But he always did bring home strays.

21
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,057
That is why I am here.

22
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,520
Are you friend or foe?

23
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,230
I'm a friend.

24
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,069
Sascha Petrosevitch.

25
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,904
You are Russian.

26
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,199
Yeah, I'm Russian.
You got a problem with that?

27
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,202
I am an equal opportunities employer.

28
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,873
As long as you are working the scene
making me money...

29
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,040
...what do I care?

30
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:32,880
Who did you work for before
you landed in my lap?

31
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,299
Me.

32
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,927
- Doing what?
- I ran a highland crew...

33
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,972
...got popped,
did a nickel in Angola.

34
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,766
Just trying to get into
something simple.

35
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:49,897
I run the biggest crime syndicate
from Eastern Europe...

36
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,316
...to the Pacific Rim.

37
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,195
- That is simple?
- Cars are simple.

38
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,077
You work for any
law enforcement agencies?

39
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,372
Sometimes I work for the CIA,
the KGB...

40
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:12,669
...the U.S. Marshals, when I got a little
bit of spare time...

41
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,465
...I do a little something
for the Eastern Stasi.

42
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,310
You left out the FBI.

43
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:33,815
- Are you FBI?
- I boost cars. That's all.

44
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:39,363
I am a soldier trained in the art
of killing, not interrogation.

45
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,574
Nick likes you.
He's a good boy.

46
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:47,037
He's like a little brother to me.
So for him, I make an exception.

47
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,748
But now, my patience is at the end.

48
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,961
Are you FBI?

49
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,467
No.

50
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:14,523
Welcome to my family, Sascha.

51
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,317
I told you.

52
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,404
Make sure the boat leaves tonight.

53
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,434
It’s time, man.

54
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:54,271
- Time for what?
- To take that ring off.

55
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,900
She's a memory, Sasch.

56
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,611
You felt the loss.

57
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,487
Cried the tears.

58
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,781
There's nothing more to do, man.

59
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,242
I just can't let her go.

60
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,788
I respect that.

61
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,458
I feel that.

62
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,460
Anyway...

63
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,421
...I got a job.

64
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,465
You want it?

65
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,675
Yeah.

66
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:49,368
Yo, Sasch, stop playing!
Stop driving so fast!

67
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,411
Come on! Watch this!

68
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,095
Watch the forklift!

69
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,976
- Yeah, you like that.
- No, I don't like this.

70
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,447
Oh, my God.

71
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,767
I'm sorry about
what went down tonight.

72
00:07:55,934 --> 00:08:00,439
I told Sonny you was one of us,
but he runs the show his way.

73
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:03,859
- What's a Blue Book on these wheels?
- About 198 grand.

74
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:08,113
- That makes my 5% worth what?
- 9600. Give or take.

75
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,074
I'll take half now,
half when I deliver, right?

76
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,702
You'll get it when we get there.

77
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,167
Half now, Nicholas,
or we give this back.

78
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,005
- How long we known each other?
- Two and a half years.

79
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,132
So for about two...

80
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,427
...two and a half years...

81
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:33,722
...I’ve been asking you
to call me Nick.

82
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,434
- I like Nicholas, all right?
- No, it’s not all right.

83
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:46,151
It’s all right. Put a little thug in it.
Maybe you'll get your money.

84
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,320
I love Nicholas, all right?

85
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,489
- Was that good?
- No, check it out.

86
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,823
Read my lips.

87
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,618
- All right.
- All right.

88
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,787
- How was that?
- See how I'm doing that?

89
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,665
All right. See what I'm getting at?

90
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,416
I think...

91
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,544
That’s tough for me.

92
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,547
You whiter than I thought.

93
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,439
- Stop playing.
- I'm a bad man, you know that.

94
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,738
Stop the car!

95
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,129
I'm gonna kick your ass one day.

96
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,673
What are you guys doing?
Back to work!

97
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:53,010
We're putting these cars
on the road in 37 minutes.

98
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:56,054
- Where's my money?
- Hey, I'm good for it.

99
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,891
- You know me.
- And you know me.

100
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:03,812
Now, I want my 9600 or I'm gonna
take this big goddamn hammer...

101
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,440
- Hey, come on.
...and have some fun.

102
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,066
Hey, Sasch. Sasch.

103
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:13,071
- You know you're crazy, right?
- Cuckoo crazy.

104
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,870
- You expecting somebody?
- No.

105
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,248
Get this car out of here.

106
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:39,848
- Nicholas Frazier?
- Who wants to know?

107
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,353
Special Agent Williams.
I'm with the FBI.

108
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,652
Maybe you've heard of us?

109
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,947
Yeah, I've heard of you.

110
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:59,868
That’s no way to start.
Put your guns down. Let’s talk.

111
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,121
I don't talk to pigs without my lawyer.

112
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,874
I'm a lawyer.
You want my advice?

113
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:10,337
Put the guns down. I'm looking
to bring down Sonny Ekvall.

114
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:14,007
You wanna negotiate?
I'll cut you a sweet deal.

115
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,385
Witness protection.
No time served.

116
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,096
Ekvall's not for sale.

117
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,808
You ever done hard time, Nick?

118
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,894
Ever been somebody's bitch?

119
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:32,651
You got big balls for a woman,
you know that?

120
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:37,281
And you've got exactly five
seconds to put the guns down.

121
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:41,743
Otherwise, people are gonna die.
You want that on your conscience?

122
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,497
- Nobody's gotta die tonight.
- I'm not talking to you!

123
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,125
That’s one, Nick.

124
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,380
- You know, Sonny has a rule.
- What’s that?

125
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,257
That’s two, Nick.

126
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,092
Three!

127
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,261
Nobody gets taken alive.

128
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,722
- Four!
- That’s a bad rule, man.

129
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,933
Five!
Put the goddamn guns down, now!

130
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,604
- Put the gun down, man.
- It’s a nice night to die.

131
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:54,501
BP's dropping fast.
We gotta get this guy out of flat line!

132
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,879
He's going into cardiac arrest!

133
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,380
Clear!

134
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,218
Clear!

135
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,014
One, two, three!

136
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:12,227
One, two, three, four, five!

137
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,273
One, two, three, four, five!

138
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,253
We got a pulse!

139
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:20,796
I can't believe I ended up in this
situation. This is bullshit.

140
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,325
My friend.

141
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,871
Sasch?
How you been, man?

142
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:58,834
- I've been better. How you feel?
- It’s like I'm seeing a ghost.

143
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,837
Give me some love, man!

144
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:06,091
- Thought you was dead.
- For a while, but I'm back.

145
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,344
I'm sorry about what happened
in the warehouse.

146
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,513
I lost it. I went ballistic.

147
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,558
Forget it.
Where'd you come from?

148
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,270
They sent me down from
the SHU, Pelican Bay.

149
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:21,106
- What about you?
- Infirmary, San Quentin.

150
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:24,860
- Got another five years in this rat hole.
- I got two.

151
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,822
Well, are we all right?
Or we got issues?

152
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,909
- What’re you talking about?
- You might be pissed off.

153
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:35,287
I don't wanna spend
the next five years...

154
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:39,208
...wondering if my nigger
want to slit me from ear to ear.

155
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,751
You're my man.

156
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:44,963
When you get inside, you're gonna
have issues. They won't be with me.

157
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,673
You all right?

158
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:51,178
I'll see you on the inside.

159
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,444
- What are you packing?
- It’s my leg.

160
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,700
I'm gonna ask again.
What are you packing?

161
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,202
This.

162
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,500
You wanna play rough?
I can play rough.

163
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,336
Sorry, I'm not into men.

164
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,866
You don't know who I am?

165
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,909
Just doing my job, boss.

166
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:00,789
- You gonna like this.
- That’s enough.

167
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:03,917
You gonna learn to respect me.

168
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,297
My kids hit harder than that.

169
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,215
Chump.

170
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:29,318
What you bringing
into my island, ese?

171
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,945
My knee. It’s titanium.

172
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,617
- Which one?
- Left.

173
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,932
You got a hard head, homeboy.

174
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:04,728
Do yourself a favour.
Keep it on your shoulders.

175
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,858
All right. Back to work.

176
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:13,779
The attorney general
and Federal Bureau of Prisons...

177
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:17,783
...welcome you to the U.S. Federal
Penitentiary at Alcatraz.

178
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,328
Mr. Hubbard, Robert Kennedy
closed Alcatraz in 1963...

179
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,415
...claiming it was
cruel and inhumane...

180
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:29,503
Actually, he closed it in June of '62.
What’s your question?

181
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,882
Some say the new Alcatraz is a step
back in criminal warehousing...

182
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:38,345
...especially now with the inauguration
of your new execution chamber.

183
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,680
How do you respond?

184
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:43,392
Our society has become
more violent and more corrupt.

185
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,521
One out of every 30 men
in the United States is...

186
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:51,733
- What’s the word I'm looking for?
- Criminally challenged.

187
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:56,238
"Criminally challenged."
That’s the catch phrase now.

188
00:19:56,446 --> 00:20:01,827
- You're not answering the question.
- I think we have a generational gap.

189
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:05,664
Perhaps my younger associate
can help clear things up.

190
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,584
Give them a good sound bite, Donny.

191
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:13,964
Alcatraz is a bad place
for bad people.

192
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:17,634
If there's any discomfort here,
that’s how it should be.

193
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,692
Fresh meat, dog!

194
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:03,514
Welcome to la Isla de los Alcatraces.

195
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,225
The Island of Pelicans.

196
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:11,980
You've been transferred here as part
of a work program to retrofit my island.

197
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:16,527
But your free time will be spent
in a six-by-nine-foot cell.

198
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,028
I urge you:

199
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:22,407
Unplug. Kick your feet up.

200
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:27,871
You will leave a big chunk
of your lives here.

201
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:31,166
MI nombre es Juan Ruiz Escarzaga.

202
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:36,672
My first summertime job was walking
a super-maximum tier 30 years ago.

203
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,299
I walked it for over 15 years.

204
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:44,221
Been spit on, stabbed, burned.

205
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:48,267
And I'm still standing.

206
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,352
You think you're hard.

207
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,522
I'm harder.

208
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,069
You think you're mean.

209
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,446
I'm meaner.

210
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,991
Alcatraz es ml casa.

211
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:07,786
You are my guest.
I expect you to act like one.

212
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,872
Son of a bitch!

213
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:14,084
- What hole are you on, Little Joe?
- Seventeen.

214
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:16,670
How you hitting it?

215
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:23,635
Like a mother. Just can't putt.

216
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:29,391
Little Joe here has a constructive
way of passing his free time.

217
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:33,812
I suggest you find something
of the same. Be creative.

218
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:39,026
Remember, this is the first day
of the rest of your life.

219
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,695
Ain't that right, Twitch?

220
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:46,867
Same old, same old, man.

221
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:49,369
Get a new rap, comprende?

222
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,917
I like my rap.

223
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,336
And here's the end of it.

224
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,715
You got two llbros in your bundle.

225
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:06,803
The rules and regs,
and the King James Bible.

226
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,057
I highly recommend
you read them both.

227
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:16,647
Now for those stupid enough
to think about escaping, go ahead.

228
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,983
Climb the razor wire.
Do the breaststroke.

229
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,777
Freeze your ass off.

230
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:26,615
If the bay doesn't kill you,
we'll pick you up in a Zodiac...

231
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:29,159
...and add five years
to your sentence.

232
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,207
There's only one way
off this rock, homeys.

233
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:38,418
And that key is under my pillow.

234
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:45,425
I'm a fair man. You come to me
with a problem, I'll listen.

235
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:50,097
Dead man walking.

236
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:03,527
This man is about to make history.

237
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:08,740
He will be the first to die
in Alcatraz's execution chamber.

238
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:12,953
It is unfortunately my duty
to carry this out...

239
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,873
...at midnight tonight.

240
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:22,838
U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Jane McPherson has just landed...

241
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:27,176
...at New Alcatraz to witness
the execution of Lester McKenna.

242
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:30,012
She Is the judge
who sentenced McKenna...

243
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,892
...In the now Infamous heist of almost
$ 200 million of U.S. Gold brick.

244
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:40,355
Here's the twist. McKenna stashed
the gold before he was apprehended.

245
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:43,483
He vowed never to divulge
its whereabouts...

246
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:48,530
...which led to the treasure hunt by
the FBI that’s gone on for 17 years.

247
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:53,494
Now It’s looking like McKenna just
might take his secret to the grave.

248
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,788
Reporting live from Pier 39
on Fisherman’s Wharf...

249
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:59,875
...I'm Kelly Lange
from San Francisco.

250
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,595
Hey, Mark.

251
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:13,597
Hey, William.

252
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:17,726
Here we are.
Now, let’s check in your guns.

253
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:21,563
- I think we'll keep our guns.
- Then get off my island.

254
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:25,817
- It’s okay, Juan. I'll sign off on it.
- No, Frank. I won't.

255
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:29,071
I don't care if she is
a supreme court justice.

256
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:31,615
- No disrespect intended.
- None taken.

257
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,033
This is my island.

258
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:37,412
As long as it’s my watch,
only me and my boys go strapped.

259
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,668
What is it they call you?

260
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:46,713
- El Fuego.
- The fire?

261
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:53,262
Do what he says.

262
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:14,092
Yo, Sasch!

263
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:16,011
Yeah.

264
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:20,432
I really messed things up
this time, didn't I?

265
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:23,852
Yes, you did.

266
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:31,193
I'm starting to miss the love
from the streets.

267
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,904
That’s gonna be an issue, isn't it?

268
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:39,201
What you think, man? I can't
do no five years in this joint.

269
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:41,912
Here, player. Read a book.

270
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:45,582
What’s this, man?

271
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:49,419
- When Lovers Collide.
- It’s a good book.

272
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:51,213
You can't be serious.

273
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:56,176
Petrosevitch, get up.
Someone wants to see you.

274
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,865
Hello, Jenny.

275
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:03,577
- Please Identify yourself.
- Kestner, Damon J.

276
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:06,955
Voice and handprint
recognition confirmed.

277
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:23,096
- How much time do you need?
- Phones are easy. Alarms worry me.

278
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:26,308
I gotta crack the firewall,
decode and override.

279
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:29,603
I don't care how you do it.
Do it in 90 seconds.

280
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,190
- Tie me off.
- Ninety seconds.

281
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:43,075
- Welcome to Slaughterhouse Five.
- Why they call it that?

282
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:47,704
A man can be executed five ways.
Lethal injection's the most popular...

283
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:52,042
...followed by gas chamber, hanging,
firing squad and my favourite:

284
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:55,254
Electrocution.

285
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:59,842
We do It all here In this totally
soundproof Isolation chamber.

286
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,553
We even let
the condemned man choose.

287
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:06,098
- Who is that?
- Number 1137.

288
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:07,850
What’s he doing here?

289
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:13,355
When a man asks for someone
to spend his last hour with, you do it.

290
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:20,112
Access granted.
Security protocols disabled.

291
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,781
Take me up!

292
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:33,667
- 49er Six to 49er One.
- This is One. Over.

293
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:38,964
- That was a hell of a sunset.
- They're always nice before a storm.

294
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:09,411
- You believe in God, Sascha?
- Most of the time.

295
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:12,915
Ever fly in your dreams?

296
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:19,171
- Who is this guy?
- I'm a man with 50 minutes to live.

297
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:21,882
What does that have to do with me?

298
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,305
Change the view, will you?
I'm tired of this one.

299
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:31,683
- What would you prefer, Lester?
- The desert.

300
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,770
- How does that sound?
- Hot.

301
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:38,357
The rumour is you went
half past dead and came back.

302
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:42,069
Took a ride on the flat line
for 22 minutes...

303
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:44,738
...and lived to tell.

304
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:49,576
Thought we could play some cards
and talk about that.

305
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,939
Whoever wired this place was good,
but you're the best.

306
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:21,108
- That’s why you hired me.
- Exactly.

307
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:22,651
49er One to 49er Six. You ready?

308
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:24,903
If you're waiting on us,
you're back and up.

309
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,864
Let’s party, boys.

310
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:43,839
- Excuse me, sir. I need to talk to you.
- What’s up?

311
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:48,093
- I can't reach the control centre.
- What about the alarms?

312
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,513
I ran a systems check.
The radar's reading normal.

313
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,473
- Cell houses?
- No breaches.

314
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,937
The storm must have knocked out
the phone lines. Okay. Gracias.

315
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:02,149
Billy Ray, check it out.

316
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,413
I'm with y'all. I'm one of y'all.

317
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:44,293
- Sorry.
- Check this out. Let me out of here.

318
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:47,963
- Cell house secured.
- That’s my girl.

319
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:55,929
Hey, what’s up, doll?
Give me one of them pistols, man.

320
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:02,102
- What’s that?
- What’s it look like?

321
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:04,646
It’s the suit I promised you.

322
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:09,484
It’s not first-class,
but it’s a good knockoff.

323
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:18,410
You know, I volunteered for this.

324
00:35:18,577 --> 00:35:24,249
I got tired of parading in and out of
court, hawking appeals, filing writs.

325
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:27,544
What am I doing?
I'm displacing blame.

326
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:31,298
So I decided to accept
my karmic payback.

327
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:33,550
Now I'm not so sure.

328
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:36,595
Dying's not the hard part.

329
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:40,474
It’s knowing that your life
doesn't belong to you.

330
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:45,979
That your death has an exact time and
date takes all the mystery out of it.

331
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,651
Thought about doing it myself,
but I couldn't.

332
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:56,698
What’s waiting on the other side?

333
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:00,702
Not too many people
know that, Lester.

334
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:04,665
Come on. Be generous.
My time's precious.

335
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:09,378
Tell me how it feels
to be embraced by the light.

336
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:12,631
Do your loved ones come for you?

337
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:38,907
Got any jacks?

338
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:43,954
Anybody hit?

339
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:46,165
Seven's down.

340
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,628
He's your man.

341
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:54,798
Sleep tight, friend.

342
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,060
- Wanna know why I'm in that chair?
- No.

343
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:09,104
I hit a U.S. Money train...

344
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:14,067
...and ripped off 200 million worth
of U.S. Gold brick.

345
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:19,948
- You must have done more than that.
- The deal went sideways on me.

346
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:25,662
Train got accidentally derailed.
Five U.S. Treasury agents got killed.

347
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:30,501
Feds have been coming all week...

348
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:34,338
...promising me serenity
if I tell them where I hid it.

349
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:37,966
You think Goïll go easier
on me if I do?

350
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:42,471
I think you must have done
something very bad...

351
00:37:42,638 --> 00:37:46,808
...and now you're gonna pay
for it with your life.

352
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:51,438
But I think God will forgive you.

353
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:57,820
- Air 49er, what’s your air to ground?
- I got zero visibility.

354
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:01,365
- Give me a ballpark ETA.
- My ETA's been pushed.

355
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:05,202
- We're getting close. Push back.
- I'm on my way.

356
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:16,505
Lester, there is someone
here to see you.

357
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:21,677
Hello, Lester.

358
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:28,725
"Whosoever sheds man's blood,
by man shall his blood be shed."

359
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,854
Genesis 9, verse 6.

360
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:36,316
You read that the day you decided
my life wasn't worth living.

361
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:39,194
The jury decided. I presided.

362
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:48,495
It’s okay.

363
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:59,840
You're a long way from Pennsylvania
Avenue. Why'd you make the trip?

364
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:03,886
Because of that ruling
I made 17 years ago.

365
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:10,017
You want my forgiveness.
That’s why you came, isn't it?

366
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:19,693
It was my job to sentence you.

367
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:24,656
Now that your death warrant’s come
down, it’s my job to see it through.

368
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:28,076
Well, that’s very honourable of you.

369
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:32,080
Goodbye, Lester.

370
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:48,430
Let’s go, Petrosevitch.

371
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:02,069
What the hell?

372
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,571
Any last words?

373
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,284
Thanks for the suit.

374
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:11,722
- What’s that?
- What the hell?

375
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:16,852
Nice suit.

376
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:20,355
- Show us what you got.
- Get your ass up there.

377
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:23,150
- Come on, man.
- Come on. Come on.

378
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:31,200
- Oh, dude.
- Damn.

379
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:34,870
Your turn, Little Joe.

380
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,790
My big black ass up that rope?

381
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,086
Goddamn, Joe.

382
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:47,299
What about you, you little bitch?
Give it a try, let’s go!

383
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:51,887
- Up!
- No. Not me.

384
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:54,181
That’s not what I'm gonna do.

385
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:58,560
But you, you know,
you should climb on up there.

386
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:01,563
I'm gonna go over here myself...

387
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:05,734
...and watch you fall
and bust your ass...

388
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:09,571
...you little bitch.

389
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:16,745
What are you doing, man?
Let it go!

390
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:31,552
49er One to Air 49er.
What’s your 20? Over.

391
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,889
According to radar, I'm over you.
But I'm in a total whiteout.

392
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:40,060
Take your eyes off of the radar
and look for the lighthouse.

393
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:46,483
No!

394
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:50,529
What’s going on up there?

395
00:43:19,391 --> 00:43:21,768
I think we just lost our ride.

396
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:33,447
Oh, man. You all see this?

397
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:52,257
Please Identify yourself.

398
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:55,636
- Kestner, Damon J.
- Access denied.

399
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:58,096
You gotta say it louder.

400
00:43:58,263 --> 00:44:00,307
Kestner, Damon J.

401
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,645
Voice and handprint
recognition confirmed.

402
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:34,466
Let me handle this guy.

403
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:38,512
Make sure he's dead.

404
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:44,977
Let it be. It’s blood money.

405
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:48,981
Got yourself born again
since you came to prison?

406
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:52,192
I found God, yes.

407
00:44:52,818 --> 00:44:53,986
There is no God.

408
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:56,321
I told you no last week.

409
00:44:56,488 --> 00:45:01,285
If you're going to kill me, do it.
I'm dead already.

410
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:17,426
Are you going to take me
to the gold? Yes or no?

411
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:22,848
Yes or no?

412
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,236
I can't kill you, Lester.

413
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,113
I need you.

414
00:45:38,697 --> 00:45:42,910
But there's a lot of innocent
people here I just don't need.

415
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:49,625
I'm what shrinks call sociopathic.
Know what that means?

416
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:54,922
It means I can kill everybody
in this room and not feel bad about it.

417
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:56,673
But you...

418
00:45:57,841 --> 00:46:01,094
...you had to find God
to get over your guilt.

419
00:46:04,806 --> 00:46:06,683
But God is dead.

420
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:14,441
And so is everybody in this room
if you don't take me where I wanna go.

421
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:44,596
What you got?

422
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:47,808
Coast Guard reports a
helicopter went down.

423
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:50,269
- Any word from Alcatraz?
- Phones are down.

424
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:51,478
Convenient.

425
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:54,606
- A cell house was compromised.
- Which one?

426
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:58,026
E-Block. It’s temporary while
they retrofit the main house.

427
00:46:58,193 --> 00:47:00,028
- Is he in there?
- Cell A-5.

428
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:02,322
- Who?
- We got a man in deep cover.

429
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:04,658
- As a prisoner?
- Yeah.

430
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:08,120
What kind of man signs up for that?

431
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:56,395
Hey, mama. You got
that blue stuff working, huh?

432
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:10,052
49er Six to 49er One.
I think it’s time for plan B.

433
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:13,347
- How bad?
- Total loss.

434
00:50:13,514 --> 00:50:15,390
All right, get back here.

435
00:50:15,557 --> 00:50:18,602
Sexy little thing, you.

436
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:26,068
Let me see that gun, mama.

437
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:32,241
- Let’s get ready for the FBI.
- Right.

438
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:48,173
We got something.

439
00:50:58,058 --> 00:51:00,352
- What is it?
- Cellular transmission.

440
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:03,730
- Start the trace. Put them on speaker.
- You're live.

441
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:06,275
This is Special Agent Williams, FBI.

442
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:09,611
Let’s not be so formal,
Special Agent Williams.

443
00:51:09,778 --> 00:51:12,990
- I like first names.
- All right. My name's Ellen.

444
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:15,784
- Let’s talk hostages.
- I've got 10.

445
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:18,078
- How many women?
- Three.

446
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:21,540
- Show good faith. Let the women go.
- Relax, Ellen.

447
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:24,293
Everything in time.

448
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:28,088
Tell me what you're doing.

449
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:32,134
You a bad boy who didn't get
enough love from his mother?

450
00:51:32,342 --> 00:51:36,013
Maybe trying to prove a point?
Teach Uncle Sam a lesson?

451
00:51:36,221 --> 00:51:38,891
Oh, no. I love America.

452
00:51:39,057 --> 00:51:41,268
- Then what’s your cause?
- Me.

453
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:46,064
- And who are you?
- Who I am is not important.

454
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:49,860
But who I have...

455
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:54,406
...and what you're gonna
give me for her is.

456
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:32,069
Easy, now. I'm just
looking for my men.

457
00:52:32,611 --> 00:52:34,696
They're all dead.

458
00:52:36,198 --> 00:52:38,325
Get her, and throw her down here.

459
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:39,868
Who are you?

460
00:52:40,035 --> 00:52:41,870
Eleven-thirty-seven.

461
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:44,665
Eleven-thirty-seven?

462
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:46,834
Bust her, Sasch!

463
00:53:09,398 --> 00:53:11,024
Little Joe!

464
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:13,694
Yo, Nick.

465
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:18,407
- You got this little freak handled?
- I got her.

466
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:20,659
Yo, we got your back, dog.

467
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:43,891
What’s the matter, baby girl,
you don't like me?

468
00:53:47,978 --> 00:53:51,273
I thought you liked me.
Come on, you little freak.

469
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:32,773
Nice shooting, Ma.

470
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,609
You just shot up a room full of cans.

471
00:54:36,693 --> 00:54:39,488
Why don't we put the guns down...

472
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:43,033
...and do this like men?

473
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:52,334
You first.

474
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:18,962
- I'm telling you.
- You all right?

475
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:21,089
I'm all right, man...

476
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:23,383
...but we got issues.

477
00:56:25,844 --> 00:56:31,141
You listen carefully. Here's what you'll
give us In exchange for the hostages.

478
00:56:31,308 --> 00:56:35,771
A helicopter ride off this rock
and a fuelled jet waiting...

479
00:56:35,938 --> 00:56:38,607
...to take us
to an undisclosed location.

480
00:56:38,774 --> 00:56:41,902
I can't approve those
demands without authorization.

481
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:45,072
- Then get authorized.
- I need time.

482
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:47,991
You're boring me
with these stall tactics.

483
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:52,621
Put your playbook down, and give
the attorney general a wakeup call.

484
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:56,041
- What if he doesn't meet your demands?
- I start target practice.

485
00:56:56,208 --> 00:57:00,128
And don't try that Waco, Texas
Special-Op stuff, either...

486
00:57:00,963 --> 00:57:04,383
...or I'll light this justice up.
- Light her up?

487
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:06,510
Let me give you the visual.

488
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:12,266
As we speak, Miss McPherson's
strapped to the electric chair.

489
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:17,354
All I have to do is flip a switch
and, well, she's dead.

490
00:57:17,813 --> 00:57:20,649
Dead by the tool of her trade.

491
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:26,446
Now send me my helicopter
before I start filling body bags.

492
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:32,161
Put Special Ops on a "Will notify."
Find out who the phone's registered to.

493
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:34,413
Computer's printing it out now.

494
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:43,922
- Nothing's ever easy, huh?
- Not today.

495
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:45,716
Hang on to this.

496
00:57:48,927 --> 00:57:52,681
- Come on, dog.
- Do it, dog.

497
00:57:53,015 --> 00:57:55,017
You ain't gonna make it.

498
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:02,983
Yo, you bust a cap
in that freaky bitch, or what?

499
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:04,610
Or what.

500
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:12,910
- We lost 3, 4 and 5.
- How?

501
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:15,204
Prisoner 1137.

502
00:58:25,214 --> 00:58:27,132
Who's 1137?

503
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:29,760
A major pain in your ass.

504
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:33,472
You think you're funny now?

505
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:41,855
Sascha, is that you?

506
00:58:42,022 --> 00:58:44,775
How does one of the FBI's
finest marksmen...

507
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:48,529
...shoot an undercover agent?
- I don't have time for this.

508
00:58:48,695 --> 00:58:51,949
Some nut says he's gonna waste
a supreme court justice.

509
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:53,367
Give me the 411.

510
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:57,371
These guys are 10, 15 strong,
minus the three I took out.

511
00:58:57,579 --> 00:58:59,414
- Do they have McPherson?
- I don't know.

512
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:03,585
But I'll tell you one thing,
they're very heavily armed.

513
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:05,212
Hey.

514
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,550
- What’s going on?
- Welcome to the party.

515
00:59:09,758 --> 00:59:13,095
- Glad you could make it.
- What are you doing, Donny?

516
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:15,639
Put your weapons down!

517
00:59:18,475 --> 00:59:22,396
About time you boys grew some hair
on your chest. Now what?

518
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:24,064
Put your weapons down.

519
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:33,031
Don't stop now. You started out
with such authority...

520
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:37,411
...such conviction. Keep it going.
- Here's how it’s gonna go.

521
00:59:37,578 --> 00:59:42,374
You're gonna unstrap Miss McPherson
and we're gonna walk her out of here.

522
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:45,294
What do you think, Miss Jane?

523
00:59:45,502 --> 00:59:47,796
Do it now!

524
01:00:03,645 --> 01:00:08,066
You gave it a try, boys.
I can respect that.

525
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:10,402
But I don't take orders.

526
01:00:15,824 --> 01:00:18,994
Happy you wore that body armour?

527
01:00:22,164 --> 01:00:25,834
What am I doing here?
Well, let me see.

528
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:29,713
I'm gonna dig up $200 million
worth of U.S. Gold brick...

529
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:34,218
...take an early retirement south
of the border. Work on my tan.

530
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:36,345
- You want in?
- I'm not dirty.

531
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:39,932
- Well, I am.
- Why? You were treated good.

532
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:44,853
65G a year and a watch when I'm 60
won't get me a piece of the rock.

533
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:50,150
I want the American dream, Frank.
And I'm gonna get it.

534
01:00:50,526 --> 01:00:53,570
Donald Robert Johnson, age 33.

535
01:00:53,779 --> 01:00:56,698
Served in Kuwait and Bosnia,
three tours.

536
01:00:56,865 --> 01:00:59,660
Purple Heart. He was shot four times.

537
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:03,247
Suffers from Gulf War Syndrome.
Honorary discharge.

538
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:07,793
Last 18 months, working at the Federal
Bureau of Prisons. Can you help?

539
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,003
- I can try.
- Without compromising...

540
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:13,423
...the life of Jane McPherson?
- I'll use a soft hammer.

541
01:01:13,632 --> 01:01:17,386
- You don't own one.
- Besides me, what are your options?

542
01:01:17,636 --> 01:01:20,097
- Special Ops.
- They'll see them coming.

543
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:23,767
- I could meet their demands.
- What if they kill her anyway?

544
01:01:23,934 --> 01:01:27,521
I'll be pushing pencils
for the rest of my career.

545
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:31,900
- Sounds like I'm all you've got.
- This is heavy, Sascha.

546
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:33,235
I'll be in touch.

547
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:38,073
This some tasty stuff, dog.
Come peep it out.

548
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,825
Look at this.

549
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:42,703
Put that down before
you hurt somebody.

550
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:44,621
I got no beef with you.

551
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:47,040
Put it down before you
blow your dick off.

552
01:01:47,249 --> 01:01:50,669
How's he gonna do that, Joe?
Target’s too small.

553
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:56,049
Mine's bigger than yours,
little big-city boy.

554
01:01:57,593 --> 01:02:00,804
- You know you got problems?
- What’s the problem?

555
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:05,225
- Twitch wants to blow something up.
- He wanna blow some shit up.

556
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:08,103
- You wanna blow something up?
- Hell, yeah.

557
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:12,024
Put this on your shoulder.
Put your index finger here.

558
01:02:12,274 --> 01:02:15,152
Line that up nice.
Right about like that.

559
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,155
- Sayonara, you little busters.
- Let her rip.

560
01:02:31,293 --> 01:02:33,754
Get him out of here, man.

561
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:36,089
You all right?

562
01:02:36,256 --> 01:02:39,843
- Told you about pushing buttons.
- What a rush.

563
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:53,398
All right, boys. Pick your poison.

564
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:57,986
- So we giving these wackos guns?
- We need all the help we can get.

565
01:02:58,487 --> 01:03:01,532
- What happened up in the chopper?
- Radioed for backup.

566
01:03:02,324 --> 01:03:04,868
- Hey, Sasch.
- Yeah?

567
01:03:05,702 --> 01:03:07,788
You like that?

568
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:10,332
Think I can do some damage
with this one?

569
01:03:10,499 --> 01:03:11,834
- This mine?
- Take it.

570
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,836
Oh, you the man, Sasch.

571
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:17,506
- Twitch is in the house.
- This weapon was made for you.

572
01:03:17,673 --> 01:03:21,051
- Small and compact.
- Little and mean.

573
01:03:23,262 --> 01:03:25,472
This some crazy shit, Sasch.

574
01:03:25,681 --> 01:03:29,268
- Cuckoo crazy.
- Way beyond that.

575
01:03:29,518 --> 01:03:31,228
Why are you doing this?

576
01:03:34,189 --> 01:03:37,401
Little late in the game
for that, isn't it?

577
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:40,195
Haven't you been paying attention?

578
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:42,489
Well, we know you want the gold.

579
01:03:42,656 --> 01:03:44,700
But you're more than greedy.

580
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:49,705
There must be some reason for that.
What happened to you?

581
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:54,501
Feel like I should be laying on
a couch with a box of Kleenex.

582
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:57,546
Talking about how my father beat me.

583
01:03:58,088 --> 01:04:00,799
- Or about how my mother raped me.
- Did they?

584
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:10,309
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

585
01:04:12,603 --> 01:04:17,274
Tell me, how many candles did they
put on your birthday cake this year?

586
01:04:17,441 --> 01:04:20,694
I know it’s not polite to ask
a woman her age...

587
01:04:20,861 --> 01:04:24,907
...but you're not hung up on
superficial things like that, right?

588
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:28,243
Youngest supreme court justice ever.

589
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,997
One of only three women
ever appointed.

590
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,084
You're gonna be in the
history books one day.

591
01:04:36,919 --> 01:04:39,546
I'm 53.

592
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:42,674
Fifty-three.

593
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:49,097
You sure are an attractive 53 too.

594
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:55,020
Little long in the tooth for my taste,
but let me see.

595
01:04:57,189 --> 01:04:59,274
Yes.

596
01:04:59,441 --> 01:05:02,486
You have kept your bait fresh.

597
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:07,199
You're probably pretty smart too.

598
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:10,327
So tell me...

599
01:05:13,121 --> 01:05:15,916
...why have you
never been married?

600
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:19,253
No one ever asked me.

601
01:05:19,837 --> 01:05:23,257
Too busy burning bras?

602
01:05:23,423 --> 01:05:28,303
Getting your panties in a twist over
women's rights, equal pay, pro-choice.

603
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:30,722
Fighting the cause, right?

604
01:05:31,974 --> 01:05:34,643
And all that time...

605
01:05:37,062 --> 01:05:39,898
...you forgot about love,
didn't you?

606
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:45,612
And your biological clock
stopped ticking.

607
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,784
Your fields went fallow.

608
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:57,207
And now, in the autumn
of your historic life...

609
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,464
...you ain't got nothing.

610
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:07,759
Do you, Miss Jane?

611
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,470
Not even a dog.

612
01:06:15,684 --> 01:06:18,437
I have my work.

613
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:23,942
That’s my story. What’s yours?

614
01:06:25,027 --> 01:06:30,073
Sorry to disappoint you after your
candour and all the tears falling down.

615
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,744
There is no deep psychological
reason for my behaviour.

616
01:06:33,911 --> 01:06:36,788
I just saw a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity and I took it.

617
01:06:36,788 --> 01:06:37,956
I just saw a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity and I took it.

618
01:07:02,856 --> 01:07:04,107
We've got her!

619
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:06,944
Come on. Come on. Come on down!

620
01:07:10,072 --> 01:07:11,824
Get these doors open!

621
01:07:12,032 --> 01:07:15,953
- Take Lester and get out!
- I'm not leaving without you.

622
01:07:17,663 --> 01:07:20,916
Please help me. Get me out of here.

623
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:22,626
Get them open now!

624
01:07:23,627 --> 01:07:24,628
I'll be back!

625
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:31,343
Give me that rifle!

626
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,637
Come on.

627
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:35,931
Bring her up.

628
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:09,631
- Something wrong out there?
- Nope. Everything's peachy.

629
01:08:09,882 --> 01:08:12,009
Then why am I talking to you?
Who are you?

630
01:08:12,259 --> 01:08:14,011
I'm second in command.

631
01:08:14,178 --> 01:08:16,180
Where's our helicopter?

632
01:08:16,847 --> 01:08:18,765
We've still got 36 minutes.

633
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:22,644
You're a woman, which means
you know we don't like to wait.

634
01:08:22,811 --> 01:08:25,898
So get the chopper airborne now.

635
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:30,068
Or I will fry this lily-white bitch.

636
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:37,576
Send the chopper.

637
01:11:26,036 --> 01:11:30,666
- Don't even think about it!
- Your clip's dry, 1137. You know it.

638
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:32,084
Do you think so?

639
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:35,879
Yeah. You'd have used it
by now if it wasn't.

640
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:38,131
Are you sure?

641
01:11:39,383 --> 01:11:40,843
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

642
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:45,472
That’s right. Magazine's dry.

643
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:48,809
Question is, do I still have
one in the tube?

644
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:52,187
I say you're dry.

645
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:54,022
Make your move.

646
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:11,373
- That’s a nice bluff.
- Wasn't a bluff. It was a misfire.

647
01:12:11,915 --> 01:12:13,167
Where's Lester?

648
01:12:13,542 --> 01:12:15,169
Find him yourself.

649
01:12:18,463 --> 01:12:20,090
Sweet dreams, partner.

650
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:38,734
Damn!

651
01:12:41,737 --> 01:12:44,114
Yo, Sasch. You need to holler at me.

652
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:45,991
- Later.
- No, now.

653
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:49,912
- I need to know what’s going on.
- Watch my back like usual.

654
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:54,041
I got your back. That’s a given.
I need to know the game plan.

655
01:12:54,249 --> 01:12:57,127
I'm on a tight clock, man.
I don't got time.

656
01:12:57,294 --> 01:13:02,341
Are you hiding something from me?
I get the feeling like you are.

657
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:09,681
Nothing. I'm trying to save the life
of a supreme court justice.

658
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:12,768
- There's more.
- Now's not the time, brother.

659
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:14,853
Yes, it is.

660
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:20,818
I'm undercover.

661
01:13:23,987 --> 01:13:26,114
FBI.

662
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:31,328
- But you passed the lie detector test.
- Anybody can do that.

663
01:13:33,831 --> 01:13:38,085
All this time, you've been
setting up on me.

664
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:48,512
I believed in you.

665
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:51,181
I trusted you.

666
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:55,936
I've let you into my family.
I vouched for you.

667
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:01,900
And you betrayed me?

668
01:14:02,526 --> 01:14:04,403
It’s not that simple.

669
01:14:06,613 --> 01:14:08,282
Don't do it.

670
01:14:17,666 --> 01:14:19,626
Well, I'm sorry.

671
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:31,680
I thought we were friends, Sasch.

672
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:38,854
We are. You can bet
your life on that.

673
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:53,702
- Is the helicopter here?
- Yeah. Where's Lester?

674
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:55,787
I've got him.

675
01:15:03,504 --> 01:15:06,048
You've got something of mine, 1137.

676
01:15:06,757 --> 01:15:07,841
I want It back.

677
01:15:08,091 --> 01:15:10,552
I'll swap you.
Lester for the judge.

678
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:16,642
- What do you want the judge for?
- She's my tick et out of here.

679
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:20,687
You give me Lester, and we'll
let you thumb a ride with us.

680
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:25,192
Hitchhiking's dangerous. Didn't
your mama ever tell you that?

681
01:15:27,486 --> 01:15:32,199
- When and where?
- Main cell house, 15 minutes.

682
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:35,035
Fifteen minutes.

683
01:15:40,624 --> 01:15:43,168
Unstrap the judge.

684
01:15:51,134 --> 01:15:55,180
Get fired up, boys. He took the bait.

685
01:15:58,517 --> 01:16:02,437
Hey, how do I look?

686
01:16:03,856 --> 01:16:07,067
Like a big-ass prom queen.

687
01:16:13,615 --> 01:16:16,285
You sure you want to do this?

688
01:16:16,493 --> 01:16:20,497
My destiny is in Goïs hands.
I'm cool with that.

689
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:26,587
Now, I want to tell you
about a place I used to go.

690
01:16:26,753 --> 01:16:30,257
It’s an alpine lake called Trinity,
west of Shasta.

691
01:16:31,383 --> 01:16:34,887
There's a little cove on the
north bank, tucked away.

692
01:16:35,345 --> 01:16:38,474
You should take a trip there
when this is over.

693
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:42,269
Trinity Lake, west of Shasta.

694
01:16:43,812 --> 01:16:45,939
Take the trip.

695
01:16:57,493 --> 01:17:00,579
- It’s him.
- What the hell's going on out there?

696
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:03,916
- I got everything under control.
- Any good news?

697
01:17:04,124 --> 01:17:08,253
I'm trading the condemned man
for McPherson. You happy?

698
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:09,421
Thrilled.

699
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:11,715
Give them their chopper.

700
01:17:11,924 --> 01:17:16,804
I already did all that. I'm sorry
I'm yelling. I'm a little edgy.

701
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:19,223
Don't worry. I got it handled.

702
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:34,780
Hey. You got room for two in there?

703
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:42,579
There is now.

704
01:17:55,717 --> 01:18:00,139
You know, you gotta break
a few things down to me, man.

705
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:07,855
What am I doing here? Earning
your trust, maintaining my cover.

706
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:10,774
You already screwed that up.

707
01:18:11,567 --> 01:18:13,944
The Bureau thought
if we did time together...

708
01:18:14,111 --> 01:18:18,198
...you'd trust me with more
information back out on the streets.

709
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:23,495
You want Sonny that bad?

710
01:18:24,997 --> 01:18:27,040
My wife's dead because of him.

711
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:32,588
She died after one of his men jacked my
car and put four bullets in her chest.

712
01:18:34,256 --> 01:18:37,468
You bet your life I want him that bad.

713
01:18:38,927 --> 01:18:41,138
I'm sorry, man. I didn't know.

714
01:18:43,223 --> 01:18:45,601
I don't know.

715
01:18:47,686 --> 01:18:50,564
She was the best part of me.

716
01:19:07,372 --> 01:19:11,376
- All right. Put this helmet on.
- What’s this do?

717
01:19:11,543 --> 01:19:14,922
- Whatever you look at, you can shoot.
- Yeah?

718
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:19,051
Targeting eyepiece activated.

719
01:19:25,724 --> 01:19:28,435
This is just like a video game.

720
01:20:41,758 --> 01:20:44,219
I'm gonna make this real simple.

721
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:47,306
You send us the judge,
we'll send you Lester.

722
01:20:57,691 --> 01:20:59,735
Start walking.

723
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:05,491
- Go with God, my brother.
- Always.

724
01:21:59,545 --> 01:22:01,839
- Get him out of here.
- Got her, boss.

725
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:04,258
- Let’s move.
- Go. Go, go, go.

726
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:07,302
Let’s go, boys.

727
01:22:26,155 --> 01:22:29,992
All right, homeys, you did good.

728
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:32,202
Real good.

729
01:22:32,619 --> 01:22:37,124
Now give up your guns,
or two things can happen.

730
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:40,794
You get killed, or you get caught.

731
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:49,678
He's right. They kept their word,
now let’s keep ours. Let them go.

732
01:23:01,732 --> 01:23:03,775
Comprende this!

733
01:23:12,367 --> 01:23:13,452
Cease fire!

734
01:23:42,564 --> 01:23:44,566
Y'all want some?

735
01:23:46,401 --> 01:23:48,111
We going! Come on, man!

736
01:24:09,508 --> 01:24:11,093
God!

737
01:24:30,612 --> 01:24:31,697
Cover me!

738
01:24:37,286 --> 01:24:39,371
We got a problem.

739
01:24:39,872 --> 01:24:41,665
Acquiring target.

740
01:24:51,717 --> 01:24:53,469
You mother...

741
01:24:54,052 --> 01:24:56,847
- Problem solved.
- You're bad.

742
01:25:12,446 --> 01:25:13,614
Yeah. Yeah!

743
01:25:16,116 --> 01:25:19,703
- We gotta do something.
- Stay here or jump for that rope.

744
01:25:19,912 --> 01:25:21,163
Either way, we die.

745
01:25:24,374 --> 01:25:26,752
I guess we're going for the rope.

746
01:25:31,048 --> 01:25:32,299
Get out of there!

747
01:25:59,827 --> 01:26:02,621
Pretty good, 1137.

748
01:26:03,372 --> 01:26:05,916
But not good enough.

749
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:08,919
Drop it!

750
01:26:09,127 --> 01:26:10,712
I said, drop it!

751
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:18,178
Oh, hell, yeah!

752
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:26,645
That’s what you get, bitch!

753
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:44,663
Let’s see if you got the sack
to finish the job.

754
01:26:46,456 --> 01:26:48,584
Don't do it.

755
01:27:13,275 --> 01:27:17,529
- I got something...
- Put the gun down. Now.

756
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:24,703
McPherson's in the last cell
on the right.

757
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:26,288
Come on!

758
01:27:26,455 --> 01:27:29,291
We all right.
Everything's good in the 'hood.

759
01:27:45,224 --> 01:27:48,352
- Did we get them?
- Yeah, we got them.

760
01:27:49,228 --> 01:27:53,982
- I'm gonna miss you, Sasch.
- Don't say that, man.

761
01:27:54,233 --> 01:27:56,151
It’s a nice night to die.

762
01:27:56,318 --> 01:28:00,072
Just hang in there.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

763
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,699
Get me the hell out of here.

764
01:28:02,908 --> 01:28:06,495
You just hang in there for me.
You hear?

765
01:28:06,995 --> 01:28:08,831
Sascha.

766
01:28:13,168 --> 01:28:15,003
That’s not McPherson.

767
01:28:18,006 --> 01:28:22,803
They switched her with one
of the hostages. He still has her.

768
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:26,140
This Is FBI Air Unit
Charlie Bravo 4804...

769
01:28:26,306 --> 01:28:29,810
...requesting you follow us
back to San Francisco.

770
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:31,395
We've got company.

771
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:41,196
- Sorry your girlfriend died.
- Casualties of war.

772
01:28:41,363 --> 01:28:45,868
- You're not just a prisoner, are you?
- No, I'm not. Undercover FBI.

773
01:28:46,034 --> 01:28:51,582
- You picked the wrong prison.
- Don't get cocky. I got what you want.

774
01:28:51,874 --> 01:28:54,751
- I got what you need.
- Don't do it.

775
01:28:54,918 --> 01:28:58,297
Turn that helicopter around
or she goes for a swim.

776
01:28:58,464 --> 01:29:02,759
You wanna go for a swim?
I think she wants to go for a swim.

777
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:06,430
Say goodbye.

778
01:32:02,189 --> 01:32:05,776
Almas nalgas, homeboy.
Someone here to see you.

779
01:32:49,444 --> 01:32:51,280
- Talk.
- How you feeling?

780
01:32:51,905 --> 01:32:54,283
Eight broken ribs...

781
01:32:54,908 --> 01:32:59,121
...a broken leg, a broken arm.
How'd you think I was feeling?

782
01:32:59,288 --> 01:33:03,584
Well, for the record,
I couldn't have done it without you.

783
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:07,921
I heard you busted Sonny.

784
01:33:08,088 --> 01:33:12,968
That’s what I started out to do.
I usually like to finish what I start.

785
01:33:13,135 --> 01:33:15,179
Did you find the gold?

786
01:33:17,431 --> 01:33:20,851
- Did you get some for me?
- I got something better.

787
01:33:21,018 --> 01:33:23,729
- What’s that?
- I spoke with McPherson.

788
01:33:23,896 --> 01:33:26,440
- I had her look at your file.
- And?

789
01:33:26,607 --> 01:33:29,151
She knocked your sentence back.

790
01:33:29,735 --> 01:33:31,487
To what?

791
01:33:32,237 --> 01:33:35,616
How fast can you get out
of those clothes?

792
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:48,003
- You better not be playing me.
- You know me. I ain't playing.

793
01:33:48,170 --> 01:33:49,963
You serious?

794
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:53,300
That’s what I'm talking about!

795
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:58,931
Now, Nicholas, do we have issues,
or are we all right?

796
01:33:59,139 --> 01:34:02,267
Hell, no, we ain't all right.

797
01:34:06,897 --> 01:34:08,148
We all right.

798
01:34:29,753 --> 01:34:31,797
- What’s up, girl?
- Hey, Twitch.

799
01:34:31,964 --> 01:34:36,301
- "Hey"? You don't miss your boo?
- I miss you every day, Twitch.

800
01:34:36,468 --> 01:34:40,055
Dang, girl. Act like it.
After all I've been through.

801
01:34:40,222 --> 01:34:44,393
Please believe this. You gotta
believe it. It was cracking!

802
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:48,480
It was down in here. Bullets flying.
I'm ducking bullets.

803
01:34:48,647 --> 01:34:51,400
Bad guys die.
I'm a good guy this time.

804
01:34:51,567 --> 01:34:55,571
I'm a hero. I'm big.
I'm getting out soon.

805
01:34:55,737 --> 01:34:58,615
That’s real! Me and the warden,
we like this.

806
01:34:58,782 --> 01:35:02,369
Twitch, the warden don't know you.
Your name is Bernard.

807
01:35:02,578 --> 01:35:06,248
- Don't talk about that.
- I'm stopping this Twitch mess.

808
01:35:06,456 --> 01:35:08,584
You keep hopping the same stuff.

809
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:12,880
- I'm tired of these fake-ass diamonds.
- They look real to me.

810
01:35:13,046 --> 01:35:15,257
What’s more real than Twitch?

811
01:35:15,424 --> 01:35:19,678
- What’s more real than Twitch Dog?
- Twitch Dog coming home.

812
01:35:19,845 --> 01:35:22,723
I'm coming home.
Put your hand on the glass.

813
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:24,641
Put your hand on the glass.

814
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:28,395
- Close your eyes.
- You're aggressive behind glass.

815
01:35:28,562 --> 01:35:32,900
Put your hand on the glass.
I want you to close your eyes.

816
01:35:33,066 --> 01:35:36,028
Close your eyes.
I want you to feel me.

817
01:35:36,195 --> 01:35:41,325
I'm coming home soon. I'll take you
anywhere you wanna go, okay?

818
01:35:41,533 --> 01:35:43,619
- Anywhere?
- Anywhere.

819
01:35:43,785 --> 01:35:47,623
- And I'm gonna buy you anything.
- Anything, Twitch?

820
01:35:47,789 --> 01:35:51,210
I met a million-dollar man.
I'm hitting his house.

821
01:35:51,376 --> 01:35:54,296
When you come home,
you be on the up and up.

822
01:35:54,463 --> 01:35:58,675
- Why you wanna hit the man?
- What the hell is you looking at?

823
01:35:58,842 --> 01:36:00,594
- Twitch!
- You in my zone!

824
01:36:00,761 --> 01:36:03,055
Bernard, here. See, here.

825
01:36:03,222 --> 01:36:07,434
You ain't never seen a lovely lady
before? You ill hustling.

826
01:36:07,601 --> 01:36:09,186
Twitch! Keep it here.

827
01:36:09,353 --> 01:36:14,691
Here! Keep it focused. That’s why
you're in here. You didn't listen.

828
01:36:14,858 --> 01:36:20,322
I'm with you, baby. You know.
I'll be home, now. You wait for me.

829
01:36:20,989 --> 01:36:23,992
You remember that time
we was by the beaches?

830
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:27,538
You remember what we used
to do back in the day?

831
01:36:27,704 --> 01:36:29,665
That’s what I'm saying!

832
01:36:29,832 --> 01:36:34,002
Wiggle it for me. Show me some.
What the hell you looking at?

833
01:36:34,169 --> 01:36:38,090
Do the damn thing. Don't make
me go old school with you.

834
01:36:38,298 --> 01:36:39,550
Do the damn thing.

835
01:36:39,716 --> 01:36:42,261
Go ahead, girl.
Make them wiggle.
