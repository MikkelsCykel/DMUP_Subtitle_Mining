1
00:00:03,463 --> 00:00:06,159
Look, or maybe it's not that literal.
All right, what's...

2
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:07,427
Could there be anything
in these prizes?

3
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:10,163
Oh, what, like he's gonna get
crushed by a giant Spongebob?

4
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:13,535
Hey, Spongebob lives underwater.

5
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:17,499
It's so sad that you know that.

6
00:00:17,544 --> 00:00:19,569
All right. He won that tacky
mud-flap girl chain...

7
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:21,170
on this game, though, so...

8
00:00:21,214 --> 00:00:23,182
aren't those usually
on those big 18 wheelers?

9
00:00:23,216 --> 00:00:24,478
Yeah. Yeah.

10
00:00:24,517 --> 00:00:26,382
God, I don't see it in
this picture anywhere though.

11
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:30,650
All right! God.

12
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:35,124
All right.

13
00:00:38,865 --> 00:00:40,025
Uh, can I take your order?

14
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:41,897
Yeah. What do you want?

15
00:00:46,973 --> 00:00:48,406
Are you OK?

16
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:59,177
Please tell me
there's a short in your wiring.

17
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:04,556
Whoa. Whoa. That guy's
way too close to my truck.

18
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:06,684
Hey, you're too fucking
close, man! Pull up!

19
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:08,318
Hey!

20
00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:14,160
# There is someone #

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,690
Stop! Stop!

22
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:16,724
# Walking behind you #

23
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:19,398
Watch out! Shit!

24
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,565
- What the fuck?
- # Turn around #

25
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:22,700
- Oh, my God!
- # Look at me #

26
00:01:22,742 --> 00:01:24,801
- Get out! Get out!
- What? What?

27
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:26,505
Behind us!

28
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:27,911
There's no one in that truck!

29
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:28,238
# Watching your footsteps #

30
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:29,175
# Watching your footsteps #

31
00:01:28,948 --> 00:01:32,042
Shit! Hey! Pull up, man!
Come on! Pull up!

32
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:36,714
- # Look at me #
- Unh! Shit!

33
00:01:36,756 --> 00:01:37,723
- # There is someone #
- Back up!

34
00:01:37,757 --> 00:01:38,781
Back up!

35
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:41,816
# Who really loves you #

36
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,524
# Here's my heart #

37
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,724
Watch your eyes!
Watch your eyes! Come here!

38
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:48,961
# In my hand #

39
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:52,732
# Turn around #

40
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:54,103
- # Look at me #
- Come on. Let's go!

41
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,437
Come on, come on, come on.

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,645
Unh!

43
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:41,617
- Oh!
- Unh!

44
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:53,129
We're all done here.
You need a ride?

45
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:55,633
Um, we can walk to my house...

46
00:02:55,668 --> 00:02:58,034
and then I'll give you
a ride to yours.

47
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:00,667
No, thanks. We'll be OK.

48
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:06,736
Will we?

49
00:03:09,181 --> 00:03:10,614
Yeah. We'll be all right.

50
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,174
I mean...

51
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:15,312
how Frank...

52
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:17,151
God, it... it's not only horrible...

53
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:20,420
but can you feel...
can you feel how vicious it was?

54
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:21,824
Easy.

55
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:23,795
OK? Easy.

56
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,089
Let's just...

57
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:28,963
let's just take a step back.

58
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:32,633
All right? He was behind
Ashley and Ashlyn on the ride...

59
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,764
but there was no ladder here.
You know, there was no rope.

60
00:03:34,807 --> 00:03:37,332
Nothing in that picture pointed to this.

61
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:39,139
We were wrong about the photos.

62
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:42,045
I should've left town.
It's better not knowing.

63
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:45,073
No, it's never better
staying ignorant.

64
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:47,176
Willful ignorance
is surrendering control.

65
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:51,987
What, did you read that somewhere
in Mrs. Brooks' English class?

66
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,887
No. l... you know, I'm not...

67
00:03:55,928 --> 00:03:58,294
I'm not the total idiot
you think I am.

68
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:01,830
OK, that's Lewis after Frank...

69
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,926
then lan and Erin.

70
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:06,096
There's a couple of kids behind them,
but I can't make them out...

71
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:08,197
because this guy's arm's
in the way. Can you?

72
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,229
No.

73
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:11,140
All right, you know what?

74
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:13,610
We'll ask Lewis, lan, and Erin
if they remember.

75
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:15,204
OK?

76
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:17,772
Are there any more pictures
from the roller coaster?

77
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,793
I guess...

78
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:35,390
that kind of thing
is gonna happen to us

79
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:36,628
for the rest of our lives.

80
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:38,261
Yeah.

81
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,036
You know, I was gonna...

82
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,235
I was gonna ask her to marry me.

83
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:47,779
Right after graduation.

84
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:49,610
Heh.

85
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:03,161
Oh.

86
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:11,202
No, wait.

87
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:12,669
Look, behind Stacy.

88
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:14,866
That's Frank.

89
00:05:16,008 --> 00:05:17,600
This picture shows how he died.

90
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:23,012
All right, go back to Lewis.

91
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:25,006
All right, go back to Lewis.

92
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:28,452
OK, he's got that hammer.

93
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:31,354
And the weight looks like
it's coming down...

94
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,187
on his head.

95
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:34,214
No, no, no, check this out.

96
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,353
Right now Lewis is down at State
for football training camp.

97
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:39,796
State's team is called the Sultans.

98
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:41,458
That's it. That's the clue.

99
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,469
We have to tell him.
Show him these pictures.

100
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,764
Wouldn't you want to know?

101
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:52,708
Wait, there's pictures of us in there?

102
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:54,439
Yeah.

103
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,741
Yeah, of course.

104
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:57,772
Huh. No.

105
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,580
No. I don't want to see mine.
No. Huh.

106
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:01,916
What about willful ignorance?

107
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:04,615
Well, I'm full of shit, all right?!

108
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,351
I mean, I never thought
I could see my own death...

109
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:07,653
before it happened, Wendy.

110
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,988
No, you know what?
We can tell Lewis, but...

111
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:13,998
Seriously, if there's any way
to beat this thing...

112
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:15,624
I gotta stay focused...

113
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,225
and if I look at that picture,
all I'm gonna do is obsess.

114
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:19,829
So, you know what?
No, I don't want to see it.

115
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,101
I mean, unless we have to.

116
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,840
You mean until we have to.

117
00:06:33,818 --> 00:06:35,445
One more thing.

118
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:37,455
Is it bad?

119
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:40,754
I mean, is it, like,
painful or embarrassing?

120
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,290
I mean, there's nothing, like,
up my ass or anything, right?

121
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:44,920
I'll see you tomorrow.

122
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:51,461
You on crack. Both of you.

123
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:53,835
Just listen, OK?
Ashley and Ashlyn were first.

124
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,499
Then Frankie Cheeks
and then you. This is the...

125
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,064
- Aw, come on, Kevin.
- Listen.

126
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:58,598
McKinley and Erin
were next, all right?

127
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:00,770
And there were two people in front of us.
Do you remember who they were?

128
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:03,076
Fuck no, and I don't care.
And you shouldn't care either, man...

129
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:05,412
'cause what you're tellin' me
right now is straight bullshit.

130
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,508
Just listen, Lewis.

131
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,917
Kevin, it's like those stories.

132
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:12,787
Like this guy was killed
by a car he sold 10 years ago.

133
00:07:12,824 --> 00:07:16,123
Two sisters, right, were killed when
they were driving to visit each other.

134
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:18,288
You know, shit like that, man.

135
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:19,796
Fuck the Bruins!

136
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:22,061
Oh, yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

137
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,863
Bruin faggots!

138
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,494
Yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

139
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:31,839
Man, you're reading into this shit
like them damn urban legends.

140
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,844
Three people have died, Lewis.

141
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:35,209
I mean, if you think
this can be written off...

142
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,214
as a simple coincidence
and it ends there...

143
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,079
you're in serious denial.

144
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:40,607
Unh! What about you two, huh?

145
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:41,914
What?

146
00:07:41,953 --> 00:07:45,081
You both lost people real close
to you in a fucked-up way.

147
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:47,057
And in order to feel
less guilty or whatever...

148
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,821
seeing signs and patterns, man.

149
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,626
I don't blame you.
But it's wrong, dawg.

150
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:55,155
Unh! It's wrong.

151
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:58,397
That's denial.

152
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,267
Unh!

153
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,638
- Unh!
- You got it!

154
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:05,939
OK, what about what happened
at the roller coaster? Huh?

155
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:06,966
Wendy saw it.

156
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:09,878
Man, she got a hunch.
Fuckin' intense, but she got a hunch.

157
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:12,348
Man, I'm here because I get
good hunches before every down.

158
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:14,374
No, you know
they're either gonna run or pass.

159
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:16,011
Hers came to her from nowhere.

160
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:17,783
You're here and alive because of her.

161
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:19,312
No, I'm alive because of me.

162
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:20,881
No, listen.
You don't get it, man.

163
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:22,290
Does that make sense to you?

164
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:24,124
There's nothing to get, Kevin!
It's bullshit.

165
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:25,925
No, just hear me out, all right?

166
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:26,988
Unh.

167
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:28,396
# Yeah #

168
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:36,631
Talk about a vision.
Man, I seen my whole life played out...

169
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:39,074
and it sure as hell
ain't gonna end now. Unh!

170
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,338
It's going just as I saw it.

171
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:43,609
35 high school games
without an injury.

172
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,980
<i>- USA Today All-American.
- Second team.</i>

173
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:47,985
- Free ride to play for the Sultans!
- The Bruins passed on you.

174
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:49,543
Man, fuck the Bruins!

175
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:51,077
- Fuck 'em!
- You goddamn right!

176
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:53,181
What the fuck is a Bruin anyway?

177
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:54,816
Aah!

178
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:57,191
Unh! Unh! Unh!

179
00:08:57,228 --> 00:08:58,820
Four years from now...

180
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:01,388
Lewis Romero goin' in
the second round to Oakland.

181
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:03,093
Unh!

182
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:05,261
He's gonna romp and stomp.

183
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:09,296
15 seasons, with four Super Bowl
rings on his fingers.

184
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,467
Lewis ain't afraid of no death.
Fuck Death!

185
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,909
Death is a fuckin' Denver fan.

186
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:15,640
Death wear blue and orange.

187
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,478
Real men wear black.

188
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,676
Lewis ain't afraid of no Death.

189
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:22,015
Death is afraid of me!

190
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:23,520
Death fears me!

191
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:24,783
Kevin.

192
00:09:24,822 --> 00:09:26,915
'Cause, baby, I just win.
I just win, Kevin!

193
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,860
That's all I know how to do!
I just win! Unh!

194
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:32,192
Fuck Death!

195
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,164
- Fuck the Bruins!
- Yeah!

196
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,099
Aah!

197
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:37,567
- Look out!
- Lewis!

198
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,171
Man, that was close, Lewis.

199
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,197
Hey, did you see that?

200
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:46,699
Whoo! What I tell you,
Kevin, huh?

201
00:09:46,744 --> 00:09:48,678
Fuck Death! I just win!

202
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,112
That's all I know
how to do, Kevin.

203
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:51,240
Baby, I just win!

204
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,475
Aaaaah!

205
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:55,816
- Ooooh!
- God!

206
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,031
Did I do something...

207
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,895
to bring this on everybody?

208
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:14,028
Don't, Wendy.

209
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,063
But why me?

210
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:19,371
All those people out there
wanting to have a premonition...

211
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:22,242
or see a ghost or whatever,
and I don't.

212
00:10:25,348 --> 00:10:28,112
I just want it to stop.

213
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:29,982
Just stop.

214
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,716
I don't know why, Wendy...

215
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:35,316
but you didn't do anything.

216
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,985
All right? This is just...

217
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,929
I don't know. I mean,
I wish I knew why, you know?

218
00:10:40,964 --> 00:10:43,694
I wish I could... I could
come up with a guess even...

219
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,928
to make you feel OK, but...

220
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:50,805
You know, I can't.

221
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,509
Yeah.

222
00:10:55,512 --> 00:10:57,173
There's nothing I can do.

223
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:02,984
Can you drive?

224
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:05,579
Heh.

225
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:06,884
Yeah.

226
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:13,287
You know, by the way,
that... that picture of me.

227
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:17,630
My, uh, my head's not, like,
through the windshield or anything?

228
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:20,033
You know,
crushed by a steering wheel?

229
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,901
lmpaled by a gear shift?

230
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:26,402
Right?

231
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,852
Zip, it's Pip.

232
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:43,325
Have you cut
those plywood orders yet?

233
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,850
Uh, that's a big no, Pip.

234
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:48,262
Osama bin Supervisor wants me
to get rid of these pigeons first.

235
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:49,890
They keep settin' off the alarms.

236
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:05,037
Hello, babies.

237
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:15,717
Ha ha ha!

238
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:19,658
Oh, ha ha ha! Heh.

239
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:26,796
Hey. After I, uh, restock
this stuff...

240
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,825
that these pinhead customers
can't manage...

241
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:30,769
to return to the shelves
themselves...

242
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:32,203
we can blow out of here, OK?

243
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:33,866
Righty-o, babe.

244
00:12:38,178 --> 00:12:39,338
Aah!

245
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,109
Erin, it's Wendy and Kevin.

246
00:12:41,148 --> 00:12:42,740
Shit!

247
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:44,683
You scared the shit out of me!

248
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:46,913
Yeah, wait till you hear
what we have to tell you.

249
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:58,431
Zip, it's Pip. Come over here.

250
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:01,195
You are gonna trip
when you hear this.

251
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:04,432
Well, paint me intrigued, Pip.
I'm on my way.

252
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:07,907
So let me get this straight.
I'm gonna O.D. on nail polish...

253
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:10,911
and lan is gonna be
embarrassed to death?

254
00:13:10,945 --> 00:13:12,572
You saw what happened
to Wendy, right?

255
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:15,514
What's happened to the others?
I mean, you just saw their pictures.

256
00:13:26,093 --> 00:13:28,527
Oh, my God, guys,
what's going on?

257
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:31,827
What's going on?
That's crazy! That's crazy!

258
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:33,696
Ha ha!

259
00:13:34,802 --> 00:13:37,498
We need to know who was sitting
behind you on the roller coaster.

260
00:13:37,538 --> 00:13:40,905
OK, who was sitting behind us
on the roller coaster?

261
00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:43,910
Oh! Oh, wait! Wasn't it
that one guy who got voted...

262
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:46,777
most likely to become
manager at Red Lobster?

263
00:13:46,814 --> 00:13:48,008
Oh, no. You know what?
God, I remember.

264
00:13:48,048 --> 00:13:49,811
There was this guy,
uh, black cloak...

265
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,374
I didn't see his face, but, um...

266
00:13:51,418 --> 00:13:53,613
the ride attendant
did take his sickle...

267
00:13:53,654 --> 00:13:57,021
before the ride started
if that's helpful in any way.

268
00:13:57,057 --> 00:13:58,922
Do you think we care
if you laugh at us?

269
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,449
This is our lives, OK?

270
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:02,758
What choice do we have?
Just give into it?

271
00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:04,593
Oh, God. You know what?
There is no "it."

272
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:07,532
OK, wait, are you guys saying
that Death is, like, a person?

273
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:10,196
No. It's like... like a force.

274
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:13,934
Yeah. Well, you know what?
A force is just a force.

275
00:14:13,974 --> 00:14:16,442
It's nothing else.
Just transferred energy.

276
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:19,935
I mean, it has no goals,
no awareness that is a force.

277
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,641
But there is awareness, McKinley.

278
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:24,116
In fact, in past cases,
if the next in line is saved...

279
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:26,415
it'd skip that person.
That's why we're here.

280
00:14:26,453 --> 00:14:28,216
Oh, man,
what have you been smoking?

281
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:32,489
Ha ha!

282
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:37,263
- Top shelf.
- OK.

283
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:48,002
Kevin! Those banners.
They're in the picture.

284
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:51,167
lan, watch those boxes!

285
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:59,149
What the fuck, man?
You said those boxes were falling!

286
00:14:59,186 --> 00:15:00,949
No, I said watch the boxes.

287
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,615
Really? What for?
They're not doing anything.

288
00:15:02,656 --> 00:15:05,591
We're not gonna apologize
for trying to save you.

289
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:09,494
You haven't seen or been through
what we have... yet.

290
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,122
Oh. Yet.

291
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:14,396
OK, so who's next in this theory
you have, me or lan?

292
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:16,801
Well, we know the order of how
we were sitting on the roller coaster...

293
00:15:16,837 --> 00:15:19,271
but not how it works
with people who sat together.

294
00:15:19,306 --> 00:15:22,104
OK, we don't know
if Ashley or Ashlyn died first.

295
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:24,770
Hmm. God, Death is
fucking complicated.

296
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:26,245
Ha ha!

297
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,373
No, you know what?
It's not complicated.

298
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:30,975
It's simple. People die.

299
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:32,417
That's just part of life.

300
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:35,217
150,000 people a day, actually.

301
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:37,155
You know? I mean...

302
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:39,216
we're biological entities,
and death is just...

303
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:41,557
- Top shelf.
- the end of biological function.

304
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:42,584
It's as simple as that.

305
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,971
How can you explain
what happened to us as simple?

306
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:53,802
I mean, if Wendy never had
that premonition...

307
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:56,332
and none of us had gotten off that ride,
we'd all be dead right now.

308
00:15:56,376 --> 00:15:58,708
- Does that not make sense to you?
- Oh, yeah.

309
00:15:58,745 --> 00:16:02,647
Kevin, how come when a guy dies
of a plain heart attack...

310
00:16:02,683 --> 00:16:04,310
no one goes, like...

311
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,479
"Oh, wow, he was
eating French toast...

312
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:09,318
"when Princess Diana
died in Paris...

313
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:12,519
"and then he saw her funeral on TV,
and now he's dead"?

314
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,083
You know why?
Because they'd sound crazy...

315
00:16:14,128 --> 00:16:17,586
so guess how you two
sound right now? Crazy.

316
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:20,031
Zip, I'm done.
So finish cutting those orders...

317
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,398
- so we can get out of here.
- OK!

318
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,405
Unh!

319
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,909
Heh heh!

320
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:28,366
Ugh!

321
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:29,993
Sick.

322
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:07,102
OK.

323
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,108
Let's go with
what you guys are saying.

324
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:10,439
Let's just say, you know...

325
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:12,910
that Death does have
a conscious plan...

326
00:18:12,946 --> 00:18:15,278
and that it's been
set into motion. Great.

327
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:18,478
So, Newton's third law of motion,
and, well, look...

328
00:18:18,518 --> 00:18:20,349
I'm just guessing
that it goes for Death, too...

329
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:22,217
when he's working in our world.

330
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:26,191
Newton says that every action
has an equal and opposite reaction.

331
00:18:26,226 --> 00:18:29,286
So, that means that...

332
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:33,231
if Death has taken action,
so can we.

333
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:35,461
And that that action
we take might have...

334
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:38,061
an opposite reaction
that thwarts Death's intent.

335
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:39,833
You're being a fucker, but go on.

336
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:42,739
OK. OK.

337
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:46,006
What if, for example...

338
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:50,846
the last in line were to make
the utilitarian choice...

339
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:53,345
Kill themselves.

340
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:57,955
Wow! Wow! That's pretty much
gonna ruin any plan...

341
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:00,687
that Death's put in motion.
And even better...

342
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:04,595
hey, it's gonna save
five skipped lives.

343
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:12,295
Any takers?

344
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:17,205
Nah, I didn't think so.

345
00:19:26,886 --> 00:19:28,353
There! Those!

346
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:33,587
Ugh!

347
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:34,991
Aah!

348
00:19:37,664 --> 00:19:39,222
Ooh!

349
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:47,528
Aah!

350
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,530
Unh! Unh!

351
00:19:51,744 --> 00:19:52,972
Unh!

352
00:20:06,225 --> 00:20:08,489
Aah!

353
00:20:27,246 --> 00:20:29,373
I didn't say anything.
I mean, I think...

354
00:20:29,415 --> 00:20:30,882
they were trying to scare us
into saying something...

355
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:32,908
but they had nothing
to keep me there.

356
00:20:32,952 --> 00:20:34,385
What'd you tell 'em?

357
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,650
Everything.
I didn't do anything.

358
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:38,486
I told them about
the pictures in the camera...

359
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:39,684
and Flight 180
and Frankie and Lewis...

360
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:42,092
and why we went to see
lan and Erin and...

361
00:20:42,128 --> 00:20:43,561
Did they believe you?

362
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:45,621
Yeah, right.
Would you believe me?

363
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:48,156
No, they looked at me
like I was crazy.

364
00:20:48,201 --> 00:20:50,635
10 hours they had us in there.

365
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,035
For all we know...

366
00:20:52,071 --> 00:20:53,936
whoever was sitting
behind Erin is already dead.

367
00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:55,531
And we're next.

368
00:20:55,575 --> 00:20:57,099
Now.

369
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:04,042
lan almost died first,
but we intervened.

370
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,450
So it skipped lan.
That's... that's how we regain control.

371
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:08,784
If someone intercedes...

372
00:21:08,821 --> 00:21:10,686
the life that was supposed
to be next is skipped.

373
00:21:10,723 --> 00:21:11,951
All right, wait, wait, wait.

374
00:21:11,991 --> 00:21:14,482
So, going by the way we sat
on the roller coaster...

375
00:21:15,962 --> 00:21:19,125
Well, I'm next... and then you.

376
00:21:19,165 --> 00:21:22,328
We can beat this.

377
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:25,132
We're so close.
We can't give up.

378
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:29,603
All right, my dad's here.
He's gonna give me a ride back.

379
00:21:29,642 --> 00:21:32,611
But are you sure
we shouldn't stick together?

380
00:21:32,645 --> 00:21:34,510
It's just for a couple of hours.

381
00:21:34,547 --> 00:21:35,536
All right? A couple of hours.

382
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:38,516
Go back, look at the pictures,
see if you can find any more clues...

383
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:42,282
and I'll ask everybody I see if they know
if anyone else got off the ride.

384
00:21:42,321 --> 00:21:44,380
OK?

385
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:49,024
Was there something
I should know about going?

386
00:21:50,863 --> 00:21:53,024
No, it's just...

387
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:55,556
I'll just be freaking out
every second...

388
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:57,535
hoping you're OK.

389
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,561
Why?

390
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,774
I mean,
we don't even like each other.

391
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:05,437
Heh.

392
00:22:06,512 --> 00:22:08,002
Come here.

393
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:14,246
OK?

394
00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:16,049
All right, I got my cell.

395
00:22:16,088 --> 00:22:17,385
OK.

396
00:22:35,507 --> 00:22:36,769
Hey, Wen?

397
00:22:36,808 --> 00:22:38,571
So we're meeting some guys
at that centennial thing...

398
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,774
and I could really use
my good-luck... bracelet.

399
00:22:59,598 --> 00:23:00,587
Mmm.

400
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,436
Huh.

401
00:23:43,675 --> 00:23:47,543
Hey, this is Julie.
Leave a message.

402
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:49,479
Call me on my cell right away.

403
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,282
Hello?

404
00:23:56,321 --> 00:23:58,221
Do you remember Julie
being on the roller coaster?

405
00:23:58,256 --> 00:24:00,087
What, your sister? No.

406
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,456
No, she would've said
something by now.

407
00:24:01,493 --> 00:24:03,051
The person sitting
behind lan and Erin...

408
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:04,722
was wearing the exact same
charm bracelet...

409
00:24:04,763 --> 00:24:06,492
our grandmother gave her.

410
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:08,522
Amber or Perry
were probably with her...

411
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:10,296
so they're next.

412
00:24:10,335 --> 00:24:11,700
I gotta find Julie.

413
00:24:11,737 --> 00:24:12,829
She went to
the tricentennial thing.

414
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:14,862
Well, l... I'm here now,
working security.

415
00:24:14,906 --> 00:24:16,533
I'll start looking for her.

416
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:18,509
- I'm on my way.
- Wen, wait.

417
00:24:18,543 --> 00:24:20,238
Look, after them, we're next.

418
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:22,542
So in case somethin'
happens to 'em...

419
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:24,242
before we meet up...

420
00:24:24,282 --> 00:24:26,011
remember that time
we talked about?

421
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:27,746
When to look at our pictures?

422
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:29,515
It's now.

423
00:24:39,097 --> 00:24:40,826
Great. Mine has no clue.

424
00:24:40,866 --> 00:24:43,630
It's just me standing in front of
a blank background...

425
00:24:43,668 --> 00:24:46,034
with Jason at
the amusement park.

426
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:49,040
Wait. McKinley.

427
00:24:49,074 --> 00:24:52,168
lan? Is he in the picture?

428
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,805
No, but it... it feels like a clue.

429
00:24:57,082 --> 00:24:59,414
And yours is the picture
that I took...

430
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:01,180
when I flashed the camera
in your face.

431
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:05,178
It's all out of focus
and overexposed, like...

432
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:12,457
Like a firework
went off in my face?

433
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:41,186
# There is someone #

434
00:25:41,226 --> 00:25:44,354
# Walking behind you #

435
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:50,830
# Look at me #

436
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:52,700
# There is someone #

437
00:25:52,737 --> 00:25:56,639
# Watching your footsteps #

438
00:25:59,377 --> 00:26:01,277
# Look at me #

439
00:26:02,881 --> 00:26:06,248
# There is someone #

440
00:26:06,284 --> 00:26:08,514
# Who really loves you #

441
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:10,680
The British are coming!
The British are coming!

442
00:26:10,722 --> 00:26:13,247
- Whoo!
- Yay!

443
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:14,883
Get 'em while they're hot!

444
00:26:19,598 --> 00:26:21,759
Take it to those Redcoats!

445
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,098
Column, advance!

446
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:38,047
The kite is aloft.

447
00:26:39,517 --> 00:26:42,315
Now, let us hope
for some lightning.

448
00:26:42,354 --> 00:26:44,914
Fuck you, Ben Franklin.

449
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:56,361
But he kept insisting.
"Get over here," right?

450
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,663
This is awesome, dude!

451
00:27:00,705 --> 00:27:01,967
Heh heh.

452
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:03,372
Whoa. Hey!

453
00:27:03,408 --> 00:27:04,841
Ha ha! Come on!

454
00:27:04,876 --> 00:27:06,867
Hey, get out of here with those, man!
You're gonna set these off!

455
00:27:06,912 --> 00:27:08,379
Hurry, dude.

456
00:27:08,413 --> 00:27:09,812
Come on, man, let's go!
Hurry up!

457
00:27:11,316 --> 00:27:15,047
Ladies and gentlemen,
to celebrate McKinley's tricentennial...

458
00:27:15,086 --> 00:27:17,816
the fireworks extravaganza
will begin shortly.

459
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:24,485
Oh, my God. Julie.

460
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:25,496
- What?
- Look.

461
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,430
There's Kahlil.

462
00:27:27,465 --> 00:27:29,057
Should we?

463
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,761
Hey, guys. I'm sorry,
but you can't be here, OK?

464
00:27:30,802 --> 00:27:33,100
The viewing site is over there.
You too, sir. Come on.

465
00:27:33,138 --> 00:27:34,969
They're not gonna
make us move, are they?

466
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:36,598
I don't fucking believe them.

467
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:39,132
- OK, we gotta clear out.
- Mm-hm.

468
00:27:45,717 --> 00:27:47,207
Excuse me.

469
00:28:12,344 --> 00:28:13,868
- Ladies.
- Boys.

470
00:28:13,912 --> 00:28:14,901
What's going on?

471
00:28:16,114 --> 00:28:17,945
Hey, Julie.

472
00:28:17,983 --> 00:28:20,417
- You three need to come with me.
- What did we do?

473
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:22,147
Look, it's for your own safety,
Julie, all right?

474
00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:24,018
I'll tell you about it as soon as
we get away from here, OK?

475
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:25,886
Let go of me!

476
00:28:25,924 --> 00:28:26,982
Julie.

477
00:28:27,025 --> 00:28:28,219
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

478
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:29,419
Julie!

479
00:28:57,222 --> 00:28:58,246
Heh heh heh!

480
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,224
- Sweet.
- Ha ha!

481
00:29:04,496 --> 00:29:05,485
Yeah!

482
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,095
Light it! Light it!
Go, go, go, man!

483
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,637
Julie!

484
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:22,903
Uh! Oh!

485
00:29:27,318 --> 00:29:28,876
- Oh, shit!
- Dude, we gotta bail!

486
00:29:43,368 --> 00:29:44,665
- Aah!
- Unh!

487
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:47,034
Unh! Hey!

488
00:29:48,506 --> 00:29:51,703
Julie! No, wait, wait.

489
00:29:51,743 --> 00:29:54,211
You're in danger, OK?
I'm trying to explain something.

490
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:56,975
Let me explain this to you.

491
00:30:00,885 --> 00:30:02,318
Julie, look out!

492
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:05,485
- Aah!
- Unh!

493
00:30:07,025 --> 00:30:08,822
Aah!

494
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,952
Julie!

495
00:30:10,962 --> 00:30:12,486
Unh!

496
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,361
Aah! Unh!

497
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:17,791
Cut him off!

498
00:30:22,707 --> 00:30:24,004
Unh!

499
00:30:25,577 --> 00:30:26,566
Aah!

500
00:30:29,848 --> 00:30:30,837
Aah!

501
00:30:33,318 --> 00:30:34,717
Aah!

502
00:30:42,227 --> 00:30:43,558
OK, OK.

503
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,295
Stay back! He's dangerous!

504
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:51,861
I got him.

505
00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:54,098
- Just let me go.
- No, Julie.

506
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:55,333
You have to tell me,
you have to listen.

507
00:30:55,373 --> 00:30:57,637
Tell me who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

508
00:30:57,675 --> 00:30:59,540
Oh, my God,
Julie, are you all right?

509
00:31:01,246 --> 00:31:02,543
Listen to me!
You have to tell me...

510
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,445
who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

511
00:31:04,482 --> 00:31:06,882
Who? She's next!

512
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:13,151
Aah!

513
00:31:25,503 --> 00:31:26,834
Kevin.

514
00:31:36,915 --> 00:31:38,405
Aah!

515
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:40,110
Fire!

516
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:42,346
Kevin.

517
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:45,914
You saved my life.

518
00:31:51,629 --> 00:31:53,028
Thanks for that, McKinley.

519
00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:55,032
- Shut up, McKinley!
- No!

520
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:56,533
We have to get out of here now.

521
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:57,728
What's the deal?

522
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:00,363
lan McKinley.
He causes my death.

523
00:32:00,405 --> 00:32:02,532
In my picture I was wearing
the McKinley grad night shirt.

524
00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:04,337
- He's the clue.
- What?

525
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,366
There's a first aid tent,
there should be security.

526
00:32:08,546 --> 00:32:10,514
Get the fuck outta here, McKinley!

527
00:32:10,548 --> 00:32:14,609
Hey, I'm just celebrating
our town's tricentennial.

528
00:32:17,722 --> 00:32:18,780
You followed me!

529
00:32:18,823 --> 00:32:20,723
Oh! You are paranoid.

530
00:32:20,758 --> 00:32:22,817
But, hey, I saw what happened.

531
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,624
You're next, right?
You're the end of it, aren't you?

532
00:32:25,663 --> 00:32:27,062
Man, I would be paranoid, too.

533
00:32:27,098 --> 00:32:28,895
You didn't even believe me!

534
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:31,993
Yeah, well, seeing is believing.

535
00:32:32,036 --> 00:32:33,731
Then you have
to stay away from me!

536
00:32:33,771 --> 00:32:37,002
"Have to"?
Wow, that's extreme.

537
00:32:41,713 --> 00:32:43,840
Oh, no way.

538
00:32:45,516 --> 00:32:47,211
Do I cause your death?

539
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,820
Just like you caused Erin's?

540
00:32:51,856 --> 00:32:53,847
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, what? What?

541
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:56,758
You have a vision? Was I in it?

542
00:32:56,794 --> 00:32:58,694
Was I in a picture?

543
00:33:00,965 --> 00:33:03,399
Just tell me how to start it off!

544
00:33:03,434 --> 00:33:06,096
Let's get this over with!

545
00:33:06,137 --> 00:33:08,867
You'll save me
if you just stay away!

546
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,203
Then it'll all be over!

547
00:33:10,241 --> 00:33:13,210
What do I care? It skipped me.

548
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:15,041
For me, it is over.
I'm not dying.

549
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:17,946
I'm not dying!

550
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:30,154
Ha ha ha!

551
00:33:30,194 --> 00:33:32,253
You see?

552
00:33:32,297 --> 00:33:33,559
I'm not gonna die!

553
00:33:33,598 --> 00:33:35,896
It's you, Wendy! You're dead!

554
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:14,731
# Came back down
from this fight #

555
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:16,261
- Hi!
- # Will get ya deeper #

556
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:17,671
# And make you right #

557
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:18,731
Thank you.

558
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:21,539
# Bruno's drops
threaten her... #

559
00:34:21,578 --> 00:34:22,806
Wait, what about
that great curry place?

560
00:34:22,846 --> 00:34:24,245
Don't we get off at Booth?

561
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:26,146
Oh, you mean Gupta's.
You get off at Oswald.

562
00:34:26,182 --> 00:34:27,740
Oh, that's right.

563
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:31,453
You know, if I can't be home
for Thanksgiving...

564
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:34,251
I need some semblance
of a traditional dinner.

565
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:36,484
Turkey, stuffing, pie.

566
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:38,055
If you don't have turkey
for one Thanksgiving...

567
00:34:38,093 --> 00:34:39,720
is that really gonna kill you?

568
00:34:40,729 --> 00:34:43,857
# There is someone #

569
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:47,356
# Walking behind you #

570
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:50,701
# Turn around #

571
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:54,436
# Look at me #

572
00:34:54,476 --> 00:34:57,843
# There is someone #

573
00:34:57,879 --> 00:35:01,747
# Watching your footsteps #

574
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:03,045
# Turn around #

575
00:35:10,592 --> 00:35:13,857
# There is someone #

576
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:18,025
# Who really needs you #

577
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:20,933
# Here's my heart #

578
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:52,691
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

579
00:35:55,503 --> 00:35:56,868
This is Booth Street.

580
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:01,342
Next stop is Oswald.
End of the line.

581
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:05,437
The next stop
is the end of the line.

582
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:09,245
Wendy! Next stop after this.

583
00:36:09,284 --> 00:36:11,548
- Let's just walk.
- It's freezing out.

584
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,213
Yeah, but the air'll feel good.

585
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:16,018
I could use some air.

586
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,120
Yeah!

587
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:22,390
Ha ha ha! Yeah, man!

588
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,761
All right, man. See ya.

589
00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:24,822
Let's go, Bruins!

590
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:25,855
Bruins, yeah!

591
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:43,273
Hey, man, peace out!

592
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:44,842
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

593
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:47,286
- Watch out!
- Hey, Bruins!

594
00:36:47,322 --> 00:36:49,313
You missed the beginning.
Did you see that?

595
00:36:49,357 --> 00:36:50,483
This is it!

596
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:54,154
Yo, comin' through. Excuse me.

597
00:36:56,197 --> 00:36:58,131
Oh, my God.

598
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,899
I can't believe this. Here.

599
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,608
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

600
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,304
I thought you weren't
coming till tonight.

601
00:37:10,345 --> 00:37:12,779
Well, Dad's car just, like,
dies out of nowhere...

602
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,611
and he couldn't get it fixed
anywhere on a holiday...

603
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,014
so instead of sitting around
for a few hours...

604
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,984
I lucked out and caught
an early train.

605
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:19,782
I hope I'm not messing you up or...

606
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,982
No, no, it's just, um...

607
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:25,754
I think I had a sense
that you were coming now.

608
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,098
I was just...

609
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:35,466
I was feeling like I did that night.

610
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:38,462
No. No, it's over.

611
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,373
You, me, Kevin went over
a thousand scenarios.

612
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:42,706
lan was gonna cause your death...

613
00:37:42,744 --> 00:37:44,541
you intervened,
and it skipped us.

614
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:53,949
Look, I'm not worried.

615
00:37:53,988 --> 00:37:56,923
I ran into Kevin at home.
He's not worried.

616
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:58,220
And, if I were you...

617
00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:00,625
until something happens
to me and then Kevin...

618
00:38:00,662 --> 00:38:02,289
you've got nothing
to worry about.

619
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:05,462
You're right.

620
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,331
Uhh.

621
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,529
Hey, l... I want you to meet
my roommate and my friend, OK?

622
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,662
Yeah.

623
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:14,006
Hey, guys. This is Julie, my...

624
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:27,985
What are you doing here?

625
00:38:28,022 --> 00:38:30,217
Wendy! Julie!

626
00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:32,158
What are the chances?

627
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:33,558
How long have you been
on this train?

628
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:35,186
Uh, since home.

629
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,060
I was headin' up
to check out the game.

630
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:38,656
I was gonna look you up
afterwards.

631
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:42,497
You OK?

632
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,300
Is something wrong?

633
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:53,903
Aah!

634
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,920
Aah!

635
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:14,429
Aah!

636
00:39:17,005 --> 00:39:19,701
- Aah!
- Unh!

637
00:39:22,243 --> 00:39:24,234
- Julie, stay down!
- Aah!

638
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,508
Julie!

639
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:27,536
Aah!

640
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:34,154
- Kevin!
- Unh!

641
00:39:35,757 --> 00:39:36,849
Aaaaaah!

642
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:39,690
Oh, God!

643
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:40,853
Aah!

644
00:39:41,863 --> 00:39:44,263
Aah!

645
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:33,071
Aah! Unh!

646
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,194
No!

00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:58,535
I was gonna look you up

You OK?

649
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,533
Is somethin' wrong?

650
00:41:04,612 --> 00:41:06,807
The train...

651
00:41:06,848 --> 00:41:09,874
Oh, shit. Not again.

00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:11,509
We gotta get out!

653
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,578
It's not working.
Somebody stop the train!
