Grant us. Lord.

15
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:22,593
the wisdom and the grace
to use aright the time

16
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,156
that is left to us
here on earth.

17
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:28,064
Lead us to repent
of our sins.

18
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:32,199
the evil we have done,
and the good we have not done,

19
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:35,813
and strengthen us to follow
the steps of your son

20
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:40,007
in the way that leads
to the fullness of eternal life

Amen.

Bastard.

24
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:09,667
Still owes me
for a lobster.

25
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,563
It's like
that David Bowie film.

26
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:19,813
<i>The Man Who Fell to Earth.</i>

27
00:04:19,852 --> 00:04:21,161
No, it's not.

28
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,781
Trevethan jumped out of a plane
without a parachute.

29
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:25,346
In the film. David Bowie
was an alien.

30
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:26,881
Is an alien.

31
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:28,833
Oh, don't start
with that bollocks.

32
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,850
There are many people
in showbiz

33
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:32,265
who are from off world.

34
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:34,982
Have you ever looked
into David Bowie's eyes?

35
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:36,546
Well,
by that same token,

36
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:38,375
you could say that Charlie
was an alien.

37
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,785
Exactly.

38
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:43,817
Charlie, more wine?
Thanks, Grace.

39
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:47,495
House looks lovely.
Oh, thank you.

40
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:48,459
Morris?

41
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:49,702
Yes, thank you.

42
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:52,773
Thank you, Grace, yes.

43
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:54,185
Thank you, Grace.

44
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:58,852
Tongue.

45
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:00,385
There's sausage rolls
in the kitchen.

46
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:02,086
Thank you.
Wash your hands.

47
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:03,268
Okay.

48
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:06,500
Grace, who you
looking for?

49
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,052
Um oh, Matthew,
there you are.

50
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:12,480
Would you check
the humidifier in the greenhouse?

51
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:14,498
I completely forgot.

52
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:18,336
It's done. I did it yesterday
when you asked me.

53
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:20,354
Don't know what
I'd do without him.

54
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:26,601
What kind of injuries
would someone have

55
00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:28,162
if they fell
from that height?

56
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,025
Very bad ones.

57
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:31,750
Why did he do it?

58
00:05:31,787 --> 00:05:33,478
We don't really know.

59
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:35,904
Perhaps he thought he was
going to the bathroom,

60
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:38,053
and he picked
the wrong door?

61
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:41,407
Yes, very likely.
Would you excuse me?

62
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,571
I'm gonna get you!
No, you're not.

63
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:50,088
Matt...
have you got any?

64
00:05:50,123 --> 00:05:51,781
No.
There's none about.

65
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,313
Matthew...?

66
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:56,196
All right, come on.
Thank you.

67
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:04,967
She's not here,
Grace.

68
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:06,464
Who's not here?

69
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:09,126
She left just after
the service.

70
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:12,583
Did you talk to her?

71
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:13,764
No.

72
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:24,453
Do you think
she'll leave?

73
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:26,084
She loves it here.

74
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:28,992
Diana seems to think it was
some sort of accident,

75
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:31,653
that he was just looking
for the lavatory.

76
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,408
I imagine he went
on the way down.

77
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:37,411
This the last of it?

78
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:38,563
Enjoy.

79
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:41,058
It's gonna be a long.
cold winter.

80
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:41,928
All right,
Alfred?

81
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:43,938
Ah, hello,
Dr. Bamford.

82
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:44,961
Hi, Matthew.

83
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:48,134
I wonder if you could
do me a favor, Doctor?

84
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:49,829
My ear needs to be
looked at again.

85
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,577
It's still...
still giving a chirp.

86
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:55,945
Is it all right I p
into the surgery tomorrow?

87
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:57,921
Okay.

88
00:06:57,963 --> 00:06:59,653
Well, I'd better
be off.

89
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:03,335
There's reports of salmon
poachers out on the estuary.

90
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:09,249
You all right?

91
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:12,806
You have no idea.

92
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:24,517
My mum wanted to get one
of those dishwashers.

93
00:07:24,555 --> 00:07:27,108
My dad said, No,
she's already got one.

94
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,129
Him.

95
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:36,425
If there's anything I can do,
Grace around the house.

96
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:39,208
Yes, well, everyone's
been very kind, but...

97
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:42,756
but really... I'm fine.

98
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,388
Here, look, I'll do that
No, it's

99
00:07:45,387 --> 00:07:46,664
Harvey!

100
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,187
I'm fine.

101
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:50,634
Right O

102
00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:41,643
Good morning,
Matthew.

103
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:42,820
Hiya.

104
00:08:46,315 --> 00:08:48,420
Hello, Joyce.
Good morning, Grace.

105
00:08:55,307 --> 00:08:57,762
Good morning. Tom.
Hello, Grace.

106
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:04,261
Hello, ladies.

107
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,837
Morning, Grace.

108
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,875
I'd like a packet
of paracetamol,

109
00:09:15,915 --> 00:09:17,703
and I'd like to settle
my account.

110
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:21,536
Oh, no.
We've... lost our accounts.

111
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:22,561
Why don't you pay us
next month?

112
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,912
Lost the accounts?

113
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:26,532
It's very mysterious.

114
00:09:27,531 --> 00:09:30,051
Well. I'll just take
the paracetamol.

115
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,203
Here's some.

116
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:32,934
How much is that?

117
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,386
Oh, five pence.

118
00:09:38,507 --> 00:09:39,849
Special offer.

119
00:09:42,987 --> 00:09:44,513
Thank you.

120
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:48,065
Right.
Thank you.

121
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:50,179
Bye bye now.
Bye bye.

122
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:25,832
I can extend
the overdraft a bit.

123
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:27,689
And maybe you can
find out if there's

124
00:10:27,723 --> 00:10:29,610
a life insurance policy?

125
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:30,985
Investments?

126
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,889
I don't understand.
This must be a mistake.

127
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:36,516
Your late husband
used the house

128
00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:39,457
as an asset
to raise capital.

129
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:42,434
As you have no children,
you'll inherit the estate,

130
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,377
but you'll also inherit
the mortgage.

131
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:47,329
Well, that's fine.
The house is 300 years old.

132
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:49,345
The mortgage must be
paid off by now.

133
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:51,012
You don't
understand.

134
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,734
He used the house
as collateral

135
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,640
for loans to finance
business deals,

136
00:10:56,683 --> 00:10:59,912
none of which
actually took off.

137
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:01,987
Well, what about
the money he left me?

138
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:04,002
There isn't any.

139
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:07,523
And... then there are
the mortgage payments.

140
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:09,253
How much are they?

141
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,396
L2.000 a month.

142
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,974
I'll be up
your flue in a minute or two,

143
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:50,499
'cause I know where
to find it.

144
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:54,400
Hey, how are
you doing?

145
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,388
Matthew...

146
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:58,150
I've got some bad news.
I'm afraid.

147
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:59,561
I know.

148
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:09,766
Have you tried plant food?
Tried everything.

149
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:12,071
They're dying on purpose.
I even talk to them.

150
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,994
What do you say?
Would you mind not dying?

151
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,936
You really are
a crap gardener, Matthew.

152
00:12:15,978 --> 00:12:18,531
What do I know about plants?
I'm from Glasgow.

153
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,480
I hate this.
I really hate this.

154
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:21,799
Well. somebody
else do it.

155
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,012
We're sea pele.

156
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,222
He's not.
He's a doctor.

157
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:26,917
I don't have
a fabulous track record

158
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,613
when it comes
to keeping things alive.

159
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,112
It's like the signs.

160
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:32,010
What signs?

161
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,377
Armageddon

162
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,712
Final conflict.

163
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:38,175
A man falls from the sky,

164
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:41,066
You lose your job,
and all the plants are dying.

165
00:12:42,954 --> 00:12:45,475
I meant to do that.

166
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,832
Do you have
a stock portfollo, perhaps?

167
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:52,901
What's that?
I don't know.

168
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,110
I just thought
you might have one.

169
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:57,252
Well. No, there's
nothing like that.

170
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,324
It's just bills
and letters of credit.

171
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,625
I don't understand this.
There are accounts here

172
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,026
for companies I've never
even heard of.

173
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:09,736
We've got a Swiss
bank account.

174
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:12,586
There's nothing in it,
but we do have one.

175
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:13,796
Hmm...

176
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,907
I'm sure
there's something...

177
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:18,401
tucked away... somewhere.

178
00:13:18,443 --> 00:13:20,265
Yeah. well. that's
what I thought, Gerald.

179
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:24,838
but, no.
There's not.

180
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,336
There's nothing.

181
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:30,879
What in God's name
am I going to do?

182
00:13:57,674 --> 00:14:00,008
You all right?
You look peaked.

183
00:14:00,043 --> 00:14:02,978
Fine. I'm...
just a bit hung over.

184
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:05,223
Did we drink that much?
I can't remember.

185
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:07,397
Uhh...

186
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:10,118
God. you're really ill.
You never get hangovers.

187
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:12,064
I'll be fine
once I get on the boat.

188
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:13,568
I don't think you
should go to work.

189
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,520
I think you should
see the doctor.

190
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:20,227
I can't see anyone
without an appointment.

191
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:23,714
Tea?
Yes. please.

192
00:14:24,874 --> 00:14:28,649
Hey, what are you doing?
Get off of there!

193
00:14:28,683 --> 00:14:30,177
Given your recent troubles.

194
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:32,323
we rather thought
you'd want to cancel.

195
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:34,501
It's only a tea party.
We could have it anywhere.

196
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:37,026
But we always
have it here.

197
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,757
It's tradition.

198
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,999
I've been working
on a new hybrid

199
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:45,028
Phalansis pathedilum.
It's beautiful.

200
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:47,653
All right, ladies.
back to business.

201
00:14:47,691 --> 00:14:50,211
Do we invite Dr. Bamford.

202
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:52,869
given his disgraceful
display last year?

203
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,615
No!

204
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,066
Come on. sir,
off the mower!

205
00:14:57,098 --> 00:14:58,887
What's going on?

206
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:02,599
Afternoon. Mrs. Trevethan.
Hello, Bob, Terry.

207
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,682
How's your mum's hip?

208
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:05,664
Oh. much better,
thanks.

209
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:07,779
They want to take
the lawn mower.

210
00:15:09,194 --> 00:15:11,911
Well. it's not us.
It's the finance company.

211
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:13,922
There haven't been
any payments.

212
00:15:16,171 --> 00:15:18,407
Well. you better
take it, then.

213
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,290
I'm really sorry.

214
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:49,282
Matthew.

215
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,849
Matthew, you don't
have to do this.

216
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:52,298
It's allright.

217
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,501
You've paid me
to the end of the week.

218
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:57,735
I don't believe he even lied
about the lawn mower.

219
00:15:59,435 --> 00:16:01,736
He lied
about everything.

220
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:13,347
Couldn't you
get a job?

221
00:16:14,347 --> 00:16:15,841
What could I do?

222
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:17,224
Well.
you could...

223
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:20,256
You want a cup of tea
or something?

224
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:22,153
No, thank you.

225
00:16:22,186 --> 00:16:26,441
Matthew... I'm really
sorry about your job.

226
00:16:26,474 --> 00:16:28,481
Oh. that's
all right.

227
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,857
You're gonna have
to get a goat.

228
00:16:31,946 --> 00:16:33,768
If there's anything
else I can do?

229
00:16:33,802 --> 00:16:35,711
Actually, I was hing
you would say that.

230
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:37,031
Why?

231
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:41,223
Grace, you are the best
gardener in the world.

232
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:43,680
I've got some plants
that are really sick.

233
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:47,814
They desperately need help.
Well. where are they?

234
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:51,266
What?

235
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:59,776
Ah hhgh!

236
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:11,433
Shh.

237
00:17:13,803 --> 00:17:15,232
Why are you
whispering?

238
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,446
I don't want to wake up
any squirrels. Just through here.

239
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:19,206
In here.

240
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:20,736
Are these
Gerald's plants?

241
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:23,266
No, no.
They're mine.

242
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:25,314
I think I may have
overwatered them.

243
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:31,172
I'm not stupid.
Matthew.

244
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,992
I know what this is.

245
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:35,587
What is it?

246
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:37,219
Hemp.

247
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:38,469
Is it?

248
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:40,577
Aye, it's hemp.

249
00:17:40,618 --> 00:17:42,473
Well. they're not
getting enough light.

250
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:44,329
They're never going
to grow in the dark.

251
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,185
I didn't really want
anybody to see them.

252
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:47,712
Well. you wouldn't,
would you?

253
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:49,510
No.

254
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:51,139
Now, if you want
these poor things to grow,

255
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:53,447
they need some decent soil
and some better light,

256
00:17:53,482 --> 00:17:55,369
Okay, thanks.

257
00:18:00,586 --> 00:18:01,993
Come on. then...

258
00:18:02,026 --> 00:18:04,001
Let's take one back
to the greenhouse,

259
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:04,936
see what we can do.

260
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,141
You may not
want to do that.

261
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:10,527
I'm a gardener.
These are sick plants.

262
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,807
All right.

263
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:23,847
Come on!
Quick, quick!

264
00:18:23,882 --> 00:18:25,825
Where have you been?

265
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:28,834
It's brilliant, Nicky.
I've saved the plants.

266
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,500
How?
I called in an expert.

267
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:31,487
Who?

268
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,115
The best gardener
in the world.

269
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,102
Grace.

270
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:36,128
Grace?

271
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:37,665
Yeah. It's fantastic.
She's doing it

272
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:39,429
as compensation for
having to lay me off.

273
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:42,084
Isn't that nice?
I don't know.

274
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,584
What do you mean.
you don't know?

275
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:47,204
Hasn't she got enough problems
without getting into drugs?

276
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:48,703
What are you talking
about, drugs ??

277
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:50,786
Matthew, you know
what I'm talking about.

278
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:52,615
It's still illegal.

279
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,781
She's very vulnerable
just now.

280
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:58,153
He you're not
taking advantage of her.

281
00:18:58,186 --> 00:19:00,455
I'm doing this for us!

282
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,694
Is this your way
of saying thanks?

283
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,159
No.

284
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:06,591
I've got
a much better way.

285
00:19:07,851 --> 00:19:10,240
Congratulations.
Mr. Stewart.

286
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:14,722
You are tonight's
lucky Scotsman.

287
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:40,714
Well. I either am
or I'm not.

288
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:44,773
No, no, you definitely
are pregnant indeed.

289
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,752
Is that a good thing?

290
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:49,282
Yes.

291
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,362
Yeah.
it's brilllant.

292
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:54,250
Any idea
who the father is?

293
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:56,519
I think Iknow.
I looked at the test slldes.

294
00:19:56,555 --> 00:19:58,562
Some of the chromosomes
had littlekilts on them.

295
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:01,024
Very funny.

296
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,521
I do have
some bad news. though.

297
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:05,253
What?

298
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,712
There's a slight risk
of ginger hair.

299
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:11,072
Piss off.

300
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:12,575
How are
all our plants doing?

301
00:20:12,618 --> 00:20:14,025
Oh. um...

302
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:16,392
He's called in
an expert.

303
00:20:16,426 --> 00:20:19,459
Oh. Sounds good.

304
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:21,986
Look, don't mention
the baby yet, okay?

305
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:23,553
I just want
to tell him

306
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:25,088
when the time
is right.

307
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,203
What baby?

308
00:20:27,242 --> 00:20:28,703
Have a sweetie.

309
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,854
Will she live,
Doctor?

310
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,417
I think so.

311
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:39,306
Where did these seeds
come from?

312
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,647
Guy in a pub
in Bodmin.

313
00:20:40,682 --> 00:20:41,543
No.

314
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,335
I mean.
what kind are they?

315
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,120
Oh. They're indica
sativa hybrids.

316
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:49,253
Purple haze with early pearl
crossed with ruderalls.

317
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,145
Yes. well. anyway,
they're designed to grow

318
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,218
in a very sunny climate.

319
00:20:53,258 --> 00:20:54,468
If you say so.

320
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:57,474
Is it the bud
the bit you're after?

321
00:20:57,514 --> 00:20:59,041
Yeah.

322
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:02,346
Look.

323
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:08,096
What is it?

324
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:10,560
That's the start
of a new bud.

325
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:14,310
You did that
in 24 hours?

326
00:21:14,346 --> 00:21:17,761
You're a witch.
Oh. it's not me, really.

327
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:19,875
It's just a question
of having enough light.

328
00:21:19,914 --> 00:21:22,532
No light, no buds.
Simple.

329
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,497
Yes?

330
00:21:26,538 --> 00:21:28,546
Hello. Is it all right
if I park there?

331
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:29,895
Yes.
Dogs?

332
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,457
Dogs?

333
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,189
Dogs.
Do you have dogs?

334
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:36,128
Postmen and surveyors.
irresistible to our canine friends.

335
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,544
No, there's no dogs.
Good o.

336
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:39,945
Oh. yes. yes. yes.
Fabulous home.

337
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:41,255
Can I help you?

338
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,251
No, no. I'm fine on me own.
Tea's always nice.

339
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,567
I'm sorry, I don'tknow
why you're here.

340
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:47,715
I think you've come
to the wrong house.

341
00:21:47,754 --> 00:21:50,656
Oh. I'm sorry.
NigeI Plimpton.

342
00:21:50,699 --> 00:21:53,154
Trevethan?
Liac house?

343
00:21:53,194 --> 00:21:56,293
Evaluation for Ramptons
Re debts Outstanding?

344
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,646
It's standard procedure before
a house is put up for auction.

345
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,217
But the house
isn't up for auction.

346
00:22:01,258 --> 00:22:02,186
Ah...

347
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:05,317
Well. I'm afraid
it will be.

348
00:22:05,354 --> 00:22:07,907
U h. here, look.

349
00:22:07,946 --> 00:22:09,768
Pele in... your position

350
00:22:09,802 --> 00:22:11,711
often st ening
their mail.

351
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:15,202
so I'm the first real proof
it's all happening.

352
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,926
I think I'd like you
to leave, please.

353
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,864
Well. I'm sorry.
I can't.

354
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,401
I really must
do this.

355
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:25,027
I'd like you
to leave as well.

356
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,926
Call the office
to reschedule.

357
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,445
Thank you.

358
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,370
Ramptons is an enormous
investment trust.

359
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:45,127
John's syndicate
took a huge tumble.

360
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:46,307
I had no idea

361
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:48,168
he had business interests
in the city.

362
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,111
Yes. but how much
do I owe them?

363
00:22:50,154 --> 00:22:52,129
If you don't pay
the money owing.

364
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,658
they can claim
any or all

365
00:22:54,698 --> 00:22:56,869
of your assets.

366
00:22:56,906 --> 00:22:59,110
And this. of course,
would include

367
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:00,902
the house.

368
00:23:00,938 --> 00:23:04,167
How much
do I owe them. Melvyn?

369
00:23:04,202 --> 00:23:06,439
£300.000.

370
00:23:07,498 --> 00:23:08,960
Approximately.

371
00:23:48,714 --> 00:23:50,689
Bastard.

372
00:24:40,074 --> 00:24:41,481
Matthew?

373
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:42,441
Yeah?

374
00:24:42,474 --> 00:24:46,468
You know that plant
I'm looking after for you?

375
00:24:46,506 --> 00:24:48,131
U h huh.

376
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,348
How much
is it worth?

377
00:24:49,386 --> 00:24:51,525
Oh. it hasn't died.
has it?

378
00:24:51,562 --> 00:24:53,351
No, no, no.
It's thriving.

379
00:24:53,386 --> 00:24:55,012
I just, um...

380
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,384
wondered how much
you'd get for it.

381
00:24:57,418 --> 00:24:59,327
Ounce for ounce,

382
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:01,639
the really good stuff's
worth more than gold.

383
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,498
Greenhouse.
Now!

384
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,466
Okay.

385
00:25:08,746 --> 00:25:10,601
Here's what I think.

386
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:12,488
We take cuttings
from the mother plant,

387
00:25:12,522 --> 00:25:14,594
root the cuttings and grow them
under lights. hydronically,

388
00:25:14,634 --> 00:25:16,128
go straight to budding.

389
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,861
We could have the first
harvest in a matter of weeks.

390
00:25:17,898 --> 00:25:20,287
I could clear what you need
in the first run. probably more.

391
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,857
Could do it
in the time you've got.

392
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:24,615
You haven't given it
any thought, then?

393
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,619
You can't tell anybody.

394
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:31,968
All things bright
and beautiful

395
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:36,614
All creatures
great and small...

396
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,904
It's just started.

397
00:25:39,946 --> 00:25:41,407
We've got at least
an hour.

398
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,509
...the Lord God
made them all...

399
00:25:49,418 --> 00:25:50,847
Sorry.

400
00:26:14,026 --> 00:26:16,360
Oh. do be reasonable.

401
00:26:16,394 --> 00:26:18,849
That piece
is worth that alone.

402
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,646
I'm being very fair,
Mrs. T.

403
00:26:20,682 --> 00:26:22,143
Very good price
I'm giving you.

404
00:26:22,185 --> 00:26:24,160
Well.
it's daylight robbery.

405
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:26,536
What else have you got?

406
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,774
Come up and see me

407
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:33,349
make me smile

408
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:35,208
I'll do what you want

409
00:26:35,242 --> 00:26:39,715
running wild...

410
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:43,302
There's nothing left

411
00:26:43,338 --> 00:26:47,681
all gone and run away

412
00:26:47,722 --> 00:26:50,056
Maybe you'll tarry

413
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,999
for a while...

414
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:53,667
Is it this
blue one, Jack?

415
00:26:53,706 --> 00:26:54,786
That's right.

416
00:26:54,825 --> 00:26:56,680
It's just a test

417
00:26:56,714 --> 00:26:59,048
a game for us to play...

418
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:01,187
Hi. Grace.

419
00:27:01,226 --> 00:27:02,982
Hello, Nicky.

420
00:27:03,018 --> 00:27:04,479
I haven't seen you
for days.

421
00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:08,198
You okay?
Yes. Busy.

422
00:27:08,234 --> 00:27:09,761
What are you doing?

423
00:27:09,802 --> 00:27:13,696
Building a fence,
keep out the rabbits.

424
00:27:13,738 --> 00:27:15,712
With electrical wire?

425
00:27:15,754 --> 00:27:17,379
It's electric fence.

426
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:20,865
Okay. Is Matt
up at the house?

427
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,694
It's just I've got to
see him about something.

428
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,355
No, he's out.
He's...

429
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,281
looking for a transformer...

430
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:28,583
for the electric fence.

431
00:27:28,618 --> 00:27:31,106
If you do see him.
will you tell him

432
00:27:31,146 --> 00:27:32,902
that I'll meet him
in the pub at 7:00?

433
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:34,148
Yeah. righty o.

434
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,618
Bye bye.

435
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,730
Bye.

436
00:27:47,786 --> 00:27:49,160
Good book, is it?

437
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:55,360
Oh. Jackie Colllns.

438
00:27:55,401 --> 00:27:57,768
I'm reading a kafka
at the moment.

439
00:27:57,802 --> 00:28:00,006
Not very funny.

440
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:01,471
Except the one
about that bloke

441
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,862
that turns into a beetle.
That's a bit wacky.

442
00:28:04,905 --> 00:28:07,077
Wouldn't get anybody
turning into a beetle

443
00:28:07,114 --> 00:28:09,056
in a Jackie Colllns.

444
00:28:09,097 --> 00:28:11,650
Might get someone
sleeping with a beetle.

445
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,170
He wrapped her up

446
00:28:15,209 --> 00:28:18,243
in his stick like arms.
all six of them.

447
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:22,079
tapping her sensuously
on the head

448
00:28:22,122 --> 00:28:24,326
with his wiggly woggly
aerials.

449
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,748
That's it.

450
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:30,950
If he comes in now,
tell him I left in a huff.

451
00:28:30,986 --> 00:28:31,968
All right, love.

452
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,992
' N ight.

453
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:34,976
Probably lying on your couch
at home asleep.

454
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,195
Yeah.
you're right.

455
00:28:41,226 --> 00:28:42,852
Sorry.

456
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:50,631
It gives me
great pleasure

457
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:53,830
to ask Dame Reggae Spllff
of Port Llac

458
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,735
to switch on this year's
illumination.

459
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,982
Thank you.
thank you. thank you.

460
00:29:05,354 --> 00:29:08,223

Here we are.
Good thing.

468
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:29,095

That's a lot

And the R.A. F.
They'll wanna be included.

00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:04,585
Let's not.

476
00:30:04,618 --> 00:30:06,560
Let's just go
back into the pub.

477
00:30:06,602 --> 00:30:07,911
There's something I want
to discuss with you two.

478
00:30:07,945 --> 00:30:09,440
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

479
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:10,976
We've gotta get
to the house, to save Grace!

480
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,057
Yeah. Iknow what's

481

J ust come back

482
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:18,376
I s it gonna blow?

483
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:19,838
No, I don't think so.

484
00:30:19,882 --> 00:30:21,027
That's it.

485
00:30:24,457 --> 00:30:26,181
Well. how do youknow?

486
00:30:26,218 --> 00:30:27,560
I've seen it before
in Amsterdam.

487
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:29,448
years ago when I was
on a medicaI study

488
00:30:29,482 --> 00:30:31,107
studying
something medical.

489
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:32,739
So that's
their plan. then?

490
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:34,120
Well. from what Matt's
been saying.

491
00:30:34,153 --> 00:30:36,520
and putting two and two
together, I reckon so, yeah.

492
00:30:36,554 --> 00:30:39,303
Kind of warms the heart,
Grace carrying on the locaI tradition

493
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,280
of complete and utter
contempt for the law.

494
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:42,849
Makes you proud.

495
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,581
Did you try
that stuff, Doctor?

496
00:30:44,617 --> 00:30:48,130
Once at university.
Didn't inhale.

497
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:51,871
Evening.

498
00:30:51,914 --> 00:30:53,953
Drinking after hours.
Charlle?

499
00:30:53,994 --> 00:30:55,488
Oh. private party,
Sergeant.

500
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:58,115
Lagavulln?
16 year old.

501
00:30:58,153 --> 00:30:59,363
Just a small one.

502
00:30:59,402 --> 00:31:02,718
Any of you noticed those llghts
out towards Llac house?

503
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,136
No.

504
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:06,591
Any luck with
those poachers?

505
00:31:06,634 --> 00:31:08,773
Oh. I'll get them.
Just a matter of time.

506
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,697
Crime never pays.

507
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,585
Certainly.
Yeah.

508
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,868
Where have you been?

509
00:31:20,905 --> 00:31:21,887
Nowhere.

510
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,523
What you been up to?
Nothing.

511
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:26,245
Well. I'm glad
we got that cleared up.

512
00:31:26,282 --> 00:31:28,835
I was working up at the house.
I lost track of time.

513
00:31:28,873 --> 00:31:30,280
I'm sorry.

514
00:31:30,314 --> 00:31:31,720
I waited for ages
in the pub.

515
00:31:31,753 --> 00:31:32,931
Didn't Grace tell you?

516
00:31:32,969 --> 00:31:34,627
She did.
I was really, really busy.

517
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:37,448
I'm really,
really sorry.

518
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:38,943
Look, I've got
something to tell you.

519
00:31:38,985 --> 00:31:41,058
I've got something
to tell you too. Sit down.

520
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:43,138
Let me tell you first.
Mine's really quite good.

521
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:44,224
So's mine.

522
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:46,786
All right,
you go first.

523
00:31:46,825 --> 00:31:48,680
No, you go first.

524
00:31:48,714 --> 00:31:49,641
All right.

525
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,267
I'm moving the plants
up to Llac house.

526
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:53,161
We're gonna grow them
up there really quickly.

527
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:55,812
There's this speciaI way
of growing called hydronics.

528
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,857
Youknow how Grace is
a really good gardener?

529
00:31:57,897 --> 00:31:59,458
It's gonna get us out
of all our money problems.

530
00:31:59,497 --> 00:32:00,904
U s”??
Well. me and Grace.

531
00:32:00,938 --> 00:32:02,945
It's simple, it's perfect.
We sell it!

532
00:32:02,985 --> 00:32:05,833
And anything we make over
what she needs. we spllt 5050.

533
00:32:05,865 --> 00:32:07,491
Look, it's extreme,
but it's smart.

534
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:09,384
I don't want to leave
here to get work,

535
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:10,530
and this way,
I get to stay.

536
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:12,871
U ntiI you go to jail.
I'm not going to jail.

537
00:32:12,905 --> 00:32:14,432
Matthew, smoking weed
is one thing.

538
00:32:14,473 --> 00:32:16,481
Large scale cultivation
is another.

539
00:32:16,521 --> 00:32:18,823
I'm surprised at Grace.
It's really stupid.

540
00:32:18,857 --> 00:32:21,126
No, it's not really stupid.
It's really smart.

541
00:32:21,162 --> 00:32:22,918
I think it'd be different
if it was your idea.

542
00:32:22,953 --> 00:32:24,001
Yeah. you're right.

543
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,471
When you're being chased
around your prison cell

544
00:32:25,513 --> 00:32:27,488
by a 16 stone bank robber
with a stiffy,

545
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,635
I'll be here thinking.
Why couldn't it have been me?

546
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:31,975
Why couldn't I have had
that brilllant idea?

547
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,017
you've been bleating on
about how unhappy you are

548
00:32:34,057 --> 00:32:36,130
about losing your job,
and what's your solution?

549
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,097
Crime.

550
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,242
You get in deeper,

551
00:32:38,282 --> 00:32:40,070
and you drag Grace down
with you.

552
00:32:40,106 --> 00:32:43,106
Matthew, you are
such an idiot!

553
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:48,420
What's your news. then?

554
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:51,329
Doesn't matter.

555
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:23,240
Hello?
Hello, Mrs. Trevethan?

556
00:33:23,273 --> 00:33:25,444
It's Quentin Rhodes here,
from Ramptons.

557
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:27,304
It's about our surveyor.
He's rather upset.

558
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:29,192
Velly solly.

559
00:33:29,226 --> 00:33:30,753
Long rumbah.

560
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:52,002
Get both of those.

561
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:54,245
So, she sort of goes
through there, you see?

562
00:33:56,777 --> 00:33:57,792
All right.

563
00:34:02,185 --> 00:34:04,324
Mrs. Trevethan.

564
00:34:04,361 --> 00:34:05,310
Hello.

565
00:34:05,353 --> 00:34:08,004
Have you met
my friend. Tony?

566
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:09,285
Hello.

567
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:11,656
My name is Tony.
I'm from Scandinavia.

568
00:34:11,689 --> 00:34:12,485
Oh...

569
00:34:12,522 --> 00:34:14,464
congratulations.

570
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:16,512
Tony, could you go
and get one of those

571
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,975
giant bags
ofkitty lltter?

572
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,456
He doesn't talk much.

573
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:26,399
H mm. does he have to?

574
00:34:27,593 --> 00:34:29,000
Grace...

575
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,106
have you read
any of my letters?

576
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:32,967
I'm sorry, no...

577
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:34,724
but I'm working
on a llttle plan.

578
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:36,965
I mean. it's a bit soon
to talk about it just now,

579
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:38,856
but see, I don't
want to jinx it.

580
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,864
Grace, I can't do any more
to hold them off.

581
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:43,361
It's gone up to head office,
and they don'tknow you.

582
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:45,506
All they see is
a middle aged woman

583
00:34:45,545 --> 00:34:48,000
with huge debts
and no income.

584
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:49,732
What are you
going to do?

585
00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:51,908
I'm becoming
a drugs dealer.

586
00:34:53,673 --> 00:34:55,266
Grace...

587
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:57,694
I'm serious.

588
00:34:57,738 --> 00:34:59,047
Thank you.
Tony.

589
00:34:59,081 --> 00:35:00,259
You will phone me,
won't you?

590
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:01,377
Yes. Righty o.

591
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:02,345
Come on. Tony.

592
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:16,352
Honey Chambers?

593
00:36:18,282 --> 00:36:20,321
44 Wilberforce Street,

594
00:36:20,361 --> 00:36:23,044
London. S.W. 3?

595
00:36:23,082 --> 00:36:25,448
He had me
post his letters.

596
00:36:27,657 --> 00:36:29,250
I never got any.

597
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,222
Would you like
a drink?

598
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:44,000
Do you have any children?

599
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:47,205
No. I'm not very maternal.
I'm afraid.

600
00:36:47,241 --> 00:36:48,582
I couldn't have any.

601
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:50,340
No. Iknow.

602
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:52,766
Gosh.
youknow a lot.

603
00:36:55,209 --> 00:36:57,315
Can I ask you
another question?

604
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,424
If you want.

605
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:03,108
How did you ce
with sex?

606
00:37:05,385 --> 00:37:06,629
Sex?

607
00:37:06,665 --> 00:37:07,593
Sex.

608
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:12,768
What a nightmare.

609
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,560
It was exhausting!

610
00:37:19,593 --> 00:37:22,942
Oh. God. it was
so frustrating!

611
00:37:22,985 --> 00:37:25,319
Talk about flogging
a dead horse!

612
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:34,656
No?

613
00:37:34,697 --> 00:37:36,519
Not really.

614
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:38,462
What did you do, then?

615
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:41,571
Well. I don't think we should
really be talking about it.

616
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:43,070
No, please.
I'd like toknow.

617
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:48,352
I...

618
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:52,129
I ce cream.

619
00:37:53,129 --> 00:37:54,951
What? Pardon?

620
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,624
I ce cream.

621
00:37:58,665 --> 00:38:00,454
I sucked it from
his fingertips.

622
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:02,115
It drove him wild.

623
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:08,064
I had to pretend to pass out
to get any rest at all.

624
00:38:08,105 --> 00:38:09,796
He was insatiable.

625
00:38:19,146 --> 00:38:21,382
I think he thought
you weren't interested.

626
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:24,297
He was wrong.

627
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:30,916
It's a beautiful
house.

628
00:38:30,953 --> 00:38:32,514
Yes.

629
00:38:32,553 --> 00:38:35,586
I think I'd like you
to leave, now.

630
00:38:35,753 --> 00:38:37,793
He did love you.

631
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:40,222
And don't
patronize me.

632
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,451
Look, if you ever
want to talk

633
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,050
Yeah.

634
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:47,583
Iknow the address.

635
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:11,974
Matthew?

636
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:12,957
Mm hmm?

637
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:17,730
Will you give me one?

638
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:21,670
What?

639
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:24,192
I want toknow
what it feels like.

640
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:27,715
Please?

641
00:39:28,713 --> 00:39:30,950
Grace, um...

642
00:39:30,985 --> 00:39:32,480
If I'm growing it
and selllng it,

643
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:34,408
I shouldknow
the effect it has.

644
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:36,448
Oh. Yeah.

645
00:39:36,489 --> 00:39:39,489
Of course you should.
No, not here!

646
00:39:40,553 --> 00:39:42,375
Come on. let's get it
over and done with.

647
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:51,139
Calm down.
There's no one about. Relax.

648
00:40:16,105 --> 00:40:17,763
I can't feel anything.

649
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:20,991
Hey, hey, hey.

650
00:40:21,033 --> 00:40:21,981
Slow down.

651
00:40:28,521 --> 00:40:29,928
I s this addictive?

652
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:35,711
It's not crack.

653
00:40:45,897 --> 00:40:47,588
Are you sure
this works?

654
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:48,999
Oh. yes.

655
00:41:04,617 --> 00:41:05,545
What?

656
00:41:05,577 --> 00:41:07,006
Nothing.

657
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:09,220
Yeah. What?

658
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:16,606
What?

659
00:41:16,649 --> 00:41:18,023
Matthew, it's you.

660
00:41:18,057 --> 00:41:19,399
You're Scottish.

661
00:41:27,305 --> 00:41:29,509
Yeah? Thank you.

662
00:41:59,592 --> 00:42:01,731
God. I love it here.

663
00:42:01,768 --> 00:42:04,038
You feellng any better?

664
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:12,065
Still feellng
a llttle bit dizzy.

665
00:42:12,105 --> 00:42:14,309
You hungry?

666
00:42:14,345 --> 00:42:16,833
Oh. God. yes.
I hadn't thought of that.

667
00:42:17,897 --> 00:42:19,719
I'm ravenous!

668
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:24,991
Yes. I float so free...

669
00:42:25,033 --> 00:42:28,099
None too mystically

670
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:32,294
You're a cat,
I'm a bird

671
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:38,114
So catch me
while you can...

672
00:42:38,153 --> 00:42:41,219
What made you
decide to do this?

673
00:42:41,257 --> 00:42:45,218
44 Wilberforce Street,
S.W. 3.

674
00:43:07,689 --> 00:43:09,926
Mrs. Trevethan. please
don't put the phone down

675
00:43:11,817 --> 00:43:14,053
...please don't put
the phone down.

676
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:15,299
Problem?

677
00:43:15,336 --> 00:43:17,376
Thanks. kelly. I've been
trying to get through

678
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:20,450
to this Trevethan woman
for most of my llfe.

679
00:43:20,488 --> 00:43:22,725
Phone, letters...

680
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,662
What is that woman
doing down there?

681
00:43:25,705 --> 00:43:28,574
I don'tknow what's wrong.
She's been really moody recently.

682
00:43:28,617 --> 00:43:30,559
Maybe she just
doesn't approve.

683
00:43:30,601 --> 00:43:32,543
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

684
00:43:32,585 --> 00:43:35,073
The only other tion
was going back to Glasgow.

685
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,862
She didn't want that, either.
Neither did I.

686
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:39,839
My uncle Willle's got
a building site there.

687
00:43:39,881 --> 00:43:41,059
Yeah?
What's he build?

688
00:43:41,097 --> 00:43:42,046
U h. houses.

689
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:44,064
Down there.
What? Okay.

690
00:43:50,345 --> 00:43:53,957
I play a good game
but not as good as you

691
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:58,727
I can be a llttle cold.
but you can be so cruel...

692
00:44:03,497 --> 00:44:05,319
Five... four...

693
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:07,425
three...
two... one...

694
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,854
Now the damage is done

695
00:44:17,897 --> 00:44:20,100
Well. there's blood
in these veins

696
00:44:20,137 --> 00:44:22,046
and I cry when in pain

697
00:44:22,088 --> 00:44:25,634
I'm only human on the inside

698
00:44:25,672 --> 00:44:28,007
And if looks could deceive

699
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,928
Make it hard to belleve

700
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,171
I'm only human

701
00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:35,071
on the inside

702
00:44:39,049 --> 00:44:40,805
I thought you'd come through

703
00:44:40,841 --> 00:44:42,750
I thought you'd come clean

704
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:46,534
You were the best thing
I should never have seen

705
00:44:46,569 --> 00:44:48,740
But you go to extremes

706
00:44:48,777 --> 00:44:50,599
You push me too far

707
00:44:50,632 --> 00:44:54,626
Then youkeep going
till you break my heart

708
00:44:55,849 --> 00:44:59,012
Yeah. you break my heart

709
00:44:59,049 --> 00:45:00,904
See, I bleed and I bruise

710
00:45:00,936 --> 00:45:04,165
Oh. but what's it to you?
I'm only human...

711
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,761
Ahoy!

712
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:06,946
Hey.

713
00:45:09,672 --> 00:45:10,654
What do you want?

714
00:45:10,696 --> 00:45:12,038
I brought lunch.

715
00:45:12,073 --> 00:45:14,211
Cornish pasties.
I'mkidding.

716
00:45:22,377 --> 00:45:24,416
Fish.
You brought me fish?

717
00:45:24,457 --> 00:45:26,758
Well. I thought
it'd be a nice change.

718
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:30,179
What are you
doing here?

719
00:45:30,217 --> 00:45:32,191
You never come
on the boat.

720
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:34,469
I was beginning to wonder
what you looked like.

721
00:45:34,505 --> 00:45:36,261
I was always going to bed
when you get up.

722
00:45:36,297 --> 00:45:37,475
It's the tides.

723
00:45:37,512 --> 00:45:39,683
It's not the tides.

724
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:41,248
I really don't like
what you're doing.

725
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:42,271
Iknow.

726
00:45:42,312 --> 00:45:43,556
I don't want to be
in a relationship

727
00:45:43,593 --> 00:45:44,902
with someone
who's irresponsible.

728
00:45:44,937 --> 00:45:47,392
Yes. you do. I've been
irresponsible my whole llfe.

729
00:45:47,432 --> 00:45:48,959
Well. it's time
you changed.

730
00:45:49,001 --> 00:45:50,080
Why?

731
00:45:50,121 --> 00:45:52,030
You're getting old.

732
00:45:52,072 --> 00:45:55,269
Fuck getting old!
These are laugh llnes!

733
00:45:55,304 --> 00:45:57,541
Nothing's that funny.

734
00:45:57,576 --> 00:46:00,576
I don't understand. I thought
you liked me the way I am.

735
00:46:00,616 --> 00:46:02,439
I do.

736
00:46:02,472 --> 00:46:05,374
But things change, and you have
to change with them.

737
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:06,726
Fish and chips.

738
00:46:06,761 --> 00:46:08,484
Fantastic.

739
00:46:11,657 --> 00:46:13,479
Great.
Wait a few minutes...

740
00:46:13,513 --> 00:46:16,098
till Funboy Buxton will
be here with more wacky fun

741
00:46:16,137 --> 00:46:18,308
with the afternoon crew,
but first, it's 12: 00.

742
00:46:18,344 --> 00:46:20,449
time for the news headllnes.

743
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:22,627
Pollce are celebrating
a major victory

744
00:46:22,665 --> 00:46:23,909
in the war on drugs today.

745
00:46:23,945 --> 00:46:25,701
Two men and one woman

746
00:46:25,737 --> 00:46:27,646
were found guilty
at BristoI Crown Court

747
00:46:27,688 --> 00:46:29,761
after pollce
discovered marijuana

748
00:46:29,801 --> 00:46:32,583
with an estimated street value
of half a milllon pounds

749
00:46:32,617 --> 00:46:35,038
hidden in a barn
on their family farm.

750
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,382
Sentencing them
to 15 year jaiI sentences.

751
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:38,878
the judge

752
00:47:24,361 --> 00:47:26,117
Hello.

753
00:47:26,152 --> 00:47:28,160
Yeah.

754
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:29,542
You all right?

755
00:47:29,577 --> 00:47:31,104
Fine.

756
00:47:31,145 --> 00:47:32,672
No, I just wondered.
youknow,

757
00:47:32,712 --> 00:47:34,534
when you didn't come
into the pub last night.

758
00:47:34,569 --> 00:47:36,391
I'm not drinking
at the moment.

759
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:42,500
Are you angry with me?

760
00:47:42,536 --> 00:47:44,479
No.
I'm angry at Matthew.

761
00:47:44,521 --> 00:47:46,048
It's his fault.

762
00:47:46,089 --> 00:47:48,674
It was my decision
to do it.

763
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:50,884
I'm trying to save
my house.

764
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,862
Everybodyknows
what you're doing.

765
00:47:52,905 --> 00:47:54,912
Pretty soon you'll have
the pollce up there.

766
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:56,676
They'll never
find out.

767
00:47:56,712 --> 00:47:58,851
Grace, your greenhouse
llghts up like a spaceship.

768
00:47:58,888 --> 00:48:00,448
Pele aren't stupid.

769
00:48:00,489 --> 00:48:03,871
We're nearly done now.
He could be in jaiI tomorrow.

770
00:48:09,545 --> 00:48:12,295
Why aren't you drinking?

771
00:48:12,328 --> 00:48:14,335
I just don't feel like it.

772
00:48:17,673 --> 00:48:20,007
He doesn'tknow,
does he?

773
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,120
How can I help?

774
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:32,574
Don't let him
go to jail.

775
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:44,162
Our mutant buds

776
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:46,241
will soon be ready,
Great One.

777
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,182
We can release them
into the atmosphere

778
00:48:49,224 --> 00:48:51,810
and take over
the entire planet!

779
00:48:53,993 --> 00:48:55,553
Do you reallze
what we've done here?

780
00:48:55,592 --> 00:48:57,348
This is fabulous!

781
00:48:57,385 --> 00:48:59,523
It's time for me to go
to London. get a dealer.

782
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,252
Oh. no you're not.

783
00:49:01,288 --> 00:49:02,979
You're staying here.
I'm going.

784
00:49:03,016 --> 00:49:03,965
What?

785
00:49:04,009 --> 00:49:06,016
That's my decision.

786
00:49:06,056 --> 00:49:07,649
Grace, I don't think
you reallze

787
00:49:07,689 --> 00:49:09,030
what you're
deallng with here.

788
00:49:09,065 --> 00:49:11,040
The last time you were
in London was five years ago

789
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:12,903
for the Chelsea
flower show.

790
00:49:12,937 --> 00:49:14,944
You can't sell this stuff
through a florist.

791
00:49:14,984 --> 00:49:16,740
What's your master plan. then?

792
00:49:16,777 --> 00:49:19,744
Well. I was gonna go up
Portobello Road. or Notting H ill

793
00:49:19,784 --> 00:49:22,304
or something like that,
find a dealer, and sell it.

794
00:49:24,232 --> 00:49:25,694
Yeah.
Rubbish!

795
00:49:25,737 --> 00:49:27,428
It's better than what
you've got, which is nothing!

796
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,286
You have to blend in.
Grace.

797
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:30,946
A drug dealer
will take one look at you

798
00:49:30,985 --> 00:49:32,479
andknow there was
something fishy going on.

799
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,237
With the greatest respect,
I'm the hip one.

800
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:36,866
You're a wee bit more
hip replacement. “

801
00:49:37,801 --> 00:49:39,142
One more word out of you.

802
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:40,638
and I'm gonna throw
the whole lot into the sea.

803
00:49:40,681 --> 00:49:42,088
I don't think you're
thinking this through!

804
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,909
I mean it.
You are not the boss of me!

805
00:49:43,944 --> 00:49:45,188
We're partners!

806
00:49:45,225 --> 00:49:47,396
The checks bounced.
remember?

807
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:50,561
Women like cuddly toys.
don't they?

808
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,160
They like to hug them
and squeeze them.

809
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:53,378
and poke their eyes out,

810
00:49:53,417 --> 00:49:55,042
and rip their
fucking llmbs off.

811
00:49:58,313 --> 00:50:00,222
I avoid confrontation.
Iknow it.

812
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:02,271
But if you grew up
in Glasgow in the 1970s.

813
00:50:02,313 --> 00:50:04,582
you'd avoid it, too.
I want an easy llfe.

814
00:50:04,616 --> 00:50:06,111
I want to grow
some vegetables.

815
00:50:06,153 --> 00:50:08,258
smoke some reefer,
sing some carols at Christmas.

816
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,303
and whoknows?
One day I'd like to be a dad

817
00:50:10,345 --> 00:50:12,287
and raise a couple of calm
fucking children.

818
00:50:12,328 --> 00:50:14,215
but that's it.
I've fucking had enough.

819
00:50:14,248 --> 00:50:16,157
I'm going.
No more Mr. Cuddly toy. “

820
00:50:16,201 --> 00:50:18,819
I'm not hanging around to be
a whipping boy for Ganja Grace

821
00:50:18,856 --> 00:50:20,482
and Captain N icky, “
the fucking lobster queen!

822
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,927
I'm fuckin' gone,
I'm gone, I'm gone.

823
00:50:21,961 --> 00:50:23,935
I'm fucking out of here.
But see, before I go,

824
00:50:23,976 --> 00:50:25,220
I'm gonna see
both of these women

825
00:50:25,257 --> 00:50:28,573
and give them both
a piece of my mind.

826
00:50:28,616 --> 00:50:30,177
Are you done?

827
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,586
Good shot.

828
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,167
Moron!

829
00:52:17,992 --> 00:52:21,025
Can I show you
something privately?

830
00:52:21,065 --> 00:52:23,039
It's ever so nice.

831
00:52:23,081 --> 00:52:25,382
Come on.
let's go.

832
00:52:35,048 --> 00:52:37,023
I don'tknow who you are.

833
00:52:37,064 --> 00:52:39,486
I'm not interested.

834
00:52:40,392 --> 00:52:42,596
Come on.

835
00:52:42,633 --> 00:52:44,455
Come here.

836
00:52:44,488 --> 00:52:47,041
I've got something
really tasty.

837
00:52:48,393 --> 00:52:50,083
Are you looking
for something?

838
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,942
Know what I mean?

839
00:52:51,976 --> 00:52:53,602
All right, love.
H in.

840
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,778
Hello.

841
00:52:55,816 --> 00:52:57,093
Excuse me?
Excuse me.

842
00:52:57,128 --> 00:52:59,550
Yo. Yo.

843
00:52:59,592 --> 00:53:01,054
Nah.

844
00:53:41,768 --> 00:53:43,328
I love it here.

845
00:53:43,369 --> 00:53:44,929
It's so quiet.

846
00:53:44,968 --> 00:53:49,376
If you think this is quiet,
you should see Evensong.

847
00:53:50,376 --> 00:53:52,929
I wish I were
a Cathollc sometimes.

848
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:55,074
I ncense,
nice costumes...

849
00:53:55,112 --> 00:53:57,730
A lot to be said
for it, really.

850
00:53:57,769 --> 00:54:00,419
They have confession. too.

851
00:54:10,505 --> 00:54:12,643
I've got some friends...

852
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,941
and I think they're going
to get into a lot of trouble,

853
00:54:15,976 --> 00:54:18,464
and I don'tknow
what to do.

854
00:54:18,504 --> 00:54:22,017
Don't suppose you
can go to the pollce?

855
00:54:22,056 --> 00:54:23,617
Thought not.

856
00:54:23,656 --> 00:54:26,820
If you have
to commit a crime...

857
00:54:26,856 --> 00:54:29,671
to get what you want,

858
00:54:29,705 --> 00:54:32,388
then you're not
meant to have it.

859
00:54:32,424 --> 00:54:33,853
I don'tknow
if I'm worried

860
00:54:33,897 --> 00:54:36,580
more for them.
or worried for myself.

861
00:54:36,616 --> 00:54:38,242
If one has a problem

862
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,215
that seems
to be unsolvable...

863
00:54:41,256 --> 00:54:43,907
then perhaps one shouldn't
try to solve it.

864
00:54:43,944 --> 00:54:45,767
One should accept it.

865
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,044
What do you mean?

866
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,863
God grant me
the serenity

867
00:54:49,896 --> 00:54:52,001
to accept the things
I cannot change,

868
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,625
the courage to change
the things I can.

869
00:54:54,665 --> 00:54:57,599
and the wisdom toknow
the difference.

870
00:54:59,592 --> 00:55:01,665
The wisdom's
the hard part.

871
00:55:01,704 --> 00:55:03,297
Mmm...

872
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,819
I like Matthew.

873
00:55:10,856 --> 00:55:12,765
He's a good soul...

874
00:55:14,024 --> 00:55:15,715
for a Scotsman.

875
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:28,641
What on earth did you
think you were doing?

876
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,168
You can't just go hanging
around nasty pubs like that.

877
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:32,452
You're bound to get
into trouble.

878
00:55:32,488 --> 00:55:34,463
Look, if you're trying
to meet a man.

879
00:55:34,504 --> 00:55:35,813
Iknow some
much better places.

880
00:55:35,848 --> 00:55:38,815
I wasn't trying
to meet a man.

881
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,400
Keep walking.

882
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,862
Get out of here!
You'll get arrested!

883
00:55:44,904 --> 00:55:45,831
I need to talk.

884
00:55:51,112 --> 00:55:52,356
Have you seen N icky?

885
00:55:52,392 --> 00:55:53,799
No. Where the hell
have you been?

886
00:55:53,832 --> 00:55:55,719
Grace had to get Harvey
to watch the plants.

887
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:56,679
What?

888
00:55:56,712 --> 00:55:58,206
I took her to the station
this morning.

889
00:55:58,248 --> 00:55:59,196
She's gone to London.

890
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,581
Oh. fuck!

891
00:56:03,016 --> 00:56:04,577
Where are we going?

892
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:08,646
44 Wilberforce Street,
S.W. 3.

893
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,357
Why don't you get your young
Scottish friend to help?

894
00:56:16,392 --> 00:56:19,174
Surely he'd have a better idea
how to go about it?

895
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:20,996
No, his girlfriend's
pregnant.

896
00:56:21,032 --> 00:56:22,559
He can't get into trouble.

897
00:56:24,744 --> 00:56:27,013
I just want you to ring
a dealer, that's all.

898
00:56:27,048 --> 00:56:28,160
No.

899
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,142
Grace, it's mad.
You'll end up in jail.

900
00:56:30,184 --> 00:56:31,940
I'm not going
to give up.

901
00:56:32,968 --> 00:56:34,691
Call a dealer.

902
00:56:38,184 --> 00:56:40,257
How do youknow
that Iknow one?

903
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,043
On one condition

904
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,469
that you let me lend you
an outfit that's...

905
00:56:54,472 --> 00:56:55,901
not that.

906
00:57:21,576 --> 00:57:23,038
Kelly.
Sir?

907
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,541
Get me the times of trains
to Cornwall tomorrow.

908
00:57:24,584 --> 00:57:25,631
Yes. sir.

909
00:57:26,632 --> 00:57:29,731
Draw... spllff...

910
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:32,352
Puff...

911
00:57:32,392 --> 00:57:33,439
Shit...

912
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,814
Yes. thank you.

913
00:57:35,848 --> 00:57:38,237
Call it what
you will.

914
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,806
but it's my bellef

915
00:57:39,848 --> 00:57:42,433
it is the door
to enllghtenment.

916
00:57:43,432 --> 00:57:45,025
I n your own time?

917
00:57:45,064 --> 00:57:47,846
And now,
the acid test.

918
00:58:01,384 --> 00:58:02,594
Jesus!

919
00:58:07,944 --> 00:58:09,318
I'll give you
60 quid for it.

920
00:58:12,168 --> 00:58:14,056
Don't be silly!

921
00:58:14,088 --> 00:58:15,397
70?

922
00:58:16,424 --> 00:58:18,114
No,
that's just a sample.

923
00:58:18,152 --> 00:58:20,061
I've got 20kilos.

924
00:58:20,104 --> 00:58:22,439
20kilos. Grace?!

925
00:58:22,472 --> 00:58:23,879
No, no, no, no, no.

926
00:58:23,912 --> 00:58:25,373
You've got the wrong man.

927
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:27,423
I mean.
I run a llmited eration.

928
00:58:27,464 --> 00:58:30,464
You're talking...
You're talking big leagues.

929
00:58:30,504 --> 00:58:32,544
Well. you just
got promoted.

930
00:58:32,584 --> 00:58:34,559
I don't have
thatkind of money.

931
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,705
Well. do youknow
anybody who does?

932
00:58:36,744 --> 00:58:37,889
Well...

933
00:58:37,928 --> 00:58:39,816
I've heard of someone.

934
00:58:41,512 --> 00:58:43,105
Call him.

935
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:46,079
He's a bit heavy.
He's not like us.

936
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,397
He's not...

937
00:58:47,432 --> 00:58:49,025
laid back.

938
00:58:49,064 --> 00:58:50,886
Call him.

939
00:58:56,712 --> 00:58:58,500
Come on. Honey!

940
00:58:58,536 --> 00:59:00,325
There she is.
No, wait, wait!

941
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,270
You don'tknow who the guy is
I don't care who he is.

942
00:59:02,312 --> 00:59:04,930
He may be a drug dealer!
You can't wander into that!

943
00:59:04,968 --> 00:59:06,462
You've gotten
so bossy!

944
00:59:06,504 --> 00:59:08,838
You're so insensitive!
That could be dangerous!

945
00:59:08,872 --> 00:59:09,951
They're getting
away now!

946
00:59:09,992 --> 00:59:11,715
Well. follow them.
you dozy quack!

947
00:59:54,472 --> 00:59:57,025
J ust like a window display
at Harvey N ick's.

948
00:59:57,064 --> 00:59:58,755
There's a rave tonight.
We hold them here.

949
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:00,450
What's a rave?

950
01:00:00,488 --> 01:00:02,015
Grace!

951
01:00:04,328 --> 01:00:05,670
Ah. merde!

952
01:00:08,808 --> 01:00:10,979
What have you
brought me, China?

953
01:00:11,015 --> 01:00:13,950
Two ladies.
and the fucking hippie.

954
01:00:13,991 --> 01:00:16,991
What do they want?

955
01:00:31,848 --> 01:00:34,117
Touche!
Sur la tete!

956
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,767
You like to fish?

957
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,385
Yes. Where I llve,
the fishing's wonderful.

958
01:00:44,424 --> 01:00:45,885
I hate it here.

959
01:00:46,728 --> 01:00:49,030
The fishing is terrible.

960
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:50,951
I should visit you.

961
01:00:50,983 --> 01:00:52,390
Where do you llve?

962
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:57,185
What's your name?

963
01:00:58,407 --> 01:00:59,749
Grace.

964
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:02,238
Perfect.

965
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,963
Hello?

966
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,887
Cooey.

967
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,447
Grace?

968
01:01:08,488 --> 01:01:10,495
Funny smell.

969
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:13,639
Who's that?

970
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:15,330
Oh!

971
01:01:15,368 --> 01:01:17,539
Harvey!
Where's Grace?

972
01:01:17,576 --> 01:01:19,364
We've come to finallze
the details

973
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,334
of the women's institute visit.
Grace invited us to supper.

974
01:01:22,376 --> 01:01:24,481
It was arranged
ages ago.

975
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,502
You got to get out.

976
01:01:25,543 --> 01:01:28,609
No. We have to speak
to Grace.

977
01:01:28,648 --> 01:01:30,339
No, you have
to leave.

978
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:31,903
It's the plants.
you see.

979
01:01:31,944 --> 01:01:33,438
They're very dellcate.

980
01:01:33,479 --> 01:01:35,072
They're speciaI orchids
from Peru.

981
01:01:35,112 --> 01:01:36,606
Oh. these aren't orchids.

982
01:01:36,648 --> 01:01:39,037
Aren't they?
No.

983
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:40,323
They look more
like tea.

984
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,701
Tea?
Mmm.

985
01:01:41,736 --> 01:01:42,816
Tea.
What a good idea.

986
01:01:42,856 --> 01:01:44,711
Let's... let's go
in thekitchen.

987
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:46,118
and I'll make you
a lovely cup of tea.

988
01:01:46,151 --> 01:01:47,645
Well. I was
expecting supper.

989
01:01:47,688 --> 01:01:49,029
There's some ham left out.

990
01:01:49,064 --> 01:01:50,209
I canknock you up
a sandwich.

991
01:01:50,247 --> 01:01:51,589
And what is
that funny smell?

992
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,150
Well. it's probably the ham.
It's been left out a bit,

993
01:01:53,192 --> 01:01:55,744
but it'll be all right.

994
01:02:02,408 --> 01:02:03,782
Mmm.

995
01:02:03,816 --> 01:02:05,725
Where did you get it?

996
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:08,833
The pele I represent
wish to remain anonymous.

997
01:02:08,872 --> 01:02:10,366
Ah. yes.

998
01:02:10,407 --> 01:02:14,499
The pele I represent wish
to remain anonymous as well.

999
01:02:14,536 --> 01:02:16,740
Maybe they are
the same pele, huh?

1000
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:18,947
Can I go now?

1001
01:02:18,984 --> 01:02:20,893
I've got to pick me daughter up
from flute practice.

1002
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,571
How much do you have?

1003
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:27,364
A lot.
Are you buying?

1004
01:02:28,872 --> 01:02:31,206
Why don't I just take it?

1005
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,668
You don'tknow
where it is.

1006
01:02:32,712 --> 01:02:33,660
Ah. yeah.

1007
01:02:33,703 --> 01:02:36,038
I'm sure I can
get you to tell me.

1008
01:02:36,071 --> 01:02:38,176
What if I cut off
your fingers

1009
01:02:38,216 --> 01:02:39,645
one by one...

1010
01:02:39,688 --> 01:02:41,182
untiI you change
your mind?

1011
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:43,810
Ohh...

1012
01:02:43,848 --> 01:02:46,052
All right! Nobody move!
I'm the pollce!

1013
01:02:46,087 --> 01:02:47,200
The whole place
is surrounded!

1014
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,807
And you would be?

1015
01:02:51,847 --> 01:02:53,473
Hello, everyone.

1016
01:02:53,511 --> 01:02:56,326
Martin Bamford.
Are we too early for the rave?

1017
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,767
I can't wait.

1018
01:02:57,799 --> 01:02:59,970
I just love... raving.

1019
01:03:00,008 --> 01:03:03,805
This has nothing to do with me.
Shut up, beardy weirdy.

1020
01:03:03,848 --> 01:03:05,408
Who's this guy?

1021
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,903
That's my doctor.

1022
01:03:07,944 --> 01:03:09,504
This one?

1023
01:03:09,544 --> 01:03:10,471
My gardener.

1024
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:13,668
Oh. nice.

1025
01:03:13,704 --> 01:03:15,264
Are we expecting
anyone else?

1026
01:03:15,304 --> 01:03:16,765
No.

1027
01:03:16,807 --> 01:03:18,563
Your cleaning lady,
perhaps?

1028
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,705
No, no, no.
No one else.

1029
01:03:20,743 --> 01:03:22,118
Very well.

1030
01:03:22,151 --> 01:03:24,224
This is China.
He beats pele up for me.

1031
01:03:24,264 --> 01:03:25,191
Shall I?

1032
01:03:25,224 --> 01:03:27,012
No, no! Please!

1033
01:03:27,048 --> 01:03:29,023
Matthew, take Dr. Bamford
and Honey

1034
01:03:29,064 --> 01:03:30,951

1035
01:03:30,984 --> 01:03:31,966
Please.

1036
01:03:34,887 --> 01:03:35,902
Please?

1037
01:03:43,752 --> 01:03:46,118
Excuse me.

1038
01:03:48,327 --> 01:03:49,669
Grace?

1039
01:03:49,703 --> 01:03:52,671
J ust wait for me
outside.

1040
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:57,123
Shall I go, too?

1041
01:03:58,247 --> 01:03:59,175
No.

1042
01:04:12,071 --> 01:04:14,210
Sit down. please.

1043
01:04:25,063 --> 01:04:30,398
All the pele
I deaI with are scum.

1044
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,927
I'm a llttle scummy myself.

1045
01:04:32,968 --> 01:04:34,277
You're not scum.

1046
01:04:34,311 --> 01:04:36,100
That worries me.

1047
01:04:36,135 --> 01:04:37,924
I take exception to that.

1048
01:04:37,959 --> 01:04:40,829
I come from
a long llne of scum.

1049
01:04:40,871 --> 01:04:43,489
My dear late husband was
one of the scummiest men

1050
01:04:43,528 --> 01:04:45,316
to walk the face
of this earth.

1051
01:04:45,352 --> 01:04:46,628
My apologies.

1052
01:04:46,664 --> 01:04:49,151
Yes. let's get to it,
shall we?

1053
01:04:49,192 --> 01:04:50,850
Three and a half akilo.

1054
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,091
20kilos
in the first week,

1055
01:04:53,128 --> 01:04:55,015
and then 1 Okilos
two weeks later.

1056
01:04:55,048 --> 01:04:57,055
After that
we can do 20kilos

1057
01:04:57,095 --> 01:04:58,273
every four weeks.

1058
01:05:00,008 --> 01:05:01,950
Three for akilo.
And no more deals

1059
01:05:01,991 --> 01:05:02,885
untiI I see
the first batch.

1060
01:05:02,919 --> 01:05:04,545
Three and a quarter.

1061
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:06,144
Done.

1062
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,934
Oh. thank you!

1063
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:12,574
You're welcome.

1064
01:05:15,272 --> 01:05:17,508
Can I offer you
a glass of wine?

1065
01:05:21,703 --> 01:05:23,591
I can't belleve
your friend fainted.

1066
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:29,923
Do I look like I would cut
someone's finger off?

1067
01:05:34,408 --> 01:05:35,902
Oh. yes.

1068
01:05:35,944 --> 01:05:37,831
Thank you.

1069
01:05:44,999 --> 01:05:46,690
Are you sure you're going
to be all right?

1070
01:05:46,727 --> 01:05:48,418
Never felt better,
Honey.

1071
01:05:48,456 --> 01:05:50,278
Now, headache pill.
straight to bed.

1072
01:05:50,311 --> 01:05:51,239
Don't go over
any bumps.

1073
01:05:51,271 --> 01:05:52,832
Good luck!

1074
01:05:53,928 --> 01:05:55,455
Come on. boys.

1075
01:05:59,463 --> 01:06:01,187
What do you think?

1076
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:04,158
I'm not sure.

1077
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:05,093
Follow them.

1078
01:06:06,088 --> 01:06:07,876
What'll I do
with the hippie?

1079
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,749
Take him.

1080
01:06:14,792 --> 01:06:15,872
I can't.

1081
01:06:15,911 --> 01:06:17,504
My old lady's
expecting me.

1082
01:06:17,543 --> 01:06:19,780
We're having a Dungeons
and Dragons night.

1083
01:06:22,407 --> 01:06:26,117
It's the regionaI final.

1084
01:06:26,152 --> 01:06:28,518
If thatknife had sllpped.
I'd be a dead man.

1085
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:31,398
There'd be a dead body driving
this car back to Cornwall.

1086
01:06:31,431 --> 01:06:34,114
Don't be so stupid.
He was bluffing.

1087
01:06:34,151 --> 01:06:35,907
Look, as long as we
have the merchandise,

1088
01:06:35,943 --> 01:06:36,837
we have the power.

1089
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:38,465
Excuse me,
do Iknow you?

1090
01:06:38,503 --> 01:06:40,576
What are you talking about,
merchandise and power??

1091
01:06:40,616 --> 01:06:42,372
Look at you!
Look at the way you're dressed!

1092
01:06:42,407 --> 01:06:43,651
You're like
Ma fucking Baker!

1093
01:06:43,688 --> 01:06:45,826
Language!
Don't you language me!

1094
01:06:45,864 --> 01:06:47,457
I nearly got my fucking
throat cut for you!

1095
01:06:47,495 --> 01:06:48,902
Well. you're not even
supposed to be here.

1096
01:06:48,935 --> 01:06:51,935
Fine! Go ahead and do it yourself
with Jacques fucking Cousteau then!

1097
01:06:51,976 --> 01:06:53,830
I'm out!
What?

1098
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:29,701
I can't find
Grace's plants anywhere.

1099
01:07:29,735 --> 01:07:32,866
This tea has the most
extraordinary aroma.

1100
01:07:32,904 --> 01:07:34,878
Darjeellng?

1101
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,097
Trevethan.

1102
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:38,437
Oh. Diana. you never...

01:07:40,455 --> 01:07:42,430
I do love fresh tea.

1105
01:07:42,471 --> 01:07:44,031
So do I. dear.

1106
01:07:44,072 --> 01:07:45,316
Give it here.

1107
01:07:49,063 --> 01:07:50,918
Oh. that's lovely.

1108
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,051
I'm sorry
for shouting at you.

1109
01:08:12,327 --> 01:08:15,426
How else am I going
to get the money?

1110
01:08:15,463 --> 01:08:16,739
I don'tknow.

1111
01:08:18,951 --> 01:08:21,155
It's N icky.

1112
01:08:21,191 --> 01:08:22,784
N icky doesn't want
to be in a relationship

1113
01:08:22,824 --> 01:08:24,646
with somebody
who's irresponsible.

1114
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:26,021
And I don't want to be
in a relationship

1115
01:08:26,056 --> 01:08:27,779
with somebody
who isn't N icky.

1116
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,779
Ooh. that's better!

1117
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,310
Ready for my breakfast now.

1118
01:08:33,351 --> 01:08:34,398
Come on!

1119
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:52,257
For Christ's sake.

1120
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,684
Okay, when we get back,
we harvest the plants.

1121
01:08:54,727 --> 01:08:56,549
and we get the stuff up
to your paI in London

1122
01:08:56,584 --> 01:08:57,696
and we never do it
again. okay?

1123
01:08:57,736 --> 01:08:59,197
Thank you.

1124
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:01,214
We do it quick as well.

1125
01:09:01,255 --> 01:09:03,360
I don't want another
knife at my throat.

1126
01:09:05,255 --> 01:09:06,881
Do youknow,
this is the site

1127
01:09:06,919 --> 01:09:09,734
of the new
prosed B 323.

1128
01:09:09,768 --> 01:09:13,183
due for completion
early 2004.

1129
01:09:13,223 --> 01:09:14,750
I can't belleve
you lost 'em.

1130
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:16,285
I mean. how could
you have lost 'em?

1131
01:09:16,327 --> 01:09:19,142
It's not as if there's
a lot of traffic about!

1132
01:09:19,175 --> 01:09:21,411
Look, I'm sorry,
all right?

1133
01:09:21,447 --> 01:09:23,334
I'm not a career
criminal.

1134
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:25,756
I don't have
taillng abillties.

1135
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:27,261
Are you getting
llppy with me?

1136
01:09:27,304 --> 01:09:29,725
Don't start getting
llppy with me!

1137
01:09:29,767 --> 01:09:32,484
Right. I'm just trying
to make the best of it.

1138
01:09:32,519 --> 01:09:34,406
If we're gonna come
all the way down here,

1139
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:36,708
we might as well
enjoy a day out.

1140
01:09:36,744 --> 01:09:38,205
Get in the car.

1141
01:09:38,247 --> 01:09:40,135
J ust shut up
and get in the car!

1142
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:42,688
You need to sort out
some sort of...

1143
01:09:42,727 --> 01:09:45,182
anger management
when you get home.

1144
01:09:46,695 --> 01:09:48,222
Harvey?

1145
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,431
Grace.

1146
01:09:50,471 --> 01:09:52,576
You forgot about
your meeting with the W. I.

1147
01:09:52,616 --> 01:09:53,990
They went in the greenhouse.
It's all right,

1148
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,234
I bluffed them.

1149
01:09:55,271 --> 01:09:57,889
And... N icky was here.

1150
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,228
What did you tell her?

1151
01:10:00,263 --> 01:10:02,019
That you went to London
with Dr. Bamford

1152
01:10:02,055 --> 01:10:03,397
to help Grace
sell the drugs.

1153
01:10:03,431 --> 01:10:04,772
Oh. shit.

1154
01:10:04,807 --> 01:10:06,181
Grace, I have to go
and see her.

1155
01:10:06,215 --> 01:10:07,524
That's all right,
don't worry.

1156
01:10:07,559 --> 01:10:09,501
Harvey and I will start
on the greenhouse.

1157
01:10:09,544 --> 01:10:12,194
Come on. Harvey.

1158
01:10:12,231 --> 01:10:13,889
Thanks.
this'll do fine.

1159
01:10:13,927 --> 01:10:15,488
Do youknow
where Llac house is.

1160
01:10:15,527 --> 01:10:17,502
Mrs. Trevethan?
No.

1161
01:10:17,543 --> 01:10:19,648
Ah. I'll ask around.
Try the sh.

1162
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:21,597
Keep the change.
Right o.

Thank you.

1164
01:10:39,783 --> 01:10:41,277
Hello, anybody home?

1165
01:10:43,496 --> 01:10:45,056

1166
01:10:56,423 --> 01:10:59,423
May I help you?

1167
01:11:02,951 --> 01:11:03,878
Shh!

1168
01:11:09,991 --> 01:11:12,544
Would you like
some cornflakes?

1169
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:14,405
They're heavenly.

1170
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:18,116
U h. no, thank you.
I've already eaten.

1171
01:11:33,351 --> 01:11:36,035

1174
01:11:42,567 --> 01:11:44,956
I'm trying to contact

1180

01:13:15,303 --> 01:13:17,092
No, no, no!
Don't!

1206
01:13:17,127 --> 01:13:18,850
Get out of the water!
You're pregnant!

1207
01:13:24,135 --> 01:13:25,509
No, no, no, no!

1208
01:13:25,543 --> 01:13:27,583
You can't swim!
You're pregnant!

1209
01:13:27,623 --> 01:13:30,492
Now the picture
is completed

1210
01:13:30,535 --> 01:13:33,350
And two's becoming three

1211
01:13:33,383 --> 01:13:35,423
Oh. yeah

1212
01:13:35,463 --> 01:13:37,634
It's meant to be

1213
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:41,829
This is no accident to me

1214
01:13:41,863 --> 01:13:44,230
Oh. yeah

1215
01:13:44,263 --> 01:13:46,336
It's meant to be

1216
01:13:47,335 --> 01:13:50,117
It's no coincidence to me

1217
01:13:50,151 --> 01:13:52,606
Aa ahh!

1218
01:13:52,647 --> 01:13:54,589
Yeah!

1219
01:14:10,759 --> 01:14:14,719
Mrs. Trevethan?
It's Quentin Rhodes.

1220
01:14:14,759 --> 01:14:17,409
Harvey,
I cannot see that person.

1221
01:14:17,447 --> 01:14:19,487
Not now. You've got
to get rid of him!

1222
01:14:19,527 --> 01:14:21,382
What do I say?
I don'tknow!

1223
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:24,066
Tell him anything!
Tell him I'm still in London.

1224
01:14:24,103 --> 01:14:26,110
tell him I've been
kidnapped by allens.

1225
01:14:26,151 --> 01:14:27,133
anything!

1226
01:14:30,151 --> 01:14:31,875
Charlle, whiskey!

1227
01:14:31,911 --> 01:14:33,766
Thank God. I've been trying
to reach you at the house.

1228
01:14:33,798 --> 01:14:35,522
No one will answer
the bloody phone!

1229
01:14:35,559 --> 01:14:36,487
What's wrong?

1230
01:14:36,519 --> 01:14:38,527
There were two men here
Londoners

1231
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:39,679
asking about Grace.

1232
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:42,020
I thought maybe Customs.

1233
01:14:51,751 --> 01:14:52,765
That's them.

1234
01:14:52,807 --> 01:14:54,716
Oh. shit!
What?

1235
01:14:54,759 --> 01:14:57,126
They're not Customs.
They're drug dealers from London.

1236
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,817
Well. I was right
about London.

1237
01:14:58,855 --> 01:15:00,382
Charlle, come with me.
We'll go to the house.

1238
01:15:00,423 --> 01:15:02,463
N icky, go and wake Dr. Bamford.
Meet us up there.

1239
01:15:07,495 --> 01:15:09,317
Give me all these!
What's the matter with you?

1240
01:15:09,351 --> 01:15:11,107
Get up there!

1241
01:15:11,143 --> 01:15:12,549
How many times have
I got to tell you...

1242
01:15:15,367 --> 01:15:17,255
Alfred?
What is it?

1243
01:15:17,287 --> 01:15:19,175
The two men
who own this car,

1244
01:15:19,207 --> 01:15:20,734
they were just
in the pub.

1245
01:15:20,775 --> 01:15:23,164
I overheard them talking
about salmon poaching.

1246
01:15:23,207 --> 01:15:24,549
how much
they enjoyed it.

1247
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:26,273
Really?
Yeah.

1248
01:15:26,311 --> 01:15:28,318
Well. thanks. N icky.
There could be

1249
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:31,010
a community service reward
in this for you.

1250
01:15:31,046 --> 01:15:31,974
Thanks.

1251
01:15:32,006 --> 01:15:33,949
I've gotta go.

1252
01:15:33,991 --> 01:15:34,852
I'm pregnant.

1253
01:15:34,886 --> 01:15:36,315
Oh. yes. yes.
of course.

1254
01:15:40,551 --> 01:15:43,071
What are they doing here?
They're not on hollday, Grace.

1255
01:15:43,111 --> 01:15:44,867
But Jacques said
one week!

1256
01:15:44,903 --> 01:15:45,983
Well. he lled.

1257
01:15:46,023 --> 01:15:47,550
Oh. Quentin Rhodes
is here.

1258
01:15:47,591 --> 01:15:48,900
Who the fuck is
Quentin Rhodes?

1259
01:15:48,934 --> 01:15:50,625
Harvey's holding him off.
What are we going to do?

1260
01:15:50,663 --> 01:15:53,118
Let's get rid of this stuff,
and get this thing over with.

1261
01:15:57,574 --> 01:15:59,680
Jesus!

1262
01:16:09,895 --> 01:16:11,324
U p the hill.

1263
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,025
Second house
on the left.

1264
01:16:22,951 --> 01:16:26,082
57 to base.
Suspects under surveillance.

1265
01:16:26,118 --> 01:16:27,907
Cy that.
On our way.

1266
01:16:35,079 --> 01:16:37,283
Mrs. Trevethan?

1267
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:39,458
Grace,
I've just come to warn you.

1268
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:40,772
There are two men
around here

1269
01:16:40,807 --> 01:16:42,301
who are part
of a salmon

1270
01:16:48,327 --> 01:16:49,756
It's parsley.

1271
01:16:50,759 --> 01:16:52,253
It's marijuana. isn't it?

1272
01:16:54,119 --> 01:16:55,046
Yes.

1273
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:58,118
Iknew you and Matthew
were growing it,

1274
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:00,060
but I got no idea...

1275
01:17:00,103 --> 01:17:01,051
Youknew?

1276
01:17:01,095 --> 01:17:03,200
Well. I llve around here,
don't I?

1277
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:05,028
But seeing as how you had
financiaI troubles.

1278
01:17:05,063 --> 01:17:07,365
I thought I'd turn
a bllnd eye to...

1279
01:17:07,398 --> 01:17:09,057
a bit of homegrown.

1280
01:17:09,095 --> 01:17:11,135
But, Grace...

1281
01:17:11,175 --> 01:17:14,022
this is a huge amount.

1282
01:17:16,775 --> 01:17:18,662
It's good stuff too,
isn't this?

1283
01:17:18,695 --> 01:17:20,102
Better than that shit

1284
01:17:20,134 --> 01:17:21,923
you were growing
up at the vicarage.

1285
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:23,136
Youknew about that?

1286
01:17:23,175 --> 01:17:24,157
Mmm.

1287
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:26,566
Alfred...
I n a few minutes.

1288
01:17:26,598 --> 01:17:28,289
we'll have got rid of it.

1289
01:17:28,327 --> 01:17:30,214
Can't you turn
your bllnd eye

1290
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:31,621
just a llttle bit
longer?

1291
01:17:31,654 --> 01:17:33,280
It's not
so much me, Grace.

1292
01:17:33,318 --> 01:17:35,457
It's the officers
on their way from H Q

1293
01:17:35,494 --> 01:17:37,250
which worry me.

1294
01:17:37,287 --> 01:17:38,629
God! What are we
going to do?

1295
01:17:38,663 --> 01:17:40,256
If I were you.

1296
01:17:40,294 --> 01:17:42,050
I'd get rid of this
stuff bloody quick.

1297
01:17:42,087 --> 01:17:44,258
I'm gonna go and look
for poachers.

1298
01:17:54,246 --> 01:17:55,872
Excuse me a moment.

1299
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:19,425
Ahem!

1300
01:18:21,511 --> 01:18:23,932
Who are you?

1301
01:18:23,975 --> 01:18:25,316
He asked first.

1302
01:18:25,351 --> 01:18:27,522
I'm here
to do some business...

1303
01:18:27,559 --> 01:18:30,014
with Mrs. Trevethan.

1304
01:18:30,055 --> 01:18:31,965
Oh. yeah?

1305
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:34,178
Well. so are we.

1306
01:18:34,214 --> 01:18:35,840
Really?

1307
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,780
Are you interested
in buying the prerty,

1308
01:18:38,823 --> 01:18:40,033
or do you have...

1309
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:42,143
a claim on it
in some way?

1310
01:18:42,183 --> 01:18:44,125
What is this?

1311
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:52,260
Well. there it is.

1312
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:54,399
We did it.

1313
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:57,156
We did. didn't we?

1314
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:00,732
There's another two men here.

1315
01:19:00,775 --> 01:19:01,441
What are we gonna do?

1316
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:02,340
Skin up.

1317
01:19:02,375 --> 01:19:04,382
Even you can't
smoke all of it.

1318
01:19:04,422 --> 01:19:05,371
I could try.

1319
01:19:05,415 --> 01:19:08,546
Maybe nobody should have
the bloody stuff.

1320
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:14,076
All right.

1321
01:19:15,078 --> 01:19:16,125
Thank you. Matthew.

1322
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:17,661
You're welcome, Grace.

1323
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,667
Put that match out!

1324
01:19:21,702 --> 01:19:25,150
Look, I don'tknow
what's going on. but...

1325
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:26,816
I think you'd better
put it out.

1326
01:19:28,391 --> 01:19:31,358
That is the most beautiful
and awesome thing

1327
01:19:31,398 --> 01:19:33,220
I've ever seen
in my llfe.

1328
01:19:35,079 --> 01:19:36,006
Ow!

1329
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:37,468
Hello,
Mrs. Trevethan.

1330
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:39,037
I he we're
not too early.

1331
01:19:39,078 --> 01:19:39,678
Who the hell are you?

1332
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:43,652
Os.

1333
01:19:45,287 --> 01:19:46,629
Shit!

1334
01:19:46,662 --> 01:19:48,931
Aah!

1335
01:19:52,774 --> 01:19:53,723
Ladies...

1336
01:19:53,767 --> 01:19:55,676
Look, ladies
ladies. no, no, no!

1337
01:19:55,718 --> 01:19:57,606
Go on. you two.
Make a run for it.

1338
01:19:57,638 --> 01:19:58,566
What about you.
Grace?

1339
01:19:58,598 --> 01:20:00,900
Don't worry about me.
I can handle this.

1340
01:20:00,935 --> 01:20:02,528
No, we did this together.
I'm staying.

1341
01:20:02,567 --> 01:20:04,934
Look, I love you both
very much indeed.

1342
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,138
but, Matthew...
you're fired.

1343
01:20:07,174 --> 01:20:08,668
Come on.

1344
01:20:25,414 --> 01:20:27,269
Argh!
St it!

1345
01:20:27,303 --> 01:20:29,408
Get off, get off!

1346
01:20:29,447 --> 01:20:32,164
That's it, man!
You arrest him.

1347
01:20:32,198 --> 01:20:33,246
Whoa. whoa. whoa!

1348
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:34,661
What are you
arresting me for?

1349
01:20:34,695 --> 01:20:36,735
No, madam!
St there!

1350
01:20:36,775 --> 01:20:37,723
Right.

1351
01:20:54,503 --> 01:20:55,583
Wait! Wait!

1352
01:20:58,695 --> 01:21:00,517
Hello, Grace.

1353
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:18,721
Wow!

1354
01:21:20,263 --> 01:21:22,401
I trusted you.

1355
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:25,341
Whatever happened to honor
amongst thieves?

1356
01:21:25,383 --> 01:21:26,757
What about our deal?

1357
01:21:27,526 --> 01:21:29,282
It's nice to see you too.

1358
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:31,294
Can't even do
your own dirty work.

1359
01:21:31,335 --> 01:21:32,512
Dirty work??

1360
01:21:32,551 --> 01:21:33,980
Why did you
send in your boys?

1361
01:21:34,023 --> 01:21:36,030
Tokeep an eye on you.

1362
01:21:36,071 --> 01:21:38,459
To st you
from coming to any harm.

1363
01:21:38,503 --> 01:21:40,772
Do you expect me
to belleve that?

1364
01:21:40,806 --> 01:21:42,814
It's the truth.

1365
01:21:45,031 --> 01:21:47,136
I he I haven't
spoiled everything.

1366
01:21:56,582 --> 01:21:58,371
Were you trying to escape?

1367
01:22:00,806 --> 01:22:03,937
Maybe... I could help.

1368
01:22:03,975 --> 01:22:05,535
No, thank you.

1369
01:22:10,855 --> 01:22:12,643
Mrs. Trevethan!

1370
01:22:12,711 --> 01:22:14,304
Grace!

1371
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:19,900
Those fingers
through my hair

1372
01:22:19,943 --> 01:22:22,812
That sly
come hither stare...

1373
01:22:23,975 --> 01:22:26,625
That strips
my conscience bare

1374
01:22:26,663 --> 01:22:29,216
It's witchcraft

1375
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:35,740
And I've got
no defense for it

1376
01:22:35,782 --> 01:22:39,263
The heat is
too intense for it

1377
01:22:39,303 --> 01:22:43,743
What good would
common sense for it do?

1378
01:22:46,311 --> 01:22:48,350
'Cause it's witchcraft

1379
01:22:50,374 --> 01:22:52,829
Witchcraft

1380
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:53,918
I like it here.

1381
01:22:53,958 --> 01:22:57,220
And although I know

1382
01:22:57,254 --> 01:23:02,044
It's strictly taboo...

1383
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:10,565
Is this the face
of a master criminal?

1384
01:23:10,598 --> 01:23:12,191
Tonight we investigate
the mystery

1385
01:23:12,231 --> 01:23:14,467
behind Grace Trevethan.

1386
01:23:14,503 --> 01:23:17,186
How did an unknown widow
facing bankruptcy

1387
01:23:17,222 --> 01:23:19,611
save her house and become
the most celebrated

1388
01:23:19,655 --> 01:23:21,378
and controversiaI novellst
of the year?

1389
01:23:23,078 --> 01:23:25,467
Mrs. Trevethan's novel.
The Joint Venture,

1390
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:28,358
has tped the best seller llst
for over a year now.

1391
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:30,245
But although the book
is sold as fiction.

1392
01:23:30,279 --> 01:23:32,417
the story bears
a remarkable similarity

1393
01:23:32,455 --> 01:23:34,364
to Trevethan's own llfe.

1394
01:23:34,406 --> 01:23:37,887
And her recent marriage to a
mysterious french businessman

1395
01:23:37,926 --> 01:23:39,781
has fueled
tabloid speculation

1396
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:41,440
that she was at one time

1397
01:23:41,478 --> 01:23:43,584
actually involved
with the drug trade.

1398
01:23:43,623 --> 01:23:45,990
So, what is the true story?

1399
01:23:46,022 --> 01:23:48,641
We went to the sleepy village
of Port Llac to find out.

1400
01:23:48,678 --> 01:23:50,565
Turn it up, Charlle.
Turn it up.

1401
01:23:50,598 --> 01:23:52,932
Wasn't there an incident
up at Llac house?

1402
01:23:52,967 --> 01:23:54,822
The pollce were called
to the house

1403
01:23:54,854 --> 01:23:56,545
but there was a problem
with witnesses.

1404
01:23:56,582 --> 01:23:58,011
No one wanted to talk?

1405
01:23:58,054 --> 01:23:59,615
Nobody could
remember anything.

1406
01:23:59,654 --> 01:24:00,799
Excuse me.

1407
01:24:02,278 --> 01:24:04,383
We think it's fiction.
don't we, dear?

1408
01:24:04,422 --> 01:24:05,502
Yes.

1409
01:24:05,543 --> 01:24:08,226
Because in the book,

1410
01:24:08,262 --> 01:24:10,629
Grace was growing drugs.

1411
01:24:10,662 --> 01:24:13,280
but in reaI llfe,
she was growing tea!

1412
01:24:15,174 --> 01:24:17,629
Well. as a doctor,
uh. a man of science...

1413
01:24:20,678 --> 01:24:22,500
Obviously I could never
condone the use of a drug

1414
01:24:22,534 --> 01:24:25,152
for nontherapeutic,
um... thingy.

1415
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:26,881
Psst, psst, psst.

1416
01:24:26,919 --> 01:24:28,445
Have you got
anything?

1417
01:24:28,487 --> 01:24:29,981
See me later.
Okay.

1418
01:24:30,022 --> 01:24:30,883
It's good.
I s it?

1419
01:24:30,918 --> 01:24:32,162
Oh. yeah!
Oh.

1420
01:24:32,198 --> 01:24:34,686
I must say,
it does seem strange

1421
01:24:34,726 --> 01:24:37,661
that alcohoI is legal
and marijuana...

1422
01:24:37,702 --> 01:24:38,717
U h. isn't.

1423
01:24:38,758 --> 01:24:40,831
An accident of history,
I suppose.

1424
01:24:46,534 --> 01:24:48,094
So you didn't have
any marijuana

1425
01:24:48,135 --> 01:24:49,564
growing in your garden?

1426
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:52,576
Bless you.

1427
01:24:54,342 --> 01:24:55,804
So do you think
The Joint Venture

1428
01:24:55,846 --> 01:24:57,090
is fiction or fact?

1429
01:24:57,127 --> 01:24:58,501
No, it's all fiction.

1430
01:24:58,534 --> 01:25:01,568
My wife has a very fertile
imagination. thank God.

1431
01:25:01,606 --> 01:25:03,679
But what about the gangster
character, Pedro??

1432
01:25:03,718 --> 01:25:05,125
I s that based on you?

1433
01:25:05,158 --> 01:25:07,842
Pedro is Spanish.
I'm French. Don't be absurd.

1434
01:25:07,878 --> 01:25:10,147
No, but we've heard
It's time for you to go.

1435
01:25:10,182 --> 01:25:12,189
Get off my land. I said!
This my house!

1436
01:25:13,703 --> 01:25:16,004
Yet Mrs. Trevethan
refused to be interviewed

1437
01:25:16,038 --> 01:25:17,445
for this program...

1438
01:25:18,694 --> 01:25:20,636
...and to date has made
no publlc statement

1439
01:25:20,679 --> 01:25:23,100
about the rumors.
Tonight may change that

1440
01:25:23,142 --> 01:25:26,044
as we take you llve,
to the New York Book Awards.

1441
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:28,737
where Grace Trevethan
has been shortllsted

1442
01:25:28,774 --> 01:25:30,018
for The Joint Venture.

1443
01:25:30,054 --> 01:25:34,178
And the winner of the award
for fiction goes to...

1444
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,138
Grace Trevethan

1445
01:25:39,175 --> 01:25:41,444
for The Joint Venture!

1446
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:57,020
What a surprise!

1447
01:25:57,063 --> 01:25:59,267
Shh! Shh!

1448
01:25:59,302 --> 01:26:01,244
You'd think I'd be used
to surprises

1449
01:26:01,286 --> 01:26:04,286
after everything
that's happened to me.

1450
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:07,393
Iknow there's been
a lot of speculation about

1451
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:10,015
whether my book is based
on fact or fiction.

1452
01:26:10,054 --> 01:26:11,330
but...

1453
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:14,300
well... to tell you the truth.

1454
01:26:14,343 --> 01:26:16,677
if I told you everything
that's happened to me

1455
01:26:16,711 --> 01:26:18,052
over the past couple
of years.

1456
01:26:18,086 --> 01:26:19,679
you wouldn't
belleve me anyway.

1457
01:26:19,718 --> 01:26:22,401
I can hardly
belleve it myself.

1458
01:26:22,438 --> 01:26:23,812
Oh...

1459
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:25,951
Oh. I he they're
watching this at home,

1460
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:27,397
because...

1461
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:28,674
I wanted to say...

1462
01:26:32,679 --> 01:26:34,467
Matthew...

1463
01:26:34,503 --> 01:26:35,779
I wanted to tell you

1464
01:26:35,815 --> 01:26:38,782
that I think you are
a terrible gardener...

1465
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:43,390
but that you've helped me
to grow,

1466
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:45,699
and for that...

1467
01:26:45,734 --> 01:26:48,996
I thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

1468
01:26:51,366 --> 01:26:53,505
I he you're all having
a wonderfuI party...

1469
01:26:58,342 --> 01:27:00,415
Oh. and I've had
another idea.

1470
01:27:00,454 --> 01:27:03,204
and I think there
might be a book in it.

1471
01:27:07,526 --> 01:27:08,835
Thank you.

1472
