00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:05,492
You're good at stuff like this.

2
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,896
I have to find something
distinctive about myself.

3
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:14,307
-You're beautiful, Audrey.
-Seriously.

4
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:17,711
He's a cheeseball.

5
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:20,723
I don't think so.

6
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:23,473
Besides, that's just the role
he plays.

7
00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:31,547
Maybe we could work
on this together later?

8
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:37,656
Hey.

9
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:50,837
The ocean contains 97 percent
of the Earth's water...

10
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:54,285
...and generates over 70 percent
of the Earth's oxygen...

11
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:57,208
...and replenishes our fresh water
through the clouds.

12
00:03:57,383 --> 00:04:00,307
If our oceans are failing,
then so will we.

13
00:04:01,486 --> 00:04:04,758
Well done. Justin, rebuttal.

14
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:10,039
-Justin?
-Actually, I....

15
00:04:10,257 --> 00:04:11,784
I agree with Rebecca.

16
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:13,792
I saw this show on Animal Planet...

17
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,284
...about how they were giving
depressed male baboons Prozac.

18
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:22,433
Justin, this isn't Agree Club.
It's Debate Club.

19
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:25,444
If you had done your research...

20
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,674
...you'd have the confidence
to have an opinion.

21
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:33,126
And if you have an opinion that's based
on facts gathered from your research...

22
00:04:33,344 --> 00:04:35,744
...then you are confident to speak.

23
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:38,712
And speaking confidently
does what, class?

24
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:42,117
Speaking confidently...

25
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:45,171
-Wins minds.
-...that's right, wins minds.

26
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:50,103
Justin...

27
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:55,253
...if you wanna admire Rebecca,
you can do that during recess.

28
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:59,660
If you wanna compete here,
you're gonna have to apply yourself.

29
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:04,679
You can have a seat, Rebecca.

30
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:07,516
Sasha, Lewis. Well done, have a seat.

31
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:12,709
I like the Animal Planet,
though, Justin.

32
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:15,416
Great channel.

33
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:47,100
Perry is ready for you, Justin.
Come on back.

34
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:48,977
Open.

35
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:50,854
Close.

36
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,848
Justin, do they teach you about
the subconscious at school?

37
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:05,211
-A little.
-Ever heard of subconscious pressure?

38
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,270
-Involuntary behaviours?
-Like a serial killer.

39
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,671
Perhaps.

40
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:17,388
Justin, all of us carry
a certain weight.

41
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:20,442
A weight we don't recognise.

42
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:23,804
Some of us have heavy loads.

43
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,648
-In our minds?
-Yeah. A force from inside.

44
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:33,797
We don't know its name,
but it makes us do things.

45
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:36,328
Things we don't...

46
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:39,690
...like to admit.

47
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,545
-Your dad still in the six-K?
-Yeah.

48
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,691
He's very attached to the idea
of winning.

49
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:54,440
He was gonna be
a pro football player.

50
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:57,757
-He didn't get picked up?
-He injured his knee.

51
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,470
I don't think he likes me
always beating him.

52
00:07:02,732 --> 00:07:04,652
It's just for fun.

53
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,586
The Oregon State application
came in.

54
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:47,990
-So?
-So...

55
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:51,088
...there's nothing wrong
with staying close to home.

56
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,750
-What about New York?
-You don't have those grades.

57
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:57,679
You just haven't applied yourself in
a way admissions people recognise.

58
00:07:58,464 --> 00:08:01,083
You apply to some fancy,
far-off school...

59
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:04,879
-...you might be disappointed.
-Whatever.

60
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:16,793
Plate, honey. Okay....

61
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:20,198
<i>--the front for the liberation
of Palestine. Natalie.</i>

62
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:23,907
<i>And, Charles, this bombing comes
just one day after the Palestinians...</i>

63
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:26,439
<i>...paved the way
for a U.S.-back ed peace plan...</i>

64
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:30,629
<i>...by appointing that new cabinet.
How much of a setback could this be?</i>

65
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,941
What is that? You're doing it.

66
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:36,477
-Mike.
-What?

67
00:08:36,694 --> 00:08:40,579
-What--?
-What? It's pathetic.

68
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,764
-Come on. Go easy on this, Audrey.
-Hey, hey, hey. Listen.

69
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:49,133
-Maybe you could give yourself a break.
-Come on, stop with the feel-good shit.

70
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:17,239
<i>Hold on a second, now.</i>

71
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,250
<i>-What about T.J. ?
-Well...</i>

72
00:09:20,905 --> 00:09:23,872
<i>...you know I love him. It's just
the drugs. He can't beat them.</i>

73
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:25,662
<i>But he needs you, especially now.</i>

74
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:29,022
<i>After all these years,
you gotta know...</i>

75
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,728
<i>... under all those problems,
he's good people.</i>

76
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,525
<i>-What about you?
-I don't need love.</i>

77
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:39,103
<i>I'm looking for something else.</i>

78
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,821
Why didn't we bring Joel?

79
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,708
Isn't this nice, just the two of us?

80
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:01,056
Hey, Justin, come here.

81
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:07,297
What do you think?

82
00:10:07,994 --> 00:10:09,479
When are you gonna wear that?

83
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:12,315
I have to take my picture
for the Health Valley contest.

84
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:15,763
-It's the Matt Schramm thing.
-God, Audrey.

85
00:10:16,461 --> 00:10:18,949
You're very good at thinking
things are stupid.

86
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:22,091
I just wanna see if I can win.

87
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:25,190
Do I look stupid in this?

88
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:29,292
You're my mother.

89
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:34,573
-You're married to my father.
-Who I love. It's just a bit of fun.

90
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:37,148
Not for me.

91
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:42,298
Well.... Tragically, darling, you lost
your sense of humour at the age of 17.

92
00:10:56,395 --> 00:11:00,759
How did you fall in love?

93
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:03,464
God, I don't know, Justin.

94
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,607
When he hurt his knee, though,
right?

95
00:11:07,872 --> 00:11:12,411
Well, he was sort of an asshole
before he did.

96
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:17,909
But I was a brat too. I let everybody
believe I was so upset...

97
00:11:18,128 --> 00:11:20,005
...because he wasn't
gonna play anymore.

98
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:23,234
But I kind of think
that's when I fell for him.

99
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:27,293
It's nice to be needed.

100
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:31,439
I don't know. It's complicated.

101
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:32,879
Can you help me?

102
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:38,640
There's a little button on this one.

103
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:40,997
Okay.

104
00:11:44,008 --> 00:11:45,405
What about that?

105
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,936
You think someone like Matt
would like that?

106
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:50,336
Matt Schramm is not
gonna look at the pictures.

107
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:55,487
Justin, it's just a little fun.
It's just a little silly, ridiculous fun.

108
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:00,985
<i>You never even had a girlfriend.</i>

109
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,647
So what?

110
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:07,532
You don't even hang out with girls. You
just hang out with your nerdy friends.

111
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:10,063
<i>No, I do hang out with girls.</i>

112
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:12,419
<i>-Really?
-Yes.</i>

113
00:12:12,637 --> 00:12:14,863
<i>But how come you never
bring any over here?</i>

114
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:18,267
<i>Or I never, lik e, see you walking
with any or anything.</i>

115
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:21,060
<i>-I see you walking by yourself.
-Why do you care, Joel?</i>

116
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,810
<i>I don't know, because I'm bored.</i>

117
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:28,130
Creeps. They can't take
anything seriously.

118
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:29,920
Yeah, I know.

119
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:34,197
Guys in your grade have fucked girls.
You haven't even kissed one.

120
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:38,649
-Leave.
-No.

121
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:43,056
You like that book?

122
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:44,584
Oh, yeah.

123
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:46,853
It's got great stuff on Greenpeace.

124
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,170
Yeah, it's a good introduction.

125
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:53,705
Those Greenpeace guys
are really brave.

126
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:58,069
-I wish I could do something like that.
-What?

127
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:01,692
-Be brave?
-Yeah.

128
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:06,055
Maybe you already are.

129
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,993
Are you gonna fuck me now?

130
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:36,998
When you gonna clean all your
old stuff from the garage like you said?

131
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,752
Right. Sorry.

132
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:53,670
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

133
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,842
Justin.

134
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:08,421
This is stupid.

135
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,353
Why " MFC"?

136
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:19,376
Michael Forrest Cobb.

137
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:21,688
Why your name?

138
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,881
I don't think you're in a position
to be asking the questions right now.

139
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:29,674
You should stop.

140
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:32,468
I want to.

141
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:34,650
I'm trying.

142
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:37,574
Well....

143
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,891
Don't you think I want to?

144
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:43,335
Things are gonna be different.

145
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:47,219
Why can't you trust me?

146
00:14:55,337 --> 00:14:57,998
The Sierra Club made them
turn this back into a refuge...

147
00:14:58,217 --> 00:15:00,705
...because it was going to be
used for a development.

148
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:03,454
How do you know so much
about the environment?

149
00:15:03,628 --> 00:15:05,505
My parents were activists.

150
00:15:05,723 --> 00:15:09,695
See, humans think that we're the centre
of the universe, but we're not.

151
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:12,532
I guess we're trained
to think that way.

152
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,106
Yeah. It causes a lot of problems.

153
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:18,380
Yeah.

154
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:21,872
-It's hot today.
-Yeah.

155
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,017
Think I'm gonna take my shirt off.

156
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:27,981
Yeah?

157
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:31,953
-Go ahead.
-You should too.

158
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:36,361
What are you trying, Justin?

159
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,110
No, really. We're so uptight
in our clothes.

160
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:43,518
It's just like wearing
a bathing suit at the beach.

161
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:49,454
No. My stomach would get sunburned
and my mom would get mad.

162
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:51,548
Your mom looks at you naked?

163
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:54,778
Well, yeah.
I mean, don't your parents?

164
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,745
Audrey? Mike? No.

165
00:15:58,182 --> 00:16:00,975
Why do you call your parents
by their first name?

166
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:05,994
Mike says when I call him " Dad,"
he feels old...

167
00:16:06,212 --> 00:16:08,961
...and I sound like a child
or something.

168
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:12,453
And when I call Audrey " Mom,"
she seems old to him.

169
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,039
So are you gonna
take your shirt off?

170
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:19,785
You?

171
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:22,665
Yeah.

172
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:30,137
What's " MFC"?

173
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:36,246
Justin?

174
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:37,861
Justin?

175
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,912
Nothing.

176
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:42,575
It's nothing?

177
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:46,720
Well, then why don't you
just tell me?

178
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:52,743
-Justin.
-" Motherfucking cocksucker."

179
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:59,158
Why you acting like this?

180
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:03,741
What's the point of us spending time
together if it can't lead to openness?

181
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,662
I'm sorry.

182
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:11,554
Maybe you should go.

183
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:16,529
I'm sorry.

184
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:26,479
-Should I call you?
-When you're ready to be open.

185
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:46,554
You don't think it's okay for me
to be worried about this?

186
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:49,741
We spent a fortune on the braces
to try and fix what he did.

187
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,883
-He's 17.
-Yeah, but he's sucking his thumb.

188
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,982
Let's see you fix it.
You seem to have all the answers.

189
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:58,993
I think we need to get this thing
under control, that's all.

190
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,175
Yeah, that's all.

191
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:31,122
It's time we were honest
with each other.

192
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:33,828
Yeah?

193
00:20:34,962 --> 00:20:37,711
I don't wanna fix your teeth
all over again.

194
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,592
It's time to confront
the underlying issue.

195
00:20:41,726 --> 00:20:43,647
What do you mean?

196
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,928
I know what your problem is.
It's an understandable habit.

197
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,808
In fact, what's strange
is that people ever quit.

198
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:54,514
It's nature's substitute
for your mother's breast.

199
00:20:56,478 --> 00:20:58,137
How were you fed as a baby?

200
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:01,585
-From a bottle?
-I can't remember.

201
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:06,908
Any tension at home? Anxiety?

202
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:09,048
Any bad memories?

203
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:13,063
-Justin.
-Justin.

204
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:15,245
No conscious ones.

205
00:21:16,248 --> 00:21:18,867
We never remember
the big things anyway.

206
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:26,198
Some babysitter holds your mouth
shut so she can watch...

207
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:31,043
...her soap operas in peace. At 40, you
wonder why you can't stay married.

208
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,149
There's only so much I can do
with traditional orthodontics.

209
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:38,157
Justin.

210
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,858
Justin.

211
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:44,965
Are you ready to let go
of your thumb?

212
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:50,071
-Why are you talking like that?
-Answer my question.

213
00:21:51,074 --> 00:21:54,872
-What are you gonna do?
-I wanna try hypnosis.

214
00:21:56,225 --> 00:22:00,022
-No way.
-Yeah. Really, I've seen it do wonders.

215
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:04,866
You just try and relax.

216
00:22:07,877 --> 00:22:12,155
The more relaxed you are,
the deeper we can go.

217
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:16,518
Focus on the moon
in the painting.

218
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:26,120
A sense of peace...

219
00:22:26,644 --> 00:22:30,135
...like a white light
fills your body.

220
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:35,416
Imagine the white light
filling your feet...

221
00:22:35,808 --> 00:22:37,990
...then your legs.

222
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:40,697
Then your torso.

223
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:44,842
Then your head.
Imagine you're on a path.

224
00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:47,984
You're deep in the forest.

225
00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:52,349
A shaft of light
illuminates a wild animal.

226
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:56,669
This is your power animal.

227
00:22:57,194 --> 00:22:58,765
See it.

228
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:00,772
Study it.

229
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,394
When you feel like
sucking your thumb...

230
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:07,580
...I want you to call on
your power animal.

231
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:09,588
Call it now.

232
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,595
Come here.

233
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:14,039
Do it in your mind.

234
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:21,764
<i>Whenever you feel afraid, alone...</i>

235
00:23:21,982 --> 00:23:23,903
<i>... call on your power animal.</i>

236
00:23:24,426 --> 00:23:28,092
You're not alone.
You're not afraid.

237
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:31,234
You don't need your thumb.

238
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,940
And your thumb doesn't need you.

239
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:43,193
Justin, from now on, your thumb
will taste like echinacea.

240
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:49,695
What's your power animal?

241
00:23:50,524 --> 00:23:52,269
That's personal.

242
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,951
The mark of a secure nation is not
that conflicts are resolved quickly...

243
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:25,831
...but that conflicts do not arise.

244
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,711
Very nice, Ashley, thank you.

245
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:31,810
Next is Justin...

246
00:24:31,985 --> 00:24:34,167
...with an introductory statement.

247
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,741
The North American Free Trade
Agreement.

248
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:04,891
All right, look over your notes.
I'll be right back.

249
00:25:07,684 --> 00:25:09,648
-Mr. Cobb.
-I have to go.

250
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:12,005
-No, you have a speech to give.
-I can't stay.

251
00:25:12,223 --> 00:25:14,623
-Look, what's going on?
-Don't touch me.

252
00:25:38,452 --> 00:25:43,252
The Sierra Club website said
clear-cutting was up 15 percent.

253
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:45,522
Justin.

254
00:25:45,915 --> 00:25:49,537
I think we should
write a letter together.

255
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:52,897
What happened in Mr. Geary's class?

256
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:57,000
I was just....

257
00:25:57,829 --> 00:25:59,924
I had to go.

258
00:26:01,364 --> 00:26:04,768
-Do you wanna write the letter?
-Why don't you just write one?

259
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:08,434
Why are you all of a sudden
so interested in this anyways?

260
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:11,359
Because it's important.

261
00:26:12,712 --> 00:26:16,028
Because people
should know this stuff, right?

262
00:26:16,246 --> 00:26:17,600
Yeah.

263
00:26:17,817 --> 00:26:22,313
So you're into getting the truth out,
being honest and open?

264
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:24,539
Yeah.

265
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:27,638
So why can't you tell me
what MFC means?

266
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:30,779
Why can't you tell me
what happened in class?

267
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:33,835
Because that's nothing.

268
00:26:39,551 --> 00:26:41,516
Nothing, right.

269
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:47,451
Goodbye, Justin.

270
00:26:58,448 --> 00:26:59,714
Perry.

271
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:02,726
<i>-It work ed.
-That's wonderful.</i>

272
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:07,788
No, I didn't think it would be like this.
Can you put it back or something?

273
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:11,062
Your subconscious
has taken its course.

274
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:13,418
Please, I really feel crazy.

275
00:27:13,637 --> 00:27:15,164
<i>Stick with it, Justin.</i>

276
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,699
Call on your power animal for help.

277
00:27:35,283 --> 00:27:38,687
-I'm sorry.
-What's going on, Justin?

278
00:27:39,647 --> 00:27:41,218
I don't know.

279
00:27:41,436 --> 00:27:43,662
It's okay. You're okay.

280
00:27:44,012 --> 00:27:45,888
I'll get this.

281
00:27:56,624 --> 00:27:59,287
This is gonna be stupid.
I thought you liked that guy.

282
00:27:59,505 --> 00:28:02,036
He just pretended
to be my friend, Joel.

283
00:28:02,254 --> 00:28:03,869
If you're scared, you can go home.

284
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,574
All right.

285
00:28:06,793 --> 00:28:08,888
Joel.

286
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,169
I'm sorry, okay?

287
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:16,700
Perry fucked me up.

288
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,937
How?

289
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,508
He said he'd help me...

290
00:28:23,726 --> 00:28:26,694
...and then he just
fucked me up, okay?

291
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:31,887
Joel. Just this once.

292
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,331
Please.

293
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,735
Goddamn it.

294
00:29:25,088 --> 00:29:29,408
Mr. and Mrs. Cobb, Justin's
always shown a lot of promise.

295
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:34,252
But I feel that something comes
between him and his potential.

296
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:36,434
And with college just ahead...

297
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:39,838
-...Justin needs to maximise right now.
-Yes.

298
00:29:42,152 --> 00:29:45,992
-Well?
-Well, I feel that...

299
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:50,618
...in light of recent behaviour,
that Justin needs an adjustment.

300
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,371
Justin, have you ever suspected...

301
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,819
...that you were different
from other teenagers?

302
00:29:58,343 --> 00:30:02,532
Not as patient,
can't finish what you've started.

303
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:06,897
Terrified of being left alone,
but angry when you feel crowded.

304
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:10,388
-A little.
-It's classic hyperactive teen.

305
00:30:10,606 --> 00:30:14,403
Attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder. ADHD.

306
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:18,331
We'd like you to think about
a stimulant drug treatment for Justin.

307
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,212
-You mean, like Ritalin?
-That's one of the many drugs...

308
00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:25,183
...that a doctor could prescribe.
There's Adderall, Clonidine, Tenex.

309
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:28,892
If this is all just coming down
to medication--

310
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,907
Look, I think that my son can
handle this if he puts his mind to it.

311
00:30:33,126 --> 00:30:36,661
Mr. Geary, don't you feel that Justin
could do much better?

312
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:40,545
Justin has exhibited...

313
00:30:40,763 --> 00:30:44,342
...some of the behaviour
that fits this particular profile.

314
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:50,015
Excuse me, these symptoms
they have here, they're pretty vague.

315
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,638
" Ignores information.
Makes mistakes.

316
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:57,784
Seems restless.
Avoids, dislikes or is reluctant...

317
00:30:58,003 --> 00:31:01,668
...to engage in work that requires
sustained mental effort."

318
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:09,873
What'd you think, Justin?

319
00:31:13,146 --> 00:31:15,721
So my problems are
just because I'm hyper?

320
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:25,235
It says I'll have more confidence
and self-control.

321
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:30,079
-I'll have better relationships.
-Is that how you feel? Out of control?

322
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:33,527
It just all sounds too easy to me.
You know, take a pill, change.

323
00:31:33,746 --> 00:31:35,229
What if Mrs. Wood is right?

324
00:31:35,447 --> 00:31:38,765
What if the trouble was, all along,
I just can't concentrate...

325
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:41,601
...I can't focus on anything?

326
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,220
It just still seems too easy.

327
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:46,925
Haven't you ever wanted to change?

328
00:31:47,144 --> 00:31:51,465
-Yes, I have. But it's not that simple.
-Maybe it is.

329
00:33:57,198 --> 00:33:58,507
Amazing.

330
00:33:58,725 --> 00:34:00,472
Joel.

331
00:34:01,257 --> 00:34:03,309
What happened?

332
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:06,581
I changed.

333
00:34:10,335 --> 00:34:14,873
-What do you mean, you've changed?
-I mean, it works.

334
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:16,750
It really works.

335
00:34:17,143 --> 00:34:19,980
<i>-Your pills?
-Yeah.</i>

336
00:34:20,503 --> 00:34:22,947
<i>I never thought that I
would feel so clear.</i>

337
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:27,006
-Who'd like to talk on whiteness?
-Whiteness stands for eternity.

338
00:34:27,355 --> 00:34:29,058
The blankness
of uninterrupted time.

339
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,462
It represents both innocence
and extinction.

340
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,207
The beginning and the end.

341
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:36,782
How are you doing
with the medication?

342
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,705
<i>-I read Moby Dick straight through.
-That's great.</i>

343
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:42,630
-But how do you feel?
-I feel...

344
00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:46,733
...like me.
I never really did before.

345
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:51,053
Have you had any other breakthroughs
besides the book?

346
00:34:51,315 --> 00:34:55,024
It used to be kind of a hassle
to put on underwear in the morning.

347
00:34:55,242 --> 00:34:57,206
But now it's kind of easy.

348
00:34:59,956 --> 00:35:02,793
I listened to the words
to the Pledge of Allegiance today...

349
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:04,713
...and they gave me chills.

350
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:09,732
I've always felt that you have a real
sensitivity when it comes to language.

351
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:13,791
And I know that you're smart.
I think that you see a lot more...

352
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:16,540
...than you take responsibility for.

353
00:35:16,802 --> 00:35:19,988
That kind of perception you have,
that can't be taught by anyone.

354
00:35:21,777 --> 00:35:23,610
Rebecca left the debate team.

355
00:35:23,828 --> 00:35:26,621
Did she say anything to you
about why or...?

356
00:35:27,146 --> 00:35:28,629
No.

357
00:35:28,803 --> 00:35:32,339
Well, I need somebody to step up
and take her place.

358
00:35:33,343 --> 00:35:35,787
I'd like for you to compete with us.

359
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:40,630
You think I could do it?

360
00:35:41,852 --> 00:35:43,992
Yes, I do.

361
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:49,621
-What happened to Mike?
-He tried his best. He couldn't make it.

362
00:35:50,407 --> 00:35:51,497
The door's up there.

363
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,898
-I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
-Okay.

364
00:35:57,826 --> 00:35:59,397
Nervous?

365
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:01,841
-Something.
-Completely understandable.

366
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:05,027
This isn't a classroom situation.
And that's a whole other...

367
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:07,471
...new thing for you to process.

368
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:10,526
I wish I was bald.

369
00:36:10,745 --> 00:36:13,494
-Bitch.
-Your hair seems fine.

370
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:18,032
-Okay, now you're making it worse.
-I'm sorry.

371
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,869
-Did you see the girls?
-Yeah. I saw Rene in the hall.

372
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:23,313
Okay, go round them up.
Bring them in here.

373
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:25,102
-It's a men's room.
-That's okay.

374
00:36:25,321 --> 00:36:27,546
I'm a teacher. I'm a teacher.

375
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:30,732
Nothing you can do.

376
00:36:30,951 --> 00:36:32,609
<i>Butterflies are understandable.</i>

377
00:36:32,871 --> 00:36:36,580
What I wanna do is go back to the
basics. Let's remember our posturing.

378
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,461
Breathing.

379
00:36:39,984 --> 00:36:43,302
Rene, I really want you to use
your eye contact today.

380
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,447
Let me emphasise your eyes. I got
some mascara. Lose the windows.

381
00:36:48,146 --> 00:36:50,982
Let's do some impromptus:
Maintenance.

382
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:53,951
It is important in any system
to ensure that all pieces...

383
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:58,401
...particularly the most important ones,
are working and properly maintained.

384
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:01,020
Stop on a dime. Rebuttal.

385
00:37:01,238 --> 00:37:04,207
The Bill of Rights was intentionally
made by our forefathers...

386
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:07,086
...to be useful for themselves
and posterity...

387
00:37:07,348 --> 00:37:09,879
-...as it says in the Declaration--
-You're a killer.

388
00:37:10,098 --> 00:37:12,193
You're a stone-faced killer.

389
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:14,681
-What's not debatable?
-Our debating.

390
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:17,037
-Line them up.
-And knock them down.

391
00:37:17,256 --> 00:37:18,826
You guys are gonna do great.

392
00:37:30,173 --> 00:37:32,705
<i>Okay. Today's topic
for spar is the media...</i>

393
00:37:32,923 --> 00:37:34,975
<i>... with an emphasis on TV violence.</i>

394
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:37,157
Elise Burns.

395
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:41,564
It's just sick. TV violence kills morality,
particularly among teens.

396
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:44,925
Studies prove it. Day after day,
kids watch shows with gunfights.

397
00:37:45,187 --> 00:37:47,369
And the next thing you know,
someone's dead.

398
00:37:47,631 --> 00:37:49,987
Television is a Trojan horse
in our homes.

399
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:52,606
It claims to give us education
and entertainment...

400
00:37:52,824 --> 00:37:56,228
...but it really just takes the
imaginations of today's youth hostage.

401
00:37:56,489 --> 00:38:00,636
I agree. Media conglomerates say they
wanna change, but it's all double talk.

402
00:38:00,854 --> 00:38:03,647
I mean, accountability
needs to be enforced.

403
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:05,655
I concur. But let's go further.

404
00:38:05,873 --> 00:38:08,273
TV contributes to the decay
of the American family.

405
00:38:08,492 --> 00:38:11,503
And once the family goes,
down goes our institutions...

406
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:14,994
...and up goes our drug abuse.
Ditto, gambling and pornography.

407
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:17,133
You have no evidence
to support that claim.

408
00:38:19,403 --> 00:38:21,235
Images aren't reality.

409
00:38:21,453 --> 00:38:24,683
Violence in art goes back to Egypt.

410
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:27,956
What's important is teaching people
to be sceptical.

411
00:38:28,174 --> 00:38:33,149
To draw a line. To distinguish
between images and life.

412
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:36,379
Lisa, what's your opinion?

413
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:39,565
Well, you're right. TV's not real.

414
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:42,882
Hold on. Reality is not the point here.
Social decline is.

415
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:45,806
-Kate, reaction?
-Oh, no, go ahead.

416
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,817
Mark, I understand the spirit
of your refutation.

417
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:54,054
But society and its conception
of reality are inextricable.

418
00:38:57,284 --> 00:38:58,550
Well?

419
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:00,557
-Did we live or die?
-You were right.

420
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:02,914
-I was good.
-That's great, Justin.

421
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,572
That's good to hear.

422
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:06,448
You were....

423
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:11,293
Yeah. I'd never seen you
look that way before. Yeah.

424
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:13,868
You grew up.

425
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,680
Passive acceptance of the impact
of genetic engineering...

426
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:23,513
...is itself an act of aggression.

427
00:39:23,774 --> 00:39:26,743
But that's the problem.
Passive acceptance of the impact...

428
00:39:27,004 --> 00:39:30,364
...of genetic engineering
is itself an act of aggression.

429
00:39:32,111 --> 00:39:34,030
No, you should see him.

430
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,737
And he wears this tie.

431
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:42,279
It's important to be supportive.

432
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,639
And seen.

433
00:39:48,738 --> 00:39:53,626
You know, it was almost easier
when he was always fucking up.

434
00:39:54,237 --> 00:39:55,808
Yeah.

435
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:04,101
It's like he thinks
he's smarter than me.

436
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,392
Well, maybe that's the way it goes.

437
00:40:20,466 --> 00:40:22,255
My worthy opponent.
My worthy opponent.

438
00:40:22,517 --> 00:40:24,263
Isn't isolationism a bankrupt policy?

439
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:26,707
Isn't isolationism a bankrupt policy?

440
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:29,500
Nations no longer exist independently
of one another.

441
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,206
-And the name of this cell part?
-Mitochondria.

442
00:40:32,686 --> 00:40:35,523
The very existence
of weapons of mass destruction...

443
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:38,403
...is in contradiction
to our idea of diplomacy.

444
00:40:39,277 --> 00:40:40,585
<i>Thank you for seeing me.</i>

445
00:40:40,848 --> 00:40:46,171
Well, I have a background in med surg,
but I've floated in orthopaedics.

446
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:50,274
I've always had a great interest
in psych and rehab nursing.

447
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:53,722
I think my RN skills
would be useful here.

448
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,174
And I've taken continuing ed.
in psych and rehab.

449
00:40:58,828 --> 00:41:01,621
It's a thing that's
always interested me.

450
00:41:04,938 --> 00:41:07,557
You're angry, and that's human.
But it's not a solution.

451
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:10,961
We have to overcome the idea
that everyone is the same.

452
00:41:13,884 --> 00:41:17,071
Andy Smalley said
your old girlfriend's a stoner now.

453
00:41:17,332 --> 00:41:18,904
Rebecca?

454
00:41:20,038 --> 00:41:21,522
She hates stoners.

455
00:41:42,863 --> 00:41:44,041
-Hi.
-Hello.

456
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:45,569
-Last name is Geary.
-Okay.

457
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:47,839
G as in Gerald, E-A-R-Y.

458
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,414
-Here it is. Two rooms.
-Great.

459
00:41:50,632 --> 00:41:53,032
One for the boys
and one for the girls.

460
00:41:53,686 --> 00:41:56,262
Don't you think
we should do this by age?

461
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,404
It's against school policy.
You can't have males with females.

462
00:41:59,622 --> 00:42:01,281
-Thank you.
-I'll say I sneaked in.

463
00:42:01,499 --> 00:42:03,812
-I'll take the blame.
-What's this about?

464
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:06,474
I just wanna be with people
my own age.

465
00:42:06,779 --> 00:42:08,874
We can prepare better.

466
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,159
Oh, my God.

467
00:42:19,435 --> 00:42:22,098
-I call my own bed.
-Which one of you is on the couch?

468
00:42:22,316 --> 00:42:23,364
-You.
-You.

469
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,243
-Boys get the couch.
-Amen, sister.

470
00:42:26,506 --> 00:42:28,731
<i>And now our shocking
Access Hollywood exclusive:</i>

471
00:42:29,212 --> 00:42:32,572
<i>TV star Matt Schramm
check ed into drug rehab today.</i>

472
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:37,110
<i>Schramm was suffering from
a $1000-a-day cocaine habit.</i>

473
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:40,864
<i>On Friday, producers of his hit show,
The Line, staged an intervention...</i>

474
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:43,527
<i>... with some of Matt's
closest family and friends.</i>

475
00:42:43,788 --> 00:42:46,102
<i>Schramm was receptive
to their pleas....</i>

476
00:42:46,276 --> 00:42:49,462
-Anybody want any peach schnapps?
-I only drink beer.

477
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,124
-Yeah, me too.
-Come on.

478
00:42:52,342 --> 00:42:55,484
-Maybe we can order room service.
-We're minors.

479
00:42:57,187 --> 00:42:58,932
Why don't you ask Geary to get it.

480
00:42:59,194 --> 00:43:02,162
Yeah, Justin. He'll get it if you ask.

481
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:07,093
<i>Are you putting me in a position
to buy alcohol for minors?</i>

482
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:08,882
People do it all the time.

483
00:43:09,144 --> 00:43:12,505
Yes, I can understand
that you guys wanna unwind a little.

484
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:14,033
You've worked hard...

485
00:43:14,251 --> 00:43:17,175
...and you'd like to enjoy yourselves.

486
00:43:17,437 --> 00:43:19,182
<i>But I am a teacher.</i>

487
00:43:19,444 --> 00:43:23,503
We think of you more as a peer.
A friend.

488
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:28,129
<i>That's the line you're gonna use?
I hope your head's better tomorrow.</i>

489
00:43:28,348 --> 00:43:31,227
<i>Don't k eep me on.
You'll talk yourself out of a six-pack.</i>

490
00:43:33,584 --> 00:43:36,771
I thought about it.
I don't think it's a good idea.

491
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,742
You should be doing your impromptus
and getting ready for the meet.

492
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,531
What?

493
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,899
-Here's your six-pack.
-That's messed up.

494
00:43:48,117 --> 00:43:50,910
One is gonna go a long way
with the pills you're on.

495
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:55,275
-So go slow, okay? Have fun.
-I understand. Thank you.

496
00:43:58,155 --> 00:44:00,729
-Line them up.
-And knock them down.

497
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:07,146
Make room. Okay.

498
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,200
It's all wet now. Take it off.

499
00:44:11,728 --> 00:44:12,819
Where did this go?

500
00:44:21,678 --> 00:44:23,075
Oh, my.

501
00:44:24,689 --> 00:44:26,828
Wait, I think that's your--

502
00:44:30,275 --> 00:44:32,196
Guys. Oh, guys.

503
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:35,470
-Are you okay?
-Shit.

504
00:44:37,782 --> 00:44:39,615
-Oh, my God.
-Shit.

505
00:44:39,834 --> 00:44:40,924
Oh, my God. Shit.

506
00:44:41,142 --> 00:44:43,849
Why am I getting a call
from the front desk?

507
00:44:44,023 --> 00:44:46,293
We were just having a normal time.

508
00:44:46,511 --> 00:44:48,475
Do you think I'm stupid?

509
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:50,875
You're not stupid.

510
00:44:51,093 --> 00:44:54,191
You just feel left out,
and I can understand that.

511
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:56,287
You see us having fun
and you feel alone.

512
00:44:56,505 --> 00:44:59,124
But that doesn't mean that we were
doing anything wrong.

513
00:45:00,127 --> 00:45:01,698
Look, Kevin.

514
00:45:01,917 --> 00:45:05,234
Your pro-disarmament views
do not reflect the international climate.

515
00:45:05,713 --> 00:45:08,550
They just reflect your need
for everything to be nice.

516
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:10,034
To be friendly.

517
00:45:10,296 --> 00:45:13,264
-But humans are inherently hostile.
-You're missing my point.

518
00:45:13,525 --> 00:45:15,925
I don't think you know
what your point really is.

519
00:45:16,144 --> 00:45:18,806
If we're to take disarmament seriously,
I propose that...

520
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:21,337
...we look at the real weapons.

521
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:23,258
Our minds.

522
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:34,867
How do you feel?

523
00:45:37,005 --> 00:45:39,711
Tired. But good.

524
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:42,067
Why do you feel good?

525
00:45:42,548 --> 00:45:44,730
Because I'm winning.

526
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:48,963
-What about learning?
-I'm learning how to win.

527
00:45:51,538 --> 00:45:53,720
You're so hungry, Justin.

528
00:45:54,549 --> 00:45:56,644
I never really took that into account.

529
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,111
Here he goes, Mr. Lightning Dealer.

530
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:07,162
-Hey.
-Hey.

531
00:46:07,424 --> 00:46:11,177
Yeah. Another Cobb success story
on our hands.

532
00:46:11,395 --> 00:46:13,446
Let me see that thing.

533
00:46:15,803 --> 00:46:18,203
-First.
-It's something, huh?

534
00:46:18,421 --> 00:46:20,212
That is something.

535
00:46:25,187 --> 00:46:28,198
How would you know?
You don't even show up.

536
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,209
I work.

537
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,104
Actually, I have some news.

538
00:46:38,498 --> 00:46:42,076
I'm being transferred
to the Maple Glen facility.

539
00:46:42,337 --> 00:46:43,952
-The celebrity rehab place.
-Yeah.

540
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:46,659
I went today
for the introduction session.

541
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:48,928
-This was in the works?
-Yeah.

542
00:46:49,147 --> 00:46:51,590
It's actually a pretty big promotion.

543
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:53,685
So did you see any celebrities?

544
00:46:53,903 --> 00:46:56,434
-It's not just for celebrities.
-Right.

545
00:46:57,089 --> 00:47:00,014
-Well, you seem happy.
-Yeah.

546
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:02,282
Yeah? That's great.

547
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:06,341
So who'd you see? Matthew Perry?
Whitney Houston? Robert Downey Jr.?

548
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,527
You know, I signed an agreement.
I'm can't leak names.

549
00:47:09,745 --> 00:47:14,502
-But you can tell us. We're your family.
-Well, I can't. I'm sorry.

550
00:47:14,764 --> 00:47:16,117
Come on.

551
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:20,350
They're my patients, people with
problems. I'm there to help them.

552
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:25,457
So now these celebrities
are more important than your family.

553
00:47:26,504 --> 00:47:28,555
Justin.

554
00:47:29,952 --> 00:47:32,701
I think working at Maple Glen
is a bad idea.

555
00:47:34,883 --> 00:47:37,458
Well, I don't think I asked you.

556
00:47:37,895 --> 00:47:39,422
I just won the regionals.

557
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,695
I come home, you can't say
what celebrities you're working with?

558
00:47:42,957 --> 00:47:45,576
-Hey, easy.
-I'm done.

559
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:51,904
-I'm out too.
-Where you going?

560
00:48:15,733 --> 00:48:20,053
I'm just afraid places like that
pamper to those big star egos.

561
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:24,549
I mean, statistics show most addicts
don't recover anyway.

562
00:48:24,767 --> 00:48:26,426
What statistics?

563
00:48:27,472 --> 00:48:30,833
-I read it.
-Well, we're not having a debate.

564
00:48:31,052 --> 00:48:32,797
This is my life.

565
00:48:33,015 --> 00:48:34,849
You found something
to make you happy.

566
00:48:35,067 --> 00:48:36,768
Let me be happy.

567
00:48:37,816 --> 00:48:39,954
What happened
to that Health Valley contest?

568
00:48:40,172 --> 00:48:42,617
God, Justin. Nothing.

569
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:46,980
You must have heard by now.

570
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:49,425
You know,
it's none of your business.

571
00:48:49,643 --> 00:48:53,179
It was just a distraction.
It was something to do.

572
00:49:23,466 --> 00:49:25,299
My grades...

573
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:28,703
...are below your standards.

574
00:49:29,445 --> 00:49:32,544
But I see this as....
As a strength.

575
00:49:33,155 --> 00:49:34,770
Not a weakness.

576
00:49:35,031 --> 00:49:37,388
I've had to overcome....

577
00:49:37,649 --> 00:49:39,526
Overcome. Overcome...

578
00:49:39,789 --> 00:49:41,272
...unusual obstacles.

579
00:49:44,676 --> 00:49:46,946
Both my parents....

580
00:49:49,128 --> 00:49:51,091
Both my parents...

581
00:49:53,535 --> 00:49:56,983
...suffer from mental illness.

582
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,479
It's made my life difficult.

583
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,486
Mental illness.

584
00:50:03,705 --> 00:50:07,806
This has made my life difficult.
But also...

585
00:50:08,025 --> 00:50:10,992
...given me a valuable perspective.

586
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:14,135
I would like...

587
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:18,804
...to apply this sensitivity
to a career in TV journalism.

588
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,213
I wanna show the world
what's really happening...

589
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,966
...the way I've had to with my family.

590
00:50:28,843 --> 00:50:31,374
I just can't deal with him right now.

591
00:50:31,592 --> 00:50:33,119
<i>Well, you two are arguing.</i>

592
00:50:33,337 --> 00:50:35,563
Oh, he can be such
a little shit sometimes.

593
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:37,266
<i>Easy.</i>

594
00:50:38,007 --> 00:50:39,622
He doesn't need anybody to go.

595
00:50:39,884 --> 00:50:43,986
<i>-Isn't it the state finals or something?
-He'll be fine.</i>

596
00:50:45,689 --> 00:50:48,961
<i>-Oh, I'll go.
-No, you don't have to do that.</i>

597
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,060
No, I wanna see him.

598
00:50:52,322 --> 00:50:56,730
-Really?
-God. Yeah, I'll go.

599
00:51:08,645 --> 00:51:11,132
That's $3.20. Thanks a lot.

600
00:51:14,928 --> 00:51:16,587
Perry.

601
00:51:18,725 --> 00:51:20,122
You look different.

602
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:24,094
-Nice tie.
-Debate team.

603
00:51:24,355 --> 00:51:26,974
I've been meaning to call you.
I owe you an apology.

604
00:51:27,498 --> 00:51:31,163
I've been meaning to call you too.
I wanted to thank you.

605
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,346
Really?

606
00:51:33,565 --> 00:51:37,448
I was lost in a cloud
of hippie psychobabble.

607
00:51:38,147 --> 00:51:40,721
You helped bring me
back down to earth.

608
00:51:42,074 --> 00:51:44,388
I've rewritten my whole philosophy
of life.

609
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,403
Found new answers
to my questions.

610
00:51:49,755 --> 00:51:51,675
Yeah, me too.

611
00:51:52,811 --> 00:51:55,341
There's no try. There's only do.

612
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,615
That's something that I've learned.

613
00:51:58,833 --> 00:51:59,968
What do you think?

614
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:05,641
How's your dad?

615
00:52:07,038 --> 00:52:10,398
-He's fine. Same.
-Your mom?

616
00:52:11,402 --> 00:52:15,548
She's got a new job
working with drug addicts.

617
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:18,079
And what about your thumb?

618
00:52:20,131 --> 00:52:22,094
Have you been sucking it?

619
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:34,009
Actually, I was diagnosed
with attention deficit disorder.

620
00:52:34,227 --> 00:52:37,500
It's a real problem.
Now I'm on medication.

621
00:52:37,718 --> 00:52:39,813
I was just concerned.

622
00:52:40,861 --> 00:52:42,563
Well, I'm better.

623
00:52:42,999 --> 00:52:48,062
I'm leading the team
at the state debates tomorrow.

624
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,244
Medication, huh?

625
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,295
Yeah, I feel great.

626
00:52:52,644 --> 00:52:54,870
Euphoric, even?

627
00:52:58,143 --> 00:53:00,630
Aren't you just my orthodontist?

628
00:53:01,329 --> 00:53:03,773
I like to think of myself...

629
00:53:03,992 --> 00:53:05,868
...as more than that.

630
00:53:08,574 --> 00:53:10,625
Take care, Justin.

631
00:53:26,642 --> 00:53:30,046
-What are you doing?
-No wonder. This stuff's just speed.

632
00:53:30,264 --> 00:53:32,184
-It calms me down.
-That's what they say.

633
00:53:32,402 --> 00:53:35,283
But you focus. Three molecules
different than cocaine.

634
00:53:35,501 --> 00:53:36,767
A doctor gave it to me.

635
00:53:36,985 --> 00:53:40,171
I saw the special on PBS.
Teachers are overmedicating kids--

636
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:43,575
TV is a great source
for our information, isn't it?

637
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:46,194
Whatever, speed freak.

638
00:53:51,649 --> 00:53:53,918
<i>I think you're confusing tone
and content.</i>

639
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,890
I mean, tone has tone,
but content is silent.

640
00:53:58,981 --> 00:54:00,726
Silent?

641
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:04,698
It's not quite silent.
It's just that the tone is muted.

642
00:54:04,959 --> 00:54:07,578
A tone that you shouldn't hear
in the content.

643
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,811
-You're missing the point.
-Look, if silence is neutral...

644
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:14,562
...then the tone...

645
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,481
...will be quieter.

646
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,845
And the content
would be neutral but heard.

647
00:54:21,107 --> 00:54:22,722
What are you saying?

648
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,582
Hey.

649
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,894
-Finally got to see you.
-Don't patronise me.

650
00:54:34,113 --> 00:54:37,212
Come on, I'm just trying to say
something, you know?

651
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:39,481
I think I'm gonna quit
the debate team.

652
00:54:39,656 --> 00:54:41,532
-You were doing well.
-Too much pressure.

653
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,147
-It's no reason to quit.
-Mike.

654
00:54:43,365 --> 00:54:44,805
What?

655
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,991
You're not helping.

656
00:54:50,173 --> 00:54:53,010
Well, you should....

657
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:56,327
-What am I supposed to say?
-I don't know.

658
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:01,390
All right, come on. Let's go home.
Come on.

659
00:55:02,873 --> 00:55:04,183
Come on.

660
00:55:06,758 --> 00:55:08,635
<i>Justin, it's...</i>

661
00:55:09,158 --> 00:55:12,911
...in my professional opinion
that you've become a monster.

662
00:55:13,915 --> 00:55:15,487
What?

663
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:21,073
-You used to love me.
-Don't get grandiose with this.

664
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:23,298
What was that all about my gift?

665
00:55:23,517 --> 00:55:25,262
And you told me--

666
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,186
You built it up.
You told me I had a talent.

667
00:55:28,404 --> 00:55:30,499
Yeah, you do.
You have a real intensity.

668
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,467
You have a great understanding
of group dynamics.

669
00:55:33,685 --> 00:55:36,784
But there's also a lot of things
that you need to work on, Justin.

670
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:41,235
Like glibness,
arrogance, self-control.

671
00:55:41,846 --> 00:55:43,592
Shall I go on?

672
00:55:44,246 --> 00:55:45,730
At least I still have a dream.

673
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:49,309
Well, that's great.

674
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,494
Is that how you see me?

675
00:55:53,891 --> 00:55:56,423
That's what we've come to, Justin?

676
00:55:56,641 --> 00:55:59,390
I already decided.
I'm quitting the debate team.

677
00:56:04,147 --> 00:56:06,068
That's my fault.

678
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:12,439
Thank you very much.

679
00:56:16,018 --> 00:56:17,720
Good luck to you.

680
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,176
You look terrible.

681
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:46,096
You okay?

682
00:57:47,973 --> 00:57:50,766
-I'm not sick.
-Let me see.

683
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,654
I stopped taking my pills.

684
00:57:56,308 --> 00:57:58,447
They're just speed.

685
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:04,164
They're just three molecules
different than cocaine.

686
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:10,100
You know, it's not good for you
to quit cold turkey.

687
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:11,976
But I can.

688
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,013
What?

689
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:47,806
I need to talk to you.

690
00:58:49,509 --> 00:58:51,210
Come in.

691
00:58:57,146 --> 00:58:58,587
What's up?

692
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:06,704
How did you feel
when you had to quit football?

693
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,293
Horrible.

694
00:59:13,992 --> 00:59:17,440
-How did you deal with it?
-You have to, you know, tough it out.

695
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,233
You know, tough it out.

696
00:59:20,451 --> 00:59:22,197
-Mike.
-What?

697
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:27,478
-I just thought you could help for once.
-Hey, I help.

698
00:59:27,696 --> 00:59:29,179
Then how did you do it?

699
00:59:32,366 --> 00:59:36,730
Why can't you ever tell me anything
about how you deal with things?

700
00:59:58,944 --> 01:00:03,395
-Hey, Justin.
-Hey. How's it going?

701
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:07,847
-So I hear you're the debate star now.
-Not anymore.

702
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,168
-You look the same.
-You don't.

703
01:00:12,647 --> 01:00:14,306
Not really.

704
01:00:15,048 --> 01:00:17,710
-I need to talk to you.
-Look, Justin, I'm sorry.

705
01:00:17,928 --> 01:00:20,241
-I just don't wanna--
-No, not that.

706
01:00:21,463 --> 01:00:23,384
Did you ever feel like...?

707
01:00:23,602 --> 01:00:26,482
Like you really wanted to...

708
01:00:27,137 --> 01:00:29,363
...I don't know, change?

709
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,077
Maybe.

710
01:00:34,469 --> 01:00:36,651
Why are you telling this to me?

711
01:00:37,786 --> 01:00:41,496
Do you have any pot?
I heard you were doing it.

712
01:00:41,714 --> 01:00:43,415
Gossip.

713
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:45,946
It's true, though, right?

714
01:00:47,256 --> 01:00:49,700
What, you want me to get you high?

715
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,363
Yeah. Maybe.

716
01:00:53,976 --> 01:00:55,591
Really?

717
01:01:11,653 --> 01:01:13,791
-Hey.
-Hi.

718
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:17,544
I finally found this.
I didn't know which house it was.

719
01:01:19,857 --> 01:01:22,214
Are you stoned right now?

720
01:01:23,828 --> 01:01:26,621
You don't make a big deal out of it.

721
01:01:27,844 --> 01:01:30,026
You still want some, right?

722
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:32,644
Yeah.

723
01:01:33,299 --> 01:01:35,655
You're not still all weird, are you?

724
01:01:36,354 --> 01:01:38,143
I wasn't weird.

725
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,282
Really?

726
01:01:41,984 --> 01:01:44,078
Suck.

727
01:01:44,908 --> 01:01:46,392
Suck.

728
01:01:53,287 --> 01:01:55,077
It gets easier.

729
01:02:00,357 --> 01:02:03,456
Did you just give that to him
for free?

730
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:08,038
I would've made him pay.

731
01:02:12,534 --> 01:02:14,367
Do you want some?

732
01:02:15,371 --> 01:02:16,767
Yeah.

733
01:02:17,989 --> 01:02:20,127
Tell me the boys...

734
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:22,528
...who have assne.

735
01:02:26,106 --> 01:02:28,245
-Have what?
-Assne.

736
01:02:28,463 --> 01:02:31,213
Ass acne.

737
01:02:31,431 --> 01:02:34,747
I'm sure that you've seen them
in your P.E. class.

738
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:42,559
Billy Rydell.

739
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:49,018
Mike Green.

740
01:02:50,197 --> 01:02:53,165
Rian Stevenson. Brent Bregman.

741
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:00,933
Brent.

742
01:03:31,613 --> 01:03:36,327
" I will not compare my insides
to others' outsides."

743
01:03:49,769 --> 01:03:51,646
-What's that?
-Nothing.

744
01:03:51,864 --> 01:03:55,617
-No, it's something. What is it?
-It's nothing. Don't hassle me.

745
01:03:56,577 --> 01:03:59,021
You better get moving.
Audrey's working nights now--

746
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:01,726
She's sleeping.
She doesn't even care.

747
01:04:07,618 --> 01:04:11,023
I don't know what
the two of you are thinking.

748
01:04:18,267 --> 01:04:20,188
What's your problem?

749
01:04:20,668 --> 01:04:23,418
-Nothing.
-Right.

750
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:29,789
I think my mom's having an affair.

751
01:04:30,487 --> 01:04:32,189
Are you sure?

752
01:04:33,368 --> 01:04:35,113
Pretty sure.

753
01:04:50,738 --> 01:04:52,876
You could see it coming.

754
01:04:54,535 --> 01:04:56,454
Anybody could see it coming.

755
01:04:56,717 --> 01:04:58,724
Don't be so serious.

756
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,387
Here.

757
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,220
What?

758
01:05:06,362 --> 01:05:09,417
-We're gonna play a game.
-What kind of a game?

759
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,646
You'll see.

760
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:15,919
Well, actually, you won't.

761
01:05:45,945 --> 01:05:47,778
No, no, no.

762
01:05:47,997 --> 01:05:50,265
Just touch, don't look, okay?

763
01:05:51,052 --> 01:05:52,579
Why?

764
01:05:53,757 --> 01:05:56,899
Because those are the rules,
all right?

765
01:06:16,713 --> 01:06:18,590
How was work?

766
01:06:22,517 --> 01:06:24,351
How was work?

767
01:06:25,267 --> 01:06:27,667
It was really good, actually.

768
01:06:28,889 --> 01:06:30,592
It was really good.

769
01:06:31,377 --> 01:06:33,647
Doesn't it get depressing?

770
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:37,880
Seeing all those people who have
everything just throw it all away?

771
01:06:38,097 --> 01:06:41,066
No. It's humbling.

772
01:06:42,113 --> 01:06:45,081
Last night, this guy said to me:

773
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:47,786
" I was born...

774
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,405
...addicted to fantasy."

775
01:06:58,479 --> 01:07:00,792
<i>Doing great, ma'am.
Push, okay? Push.</i>

776
01:07:01,053 --> 01:07:02,624
<i>We gotta ditch this wetback.</i>

777
01:07:02,843 --> 01:07:05,418
<i>Hey. There are no wetbacks out here.
Just people.</i>

778
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:13,491
<i>-At least fire back.
-You know I don't use my gun.</i>

779
01:07:24,795 --> 01:07:27,632
-No.
-Just do it.

780
01:07:27,894 --> 01:07:30,251
Let me tell you something.

781
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:45,788
Do you think Justin's had sex?

782
01:07:46,006 --> 01:07:48,843
That's just the image
I want in my head right now.

783
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:52,682
Because we weren't much older
when we got married.

784
01:07:57,963 --> 01:08:00,320
How old do you feel?

785
01:08:08,438 --> 01:08:11,842
You have to tell me.
What's her pussy feel like?

786
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:15,377
-That's gross, Joel.
-You're such a prude.

787
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:19,523
-No. I care about her.
-I heard it's the softest thing ever.

788
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:25,720
-I French-kissed a girl once.
-Oh, yeah? What'd you do?

789
01:08:29,212 --> 01:08:32,135
-That's not French-kissing a girl.
-Yeah? Then what is it?

790
01:08:32,354 --> 01:08:34,231
A guy and a girl take their tongues...

791
01:08:34,449 --> 01:08:36,805
...and they put them inside
each other's mouths...

792
01:08:37,024 --> 01:08:39,075
...and they move them around
just like this.

793
01:08:48,284 --> 01:08:50,159
This thing bugs me.

794
01:08:50,378 --> 01:08:52,036
Justin.

795
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:54,917
No, seriously.

796
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,754
Why can't I see you?

797
01:08:58,015 --> 01:09:00,896
Because I told you,
those are the rules.

798
01:09:02,511 --> 01:09:04,649
But why do you get to make up
all the rules?

799
01:09:05,959 --> 01:09:09,537
Why don't you tell other people
that we're in a relationship?

800
01:09:10,977 --> 01:09:13,290
We're not in a relationship, Justin.

801
01:09:14,687 --> 01:09:16,345
Why not?

802
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:28,085
Rebecca...

803
01:09:29,613 --> 01:09:30,922
...I love you.

804
01:09:31,141 --> 01:09:33,846
God, you always have to make
everything so serious.

805
01:09:34,064 --> 01:09:37,424
This was just a teenage experiment,
that's all.

806
01:09:37,643 --> 01:09:39,650
An experiment?

807
01:09:41,571 --> 01:09:45,891
I needed to educate myself, Justin.

808
01:09:47,986 --> 01:09:49,645
So...

809
01:09:53,136 --> 01:09:57,064
...I decided to pick someone
like you.

810
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,813
Like me?

811
01:10:02,694 --> 01:10:05,443
Someone I'd never get hurt by.

812
01:10:08,673 --> 01:10:12,207
That's just so fucked up.

813
01:10:16,223 --> 01:10:18,274
Yeah, I'm sorry.

814
01:10:20,063 --> 01:10:23,555
I'm really, really sorry.

815
01:10:25,257 --> 01:10:27,701
But maybe you should just go.

816
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:32,545
Go, Justin.

817
01:11:08,594 --> 01:11:10,165
Hey.

818
01:11:10,732 --> 01:11:11,824
There you are.

819
01:11:12,042 --> 01:11:14,791
You're supposed to help me
clean the garage. Come on.

820
01:11:15,446 --> 01:11:17,061
Come here.

821
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:19,155
You missed dinner.

822
01:11:27,317 --> 01:11:29,586
Why you acting so strange?

823
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:35,173
She just pretends to like us.

824
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:40,148
-What are you talking about?
-She just wants to have fun.

825
01:11:40,366 --> 01:11:44,992
-You wanna be so serious.
-Oh, I make everything so serious?

826
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:49,618
She's not happy.

827
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,633
You know, fuck--

828
01:11:53,808 --> 01:11:55,466
I know.

829
01:11:57,298 --> 01:12:00,354
-Then why don't you do something?
-What can I do?

830
01:12:01,532 --> 01:12:05,330
The whole fucking world
expected me to go pro.

831
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,384
She doesn't care about that.

832
01:12:08,646 --> 01:12:12,617
Well, she'd never admit it,
but how could she have...?

833
01:12:13,272 --> 01:12:15,149
Not been disappointed.

834
01:12:15,367 --> 01:12:17,375
Everybody was.

835
01:12:18,553 --> 01:12:22,262
-You hurt your knee.
-Yeah, right.

836
01:12:24,008 --> 01:12:28,503
But what if it wasn't that bad, huh?
What if I could've kept on playing?

837
01:12:28,721 --> 01:12:31,514
What if your mother
was more important?

838
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,108
Pizza in the kitchen.

839
01:12:39,326 --> 01:12:41,378
Go have your dinner.

840
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,800
You know why she
got that job, right?

841
01:13:17,034 --> 01:13:18,561
What are you doing?

842
01:13:22,139 --> 01:13:24,802
I found a picture.

843
01:13:26,679 --> 01:13:28,817
A picture of that guy.

844
01:13:29,384 --> 01:13:31,479
Do you know about this?

845
01:13:39,117 --> 01:13:40,862
I'm sorry.

846
01:13:44,136 --> 01:13:50,813
You'd think she'd have better taste
than this Matt Schramm guy. Jesus.

847
01:13:55,919 --> 01:13:57,926
Dresses well.

848
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:02,596
Well, you know...

849
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,525
...it's all out there...

850
01:14:07,964 --> 01:14:10,190
...in picture land.

851
01:14:10,626 --> 01:14:13,944
You know, I can't reach that.

852
01:14:15,209 --> 01:14:17,216
I can't.

853
01:14:24,068 --> 01:14:28,083
The only way somebody like me
could ever get her attention...

854
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:30,790
...was by being her kid.

855
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:15,139
Stay away from the window, man.

856
01:16:17,059 --> 01:16:19,765
You're gonna get us busted
for curfew.

857
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:26,966
Can't even smoke in peace
around here, huh?

858
01:16:27,707 --> 01:16:30,632
Hey, a guy can only kick
one thing at a time, right?

859
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:32,465
Come on.

860
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:36,697
So, what, you in juvie?

861
01:16:37,963 --> 01:16:39,622
Yeah.

862
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:41,892
What's your poison?

863
01:16:43,026 --> 01:16:45,296
-Dope.
-What flavour?

864
01:16:45,514 --> 01:16:47,827
I don't know. Everything, I guess.

865
01:16:48,045 --> 01:16:51,972
Welcome to the fucking club.
Never met a drug I didn't like.

866
01:16:54,635 --> 01:16:56,206
Yeah, she's a tough one.

867
01:16:58,694 --> 01:17:01,967
In fact, I consider her
my guardian angel.

868
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:04,454
Are you friends?

869
01:17:06,986 --> 01:17:08,731
It's deeper than that.

870
01:17:08,906 --> 01:17:12,267
A month or so ago, I fly in here.
I work in TV.

871
01:17:12,484 --> 01:17:14,361
My studio commits me.

872
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:17,154
<i>Maybe you've seen my show.
The Line?</i>

873
01:17:18,507 --> 01:17:21,257
You know, sometimes
you gotta cross it.

874
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:22,828
I don't know.

875
01:17:23,483 --> 01:17:27,803
Anyway. So, naturally,
I smuggle in a stash, right?

876
01:17:28,021 --> 01:17:29,942
Tucked up my ass.

877
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:33,477
But it's too high up.
I can't get to it. So...

878
01:17:34,132 --> 01:17:36,183
...I take a spoon.

879
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,583
Something goes wrong.
There's blood everywhere.

880
01:17:38,802 --> 01:17:39,804
That's a lot of blood.

881
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:41,114
And there's Cobb there.

882
01:17:41,725 --> 01:17:43,209
<i>She runs into my room.</i>

883
01:17:43,428 --> 01:17:44,432
Okay.

884
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:49,188
<i>Sticks her hand in there.
No Vaseline, just my blood.</i>

885
01:17:49,407 --> 01:17:50,934
There it is. There it is.

886
01:17:55,211 --> 01:17:58,004
-That's heavy, right?
-That's sick.

887
01:17:58,266 --> 01:17:59,968
Yeah.

888
01:18:04,201 --> 01:18:06,427
<i>She saved my life, though.</i>

889
01:18:07,168 --> 01:18:10,398
And that was the moment
I finally got real about myself.

890
01:18:11,446 --> 01:18:12,974
I'm Matt.

891
01:18:13,191 --> 01:18:15,242
And I'm an addict.

892
01:18:17,817 --> 01:18:20,523
The other night she said to me,
"We're all addicted--"

893
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:23,491
--to something. Maybe an idea...

894
01:18:24,234 --> 01:18:27,812
...of ourselves or our lives.

895
01:18:27,986 --> 01:18:33,877
Maybe some idea of success
or failure.

896
01:18:34,096 --> 01:18:35,711
What, you're scared too?

897
01:18:36,802 --> 01:18:39,290
Being the mother of a 17-year-old
is a trip.

898
01:18:39,507 --> 01:18:41,821
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

899
01:18:42,781 --> 01:18:46,665
You're supposed to have all the
answers, and you don't have one.

900
01:18:48,847 --> 01:18:54,084
Even the idea that once you have a
family, you'll never be lonely again.

901
01:18:55,176 --> 01:18:56,791
Heavy, huh?

902
01:18:59,278 --> 01:19:02,071
We don't like to admit it...

903
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:04,777
...but we're all just...

904
01:19:05,737 --> 01:19:08,093
...scared little animals.

905
01:19:14,334 --> 01:19:16,255
Hey, it was good to share.

906
01:19:22,539 --> 01:19:25,550
-You okay?
-Yeah.

907
01:19:29,216 --> 01:19:30,308
That's patchouli.

908
01:19:32,577 --> 01:19:34,061
Cool.

909
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:37,290
So I'll leave you here.

910
01:19:37,771 --> 01:19:39,472
-You okay?
-Yeah.

911
01:19:41,218 --> 01:19:43,225
You sure? You okay?

912
01:19:43,444 --> 01:19:45,016
Yeah.

913
01:20:17,136 --> 01:20:18,882
What?

914
01:20:19,973 --> 01:20:21,719
Nothing.

915
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:24,163
Ass.

916
01:20:24,468 --> 01:20:26,345
Be quiet.

917
01:20:31,975 --> 01:20:33,197
Joel.

918
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:36,819
Yeah?

919
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:43,889
I always kind of thought
Audrey was gonna leave Mike.

920
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:47,119
They couldn't be apart.

921
01:20:49,126 --> 01:20:51,090
But is that love?

922
01:20:51,569 --> 01:20:53,360
I don't know.

923
01:20:53,839 --> 01:20:57,593
Well, don't you ever think about this
stuff? Doesn't it ever freak you out?

924
01:20:57,810 --> 01:21:00,212
Everything freaks you out.

925
01:21:01,651 --> 01:21:03,790
You don't even care.

926
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:06,583
You have it so easy, Joel.

927
01:21:07,674 --> 01:21:11,646
-I hate it when you say shit like that.
-Like what?

928
01:21:11,907 --> 01:21:13,828
Like you're the only one
with problems.

929
01:21:14,046 --> 01:21:16,403
You ever think
maybe you're so busy being weird...

930
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:18,672
...that I have to step up
and be normal?

931
01:21:19,588 --> 01:21:21,465
Everyone's worried about you.

932
01:21:21,684 --> 01:21:24,913
All the bullshit
you get yourself into.

933
01:21:26,396 --> 01:21:29,277
Why didn't you ever
just say anything?

934
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:37,831
I'm sorry.

935
01:21:49,615 --> 01:21:51,011
<i>Justin.</i>

936
01:21:51,186 --> 01:21:54,328
-Yeah?
-Can you come here a minute?

937
01:22:08,555 --> 01:22:10,650
-Oh, no way.
-What?

938
01:22:12,483 --> 01:22:14,403
I got in.

939
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,498
You applied?

940
01:22:23,176 --> 01:22:24,877
Yeah.

941
01:22:29,984 --> 01:22:32,689
Well, you didn't tell us
about this, huh?

942
01:22:34,086 --> 01:22:36,443
I thought you'd talk me out of it.

943
01:22:37,577 --> 01:22:40,370
Oh, honey, I wouldn't have
talked you out of it. I just....

944
01:22:40,633 --> 01:22:43,513
I thought your grades....

945
01:22:49,099 --> 01:22:50,889
I'm happy.

946
01:22:55,777 --> 01:22:57,392
Are you?

947
01:22:57,609 --> 01:23:00,926
Am I happy? You kidding?

948
01:23:08,302 --> 01:23:11,531
Well, what does it mean?

949
01:23:11,749 --> 01:23:14,019
It means I wanna go.

950
01:23:16,812 --> 01:23:18,296
Just like that?

951
01:23:18,514 --> 01:23:21,046
They want me to go
to their summer-school thing.

952
01:23:21,264 --> 01:23:26,938
They want me to make up some math
and language credits this summer.

953
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:43,696
I was just getting used to you.

954
01:23:57,443 --> 01:24:00,018
I gotta go deal with this shipment.

955
01:24:36,242 --> 01:24:39,035
You know I'm happy for you.

956
01:24:40,912 --> 01:24:44,577
I am. It's just....

957
01:24:46,454 --> 01:24:48,287
I don't know.

958
01:24:51,865 --> 01:24:55,357
If it was Belgium...

959
01:24:56,011 --> 01:24:59,022
...or Chile...

960
01:24:59,241 --> 01:25:01,248
...or Mars.

961
01:25:02,384 --> 01:25:05,613
Somewhere I couldn't picture you.

962
01:25:05,831 --> 01:25:08,275
You'd just vanish.

963
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:11,941
But New York...

964
01:25:12,508 --> 01:25:14,734
...I can see you.

965
01:25:16,567 --> 01:25:20,320
Justin in Central Park
by the fountain.

966
01:25:22,022 --> 01:25:24,903
Justin in a taxi on Fifth Avenue.

967
01:25:25,601 --> 01:25:29,223
Justin at Times Square.

968
01:25:29,441 --> 01:25:34,024
Justin eating a fucking hot dog
from a street vendor.

969
01:25:36,598 --> 01:25:38,824
You can always come to visit me.

970
01:25:41,138 --> 01:25:42,883
Yeah.

971
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:46,287
Yeah.

972
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:49,997
You're already gone.

973
01:25:51,132 --> 01:25:54,623
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

974
01:26:03,351 --> 01:26:05,839
I know you, Justin.

975
01:26:07,977 --> 01:26:11,382
I've been watching you
your whole life.

976
01:26:13,695 --> 01:26:14,917
You have?

977
01:26:44,681 --> 01:26:46,296
Justin.

978
01:26:46,515 --> 01:26:48,390
Perry.

979
01:26:49,045 --> 01:26:50,835
You found me.

980
01:26:51,271 --> 01:26:53,453
Yeah, in the phone book.

981
01:26:53,846 --> 01:26:56,857
To what do I deserve this honour?

982
01:26:57,206 --> 01:26:58,778
I'm leaving.

983
01:26:58,952 --> 01:27:02,400
-New York.
-Big city.

984
01:27:06,808 --> 01:27:10,081
-What happened?
-What do you mean?

985
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:13,965
This place,
it looks a little depressing.

986
01:27:14,576 --> 01:27:16,628
I don't know, I....

987
01:27:17,283 --> 01:27:20,294
I guess I stopped trying
to be anything.

988
01:27:20,511 --> 01:27:24,570
I accepted myself
and all my human disorder.

989
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,596
You might wanna do the same.

990
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:39,408
Remember when you were
like 13 or something, you were....

991
01:27:39,802 --> 01:27:43,206
You were always doing an impression
of a newsman.

992
01:27:43,423 --> 01:27:45,344
I did?

993
01:27:45,955 --> 01:27:47,963
You were quite good.

994
01:27:48,836 --> 01:27:51,411
-Sorry.
-No.

995
01:27:51,585 --> 01:27:53,811
If that's what you wanna do...

996
01:27:54,248 --> 01:27:57,084
...New York is the perfect place
for you.

997
01:27:58,175 --> 01:28:01,274
Make the contacts, knock on doors.

998
01:28:03,805 --> 01:28:06,380
Get the right haircut,
take voice lessons.

999
01:28:06,729 --> 01:28:08,649
Might work.

1000
01:28:09,522 --> 01:28:11,137
But then again...

1001
01:28:12,402 --> 01:28:14,978
...you'll have to deal
with a lot of fear.

1002
01:28:16,112 --> 01:28:18,294
I just came here for a check-up.

1003
01:28:19,865 --> 01:28:21,480
Really?

1004
01:28:26,194 --> 01:28:29,031
Justin, I'm sorry if I contributed
to feelings of shame...

1005
01:28:29,249 --> 01:28:31,605
...you may have had
about your thumb.

1006
01:28:33,002 --> 01:28:35,272
I've been reading up on it.

1007
01:28:35,577 --> 01:28:39,330
Medically, psychologically...

1008
01:28:39,592 --> 01:28:43,040
...there's nothing really
wrong with thumbsucking.

1009
01:28:43,302 --> 01:28:46,313
-I don't think I can agree with that.
-No, really.

1010
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:49,543
Look, Justin...

1011
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,248
...there was nothing wrong with you.

1012
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:55,784
It felt like everything
was wrong with me.

1013
01:28:57,878 --> 01:29:00,410
That's because we all
want to be problemless.

1014
01:29:00,845 --> 01:29:04,774
To fix ourselves. We look for some
magic solution to make us all better.

1015
01:29:04,992 --> 01:29:08,003
But none of us really know
what we're doing.

1016
01:29:08,527 --> 01:29:11,101
And why is that so bad?

1017
01:29:11,582 --> 01:29:14,113
That's all we humans can do.

1018
01:29:14,768 --> 01:29:16,033
Guess.

1019
01:29:16,252 --> 01:29:17,823
Try.

1020
01:29:18,041 --> 01:29:19,917
Hope.

1021
01:29:23,147 --> 01:29:25,547
Justin, I just pray
you don't fool yourself...

1022
01:29:25,722 --> 01:29:28,297
...into thinking
you've got the answer.

1023
01:29:30,959 --> 01:29:33,184
Because that's bullshit.

1024
01:29:34,712 --> 01:29:36,764
The trick...

1025
01:29:37,243 --> 01:29:39,818
...is living without an answer.

1026
01:29:43,790 --> 01:29:45,710
I think.

1027
01:29:52,693 --> 01:29:54,002
I think.

1028
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:49,646
There is new evidence indicating
that the North Koreans have....

1029
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:44,418
Hi.

1030
01:31:45,857 --> 01:31:47,648
Hi.

1031
01:31:49,044 --> 01:31:50,527
I'm Justin.

1032
01:31:50,964 --> 01:31:52,448
Hi.

1033
01:31:53,448 --> 01:32:03,448
