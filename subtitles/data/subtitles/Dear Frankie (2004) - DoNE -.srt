<i>Dear Da, did you know something?</i>

2
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,478
<i>We're moving again.</i>

3
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,431
<i>Ma says it's time.</i>

4
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,193
<i>She says it's definitely the last time.</i>

5
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,840
<i>But she says that every single time.</i>

6
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,989
<i>Nana says,</i>

7
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,638
<i>if there is a next time,</i>

8
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,676
<i>she'll have to be carried out in a box.</i>

9
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,716
<i>And Ma says, don't tempt her.</i>

10
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,711
# Everyone Will Have Their Day

11
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,268
# And if tomorrow only brings
our just deserts

12
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,791
# We'll still get through

13
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,433
# I know we'll be all right

14
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,396
# Cue the marching drums

15
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,040
# We'll stumble through tonight

16
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,270
# Until the morning comes

17
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,989
# And everyone will have their day

18
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,679
# Though many trying days might break

19
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,234
# Take time before you make a change

20
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,835
# Your time is gonna come your way...

21
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,990
<i>And did you know
something else, Da?</i>

22
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,356
<i>This time... This time,
we're living right on the edge of the sea.</i>

23
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,237
<i>Right on the edge of the world.</i>

24
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,871
<i>Lizzie, I still cannae get it.</i>

25
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,599
Gonnae miss my programme.

26
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,990
<i>You'll need to do something.
You'll need to get the man in.</i>

27
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,308
Away to the chip shop
and get us a couple of fish suppers.

28
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,831
You want to encourage that boy to speak more.

29
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,952
There's nothing wrong with his voice.
He's got a lovely wee voice.

30
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,792
You should encourage it more.

31
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,438
Between that and that other thing...

32
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,196
<i>- Is that it?
- Yeah.</i>

33
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,793
One, two, three, four...

34
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,950
<i>Oh Marie!
Come on, give us a break!</i>

35
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,917
Oh, keep your hair on! It's a joke.

36
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,074
Right, you two, beat it.

37
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,550
And don't annoy me for the rest of the week,
OK?

38
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,192
<i>Right, who's next?</i>

39
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,315
OK.

40
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,749
Right.

41
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,277
Your wish is my command.

42
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,559
Just on the one?

43
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,598
Aye, no bother.

44
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,988
Right.

45
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,829
OK, is that it?

46
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,598
How old are you?

47
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,832
Yeah, well, come back in six and a half years.

48
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,559
Just you go back down there
and tell Madam Muck

49
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,949
<i>that you want a packet of Embassy Regal.</i>

50
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,190
<i>And if she gives you any more of her lip,</i>

51
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,556
tell her I'll come down
and batter more than her fish.

52
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,399
Are you that desperate?

53
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,670
And that was that. Know what I mean?

54
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,830
Excuse me. 20 Embassy Regal.

55
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,751
Er... there's a queue.

56
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,389
My boy's already queued.
And before you ask, I am 16, so...

57
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,392
Yeah, and the rest.
OK, hold your horses. I'll do you next.

58
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,710
<i>Come on there's a queue!
- Oh, God almighty!</i>

59
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,075
She only wants a packet of fags!

60
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,079
What was the problem, anyway?
Could you not understand him?

61
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,709
I understood him perfectly.
He's a smart wee cookie.

62
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,915
For a deaf kid?

63
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,589
For his age.

64
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,238
Thanks.

65
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,635
<i>Dear Da, thanks for the stamps.</i>

66
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,316
<i>The Great White Shark's the best.</i>

67
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,191
<i>Maybe the best you've ever sent.</i>

68
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,909
<i>Ma says she'll buy me a new album
when this one's full.</i>

69
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,471
You left while I was sleeping,

70
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,233
Taken from my loving arm,

71
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,357
And now I'm left to grieve here,
broken like a doll.

72
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,035
Jesus Christ, that doesn't even rhyme.

73
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,997
They're supposed to rhyme.

74
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,150
Just you make sure mine rhymes.

75
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,071
Oh, don't bother. I'll write it myself.

76
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,118
It's wishful thinking, you know.
You won't find his name in there.

77
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,077
Well, he's got to die sometime.

78
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,188
<i>Did you know something, Da?</i>

79
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,317
<i>Did you know a Great White
can jump right out of the water</i>

80
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,913
<i>and knock over a boat?</i>

81
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,873
<i>Not your boat, though. Your boat's ginormous.</i>

82
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,639
<i>And guess what else, Da? Guess what?</i>

83
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,029
<i>From my window, I can see the sea.</i>

84
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,753
You have to wear it.

85
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,191
Did you do the toilet?

86
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,193
It's a big day tomorrow.
You'll need to get to sleep now.

87
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,750
- Miss?
- Yes?

88
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,195
What does it feel like to be deaf?

89
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,876
Brilliant. You wouldnae be able to hear your ma
shouting at you to do stuff all the time.

90
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,992
Miss, is it like when your ears are all blocked,
and everything feels like it's miles away?

91
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,548
Well, that's certainly one way to think about it.

92
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,475
But just remember,
you don't have to shout at him all the time.

93
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,709
Do you hear me, Ricky?

94
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,677
Sorry, Miss, did you say something?

95
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,196
<i>I don't want him treated any different.</i>

96
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,990
Well, let's give it a couple of weeks.
If he's struggling, we'll let you know.

97
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,799
He won't struggle.
There's nothing wrong with his brain.

98
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,552
Is there, Frankie?

99
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,675
A word to the wise.
Watch what you say in front of him.

100
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,637
He's a champion lip-reader.

101
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,990
<i>Dr Knickerbocker,
Knickerbocker, number nine</i>

<i># Clap your hands and keep in time</i>

103

104

# Now we've got the rhythm...

109
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,799
Hey, Bean, stick your finger in there and wag it.

110
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,757
Go on, stick it in.

111
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,637
Is that how your girlfriend feels?

112
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,677
<i>We do geography at school, Da.</i>

113
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,637
<i>It's my favourite subject.</i>

114
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,235
<i>I know every single country in the whole world.</i>

115
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,393
<i>Miss Mackenzie gave me
two gold stars for my homework.</i>

116
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,515
Well done!

117
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,398
<i>I've made a friend.</i>

118
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,232
<i>His name's Ricky Monroe.</i>

119
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,550
<i>And he's rubbish at geography.</i>

120
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,315
- Morrison 2642.
- Take a seat.

121
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,359
Thanks.

122
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,797
I wondered when you'd show up.

123
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,598
I've kept you something.

124
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,437
Isn't she a beauty?

125
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,515
Mmm.

126
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,790
<i>Dear Frankie,
here's another stamp for your collection.</i>

127
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,878
<i>This one's a real beauty. The Queen Mary.</i>

128
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,155
<i>They don't build them like that any more.</i>

129
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,956
<i>When I was your age,
I lived so close to the sea I could taste it.</i>

130
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,918
<i>The sharp, salty taste on the inside of my mouth.</i>

131
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,559
<i>And I can taste it now.</i>

132
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,756
<i>That same sharp saltiness.</i>

133
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,717
<i>Up here on the deck.</i>

134
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,715
<i>So we're sailing down towards the Cape now.</i>

135
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,349
<i>The sky here is the most beautiful
shade of blue I've ever seen.</i>

136
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,159
<i>It's like the stone in your Ma's engagement ring.</i>

137
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,437
<i>Ask her to show you it,
then you'll know exactly what I mean.</i>

138
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,839
Oh, you got it, then?

139
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,036
I always get it when I go, you know that.

140
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,350
I didnae know you were still going to go.

141
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,351
<i>Now that we're here.</i>

142
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,910
I thought you might have stopped all that.

143
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,513
No.

144
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,716
I've no plans to stop any of it.

145
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,551
Yes, can I help you?

146
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,993
Hello?

147
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,877
Hello! I'm talking to you.

148
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,029
Er...

149
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,518
Could you come back here, please?

150
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,955
Excuse me, I'm talking to you!

151
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,473
Excuse me.

152
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,437
Cheeky wee devil, you.

153
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,875
Look, son, I did not come up the Clyde
in a paper boat.

154
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,996
I am well aware that a wee boy your age

155
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,958
should be at school doing sums
at this time of the day.

156
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,553
There's no flies on me, so come on.

157
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,155
Let's have a look at the note
from your teacher, shall we?

158
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,152
Oh, I didn't realise.

159
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,229
I'm...

160
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,753
I'm... so... sorry.

161
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,068
I didn't know you were...

162
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,479
...deaf.

163
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,396
Oh, never you mind, son.

164
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,391
<i>You... You pick a book.</i>

165
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,232
<i>Pick any book.</i>

166
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,231
And if we don't have it here,

167
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,232
then I will move mountains to get it for you.

168
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,036
Any cards up there for a locksmith?

169
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,429
I'd forget my head if it wasn't screwed on.

170
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,749
Ah...

171
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,399
Got them.

172
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,076
Is this Frankie Morrison's house?

173
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,834
You're weird.

174
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,956
A-C-C-R-A.

175
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,115
What's that supposed to mean?

176
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,316
It's the name of his dad's boat.

177
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,558
And it's the capital of Ghana.

178
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,196
Don't tell me, you must be Ricky Monroe?

179
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,152
- Ricky...
- What?

180
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,832
Get your feet off the bed.

181
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,591
Thanks, but no thanks.

182
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,716
The advert won't go in the paper till Friday.

183
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,758
I'm grateful for the offer,
but we might not be here that long.

184
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,671
That's what I said when I first came.

185
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,477
It's only a part-time job.
I'm not asking you to sign your life away.

186
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,033
OK, just think about it.

187
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,793
<i>She doesn't need to think about it.
She'll take it.</i>

188
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,553
<i>Just tell her what time you want her to start.</i>

189
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,992
OK, then.

190
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,831
<i>We crossed the equator a week ago, Frankie.</i>

191
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,831
<i>Be docking in the Cape soon.</i>

192
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,870
<i>And it's really hot on board now.</i>

193
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,509
<i>It's so hot on deck,
you burn your hands on the rail.</i>

194
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,916
<i>Well, I'd better go now, Frankie.</i>

195
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,991
<i>It's my turn on watch.</i>

196
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,270
<i>Now, mind and stick in at school
and be a good boy for your mammy.</i>

197
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,959
<i>Love from your daddy.</i>

198
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,390
Hey, Frankie boy, bet you're dead excited
about seeing your da?

199
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,471
Why don't you just lay down and die?

200
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,913
Ignore him, Frankie.

201
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,753
Bet you didn't even know his boat was coming!

202
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,989
Of course he knew, stupid.

203
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,868
And you don't need to shout.
He can see what you're saying... unfortunately.

204
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,952
I bet you all my trump cards
your da doesn't come.

205
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,508
If he comes, I'll give you the lot.

206
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,828
If he doesnae come,

207
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,755
you have to give me every single one of
your stamps and your knife, to keep for ever.

208
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,229
No, Frankie, don't. Don't do it.

209
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,314
<i>Dear Da, sorry I haven't written for a few days.</i>

210
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,391
<i>Things have been very busy here.</i>

211
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,995
<i>I suppose you've been busy too,</i>

212
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,197
<i>now that you've had to change course
and sail back north.</i>

213
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,230
<i>Ricky Monroe told me.</i>

214
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,436
<i>Trust him to put his big feet right in it.</i>

215
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,155
<i>I've told him hundreds and hundreds of times</i>

216
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,674
<i>you might not even get shore leave.</i>

217
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,833
<i>But he doesn't know about these things
He's not very clever. And he's a liar.</i>

218
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,469
<i>He said you wouldn't want to come
and see us, even if you could.</i>

219
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,949
<i>So, guess what, Da? I've made a bet.</i>

220
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,429
<i>I bet Ricky Monroe you were coming.</i>

221
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,910
<i>Then I said I'd bring you
to the football trials to prove it.</i>

222
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,030
Hey, slowcoach, I'm waiting on those chips.

223
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,076
OK, hold your horses, I'm doing them.

224
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,195
Everything all right?

225
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,635
Yeah, everything's fine. Absolutely fine.

226
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,279
I need the money for the milk.

227
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,794
We owe three weeks
and he'll be here first thing.

228
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,440
My purse is on the table,
and don't do that again.

229
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,715
- Don't do what?
- Come in here without knocking.

230
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,279
I thought you were Frankie.

231
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,555
So? You shouldnae have anything to hide.

232
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,319
Shut the door.

233
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,396
I've got something I need to show you.

234
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,910
I knew something like this would happen.
I told you, didn't I?

235
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,157
What are we going to do?

236
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,355
Move?

237
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,830
Lizzie, darling, listen, you cannae keep running.

238
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,309
You've got to face this sometime.

239
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,710
Tell Frankie the truth. He should know, Lizzie.

240
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,711
<i>He should know what his daddy was.</i>

241
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,471
Then maybe he'd stop wishing for him.

242
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,278
Have you forgotten what it was like?

243
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,592
No, I haven't forgotten. But it's over now.
It's over and done with. Davey's dead.

244
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,908
Davey's not dead.

245
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,230
I check that paper every week.
I know he's not dead.

246
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,596
<i>He could walk in through that door
any minute now and take what's his.</i>

247
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,789
No, he won't walk in.

248
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,950
- How do you know that?
- I just know it.

249
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,428
Lizzie, darling, you're my daughter
and I love you, but you're wrong.

250
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,149
You've stopped living your life.
You're the one that's dead.

251
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,792
That's not what Frankie needs.

252
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,394
He doesnae need lies in a letter.

253
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,516
He needs flesh and blood.

254
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,679
<i>- Where are you going?
- For cigarettes.</i>

255
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,595
<i>Hello?</i>

256
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,238
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

257
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,469
Go away.

258
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,749
Just go away and leave us alone.

259
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,915
For God's sake, just leave us alone.

260
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,199
Do you believe in mermaids?

261
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,079
I do. I think the sea's full of them.

262
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,951
I saw one once, over at Meagle Point.

263
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,719
There. What do you think?
Do I look like a mermaid?

264
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,717
Frankie, why don't you ask your mammy?

265
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,756
Ask her if your daddy's going to come.

266
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,195
I know. You want to know,
but you don't want to know.

267
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,838
Tricky.

268
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,833
You know what I would do,
if I was in your situation?

269
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,229
I'd look in my mammy's wardrobe.

270
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,437
Whenever there's something
my mammy doesn't want me to see,

271
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,556
she hides it in the back of her wardrobe.

272
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,596
I've found hundreds of things in there.

273
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,591
Condoms...

274
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,590
...dirty videos, cheap cigarettes.

275
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,757
See, I bet your daddy's written
to your mammy and told her he's coming,

276
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,718
but not to tell you because it's a surprise.

277
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,877
Girls love secrets, Frankie.

278
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,916
It'll be in the back of her wardrobe.

279
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,514
Trust me. I know these things.

280
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,639
Wardrobe.

281
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,192
The key's here somewhere.

282
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,153
Aw!

283
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,348
Perfect.

284
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,189
Look, Frankie, a bride's dress.

285
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,710
What are you doing with that?

286
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,711
<i>That's mine. Put it down.</i>

287
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,351
What else did you touch?

288
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,952
What else?

289
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,872
What else did you touch?

290
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,958
Never go near my things again,
do you hear me?

291
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,712
<i>They're mine.</i>

292
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,551
They're nothing to do with you. Nothing.

293
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,878
I'm entitled to some privacy.

294
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,110
I'm allowed one thing of my own. Just one.

295
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,714
One single thing that's mine.

296
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,676
I'm here, Frankie.

297
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,437
I'm the one that's here.

298
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,431
I'm the one that's still here!

299
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,637
Are you still in a huff with me?

300
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,433
I wish you wouldn't sit there. You'll get a chill.

301
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,509
Suit yourself.

302
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,914
I need to tell you something important.

303
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,110
Of course he wants to see you.

304
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,758
He might not want to see me,
but he'll always want to see you.

305
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,439
You're his boy.

306
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,754
Maybe he just can't, Frankie.

307
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,357
It's been a long time.

308
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,397
Like yourself.

309
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,515
You look like yourself.

310
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,278
Heard from your dad yet, Frankie boy?

311
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,552
Hold on! I wasnae finished with that.

312
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,278
Well, hurry up. I haven't got all night.

313
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,030
Come on, Frankie, you too. Eat.

314
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,758
Where's the bloody fire?

315
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,831
I'm going out, that's all.

316
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,439
If the wind changes, your faces'll stay like that.

317
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,508
Bacardi and Coke, please.

318
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,996
<i>I hope you're not working, sweetheart.</i>

319
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,991
We don't do deals in here.

320
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,877
No. On your bike.

321
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,237
# Spiegel Im Spiegel

322
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,354
I suppose you're dying to know
what I was doing.

323
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,796
Well, I'd be a liar if I said I wasn't, but...

324
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,676
...that doesn't mean you have to tell me.

325
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,793
I was looking for a man.

326
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,318
<i>A stranger.</i>

327
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,789
No past, no present...

328
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,517
...no future.

329
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,237
I was looking for a man to be Frankie's dad.

330
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,236
Just for a day, one single day,
and I was going to pay him to do it.

331
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,831
Where the hell have you been?

332
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,911
I've been worried sick.

333
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,831
I've been at Marie's.

334
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,511
Everything's all right now.

335
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,834
<i>Pass to me!</i>

336
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,559
<i>Dear Da, in case you're interested,</i>

337
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,712
<i>the football trials are on Saturday
at Boundary Park.</i>

338
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,319
<i>10:30.</i>

339
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,516
<i>Mr Fraser said I could get
into the reserves if I want.</i>

340
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,353
<i>But I don't. I'm rubbish at football.</i>

341
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,799
<i>Who cares about a stupid bet anyway?</i>

342
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,833
Yes!

343
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,275
Another goal by the master!

344
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,430
<i>I know
you're only three whole days away,</i>

345
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,875
<i>so you might not even get this letter.</i>

346
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,716
<i>If you can't come and see me,
that's all right, I understand.</i>

347
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,315
<i>Ma says it's been a long time
and you've probably changed.</i>

348
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,789
<i>I have, that's for sure.</i>

349
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,553
<i>I'm now four foot eight inches tall,</i>

350
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,393
<i>and I have brownish hair, just like Ma's.</i>

351
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,637
<i>Do you know something funny, Da?</i>

352
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,597
<i>I think Ma knew you'd be coming.</i>

353
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,352
<i>That's why she brought us here.</i>

354
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,556
<i>I think she wanted you to find us.</i>

355
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,037
Lizzie Morrison?

356
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,350
Yeah.

357
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,631
An Americano. Strong.

358
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,830
- Just water.
- Sparkling or still?

359
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,750
Tap.

360
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,355
Don't get service like this at Marie's.

361
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,591
Marie didn't tell me much about you.

362
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,353
No past, present or future.
That's what you said you wanted.

363
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,272
Frankie's letters to his dad.

364
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,635
He's been writing them for a few years now.

365
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,153
He's a lovely wee writer.

366
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,117
Well, you'll see that for yourself.

367
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,514
He sends them to a post office box
here in Glasgow,

368
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,114
and I collect them twice a month
and then I write back.

369
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,870
Um, this is one of mine.

370
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,634
That's a Scottish postmark.

371
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,154
Yeah, I've told him there's a central mail depot,

372
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,754
and that all the letters from the ship go there.

373
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,114
He doesnae question it.

374
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,917
I make it all up. I've been making it up for years.

375
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,831
I made up the boat.

376
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,512
I saw the name on a stamp.

377
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,239
How was I to know
the bloody boat actually existed?

378
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,429
That's Frankie,

379
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,478
a couple of months before his dad left.

380
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,590
And this is him now.

381
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,273
Frankie's deaf, but he's a champion lip-reader.

382
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,397
How old is he?

383
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,469
Nine.

384
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,629
And a half.

385
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,437
Does he remember what his dad looks like?

386
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,795
I don't remember what he looks like.
It's been a while.

387
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,712
Does Frankie have any photographs
of his dad?

388
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,518
No.

389
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,589
You sure?

390
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,591
Yes, I'm sure.

391
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,112
Marie says you're only here for a week.

392
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,349
I sail next Monday.

393
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,709
Good, that's good. That fits in just right.

394
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,789
Um...

395
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,270
That must be some life,
seeing all those different places.

396
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,998
You should know.

397
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,469
You've been writing from them for years.

398
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,597
You must think I'm completely mad,
asking a total stranger to do this.

399
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,235
I don't know who the hell you are, but...

400
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,398
...I'm asking you if you'll do it.

401
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,077
I don't have much, but I'll pay you what I can.

402
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,517
What time do you want me to be there?

403
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,037
One day to go, Frankie boy.

404
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,755
<i># The midges, I'm no gonna kid yous</i>

405
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,434
# The midges is really the limit

406
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,193

00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,635

# Simmit

410
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,748
Hey, come on, you sing one now.

411
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,796
Oh, God, no, I can't sing.

412
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,949
<i>Oh, go on.</i>

413
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,917
# Da dum da-da dum...

414
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,393
Come on, you know it better than me.

415
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,438
# When I was a young girl

416
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,990
# I used to dream of a lover

00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,517
<i># Who'd be my shining knight

418
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:20,311
# He'd carry me to a castle in the heavens

419
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,032
<i># And he'd battle all my dragons far away</i>

420
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,633
<i># And he'd ride down</i>

421
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,188
# On a great white horse

422
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,640

00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,833
# And he'd bring me joy

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,390
<i># And lasting peace</i>

426
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,835
<i># And on a great white horse</i>

427
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,949
<i># He'd ride away with me</i>

428
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,875
Lizzie. For God's sake,
will you stop still for a minute and listen?

429
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,474
I can't, I've got to find him.
God knows where he is.

430
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,437
Well, I'll go. I'll find him.

431
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,397
He's due at ten, isn't he?

432
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,118
- The man?
- Yeah.

433
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,839
- Well, you'd better stay here in case.
- In case of what?

434
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,239
Just in case.

435
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,595
I'll find him. I promise.

436
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,952
I look at you sometimes and I swear
I don't know where you came from.

437
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,958
And this man?

438
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,796
<i>- Who is this man that's coming?
- I told you. He's a friend of Marie's.</i>

439
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,393
Oh, that's a comfort!

440
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,555
Jesus, Lizzie, we don't know anything
about this man.

441
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,111
He could be a...

442
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,270
<i>We don't know anything about him.</i>

443
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,430
We don't need to know anything.

444
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,710
- This is the end of it.
- Promise?

445
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,594
That's him.

446
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,757
Hey, Frankie.

447
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,557
Your mammy is worried about you.

448
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,791
It's good up here, isn't it?

449
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,795
This is my favourite place in the whole world.

450
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,472
See, when you come around the coner,

451
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,154
and the cranes appear out of nowhere...

452
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,754
<i>With the hills behind them</i>

453
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,355
<i>and the water dancing round them.</i>

454
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,311
Takes my breath away.

455
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,757
Every single time.

456
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,231
Right, if he's not back in five minutes,
I'm going to the docks myself.

457
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,471
How do you even know that's where he is?

458
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,039
Where would you go if it was you?

459
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,758
He won't go on that ship.

460
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,957
How do you know what he would do?
You've not even met him.

461
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,951
He doesn't want to spoil the surprise.

462
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,114
If I was a betting man,

463
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,071
which I'm not,

464
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,832
I'd put money on it.

465
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,118
Mother, do something useful
and put the kettle on.

466
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,590
Would you like a cup of tea?

467
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,116
- I'm sorry, I don't know your name.
- Jesus God!

468
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,871
What's Frankie's dad called?

469
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,269
Depends who's calling him.

470
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,193
Davey.

471
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,191
Call me Davey, then.

472
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,072
Don't ruin this for him, please.
Let him have this one day.

473
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,588
Have you got that money?

474
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,557
Oh, yeah, um...

475
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,397
That's half now, half later.

476
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,432
<i>Look, there's no harm done.</i>

477
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,033
<i>He knows he shouldn't have done it.</i>

478
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,155
So, um... everything all right?

479
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,310
<i>- Yeah.
- Good</i>

480
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,958
Right, I'd better go.

481
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,600
Hey, come in for chips after the football, OK?

482
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,550
Marie...

483
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,153
Thanks for bringing him.

484
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,468
Right.

485
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,794
<i>No, leave that, Frankie. Do it later.</i>

486
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,876
<i>I want you to come in here for a minute.</i>

487
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,717
You've got a visitor, Frankie.

488
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,634
This is your daddy.

489
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,358
Hello, Frankie.

490
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,958
You've got big.

491
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,074
I didn't tell you I was coming because...

492
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,037
<i>I wasn't sure if I'd be here in time.</i>

493
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,680
<i>I hoped I would, but I wasn't sure.</i>

494
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,471
I've got something for you.

495
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,598
Frankie wasnae looking for anything.
You didn't need to do that.

496
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,557
I know I didn't need to.

497
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,632
That's for you.

498
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,592
He wants to know how you knew.

499
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,477
I read it.

500
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,074
You... You'll have to look at him.

501
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,234
<i>Sorry</i>

502
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,550
I read it in your letters.

503
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,750
You'll have to get a move on, you'll be late.

504
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,074
Come on, slowcoach. Get your things together.

505
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,115
Here.

506
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,477
You'll want to remember the look
on Ricky Monroe's face.

507
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,430
<i>Come on, now, boys, that's good.</i>

508
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,636
<i>Keep moving</i>

509
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,039
<i>Well done.</i>

510
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,399
Come on.

511
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,349
<i>- What are you doing, you bloody idiot?
- What?</i>

512
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,035
- You gave me a crap pass.
- I didn't mean to. I slipped.

513
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,597
Well, a bet's a bet.

514
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,557
You won it fair and square.

515
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,435
Do you want to bring him for chips?

516
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,918
No? Another time maybe?

517
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,113
Come on, Frankie.

518
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,476
This is half an hour of my life
I am never going to get back.

519
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,516
Just have what you always have.

520
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,953
Chips.

521
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,031
<i>Me too.</i>

522
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,997
Can I have some fish with mine?

523
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,110
Er... Frankie is a vegetarian.

524
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,398
He's a vegetarian
that doesnae eat his vegetables.

525
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,599
Roll and butter?

526
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,032
Can I change my mind?

527
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,835
Sure.

528
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,115
No fish for me.

529
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,998
Right, is that it?

530
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,912
I know, Frankie.

531
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,552
Good? Yeah? Yeah?

532
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,112
It's going well.

533
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,799
Is it?

534
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,155
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

535
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,117
I thought this is what you wanted.

536
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,357
Yeah, it is.

537
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,268
He's not going to take him away from you,
Lizzie.

538
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,479
Nobody could do that.

539
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,999
Where are they going now?

540
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,558
He wouldn't take him to the ship?

541
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,190
Lizzie, wait! Wait.

542
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,952
Lizzie!

543
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,789
Big, isn't she?

544
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,317
More than a match for any shark.

545
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,829
Want to go on?

546
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,597
It's up to you, Frankie.

547
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,793
Take a picture, then.

548
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,915
For later.

549
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,991
# Delicate

550
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,237
# We might kiss

551
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,997
# When we are alone

552
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,471
# When nobody's watching...

553
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,632
Too bumpy. Flat, so it skims.

554
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,398
# We might make out

555
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,635
# When nobody's there

556
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,157
# It's not that we're scared...

557
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,712
This is good, Frankie.

558
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,039
Frankie...

559
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:37,511
# So why do you fill my sorrow?

560
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,835
That is a champion skimmer.

561
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:51,549
# From the only place that you've known

562
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:01,436
# And why do you sing hallelujah

563
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,958
# If it means nothing to ya?

564
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,999
# Why do you sing...

565
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,798
Want to go for a race?

566
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:16,193
# With me at all?

567
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,797
# Why did you fill my sorrow

568
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:30,718
# With the words you've borrowed?

569
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:39,119
# Why do you sing with me at all?

570
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,953
You OK?

571
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,114
I've had an idea.

572
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,193
Oh!

573
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,990
- Have you not got a watch?
- Sorry. The time just flew.

574
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,917
Now, Frankie, say goodbye.

575
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,439
He's tired.

576
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,431
It's been a long day.

577
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,557
Aye, you can say that again.
Well, it's over now.

578
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,552
So, we'll just say cheerio,
and thanks very much.

579
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,317
Go on, Frankie, say cheerio.

580
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,995
Come on. It's late.

581
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,676
I think he wants to ask you something.

582
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,671
What do you think he wants to ask me?

583
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,110
I don't go back to my ship till Monday.

584
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,315
So?

585
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,075
So, I thought it might be nice to...
spend some more time with Frankie.

586
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,399
Did you, now?

587
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:48,479
Well, Frankie and you.
You know, the three of us.

588
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,716
No.

589
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,869
No!

590
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,029
Now see what you've done.

591
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,877
Mother, take Frankie inside now.

592
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,758
We had an arrangement. You broke it.

593
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,910
One more day. That's all.

594
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,831
No, no, no, I want you to go now.

595
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,797
It's over. Do you hear me? It's over.

596
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,916
My ship sails in one day.

597
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,319
There is only one more day.

598
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,277
Who the hell do you think you are?

599
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:34,710
Who gave you the right
to come in here and behave like this?

600
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,318
You did.

601
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,429
He's waited all this time.

602
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,432
<i>You've waited all this time.</i>

603
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,838
One o'clock, here.

604
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,638
One o'clock down at the quay.

605
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:08,077
- Right, that's it. Come on.
- I've got business down at the quay.

606
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,032
Be easier if you could meet me there.
Trust me.

607
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,718
You have to trust somebody someday.

608
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,877
One o'clock at the quay.

609
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,639
Come on, son.

610
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,597
You'll see him again tomorrow.

611
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,353
Did your daddy give you that?

612
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,232
It's a beauty.

613
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,319
That should really fly.

614
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,913
<i>Is Frankie sleeping?</i>

615
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,560
I doubt it. He's wound up like a spring.

616
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,637
Do you fancy a wee whisky, Ma?

617
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,438
Why? What are we celebrating?

618
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,910
We're not celebrating anything.
I just need one, that's all.

619
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,198
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

620
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,552
<i>Here. Give me that.</i>

621
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,352
Bette Davis used to have blood-red nails.

622
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,317
- Did she?
- Mm.

623
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,630
That's what your daddy used to call you.

624
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:59,035
You'd be all dressed up
in my best frock and high heels.

625
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,680
Talking away to yourself.

626
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,591
Away in your own wee world.

627
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,233
And he'd say,

628
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:10,472
"Jesus Christ, Nell!
Who the hell does that lassie think she is?

629
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,879
Bette Davis?"

630
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,037
I never really liked Bette Davis.

631
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,393
Preferred Barbara Stanwyck.

632
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,237
You knew where you were
with Barbara Stanwyck.

633
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,349
Ma...

634
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,476
What is it?

635
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,238
My brush. Have you seen my brush?

636
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,197
- In your bag.
- Oh, aye.

637
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,992
Oh, I forgot to give you this.
It's been in my bag for ages.

638
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:00,349
You know something? I don't think
I'll bother getting this paper any more.

639
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,715
Never anything in it.

640
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,193
Let me see it.

641
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,993
Aye. Aye, you can come right over.

642
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,957
Come round later.

643
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,871
Maybe we can get a video or something.

644
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,799
Janet wants to meet me.

645
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,995
Is he dead?

646
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,513
He's very ill, apparently.

647
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,669
It's a trap.

648
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,591
He wants to see Frankie.

649
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,194
We can leave. Go tonight.

650
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,840
You don't owe him anything.

651
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:12,754
I know I shouldn't ask,
but he's my brother, Lizzie.

652
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,114
He's my brother.

653
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,316
He's a sorry sight, Lizzie.

654
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,153
He's not the man he was. That's a dead cert.

655
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,753
If you could only just see him.

656
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,637
No.

657
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,109
Please. Put the past behind you,
for Frankie's sake.

658
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,397
- Leave Frankie out of it.
- He's dying, Lizzie.

659
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,997
How long has he got?

660
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,637
They don't know. It just depends
how much fight there is in him.

661
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,153
He always had plenty of that.

662
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,276
What good does that do now?

663
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,271
I don't have to justify myself to you.

664
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,315
<i>Or him.</i>

665
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,470
I don't blame you. I've never blamed you.

666
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,790
<i>He's my brother. I know exactly what he is.</i>

667
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,751
But you know what they say.

668
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,353
No, Janet, what do they say?

669
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,351
They say blood's thicker than water, Lizzie,

670
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,079
and, like it or not,
he's Frankie's flesh and blood.

671
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,669
- I'll see him on my own.
- He wants to see Frankie.

672
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,797
For God's sake, he might not last. Please.

673
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,711
I'm begging you. Show some pity.

674
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,270
I'll see him on my own,
and then I'll decide if I let him near my son.

675
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,670
That's it, Janet. Take it or leave it.

676
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,390
Ready?

677
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,758
Cheers, pal.

678
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,353
Here.

679
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,390
Right, you choose.

680
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,994
Where do you want to go?

681
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,637
# The Secret Sun

682
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,599
# Meet me by the sea again

683
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:32,158
# Past the point where the shoreline bends

684
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,115
# Where the sand is soft and warm

685
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:43,400
# And hangs upon your golden arm

686
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:51,912
# And time won't move at all

687
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,868
# We were once the only ones

688
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,075
# Who knew of the secret sun

689
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,999
# Shining down where no-one goes

690
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:17,389
# In a place that no-one knows...

691
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,318
I think this must be yours, sir.

692
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,869
Stupid me. It's for you, isn't it?

693
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,159
Your dad thought
all his birthdays had come at once.

694
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,118
Could you bring another spoon,

695
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,077
just in case he cannae finish it?

696
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,478
Hold it flat, Frankie!

697
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,679
<i>He cannae hear you.</i>

698
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,677
Sorry.

699
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,273
I forgot.

700
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,399
# But back there in the orange light

701
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:16,956
# There will be no fear of the night

702
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:26,832
# And time won't move at all

703
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:34,673
# And time won't move

704
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:41,549
# At all

705
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,152
<i>Hi, Frankie!</i>

706
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,229
You well?

707
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,197
Oh, no, thanks!

708
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,989
Hello.

709
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,195
Hiya.

710
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,192
- You look nice.
- So do you.

711
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,352
Oh, this is Ally, er... my partner.

712
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,589
In crime.

713
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,630
Hi.

714
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:52,469
I thought you only had the one day.

715
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,834
I did.

716
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,993
This is the second half of it.

717
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,116
Aye, Frankie must be delighted.

718
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,032
So, what are you all up to now?

719
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,270
Going home.
Frankie's got school in the morning.

720
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,589
Why don't you stay?

721
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,033
I mean, just for a wee while.

722
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,439
<i>I mean, he'd love it.</i>

723
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,399
Right, the DJ is rank,
but there's a great band on afterwards.

724
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,194
No, sweetheart, it's been a long day.

725
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,555
<i>And it's time to go now.</i>

726
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,358
Come on, son.

727
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,112
It's just this once.

728
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,476
# Macarena

729
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,755
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena

730
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,308
# Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle
alegria y cosa buena

731
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,317
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena

732
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,799
# Hey, Macarena!

733
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,717
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena

734
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,109
# Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle
alegria y cosa buena

735
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,316
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena

736
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,550
# Hey, Macarena!

737
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,471
# Macarena tiene un novio
que se llama

738
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,032
# Y en la jura de bandera
del muchacho

739
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,553
# Se la dio con dos amigos

740
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,438
# Macarana tiene un novio
que se llama

741
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,750
# Que se llama de apellido Vitorino

742
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,637
# Y en la jura de bandera
del muchacho

743
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,551
# Se la dio con dos amigos

744
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,791
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena...

745
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,313
So? What do you think, then?

746
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:18,039
I don't think anything. Why?

747
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,633
Nothing.

748
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,392
I was just wondering, that's all.

749
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:26,149
There's nothing to wonder.
It's a business arrangement, that's all.

750
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,235
And his ship sails tomorrow, like he said.

751
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,753
Like he said.

752
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,597
Good God.

753
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,874
I can't drink all that.

754
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,872
No, but I know a man who can.

755
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,393
Cheers.

756
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,429
Since when did you start smoking those?

757
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,033
What happened to your roll-ups?

758
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,915
Oh, Jesus. Make my next one a double.

759
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,954
# When I was a young man

760
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,270
# I used to dream of a maiden...

761
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,194
That's my song.

762
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,595
# With long soft hair

763
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,194
# Blowing in the wind

764
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:43,194
# Her laughing eyes
and loving arms would follow

765
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,671
# When I'd sail around the world...

766
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,035
Hey, Frankie. Hey, Frankie.

767
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:55,240
I bet you all your trump cards
that you don't ask Catriona Murray to dance.

768
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:00,195
# I'd ride down on a great white horse...

769
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,437
If you do that, I'll get your mum up to dance.

770
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,199
Deal?

771
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,519
# I'd bring her laughter...

772
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,794
Dance?

773
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,235
# On a rainy day...

774
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,197
I never dance.

775
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,590
You'll have to this once.
Frankie's made another bet.

776
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,351
You'd better watch him.
It's becoming a bit of a habit.

777
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:39,514
# When I was a young girl,
I used to dream of a lover

778
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:48,949
# Who'd be my shining knight
of strength one day

779
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:55,468
# He'd take me to a castle in the heavens

780
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:04,749
# And battle all my dragons on the way

781
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:12,478
# And he'd ride down on a great white horse

782
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:17,156
# He'd give me love

783
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:20,550
# I'd been longing for

784
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:25,308
# He'd bring me joy

785
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:29,439
# And lasting peace

786
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,399
# And on a great white horse

787
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,233
# He'd ride away with me...

788
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,670
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.

789
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:03,475
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!

790
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,797
I had a good time tonight.

791
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:11,757
Don't sound so surprised.

792
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,873
You are the best!

793
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,837
He's got your eyes.

794
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,513
They pull you.

795
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,714
Right in.

796
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,633
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.

797
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,597
I don't know what to say to that.

798
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,756
Well, you don't have to say anything.

799
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,752
You don't have to say nice things to me.

800
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,717
I'm not paying you for that.

801
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,957
So, why don't you want to hear them?

802
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,757
What are you afraid of?

803
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,917
Where did Marie find you?

804
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,518
No.

805
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,397
I thought we agreed: No history.

806
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,437
Things have changed.

807
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,639
Have they?

808
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:25,278
What I find really difficult...

809
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,597
to understand...

810
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,239
is why?

811
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,471
I told you why. Frankie made a bet.

812
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,994
No, no, no, no, no.

813
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,358
Why did he ever leave the two of you?

814
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,590
He didn't leave us. I left him.

815
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,070
One night I just picked Frankie up, and I left.

816
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:00,197
And my mother came with me,
to make sure I never went back.

817
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,557
And we've been leaving ever since.

818
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,552
<i>Always ready in case he shows up.</i>

819
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:19,029
Frankie wasn't born deaf.
It was a present from his daddy.

820
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,470
Frankie's a very... very lucky boy.

821
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:55,148
How do you figure that one out?

822
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,913
I'm his mother, and I lie to him every single day.

823
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,513
No.

824
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,071
No, you protect him every single day.

825
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,395
Do I?

826
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:21,999
Every time I write one of those letters
I promise myself it'll be the last one.

827
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,228
<i>I thought he'd lose interest, in time.</i>

828
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,799
<i>Just stop</i>

829
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:33,870
But see, if he hasn't written
for a couple of weeks,

830
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:37,111
I'm the one egging him on,
telling him to hurry up and write.

831
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,876
<i>It's the only way I can hear his voice.</i>

832
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,793
<i>I'd better go.</i>

833
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,873
I'm away first thing.

834
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,592
Can I say goodbye?

835
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,272
If you can wake him.

836
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,359
Hey.

837
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:25,628
You're coming back?

838
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,916
I don't know, Frankie.

839
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,389
Did you do this?

840
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,834
Frankie, I can't take this. This... This is yours.

841
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,157
I'd be honoured to take it.

842
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,318
It's beautiful.

843
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,757
Remember, Frankie.

844
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,957
We're all connected.

845
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,957
Lizzie, Lizzie.

846
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,638
I've let myself go a wee bit. Sorry.

847
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,511
It's been a long time.

848
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,072
You're still beautiful.

849
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,629
No, I'm not. I'm not beautiful.

850
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,398
I'm sorry.

851
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,431
I'm sorry, Lizzie.

852
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:31,118
I'm sorry, Lizzie.

853
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,270
Shush, Davey. Shush.

854
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,919
It's all right. It's all right now.

855
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:40,959
Don't cry.

856
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,153
Where's Frankie?

857
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:50,231
<i>He's at school.</i>

858
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:53,073
He's nine now, nearly ten.

859
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:54,673
Aye, I know.

860
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,396
He's top at geography.

861
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,677
I always knew he was clever.

862
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,998
Must take that off you.

863
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:10,789
I don't think so. You were the one
that could have gone to college.

864
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,670
I want to see him, Lizzie.

865
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,910
I've got a right to see him.

866
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,116
<i>- Don't give me that.
- It's too late for fighting.</i>

867
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,918
<i>Just let me see him.</i>

868
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,757
I want him to know how sorry I am.

869
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,439
He's my son.

870
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,397
He's not your son. He's mine.

871
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,790
You don't deserve him.

872
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,599
You don't deserve his forgiveness.

873
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,593
Christ.

874
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,877
I made one mistake.

875
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,677
One stupid fucking mistake,
and you made me pay.

876
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,035
<i>You've made me pay, all right.</i>

877
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,071
You're a bitch.

878
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:31,078
<i>You're nothing but a bitch!</i>

879
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,748
I want to see my son!

880
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,639
<i>I've got a right!</i>

881
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:39,233
I'm his father!

882
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,912
<i>I've got rights!</i>

883
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,833
I've got my rights! I'm his father!

884
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,433
You're not his father!

885
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,637
He's got a different father now, a real father.

886
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:53,430
A kind, gentle man, who teaches him
to throw stones across the water.

887
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,272
You could never be his father.

888
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,237
I want to see my son!

889
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,550
<i>- Davey, please, no, come on.
- I'm his father!</i>

890
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:00,709
Davey, no, stop it.

891
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,028
Nurse!

892
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:04,031
<i>Nurse!</i>

893
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,957
I want to see my son!

894
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,837
Lizzie, wait a minute.

895
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:25,558
Lizzie, Lizzie, please.

896
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:27,949
He nearly killed us, Janet!

897
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:30,031
I know. I know.

898
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,956
He's only got a few days left.

899
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,871
He can't touch you now.

900
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,551
Let him die in peace.

901
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,197
For your own sake.

902
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,795
I want to talk to you. It's very important.

903
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,757
I got a message today from your dad.

904
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:25,195
He's not very well, Frankie.

905
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,759
He's very, very sick.

906
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,755
But he says he wants you to know he loves you.

907
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,875
Very much.

908
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,597
<i>Dear Da, I thought you'd like this drawing.</i>

909
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,910
<i>I copied it from my book.</i>

910
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,309
<i>Ma says you're not very well.</i>

911
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,595
<i>I hope you feel better soon.</i>

912
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:18,557
<i>Love from your son, Frankie.</i>

913
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,317
<i>OK, call the crash team.</i>

914
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:56,509
Please! What is wrong with him?

915
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,636
Let's get the bed down. Come on.

916
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:01,557
Mrs Morrison?

917
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:05,076
It might be best if you went
and had a cup of tea just now.

918
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:08,470
I'll send someone along to find you
as soon as we have any news.

919
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,397
This is for my husband.

920
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:13,919
It's from our son.

921
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,513
Right.

922
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,758
- Oh, Nurse, erm...
- Yes?

923
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,513
Could you make sure he sees it?

924
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,192
I'll make sure.

925
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,395
<i>Davey Morrison
died peacefully after a long illness.</i>

926
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,391
<i>Father to Frankie.</i>

927
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:19,673
I know it's a terrible thing to say,
but Davey's finally done you a favour.

928
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,432
It's over now.

929
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,314
Marie?

930
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,628
What?

931
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,358
Who was he?

932
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,352
My brother.

933
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,872
Oh, right.

934
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,757
I've got to go.

935
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,510
- Where are you going?
- I'll see you after.

936
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,352
<i>Do you want me to check the box?</i>

937
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,317
<i>There won't be anything in it.</i>

938
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,868
<i>It'll cost you to have your mail forwarded.</i>

939
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:00,554
I'll check it for you, hen,
just to be on the safe side.

940
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,235
<i>Thanks for the book.</i>

941
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:52,153
<i>I've read it all the way through now twice.</i>

942
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,752
<i>I took it into school.</i>

943
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,353
<i>I know you won't mind.</i>

944
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,396
<i>My teacher put it on the nature table.</i>

945
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:15,828
<i>Miss Mackenzie gave me a gold star.</i>

946
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,957
<i>I've got eight now. Catriona's got 20.</i>

947
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:22,237
<i>Ricky's only got one, and it's not even gold.</i>

948
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,435
<i>Guess what.</i>

949
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,317
<i>I got into the football team.</i>

950
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,358
<i>Well, the reserves. I'm playing on Saturday.</i>

951
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,829
<i>And guess what else.</i>

952
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,990
<i>I got one wrong in geography this week.</i>

953
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,871
<i>Ma and I had a bit of a shock last week.</i>

954
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,675
<i>My da - my real da - he's been sick.</i>

955
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,155
<i>I think he's been sick for a long time.</i>

956
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:55,832
<i>Ma never said anything.</i>

957
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,433
<i>But I just knew.</i>

958
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,751
<i>And last week, he died.</i>

959
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,990
<i>I think ma's very sad, inside.</i>

960
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:04,911
<i>But Marie says time's a great healer,</i>

961
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,754
<i>and Ma's not to worry any more,
