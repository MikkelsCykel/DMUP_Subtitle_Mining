00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,398
- Michael.
- Carl!

2
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,630
Michael, have you seen this?

3
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,874
- Do you recognize him?
- No.

4
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,717
- Haven't you seen Yigael's Wall yet?
- It was only opened up last week.

5
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,237
There are four faces of the Antichrist
on his rise to power.

6
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,437
The face of Yigael's Satan as a child
is the same!

7
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,873
- What are you talking about?
- There is no doubt.

8
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,270
Damien Thorn is the Antichrist.

9
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,239
- Ah, Carl...
- Michael, you must believe me!

10
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,118
I'm an archaeologist, not a religious fanatic.

11
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,352
"Even now, already is he in the world...
and his power shall be mighty...

12
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,958
...and he shall prosper, and practice,
and shall destroy the mighty and the holy."

13
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,237
I appreciate this sermon,
but what possible facts...

14
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,550
His own father knew.

15
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,279
A week ago, he tried to destroy him.

16
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,192
That's a minor detail
these newspapers seem to have omitted.

17
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,154
I gave him the daggers myself.

18
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,633
He is in Chicago,
living with his father's brother.

19
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,510
Now, you... must take this
and give it to his new parents.

20
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,434
- Well, what is it?
- A letter inside explains everything.

21
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,111
- Carl, you can hardly expect...
- They have to be warned!

22
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,033
I'm too old. I'm too ill. I can't go myself.

23
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,071
And I am the only living person
who knows the truth.

24
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,635
I've got a reputation to maintain!

25
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,917
That is why it has to be you.
They will listen to you.

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,991
And then have me committed. No!

27
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,755
Look, Carl, we're old friends.
I think we understand one another.

28
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,279
- You can't expect me to believe that...
- Then come to Yigael's Wall!

29
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,430
- What, now?
- Now!

30
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,352
Here, Michael.

31
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,431
Carl Bugenhagen...

32
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,752
...I hope this guarantees me a place
in the kingdom of heaven.

33
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,473
Michael, you'll be needing your torch now.

34
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,558
It's the Whore of Babylon!

35
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,517
This is priceless.

36
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,031
Michael.

37
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,115
Michael! Come here!

38
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,038
Look.

39
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,195
It is him.

40
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,791
- Is there another way out?
- No.

41
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,240
Carl...

42
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,039
The Antichrist is with us.

43
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,150
Carl! We've got to get out! Carl! Carl,
come on, help me! Carl, help me, will you?

44
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,912
Carl!

45
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,798
- Help!
- Michael!

46
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,111
Michael!

47
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,150
Forces of evil may seem to overwhelm us...

48
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,231
...and be triumphant...

49
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,314
...but goodness will prevail,
for it is written in the Book of Revelation.

50
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,960
"Then shall that wicked be revealed...

51
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,431
...whom the Lord shall consume
with the spirit of his mouth...

52
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,115
...and destroy
with the brightness of his coming."

53
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,954
- Damien!
- I'm coming!

54
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,800
- See you next summer, Jim.
- Say bye to your cousin.

55
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,871
- I will. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

56
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,830
- Come on!
- Coming.

57
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,917
- Did you find him yet?
- Yeah, he's comin'.

58
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,828
- Bye, Aunt Marion. Nice seeing you again.
- Who told you?

59
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,717
Told me what?

60
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,553
Politeness isn't
one of your strong points, Damien.

61
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,349
I'm sure you didn't come to say goodbye
on your own initiative.

62
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,795
I didn't know you were here.
But I was going to.

63
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,030
Were you really?

64
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,714
Goodbye, Aunt Marion.

65
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,111
- All set?
- We think so.

66
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,634
- I'll be right back.
- Let's go.

67
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,393
Now, uh... you boys have your allowance...

68
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,951
...so this is just a little something extra -
in case of emergency.

69
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,434
Hold it!
Did you say goodbye to Aunt Marion?

70
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,511
I did.

71
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,111
Aunt Marion?

72
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,839
Oh, Mark! I haven't seen enough of you.

73
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,913
- You should have come to my room to talk.
- I'm sorry, Aunt Marion.

74
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,310
I know, you've been so busy,
running after that cousin of yours.

75
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,153
You mustn't let him
drag you around the way he does.

76
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,357
He doesn't drag me around. I like him.

77
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,511
Give me a hug.

78
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,318
You be careful.

79
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,868
Yes, Aunt Marion. Goodbye.

80
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,671
Just a second!

81
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,590
Goodbye, Dad.

82
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,672
Did you forget me? Are you sure?

83
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,320
Here, sweetheart, take some biscuits.
Have a good week.

84
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,197
Bye.

85
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,036
- She's too much, Aunt Marion.
- She's awful! Why did they invite her?

86
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,396
So she could wag her finger,
generally ruin our weekend.

87
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,314
At least we don't have to have dinner
with her. God! And what's that smell?

88
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,439
Lavender, you fool! All old ladies
douse themselves in it. I don't know why.

89
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,910
- Now, boys. Just because she's getting on...
- On our nerves!

90
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,470
Now, come on. Murray's right.
Let's hear it for Aunt Marion.

91
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,710
Hooray

92
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,597
Murray, give us a cigarette.

93
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,150
- You know the answer to that one.
- You don't ask, you never know.

94
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,629
- Have you met your new platoon leader?
- Neff?

95
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,995
Neff for "neffer mind".

96
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,153
They're all the same. When you've met
one platoon leader, you've met them all.

97
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,516
Attention! Eyes front! Chest out! Stomach in!

98
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,591
You know something? You're crazy!

99
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,194
- Yeah, cos I've practiced.
- God!

100
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,316
- Would you like some cream, Aunt Marion?
- You've asked me that six times.

101
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,391
I'm sorry, I forgot.

102
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,074
You haven't forgotten. You just don't care.

103
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,799
Marion, let's don't get into
that argument again.

104
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,269
- No cream.
- No cream!

105
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,318
Charles is going to
show us some slides after dinner...

106
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,188
...so why don't you tell us
why you've come, Marion?

107
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,831
I own 27 per cent of Thorn Industries,
left to me by your father.

108
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,596
And I have every right to dispose of my share
in any way that I see fit.

109
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,069
- We know that.
- You also know that...

110
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,948
...at the moment,
I've left everything to you, Richard.

111
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,474
But unless you do what I ask...

112
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,870
Marion, don't threaten me.
Because, as far as I'm concerned...

113
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,350
You can't be unconcerned
about a sum that is close to $100 million!

114
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,839
I shouldn't be here...

115
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,469
You're here, Dr. Warren,
because you're curator of the Thorn Museum.

116
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,154
And I also own 27 per cent of that!

117
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,472
Marion, say what you've got to say.
If it's unpleasant, let's get it over with.

118
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,358
I want you
to take the boys out of the academy.

119
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,796
I want you
to send them to separate schools.

120
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,190
I don't care what you want,
where the boys are concerned.

121
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,513
- They're not your sons, they're ours.
- Neither boy is yours.

122
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,629
May I remind you that
Mark is Richard's son by his first wife.

123
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,793
- And Damien is his brother's son.
- Thank you.

124
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,713
- Thank you very much
- Ann. Ann... Ann, please.

125
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,389
Marion, just what the hell is this about?

126
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,519
Get Mark away from Damien.
They don't belong together!

127
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,275
- Damien's a terrible influence, can't you see?
- What?

128
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,875
That's it. As far as I'm concerned,
our conversation is over.

129
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,839
- And I suggest that...
- Richard, you're blind. Purposely blind!

130
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,196
- You know your brother tried to kill Damien.
- Get out!

131
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,193
- Richard, make her get out!
- Why did he try to kill him? Tell the truth!

132
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,511
- Marion, he was ill!
- You don't have to explain anything to her!

133
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,195
If you don't separate them,
I'll leave everything I own to charity!

134
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,271
I don't care what you do with the money!

135
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,069
Richard, please! Listen to me!
You know what I'm saying is true.

136
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,151
I may be old, but I'm not insane.

137
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,231
Your brother tried to kill Damien.

138
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,359
- Get out! Will you tell her to go?
- I'm going.

139
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,433
I'm sorry, Charles. I apologize for her.
She's old and she's not well.

140
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,398
No, that's, uh... that's all right. I understand.

141
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,873
- I should have noticed before dinner that...
- Richard, I assure you, think nothing of it.

142
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,428
I'll go set up the slides.

143
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,357
I want her out in the morning.
I don't want her in this house.

144
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,671
- The poor woman is senile.
- That "poor woman" is dangerous!

145
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,274
She pollutes the air with her craziness!

146
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,555
The boys can't stand to be
in a room with her.

147
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,234
All right, she goes first thing in the morning.

148
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,390
- Why does she hate Damien?
- I don't know.

149
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,553
She hates him so much! And it's not
just me and the boys she has to leave for.

150
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,870
She starts something in you.

151
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,428
All right, it's over. It's done.

152
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,319
Come on. Let's join Charles, huh?

153
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,193
Many of these
have already been sent.

154
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,590
We should be getting the first shipment
in about three weeks.

155
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,998
Ah. I thought that would interest you.

156
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,153
- Oh, dear!
- Yes, she is a bit frightening, isn't she?

157
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,310
The Whore of Babylon?

158
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,756
You're incredible.
Yep, the Whore of Babylon.

159
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,119
She represents Rome.
"The ten horns of the beast are ten kings...

160
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,318
...who have no kingdoms yet; but will be
granted temporary power by the devil."

161
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,755
His names are carved there.

162
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,831
The Spoiler.

163
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,515
The Little Horn. The Desolate One.

164
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,434
- Why is she riding him?
- I don't know. But it wasn't to be for long.

165
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,829
The Book of Revelation says the ten kings...

166
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,515
..."shall hate the whore,
and make her desolate and naked...

167
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,797
...shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire."

168
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,668
Hm... That's not very nice.

169
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,791
Who's the young lady?

170
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,917
Her name is Joan Hart.
She's a friend of mine - a journalist.

171
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,118
She's doing a biography of Bugenhagen,
the archaeologist who worked in the area.

172
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,919
- I've heard of him.
- She's coming to Chicago, Richard.

173
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,878
- She wants to interview you.
- What for?

174
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,714
Oh, well... Background of the exhibit,
patrons of archaeological digs.

175
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,633
- I'm not very happy about giving interviews.
- I know.

176
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,553
- Of any kind.
- I know.

177
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,631
Oh!

178
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,355
Ohh!

179
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,431
Agh!

180
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,229
Ready! Halt!

181
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,039
Present... arms!

182
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,038
- That must be him.
- He looks OK.

183
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,554
They're all the same.

184
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,072
Order... arms!

185
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,438
Bradley platoon, stand fast!
The other platoons, to the mess hall.

186
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,193
By the right flank, march!

187
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,550
At ease, boys.

188
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,631
This is Sergeant Daniel Neff.

189
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,713
He'll be taking over as platoon officer
from Sergeant Goodrich.

190
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,351
Sergeant Neff is a very experienced soldier,
and I am sure that within a few weeks...

191
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,910
...you will be the snappiest platoon
in the entire academy.

192
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,073
I'll leave any further introductions
to the sergeant.

193
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,756
You'll speak to me only when you're spoken
to. And you'll listen to every word I say.

194
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,236
Because I intend to shine in my new job.

195
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,359
And the only way that I can shine...
is by making you shine.

196
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,639
You're the little unit that I have to polish
until the glare of your achievements...

197
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,439
...blinds everybody on this parade ground.

198
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,549
- Am I understood?
- Yes, sir!

199
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,431
I'll meet each of you personally
in my office after breakfast.

200
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,636
For now... your names?

201
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,279
- Mark Thorn, Sergeant.
- Thorn?

202
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,670
Your family has strong connections
with this place, hasn't it?

203
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,355
- Well? Hasn't it?
- My father and grandfather were cadets, sir.

204
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,833
Good. But understand that doesn't entitle
you to privileges. We're all the same here.

205
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,633
Yours?

206
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,995
Damien Thorn, Sergeant.

207
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,673
- You don't look alike.
- Cousins, Sergeant.

208
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,758
All right. But understand,
the same thing goes for you.

209
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,873
Your name?

210
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,272
- Morning, Bill.
- Well! Richard.

211
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,876
Uh... by the way, there's something
I want to talk over with you.

212
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,317
I'm the first to admit
that Paul's difficult to get on with...

213
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,517
...but it took us years
to find a man with his qualifications.

214
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,797
I'm not questioning his qualifications.
It's, uh...

215
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,950
His manner.

216
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,238
I can even cope with his manner.
I've met and dealt with every kind.

217
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,110
No. I don't like what he's proposing.
It sticks in my craw.

218
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,714
And I don't intend to hide my feelings.

219
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,475
Are you worried it could get us
in trouble with the Justice Department?

220
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,950
Well, he's dealing with highly emotive stuff.

221
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,591
Bill... let's hear him out.
The only thing I ask is...

222
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,674
...that you couch your objections
with a little more delicacy than usual.

223
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,548
Jennie! Is Miss Marion dressed yet?

224
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,349
I don't think she's awake, Mrs. Thorn.
I knocked, but she didn't answer.

225
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,476
Thank you.

226
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,599
Aunt Marion?

227
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,035
You'll miss your plane!

228
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,715
Paul, what you're saying is that we should
give up our leadership in electronics.

229
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,429
You're wrong. My report says
Thorn Industries' main interest...

230
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,829
...is in energy and electronics.

231
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,993
Because of this bias, we ignore
what's going on here at this plant.

232
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,712
We ignore it at our own risk. Our profitable
future, aside from energy, lies also in famine.

233
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,759
What?! That statement is typical of you,
Paul. It's heartless and...

234
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,832
And true. Not heartless, realistic.

235
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,150
Pasarian, hold it here.

236
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,391
Are these solutions designated?

237
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,439
No, not yet. Each tank
has a different fertilizer and pesticide.

238
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,752
They won't be designated until
we pump it into the experimental crop beds.

239
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,956
All right, let's go on.

240
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,271
One person dies of starvation
every 8.6 seconds.

241
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,434
Seven every minute.
420 every hour. 10,000 every day!

242
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,080
To feed these people,
we have to farm the ocean.

243
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,392
We have to develop new strains
of high-yield, disease-resistant grain crops.

244
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,870
The oil countries didn't hesitate
to squeeze our jugular vein.

245
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,951
So, what's so different about food?

246
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,271
If you've got a knife at your belly,
you'll keep still.

247
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,351
Why, then, call my policy unethical?

248
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,796
It's callous and inhuman...
and in my opinion, illegal.

249
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,269
What is inhuman about feeding people?

250
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,351
- Telephone, Mr. Thorn.
- I'm busy.

251
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,795
It's an emergency, sir.

252
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,910
Bill's point is, if we control the food people
eat, it's tantamount to making slaves of them.

253
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,629
- Ah, customers!
- But you want us to buy up their land.

254
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,154
Thorn's have the hardware and knowledge...

255
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,676
...that's easily adaptable
to the purpose of large-scale farming.

256
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,877
This, with the pesticides
and fertilizers we produce...

257
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,952
...gives us the jump
on any corporate entity in the world.

258
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,112
If we control their land,
we make them tenants.

259
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,716
- Bill... we make their bellies full.
- I have to agree with Paul.

260
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,678
I'll be right back.

261
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,668
Marion died in her sleep last night -
a coronary.

262
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,311
- I'm sorry.
- I've got to go. I'll talk to you later, Bill.

263
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,029
- Paul, how about breakfast in the morning?
- Certainly.

264
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,273
- Have they moved in to the apartment yet?
- Today.

265
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,838
Winter is here again.

266
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,395
That's Damien's father right there in the back.

267
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,199
My old man played on that team, too.
That's him.

268
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,431
He was on the line,
but Robert Thorn was quarterback.

269
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,909
Even back then he was calling all the plays.

270
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,310
- You're next, Damien.
- Hey, Teddy.

271
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,995
Don't ever talk about my father again.
Do you understand?

272
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,276
Can't you take a joke?

273
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,954
Yeah.

274
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,838
- What was that all about?
- Your cousin really thinks he's somebody.

275
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,753
My old man tells me
the Thorns make their own hats...

276
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,150
...because they don't sell 'em
large enough for their big heads!

277
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,996
You're gonna regret that, Thorn.

278
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,989
"Mathematics, good.
Science, very good. Military history, fair."

279
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,072
- "Room for improvement."
- Yes, Sergeant.

280
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,517
Physical training is excellent.
I hear you're quite a football player.

281
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,718
Be proud of your accomplishments.
Pride's OK when there's a reason to be proud.

282
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,314
Yes, Sergeant.

283
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,278
I'm here to teach you,
but also I'm here to help you.

284
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,669
Any problems, you come to me.

285
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,754
Don't be afraid. Day or night.
Any advice. You understand?

286
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,959
- Whatever you say, Sergeant.
- We're gonna get to know each other.

287
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,190
I see you're an orphan.

288
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,150
That's something we have in common.

289
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,155
Send Foster in.

290
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,640
What's the matter?
Don't you like it on your back?

291
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,950
Teddy!

292
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,949
Another Thorn.

293
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,553
- What the hell are we waiting for? Foster.
- Yes, sir?

294
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,108
You two, you finished? Out!

295
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,468
What are you doing? Polishing the floor

296
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,949
What did you do to him?

297
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,190
I don't know.

298
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,870
I don't know.

299
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,037
Come on. Once around the field.
I'll give you a head start.

300
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,511
Come on!

301
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,714
When do you plan to, uh... open the exhibit?

302
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,555
Oh, a lot depends on when
we get the last of the crates from abroad.

303
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,790
- I'd say around Easter.
- Oh, good.

304
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,198
Are you going to make Mark's birthday party?

305
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,398
- You know I will. Will the lake be frozen?
- Bring your skates.

306
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,871
- I've made a decision about your report.
- Oh, let me...

307
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,554
I've come down on Bill Atherton's side.

308
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,233
Yes...

309
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,391
It might be premature
to embark on such a radical programme.

310
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,278
I wouldn't wanna risk diffusing it
before it's time.

311
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,114
- We'll keep it on ice?
- Good.

312
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,837
Richard... if you think I've gone too far...

313
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,632
...if Bill's antagonism towards me is going
to continue, maybe I should step down.

314
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,634
Forget it. Your time will come.

315
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,868
- Looks like it might rain, Murray.
- Could be, sir.

316
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,190
- Let's go.
- Mr. Thorn!

317
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,840
I'm sorry to shout -
I didn't want to miss you.

318
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,230
My name is Joan Hart.
I believe Charles Warren told you about me.

319
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,878
- He did.
- I must talk to you.

320
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,589
- Well, I asked him to...
- It's freezing. Couldn't we sit in your car?

321
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,955
- Well...
- I know you don't talk to reporters...

322
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,031
- I'm going to the airport.
- Two minutes.

323
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,109
- Well...
- Please?

324
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,875
- I can't miss my plane. Now, if...
- I'll come to the airport with you.

325
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,189
All right, get in.

326
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,632
All right, Miss Hart. Our time is short,
so what would you like to know?

327
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,395
Did you ever meet
the archaeologist Carl Bugenhagen?

328
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,632
- No. I heard of him.
- He was also an exorcist. Did you know that?

329
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,755
No.

330
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,516
His skeleton was found last week
on your dig at Hazor, close to Yigael's Wall.

331
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,875
Seven years after his disappearance.

332
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,875
A journalistic assumption. The skeleton
has not been verified as that of Bugenhagen.

333
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,474
Oh, but it has! I've just come from there.

334
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,353
Your brother met him. Did you know that?

335
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,556
Where did you get that information?

336
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,236
A photographer that I used to work with
went with your brother. He died there.

337
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,949
- He was decapitated.
- Murray, stop the car.

338
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,477
Your brother went to see Bugenhagen.
A few days later, Bugenhagen disappeared!

339
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,994
- Get out!
- Do you know why he went to see him?

340
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,196
Don't make me throw you out, Miss Hart.

341
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,670
You must listen to me.
I've been working on the story for years now!

342
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,990
I think I've pieced it together.

343
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,038
I never believed in
the prophecies of the Bible before.

344
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,588
But now... you are in grave danger!

345
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,468
- Don't try to contact me again!
- Put your strength in Christ!

346
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,551
Only he can protect you.

347
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,313
Oh, please, please! You must listen to me!

348
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,990
Oh, please, please! You must listen to me!

349
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,072
Bugenhagen warned your brother!

350
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,434
Oh, God...

351
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,273
And just last week
we finally uncovered Yigael's Wall.

352
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,193
- Who is Yigael?
- Incredible person. Very mysterious.

353
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,831
We're not really sure. He was a monk, he was
an exorcist. He lived about the 13th century.

354
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,879
The story goes that
Satan appeared in person to Yigael...

355
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,474
...who, not unexpectedly,
went out of his mind.

356
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,950
He also went into hiding,
obsessed with painting what he had seen:

357
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:16,068
...incredible visions of the Antichrist,
from birth to downfall.

358
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,436
But the reason I don't want you
to say anything to Richard is...

359
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,954
...I want it to be a present.
- Good.

360
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,998
I've got a surprise for you, too.

361
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,198
Your favorite piece. We're gonna put it
right in the middle of Gallery Four.

362
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,431
I think you should lean her up
against one of the back doors

363
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,910
- Charles.
- Joan! When did you get in?

364
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,072
- Last night.
- Excuse me, Ann. This is Joan Hart, who...

365
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,993
- Who wanted to interview Richard.
- I did interview him.

366
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,514
- You did what?!
- I couldn't take no for an answer.

367
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,273
- It was too important.
- You must be very persuasive.

368
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,828
He doesn't have
a very high opinion of reporters.

369
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,314
Excuse me, I have a call.

370
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,318
Your husband is a little unfair on the press.
They were very kind to his brother.

371
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,039
Were they? I never knew his brother.

372
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,637
That's right!
You're Richard Thorn's second wife.

373
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,029
Tell me about Damien.
What sort of a boy is he?

374
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,759
- Is he enjoying life at the military academy?
- Ann!

375
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,994
- Don't say a word. Richard is furious!
- Charles, you are in danger! All of you!

376
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,435
- What's got into you?
- I've seen Yigael's Wall.

377
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,318
- I don't care what you've seen.
- You must! Damien...

378
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,436
What about Damien?

379
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,796
I'm not sure yet.

380
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,392
What was that all about?

381
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,436
- Which one is Damien Thorn?
- Oh, he's the wide receiver right over there.

382
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,469
Now take a break.

383
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,598
...which art in heaven.

384
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,272
Hallowed be thy name.

385
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,510
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, on earth...

386
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,914
Oh, no! No! What?

387
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,953
Oh, come on. Please... What is this?

388
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,509
Please.

389
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,151
Oh, God.

390
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,512
Agh!

391
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,275
Help me! No!

392
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,629
Help me!

393
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,352
Hey, Dad!

394
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,431
Ohh!

395
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,794
That's not fair. Now you're gonna get it!

396
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,831
Hooray!

397
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,277
- Make a wish and blow out the candles.
- Go ahead, Mark. Blow them out!

398
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,351
All of them, Mark.

399
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,550
Hold it, Mark.

400
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,200
Cut the cake.

401
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,910
- Make a wish!
- He's made one.

402
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,355
Ooh, there goes the lake.

403
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,875
Oh, Paul. I'm really gratified to learn...

404
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,111
...that you decided to shelve
your land acquisition project.

405
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,590
Well... it may be in the best interests
of the company, Bill.

406
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,069
But I still don't understand your opposition.

407
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,232
Just because it's never been done
doesn't make it illegal.

408
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,038
No.

409
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,429
But is it ethical?

410
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,910
- There we are.
- Thank you.

411
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,991
- Take a fork, darling.
- All right.

412
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,230
Thanks.

413
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,912
- How are things at the academy, Damien?
- OK, Mr. Buher.

414
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,877
And Sergeant Neff?

415
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,951
- Do you know him?
- I've asked about him.

416
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,914
Just keeping an eye on you, Damien.

417
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,878
Do you know exactly what I do
for Thorn Industries?

418
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,474
- Not really, sir.
- Well, you should.

419
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,872
You should know everything about
the Thorn business - it'll be yours one day.

420
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,871
And Mark's.

421
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,474
And Mark's. Of course.

422
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,599
Say, why don't you, uh...
pay a visit to the plant soon?

423
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,319
- Could I bring some friends?
- Of course.

424
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,073
May I have your attention?

425
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,355
Listen, everyone!

426
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,035
Before Mark opens his presents,
I have a surprise for you...

427
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,759
...so I want you to all follow me.

428
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,350
A boy's 13th birthday is considered by many
as the beginning of puberty, of manhood.

429
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,116
Many cultures have... initiation rites.
You'll be initiated too, Damien.

430
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:49,597
Yes... The time is coming for you to put aside
childish things and face up to who you are.

431
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,479
A great moment, Damien.
Surely you must be feeling it?

432
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,551
I think so.

433
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,795
I'm not sure.

434
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,635
But I feel that something's happening to me.
Is going to happen.

435
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,913
Suspicions of destiny. We all have them.

436
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,431
Your uncle has, I'm sure.

437
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,715
And Bill Atherton. And myself.

438
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,630
A deep, wordless knowledge
that our time has come.

439
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,430
Hey, Damien, come on! We got fireworks!

440
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,353
- Oh, look at that!

441
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,869
Hey, hey, hey!

442
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,951
Hey! Hey!

443
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,951
Shoot!

444
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,717
- Ha!
- Urgh!

445
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,076
- Oh! Charles!
- I still can't stop.

446
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,115
Oh!

447
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,670
A little girl was giving me lessons,
but she got disgusted.

448
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,239
What'll you have?

449
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,676
- Hot dogs, hamburgers, ribs?
- Everything. I'm famished.

450
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,116
- Why don't you go to a warming tent?
- I will.

451
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,909
Charles... I heard about your reporter friend.
What's her name?

452
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,230
- Joan Hart.
- I'm so sorry.

453
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,791
Yes... It was so strange,
to get hit by a truck on a deserted highway.

454
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,553
I know.

455
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,958
- Here.
- Thank you.

456
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,238
Shoot!

457
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,233
No.

458
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,159
Argh! Aargh!

459
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,549
- Bill!
- Dad!

460
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,030
- Bill!
- Stay off the ice!

461
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,633
Hold on!

462
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,597
- Who is that?
- Mr. Atherton.

463
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,319
Hold on, Bill! Somebody get a pole.

464
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,152
Oh, God! He's gone!

465
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,958
- He's here!
- The current's got him!

466
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,833
- We've lost him!
- Spread out, everybody!

467
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,276
- Can anybody see him?
- Here he is!

468
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,519
Come on! Come on! He's gone.

469
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,194
- Dad, what do we do?
- Here he is!

470
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,913
- Somebody get an axe!
- God!

471
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,833
He's caught in the current.

472
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,069
- Dad!
- How long can he stay under?

473
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,594
He's moving!

474
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,152
Stand back, everybody!

475
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,237
Mr. Thorn!

476
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,631
Hurry!

477
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,314
Hold on! We'll get you.

478
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,154
Spread out! Everybody spread out!

479
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,674
Richard... I'm leaving soon.

480
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,990
Well, Paul, your time came
sooner than we expected.

481
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,077
You're going to be alone
as the new president for a while...

482
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,550
...because Ann and I
are going to take a vacation.

483
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,471
Don't worry, Richard.
I think we've covered everything.

484
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,438
Thanks for staying around
the last few days.

485
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,988
I appreciate it.

486
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,432
- Morning, Byron.
- You're on the newsstands this morning!

487
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,796
Oh, you must've seen it already.
I think it's neat.

488
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,078
- Have you heard from Pasarian?
- No. He seems to have disappeared.

489
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,993
- Richard wants to see you.
- He's back from his vacation?

490
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,755
- Yeah, he looks great, too.
- He needed it.

491
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,908
What the hell is Pasarian doing in India?

492
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,675
I needed a second opinion
on our proposed land purchases there.

493
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,830
We're not buying already?

494
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,879
You agreed I could activate
the conclusions in my report in full.

495
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,590
That doesn't exclude me from making policy
decisions as far as the company's concerned!

496
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,036
- You were on holiday.
- You could have reached me by phone!

497
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,953
Bill Atherton wouldn't have
made those decisions!

498
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,032
- I'm not Bill Atherton.
- I don't expect you to be.

499
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,069
But I do expect you
to observe the rules of company conduct!

500
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,870
I'll remember.

501
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,951
What did you want with Pasarian?

502
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:16,068
There's something wrong with the design
of his P-84 unit. Walker's agitated.

503
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,675
I know he's the voice of doom and disaster,
but this time he has a point.

504
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,354
Leave it to me, Richard.

505
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,672
By this time, Napoleon thought
he was invincible...

506
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,955
...and this is where he made his big mistake.

507
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,919
When he attacked, the Russians
skillfully retreated into their own country.

508
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,197
They lured him on,
and he reached Moscow to find it in ruins.

509
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,915
Who laughed?

510
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,432
I did, sir.

511
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,351
You?

512
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,431
Come here.

513
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,874
With that piece of paper.

514
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,754
So we have an artist in the class!

515
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,355
What's wrong, Thorn? Am I boring you?

516
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,190
You, of course,
know all about Napoleon's campaigns

517
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,431
- Something about them, sir.
- Do you now?

518
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,559
- How many men did he lose in Russia?
- 450,000, sir.

519
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,200
The Russians played at surrender
until winter...

520
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,874
...and then he began his disastrous retreat.

521
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,554
Despite Marshal Ney's
heroic rearguard action...

522
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,918
...the Grand Army was cut down
from 600,000 to less than 50,000.

523
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,993
- Date?
- 1812. He was deposed as emperor in 1814.

524
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,594
- And then?
- After a brief exile in Elba...

525
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,674
...he went to France and began the Hundred
Days' War, until he was defeated at Waterloo.

526
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,751
- A date?
- 1815.

527
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,752
- Let's stick with dates. The emperor's death?
- 1821.

528
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,319
- Battle of the Nile?
- 1789.

529
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,799
- Trafalgar?
- 1805.

530
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,110
- Thirty Years' War?
- Start or finish?

531
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,475
- Start.
- 1618.

532
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,596
- The Black... Death?
- 1334.

533
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,830
- Abraham Lincoln's death?
- 1865.

534
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,194
- Charles I?
- 1649.

535
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,713
- Oliver Cromwell?
- 1658.

536
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,279
- Thomas More?
- 1535.

537
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,588
- Thomas à Becket?
- 1170.

538
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,750
- The Black Prince?
- 1376.

539
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,952
- Jean Paul Marat?
- 1793.

540
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,473
- Danton's death?
- 1794.

541
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,551
- William McKinley?
- 1901.

542
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,517
- The death of Socrates?
- 399 BC.

543
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,749
- Aristotle?
- 322 BC.

544
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,558
- Alexander the Great?
- 323 BC.

545
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,631
- Uh... Sir Francis Drake?
- 1596.

546
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,790
- Uh... Julius Caesar?
- 44 BC.

547
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,233
- Roosevelt?
- 1945.

548
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,153
- Richard III?
- Thorn!

549
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,231
Come here.

550
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,391
Outside.

551
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,995
Copy the blackboard!

552
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,514
What were you trying to do, Damien?

553
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,359
- What were you trying to do?
- I was just answering questions, Sergeant.

554
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,069
- You were showing off.
- No, I just knew all the answers.

555
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,275
Somehow, I just knew them all.

556
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,830
- You mustn't attract attention.
- I wasn't trying to. I just felt...

557
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,993
The day will come when everyone will know
who you are. But that day is not yet.

558
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,072
- What do you mean?
- There are things you don't understand.

559
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,358
Read your Bible. In the New Testament,
there is a Book of Revelation.

560
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,079
For you, it is just that -
a book of revelation.

561
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,515
For you. About you.

562
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,591
Read it. 13th chapter.

563
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,558
Read. Learn. Understand.

564
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,198
What am I supposed to understand?

565
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,193
Who you are.

566
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,199
"And all the world wondered after the beast."

567
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,750
"And they worshipped the dragon
which gave power unto the beast:

568
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,435
... and they worshipped the beast,
saying 'Who is like unto the beast?"'

569
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,193
"'Who is able to make war with him?"'

570
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,636
"And I saw the beast, and the kings
of the earth, and their armies...

571
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,555
... gathered together to make war against him
that sat on the horse, and against his army."

572
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,156
"And through his policy also shall he
cause craft to prosper in his hand;

573
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,708
... and he shall magnify himself in his heart...

574
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,109
. And by peace shall destroy many."

575
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,156
"He shall also stand up
against the Prince of princes."

576
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:33,512
"And he causeth all, both small and great,
rich and poor, free and bond...

577
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,912
... to receive a mark in their right hand,
or in their foreheads:

578
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,120
... And that no man might buy or sell, save that
he had the mark, or the name of the beast...

579
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,316
... or the number of his name."

580
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,913
"Here is wisdom."

581
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,510
"Let him that hath understanding
count the number of the beast:

582
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,955
... for it is the number of a man;

583
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,669
... and his number
is six hundred and sixty-six."

584
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,595
Right...

585
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,114
...face!

586
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,912
What's wrong?

587
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,111
Why?!

588
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,953
Why me?!

589
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,749
Where did you go to?

590
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,354
Why aren't you speaking to me?

591
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,909
Damien? Are you all right?

592
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,869
I'm OK now.

593
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,269
Go to sleep.

594
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,512
 Flight 63 to New York's John F Kennedy
airport - now loading at gate 37.

595
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:03,038
All passengers scheduled on flight 59
to Houston, Fort Worth...

596
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,032
... please check with your airlines agent.

597
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,317
There will be an approximate delay
of one to two hours.

598
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,640
This is the Thorn residence.

599
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,676
No, Mr. Pasarian. He's out.

600
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,310
Yes?

601
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,233
Pasarian! Where the hell are you?

602
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,550
Uh-huh.

603
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,959
Listen...

604
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,828
Listen. I think you'd better
get over here right away.

605
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,717
All right.

606
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,431
Not in.

607
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,637
Why would Pasarian call me here?

608
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,518
Oh, well. I'll call him tomorrow.

609
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,674
Hello!

610
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:17,038
And when I telephoned him the next day,
they told me he was dead! Murdered!

611
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,111
- What?
- Strangled.

612
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,637
Are you telling me that because he refused to
sell to us, he was killed by one of our people?

613
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,950
- I'm almost sure of it.
- Impossible.

614
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,589
Look, I was in eight provinces
evaluating land you want to buy...

615
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,830
...and in three of them, three killings!

616
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,878
- Who's responsible?
- I've no idea!

617
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,912
- I'll look into it.
- Shouldn't we tell Mr. Thorn?

618
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,639
I'll talk to him.
By the way, he wants to see you.

619
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,712
- Oh? What for?
- The P-84's been acting up.

620
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,952
There's a report on your desk. Take care of it
tomorrow. I don't want to shut it down.

621
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,429
Yeah, I'll, uh... I'll take care of it.

622
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,513
I hope we don't have
some overenthusiastic men in the field.

623
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,748
Come on, everybody. Let's go.

624
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,154
All right, you guys, how do you like it so far?

625
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:56,113
This huge complex I'm about to show you is
run entirely by three men and this computer.

626
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,475
Mr. Thorn's office, please.

627
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,199
Hello, is Mr. Thorn in yet? It's Pasarian.

628
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,637
He still hasn't called?

629
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,156
I know. I know.
Please, keep trying. Thank you.

630
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,709
Have you got the P-84 check list?

631
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,435
Put your hats on, please, gentlemen.

632
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:37,230
Keep your glasses on at all times, please.
Put your hats on and your glasses.

633
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,551
Now, as you know,
to make crops grow faster and fatter...

634
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,872
...you need more improved and powerful
fertilizers - pesticides as well.

635
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,960
Isn't there a pesticide
that works on sex?

636
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:55,957
That's right. Sex attractants - pheromones -
are extracted from one sex, put into traps...

637
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:00,318
...to, uh... attract other insects
of the opposite sex and kill them.

638
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,391
Past policy has made a forceful case...

639
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,916
...for Thorn's continued adherence
to electronics, to energy.

640
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,312
But the future of Thorn Industries
lies not only in solar energy...

641
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,914
...in shale oil, and the force of gravity.

642
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,673
Our profitable future, gentlemen...

643
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,149
...is also... in famine.

644
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,477
We now possess... potentially...
the most formidable force in the world...

645
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,915
...for large-scale agricultural endeavors.

646
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,629
However... we have to guard against
the indigenous populations...

647
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:37,475
...ever thinking we are in the business of
exploitation. We are not! I emphasize that.

648
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,518
We are there to help.

649
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,239
- Yes, Jane?
- Mr. Pasarian's working on the P-84.

650
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,914
- You wanted to know when he got there.
- Thank you.

651
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,468
Gentlemen, take a half-hour break.

652
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,910
We are now about to enter
a highly complex experimental area...

653
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,438
...where the use of toxic chemicals, we hope,
will one day feed the world's hungry.

654
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,838
This is P-84. Proceed with check on vat 29.

655
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,958
Start with 22-L.

656
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:36,996
Check.

657
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,353
93-D.

658
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:44,836
Check.

659
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,559
Now this is a ten-inch valve - computerized.

660
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:51,030
Programmed to deliver
precise mixes of gases and solutions...

661
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,793
...from storage vats into the main plant.

662
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:57,793
Uh... however, at this time,
this is closed for repairs.

663
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,029
Check.

664
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,553
14-S.

665
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,591
- Uh-oh!
- What's wrong?

666
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,873
Arghh!

667
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,518
Shut down P-84!

668
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,034
All right, everybody, back the way we came!

669
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,554
- Shut down P-84!
- It won't shut off!

670
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,551
It has to.

671
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,074
Oh, my God!

672
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:10,399
I want a complete report of what happened
first thing in the morning. Understand?

673
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,074
Mr. Thorn. They're going to be all right.

674
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,799
We checked every boy for lung damage.
There's none.

675
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,519
They're nauseous,
but there's no permanent damage.

676
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:30,310
- Doctor, I don't care what it costs...
- I assure you, they'll receive the best care.

677
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,278
Now, there is one thing, though.

678
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:37,478
We've made every possible test
of blood damage, tissue damage...

679
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:41,075
...and every boy was affected
to some degree - though not seriously.

680
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,238
That is, every boy
except your nephew Damien.

681
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,515
- Do you mean that...
- No, no, no, Mr. Thorn.

682
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,068
He wasn't affected at all.

683
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,595
I'd like to keep Damien here
for a couple of days, to run some tests.

684
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,153
You're gonna be all right.
There's just one thing.

685
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:03,518
The doctor would like to have Damien
stay for a few days to run some tests.

686
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,874
I'm OK!

687
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,190
- Why do I have to stay here if I'm OK?
- Shh.

688
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,238
- Why do more tests?
- I don't wanna stay here.

689
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:13,312
Couldn't I bring him back next week?

690
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,395
Your permission, Doctor?

691
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,155
- That's fine.
- Good.

692
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,038
You rest. We'll collect you later.

693
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,156
Maybe go up to Lakeside.

694
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,357
Hm? Think the air would do you good?

695
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,715
Be good, now.

696
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,195
Jackal?!

697
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,238
Hello, Ben?

698
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:35,153
I need to see you urgently. Can I come down?

699
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:39,950
No, no. There's something here
that I just don't understand.

700
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,789
Arghh!

701
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,876
Oh, my God! It's horrible.

702
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:18,556
We were just talking to him yesterday,
when he wanted to do those tests on Damien.

703
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,631
What kind of tests were they?

704
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,359
I'm not sure. I don't think he knew.

705
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,152
- Where are the boys?
- Still sleeping.

706
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,918
Damien was not affected by the gas.

707
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,991
Oh... We can be thankful for that.

708
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,719
Why all the other boys and not Damien?

709
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,836
I don't understand.

710
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,876
What did the doctor say?

711
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:47,557
The tissue tests he made... indicate
that Damien has a different cell structure.

712
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,200
Different? That's absurd!

713
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,351
Not to Dr. Kane.

714
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:56,991
- He was quite concerned about it.
- Well, what does it mean?

715
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,873
I don't know.

716
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,432
Nicky, what you done for yourself
is good enough, but...

717
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,355
... what you done for Jerry is a miracle!

718
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:37,599
- Projectionist!
- Drop dead!

719
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,429
Mmm...

720
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:11,114
At last, a happy ending for a change!

721
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,749
- It was boring!
- You're too young to be so cynical.

722
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,669
- Who wants a corned beef sandwich?
- One!

723
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,352
- Two!
- All right.

724
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:32,438
I'll go!

725
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,636
- Hello, Damien.
- Dr. Warren.

726
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,435
Is, uh... Richard home?

727
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:51,114
Yes. He's in the family room.

728
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:57,999
Charles! What a nice surprise.
Let me fix you a drink.

729
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,752
- Brandy?
- No.

730
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,718
Richard, I have to ask you
something very personal.

731
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,952
- We're friends.
- What happened to your brother in London?

732
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:23,797
- Why do you ask that?
- I opened a box that was sent from Israel.

733
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,916
It belonged to Bugenhagen.

734
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,592
So?

735
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:31,229
Did you know Bugenhagen gave your brother
the daggers to kill Damien?

736
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,552
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Years ago, Bugenhagen wrote you a letter.

737
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,599
- I never got a letter.
- It was never sent. It was still in the box.

738
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:45,232
Richard... you know that I'm a rational man,
but what I have to say to you isn't rational.

739
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:49,919
Bugenhagen claims that Damien...
is the devil's son:

740
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,434
...the beast foretold in the Book of Revelation.

741
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,511
He isn't human. He was born of a jackal.

742
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,398
- I know it sounds incredible!
- Why do you tell me this?

743
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,552
Your brother was convinced.
He went to Bugenhagen for help.

744
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:05,316
- Bugenhagen told him how to kill the boy.
- My brother was mentally ill. His wife was...

745
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:10,190
Was killed by Damien. Five deaths, Richard -
five unexplained, horrible accidents.

746
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,875
- According to Bugenhagen...
- Who was insane! And you believe it!

747
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:17,714
- Read his letter yourself!
- I won't read the ravings of a senile old man!

748
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:22,874
I knew Bugenhagen. He wasn't senile. If what
he says is true, we are all in great danger.

749
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,270
You, Ann, Mark - all of us!
Have you noticed anything suspicious?

750
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,839
- No.
- Something he's said?

751
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,911
- Nothing!
- There've been deaths among us.

752
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,592
Joan, Bill, Pasarian...

753
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,592
- Coincidental.
- What about Aunt Marion? There's proof!

754
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,240
- What proof?!
- Yigael's Wall. Bugenhagen saw it.

755
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:42,189
- It's the thing that convinced him.
- Enough! I don't wanna hear any more.

756
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:46,671
- The wall arrives in New York tomorrow!
- Then you go and look at it!

757
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,991
I will.

758
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,831
You can't believe this? Damien?!

759
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,639
I didn't say I believe it.
I just told you what he said.

760
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:27,748
- Well, you're thinking of going to New York...
- Oh, it's... it's damn nonsense!

761
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,595
The only thing is that Robert was shot in the
church while he was trying to stab Damien.

762
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,274
He's gotten to you, hasn't he?

763
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,079
He's gotten his craziness into you!

764
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:41,152
I am not gonna let him poison you.
You're not going away.

765
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,595
- Ann...
- Forget you ever spoke to him.

766
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:47,912
It's over! It's over!
It is a filthy, stupid story, and it's over!

767
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,312
- Richard, stop it. Stop it. Please, God!
- All right, all right. I won't go.

768
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,836
You're not gonna treat Damien
any differently?

769
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,911
- I won't, I promise.
- Give me your word.

770
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,309
I promise.

771
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,671
Look, we could both use some air...

772
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:15,039
...so why don't you get into some clothes
and we'll go out and hunt up the kids?

773
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,911
Mark?

774
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:24,390
I know you're there.

775
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,354
Why are you running away from me, Mark?

776
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,590
I know who you are.

777
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,875
- You do?
- Dr. Warren knows.

778
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,192
- I overheard him talking to Dad.
- Well, what did he say?

779
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:01,068
He said the... the devil
could create his image on earth.

780
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,151
The devil?!

781
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,993
What else did he say?

782
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,632
Say it, Mark.

783
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,631
- He said you're the beast!
- Come on! What are you talking about?

784
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,234
Your father tried to kill you!

785
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:22,790
They say he was crazy,
but it was because he knew!

786
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,555
I love you, Mark. You're like my brother!

787
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:30,030
- No! No!
- You are my brother.

788
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:35,676
- You mean more to me...
- The beast has no brother! Don't call me that!

789
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,797
- Listen to me, Mark...
- Admit it! You killed your mother!

790
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,475
No! She wasn't my mother. I was adopted.

791
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,630
A jackal! You were born of a jackal!

792
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,031
Yes.

793
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:51,351
Born in the image
of the greatest power in the world.

794
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,431
The Desolate One.

795
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,990
Desolate because his greatness
was taken from him and he was cast down!

796
01:23:57,080 --> 01:24:00,231
But he has risen, Mark. In me!

797
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:06,075
Come with me, Mark.

798
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,711
I can take you with me.

799
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,069
No.

800
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:16,592
Don't make me beg you, Mark.

801
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:19,478
No, Damien.

802
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,596
Mark?

803
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,630
Look at me, Mark.

804
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,797
I'll ask you once more.

805
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,314
Please come with me.

806
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,319
Aghhh!

807
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,151
Mark...

808
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,118
Oh, Mark...

809
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,911
- What happened?
- I don't know!

810
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,833
We were walking... a-and he fell.

811
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,309
- He fell.
- Get back to the house.

812
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,277
I didn't do anything!

813
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,272
He just fell. I didn't do anything!

814
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,915
All that the Father giveth to me
shall come to me.

815
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,835
And him that cometh to me,
I will in no wise cast out.

816
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:10,278
He that raised up Jesus from the dead
will also give life to our mortal bodies...

817
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:13,477
...by his spirit that dwelleth in us.

818
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:18,318
In sure and certain hope
of the Resurrection to eternal life...

819
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,470
...through our Lord, Jesus Christ...

820
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,838
...we commend to Almighty God
our brother Mark.

821
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,753
And we commit him to the ground.

822
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,551
Earth to earth...

823
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,835
...ashes to ashes...

824
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,593
...dust to dust.

825
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,318
Let us pray.

826
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:42,520
Merciful God, Father of Our Lord, Jesus
Christ, who is the Resurrection and the life...

827
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:46,070
 How could it be, Doctor?
There would have been some sign.

828
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,390
You've examined him a dozen times yourself.

829
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,994
 I've seen it happen before, I'm afraid.

830
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:55,631
A perfectly normal boy, or man,
seemingly healthy in all respects.

831
01:26:55,720 --> 01:27:00,157
But waiting in his brain,
a thin artery wall. The wall collapses...

832
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,437
 And... and it was there
from the time he was born?

833
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,556
 More than likely.

834
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:08,108
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

835
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,719
I don't want to go, Ann. I have to.

836
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,509
Why can't you phone him? Why do you
have to go all the way to New York?

837
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,273
Because I've heard that he's in trouble.

838
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,989
- Look, he needs me!
- I need you.

839
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,799
I'll be back as soon as possible.

840
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,839
- Reverend Weston?
- Yes. May I help you?

841
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,196
- I'm Richard Thorn.
- Oh, Mr. Thorn, I'm so glad you could come.

842
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:00,909
- Come this way, please.
- I wanna thank you for calling me.

843
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,036
Can you tell me what's wrong with him?

844
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,111
He refuses to speak to me.

845
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:08,795
All I can tell you
is that he's absolutely terrified.

846
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,550
- Who is it?
- Mr. Thorn is here.

847
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,190
- Richard?
- It's me, Charles.

848
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,157
I came as quickly as I...

849
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,433
- I saw the wall. It's all true!
- Now listen...

850
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:32,229
The beast is with us. I saw the wall!
It drove Joan Hart mad, Bugenhagen...

851
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,834
- Where is it?
- I saw Damien's face!

852
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,558
Where is it?!

853
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,399
Come on.

854
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:08,311
I can't go back in there!
I'm so frightened. Please hurry.

855
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,868
Please hurry!

856
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,951
Please...

857
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:42,835
Arghh! Arghh!

858
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:45,070
No! No! No!

859
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,559
Arghh!

860
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:49,115
Arghh!

861
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:50,272
And now, on this graduation day,
it gives me great pleasure...

862
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:54,990
...to honor those cadets who have excelled
in individual achievement.

863
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:59,119
The highest honor, the Officer's Saber,
is awarded each year...

864
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:04,433
...to that cadet who best exemplifies
the character and spirit of the academy.

865
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:08,832
This year's recipient
is Cadet Sergeant Damien Thorn.

866
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:29,400
Congratulations, Damien.

867
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,277
Davidson Military Academy is now proud
to promote the following cadets...

868
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,715
...to the grades as indicated.

869
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:46,188
I have to go.
Richard will be at the airport soon.

870
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,874
Will you be coming back for the cotillion?

871
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,076
We'll try.

872
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,431
Michael Fennig...
promoted to second lieutenant.

873
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:02,154
John Hickox...
promoted to second lieutenant.

874
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,390
- Where's Damien?
- At the cotillion, sir.

875
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:23,472
- Get him and bring him to the museum.
- What about you, sir?

876
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:26,791
- We'll take a cab.
- Why? Why do you want Damien?

877
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:04,358
You can't... you can't make me believe it.

878
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,114
- You can't make me believe it!
- You've got to!

879
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,998
- He killed Mark, Atherton and Pasarian.
- What?

880
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:18,072
He'll kill anyone he thinks is threatening him!

881
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:20,913
- How? Did he make the ice crack
- Not himself!

882
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,675
Did he... Did he pull the gas pipe apart
Did he?

883
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,791
Excuse me. I have to go.

884
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,871
Ohh!

885
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:54,070
There are others. Surrounding him,
helping him, keeping him safe.

886
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:58,119
Richard, listen to yourself.
Listen! Listen to how crazy you sound!

887
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:01,510
Others! Devils? A conspiracy of devils?!
Richard, please!

888
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:05,798
Ann, I saw Charles killed!
I saw Damien's face on the wall!

889
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:11,199
What are you going to do? Richard!

890
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,709
What are you doing?

891
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,917
The daggers have to be here somewhere.

892
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,355
What do you want them for?

893
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,112
No. No!

894
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:31,830
- He's not human!
- He's a boy you've loved for seven years!

895
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,751
The boy has got to die!

896
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,991
Richard... For me, Richard, don't!

897
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:09,038
Ann, what are you doing?
Get away from that drawer.

898
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,918
What you want to do is crazy.
I can't let you, Richard.

899
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:12,989
Ann!

900
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:16,470
You're obsessed with Damien!
It's making you sick.

901
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,915
Give me the daggers.

902
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,711
Agh!

903
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:38,190
- There are your daggers!
- Ann...

904
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,510
I've always belonged to him.

905
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:49,875
Damien!

906
01:38:57,560 --> 01:39:00,313
Damien!

907
01:39:01,313 --> 01:39:11,313
