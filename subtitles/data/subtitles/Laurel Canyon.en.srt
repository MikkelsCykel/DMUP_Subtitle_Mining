1
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,940
Want me to stop?
No don't stop

2
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,340
Do you want me to keep going?

3
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,420
Yeah, keep going. Don't stop.

4
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,620
Yeah!

5
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,900
Ok, don't move. Don't stop.

6
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,180
Fuck me!

7
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,140
It's me, you don't need to pick up.
I know you are busy packing.

8
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,820
Just calling to say...hey..

9
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,900
I'm kind of in a situation here.

10
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,220
- What?
- I finished.

11
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,980
- You did?
- Yeah!

12
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,980
That was really good.

13
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,980
What about you?

14
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,260
Hmm... I'm fine.

15
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,700
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

16
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,340
- Alright.
- Yeah I'm good.

17
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,220
My mother asked about April again.

18
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,180
- Why is she so fixated on April?
- I'm sure it's economic.

19
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,540
I can't Lisa.

20
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,220
I know! She is probably just trying
to get a deal on rentals.

21
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,300
Like the June rush,
or something ludicrous.

22
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,060
You want to change the plan?

23
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,300
- No I don't. Do you?
- No.

24
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,740
I don't know why people
get married in June anyway.

25
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,340
I mean, what's
wrong with January?

26
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,860
I just never saw the reason to go
out there. It's disruptive in my opinion.

27
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,540
Alex should be here
to finish your dissertation,

28
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,420
and you should stay in Cambridge,
if you'll be practising here.

29
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,100
I'd rather be in Cambridge
absolutely, but the...

30
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,060
Houseman institute is the
best program in the country.

31
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,260
I think you should
reconsider psychiatry, Sam.

32
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,460
it is a feeble discipline.

33
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,940
If you're interested in brains,
get to the thick of it...

34
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,340
the grey matter.
That's honest medicine.

35
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,820
Why waste yourself
on the hopeless?

36
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,100
- So impressive Alex.
- The empty Aelons.

37
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,100
- It's a tremendous achievement!
- Getting a Ph.D.

38
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,820
- Well, I haven't finished it yet.
- Genemics, my God!

39
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,060
- Genomics.
- Right, of course, genomics.

40
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,180
How long are you staying
with your mother?

41
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,540
- We're not staying with her.
- Oh, I thought you were.

42
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,340
No. We're staying at her house.
But she's not living there now.

43
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,100
She's an executive, isn't she?

44
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,020
Not exactly, she's in the
entertainment industry.

45
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,940
She's a record producer.

46
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,980
That's right. Alex
mentioned that once.

47
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,380
Well, it seems you have
everything under control.

48
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,140
Definitely.
We've covered everything.

49
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,420
Think about my suggestion.

50
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,780
Oh, and take care of Alex, please.

51
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,580
We don't want her
joining the Scientologists.

52
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,860
Or the vegetarians.

53
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,500
- Can we leave?
- Yes.

54
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,100
You can't leave now,
we haven't had the cake.

55
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,540
- Beautiful!
- Thank you.

56
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,060
You're behind by 40-
you have to focus.

57
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,180
- I am focusing.
- No you're not you're distracted.

58
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,940
I just don't read the
dictionary, smart pants.

59
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,340
Can I get another juice?

60
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,380
Can I get another Scotch please?

61
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,500
I don't think you should worry
about it anymore, honey.

62
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,020
I didn't plan on
worrying about it at all.

63
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,220
It's not that much time.

64
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,740
Theoretically yeah.

65
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,300
I wish I had his ash.

66
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,180
What did she say, a wake?

67
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,340
She wasn't specific.

68
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,420
I don't know why you didn't
call the black girl back?

69
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,860
Neither do I.

70
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,140
She could have made
other arrangements, you know?

71
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,860
I know. I don't know why
I didn't call her back.

72
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,620
I should have.

73
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,980
47..

74
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,940
- Whose are the cars?
- I don't know.

75
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,980
- She is really weird.
- I know you told me before.

76
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,060
- I just want to reemphasize.
- Okay.

77
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,860
It's probably
developmental disorder.

78
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,860
Sam!

79
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,900
- Rarefied strain.
- Why are you telling me this again?

80
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,860
- I just don't want you to be surprised.
- It's temporary!

81
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,900
I don't want you getting upset.

82
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,100
Anyone is tolerable
for a few weeks.

83
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,260
Even the developmentally disabled.

84
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,700
Come on. I need to pee.

85
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,460
What time is it?
God!

86
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,460
Look at you!

87
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,740
Oh man, you
look great! Really!

88
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,060
So do you.

89
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,500
Sorry Alex,
this is Jane, my mother.

90
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,500
Hi nice to meet you.

91
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,340
Nice to meet you too, finally.

92
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,620
- It's a pleasure.
- Thanks likewise.

93
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,980
Hello I'm in,
one of the crew.

94
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,740
Ian, Dean, Rowan and Frip.

95
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,420
This is my son.

96
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,820
Sam. And...

97
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,460
- Oh... Alex.
- Alex, God I'm sorry.

98
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,940
It's lovely to meet you Alex.

99
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,460
As well you Sam.

100
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,060
Let's go outside for a second.

101
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
It's the shit I hate, you know.
I give them a gorgeous record...

102
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,180
...and they come back
when there's no single.

103
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,980
There's no thank you,
there's no congratulations.

104
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,980
Just go back in and find it.

105
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,740
Otherwise...

106
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,140
...I would not be behind like this.
I'm never behind like this.

107
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,580
Oh Jane,
You're always behind like this.

108
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,060
No I've changed.
Truly I have.

109
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,140
Take your time and finish
the record. And...

110
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,820
Stay in Malibu, alright?

111
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,020
- No you can't stay in Malibu.
- That's Ok. It's just a couple of weeks.

112
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,060
- It's Bobby's.
- What do you mean it's Bobby's?

113
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,660
- I gave the house to Bobby.
- You gave the house to Bobby?!

114
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,060
Just for a little while,
until he gets back up on his feet.

115
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,860
He doesn't have feet!

116
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,740
- Bobby's a basket case!
- No, I gave him a deadline.

117
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,420
Oh, I'm sure that
will motivate him.

118
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,540
Look it's complicated, Ok.

119
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,900
I feel a little guilty
about this one.

120
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,540
About what?

121
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,020
I left him.

122
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,260
- So you gave him the house?
- It was the right thing to do.

123
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,700
How can you break up with Bobby?
I thought he was the real thing!

124
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,540
Then I got to know him.

125
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,300
- What do you want to eat?
- Curry.

126
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,220
We're going for a bite.
Care to join us?

127
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,420
- No thanks, we're exhausted.
- No?

128
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,380
Our loss, another time.

129
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,300
See you Jane.

130
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,020
See you in the morning.

131
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,100
- Unless you want to...
- See you in the morning.

132
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,620
Nice to meet you.

133
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,300
They don't have a single.

134
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,460
I thought Sam would have
explained how thing get.

135
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,340
No, he just thought you'd be gone.

136
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,980
I mean finished.

137
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,660
It happens a lot in this business.

138
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,460
Things shift, plans change,
people get fired.

139
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,940
- Sure of course.
- Yeah what are you going to do?

140
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,740
Things shift, plans change,
people get fired.

141
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,020
Yeah we just hadn't planned
on a change of plan... so...

142
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,580
Well who plans
on a change of plan?

143
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,540
I mean, it would be sort of
paranoid. Don't you think?

144
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,060
Want something to drink?

145
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,380
- No thanks.
- Look.

146
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,900
I think you guys should stay
as long as you want.

147
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,020
Really, I want you
to be comfortable.

148
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,060
This has nothing
to do with you.

149
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,220
I'm really happy
to have you here.

150
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,500
- Want some?
- No thanks, I'm okay.

151
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,100
Sam?

152
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,100
She is so embarrassing!

153
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,340
She is fine.
She's amusing.

154
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,660
Oh yeah.
Like a menstrual show.

155
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,500
Come on...

156
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,940
She is a little odd.

157
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,140
Her presentation is a little odd.

158
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,540
- But I think she means well.
- I don't know what she means.

159
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,620
It's like the never half.

160
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,260
You made it sound like she
was autistic or something.

161
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,740
She is in a way. I mean she makes
the same mistakes over and over.

162
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,980
She is obviously very accomplished.

163
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,540
Yeah the irony of all time.

164
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,460
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry about?

165
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,140
Bringing you here.

166
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,340
I should have taken that
spot at Mass General.

167
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,980
Dad was right we should
have stayed in Cambridge.

168
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,100
- Stop it!
- I fucked up.

169
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,740
Why didn't you tell me
she was so successful?

170
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,180
I told you.

171
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,540
No you didn't. You hardly told
me anything about her.

172
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,220
- You hardly asked.
- That's not true!

173
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,300
- Sleep tight.
- Alright.

174
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,900
- You think Sam likes me?
- No, why would he?

175
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,780
There is nothing to like about you.
You are totally unlikable.

176
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,300
You bitch!

177
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,820
Come here.

178
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,700
Shit!

179
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,980
- I'm sorry, did I wake you?
- No.

180
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,740
I can't sleep lately,
my clock is fucked!

181
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,780
Hey you don't have to do that,
Carmela's coming on Friday.

182
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,180
No problem.

183
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,460
- Don't cut yourself.
- Hey, I got it really you're barefoot.

184
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,620
- Why are you up?
- I got to be at the hospital.

185
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,060
It's so early.

186
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,940
Yes, it's a real job.

187
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,660
- That's too bad.
- No, not so bad about it.

188
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,260
- We should spend some time together.
- Yes.

189
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,500
With Alex... She's sweet.

190
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,100
I think so.

191
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,260
Hey I got "Buck
seats at the Ball".

192
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,940
Maybe we could do that?
The four of us.

193
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,100
Get some wine, weed, chicken.
The weather has been fabulous.

194
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,780
I probably won't have time for
a while, but I'll let you know.

195
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,180
But thanks for the offer,
that sounds nice.

196
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,700
- That's your new guy?
- Yes.

197
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,300
- How is it going?
- Great!

198
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,380
He is a beautiful man.

199
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,100
I'm really happy.

200
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,020
We have a really
deep connection.

201
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,740
Probably deeper than
I've had with anyone.

202
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,260
- Even Bobby.
- Wow.

203
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,860
Didn't you have a deep
connection with that guy...?

204
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,420
- Randy?
- Randy?

205
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,900
Yeah Randy, the guy,
the roadie with the limp.

206
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,420
- Who toured with us when I was 12.
- Ronny.

207
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,700
Yeah I had a connection with Ronny,
but it wasn't particularly deep.

208
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,340
- What about Veronica?
- Veronica...

209
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,020
You got deep with her didn't you?

210
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,540
Veronica and I stopped having
sex after the third month.

211
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,380
Anyway...

212
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,660
Ian gets me, this is
completely different.

213
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,380
That's great.

214
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,180
That's great Jane.

215
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,740
Listen... Alex is

216
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,300
working hard on her dissertation.

217
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,580
I'd appreciate it if you could keep
it quite while we're staying here.

218
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,220
Just keeping doors shut and stuff.

219
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,460
I think she would appreciate it.

220
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,900
I want her to feel
comfortable here.

221
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,260
Yeah so do I.

222
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,300
The situation is kind of
foreign to her.

223
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,060
She is used to working
in a... lab or in an office.

224
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,780
Alone.

225
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,380
She is not used to
being around people.

226
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,980
She must get lonely.

227
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,020
Okay.

228
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,300
Come on Claudia, I'm not gonna slap
some bullshit together for a radio.

229
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,220
I don't work that way,
you know that.

230
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,020
I hear you babe, but there's a slot
open now, and we need to jump.

231
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,420
I got to have all my elements
in place for the holidays.

232
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,780
- We need to move units...
- Christmas?

233
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,500
Oh Claudia, please
don't take me there,

234
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,660
Please don't depress me. I couldn't
give a shit about Christmas.

235
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,940
Fuck Christmas

236
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,900
This isn't an action call,
you know what you've got.

237
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,340
Why are you up my ass?

238
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,740
See this is why
we get into trouble Jane.

239
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,580
And this is why you always
end up coming back to me.

240
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,700
God I love that woman.

241
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,900
- Where are we?
- 2 minutes.

242
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,980
Good. This is a locked
ward, obviously,

243
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,780
and these are the patients
in the locked ward...

244
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,580
...some of whom you'll be getting
to know intimately very soon.

245
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,140
I'm not stealing them!

246
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,020
Note my medication
is still missing.

247
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,620
No it's down your sleeve!

248
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,260
Sarah Gowlyn, second year
resident, extraordinary.

249
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,220
Meet the new recruits.

250
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,940
I think I'm bringing them down.
Tell them it's not so bad.

251
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,420
It's not so bad.

252
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,620
You see it's not so bad.

253
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,620
Alright. Onward.

254
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,860
Christmas. A limited universe,
depressing really.

255
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,980
- Increase the dose of Welbutrin.
- I'll increase the dose of Vicodan.

256
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,820
Move that, little lady in a track suite.

257
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,340
- Do you know what I think?
- I don't. I'm dying. Tell me.

258
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,820
I think I made a beautiful record,
and the cowards will notice last.

259
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,700
You are very deep.

260
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,340
- Do you think so?
- I do.

261
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,140
- When you're not talking.
- Fuck off!

262
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,540
- I'm sorry. Let me turn it down.
- No, it's fine, really.

263
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,300
So, what are you
working on upstairs?

264
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,860
- Excuse me?
- You seem extremely absorbed.

265
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,420
I'm writing.

266
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,220
- A novel?
- No, my dissertation.

267
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,940
Great. What's it on?

268
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,060
- What's it on?
- Do you have a subject?

269
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,780
- Specifically?
- Yes.

270
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,540
We went to university.
We can handle it.

271
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,300
The genomic determinants of sexual
behaviour in the drosophila fruit fly

272
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,460
and its implications
for Homo Sapiens.

273
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,060
Really?
The sex life of flies...

274
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:28,740
No, the reproductive
behaviour of the fruit fly.

275
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,300
Excuse me.

276
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,860
He didn't mean it, Alex.
He's got low self-esteem.

277
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,700
He had acne as a child.

278
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,420
You cunts!

279
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,580
There is not much in here.
we've been doing take- out lately.

280
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,940
That's okay.
Is there a store nearby?

281
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,820
- Why don't you join us
- No...

282
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,780
Seriously, Alex. You don't
have to be polite with me.

283
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,940
Polite isn't my thing.
I'm sure Sam told you that.

284
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,860
I wasn't being polite.
I should just get some air.

285
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,100
Air is good..

286
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,980
Always better than
a cocktail at this hour.

287
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,300
I'll let you listen to
the record some time if you want.

288
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,060
Sure.

289
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,580
I'd like to,
I'd like that. Thanks.

290
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,020
You'll be helping us out.
It's like a psychic sauna...

291
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,780
...in there at this point.
We're wasted.

292
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,620
Well, I'd love to listen but
I don't think I'll be much of help.

293
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,820
I don't really know anything
about popular music.

294
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,540
You sure do.

295
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,300
Anyone with instinct knows about
popular music. That's why it's popular.

296
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,260
You strike me as someone
with strong instinct.

297
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,420
I guess so.

298
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,500
But you know when you're repulsed
or when you're turned on, right?

299
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,700
I suppose so,

300
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,820
in general, I guess.

301
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,020
That's all that it is. Either
it pulls you in, or it leaves you cold.

302
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,580
So you want some?
It's great for the colon.

303
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,060
No, thanks.

304
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,020
They're definitely taking it?

305
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,420
Okay. Thank you.

306
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,780
Hi. I'm calling about the apartment.

307
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,620
Okay. Alright, thanks.

308
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,100
Everything alright?

309
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,020
Yes.

310
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,260
- What did you get?
- Food.

311
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,420
That's good timing,
I'm famished. Get on.

312
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,260
No, I'm fine.
I need the exercise.

313
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,460
You'll have a heart attack dragging
that load up the mountain.

314
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,140
No, I'm fine. Really.

315
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,980
Jane asked me to get you,
sweetheart. Get on.

316
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,660
I promise I won't tell your parents.

317
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,860
You really didn't have
to get me, you know. I'm fine.

318
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,420
Hold on to me.

319
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,580
Tighter.

320
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,060
- Where are you staying now?
- Up in Laurel Canyon.

321
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,620
It's just that the house that we're in
was supposed to be empty, but...

322
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,900
my mother is producing
a record there.

323
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,780
She went down
because she left her boyfriend

324
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,820
and she gave him
her beach house.

325
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,900
because...

326
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,460
Anyway, it's convoluting
and never interesting.

327
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,460
No, it's definitely interesting.

328
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,220
Really it's more a logistics
issue at the moment.

329
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,180
That was you in the car, right?

330
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,860
Yes. You almost killed me.

331
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,340
- Yes... I'm sorry.
- You should be.

332
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,940
It's unbelievable. Every call I made,
someone has was just having it.

333
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,300
It's fine, I'll stay here honey.
I don't mind.

334
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,380
But she's anywhere,
I mean, she...

335
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,380
she has no bounds
and you need your privacy.

336
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,220
She's not in my way.
I'm working in private,

337
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,540
- it's not a problem.
- What about the noise?

338
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,780
They're very respectful
when the door is closed.

339
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,900
- And when it is not?
- Well, then it's open.

340
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,540
- Can you hear them?
- No, not really.

341
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,140
"Nor really"? That
was a "yes", right?

342
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,340
No, that means "No, not really".

343
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,940
What are you doing?
I'm just trying...

344
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,580
...to work it on.
Just trying on.

345
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,980
- You are?
- Yeah.

346
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,620
- Okay. Can she pick you up tomorrow?
- Yes, she said she could.

347
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,340
- Okay. Then, I'll start looking.
- Good. That'll be good.

348
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,900
We should look in the Valley.

349
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,820
It's cheaper and quieter.
North Hollywood or something.

350
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,540
Hey, Mickey is here with us.
They are all here.

351
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,500
I'm not talking about work.
I have a band with me.

352
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,500
You don't need to go out.
We made tofu steaks.

353
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,540
- Oh, sorry we missed that.
- What have you got there?

354
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,900
Pizza.

355
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,900
Do you want some?

356
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,540
Delicious. Real meat.

357
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,300
- Whose girl is that?
- She's Rowan's baby. China.

358
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,940
Come here, you little brat.

359
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,860
Are you cold?

360
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,500
Meet my friend Alex.
Say hello.

361
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,580
- Wanna go with your dad?
- Yeah.

362
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,660
The dancer dad.

363
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,100
- I guess you two drink?
- Sure.

364
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,980
Hi. Is Sam there?

365
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,060
- Sugar?
- Please... Thank you.

366
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,100
I'm really sorry I woke you up.

367
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,300
I'm usually up before 6:00.
I overslept.

368
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,500
Good morning. Sorry.

369
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,940
- Shall we go?
- Alex made coffee.

370
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,380
- Do we have time?
- I think so. I drive fast.

371
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,580
Thanks for picking him up.

372
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,900
I wasn't expecting
to be apartment hunting.

373
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,180
- I mean, we weren't.
- It is not a problem.

374
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,740
I'm happy to.
It's right on my way.

375
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,340
- That's convenient. Where do you live?
- In the Valley.

376
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,700
North Hollywood.

377
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,420
- Why can't you stay up here?
- It's a little tight with everyone.

378
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,140
That's too bad.
It's really nice.

379
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,020
I'd sacrifice space
to be up here any day.

380
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,780
- Are you a resident?
- Second year.

381
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,620
- What do you do?
- I'm writing my dissertation.

382
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,460
- What on?
- Drosophila genomics.

383
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,180
She's an MD as well.

384
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,980
- Wow! That's very impressive.
- Not really.

385
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,020
- It impresses me.
- Thank you.

386
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,020
You must have a lot of patience.

387
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,020
I don't know, I couldn't imagine
analyzing data all day,

388
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,700
It seems so...

389
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,820
...tedious.

390
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,780
It's not meaningless at all.

391
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,460
I didn't say meaningless. Did I?

392
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,540
My English is terrible, I'm sorry.

393
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,740
I said tedious, I think.

394
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,900
Well, same difference.

395
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,740
But I didn't mean that. I meant...
I don't know the word...

396
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,540
Serious. That's all.

397
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,820
It's fine, sorry. I didn't mean to...

398
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,940
No, I'm sorry, really.

399
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,900
I didn't mean the "assault"...

400
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,700
insult. We should probably go.

401
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,500
Well, it was nice meeting you.

402
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,220
- You too.
- Bye.

403
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,100
- Your girlfriend seems nice.
- Yeah.

404
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,020
She was tired.
She is usually more...

405
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,140
She is usually different.

406
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,300
A double degree.
She must love school.

407
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,780
Yeah. She got through fast.
She's really smart.

408
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,740
Yeah, she must be.

409
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,340
- And ambitious.
- Oh yeah.

410
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,260
Top in our class actually.

411
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,380
- Really?
- Yes.

412
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,860
How can you compete with that?

413
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,180
Amphetamines.
"Ecstasy", generic, ice...

414
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,860
We're not sure what he took.
The vital signs still haven't stabilized,

415
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,700
I'll be around.
Page if you have any questions.

416
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,300
- Do you want to start?
- No, he's yours.

417
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,500
- How you doing... Wyatt?
- I'm fucked up, okay?

418
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,540
I got these Nazis in a parking
waiting to bang me,

419
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,420
- and I am trapped in here!
- Okay.

420
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,580
How old are you?

421
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,220
Eighteen.

422
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,220
- Do you have any family around?
- No, don't I have any family around!

423
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,620
Leave my family out of here

424
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,580
you paranoid Nazi,
freakin' up in a white coat!

425
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,220
- Leave my family out of here.
- Get me a 511, fast...

426
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,540
Wyatt, sits down.

427
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,180
Sit down.

428
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,100
What the hell is a 511?
What the hell is that?

429
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,260
Is that a fucking code?

430
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,260
Is that a prison code?

431
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,020
Is that a prison code?

432
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,860
Don't take me out!
Please, God!

433
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,340
Don't take me out!
Please, don't!

434
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,980
- Please don't take me out.
- It's alright.

435
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:41,220
I'm feeling a horse at the gallop.
The tempo's shit.

436
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,020
- Am I right?
- Yeah, it's shit.

437
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,100
No, no... Let's go into it.

438
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,020
It's gonna have texture,
you know like... like ooze.

439
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,380
sonic ooze.

440
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,580
Alright. Sonic ooze...

441
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,660
Okay baby, how about a horn insertion?

442
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,340
Perhaps "Tijuana Brass",
maybe. I heard Herb's in town...

443
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,300
No, let's not go patronising.

444
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,580
That's not patronising.
I was accommodating.

445
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,020
I was accommodating you.

446
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,180
Cause I'm a better
judge than you think.

447
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,940
Sweet. That's it,
That's the direction.

448
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,420
I've overplayed it.

449
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,060
No, it's not the bass. It's
how much you get straight on the beat.

450
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,420
- It should be faster.
- No, I know what she's doing. Sultry

451
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,540
She's going for romantic.

452
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,660
Is it that what
you're going for, Jane?

453
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,780
A love song?

454
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,940
Come on!

455
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,380
Let him go!

456
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,420
Those are mine.

457
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,020
- What are?
- Your tits.

458
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,700
You're such a prude.

459
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,220
Hello.

460
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,220
Hi.

461
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,020
- Am I interrupting?
- Absolutely not.

462
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,180
It is an unexpected pleasure.
We were just discussing romance.

463
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,140
Come on in.
Sit down, come on.

464
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,660
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

465
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,860
Have a good night.

466
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,780
I really start to love this.

467
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,060
But it's dated, you know?

468
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,220
It's not dated, we just wrote it.
It doesn't even have a date on it yet.

469
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,540
- Why are you so contrary?
- Cause you wouldn't respect me otherwise.

470
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,500
- Do you think so?
- Babe, I Know so.

471
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,980
I love a man who speaks his mind.

472
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,460
Even when it's bullshit.

473
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,380
Hey stranger.

474
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,420
Hey you.

475
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,740
What time did you
come to bed last night?

476
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,300
I tried to wake up you.

477
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,380
- But you didn't move.
- I didn't feel anything.

478
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,460
How did it go yesterday?

479
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,380
With the apartments.

480
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,340
Good.

481
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,460
What's established?

482
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,340
I saw some a few things.
Most of them are pretty disgusting.

483
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,620
I think it's gonna take some time.

484
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,660
I'm sure that there was something
perfect in here, just ready to rent.

485
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,820
- So, how was work yesterday?
- Strange.

486
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,580
I had to deal with a 16 year-old bastard
having an ecstasy-induced psychotic episode,

487
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,980
and he thought I was Nazi.

488
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,220
Ironic.

489
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,500
- And upsetting.
- Yes, he was pretty upset.

490
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,700
This one looks good.

491
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,420
- Which one?
- This house.

492
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,660
In the Valley, on Greenleaf.

493
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,380
Right there.

494
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,460
- Were you in the studio for a long time?
- Nor not too long.

495
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,580
- Just taking a break?
- Yes.

496
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,140
Did you get much work done?

497
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,740
I think I'm pretty close to finishing.

498
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,580
No, on your dissertation.

499
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,260
Yes. It's going very well.

500
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,300
- Did you enjoy yourself?
- Where?

501
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,980
In the studio.

502
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,140
Yes, I did, actually.
It was stimulating.

503
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,420
Gee.

504
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,540
I don't know how you two
just think of getting up so early.

505
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,300
It'd totally burn me out.

506
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,540
- Hello.
- Hi.

507
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,580
You're right on time.

508
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,340
He's friendly, he's a pussycat.

509
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,060
You see that? He likes you already.
Come on in, I'll show you the house.

510
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,740
I want you to take the gown
out of your bag, Gloria, and put it on..

511
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,660
This isn't appropriate for public.

512
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,700
You don't understand the naked.
Naked is intimacy.

513
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,300
I am here with you.
There is no shame.

514
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,780
There is no separation.

515
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,620
And...

516
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,180
... I am not ill.

517
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,460
Yes, you are ill Gloria.

518
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:42,500
And I have no need for a green synthetic
nighty used to conceal the essence

519
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,140
of my simple skin
and my aching soul.

520
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,180
in the barren desert that is this land.

521
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,660
I'm moving in with my son
in Costa Mesa.

522
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,020
He thinks I'm lonely.

523
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,860
The truth is, he's lonely.

524
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,500
Sweet kid, he just
can't seem to connect.

525
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,620
Me and my wife lived here 40 years.

526
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,340
It's lovely.

527
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,940
Really. It's really lovely.

528
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,260
You seem like a very nice person.
I Hope you take the place.

529
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,820
I don't know about trust.

530
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,220
Maybe she just needed a nap or something.

531
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,700
Believe me, she's been
belligerent with everybody else.

532
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,180
I dealt with her last year.

533
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,500
I just listened to her, really.

534
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,140
Well, listening
is better than medicating,

535
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,220
no matter what they tell you.

536
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,500
Can I tell you something?

537
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,740
Sure.

538
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

539
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,500
Hi, how are you?

540
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,100
- Fine thanks you?
- Fine thanks.

541
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,140
Did I leave you enough room?

542
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,660
Yes.

543
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,900
See you in the morning.

544
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,580
Another day at the office.

545
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,220
- All right?
- Hey. How you doing?

546
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,820
- Good. You?
- Okay.

547
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,860
Hey! Come on in the water.
It's delicious.

548
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,260
Maybe later. Thanks.

549
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,220
You're always welcome.
In fact more than welcome.

550
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:06,100
Obviously you're welcome.
It's your house.

551
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,860
I'm sorry.

552
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,980
It's not your fault.
Someone else got there first.

553
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,140
The house was gone.

554
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,220
It won't be the worst thing
to stay here a little longer.

555
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,140
It's comfortable.

556
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,020
Well, depends on
your definition of comfort.

557
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:34,860
I mean I'm hardly even here,
it's not for me. It's for you.

558
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,140
Is it?

559
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,980
- Can you give me some lemonade?
- I'll see at the some around.

560
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,020
- How did you sleep?
- I don't know.

561
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,820
Whatever you gave me,
it took me down.

562
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,500
I felt full drugged.

563
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,660
You were drugged.

564
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:08,060
- I don't like downers.
- No, you weren't liking the uppers either.

565
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,700
I told you not to call my house.

566
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,380
Look, I have to contact your family
while you're underage. It's the law.

567
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:19,140
My mom is gonna kick my ass.

568
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,900
I mean, she's freaking now, but she's gonna
torch my ass when I get out of here.

569
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,700
Why are things so wrong
with your mom?

570
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,060
I don't know.

571
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,020
You seem like you do.

572
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,780
She doesn't get me, alright?

573
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,660
She's in my face over my grades,
my hair, my friends, tattoos...

574
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,780
All that sort of shit, you know.

575
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,980
I can do nothing right.

576
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,540
So why should I care?

577
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,900
- Fuck!
- What?

578
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,780
- I missed a punch, fucked up.
- Mickey, sweetheart.

579
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,500
Could you just keep that
to yourself next time,

580
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,980
...let him play through?
Let me talk to him.

581
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,420
Sorry, that's not quite there
but that's the direction.

582
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,380
So it's okay?

583
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:18,540
We'll finesse it in the mix.
We'll make it work.

584
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,180
What do you think?

585
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,340
- Truthfully?
- No, lie to me.

586
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,620
Yeah, truthfully.

587
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,780
I'm not feeling it.

588
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,900
Not feeling it?

589
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,060
I'm sorry.

590
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,660
No, it's okay, don't apologize.
Just tell me what you mean.

591
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,500
I don't know what
I mean exactly. I just...

592
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,020
I mean I...

593
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,860
I guess it's just not pulling me in.

594
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,580
or it feels like it’s not pulling them in...

595
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,780
...exactly...

596
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,780
...or enough.

597
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,020
I don't know...

598
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,180
They I don't seem... inspired.

599
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,780
Inspired...

600
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,620
Progress report.

601
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,260
Excuse me?
"Progress report"?

602
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,100
no "hello, How are you?"
Jesus, Claudia.

603
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,820
you're really warming me up.

604
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:23,980
What?

605
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,820
I love capitalism as much
as the next guy, Claudia,

606
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,420
but this is off the tracks.

607
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:32,140
Your commerce has so fired my ass
I can't even sit up straight.

608
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:36,300
Listen Jane. The age of the queer is never
happening okay? Get real, this is commerce.

609
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,220
Honestly Claudia,
do good to your own soul.

610
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,540
Pushing for Christmas radio play
will never maintain anything

611
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,420
but a lot of shit
wrapped in paper. I promise.

612
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,620
I don't know what happened,
Jane, you know?

613
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,660
We used to be on the same pitch.

614
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,140
I don't know what happened either Claudia.

615
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,300
I guess you started exercising.

616
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,020
I gotta go.

617
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,820
Bitch.

618
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,460
Cunt.

619
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,140
Can we just say how
lovely Jane looks today?

620
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,380
Can we just have
a moment of appreciation

621
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,980
for our sweet, lovely Jane?

622
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,660
Get the fuck out of my chair.

623
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,500
I had a math teacher
in high school

624
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,900
who was sort of my mentor.

625
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:33,580
You know, I was one of those Science geeks,
my mother wasn't really around, so...

626
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,700
he took me under his wing and,

627
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,100
and he convinced me
that I should be a doctor.

628
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,820
which seemed
the right idea at the time.

629
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:47,260
- I guess I needed to prove myself.
- To who?

630
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:52,220
Who were you trying
to prove yourself to?

631
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,380
I don't know...
My math teacher.

632
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,740
Your math teacher?

633
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:02,420
You went through Harvard
Medical school for your math teacher?

634
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:07,300
No, I guess I was trying
to prove myself to myself.

635
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:11,340
You know, I needed to prove
that I wasn't a loser.

636
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,740
A loser? Why would
you think you were a loser?

637
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,860
I was around a lot
of losers growing up.

638
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:23,980
Not the worthless type
of loser, or bad person...

639
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,300
just lost,

640
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,260
people of loose hands.
I didn't want to be that.

641
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,780
I wanted to be anything but that.

642
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,260
You're everything but that.

643
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,460
I set up a meeting with his mom.

644
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,100
It's not protocol,
but I think it will help.

645
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,860
Is he still violent?

646
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,220
No, he was never violent.

647
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,620
I thought you had to restrain him.

648
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,740
No, I sedated him.

649
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,180
- Oh, I thought he was psychotic.
- Huh? No...

650
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,300
He had a psychotic episode.

651
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,220
He ODed on a methamphetamines group.
He's not psychotic in general.

652
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,340
When did you start reading
the "Spin" magazine?

653
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,100
I am not to reading it.

654
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,820
- Are you just looking at it?
- I'm skimming it.

655
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,100
Is it helping?

656
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,500
Yes, it is informative.

657
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:29,180
- how a spelling book?
- Yes, something like that.

658
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,020
Getting the basics.

659
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,940
a light survey
of popular culture.

660
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,180
- Are you teasing me?
- Yeah

661
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,220
Should I read the "Journal of Medicine"
or the "Harvard Review"?

662
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,180
Would that be more appropriate?

663
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,260
- Or something more scholarly?
- Oh come on, Al.

664
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,060
I was teasing.

665
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,420
I could have harassed you
about that porno magazines

666
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,060
but I didn't even bring it up.

667
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,220
Come on, I don't care
about the porno magazines.

668
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,300
- I just didn't know you liked jugs.
- Oh God.

669
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,220
- Sorry I don't have enormous breasts.
- Please stop it.

670
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,020
Your breasts are fine.

671
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,500
Your breasts are perfect.

672
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,420
Really.

673
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,860
Yes but who has had 72 lovers?

674
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,980
Where did you come up
with that number?

675
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,260
I am guessing,
from what you said.

676
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:38,460
I am 16 years older than you.
It's a lifetime of fucking.

677
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,180
And I'm not apologising.
My past isn't about you.

678
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,860
- That is cold...
- No, it's not, it's clear.

679
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,500
Will you keep me in my place?

680
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,580
I don't want to keep you anywhere.

681
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,260
You're free to move around.

682
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,900
But I'm not moving,
for your information.

683
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,140
You can keep working
in tough clothing, Jane,

684
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,780
but I know you're
madly in love with me.

685
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,540
That's irrelevant.

686
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:47,300
Okay. I'm tired baby, you know.

687
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:26,220
- You're up early.
- I know, I'm not happy about it.

688
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,460
Do you need some Valium?

689
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,860
I don't want to get
back in that shit again.

690
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,740
Yeah, that wouldn't be good.

691
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,100
Try swimming. Helps.

692
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,540
- So, how are you? How's work going?
- Good.

693
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,780
- Just not sleeping enough myself.
- I am sure.

694
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,660
- Hospital's been busy.
- Lots of psychos, huh?

695
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,980
No, just a lot of...

696
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,980
...pain souls.

697
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,180
Listen, I appreciate

698
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,460
your interest in Alex.
I meant to tell you that.

699
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,580
I really like Alex, I like
her a lot. She is smart.

700
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:08,300
I know I was a little protective of her
when we first got here,

701
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,780
I just wasn't sure how
she was gonna deal with...

702
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,540
...your scene.

703
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,420
I think she's dealing
just fine with my scene.

704
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,860
I think she likes it.
I mean, obviously...

705
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:21,140
She's getting stunned with you
and she's reading "Spin".

706
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,300
I don't read "Spin".
I've never read "Spin".

707
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:28,220
Look, she found her own way into
the studio. That had nothing to do with me.

708
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,020
Yes, it's always
like that with you, isn't it?

709
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,940
They always just happen
and find their way and...

710
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,860
What's that supposed to mean?

711
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,740
It means you're charming. That's all.

712
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,180
Someone's looking out for you.

713
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,860
And there ain't who's looking
out for you? I'm sorry, come on!

714
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:52,620
Your life is pretty good
from my prospective.

715
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:55,060
- Well, I worked for what I have.
- And I haven't?

716
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,540
You're so stuck on the negative.

717
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,180
- I'm not stuck on the negative.
- Yes you are.

718
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,180
It's like you've completely blocked
out all the fun we used to have.

719
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,780
I've not blocked it out.
It's all filed.

720
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,420
Hey, what about
the trip to Vera Cruz?

721
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,500
Yeah. When Ronny went to jail?

722
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,860
No, before that.
When we were on his boat.

723
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,860
In the storm? That was fun?

724
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,140
- That sucked!
- No it didn't, it was exciting.

725
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,140
and even you thought
it was exciting at the time.

726
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,500
I wasn't excited.
I was hysterical!

727
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:27,780
There's a huge difference
between hysteria and excitement.

728
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:34,460
Are we ever gonna
have a relationship?

729
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,620
We're having a relationship.
Here we are...

730
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,380
...having it.

731
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,100
Look, Ian has got
a room at the Chateau.

732
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:45,500
We could stay there for a while
and you'll have the place to yourself.

733
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,500
No, I think you should stay.
Alex's still looking for an apartment

734
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,420
and we need something
permanent anyway.

735
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:54,420
So just stay.

736
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,140
Why don't you ask her?
Maybe she wants to be alone.

737
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,380
I'm sure Alex wants you to stay.

738
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,860
I mean she can't stay
away from you as it is.

739
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,900
He's gonna give her a frontal lo.

740
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,700
No, he will give her Thorazine
and then lock her up.

741
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,660
I think she wants to be locked up.

742
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,580
Exactly.

743
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,660
...make your analysis

744
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:34,340
with three general patterns
of emotional response.

745
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,740
Rage

746
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,340
it is the response
to the primary stimulus

747
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,060
of thwarting.

748
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,700
- Should I be embarrassed for us?
- I am.

749
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,780
You're gonna have another?

750
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,140
I should probably go.

751
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,860
Come on, Golan.

752
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,980
How often do you get the night
and the morning off?

753
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,180
- I'd stay for another.
- Okay.

754
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,820
...is the emotional response to love

755
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,180
and usually the result of
a show of affection.

756
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,020
Tom, can I use your phone?

757
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,460
Yes, that's in there.

758
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,300
- We'll do very well together.
- Absolutely.

759
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,060
For a while.

760
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,340
Cannot you get
past your cynicism?

761
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:23,180
I've just broke up
with somebody, baby.

762
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,340
I thought you forgot all about it yet.

763
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,900
- Hello?
- Al?

764
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,940
- Who are you with?
- Just some of the resident.

765
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,260
I'd like to leave, but...

766
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,580
...Sara's driving and
I don't want to be rude.

767
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,860
Do you want to come down?

768
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,620
No, I'll see you
when you get home.

769
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,500
Alright.

770
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,940
You're ageist.

771
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,220
- That's what it is.
- Oh, please...

772
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,260
Then what are you afraid of?

773
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,340
Breaking your heart.

774
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,980
Running your ass
to the ground, buddy.

775
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:30,140
Why do you want to ruin it
with this domesticity?

776
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,500
Because...

777
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,020
...I've never met a braver woman.

778
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,180
I'm deeply, deeply attached to you.

779
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,940
Looks like we've got company.

780
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,500
How you doing, Alex?

781
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,140
- Okay, I think.
- Are you getting some work done?

782
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,060
No, not tonight.

783
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,580
- Where's Sam?
- Out.

784
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,860
- Without you?
- Well, I didn't want to go.

785
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,580
So pour yourself a drink.
Spend some time with us.

786
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,580
Yes, go get a drink
and come back out.

787
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,260
- Are you sure?
- She's sure, I'm positive.

788
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:30,340
Oh, I will have another whiskey sour
while you're at the bar.

789
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,100
So will Jane.

790
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:59,780
Cheers.

791
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,060
Tasty, huh?

792
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,220
It's a good combination.

793
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:13,740
You made it perfectly,
you could be a bartender.

794
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:20,020
- Want to come in?
- No, that's okay.

795
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:23,620
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

796
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,020
Oh, you've just
washed your hair...

797
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,380
- No, I haven't.
- So?

798
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:32,380
So, I just don't want to get wet.

799
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,980
Really?

800
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:37,260
- You seem like you do.
- Cut it out.

801
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:40,100
What? She wants to swim,
she's afraid to get wet.

802
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,820
I am not afraid.

803
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,220
You wanna have it!

804
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,300
Shit!

805
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,500
- I can't believe you!
- See what I have to put up with?

806
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:02,220
- It's not so bad, is it?
- That's freezing!

807
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,460
That's because
your clothes are wet, silly.

808
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,220
You really are a jackass, God!

809
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:11,300
No name calling now.
We're all adults here.

810
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:39,500
- That's better ain't it?
- That's definitely warmer.

811
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:43,260
I'd rather be in here
than out there in that cold world.

812
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,340
You're so polite, Alex.

813
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:51,100
It's okay to leave the ivory tower

814
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,100
and live a little.

815
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,900
Yes, I can drive.

816
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:01,540
- Are you sure you're not drunk?
- I am not. I drank less than you.

817
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,700
No, you did not.

818
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,620
Do you want to kill me again?

819
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,900
I didn't kill you
the first time, did I?

820
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:17,860
Goddamit, you're flustering me.

821
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,700
Turn it to the right.

822
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:22,860
- I know how to open a door.
- Apparently you don't.

823
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:26,260
- Didn't break up the lock?
- You should let me drive.

824
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,500
Get in.

825
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,020
Sara...

826
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:51,100
Yes.

827
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:56,260
I think we should
take the higher road.

828
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,540
And what would that be?

829
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,740
Sublimation.

830
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,060
Is that okay?

831
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,540
It's intellectual.

832
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,420
- I know.
- And not very honest.

833
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:24,700
And neither satisfactory.

834
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:27,220
Satisfying.

835
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:30,420
I think you know what I mean.

836
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:05,900
Al?

837
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,020
You up?

838
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:14,940
- You up?
- I am now.

839
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,620
Can we talk?

840
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:23,060
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

841
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:24,660
I'm just...

842
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,300
...wondering about something.

843
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:31,140
Okay.

844
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:37,900
Why does your father
hate psychiatrists?

845
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,660
He doesn't hate psychiatrists.

846
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,260
Okay. So...

847
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,900
- Why does he hate me?
- He doesn't hate you.

848
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:49,580
What are you talking about?
He thinks you're great.

849
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:54,620
Why are you so concerned about
what my father thinks suddenly?

850
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:56,500
He's a puritan.

851
01:05:56,660 --> 01:06:00,060
He quotes Proust and wears tweed.
He doesn't know anything about us.

852
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:05,420
Do you think that we should
have got married before?

853
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:07,900
Before when?

854
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:11,620
Before coming out here?

855
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,380
He runs along with low-class people,
spends all my money on drugs

856
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,940
and ends up in a mental hospital!

857
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:16,860
I'm so close to letting go on him.
I might give up my rope here.

858
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:20,580
I think that what's going on
with Wyatt is complicated.

859
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:24,220
and I don't think that your anger
is helping him with his problems.

860
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,980
My anger?

861
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,340
I'm not angry. I am furious!

862
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,620
Because it's all about me, see?
It's all about me.

863
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,740
I won't tolerate this disgusting,
degenerate behaviour,

864
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,460
and the disrespect for me
and my values, and what I stand for!

865
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,180
he/she hears, Mrs. Jones.

866
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:41,300
Give your values a rest for a second.
Your kid's in trouble.

867
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:02,740
May your shade be sweet

868
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,980
and float upon the lakes

869
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:19,940
May your shade be sweet...

870
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:47,940
Jesus, Claudia.
Gimme a fucking break!

871
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:53,100
No, my relationship with Ian
has nothing to do with this.

872
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:55,140
It's none of your business anyway.

873
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,540
No, it is not slowing anything down.

874
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,260
These conversations
are slowing us down.

875
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:08,220
I can't believe I'm hassled into this.
That was totally patronizing.

876
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:11,060
Claudia? It's Ian McKnight.

877
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:15,100
Lovely, thanks. Listen...

878
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,660
I don't know why you're so
fascinated with our sex life,

879
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,420
but for the record,
Jane's an amazing shag.

880
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,340
We're more to the point...
We're just about done with your "single",

881
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,780
and I'm sure you'll be orgasmic
when you hear it.

882
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,460
so let's give the telephone
a little rest, shall we?

883
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:32,420
- Cheers.
- Great.

884
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:36,460
You're a fucking diplomat.
This is it. It's going to hell.

885
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:37,900
Fuck her.

886
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,260
Who the fuck cares?
We'll take it somewhere else.

887
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,500
Okay. You hire a lawyer.

888
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,980
- That's all I wanna finish.
- What, with the lawsuit?

889
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:46,700
No, with that song.

890
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:49,060
- Which song?
- The song I've just played to you.

891
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,700
- It's a ballad.
- So what?

892
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,660
- Do you want me to hand them a ballad?
- That's right.

893
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:58,420
You're kidding, right?
Tell me you're fucking kidding.

894
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:00,740
I'm not fucking kidding.

895
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:02,860
Alex was right.

896
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,660
Alex was right...

897
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:06,780
The other song
doesn't pull you in.

898
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:09,260
It pulled me.
Pulled me right across the room.

899
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:16,660
I am serious.

900
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:19,380
- Is it about Alex?
- No.

901
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:23,020
Alex knows nothing about this,
She's into flies and domination.

902
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:24,700
Determinism.

903
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:27,300
- Ian?
- Jane?

904
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:29,660
Do you like it?

905
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:34,860
- Jane?
- What?

906
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:37,340
- Did you?
- Yeah.

907
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,060
I said I did.

908
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,860
Well alright then.

909
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,820
Let's just finish
the record, darling.

910
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,860
I can't stand to watch Claudia
wind you off any longer.

911
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:52,340
It's starting making me jealous.

912
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:16,180
I could look in your face

913
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,780
for a thousand years

914
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,580
It's like a civil war

915
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:31,020
of pain and of cheer

916
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,180
But if you were a horse

917
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:39,780
I could help you with your chains

918
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:44,100
I could ride you through the fields

919
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:48,420
by your fiery mane

920
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:58,460
May your shade be sweet

921
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,300
And float upon the lakes

922
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:07,860
where the sun will be

923
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:11,460
made of honey

924
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:15,660
I cried diamonds while you burnt

925
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:19,940
cause no one here can save you

926
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,980
Oh sorry. Excuse me.

927
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:26,020
Hello, Sam? Hold on one second.

928
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:29,860
Where?

929
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,220
No, I can't hear you.

930
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:38,020
There are a lot of people there?

931
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,300
Yeah, I guess like
fifteen, twenty or so.

932
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,180
Shrimp Cocktail
and something else.

933
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:50,300
No, I don't see any crab cakes...

934
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:54,140
- Do you want to come up?
- No I'd probably quit.

935
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,700
No, stay.

936
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,900
Yes, I am sure.

937
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:02,540
Okay, I will.
I promise.

938
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:10,900
- Were you trailing me?
- Maybe.

939
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,940
Why didn't you catch up to me?

940
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,700
Sara?

941
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:24,460
I was sublimating you.

942
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,740
You should not be in a band.

943
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,420
You might work in a bank.

944
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:55,100
I'm not usually
so aggressive.

945
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,140
I don't believe that.

946
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,340
I am not.

947
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:03,340
I just...

948
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,460
...I don't really know you.

949
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:09,900
I just feel connected to you. I feel...

950
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,300
I feel safe with you,

951
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,860
like it's okay to be honest.

952
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:19,460
It's just one of those things.

953
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:23,980
I'm just attracted to you.

954
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:28,660
And it's not just because
I think you're incredibly sexy.

955
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:39,940
I think that you're
incredibly attractive too, Sara.

956
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,820
You do?

957
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,580
Yes, I think about you.

958
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,820
Trust me.

959
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:52,460
A lot.

960
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,740
How do you think about me?

961
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:01,260
- How?
- Yeah.

962
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:05,420
Do you think about
having sex with me?

963
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:09,980
Yes.

964
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:12,140
How?

965
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:19,100
How do I think about
having sex with you?

966
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:23,540
Do you think about me
going down on you?

967
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,940
Yes.

968
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:32,740
- That's part of that.
- Me too.

969
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:37,180
I think about how you taste.

970
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:41,140
I'm sure you taste sweeter.

971
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,540
- Do you resist me?
- No.

972
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:49,300
- Do you give yourself over?
- Yes.

973
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:52,380
- Completely?
- Completely.

974
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:57,180
That gets me on.

975
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:59,820
You're easy.

976
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:03,300
No, with you I am.

977
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,540
So, do I get to...

978
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:12,500
...do I get to work
on you for a while or...

979
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:16,580
...or do we just fall asleep?

980
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,620
You can work on me
all night long.

981
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,740
I mean, you're with someone.

982
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:35,220
Why would I let myself
fall in love with you?

983
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:39,340
Oh, I'm like... just
an object to you? Just like

984
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,060
a piece of ass?

985
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:44,380
- Just looking to get laid?
- Yeah right.

986
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,660
God... you're like a girl.

987
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:52,020
Thanks. That's really flattering.

988
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:54,940
It is. Maybe that's why I like you.

989
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,580
You're having a sexuality crisis?

990
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,940
No.

991
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,500
I am not having any kind of crisis.

992
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,860
You're lucky, do you know that?

993
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:12,980
I don't know that.

994
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,140
Why am I lucky?

995
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:21,340
You can control your heart.

996
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:59,060
- Thanks for coming, Darla.
- Good night. Thank you.

997
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,500
- Sounds amazing.
- Thanks.

998
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,860
- I'll get the rest by this week.
- Yeah, no problem.

999
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:06,140
Good-bye.

1000
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:22,260
Hello? Yeah, it's Ian,
in the penthouse.

1001
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:24,820
We need another bottle
of Chateau Marmont.

1002
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,180
Sorry... Dom Perignon.

1003
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:29,500
Cheers. Thank you.

1004
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:44,420
I heard it's more comfortable inside.

1005
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:29,500
I think it's one
of the best records I've done.

1006
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,580
I know it's the best
records you've done too.

1007
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:35,700
I didn't say "the best".

1008
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:40,660
- She said "the best", didn't she?
- I think she said "the last".

1009
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:44,140
You see?

1010
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:46,740
You save the best for last.

1011
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,020
I know it's not the last.

1012
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:57,660
Don't go.

1013
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:02,180
- You should get some sleep.
- We never sleep.

1014
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:12,900
Why have you got
your clothes on?

1015
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:15,820
What are you talking about?

1016
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:18,140
You look so much better
with them off.

1017
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,100
Come on.

1018
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:30,660
We have been
entertaining you for a while.

1019
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,060
So why don't entertain us?

1020
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:40,460
What do you want me to do?

1021
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,540
Finish it.

1022
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:57,060
Look... you give her an inch
and she takes a mile.

1023
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:39,140
I think we should stop.

1024
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,340
Babe...

1025
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,180
Come on... not now.

1026
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:49,940
Sorry.

1027
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:52,060
No, you're right.

1028
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:54,460
I didn't...

1029
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:56,420
Sorry.

1030
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:01,060
Can I talk to you for a second?

1031
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,620
You should be with her if you wanted.

1032
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:11,140
I don't want to be with her.
I want to be with you.

1033
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,380
- I want you to be with her.
- I can't be with her.

1034
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,940
- Why not?
- She's Sam's girlfriend.

1035
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,780
So what? They are about to break up.

1036
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:22,500
I mean, it's obvious.
She's throwing herself to us.

1037
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:25,060
I don't know if she's throwing
herself, but I can't do it.

1038
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:37,100
Look... I've done the worst shit in my life and
I'm glad I have, because I've enjoyed 99% of it,

1039
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,380
but I'm not gonna screw my son's girlfriend,

1040
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:42,340
I'm not gonna lay there
and watch you do it either.

1041
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:44,300
Who's gonna know?

1042
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:48,180
I'll know.

1043
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:01,580
Why it took you so long?

1044
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:03,060
Sorry.

1045
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:04,980
I was squashing the grapes.

1046
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,420
It's back here.

1047
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,260
- Is everything alright?
- Yeah.

1048
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:22,420
Sort of.

1049
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,060
Put it there.

1050
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:26,940
No worries.

1051
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,780
Is this the party?

1052
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:38,460
What are you doing here?

1053
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,220
You're a sick pig, you know?

1054
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:44,060
Look, nothing...

1055
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:46,380
You're a fucking greedy punk.

1056
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,460
Okay mate. Slow down.

1057
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:51,060
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- Sam, stop it!

1058
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:56,820
Stop it!

1059
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:01,980
Jesus Christ, Sam! Stop it!

1060
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:06,140
What are you doing?

1061
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:08,580
What am I doing?
What the fuck were you doing?

1062
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:11,460
Are you alright,
darling? Oh, shit!

1063
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,140
It is not what you think it is.

1064
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:17,220
- You're so lost your shit!
- It's not her fault! It is my fault!

1065
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:18,020
No, it is my fault.

1066
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:20,020
Well, that's not my fucking fault!

1067
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:35,300
You're not getting
away with this.

1068
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,340
- I'll get away!
- Shutting me up!

1069
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:40,300
For Christ's sake! You're gonna
reduce it, tonight? Get some therapy,

1070
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:42,220
Finally, please, get some help!

1071
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:44,700
- You should get some therapy!
- I'm not the one who needs it!

1072
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:47,260
- That is exactly your problem!
- My problem?

1073
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:49,580
You're unbelievable!
This is why I'll never come back here again.

1074
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:51,540
There is always something
out of control with you,

1075
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:54,860
You're like a 2 year-old,
like a fucking mismatch!

1076
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:57,180
How did you get to be so rigid?

1077
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,540
At least I'm living in reality.

1078
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:01,180
- At least I have some dignity!
- Dignity?

1079
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:05,140
- Jesus! Why you are so afraid?
- What are you talking about? You're insane!

1080
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:07,980
Jane? I'm sorry. Can I
ask you to step outside?

1081
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,900
Fuck you, Phillip.

1082
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:13,620
- I'm sorry. Can I get you some ice?
- Yes!

1083
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:21,180
I know, I know...

1084
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:24,580
It was my fault.

1085
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:27,140
It just happened.

1086
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:29,140
Things like these don't just happen!
You've just got out of the bed with her!

1087
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:32,740
- I didn't sleep with her. I just kissed her.
- I don't want to hear the details!

1088
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,660
I don't know what happened.

1089
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:36,500
I got caught up.
I got confused.

1090
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:38,660
Confused?
Psychotic is more like it!

1091
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,340
I didn't think.

1092
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:42,380
I didn't think...

1093
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:44,860
- I had never learned...
- Learned what?

1094
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:47,140
- This.
- This? What is "this"?

1095
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:49,060
How to fuck up!

1096
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:51,220
Oh you've fucking
mastered it out of the gate!

1097
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:53,260
It didn't mean anything to me!

1098
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:55,460
I don't want them!

1099
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:57,540
I don't feel anything for them.
I don't want them.

1100
01:27:57,660 --> 01:27:59,540
I don't want either of them.
I Want you!

1101
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,620
I want to be with you,
you fucking asshole!

1102
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:03,380
You fucking stupid fucking asshole!

1103
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,860
Stupid asshole? I'm fucking
keeping this together!

1104
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:09,900
I'm trying to keep this together.
I Wanna make it right!

1105
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:07,620
- How you doing? Right?
- Yeah, okay.

1106
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:13,740
I wanted to apologise.

1107
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:16,500
No, we finished with
that sorry business already.

1108
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:19,580
I'm sorry for getting you
into this situation.

1109
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:21,740
You didn't get me into anything.

1110
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:24,380
I got myself into whatever I got into.

1111
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:27,300
I was just curious about you.

1112
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:29,220
And I about you.

1113
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:31,860
You're the least likely person
in the world for me.

1114
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:34,380
- Are you insulting me now?
- No.

1115
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:37,300
No, not at all.

1116
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:40,020
Oh, a compliment...

1117
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:44,500
I think you helped me.

1118
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,980
Okay, positivity.

1119
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:52,260
You helped...

1120
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,300
...opening me up.

1121
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:57,660
I would have opened you up
further if I'd had it my way.

1122
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:01,140
- That's disgusting.
- No, not really. It's honest.

1123
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:05,260
- You should look in your manners.
- I know.

1124
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:07,380
I am trying...

1125
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:09,100
Believe me.

1126
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:37,020
I want to tell you something.

1127
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:42,700
Alright.

1128
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:53,340
It doesn't matter
who's right or wrong.

1129
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:57,420
I made mistakes.
A lot of them, I know that.

1130
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:00,420
I deal with them every day.

1131
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:06,020
But I think the hardest thing I'll live with
really, is knowing how much I disappointed you.

1132
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:12,620
I haven't been
a very good parent.

1133
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:16,780
I know that.

1134
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:19,820
I fucked up.

1135
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:25,860
But I've always loved you.

1136
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:31,380
You're my baby. man.

1137
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:00,100
Yeah... I see he's pooling...

1138
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:07,620
You've got a lovely accent, Sara.
Very compelling.

1139
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:10,060
Where are you from?

1140
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:15,380
What a coincidence.
I'm eating a "bagel" right now.

1141
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:17,660
I know.

1142
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:21,780
It's Sara, from Israel, for you.

1143
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:30,020
Hi.

1144
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:33,700
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

1145
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:38,940
I'm just taking
a mental health bath.

1146
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,900
Oh. How is your mental health?

1147
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:46,660
Haven't quite gotten on mine yet.

1148
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:50,100
I'm still dealing
with everyone else's.

1149
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:54,860
It is not true
the thing you said last night.

1150
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:57,820
The thing I said last night?

1151
01:32:58,580 --> 01:33:00,900
The thing about my heart.

1152
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:02,980
It's not true at all.

1153
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:06,380
I can't control my heart.

1154
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:08,820
I mean...

1155
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:12,860
...I wouldn't want to, even if I could.

1156
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:37,860
Sara?

1157
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:45,660
- Can I call you right back?
- Yeah.
