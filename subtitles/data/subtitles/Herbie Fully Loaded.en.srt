...little car takes first...
and third place!

2
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,614
<i> A lot of Herbie fans
here today wearing Herbie's colors. </i>

3
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:12,854
- What the heck happened to you?
- I'm sorry, Crazy Dave.

4
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,487
I had a few problems getting
this critter on the truck.

5
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:20,156
Please. I've blown
bigger things out my nose.

6
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,699
Prettier too.

7
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,066
What was that?!

8
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,941
I wouldn't insult him
if I was you. He's sensitive.

9
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,606
- He's a car.
- Yeah, I know.

10
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,207
It's that he's proud.
That's all I'm saying.

11
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,583
The shed I got him out of
was just full of these old trophies.

12
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,849
I think he used to be a racecar.

13
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,187
A racecar?

14
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:51,162
Yeah. You know, I bet it took
first place at the Ugly-anapolis 500.

15
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,931
Oh! Oh! Oh, ow!
What did...?

16
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,605
It wasn't the car!
All right.

17
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,369
Just be calm.
I don't have to take this.

18
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,812
This is just a car...
an inanimate object.

19
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,416
Oh...

20
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,042
Are you kidding?

21
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,110
It just leaked all over my shoe!

22
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,679
Just get this thing
off my truck!

23
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,659
You are so in the crusher. Push!

24
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,670
Come on!

25
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,024
Come on!

26
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,061
Ahh! Whoa!

27
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,230
Whoa!

28
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,278
Oh!

29
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,275
Oh...

30
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,688
I'm... just gonna...

31
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,925
- I got to go!
- Hey! Hey, you...

32
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,147
All right. Listen up, car.

33
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,277
No one makes a fool
out of Crazy Dave.

34
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,685
No one.

35
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,484
Consider yourself crushed!

Congratulations.

42
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,130
I've seen some photo finishes
in my time.

43
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,691
That was cutting it close.

44
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,363
OK, Dad.

45
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,430
Getting dizzy.
Oxygen deprived.

46
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,032
Your mom would be so proud.

47
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,509
You're the first Peyton
to graduate college.

48
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,274
One where you don't
have to keep a toolbox at the end.

49
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,407
- Where's Ray?
- Running some laps.

50
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,646
We got a qualifying race.
He's working on some problems.

51
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,846
Like not crashing?

52
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,650
Mag-Wheels!

53
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,026
Check out what mom and dad
got me for graduation.

54
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,391
Oh, great. Rub it in.

55
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,262
4.2 V-8, right?

56
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,700
V-8, what? I don't know,
but it's adorable!

57
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,204
Promise you'll look
after Maggie in New York.

58
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,369
- We'll be roommates for 15 minutes.
- An assistant producer job at ESPN.

59
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,378
You'll be in front of
the camera in a heartbeat.

60
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,038
Have a great time in Paris.

61
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,572
Bye. Be back in a month.
I'll spring you from Riverside.

62
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:35,246
<i>We'll cruise to the Big Apple
and start our new lives. Au revoir!</i>

63
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,491
I promised your brother we'd
meet him at the track. We got to go.

64
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,858
Do I even get
a graduation lunch?

65
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,792
Well, this isn't quite
what I had in mind, but...

66
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,868
Hey, I sprung for the churros.

67
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,200
Dad, is Sally
still sponsoring you?

68
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,604
One of the proud, the few.

69
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,838
Hey, guys!

70
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,245
- Congrats on the ESPN job!
- Thank you.

71
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,547
I thought Maggie might swing
some free publicity over there.

72
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,213
Only publicity Team Peyton
needs is to win a race.

73
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,746
We're turning this thing around.
I know it. Believe me.

74
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,299
Aw, come on, Ray.
What are you doing?

75
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,766
Ray, what...?

76
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,039
Ow.

77
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,244
Ray, you were just
pushing the right front.

78
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,256
Was that what it is?
Did you learn that in college? Thanks!

79
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,122
- At least he loses with style.
- He's sure had enough practice.

80
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,328
I can't believe
Trip Murphy won Daytona.

81
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,235
He's a loser.
A well-paid loser.

82
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,239
Hey, Ray,
the guy's a great racer.

83
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,276
Say what you want about him.
He has excellent focus.

84
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,368
Focus.

85
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,978
You drove past that tree
on purpose.

86
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,284
- No. We're taking a shortcut.
- You were gonna chop it down.

87
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,950
We tried to knock it down
by crashing a car into it...

88
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,017
Oh, wait! That was you!

89
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:26,758
Oh, right. I'm not the one
who crashes into walls, am I?

90
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,130
Don't let him get to you.
The important thing

91
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:32,728
is when you see that tree and this town
in your rearview mirror,

92
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:36,366
you know you're on your way
to a better life. Right?

93
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,433
- Right.
- All right.

94
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:07,072
Now you, Gramps, had style.

95
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,398
He sure did.

96
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,769
Listen.

97
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:16,542
I'm sorry I didn't really pull out
all the stops for graduation.

98
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,880
It's OK. You know,

99
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,044
that was always
Mom's department.

100
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,022
It's been ten years.
I should have more of a clue.

101
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,759
I didn't know the team
was doing so badly.

102
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:33,059
Maggie, it's a bad streak.
We'll pull out of it.

103
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:38,467
But I do think it's time we find room
for you up on that wall.

104
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,402
That ought to do it justice.

105
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,749
- Night, Dad.
- Night, baby.

106
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,045
Tomorrow morning, getting you
a graduation present.

107
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,489
It's OK. I really
don't need anything.

108
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:02,550
I want to. First thing,
bright and early, you and me.

109
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,755
- You get to pick it out.
- OK.

110
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,855
- Good night.
- Good night.

111
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,540
Dad, uh,
what are we doing here?

112
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,209
Buying you a car.

113
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,516
I appreciate the gesture,
but I'm only here a month.

114
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,523
You don't want me chauffeuring you
around for a month.

115
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,455
Happy graduation, Magpie.

116
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,260
Hey, Dave!

117
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,973
Wow. A stock car.

118
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:39,115
One lap to go. Maggie Peyton
is about to make NASCAR history.

119
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,183
She's going! She's going!

120
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,262
She's done it! Unbelievable!

121
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,733
She's the first female driver
to take the Nextel Cup! Wow!

122
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,701
Hey, Maggie!
You find anything yet?

123
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,674
- Not yet, Dad! Still looking!
- OK, honey.

124
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,710
- What do you think, hon?
- Nothing calls out to me.

125
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,914
Now, trust me.

126
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,821
There's a certified
pre-owned champion out there

127
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,450
waiting to be discovered.

128
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:52,429
A car with the guts, the character,
the heart of a thoroughbred.

129
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,135
Dad! It's perfect!

130
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,907
OK, just think,
if this horn hadn't gone off,

131
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,778
I wouldn't have found
this Nissan!

132
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,647
Hey, Maggie.
What about this guy?

133
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,953
These are great. Take care
of the engine, they run forever.

134
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,085
- Doesn't really need anything.
- It's cute.

135
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,162
But, Dad...

136
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,330
How much for the Nissan?

137
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,961
Good eye. Good eye.

138
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,063
We've had a lot of interest
in that car this week. But, um...

139
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,505
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

140
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,307
Since you are
the first customer today,

141
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,473
I think I can
cut you a deal.

142
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,513
Hmm.

143
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,317
I'll give you 50 for the Bug.

144
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,757
Sorry, no can do. See...

145
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:59,457
I always felt there was something
special about that car.

146
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,328
I wouldn't sell
in a million years.

147
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,267
- Seventy-five.
- Oh, sold!

148
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,395
I'll make out the papers.

149
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,141
At least we know
the horn works.

150
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,771
OK, Mags.
Tires are good.

151
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,711
Gas is good.
Brakes are good.

152
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,274
Look at that. The speedometer
goes up to 200 miles an hour.

153
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,185
Somebody's got
a sense of humor.

154
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,281
All right, now. Come over
to the garage later.

155
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,349
Have Augie
take a look at it.

156
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,190
Thank you, Dad.

157
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,474
"Please take care of Herbie.

158
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,816
Whatever your problem,
he'll help you find the answer. "

159
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,920
Great.
A fortune cookie on wheels.

160
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,184
OK, let's start slow.

161
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,303
What are you doing?! Stop!

162
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,641
This isn't funny anymore!

163
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,416
Come on, car!
You're a car! I drive!

164
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,113
What is going on?

165
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,983
Oh, my God! No!

166
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,862
- Oh, God...
- Oh, my God.

167
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,496
I'm so sorry.
Let me help you.

168
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,140
Are you OK?

169
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,648
- Maggie?
- Kevin?

170
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,815
God, you look great.

171
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,850
I mean, it's great to see you.

172
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,327
What are you... I haven't
seen you since high school.

173
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,127
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I just got this car.

174
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,998
My dad wanted to get me
something for graduation.

175
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,843
Didn't you used to drive cars
with a little bit more, uh... muscle?

176
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,005
This car is not for racing.
It's for regular driving.

177
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,480
- For show.
- Yeah.

178
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,708
Oh, man.

179
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,847
You know what? It's not worth it.
I'm gonna take it back to Crazy Dave.

180
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,360
- Good to see you, Kevin.
- Yeah, good to see you.

181
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,325
Hey, Mags.
I could fix it for you.

182
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,865
Oh, no, that's OK.

183
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,028
No. That's what I do.
Kevin's Custom Car Shop.

184
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,662
- Nothing too fancy.
- No. Just the basics.

185
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:31,004
We'll take him for a test drive,
see what we got to work with.

186
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:34,239
- Sorry for almost running you over.
- Don't do that again.

187
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:40,885
Whoa! Whoa!

188
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,615
OK. All right. Easy, Mags.

189
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,892
- Smooth ride.
- Sorry.

190
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,758
Do you know where we
could get some new shocks?

191
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,424
Uh... There's a car show
at the Fairplex.

192
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,297
We could borrow parts
from the Hernandez brothers.

193
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,698
Yeah, I'm not really up
for that whole scene.

194
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,865
What? You used to
tear it up there.

195
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,568
Well, I mean, that was then.

196
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,975
Besides, this bucket of bolts
couldn't make it down there.

197
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,913
Whoa!

198
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,714
That's the Maggie I know!

199
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,156
What are you talking about?
I'm not doing this!

200
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,420
What'd you say?

201
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,227
OK, Mags!

202
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,269
Oh, my God.

203
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,908
It has more horsepower
than I expected.

204
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,413
Are you kidding me?
He just took off.

205
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,780
- He?
- Herbie!

206
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,785
OK, the car's name
is Herbie?

207
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,787
It wasn't my first choice.
Name came with the car.

208
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,154
Let's strip it down,
get rid of old parts.

209
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,092
- Maybe there's something to salvage.
- Works for me.

210
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,323
Go easy, Mags... Herbie.

211
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,630
What are you doing?

212
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,635
- Steering wheel's jammed.
- Left.

213
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,001
I can't turn it!
It's jammed!

214
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,802
OK!

215
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,775
OK! Easy!

216
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,778
Great. I'm being
carjacked by my own car!

217
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,930
OK. Watch the people.
Easy, easy.

218
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,659
Oh! That's the e-brake.

219
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,234
That should be
connected to something.

220
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,702
Oh, good.
They have valet parking.

221
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,762
Oh, man!

222
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,935
Sorry.

223
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,479
What are you doing?
You didn't want to come.

224
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,412
I didn't! It was Herbie!

225
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,109
That's funny, Mags.

226
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,446
"It was Herbie. "

227
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,085
- Hey. Where are you going?
- What?

228
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,558
- I'm so sorry.
- Her bad.

229
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,629
<i> Step away
from the vehicle. </i>

230
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:05,754
Maggie!

231
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,957
- What's up?
- What's up? How are you?

232
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,769
Pablo, Pancho.
Hey, what's up, guys?

233
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,068
- Hey!
- Hello!

234
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,075
- You look good!
- Yeah, what happened?

235
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,440
Thanks, guys.
Great to see you too.

236
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,070
Hey, is that your car?

237
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,377
No. No.

238
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,043
No, no. I don't know
whose that is.

239
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,246
Good thing,
'cause that thing is ugly!

240
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,495
Hey, Trip!

241
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,930
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

242
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:54,138
<i>Nextel Cup Series champion,
Trip Murphy!</i>

243
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,750
I hope you don't mind
I crashed your party.

244
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,551
When I'm in the
middle of a race,

245
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,752
swapping paint with
Dale Earnhardt, Jr. And Jeff Gordon,

246
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,384
you know what keeps me going?

247
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,757
It's you guys.

248
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,354
My fans.

249
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,433
And now, I'm going to give you
that same experience

250
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,734
in your very own living rooms.

251
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,365
Crash? What have you got for me?

252
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,708
Oh, wow. You guys
are in for a real treat.

253
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,373
It's my new video game.

254
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,477
"Trip Murphy: Undefeated. "

255
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,321
All right.

256
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,919
<i>You got a Sports Illustrated
shoot in an hour.</i>

257
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,194
No sweat. I'll do two laps.
Keep the Sharpies handy.

258
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,202
And when women give you
their numbers, get photos.

259
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,329
I don't want
a replay of Phoenix.

260
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,839
- I do enough charity work already.
- OK.

261
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,569
Can I get your autograph?

262
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,013
Trip! Sign my head.

263
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,311
Yeah. Yeah!

264
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,578
Whoo-hoo!

265
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,449
Yes! Trip Murphy signed my head!

266
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,649
- Where are you going?
- Anywhere but here.

267
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,355
I'm not gonna be
embarrassed again.

268
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,964
What about the car?

269
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,829
Crazy Dave can keep his cash.
I'll stick with my board.

270
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,062
You can't just leave it here.

271
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,765
Hello? Look around.
Somebody will take it.

272
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,923
What is with this car?
Like it's trying to embarrass me...

273
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,508
Look at this.

274
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:09,376
Some guy named Maxx
left these in the trunk...

275
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,915
You look great.

276
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:15,544
You got a tiny little spot
on your shirt. What happened?

277
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,249
- You're gonna change into those?
- Stand guard. No peeking.

278
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:22,555
Don't flatter yourself.
"No peeking. "

279
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,968
Oh. Hey.

280
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,174
- Oh, good. It fits. All zipped up.
- Let's go.

281
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,911
- Wait. Where are the keys?
- Uh, they're in the...

282
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,713
Oh!

283
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,718
Oh, whoa. Take it easy, guy.
All you gotta do is ask.

284
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,724
I'd wear a helmet too
if my ride looked like that.

285
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,928
Oops.

286
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:10,438
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- Good idea, loser.

287
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,445
Get this car back to the circus
before Bozo puts out an APB.

288
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,444
Ha-ha. Good stuff.

289
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,196
Oh, my God!

290
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:36,029
OK. OK, OK!

291
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,433
What are you...?
Take it easy.

292
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,571
Oh...

293
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,471
Oh!

294
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:52,114
Ohhh! Oh, dude!

295
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:58,215
- What did you do?
- I swear to God, I did not do that!

296
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,258
OK, try telling that to him.

297
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,263
Race! Race! Race! Race!

298
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:06,990
Trip! You gonna take that?

299
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,588
Race, race, race!

300
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,533
I can't race. Get out there
and tell them I'm sorry!

301
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,628
I love that I have
to do this. Sure.

302
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,697
'Cause Trip and I
have such a good rapport.

303
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,970
Race! Race! Race!

304
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:22,741
What have I got to lose?
It's a Bug.

305
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,746
Open.

306
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,449
Oh, my God! Kevin!
Kevin! Help me!

307
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,084
Kevin! Kevin!

308
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,561
Mags! What are you doing?

309
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,122
Kevin!

310
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,336
What is going on?
I don't want to race!

311
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,179
Kevin! Kevin!

312
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,322
Race, race, race, race!

313
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,263
What are you trying to do,
you crazy little car?

314
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,462
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

315
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,705
OK. So that's
how you want to do it?

316
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,333
I thought you said
you hadn't been racing.

317
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,709
- That was unbelievable!
- I know. Unbelievable.

318
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,179
Hey, Trip.
What do you say?

319
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,281
Get that camera out of my face!

320
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,481
Did you see me
come off that guardrail?

321
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,751
I saw... I don't know
how you did that.

322
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:30,259
All right. This is gonna
sound strange, but it wasn't me.

323
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:31,919
I think it was Herbie.

324
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,498
Herbie is a car.

325
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,796
You always said
they had personalities.

326
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,769
Yeah, personalities.
They're not possessed.

327
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:44,207
I can't explain it, but when Trip
blocked me on that final turn,

328
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,438
I wished I was on my skateboard
so I could rail-slide past.

329
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,504
Then Herbie did it.
It was like we were connected.

330
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,847
That makes perfect sense.
Cuckoo!

331
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,510
What are you doing?

332
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:59,580
Checking to make sure exhaust fumes
haven't gone back inside the car.

333
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:03,593
Kevin, I beat the reigning
NASCAR champion in a '63 Bug!

334
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,993
- How else do you explain that?
- How about,

335
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,327
you're an amazing racer
and proved it?

336
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,492
Why are you
afraid to admit that?

337
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:16,268
You beat Trip Murphy, on your own,
with this... hunk of junk.

338
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,363
Ow!

339
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,173
Hey. Admit it.

340
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,546
It felt great to be
behind the wheel again.

341
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,549
Yeah. It did.

342
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,281
That's what I thought.

343
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,399
The family's been
in racing for 40 years.

344
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,834
I won't let guys in suits
tell me what to do.

345
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,237
- These guys pay our bills.
- What do they know about racing?

346
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,298
They know not to back
a losing team!

347
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:59,044
- Another sponsor bite the dust?
- They come, they go.

348
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,415
That's business.
You got in late last night.

349
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,284
Let me direct you to the date
of birth on my license.

350
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,983
Let me direct you to the
address on that license.

351
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,184
My house, my rules.

352
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,747
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, Sally.

353
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,612
Hey, Sal. Don't tell me
you're pulling out too.

354
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,710
No. I'm making your day.

355
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,448
You're gonna love this.

356
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,819
<i>Taking the sports world
by storm. </i>

357
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:44,055
<i>Here it is again. 
Our exclusive footage of Trip Murphy</i>

358
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,962

359
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,556

360
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:53,797
<i>The competition was
a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle. </i>

361
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:57,329
<i>That's right, folks. 
A '63 Bug. </i>

362
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,281
I'll be back. Dad!

363
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,374
What did I do?

364
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:20,295
I sense you're looking
for an explanation.

365
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,766
You promised,
no more street racing.

366
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,668
Listen to me.
I almost lost you once.

367
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:31,072
- I'm not gonna let that happen again.
- At least let me explain first.

368
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,973
OK, go ahead.
I'm all ears.

369
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,443
I ran into Kevin.

370
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,276
Kevin? You aren't
in town 24 hours,

371
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,875
and goofy Kevin talks you
into street racing again.

372
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,580
Maggie. Do you think
I busted my butt

373
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,349
to put you through school

374
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,085
so you could get back behind
the wheel of a racecar?

375
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:55,063
- Dad, I wasn't even driving.
- Who was?

376
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:59,194
It was Kevin's friend, Maxx,
who was driving.

377
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,636
They wanted to challenge Trip,

378
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,836
so I let them borrow the car,
and it was a one-shot deal.

379
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,376
Promise?

380
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,851
I mean, yeah. Yeah.

381
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,488
Sorry.

382
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,493
I'm sorry too.

383
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,831
Whoever this Maxx guy is,
must be pretty good

384
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,705
if he beat Trip Murphy
in a little thing like that.

385
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,334
Not bad.

386
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:12,474
Life's a Trip.
Then you drive.

387
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,534
- Cut.
- I nailed that one.

388
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,671
I agree. I'd love
to try one more.

389
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:20,114
- It doesn't get much better than that.
- OK. Moving on!

390
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,118
- Can I talk to you?
- What is it?

391
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,812
The sponsors are all over me,

392
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,947
and the ESPN special
is down the drain

393
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,548
because you banished
the film crew.

394
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:33,029
- I won't talk about yesterday.
- I'm not. I'm talking about tomorrow.

395
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,588
This is your future.
Those people paid for it,

396
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,192
- so get your head in the game...
- I can't deal with this, Larry!

397
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,201
Good hustle, everybody.
Good hustle.

398
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,192
It doesn't make any sense.
How could that thing beat me?

399
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,732
Nobody cares about
a stupid street race.

400
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,099
I care. I'm a Nextel Cup
Series champion

401
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,639
who got beat
by a Volkswagen Bug.

402
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:19,403
Yes. You're a champion
on the track, where it counts.

403
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:22,844
This is nothing! The reporters
get some laughs out of it.

404
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,883
By Thursday, everybody
will forget it happened.

405
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,215
I've been up all night
going over this race.

406
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,755
I outclassed him on every front.

407
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,928
- I want a rematch.
- Aw, jeez. Trip, no.

408
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,932
It's me, your brother.
Forget it.

409
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,094
A two-day racing event
where I beat all comers

410
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,832
and then destroy
that little Bug.

411
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:52,933
I want posters at every garage,
body shop and auto parts store,

412
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,478
and full-page ads
in the local rags.

413
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,946
How do you know
this Maxx guy would show up?

414
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:01,143
Maxx is a racer. He'll show.

415
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,651
I'm gonna exterminate this Bug.

416
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,473
Hey.

417
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:29,010
Where you been? Look at this.
I want to show you something. Huh?

418
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,279
2180 engine.
Dual Weber carburetors.

419
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,046
Front, rear swing axles.
Pretty sweet, huh?

420
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,485
Yeah, they're, um... Wow.

421
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,217
You really put
a lot of thought into this.

422
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,886
There's potential in this car.
We can turn him into a champion.

423
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:48,432
It'll take work, but, uh, there's
a race in Lancaster in a few weeks.

424
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,990
Whoa. Hold on a second.
The other day was great.

425
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,095
I don't know how it happened,
but it was a fluke.

426
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,436
You loved being
back behind the wheel.

427
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,908
Yeah, I did, but now
I'm moving to New York

428
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,104
and I'm starting a new life and...

429
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,044
How are you gonna
move to New York,

430
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,310
a city where you take
a subway to work?

431
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,511
Listen, I told my dad
no more racing,

432
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,213
and I ended up lying to him.

433
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,314
The last time that happened,
I ended up in the hospital.

434
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:17,157
Note the vicious Afterschool Special
cycle I'm trying to break here.

435
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:20,890
- I need cash for my apartment.
- Those are the classifieds.

436
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,989
Listen, Kev, I'm really sorry.

437
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,568
I know, I know.

438
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,599
What about Herbie?

439
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:36,113
I guess I'll drop off the keys
and the number to an exorcist.

440
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,248
What?

441
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,687
Maggie, what happened?
Are you all right?

442
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,797
I know what you're thinking.

443
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,835
It's one race, Mags.

444
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,632
One race, ten grand.
That's a lot of cash.

445
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,435
OK. We'll split it.

446
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:07,772
You got rent money to pay.
I got this dump to fix up.

447
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,279
Everybody wins.
What do you say?

448
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,410
Maxx?

449
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,134
Come on, Herbie.

450
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,978
Hey!

451
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,283
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

452
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:30,655
Yeah!

453
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:24,147
I have been over every inch
of this model ten times.

454
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,546
I've run all the tests.

455
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:31,520
There's no way an ordinary VW engine
like this could have smoked yours.

456
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,723
There's nothing ordinary
about this Bug.

457
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,463
I don't know what
it's got under its hood,

458
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,198
but I intend to find out.

459
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,409
Those guys
always use you

460
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,250
to get me to do something.

461
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:11,386
You can't let them drop us.
It'll break Ray's heart.

462
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,022
No. It's gonna
break your heart.

463
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,998
When are you gonna
open your eyes?

464
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,557
Ray Junior
is not cut out for racing.

465
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,833
I have held out
as long as I can.

466
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:25,467
Bass Pro is dropping you.
I'm sorry.

467
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,876
Wait a minute, Sally.
Wait, please.

468
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,643
Tell them to hold on
until the Speedway races.

469
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:41,919
If Ray doesn't place,
I'm out. I close up shop.

470
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,620
I'll sell motor oil.
I'll do something.

471
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,369
How long you been standing here?

472
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,931
Long enough.

473
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,937
I sure am glad
you're not part of this.

474
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,842
At least I did
something right.

475
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:45,688
Why do I feel like we just got
sentenced to five to ten?

476
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,747
I'm gonna go sign us in.

477
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,293
Maggie Peyton.

478
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,894
Haven't seen you in a long time.
Who you here for?

479
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:04,236
- "In-the-way Ray"?
- Actually, I'm sponsoring Maxx.

480
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,106
So, do you like the makeover?

481
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,352
You can take the car
out of the junkyard, Maggie,

482
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:25,361
but you can't take
the junkyard out of the car.

483
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:28,762
- How do you know this Maxx?
- Um, we go way back.

484
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:32,825
I'd like to meet him.
Can you arrange a face-to-face?

485
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,996
He's meditating.
Getting in the zone.

486
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:37,437
Sure. Pressure's getting to him?

487
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:41,035
- He's not worried. He beat you once.
- Beginner's luck.

488
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:44,603
You tell that to yourself at night
in your Trip Murphy pajamas?

489
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,047
Look,

490
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:50,553
you tell Maxx I'm really
looking forward to the rematch.

491
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,852
Oh, hey.
Sorry, big fella.

492
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:56,984
I'm so sick of all
this Trip Murphy cra...

493
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,460
Geez.

494
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,791
Hey. See you later, Trip.

495
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,766
I don't know
if I can do this.

496
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,165
Time to suit up, Maxx.

497
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:14,844
<i> Race fans,
please welcome our own Trip Murphy. </i>

498
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,951
We've got 200 names up there.

499
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,080
By the end of the day,
there will be only one.

500
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:30,559
- Yeah!
- And that driver will face me,

501
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:33,289
and have a chance
to win $10,000.

502
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,896
Let's race.

503
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,658
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

504
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,001
<i>today's winner goes up
against Trip Murphy tomorrow!</i>

505
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:57,581
Herbie!

506
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,653
Vroom, vroom!
Let me hear you say "Hey, yo!"

507
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,198
What a day.
The real wild card here

508
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,928
is the enigmatic racer
known only as Maxx.

509
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,799
Questions abound.
Who is Maxx?

510
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,499
Where did he come from?
What's with the helmet?

511
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,801
Gotcha, Maxx.

512
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:03,613
I've signed so many autographs,
my hand is numb.

513
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,881
Guess who wants an interview.

514
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,594
How'd you get over here?

515
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:26,795
What's wrong?

516
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:32,301
Wow. Maggie, you...
look amazing.

517
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:35,709
I mean, you know, for someone
who changed in a Port-A-Potty.

518
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:38,907
Come on. I know there's
a compliment in there somewhere.

519
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:41,075
I think I'm losing my mind.

520
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:42,981
That was my first reaction.

521
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,749
And then I embraced
the mystery that is Herbie.

522
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,222
She's too young for you.

523
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,521
I got to tell you...

524
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,532
...winning definitely suits you.

525
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,526
Oh, I got you something.

526
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,200
It's stupid.

527
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,041
It's for luck tomorrow.

528
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,103
It's amazing.

529
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,756
Evening.

530
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:24,021
I hardly recognized you
without your camera crew.

531
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,790
I decided to give them
the night off.

532
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,322
Can we talk?

533
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:32,490
Alone?

534
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,764
- You OK?
- Yeah.

535
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:41,806
Your driver did pretty well,
for an amateur.

536
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:46,781
But he's got some serious flaws.
Take his car, for instance.

537
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,943
The chassis's too high, and...

538
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:51,748
...the aerodynamics
are all wrong.

539
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:55,188
Thanks for the tip.
I'll pass it on to Maxx.

540
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,749
You know what I
can't figure out?

541
00:49:57,861 --> 00:50:00,193
Why you're not
behind the wheel.

542
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:03,323
I hear you were a heck of
a street racer back in the day.

543
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,925
- Ancient history.
- I doubt it.

544
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,300
It's in your blood.

545
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:10,169
Your grandfather was one
of the greatest drivers

546
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,730
to ever hit the track.

547
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:13,435
He's why I got into racing.

548
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:18,880
And I gotta believe it's
hard-wired into your DNA.

549
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,713
Your dad ought to get Ray out of 56
and put you behind the wheel.

550
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:26,220
How many women drivers
have won a NASCAR championship?

551
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:30,089
Well... It only takes
one person to blaze a trail.

552
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:34,593
Ever think that you might be
the next great Peyton?

553
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:39,827
Thanks for the props,
but I gotta go.

554
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:43,066
You want to see how it feels
behind the wheel of a real car?

555
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,278
Are you serious?

556
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:53,077
I doubt your old man is
gonna make you the same offer.

557
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,443
Go on.

558
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,577
It'll be our little secret.

559
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,065
OK, Bug.

560
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,664
Let's see what makes you tick.

561
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,647
There's no way you could
beat me with this engine.

562
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,316
Ooh!

563
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,573
You want a piece of me?!

564
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:12,785
Who's laughing now?

565
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,841
Huh?

566
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:52,595
- That was unbelievable!
- She's a pretty sweet ride.

567
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:54,687
I've never driven
anything like it.

568
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:57,528
That was my most awesome
driving experience.

569
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:00,399
Amazing what
a real car can do, isn't it?

570
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:03,837
I got a little proposition.
Why don't we raise the stakes.

571
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,465
My car for your car.

572
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:09,069
Let's make tomorrow's race
for pinks too. Huh?

573
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:12,205
I don't know. I mean,
Herbie's really special.

574
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:16,013
Come on. Nobody's gonna
take you seriously in that thing.

575
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,544
Now, if, uh,

576
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:22,557
you drive home
in Trip Murphy's stock car,

577
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:26,289
your dad would be an idiot
not to put you on the team.

578
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:29,093
What do you say? For pinks?

579
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:34,696
All right.

580
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:45,139
You just better hope your boy Maxx
is on top of his game tomorrow.

581
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:57,785
Ray, if you drank all the
orange juice, I'll kill you.

582
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:01,388
- Mag-Wheels!
- Charisma!

583
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,627
- Why aren't you in France?
- Ugh! Paris was a drag.

584
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,192
I couldn't understand anybody.
And hello!

585
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,670
Learn to pick up
after our poodles.

586
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:12,731
I thought I'd come back to start
our road trip early.

587
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:16,245
Slight problem. I promised
I'd meet a friend in the desert.

588
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,214
Why? Are you burying a body?

589
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:22,581
No, he's in a racing tournament.

590
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:26,315
You think you're clever,
but I see through you.

591
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:27,447
You can?

592
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:29,684
It's obvious.
You're dating him.

593
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,351
OK, if you say so.

594
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:35,364
Don't be coy. What's his name?
Is it serious?

595
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:40,028
Maxx. You know, we're so close,
it's like we're the same person.

596
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:42,697
What are you doing?
Where have you been?

597
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:46,503
In a nightmare where my dad,
brother and best friend showed up.

598
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:49,601
Well, you got a new problem.
Herbie's freaking out.

599
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,170
I don't know what to do.
Stop it!

600
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:57,345
Did you leave him alone
with Trip?

601
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,820
Hey, Maggie!

602
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,957
- Who's that?
- Keep her away from my dad.

603
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,927
And she thinks
I'm dating Maxx.

604
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:08,623
Just don't ask me to explain.

605
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:11,098
Five-minute warning.
Get suited up.

606
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:13,965
And have a heart-to-heart
with your car. OK?

607
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,299
Yeah. Sure.

608
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,705
- Where you been?
- Excuse me.

609
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:21,141
I'm Kevin!
You must be Charisma, yes?

610
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,441
- Good to meet you.
- I just came back.

611
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:27,472
- I had the worst time...
- Herbie. What's going on?

612
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,781
I don't have time for this now.
We need to beat Trip.

613
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,847
Just get a grip. You're a car.

614
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:37,222
You do what I tell you to do,
all right?

615
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:48,699
Boo!

616
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,933
<i>It's winner take all at the</i>

617
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:52,975
<i>Trip Murphy
Sudden Death Showdown. </i>

618
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,670
<i>Maxx decimated
his challengers yesterday,</i>

619
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,737
<i>but now he's up against
superstar Trip Murphy!</i>

620
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:04,481
<i>And now here comes Maxx
and Herbie to the starting line. </i>

621
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:20,201
Blow his wheels off, Maggie!

622
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,669
I mean, Maxxie!

623
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:55,099
Come on, Herbie!
He's pulling ahead!

624
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,339
That's it, Herbie.

625
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,426
Come on!
I want that stock car!

626
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:30,630
What?

627
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:31,833
Oh!

628
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,984
Stupid car!
You blew this on purpose!

629
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:51,822
You were supposed to help me!

630
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:55,524
The voice is more high-pitched
than I might have imagined.

631
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,431
Come on, Maxx.

632
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:01,698
Take off the helmet and show
everybody who you really are.

633
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:16,282
- It's a chick!
- That ain't a chick! That's Maggie!

634
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,351
I guess I was wrong about you.

635
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:22,857
You're not the next
great Peyton after all.

636
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:26,418
You're just another amateur
who choked in the clutch.

637
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:39,632
Mags! Maggie.
Hey. Hey, come on.

638
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:40,767
Come on. Stop this.

639
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:42,674
You had a bad day.
That's it. OK?

640
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:47,409
Come on. Let's get out of here,
take Herbie back to the garage.

641
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:51,111
- There's always another race.
- There's not. Kevin, it's over.

642
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,848
I should have never done
this in the first place.

643
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,049
That's...

644
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:07,100
- Hey. Whoa. Get away from him!
- Hold it, buddy! Take it easy.

645
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,900
- OK. All right! Easy!
- Wait a minute.

646
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:12,703
- Maggie didn't tell you?
- What?

647
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,039
We were racing for pinks.

648
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,842
It was a little deal we made
after I let her race my car.

649
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:24,077
She said it was
the best ride of her life.

650
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:32,695
Please tell me
you didn't do that.

651
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:38,062
Look, Kevin, I'm sorry.
OK? I'm sorry.

652
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,625
Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to Herbie.

653
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:42,637
He's the one
you stabbed in the back.

654
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:58,212
- How could you lie to me?
- I can explain.

655
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,050
Your word
used to mean something.

656
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:02,421
I thought I taught you honesty.

657
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,289
Guess I was wrong.

658
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,986
- Dad, wait!
- I'm through listening, Maggie.

659
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:19,004
- Don't hurt him!
- It's a car!

660
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,813
Payback time, Bug.

661
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:50,767
I can't believe you were pulling
a Racer X on everybody.

662
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,570
I thought this was
a conversation-free ride.

663
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:55,270
We've been friends for years.

664
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,676
I've never known
the real you until today.

665
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:58,906
A lying backstabber

666
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:01,449
who alienated
everyone she cares about.

667
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,281
You don't get it.
You were awesome out there.

668
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,615
Why go to New York?

669
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,156
You belong behind
the wheel of a racecar.

670
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:11,523
- Grab the wheel!
- What are you doing?

671
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:12,686
Sorry.

672
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:15,595
Look, I'm really excited
about this new career.

673
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:18,065
Are you going to be happy
to report the story

674
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:20,102
rather than being one yourself?

675
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,702
Trip, we need to talk.

676
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:34,207
Amateur hour's over.
I've got a real race to prepare for.

677
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:35,944
I want to buy Herbie back.

678
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,748
- Herbie?
- The Volkswagen.

679
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:41,415
Oh, yeah, the Bug.

680
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:45,051
I'm sorry. I'd like to help you,
but you're a little late.

681
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:47,995
Crash just took him out
for a little spin.

682
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,964
Trip, what did you do
with him?!

683
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:53,593
Ten cars enter! One car leaves!

684
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:56,900
Ten cars enter! One car leaves!

685
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:59,999
Ten cars enter!
One car leaves!

686
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:02,909
Ten cars enter! One car leaves!

687
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,880
Ten cars enter!
One car...

688
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:17,392
Yeah!

689
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:33,432
Ten cars enter!
One car leaves!

690
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:37,172
<i>Drivers! Are you ready?</i>

691
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:38,611
<i>Get set!</i>

692
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,945
<i>Let's go!</i>

693
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,998
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

694
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:57,828
- Drivers only.
- No, wait.

695
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,097
You don't understand.
That's my car out there.

696
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,401
Well, now, you parked it
in the wrong place.

697
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,638
My name's Jimmy D.

698
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:12,578
This here's my place,

699
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:15,014
and that there car
belongs to me.

700
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:16,641
How much to buy him back?

701
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:19,778
If he comes out
of this thing in one piece,

702
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:22,551
I'll just give him back
to you free. How's that?

703
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:56,384
Whoo! Monster trucks rock!

704
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:02,391
I'm gonna wipe that Bug
off my windshield!

705
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,471
Don't just sit there!

706
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:17,746
Do you work out?

707
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:20,509
Yeah, actually.
My gym's six miles from here.

708
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,743
Go, Maggie!

709
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:37,297
- What are you doing?
- Sorry!

710
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:45,102
Come on, Herbie.
I can't lose you. We're a team!

711
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:53,679
I need you, Herbie! Come on!

712
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:59,181
Oh, come on, Herbie.
Don't do this. Please!

713
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:10,124
That's it. Come on, Herbie.

714
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,723
You can do it!

715
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,450
I didn't do that.
It was the car.

716
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:33,955
- His name is Herbie.
- That's a ridiculous na...

717
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,754
OK, Herbie.
Let's get out of here.

718
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:19,963
Yeah!

719
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,565
Oh, come on!

720
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,543
Jerk!

721
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,994
Go, Herbie, go! Come on!

722
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,393
Yeah!

723
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:50,864
There we go!

724
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:59,474
All right! Hang on, Herbie!

725
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:14,021
Pile driver!

726
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,305
Thanks, buddy.

727
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:02,400
What...? What...?

728
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:05,201
Ahh!

729
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:10,467
Oh...

730
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:13,174
Look, I don't care if you
ever speak to me again,

731
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:15,046
but you have to help Herbie.

732
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:17,108
What happened?

733
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:20,246
I was a jerk. I know.

734
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,215
Me too.

735
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:26,920
- You weren't a jerk.
- No, I meant...

736
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:29,259
I also know you were a jerk.

737
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:37,735
What are you gonna do about ESPN
and New York and the big time?

738
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:40,331
I met someone
who made me shift gears.

739
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:42,502
You know,
get a new perspective.

740
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:50,602
We're down to the final few spots
to see who gets into the big race.

741
01:09:50,637 --> 01:09:52,487
We're down to the final few spots
to see who gets into the big race.

742
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:55,056
One lap to go for
Ray Peyton, Jr. In the 56 car.

743
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:56,419
It's gonna be close.

744
01:09:56,492 --> 01:10:00,553
Let's see if Ray Peyton, Jr. Can qualify
for Sunday's Nextel Cup race.

745
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,290
Come on, Ray!

746
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,105
Whoo! Yeah!

747
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:19,808
Oh, my God.

748
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:36,292
Peyton. To the right.

749
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:39,232
- He needs to be transferred.
- Ray, you OK?

750
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:41,292
I'm fine. I keep
telling everybody.

751
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:45,272
Can we please get out of here?
I'm fine! Jeez!

752
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:49,875
I guess that means
he's not totally fine.

753
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:51,412
No.

754
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,005
- Come here, Ray. Come on.
- Ow!

755
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:56,050
Doc, I'm fine.

756
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:59,348
- Look straight ahead.
- I see it. It's...

757
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:00,854
Now it's bright.

758
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,187
There's a problem
with his left eye.

759
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,591
His depth perception is off.

760
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:09,097
We won't know the extent
of the problem until we run tests.

761
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:11,530
Bottom line,
he can't race Sunday.

762
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:19,367
Dad, I'm sorry.

763
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,810
Hey. It's not your fault.

764
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:26,746
You ran great today.
I'm gonna go see the doctor.

765
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:27,975
Wait a minute, Dad.

766
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,380
I still qualified.

767
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:32,079
All we need is another driver
and we got a shot.

768
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:37,624
Let Maggie race.

769
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:43,497
Yeah, Ray.
It's a good idea.

770
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:46,557
I mean, Team Peyton
needs this race.

771
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:48,933
She's ready, sir.
She's really good.

772
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:55,937
No. That's not gonna happen.

773
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:57,342
Dad!

774
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:01,514
Dad, I'm sorry
I lied to you, OK?

775
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,585
But all I've ever
wanted to do is race.

776
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:06,712
You're not getting
behind the wheel.

777
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:10,155
Because I'm a girl? I've had
one crash. Ray's had dozens!

778
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:11,817
It's different!

779
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,953
The only difference
is your support!

780
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,429
What's really your problem
with me racing?

781
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:24,164
Because you're the
spitting image of your mom.

782
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:30,305
And... I can't lose her twice.

783
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:35,242
Dad, I may look like her
on the outside,

784
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,649
OK, but on the inside, I'm you.

785
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,220
I'm a Peyton.

786
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:41,915
Racing is in my blood.

787
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,719
Please, let me race.

788
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,053
I can't.

789
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:50,730
I'm sorry.

790
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:00,706
I got it. OK.

791
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:02,869
All right. Fine. Bye.

792
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:12,042
I have bad news. I just got off
the phone with my supplier.

793
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:15,988
They're not gonna give me parts
until I pay my overdue bills,

794
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:20,154
- which you need money to do.
- So you can't fix Herbie?

795
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,719
I...

796
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:37,869
- Shouldn't you be in bed?
- Mags, I'm not blind.

797
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:41,780
I just can't race.
But you can.

798
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,977
You're taking my space tomorrow.

799
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,951
Well, wait. What about Dad?

800
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:49,252
Dad always says
I should be a team leader.

801
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:52,885
I called rest of the crew.
They agree. You're the one.

802
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,593
Look, we got a lot to do

803
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:02,398
if we wanna get my car
ready to race.

804
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:05,702
There's one car I'm gonna drive.
He's sitting over there.

805
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,637
You serious?

806
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:11,736
I race in Herbie,
or I don't race at all.

807
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:14,242
I'm with Trip Murphy,
Nextel Cup Series champion.

808
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:17,039
The prevailing wisdom
in the press box

809
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:20,377
is that your only worry is you
don't have enough shelf space

810
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:22,178
for a fourth championship.

811
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:24,514
Tell the boys
thanks for the support.

812
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:27,521
But it's a tough track.
It's a 500-mile race.

813
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:30,057
There are some
competent drivers out here.

814
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,252
Jeff Gordon's a decent driver.

815
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:34,522
There's an outside shot
he could win.

816
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:36,655
I guess what
I'm saying is, it's a...

817
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:39,599
...long race and anything
can happen in this sport.

818
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:57,274
We love you, Trip!

819
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:01,384
I thought you told me
you destroyed that car.

820
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:05,290
- I'm sorry, dude.
- Hey, Trip.

821
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,987
I know you're gonna win,

822
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:09,929
but on the microscopic chance
she beats you again,

823
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,523
I've set up a Slim-Fast
"Big Loser" campaign.

824
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:13,898
So there's that.

825
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:19,206
- He's mad at me.
- He's mad at me.

826
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:21,970
- Hates me.
- He hates us both.

827
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:25,013
- Never seen a Bug with a spoiler.
- Don't touch.

828
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:33,917
Soft top on a racecar.

829
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:36,389
- I like that.
- I like that.

830
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:42,889
- This car just winked at me.
- A racecar winked at you.

831
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:45,297
I swear. The car winked at me.

832
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:47,858
Are you feeling OK?
Is it the pressure?

833
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:50,496
I'm fine! Fine.

834
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,632
No problem. I'm telling you,
it just winked at me.

835
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:58,774
- Hey, Kev.
- Hey.

836
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:01,338
- Could we get a second alone?
- You and...?

837
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:03,509
- Herbie.
- Of course. Hey, guys.

838
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:07,146
Ray? Augie? Let's give
the lady some space, huh?

839
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:09,223
- Sure.
- Thanks, guys.

840
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:24,394
You nervous?

841
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:29,704
It's good to be nervous.
Keeps you alert.

842
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:36,307
I just want to say,
in the spirit of honesty,

843
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,580
I did total a car once
when I was racing.

844
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:42,113
That was a long time ago.

845
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:47,693
Hey, um...
Thanks for not giving up on me.

846
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,759
All right.

847
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:55,496
Ready to do this thing?

848
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:01,601
Cool. Let's show them
what we got.

849
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:57,990
Here we go, Herbie.
This is it.

850
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:01,695
- Maggie Peyton. Is that right?
- That's what I've got too.

851
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:05,331
<i>So it's Maggie Peyton
in #53 for Team Peyton</i>

852
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,807
<i>in a last-minute ruling
by race officials. </i>

853
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:10,470
What? Come on.
You've tried to think of a way

854
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:12,308
to sell gear
to women for years.

855
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,382
<i>It says she calls
the car Herbie. </i>

856
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:16,940
<i>I've never heard
of a VW Bug racing NASCAR,</i>

857
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:19,179
<i>but Team Peyton
found a loophole. </i>

858
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:21,346
- Go, Maggie!
- What are you doing?

859
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:23,890
You go, girl! Whoo!

860
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:28,287
Go, Maggie, go!

861
01:19:40,675 --> 01:19:44,577
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,
rise for our national anthem. </i>

862
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:18,068
Here we go.

863
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:27,681
- Go get 'em.
- Thanks.

864
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,684
Is this what you dreamed
it'd be like?

865
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:36,220
Yeah. I mean, I wanted my dad
here cheering me on, but...

866
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:39,392
Yeah. There's something
I want to say to you.

867
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:42,197
I guess
I underestimated you guys.

868
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:49,737
Good luck out there today.

869
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:51,870
Thanks, Trip.

870
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:55,678
Word to the wise:
It gets pretty nasty out there.

871
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:59,754
Uh, Trip, we got a race.

872
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:02,346
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Don't listen to him.

873
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:05,517
He's trying to get inside your head.
Kev, let's go.

874
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:06,652
All right.

875
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:10,388
So, you wanted
to tell me something.

876
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:12,626
Yeah...

877
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:16,135
I was gonna say,
don't cut your turns too tight.

878
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:17,671
Got it, chief.

879
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,538
OK.

880
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:28,513
Let's go!

881
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:52,431
<i>Drivers, start your engines!</i>

882
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:13,853
<i> We've got
the makings of a great race today. </i>

883
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:16,830
<i>Beautiful weather
and a great field of cars</i>

884
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:19,799
<i>as they head out
for their two pace laps. </i>

885
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:22,336
<i> We anticipate
a record crowd. </i>

886
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:24,304
<i>Fans have come to see
which driver</i>

887
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:26,431
<i>will hoist
the Nextel Cup trophy. </i>

888
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:28,703
<i> Great stories
bookend this field. </i>

889
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:30,642
<i>Trip Murphy, star of the season,</i>

890
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:33,977
<i>will lead the field to the
green flag from pole position. </i>

891
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:37,108
<i>Then there's Maggie Peyton,
starting last. </i>

892
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:38,981
<i>We'll see if she has what it takes</i>

893
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:41,214
<i>and if Herbie has
a good enough engine. </i>

894
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:44,383
<i>The pace car is off,
the green flag is out,</i>

895
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:47,393
<i>and we're underway here
at California Speedway!</i>

896
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:54,531
Those guys are fast!

897
01:22:54,602 --> 01:22:57,765
<i> Looks like
the 53 car got left in the dust. </i>

898
01:22:57,839 --> 01:22:59,534
<i>There is a minimum speed. </i>

899
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:01,734
<i>She better get going
or get a black flag. </i>

900
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,608
Come on, Herbie.
We're not out of this yet.

901
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:08,745
Come on, Mags. Go!

902
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:12,013
<i> Rookie jitters
or a mechanical problem,</i>

903
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,611
<i>but Maggie Peyton's
barely hanging on now. </i>

904
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:16,418
OK. Let's go get Dale!

905
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:23,455
<i> Herbie
starts to gain ground. </i>

906
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:26,432
<i>Here's Peyton drafting up
to Dale Jarrett in the 88.</i>

907
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:31,362
<i> Wait. I don't
think Herbie's drafting. </i>

908
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:33,805
<i>I think he's
literally attached to #88.</i>

909
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,900
That little car's
riding my bumper!

910
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:38,241
<i> Come on, Dale,
shake her off!</i>

911
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:41,982
Hang on!

912
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:44,816
Come on, Maggie.

913
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:49,952
Here we go! Ready?

914
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:52,449
<i> What a move!</i>

915
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,018
<i>Maggie just did a slingshot on
Dale Jarrett to move past #88.</i>

916
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:57,928
Yes! Go, Mags!

917
01:23:57,999 --> 01:24:01,059
Unorthodox, but it
put her back in the race.

918
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:03,831
I bet her granddad's
smiling at that one.

919
01:24:04,906 --> 01:24:08,000
We're back in it.
Who's running first?

920
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:10,203
<i> Trip has Junior
by 2 lengths. </i>

921
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:20,682
Come on, Mags!

922
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,923
<i> Best pit stop
of the day for Team Peyton. </i>

923
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,558
<i>That keeps them in the hunt. </i>

924
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:09,899
<i>Got a hungry pack
chasing the leaders. </i>

925
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:13,998
<i>Tony Stewart, Jeff Gordon,
Mike Bliss, all after the top spot. </i>

926
01:25:14,075 --> 01:25:17,670
<i> Maggie Peyton
and Herbie come up on the outside. </i>

927
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:21,181
Eighteen laps to go in one
of the most surprising races

928
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:22,648
in NASCAR history.

929
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,809
<i>Trip Murphy in #82 is in front. </i>

930
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:27,387
<i>But can he hold the lead
in the final laps?</i>

931
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:28,478
Here we come.

932
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:39,165
Herbie, we gotta find
an opening!

933
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:42,765
We'll make a move on turn three.

934
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,573
They're boxing us in.

935
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:49,166
<i> Three wide
behind the leaders!</i>

936
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:51,075
<i>Labonte low,
Peyton in the middle!</i>

937
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:54,513
<i>Peyton takes a shot from Gordon
and one from Labonte. </i>

938
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:56,675
<i>And now one from Kasey Kahne!</i>

939
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:58,911
<i>Herbie's getting pounded
in this pack!</i>

940
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:04,856
- I'm getting killed. Can't shake them!
- Yes, you can.

941
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:07,087
You can do this, sparkplug.

942
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:10,427
- Dad?
- Buckle down and grit your teeth.

943
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:11,999
<i>Come on, Magpie. </i>

944
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:16,298
You're the next great Peyton.
Time for everyone to know it.

945
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:17,736
Thanks, Dad.

946
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:22,771
Look at that.

947
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:23,936
Now what?

948
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:30,312
- Any suggestions?
- Gas it. Gas it right now!

949
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:36,687
Huh?

950
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:39,556
<i> There's
running over competition,</i>

951
01:26:39,627 --> 01:26:41,322
<i>but never done like that!</i>

952
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:43,057
- Yeah!
- Yah-hah!

953
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:45,599
- Oh-ho!
- Yeah!

954
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:49,399
Uh-oh. We've got a new problem.

955
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:52,633
Herbie's losing
oil pressure... fast!

956
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:58,912
Looks like the 53's
leaking oil on the track.

957
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:00,311
We're coming in.

958
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:06,614
Kevin, it's Sally.
What's going on with #53?

959
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:09,781
- Did you drive here?
- Yeah. Why?

960
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,291
<i> Here comes
the caution flag. </i>

961
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,453
<i>Everyone to the pits. </i>

962
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:18,260
<i>Team Peyton may be out of
the race with that oil leak. </i>

963
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:40,577
That stunt you pulled
almost cost us the race!

964
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:42,815
Take care of the car
and let me drive.

965
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:47,356
- Can I make two suggestions?
- Not now, Larry!

966
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:54,293
Not a perfect fit,
but it'll have to hold!

967
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:57,968
- How bad is it?
- It might hold for 5 laps.

968
01:27:58,039 --> 01:27:59,939
It might hold for one.

969
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:03,273
Either way, avoid being
slammed around out there!

970
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:10,042
Listen. You raced your heart
out there today, Herbie.

971
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:14,451
But if we keep going, that might
be it for you. Forever.

972
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:19,016
Sorry. I'd rather lose
this race than lose you.

973
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:26,564
Whoa! Oh!
Are you sure?

974
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,499
<i> I can't believe it. </i>

975
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:31,629
<i>Maggie Peyton and Herbie
are getting back on the track!</i>

976
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:36,135
For a car,
you're not a good listener.

977
01:28:38,012 --> 01:28:41,140
OK, Herbie. Let's finish this.

978
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:56,122
Where is she, Crash?
The Bug! Where's the Bug?

979
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:57,323
Focus on the win!

980
01:28:57,398 --> 01:29:01,528
<i> The fans are pulling
for rookie driver Maggie Peyton,</i>

981
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:03,570
<i>in a car she calls Herbie. </i>

982
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:11,534
Attagirl. Nice move.
Now go get 'em, Maggie!

983
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:14,137
<i> Peyton
on an incredible rally,</i>

984
01:29:14,215 --> 01:29:15,910
<i>passing them left and right. </i>

985
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:19,885
<i>Now up to second place,
behind Trip Murphy. Amazing!</i>

986
01:29:21,756 --> 01:29:23,053
Come on.

987
01:29:29,564 --> 01:29:31,464
Did you miss us?

988
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:34,365
This girl's really
beginning to tick me off.

989
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:36,835
<i> 2 laps to go
in a two-car race. </i>

990
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:40,465
<i>Trip Murphy and Maggie Peyton
will settle this between them!</i>

991
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:42,668
Go, Maggie!

992
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:44,803
- All right!
- We've got him now!

993
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:54,078
On the outside!

994
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,613
Go high, Herbie.

995
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:04,590
Come on, Herbie.
We're almost there.

996
01:30:04,665 --> 01:30:08,658
<i> Door to door
off the corner at the final... Contact!</i>

997
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:10,795
<i>Murphy slams
into the side of Peyton!</i>

998
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:20,205
Mags, don't push it.
Mags, Herbie can't take it.

999
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:33,457
- Forget the Bug and win!
- You're going down, Bug!

1000
01:30:40,301 --> 01:30:41,962
<i>Trouble in turn four!</i>

1001
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:44,630
<i>Murphy into the wall
and upside down!</i>

1002
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:49,709
OK, Herbie, you ready?

1003
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:52,177
- Keep it steady!
- Ahh!

1004
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:55,079
<i> No place to go!
Look out for the crash!</i>

1005
01:30:55,149 --> 01:30:57,117
<i>Herbie's... </i>

1006
01:30:57,218 --> 01:31:00,119
<i>Herbie's on the fence!
Herbie's on the fence!</i>

1007
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:07,293
Oh! Oh, God!

1008
01:31:12,867 --> 01:31:14,767
<i>Maggie Peyton won!</i>

1009
01:31:14,836 --> 01:31:18,602
<i>- Maggie Peyton has won! Incredible!
-  Unbelievable!</i>

1010
01:31:18,673 --> 01:31:21,198
<i>I've never seen anything
like this in NASCAR,</i>

1011
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:24,836
<i>not to mention the birth
of the next great Peyton!</i>

1012
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:37,080
We did it.

1013
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:43,030
Let's go!

1014
01:31:43,097 --> 01:31:45,031
Whoo-hoo!

1015
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:09,954
- Whoo!
- Yes!

1016
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:15,695
I'm so proud of you!

1017
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:17,822
Thanks, Dad.

1018
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:19,526
Maggie, that was awesome!

1019
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,433
- Thank you.
- So great!

1020
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:29,506
Hey! I thought
your depth perception...

1021
01:32:29,577 --> 01:32:31,511
Oh, well,

1022
01:32:31,579 --> 01:32:34,673
the best Peyton was on
the track today. You did it.

1023
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:37,616
- Congrats.
- Oh...

1024
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:39,310
Look!
Listen to me!

1025
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:41,012
That car is possessed!

1026
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:42,521
Trip!

1027
01:32:43,858 --> 01:32:46,088
I saw it too.
It smiled at me!

1028
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:49,025
That car is alive!

1029
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:52,463
You gotta believe me.
It's mocking me!

1030
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:55,001
I'm telling you!
That car is alive!

1031
01:32:57,104 --> 01:33:00,972
Look! It's doing it again!

1032
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:04,136
You gotta believe me!
You gotta believe me!

1033
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:06,008
This isn't the end, Bug!

1034
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:09,538
I'm going to get you, Bug!
I'm going to get you!

1035
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:13,279
He's fine. He's fine.
Just a little dehydrated.

1036
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:16,149
Wow.

1037
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:22,788
Gotta say, Peyton, you and
Herbie make a great team.

1038
01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:25,195
We make a great team.

1039
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:28,758
Yeah, I thought we had good
driver-crew chief rapport there.

1040
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:31,270
Herbie, help me out here.

1041
01:33:31,339 --> 01:33:32,670
Wha...

1042
01:33:59,567 --> 01:34:02,297
All right, now, I'm gonna trust
you guys this time,

1043
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:04,099
but you got
a big race coming up.

1044
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:07,732
Have her home at a decent hour.
Show some respect. All right?

1045
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:09,605
<i>My house, my rules.
Comprende?</i>

1046
01:34:10,945 --> 01:34:13,209
OK, Ray,
I think they got it.

1047
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,305
All right.

1048
01:34:15,383 --> 01:34:17,874
Go on. Get out of here.

1049
01:34:20,855 --> 01:34:22,823
I mean it, Herbie.

1050
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:30,492
Rrrrr!
