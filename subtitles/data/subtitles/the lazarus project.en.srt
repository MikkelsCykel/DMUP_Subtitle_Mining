00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,526
Daddy, what's the greatest thing
you ever saw?

2
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,158
The greatest thing that I ever saw.

3
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,299
One time, when I was a little boy...

4
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:44,668
...I was playing with my slingshot,
and I saw this jaybird.

5
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,044
I don't know why, but I shot him.

6
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,705
You killed a birdie?

7
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,185
I didn't mean to.

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,612
I don't even know why I shot at him,
but I felt so bad.

9
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,987
Then I started praying to God
that he would come back.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,128
And all of a sudden,
the jaybird woke up.

11
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,923
He just-- He just flew away.

12
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,690
God saved him?

13
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,960
Yeah, I think so.

14
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:11,727
Hey, Katie.

15
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,999
Bedtime.

16
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,908
Why does it always
have to be bedtime?

17
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,049
I'll race you inside.

18
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,795
December 18th.

19
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,059
Your last day.

20
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:45,936
No more parole.

21
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,174
I'm a free man.

22
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,805
It seems like so long ago.

23
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,645
So....

24
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,377
You wanna celebrate?

25
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,809
You got problems. Issues, man.

26
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,503
Come on, today's a good day.
I'm celebrating something.

27
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,773
So no problems today
and definitely no issues.

28
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,247
Sorry to bust up your fantasy world,
Cinderella...

29
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,649
...but our 5:00 just took a nose-dive
into the Dallas river.

30
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,687
We lost a thousand cases.

31
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,724
-All right, call in a four-shift.
-Okay.

32
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,954
Have them pull a swing. I want another
truck loaded and off by 11.

33
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,529
All right?

34
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,593
Yeah?

35
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,805
-Did you hear about the 5:00?
-Yeah.

36
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,804
Hell, if it ain't always something,
huh?

37
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,670
We'll make up for it by tomorrow.

38
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,038
How's the driver?

39
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,670
Broken leg.
Passerby pulled him out.

40
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,044
Who says
there's no more heroes, huh?

41
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,809
How's your little girl?

42
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,581
She's good. She's an angel.

43
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,691
Love every moment.

44
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,258
It kills you when they leave.

45
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,093
I'll call the driver's wife.

46
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,094
-Ben.
-Yeah.

47
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,964
You're doing a great job.

48
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,334
Thanks.

49
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,031
I can schedule the classes
around Katie's school.

50
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,804
And if I score over 80 on the test,
RealTops guarantees me a job.

51
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,571
How much is the class?

52
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,140
It's $1100.

53
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,285
This could be really good for us.

54
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,558
I can make money selling homes.

55
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,320
Enough that we can move out
of the city, on a lake.

56
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,589
-But Dallas isn't that bad, come on.
-I know.

57
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,398
There's a RealTops office
in Marietta.

58
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,899
When that brewery opens--

59
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,901
But they haven't offered me
the job yet.

60
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,937
Yeah, but they will.
Danny trusts you.

61
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,075
He'll want you running that place.

62
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,637
You really wanna live
in the country, huh?

63
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:13,217
It'd be nice to look out the window and
see something other than concrete.

64
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,286
I like the country too.

65
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,934
-Why, you mother-- You mother--
-Watch your mouth.

66
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,129
You know how Dad felt about cussing.

67
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,775
-They let you out early?
-They can't keep you forever.

68
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,001
Not on burglary, anyway.

69
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,175
-Good to see you, big brother.
-It's good to see you, okay?

70
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,777
Hey, Lisa.

71
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,852
-It's good to see you.
-Yeah.

72
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,553
Good to see you too.

73
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,491
Look at you.
Prettiest little girl on planet Earth.

74
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,791
-Katie, this is your uncle Ricky.
-I've seen your picture.

75
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,661
That's funny, that's really funny...

76
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,498
...because I got a picture of you
in my wallet.

77
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,134
How long are you in town for?

78
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,404
I don't know.

79
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,572
I gotta get her to bed.

80
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,709
-I love you, baby.
-Hey, it's good to see you. It's--

81
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,409
Yeah.

82
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,990
I'm sorry I couldn't come visit you.

83
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,563
Florida's a long drive.

84
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,692
And jail ain't a place
for your little angel.

85
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,766
She's beautiful, Ben.

86
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,608
Hey, Ricky,
there's blankets in the closet.

87
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,611
Thanks, but I got a room.
I didn't wanna impose.

88
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,482
All right, I'm going to bed.

89
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,175
You boys
don't drink yourself stupid.

90
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,945
Good night.

91
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,054
How's Marilyn?

92
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,760
She's not a part of my life anymore.

93
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,129
I got something.
I got something good.

94
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:51,507
Supercomputers.
Ones like the military uses.

95
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,077
The internals, wiring and switches...

96
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,684
...all custom-made,
lined with a common conductor.

97
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,513
Gold.

98
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,381
I'm not talking gold bars.

99
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:07,288
I'm talking something so low-profile,
a rent-a-cop watches the place.

100
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,918
Dust. Gold dust.

101
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,462
Untraceable.
The lab stocks 30 pounds of it.

102
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,465
You can carry that out
with a knapsack.

103
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,967
All I need is a dialer.

104
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,238
Look, Ricky.

105
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:27,302
Every day I was inside,
all I could think about was my family.

106
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:33,249
You know that Katie was 3 years old
when I got out?

107
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,545
Three years old.

108
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,689
And she didn't even know
who the hell I was.

109
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,190
I can't go back in.

110
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,700
You ever think
about what we'd be doing...

111
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,337
...if Dad hadn't killed himself?

112
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,405
All the time.

113
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,507
I'm heading to Utah Sunday.

114
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,944
Till then, I'm at the Six Days Inn.

115
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,587
Don't be stupid, Ricky.

116
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,352
You're out. Stay out.

117
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,158
If you change your mind, call me.

118
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,823
I'm calling you no matter what,
but I'm not changing my mind.

119
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,201
-I love you.
-You too.

120
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,905
Dad?

121
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,271
Ben.

122
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,679
Damn it, Ben.

123
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,717
Don't smoke in bed.
You're gonna burn this place down.

124
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,057
Are you okay?

125
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,354
I am fine.
I just had another bad dream.

126
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,157
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,898
May I see? Are you all right?

128
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,875
You're all right.

129
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,974
What did Ricky want?

130
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,449
He just wanted to say hi.

131
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,953
Other side. Okay?

132
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,594
-Stop it, Daddy.
-One more, one more.

133
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,427
Love you, guys.

134
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,565
Yeah.

135
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,937
Joey said you wanted to talk to me.

136
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,731
Yeah, sit down, Ben.

137
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,278
Well, this must be serious.

138
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,512
It seems like we mostly talk
with my head poking through the door.

139
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:53,887
Yeah, that's true.
I mean, that's-- That's how we talk.

140
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,030
You upset with me, Danny?

141
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,961
Oh, God, no, Ben.

142
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,559
You're one of the good ones.

143
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,700
That's what's making
this position I'm in....

144
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,536
Well, it's making me sick.

145
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,105
I gotta let you go.

146
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,918
I put you in
to run the new place in Marietta.

147
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,321
The owners
did a background check.

148
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,819
-Your record came up.
-Yeah, that was a long time ago.

149
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:32,158
Hell, I don't care
what you did in the past, Ben.

150
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,330
I've made some bad choices
in my life too.

151
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,959
Yeah, well, then talk to them, Danny.
Tell them I'm not the same man.

152
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,698
I have talked to them, Ben.

153
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,567
Hell, they wanted you gone
three weeks ago.

154
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,514
Danny, this job is everything to me.

155
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,746
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,745
Hi.

157
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,478
Hey.

158
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,054
-I see you got your books already.
-Yeah.

159
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:39,664
All I gotta do is study for five months
and we are home free.

160
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,863
You okay?

161
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,266
Yeah, I'm all right, just....

162
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,840
I'm-- I'm tired.
I'm just gonna lay down.

163
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,110
Yeah.

164
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,115
Tomorrow night.

165
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,349
Why did you change your mind?

166
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,191
Life changed it for me.

167
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,195
Just get in the back.

168
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,269
Hey, give us a second.

169
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,279
Ready?

170
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,115
Who in the hell is that?

171
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,383
His name is Phelps.
And he's the one that gave me the tip.

172
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,149
We were inside together.

173
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,584
He's okay, man.
He's just an extra pair of eyes, is all.

174
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,525
You didn't tell me about Phelps,
Ricky.

175
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,165
I didn't tell you,
because I knew how you'd react...

176
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,800
...and I need you.

177
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,068
No, I can't do this.

178
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,332
Period. Tell him.
Let's get the hell out of here.

179
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,238
Ben....

180
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,253
Phelps, he works for someone.

181
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,423
A guy I owe a lot of money to.

182
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,152
And they....

183
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,622
They want their money now. Tonight.
And they're not the kind of people...

184
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,668
...who would understand
why it didn't happen tonight.

185
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,536
They're gonna kill me, Ben.

186
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,458
Let's go.

187
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,140
Hold this.

188
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,146
Come on, man. It's cool, man.

189
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:51,153
Ricky told me. No guns. I know.

190
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,720
You'll do as you're told.

191
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,411
-What's with all the colored ones?
-Watch this.

192
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,241
Yellow's video.

193
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,509
Red's audio.
Green is the alarm companies.

194
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,516
Most of the others are dummies.

195
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,858
All right.

196
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,963
All right, five minutes
until the alarm company...

197
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,693
...knows they have crossed wires.

198
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,962
It means we have three.

199
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,065
-Ready?
-Yeah, ready.

200
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,732
Let's go.

201
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,610
All right.

202
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,990
Almost looks real.

203
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,889
All right,
you know what you're doing.

204
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,758
Make sure no one surprises.
We're going straight in. Ready?

205
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,159
Let's go.

206
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,701
Touch that thing and we all go
boom-boom. Show me your hands.

207
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,532
You, right there.

208
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,572
Come with me.
Come on, come on, come on.

209
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,403
Let's go.

210
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,936
Get out of here, come on.
Come on, let's go.

211
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,137
Let's go, let's go.

212
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,975
Come on, come on.

213
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,711
Let's go.
Let's go take a walk. Come on.

214
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,044
Come on. Over here.

215
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,917
All right? Sit right here.

216
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,693
Don't move. Don't move.

217
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,858
Relax. Calm down.

218
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,260
Sit tight.
It's gonna be a happy ending, okay?

219
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,698
Capiche?

220
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,239
Okay.

221
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,010
What the hell is taking him so long?

222
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,413
-It's been 30 seconds. Calm down.
-All right.

223
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,583
Cool. Everybody's cool, right?

224
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,228
Everybody's cool.

225
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,350
Hey, don't. Don't.

226
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,086
-What are you doing?
-Don't do it.

227
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,390
His ankle. His ankle.

228
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,760
-Show me your hands.
-Police. Drop your weapons.

229
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,362
Ben Garvey, please rise.

230
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:35,406
We, the jury, duly impaneled
in the above entitled action...

231
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:40,018
...find the defendant,
Ben Garvey, guilty.

232
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,924
Because you committed a crime...

233
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,993
... that lead directly
to the deaths of three people...

234
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:54,895
... the jury has found you guilty
of three counts of capital murder.

235
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:00,670
I hereby sentence you
to Beaumont Supermax...

236
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,808
... where you will await execution.

237
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,703
May God have mercy on your soul.

238
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,586
State Supreme Court refused it.

239
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,933
I'm not a killer.

240
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,734
You were there
during the commission of a crime.

241
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,628
This is Texas.

242
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:37,502
In the eyes of the law, you might
as well have shot them yourself.

243
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,507
Ben,
they're moving real fast on this.

244
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,013
You need to prepare yourself.

245
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:52,179
And then Wendy told Mrs. Jamison,
so I hit her in the face.

246
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,287
You know that was wrong,
don't you?

247
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,950
Yeah, but she deserved it.
She broke a promise.

248
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,660
Yeah, but no more hitting.

249
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,700
No matter what, okay?

250
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,133
Okay.

251
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,107
Daddy, when are you
gonna come back home?

252
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,245
You know I love you
and your mommy...

253
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,546
...more than anything else
in the world, right?

254
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,945
Yeah.

255
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,249
Well....

256
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,925
I did something real bad.

257
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,288
Come on, take your walk.

258
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,626
Something I didn't mean to do.

259
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,132
Like the jaybird?

260
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,999
Yeah, like the jaybird.

261
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,851
So Daddy's gotta go away
for a really long time.

262
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,984
Do you have to go?

263
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,783
Yeah, I have to.

264
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,777
When are you gonna come back?

265
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,480
I'm not coming back.

266
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,789
I can't come back.

267
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,429
Daddy will always love you.

268
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,908
You headed for Mount Angel?

269
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,916
Rain's gonna start up again.
Jump in. I'll give you a ride.

270
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,153
Constant rain showers
this time of year.

271
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,489
Like clockwork.

272
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,430
Sun, rain, sun, rain.

273
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,804
I'm assuming
you're the new groundskeeper?

274
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,244
Yeah.

275
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,347
Well, how do you like it so far?

276
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,839
What's happening to me?

277
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,379
It's quiet.

278
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,552
Quiet is why the order came here.

279
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:48,056
It's good for priests.
Not to mention the patients.

280
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,232
Groundskeeper's office
is at the end of the main hall.

281
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,171
Let me park,
and I'll give you the tour.

282
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,032
You have been given
a second chance.

283
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,587
I wanna go home.

284
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,942
Tapalamaho
is what the lndians called this plateau.

285
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,080
They'd come here to pray.

286
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,976
Then, 200 years ago,
the order came...

287
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:55,313
...built this place
and started praying too.

288
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,923
I guess if it's good enough for the
lndians, it's good enough for priests.

289
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,957
Chapel's off the east wing.
I'll show it to you.

290
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,831
The stained glass needs
to be cleaned every month.

291
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:11,799
The chapel itself, once a week.
Fridays are good.

292
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:16,105
The last groundskeeper left things
in a bit of a mess.

293
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,401
Unexpected departure.

294
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:27,379
The chapel was the first building
put up, and all the pipes run from it.

295
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,544
Most plumbing problems
will start here.

296
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,190
Oh, it's the old priest rectory.

297
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,922
It's closed up. Water damage.

298
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,967
This tunnel connects
all five buildings.

299
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,365
Its not used for much anymore.

300
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,438
But I think the first priests hid here...

301
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,666
...when the natives got restless.

302
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,541
There's no going back, Ben.

303
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,020
If you need help, use Robbie.

304
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,782
Working on the grounds
is good therapy for him.

305
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,891
He likes to be needed.

306
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,186
Well, she's all yours.

307
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,890
How are you adjusting?

308
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,135
It can be difficult at first.

309
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,802
It becomes easier.

310
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,669
Do you remember my name?

311
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,337
Avery.

312
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:45,980
Where am I?

313
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,795
This is Oregon.

314
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,777
I'm alive.

315
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,081
What does that make you, then?

316
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,459
A guide.

317
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,825
I don't want any of this.

318
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,261
I wanna be back
with my wife and my daughter.

319
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,775
Can I please leave?

320
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,008
You've made a selfish choice, Ben.

321
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,778
Men died that day.

322
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,447
There's a price to pay.

323
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,750
You cannot see them again
in this life.

324
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,728
It was an accident.

325
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,160
It was a horrible accident.

326
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,129
Ben, listen to me.

327
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,100
The rules are simple.

328
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,637
This is a second chance.

329
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,539
Now, if you deny it...

330
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:14,371
...you've damned yourself
to an eternity without Lisa and Katie.

331
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,846
Outside of this town,
the only thing waiting for you is death.

332
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,220
Accept this new life.

333
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,731
What if I can't?

334
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,296
You will.

335
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:43,035
Only a fool spits in the face of God.

336
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,391
I'm not crazy.

337
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,727
People think
just because you're here...

338
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,127
...means you're crazy.

339
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,207
I did high school in Portland.

340
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,640
I didn't like it.

341
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,569
I wanted to go to college after...

342
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:25,944
...but my dad wanted me
to join the Army.

343
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,351
He thought it would make me tough.

344
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,447
Do you like your dad?

345
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,493
Yeah.

346
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,420
He live in Oregon?

347
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,128
He died when I was a kid.

348
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,498
That's sad.

349
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,911
People are watching us.

350
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,313
I don't know who they are.

351
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,385
They're always watching.

352
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,288
Do you think I'm crazy?

353
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,326
No. I don't think you're crazy.

354
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,176
Watch his hand.

355
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,688
Why did you stop me?

356
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,620
Why did you stop me?

357
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,188
Why did you stop me?

358
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,727
Why'd you do it, Ben?

359
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,060
PGE operator. Can I help you?

360
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,492
Yes, I need a number, please.

361
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,624
Lisa Garvey in Dallas, Texas.

362
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,198
Hold on, please.

363
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,034
I'm sorry, sir.
There is no such listing.

364
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:26,787
Priest Andari.

365
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,763
They're copies
of his most famous works.

366
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,669
Hi.

367
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:38,207
I'm Julie Ingram.
I'm one of the counselors here.

368
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,578
You are the new groundskeeper?

369
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,804
Ben.

370
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,315
They were etched by the Mount's
founding priest, Isaac Fowler.

371
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:56,659
They've faded a bit,
but this is a nice place to think.

372
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,127
I'll come back later.

373
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,959
No. No, it's okay.

374
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,898
I'm done thinking.

375
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:07,999
Hey.

376
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,938
Welcome to Mount Angel.

377
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:29,185
Why did you stop me?

378
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,853
It was an accident.

379
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,224
There are no accidents.

380
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:37,856
There are only thing things we do and
what those things do to other people.

381
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,969
William.

382
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,503
Let him go.

383
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:47,541
You're just like me.

384
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,121
This is Building Number 5.

385
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,157
It's where we keep patients
who can't be controlled.

386
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,351
It's best to steer clear of it.

387
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,547
You new?

388
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,092
Around here, I mean.

389
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,488
Yeah.

390
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:41,154
There's not a lot to do in Dundee,
but it's an all right place.

391
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,457
Can I get you anything else?

392
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,932
I'll just take the check.

393
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,438
Go away.

394
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,126
Get out of here.

395
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:54,888
Go home, dog.

396
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,533
You're not getting in here.

397
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,328
Go home.

398
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:07,270
People have been drawing
with charcoal for thousands of years.

399
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,940
There are these caves in France...

400
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,075
...Lascaux, I think...

401
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,813
...where they found these
from the Stone Age...

402
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,648
...all done in charcoal.

403
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,883
Deer, bison, horses.

404
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,728
Even one of you.

405
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,874
Hi. I'm Lisa Madison,
and I've been selling homes here...

406
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,847
...in the Marietta, Powder Springs
area for over a year now.

407
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,054
I know the area and the people...

408
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,655
...Iike the back of my hand.

409
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:03,157
Why? Because I live here
with my daughter.

410
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,522
This is my house and my dream.

411
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,892
RealTops made it possible for me...

412
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,556
...and I can make it
possible for you.

413
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,626
Bye.

414
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,311
So, what's in Texas?

415
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,481
Home.

416
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,083
Bus will be along in about an hour.

417
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,827
This bus is not for you, Ben.

418
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,065
You don't wanna be on it.

419
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,500
You need to let go.

420
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,706
Stop thinking about what you had.

421
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,347
Just accept what you were given.

422
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,679
A new home, a job.

423
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,784
A chance to make
what you did right.

424
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,286
I have to be with my wife
and my daughter.

425
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,949
They need me.

426
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,027
Ben, look at me.

427
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,770
Death is here.

428
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,136
Close to you.

429
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,868
It's what you hear in the forest
when you're all alone.

430
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:37,042
Now, you cheated him once.

431
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:40,148
You won't cheat him a second time.

432
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,777
This bus won't take you home.

433
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:49,258
Stay on it and you'll never see
your family again.

434
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,354
Make the right choice
while you still can.

435
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,469
Thank you.

436
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,915
Ben?

437
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,180
Hi.

438
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,448
Hi.

439
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:56,115
I didn't see you today.

440
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:58,193
I was cleaning the chapel.

441
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,889
It's beautiful inside.

442
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:02,896
Quiet.

443
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,797
Quiet guy who likes quiet places.

444
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,027
Shocking.

445
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,569
Hey, what are you doing for dinner?

446
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,872
You still smoke?

447
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,272
Cigarette burn
between your fingers, right?

448
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,850
Yeah. I quit a few years back.

449
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,249
I fell asleep while smoking.

450
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:27,652
-Could've burned your house down.
-That's why I quit.

451
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,251
So you been in Dundee long?

452
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,125
No, not long.

453
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,631
I'm actually from San Diego.

454
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,894
And you're a psychiatrist.

455
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,800
And your job brought you here.

456
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:43,997
Partly.

457
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:48,543
And then there was the train wreck
of a relationship that I was in.

458
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:51,681
I think I needed to escape that.

459
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,750
-Changing your whole life around.
-Yeah.

460
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,852
That must have been tough.

461
00:45:57,354 --> 00:46:00,812
No. Not really.

462
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:07,019
I figured I was probably more lonely
in the relationship than I was out.

463
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,722
I was right.

464
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,801
It looks like they're kicking us out.

465
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:20,904
Need a ride?

466
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,877
No, thanks. I'm just down the road.

467
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,450
Okay. I'll see you in the morning.

468
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,655
This bus is not for you, Ben.

469
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:53,561
What did we do?

470
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,154
What's the symbol mean?

471
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,057
I killed a man.

472
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:00,997
Shot him.

473
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:06,303
And I did it for no other reason
than he was home.

474
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,308
That's how I got here.

475
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,779
What does it mean?

476
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,649
The symbol on your wrist,
the one that you carved into the trail.

477
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,981
How could I have done that?

478
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,147
I saw you out, William.

479
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,419
No one can get out.

480
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,030
Not even you have that key.

481
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,700
What does it mean?

482
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:36,498
You should know.
You're just like me.

483
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,646
They're watching again.

484
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,053
Nobody's watching, Robbie.

485
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,862
I see them.

486
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,992
There's nobody.

487
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,864
Do you understand that?

488
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:09,767
That's why they keep you here,
Robbie.

489
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,568
It's because you act crazy
and you talk crazy.

490
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,608
There's nobody watching us.

491
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,011
You're here too, Ben.

492
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:37,926
I didn't mean to sneak up on you.

493
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:41,969
I'm picking up some furniture
in Silverton. I could use a hand.

494
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:49,975
Oh, rain clouds.

495
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,206
I suspect it's gonna start up again.

496
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:56,619
People like Robbie....

497
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,620
People with psychological issues,
do they even know it?

498
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,555
No, not usually.

499
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:07,185
The hardest part of treatment
is convincing them they're ill.

500
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:10,089
What's wrong with Robbie?

501
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,331
Robbie killed his father.

502
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:17,937
Stabbed him 40 times with a hunting
knife, then burnt the house down.

503
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,576
-Robbie did that?
-Yup.

504
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,936
His father was a bad man.

505
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:27,680
Robbie thinks people
are watching him.

506
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,216
Yup.

507
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,844
Well, we all create fictions
to deal with our pain.

508
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,487
The only thing watching Robbie
is his guilt.

509
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:47,393
I'll be right back.
I just want to say goodbye to Carl.

510
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:32,709
It looks like poison ivy,
maybe an allergic reaction.

511
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:36,311
How's everything else?
You look tired.

512
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,613
I haven't been sleeping so well.

513
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:39,812
Because?

514
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:42,853
I've never lived in the woods before.

515
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:45,221
At night, you get woken up.

516
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:48,660
You hear things.
Well, sometimes I even see things.

517
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,097
Nothing's out there.
You know, it's just the wind.

518
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,231
Yeah, I know.

519
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:03,102
I'll give you some
prescription-strength hydrocortisone.

520
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,475
It'll bring the swelling down.

521
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,460
Hey.

522
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:19,993
Hi.

523
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:28,001
I was gonna take a walk
down Plowers' trail after work.

524
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:30,937
You wanna come along?

525
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,746
Oh, come on, dog, stop digging.

526
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:01,862
I hope you like the rain.

527
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,096
It's on its way.

528
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,766
Can my dog come along?

529
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,843
What's his name?

530
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:10,403
Dog.

531
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:13,644
You named your dog Dog?

532
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:15,751
Well, I just found him.

533
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:17,782
Yes, bring Dog.

534
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:20,445
But we're giving him a real name
on the walk.

535
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:22,624
All right.

536
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,861
What about Bill?

537
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:29,521
Bill?

538
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:31,926
What kind of name is Bill for a dog?

539
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,332
It's better than Dog.

540
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:36,404
Not by much.

541
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,667
So tell me something about you.

542
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:41,401
Like what?

543
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,469
I don't know.

544
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,781
What's your favorite color?

545
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,681
Well, I haven't thought
about that one.

546
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:52,447
Hey, I wanna show you something.
Over here.

547
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,850
Come on, Dog.

548
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:06,196
It's beautiful.

549
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,528
I know.

550
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,506
Do you come here a lot?

551
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,911
Yeah, quite a bit.

552
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,775
To think.

553
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,472
About?

554
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:26,151
Just things I'm trying to let go of.

555
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,686
There's a struggle.

556
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:31,918
How do you live
if you're ruled by your past?

557
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:35,587
But how do you let go
of a past that made you?

558
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,571
You still haven't told me anything
about yourself.

559
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:48,670
I like the name Dog for a dog.

560
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,240
Maybe it's not such a bad name.

561
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,450
Hey, man.

562
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:05,526
Kitchen guys wanted me to let you
know the disposal line's backed up.

563
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:44,121
Sorry, Ben. Sorry.

564
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,127
-We thought you were William.
-He found a way out.

565
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,961
You need a hand finding him?

566
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,259
No, no, he's dangerous.
We'll see you tomorrow.

567
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:53,197
Come on.

568
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:10,443
I wonder how far down it is.

569
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:18,076
Everybody's looking for you.

570
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:19,744
They're worried.

571
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:23,115
They always worry.

572
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,457
That's what they do.

573
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:35,193
I kept thinking they'd let me go
once I got better if I....

574
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:38,605
If I made better choices.

575
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:48,377
I have a son in the world.

576
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,746
I don't see him.

577
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:56,616
Yeah, me too.

578
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,920
I mean, I have a daughter.

579
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,662
We're far apart.

580
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,597
My boy, he....

581
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:09,502
Well, he probably doesn't
even remember me by now.

582
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,945
They made me this way.

583
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,343
They gave me drugs.

584
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:28,115
Put me in that building because
I wouldn't do what they wanted.

585
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:32,090
I wouldn't be
who they wanted me to be.

586
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,158
Let's go back.

587
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:42,334
If you run,
they're just gonna follow you.

588
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:44,968
I know.

589
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,135
But they can't follow me to heaven.

590
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:57,847
No. No.

591
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:07,889
Give me a hand.

592
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,927
Are you okay?

593
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:21,110
Have you ever had this
happen before?

594
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:22,539
No.

595
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,441
Never a suicide.

596
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:28,841
He wanted to go home.

597
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,286
Mount Angel was his home.

598
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:36,753
I guess he just couldn't accept that.

599
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:40,929
Sometimes
I think the only real medicine...

600
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:44,191
...is to accept our lives as they are.

601
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:48,971
Come on. I'll walk you home.

602
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:18,891
Hi.

603
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:20,699
Hi.

604
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:24,938
I heard what happened with William.

605
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:29,073
I just wanted to make sure
you're all right.

606
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:33,039
Yeah, I'm all right.

607
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,151
Do you need anything?

608
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,581
Are you hungry?

609
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:47,956
I can make us something to eat.

610
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,767
Okay.

611
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:54,596
Yeah, that'd be great.

612
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:01,343
This beer is good.

613
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:06,175
I mean, I'm not a big beer girl,
but there's actually beer that's called:

614
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,374
"Stone Brew Nation"?

615
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:09,609
What is that?

616
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:12,918
But it's good.

617
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:19,050
Are you happy here?

618
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:24,699
It's-- It's a little strange.

619
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:26,664
I don't know.

620
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:28,827
Do you find it odd?

621
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,202
Odd?

622
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:34,135
No.

623
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:39,839
Dundee is perfectly,
boringly small-town normal.

624
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:43,474
-I like the people, though.
-Yes, the people are very nice.

625
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,052
-Yeah.
-Decent.

626
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:48,554
Yeah, they just--
You know, they're hard working.

627
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:50,248
Normal.

628
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,125
I'm sorry, I....

629
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,256
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

630
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,024
I should leave.

631
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:59,222
Good boy, Dog.

632
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,295
Damn it.

633
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:10,238
Sorry, Dog.

634
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,465
I'll get it down for you later.

635
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,045
Hey, Robbie.

636
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:27,944
Hey, Ben.

637
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:32,318
No clouds out tonight.

638
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,012
No.

639
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,387
How many you up to?

640
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:44,058
Four thousand two hundred
and twenty-one.

641
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:46,862
Listen, Robbie.

642
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:49,197
I gotta ask you something.

643
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,699
-Remember--?
-You want a Mountain Dew?

644
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:56,936
Thank you.

645
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,039
You're welcome.

646
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:05,486
Robbie.

647
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,586
The people that you said
are watching...

648
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,187
...who are they?

649
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:17,930
I don't know.

650
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,732
Do they watch me?

651
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:25,697
Yes.

652
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,628
There's nothing
that we can do to beat death.

653
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,887
Dog, get in the house.

654
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:25,320
Dog, come on. Inside.

655
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:35,570
Leave me alone!

656
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,398
Leave me alone!

657
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:41,736
Leave me alone!

658
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,776
Leave me alone!

659
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:45,243
Leave me alone!

660
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,539
Leave me alone!

661
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,058
I just wanna go home.

662
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:10,197
I miss you.

663
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,862
I'm sorry.

664
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,328
I know.

665
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:19,765
I just wanna come home.

666
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:21,434
Then do.

667
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:28,044
Just come home, Ben.

668
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,971
Let's go, Dog. Come on.

669
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:30,705
Dog.

670
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:32,141
Dog?

671
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:41,622
Dog!

672
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,986
Dog!

673
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,869
How's your head?

674
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,475
You took a nasty fall.

675
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,708
What am I doing here?

676
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:08,581
You were running through the woods
out of control.

677
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:10,645
I couldn't let you leave.

678
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:15,389
What do you mean,
you couldn't let me leave?

679
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:24,492
What's this?

680
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,497
Patient folder.

681
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:29,294
Your patient folder.

682
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:35,338
You've been with us
since shortly after the accident.

683
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,740
What accident?

684
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:44,451
We all create fictions
to hide our pain.

685
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,254
No.

686
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:03,596
No, they're not dead. This is a lie.

687
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:09,171
Three years ago,
you fell asleep smoking.

688
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:10,910
There was a fire.

689
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:12,944
You got out.

690
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:16,040
But Katie and Lisa didn't.

691
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,552
You blamed yourself.

692
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,915
You couldn't handle the guilt.

693
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,350
You disappeared
after several months.

694
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:29,554
Then you were arrested burglarizing
an empty warehouse in Dallas.

695
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:31,397
You were placed in care...

696
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:36,630
...and you came here shortly after
to continue treatment.

697
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:40,739
I'm not a patient.

698
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,838
I work here. I'm a groundskeeper.

699
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:45,912
You and Robbie tend the grounds.
You both enjoy it.

700
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:49,016
Right, and I have a cabin
on Plowers' trail.

701
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:50,378
I have a dog.

702
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:52,042
The old smith cabin?

703
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:55,622
It's been empty for three years.

704
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:59,123
There's no dog, Ben.

705
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:01,588
We don't allow animals
at the Mount.

706
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:06,296
You're lying to me.

707
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:09,530
Why are you lying to me, Ezra?

708
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,204
They're not dead.

709
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:13,671
I'm gonna prove it to you.

710
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,916
Hi, I'm Lisa Madison,
and I've been selling homes...

711
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:32,856
...in the Marietta, Powder Springs
area for over a year now.

712
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,552
I know the area and the people...

713
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:37,198
...because I live in Marietta
with my daughter.

714
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:38,856
They made my dream a reality.

715
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,695
RealTops made it all possible
for me.

716
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,962
- They can make it possible--
-Who's that, Ben?

717
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:45,231
-Bye.
-I don't....

718
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,841
I don't know.

719
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:00,286
Come on, it's late.

720
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,418
Let's walk you to your room.

721
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:05,651
We'll talk more in the morning.

722
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,838
Ben! Don't!

723
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:33,886
No, no. No.

724
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:36,456
Come on, let's go.

725
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,388
Let's go.

726
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:44,254
Hey.

727
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:47,025
Hey!

728
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:49,530
Let me out!

729
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:52,469
Ezra, let me out!

730
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:55,669
Ezra, let me out!

731
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:57,270
Let me out!

732
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,512
No, no.

733
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:09,816
Ezra! No, no!

734
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:43,387
Thank you.

735
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:47,158
Ben, hi.

736
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,695
-Hi.
-You doing better?

737
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,690
I was hoping
you weren't still mad at me.

738
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,865
About what?

739
01:17:57,906 --> 01:18:00,033
What happened at the cabin.

740
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:05,145
I'm sorry,
I don't remember any cabin.

741
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,545
Ben?

742
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:17,622
Are you okay?

743
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:37,040
I was talking to a man.

744
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:42,041
An angel.

745
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:47,920
And he warned me
that if I didn't accept my life here...

746
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:50,557
...then I would die.

747
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:54,186
That death would find me.

748
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:58,756
And....

749
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:05,495
A couple of times,
I would have sworn...

750
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:09,337
...that I saw a demon or something.

751
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:12,111
And I would have tried
to leave sooner...

752
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,976
...but I was afraid.

753
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:22,582
-Those were all hallucinations?
-Yeah.

754
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:28,222
Yeah, the angel
is a subconscious representation...

755
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:32,196
...of your desire to heal.

756
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:36,534
The angel was asking you
to accept this life...

757
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:38,639
...which meant getting better.

758
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:43,108
But your mind struggled,
because to heal...

759
01:19:44,045 --> 01:19:49,005
...it would also mean
letting go of Lisa and Katie.

760
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:50,742
Yeah.

761
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:55,720
So you manifested fears
and images of death...

762
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:57,825
...to keep you here.

763
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:11,095
I wanna start over.

764
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:12,835
I wanna forget.

765
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:17,401
You don't have to forget.

766
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:20,647
You just have to move on.

767
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:27,415
I wanna be outside
working the grounds again.

768
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:29,147
All right.

769
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:34,328
We'll move you back to your old room,
away from Building Number 5.

770
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,939
Do you sleep with the light on?

771
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,542
Light on?

772
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:59,118
Yeah.

773
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:03,747
I can't sleep in the dark.
I need that light on.

774
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:08,624
If not, I'm afraid that when I wake,
everything will be gone...

775
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:11,527
...and it'll only be me left
in the world.

776
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,491
Does that sound crazy?

777
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:18,230
No. It doesn't sound crazy.

778
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,031
Do you like it here, Ben?

779
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:25,539
I'm okay with it.

780
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:27,981
I like it here.

781
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:30,783
It's better than my old life.

782
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:33,617
That's great, Robbie.

783
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,048
Ben.

784
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:41,857
No one's ever treated me
like you do.

785
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,093
Like a friend.

786
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:48,292
That's because you are my friend.

787
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:51,999
My best friend.

788
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:36,382
Are you sure you want something
with shepherd in it?

789
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:38,678
-Positive.
-Well, we have one.

790
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:42,084
Small thing, really. Well-mannered.

791
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:54,224
How long has this dog been here?

792
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:58,167
Not long. About a week.

793
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,426
You're just like me.

794
01:27:20,335 --> 01:27:21,632
What happened?

795
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:24,635
-He's disappeared.
-Not for long.

796
01:27:25,173 --> 01:27:26,606
He'll turn up.

797
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:31,805
Find Ben.

798
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:34,504
It's him.

799
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:37,482
Okay, go in.

800
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:55,199
Ben, I stopped by your room.
You weren't there.

801
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:57,031
I was worried.

802
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:00,272
Ben?

803
01:28:05,146 --> 01:28:07,307
Ben's not here.

804
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:10,143
He went home.

805
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:28,827
Ben. What are you doing here?

806
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:32,302
Take it easy, Ben. Take it easy.

807
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:34,508
Ben, take it easy.

808
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,258
Since when do angels bleed?

809
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:54,395
Ben, listen to me.

810
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:58,293
Ben, listen to me. Calm down.

811
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:02,568
Ben. Relax.

812
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:05,103
Ben, calm down.

813
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:08,442
So it never happened?

814
01:29:08,609 --> 01:29:11,009
-lt never happened?
-No.

815
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:15,947
Then they're alive.

816
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:18,215
Ben, think of what you're doing.

817
01:29:24,225 --> 01:29:25,988
-No!
-Ben.

818
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:33,199
You lied to me.

819
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:35,968
Why did you do this?

820
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:39,771
Rehabilitation, Ben.

821
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:47,512
What if instead of killing people,
we could change them...

822
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:51,379
...by providing them with new lives,
environments?

823
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:53,281
-lnsane.
-No.

824
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:55,285
It all starts in the mind.

825
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:57,720
What people do, why they do it...

826
01:29:58,526 --> 01:30:01,552
...the selfish choices, it's all in here.

827
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:03,594
In our heads.

828
01:30:04,565 --> 01:30:08,831
What if we could fix
human beings, Ben?

829
01:30:09,003 --> 01:30:12,871
Fix them before they've even made
those mistakes.

830
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,439
Then they wouldn't be human.

831
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:17,840
-No, no, you don't understand.
-Don't you move.

832
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:22,506
I understand.

833
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:24,674
I understand.

834
01:30:24,852 --> 01:30:27,412
You tried to convince me
I was crazy, Ezra.

835
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:30,079
You wanted me to believe
that if I left, I'd die.

836
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:32,021
That bus never crashed.

837
01:30:32,193 --> 01:30:34,821
You told me my family was dead.

838
01:30:34,996 --> 01:30:38,932
You're not rehabilitating people, Ezra.
You're torturing them.

839
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:41,799
I saved your life, Ben.

840
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:44,199
Like you saved William's.

841
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:49,437
A different case. He didn't do well.

842
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:51,100
You pumped him full of drugs.

843
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,680
-You did the same thing to me.
-The drugs just loosened the anxiety.

844
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:55,907
You made him nuts.

845
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:58,142
He was seeing things.
I was seeing things.

846
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:01,447
-He made a choice.
-He had no choice.

847
01:31:01,622 --> 01:31:02,714
You killed him, Ezra.

848
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:05,222
You may as well pushed him
off that cliff yourself.

849
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:07,486
You'd be buried, Ben.

850
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:11,098
Dead. Mud and worms.

851
01:31:13,601 --> 01:31:16,661
We gave William
a second chance at life.

852
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:21,104
-The same chance we gave you.
-I didn't ask for one.

853
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,609
Can't let you leave, Ben.

854
01:31:35,022 --> 01:31:37,388
I'm not so sure you can stop me.

855
01:31:37,558 --> 01:31:40,220
I found your files, Ezra.
I made a copy.

856
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:43,329
-Where's the hard drive?
-Hidden, somewhere safe.

857
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:49,230
And it'll stay that way
as long as I make it home.

858
01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:52,429
Otherwise, it will go
to every paper in the country.

859
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:56,367
Now I'm gonna go home, Ezra.

860
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:59,536
And the only way you can stop me
is if you kill me.

861
01:32:06,921 --> 01:32:08,650
Kill you?

862
01:32:09,924 --> 01:32:14,088
Ben, as far as the world
is concerned...

863
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:16,526
...you're already dead.

864
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:42,853
Ben.

865
01:32:43,791 --> 01:32:48,490
What we're doing,
we're doing for the right reasons.

866
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:20,826
Mommy, I had a dream
about Daddy.

867
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:24,298
He lived in the woods
with big trees and stuff.

868
01:33:24,465 --> 01:33:27,866
I went to see him, but he was sad.

869
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:30,737
I told him about the bird.

870
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:32,873
What bird, honey?

871
01:33:34,775 --> 01:33:38,233
The jaybird.
The bird that didn't die.

872
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:45,241
Maybe Daddy's like the jaybird.

873
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:48,752
Maybe someday
he's gonna come back too.

874
01:33:49,523 --> 01:33:52,492
Don't think that way, honey.
Don't think that Daddy ever left.

875
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:54,457
Because he didn't.

876
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:57,289
He's still here with us.

877
01:33:57,999 --> 01:33:59,728
I know he is.

878
01:34:50,317 --> 01:34:53,946
Mommy, what's the greatest thing
you ever saw?

879
01:34:55,456 --> 01:34:57,788
I don't think I've seen it yet, baby.

880
01:34:58,788 --> 01:35:08,788
