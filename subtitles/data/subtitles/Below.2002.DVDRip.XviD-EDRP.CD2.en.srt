00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:13,026
What?!

2
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:14,693
I didn't say anything.

3
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:17,602
I know,
but what were you thinking?

4
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,573
Well...

5
00:00:23,112 --> 00:00:25,672
I used to hear about
these dock workers.

6
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:28,443
They would get welded up
in these kind of places.

7
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:33,487
And then... they were
never heard from again.

8
00:00:33,589 --> 00:00:34,988
Wally?

9
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:38,254
You are so fucking
out-of-bounds with that shit!

10
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:52,603
Let's keep moving.

11
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:03,247
Forward trim tank,
it looks like.

12
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:04,751
Better drive some wedges.

13
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:05,786
Yeah.

14
00:01:10,693 --> 00:01:14,595
So anything I say...
stays here --

15
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:16,096
this side of the hull.

16
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:19,429
Yeah. Yeah.

17
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:21,435
There were survivors
from the sinking.

18
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:24,005
- Brice and Loomis even, uh...

19
00:01:24,106 --> 00:01:26,336
even tried to fish a few out,

20
00:01:26,442 --> 00:01:29,843
but... Winters had other ideas,

21
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:32,176
and, uh...

22
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:35,250
he ordered a gunnery party
topside.

23
00:01:35,384 --> 00:01:36,908
Well, three of us had a problem

24
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:39,783
with machine-gunning
those men right in the water,

25
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:42,187
I mean,
even if they were German.

26
00:01:43,392 --> 00:01:44,859
There was an argument.

27
00:01:46,395 --> 00:01:49,023
It got kind of heated.

28
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,799
Well, why didn't you tell us?!

29
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:57,065
I guess, uh...

30
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:00,641
I guess we were trying
to protect him --

31
00:02:00,743 --> 00:02:02,540
felt Winters was
a pretty good C.O.,

32
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:05,170
even if he could be a tough
son of a bitch sometimes.

33
00:02:05,314 --> 00:02:09,045
For his reputation --
you know, his family's sake.

34
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:10,709
Yeah, yeah, okay, but...

35
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:12,684
I still don't see
how he hit his head.

36
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:20,019
Slippery metal.

37
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:22,530
Bad footing.

38
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:26,133
Accidents happen, right?

39
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:00,530
Where the hell did
that come from?!

40
00:03:00,636 --> 00:03:01,694
Near or aft?

41
00:03:03,072 --> 00:03:04,937
Crew, sound off!

42
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,531
Get them out of there!
Get them out!

43
00:03:06,642 --> 00:03:07,540
O'Dell!

44
00:03:08,978 --> 00:03:11,446
Sound off, O'Dell!

45
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,919
-- Oh!
-- Sir!

46
00:03:19,021 --> 00:03:21,148
Fuck, was that you?

47
00:03:21,257 --> 00:03:23,191
The light!

48
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:46,843
We gotta get him out.

49
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:48,711
Come on, guys.

50
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:50,375
- How are we gonna...

51
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,789
Did you see that?

52
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:18,876
What happened, guys?! Come on!
What happened out there?!

53
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:21,848
-- Talk to me.
-- Don't touch me.

54
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:22,973
Did you fix it?

55
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:24,984
Which one of you boys
was screaming out there?

56
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:26,554
-- Are we a man down?
-- Don't touch me!

57
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:28,020
-- Are we a man down?!
-- Shut up!

58
00:04:28,124 --> 00:04:29,022
Who was screaming?!

59
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,093
Come on, grow some dicks
and shut up!

60
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:35,019
Now, where is Mr. O--

61
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:42,600
Coors -- where's Coors?

62
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:48,608
You tell me that's him.

63
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:51,271
That's gotta be Coors.
He's still alive, right?

64
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:52,937
Sir...

65
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:56,347
that is the one person
I can guarantee it's not.

66
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:08,725
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me!

67
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:10,025
-- Don't! Don't!
-- Hey, easy.

68
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:11,656
Easy, Stumbo.
Easy, easy.

69
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,667
-- Easy, easy.
-- Was that a "B"...

70
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:16,033
dash, dot, dot, dot?

71
00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:17,332
I didn't hear a "B."

72
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:21,334
Dot, dash -- "A" --
thought I heard an "A."

73
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:23,638
No, that's not morse.

74
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:26,077
It's just some shit
got caught up on the bow planes.

75
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:28,012
Now it's smacking up against --

76
00:05:28,117 --> 00:05:30,415
"C" -- you hear a "C"?

77
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,919
Dash, dot, dash, dot --
definitely a "C."

78
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:34,683
It's hull sounds.

79
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,520
You guys are getting lathered up
about hull sounds.

80
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:40,493
Now, would somebody please tell
us what happened to Mr. Coors?

81
00:05:40,596 --> 00:05:43,588
"Back" -- B-A-C-K.

82
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:44,393
He's back.

83
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,797
And where'd you get
the "K" from?

84
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:47,459
Dash, dot, dash --
while you were talking.

85
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,504
Hey, champ, you can stay
the hell out of this.

86
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:52,665
-- And the rest of you...
-- Enough, already, enough!

87
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:55,300
In the wardroom, 5 minutes.

88
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:58,209
Keep your mouths shut
till we debrief.

89
00:05:59,782 --> 00:06:02,012
Did you finish the job?

90
00:06:02,117 --> 00:06:03,516
Yes, sir, absolutely.

91
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,314
Right, Wally? Wally?

92
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:07,321
Oh, yeah, I'm finished.

93
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:11,549
All right, so, look,
if the weather is good,

94
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,651
we surface tonight,
we recharge the batteries.

95
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:15,491
We pour on the diesel,
keep pushing for the barn.

96
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:17,657
Our barn?

97
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:20,792
Mr. Brice, southern English
port's gonna be

98
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:22,928
more than two days away.

99
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:24,596
Two days away, Mr. Brice!

100
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:29,772
Kingsley here is a navigational
officer. He knows the way.

101
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:31,436
I know all the ports,
the depths,

102
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,480
where the submarine nets are,
the mine fields.

103
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:35,209
Yeah, and have
the R.A.F. bomb us

104
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:37,717
because they mistake us
for a hostile boat -- okay.

105
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,617
There are safety corridors
that we can use --

106
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:41,383
Considered and rejected,
thank you.

107
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,687
Mr. Brice, both our periscopes
are down, our sonar is gone.

108
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:46,920
We are blind and nearly deaf.

109
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,927
Our men are in a bad way,

110
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,759
and now we've lost
two of our senior officers.

111
00:06:49,865 --> 00:06:51,389
Welcome to the war, O'Dell.

112
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,229
This has nothing to do
with the war.

113
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:55,667
Just how much longer
can we not say

114
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:57,238
what we're all thinking?

115
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:02,834
No one wants to be the first?

116
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:04,913
Fine. Allow me.

117
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:06,675
This submarine is haun--

118
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:09,340
When I want your opinion,
Miss Page, I'll give it to you.

119
00:07:09,485 --> 00:07:13,421
I am not one of your men that
you can just dismiss, Mr. Brice!

120
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:17,448
I don't believe
we're alone down here,

121
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,959
and I know some of you think
the same way.

122
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:22,626
Unless we find
a safe harbor soon,

123
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:23,720
we're all going to end up like
your friend Mr. Coors.

124
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:26,062
The loss of Lieutenant Coors
is unfortunate.

125
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:28,636
It fails to affect our plans.

126
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:32,969
Attention all hands --
it's daylight now.

127
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:37,409
I expect to surface... at 1900,

128
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:39,071
recharge the batteries,

129
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:41,580
and proceed on base course
back to Connecticut.

130
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:42,582
- That is all.

131
00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:43,845
You're 10 seconds away
from finding out

132
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:45,681
what the penalty is
for mutiny at sea,

133
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:47,517
'cause that's how long
it's gonna take me

134
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:49,989
to open the armory
and reload that sidearm.

135
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,056
Now, do either of you
care to say anything else

136
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:57,826
that might further agitate
this crew or me?

137
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:02,563
Mr. O'Dell?

138
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:10,545
Yeah, I didn't think so.

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,558
We just knock the nose around
a little bit,

140
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,571
we're back on base,
so make it 2-8-5.

141
00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:38,731
Make it 2-8-5 true.

142
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:40,331
2-8-5 true, sir.

143
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:49,179
Heading home, boys.
Sound good?

144
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:51,081
-- Yes, sir.
-- Sounds good, sir.

145
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:03,456
Hey, you're oversteering.
Mind your rudder.

146
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:04,964
She's getting
some resistance, sir.

147
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:27,919
Chief of boat to control.
Chief of boat to control room.

148
00:09:36,698 --> 00:09:38,563
All right, belay that.
Belay that.

149
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:41,870
I said belay that!

150
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:44,600
-- Oh!
-- Oh!

151
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:59,786
Rudder at midship, sir.

152
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:11,423
Um, some...
kind of hydraulic failure.

153
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:13,091
Oh, Christ.

154
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:14,669
Must have overshot
our heading by --

155
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,795
170 degrees.

156
00:10:33,088 --> 00:10:36,285
Oh, good. A gun.
Yeah, I needed a gun.

157
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:38,450
I'll put that
with the prizes.

158
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,122
Okay, I got feathers, crosses,
and strip-show icons...

159
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,858
Rudder malfunction.

160
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:50,132
When we tried to shut down
the props, no dice.

161
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,763
Wouldn't respond.

162
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:53,899
We're on a runaway boat,
fellas.

163
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:55,772
Now, can any of you top that?

164
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:59,678
Well...
I had a strange thought.

165
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:00,839
Take a number.

166
00:11:00,983 --> 00:11:04,942
Yeah, but this one's
real creep-show stuff.

167
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:13,795
What if, when we took on
that kraut ship...

168
00:11:13,896 --> 00:11:15,523
...we didn't sink 'em?

169
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:21,795
What if... they sank us?

170
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:23,735
Oh, that's a good twist.

171
00:11:26,742 --> 00:11:27,800
I don't get it.

172
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,471
Might explain how that
dead kraut talked to Stumbo.

173
00:11:32,548 --> 00:11:33,572
I don't get it.

174
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:35,615
And the controls --
that they froze up.

175
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:37,116
No, they -- they rusted up.

176
00:11:37,219 --> 00:11:39,710
That's because we're at the --
the bottom of the ocean.

177
00:11:39,855 --> 00:11:40,753
Flooded out.

178
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:42,915
Of course, I'm not sure what all
that pounding was about.

179
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:47,257
Those are rescue divers...
pounding on the hull.

180
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:48,624
Only it's too late.

181
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:49,924
Shit, I get it.

182
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:50,599
Hydrogen from the batteries...

183
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:53,898
Hydrogen from the batteries...

184
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:57,563
CO2, ozone
from the electrical shorts --

185
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:59,436
that's what we're breathing
right now.

186
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,442
Like those deep-sea divers
that don't get enough oxygen --

187
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:05,069
head starts playing tricks
on 'em.

188
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:08,478
We got mechanical problems,
that's all, okay?

189
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:10,449
We always got
mechanical problems.

190
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:12,611
Now, please...

191
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:16,384
will you pinch this shit off?

192
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:18,618
-- Unless...
-- Oh...

193
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:20,627
It happened
during the depth charging.

194
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:23,129
Remember that one?

195
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:25,665
Rolled right down our deck.

196
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:35,839
So exactly how far
from England are we?

197
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:38,139
Can I ask why you're asking?

198
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,679
No.

199
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:40,679
Right.

200
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:42,716
Uh, what's our heading?

201
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:44,443
0-9-5.

202
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:47,716
Right. Uh...

203
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:51,888
May I ask why you're asking?

204
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:55,555
Just in case the boat
can't make it back home...

205
00:12:55,664 --> 00:12:57,564
for whatever reason.

206
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,226
What do you suggest
we do about it, chief?

207
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,295
Come on.
Enough of the guessing games.

208
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:06,306
-- Pressure blinding the shafts.
-- No, I don't think that's it.

209
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:07,807
Just lay it out for us, chief.

210
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:09,308
What about the I.M.O. pumps?

211
00:13:09,444 --> 00:13:12,242
I.M.O. pumps check out.
I don't think it's that either.

212
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:15,145
The rudder has a dedicated line
from here to the stern.

213
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,276
If we tap into there
somewhere aft,

214
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,980
I think we should regain
our steering.

215
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:23,353
But where are you gonna tap in?

216
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,857
That's the thing.

217
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,690
The line goes right through
the battery room.

218
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:29,889
That's a little dicey, isn't it,
without venting first?

219
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:32,489
Just threading up
new hydraulics, no welding.

220
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:34,159
Well, where are we at, anyway?

221
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,167
13 percent down.

222
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,830
-- 13 percent hydrogen?
-- Keep your voice down.

223
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:42,501
Look, I don't know any other
way to regain control --

224
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:55,754
Fuck if I know.

225
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:58,758
All right, but you gotta
make sure you're sealed off,

226
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,260
'cause we don't want a repeat
of the <i>Hindenburg</i> here.

227
00:14:01,363 --> 00:14:02,830
Let's keep this quiet.

228
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:10,429
As if it's a bloody
mechanical problem.

229
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:36,258
Fore door sealed.

230
00:14:37,365 --> 00:14:38,730
After door sealed.

231
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:16,862
What's happened here, hmm?

232
00:15:16,972 --> 00:15:18,599
What is this?

233
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:28,079
Go to the galley.
Get a cup of coffee.

234
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:29,878
Oh, no, I'm fine, sir.
Really.

235
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:31,714
You're falling asleep, champ.

236
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,015
-- I'll watch your bubble.
-- Yes, sir.

237
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,493
Lieutenant, a word?

238
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:40,791
Lieutenant, a word?

239
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,386
-- Not now.
-- No, Mr. Loomis.

240
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:46,897
We need to speak right now.

241
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:01,340
That is a whale, right?

242
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:04,384
What else would it be?

243
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:05,748
Come on.

244
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:08,288
Let's get that rudder working.

245
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,119
Now, maybe this is
just a coincidence.

246
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:12,193
I know Lieutenant Coors
wasn't too sure

247
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:13,921
about the last star fix.

248
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:15,587
But it sure seems like
we're going

249
00:16:15,697 --> 00:16:19,155
right back to where
we sunk that German ship.

250
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:20,427
Clear the compartment.

251
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:23,937
Everybody, give us 5 minutes.

252
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,165
Go!

253
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,410
All right.
We're almost all set.

254
00:16:30,512 --> 00:16:32,412
Just repressurizing the line,

255
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:34,846
see if we can't put the brakes
on this little joyride.

256
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,758
I'll reset the bus.

257
00:16:49,364 --> 00:16:51,298
Shit!

258
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,937
Hey, guys,
we lost power up here.

259
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,133
Shut that goddamn door

260
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:04,440
before I shut it
with your goddamn face!

261
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,111
What are you saying, O'Dell?

262
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:12,686
It's not a coincidence?

263
00:17:14,155 --> 00:17:16,020
Somebody put us on this course?

264
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:18,024
I'm just asking a question.

265
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:19,855
Let me ask one.

266
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:22,020
Where were <i>you</i>
when the rudder went over?

267
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,688
Huh?

268
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:25,459
This course heads back
to England,

269
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:28,229
and I've noticed you've had
a hard-on for anything English.

270
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:29,530
So where were you, O'Dell?

271
00:17:29,638 --> 00:17:31,697
Back of the boat... messing with
the rudder assembly?

272
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:32,898
Or did you get some motormac --

273
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:34,703
That is the craziest thing
I have ever heard!

274
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:36,367
Not as crazy
as what you're saying!

275
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:38,708
I'm tired
of this hoodoo horseshit!

276
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:40,542
It is <i>not</i>
what you think it is!

277
00:17:40,682 --> 00:17:43,276
It is not even remotely
<i>fucking</i> possible!

278
00:17:43,418 --> 00:17:45,045
Okay?!

279
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:13,646
After room,
get the chief to pick up.

280
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,180
Hoag!

281
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:22,514
Maneuvering room, respond.

282
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:32,494
Anybody, contact control.

283
00:18:58,493 --> 00:19:01,291
- Mr. Loomis, where's our crew?

284
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:05,060
It's warm.

285
00:20:48,703 --> 00:20:49,965
Loomis...

286
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:53,673
I-I, um...

287
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:55,504
Go ahead.

288
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,737
I'm gonna change up my scrub.

289
00:20:57,846 --> 00:21:00,815
Keep looking.
Gotta be somebody.

290
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,900
All right.
All right, chief.

291
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,774
-- We found you.
-- Don't...

292
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:06,437
Can you feel anything --

293
00:22:06,548 --> 00:22:09,016
your legs, your toes,
anything at all?

294
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:11,085
-- Don't...
-- Come on.

295
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:12,311
try to stop me.

296
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:13,852
You're gonna pull through.

297
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:15,855
Especially...

298
00:22:15,957 --> 00:22:17,948
- you.

299
00:22:23,932 --> 00:22:26,162
Time to go.
Battery's still working.

300
00:22:37,345 --> 00:22:38,676
What happened?

301
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,247
What happened?

302
00:22:41,115 --> 00:22:42,673
Sparks... the hydrogen.

303
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:44,478
Everybody... everybody's...

304
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:48,983
Loomis...

305
00:23:21,656 --> 00:23:23,385
Loomis?

306
00:23:26,194 --> 00:23:27,752
-- Sir! Sir!
-- Get out of my way!

307
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:29,989
-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-- Get the fuck off me!

308
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:32,897
Loomis!

309
00:23:33,001 --> 00:23:34,161
- Loom--

310
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,962
He's here.

311
00:24:21,482 --> 00:24:22,779
Did he even have...

312
00:24:25,086 --> 00:24:26,986
air?

313
00:26:02,383 --> 00:26:04,112
Not a bloody foot.

314
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,750
Come on, Stumbo.
Keep trying.

315
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,518
We gotta release that air.
Come on. One more.

316
00:26:14,095 --> 00:26:15,119
Come on, Stumbo.

317
00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:16,992
It's like it's welded.

318
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:21,827
All I know is what Coors
told me.

319
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:23,494
And apparently...

320
00:26:23,604 --> 00:26:27,938
Captain Winters wanted to shoot
the German survivors.

321
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:29,942
Mr. Brice and Mr. Loomis

322
00:26:30,044 --> 00:26:34,777
and Mr. -- Mr. Coors...
wanted to help.

323
00:26:34,882 --> 00:26:37,749
Apparently Captain Winters
lost the argument.

324
00:26:37,852 --> 00:26:40,343
Well, that's interesting.

325
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:46,987
But it's not what I heard...
from Mr. Brice.

326
00:26:49,397 --> 00:26:52,298
Lieutenant?

327
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,130
Are you sure he came back here?

328
00:26:55,236 --> 00:26:56,635
Looking for me?

329
00:26:58,573 --> 00:27:01,007
I, uh...

330
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:05,670
Just... reporting, sir,
that the heating is down.

331
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,079
And, uh...
the bow's levers are stuck.

332
00:27:09,217 --> 00:27:10,946
Stumbo's working on it
right now.

333
00:27:11,052 --> 00:27:12,747
And that we show
90 pounds of compressed air

334
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:16,288
still left in the system,
and I... wasn't sure

335
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:19,223
if you wanted to use that
when we tried to surface

336
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:21,227
or use it now
so we can breathe.

337
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:23,160
Shinola.

338
00:27:24,632 --> 00:27:25,792
Sir?

339
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,960
Running out of shinola, too.

340
00:27:34,942 --> 00:27:38,935
We also wanted to ask you
about Captain Winters --

341
00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:41,446
whether there was anything
you could tell us

342
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:43,016
about what happened that night

343
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:44,846
that might help us
to understand --

344
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:48,251
Don't pretend you don't know.

345
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:50,914
Just don't pretend anymore.

346
00:27:57,398 --> 00:27:59,161
Well, wasn't that awkward?

347
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:03,135
Maybe Hoag was right.
Maybe we already bought it.

348
00:28:03,237 --> 00:28:08,539
If not the depth charge,
then... the hydrogen.

349
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,474
If not the hydrogen, then...

350
00:28:10,578 --> 00:28:12,478
maybe the cold.

351
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,706
And if not that,

352
00:28:13,814 --> 00:28:17,045
then we got a big evil spirit
batting cleanup.

353
00:28:17,151 --> 00:28:19,711
-- Jesus Christ.
-- Come on, Stumbo.

354
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,846
There should only be
so many ways a guy can die.

355
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,981
Listen to me.
CO2 hangs low.

356
00:28:25,126 --> 00:28:27,856
It starts from the floor up,
and I need you right now...

357
00:28:27,962 --> 00:28:29,520
-- No, no.
-- to get up on your feet.

358
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,621
-- Maybe I just need to...
-- Stumbo. Stumbo!

359
00:28:31,732 --> 00:28:33,962
-- Let me try.
-- We already bought it.

360
00:28:34,068 --> 00:28:35,535
Come on, Stumbo. Head up.

361
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:37,536
-- Over and over...
-- I need you to sit up.

362
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:39,503
-- over and over again.
-- Look at me.

363
00:28:39,607 --> 00:28:41,074
Now look at me.
Look at me.

364
00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:42,733
- Good.

365
00:28:44,478 --> 00:28:45,911
Feel that?

366
00:28:46,013 --> 00:28:47,810
Well, you're alive, then,
aren't you?

367
00:28:47,915 --> 00:28:49,382
You fuckin'...

368
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:51,417
-- Stumbo...
-- Whoa, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

369
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:53,987
-- Take it easy! Hey!
-- Relax, man!

370
00:28:54,088 --> 00:28:55,817
Stumbo!

371
00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:58,858
Isn't there a winch or a pulley

372
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,985
or maybe a come-along
in a bowsman's locker?

373
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:02,152
-- Yeah.
-- Can't we use that?

374
00:29:02,296 --> 00:29:03,695
You know what he's
talking about, Stumbo?

375
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:05,163
-- Yeah.
-- Well, come on.

376
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:07,734
Come -- we need it. Come on.
Show -- show me, Stumbo.

377
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:09,894
We've got to get it.
Okay, come on. Come on.

378
00:29:13,474 --> 00:29:15,806
So, tell me
why three officers

379
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,879
would conspire to kill
their captain

380
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,210
and cover it up.

381
00:29:21,315 --> 00:29:23,442
That's what you're thinking,
isn't it?

382
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:25,109
What if I am?

383
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:27,380
I can see I'm not the only one.

384
00:29:29,957 --> 00:29:32,482
Loomis was up
for a major citation.

385
00:29:32,627 --> 00:29:34,561
And Brice was ready
for his own command.

386
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:36,960
He was from a naval family.
He went to Annapolis.

387
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:39,498
Coors had this beautiful girl
waiting for him back in Boston

388
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,329
that he was always
talking about, Claire.

389
00:29:41,435 --> 00:29:43,903
These guys had everything
to live for.

390
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:48,465
By that reasoning...
they had everything to lose.

391
00:29:54,548 --> 00:29:56,778
Are we missing somebody?

392
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:14,901
Wallace...

393
00:30:17,004 --> 00:30:18,471
Wallace?

394
00:30:20,074 --> 00:30:21,006
- No!

395
00:30:21,108 --> 00:30:22,598
-- No! No!
-- Shh!

396
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,042
-- No-o-o!
-- It's just us.

397
00:30:25,146 --> 00:30:27,137
It's just... us.

398
00:30:27,248 --> 00:30:29,739
- Now, listen...

399
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,318
We're running out of plays
in the playbook.

400
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,150
Do you have... any idea
why the boat is going back

401
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:38,122
or how we can get control
of it?

402
00:30:39,393 --> 00:30:41,520
I've been checking the
literature on this subject.

403
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:43,859
And the thing we know
about maledictions is --

404
00:30:43,964 --> 00:30:45,022
Maledictions?

405
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:46,258
Look it up.

406
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,562
Maledictions don't issue
from Heaven or Hell

407
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:51,137
but from some unresolved place
in between.

408
00:30:51,238 --> 00:30:52,830
In fact, there's a great --

409
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,170
Wallace...
we're running out of air.

410
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:00,179
Suffice to say...

411
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:04,775
the malediction needs
satisfaction

412
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:07,615
in order to escape
its netherworld.

413
00:31:07,755 --> 00:31:10,451
And if you had to guess...

414
00:31:10,591 --> 00:31:14,118
what would satisfy
our malediction?

415
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:16,229
Old Man Winters never
got a chance

416
00:31:16,363 --> 00:31:17,796
to go down with the ship,
did he?

417
00:31:26,941 --> 00:31:28,340
Wallace, leave yours here.

418
00:31:28,442 --> 00:31:30,535
We gotta dig up
some more light.

419
00:31:30,644 --> 00:31:31,941
Okay, listen, uh...

420
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:36,346
Just... Just promise me
you'll stay on your feet, okay?

421
00:31:49,063 --> 00:31:50,792
"Don't pretend..."

422
00:31:50,898 --> 00:31:57,531
"Don't pretend
you don't... know."

423
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:15,641
2230 hours: Sight target

424
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:17,410
believed to be
German sub tender.

425
00:33:17,518 --> 00:33:20,180
Winters orders flank speed
to close target

426
00:33:20,287 --> 00:33:22,221
and gain a firing angle.

427
00:33:22,323 --> 00:33:25,417
2315: Loomis checks
target profile against I.D. log,

428
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:29,427
matching it to target, and
I personally verify the match.

429
00:33:30,598 --> 00:33:35,035
2320: Single torpedo fired
from number-4 tube.

430
00:33:37,438 --> 00:33:41,738
Heard the strike, followed by
collapsing bulkheads.

431
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:45,243
2330 hours: To confirm sinking
of German ship,

432
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:47,337
four officers go topside --

433
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:50,508
Commander Winters,
myself, Lieutenant Loomis,

434
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:52,745
and Lieutenant
J.G. Stephen Coors.

435
00:33:52,853 --> 00:33:55,083
"Many bodies in the water."

436
00:33:59,493 --> 00:34:01,586
"Ship burning on the horizon."

437
00:35:58,412 --> 00:36:00,505
What are you doing in here?

438
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:03,447
Go.

439
00:36:07,154 --> 00:36:08,883
A German ship...

440
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:11,287
of the type
Brice said you sunk.

441
00:36:12,993 --> 00:36:17,657
My ship --
the Fort James hospital ship.

442
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:20,325
So what you're saying is...

443
00:36:20,434 --> 00:36:23,870
that the submarine
Kingsley saw...

444
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:26,531
the one
he thought was German...

445
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,868
Wasn't.

446
00:36:30,978 --> 00:36:32,172
So it was an accident?

447
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:34,941
Not when he left us
in the water to die.

448
00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:38,177
Not when he heard the cries
for help in English.

449
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:39,183
You actually believe

450
00:36:39,286 --> 00:36:41,379
that Captain Winters would
just leave --

451
00:36:41,488 --> 00:36:43,956
Help! Help me!

452
00:36:44,058 --> 00:36:45,616
No.

453
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:49,354
Captain Winters wanted to
pick up the survivors.

454
00:36:50,464 --> 00:36:51,362
That means...

455
00:36:51,465 --> 00:36:53,695
Help!

456
00:36:58,472 --> 00:37:00,406
Who mis-I.D.'d the ship?

457
00:37:01,975 --> 00:37:04,273
Who had everything to lose?

458
00:37:23,897 --> 00:37:26,957
Either the battery has
finally crapped out, or...

459
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:28,694
Or maybe we're here.

460
00:37:37,511 --> 00:37:39,536
Come on.
Let's get some air going.

461
00:37:40,848 --> 00:37:43,078
- All right.

462
00:37:43,183 --> 00:37:44,946
Come on, everybody, pull!
Come on!

463
00:37:49,056 --> 00:37:50,853
Come on! Pull!

464
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:01,733
Fuck me. This is it.

465
00:38:01,835 --> 00:38:04,099
-- Oh!
-- God, I hate being right.

466
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,064
- Pull!

467
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,886
Kingsley.

468
00:38:30,097 --> 00:38:31,325
Oh, Jesus, God,
we're going down.

469
00:38:37,671 --> 00:38:39,366
It's going up.

470
00:38:39,473 --> 00:38:40,497
It's going up!

471
00:39:35,095 --> 00:39:38,189
- Okay. All right.

472
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:41,893
Wallace, see if you can work the
radar, get a sweep of the area.

473
00:39:42,002 --> 00:39:44,300
Stumbo, see if you can crack
this hatch. Use a crowbar.

474
00:39:44,404 --> 00:39:46,372
Drain the tower.
See if we can get out that way.

475
00:39:46,473 --> 00:39:48,134
If not, we gotta go out
the forward --

476
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:03,686
Oh, God.

477
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:08,056
Hey, fellas...
we have contact.

478
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:11,221
On SJ radar --
4,000 yards, starboard beam.

479
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:16,894
It's the same one?
It's the same kraut ship?

480
00:40:17,004 --> 00:40:19,529
-- Are we being choosy?
-- All right.

481
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,198
Uh, Wallace, raise the antenna.

482
00:40:21,308 --> 00:40:23,003
Issue a radio challenge
on the Ariel-6.

483
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,509
Get the ship I.D.'d
as of right now.

484
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:25,805
Well done, Mr. O'Dell.

485
00:40:33,587 --> 00:40:35,555
But I'm feeling
much better now.

486
00:40:49,169 --> 00:40:51,467
You were saying?

487
00:40:51,571 --> 00:40:53,198
We have a contact.

488
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,335
That may be an opportunity.

489
00:40:56,443 --> 00:40:58,308
An opportunity?

490
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:00,744
To abandon ship.

491
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:03,680
Well, I don't know that
that's a friendly out there.

492
00:41:03,784 --> 00:41:04,842
Well, neither do I.

493
00:41:04,951 --> 00:41:07,112
But it seems better to scuttle
now and take our chances

494
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,017
with a surface vessel,
even if it is German.

495
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:10,783
Scuttle and tell Connecticut
what?

496
00:41:10,891 --> 00:41:13,291
We sunk one of their
finest fleet submarines

497
00:41:13,393 --> 00:41:15,452
because we lost a few men
carrying out our mission?

498
00:41:15,595 --> 00:41:17,153
A few men, sir?

499
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:22,792
Contact at 2,500 yards.

500
00:41:22,936 --> 00:41:24,164
Might cross the stern.

501
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:26,501
We'll wait... right here.

502
00:41:29,443 --> 00:41:33,072
Wallace... no matter what
Mr. Brice says,

503
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,807
I want you to go
to the radio shack

504
00:41:34,915 --> 00:41:37,543
and establish a voice contact
with that ship immediately.

505
00:41:37,651 --> 00:41:38,982
You are not the skipper
of this ship, Mr. O'Dell!

506
00:41:39,086 --> 00:41:40,986
And neither are you, sir!

507
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:11,146
Rain squall.

508
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:15,887
With a little luck, they
won't see us in all this...

509
00:42:15,989 --> 00:42:18,116
- weather.

510
00:42:46,887 --> 00:42:48,184
Here!

511
00:42:48,288 --> 00:42:50,188
Please!

512
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:51,814
We're over here!

513
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:54,859
Please!

514
00:42:54,961 --> 00:42:57,020
Help, please!

515
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:58,688
Help!

516
00:42:58,799 --> 00:43:00,994
On your starboard side!

517
00:43:07,073 --> 00:43:09,769
It's really not safe up here,
Miss Page.

518
00:43:15,015 --> 00:43:17,711
We're going below now!

519
00:43:17,851 --> 00:43:19,216
Aah!

520
00:43:24,858 --> 00:43:27,418
Bury everybody
and bury the truth --

521
00:43:27,527 --> 00:43:28,926
is that it, Brice?!

522
00:43:31,765 --> 00:43:33,494
Like this.

523
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,864
This is how I go.

524
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:40,397
If that's your plan...

525
00:43:40,507 --> 00:43:43,237
get on with it,
you fucking coward!

526
00:43:50,817 --> 00:43:54,048
Stumbo, man the ports.
Get ready to scuttle this boat!

527
00:43:55,822 --> 00:43:57,050
Just leave!

528
00:43:57,157 --> 00:43:58,954
They'll blame it on a U-boat!

529
00:44:00,527 --> 00:44:03,394
Just get out of here!
They'll never fuckin' know!

530
00:44:03,497 --> 00:44:05,226
Any more advice for me, champ?

531
00:44:18,278 --> 00:44:20,473
500 yards and closing!

532
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,605
Looks like we're definitely
gonna lose some paint

533
00:44:22,716 --> 00:44:23,774
on this one, sir!

534
00:44:23,884 --> 00:44:26,944
I kept looking for some way
just...

535
00:44:27,087 --> 00:44:30,215
just to... take it back,

536
00:44:30,323 --> 00:44:32,348
to make it end right --

537
00:44:32,492 --> 00:44:35,791
some way without
dishonoring Winters.

538
00:44:40,367 --> 00:44:43,495
I was gonna wear this uniform
back to port.

539
00:44:44,905 --> 00:44:46,873
Now...

540
00:44:52,779 --> 00:44:54,838
What should I do, Miss Page?

541
00:44:54,948 --> 00:44:58,281
You give me the light
so that I can signal for help.

542
00:44:58,418 --> 00:44:59,680
I don't...

543
00:45:01,655 --> 00:45:03,623
God, I don't know!

544
00:45:40,727 --> 00:45:43,321
I just figured out
why he didn't kill me, too.

545
00:45:44,397 --> 00:45:45,830
He didn't have to.

546
00:46:05,018 --> 00:46:08,419
Aah!

547
00:46:31,244 --> 00:46:34,475
Hey! Over here!

548
00:46:34,581 --> 00:46:36,173
Come back!

549
00:46:36,316 --> 00:46:39,046
Come back.

550
00:47:44,884 --> 00:47:49,821
Well, you weren't the first
woman that ever slapped me,

551
00:47:49,923 --> 00:47:51,948
and you won't be the last.

552
00:47:52,092 --> 00:47:55,118
But that was a good thing
you done for me back there.

553
00:47:57,063 --> 00:47:58,360
Well done, Miss Page.

554
00:48:01,568 --> 00:48:04,298
Well done, Mr. Stumbo.

555
00:48:06,306 --> 00:48:09,104
Dead but not buried, I see.

556
00:48:12,245 --> 00:48:13,177
Pardon me?

557
00:48:13,279 --> 00:48:14,940
Your vessel.

558
00:48:46,012 --> 00:48:50,472
So, what would you say
if you had to explain it all?

559
00:48:51,584 --> 00:48:54,212
Does seem rather unlikely now,
doesn't it?

560
00:48:57,357 --> 00:48:59,587
Have you thought that...

561
00:48:59,692 --> 00:49:01,592
that maybe
when Captain Winters died,

562
00:49:01,694 --> 00:49:05,425
he just... died, and that was it?

563
00:49:05,532 --> 00:49:07,432
And the rest...

564
00:49:09,068 --> 00:49:11,002
And the rest...

565
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:13,836
I don't know.

566
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:19,979
You say whatever
you have to say, ensign.

567
00:49:21,247 --> 00:49:25,047
I'll always believe we were
brought back here for a reason.
