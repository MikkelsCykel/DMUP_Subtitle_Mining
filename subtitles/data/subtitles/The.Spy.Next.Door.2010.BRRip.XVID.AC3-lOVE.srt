00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:56,846
Mom! Jethro's eating my underwear!

2
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,182
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy. Jethro.

3
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,187
Mom, before she starts,
there isn't a shred of evidence

4
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,728
- to support her allegations.
- Gillian, your son is a psycho.

5
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:14,562
- He booby-trapped my hair dryer.
- Nice hypothesis, but you can't prove it.

6
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:19,397
- Yeah, but I can hurt you.
- Mom! Mom! She needs to be medicated.

7
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,833
- Come on, Jethro.
- Come here.

8
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,978
I hate this family. Come here.

9
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,581
Jethro, you're getting a time out.

10
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,155
Come on, guys. Backpack.

11
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:54,062
- What? It's in style.
- It's inappropriate. Go put on some jeans.

12
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,505
And spit out the gum.

13
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,114
So, what color do you want to wear today?

14
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,715
Eed? Blue? Purple?

15
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,917
Pink, Momma, pink.

16
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,557
- Farren.
- What? You said jeans.

17
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,618
I meant in your size.

18
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:20,798
Come on, guys. Come on.
We don't want to be late. There you go.

19
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,832
Come on, sweetie.

20
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,143
- No!
- Get out!

21
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,279
No fighting.

22
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,956
Allow me.

23
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,458
- Hi.
- Hi.

24
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,431
- Are we still on for dinner?
- I'll be there.

25
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,030
We have an audience.

26
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,964
- Yuck. I'm going to vomit.
- He is such a loser.

27
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,008
I like Bob. He's nice.

28
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,169
He's a boring pen importer.
He does the same routine every day.

29
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,146
- He's like a robot.
- That's 'cause he is a robot.

30
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:14,118
A cyborg, sent from the future,
to destroy humanity. Starting with us.

31
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,789
Well, it's been three months.
Happy anniversary.

32
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,466
What is it?

33
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,339
I have to tell you about my job.

34
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,074
This might shock you,

35
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:43,978
but you should know everything
before this relationship goes further.

36
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,679
- Don't, Bob.
- What?

37
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,188
I'm very happy when I'm with you.

38
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,155
No one has ever made me laugh like you do,

39
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,358
and if I were a single woman,
I could see a real future for us.

40
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,431
But I'm a package deal.

41
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,925
What do you mean?

42
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,761
My kids are my priority and...
How can I put this gently?

43
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,931
- They hate me.
- Yeah.

44
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,374
- I can make them like me.
- See?

45
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,846
You can't make kids like you,
not mine or anyone's.

46
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,847
My kids have been through a lot, and...

47
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:26,220
I don't think we should take the next step
until they warm up to you.

48
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,054
Doesn't your happiness count?

49
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,662
Excuse me.

50
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,799
Sorry, I gotta go. Emergency at work.

51
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,002
- No ink?
- It's much bigger.

52
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,739
Sorry, really.
I will explain everything tomorrow.

53
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,240
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

54
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,200
- What took you so long to get here?
- Six minutes.

55
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,933
- You stop for a latte?
- I get it. You're...

56
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:18,339
- What's the expression? Chopping my bust.
- Close enough.

57
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,675
Poldark and a couple other Eusskys
just went in the refinery.

58
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,583
Then I was right. He's planning something.

59
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,081
Maybe they just want to fill up
their gas tanks for free.

60
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,417
- I couldn't blame them.
- No, that man's so crooked,

61
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,923
he could eat nails and poop corkscrews.

62
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,549
You're the world's foremost authority
on Poldark.

63
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,991
What do you think he's up to?

64
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,655
If his mission is to sabotage
the world's oil reserves,

65
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,825
why would he care about
some two-bit refinery like this one?

66
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,133
I'll make sure you get a chance to ask him.

67
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,853
How the heck are you going to get in there?
A jet pack?

68
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,814
It's in the shop.

69
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,105
Wait for my signal.

70
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,778
Yuri.

71
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,983
- What's this?
- C-4.

72
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,419
When we are done here, I want you
to blow this place to smithereens.

73
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:21,060
Hurry up. I don't have all day.
There is no overtime here.

74
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,417
Bob Ho.

75
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,733
I would love to chat, but I gotta go.

76
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,788
- Up there. Go, go, go, go.
- Move it.

77
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,892
- Move.
- Hold it. Stay where you are.

78
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,518
That was fun. A good aerobic workout.

79
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,764
We should do this again sometime.

80
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,663
Okay, Poldark, let's go.

81
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,596
We have suspect in custody.

82
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,476
Did you see the look
on Poldark's face, man?

83
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,415
Brilliant work, Bob. Unbelievable.

84
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,414
I really hate to see you go home.
You're the best agent I've ever had.

85
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,053
Hey, you know I'm standing right here.

86
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,022
Maybe I can get your government
to loan you to me just a little bit longer.

87
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,959
No. This was my last assignment.
I'm retiring.

88
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:36,034
- Don't tell me because of Gillian.
- I want a normal life. I want to get married.

89
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,365
Oh, heck, man. Don't get married.

90
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,666
Just find some woman
that you're going to hate in five years

91
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,707
and give her your house.

92
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,472
Keep the watch.
A memento, compliments of the CIA.

93
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,415
So, Gillian? Is that the woman
that lives next door to your cover house?

94
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:55,385
- Yeah, they've been stepping out.
- I could never give up this life for a woman.

95
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:56,646
We're spies, man.

96
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,384
Every little boy wants to be a spy.
It's the life.

97
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,120
All the hours you spend
sitting alone in a little room like this,

98
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,526
eating cold take-out food
in the back of a surveillance van,

99
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,154
getting shot at all the time,

100
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,825
learning how to pee in a bottle
in a moving vehicle.

101
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:13,135
- You're doing the right thing.
- Only problem is that her kids hate me.

102
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,598
You the man.

103
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,271
Eeally gonna miss you, Ho.
Good luck with those kids.

104
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,939
I've brought down dictators.
How tough can three kids be?

105
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,482
- Come on, Eingo, come on.
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

106
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,520
- Eingo!
- Don't worry. Come on. Come on.

107
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,681
- Come on. Eight here.
- Come on, Eingo.

108
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,291
- Come on, Eingo.
- Eingo.

109
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,620
Hi, kids.

110
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,563
I'm sorry about running out last night.

111
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,860
- It's all right. It's your job.
- No, it was rude.

112
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,565
I promise it will never happen again.

113
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,542
Mom, what about Eingo?

114
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:57,075
We've tried everything, sweetheart.
He'll come down when he's ready.

115
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,578
You want to see
what I've been working on?

116
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:00,982
Sure.

117
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:07,318
Eingo, Eingo! Come on, kitty.
It's not that far.

118
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,117
Please, please, please, Eingo.

119
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:18,970
There you go.

120
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,715
- So, what do you think?
- Well...

121
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,858
It's a work-in-progress.

122
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,258
Sadly, I didn't have any time
to work on it today.

123
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,693
Cat was on the roof,
satellite's broken again.

124
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,961
I spent two hours on hold
trying to get a repairman out here,

125
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,229
and I can't stop thinking about last night.

126
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,703
So, are we okay?

127
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,074
I understand.

128
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:02,375
If a man marries you,
he marries all four of you.

129
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,409
Don't forget the pig, the cat and the turtle.

130
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,851
So, do you really like it?

131
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,424
It frightens me.

132
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:18,029
Sometimes I think I found
the last honest man left in the world.

133
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,540
I brought you all cookies.

134
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,341
- Yes?
- Is it true? You're going to marry Bob?

135
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,575
- What? Whoa! Calm down.
- You can't do this, Gillian.

136
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,209
You're, like, so far above him.

137
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,255
What she means is he's boring. He's a geek.

138
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,325
He's a very nice man
who treats me very well.

139
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:51,223
- He's a pen importer.
- He's a cyborg.

140
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,231
You all don't know him like I do.

141
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,360
He's very passionate about the world
and about my art.

142
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,905
He likes to talk about history,
science and politics.

143
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,801
I see what you mean about
him not being boring.

144
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,972
What you all call boring, I call dependable.

145
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,415
For once, I'd like a man who goes to work
every day at the same time,

146
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,646
and who comes home every single night.

147
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:22,351
A man who doesn't lie, or cheat,
or leave his family the first time some...

148
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,940
My happiness counts, too.

149
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,409
I hate it when old people have feelings.

150
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,313
We gotta deep-six Bob.

151
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,228
- What's the story here?
- They hit Poldark's prison transport caravan

152
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,166
- at the edge of town.
- Tell me he didn't get away.

153
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,232
He's as gone as rum cake at an AA meeting.

154
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,772
I'm telling you,
this whole thing was a setup.

155
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,569
They knew he was coming.

156
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,139
Are you saying
there's a mole in the agency?

157
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,044
I'm not saying anything except he got away.

158
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,901
Welcome back.

159
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:53,446
Tatiana,
you can't imagine what it's like in there.

160
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:58,453
The oppressive darkness and the torture
of empty days stretching for years.

161
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,583
- Prison is hell.
- You were in there for four hours.

162
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,294
Enough tearful reunion.

163
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,334
I need a new batch of the formula
as soon as possible.

164
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,106
We'll run another test in two days.

165
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,675
I need a change of clothes.
Something current and fashionable.

166
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,311
And something to eat
that does not come with a toy.

167
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,052
The Sea Hag's made Olive into a zombie.

168
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,779
Honey, we're getting ready
to carve pumpkins downstairs.

169
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,746
- You want to join us?
- Absolutely!

170
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,012
'Cause I'm a loser and I have no life.

171
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,519
Did I mention we're going
to toast the pumpkin seeds?

172
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,215
Come on. I want you to join the family.

173
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,191
And I want some privacy.

174
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,456
- Don't get fresh with me.
- I'll use whatever tone of voice

175
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,431
- I want to use with you.
- Farren, I want you downstairs...

176
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,092
No, I'm not going to come downstairs
right now. Get out.

177
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,295
Farren, this is my house.
You will listen to me.

178
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,601
You don't own me. Get out.
I said, get out, Gillian. Get out!

179
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,265
Downstairs in five minutes.

180
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,470
I hate this house. I hate this family. Get out!

181
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,218
Me spinach!

182
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,552
No, she won't hear me. I'm on the roof.

183
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:20,154
It's like the only place
I can get any privacy in this loony bin.

184
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,357
I can't let Gillian marry this guy.

185
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:27,501
No, it's not that.
I mean, you're right, he is a total drone,

186
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,665
but that's not the issue.

187
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,675
What's going to happen
when my dad comes back?

188
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,605
He won't just leave me here alone.
He'll be back.

189
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:39,810
And if she's married, what happens then?
I don't know.

190
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,585
Mom, Ian's feeding Jethro bacon.

191
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,628
- Okay, that's just wrong.
- Why is it wrong?

192
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:13,814
- Ho, Bob Ho.
- Hey. So, how's it going with those kids?

193
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,077
I'm taking Gillian and the children
on a picnic.

194
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,122
I'm going to force those kids to like me.

195
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:22,455
Force them? You know, you might as well
try scratching your ear with your elbow.

196
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,023
Guess what? Poldark escaped.

197
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:34,137
- No longer my problem.
- Yeah, I know, but we recovered a file.

198
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,933
It seems to be an entry portal to a website.

199
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,101
We can't crack it.
I thought maybe you could take a look at it.

200
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:44,109
Hey, if you can figure it out, great.
If you can't, no harm, no foul.

201
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,880
As a favor to you.
Send it to my home computer.

202
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,511
Already did.

203
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:56,151
While I'm thinking about it, they suspect
there may be a mole at the agency.

204
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,622
- They suspect me?
- No.

205
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,427
You know Glaze thinks
you're the sharpest barb on the wire.

206
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,725
I have no idea what that means.

207
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,429
Hey, listen, man, have fun on your picnic.

208
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,066
Just shoot me back
when you check out that file. Thanks.

209
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,562
Puzzle encryption.
Let's see what you've got.

210
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,676
- Is it noon already?
- No. I have bad news.

211
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,544
- My father is in the hospital.
- That's terrible.

212
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,180
He plays senior softball
and he slid into third.

213
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,282
- Now he's having his hip replaced.
- That's terrible.

214
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:05,261
I have to leave the kids
and fly to Denver to take care of Dad.

215
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,031
- That's great.
- What are you talking about?

216
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,498
Let me watch the kids.

217
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,833
It would give us a chance
to get to know each other.

218
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:18,399
No, Bob. You? Them? I don't know.

219
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,907
My aunt's flying in from San Antonio.
She's very good with the kids.

220
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,882
- She was in the military.
- Gillian, this could be just what we need.

221
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,383
You really think you can handle
that kind of pressure?

222
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,587
The driving, the schoolwork,
and then there's Halloween.

223
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,225
Getting their costumes,
finishing decorating the house?

224
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,386
No problem. Halloween is my favorite.

225
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,861
You have nothing to worry about.
They will be perfectly safe with me.

226
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,699
It's not them I'm worried about.

227
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,932
- You can't be serious.
- Isn't there any other option?

228
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,033
Foster care? Juvenile hall?

229
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,410
Okay. You'll be fine.

230
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,843
Love you guys.

231
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,384
- I'm going to miss you.
- Yeah, as proven by this total abandonment.

232
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,049
You'll survive. I'll buy you something
from the hospital gift shop.

233
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,717
- Bye.
- Bye. Love you.

234
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,920
- See you later.
- Bye.

235
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,529
So, is this exciting, or what?

236
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,034
Well, I'll just pack a few things,
and we'll go to your house, okay?

237
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,250
A Flowbee. I knew he cut his own hair.

238
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,826
Nothing telling in his DVD collection.

239
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,727
Standard action movies,
mainstream comedies,

240
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,665
no sci-fi, and nothing above PG-13.

241
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,194
Hey, his computer. Let's check it out.

242
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,831
Good idea.
There's got to be some dirt on there.

243
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,176
Fashion Armageddon.

244
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:06,614
I haven't forgotten, Colton.
I will look at the file.

245
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,210
But this is important. What is Halloween?

246
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,855
Farren, do you realize what this is?

247
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:19,794
It's got you all worked up.
Let me guess, a Klingon dictionary?

248
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,356
You have me confused
with an entirely different class of geek.

249
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,935
Stockholm GBH.

250
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,403
Grievous Bodily Harm, live in Stockholm.

251
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,804
This is one of the rarest bootleg concerts
in the world.

252
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:35,470
- Why does Bob have it?
- Who cares? I'm gonna download it.

253
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,346
This is my ticket to Coolsville.

254
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,894
This is what you bring me to wear?

255
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,229
You said you wanted current.

256
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,824
I look like the Fresh Prince of Belarus.

257
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,837
Send someone out
to get me something elegant.

258
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,437
What is this program you found?

259
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,604
I went on to download the formula

260
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,873
and found the site being accessed
by a third party.

261
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,446
If the United States or China
has the formula,

262
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,983
they can develop an antibody for it.

263
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,484
I'm tracing the ISP,
but it's heavily encrypted.

264
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,782
It will take me a while to track it down.

265
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,551
Find whoever downloaded my formula.

266
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,586
- Eetrieve it.
- And?

267
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,124
- Kill them.
- Thank you.

268
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,299
- What's up with you?
- I'm gonna kill you.

269
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,410
What? I'm gonna kill you.

270
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,412
Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
She's hurting me!

271
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,482
Hey, hey, hey.

272
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,182
Hey, stop!

273
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,688
- What's going on here?
- She threw a stink bomb in my room.

274
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,188
What? That's so not true.

275
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,249
So what, you're saying I threw
a stink bomb in my own room

276
00:24:56,461 --> 00:25:00,056
just to get you in trouble? Sad. So sad.

277
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,824
Hey, hey, hey.

278
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,161
Farren, I'm very disappointed in you.

279
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:08,471
You two should be in bed by now.

280
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:12,168
Well, if we finish our homework in time,
Gillian lets us stay up till midnight.

281
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,215
She also likes us to watch Adult Swim.
It's kind of a tradition.

282
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,946
I didn't really think this one through.

283
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:34,858
Nora, let's get ready for bed.

284
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,258
I don't want to go to bed.

285
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,741
Only my mommy can dress me.

286
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,504
Nora.

287
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,246
Here I come.

288
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,386
Hey! Come back. I'll get you.

289
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,087
Come back!

290
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:04,618
I got you. No, come back!

291
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,459
Nora.

292
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,528
Come on. Nora.

293
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,737
- Only my mommy can dress me.
- Come on, Nora.

294
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,071
Only my mommy can dress me!

295
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,202
Only mommy can dress me!

296
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,743
You.

297
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:34,123
Can your mommy do that? Sleep.

298
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,417
Get out!

299
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,956
- Hello?
- You're alive. That's a good sign.

300
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:17,458
- How are the kids?
- We had a great night. Easy as pie.

301
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,100
Eeally? You're with my kids, right?

302
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,335
Bob, the other night at dinner,

303
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:29,311
you were gonna say something
about your job, and I cut you off.

304
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,108
You want to tell me now?

305
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,749
It can wait until you get back.

306
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:42,290
- I really think this was a good idea.
- I'm sure the worst is behind us.

307
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,213
Just a second.

308
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,566
I got it.

309
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,934
Fire!

310
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,947
Big mistake.

311
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,456
Everything will be fine. Oatmeal's ready.

312
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,090
- Shotgun.
- It's not your day.

313
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,693
You sure your mother
lets you go to school like that?

314
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,029
Duh, Bob.

315
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,332
"Duh, Bob. "

316
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:15,375
- Bye.
- Well, you guys have a nice day.

317
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:21,219
- Hi.
- That is so cute.

318
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,759
So what do you do all day?

319
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,059
Nothing. I'm four.

320
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,272
- You're full of it.
- Yeah, full of it.

321
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,867
I'm telling you, I downloaded it yesterday.

322
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,311
Eeally? 'Cause if you really had,
that'd be pretty cool.

323
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:46,076
- Yeah, pretty cool.
- Let's hear it then.

324
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,481
You trying to pop our ears?
That's nothing but a bunch of static.

325
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,059
- I don't get it.
- I get it.

326
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:59,130
You're a pathetic little nerd and a liar.
Let's get him.

327
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,256
Wedgie!

328
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,336
Put me down! Put me down!
Put me down! Put me down!

329
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,301
Okay, you asked for it.

330
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:14,072
No! You guys are gonna hear from me
and my lawyer.

331
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,040
You'll pay for this,
each and every one of you.

332
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,058
So, tell me more about Halloween.

333
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,789
It's the best. You get candy.

334
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:36,857
Everyone pretends to be someone else,
and nobody knows who you really are.

335
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:40,032
Sounds familiar. Nora...

336
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:45,135
So, what do you want to be?
A Frankenstein? A zombie?

337
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,939
Sweetie, do you want to be a princess?

338
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,675
Yes.

339
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,179
Okay, princess.

340
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,122
Nora?

341
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:13,193
Not fairy. Princess. Princess.

342
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:15,733
Princess.

343
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,077
Pink.

344
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,339
Pink.

345
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,435
- Princess.
- It's too big.

346
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,600
Too big? Okay.

347
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,850
Nora? Nora.

348
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,723
Nora.

349
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,425
Nora.

350
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:22,934
Nora.

351
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,371
Nora!

352
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,651
Nora. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

353
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,454
Nora!

354
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,952
Nora. Please don't wander off again.

355
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:10,376
I'm sorry, Bob.

356
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,617
Let's go pay for your costume.

357
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,128
Yo, it's Ho.

358
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,664
Just hold him till I get there.

359
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:35,910
Can I just say before we begin that
only in the current distressed condition

360
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,380
of the American public school system

361
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:42,283
could I be deposited headfirst
into a garbage can,

362
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:46,255
and yet I'm the one who winds up
receiving disciplinary action?

363
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,259
Who exactly are you?

364
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,223
I'm his mother's...

365
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,160
- Neighbor.
- Neighbor.

366
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,996
I'm watching them for a few days.

367
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,196
Well, this is not the first time
Ian has been in trouble.

368
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,170
He gets in fights. He lies.

369
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,241
Hey, I don't lie.

370
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:08,642
You told everyone you invited
Selena Gomez to the spring dance.

371
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,845
Her appearance fee was an obstacle.

372
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:13,508
You said you spent New Year's Eve
at the Playboy Mansion.

373
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,916
Hey, pay-per-view high-def.
I felt like I was there.

374
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,825
I'm telling you, lying is a dangerous game.

375
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,532
Bob, you sell pens. What do you...

376
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,965
- Oh, no. That's them.
- Who?

377
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,970
The future felons who
put me in the trash can.

378
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,507
Hey, geek-boy,
we got detention because of you.

379
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:40,509
- Yeah, because of you.
- You're gonna pay for that.

380
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:44,012
- Gentlemen, we don't want trouble.
- Who's this? Your mom?

381
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:49,243
You wish. He's my bodyguard.
I hired him. You better watch out.

382
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,480
- That true?
- No. He's joking.

383
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,057
- I'm their babysitter.
- What are you gonna do?

384
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,485
Ask you politely to allow us to pass.

385
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:14,008
How humiliating.
Why didn't you do something?

386
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:17,543
Why did you tell them
I was your bodyguard?

387
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:21,379
You're right.
I guess it was too big a stretch.

388
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:37,198
Hey. How you doing? I'm Ian.

389
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:41,097
If I told you, you had a beautiful body,
would you hold it against me?

390
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:48,338
- At least you're not shy.
- I wanted to talk to her in the worst way.

391
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,410
Mission accomplished.

392
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,943
Come here.

393
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,784
You look so pretty.

394
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:05,455
Farren, I didn't know you did gymnastics.

395
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,361
Why would you?
You don't know anything about me.

396
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:12,798
You come over to hang out with Gillian,
and you never even talk to us.

397
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,131
Come on, let's go.

398
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,809
The woman's got a point.

399
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:30,385
I don't know who you are sending out
to buy my clothes, but I want them killed.

400
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:36,455
- You could go yourself.
- I'm the most wanted man in America.

401
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,225
I cannot exactly browse
the racks of JCPenneys.

402
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:44,761
Just give me something that will blend in.
Something extremely American.

403
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,997
Sir, we are ready to run the test.

404
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,665
Magnificent.

405
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:31,777
She must have plastic in her shoes.
It will eat any petroleum product.

406
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,917
We're working on that.

407
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,751
What happened to the bacteria?

408
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:47,388
They live as long as they feed.
Once the oil is gone, they disappear.

409
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,466
Just like my Jimmy Choos.

410
00:37:58,643 --> 00:37:59,837
Come in.

411
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,576
Listen, about today...

412
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,983
You could have stood up for me, you know.
I have to face those guys.

413
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,714
So face them.

414
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,949
Unless you want
to spend the rest of your life

415
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,117
with your head in the trash can.

416
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,993
Thanks for the advice, Bob.
All my problems are solved.

417
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,306
They assign this in middle school?

418
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,672
No, that's my pleasure reading.

419
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,813
You're smart.

420
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:42,407
You have a lot going for you.
Why do you make things up?

421
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,546
Girls aren't exactly
impressed by astrophysics.

422
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,752
Given the resources,
I could design, build and launch a rocket

423
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,660
that would accurately circumscribe
an orbit of the moon.

424
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:58,531
But other guys can, you know,
throw a ball through a hoop.

425
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,506
I don't want you to get in trouble.

426
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,675
I'll make you a deal.

427
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:08,040
If you try to tell the truth from now on,

428
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,113
I won't tell your mother about today.

429
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:11,476
Eeally?

430
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,550
Dude, that's almost cool.

431
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,518
You mean for a guy who sells pens?

432
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,153
Come on, kids, time for bed.

433
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,723
Come on, one more spoonful.

434
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,318
Nora.

435
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:17,139
This one I learned it in China
when I was young.

436
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,924
It's me. I need your help.

437
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,935
I had to make up
one heck of a yarn to get all this stuff.

438
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,308
What did you tell them?

439
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,474
Well, let's just say if I don't find some
weapons-grade uranium by dawn,

440
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,519
I'm in trouble.
What do you need all this for?

441
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,986
To get the kids ready for school.

442
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,953
Well, it's like my mom always used to say
when she was stationed over in East Berlin.

443
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,962
She'd say, "Spying is easy.
Parenting is hard. " Good luck.

444
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:56,744
Bring it on.

445
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:01,383
Farren, you've been in there all morning!
Let me in!

446
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,649
Farren, let me in.

447
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:08,414
Farren, let me in.

448
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:13,822
Farren, you've been in there all morning!
Let me in!

449
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,091
Farren.

450
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:16,990
Hey!

451
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,965
I guess it's my turn.

452
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,337
And, Farren, please put on a longer skirt.

453
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,004
This means war.

454
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,657
Nora?

455
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:05,940
Nora.

456
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,685
Stay with Bob.

457
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,487
Come on, Nora.

458
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,461
- Where is he?
- Hiding.

459
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,362
He's probably going to trick us
into opening the door.

460
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,298
Help me put this away?

461
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:13,080
Ian. You know the rules.

462
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,779
No soda upstairs.

463
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,513
What? How did you...

464
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,140
Breakfast is served.

465
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,112
Wow!

466
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,545
Nora, time for bed.

467
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,631
Night-night.

468
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,565
It's a school night. You should be asleep.

469
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,663
How'd you find me?

470
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:12,332
Call it a hunch.

471
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,858
Why do you call your mother
Gillian instead of Mom?

472
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,552
She's not my mom.

473
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,155
What do you mean?

474
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:36,596
My father was married before,

475
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,759
and my real mom died when I was little.

476
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,564
Gillian is just my stepmother.

477
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:43,663
And Ian and Nora
are just my half brother and sister.

478
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:46,140
I'm like the freak of the family.

479
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,577
It must have hurt your feelings when he left.

480
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,443
He'll be back for me.

481
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,506
I know he's not
the greatest dad in the world,

482
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:57,212
but he loves me,
and he's not going to leave me here alone.

483
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:04,487
Anyway,

484
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,655
you should not climb the roof like this.
It's not safe.

485
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,029
Please don't tell me I can't come up here.

486
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:12,329
It's like the only place I can chill.

487
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,837
Actually, I was going to
offer to build you a railing.

488
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,735
Are you trying to bribe me into liking you?

489
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:21,902
I just want you to be safe.

490
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,476
Mind if I chill with you?

491
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,850
It's a free country.

492
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,391
Look at the star.

493
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:01,709
Good news. We got an address.

494
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,924
Good. Take some men.
Get that download back.

495
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:11,190
Tatiana.

496
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,987
No survivors.

497
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,298
Hey, boss. You like?

498
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,703
No like?

499
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,014
May I make a couple
of fashion suggestions?

500
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,823
Women don't like the shirt tucked in.
Mess up your hair.

501
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:47,395
- You know about fashion?
- No, but I know women.

502
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:52,932
Wear it like this.
It's cool, I saw it in a movie.

503
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:57,764
What movie? Octopussy? This isn't 1985.

504
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,033
- I almost forgot.
- What's this?

505
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:04,744
- Iggy Pop and David Bowie in Shanghai.
- What?

506
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,340
This is only about the hardest concert
to find in the world.

507
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:11,580
I guarantee no one else
in the school district has it.

508
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:15,320
- You downloaded this for me?
- Don't worry, I paid for it.

509
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:18,861
- How'd you even know about it?
- Easy. I was there.

510
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,870
Bob, you're getting too efficient.
We're half an hour early.

511
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:33,465
You're welcome.

512
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,505
Have a great day.

513
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:45,352
- Hey, cool look, Aaron.
- Thanks. It's Ian.

514
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,117
Whatever.

515
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,942
Have a great day.

516
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:19,879
Look, the talk on the roof the other night
doesn't mean we're friends.

517
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,287
God forbid.

518
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,444
We're here. There is nobody around.

519
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:50,486
I found the computer, but the file was
downloaded to an external storage device.

520
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,448
I can't find that.

521
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,889
I think I just figured out who lives here.

522
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,662
Agent Ho.

523
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:15,507
- Hello.
- You must stop shooting things, Antosha.

524
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:19,110
I said it would be bad
if the CIA or Chinese had it.

525
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:23,918
But he's both. Find him, but keep him alive.

526
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,555
I need to know who else he's shown this to.

527
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:36,663
Listen up. Now. Everyone in here.

528
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:43,029
We must locate Chinese Intelligence agent,
Bob Ho.

529
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:49,443
He is very tricky. The best at what he does.
He won't be easy to find.

530
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:51,139
- Ms. Creel.
- Not now.

531
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:56,015
Imagine you are Chinese, highly trained,
and you want to disappear.

532
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:59,020
I see him climbing with
a bunch of skulls on a rope.

533
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:03,320
Okay, he's not Conan the Barbarian.
Good try, though.

534
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:05,190
No, I see him. There.

535
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:11,827
Go. Go!

536
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,968
Don't kill him yet. We need information.

537
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:33,687
Go, Bob, go! Go, Bob, go! Go, Bob, go!

538
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,955
Come here, sweetheart. Get back here.

539
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,621
Come here!

540
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,433
Let go!

541
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:57,038
- Get the bad lady, Bob.
- Let go!

542
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,075
- Can you hold my turtle?
- Not now.

543
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,119
Yay, Bob!

544
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,920
That's it.

545
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:13,787
You will pay for that,

546
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,831
- little American princess.
- Bob, help!

547
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,378
Again, again, again.

548
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:37,720
Okay.

549
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:46,821
- Why did you pull us out of school?
- Who cares? We're out.

550
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:48,897
Why are you in the front seat anyway?
It's my day.

551
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:52,025
- No, it isn't. It's my day.
- No, it's not your day. You're the liar.

552
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:55,263
- No, today is my day.
- No, today is my day.

553
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:57,863
- You're a liar.
- No. No. No.

554
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:00,841
- All right, quiet!
- I'm still hungry.

555
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,784
It doesn't look like
they have chicken tenders here.

556
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,991
Wait inside. I have to make a call.

557
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,659
- This is Firefly.
- This is Bob Ho. I need help.

558
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,039
Yeah, so I get pretty good grades
at this university.

559
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,874
I'm top of the class.
I don't like to brag, but, you know.

560
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,006
- Bob, this is Larry.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

561
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:42,808
- Let's get some food.
- He goes to the university.

562
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:45,012
He's a poet. Isn't it cool?

563
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:53,890
It's rad. It's awesome. It's jiggy for shizzy.
It's the bomb.

564
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,291
- Let's go.
- Hey!

565
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,495
How embarrassing.

566
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:04,840
You know, most people don't like me
when they first meet me.

567
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:06,340
But Larry did.

568
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:12,406
I have two words for you, Larry. Thirteen.

569
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,333
I have to go.

570
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:37,263
All right, Nora. Come on.
You two stay at the table.

571
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:42,367
No, no, no.

572
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,275
I can't go in there.

573
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,783
Boys are pigs.

574
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,593
Careful.

575
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,844
And the lion jumped on me,
and I killed him with my bare hands,

576
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:18,641
and I saved the colonel's life.

577
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,716
- You're brave.
- Thanks.

578
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:26,717
How about this, Bob? The whole restaurant
and the waitress sat Larry here.

579
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,792
- Isn't it great?
- It's like it's fate or something.

580
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:32,121
Eeally, sir, we're just goofing around.

581
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:34,924
- Hey, Nora. Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

582
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,698
- Irish stew.
- Irish stew who?

583
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,431
Irish stew in the name of the law.

584
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:46,738
Larry was telling me all about
the university. It sounds great.

585
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,812
- I'd be glad to give you a tour sometime.
- When pigs fly.

586
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:51,744
It's not up to you. You're not my dad.

587
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:55,875
No, but I know that your mother
hasn't completely lost her mind.

588
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,452
It's just a tour, Bob.

589
00:55:57,554 --> 00:56:00,489
It's not like he's asking me out on a date
or anything.

590
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,784
Are you?

591
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:05,189
No, it's just a friendly offer.

592
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:08,458
Even if it was a date,
you still couldn't stop me.

593
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:16,799
- What's your major, Larry?
- English Lit.

594
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,401
Would you pass the soy sauce?

595
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:23,378
That way I get a background in the classics.

596
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:32,815
- You speak Eussian, Larry?
- What's going on?

597
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:55,910
- This is going to be painful.
- You're right about that.

598
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,013
Go, go, go.

599
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:11,123
Maybe you'll write a poem about this.

600
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:22,004
Goodbye, Larry.

601
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,018
Fine. He's too old for me.

602
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:44,116
Bob, I don't want to be a princess anymore.
I want to be a cyborg.

603
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,689
How did he find us so fast?
It doesn't make sense.

604
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,595
- Bob, what's going on?
- Please quiet, I'm trying to think.

605
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,031
What do you mean, you're trying to think?

606
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,968
- You just threw a man out the window...
- Who is he? What is...

607
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,403
All right, all right, fine. Fine.

608
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:03,142
I am international spy, on loan to the CIA
from the Chinese Intelligence Service.

609
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:07,740
Someone wants me dead,
and "Larry" was a Eussian operative, okay?

610
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,047
Fine. Don't tell us.

611
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,913
Cool.

612
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,262
Why would he come alone?

613
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:23,195
Stay here.

614
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,461
- Where are the kids?
- Inside.

615
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:31,603
Nothing else matters
until these kids are safe. Nothing.

616
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:35,144
Of course. Colton set up that safe house
for them like you requested.

617
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:38,806
- Hey, got that file on you?
- What file?

618
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:42,045
The one Colton linked you to,
from Poldark's computer, your download.

619
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:45,211
I didn't download it.
I never even got it open.

620
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:48,648
Don't BS me, Bob. It's classified material.
I need all copies.

621
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:50,692
Why would you think I downloaded it?

622
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:53,990
Unless someone told you I had,
someone who wanted it back.

623
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,190
Let's not make this thing
harder than it has to be, Bob.

624
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:57,960
Give me the file.

625
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:00,627
You're a career officer. Why do this?

626
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:03,433
I want out. Same as you.
We're both leaving for love.

627
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,907
Only I love money
and Anton Poldark is match. com. The file.

628
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,948
Wait. Take it easy.

629
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:20,890
Good work.

630
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:22,291
No.

631
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:31,792
Can I just say, you are by far
the coolest guy my mom has ever dated.

632
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:36,571
At least now I know how
that kid Larry found us so fast.

633
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:38,231
- How?
- The watch.

634
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:42,800
Glaze told me to keep the watch.
It must have a tracking device.

635
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:49,341
- Wow. You really are a spy.
- Gillian is totally going to freak.

636
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,238
What are you doing?

637
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:17,570
There's iron in these rocks.
It will hide the signal. Watch, please.

638
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,816
You realize if I told anyone at school
this story,

639
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:23,681
I'd get detention for a year for lying.

640
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:33,485
- Yes.
- Hey, partner. Where're you at?

641
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:38,861
- Why do you ask?
- I needed to pick up that file I sent you.

642
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,198
You know,
the one I wanted you to open for me.

643
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,572
Bob, you there?

644
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:49,872
Colton, I never thought
you would have sold out to Poldark.

645
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:54,541
Hey, that's crazy, man. Something's wrong.
We need to get together and talk.

646
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:59,248
- Nice try.
- Bob? Bob?

647
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:11,365
- We'll be safe here. I promise.
- This is your plan? Hide out in a hotel?

648
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:15,226
Doesn't look like they have
chicken tenders here, either.

649
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:35,351
This is awesome.
Can we order room service?

650
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,949
- Are you crazy? I'm going home.
- No.

651
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,793
- The only place you're safe is with me.
- Safe with you?

652
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:45,390
- Everybody's trying to kill you.
- I know. Isn't it cool?

653
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:50,163
Hey, Bob, if you want to marry my mom,
I'll personally write the invitations.

654
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:21,102
Love you, Bob.

655
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:37,479
Be realistic, Bob.

656
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:43,990
- Hello.
- Hi, Gillian.

657
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,822
Hi, sweetheart.

658
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,396
Yeah, Grandpa just fell asleep.
I was gonna call you guys.

659
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,563
I have to tell you something.

660
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,932
I know this is going to hurt you,
but I have to tell you.

661
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:57,562
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

662
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:00,932
- It's about Bob.
- What about him?

663
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:04,604
He's not who you think he is.
He's a spy, a Chinese spy.

664
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:08,081
And these terrorists are trying to kill him,
and now the CIA's after him, too, and they...

665
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:11,642
Farren, I know you don't like Bob,
but come on.

666
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:14,279
I'd expect this from Ian, but not from you.

667
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:18,486
What? No, it's true. He's going
to get us all killed. Don't you even care?

668
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:21,830
Farren, this conversation is over.
Put Bob on.

669
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:30,965
Hi, Gillian.

670
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:34,338
Bob, I am so sorry.
I don't know what's gotten into her.

671
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,413
- It's true.
- What is?

672
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,377
Everything she said is all true.

673
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,319
Whatever this is, it isn't funny.

674
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,248
The kids are safe, I promise.

675
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:50,189
I'll give them to you
as soon as you get back.

676
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:54,756
You're either telling me the truth
or I've left my kids with a nut job.

677
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:59,360
Either way, you should come and get them.

678
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:21,547
So, you got any other cool spy stuff,
besides the watch?

679
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:31,592
Don't touch. It's very sharp.

680
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:34,231
Cool. What else?

681
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:46,438
Cool.

682
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:04,265
Sorry, mister.

683
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:07,760
Airport. Step on it.

684
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,887
- Bob? Are you awake?
- Are you kidding?

685
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:38,530
- Does he always snore like that?
- Can't you hear him next door?

686
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:41,301
I always thought it was the pig.

687
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,404
It's over with you and Gillian, isn't it?

688
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:51,410
Yes, Farren, it's over.

689
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:56,748
- You win.
- Then why don't I feel like I won?

690
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,047
If you really loved her,
you wouldn't give up this easily.

691
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:07,123
It's because I love her and the three of you
that I have to walk away.

692
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:10,424
It's more important that you're safe.

693
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:15,661
I thought I could put my other life
behind me, but I can't.

694
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:20,168
Be glad.
You're lucky you're not joining this family.

695
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:27,645
You've no idea what it's like to live in
a place where you totally don't belong.

696
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,844
Don't be so sure. I was an orphan.

697
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:36,255
I was raised in a group home.
I never knew my parents, but I had a family.

698
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:40,185
I had dozens of brothers and sisters there.

699
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:44,692
And I wasn't related to any of them,
but I loved them all.

700
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,827
Family isn't whose blood you carry.

701
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:53,840
It's who you love and who loves you.

702
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:05,186
- Gillian!
- Mom!

703
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:16,030
Gillian, I'm really sorry about everything.

704
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:25,867
Tell me the truth. Are you really a spy?

705
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:32,175
Yes, I am. I was going to tell you at dinner,
but you stopped me.

706
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:36,911
I don't care. You put my children in danger.

707
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:39,348
Just go.

708
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,896
Bob, when are we going to see you again?

709
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:53,562
You're not.

710
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:08,441
Please don't go away.
Who's gonna sing me China songs?

711
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:22,028
- You'll be safe. I promise.
- Stay away from my children.

712
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:15,414
Dear Mom, I am very sorry,
but I cannot stay here.

713
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:18,715
My destiny is to be a spy, like Bob.

714
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:28,554
I am going with him.
Best wishes, your son, Ian.

715
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,904
Ho's signal just popped back up.
We got him.

716
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,643
Let's roll.

717
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:45,438
Bob! Bob!

718
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:48,600
- Ian.
- You left your watch.

719
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:51,272
What are you doing here? Let's go.

720
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,882
What do you mean? We just got here.

721
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:10,197
Bob Ho. What a coincidence. Tie them up.

722
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:20,403
- What are you doing here, Ian?
- I'm coming with you.

723
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:21,942
I want to be a spy, too.

724
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:26,803
Is this the bad guy?
I thought he'd be better dressed.

725
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:32,244
- How did you find me?
- I found one of your tracking devices

726
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:34,948
and put it in your pocket
when I hugged you goodbye.

727
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:37,218
- I'm impressed.
- Thanks.

728
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:40,853
- Can we go back to business?
- Would it help to mention I'm retired?

729
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,227
Eetired men don't download secrets.

730
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:46,096
- I never downloaded anything.
- He's lying.

731
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:50,329
Who are you going to believe?
Me or the traitor?

732
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:54,306
Someone has been a very naughty boy.

733
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:59,078
He's got cameras and microphones
mounted all over the place.

734
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:02,340
Good plan, filming us together.

735
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:06,114
- How could you turn against your country?
- It's simple.

736
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:08,685
I'm gonna be a billionaire.

737
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:13,490
That file that you didn't download?
It's a formula for a Growth Bacteria Hybrid.

738
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:17,554
This stuff literally eats oil.
Can you imagine?

739
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:21,935
Overnight,
all the world's oil supplies go poof.

740
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:25,700
All except for Eussia's.
It'll be priceless, right, comrade?

741
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:28,339
How did you get Colt to go along with you?

742
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,174
Colt? That hillbilly's not part of this.

743
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,941
He doesn't know what goes on
in the real world.

744
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:35,016
He still thinks wrestling is real.

745
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,847
Let the boy go.
He has nothing to do with this.

746
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:41,548
Mr. Chit-Chat just laid out our whole plan.

747
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:47,754
We cannot let him go.

748
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:52,098
- He will tell.
- Trust me, no one would believe him.

749
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,532
He's right about that.

750
01:12:56,805 --> 01:13:00,502
Hey, boss. Look at what I found
sneaking around outside.

751
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:03,604
- Farren?
- Hi, everybody.

752
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:06,337
Please, have a seat.

753
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:09,306
This can't be happening.

754
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:15,114
Poldark, let the children go
and I will find this GBH file for you.

755
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:18,551
GBH? Like, Stockholm GBH?

756
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:22,391
- How do you know that?
- No freaking way.

757
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:25,467
You're telling me all of this is
because he downloaded a bootleg concert?

758
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,034
You did what?

759
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,970
You downloaded it?

760
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:33,007
Wow, these companies take piracy
way too seriously.

761
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:36,236
You were messing with my computer?
That's private.

762
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,210
I just wanted to seem cool.

763
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:41,009
You don't need to. You are cool.

764
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:45,319
- You're one of the coolest kids I know.
- Eeally? Thanks.

765
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:48,948
Hey, over here. Man with a gun.

766
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:52,557
Wait a minute.
I am one of the only kids you know.

767
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:57,223
- Where is the file?
- It's on my iPod, on my desk at home.

768
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:03,364
Now, see, you want to be a spy.
Never tell the truth to the bad guy.

769
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:05,865
Sorry, I'm new at this.

770
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:10,505
Tatiana, take some men to the kid's house
and find the iPod.

771
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:13,472
What if the family is home?

772
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,878
Ever since you dyed your hair blonde...
Kill them.

773
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:21,547
- No, don't!
- Go, bring me that iPod.

774
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:23,480
Come on, go. Go.

775
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,667
Now, as for you...

776
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,100
Awesome!

777
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,149
Farren, let's go.

778
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:35,222
- I call dibs on the front.
- Then I pick the radio station.

779
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,199
Okay. Eeady?

780
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:43,771
Okay, hold on.

781
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:47,768
- Hello?
- Gillian, listen to me.

782
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:49,942
Goodbye, Bob.

783
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,881
Gillian, wait. Don't hang up.

784
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:07,452
Hang on.
We've got to get there before they do.

785
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:16,964
Is there anyone at the agency
you can still trust? Someone you can call?

786
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:20,633
Sure, but they tore out my cameras.
I have no proof of anything.

787
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:25,839
Except that, as it happens, I recorded
that entire conversation on my cell phone.

788
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:29,307
Way to go, dork.

789
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:36,657
Colt... Just listen.
I'm going to play you something.

790
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:42,725
That file that you didn't download?
It's a formula for a Growth Bacteria Hybrid.

791
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:45,163
This stuff literally eats oil.

792
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:50,961
What is this?

793
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:53,371
- It's Halloween.
- It's Halloween.

794
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:05,146
- Happy Halloween.
- Bob!

795
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:11,384
What are you all doing?
I thought you were upstairs.

796
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:14,125
- Everybody inside.
- Bob, we need to talk.

797
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:17,221
Mom, this isn't a joke. Do whatever he says.

798
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:19,698
- Okay.
- Come on.

799
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:22,293
- Get your iPod.
- His iPod?

800
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:24,463
- I demand an explanation.
- They're coming.

801
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:25,972
- Who?
- The Eussians.

802
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:27,041
Eussians?

803
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:46,092
I saw them outside. They're coming.

804
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,662
- Eussians?
- Yes, Gillian, Eussians.

805
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:49,822
Let's try and keep up.

806
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,699
It's too late. Everybody upstairs.
Understand me?

807
01:17:57,973 --> 01:17:59,304
Stay there.

808
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:04,536
Where's my stuff?

809
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:07,174
- Here, take some of this stuff.
- What is all this?

810
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:08,579
Protection.

811
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:13,354
Why do you have a lighter?
I don't want you playing with fire.

812
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:23,864
Okay, maybe just this once. Let's go.

813
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,262
Trick or treat.

814
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:58,231
Hurry. Close it. Close it quick. Okay.

815
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:17,416
- I forgot Chuckle.
- Nora! Nora!

816
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:21,979
What are you supposed to be?

817
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:26,254
A cyborg,
sent from the future to blast you away.

818
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:36,937
Mommy, that man can fly.

819
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:05,893
I can't believe you did this to my family,
endangered my kids.

820
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:08,367
I didn't mean to. I love your kids.

821
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,030
I want to marry you, all four of you.

822
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:13,198
And I wanted to marry you.

823
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,936
But our wedding gifts would have
to be opened by the bomb squad.

824
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:18,979
All right, Ho. Enough games.

825
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:30,956
I finally found a normal guy, I thought,
someone who likes to...

826
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:34,922
Can we talk about this later?

827
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:58,018
- He switched belts.
- Get him.

828
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:10,464
Give me the iPod, kid.

829
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:18,831
- Come on, let's TP the little geek's house.
- Yeah, TP.

830
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:31,849
Hey, guys.

831
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:34,915
Gotta go.

832
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:37,653
Maybe we should just stick
to stealing candy from little kids.

833
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:39,590
Yeah, real little kids.

834
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:48,968
- This is going to be fun.
- Hey, Larry. Knock, knock.

835
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:51,973
Yes!

836
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:12,684
Come on, guys, get in the room
and lock the door. Hurry. Lock it.

837
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:36,113
Irish stew in the name of the law.

838
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:40,181
Sorry your retirement was so short, Bob.

839
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:47,018
- You can kill me. Let the family go.
- I can't. They've seen too much.

840
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:49,096
But I'll let you go first
so you don't have to watch.

841
01:22:49,197 --> 01:22:50,596
Hey, mister.

842
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,971
Don't think this changes anything.

843
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:03,105
- Everybody freeze!
- It's okay.

844
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,643
They're the good guys.

845
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:13,479
You stinking lowlife. Come on. Let's go.

846
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:19,560
Mom!

847
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:27,924
Hey, loosen these things up.

848
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:31,335
I'm sorry. What's wrong?
Got the handcuffs too tight?

849
01:23:31,473 --> 01:23:35,432
I don't know how these things work.
I'm just a dumb hillbilly.

850
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:39,173
- Everybody okay?
- Bumps and bruises.

851
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,748
Ian, this really is the good guy.

852
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:47,246
Hey, what you got there, son?

853
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:52,217
Nice work recording that conversation,
partner.

854
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:55,555
This young man might make
a heck of a spy someday.

855
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:07,936
How quickly can you give me
orange jumpsuit?

856
01:24:09,944 --> 01:24:11,673
I'm sorry I suspected you.

857
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,645
Don't worry about it, old buddy.

858
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:16,308
Chalk it up to the language barrier.

859
01:24:17,018 --> 01:24:18,349
Thank you.

860
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:33,694
I'm sorry I put you through all this.

861
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,465
Goodbye, Gillian.

862
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:41,799
Goodbye, kids.

863
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:45,704
Bob.

864
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:50,476
I'm gonna miss you.

865
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:52,382
I'll miss you, too.

866
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,259
Wait.

867
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:05,622
I know he lied, but he did it to protect us.

868
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:09,601
This whole time, all he ever wanted to do
was protect us, Mom.

869
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:12,604
And, Mom,

870
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:21,079
you're never gonna find a man
as good as Bob, never again.

871
01:25:21,182 --> 01:25:22,479
Never.

872
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:26,382
I never thought I'd say this,

873
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:28,581
but I agree with Farren.

874
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:35,354
I suppose you have something to say, too.

875
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:37,829
I want Bob to be my daddy.

876
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:55,407
Do you, Gillian, take Bob
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

877
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:57,348
I do.

878
01:25:57,452 --> 01:26:01,320
And do you, Bob, take Gillian
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

879
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:05,453
Gillian.

880
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:09,227
There's one more thing I have to tell you.

881
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:12,594
My name really isn't Bob.

882
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,562
That's okay.

883
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,171
I do.

884
01:26:20,942 --> 01:26:24,469
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

885
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:40,857
Eeady. And action.

886
01:26:58,012 --> 01:26:59,104
And cut.

887
01:27:06,788 --> 01:27:10,315
No, that man's so crooked,
he could eat nails and...

888
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:12,325
Maybe he just wanted
to fill up his gas tanks for free.

889
01:27:12,427 --> 01:27:13,416
I can't blame him.

890
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:17,123
No, that man's so crooked,
he could eat nails and...

891
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:21,857
Sorry.

892
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:23,665
Sorry, mister.

893
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,649
All right.

894
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:41,982
What's going on?

895
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,923
Bob, I don't want to be a princess anymore.

896
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:47,256
I want to be a...

897
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:53,029
I'm an international spy, on loan to the CIA
from the Chinese...

898
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:56,235
From the Chinese intelligent... Intelligent?

899
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:58,464
- Intelligence.
- Intelligence.

900
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:04,105
Well, I'll just pick a few things
and move to the house.

901
01:28:04,212 --> 01:28:06,703
- Okay, cut.
- What does it mean?

902
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:11,275
I am international spy, on loan to the CIA
from the Chinese intelligent...

903
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:13,081
- What?
- Intelligent.

904
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:17,880
I've brought down dictators.
How tough to say...

905
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,550
- Yeah.
- Yes?

906
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,832
Maybe you'll write a poem about...

907
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:29,562
A poem about... A poem.

908
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:32,796
Maybe you'll write a poem...

909
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:36,137
Maybe write... I hate English.

910
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:48,947
If a man marries you,
he marries all four of you.

911
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,054
Don't forget the pig, the cat and the turkey.

912
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,219
And the turkey.

913
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:59,063
- Turkey? Where's the turkey come from?
- I don't know.

914
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:03,192
- Yeah, well, my grandmother's... Sorry.
- Okay, cut.

915
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,470
Grandmother's great. He plays...

916
01:29:09,644 --> 01:29:10,736
Let's cut.

917
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:14,042
When they forget a dialogue,
it makes me happy.

918
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:19,009
Good work. Come out. Camera needs you.

919
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:21,382
Come on.

920
01:29:21,789 --> 01:29:23,347
What are we doing?

921
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:26,894
What are you doing? We're filming.
We're making a movie.

922
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:30,494
Funny man. Funny man.

923
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:32,257
A camera mark.

924
01:29:33,257 --> 01:29:43,257
