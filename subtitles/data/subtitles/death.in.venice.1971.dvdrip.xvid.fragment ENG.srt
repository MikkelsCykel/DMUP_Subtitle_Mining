00:08:57,053 --> 00:09:00,022
Our best wishes
for a most enjoyable sojourn.

2
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:04,522
Let us bring our poor service
to your kind attention.

3
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,261
<i>Goodbye! Sorry! Hello!</i>

4
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,065
Your Excellency!

5
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:14,366
And by the way, sir...

6
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:19,798
our compliments to your little sweetheart,
to your pretty little sweetheart.

7
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,744
Our best wishes, <i>signore</i>.

8
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:30,647
Take me to the steamship landing.

9
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:45,227
l said, take me to the steamship landing.

10
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:52,339
The <i>signore</i> is going to the Lido.

11
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,702
l know that,
but first l want to go to San Marco.

12
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:57,075
l get the <i>vaporetto</i> from there.

13
00:09:57,246 --> 00:10:00,374
-But you cannot take the <i>vaporetto</i>.
-Why not?

14
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:03,884
Because the <i>vaporetto</i>
does not take luggage.

15
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:06,719
That is my concern. Turn around.

16
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:34,639
How much do you charge for this trip?

17
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:37,081
The <i>signore</i> will pay.

18
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:43,082
l'll pay you no penny at all unless
you take me exactly where l want to go.

19
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:44,955
You want to go to the Lido.

20
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:46,623
But not with you.

21
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:49,665
l am a good rower, <i>signore</i>. l row you well.

22
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:07,473
l don't understand it.

23
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:19,012
That gondolier is a bad character.

24
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:21,079
He has no license.

25
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:25,651
The other gondoliers telephoned. He saw
the police waiting and he made off quickly.

26
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:30,421
<i>Signore</i>, you had a ride
to the Lido for nothing.

27
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:33,190
<i>Will you give me something</i>
<i>for the trouble?</i>

28
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:37,154
Thank you.

29
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:02,111
Good afternoon,
Professor von Aschenbach.

30
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,211
Allow me to extend you
the compliments of the management.

31
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:07,016
<i>Professor Aschenbach's key.</i>

32
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:11,220
l hope the room we have reserved
will meet with your satisfaction.

33
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:14,285
<i>The hotel is extremely quiet.</i>
<i>Do not worry, Professor.</i>

34
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:16,331
<i>This is Professor Aschenbach's suitcase.</i>

35
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:18,992
<i>Your trunk, Professor,</i>
<i>will be delivered to you immediately.</i>

36
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:22,265
We have a marvelous beginning of season,
just a little scirocco.

37
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,306
l hope you will have a marvelous time.

38
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:52,263
Third floor. Please.

39
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:57,267
This side, please.

40
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:04,640
Come in.

41
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:10,340
After you.

42
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:15,185
l hope the flowers won't bother you.

43
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,256
<i>Professor Aschenbach's suitcase.</i>
<i>Right away.</i>

44
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:25,765
We have reserved the best room
in the hotel for you, Professor.

45
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,529
l hope you will like it.

46
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,939
You have a marvelous view of the sea.

47
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:44,345
Today the weather is not very good,
but tomorrow it will be better.

48
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:11,242
l hope you enjoy your visit...

49
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:15,613
and l hope that the room we have reserved
for you is completely to your liking.

50
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:18,383
Well, if you need something,
you call me, sir.

51
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,580
Thank you.

52
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:25,856
Your key, Professor Aschenbach.
308. Remember.

53
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:28,120
Excuse me.

54
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:46,074
He's going to be all right.

55
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,910
When do you think
he'll be able to work again?

56
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,775
That's difficult to say in cases like this.

57
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,656
l must say
he has no reason to be proud of his heart.

58
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:07,885
He needs to get away from it all.
A long period of complete rest.

59
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:24,100
Gustav?

60
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:59,046
l remember...

61
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:03,208
we once had one of those...

62
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,051
in my father's house.

63
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:13,691
The aperture
through which the sand runs is so tiny...

64
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:19,390
that first it seems
as if the level in the upper glass...

65
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:23,360
never changes.

66
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:33,610
To our eyes, it appears
that the sand runs out...

67
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:37,583
only at the end...

68
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,718
and until it does,
it's not worth thinking about.

69
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:53,193
Till the last moment...

70
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,939
when there's no more time...

71
00:21:03,145 --> 00:21:07,411
when there's no more time left
to think about it.

72
00:27:13,415 --> 00:27:15,576
Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served.

73
00:27:40,308 --> 00:27:43,971
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Dinner will be served in ten minutes.

74
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:47,013
l'm sure you will enjoy the dinner.

75
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:49,911
l have a good appetite,
l had a good walk today.

76
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:53,112
-What are you going to have to drink?
-l'll have some dry sherry.

77
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:54,348
All right, dry sherry.

78
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,583
What would you prefer as wine,
French or ltalian?

79
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:58,182
-French.
-French wine. And you?

80
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,591
l think l'd like my daughter to know
about Tocai....

81
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:56,608
<i>You are a bit tired. Pale.</i>

82
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,314
<i>lf you stayed more in the sun,</i>
<i>you would feel better.</i>

83
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,678
<i>You should take more care of Tadzio.</i>
<i>He is too tired.</i>

84
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:07,118
<i>Starting tomorrow, ma'am...</i>

85
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:10,624
<i>l will control more scrupulously</i>
<i>his rest time.</i>

86
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:15,288
<i>Understood? lf you keep getting so tired</i>
<i>your holiday won't do you any good.</i>

87
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:18,865
<i>All right. l'll run less starting tomorrow.</i>

88
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:21,763
<i>Don't forget about your promise,</i>
<i>sweetheart.</i>

89
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,139
<i>Good, my dear, we'll stay together</i>
<i>tomorrow morning.</i>

90
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:26,996
<i>Are you glad?</i>

91
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,138
<i>You won't get annoyed.</i>

92
00:30:30,678 --> 00:30:33,613
<i>l would like to have the children ready</i>
<i>by 9.:00 tomorrow morning.</i>

93
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:36,578
<i>l'll take care of it.</i>
<i>You can count on me, ma'am.</i>

94
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:38,885
<i>Let's join everyone at the table.</i>

95
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,788
Soup and fish. Nothing else.

96
00:33:06,768 --> 00:33:11,137
<i>Beauty. You mean</i>
<i>your spiritual conception of beauty.</i>

97
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:15,035
<i>But do you deny the ability</i>
<i>of the artist to create from the spirit?</i>

98
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:17,942
<i>Yes, Gustav, that is precisely what l deny.</i>

99
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:34,992
<i>So then, according to you,</i>
<i>our labor as artists is--</i>

100
00:33:35,063 --> 00:33:36,553
<i>Labor, exactly!</i>

101
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:41,726
<i>Do you really believe in beauty</i>
<i>as the product of labor?</i>

102
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,175
<i>Yes, l do.</i>

103
00:33:53,981 --> 00:33:55,812
<i>That's how beauty is born.</i>

104
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:00,382
<i>Like that. Spontaneously.</i>
<i>ln utter disregard for your labor and mine.</i>

105
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:03,015
<i>lt pre-exists our presumption as artists.</i>

106
00:34:40,194 --> 00:34:43,095
<i>Your great error, my dear friend,</i>
<i>is to consider life...</i>

107
00:34:43,631 --> 00:34:45,826
<i>reality as a limitation.</i>

108
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,027
But isn't that what it is?

109
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:50,636
Reality only distracts and degrades us.

110
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:03,712
You know, sometimes l think...

111
00:35:04,218 --> 00:35:07,813
that artists are rather like hunters
aiming in the dark.

112
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,358
They don't know what their target is,
and they don't know if they've hit it.

113
00:35:13,427 --> 00:35:17,864
But you can't expect life to illuminate
the target and steady your aim.

114
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:24,204
The creation of beauty and purity
is a spiritual act.

115
00:35:26,774 --> 00:35:29,242
No, Gustav. No!

116
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:33,839
Beauty belongs to the senses.

117
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:36,246
Only to the senses!

118
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:40,985
You cannot reach the spirit....

119
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,519
You cannot reach the spirit
through the senses. You cannot.

120
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:52,358
lt's only by complete domination
of the senses...

121
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:54,897
that you can ever achieve...

122
00:35:55,336 --> 00:35:58,931
wisdom, truth and human dignity.

123
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:02,432
Wisdom? Human dignity?

124
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:05,643
What use are they?

125
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:10,343
Genius is a divine gift. No:

126
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,284
a divine affliction.

127
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:16,952
A sinful, morbid flash fire of natural gifts.

128
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:21,427
-l reject the demonic virtues of art.
-And you are wrong!

129
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,991
Evil is a necessity.

130
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:29,092
lt is the food of genius.

131
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:40,136
<i>Tea is served.</i>

132
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:49,288
-Do you want some tea?
-Please.

133
00:36:52,326 --> 00:36:54,419
lf you want milk, help yourself to it.

134
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:56,193
Thank you.

135
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,813
You know, Alfred,
art is the highest source of education...

136
00:37:19,453 --> 00:37:21,751
and the artist has to be exemplary.

137
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:26,849
He must be a model
of balance and strength.

138
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:32,325
-He cannot be ambiguous.
-But art is ambiguous.

139
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:36,125
And music,
the most ambiguous of all the arts.

140
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:42,006
lt is ambiguity made a science.

141
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:44,400
Wait!

142
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:53,280
Listen to this chord...

143
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:57,146
or this one.

144
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,659
You can interpret them
in any way you like.

145
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:06,894
You have before you an entire series
of mathematical combinations...

146
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:09,530
unforeseen and inexhaustible.

147
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,940
A paradise of double meanings
in which you, more than anyone else...

148
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:18,467
romp and roll about like a calf in clover.

149
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:25,382
Don't you hear it?

150
00:38:28,022 --> 00:38:29,751
-Do you recognize it?
-Stop!

151
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:32,088
lt's yours! lt's all your music!

152
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:35,225
Good morning, Professor von Aschenbach.

153
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:37,024
Good morning.

154
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,497
How's the weather, sir?

155
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,131
The scirocco....

156
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:46,797
How long do you think it will last?

157
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:50,644
Well, you must understand, <i>signore</i>,
that the scirocco...

158
00:38:50,878 --> 00:38:54,905
blows for three days
if it starts on Tuesday.

159
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,509
Nine days if it starts on Friday.

160
00:38:57,685 --> 00:39:01,883
But if it hasn't blown itself out
by the tenth day, then...

161
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:04,786
it goes on for 21 days.

162
00:39:05,192 --> 00:39:08,389
Now, it began a week on Friday.

163
00:39:08,462 --> 00:39:10,692
That makes today the tenth day...

164
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:12,757
but sure the last.

165
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:16,560
Excuse me, Professor.
Have a pleasant day.

166
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:17,726
Thank you.

167
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,585
<i>Delicious, fresh strawberries!</i>

168
00:41:54,962 --> 00:41:55,951
<i>Strawberries!</i>

169
00:41:57,064 --> 00:41:59,089
<i>Get your fresh strawberries!</i>

170
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:01,156
<i>Strawberries!</i>

171
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:11,404
<i>They're delicious!</i>

172
00:42:26,694 --> 00:42:28,992
Bring me a chair and a table here.

173
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:35,395
<i>Delicious oranges.</i>

174
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:40,538
<i>-Lemons.</i>
<i>-Fresh strawberries!</i>

175
00:43:34,428 --> 00:43:35,588
Tadzio!

176
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,082
<i>Look! Take it!</i>

177
00:43:59,653 --> 00:44:02,247
<i>With this board, l'll make the drawbridge.</i>

178
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:06,123
<i>ls it okay like this?</i>

179
00:44:09,997 --> 00:44:12,625
<i>No. Put it a little bit more on the right.</i>

180
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,963
<i>-Like this?</i>
<i>-Yes, it's okay.</i>

181
00:44:15,035 --> 00:44:16,161
<i>Leave them in peace, Tadzio!</i>

182
00:44:16,503 --> 00:44:19,734
<i>lt's at least the fourth time</i>
<i>that they've tried to build the castle!</i>

183
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,471
<i>Leave them alone!</i>

184
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:25,111
<i>Those are childish games.</i>

185
00:44:25,846 --> 00:44:26,904
<i>That's fine.</i>

186
00:44:28,315 --> 00:44:30,545
<i>lt's better if we go for a walk.</i>

187
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,314
Hello. What's going on there anyway?

188
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,880
-...my husband.
-Yes.

189
00:44:41,362 --> 00:44:43,694
-Will you buy them, madam?
-No, just like this.

190
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,426
-Those aren't so bad.
-How much is he asking for them?

191
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,762
And you?

192
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:51,334
You wanna watch out for these vendors.

193
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,206
They charge three times
as much as the stuff's worth.

194
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:58,005
l want that, that, and the other one.

195
00:45:08,255 --> 00:45:10,519
<i>Seashells over here!</i>

196
00:47:45,579 --> 00:47:48,173
<i>Would you like some strawberries?</i>

197
00:47:49,016 --> 00:47:51,712
-No, Dorothy!
<i>-They're tasty!</i>

198
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,253
lt's very dangerous in this hot weather.

199
00:47:54,321 --> 00:47:57,984
You shouldn't eat any fresh fruit
like that. No.

200
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,320
Only cooked vegetables.

201
00:48:01,528 --> 00:48:02,859
No, don't--

202
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,793
<i>Strawberries from the field!</i>

203
00:49:11,431 --> 00:49:15,026
<i>lt's cold, isn't it? lt's good for you.</i>
<i>All right, hurry up.</i>

204
00:49:15,168 --> 00:49:16,396
<i>All right, come on.</i>

205
00:49:21,108 --> 00:49:24,009
<i>Mother, please, let me....</i>

206
00:49:24,077 --> 00:49:28,343
<i>No, no! Tadzio! Tadzio!</i>

207
00:49:31,084 --> 00:49:34,485
<i>So, run after me! Go! Hurry up!</i>

208
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:56,566
<i>-Tadzio is in a good mood, as usual.</i>
<i>-Let's go back to the hotel, Hania.</i>

209
00:49:57,444 --> 00:49:58,433
<i>Come!</i>

210
00:50:01,348 --> 00:50:03,475
<i>-Are you tired?</i>
<i>-No, Mother.</i>

211
00:50:30,143 --> 00:50:31,940
Ground floor, please.

212
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,526
Second floor, please.

213
00:53:50,043 --> 00:53:52,011
<i>That's not shame, that's fear.</i>

214
00:53:52,078 --> 00:53:54,546
<i>Shame's a spiritual distress</i>
<i>to which you are immune...</i>

215
00:53:54,614 --> 00:53:56,343
<i>because you are immune to feeling.</i>

216
00:53:56,416 --> 00:54:00,443
You are a man of avoidance, of dislike,
the keeper of distances.

217
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,819
You are afraid to have direct,
honest contact with anything!

218
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,017
Because of your rigid standards
of morality...

219
00:54:08,094 --> 00:54:10,995
you want your behavior to be
as perfect as your music.

220
00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:14,932
Every slip is a fall, a catastrophe,
resulting in irreparable contamination.

221
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,128
-l am contaminated--
-lf only you were!

222
00:54:17,203 --> 00:54:19,034
To be in debt to one's own senses...

223
00:54:19,105 --> 00:54:22,302
for a condition
which is irredeemably corrupt and sick.

224
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,636
What joy for an artist!

225
00:54:30,984 --> 00:54:34,010
Think what a dry
and arid thing good health is.

226
00:54:34,988 --> 00:54:38,355
Especially if it's of the soul
no less than the body.

227
00:54:38,558 --> 00:54:40,992
l have to find my balance somehow.

228
00:54:41,728 --> 00:54:45,289
How unfortunate that art is so indifferent
to personal morality...

229
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,926
otherwise you would be supreme,
unreachable, inimitable.

230
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:57,674
Tell me, do you know what lies
at the bottom of the mainstream?

231
00:54:59,813 --> 00:55:01,144
Mediocrity.

232
00:55:13,093 --> 00:55:15,084
You are leaving us tomorrow, sir?

233
00:55:15,161 --> 00:55:18,619
Yes, tomorrow.
Unforeseen circumstances.

234
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,599
-An unexpected obligation.
-l understand, sir.

235
00:55:25,138 --> 00:55:27,265
l have to return to Munich.

236
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:31,575
l heard the news this morning.
lt's unavoidable.

237
00:55:33,546 --> 00:55:36,606
Also, l'm not very well and...

238
00:55:37,217 --> 00:55:39,777
-this climate is...
-Yes, sir.

239
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,048
-...most trying for my health.
-l understand, sir.

240
00:55:43,123 --> 00:55:46,957
Will you have my luggage
sent on tomorrow, and any letters?

241
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:48,760
Of course, sir.

242
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,391
And have my bill made out immediately.

243
00:55:52,699 --> 00:55:55,964
As you wish, Mr. Aschenbach.
The bill of Mr. Aschenbach, immediately.

244
00:55:56,036 --> 00:55:59,005
-Thank you.
-l will have it right down.

245
00:55:59,072 --> 00:56:00,630
Yes, thank you.

246
00:56:15,155 --> 00:56:18,556
-Excuse me, sir, l have been told to--
-Told to what?

247
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:21,253
Forgive my insistence,
but the motor launch is waiting.

248
00:56:21,327 --> 00:56:24,057
-Time presses, sir.
-Time does not press.

249
00:56:24,697 --> 00:56:28,064
Hotels try to get rid of one
as soon as one has paid one's bill.

250
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,999
l find it intolerable.

251
00:56:33,907 --> 00:56:37,843
lf the motor launch cannot wait for me,
then send my luggage on it.

252
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:42,109
-l'll follow on later by public conveyance.
-l beg your pardon, sir.

253
00:56:43,016 --> 00:56:47,214
Now let me finish my breakfast in peace.
Send me a newspaper. Any one.

254
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,717
Yes, sir.

255
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,629
Farewell, Tadzio. lt was all too brief.

256
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:08,628
May God bless you.

257
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:46,863
-Munich. First class.
-For today, <i>signore</i>?

258
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,761
-What?
-For today?

259
00:59:48,901 --> 00:59:49,959
Yes.

260
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:53,203
l don't know that you can catch the train.

261
00:59:53,773 --> 00:59:56,401
lt leaves for Verona in four minutes.

262
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,509
lf you miss that one, there is another.

263
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:03,413
-And you will miss also your connection.
-Yes. Will you hurry.

264
01:00:07,253 --> 01:00:08,811
Your change, <i>signore</i>.

265
01:00:25,271 --> 01:00:28,365
Mr. Aschenbach! l am terribly sorry, sir.

266
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:32,241
l am mortified.
An error, a most unfortunate--

267
01:00:32,312 --> 01:00:33,802
Who are you? What do you want?

268
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,405
lt's one of those things
which should never happen...

269
01:00:36,482 --> 01:00:38,575
but you know, it did happen.

270
01:00:39,852 --> 01:00:44,585
-You're going to make me miss my train.
-Your trunk has already left for Como.

271
01:00:44,757 --> 01:00:45,746
Como?

272
01:00:45,825 --> 01:00:49,727
-The company will try to get it--
-l want it back now, immediately!

273
01:00:49,796 --> 01:00:52,629
l am afraid, sir, that cannot be done.
You will have to wait.

274
01:00:52,699 --> 01:00:54,462
Wait? l want my trunk back.

275
01:00:54,534 --> 01:00:57,025
-l insist on having my trunk here now.
-Please, sir.

276
01:00:57,103 --> 01:01:01,870
Take your train to Munich and the trunks
will join you there within three days.

277
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,779
l will not leave Venice
until my trunk is returned.

278
01:01:11,017 --> 01:01:14,885
Very good, sir. You have most certainly
taken the best course.

279
01:01:27,066 --> 01:01:29,899
Take this back
and get the money refunded.

280
01:01:30,303 --> 01:01:34,706
And see the launch is ready.
l intend to return immediately to the Lido.

281
01:01:35,174 --> 01:01:36,436
Yes, sir.

282
01:05:15,294 --> 01:05:16,283
<i>Gustav.</i>

283
01:05:19,732 --> 01:05:20,926
Quick.

284
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:36,508
Darling, go and pick some flowers.

285
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:01,900
Hey, enough.

286
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,041
Come on, Daddy.

287
01:06:10,783 --> 01:06:11,977
One more.

288
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,541
Let's see under your chin.

289
01:06:15,087 --> 01:06:16,782
Yes, you love butter.

290
01:06:16,856 --> 01:06:18,847
Darling, l think there's a storm coming up.

291
01:06:20,092 --> 01:06:21,389
l think there's a storm.

292
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:35,897
A big, black cloud over the mountain.

293
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:09,865
<i>Mother! Mother!</i>
<i>Look what l've got for you!</i>

294
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,239
<i>Darling, come here quickly!</i>

295
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:14,211
<i>-Miss, quick, the bathing-wrap.</i>
<i>-Yes, ma'am, immediately.</i>

296
01:07:14,814 --> 01:07:18,011
<i>Oh, dear! How dirty you are!</i>

297
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:20,416
<i>The sand is on your face,</i>
<i>in your hair, everywhere....</i>

298
01:07:23,689 --> 01:07:25,987
<i>-Ah, this child....</i>
<i>-Have you brought me the shells?</i>

299
01:07:26,058 --> 01:07:28,424
<i>Do you like them? Are you glad?</i>

300
01:07:28,828 --> 01:07:30,989
<i>Come with me, everybody!</i>

301
01:07:31,063 --> 01:07:33,429
<i>-The shells l found yesterday were nicer.</i>
<i>-Look at this!</i>

302
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:35,065
<i>lt's a lie.</i>

303
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:37,397
<i>-You're wrong.</i>
<i>-lt's so sweet of you.</i>

304
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,665
<i>Look how dirty you are!</i>

305
01:07:41,006 --> 01:07:44,032
<i>Are you cold? Where is this from?</i>

306
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,502
<i>-He is in a fine state....</i>
<i>-l don't know, but....</i>

307
01:07:46,579 --> 01:07:48,706
<i>-He has sand all over.</i>
<i>-There are lots on the beach.</i>

308
01:07:48,781 --> 01:07:51,249
<i>Tadzio, may l have one?</i>

309
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,376
<i>l'll give you one later on, lwonko.</i>

310
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,050
<i>Darling, they're wonderful.</i>
<i>lt's very sweet of you.</i>

311
01:08:27,486 --> 01:08:29,852
<i>Your shells were also very nice, lwonko.</i>

312
01:08:29,922 --> 01:08:32,288
<i>But Tadzio doesn't want to give me any.</i>

313
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:35,516
<i>Thank you.</i>

314
01:08:37,897 --> 01:08:39,990
<i>Basiu, let's go with mademoiselle.</i>

315
01:08:42,134 --> 01:08:44,227
<i>-Take it. Eat that.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

316
01:08:44,737 --> 01:08:47,399
<i>Come on, let's build another castle.</i>

317
01:08:47,473 --> 01:08:49,407
<i>lf you help me, l'll give you something.</i>

318
01:08:49,742 --> 01:08:53,178
<i>l don't want to do it now. Maybe later.</i>

319
01:08:53,245 --> 01:08:56,578
<i>Aniu, would you help me build a castle?</i>

320
01:08:56,649 --> 01:09:00,779
<i>All right, lwonko. l'll be with you soon,</i>
<i>but l prefer to finish my tea first.</i>

321
01:13:48,907 --> 01:13:51,341
-One moment.
-Yes, Mr. Aschenbach?

322
01:13:57,649 --> 01:14:01,608
Can you tell me why there is nothing
in any of the newspapers...

323
01:14:02,387 --> 01:14:04,617
about what is happening here?

324
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:07,415
Even l have heard stories.

325
01:14:09,461 --> 01:14:12,487
You have heard
those extravagant rumors, too?

326
01:14:12,564 --> 01:14:15,965
No, believe me, sir, there is no epidemic,
not even sickness.

327
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:19,060
What about notices being put up
by the health department?

328
01:14:19,138 --> 01:14:21,606
-You have seen those?
-Certainly, Mr. Aschenbach.

329
01:14:21,673 --> 01:14:26,542
But every year, in the summer months,
Venice is papered with that sort of notice.

330
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:29,108
The police do it...

331
01:14:29,248 --> 01:14:33,275
they are interested in avoiding
any risk to the public well-being.

332
01:14:33,352 --> 01:14:35,411
lt's nothing more than that, l assure you.

333
01:14:35,487 --> 01:14:39,389
Even if certain foreign newspapers
take advantage of the situation...

334
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:43,292
to spread libelous rumors
in order to discourage the tourists.

335
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:47,298
lt's very unpleasant, don't you agree?

336
01:14:47,366 --> 01:14:50,233
But no need to be concerned,
Mr. Aschenbach.

337
01:14:50,302 --> 01:14:52,930
No need for concern. Excuse me.

338
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:02,404
Esmeralda!

339
01:21:18,822 --> 01:21:21,120
You must never smile like that.

340
01:21:27,397 --> 01:21:30,195
You must never smile like that at anyone.

341
01:21:41,178 --> 01:21:42,543
l love you.

342
01:23:33,623 --> 01:23:37,525
MUNlClPALlTY OF VENlCE

343
01:25:26,136 --> 01:25:28,161
What is this filthy smell?

344
01:25:31,975 --> 01:25:34,102
lt's everywhere in the city.

345
01:25:34,978 --> 01:25:36,343
What is it?

346
01:25:38,715 --> 01:25:40,080
Thank you.

347
01:29:53,536 --> 01:29:55,629
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

348
01:29:56,873 --> 01:29:58,238
Come here.

349
01:30:00,143 --> 01:30:02,543
Why are they disinfecting Venice?

350
01:30:04,147 --> 01:30:06,707
The police orders, <i>signore</i>.

351
01:30:07,417 --> 01:30:10,545
Because of heat and scirocco.

352
01:30:10,987 --> 01:30:13,979
The scirocco is oppressive.

353
01:30:16,759 --> 01:30:18,488
No good for health.

354
01:30:22,298 --> 01:30:24,391
So there is no sickness in Venice?

355
01:30:24,467 --> 01:30:28,335
A sickness? What sort of sickness?

356
01:30:28,938 --> 01:30:33,671
The scirocco a sickness?
Perhaps our police is sickness.

357
01:30:34,978 --> 01:30:38,106
Just a precaution, <i>signore</i>.

358
01:30:42,619 --> 01:30:43,984
<i>Thank you.</i>

359
01:31:20,123 --> 01:31:21,420
<i>Me to him?</i>

360
01:31:21,491 --> 01:31:23,686
<i>-Nothing at all.</i>
<i>-Absolutely nothing?</i>

361
01:31:24,594 --> 01:31:26,562
<i>-l'm sly.</i>
<i>-Fine, fine.</i>

362
01:35:55,464 --> 01:35:58,262
Thank you. Good afternoon.

363
01:35:58,334 --> 01:35:59,892
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

364
01:35:59,969 --> 01:36:02,563
l want to change some German marks...

365
01:36:03,539 --> 01:36:04,801
for lire.

366
01:36:05,841 --> 01:36:08,071
-Three hundred.
-Three hundred.

367
01:36:28,664 --> 01:36:30,962
-Good day.
-Good afternoon, sir.

368
01:36:40,076 --> 01:36:41,373
Excuse me.

369
01:36:45,748 --> 01:36:49,650
-Could l have a word with you, please?
-Yes, of course.

370
01:36:55,091 --> 01:36:58,891
-Now, sir, can l help you?
-l'd be most grateful.

371
01:37:00,529 --> 01:37:04,829
l've been trying to find out....
No one will tell me the truth.

372
01:37:06,636 --> 01:37:10,800
They're disinfecting Venice.
Do you know why?

373
01:37:12,642 --> 01:37:16,510
No cause for alarm, sir. A mere formality.

374
01:37:17,046 --> 01:37:20,846
A precautionary measure
in view of the unhealthy--

375
01:37:20,916 --> 01:37:22,907
Thank you very much.

376
01:37:26,422 --> 01:37:28,151
Just a moment, sir.

377
01:37:38,501 --> 01:37:42,062
l'd like to have a word with you.
Will you come this way?

378
01:37:46,575 --> 01:37:47,769
Please.

379
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:57,075
Now that was the official explanation,
which they seem to want to stick to.

380
01:37:57,219 --> 01:38:00,711
But l can tell you,
there's a bit more to it than that.

381
01:38:03,092 --> 01:38:07,825
For several years, Asiatic cholera
has shown a marked tendency...

382
01:38:07,897 --> 01:38:09,762
to spread beyond its source...

383
01:38:09,832 --> 01:38:13,131
which, of course you know,
is in the waters of the Ganges.

384
01:38:13,202 --> 01:38:15,830
First it spread to Hindustan...

385
01:38:16,072 --> 01:38:18,336
then it moved east to China...

386
01:38:18,474 --> 01:38:22,069
then it went west
to Afghanistan and Persia.

387
01:38:22,945 --> 01:38:26,642
-Are you following me, sir?
-Yes.

388
01:38:27,350 --> 01:38:32,151
From Persia, the plague moved
along the great caravan route...

389
01:38:32,321 --> 01:38:36,189
striking terror in Afghanistan,
terror in Moscow.

390
01:38:36,492 --> 01:38:41,088
From Moscow it was expected
to spread across to Europe by land.

391
01:38:41,530 --> 01:38:46,365
No. lnstead, it was carried by sea
from the Syrian ports...

392
01:38:46,702 --> 01:38:49,500
to Toulon and Malaga...

393
01:38:49,839 --> 01:38:54,105
and then to Palermo and Naples.

394
01:38:54,176 --> 01:38:57,475
And it soon
got a very firm grip on Calabria.

395
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,675
Northern ltaly
seems to have been spared so far.

396
01:39:02,051 --> 01:39:06,078
But when you consider
the vulnerability of Venice...

397
01:39:06,155 --> 01:39:08,749
with its lagoons and its scirocco....

398
01:39:10,993 --> 01:39:12,290
ln May...

399
01:39:13,896 --> 01:39:16,956
the horrible vibrios were found...

400
01:39:17,032 --> 01:39:20,058
on the same day in two bodies:

401
01:39:20,903 --> 01:39:23,997
on the blackened, emaciated body
of a boatman...

402
01:39:26,008 --> 01:39:30,001
and in a lady
who kept a greengrocer's shop.

403
01:39:32,648 --> 01:39:35,208
Both of these deaths, of course,
were hushed up...

404
01:39:35,284 --> 01:39:38,344
but now, week by week,
there are more and more deaths.

405
01:39:38,421 --> 01:39:41,686
lt's quite impossible to count
the number of the dead.

406
01:39:41,757 --> 01:39:46,694
Do you know that in the hospitals
there's not a single free bed to be had?

407
01:39:48,731 --> 01:39:52,292
People all know, of course.
They're terrified, but they're silent.

408
01:39:52,368 --> 01:39:54,165
And do you know why?

409
01:39:54,837 --> 01:39:56,930
Summer. Tourists.

410
01:39:57,339 --> 01:39:59,773
The whole business of Venice is tourists.

411
01:39:59,842 --> 01:40:02,834
Can you imagine Venice without tourists?

412
01:40:04,113 --> 01:40:06,946
lt would be more desolate than the winter.

413
01:40:08,417 --> 01:40:12,376
You would be very well advised
to leave today, sir.

414
01:40:12,855 --> 01:40:14,846
Don't wait till tomorrow.

415
01:40:15,925 --> 01:40:19,019
The blockade cannot be more
than a few days off.

416
01:40:25,801 --> 01:40:27,029
Madam...

417
01:40:28,737 --> 01:40:31,365
will you permit an entire stranger...

418
01:40:33,042 --> 01:40:34,566
to serve you...

419
01:40:35,744 --> 01:40:39,703
with a word of advice and warning...

420
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:44,942
which self-interest
prevents others from saying?

421
01:40:47,623 --> 01:40:50,717
Go away immediately. Don't delay.

422
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:53,121
Please, l beg you.

423
01:40:55,130 --> 01:40:57,496
Take Tadzio and your daughters.

424
01:40:58,067 --> 01:41:00,297
l implore you. Please.

425
01:41:01,804 --> 01:41:04,136
Venice is gripped by pestilence.

426
01:41:05,241 --> 01:41:06,435
Please.

427
01:41:10,746 --> 01:41:12,509
<i>Thank you. Thank you very much.</i>

428
01:41:42,077 --> 01:41:43,442
Thank you.

429
01:42:42,471 --> 01:42:44,803
What kind of road have l chosen?

430
01:42:47,810 --> 01:42:49,471
What sort of road?

431
01:43:25,347 --> 01:43:26,336
Gray.

432
01:43:26,582 --> 01:43:29,380
Yes, of course.
And you know why, <i>signore</i>?

433
01:43:29,652 --> 01:43:31,313
Because of your negligence.

434
01:43:31,387 --> 01:43:34,788
Because you don't take enough trouble
over your appearance.

435
01:43:34,857 --> 01:43:37,655
Understandable
in a great gentleman such as you...

436
01:43:37,726 --> 01:43:40,251
-but a big mistake, nonetheless.
-No.

437
01:43:40,829 --> 01:43:43,024
You're much too important a person...

438
01:43:43,098 --> 01:43:47,194
to be a slave to conventions
about nature and artifice.

439
01:43:47,936 --> 01:43:52,373
You know, sir,
we are as old as we feel, but no older.

440
01:43:54,043 --> 01:43:58,139
You, for instance, <i>signore</i>,
have a right to your natural color.

441
01:43:59,615 --> 01:44:01,105
<i>lf l may.</i>

442
01:44:02,618 --> 01:44:03,778
<i>Ex cuse me.</i>

443
01:44:08,057 --> 01:44:11,151
l will restore what belongs to you
immediately.

444
01:44:16,665 --> 01:44:19,190
-How?
-Leave it to me.

445
01:46:30,299 --> 01:46:34,531
And now the <i>signore</i> may fall in love
as soon as he pleases.

446
01:48:43,699 --> 01:48:44,859
<i>Come on.</i>

447
01:55:16,658 --> 01:55:19,786
You cheat! You magnificent swindler!

448
01:55:27,635 --> 01:55:29,967
What more do they want from me?

449
01:55:33,842 --> 01:55:37,710
Pure beauty. Absolute severity.

450
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:41,242
Purity of form! Perfection!

451
01:55:41,416 --> 01:55:43,646
The abstraction of the senses!

452
01:55:43,818 --> 01:55:46,719
lt's all gone. Nothing remains. Nothing!

453
01:55:47,422 --> 01:55:50,949
Your music is stillborn
and you are unmasked.

454
01:55:59,501 --> 01:56:02,561
Alfred, send them away.

455
01:56:02,971 --> 01:56:05,997
-Please make them go.
-Send them away?

456
01:56:06,574 --> 01:56:10,010
-l will deliver you to them!
-No, Alfred, please.

457
01:56:10,145 --> 01:56:12,238
Don't, please.

458
01:56:19,487 --> 01:56:20,715
To them!

459
01:56:21,256 --> 01:56:24,748
They will judge you
and they will condemn you!

460
01:56:24,826 --> 01:56:26,316
No, Alfred.

461
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:41,540
<i>Wisdom. Truth.</i>

462
01:56:42,210 --> 01:56:43,734
<i>Human dignity.</i>

463
01:56:44,813 --> 01:56:46,280
<i>All finished.</i>

464
01:56:47,849 --> 01:56:52,252
<i>Now there is no reason why you cannot go</i>
<i>to your grave with your music.</i>

465
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:56,686
<i>You have achieved perfect balance.</i>

466
01:56:57,292 --> 01:56:59,624
<i>The man and the artist are one.</i>

467
01:57:00,528 --> 01:57:02,962
