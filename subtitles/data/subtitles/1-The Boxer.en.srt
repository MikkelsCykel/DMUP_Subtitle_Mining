<i>The sun is shining,
and I hope it's a good omen...</i>

2
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,927
<i>for peace in Northern Ireland.</i>

3
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,988
<i>Not only because of pressure
from Mr. Clinton...</i>

4
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,364
<i>pressure from
the south of Ireland...</i>

5
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:40,065
<i>pressure from the Roman Catholic
hierarchy who want peace at any price-</i>

6
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,066
<i>No surrender!</i>

7
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,505
<i>You cannot hold the process
to ransom any longer...</i>

8
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,516
<i>so end the violence,
and end it now.</i>

9
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:55,782
<i>- What about the IRA?
- They haven't gone away,you know.</i>

10
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,558
Let's go, Danny.

11
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:37,490
Is 14 years not long
enough for you?

12
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,539
Time to say bye-bye, Danny.

13
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,130
- Quite a turnout, isn't it?
- Aye.

14
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,674
Quiet, please.

15
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,985
One for the governor.

16
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,852
Thirty pounds.

17
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,294
Ticket for the boat.
Please sign.

18
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,473
- It's a wedding!
-Just throw the bouquet.

19
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,976
Go on.

20
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:10,680
-Jesus Christ. Danny Flynn.
- Come on! Move it!

21
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,724
- That's Danny Flynn?
- I think so.

22
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,628
There you go.

23
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,186
Thanks, Maggie.

24
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,765
That's lookin' great, Maggie.
Well done.

25
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,770
Liam looks well.

26
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,066
Why is your father comin'
to the reception, Maggie?

27
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,112
To keep an eye on you.

28
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,708
Sure. Why not?

29
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,479
- Let's get things organized forJoe.
- Right.

30
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,563
Come on.
Come inside.

31
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,034
Hurry up!
In the club.

32
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,850
<i>Here comes the bride</i>

33
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,399
Danny Flynn's out.

34
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:52,916

Come here. Go on.

36
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,630

37
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,668
- How are you,Jimmy?
- Not bad, Mr. Hamill.

38
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,502
- What about you?
- Fine.

39
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,701
- Hello, Mr. Hamill.
- What are you readin', Brian?

40
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,243
<i>Spider-man!</i>

41
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,743
- Keep movin'.

42
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,215
Hello, lads.

43
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,623
Hey, lads. I told you
my granddad was comin'.

44
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,028
How are you doin'?

45
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,191
- You look absolutely gorgeous.
- Thank you.

46
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,203
- Congratulations,Josephine.
- Thanks for comin'.

47
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,499
This is a wee something for ya.
Okay?

48
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,234
- Oh, thank you.
- Where's Maggie?

49
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,074
- She's through there, I think.
- I'll see youse later.

50
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:55,481
You did a great job, you.
The prisoners would be proud of ya.

51
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,716
Oh, thanks for comin', Da.

52
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,191
- What's wrong?
- Nothin'.

53
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,925
Are you upset?

54
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,363
Oh, I was just thinking
about things, you know?

55
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:38,621
<i>Let me down easy</i>

56
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,528
<i>Putting my heart on the edge</i>

57
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,798
Can I have a word
with you outside, please?

58
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,844
- What's the problem?
- There is no problem. Let's go.

59
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,971
- What's happenin'?
- I was only dancin' with him.

60
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,140
You're a prisoner's wife,
for God's sake!

61
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,980
Oh,Jesus! He was only
dancin' with the girl.

62
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,485
It's all right. Relax.

63
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,488
He didn't know she was
a prisoner's wife.

64
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,921
It's all right.

65
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,658
Her husband's stayin'
five years in prison.

66
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,562
If you go near his wife again,
understand...

67
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,829
I'll shoot both your kneecaps off.

68
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,335
Sorry.

69
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,542
It's all right.
It's all right.

70
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,079
Don't be worryin', Agnes.
The trouble's sorted out.

71
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,773
- What's goin' on?
- Nothin', Ma.

72
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,689
<i>We can't get no</i>

73
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:48,825
<i>Man reaction, but we try</i>

74
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:53,929
<i>And we try, and we try
and we try</i>

75
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:13,551
I wanted to tell ya
how proud we all are of ya.

76
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,186
How you stood by your man.

77
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,890
I know that when I was inside,
it was easy to do my time...

78
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,866
because I had
a strong woman behind me.

79
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:25,893
My wife Eileen,
God rest her soul...

80
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:30,169
stood by me and remained
faithful to the cause.

81
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:35,873
And now my daughter,
with her brave son, Liam...

82
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:40,078
keeps her house together until
her husband, Thomas, returns.

83
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,144
On one day, and that day may be
sooner than you think-

84
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,655
He's gonna sell us out.

85
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:48,956
all the prisoners will come home.

86
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:54,733
And the Brits will be gone...

87
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:59,794
and we will have peace in Ireland.

88
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,034
And you-

89
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,975
you women who stood by your men...

90
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:10,175
will be remembered
as the bravest of the district.

91
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:14,185
So I want youse
to lift your glasses...

92
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,619
to our prisoners' wives.

93
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,987
- The wives.
- The wives.

94
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,494
Come on in, lads. Come on.

95
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,305
Twopence.

96
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,245
Hey, boy.

97
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,421
Hey, Flynn.

98
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,820
Danny Flynn.

99
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,387
Do you not know me?

100
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:04,402
Ike? Ike Weir?

101
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,937
Ah, ashamed of me, are ya?

102
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,601
- Pretending not to see me.
- It's good to see you, Ike.

103
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,341
- What are you doin' here?
- I needed a bed for the night.

104
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,249
Oh, the bad boys
didn't take care of ya?

105
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,112
Bad boyos didn't give you
a party, huh?

106
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,956
The big I RA boyos
didn't give him a party.

107
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:34,362
- Where's all your big men now?
- Take it easy, Ike.

108
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:39,803
Take it easy?
Don't you tell me to take it easy!

109
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,876
How come you don't blow yourself
up like the rest of the I RA?

110
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:49,278
- Tell 'em Ike Weir's afraid of nobody.
- Sit down, Ike.

111
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,010
Don't you tell me to sit down!

112
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,985
You tell 'em Ike Weir
doesn't need a gun to fight!

113
00:10:55,054 --> 00:11:00,117
- Ike, for God's sake!
- I RA? Fuck your I RA!

114
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:04,720
Put your gun down, Danny Flynn!
Fight me like a man!

115
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:08,893
Didn't I rear ya?
I coached him!

116
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,368
I trained him
when he was a child.

117
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,275
Destroyed his life.

118
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,515
Best fighter in Ulster.

119
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,298
Ah, he's gone.
Fell asleep.

120
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:45,033
Lights out.
Lights out in ten minutes.

121
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,804
How's the head, Ike?

122
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:37,778
Danny Flynn.
Jesus Christ, it is you.

123
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,565
- Got the price of a cup of tea?
- Aye, come on.

124
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,015
The semtex is loaded.
We're all set.

125
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,437
You've got 45 minutes.
Good luck.

126
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,535
We met last night, you know.

127
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,038
You had a wee go at me.
Told me a bit of truth.

128
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,416
Well, to tell you
the truth now, Danny...

129
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,722
I don't want any breakfast.

130
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,697
I just want a few shillings
for some wine.

131
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,467
Can you help me?

132
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,549
I look bad, don't I?

133
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,156
Why didn't you stick with the gym?

134
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,686
After you were arrested...

135
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,765
the Protestant lads didn't show up.

136
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,825
They took it hard.

137
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,895
They were very surprised.

138
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,469
That was it for me.

139
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,504
They use it
as a community center now.

140
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,759
He's clear.

141
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,774
There ya are, love.

142
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,514
- So how's your ma?
- She's all right.

143
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,416
So what are you gonna do?

144
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,550
Thought I'd try and get
a few fights in England.

145
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,522
Professional?

146
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,651
Aye.
Just a few fights.

147
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,693
- How old are you?
- Thirty-two.

148
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,135
Archie Moore fought
for the world title at 42.

149
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,071
Why, Danny?

150
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,056
I just want to set
the record straight.

151
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,123
Jesus Christ!

152
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,227
It's across the river.

153
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,732
Another fuckin' bomb.

154
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,876
Get the boat, Danny.

155
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,819
Get the boat.

156
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,388
- What do you think you're doing?
- This is my home.

157
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,820
- Is that his old house?
- Aye.

158
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,506
How's it goin', scrapper?

159
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,578
How's the head?

160
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:15,075
- Fine.
- You're out.

161
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,158
- Good behavior.
- You were never accused of that before.

162
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:29,756
- You missed the boat, scrapper.
- I'd no watch.

163
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:36,708
- You know Joe wanted you out of town.
- This is my home.

164
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,369
- You're gonna live here?
- Aye.

165
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,272
You're a strange man, Danny.

166
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:49,477
All you had to do was walk
across a prison corridor...

167
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:53,457
and shake hands with some of
your old friends in the I RA.

168
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,523
Snubbin' people is not nice.

169
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:02,894
But you never named names, and that's
why you're a healthy man. Understand?

170
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,171
What are you lookin' at?

171
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,505
It's not my fault you got caught.

172
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,512
You should have run away.

173
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,917
- Why is he back?
- I don't know.

174
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,924
- Why the fuck should I know?
- Is it Maggie?

175
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,928
No, he wouldn't have
the balls for that.

176
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,931
So you say.

177
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,396
No, he knows he'd get
a fuckin' bullet in the head.

178
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,872
- Say bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

179
00:20:56,488 --> 00:21:00,288
Just wait a wee minute there.
I'll see if the community center's open.

180
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,493
Okay. Come on in.

181
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,568
Come on, come on.
Are you gonna deal or what?

182
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,002
Ah, take time.
Take your time.

183
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,142
Young Flynn, isn't it?

184
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,439
What happened to the ring?

185
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,702
That packed out years ago.

186
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,712
I think it's stuck
under thon stage there.

187
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,056
There's a man standing there.

188
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,464
There's been an approach...

189
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,669
to the community center.

190
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:30,943
Danny Flynn wants to set up
a gym there.

191
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,511
What do you think?

192
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,616
- Boxin'?
- Boxin'.

193
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,993
You're in good shape.

194
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,622
It's been a few years since
this stuff's seen the light of day.

195
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:04,300
Did you see this, Ike?

196
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:10,042
You 20 years ago.
Your face wasn't so red.

197
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:15,747
- Aye, he was a tough man, Ike.
- Ah, there's young Joey Fitzsimons.

198
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:18,119
And young McCormack.
He's dead too.

199
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,306
Show us your jab. Hey!

200
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,457
- Ma, I'm goin' to Ned's.
- Well, don't be late.

201
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,001
- Are you all right?
- Aye.

202
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,017
Congratulations, Peter.

203
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,188
Harry.

204
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:48,676
Peter Mallon's been elected
to the army council.

205
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,410
I've decided I need
somebody more political.

206
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:02,384
All operations are to be
suspended from 12:00 tomorrow.

207
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,022
- Noon.
- Noon.

208
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,065
Tomorrow.

209
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:11,102
- Tomorrow.
- Why?

210
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:17,305
- We're close to a deal, Harry.
- Including the POWs?

211
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,639
Including the POWs.

212
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,304
So what are you offerin',Joe?

213
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:30,021
Peace, Harry. Peace.

214
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:36,504
Peace!
I'm sure you can deliver,Joe.

215
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:48,038
Left hand up.

216
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,369
That's it, man.

217
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,244
Keep your legs moving.

218
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,512
- Your father's a boxer too, isn't he?
- Aye.

219
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,986
Get your balance right.
Move your head.

220
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,650
Lift those punches.

221
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,024
That's it.
And again. And again.

222
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,358
That's it.

223
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,267
That's it! Good man.

224
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,248
I see you've put up the ring.

225
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,751
- Aye.
- Looks great.

226
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,889
Well, sweetheart...

227
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:56,332
did you die just soJoe Hamill
could sell us out?

228
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,876
Nothin'.

229
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,844
Just talkin' to myself.

230
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,757
12:00 noon.
Peace in Ireland.

231
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,460
Ma, it's the cease-fire!

232
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,232
<i>A scene of celebration
on the streets of West Belfast...</i>

233
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,536
<i>as 12:00 noon brought
the long-awaited IRA cease-fire.</i>

234
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:34,077
<i>Protestant spokespersons, however...</i>

235
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,704
<i>opposed any immediate movement
on the release of prisoners.</i>

236
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,952
You get to know who the troublemakers
are quick enough.

237
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,081
Just keep an eye on the tables.

238
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:48,250
No one comes into
the city center after dark...

239
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:51,921
so you only have to work
till 6:00 or so.

240
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,191
- You ever been in London?
- Aye.

241
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,392
I got a few contacts there.
Come on.

242
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:09,212
Ike, where's Danny?

243
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,180
He's in the kitchen.

244
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,010
What's goin' on, Danny?

245
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:44,980
What do you mean?

246
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:53,488
I haven't seen you in 14 years...

247
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:57,085
and now you're right
next door to me every day.

248
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:02,498
And when I do see you, all I get
from you is the odd grunt.

249
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,501
Do you not think that's strange?

250
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:17,743
- Aye, it is strange.
- Oh, forget it, Danny.

251
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,886
Come on. Pick it up.

252
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,394
That's it. Good man.

253
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,370
And again.
Move him about.

254
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,336
Beautiful. And again.
Get the punches in.

255
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:49,847
That's it. And again.
Keep your guard up, Danny!

256
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,349
Danny, come on in.
Look at these.

257
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,984
Look.

258
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,491
There's Maclean.

259
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,104
"Holy Family
Sweep the All Irelands. "

260
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:21,445
What a waste of life.

261
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:26,142
Six of them dead. Why the hell
did you get mixed up with them?

262
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,921
The police were burning people
out of their homes, Ike.

263
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,925
Soldiers shootin' people
on the corner.

264
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,291
Why the hell do you
think I got involved?

265
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,797
I don't know.

266
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,799
What's in the cupboard?

267
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:54,440
- Ah, it's locked.
- We're lockin' up, lads.

268
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:58,141
There's only odds and ends in there
belongin' to the community center.

269
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,101
Fuckin' semtex.

270
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,499
These are explosives, Birdy.

271
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,968
Why the fuck didn't you tell me
he was rootin' around in here?

272
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,504
Kept an eye on him.

273
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,074
The lock's broken.

274
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,285
It's gone!

275
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,205
Can I have a word with you?

276
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:20,022
You're in trouble.
What did you do?

277
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:27,662
I found some stuff.
Semtex.

278
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,834
Under the stage?

279
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,336
Bastards.

280
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,937
- Well, where is it now?
- In the river.

281
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,279
Well, why didn't you give it
back to my father?

282
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,710
So they can kill more
innocent people?

283
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,720
What do you mean, innocent people?

284
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,355
I mean innocent people, Maggie.

285
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,855
Do you want to get
yourself killed, Danny?

286
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:00,758
Not particularly.

287
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,966
- Why did you really come back?
- What do you mean?

288
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,405
I don't believe you just
came back here to box.

289
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,303
If you ask me to leave, I'll go.

290
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,814
If I ask you to leave.

291
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:25,147
Well, how far can you go,
Danny?

292
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:29,523
Turn around, start walking,
and when you've walked for 14 years...

293
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,620
then stop and think
about what you did to me.

294
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,932
I did it for ya.

295
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,470
Oh, my God.

296
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:51,909
I'm sorry.

297
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,417
<i>The next train
from platform one...</i>

298
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:58,319
<i>will be the 10:50 service
to Londonderry-</i>

299
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,692
I think we're safe enough here.

300
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,164
Ah, we're fine.
Don't worry about us.

301
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,167
Thank you.

302
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,010
You used to talk to me, Danny.

303
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:35,521
You used to make me laugh.
Oh, go on, make me laugh.

304
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,459
Am I not funny?

305
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:53,368
Talk to me, Danny.

306
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,481
I talk to you in my mind.

307
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,189
What do you mean?

308
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:16,999
In prison, you get used
to silence, you know?

309
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:27,276
I mean, at first, you hold on
to all the old voices in your head-

310
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,581
kids you knew at school,
old friends and such.

311
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:37,246
Well, after a while,
those voices start to fade...

312
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:42,782
and you end up talkin' to yourself
for a bit of company, you know?

313
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,597
And then something
strange happens.

314
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:56,200
It's as if even your own
voice doesn't belong there...

315
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,674
in the silence.

316
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,209
It's unwelcome.

317
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,113
Go on, Danny.

318
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,321
Well, in the end it's the silence
becomes your best friend.

319
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,497
And in the quiet,
a face will come to you, and...

320
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:29,496
and you talk to that person
without sayin' anything, and-

321
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,213
Gee, I'm not makin' any sense.

322
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,511
Never make any fuckin' sense.

323
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,617
What are you sayin', Danny?

324
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:51,450
I've lived with your face
in silence for 14 years, Maggie.

325
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:55,021
And now it's hard
to talk to the real you.

326
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,394
I'm not who I was.

327
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,935
Try the elbow.
Set down on the way. That's it.

328
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,809
Once more. That's it.
Snap on your jab.

329
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,406
That's it. One more.

330
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,985
Come on. One-two!
And again.

331
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,715
- And again.
- He wants to join.

332
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,821
- He's the boss.
- One-two.

333
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:29,327
- Shadowbox.
- He wants to join.

334
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,834
Use the rest of the ring, now.

335
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,939
Come here.

336
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,615
- No way, missus.
- Who are you to talk, Ike Weir?

337
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,280
Make him have a blood test.

338
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:58,056
If he's clear and he stays off
the junk, he can join.

339
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,861
Keep your head movin' now.

340
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,866
That's it.
Duck and weave.

341
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,868
Bob and weave.

342
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:14,703
Well done. Good jab.
Keep on the move. That's it.

343
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:19,044
Come on. Hold on. Thumbs out.
That's it. Elbows in. Nice and tight.

344
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,243
Good. Very good.

345
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,789
Look at these.

346
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,691
Headgear's gone.
You can't spar with these.

347
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,730
Look at that.

348
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,140
- What does that mean, Bootsy?
- What?

349
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,011
"Nonsectarian. "

350
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:51,742
Catholics and Protestants together.

351
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:58,211
What about theJews, Bootsy?
And the Arabs?

352
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,955
And the Muslims?

353
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,857
I suppose they can come,
too, if they want.

354
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,031
Liam, move in!

355
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,345
Come on!

356
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,817
Holy Family's
always been nonsectarian.

357
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,219
Protestants and Catholics together.

358
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,882
Write that down!

359
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:45,893
And the winner is...

360
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,097
<i>in the red corner...</i>

361
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,970
<i>Doyle from the Holy Family Club...</i>

362
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,475
<i>Belfast.</i>

363
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,308
I won!

364
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,315
You fought a great fight.

365
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,653
Okay, Danny. Let's go.

366
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,746
Don't forget.
It's your first fight in a long time.

367
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:08,087
You're gonna learn a lot.

368
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,660
Ladies and gentleman, can I have
your attention, please?

369
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,501
I want to say somethin' tonight.

370
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:28,573
Of the many people that
gave their lives in the Troubles...

371
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,978
this night is dedicated
to the members...

372
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:35,212
of the Holy Family Boxing Club
who've died.

373
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:38,312
Now, all these boys' parents
are in the hall tonight...

374
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:43,850
so I'd like youse all
to observe a minute's silence.

388
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:42,479
Sammy's parents are Protestants
from East Belfast...

389
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,851
and this is their first night
in the club...

390
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:49,222
since the Troubles began
28 years ago.

391
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:54,889
And I'd like you all
to welcome them back.

392
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,435
- Did you know that was gonna happen?
- No.

393
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,035
Sentimental shite.

394
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,147
Balance now.
Keep your balance now.

395
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,622
Come on, Danny!

396
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,727
- Come on!
- Use your jab. Use the jab!

397
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,731
- Try hittin' him, Danny!
- Shut up!

398
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,001
- Come on, lads! Box!
- Danny's way off.

399
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:40,872
Move in, Danny!

400
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,984
I'm gonna fuckin' kill ya!

401
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:04,265
He's showboatin' ya! Don't let him
do that! He's playin' around with ya!

402
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,597
Hit him! Come on!

403
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:14,341
Flynn should get
the Nobel Peace Prize for boxin'.

404
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,011
Stay off the ropes!

405
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:26,488
That a boy, Danny!
Go on!

406
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:35,524
-Jesus Christ, Danny!
- One, two, three...

407
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,659
- four, five, six...
- If he gets up, I'll fuckin' kill him.

408
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,534
- Come on! Get up!
- seven, eight-

409
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,071
Box!

410
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,737
Break! Break!

411
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,816
You're not ready.

412
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,917
- Have you had enough, son?
- I'll tell you when I've had enough.

413
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,423
Finish him.

414
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,061
Get him down, Danny!

415
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,204
Go on, Danny!

416
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:28,944
Go on, Danny!

417
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,390
- Are you okay? Can you continue?
- Aye.

418
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:46,892
He can't put him down!
He fuckin' won't bow down!

419
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,671
Hold him, Danny!

420
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,573
Come on, Danny!
Come on!

421
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,271
Stay on your feet, lad!

422
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:02,548
Don't go down!
Stay on your feet, Danny!

423
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,185
Twenty seconds!

424
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,383
Stay on your feet, Danny!

425
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:29,575
- He doesn't look like a quitter to me.
- Danny! Danny! Danny!

426
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,499
What was that about, scrapper?

427
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,012
What do you mean?

428
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,447
Those were powerful emotions
you stirred up tonight.

429
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:11,185
What are you up to?

430
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:14,289
I was just boxin'.

431
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:17,555
It's not just boxin', Danny.
It's a fuckin' statement-

432
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,720
standin' there
gettin' your head knocked off.

433
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,598
What was that about?

434
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,700
I want the stuff back, scrapper.

435
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:36,440
What stuff?

436
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,681
All right, Danny.
Play it whatever way you want.

437
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:48,219
Fourteen years wasn't enough
to teach you then. Was it, lad?

438
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:53,129
- What'd he want?
- Nothin', Ike.

439
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,698
Good.

440
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,297
He ruined your life once already.

441
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,067
- Don't give him a second chance.
- I won't.

442
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,646
You should have put him away
the first time.

443
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:16,277
You did him a favor.
He'll never forgive you for it.

444
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:19,884
I D, please.

445
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:22,290
I D?

446
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,895
Thank you.

447
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,268
I'm not too sure about this,
Maggie.

448
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:45,008
Well, it's safer than being
seen together in West Belfast.

449
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,515
Why didn't you ask me to wait?

450
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,353
- I would have waited.
- Don't say that. Fourteen years.

451
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:03,456
- I would have waited.
- You were only 16.

452
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:06,127
- Did you not trust me?
- How the hell could I trust ya?

453
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:09,138
I was mad in love with ya.

454
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:12,735
And I wanted to keep it that way.

455
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:15,778
Not have it eaten up day by day.

456
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,878
So you made the decision
for both of us?

457
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,881
- You made your own decisions too.
- What do you mean?

458
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,581
You married my best friend,
for God's sake.

459
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,283
Well, did you expect me
to remain faithful to you?

460
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:35,588
I suppose I did.
I thought I was bein' romantic.

461
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,929
Givin' you your freedom
or somethin'.

462
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,604
You were giving me my freedom, but
you wanted me to stay faithful to you?

463
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,403
I was only 19.

464
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:50,775
- Shake my hand.
- What?

465
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:54,044
Shake my hand, Danny Boy Flynn.
Billy Patterson, bantamweight.

466
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:56,711
-Jesus, Billy! How are you doin'?
- Good, good.

467
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:59,312
I'm doin' fine. Don't look now.

468
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,323
But there's a car behind ya...

469
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:05,657
and the last Catholic boy who was
in that car didn't die a happy death.

470
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:07,662
So I'll walk youse
to the peace line together.

471
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,164
Let's go.

472
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,935
Bye-bye, Maggie.
Good luck, Danny.

473
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,638
Stop by and do a bit
of training sometime.

474
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,111
Will do.

475
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:43,465
- What's wrong?
- I don't take gear from cops.

476
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,525
- Why?
- They won't let my dad out of prison.

477
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,128
- Yeah, go on!
- Looks great, Reggie.

478
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:57,479
What about you, Liam?

479
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,992
Come on, lads.
Come on. Photograph time.

480
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:23,369
- What's all this?
- It's a gift.

481
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:29,175
- A gift from who?
- Community relations.

482
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,348
- All right.
- Come here.

483
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:37,076
Group together like that.

484
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:47,027
- Community relations?
- Aye. Reggie Bell.

485
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,792
This stuff is from the cops...

486
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,760
and we can't accept it.

487
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:58,531
Listen, these kids have
barely got shoes on their feet.

488
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:01,372
Some of them
come here in rags.

489
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:04,004
Look at them now.
They look great.

490
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,572
I don't give a fuckin' shite who these
togs come from. They're on their backs.

491
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:10,279
- All right.
- They're not comin' off.

492
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:14,619
<i>We simply can't negotiate until
the terrorists lay down their arms.</i>

493
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:19,719
<i>The police are Protestant.
They're not welcome in Catholic areas.</i>

494
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:24,061
<i>In contrast, it seems the whole
of Belfast, Catholic and Protestant...</i>

495
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:28,662
<i>is welcome at the recently reopened,
nonsectarian Holy Family Boxing Club.</i>

496
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,467
Takin' gear from the cops.

497
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,474
<i>The boys from the club
recently received...</i>

498
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,510
<i>a generous donation
of equipment.</i>

499
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:37,012
<i>And Danny Flynn,
who fights out of Holy Family...</i>

500
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,039
<i>has signed up for a rematch
with Eddie Carroll at the city center.</i>

501
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:37,032
Get them!
Get those sons of bitches!

502
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:49,484
Who fired at Danny Flynn
last night, Harry?

503
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:51,952
I don't know.
My units shoot to kill.

504
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:58,089
- You're in charge of the district.
- No. I report to you.

505
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,059
Did you see this?

506
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,133
He's fillin' people's heads
full of shit,Joe.

507
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:08,034
"Leave the fighting to Danny" means
that all the people who are in prison...

508
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:10,800
who died, who didn't
surrender to the Brits-

509
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:15,106
that means that their sacrifices aren't
worth a lousy fuckin' boxin' match.

510
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:18,113
He's spreadin' dissent,Joe.

511
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:21,582
Maybe you're the one who's
spreadin' dissent, Harry.

512
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:30,224
I'm trying to hold together a district
of junkies, thieves and losers...

513
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,795
while all he's trying to say is
that everything will be all right...

514
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:37,595
if the Catholics and Protestants
will hold hands together.

515
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,534
It's shit, isn't it,Joe?

516
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:44,102
Is it, Harry?

517
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,471
Shit?

518
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,568
You know we're gonna have
to live with them sometime.

519
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:52,604
- Who's "them"?
- The Protestants, Harry.

520
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,206
The other half of the population.

521
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:03,458
You're never going to be
treated as an equal,Joe.

522
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,495
Not if we keep bombin' 'em, no.

523
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:09,123
I don't see any POWs
comin' home,Joe.

524
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:13,726
Well, last night
didn't help, Harry.

525
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:17,672
It didn't help at all.

526
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,403
Keep it goin', Bootsy.
Keep it goin'.

527
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:21,876
And again.

528
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:24,641
- Throw the combinations, Danny!
- And again.

529
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,807
Let's go. And again.

530
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:30,953
- One-two!
- Use the jab!

531
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,351
- Watch it!
- Danny.

532
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,356
Come on! Again!

533
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:41,663
That was a warning shot
they fired at you.

534
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,790
- I'll see you later.
- Aye.

535
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:05,215
You know, we can't keep doin'
what we're doin', Maggie.

536
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,659
What are we doing?

537
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,964
You know what I'm sayin'.
Come on.

538
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,536
You're right.

539
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:34,983
Give us a hug.

540
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:45,159
You're a dangerous fuckin' woman.

541
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:17,190
You talked about voices in your head.
I couldn't stop them.

542
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,991
I thought my head would burst.

543
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,498
And the only thing
that kept me sane-

544
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:28,768
- Ah, it doesn't matter now.
- Go on. I'm listening.

545
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,773
- It's not fair.
-Just finish it up, Maggie.

546
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,969
It was the sound
of your voice saying...

547
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,482
"Everything's gonna be all right. "

548
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,581
Jeez, I never said that.

549
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:50,148
Over and over again in my head.

550
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,694
"Everything is gonna be all right. "

551
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:14,574
Well, this is okay.
This is all right.

552
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:20,115
What? What is this?

553
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:27,354
This is us.
We don't got a name on it.

554
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:57,058
- Who is it?
- It's Danny. Can I come in?

555
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,030
It's very late, Danny.

556
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,499
You shouldn't be here.
It's not safe.

557
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:06,500
I know.

558
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,544
This is fuckin' ridiculous,
you know?

559
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:27,789
All this talk, Maggie,
you know?

560
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,759
We're kiddin' ourselves.

561
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:32,821
I love you.

562
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:36,261
There's nothin' else to say.

563
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,626
We're not kids anymore, Danny.

564
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:42,671
Yeah, we are.

565
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:48,407
You're so fuckin' beautiful.

566
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,313
For 14 years I was locked up.

567
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:57,614
Well, my feelings were
locked up inside of me.

568
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,790
When I got in the ring again, you can't
imagine the relief it was to feel pain-

569
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,729
to be back
in the world again.

570
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:15,794
I can give you up in my head,
but my body's cryin' out for you.

571
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,674
Don't.

572
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,644
Be with me.

573
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:38,451
Be with me.

574
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:42,530
I'm going mad, Danny.

575
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:47,096
I have a scream inside of me
day and night.

576
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:50,433
Liam's upstairs.

577
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,004
Have I said too much?

578
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:08,157
But...

579
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:12,659
I think you've said
enough for now.

580
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:20,364
- I think you'd better go.
- Okay.

581
01:02:21,364 --> 01:02:31,364
