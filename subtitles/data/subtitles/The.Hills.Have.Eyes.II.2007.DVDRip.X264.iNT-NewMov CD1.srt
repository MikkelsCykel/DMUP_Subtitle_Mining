1
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:04,046
No! No! No! No! No!

2
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,355
- No! No!
- Die!

3
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,533
Colonel Redding.
Now there's a piece of work.

4
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,205
I can't believe he's having us
wire up this hellhole.

5
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:05,183
He's obsessed with something.
What's he expecting to find down there?

6
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,549
Ghosts of old miners?

7
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,716
They're here!
Hey.

8
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,089
You ready to test 'em?

9
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,094
All right. You got everybody?

10
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:19,063
Number one's dead.

11
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,293
Oh.

12
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,094
How about now?

13
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:29,733
- Whoa. Good there.
- How about the security dummies?

14
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:33,040
They're dead too.

15
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,406
Hold on.

16
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,844
What the hell?

17
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,546
What you got?

18
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,820
- I got a shitload of false readings. Stand by.
- Again?

19
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,828
- What's going on in here?
- Damn it.!

20
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,927
- We just lost our feed.
- I'll go check the main junction.

21
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,835
Spooky down there, isn't it?

22
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:05,071
We were the first ones
in there since the '50s.

23
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:08,807
Maybe it is haunted.
Glad it's you and not me in there.

24
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,482
Aw, fuck!

25
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:50,113
- What's with thejunction box?
- It's history.

26
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,714
Our friends the rats again.

27
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,056
They love the taste
of the insulation.

28
00:04:55,128 --> 00:05:00,566
All right, I'll call base. Should be able
to get a backup here in an hour or so. Shit.

29
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,897
Dr. Wilson,
have you seen Foster?

30
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,499
Calibrating the infrared sensor
up top the mountain.

31
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,476
- Dumb sons of bitches.
- Sorry, Colonel Redding.

32
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,742
Guys aren't supposed to be here
without a goddamn escort.!

33
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,981
Wilson.

34
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,861
Wilson?

35
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,454
Wilson, come in.

36
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,175
Where are these guys?

37
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:47,508
Han, do you read me? It's Foster.

38
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,577
Han, come in.

39
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,045
Han, it's Foster.

40
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,919
Hi.

41
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,560
Are you... lost?

42
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,736
My name is Dr. Foster.
Uh-

43
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,966
Do you- Do you have a name?

44
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,443
- "Roonawee. "
- "Roonawee"?

45
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,143
- Run away!
- Run away?

46
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,447
Foster?

47
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,324
Foster!

48
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,801
Now, where are you?
Come on.

49
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,704
Come out of your holes.

50
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:51,437
Come on, you cocksucker
motherfucker sons of bitches!

51
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,110
Foster!

52
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,995
- Go! Go! Move out! Move out! Go!
- Keep moving! Keep mov-

53
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,364
Go.!

54
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,403
- Oh, shit!
- Take cover!

55
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,996
Come on, Crank.!

56
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:57,531
- Whoa!
- Ow!

57
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,512
- Leave it!
- I gotta get my helmet.

58
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,243
Spitter, forget your fucking helmet.!
Get back here.!

59
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,745
- It's not supposed to be this bad!
- Die!

60
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,313
- America's mothers suck cock.!
- What the fuck did you say?

61
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,552
- Your American mothers suck cock.!
- Uh, Crank?

62
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,188
Fuck you.!
America number one, bitch.!

63
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,755
Crank, no.! No.!

64
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,301
- Crank!
- Let's move, pussies!

65
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:29,705
Crank, you dumb motherfucker!
Don't freak out!

66
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,808
- I know what to do. Get out of the way.
- Give him some cover.!

67
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,976
- I got this. I got this.
- You get out.!

68
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,781
- This is fortress of Allah.!
- Napoleon, get the door.

69
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,788
- What?
- Get the door, man!

70
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,825
- I can't hear you! - Get
the fuckin' door! - Fuck!

71
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,589
- This is the mother of all doors.!
- Fall back.!

72
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,994
- Shit! Take cover!
- Run!

73
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,897
Shit!

74
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,899
Mama!

75
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,603
You killed my babies.!

76
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,473
- You killed my babies! You killed my babies!
- Watch out.

77
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,746
- Watch her.
- We didn't mean to.

78
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,186
- No! Napoleon!
- Kaboom!

79
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,316
Oh, you're dead.

80
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,361
Idiot!

81
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:27,923
A stunning display of
individual and group stupidity.

82
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,993
Seventeen civilians killed,
and yourselves.

83
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,665
I'm in fucking awe!

84
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,836
Cole! Never leave cover
to retrieve your helmet!

85
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,708
You won't have a head
to put it on anyway.

86
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,342
Johnson, do not drop your weapon
to protect your ears.

87
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,648
You are better off
deaf than dead.

88
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,019
Medina, since you are not
Rambo resurrected...

89
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,888
do not charge while
your head is securely up your ass.

90
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,555
That's how innocent people get killed.
And you, Napoleon.

91
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,999
- It's Napoli, Sarge.
- You're quite the killer, aren't you, Napoleon?

92
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,696
Almost got your whole squad
blown to hell in six seconds.

93
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,898
That's a mighty impressive body count
for somebody who's against the war.

94
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,966
- What?
- Oh, yeah. Your brother didn't tell you?

95
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,238
Pretty mouth here's
got himself a bumper sticker.

96
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,804
It says,
"Conversation, not confrontation. "

97
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,409
- What's up with that shit?
- You against the war, Doonesbury?

98
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,717
Not all wars, Sarge. I just think
that the president lies too much.

99
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,917
All presidents lie, asshole!
That's their fucking job.

100
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:30,986
- Yes, sir.
- No president has told the truth since Truman.

101
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,088
- And do you know what he said?
- No, Sarge.

102
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:37,033
He said that
the buck stops here.!

103
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,038
Now, you have all
failed combat...

104
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,040
and are therefore
officially dead.

105
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,508
Congratu-fucking-lations.

106
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,011
Fall in at that deuce and a half
with all gear.

107
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,707
We will deploy to the
Agave Ridge rifle range.

108
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,546
There, you can complete your
failure of these exercises...

109
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,644
by blowin' each other's
dead heads off!

110
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,622
And on our way,
we're stopping at Sector 16...

111
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,592
to deliver equipment to scientists
who are working there.

112
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:06,360
This is a top secret area,
so do not wander off or talk to anybody.

113
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:10,198
Now, get your sorry rookie butts
in the back of that truck, now!

114
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,203
Let's go! Let's go!

115
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:16,071
Let's go, Spitter! If I had some steak
on a string, you'd move real fast!

116
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:43,727
Jesus!
How big is this place?

117
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:48,399
It's about 1,300 square miles.
They used to test nuclear weapons here.

118
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,910
Well, isn't it radioactive then?

119
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,606
- Not according to the army.
- Fuck.

120
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,241
Maybe I should thank Napoleon.

121
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,754
If we're all officially dead
like Sarge said...

122
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,552
I won't be tried
for war crimes.

123
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,650
The killing of innocent mannequins
is serious shit.

124
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,253
- Where I come from, it's never good to be dead.
- Aw, Crank.

125
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,764
You're takin' all the fun
out of the afterlife.

126
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,358
Shove the afterlife up your ass.

127
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,598
- That's cold, man.
- Clyde, huh?

128
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,972
Made the same mistake when I was a kid.
So is Clyde still your dude?

129
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,841
Uh, yeah, Stump.
Clyde's still my dude.

130
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:32,276
Stump, that's her son.
He's, like, four years old.

131
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,979
That is so fucked up.

132
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,818
One good thing
about being dead-

133
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,824
Wouldn't have to listen
to all your bullshit.

134
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,658
- Oh.
- That's all there is out here. Just a bunch of bullshit.

135
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,663
This bullshit's
got a crazy past.

136
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,757
You guys know they used to use this
as a test ground for A-bombs?

137
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,860
You guys know
this used to be a test ground for A-bombs?

138
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,065
- Who the fuck asked you, peace-ass shit boy?
- Oh, right.

139
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,235
I'm sorry. I forgot I was
dealing with Rambo resurrected.

140
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,507
You Rambo resurrect my balls, bitch.

141
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,244
You with the-

142
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,878
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.!
- Come on, Crank.!

143
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,422
- You wanna die young, cabrón?
- You guys, stop.!

144
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,015
- I'll kill you right now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Crank!

145
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,058
I killed somebody once.

146
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,535
It was easy.
That's why it's so dangerous.

147
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,911
I don't fuckin'
like that guy.

148
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,176
Well, I don't like bein' out here havin'
to put up with you, but I deal with it.

149
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,116
So deal with it.

150
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,286
- Thanks.
- Don't mind Crank.

151
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,022
He's just
a cranky motherfucker.

152
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:40,469
- They're so top secret, they're invisible, huh?
- You got that right.

153
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,920
Hello!

154
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,656
- Oh, leg's asleep.
- Dick's asleep.

155
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,329
- You wanna wake it up?
- Nah, that's your daddy's job.

156
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,338
Hey, you two, cut the bullshit.

157
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,500
Off-load that crate.
Put it in the tent. Spitter, get me base.

158
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,977
National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner
calling Yuma Flats Base. Over.

159
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,678
National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner
calling Yuma Flats Base.

160
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,548
Over.

161
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,679
- Nothing, sir. It's the hills.
- Keep trying.

162
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:33,664
National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner
to Yuma Flats Base. Over.

163
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:39,070
Hello?

164
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,672
- Private Crackhead.
- Sarge?

165
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,835
See if you can find Colonel Redding.
He's supposed to be the security over here.

166
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:51,543
See these cables? They run into that old bunker
over there. Check it out. Watch your step.

167
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,915
- Yes, sir, Sergeant.
- Private Mickey Mouse.

168
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,786
See if you can find some gas. There's gotta
be some cans around here somewhere.

169
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,983
Yes, Sergeant.

170
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,860
Napoleon,
where the fuck are you goin'?

171
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,400
- I was just gonna use the facility.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

172
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,199
You are in mountain assault training.
There are no port-a-potties in Kandahar.

173
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,503
You will take your dumps
behind the cactus with the scorpions.

174
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,066
- Do you understand me?
- What do I use for T.P., sir?

175
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,942
Use your fuckin' hand.

176
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,948
Yes, Sarge.

177
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,093
Yo.!

178
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,626
Colonel Redding?

179
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,528
Stupid bats!

180
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,907
No gas, sir,
but I found this.

181
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:30,779
Satellite phone.
Must've been how they contacted base.

182
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,114
- I don't think it's working.
- Man, somebody's got a temper.

183
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,849
Mine's all buttoned up, Sarge.
Nobody's home.

184
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,448
Whose radio's that?

185
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:44,929
- Must be one of theirs.
- Wilson? Han? You there?

186
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,968
- Hello?
- Who the fuck is this?

187
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,472
This is SergeantJeffrey Millstone
of the U.S. National Guard.

188
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,600
Who is this,
and what's your position?

189
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,270
I need help.

190
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,206
I'm up the hill.

191
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,945
Are you in distress?

192
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,988
Fuck! Spitter, what's
the range on these things?

193
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,023
Couple miles.
Line of sight.

194
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,618
- Sarge.
- Looks like a signal mirror.

195
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,663
It's gotta be him.

196
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,131
- We're on a search and rescue mission.
- That's right, we are!

197
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,135
Shut the fuck up!

198
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,536
I said search and rescue,
not fuckin' spring break.

199
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,542
I want you back here with weapons
and gear for a climbing assault in five.

200
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,171
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir, Sarge.

201
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,080
No disrespect, but do you
really think it's a good idea...

202
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,084
goin' up there without
contacting headquarters?

203
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,417
Do you like
fucking with me, Napoleon?

204
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,389
I think you do.
You know what?

205
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,153
You're officially in charge
of guarding the latrine.

206
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,092
Not using it,
but guarding it.

207
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,188
I want you to stand on one leg
and hold your rifle over your fucking head...

208
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,860
and make sure that no one
steals or molests that port-a-potty...

209
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,961
or I will have your Gomer Pyle ass
court-martialed immediately.

210
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,836
Do you understand what I'm saying
to you? Do you understand me?

211
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,138
Yeah, I'll go.
I just think that it's a bad idea.

212
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,179
- Get over there and guard that fuckin' latrine, now!
- Sir, yes, sir!

213
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,949
- Live ammo or blanks?
- One live mag each weapon. It's heavier.

214
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:18,547
Flashlights and hydration packs too.
The more weight, the better for you clowns.

215
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,219
You're halfway through your training,
and you look like a bunch of raw recruits.

216
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:26,230
You're a disgrace to the U.S. National Guard,
and you wouldn't last five minutes in combat.

217
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,631
One leg, Gomer Pyle!

218
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,965
The rest of you,
get your asses up that hill.

219
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:36,371
And wipe those silly smiles
off your faces now.!

220
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,471
Let's move!
One leg, Pyle!

221
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,643
One leg.!

222
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,151
- You're so bad.
- Company, halt! Johnson!

223
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,249
- Sir?
- You stay here.

224
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,762
Spitter's coming with us. Get on
the main radio and try to raise somebody.

225
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,060
If you can get through to a medevac,
the guy'll have a hell of a better chance.

226
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,569
- Now, move.
- Yes, Sarge.

227
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,570
Don't forget to write.

228
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:12,008
Get goin'! Turn around!
One leg!

229
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,000
One leg, Gomer Pyle.!

230
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,236
Mayday. Mayday. This is
the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner...

231
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,774
calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medevac.

232
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,106
Over.

233
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:50,512
Hello?

234
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,545
Shit.

235
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,225
Mayday. Mayday. This is
the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner...

236
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,762
calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medevac.

237
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,695
Over.

238
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,359
What the hell are scientists
doing way the hell out here?

239
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,368
There's nothing but
rocks and rattlesnakes.

240
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,405
Army business, dumb ass,
and definitely none of your business.

241
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,634
But, Sarge,
I am in the army.

242
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,302
Which gives you the right
to shut the fuck up!

243
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,710
Okay. I'll just
shut the fuck up then.

244
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,714
How many people
are supposed to be here?

245
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,512
I have no idea.
Maybe we can ask him up there.

246
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,985
What are we supposed
to do when we find this dude?

247
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,988
Well, it depends
on how bad he is.

248
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,490
We wait for a medevac,
or we'll hump him down by hand.

249
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:37,324
I know I'm not supposed to talk,
Sarge, but I hope-

250
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,229
Shit, man.!

251
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,497
Come on, pull!
I got you, Mickey!

252
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,336
Hello?

253
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,343
- Shit.
- You saved my life, Sarge.

254
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,141
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

255
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,147
How far down does that thing go?

256
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,809
China?

257
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,180
Could be a hundred feet deep
or a hundred years old.

258
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,022
Just waitin' to suck
your ass in.

259
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,860
So keep your eyes open.
There's a lot of old mines around here.

260
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,695
- How's your ankle, Mickey?
- I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's go.

261
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,197
- We cannot afford to slow down.
- Come on, Sarge. Let's go.

262
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:26,040
- Ow!
- Head back to base camp.

263
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:29,239
- Oh, come on, Sarge.
- Mick, back to camp.

264
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,750
Now.
That's an order.

265
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:40,383
What the fuck is everybody
lookin' at? Let's keep movin'!

266
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,639
Screw it.

267
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:04,075
- Hey! You're not supposed to do that.
- Duty calls.

268
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,312
Mayday. Mayday. This is
the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner...

269
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,720
calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medevac.

270
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,725
Over.

271
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,284
Mayday. Mayday.

272
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,763
This is the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner
calling the Yuma Flats Base-

273
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,023
- Oh, fuck! Fuck!
- What?

274
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,089
- There's a hand in the shitter!
- What?

275
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:59,627
Check it out!
Oh, fuckin'-

276
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:08,540
Oh!

277
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,945
There's nobody in there.

278
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,610
Down... there.

279
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:34,369
- Who was that guy?
- Shit-Man the Barbarian! I have no idea!

280
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,634
Help me!

281
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:43,540
- Oh, man.
- Oh, God.!

282
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,218
I can't tell one rock from another.

283
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:53,417
It was between those three.

284
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:58,191
Seems like that's
the only way up right there.

285
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,254
- That ain't so bad.
- Nah, man.

286
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,425
Not so bad at all...

287
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,401
if you're
a fuckin' squirrel.

288
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:19,010
- What's with all these cuts?
- I don't know.

289
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,227
Who did this to you?

290
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,392
They're... here.

291
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,270
Who's they?

292
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,975
None of the cuts
were that deep.

293
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,383
- Massive infection.
- What?

294
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:59,253
Shit stinks because it's full of pathogens.

295
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:03,317
Whoever did this to him
wanted him to die slowly.

296
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,488
What kind of person
could do that to someone?

297
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,226
I honestly don't know.

298
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,734
Let's go, Delmar.

299
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,833
There you go.

300
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,639
Pick your spots.

301
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,487
Find the creases.

302
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,915
You got it.
You got it.!

303
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,899
- Ow!
- Keep goin: soldier.

304
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:48,437
There you go. That's what
I'm talkin' about, Delmar.

305
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,873
- Whoo.! Nice.!
- All right. All right.!

306
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,446
- All right.!
- Yeah.! Spider-Man.!

307
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,781
You are officially
a bad motherfucker.

308
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:06,313
Stump, you're up next.
The rest of you, get your asses ready.

309
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,538
Love you, Mommy.

310
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,987
Take your time and pick your spots, Stump.

311
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,354
Asshole!

312
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:45,396
Oh, easy.
Sarge says we're moving out.

313
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,397
Well, make some noise
next time you come up behind me!

314
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:51,333
Yeah, whatever.
Look, I'm just the messenger.

315
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,229
Chicks, man.

316
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,083
Hello? Hello?

317
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:10,611
Over. Hello?
Hello? Over.

318
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:16,591
- Hello? Hello? Over.
- You get through to 'em?

319
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,858
This radio sucks!

320
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,063
Hello? Sarge?
Anybody?

321
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,409
Holy shit!

322
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,072
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no, no, no!

323
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:39,639
- No!
- Oh, my God!

324
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:45,088
- Shit!
- What are you doin'?

325
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,125
- Fuck!
- What?

326
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,889
Where's your rifle?

327
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,159
Oh, God, it's gone.!

328
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,795
Oh, God!

329
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,167
- Let's just get up there.
- No, no, no, no, no. We're not goin' up that hill.

330
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,803
I'm not hiding down here
waiting for them to come down!

331
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,245
What? You scared?

332
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:14,911
It's not about being scared. It's about not
making idiotic and possibly fatal decisions.

333
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,420
Right. I forgot
who I was speaking to.

334
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,583
The same genius
who got his whole squad blown to hell.

335
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:25,994
Didn't you hear what he said?
Someone is here. You wanna die like him?

336
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,329
Let's just get up
with the others.

337
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:37,369
Hello, Sarge?
Hello, Sarge?

338
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,679
Hello? Sarge?
Anyone?

339
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,550
Can anybody out there read me?

340
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,427
Napoleon!

341
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,522
- What?
- I don't know-

342
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:39,536
Amber!

343
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:43,096
Hey!

344
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,112
Hey!

345
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:58,750
Napoleon!

346
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,461
Did I hit him?

347
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:17,467
Mickey! Mickey!

348
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:22,809
- Hey, who was that?
- Mickey, something's going on! Oh, God. Are you all right?

349
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,373
Yeah, I just twisted my ankle-

350
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,817
Hold on!

351
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:33,051
Holy shit! Fuck!

352
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:36,389
Hold on! Hold on!
I got you!

353
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,452
Oh, shit! Oh, God!

354
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,463
- Shit!
- Hold on! I got you!

355
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:44,126
Shoot the fucker! Shoot him!

356
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:47,330
- Shoot him.!
- I can't see in there!

357
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:52,901
I don't have a shot!

358
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,673
Fucking help me, man!

359
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,818
Don't let go.! Mickey.!

360
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,321
Oh, God!
Oh!

361
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,490
Mickey!

362
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,963
- Oh, God.!
- Mickey!

363
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,968
Man, this is some bullshit.

364
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,514
- What?
- Thought I heard something.

365
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:41,023
- A shot.
- This is a military base.

366
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,617
People are shootin'
all over the place.

367
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:47,688
I think it came from camp. Has anybody
checked in with Amber recently?

368
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,893
Mickey's down there by now.
You know he's got her in a tent...

369
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,267
and they're doin'
a whole nother kind of training.

370
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,363
You know what I mean?

371
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,533
- Sarge, up there.!
- I see it.!

372
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:01,669
- Another one.
- You two, get your asses up here!

373
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,839
Come on.

374
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,406
Hello.!

375
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,616
Hello!

376
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,196
Oh, no.

377
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,502
The red and black high-top forces.
What?

378
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:30,769
- And it's my size too?
- What the fuck's it doing way up here?

379
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,436
Now, if we could only find
the other ones, we'd be in business.

380
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,537
Sarge, over here.!

381
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,781
Sarge.!

382
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,917
What the fuck is in his head?

383
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,728
- Private Crackhead, fish it out.
- Huh?

384
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,427
Shit.

385
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:10,769
"Dr. Paul Foster.
Department of Defense. "

386
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:14,784
Looks like we found
one of our scientists.

387
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,989
- Lock and load.
- This isn't supposed to happen on an army base, man.

388
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,753
- In the middle of a U.S. military facility.
- The size of Rhode Island.

389
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:25,284
Look, if some asshole wants to go nuts,
this is a damn good place to do it.

390
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,627
Spitter, get Amber on the radio.

391
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,794
Stark Nine. Stark Nine. Amber,
this is Spitter. You read me? Over.

392
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:39,400
Stark Nine. Stark Nine.
Amber, this is Spitter. You read me? Over.

393
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,576
There's too much interference.

394
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,984
- Sarge, we should go back down-
- Amber's fine. She's got Mick and Napoleon.

395
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,045
- Help me.
- That their radio?

396
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:55,820
Let me have it.
Colonel Redding, is this you?

397
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,493
Hello?
Can you hear me?

398
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,205
That wasn't
the same voice as before.

399
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,639
Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.
But if somebody's hurt, we're gonna help him.

400
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:14,109
And if somebody is fucking with us,
we're gonna find out who it is.

401
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:17,170
- Sarge-
- I told you before, this isn't spring break.

402
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,012
One way or the other,
lives are at stake.

403
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:23,212
That's how it is.

404
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,221
Crank, Spitter,
you stay with me on lead.

405
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,656
Missy, Stump, Delmar,
you bring up the rear. Watch our backs.

406
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:32,389
Stay alert and stay alive.
Let's move.

407
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:26,272
You hear somethin'?

408
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,376
I don't know.
Maybe a bird?

409
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,921
- Keep your eyes open.
- Okay.

410
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,725
What the fuck was that?

411
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,706
Aw, shit!

412
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:53,210
- What the fuck-
- No!

413
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:56,303
Sarge.!

414
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,316
- Spitter! Fuck!
- Oh, fuck, man! Sarge!

415
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,080
That was Spit, man.

416
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,122
Sarge.!

417
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,157
- Sarge!
- I didn't mean to do that.!

418
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,887
Sarge.!

419
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,562
You hurt? You hurt?

420
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,600
- I didn't mean to do that.
- Do what?

421
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,761
Sarge!
Sarge! Sarge!

422
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,805
Sarge!

423
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,432
- What do we do?
- Go get me the medi-pack.

424
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:28,274
Medi-pack? D.!
Medi-pack! Bring it over here!

425
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,286
Fuck, man! Fuck.

426
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,625
- What happened?
- I swear, man, this dude just popped out of nowhere.

427
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,854
- He stabbed Spit in the back.
- Hey, man.

428
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,954
I didn't mean to.
Fuck, man.

429
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:50,023
- Is he okay? Is he okay?
- Sarge?

430
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,266
Sarge?
Come on, breathe.

431
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:57,535
Breathe, Sarge.

432
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,803
Sarge, stay with us.

433
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,811
- Sarge.!
- What do we need?

434
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,813
What do you need?

435
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,974
Crank.!

436
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,984
Missy,
what do you need?

437
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:11,146
Crank.! Crank.!
Tell them, man.! Tell them.!

438
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,521
It was an accident.
It was a fucking accident.

439
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:21,391
They're fucking with us.
These guys are smart.

440
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:33,369
Amber?
Where's Mickey?

441
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:58,598
Watch between the rocks.
Under your feet too.

442
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,399
- That's how they got Mickey?
- That's how they did it.

443
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,463
God.

444
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,310
What is it?
