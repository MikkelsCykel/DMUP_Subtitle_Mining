00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,400
Shit,
that's a airplane.

166
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,800
Jacob:
you know what,

167
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,500
It's probably one of
those drunk doctors.

168
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
They're always crashing
their plane, you know?

169
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,400
Lou: yeah, it must've
come down right there.

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,500
See all them
broken trees, jake?

171
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,800
It's too dark.
I can't see.

172
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,900
Scrape some of that snow
off the windshield.

173
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,500
Lou:...can't see
a damn thing.

174
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,000
Door's stuck.

175
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,900
Jacob: probably
a singer or something.

176
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,500
Lou: still can't see
nothin' here.

177
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,100
Still can't see
anything.

178
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,600
Can't see
a damn thing.

179
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,800
I see the pilot!

180
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,500
What's he
talking about?

181
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,200
Said somebody's
in there.

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Are you ok?

183
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,400
Hey. Hey, buddy...

184
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,300
Aah! Whoaaa...

185
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,500
Ah! Aah! Aah!

186
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,800
Hey, get--Get off!

[Crows squawking]

is going on..?

00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,100
Aah! Ohh!

190
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,100
Oh, god!

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Shit!

192
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,000
Hey, lemme
outta here.

193
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,100
Good grief, hank.

194
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,300
Let me get this
off of him. Here...

195
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,700
Hank, did you--
Did you--

196
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,500
Did you see--Did you
see all them birds?

197
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,300
Did i see the birds?

198
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,900
Come on, help me
get outta here.

199
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,800
Hank, put that
on your eye.

200
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,800
Thanks.

201
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,850
You tore your coat,
you know.

202
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, my god...

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,400
Oh, my god!
Look at this!

204
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
Shit!

205
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh, my god!

206
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,800
How much you think
is in here?

207
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,100
God almighty!
These are $100 bills!

208
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,000
The whole bag's
full of 'em!

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,900
Is this--Is it
ha ha! Real money, lou?

210
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,300
Oh, hell, yes,
it's real.

211
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,100
Don't be stupid.

212
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,700
Why would somebody
be flying around

213
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,900
With this kind
of cash?

214
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,300
You know what? I bet
it's drug money.

215
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,300
That's probably
i bet you're what it is. Right.

216
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,000
This guy's
a dope dealer

217
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,900
Because that's
what they do.

218
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They fly around in
these little planes.

219
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,600
I guaran-Damn- Tee you.
This is dirty money.

220
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,200
That's right.

221
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,100
I saw it
on 20/20.

222
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,600
"Dirty money"?
What do you mean?

223
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,300
Are you telling me
it's counterfeit?

224
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,200
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

225
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,400
No, this
is real.

226
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,200
Whatever it is,
it's a police matter now.

227
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,500
What do you think
we should do?

228
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,400
Somebody should
stay here,

229
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,900
Somebody should go
after the cops?

230
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,400
How you wanna
what? Work it?

231
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,000
Let's think
this through.

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
What?
Hold on!

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,400
What if we didn't
turn it in?

234
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,600
You wanna keep it?

235
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,300
Ha ha ha!
He wants to keep it.

236
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
Well,
that's a hot one.

237
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,500
Why wouldn't we?

238
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,800
Why wouldn't we?
Yeah.

239
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,500
Because we'd go
to prison.  Why?

240
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,300
Why? Because
it's stealing.

241
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,000
Stealing.
Stealing from who?

242
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,750
From him? Hell,
he won't mind.

243
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,300
Heh heh...

244
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,100
Oh, 'cause he's
dead, right? Ha ha ha!

245
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,200
Ha ha! That's
pretty funny--

246
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,400
He's dead.
He won't mind.

247
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,600
I say we take this bag
back to the truck,

248
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,500
And we pretend like
we were never here.

249
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Fuck yeah.
Why not?

250
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,800
Why not? Because
we'd get caught.

251
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,400
Aw, hell! I'll
tell you what.

252
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,900
Stay the hell
out of it then.

253
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,500
You know, we
don't need you.

254
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,200
It'd just be more
money for us.

255
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,300
Hey, i don't wanna stump you
another fancy word, lou,

256
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,900
But does the term "accomplice"
mean anything to you?

257
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,100
Come on. That's stupid.

258
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,700
But, hank, why
would we get caught?

259
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,400
Because it's a lot
of money.

260
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,100
Somebody's bound
to be looking for it.

261
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,000
When they find
that plane

262
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,700
And the money's
not in it,

263
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
They'll come
bullshit! Looking for us. Bullshit!

264
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,400
This is
dirty money!

265
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,900
And as far as that
guy's concerned,

266
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,600
The cops don't even
know he exists.

267
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,400
Nobody knows
about this...

268
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,300
But us.
See there?

269
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,300
Nobody knows
but us.

270
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
It's like we came
out here on a hike,

271
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,400
And found lost treasure.
Right?

272
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,400
It's the american dream
in a goddamn gym bag.

273
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,300
He--He just wants
to walk away from it.

274
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,000
You work for
the american dream.

275
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,000
You don't steal it.

276
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,400
Then this is
even better.

277
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,900
If this guy's
a dope dealer,

278
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,000
Then--Like we're
talkin' about--

279
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,600
Then that means we're
like robin hood.

280
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,500
Oh, yeah, and i'll
tell you what.

281

You got a beautiful
wife at home.

282

You're about
to have a baby.

283
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,500
I know you ain't
pullin' down that much

284
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,200
At the feed mill.

285
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,100
Wouldn't you love to
have a piece of this?

286
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,900
Hell, yes, i would,
but we can't just take it.

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
Hey, what if
there's a reward?

288
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,900
Maybe there's a reward,
and they'll give--

289
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,600
Maybe there's not!

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,500
How about this.
I tell you what.

291
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,600
I'll bet you
$10,000--

292
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,300
Just one of
these packets--

293
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,800
That when they
find this plane,

294
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,000
There's no mention
of this money.

295
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,000
Hank, why--
Why turn it in

296
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,100
Until we know
whether or not

297
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,200
Somebody's
lookin' for it?

298
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,600
That's right.

299
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,300
If you scratch,
then don't--Don't itch.

300
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
If you--If it's--

301
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,200
If it's broken,
don't fix it. Right?

302
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,900
Or if you--If--If--
If the--If--If--If--

303
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,700
And i know
what you mean.

304
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,500
[Caw caw]

305
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,200
Suppose i was
the one to keep it?

306
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,100
For how long?

307
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,990
Just till spring,
till they find the plane.

308
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,000
Then what?

309
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,980
Then, if you're right and
nobody mentions the money,

310
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
We split it up,
and we all leave town.

311
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,700
Why should you
get to hold it?

312
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,800
That's the only way
i'll do it.

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,700
Otherwise we can just
turn it in right now.

314
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,300
So, what, you mean--
You--You--

315
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,600
You don't trust us?
Is that what you mean?

316
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,100
That's a lot of money.
I guess i don't.

317
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,650
Look, no--No promises.
If somebody comes searching

318
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,600
For the money,
i'll burn it.

319
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,400
I'll burn it,
listen, and that's it. Hank...

320
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,200
No. That's the only way
i'll do this!

321
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,100
Look, we gotta be
agreed on this.

322
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,600
That's the deal.
That's the deal.

323
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,400
I hold onto it, we wait
till they find the plane.

324
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,200
If nobody mentions it,

325
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,700
We split it up,
and we move away.

326
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Ok?

327
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm in.

328
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,400
We count it
first.

329
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,100
That's probably
a good idea.

330
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,600
I mean, you know...

331
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,400
Heh heh heh...

332
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,300
Heh heh...
heh heh...

333
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,300
This is nuts.

334
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,500
Oh, my god...

335
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,400
Hey, what you gonna
buy, jakey boy?

336
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,500
I'm gonna buy me
a truck.

337
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,400
No. Fuck that.

338
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,700
Get something
classy.

339
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,300
Trans-Am.

340
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,900
Oh, yeah, in my wildest
fuckin' dreams, a trans-Am.

341
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,800
You could buy a fleet
of trans-Ams.

342
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,700
Mary beth!
Mary beth!

343
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,200
Where the hell
have you been?

344
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,900
Where you
been, huh?

345
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,800
There's shoes
for baby, ha ha!

346
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,800
Lou:...4,350,000,

347
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,900
4,360,000...
4,370,000...

348
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
4,380,000...

349
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,000
4,390,000...

350
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,800
$4,400,000!

351
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,500
Isn't that great?
Listen to that.

352
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,990
Look at that shit, man.
Look how square it is.

353
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That is cool, huh?

354
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,300
How much is that
apiece?

355
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,800
About a million
and a...

356
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,200
A million
and what? Shh!

357
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,400
A million and
a half? What?

358
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,800
Shh! You
hear that?

359
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Uh-Uh.

360
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,100
Oh, shit.

361
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,800
Get in the truck.
I'll handle this.

362
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,900
Shit.
Go on!

363
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,600
Hank: let's go!

364
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,000
Come on, cover up
the money!

365
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
Jake, get
in the truck!

366
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,600
Dummy up.
Let's go!

367
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,100
Come on!

368
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,900
Hey, carl.

369
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,000
Engine trouble,
hank?

370
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,400
Oh, i wish.
Dog trouble.

371
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,990
Jacob's mutt chased
a fox into the woods.

372
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,500
She tree it?

373
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,800
We thought so, but just
when we went after it,

374
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,300
She came running back.

375
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,000
Ah.

376
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,600
What'd you do
to your head there?

377
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,700
Oh. God, uh...

378
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,500
Heh. Ran into
a tree branch.

379
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,800
Your brother
still out of work?

380
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Yeah.

381
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,300
Lou?

382
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,400
Yeah, him, too.

383
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,300
That's a shame,
ain't it?

384
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,400
Well, we probably better
be heading back--

385
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,900
Hey, hello, jacob!

386
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,100
Hey, carl,
how you doin'?

387
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,600
Good, good.

388
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,700
I was beginning
to think

389
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,200
You were trying
to avoid me.

390
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,100
I'm sorry?

391
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,900
Well, you sittin'
over there in that truck.

392
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,100
I thought you was
trying to avoid me.

393
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,000
No. Just sittin'
in the truck.

394
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,900
It's a little cold
out here, you know.

395
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Just keepin' warm.

396
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,700
Well, we probably
better be--

397
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,200
Did you tell him
about the plane?

398
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,600
It sou-Sounded
like a plane.

399
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,600
What plane?

400
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,700
What, you heard
a plane?

401
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,300
Uh...i don't know
what he heard.

402
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,200
You know he's always
hearing shit.

403
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,900
Maybe you better
tell me, jacob.

404
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,300
No, that's ok.

405
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,800
We're gonna
get on home.

406
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,800
All right.

407
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,500
All right.
Come on, man.

408
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,200
It's new year's!
Let's get outta here.

409
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Jacob:
call me, carl.

410
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,400
Happy new year.

411
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,000
Sure you don't
need any help?

412
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
No, we're all set.

413
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,200
Thanks.
All right.

414
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,600
Goddamn it!

415
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,800
I've seen you do some
pretty stupid things, jacob,

416
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,500
But that pretty much
takes the cake!

417
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,500
It was my idea.

418
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,800
Oh, well, that's
brilliant, lou.

419
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,400
Now when they find
the plane,

420
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,900
And they realize
the money's gone,

421
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,700
They'll know right off
who took it.

422
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,100
Well, that's--

423
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,600
That's what's cool
about it, though.

424
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,300
I mean, we wouldn't
tell somebody

425
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,900
If we were the ones
that did it.

426
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,000
It's not like he said

427
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,700
That you actually saw
a plane going down.

428
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,500
Just you thought you
might've heard one

429
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,500
With engine trouble.

430
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,000
You want me to
burn the money?!

431
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,800
I am not going
to prison over this!

432
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,700
If it looks like there's
even the slightest chance

433
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,300
Of us getting caught,

434
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,000
I swear to god,
it's all gonna vanish!

435
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,200
You understand?

436
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,000
"It was a pine apple."

437
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,100
Hee hee hee hee hee...

438
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,300
[Groaning] oh, god...
this is gonna be fun.

439
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,400
Woman: where the hell
have you been?!

440
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,900
You come when
i'm always finished.

441
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,400
I'm finished,
you asshole!

442
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,700
Hey, nancy!

443
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Don't--
Don't hit--

444
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,900
Don't hit
mary beth.

445
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,500
[Low] remember,
nobody knows about this.

446
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,400
That includes nancy.

447
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,200
She'll have to find out
about it sooner or later.

448
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,500
She'll wonder where all
the money's coming from.

449
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,600
2 hours late!

450
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,000
Ow! Stop it!

451
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,800
Tell her when we decide
it's safe to keep it,

452
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,700
But not before then.

453
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,100
Then the same goes
for sarah.

454
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,200
Of course.

455
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,200
[Thunk]

456
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,000
Damn it!

457
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,700
Nancy: come on!

458
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,200
You promised to
shovel the walk,

459
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,100
You lazy son
of a bitch!

460
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:47,900
Calm down, baby.

461
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,800
I got a good reason
for being late. What?

462
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,900
See you, lou!

463
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,800
[Indistinct arguing]

464
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,100
You know, i bet
he's telling her.

465
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,000
That guy can't
keep a secret.

466
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,400
Hey, honey.

467
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Hey.

468
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,000
Where you been?

469
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,100
I was starting to get
worried about you.

470
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,200
Sorry i'm late.

471
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
Oh, that's all right.

472
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,400
Hey.

473
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,900
What happened to your head?

474
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,300
It's ok. It's
just a scratch.

475
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,800
It's all bloody.

476
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,000
Can i ask you something?

477
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,400
Yeah, sure.

478
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,400
What if you were
walking in the woods--

479
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,000
It's not deep.

480
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,600
And you found
a bag full of money,

481
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,300
Let's say $4 million...

482
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,800
Would you keep it?

483
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,500
Of course not.

484
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Here, hold that.

485
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,100
How come?

486
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,800
Well, for starters,
it'd be stealing.

487
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,100
We were talking about
lost money here,

488
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,000
Nobody's looking for it.

489
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,700
$4 million
of lost money...

490
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,200
Yeah.

491
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,900
That nobody's
yeah. Looking for?

492
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,300
Well, so then
whose money is it?

493
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
Yours.

494
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,300
Oh.

495
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Ooh.

496
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,800
It's my money?

497
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,300
But whose money
was it before?

498
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,600
A bank robber's.

499
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,300
So then it's
the bank's money.

500
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,000
All right, it's, uh,

501
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,000
A drug dealer's.

502
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
It was--

503
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Hank.

504
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,800
I mean, this is
really silly.

505
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,600
Obviously you want me to say
something in particular.

506
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,400
I don't know what it is,

507
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,100
But you want me
to agree with you

508
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,700
Or say that you're right
or something.

509
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,200
But i wouldn't take it.

510
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,700
That's just me. I wouldn't.

511
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,300
It's real.

512
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,800
If we keep it,
we never have to worry

513
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,100
About money again.

514
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,200
But we don't have to worry
about money now, hank.

515
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,100
You've got a good job.

516
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,900
We don't need it.

517
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,200
Yeah, but nobody gets
hurt by us keeping it.

518
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,900
I mean, that's
what makes it a crime,

519
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,200
Doesn't it?

520
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,100
Somebody getting hurt?

521
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,100
What makes it
a crime

522
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,200
Is that it's
against the law.

523
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,600
It doesn't matter if
somebody gets hurt

524
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,400
Or if they don't.

525
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,900
If you get caught,
you go to jail.

526
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,000
Nobody's
gonna get caught.

527
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,400
The money's the only evidence

528
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,600
That we've done anything wrong.

529
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,400
We sit on it,
we see what happens.

530
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,400
If somebody comes
searching for it,

531
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,000
Then we just burn it
and that will be that.

532
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,200
There's no risk.

533
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,900
We'll always be
in control.

534
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,900
What about
jacob and lou?

535
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,700
As long as we're
handling the money

536
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,300
They have to let us
call the shots.

537
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,800
It seems...crazy

538
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,200
Just to give it up.

539
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,400
I mean, before we know if
anybody's searching for it.

540
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,000
Tv: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

541
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,700
This is it.

542
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,200
It ain't champagne,

543
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,100
But happy new year.

544
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,300
You have to go back and
return some of the money.

545
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,300
What?

546
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,200
A lot. Like 500,000.

547
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,200
You see, that way
when they find the plane

548
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,900
They'll assume nobody's
been there yet.

549
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,200
It'll put us beyond
suspicion.

550
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,100
No one would walk away
from that much money--

551
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,900
Wait a second.

552
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,500
We're gonna keep
the rest?

553
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,900
You'll have to go
in the morning

554
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,900
So when it storms later
it'll cover your tracks.

555
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,400
You can't tell jacob
though.

556
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,750
What, do you think he'd
go back and take it?

557
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,100
It's--It's just
being careful.

558
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,400
That's what we have
to be from now on.

559
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,500
We have to be careful.

560
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,300
We have to be thinking ahead
all the time.

561
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Ok. Ok.

562
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Ok.

Hey, i screwed up,
i moved the pilot.

Come on, we gotta go put
him back like he was.

Come on,
i need a lookout.

If somebody comes by,

You pretend you're
changing the tire.

You know,
that's not gonna work.

574

What do you mean
it's not gonna work?

575
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,500
Nobody's gonna believe
that. It's not flat.

576
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,000
You're kinda crafty.

577
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,300
I observe things.

578
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,400
Observe and learn,

Jacob, what happened,
she die on you?

584
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,800
No, we had a flat.
We had a flat tire.

585
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,600
I fixed it. See? The
new one's on there now.

586
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,200
I took the other one,
the bad one,

587
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,000
And put it in the trunk.

588
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,700
It's back there now,
flat as a pancake.

589
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,000
But it's cool now.
Everything's all right.

590
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,600
You see that god damned fox
come by here about 5 minutes ago

Heading right on down
to the woods?

No, i didn't see a fox.

I didn't see any fox.

Well, if you'd been
standing where i'm sitting

00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,500
Wait, wait, wait.
We can't--

648
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
Why?
We can't do that.

649
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,500
Come on.
We can't do that.

650
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,400
What do you mean
we can't do it?

651
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,100
Because we're gonna
make tracks

652
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,000
And they're gonna see
them and follow 'em. Ok.

653
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,100
It's gonna be like
a crime scene or something.

654
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,900
We're gonna drive the
car back to the bridge.

655
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,300
I'll put him
on the snowmobile

656
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,300
And take him
through the park.

657
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,600
You gotta get there
ahead of me.

658
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,100
So whatever you do, i
don't want you to stop.

659
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,900
I want you to just drive
on by then circle back.

660
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,500
I don't want people to
see you sitting there.

661
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,500
Circle back?
That's right.

662
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,300
That's right.

663
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,600
Come on,
come on now.

664
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,200
They're not gonna
take me away, are they?

665
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:16,800
You gotta promise me--

666
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,700
Nobody's gonna take
you away, i promise.

667
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,500
But we gotta hurry.

668
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,800
It's gonna be ok,
right, hank?

669
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,300
Come on. We gotta go.

670
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,300
You gonna be there,
right?

671
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,900
I'm gonna be there.
Now just go.

672
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
Go.

00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,900
Dwight.

678
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,600
Your brother.

679
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,800
He hit me.

680
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,800
You call the police.

681
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,500
Get the police.

682
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,600
Jacob, what
are you doing?

683
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,100
Come on before
anybody sees.

684
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,700
I'm not gonna
what? Do this.

685
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,200
Well, it's
just stupid.

686
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,900
I mean, if--

687
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,600
See, if we cover it up

688
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
It's just gonna be
worse anyhow.

689
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,100
So, you know,
i'm--I'm just--

690
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,000
Get in the car.

691
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,400
I'm just gonna go and
pull him out, you know?

692
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,100
We're just gonna tell
everybody the truth.

693
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,000
Just gonna tell 'em
about the money

694
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,800
And everything and just
say that i--That i--

695
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,500
You're gonna
leave tracks.

696
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,700
Wait a minute.

697
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,200
This is
my decision.

698
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,400
Mine.

699
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,500
Not yours.

700
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,700
You didn't kill him.

701
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,200
We both did.

702
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,100
What are you
talking about, hank?

703
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,000
He was alive when you left.

704
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,000
I smothered him.

705
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,400
I guess that makes it
my decision.

706
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,400
It's gonna be ok.
I mean, it looked real.

707
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,200
And even if--I mean,
let's say it didn't

708
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,600
Look like an accident.

709
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,300
Whatever. I mean...

710
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,700
Why would anyone
think of us?

711
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Your tracks lead
right to the plane.

712
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,800
But it's gonna snow.

713
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,100
Any minute now, it's
gonna start snowing.

714
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,700
Was there any blood?

715
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,500
Blood?

716
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,200
Jacob hit him. Was
there blood anywhere?

717
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,500
Did he get blood
on anything?

718
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,200
Was there blood
on the road or--Or--

719
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,800
I don't remember.

720
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,000
Did you look?
I looked,

721
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,600
But i--I just don't--
It was all hap--

722
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,000
Honey, it's gonna snow.

723
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,400
It's gonna snow

724
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,800
And everything's gonna
be covered up.

725
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,100
All the tracks--

726
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,400
Shh.

727
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,100
Tv:  he was apparently
trying to cross

728
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,500
Along this bank of snow

729
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,990
When his snowmobile
slipped over the edge

730
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,990
Throwing him into the icy
waters of anders creek.

731
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,100
Wright county deputies
recovered the body

732

Shortly before
4:00 this afternoon.

733

to this new year

Thanks, tracy.

I wish you hadn't
told jacob.

738
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,200
I wish he still thought
that he did it.

739
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,200
Does it scare you?

740
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,600
Yeah, it scares me.

741
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,600
What if he tells somebody?

742
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,900
I mean, what i did.

743
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,800
What you did?

744
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,000
Well, i know that
you only did it

745
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,200
Because you felt trapped.

746
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,500
That you couldn't
find any other way.

747
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Would you have done
the same thing?

748
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,400
I mean, if you'd been
there instead of me?

749
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,990
I--I--I just need to
know if it's possible.

750
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,730
Oh, honey.

751
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,200
You listening to me,
hank?

00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,600
Every monday i come down
here, buy 2 bags of feed

Regular as clock work.

2 bags of wheat
4 times a month.

755
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,200
That's 8 bags i'm supposed
to be billed for.

756
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,900
I don't know how else
to get through to you.

on a monday, mr. Schmitt.

in the month.

So you came in here 5--

760
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,800
Are you telling me there
were 5 weeks last month?

761
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,600
No, sir, i'm telling you
there were 5 mondays.

Listen, check that
calendar over there

If you don't believe me,
sir.

769
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,500
I need to talk to you.

770
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,100
Well, i'm a little busy
right now, jacob.

771
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:51,900
What is it?

772
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,500
Ok, listen, can you
meet me at the farm?

773
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,700
What farm?
Our farm.

774
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,600
Look, uh,
what is it?

775
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
On your lunch break.
12:30, ok?

776

Hey, are we straight
on this, mr. Schmitt?

out there right--

doing here?

Look out!
Ha ha ha ha ha.

783

What the hell'd you
drag me out here for?

784
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,200
Listen to this.
I'm gonna buy it back.

785
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,700
I'm gonna fix it up.
I'm gonna rebuild it

786
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,800
Just like it was
before mom and dad died.

787
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,900
Whoa, whoa. Come on, wait, wait.
We've been through all this.

788
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
We've been over this.

789
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,800
Once we split up the money,
we've gotta leave.

790
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,200
We have to go.

791
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,400
What do you--What do
you want me to do,

792
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,990
Just like that, just
drive off by myself?

793
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,200
Well, i mean,
suppose you stay.

794
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,000
Where are you gonna tell
people you got the money?

795
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,800
Oh, that's easy.

796
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,400
We just tell people
that sarah

797
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,300
Inherited some money.
It's easy.

798
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,900
Nobody around here knows
anything about her family.

799
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,600
You guys coulda just
bought the farm, you know,

800
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,100
And then left me to run it.

801
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,300
It's not gonna work.

802
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,000
I thought this was
gonna make you happy.

803
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,300
Jacob...

804
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,800
Farming? Come on.

805
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,800
You don't just buy a farm.
You gotta--You gotta work it.

806
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,200
You gotta know
about machinery and seed.

807
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,200
I know that.

808
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,600
No, you don't.

809
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,700
Fertilizers, pesticides,
herbicides,

810
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,300
Drainage, irrigation,
the weather?

811
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,200
Come on, you don't know
about any of that stuff.

812
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,500
You're gonna end up
just like dad.

813
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,900
Why do you think he
ended up like that?

814
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,700
I'll tell you how he
ended up like that.

815
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,900
He had 2 mortgages riding
on the place.

816
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,800
He couldn't make the payments.

817
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,400
Where do you think
the money went?

818
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,400
He was a bad businessman.

819
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,600
Where do you think
the money went?

820
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,300
No, you think he spent
it all on the farm?

821
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,950
I'll tell you exactly
where the money went.

822
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,300
4 years of college, bud.

823
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,300
Yeah, didn't you ever think
about how he paid for that?

824
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,500
Didn't that ever
occur to you?

825
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,600
No, my tuition was--

826
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,200
Listen, i'm supposed
to get the farm!

827
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,100
What do i get?!

828
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,600
I'm supposed
to get the farm.

829
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,600
You got--You got
the whole world. You can...

830
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,900
I don't wanna hear that.

831
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,600
You can go anywhere
you want.

832
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,900
This is what i want.

833
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,800
This is--This is where
i wanna be.

834
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,400
It's my home, hank.

835
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Shit.

836
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,000
Hey, honey.

837
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,500
What?

838
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,000
I wanna show you
something.

839
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,500
What is it?

840
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,000
I got this.

841
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,700
I had it sent over
from the other branch.

842
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,600
Look. Here it is.

843
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
"Heiress's body
id'd by feds."

844
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
$4.4 million ransom.

845
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,900
You see? This person
nobody knows

846
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,200
Has just disappeared
right into thin air.

847
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,300
Do you recognize one
of them from the plane?

848
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,800
I can't tell.

849
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,900
His face was...

850
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,700
What?

851
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,600
This changes it.

852
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,700
Why is that?

853
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,200
We can't say it isn't
stealing anymore.

854
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,000
Well, hank, it's
always been stealing.

855
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,400
We just didn't know who
we were stealing from.

856
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,300
We thought it was drug money.

857
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,100
We thought it was money
that we could find--

858
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,100
No, you thought that.

859
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,500
This is good.
I'm glad--

860
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:11,600
It's good?

861
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,600
Yes, it's good we know
where it's from,

862
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,900
Because i was starting
to get worried.

863
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,300
I thought that it might
be counterfeit or marked.

864
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,700
It might still be marked.

865
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,700
No, it says right here.

866
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,200
Look. Denomination
in unmarked bills.

867
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,500
Unmarked.

868
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You see?

869
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,400
You're just being
paranoid, hank.

870
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,700
It's over. It's good.

871
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,200
Man: sarah?

872
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,900
Would you
come here, please?

873
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,800
Sure. Ok. Just a second.

874
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,900
I'll see you tonight.

875
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,100
[Banging]

876
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,900
Ha ha ha ha ha.

877
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:33,900
Jesus.

878
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,900
Hey, come on, hank.
Open up.

879
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,400
What the hell
are you doing?

880
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,400
Hey, mr. Accountant.

881
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,100
Well, i've come to make
a tiny withdrawal.

882
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,900
Go home. Turn around
and go home right now.

883
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,800
Oh, come on, it's
freezing out here, hank.

884
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,900
Shh! Keep it down.

885
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,000
Invite me in.

886
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,500
All right,
just for a second.

887
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,400
I don't have time
for this shit.

888
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,100
I gotta get up
and go to work.

889
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,400
I want my share.

890
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,400
What?

891
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,600
I do. I want my share.

892
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,100
I don't have the money here,

893
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,100
And even if i did,
i wouldn't give you any.

894
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
Oh, come on, now.

895
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,900
Look, just because
you have it

896
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,200
Doesn't mean it's yours.
Part of that is my money.

897
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,100
Part of it might be
your money...

898
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,600
If we decide to keep it.

899
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,500
The plan was to sit
on the money

900
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,400
Till we decide that
it's safe to keep it.

901
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,300
Why are you coming over here
with this shit?

902
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,800
All right, look.

903
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,200
I'll tell you what.

904
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,700
Just give me
one packet, ok?

905
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,800
Just one packet.

906
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,200
And i'll come back
later for the rest.

907
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,600
Ask me again, and i'll go
burn it tomorrow morning.

908
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,600
Is that clear?

909
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,500
Bluff.

910
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,100
What?

911
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,600
It's a bluff.
B-L-U-F-F.

912
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,600
Oh, then why don't you
call it then

913
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,300
And just see what happens?

914
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,800
Yeah.

915
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,100
All right. Ok.

916
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,100
See, jacob told me

917
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,800
A little secret,
mister accountant.

918
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,800
I know what happened
to dwight stephanson.

919
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,600
You drank too much.

920
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,100
I want one
of those packets.

921
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,200
Well, i told you,
i don't have the money here,

922
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,400
And i hid it away
from the house.

923
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,500
Mm-Hmm. Well,
you know what?

924
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,900
It'd be a shame
if somebody

925
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,600
Was to drop a note
to carl jenkins

926
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,900
Saying there
might just be

927
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,400
A little something
suspicious about

928
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,300
Dwight stephanson's
accident.

929
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,300
He just drove off
that bridge?

930
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,600
Do you believe that?
Do you?!

Come on. Jesus, lou.

932

Remember, you're a thief, too.

933
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,200
We're all in this together.

934
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,700
If one of us goes to jail,
we all do.

935
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Oh, god.

936
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,600
I need my share, hank.

937
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,200
I do.

938
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,200
I'm broke...

$40?

945
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,200
That's all i got.

946
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,400
Maybe i can go to the bank

947
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,400
And get you a loan out
of our savings.

948
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,900
Look, look, look.

949
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,700
The money's a day's drive
from here.

950
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,400
Even if i wanted go get it,
i can't go get it,

Not till sarah
has the baby.

952

A day's drive?!

953
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,600
Yeah, that's right.

954
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,900
I put it in a storage locker
above the interstate.

955
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,600
What the hell is it
doing in a storage--

956
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,300
Shh! It's safe.
Don't worry, all right?

957
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,900
I didn't want it near us

958
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,500
In case we come under
any suspicion.

959
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,000
How the hell's
that gonna happen?

about the plane, huh?

All right.

965

But we go get it as
soon as she's done,

Split it up
right there...right?

I'm looking

Do you have a car seat

little baby?

It looked like
a little tomato.

told him that, huh?

to help me first.

that about the tree is

00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,300
Hey. You brought
him here?

1128
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,300
Well, yeah. I invited
him for dinner.

1129
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,900
Oh. Oh! Oh, good.

1130
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,100
Good, good.

1131
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,600
Ok.

1132
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,700
So he's gonna do it?

1133
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,600
I had to promise him
the farm.

1134
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,300
You what? Wait,
i thought you said--

1135
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,100
We agreed that you
were gonna say something.

1136
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,800
Where's he supposed
to go, sarah, huh?

1137
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,500
I mean, what's
he gonna do,

1138
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,300
Drive away?

1139
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,000
I don't know, honey.
I don't know,

1140
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,900
But if he stays,
we get caught.

1141
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,800
I know, i know.
It's just--

1142
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,800
It's just a matter of
time before he screws up.

1143
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,700
I know. That's
not what i'm saying.

1144
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,500
I just...

1145
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,400
I just wish he could,
that's all.

1146
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,200
[Laughter]
[laughter]

1147
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,000
No, no, you remember
what she did?

1148
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,700
She was so freaked out
that she called

1149
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,400
The volunteer
fire department,

1150
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,000
And then, remember,
they came out...

1151
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,700
Oh, yeah, there was
all of dad's buddies--

1152
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,400
All his drinkin'
buddies.

1153
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,000
Yeah, yeah.

1154
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,900
That's--That's all the volunteer
fire department was,

1155
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,700
Was guys he knew,
you know?

1156
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,900
So they show up--

1157
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,600
And he's sitting
there in the kitchen

1158
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,500
With that ice pack
on his face.

1159
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,900
That's ridiculous.
He felt like an idiot,

1160
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,000
'Cause they're
all gathered in there

1161
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,800
Like there's some huge
murder going down, you know?

1162
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,100
[Baby cries]

1163
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,300
Shh, shh.

1164
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,700
[Baby cries]

1165
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,800
Ok.

1166
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,800
[Baby cries]

1167
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,100
Well, back on call.

1168
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,600
Hey, how about
some more wine?

1169
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,400
You got a full
glass here.

1170
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,100
What's it like,
a walkie-Talkie, sarah,

1171
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,600
Kind of like a baby
walkie-Talkie?

1172
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,000
Yeah, yeah.
It's kinda cool.

1173
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,800
Remember, we had
that thing we did

1174
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,400
With them little
walkie-Talkies?

1175
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,000
Oh, yeah.

1176
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,500
You got that kit
for christmas.

1177
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,900
Remember that?

1178
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,800
Yeah.

1179
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,200
Yeah.

1180
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,400
You know, it's weird.

1181
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,800
I think--I think
about that stuff.

1182
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,900
I think it's kinda weird--

1183
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,700
You remember everything,
too, don't you?

1184
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,600
Well, yeah.
I was always--

1185
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,000
I was always
talking to dad.

1186
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,000
I know you were.

1187
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,800
I was always figuring out
what's going on, you know?

1188
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,200
I was always nervous about
shit, you know, i guess.

1189
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,200
But i tell you what,
he's a...
