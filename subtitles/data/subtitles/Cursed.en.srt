(# ''Lil' Red Riding hood''
by Bowling for Soup)

00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,202
# Who's that I see
walking in these woods?

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,544
# Why, it's Little Red Riding hood

4
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:19,813
# Hey there, Little Red Riding Hood

5
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:22,286
# You sure are looking good

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,655
# You're everything
that a big bad wolf would want

7
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:29,194
<i>Listen to me.</i>

8
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:32,364
# Little Red Riding Hood

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,097
# I don't think even big girls should

10
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:39,229
# Go walking
in these spooky old woods alone

11
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,169
# What big eyes you have

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,738
 You're obsessed with him,

13
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,942
 I'm not obsessed,
I'm just highly interested.

14
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,851
 Come on, Let's settle this.

15
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,853
Girls, please, sit, sit.

16
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,354
Let Zela read your palms.

17
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,856
Oh, no. Forget it. This is stupid.

18
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,085
so are you. sit down.

19
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,386
OK, Zela, this is it.

20
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,095
My friend here is basically obsessed
with this guy that won't call her back

21
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:11,763
and we need to know if she should forget
him cold or hold out for the next 20 years.

22
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:16,642
Well, anyways, whatever you see,
just say 'Forget his ass'.

23
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,641
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I need you to read my friend's.

24
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,912
Blood.

25
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,780
- Excuse me?
- I see blood.

26
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,979
so much blood.

27
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,617
OK, that's nice, but...

28
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,383
You too.

29
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,622
You're both in danger.

30
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,599
Need to know?
No, Back to the guy.

31
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,329
It's not the guy.

32
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,033
It's... it's the beast you should fear.

33
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,404
OK.

34
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,375
We're done here.

35
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:54,106
- Come on, Becky. Let's go.
- Beware the moon.

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,341
It feeds in the moonlight.

37
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,980
You can't tell people this shit.

38
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,048
Jenny.

39
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,524
Lay off the crack pipe.

40
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,527
Jenny.

41
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,509
Jenny!

42
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,197
- I'm gonna lock up in the back.
- OK, José.

43
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,870
Hey, looks like you got a visitor.

44
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:02,039
Hey, there, boy.
Where did you come from?

45
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,283
Come here.

46
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,012
Oh.

47
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,983
Zipper? Zip?

48
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,853
Zipper. Hey, hey, Zipper.

49
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,415
Hey.

50
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,462
- Oh, there you are, I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, He's adorable.

51
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,520
Come here.

52
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,192
I'm sorry. One minute he's here.
the next minute...

53
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,394
Wh... Hey, uh, Brooke, right?

54
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,101
- Do I know you?
- Oh, yeah, We go to school together.

55
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:32,270
I sit behind you in Government,
Algebra and French.

56
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,937
Oh, really?

57
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,281
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, Brooke Mueller, Jimmy Myers.

58
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,786
M- u, M-y,
I've sat behind you for, like, three years.

59
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,912
- Oh.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,754
- OK.
- Hey, Brooke, are you ready?

61
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,952
Yeah, almost, Five minutes.

62
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,654
- I'll see you at school.
- OK, yeah, No, I know.

63
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,560
Hey, I know you.

64
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,929
- From P.E.
- His name's Billy.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,833
- Uh, it's Jimmy.
- You're the dodgeball crotch target.

66
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,031
- You should really wear a cup.
- Stop it, Bo, OK?

67
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:04,270
I'm just looking out for him, He can't help it,
Every school's got one, the derogatory 'it,'

68
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,778
A geek on his way to fag town.

69
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,041
- Look, I'm not gay.
- Bummer.

70
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,209
You mean you're just
an ass wimp-wad for no reason?

71
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,311
- Yep.
- That sucks.

72
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,515
- Boo!
- Whoa!

73
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,184
You're such a dick, Bo.

74
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,286
Just ignore him, Jimmy.

75
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,389
- I think your dog is gay too.

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,766
 What's with the Make-A-Wish
charity case, Brooke?

77
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,207
- Hey, Ellie.
- Hi.

78
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,913
- Hello?
- Ellie.

79
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:49,977
- Hi, Jimmy.
- I'm waiting.

80
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,650
Yeah, I know, I stopped by Tinsel
on my way, to see Jake.

81
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,386
- But I'm your brother.
- I'll be there soon.

82
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,792
- Well, how soon?
- I said soon, OK?

83
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,057
- Do you know what can happen to me?
- Yes.

84
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,622
I know what can happen
to a teenager on Hollywood Boulevard.

85
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,167
- Do you?
- OK, Quit whining.

86
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,463
- Fine.
- Yeah. Bye.

87
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,864
Perfect.

88
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,745
- Excellent, Excellent!
- Cool.

89
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,718
50 grand well-spent.

90
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,723
- OK, Looking good up there now.
- You got it.

91
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,418
- Ellie.
- Hi.

92
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,485
Hi.

93
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,698
- How's it going?
- We're not even close to finished.

94
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:39,761
I got four days work and the opening's
in two, I am drowning in stress.

95
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,433
Kiss me again.

96
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,339
- What are you doing here?

97
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,208
- That's good, I told you, That's good.
- I haven't seen you in days.

98
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,477
I wanted to make sure you were still alive.
What is this?

99
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,780
It's a medieval torture device.

100
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,753
Which could actually be fun later.

101
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,518
Come on,
I'll give you the two-second tour.

102
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:01,082
Spanish lnquisition,

103
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,788
Frankenstein's laboratory,

104
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,888
Dracula’s coffin,

105
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,528
What's that?

106
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,263
Oh, that.

107
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:16,274
That is a sterling replica to commemorate
the 50th anniversary of the Wolf Man.

108
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,902
It was donated by the Chaney estate.

109
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,240
Wow.

110
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,804
Planet Hollywood
has nothing on you guys.

111
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,749
Shh, we don't mention them here.

112
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,246
so, I was thinking,

113
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,018
I'll be here for the opening,
and you'll be here.

114
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,753
So how about we be here together?

115
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,557
If I was actually going to the opening.

116
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,033
What do you mean? You have to go.
It's your big night. You have to show off.

117
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,695
All I wanna do is crawl into bed
and disappear for three days.

118
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,739
Well, even better.

119
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,297
I'll crawl in too.

120
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,611
 Excuse me,
I need a signature on this.

121
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,616
Damn. Can you hold on for one second?

122
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,952
-  Right there.
-  Thanks.

123
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,150
Yeah.

124
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,659
Jake?

125
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,924
Is there something wrong?

126
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:17,235
No. There's nothing wrong. I'm just
stressed out with work and this madness.

127
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:20,898
I just... I need some time
and some space.

128
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,838
OK.

129
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:29,743
Just call me, when you feel like it,
you know. No pressure.

130
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,729
I waited over an hour for you.

131
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,706
I'm sorry, OK?

132
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,369
- Do you want to drop it?
- For over an hour, I waited.

133
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,470
Yeah, well, most teenagers
have friends who give them a lift home.

134
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,675
- But then I couldn't inconvenience you.
- Not tonight, Jimmy, Can we just not fight?

135
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,176
Watch out!

136
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,779
-  Are you OK?
- Yeah,

137
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,542
Zipper.

138
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,140
It's OK, boy.

139
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:43,018
Someone could be hurt.
Find my cellphone. Call for help.

140
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,866
- Hello?
-  Oh, God, Help me, Please!

141
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,775
I'm coming.

142
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,444
 Help me, please!

143
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,644
I'm coming.
I'm trying to get to you.

144
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,892
- Are you OK?
- Please just get me out of here, I'm stuck.

145
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,928
OK. OK.

146
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,555
Oh, God, Help!

147
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,725
- Help me, God.
- Can you feel your legs?

148
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:33,161
- I think so, The dashboard's just caved in.
- OK.

149
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,835
- Do you have a jack?
- Uh, yeah, Yeah, It's in the trunk.

150
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,938
All right, I'm gonna try to go get it, OK?
I'll be right back.

151
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,984
OK, Hurry, please!

152
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,124
 Oh, God.

153
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:57,026
- Hello? Hello? No, no, I can't hear you.

154
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,996
- Shit, AT&&T...

155
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,330
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, stop! stop!

156
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:09,131
- Jesus, people, what's wrong with you?
- 911 emergency. Hello? Hello?

157
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,143
- Hello? Wait, wait, Can you hear me now?
- 911 emergency. Yes, I can, sir.

158
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,838
- All right, listen, there's been a wreck.
- Where, sir?

159
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,746
I'm on Mulholland Drive,
just east of Coldwater.

160
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,727
- Jesus.
- Hey, calm down, It's just me.

161
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,565
- I called for help.
- Oh, good.

162
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,936
 What's going on out there?

163
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,100
I couldn't get the trunk open.

164
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,838
but help's on the way, OK?
Just hold on a few more minutes.

165
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,143
- Do you hear that?
- What?

166
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,275
I hear dripping, like leaking.

167
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,582
Do you smell gas? I smell gas.
Oh, God, The car's gonna blow up.

168
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,318
- No, no, no, The car is not gonna blow up.
- Uh, actually it could.

169
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,850
- Jesus Christ, get me the fuck out of here!
- OK, all right, all right.

170
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,260
Let me try.

171
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,994
Uh, hi.

172
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,898
- If I could get up, underneath...
- Just do it!

173
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,130
OK, OK. All right.

174
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:16,004
- Wait, All right, I think I'm getting it.
- Oh, God. Please, please.

175
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,100
 Wait,
can you be still for a second?

176
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:22,341
You try flipping your car down a mountain
and then being fucking still.

177
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,481
Maybe you guys should hurry up.

178
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,349
-  All right. Calm down.
-  I am calm!

179
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,117
-  I think I'm getting it.

180
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,090
All right. OK.

181
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,852
- OK, I got it.
- Oh, my God. Thank you.

182
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,896
Oh, help me with the seat belt.

183
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,625
Oh, shit.

184
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,396
Oh, shit, OK.

185
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,460
- OK, OK.
- Oh.

186
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,529
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

187
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:51,167
- My legs... There's help. They hurt.

188
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,504
The police are coming.

189
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,810
Yeah, well.
I hope you guys have insurance.

190
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,045
What? No, no, it was an accident. We hit
an animal, or it hit us. I'm not even sure.

191
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,179
- It wasn't a dog, was it?
- Actually, it was...

192
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,954
Ellie! Hold on to me.

193
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,836
 Jimmy!

194
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,239
No!

195
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,373
 Jimmy!

196
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,655
 Ellie.

197
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,525
Go! Go!

198
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,427
- Do you think she...?
- No, No, go, Go, go, go,

199
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,975
Oh, Jimmy.

200
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,978
Shit, look at your arm.

201
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,117
The police.

202
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,332
No!.

203
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:51,954
- They're ready for us now.
- They said it was pretty nasty.

204
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:57,733
Let me get this straight. It took a bite
out of your arm, but you didn't see it at all?

205
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,931
Well, it all happened so fast
and it was dark.

206
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:05,670
Well, I saw it, It was a wolf, but bigger.
It was like a monster wolf.

207
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,042
Yeah, Jimmy,
I have your statement already.

208
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,673
Fine, don't believe me.
I know what I saw.

209
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,445
What happened to her...

210
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,181
What kind of an animal could do that?

211
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,348
A mountain lion, a bear, maybe.

212
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:23,726
There hasn't been a wolf sighting
in southern California in over 70 years.

213
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,287
- Mountain lion, my ass.
- Jimmy.

214
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,697
Please.

215
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,565
Why don't you go check on Zipper?

216
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,169
Don't worry.
Whatever it was, we'll find it.

217
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,608
Hey, buddy, are you OK?

218
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,580
Zipper?

219
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,015
- What's wrong?

220
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,178
Hey, smell, It's just me.

221
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,916
Hey! Hey, look what you did.

222
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,089
That's enough with the biting.

223
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,661
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

224
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:07,731
- Hey, you guys be safe.
-  All right, come on. Let's go.

225
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,944
Hey.

226
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,487
- Hey, Zipper. Come on in.

227
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,184
Hey, Zipper, come on in.

228
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,487
Hey. Whoa.

229
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,721
Freak.

230
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,235
- Well, good night.
- Hey.

231
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,770
What?

232
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,830
Don't you wanna talk
about what happened tonight?

233
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,275
- What's there to talk about?
- Jimmy, we were attacked.

234
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,937
We saw a girl get torn apart.

235
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,847
You wanna talk about the bear
or the mountain lion?

236
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:55,717
Look, I know you're mad at me,
but I didn't see what you saw.

237
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,485
I'm sorry,
but I don't know what else to say.

238
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:03,221
OK, well, uh, thanks for the talk.
Good night.

239
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,263
Oh, come on, Jimmy.

240
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,925
I'm trying here.

241
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,953
'Unsolved...'

242
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,755
OK.

243
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,835
Jesus, '1600 animal attacks...'

244
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,101
'...large wolf-like animals...'

245
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,771
Oh, my God.

246
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,838
Jesus.

247
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:27,054
- Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
- What are you doing here?

248
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,184
I just... I needed to talk to you.

249
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:33,254
I found the extra key under the mat.
I'm really sorry.

250
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,199
I just, I feel so terrible
about how we left things tonight.

251
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:41,171
- Jake, what's going on?
- I'm just scared, Ellie.

252
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,401
I'm scared.

253
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,836
I never expected
to meet a woman like you.

254
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,318
Jake, you're the only good thing
that's happened in my life in a long time.

255
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,752
I'm scared too.

256
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,949
I'm terrified,

257
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:02,892
because all the good things
keep going away.

258
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,965
I'm not going anywhere.

259
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:20,933
<i>Here in Los Angeles,
a young woman was attacked and killed</i>

260
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,304
<i>by an unidentified wild animal</i>

261
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:27,334
<i>when her car ran off the road last night,
high in the Hollywood hills.</i>

262
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,812
<i>the victim's name has yet to be released.</i>

263
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:34,341
<i>It happened on a remote stretch of
Mulholland Drive, shortly before midnight.</i>

264
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,855
<i>Animal control officers speculate
that it might have been a bear</i>

265
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,858
<i>that wandered into the area
in search of water.</i>

266
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:44,225
<i>It is the first such fatal attack
in Los Angeles...</i>

267
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:10,483
- Hey.
- How are you doing? Did you sleep OK?

268
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,887
I woke up in the bushes.

269
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,324
You woke up where?

270
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,760
Are you feeling OK?
I'm calling Dr, Steinberg.

271
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:21,765
No, no, I'm fine. Really.
Actually... I feel kinda great.

272
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,997
OK.

273
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:29,100
But I'm gonna make an appointment. They
said we should follow up with another shot.

274
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:32,371
For all we know,
that wolf could've had rabies.

275
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,843
Oh. Oh, so now it's a wolf.

276
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,676
Jimmy, I never said it wasn't.
I just said I didn't see it.

277
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,613
It was more like a werewolf.

278
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,015
And I found this website last night
and according to legend.

279
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,987
a werewolf feeds during the lunar cycle -
that's the three nights around the full moon.

280
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,955
Last night was the first moon
of the lunar cycle.

281
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,754
Why can't you just download porn
like other teenage boys?

282
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,823
Excuse me for trying
to make conversation.

283
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,526
OK, so what would a werewolf
be doing in LA?

284
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,967
shouldn't it be off in the countryside
somewhere, terrorizing helpless maidens?

285
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:04,998
Maybe it's a hip werewolf, Maidens come
here with the perfectly implanted breasts.

286
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,772
- You should get to school,
- Hey, I was bitten by a werewolf.

287
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,542
If that's not good enough for a sick day...
I could be cursed.

288
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,913
Everybody's cursed, Jimmy.
It's called life.

289
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,849
No, I mean by the mark of the beast.

290
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,788
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

291
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,305
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

292
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,841
-  Whoa, Hey, Ellie.
- Hey, Kyle.

293
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:46,509
Hey, '70s retro week is booking up, Do we
want Keith Partridge or Marcia Brady?

294
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,382
- Only one slot left.
- Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.

295
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:52,014
You look different today,
saucy, I like it.

296
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,253
- Yeah, it's new, Gauze look.
- Nice, What happened?

297
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,093
- Oh, you don't wanna know.
- Hey, are you OK?

298
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,632
Yeah. Actually, I'm fine.

299
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,359
Incoming psycho publicist, one o'clock.

300
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,894
...no trades, Oh, I have to go.
Yeah, OK, Goodbye.

301
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,533
Hi,

302
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,203
I didn't recognize you
with your hair down.

303
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,647
I just wanted to drop by to make sure we
were set for Scott’s pre-interview tonight.

304
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:21,948
- Absolutely, Nine o'clock.
- Great, Is that what you're gonna wear?

305
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,547
Hey, I heard that you're dating
Jake Taylor, Is that true?

306
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,616
- I hope it's nothing serious.
- Why not?

307
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,786
I guess it was only a matter of time
before he got to you.

308
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,423
- He always did prefer the vulnerable ones.
- OK, well, I'll see you tonight, Joannie.

309
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,559
I'm only saying this because I care.

310
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,070
Is there anything else, Joannie?

311
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,538
No, Tonight, Don't be late.

312
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,337
- OK, Thank you.
- OK.

313
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,373
Putting on weight, Kyle?

314
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,879
- What a piece of work.
- I do not like that woman.

315
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:59,754
- No, Apparently Jake didn't either.
- I didn't even know that she knew him.

316
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:03,316
- Do you think she's right about him?
- No, The woman's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

317
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:09,129
But I'm not the one dating him.
I just know he's not the only guy in town.

318
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,236
What smells so good?

319
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,472
I... I don't smell anything.

320
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,265
I get these.

321
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:52,242
It's nothing, I'll live.

322
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,207
The blood freaking you out?

323
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,785
- Hey, Brooke, you need some change?
- Hey, Jimmy.

324
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,089
That'd be great.
Stupid thing won't take my dollar.

325
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,629
Oh, yeah, OK, Actually...

326
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,029
- I'll hold those.
- Thanks.

327
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,059
Werewolves, huh?

328
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,503
Oh, it's just a stupid report I'm doing.

329
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,508
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

330
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,739
No, keep your money.
It's on me, Thanks.

331
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,076
- Geek juice.

332
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:34,608
- Trying out for the wrestling team, Jimmy?
- Oh, no, I don't wrestle.

333
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:39,487
Oh, I'd think all that male-to-male contact
would be right up your alley.

334
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:45,086
Is, uh... Is that the appeal for you?

335
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,926
Oh, Back talk.

336
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,466
Haven't you been team captain
for, like, two years now?

337
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,195
Nicely done, Jimmy.

338
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:54,799
Did you just attempt a confrontation?

339
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,033
- Yeah, maybe.
- Let me know when you're sure.

340
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,748
Just ignore him, Jimmy.

341
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:08,316
Let's get out of here
before we get homo-stained.

342
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,547
Hey, Hey.

343
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:17,284
(# ''freaks come Out At Night''
by Whodini)

344
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,287
# Now the party's jumping,
the place is packed

345
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,595
# But when the crowd's like this
I'm ready to rap

346
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,760
# But before I could
bust a thyme on the mic

347
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,270
# freaks are all over me
like white on rice

348
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,033
# freaks come in all shapes
and sizes and colors

349
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,541
# But what I like about them most
is that they're real good lovers

350
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,634
# they do it in the park,
they do it in the dark

351
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,509
# But most freaks are known
for breaking hearts

352
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,411
Joannie.

353
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,641
- Joannie.
- There you are.

354
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,210
What is this? Come as
your favorite endangered species?

355
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,983
Obnoxious, isn't it?

356
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,786
I just feel a little underdressed
without a tail.

357
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:53,855
Well, that's part of your charm,
Take this, I will tell Scott that you're here.

358
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,128
 Well, I think you look fantastic.

359
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,264
- What are you doing here?
- I needed to see you.

360
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:05,708
What about the opening?
Disappearing for a few days.

361
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:11,080
- That didn't go over so well, did it?
- You know what? It's fine.

362
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:14,346
We've only been seeing each other
a couple of months, you need your space.

363
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,081
I get it, It's fine.

364
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:22,115
Please don't do that. Don't try
to make everything OK when it's not.

365
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:25,526
Can I talk to you in private for a second?

366
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,064
Ellie.

367
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:39,601
That was my MO for a long time. When
anything would get too close or too serious.

368
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,838
I would just run away.

369
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,074
For...

370
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:48,051
For a variety of reasons
that I can't even begin to go into.

371
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:53,318
I don't want to do that with us. This thing,
you and me, this is special, Ellie.

372
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,723
and I just don't want to lose you,

373
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,558
so I was hoping that, maybe,

374
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,589
you could just bear with me
for a little while longer.

375
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:07,161
I guess I'm learning about these things
as we go along.

376
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:14,143
Well, maybe I'll finish up here
and we can go someplace to talk.

377
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,045
OK. Thank you, Ellie.

378
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,811
Well, hi, there, Remember me?

379
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:20,908
Uh...

380
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,852
- Jenny Tate, Becky Morton's friend.
- Right. Of course, Jenny.

381
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,913
- It's good to see you again, I was actually...
- Jake.

382
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,651
- Hi.
- Hi. Long time no see.

383
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:31,821
Sorry to interrupt an awkward moment,
but we're ready for you.

384
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,796
I have to go.

385
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,724
- Ellie.
- I'm working.

386
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:42,034
So, Becky cannot stop talking about you.

387
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,472
She's gonna die
when she finds out you were here.

388
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:45,975
Excuse me, I have to go.

389
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:52,506
I know it was only a couple of dates, but
Becky is really bummed you haven't called.

390
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:57,419
Next time you speak with her, tell her I'm
sorry, but I've taken myself off the market.

391
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,752
Now I'm nummed.

392
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,985
Thanks for coming,
I appreciate it, see you later.

393
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,052
Scott, this is Ellie Myers
from the Craig Kilborn show.

394
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,427
- Oh, hi, How are you?
- Hi, It's a pleasure to meet you.

395
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,693
I've been a huge fan of yours
ever since happy Days.

396
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:13,464
Thank you. Listen, I appreciate you
meeting me here, I couldn't bail on tonight.

397
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,664
It's fine.

398
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,730
You guys have a nice chat.
I'll be over here if you need me.

399
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,639
OK.

400
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,543
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

401
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,878
Craig is so excited
to have you on his show.

402
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:28,282
I think it's gonna be
just a fabulous line-up.

403
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,679
You'll be going on third,
after Ashton Kutcher and Carrot Top.

404
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,657
- Third?
- Uh...

405
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,853
I thought that we would start
with a Chachi clip,

406
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,192
and then move on
to something from Charles in charge.

407
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,391
- Original.
- And, uh...

408
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,264
and then we could...

409
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:50,236
segue into what you're doing now.

410
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,303
What are you doing now?

411
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,579
You know, you're a beautiful girl.

412
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:04,048
I mean, you've got this aura thing
happening, l...

413
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,682
I just can't quite put my finger on it.

414
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,352
Not when you can use your whole hand.

415
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:13,386
Thank you, I think that's really
all we needed to discuss

416
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,762
and I'll see you in the studio.

417
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,097
- OK, You got it.
- OK.

418
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,138
Wanna finish your drink?

419
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,175
No, Bye.

420
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,409
Okey-doke.

421
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,110
Excuse me.

422
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,517
-  Hey, where are you going?
-  Call us!

423
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,487
Ellie.

424
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,456
Ellie, wait up.

425
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:43,460
Jake, I really don't feel well tonight,
I just wanna get home.

426
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,986
Be careful with this one.
He's trouble.

427
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,659
- Who's the leopard?
- Someone I met before I met you.

428
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:57,572
- They keep popping up, don't they?
- Ellie, that was a previous life.

429
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,872
Please, you gotta trust me on this.

430
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:03,107
You know what?
I think it's my turn to be weird.

431
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,378
I'm gonna take a cue from you
and disappear for a few days.

432
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,442
Ellie, people can change.

433
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,977
I really don't wanna get into it right now.

434
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,495
Close, close, close, close!

435
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,236
Oh, my God.

436
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:02,052
Hello? Hello? Anybody there?
Hello? Hello?

437
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,306
Get me the fuck out of here!
Open up!

438
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,820
- Hey.
- Hi.

439
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,898
Are you doing homework?

440
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,735
I'm just reading up
on how you kill a werewolf.

441
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,241
Silver, right?

442
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:10,337
No, you actually have to separate the head
from the heart, silver just hurts a lot.

443
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,609
It might not be such a bad deal.
Think about it.

444
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,483
increased strength, heightened senses,
an unnatural sexual allure.

445
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,022
When do we sprout hair and pointy ears?

446
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,820
It's all a little sketchy,
but maybe never, maybe tomorrow.

447
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:24,053
The experts can't really agree
on that one.

448
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:28,226
You're starting to freak me out, Jimmy.
This is fiction, Myth.

449
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,790
We live in reality.
Come back to the other side.

450
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:35,134
I know, I know, but the line between
fiction and fact has always been a thin one.

451
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,903
Don't we have enough problems? Do you
really wanna add this one to the list?

452
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:42,412
OK, here.
Check this out. Here.

453
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,846
It's a five-pointed star.
It's a pentagram.

454
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,406
It's the mark of the beast.

455
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,420
Jimmy, this is ridiculous.
You need...

456
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,547
Whoa, Jesus.

457
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,220
Wait, is this for real?

458
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,824
Last night was difficult, OK?

459
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,061
The wreck, the girl dying,
it brought up a lot of stuff.

460
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,865
- No, no, no, Ellie, don't start with that.
- I know we don't talk about it enough.

461
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:10,873
- It has nothing to do with Mom and Dad.
- I miss them too.

462
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,136
Your hand.
It's a creepy coincidence.

463
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,279
This is some pretty freaky shit.
Admit it.

464
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,776
OK, OK.

465
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,279
Let's put it to the test.

466
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,890
I bought this frame myself,
three years ago.

467
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,898
It's from Tiffany's.
It's sterling silver.

468
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:39,629
Now, if I'm a werewolf.
I shouldn't be able to pick it up, right?

469
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:44,333
- It should hurt me, right?
- According to chapter four, yeah.

470
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,850
Go to bed, Jimmy.
It's late.

471
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,007
shut up!

472
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:06,248
shut up

473
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,412
Don't forget.
I'm working the opening of Tinsel tonight.

474
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:40,480
- I've gotta take Craig down the red carpet.
- OK.

475
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:58,374
Hello?

476
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:03,006
Hey, Jake's been calling all morning,
says he needs to talk.

477
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,846
Well, I don't need to talk to him,
What's with the gypsies?

478
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:11,513
Oh, it's auditions for Craig's séance
segment. What is with this new look?

479
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:17,221
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not complaining, I think you look hot.

480
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:21,561
- You're in danger.
- Excuse me?

481
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,930
It will come for you.

482
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:28,563
Don't let this getup fool you, I'm not a joke.
I've got the gift, I blame my mother.

483
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,630
Why are you talking to me?

484
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,939
You bear the markings of the beast.

485
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:40,074
Look, I'm not trying to freak you out,
but you've been infected. You're cursed.

486
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,142
You've got to sever the line of the beast.
It's the only way to break the curse.

487
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,950
OK, all psychics
back in their seats, please.

488
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:48,992
The beast is human too.
Don't forget that.

489
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:52,392
- And it's closer to you than you think.
- If you could just follow me.

490
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:57,662
Shouldn't you psychically know
when you're annoying someone?

491
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,596
Thank you.

492
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:06,975
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Excuse me, Miss, Get up and get out.

493
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,606
Look at him.

494
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:25,657
Yeah!

495
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,175
Oh, Brooke, hey.

496
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:48,241
- Are you stalking me?
- Maybe.

497
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,385
What's going on, Brooke?
You going fruit fly on me?

498
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:57,518
Actually, we were just talking,
but, if you don't mind... shoo.

499
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,329
Oh, you are asking for it, Abercrombie.

500
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,490
Come on, Bo.
You're really becoming transparent.

501
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:04,124
How about a little
identity intervention, OK?

502
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:08,570
'Cause all this internalized homophobia's
giving you away.

503
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,507
- You better watch your ass.
- What's going on?

504
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:16,512
I'm just giving Jimmy some pointers.

505
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,574
- He's here to try out for the team.
- Really? You?

506
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:24,044
Are you sure
you want to do that, Jimmy?

507
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,180
Oh, sure he does, coach.

508
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:29,919
I'll tell you what.
I'll wrestle him.

509
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:36,889
No, Louie, you and Jimmy take the mat.

510
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,629
Jimmy, suit up.

511
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,198
He's so dead.

512
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:52,775
- OK, limp wrist, stay away from my groin.

513
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:57,485
Take him down, Louie.
Take him down.

514
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,729
- Have you had enough?
- Uh-uh.

515
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,289
- Let him up.

516
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,494
- Watch his nails, Lou!

517
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:15,129
He might scratch your eyes out!

518
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:33,081
- You OK, Lou?
- All right.

519
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,620
- Let me take a crack, coach.
- Are you up for it, Jimmy?

520
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:42,790
Yeah.

521
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:44,959
Go for it, Bo.

522
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:55,607
- Come on, fairy, shake your dust.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

523
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:01,476
Come on, fag, What?
Do you like that? Huh?

524
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,650
Wait, no...

525
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:35,746
You know the best part about being a fairy?
You get to fly.

526
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:43,749
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

527
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,994
- Ashton Kutcher's up first.
- God, he's so overexposed.

528
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:54,504
stick to his film career as talk points.
Don't linger on the TV stuff.

529
00:47:54,571 --> 00:48:00,441
And if he doesn't mention the lnternet
sex scandal, just don't bring it up.

530
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,070
OK, you know what?
I've done this before.

531
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,512
- OK, I bump Baio.
- What?

532
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,380
I'm living dangerously.
Carrot Top's rehearsal was funny.

533
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:11,615
I'm gonna let the Top go long.
Randy's dealing with it.

534
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:14,452
- OK.
- My mouth's dry.

535
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:16,082
Thanks.

536
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,526
- You want me to do that?
- I got it. Ouch. Dammit! Look.

537
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:22,064
What happened?

538
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:25,192
- Do you have a tissue?
- Just stare at it.

539
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,765
<i>It's the Late Late Show
with Craig Kilborn.</i>

540
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,708
OK, Go, Go! You're on.

541
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:37,076
<i>Mr Craig Kilborn.</i>

542
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,520
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Ellie?

543
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,895
What the fuck do you mean.
'Scott’s been bumped?'

544
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:59,393
- I just heard, We'll reschedule.
- Reschedule, my ass.

545
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:02,336
- I'm sorry, The show was running long.
- Then bump Carrot Top.

546
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:05,273
It's Scott Baio, He shouldn't be
going after Carrot Top anyway.

547
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:06,969
- He should be first.
- I'll make it up to you.

548
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:10,775
- Listen to me, you little...
- Don't start with me!

549
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:32,527
Hi, Ellie.

550
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,513
Are you OK in there?

551
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,606
I'm fine.

552
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:53,017
You don't sound fine.

553
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:07,668
What's the matter?

554
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:16,071
Ellie?

555
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,977
No!

556
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:26,918
Ellie.

557
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:36,564
Ellie, your hand.

558
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,011
Ellie.

559
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,211
What's wrong?

560
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:56,719
I'm just having a really bad day.

561
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:59,582
Just leave.

562
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,351
Can I help?

563
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:06,590
Get the hell out of here! Get out!

564
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:32,652
Hey, Jake.

565
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,417
- Jimmy.
- Hey.

566
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:36,891
Cool place.
Are all clubs like this?

567
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,123
I sure hope not or I'm in nig trouble.

568
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:44,589
So what's up, Jimmy?
What are you doing here?

569
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:49,071
Yeah, l... I kind of need someone
to talk to. Is that OK?

570
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:52,803
Yeah, of course it is,
step inside.

571
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:58,906
OK, look, Ellie won't admit it, but ever since
the other night things have been different.

572
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:01,109
- We're different.
- What night? What are you talking about?

573
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:03,516
- Didn't Ellie tell you?
- No, Tell me what?

574
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:08,524
We were in a wreck in the canyon.
A girl was killed.

575
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:11,254
she was ripped apart.

576
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:12,989
By...

577
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:15,463
I don't know, by some kind of animal.

578
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:18,729
Whatever it was bit me and now
things have been happening to me.

579
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,896
Things I can't explain.
Jake, I know it sounds crazy.

580
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,499
nut I think it was a...

581
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,668
a werewolf.

582
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:29,769
Hm,

583
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:33,239
- What does your sister say about all this?
- You know Ellie.

584
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:37,685
Deny and avoid. It's her thing. But it got
her too and now I think we're cursed.

585
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:39,779
Look, I almost
took a guy's head off in gym.

586
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:44,520
I'm not the kind of guy to take
another guy's head off, I mean, look at me.

587
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:46,960
What if it comes back?

588
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:53,060
I mean, I know enough to know that it's
a who, not a what, so it could be pissed off.

589
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:54,626
It may want to finish what it started.

590
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:57,036
Jimmy, I think
you just need to calm down.

591
00:52:57,107 --> 00:53:00,599
I think the best thing we can do
is just call your sister.

592
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:04,670
Get her down here and maybe the three
of us should just sit down and discuss it.

593
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:08,445
I don't want to discuss this, I've been
cursed, something bad is gonna happen.

594
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,509
I can... Look, I can feel it.

595
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:13,522
Jimmy, listen to yourself.

596
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:16,423
Werewolves?

597
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:21,360
- This was a mistake, sorry I bothered you.
- Jimmy.

598
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:23,763
No, no, Thanks.

599
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,117
Jesus Christ.

600
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:32,492
- Bo, What are you doing here?
- I just wanted to, kind of, talk.

601
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,367
About that stuff you said today.

602
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,808
What stuff?

603
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:45,047
About me,
I was just wondering how you knew.

604
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,948
No one else did, just you.

605
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:52,614
And I've been so shitty to you,
And then I thought,

606
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:55,852
why wouldn't you know?
It takes one to know one, right?

607
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:59,793
- Of course, you would know.
- Know what?

608
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,060
Whoa, Whoa,
What are you doing?

609
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,502
I'm gay.

610
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:13,508
I just can't keep it in anymore, I had to tell
you, you're the only other gay guy I know.

611
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:16,773
Whoa, OK, stop. No, I'm not gay.
Not that there's anything wrong with it.

612
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:21,545
- This is hard for me. Don't be like this.
- Trust me, Bo. I'm not gay. I'm cursed.

613
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:25,520
I know, sure feels like that, doesn't it?
Not being able to tell anyone.

614
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:28,386
- Talk to anyone about it.
- No, I'm cursed by the mark of the beast.

615
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:29,982
Bo.

616
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,494
I'm a werewolf.

617
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:37,859
Come on, Jimmy. You don't
have to pretend anymore. Not with me.

618
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:42,735
No, it's part of the curse. I'm appealing.
I have an unnatural sexual allure.

619
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,501
Yeah, yeah, you do, I know.

620
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:46,735
Look, dude, I'm happy for you.
You be gay. It's a good thing.

621
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:50,940
Unfortunately, I got my own shit
to take care of, so best of luck. Yay, go gay.

622
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,414
And I'll see you.

623
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:56,448
Hey, Jimmy, wait.

624
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,918
Jimmy.

625
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,912
- Liar.

626
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,281
Hey, Zipper.

627
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,184
Hey.

628
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:44,956
Hey.

629
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,628
Hey, Zipper.
Hey, that's mine.

630
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:51,105
Hey, Hey, Zipper. Drop it.

631
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,600
Hey, No, drop it.

632
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,204
Zip.

633
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,747
Hey, Hey, come on.
Get out of it. Let's go.

634
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:03,479
No, Zipper!

635
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:04,747
Zipper.

636
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:18,434
- Zipper.

637
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:22,266
- Bo, what are you doing here?
- We're not through yet.

638
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:25,136
No, no, no.
We gotta go. Now.

639
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:29,434
- Holy shit.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go! Come on.

640
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,412
Fuck me.

641
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,426
- What the fuck was that?
- That was my dog.

642
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:54,061
- What kind of dog do you have?
- I have a regular dog.

643
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:57,197
Or he was, until he bit me.
I infected him.

644
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:01,200
- I told you. I'm a werewolf.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

645
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:05,141
- You're fucking serious.
- Yeah.

646
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:08,673
Look, I gotta find my sister.
Give me your cellphone.

647
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:12,812
Thanks, I know. Just keep your eyes on the
road, all right? Animals, they sometimes...

648
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:21,628
shit, stupid canyons. Look,
she's going to a club opening, at Tinsel.

649
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:24,826
- Oh, on the strip. Got it, I'm with you.
- OK, All right, settle down.

650
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:36,835
<i>...killed 23 people
and wounded more than 100 on Saturday.</i>

651
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:41,213
<i>In breaking news,
is a wild beast terrorizing the Southland?</i>

652
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,752
<i>Another woman,
Jenny rate of Studio city,</i>

653
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,948
<i>was torn to pieces
at a charity benefit last night.</i>

654
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:50,618
<i>Authorities have linked the incident
to a similar attack on Mulholland Drive</i>

655
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:54,493
<i>just two nights ago, where Becky Morton
was mauled to death by an animal...</i>

656
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:57,328
I'll drink, you can drive.

657
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,459
Ready?

658
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:03,870
Kyle, can you cover for me tonight?
I've gotta get home.

659
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,274
You're gonna miss Jake's big opening?

660
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:10,176
- Ellie?
- I guess.

661
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:18,454
- Good night, Ellie.
- Oh, good night.

662
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,093
Ellie.

663
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,763
Ellie, please.

664
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,801
You scared me.

665
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:46,280
I'm sorry,
but I needed to talk to you, Ellie.

666
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,817
You haven't been returning my calls.

667
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:52,719
You knew those girls, Becky and Jenny.

668
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,451
They're both dead.

669
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:59,621
I know, but, Ellie,
I can explain everything.

670
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:01,220
Ellie!

671
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:05,159
Ellie, Ellie!

672
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,243
Get out of the car, Ellie.

673
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,510
Please.

674
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,395
Look, I'm sorry about your window.
I didn't mean to do that.

675
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:38,491
but I have a lot of things
that I have to explain to you

676
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:43,938
and they're all going to sound a little crazy
so I just need you to hear me out.

677
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:46,202
Give me back my keys first.

678
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,877
What attacked you in the canyon
wasn't just an animal.

679
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:02,357
- What was it?
- You already know the answer to that.

680
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,655
You can feel the changes, can't you?

681
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:11,460
Ellie!

682
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:35,179
How's it going? These are my plus-ones
right here, all the way to the end, there.

683
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,522
Hey, man.

684
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:40,892
- Hey, Bo, can I use your cell?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

685
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:45,366
Hey, I'm gonna go look.
see if anybody's seen your sister,

686
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:53,731
- Hello?
- Ellie?

687
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,438
- Jimmy, thank God. Where are you?
- I'm at Tinsel.

688
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:57,740
- What?
- No, it's OK.

689
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:00,180
What are you doing there?
I'm on my way home.

690
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:03,082
Ellie, don't go home. Look,
I infected Zipper and he's gone werewolf.

691
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:06,679
- You gotta believe me. Look, it's all true.
- I believe you, OK?

692
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,883
I'd believe anything at this point.

693
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,222
- Jimmy, it's Jake.
- What? Jake?

694
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,353
he's the one who attacked us.
he's the werewolf.

695
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:17,388
- Ellie, I'm freaking out.
- Kyle should be there, OK? Just find him.

696
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:20,561
stay low.
Jake is definitely gonna be there.

697
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:22,968
I'll be there as soon as I can.

698
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:35,074
Jimmy. Have you seen Ellie?
I just really need to find her, right away.

699
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:37,413
- Jake, Hi.
- Hi.

700
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,421
- The place looks amazing.
- Thank you.

701
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,855
- lncredible. Congratulations. Excuse me.
- Wait, Jimmy, I really need to...

702
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,950
Did I introduce you to Scott?
Scott, this is Jake.

703
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:47,427
- Hey, man. How are you doing?
- Good, thanks, Thanks for coming.

704
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:50,762
Can I excuse myself for one second?

705
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,266
- Jimmy?
- What am I doing here?

706
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:56,237
Do you have any idea who I had to blow
to get you in here tonight?

707
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:58,569
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?

708
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,946
- That thing looks real.
- I think it is.

709
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:07,073
- Find your sister?
- No, actually...

710
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:10,085
- Oh, shit, shit, shit.
- What? Is he a werewolf hunter?

711
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,279
No, no, He's trouble.

712
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:14,323
Tell the guys to look out for a young guy,
about yea tall, brown hair.

713
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:15,584
He's a little jumpy so be discreet.

714
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:18,559
Here, come on.
I think we can cut through here.

715
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:22,360
Come on. Come on.
We can get out the back way. Come on.

716
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:30,501
Kyle.

717
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,230
Kyle.

718
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:35,004
- Kyle, Have you seen my brother?
- Jimmy's here?

719
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:38,604
- I've gotta find him, it's an emergency.
- Ellie, you need to tell me what's going on.

720
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:42,208
- I wish I could.
- Hey, have you seen Kilborn?

721
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:45,152
He ditched me.

722
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:01,796
- ...out of here, baby.
-  Hold on. Find me...

723
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,338
-  Help!

724
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:06,705
-  Which way is out?
- I don't know. Here. Come on, come on.

725
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:13,314
-  Bo, over here,
- Jimmy?

726
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,746
 Ellie.

727
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,314
- Please, Ellie. Don't be afraid.
- Stay away from me, Jake.

728
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:24,485
-  But it wasn't me.
- Bullshit, I saw your hands.

729
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,358
-  There's another one like me.
- Is that your sister?

730
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,625
-  I think so.
- I don't know who it is.

731
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,294
But that's who killed those girls.
It's trying to get to me.

732
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,530
Please, you have to believe me.
I'm telling you the truth.

733
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:42,570
- I don't know what to believe.
- Ellie, I was born with this curse.

734
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:45,409
I know how to control it.

735
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:49,909
I've learned to live with something terrible.
Just like you.

736
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:52,511
We're not that different.

737
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:54,886
- We can do this.
- How do you know that?

738
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:57,391
Because, Ellie.

739
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,485
- I love you.
- No!

740
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,530
- Please.
- Ellie. Come on.

741
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:02,757
Ellie.

742
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,357
I love you.

743
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:07,163
Please.

744
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,240
 Jake!

745
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,042
Where is it?
Where are they?

746
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:42,771
-  Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Shit!

747
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:47,474
- OK, you go that way, I'll go this way.
- OK.

748
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:52,238
- Bo?

749
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:53,509
Bo?

750
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,343
No, don't go in there.
It's not safe.

751
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,478
No, Stop.

752
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:03,423
Randy, Randy, you gotta get everyone
out of there and you gotta radio for help.

753
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:04,982
Why?

754
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:21,437
Are you OK?
Come on, get up.

755
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:24,471
- Ellie!
- Jimmy.

756
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,981
 Come on.
It's a fucking werewolf.

757
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,021
Jimmy!

758
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:41,854
- Have you seen my brother?
- He must be out front.

759
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:44,365
No, he's not, I've looked everywhere.
He's not out there.

760
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,495
- There's nobody left in there except for...

761
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:47,968
...that!

762
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:50,867
Jimmy!

763
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:55,973
Jimmy!

764
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:07,212
Jimmy.

765
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:23,201
Jimmy.

766
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,400
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

767
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:28,238
- OK. We gotta get outta here.
- I know.

768
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:33,581
- Ellie.
- Kyle, what...

769
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:35,640
What the hell's happening?

770
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:40,587
I heard people screaming,
and then I lost Craig, I lost Craig.

771
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:43,682
- Stay away from us.
- What? Why?

772
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:46,023
Show me your hand.

773
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:51,359
- The other hand.
- Ellie.

774
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,698
We don't have time for this.

775
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:58,172
There's an animal on the loose.
It could be anywhere.

776
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:05,138
What? You guys hear something?

777
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:16,113
- Where the fuck did he go?
- I don't know.

778
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:23,761
Jimmy?

779
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:35,876
Come on.

780
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,674
- Come on, come on. Keep going.
- But it's closed.

781
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:40,044
- Shit, we can't get out. We're fucked.
- Where are we going?

782
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:44,018
I don't know, shit.
Where does this go? Come on.

783
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:49,921
- Shit,
- There should be doors. Look for a door.

784
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:55,662
- There's nothing. Look over there.
- OK.

785
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:02,268
No, they're not here.

786
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,566
- Weren't there three?
- What?

787
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,769
There's three microphones.
There's only two...

788
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:11,142
Jimmy!

789
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:17,709
- Showtime. lsn't that what they say?
- Joannie.

790
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:20,653
Just for the record, I didn't ask for this.

791
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:24,386
It was just a hot night
with the guy that every girl in town wanted.

792
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,190
Lucky me,
I should've been more careful though.

793
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:33,031
I got a little rough in bed and wound up
cursed by the mark of the fucking beast.

794
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:38,199
- That Jake, he's a catch.
- Oh, my God.

795
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:42,475
I thought he was the one, you know, but all
I got was a couple of dates, some hot sex,

796
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:46,743
and a 'I'm not ready for a relationship
right now, It's not you, it's me,'

797
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:50,175
Men, They're all beasts.

798
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:54,188
Jake didn't want me.
And if I can't have him...

799
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:57,585
- Well, you know how that line goes.
- Hey, l...

800
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:06,893
The funny thing is,
I never saw you as a threat.

801
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:10,063
I find you rather depressing myself.

802
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:15,166
Why do men always go for
the tortured ones? Poor damaged Ellie.

803
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:17,439
Fuck you.

804
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:20,072
 Bitch!

805
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:25,881
Who's lost it now?

806
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:44,265
OK, Just the two of us, Fair fight, OK?
Just me and you, All right? Come on.

807
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:47,435
- OK,
- I'm right here.

808
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,739
OK, Let's go.

809
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:55,412
Fair fight?
This is Hollywood.

810
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:58,175
And you...

811
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:01,121
You get one taste of blood
and you freak out.

812
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:07,919
Jimmy, Jimmy.

813
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,011
Come on, run.

814
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:51,706
Jake? You bounce back quickly.

815
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:54,600
Hi.

816
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:58,844
- It's you?
- Yeah.

817
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:03,079
- How did this happen, Joannie?
- Well.

818
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:08,886
I guess there's no such thing
as safe sex with a werewolf.

819
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:17,261
Joannie, it doesn't have to be like this
for you, There are ways for you to control it.

820
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,769
Like what? Nibbling on coyotes
in the desert# No thanks.

821
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:23,304
I'm having too much fun
eliminating the competition.

822
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:26,364
Pretty soon I'll have you all to myself.

823
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:30,006
I won't let you kill her, Joannie.

824
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:31,840
Jake!

825
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:33,973
Honey, muffin.

826
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:36,916
I am not gonna kill her, I promise.

827
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:41,183
I'm just gonna rip her to shreds
and let her choke on her own blood.

828
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:42,746
Then...

829
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:44,850
maybe I'll eat her.

830
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:47,725
You have to kill me first.

831
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:55,228
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

832
01:12:55,304 --> 01:13:01,072
Well, I've learned a few things about
this curse along the way, and I know better.

833
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:07,208
But that doesn't mean
I can't make it hurt a little.

834
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:24,196
- I don't see her.
- Sh.

835
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,355
Ellie?

836
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:14,841
Let's see how she deals with these.

837
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:22,354
I'm gonna get you.

838
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:25,825
Where are you, you bitch?

839
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:28,761
Get this off!

840
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:38,197
Where's your brother?

841
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,977
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

842
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:29,717
- Well, maybe she left.

843
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,160
Or maybe not.

844
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,841
- Did she see us?
- I don't think...

845
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:50,743
Run! Jimmy, get out of here.

846
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:56,583
Jimmy!

847
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:14,064
Ellie.

848
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:33,052
Ellie, wake up.

849
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:38,383
Wake up.

850
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,377
You're playing with us,
aren't you, Joannie?

851
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:03,645
Ellie.

852
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:07,148
Well, play this!

853
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:21,725
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

854
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,236
- Move along, Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

855
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,363
Shit!

856
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:35,240
Move it.

857
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,581
- Freeze!.
- Don't shoot.

858
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:41,783
- Where's the animal?
- It's up there somewhere.

859
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:44,917
- What's it supposed to be?
- I don't know, stay alert, guys.

860
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:49,692
- What the hell is it, anyway?
- Oh, it's a werewolf. What?

861
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:53,791
- Did you say werewolf?
- Yeah.

862
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:56,167
she may have changed back
to her human form.

863
01:17:56,238 --> 01:18:00,504
Her name is Joannie.
She's this hyper, skinny publicist.

864
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:05,037
- Any other description?
- Yeah, she's, what?! Like, five foot seven?

865
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:08,173
She's got a bony ass,

866
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:11,811
and fat thighs, and bad skin,

867
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:14,720
Liar!

868
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:18,220
Shoot!

869
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:29,431
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

870
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:46,211
- Man, that's ugly.
- Careful.

871
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:51,188
It's dead. All clear.

872
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:53,886
- That's fucked up.
- Yeah. OK.

873
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,988
- Stand down.
- What is this thing?

874
01:18:57,065 --> 01:19:00,398
I told you, it's a werewolf.
You have to separate the head from the..

875
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:07,932
Repeat, all clear.

876
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:10,978
Call animal control.

877
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,310
- Get them out of here.
Is she dead?

878
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:18,614
Yeah. Her brain's on the floor.
That should do it.

879
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:21,485
- Jake.
- Bo.

880
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:24,354
Hey, I need a paramedic in here.

881
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:33,099
Bo, Bo, Bo.

882
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:35,432
- Yeah.
- Are you OK?

883
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:40,705
- Hey, Jimbo. How'd I do?
- You did good.

884
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,336
- I'm gonna go look for Jake, OK?
- Yeah.

885
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:45,606
Hey, you good?

886
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:49,275
Yeah. He sucker-punched me.
I was about to kick his ass.

887
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:51,444
OK.

888
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:01,161
Did you find him?

889
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:04,223
No.

890
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:13,234
- I'm telling you, we shot the shit out of this.
- Really?

891
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:16,709
You're gonna need a forklift.
This thing is...

892
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:19,144
huge.

893
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:21,944
I think we can handle it.

894
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:26,946
It looked a little bigger before.

895
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:29,380
Oh, shit!

896
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:53,210
- Are you OK?
- Are you all right?

897
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,749
- I think so.
- Yeah.

898
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:02,114
so, it's over, right?

899
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:05,717
And Joannie's dead, so we're OK now..

900
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:11,096
Well, that's subjective, We still have
to go back to our pathetic precurse lives.

901
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:15,535
- I'm personally OK with that.
- Well, you're not in high school.

902
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:23,800
What happened?

903
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,073
Zipper.

904
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:43,556
Are you OK?

905
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,796
I will be.

906
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:51,397
What's wrong?
Are you worried about Jake?

907
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:54,965
- His secret's out. He had to disappear.
- I don't want to talk about it, OK?

908
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:57,477
I know you think he's a good guy, Ellie,
but don't forget, all of this...

909
01:21:57,545 --> 01:22:00,139
...everything we've been through,
is because of him.

910
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:01,807
When it comes down to it,
a monster is still a monster.

911
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:04,545
Jimmy. That's enough.

912
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:09,252
I guess some things never change.

913
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:14,990
- Do you think you can get us some light?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll check the circuit breaker.

914
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:29,267
Zipper?

915
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:44,816
- How are you doing with those lights?
- Yeah, one second.

916
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,385
Shit.

917
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:48,952
Is everything OK down there?

918
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:51,794
Yeah, it's fine, I just...

919
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:46,212
Thank you.

920
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:35,894
Zipper?

921
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:43,935
 It's OK, It's just me.

922
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:48,642
Sorry, I'm still working on the fuses. It's
a little dark in here, I'll be up in a minute.

923
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:51,712
Jake.

924
01:24:51,786 --> 01:24:54,050
How are you, Ellie?

925
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:57,250
Jake, something's wrong, I'm...

926
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,386
- Sh.

927
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:02,362
It'll be OK. Just breathe.
You'll be OK.

928
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:06,093
- What's happening to me?
- It's starting, Ellie.

929
01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:10,231
- It's almost midnight.
- Oh, no.

930
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:11,499
No.

931
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:13,734
- This can't happen, Jake.
- Ellie.

932
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:16,242
Ellie, sh. It's OK.
You're gonna be OK.

933
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:18,506
- I came back for you.
- I have to stop it.

934
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:21,981
- You have to help me stop it.
- Ellie, it's not really that simple.

935
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:24,575
But you have nothing to worry about.
This is how we can be together.

936
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:26,552
You need this, Ellie.

937
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:29,181
You need me.

938
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:34,718
- You said it could be controlled.
- You don't have to worry.

939
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:38,254
I can teach you how to live with this.
And we have years to figure it out.

940
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:41,928
So that's your answer?
We live happily ever after?

941
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:43,868
There's no reason why we can't now,

942
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:51,637
Think about it.
Your parents are dead.

943
01:25:51,713 --> 01:25:53,943
Your brother is miserable,
your life is a mess.

944
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:56,984
Why do you think it is
that you fell for me so hard and so fast?

945
01:25:57,051 --> 01:26:00,885
I gave you a reason to live again, Ellie.
And I can still do that for you.

946
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:03,583
- Jake, I don't want this.
- It's the only way we can be together, Ellie.

947
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:08,322
But I don't want you.
Tell me how to get rid of it. Tell me how!

948
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:12,560
The only way you can break the curse
is for the one who started it all to die.

949
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:15,102
And that’s me.

950
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:19,402
- I'm not ready to die just yet.
- I can't let my brother live like this.

951
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:22,341
You know I have to think of him first.

952
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:28,281
I know, I bet you promised your parents
that you'd give him a good life, didn't you?

953
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:32,149
But you know what, Ellie. You're
really not doing a very good job, are you?

954
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:35,883
- In fact, you're kind of a disaster.
- Get away from me.

955
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:47,298
I don't want you
to worry about your brother, OK?

956
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:50,197
After all,
there's only room for one alpha male.

957
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:53,763
And I really think we should put
the poor kid out of his misery, don't you?

958
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:56,207
Where is that brother of yours, anyway?

959
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:01,014
Now, where could he be?

960
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:03,175
In the basement?

961
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:06,084
These heightened senses
are a kick, huh?

962
01:27:12,594 --> 01:27:14,755
No hard feelings, buddy.

963
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:17,696
I'll make it as quick as possible.

964
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:32,143
- Take it easy with the silver, Ellie.
- You're a monster.

965
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:34,875
Join the club.

966
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:48,558
That's only the beginning, Ellie.

967
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:53,658
I should've known
you couldn't handle this.

968
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:59,070
You're too weak to think you could
survive it. It only makes you stronger.

969
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:01,472
But you're too stupid, too timid.

970
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,350
It comes and goes at first.

971
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:22,054
I probably should've told you that.

972
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,861
- Unfortunately now you both have to die.
- Hey!

973
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:52,320
You'd better run, you little shit.

974
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:57,392
I am going to kill you.

975
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:15,266
Like you said, what doesn't kill you...

976
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:33,109
It's over.

977
01:31:34,121 --> 01:31:38,956
Are you sure?! You were a little off on
that whole 'how to break the curse' thing.

978
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:42,957
Yeah, well, the books
kind of glossed over that part.

979
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:45,021
Uh-huh.

980
01:31:53,241 --> 01:31:55,505

983
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:14,150
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, Jimmy.

984
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:18,358
I found your dog.
He was wandering the streets.

985
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:23,831
- How'd you know where I lived?
- I told her.

986
01:32:27,975 --> 01:32:30,170
-  Are you OK?
-  Yeah, you?

987
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:32,235
I'm good, thanks.

988
01:32:32,313 --> 01:32:33,337
Uh...

989
01:32:33,414 --> 01:32:36,247
- Can I walk you home?
- Sure.

990

- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

991
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:05,775
See you later.

992
01:33:05,846 --> 01:33:08,007
- Nice moves.
- It's the new me.

993
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:12,815
I'm just gonna stay here.
And, uh... clean.

994
