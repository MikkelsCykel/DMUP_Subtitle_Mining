00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,800
I haven't got time
for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!

2
00:00:05,937 --> 00:00:10,465
You want cooperation?
Come up in my office, room 4602.

3
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:23,677
Kids should be at school.

4
00:00:25,023 --> 00:00:27,514
Come on, that's my ball!

5
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:32,095
Give that back.
Where you goir?

6
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:35,630
Damn! Where you goir, man?
That's my ball!

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,271
Follow the blue car.

8
00:00:44,442 --> 00:00:47,502
You want me to blast the music
and go through the lights?

9
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,146
No, drive slowly.

10
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:52,010
Take the hundred bucks,
and shut the fuck up.

11
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,416
<i>I do not want to fight you,</i>
<i>but you leave me no choice.</i>

12
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:34,887
<i>Boy, you just gave me</i>
<i>a great idea!</i>

13
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:41,990
<i>- I mean a big one!</i>
<i>- Welcome back to</i> E! News Daily...

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,226
<i>our 30-minute look at the latest</i>
<i>in entertainment news.</i>

15
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,201
<i>I'm Bianca Ferrar.</i>

16
00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:54,810
It's for you.
A present.

17
00:01:57,182 --> 00:02:00,583
Do you want me to open it?
I'll open it.

18
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:09,285
How do you like it?
Nice, eh?

19
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:11,292
Mr. McGuffin?

20
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:16,300
Can I have a word with you?

21
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:39,809
Here. It's for a contract.
Twenty grand, right?

22
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:42,852
His name is Norman Stansfield,
and he's in room 4602...

23
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:45,955
in the D.E.A. Building,
26 Federal Plaza.

24
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,392
- I'm not taking it.
- Why not?

25
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:52,262
- It's too heavy.
- Well.

26
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:54,193
Will you rent me your gear
for the day?

27
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,924
I never lend out my gear.

28
00:03:57,068 --> 00:03:58,831
But...

29
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,835
you still have your gun.
Use it.

30
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:04,338
Just do me a favor.
Don't shoot out the window.

31
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,942
Why are you so mean to me?

32
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,014
Wildly killing people
you don't give a shit about...

33
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:14,777
but you won't get the bastards
that killed my whole family?

34
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,284
Revenge is not good
once you're done. Believe.

35
00:04:19,157 --> 00:04:21,648
- It's better to forget.
- Forget?

36
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:24,694
After I've seen the outline
of my brother's body on the floor...

37
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:26,763
you expect me to forget?

38
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:28,956
I want to kill
those sons of bitches.

39
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,896
Blow their fucking heads off.

40
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:33,869
Nothing's the same
after you've killed someone.

41
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:38,975
Your life is changed forever.

42
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:44,478
You have to sleep with one eye open
for the rest of your life.

43
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:47,243
I don't give a shit
about sleeping, Leon.

44
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:50,254
I want love...

45
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:52,485
or death.

46
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,083
That's it.

47
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:58,988
I want death.

48
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:02,862
Get off my case, Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.

49
00:05:06,738 --> 00:05:08,797
There's this really great game, Leon.

50
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:12,374
Makes people nicer.
Starts them thinking.

51
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:19,113
The kind of game you love.

52
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:33,292
If I win...

53
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:37,265
you keep me with you...
for life.

54
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:41,029
And if you lose?

55
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:44,539
Go shopping alone, like before.

56
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:49,111
You're gonna lose, Mathilda.

57
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:53,545
There's a round in the chamber.
I heard it.

58
00:05:53,718 --> 00:05:54,980
So what?

59
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:58,122
What's it to you if I end up
with a bullet in the head?

60
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,426
Nothing.

61
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:08,491
I hope you're not lying, Leon.

62
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:13,132
I really hope that deep down inside
there's no love in you.

63
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:18,207
Because if there is...

64
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:21,539
just a little bit of love in there
for me...

65
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:26,974
I think that in a few minutes
you'll regret you never said anything.

66
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:38,895
I love you, Leon.

67
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:57,345
I win.

68
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,265
I took a hit.

69
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:20,401
I need a hand now.

70
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:24,565
I know she's young,
but she learns fast.

71
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:26,801
Kids need to be shaped
into something, right?

72
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:30,141
I know. I taught you that.
But ain't there an age limit?

73
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:32,179
She's 18.

74
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,181
Really?

75
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:39,752
How about something to drink, Tony?

76
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:43,325
Sure. Manolo, glass of milk
for Leon.

77
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:47,795
Nice tattoo.

78
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:55,870
Manolo, make that two.

79
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:18,189
- What's that for?
- Can't afford to catch cold.

80
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:21,264
First you find out
where the chain is.

81
00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:24,697
You can't see it,
but you can feel it. Here.

82
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:27,430
- I'll ring, you start talking.
- What do I say?

83
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,268
Whatever you want.

84
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,241
- Yes?
- Hi.

85
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:36,243
It's Susan.

86
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:39,542
I'm sorry. You must have
the wrong door, little girl.

87
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:42,015
I don't know any Susan.

88
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:46,145
Move back a little.
I can't see anything.

89
00:08:46,324 --> 00:08:48,815
The light's out.

90
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:50,824
It's all dark out here.

91
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:58,635
- Mister, I'm scared.
- Okay.

92
00:09:03,374 --> 00:09:06,002
What the fuck are you doing?

93
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:12,577
Open up.

94
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:17,421
If it leaves your mouth,
I'll pull the trigger, <i>capisce?</i>

95
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,220
Here's okay.
Let it go.

96
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:59,659
I said, "Let it go."

97
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:02,129
Move. Move over.

98
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:05,167
Easy. Easy.

99
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:08,169
Easy. Careful.
You want me...

100
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:12,435
Go ahead. Your turn.

101
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:21,850
Help me.
Please don't beat me.

102
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,487
Sir?

103
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:29,626
Sir, it's not my dope.

104
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:31,659
Sir, look l...

105
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,660
A little left, please.

106
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:38,701
Before... Ple...

107
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:44,270
Now, the security shot.

108
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:52,273
No, the second goes
higher on the chest.

109
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,714
Aim for the heart and lungs.

110
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:56,786
There. Right there.
You see?

111
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:58,819
The first shot takes him
out of order.

112
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,788
- The second finishes him off.
- What are you fucking doing?

113
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,358
Never in the face.

114
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:06,656
If they can't recognize the client,
you don't get paid.

115
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:10,392
You could take out anybody
and said you did the job.

116
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:13,129
- Got it?
- Got it. Never in the face.

117
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:16,704
- Now you can put the tools away.
- What are you fucking doing?

118
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:19,036
What the fuck is going on?
Hey, mister!

119
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:21,677
What are you fuckin...

120
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:27,376
You see, when you use
the silencer a lot...

121
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:29,713
you have to put
a piece of cloth here...

122
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,685
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.

123
00:11:32,857 --> 00:11:35,485
A damp, black cloth is the best.

124
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,761
What you doing?

125
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:44,060
We said no women, no kids.

126
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:47,830
Who do you think this is gonna kill,
junkies and monkeys?

127
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:05,716
Now it's clean.

128
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:09,587
Let's get out of here.

129
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,971
I thought we don't have
the right to drink.

130
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:29,203
I know, but we're making
an exception for your first time.

131
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:36,648
Well, if we're making exceptions
for a job well-done...

132
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:40,552
how about a kiss,
like in the movies?

133
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:46,159
Yes.

134
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:48,992
What you doing?

135
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,532
- I'm going to kiss you.
- I want you to stop, please.

136
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:54,366
Come on. Just a kiss.

137
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:57,803
Stop. Everyone is watching us.

138
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,643
Go sit down.

139
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:11,785
Enjoy.

140
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:20,259
- You don't believe me, do you?
- How's that?

141
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:25,334
- When I say I'm in love with you.
- Mathilda, please drop it.

142
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:29,200
- Just change the subject, okay?
- Okay. Sorry.

143
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:34,543
So, how old were you
when you made your first hit?

144
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:37,213
Nineteen.

145
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:39,212
Beat you.

146
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:48,115
- What you doing?
- Can't afford to catch a cold.

147
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:38,663
- There's no doorbell.
- So knock on the door.

148
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,341
- Yes?
- Hi.

149
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:47,707
I'm looking
for Mr. Reubers apartment...

150
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:51,541
but it's all dark out here
in the hall, and I'm lost.

151
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:53,580
Just a second.

152
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:09,027
You want more? Come on.
Show your fucking face.

153
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:11,895
You think you're going to
get me that easily?

154
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:19,773
When it's tough like this,
you know it's gonna be ugly.

155
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,937
Better make it quick or else
we'll be all day listening to his crap.

156
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:26,810
Asshole! Come on, show me
your fucking face, faggot!

157
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:29,181
- Come on, gum trick.
- Hey.

158
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:32,818
What about the ring trick?
You know that one?

159
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,356
Ring trick? Come on, asshole.
I'm waiting.

160
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:37,357
Show it to me, motherfucker.

161
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,303
That's the ring trick.

162
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:07,247
Mario, go back to the barbershop.
We'll finish later.

163
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:21,666
Leon, what's up?
All done already?

164
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:27,543
Nicer than people, eh?

165
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:29,542
I told you that.

166
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:33,713
You got a problem?

167
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:38,552
Get the chair. Sit down.

168
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:47,729
I was thinking.

169
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:54,028
If something happens
to me someday...

170
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:57,969
Hey, Leon,
nothing's gonna happen to you.

171
00:17:58,142 --> 00:18:01,009
You're indestructible. Bullets
slide off you. You play with 'em.

172
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:05,205
Tony, I thought about my money.

173
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:13,980
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?

174
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:23,330
Her name is Mathilda.

175
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,697
If anything happens to me...

176
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:30,933
I'd like you...

177
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:34,908
to give her...

178
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:39,239
my money.

179
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:44,177
You can count on me, Leon.

180
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:46,687
Thank you, Tony.

181
00:18:50,227 --> 00:18:51,956
I won't be long.

182
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:56,364
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

183
00:18:57,568 --> 00:19:00,435
This one is too big.

184
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:04,570
Yeah, and I only get the leftovers,
is that it?

185
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:08,807
Mathilda, since I met you...

186
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:10,971
everything's been different.

187
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:15,616
So I just need some time alone.

188
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:20,389
You need some time
to grow up a little.

189
00:19:20,557 --> 00:19:23,151
I finished growing up, Leon.

190
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:25,056
I just get older.

191
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:28,629
For me it's the opposite.
I'm old enough.

192
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:32,334
I need time to grow up.

193
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:49,451
Shit.

194
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:06,926
Come on! Hustle!

195
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:10,828
- Good shot.
- Come on.

196
00:21:14,204 --> 00:21:16,729
You're new, aren't you?
Fifth floor, right?

197
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:19,742
- You can't sit here like that.
- Really, why not?

198
00:21:19,877 --> 00:21:22,243
Nothing's free.
Like a parking meter.

199
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:25,313
When you stop, you pay.
It's the law.

200
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:27,517
- Only on T.V.
- What'd you say?

201
00:21:27,718 --> 00:21:31,154
- Forget it. How much is your meter?
- Ten dollars...

202
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:32,879
a month.

203
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:37,021
Got change?

204
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,824
Don't worry about it.
We'll do ten for twelve.

205
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:43,125
I'll pay now for
the rest of the year.

206
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,732
Okay, a year.

207
00:21:45,602 --> 00:21:48,594
Does paying rent here mean
I have to put up with you guys?

208
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,275
So go play somewhere else.

209
00:21:57,815 --> 00:22:00,045
I need to think.

210
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,134
Stand up.
Don't you like your job?

211
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:11,618
Food.

212
00:23:15,225 --> 00:23:19,855
- Where you going?
- Special delivery, room 4602.

213
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,588
Sign here.

214
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:23,198
Come here.

215
00:23:25,936 --> 00:23:29,895
- Have a nice weekend, girls.
- Thanks.

216
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:31,904
I'm gonna go
to the restroom.

217
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:53,987
Special delivery?

218
00:24:54,191 --> 00:24:56,022
Let me guess.

219
00:24:58,295 --> 00:24:59,660
Chinese?

220
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:04,794
Thai, maybe?

221
00:25:07,537 --> 00:25:10,267
I've got it.

222
00:25:10,474 --> 00:25:12,601
Italian food.

223
00:25:29,326 --> 00:25:31,157
What's your name, angel?

224
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:04,351
I want you to put the sack
on the floor.

225
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,231
Good.

226
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:18,897
Now I want you to tell me everything
you know about Italian food.

227
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:21,874
Don't forget the name of the chef
who fixed it for me.

228
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:26,573
Nobody sent me.
I do business for myself.

229
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:30,983
So this is something...

230
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:35,321
personal, is it?

231
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:43,422
What filthy piece of shit...

232
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,431
did I do now?

233
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:48,732
You killed my brother.

234
00:26:52,776 --> 00:26:54,607
I'm sorry.

235
00:27:03,086 --> 00:27:05,611
And you wanna join him?

236
00:27:09,726 --> 00:27:13,287
It's always the same thing.

237
00:27:17,768 --> 00:27:22,569
It's when you start to become
really afraid of death...

238
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:26,197
that you learn
to appreciate life.

239
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:30,675
Do you like life,
sweetheart?

240
00:27:37,654 --> 00:27:38,985
That's good.

241
00:27:44,027 --> 00:27:47,861
Because I take no pleasure...

242
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:52,631
in taking a life...

243
00:27:52,736 --> 00:27:57,605
if it's from a person
who doesn't care about it.

244
00:28:08,151 --> 00:28:10,619
Stan, I've been looking
all over for you.

245
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:13,984
- I checked upstairs...
- What? I'm busy.

246
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:16,921
It's Malky, man.
He's dead.

247
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:22,392
Malky was makir a buy for us
from the Chinaman.

248
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:25,262
<i>But they got nothir</i>
<i>to do with it.</i>

249
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:31,203
<i>They told me this guy came</i>
<i>from the outside. He was a pro.</i>

250
00:28:31,374 --> 00:28:34,366
<i>He was fast.</i>
<i>He fuckircame out of nowhere.</i>

251
00:28:34,544 --> 00:28:37,377
<i>Boom, shoots the Chinaman dead</i>
<i>in two seconds.</i>

252
00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:41,039
Easy, man.
I'm a cop.

253
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:44,016
Then turns around,
says something to Malky like...

254
00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:46,246
No women, no kids.

255
00:28:54,364 --> 00:28:57,094
I think
it was somethir personal.

256
00:28:58,535 --> 00:29:03,734
Death is whimsical today.

257
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:34,496
Blood, do you hear me?

258
00:29:34,671 --> 00:29:39,005
Yeah, I hear you, Stan.
Just chill out, man.

259
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:41,541
Would you take her
up to my office?

260
00:29:43,313 --> 00:29:44,803
All right.

261
00:29:53,256 --> 00:29:55,281
Jesus fucking Christ.

262
00:30:07,671 --> 00:30:09,002
<i>"Leon, my love.</i>

263
00:30:09,205 --> 00:30:11,571
<i>I know where to find the guys</i>
<i>who killed my brother.</i>

264
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:16,304
Their boss is Norman Stansfield.
He's in the D.E.A. Building, room 4602.

265
00:30:16,513 --> 00:30:18,378
<i>I'm gonna do them myself.</i>

266
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:22,245
<i>If something goes wrong,</i>
<i>I left you 20 grand on the table.</i>

267
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:26,287
<i>It's for a contract.</i>
<i>Five grand a head, right?</i>

268
00:30:26,456 --> 00:30:30,256
<i>I know I'll feel better</i>
<i>after I do this.</i>

269
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:32,258
<i>I love you. "</i>

270
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:39,163
Wait. I won't be long.

271
00:30:39,336 --> 00:30:42,499
I can't park in front like this.
It's a federal building!

272
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:50,442
He's gonna do the same exact thing
that I said.

273
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:53,104
A nine "millie."

274
00:30:53,283 --> 00:30:55,308
Bullets.

275
00:30:55,485 --> 00:30:56,816
Another nine "millie."

276
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:02,257
What'd you plan to do
with all these guns?

277
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:05,326
Maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building.

278
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:11,328
Holy shit!

279
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:13,026
What's this? Lunch.

280
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:17,730
Careful, Blood,
might be poisoned.

281
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:19,807
There's no anchovies on this.

282
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,023
Is that what you call "I won't be long"?
I been here for ten minutes.

283
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:43,825
I did my best.

284
00:32:31,581 --> 00:32:32,980
Do you like it?

285
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:36,010
Yes.

286
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:38,653
So say it.

287
00:32:41,224 --> 00:32:42,623
I like it.

288
00:32:57,607 --> 00:32:58,835
Not thirsty?

289
00:33:08,351 --> 00:33:11,320
You know, a girl's first time
is very important.

290
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:14,480
It determines the rest
of her life sexually.

291
00:33:14,657 --> 00:33:17,683
I read that once in one
of my sister's magazines.

292
00:33:18,061 --> 00:33:21,394
My girlfriends told me
they hated their first experience.

293
00:33:22,732 --> 00:33:25,826
That's because
they didn't love the guys.

294
00:33:27,303 --> 00:33:29,271
They just did it to show off.

295
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:33,136
Afterwards, they started liking it,
like cigarettes.

296
00:33:37,347 --> 00:33:39,838
Will I like it the first time?

297
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:45,953
Mathilda, no.

298
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:49,924
Why not?

299
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:52,519
I just can't.

300
00:33:53,663 --> 00:33:56,063
- You love someone else?
- No.

301
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,829
I mean...

302
00:34:02,438 --> 00:34:05,032
There was someone a long time ago.

303
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:08,606
Before I came to the States.

304
00:34:09,212 --> 00:34:12,375
Her father didn't want her
to see me.

305
00:34:13,283 --> 00:34:16,650
She was from
a very respectable family.

306
00:34:17,987 --> 00:34:19,386
Mine was...

307
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,019
you know...

308
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,418
not so respectable.

309
00:34:25,595 --> 00:34:29,361
Her dad went nuts every time
she'd take off to see me.

310
00:34:29,532 --> 00:34:31,762
She still snuck off
to see you, right?

311
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:34,865
Right.

312
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:37,336
See, nothing can stop love, Leon.

313
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:41,809
He killed her.

314
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:44,637
One shot through the head.

315
00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:52,381
They kept him in jail for two days,
and they let him go free.

316
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,483
They said it was an accident.

317
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:00,160
So...

318
00:35:01,965 --> 00:35:03,990
one night I...

319
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:06,334
waited for him.

320
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,068
Five hundred feet with a lens.

321
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:14,738
He also had an accident.

322
00:35:16,145 --> 00:35:19,706
The same night I took a boat
and came here...

323
00:35:19,882 --> 00:35:23,909
to meet up with my father
who was working for Tony.

324
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:26,684
I was 19.

325
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,957
Since then I've never left
the city, and...

326
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:39,931
I've never had another girlfriend.

327
00:35:43,072 --> 00:35:45,597
You see, Mathilda...

328
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:47,743
I wouldn't be a good lover.

329
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:51,804
Okay.

330
00:35:54,984 --> 00:35:57,111
Would you do me one favor?

331
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,719
What?

332
00:35:58,888 --> 00:36:01,186
I'm sick of watching you
sleep on your chair.

333
00:36:01,357 --> 00:36:03,416
We're gonna share the bed.

334
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,690
I don't think it's a good idea.

335
00:36:08,197 --> 00:36:09,994
It's okay.

336
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:12,428
Put your legs up on the bed.

337
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:14,536
Yeah. That's nice.

338
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:21,340
Put your head down.
It's okay. Relax.

339
00:36:43,232 --> 00:36:45,132
Good night, Leon.

340
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:49,800
Good night.

341
00:37:12,462 --> 00:37:14,555
I want a piece of cake first!

342
00:37:19,635 --> 00:37:23,765
Manolo, take the kids
in the kitchen.

343
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:45,959
I have a lot of respect
for your business, Tony.

344
00:37:46,162 --> 00:37:48,653
When you've killed for us
in the past...

345
00:37:48,798 --> 00:37:52,199
we've always been satisfied.

346
00:37:52,368 --> 00:37:57,863
That's exactly why today
is going to be very hard for me.

347
00:37:58,007 --> 00:37:59,838
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

348
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:08,048
My man was killed
right here on your turf.

349
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:11,243
The Chinks tell me
that the hit man...

350
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:15,152
was kind of the Italian type.

351
00:38:15,324 --> 00:38:19,055
So we figured that Tony
might know something.

352
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:21,628
Wait. There's more.

353
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:23,789
You're gonna love this.

354
00:38:26,235 --> 00:38:31,502
A few hours later, a little 12-year-old
girl comes into my office...

355
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:36,305
armed to the teeth, with the firm
intention of sending me to the morgue.

356
00:38:36,512 --> 00:38:40,175
Do you know who came and got her
right there in my building?

357
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:43,644
The very same...

358
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,811
Italian hit man.

359
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,892
I'm dying to meet him.

360
00:38:57,633 --> 00:39:01,899
Relax. Everything's fine.
Sleep well?

361
00:39:02,071 --> 00:39:06,132
I never really sleep.
Got one eye open always.

362
00:39:06,342 --> 00:39:08,242
Yeah, I forgot.

363
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:11,244
I never saw someone with one eye open
snore so much.

364
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:15,749
- I snore?
- Like a baby.

365
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:20,354
I'm gonna get some milk for breakfast.
I won't be long.

366
00:39:20,556 --> 00:39:22,319
Don't forget the code
when you come back.

367
00:39:22,492 --> 00:39:24,926
Two knocks, then one,
and two knocks again. Right?

368
00:39:25,094 --> 00:39:26,425
Right.

369
00:39:46,883 --> 00:39:49,716
Ring these up.
I'm gonna go get some milk.

370
00:40:10,172 --> 00:40:12,037
From here on out,
you don't make a sound.

371
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:16,042
You answer my questions
by nodding yes or shaking your head no.

372
00:40:16,212 --> 00:40:18,680
Is he alone?

373
00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:20,941
Does he expect you?

374
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:24,177
Do you have keys
to the apartment?

375
00:40:24,387 --> 00:40:27,550
Is there a code, a way of knocking,
so he knows it's you?

376
00:41:15,705 --> 00:41:17,002
Alpha team.

377
00:41:17,206 --> 00:41:20,698
<i>- Final position. We're ready to go.</i>
- Be careful.

378
00:42:07,857 --> 00:42:10,917
What up? Move! Fuck.

379
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:18,128
Shit.

380
00:42:19,602 --> 00:42:21,502
Alpha team. Man down.

381
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:24,863
I told you.

382
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:31,506
- Bring me everyone.
- What do you mean, "everyone"?

383
00:42:31,714 --> 00:42:34,080
Everyone!

384
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,801
Take this.

385
00:43:35,745 --> 00:43:38,737
Go take a look.

386
00:43:52,895 --> 00:43:56,160
- Don't move.
- Do you see anything?

387
00:43:58,134 --> 00:44:01,968
It's the guy. He's here.
He's got a gun to my head.

388
00:44:05,174 --> 00:44:06,607
Nobody moves.

389
00:44:06,742 --> 00:44:09,506
- Let the girl go.
- Take it easy, man!

390
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:15,414
Okay, the girl's comir out.
Let the girl go.

391
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:28,825
Grab the axe off the wall.
Over there. Go!

392
00:44:32,268 --> 00:44:34,236
You're coming with us.

393
00:44:46,582 --> 00:44:48,243
Christ, he shot him!

394
00:44:49,785 --> 00:44:52,151
Bastard!

395
00:45:01,363 --> 00:45:02,694
Move!

396
00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:08,794
- Shut

397
00:45:08,827 --> 00:45:08,860
- Shut the fucking water off!
- Got it.

398
00:45:08,971 --> 00:45:10,996
Come!

399
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:15,869
We're in a bad way here.
Send the cats.

400
00:45:26,055 --> 00:45:29,650
I don't know what happened.
I didn't see 'em coming, I swear!

401
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:35,320
I just went shopping and I came back,
and they were everywhere.

402
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:39,224
Stay away from the window.

403
00:46:25,714 --> 00:46:27,045
Come here.

404
00:46:29,618 --> 00:46:30,949
Snipers.

405
00:46:33,088 --> 00:46:36,888
Okay, now, get this fucking asshole
out of there.

406
00:46:54,743 --> 00:46:58,474
- How are we gonna get outta here now?
- Leave it to me. We're checking out.

407
00:47:59,074 --> 00:48:02,601
But it's not big enough for you.
It's barely big enough for me.

408
00:48:02,778 --> 00:48:06,475
- We said no discussion.
- No, I'm not letting...

409
00:48:06,682 --> 00:48:11,551
- I'm not going! I won't go!
- Listen to me.

410
00:48:13,188 --> 00:48:15,383
We have no chance together.
But if I'm alone, I can do it.

411
00:48:15,557 --> 00:48:17,684
Trust me.
I'm in good shape.

412
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,556
I know I've got a lot
of money with Tony.

413
00:48:20,729 --> 00:48:23,289
We'll take it and leave together,
just the two of us.

414
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:24,864
Go.

415
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,197
You're saying that
so I won't worry.

416
00:48:32,241 --> 00:48:35,608
- I don't wanna lose you.
- You're not gonna lose me.

417
00:48:35,744 --> 00:48:37,575
You've given me
a taste for life.

418
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:41,011
I wanna be happy,
sleep in a bed, have roots.

419
00:48:41,183 --> 00:48:43,208
You'll never be alone again.

420
00:48:46,655 --> 00:48:49,749
Please, go now, baby. Go.

421
00:48:51,927 --> 00:48:54,293
Calm down.
Go now. Go.

422
00:48:57,099 --> 00:49:00,967
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna
clean them all. Tony's in an hour.

423
00:49:06,742 --> 00:49:08,869
I love you, Mathilda.

424
00:49:09,044 --> 00:49:11,012
I love you, too, Leon.

425
00:49:46,148 --> 00:49:51,552
Hey, what is going on up there?
Take the guy out, not the building.

426
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,865
We've got one breathing here!

427
00:50:15,844 --> 00:50:18,005
Get a medic on the horn!

428
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:23,881
Clear the hall!
Let him through!

429
00:50:26,622 --> 00:50:30,319
- We've got a wounded man. Make way!
- Down those stairs.

430
00:50:33,562 --> 00:50:35,154
Let's go! Move!

431
00:50:35,364 --> 00:50:37,059
Get that guy off the stairs!

432
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:40,600
- Get your team back out there!
- I got him!

433
00:50:40,736 --> 00:50:43,705
We've got two men comir
down the stairs. Let's hurry!

434
00:51:05,594 --> 00:51:09,325
You okay?
Hey, I need a medic over here!

435
00:51:09,498 --> 00:51:11,398
Move your fuckir asses.

436
00:51:11,567 --> 00:51:13,967
Squad Number One,
what's the status on the apartment?

437
00:51:14,169 --> 00:51:16,399
<i>Can't see shit. Too much smoke.</i>
<i>Give us five minutes.</i>

438
00:51:16,572 --> 00:51:17,903
You got it.

439
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,567
What? Two hundred men can't find
one man and a girl?

440
00:51:21,743 --> 00:51:23,210
Did you find the girl?

441
00:51:32,588 --> 00:51:35,079
How are you doing?
Take your mask off, quick.

442
00:51:38,093 --> 00:51:42,086
Let me see you. That's deep.
Right. And this one here...

443
00:51:42,297 --> 00:51:45,425
You're from the 3rd Precinct?

444
00:51:47,936 --> 00:51:51,064
Let's open up
his sleeve a little bit.

445
00:51:54,443 --> 00:51:57,435
All right, fine. Put it down.
This one.

446
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:16,331
You stay there for two minutes.
I'll be right back.

447
00:52:16,498 --> 00:52:19,899
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.

448
00:52:20,035 --> 00:52:23,903
You're all right.
Sit tight.

449
00:52:29,778 --> 00:52:35,148
Come on, everybody out!
Let's go! Out!

450
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:02,701
Clear the way, men.

451
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:14,151
What are you doing here?
Get out. Come on.

452
00:55:07,736 --> 00:55:09,761
At your service.

453
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,348
This is from...

454
00:55:28,523 --> 00:55:30,684
Mathilda.

455
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:47,604
Shit.

456
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:10,562
Get out of here!

457
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:16,733
Leon asked me
to help you out...

458
00:56:16,905 --> 00:56:20,739
if somethir happened,
and I think somethir happened.

459
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:24,572
He put aside
a little cash for you.

460
00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:27,839
So what I'm suggesting
is that...

461
00:56:27,983 --> 00:56:30,349
seeir as how
you're still so young...

462
00:56:30,552 --> 00:56:33,385
I should hold the money for you
until you're older.

463
00:56:33,555 --> 00:56:35,580
Like a bank, you know, except...

464
00:56:35,757 --> 00:56:39,716
it's better than a bank
'cause banks always get knocked off.

465
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:42,489
No one knocks off old Tony.

466
00:56:42,664 --> 00:56:45,224
But it's your money.
In the meantime...

467
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,234
all you gotta do is come here
every once in awhile...

468
00:56:49,404 --> 00:56:53,067
and I'll dish it out
so you can have a little fun.

469
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:55,640
Here.

470
00:56:55,777 --> 00:57:01,181
- Here's a hundred bucks to start.
- Can't I get a job instead?

471
00:57:01,383 --> 00:57:06,218
Ajob?
What the hell can you do?

472
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:08,117
I can clean.

473
00:57:09,591 --> 00:57:11,957
I ain't got no work
for a 12-year-old kid...

474
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,151
so get it out
of your goddamn head!

475
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:16,957
It's over!
The game's over!

476
00:57:17,098 --> 00:57:19,726
Leors dead!

477
00:57:19,868 --> 00:57:21,733
You hear me?

478
00:57:29,044 --> 00:57:33,674
Come on. You think
I ain't hurtir too?

479
00:57:39,287 --> 00:57:41,585
But he's dead.

480
00:57:41,756 --> 00:57:45,624
You're gonna forget all this craziness
and get your little ass back to school.

481
00:57:46,962 --> 00:57:49,954
Now take this money
and get the hell outta here.

482
00:57:50,131 --> 00:57:52,122
Don't let me see your face
till next month...

483
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:56,464
'cause something tells me
I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

484
00:58:47,822 --> 00:58:51,189
My parents...

485
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,350
died...

486
00:58:53,528 --> 00:58:58,022
in a car accident
four weeks ago.

487
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:00,030
It was terrible.

488
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:06,334
We didn't have the time to get to know
one another when you first came here...

489
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:11,171
but I want you to know I'm not the kind
of woman who'd let down a child...

490
00:59:11,346 --> 00:59:14,577
whatever her situation,
whatever her mistake.

491
00:59:14,749 --> 00:59:19,709
So I'm going to help you and do my best
to welcome you here again.

492
00:59:21,723 --> 00:59:24,283
But on one condition:

493
00:59:24,459 --> 00:59:27,553
You have to stop lying to me,
Mathilda.

494
00:59:27,729 --> 00:59:29,788
I want you to take a chance...

495
00:59:29,964 --> 00:59:32,797
and trust me.

496
00:59:32,934 --> 00:59:35,368
Tell me what happened to you.

497
00:59:38,873 --> 00:59:41,865
My family got shot down
by D.E.A. Officers...

498
00:59:42,043 --> 00:59:45,376
because of a drug problem.

499
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:48,071
I left with the greatest guy on Earth.

500
00:59:48,249 --> 00:59:52,913
He was a hit man, the best in town,
but he died this morning.

501
00:59:53,054 --> 00:59:56,820
If you don't help me,
I'll be dead by tonight.

502
01:00:16,344 --> 01:00:19,905
- You know her?
- I've never seen her.

503
01:00:46,574 --> 01:00:49,134
I think we'll be okay here.

504
01:00:50,134 --> 01:01:00,134
