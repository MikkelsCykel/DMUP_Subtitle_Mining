1
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,900
I truly don't even know
why I'm here doctor.

2
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,900
Well of course it's difficult running
a large household by one self...

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,800
and raising four children is exhausting.
But they're wonderful, wonderful children.

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,100
And my husband...

5
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,800
he's a good man.
A very hard worker.

6
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,900
And huuu...

7
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,500
There were... there is just...
one thing...

8
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,100
Sometimes at night...

9
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,000
and it comes to me.

10
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,100
I imagine myself...

11
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,100
splitting his fat, bold head

12
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
with a great large axe.

13
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,300
lt's just a feeling that comes
over me many... many times a day...

14
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,900
a feeling of humm...

15
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,500
expectation, aah...

16
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,800
hungering.

17
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,500
How do you bear it,
this English weather?

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I cannot sing from the sadness.

19
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,800
I open my mouth...

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,900
You see? Nothing.

21
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,900
Well and with my dear Allister's
gone it's two years now l...

22
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,700
I should thought I'm far,
far too old for this kinds of feelings...

23
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,600
but well, there they are...

24
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,900
Nurse!

25
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,700
I ask you to clean this wound
and put on fresh bandages.

26
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,200
Umm...

27
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,000
Dr. Richardson told me

28
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,600
not to waste supplies.

29
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,000
ls he mad? No...

30
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,000
We must keep the wound
clean to prevent sepsis.

31
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,300
- What 'sis'?
- Sepsis.

32
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
lnfection. lt's caused by germs

33
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,000
entering the wound.

34
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,000
Germs. They're tiny creatures

35
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,500
that invade the body.

36
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,500
Causing pain, fever,

37
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,600
infections.

38
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,700
I don't think I have those.

39
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,900
-You can't see them.

40
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,300
They're invisible.

41
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,800
Please, just fetch me a beaker of
carbolic acid solution and fresh bandage.

42
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,900
Yes, doctor.

43
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,800
Honestly...

44
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,900
ugh... That oaf Richardson had this
way with perform surgery in the sewer

45
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,100
using rusty saws

46
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,500
and it would be Beekman's
pills for everybody.

47
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,100
no matter the ailment...

48
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,100
-Granville.

49
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,700
I'm aware I specifically told the
nurse not to change these bandages.

50
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,500
Soiled bandages are
a heaven for germs.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,200
Germ's theory is poppycock,
Granville.

52
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,800
Now stop speaking of it.
You're frightening the patients.

53
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,100
Poppycock? But Lister has proved it.
All the latest journals...

54
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,400
-Tight, Granville.

55
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,400
No, we won't be needing those.
Thanks very much.

56
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,500
A study there of calm reassurance

57
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,300
and regular bleeding.

58
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,200
These are the keys
to modern medicine.

59
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,800
Will you remain calm, when the leg
putrefies and become gangrenous?

60
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,900
When you amputate...

61
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,700
when the rots spread to
her blood and kills her?

62
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,400
I've had quite enough
of your impotence.

63
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,900
Put back that bandage
and bleed a pint.

64
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,800
Look... look at her, man.
You... you get more blood out of a turnip.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,500
Do as you're told.

66
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,400
And give her Beekman's
pills for insurance.

67
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,700
Beekman's pills are rubbish.

68
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,400
They will do nothing but
bring on stomach cramps.

69
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,700
I won't stand here and watch
you murder your patients

70
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,600
just because you can't be bothered
to read the latest science.

71
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,200
Hahahahaha...

72
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
At long last

73
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,100
we agree, Granville.

74
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,100
Bloody dinosaur.

75
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:48,900
Oh...

76
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,400
Huh...

77
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,900
Good day Mrs. Copeland.
ls Edmund in?

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I wouldn't know, sir.

79
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,400
Guess it all knows my part
is delivery stay at night.

80
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,700
If I didn't love his parents so,
I'd never stay.

81
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,600
I'd pack my bags,

82
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,000
and all this electrical equipment.

83
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,400
lt's a fire hazard,
that's what it is.

84
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,800
I'll try his study.

85
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,300
You. Why have you stopped?

86
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,000
Ow!

87
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,100
Now, that is not what
you're supposed to do.

88
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,100
Hello.

89
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,900
Ahhh...

90
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,800
Oh no.

91
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,500
You haven't been
sacked again, have you?

92
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,700
I've tell you, Edmund. The healing
arts in England are positively lethal.

93
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,300
lt's no coincident that the morgues
are placed adjacent to the hospitals.

94
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:17,900
-Ahh...

95
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,100
Well, this is 1880's.

96
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,100
We're meant to be in the midst
of a medical revolution.

97
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,600
ls it asking too much to use just a
bit of what science has provided.

98
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,100
Rather than... go about
indiscriminately killing people?

99
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,300
Yeah, well it's
little bit like that.

100
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,500
What's all the fuss outside?

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,400
My new generator.

102
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,200
You purchase a generator
just last year.

103
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,200
Obsolete. This is half the size
and delivers double the power.

104
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,200
I never thought I'd
say this. But...

105
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,700
I've lost hope.

106
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,700
Since I was a boy, all I wanted
was to practice medicine.

107
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,900
And to help...

108
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,800
people that actually needed it.

109
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,200
But I'm beginning to fear that
the world is set against me.

110
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,300
Well, what you gonna do?

111
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,700
Private practice, I suppose.

112
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,500
I shall harness myself to
some greedy pill pusher.

113
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,500
Shut my mouth. And pray that
it nets me a steady income.

114
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,100
Or, I could give you ten thousand pounds,
so you could whatever you wish.

115
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,500
uhh... I've told you a
thousand times, Edmund.

116
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,900
You and your family done
quite enough for me already.

117
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, come on, Mortimer.
l'd hardly miss it.

118
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,700
That's not the point.

119
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,900
I simply must make my
own way in the world.

120
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,100
You're so wonderfully middle class.

121
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,900
Haha. .

122
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,800
Thank you.

123
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,500
Oh, by the way.
There seems to be a young man

124
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,100
sleeping on your stairs.

125
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,100
Really?

126
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,300
Huh...

127
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,100
Good Morning.

128
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,600
Mortimer Granville to see Dr.
Dalrymple. I have an appointment.

129
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,700
He's with someone now.

130
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,200
I see. Very well.

131
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,600
I shall wait, then.

132
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,700
Ladies.

133
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
Ladies.

134
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,200
Umm...

135
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,800
Ahh...

136
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,400
It's lovely.

137
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,600
Japanese, I think.

138
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,200
You're a charlatan...

139
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,500
with no more idea

140
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,100
of a woman's wants or needs than

141
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,300
of... of the Moon's atmosphere.
of a woman's wants or needs than

142
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,000
of... of the Moon's atmosphere.

143
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,700
Charlotte, I simply
want you to behave...

144
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,900
You may be unaware, but there
is a social revolution of foods.

145
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,300
Women, will no longer be
denied our rightful place.

146
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,600
Try, as you might. To keep us in
a kitchen and in a drawing room.

147
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,300
We will not rest.

148
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,200
Until we are welcome
in the universities,

149
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,100
in the professions and
in the voting booth.

150
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,200
What are you staring at?

151
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,800
Yes, I can see the wheels turning.
Pity I can't stay for the pronouncement.

152
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,900
Charlotte!

153
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,600
That woman was...

154
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,500
Hysterical.

155
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,400
Yes, quite.

156
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,100
lt's a very difficult case,
that one.

157
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,000
Huh...

158
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,900
I have worked at a number
of hospitals in the past...

159
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,300
year.

160
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,300
Guy's of course, Charing Cross.

161
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,700
The Westminster Hospital,
most recently...

162
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
Excellent.

163
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:03,900
-St Thomas's Excellent.

164
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,200
-St Thomas's

165
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,000
Old St Thomas's

166
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
The popular Stepney sick asylum...

167
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,300
Good. Impressive.

168
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,300
... the diseases of the chest.
Royal Sea Bathing Infirmary...

169
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,600
Fine... fine.

170
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,400
lt's... lt's a variety
of experiences.

171
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
But, tell me doctor...

172
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
what do you know of hysteria?

173
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,300
Huh...

174
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,300
Nothing.

175
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,600
Nothing?

176
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,700
But it's a plague of our time.

177
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,100
I would venture to say, that half
the women in London are affected.

178
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,500
lt stands from an
overactive uterus.

179
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,900
In its most severe forms,
it demands drastic measures.

180
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,300
institutionalization, surgery even.

181
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,600
But in it's milder manifestations:

182
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,000
Nymphomania, frigidity,
melancholia, anxiety,

183
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,400
it's eminently treatable.

184
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,400
Interesting.

185
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,600
Look. l'll come straight
to the point, doctor.

186
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,300
I'm keen for help.

187
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,600
Oh, you saw my waiting room.

188
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,100
Not enough hands to do the work,
so to speak.

189
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,700
Sir, I would be enormously grateful

190
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,000
for any position that allowed me
to offer relieve to my patients

191
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,000
with little chance of killing them.

192
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,600
I've treated thousands of cases,
and I've not lost a single patient.

193
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But I won't lie to you, Granville.

194
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,600
lt's tedious, tiring work.

195
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,500
Are you fit?

196
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,400
I have never shook from hard work in the
pursuit of helping the most needy among us.

197
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,100
Jolly good.

198
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,000
Shall we say,
umm... three pounds a week?

199
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,300
Three pounds?

200
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,000
Four. Plus food and lodging.

201
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,400
I accept.

202
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,900
We're going to do great
things together, Granville.

203
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,300
Good God, what a grip.

204
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,500
So, breakfast at eight,
dinner at six.

205
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,500
Your room is up... ahh...

206
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,600
Emily.

207
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,300
I want you to meet
my new assistant.

208
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,500
Dr. Mortimer Granville.

209
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,900
My daughter, Emily Dalrymple.

210
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,300
Your servant, ma'am.

211
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,300
So pleased to meet you, Dr.
Granville.

212
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,900
Emily is the angel of the house.

213
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,300
Since the day that my wife, Melodia, passed
away, Emily has run things in proper order.

214
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,200
Oh, and she's also quite a
scientist in her own right.

215
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,800
You boast, Father.

216
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,700
Let me guess.

217
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,500
Jollyty?

218
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,300
Botany?

219
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,300
Lepidopterology?

220
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,200
Phrenology.

221
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,600
-Phrenology... hahahaha... Yes.

222
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,800
I can assure you Phrenology is
an accurate science, doctor.

223
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,300
Yes. Besides emulation of the bump

224
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,100
someone's head's a varied
road map to the personality,

225
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,500
if one is properly
trained to read them.

226
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,700
I don't mean to imply...

227
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,300
I think a demonstration is in order

228
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,900
for our young sceptic.

229
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,400
it could be the most convivial.

230
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,900
Please.

231
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,100
What...

232
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,700
Dr. Granville, you had the most
perfectly formed nimbus I've ever felt.

233
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,500
nimbus?

234
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,200
He is a man of great wisdom.

235
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,100
I knew it. I knew it

236
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,200
And your mastoid is...
is very well pronounced.

237
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,300
Doctor, you're quite sympathetic,
aren't you?

238
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,500
Umm... well...

239
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,800
What else... what else?

240
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,400
Oh...

241
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,900
Oh, I'm so sorry.
-What?

242
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,800
lt's just...

243
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,800
Well your... your thrombus is so...
rigid,

244
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,400
so jotting and prominent,
it startled me.

245
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,000
Rigid thrombus?

246
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,500
Sorry. Rigid thrombus?

247
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,400
it augurs fame.

248
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,500
While I have the utmost respect
for your method, Miss Dalrymple

249
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,700
I must complaint that you misread me.
I'm but a simple doctor.

250
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,000
I have no ambition for notoriety.

251
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,700
And I can assure you, your
thrombus is the key to you future.

252
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Whether you seek it or not,
Dr. Granville.

253
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,900
You're destined for fame.

254
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Ahoy!

255
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,800
Ahoy!

256
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Who is this?

257
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,000
Who is this, please?

258
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,700
Mr. Stanton... Huh.

259
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Can you hear me?

260
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,500
Can you hear me now?

261
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,400
Yes.

262
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,000
This is Edmund St. John Smythe.

263
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,800
No, I don't work at the
telephone exchange. You see...

264
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,800
I've installed this telephone
and I wanted to test it

265
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,900
you're the only person they
could connect me to. Haha...

266
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:31,900
How're things going over there? you're the
only person they could connect me to.
Haha...

267
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,200
How're things going over there?

268
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,200
Sound's thrilling. Very well.
Carry on then. Goodbye.

269
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,400
Do you realize? I have been
speaking to a barrister

270
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,100
on the other side of London.

271
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,100
What about it?

272
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,400
Nothing. I don't even know the job.

273
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,200
Nothing to value if you
have nothing to speak about.

274
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,300
Here I am in Grosvenor Square,
and he's miles away

275
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,000
yet, we're able to speak to
each other instantaneously.

276
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,300
Do you think they'll catch on?

277
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,500
I have no idea. But imagine
if everyone had one.

278
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:56,600
Right. I have no idea.
But imagine if everyone had one.

279
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,500
Right.

280
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,000
Well...

281
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,700
I have just been offeedr a position by
London's leading specialist in women's
medicine.

282
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Oh, God, how ghastly for you.

283
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,900
When do you start?

284
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,200
Tomorrow.

285
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,700
Quite looking forward to it,
actually.

286
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,800
Who is she?

287
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,700
What?

288
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hmm?

289
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,200
She's his daughter.

290
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,500
Emily Dalrymple.
I've only met her briefly, but...

291
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,400
But what?

292
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
Oh, Edmund. She is magnificent.

293
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,800
The epitome of
English virtue and...

294
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,000
Womanliness.

295
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,900
I haven't the hope.

296
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,800
Huh. Handsome, young doctor.
What more could a woman ask?

297
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,300
Huh, better income. Social equal.

298
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,400
Overrated.

299
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,100
A few laughs, stiff pricks.
That's all a woman wants.

300
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,700
And you know this because?

301
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,900
Oh, I've read it in a magazine.

302
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,000
Oh, I see.

303
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,800
A toast then. To the end of Dr. Mortimer
Granville, once a brilliant student,

304
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,300
most recently, a visionary
doctor to the poor,

305
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,000
and now, handmade to
anxious middle-aged women.

306
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,800
Edmund St. John Smythe.

307
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,000
Bachelor.

308
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,000
Benefactor. Miserable student.

309
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,100
Sometimes drunkard.
Full time sexual deviant and

310
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,700
supreme waster of time and money,

311
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,500
especially if it has anything to
do with the science of electricity.

312
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,700
- To the telephone.
- To the Queen.

313
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,700
To calling the Queen
on the telephone.

314
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,000
Morning, Mrs. Parsons.

315
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,300
Oh, good morning, Doctor.

316
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,500
This is Dr. Granville.

317
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,200
He'll be assisting me this morning.

318
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,900
Very pleased to meet you,
Mrs. Parsons.

319
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,600
Doctor...

320
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,700
Notice the general pallor.

321
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And how are we this morning,
Ms. Parsons?

322
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,400
Still feeling anxious?

323
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,300
yes, quite anxious, doctor.

324
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,600
I've been having those distracting
thoughts we discussed all week.

325
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,700
Yes.

326
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,800
Throughout history,

327
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,100
the medical establishment
just offered hysterical women

328
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,700
a veritable small respond
order of treatments.

329
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,500
Warm baths, ice baths, water jets,

330
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,000
mesmerisation,

331
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
horseback riding even.

332
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,900
But, I favour

333
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,400
a more direct approach.

334
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,600
Now, I like to begin

335
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,400
with a drop of musk oil...

336
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,100
followed by oil of lilies.

337
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
good dollop.

338
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,200
Are you ready, Mrs. Parsons?

339
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,100
Yes... yes, doctor. Quite ready.

340
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,700
Ooh...

341
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,600
Now, you begin with
the index finger.

342
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,600
Applying gentle pressure.

343
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,200
And slowly...

344
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,100
slowly in a circular motion,

345
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,400
still pressing gently.

346
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,700
lt's a bit like tapping your head and
rubbing your tummy at the same time.

347
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,300
But you certainly
get the hang of it.

348
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,900
Vulva massage was popularized by
Pieter Van Forest in the 16th century.

349
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,500
Who prescribed it most
especially for widows

350
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,700
and women of religious orders.

351
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,700
- No offense, Mrs. Parsons.
- None taken, Doctor.

352
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,000
But today, in a clinical environment
with a trained professional

353
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,200
this is the most direct,
most effective treatment we can offer.

354
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,000
Good steady pressure.
That's the key.

355
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,700
Oh... Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

356
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,400
Of course, reapply oil as needed.

357
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,800
Notice the effect, Doctor?

358
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,700
Shortness of breath.

359
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,600
Blushing of the skin.

360
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,200
Fluttering of the eyelids,

361
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,300
twitching.

362
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,300
Mourn crimson.

363
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,700
Vocalization. All perfectly normal.

364
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,200
Merely, involuntary physiological
reaction to the treatment.

365
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,200
Oh... Oh, come on!

366
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,400
Come on, boy!

367
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,500
Up and over!

368
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,300
Steady on, Mrs. Parsons. Steady on.

369
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,400
Put steady pressure.

370
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,700
That's the key of it all.

371
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,200
Tally-ho!

372
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Tally-ho!

373
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,700
Steady she goes, Mrs. Parsons.

374
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Steady she goes

375
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,500
ls she's by fierce external stimulation,
we're able to elicit the pain pleasure
reaction,

376
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:15,600
there by inducing the hysterical paroxysm,
ls she's by fierce external stimulation,
we're able to elicit the pain pleasure
reaction,

377
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,900
there by inducing the
hysterical paroxysm,

378
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,500
and causing the uterus back
to its normal position.

379
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,900
Amazing.

380
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,100
The female organ is as you know

381
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,200
incapable of experiencing any
pleasurable sensation what so ever

382
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,100
without actual penetration,
of the male organ.

383
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,500
Arghhh...

384
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,100
As you can see, Granville.

385
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,700
A very satisfactory paroxysm.

386
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,100
Well, I think we can judge this treatment a
great success, What do you say, Mrs.
Parsons?

387
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,400
Startling, Dr. Dalrymple.

388
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,400
A powerful demonstration.

389
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,100
And those nagging thoughts?

390
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,200
Gone, Doctor.

391
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,300
Wonderful.

392
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,000
Wonderful.

393
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
So, same time next week.

394
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,200
Umm...

395
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,700
Same time tomorrow, I should say.

396
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,700
Moderation in all things,
Mrs. Parsons.

397
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,600
Moderation in all things.

398
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,300
ls that you, Sarah?

399
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,900
Hello.

400
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,000
Ow... missed me, Charlie!

401
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,200
Sauce, sir?

402
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,000
It's lovely with the fish.

403
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,000
Thank you.

404
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,400
My father was the Anglican
minister of Mortlake.

405
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,200
Unfortunately, he and mother perished
in the last cholera outbreak.

406
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,700
when I was a boy.

407
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,800
After coming to London to volunteer,
they contracted the disease themselves.

408
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,300
Oh, how dreadful.

409
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,600
Oh, terrible.

410
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
No doubt that's where you came
your interest in medicine.

411
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,900
Lord St. John Smythe, knew of my
fate and without thought of the cost,

412
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,400
brought me into his own home and
provided for my welfare and education.

413
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,200
Just what you'd expect
from a man of his standing.

414
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,800
There is no greater charity
than the gift of education.

415
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,400
You read the book of Samuel Smiles?

416
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,400
ls there anyone more sensible,
more supremely British.

417
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,600
Quite.

418
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,100
Music, philosophy,

419
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,100
phrenology,

420
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,100
you're woman of many
talents MissDalrymple.

421
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,900
lt's through generosity,
through compassion,

422
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,900
through simple Christian kindness,

423
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,300
and England gospel is spread
through all those who hunger...

424
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,100
Hello, Father.

425
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,100
I'm so sorry I'm late.

426
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Charlotte...

427
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,100
Emily, hello. Love you.

428
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,200
Good evening, Charlotte.

429
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,700
Molly, hello?

430
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,100
Staying out of trouble, I heard?

431
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,700
Most days, miss. Wine?

432
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,000
Yes, please.

433
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,700
You remember my daughter,
Charlotte Dalrymple...

434
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,900
Daughter? -My new assistant, Dr.
Mortimer Granville.

435
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,000
Oh, hello. Lovely to
meet you properly.

436
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,800
Careful not to prick
yourself, Doctor.

437
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,700
What... oh!

438
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,500
You are aware that the
dinner begin at six.

439
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,900
I'm so sorry.

440
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,300
Lizzie Burke had her eighth
baby today. A little girl.

441
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,100
She was turn the wrong way around,
it took forever to get her out.

442
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,500
It was unbelievable.

443
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,300
Must we speak of
such things at table?

444
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,700
Emily.

445
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,500
Dr. Granville.

446
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,000
How is your fish?

447
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,600
Very fresh and very flaky,
thank you.

448
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,200
And Emily, are the
parsnips to your liking?

449
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,500
Oh... that's enough, Charlotte.

450
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,400
Only trying to make the
conversation sufficiently benign.

451
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,500
Dr. Granville

452
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,700
What say you?

453
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,800
Childbirth. Nasty, uncomfortable
topic best avoided at supper

454
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,000
or a miracle of life
suited for any setting?

455
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,500
I believe that serious medical matters, are
best left to those who're trained in them.

456
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,300
The lane Doctor remind me, but can only
study his scalpel with a quart of gin.

457
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,400
What say you, then?

458
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,900
Charlotte is the mistress at the Eastern
Settlement, House of Heaven for the less
fortunate.

459
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,100
yes, unfortunately, the experience's
left her without a sense of

460
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,700
punctuality or decorum.

461
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,400
Oh, that's probably true.

462
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
I suppose I should've said to Lizzie,
"Hold tight darling,

463
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,300
won't be a minute. Just got to pop home.
Mustn't be late for supper"

464
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,300
I don't know why you
bother coming here at all

465
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,700
if your sole intention
is to be disruptive.

466
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,400
lt isn't my sole intention.

467
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,500
We're out of coal again
and I need ten pounds.

468
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,000
No, no, no, no.

469
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,600
I already told you yesterday, I'm not giving
you any further support in that regard.

470
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,800
I know you did but l
didn't think you mean it.

471
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,300
Well if that what it takes to
bring to your senses, so be it.

472
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,200
I've been dodge you too long.

473
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,300
I've allowed you to roam the
street of London late at night.

474
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,400
Streets that I would be frighten
to go into in broad daylight.

475
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,900
I've taken into my own
home the employer...

476
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,100
inexperience maid at your request.
But no more.

477
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,100
Then father please
give me my dowry.

478
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Haha...

479
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,800
What... To be wasted on prostitutes and
factory workers? I don't think so.

480
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
No, no. Not until you marry.

481
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I would rather offer myself to
a band of ravenous Cossacks.

482
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,100
-The parsnips are delicious.
Are they not?

483
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,700
I do find they work wonderfully
with the fish. Don't you think?

484
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,200
it's not the Middle Ages.
She will able to marry whoever she pleases.

485
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,300
No! lt's not proper.

486
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,900
Now you give up this settlement house
and step up to your responsibility.

487
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,800
And until you do so,
I will not give you another penny.

488
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,200
And I won't come here anymore.

489
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,300
Not the charity or the company.

490
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,000
And you may threaten me with
privation, with bankruptcy,

491
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,400
with a life that knows
only hunger and squalor.

492
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,600
But I shall never veer,
from what I know

493
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,900
to be my own true path.

494
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,100
And don't slam...

495
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,800
Does she slam every door?

496
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,800
Very difficult case, that one.

497
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,400
Good night, Doctor.

498
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
How is it, Miss Dalrymple that...

499
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,700
you are so much the ideal one.

500
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,300
And your sister is so...

501
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,200
so volatile?

502
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,900
well, I'm hardly ideal,
Doctor. And...

503
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,500
Charlotte, she just...

504
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,600
feels everything so strongly.

505
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,600
lf you truly knew her, you would see she's
terribly clever and wonderfully charitable

506
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:35,900
If she's earn such love and admiration
from one so kind and gentle as yourself,

507
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,300
I should never speak
faultily of her.

508
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,700
Good night, Doctor.

509
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,500
Good night, Miss Dalrymple.

510
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Don't, Frank.

511
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,800
How are you, this morning?

512
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,600
We doing fine.
He just misses his mother.

513
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,900
You know what... I was thinking
about you this morning.

514
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,400
Do you know what we
going to start with?

515
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,800
Drawing.

516
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,800
Pardon me.

517
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,800
lt's quite alright, handsome.

518
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,900
Molly, is it?

519
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,200
That's right, sir. Molly, is it?

520
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,800
That's right, sir.

521
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,200
But my friends call
me Molly the Lolly.

522
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
And I think that we can be friends.

523
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,200
Molly the Lolly.
That's an unusual nickname.

524
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,600
Fancy a lick?

525
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,800
No, no. Thank you.

526
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,500
Only six buck for the
gentlemen like yourself.

527
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,200
lt will only take me a minute.

528
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,100
Well, lt's a generous offer, I'm sure.
But I have a very busy day ahead of me.

529
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,100
So, so, so... perhaps
another time, okay?

530
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,400
No, no, no.
What I mean to say is...

531
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,400
Will if you excuse me.

532
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,100
Suit yourself.

533
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,200
You alright, Fannie?

534
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,100
Yeah...

535
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,200
lt's nothing. Yeah...

536
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,000
lt's nothing.

537
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,400
Fannie, what is it? What?

538
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
lt's George.

539
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Again.

540
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,300
I think he's gonna land us
on the street. This time

541
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,400
- Oh, no, no, miss. I can't
- No, take it. Take it.

542
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,500
Straight to the landlord.

543
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,300
No stopping.

544
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,400
l'll see you tonight.

545
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,500
Mrs. Bellamy, is it?

546
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,700
I'm Dr. Granville, Dr.
Dalrymple new associate. Good morning.

547
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,100
Very pleased to meet you, Doctor.

548
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,600
You've been here before? - Yes.

549
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,800
So you are aware of the procedure?

550
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,800
lndeed.

551
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,500
Going well?

552
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,000
Yes, quite. Thank you.

553
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,800
As I said before, I'm leaving you
in very good hands, Mrs. Bellamy.

554
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,000
Oh. . hahaha...

555
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,300
Thank you, doctor.

556
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Good day.

557
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,300
Shall we begin?

558
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,000
Sorry about that.

559
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,700
- You alright, Doctor?
- Yes, quite. Thank you.

560
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,900
Here we go, then.

561
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,200
Please let me know if
anything is uncomfortable.

562
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,300
That's very nice, Doctor.
Thank you.

563
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,600
Very nice, indeed.

564
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,300
Don't you understand?
lt's an emergency.

565
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,600
The situation is desperate.

566
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,200
lt's completely impossible, madam.

567
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
l'll do anything.

568
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,100
Mille grazie.

569
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,600
You are very welcome, Signora.

570
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,000
Next.

571
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,000
You knew they turning
patients away.

572
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,600
Really? I hadn't notice.

573
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,000
I think because of you.

574
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,100
This may be broken.

575
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,300
Something wrong with your hand?

576
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,600
Just a twinge.

577
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,900
Allow me.

578
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,400
You seem to have settled in nicely,
Dr. Granville.

579
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,900
Now, you may have noticed that
I'm not getting any younger.

580
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,700
And with only two daughters,

581
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,000
I have no one to carry
on the practice.

582
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,000
I was wondering whether
you might like to consider

583
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,000
becoming a partner.

584
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,800
Papa, that's a wonderful idea.

585
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,900
l... I'm speechless.

586
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,400
And who knows if things go well,
this practice may end up yours.

587
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,500
Since my dear wife Melodia,
passed away...

588
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,400
God rest her soul.

589
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,600
Emily has diligently and
professionally managed the household.

590
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,200
I've no doubt that one day she
would make a fine Doctor's wife,

591
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,900
with that experience.

592
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,600
Lovely.

593
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,500
I do hope I'm not expected to stay
here until after supper, everyday.

594
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,300
I'm very sorry, Ms. Smalley,
l'll be on schedule tomorrow. I promise.

595
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,400
I do hope so.

596
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,200
Right. Just in here.

597
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,300
We'll sit you down.

598
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,500
Miss Dalrymple, what a surprise?
I'm afraid that your father isn't here.

599
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,200
Good.

600
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,100
Well in that case I must tell you
that we work only to appointment.

601
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,100
Fannie has broken her ankle.
I was hoping to persuade you to treat it?

602
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,500
l'll have the fish n chips.

603
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
That's the rum talking.
lt's all I had to ease the pain.

604
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,600
Normally I don't recommend extreme
drunkenness, but it's probably a very good
choice.

605
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,700
Let have a look at it.

606
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,700
I should tell you, we've no money.

607
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,600
Good night, Mrs. Smalley.

608
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,100
Oh. . Good night.

609
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,400
Let's take her inside. - Thank you.

610
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,900
I'm not wearing any knickers.

611
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Well, I'm sure it's
an honest mistake.

612
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
You want to look?

613
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,700
- What are these for?
- I'll explain later.

614
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
There we go. - Lie back.

615
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,300
Very good.

616
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,500
Now, Fannie... - Yes.

617
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,200
I want you to count to three for me.
Can you do that?

618
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Yes, I think so.

619
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,900
One,

620
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,400
two...

621
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,700
Owww!!

622
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,200
You said three, bloody hell!

623
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,800
She's out, I think.

624
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,200
Forgive me. I wanted
her thoughts elsewhere.

625
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,200
I need some plaster, for her ankle.

626
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,300
I didn't know my father had any proper
medical supplies in here anymore.

627
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,700
Crimean War's supplies I imagine.

628
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,600
Is your hand alright?

629
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,200
A bit stiff actually.

630
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,100
Why are you so opposed
to your father?

631
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,000
My father...

632
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,200
You know he's never been
to the settlement house.

633
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,100
I simply wish he helped people
like Fannie who really need it

634
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,000
lnstead of the trivial
work he does here.

635
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,400
lt's hardly trivial.

636
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,200
That one is a little bit sloppy,
thank you nurse.

637
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
I apologize.

638
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,800
Hysteria is a disabling condition
suffered by half the women in this city.

639
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Keeps you busy, I see.

640
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Does wonders for
disagreeable personalities.

641
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,000
You find me disagreeable?

642
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,000
I've only ever seen you shout
at people and slam doors.

643
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
At least I've got the
courage of my convictions.

644
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,200
And few friends, I would imagine?

645
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,800
Good.

646
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,800
Well, l'need to see you again

647
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,700
in six weeks, Fanny,
to remove the cast.

648
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,000
Thank you, Doctor.

649
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,600
Yes, you've been a great help.

650
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,000
You're both very welcome.

651
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,200
lf you ever get bored,
of nervous housewives

652
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
feel free to pay us a visit.

653
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,400
Hello, Mortimer.

654
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,500
Please, sit down.

655
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,600
Emily...

656
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,800
I've been... Oh, Emily...

657
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,000
I've been thinking...

658
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,300
should things progress
as your father suggested

659
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,400
and I one day l
inherit the practice,

660
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,200
what would your feelings be,
about...

661
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,700
well, an arrangement?

662
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,200
Mortimer...

663
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,800
I should be honoured.

664
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,200
Most especially as it
will make father so happy.

665
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,100
Right... right.

666
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,200
Umm...

667
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,400
Oh, that's settled.

668
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,700
Duty first, as always, Emily.

669
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,200
Life is of little value unless
it be consecrated by duty.

670
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,600
Oh... Quite, yes.

671
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,200
Granville.

672
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
A word?

673
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,000
I must insist that you give Charlotte
no further assistance of any sort.

674
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,800
lt merely prolongs her relationship
with those people and that place.

675
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,600
The woman had a broken ankle.

676
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I admire your dedication, Doctor.

677
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,100
But we can't have day labours
trade things through the office.

678
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,700
This is a very exclusive

679
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,600
and I might add, lucrative practice.
Appearances matter.

680
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,200
I have taken a solemn oath, Sir.

681
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,500
I thought we had an understanding,
you and l...

682
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,600
about your future here.

683
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,600
That's last of it, Miss.

684
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,500
Oh, Jack. Thank you.

685
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,800
Well, then. lt's a two
hundred late today

686
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,600
plus what's on account...

687
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,800
three carry to one...

688
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,300
seven and six, I think.

689
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,200
Yes... yes, that's right.
May I pay you Friday next?

690
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
I'm sorry, miss.
But the gov is very clear.

691
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,600
Cash only, he said.
And, get the balance.

692
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,100
Would you tell your employer,

693
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,000
that my father, Dr. Dalrymple,

694
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,600
has absolutely promised a very large
donation to the settlement house this
coming Friday

695
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,500
and l'll will bring
him the money myself.

696
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,300
l'll make it state, miss.

697
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,100
Nobody appreciates more than
me what you've done here.

698
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,800
My boy, Frank says you're the
strawberries and the cream.

699
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,600
Shush... Friday, then. - Ta!

700
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,700
Mortimer... must you wear
that ghastly hand brace?

701
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,300
I must find some way to attend
to these women properly.

702
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,900
I believe the French have quite a
bit of luck using their tongues.

703
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,100
Please be serious.
We're speaking of my patients.

704
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
They need me.

705
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,200
Perhaps for the first time,
I feel...

706
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,000
truly useful.

707
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,900
Aren't you a rainy day?

708
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,300
Oh, don't worry, something will
come along, simply... - Oww!!

709
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,100
I wish I could share your optimism.

710
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,300
Oh... Excuse me.

711
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,800
Just... just...

712
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,700
Dr. Granville. - Oh...

713
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I think so.

714
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,300
Thank you.

715
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,900
Have you quite finished, Doctor?

716
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,700
Edmund, this is Emily's
sister Charlotte.

717
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,100
Charlotte Dalrymple,

718
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,300
Edmund St. John Smythe.

719
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,200
Oh, Edmund Smythe from the papers.

720
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,700
Overblown... I assure you

721
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,700
I attended that party as a favour to a dear
friend and I can swear I never met that
horse before in my life.

722
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,900
Sounds as if you had
a jolly good time.

723
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,100
What brings you to the west-end,
Miss Dalrymple?

724
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,900
Begging for money,
unsuccessfully till now.

725
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,900
Ah, yes. Miss Dalrymple runs a
settlement house in the east end .

726
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,800
How fascinating.

727
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,700
I must be going.

728
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,200
Oh, that seems as
your hand's no better.

729
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,300
lt must be difficult pleasuring
half the women in the city.

730
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,100
Madam, pleasure has nothing to
do with it. I can assure you

731
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,100
Well I suppose that depends on whether
your rave at the table or on it.

732
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,100
Goodbye.

733
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,500
You know how much we admire
your spirit, Charlotte.

734
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,900
And we're lifelong
friends of your father.

735
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
But these element you work
with are nothing more than

736
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,400
the draught horses of society.
I don't see how charity will help...

737
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,300
lt's not charity, perhaps a loan.

738
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,000
A loan? How much?

739
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,000
Two hundred pounds.

740
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,800
Generally, a loan has
some security, dear.

741
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,700
They were my mother's.
They should cover the balance and more.

742
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,400
We will give you two hundred pounds at
eight percent interest. - Thank you.

743
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,300
Now I want you to be sure you understand
this is strictly business, Charlotte. -
Yes, yes, yes, yes

744
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,900
We won't hesitate to collect...

745
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,200
I understand.

746
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,500
Thank you.

747
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,000
Mr. Huddleston.

748
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,300
Thank you. Thank you for your
time and your generous...

749
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,600
Mrs. Huddleston, thank you.

750
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,600
lt means a great deal
to so many people.

751
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,100
Thank you, thank you.

752
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,100
Scandalous...

753
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,700
Hello?

754
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,800
Dr. Granville...

755
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,000
Trolling for patients?

756
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,700
Afraid you finding
cases of hysteria here.

757
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,000
Women are all too busy
trying to find enough to eat.

758
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,000
Miss Dalrymple.
Always speaking out of turn.

759
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,000
No. I come to enquire about
Miss Fanny broken ankle.

760
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,500
A house call?

761
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,900
Surely, there's no harm
following up with the patient?

762
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,300
None at all.

763
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,500
No pain?

764
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,700
No. Nothing.

765
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,900
I was going to take her
to see you on Friday.

766
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,600
There's no bother.
I was in the neighbourhood.

767
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,400
I was... I was near
the neighbourhood.

768
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,300
- How's that feel?
- Fine, thank you Doctor.

769
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,800
Would you like a
cup of tea, Doctor?

770
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,700
Oh, no, thank you.

771
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,600
Dr. Granville.
lt's the least we can offer.

772
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,600
Yes. Alright then.
Cup of tea would be lovely.

773
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Take it easy on that for a few days.
Yes, Doctor.

774
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,700
Very good. Now wait for me in a moment.
You can wait just through there.

775
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,900
Hello...

776
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,600
Hang on.

777
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,100
Just getting to the good bit.

778
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,800
Thank you. I wouldn't be able to sleep
without knowing how that turn out.

779
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,600
Milk, Doctor? - Please.

780
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,100
We use this room
mostly as a nursery.

781
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,400
I do fit in a little bit
of teaching now and then.

782
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,100
Promoting some aggressive
political agenda, no doubt.

783
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,400
Sums and letters mostly.

784
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,700
Occasionally we sneak in
something slightly progressive.

785
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,000
Oh... you might like this.
Actually look. For example...

786
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,800
this is where the
children wash their hand.

787
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
We use soap

788
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,200
and boiled water. We do our best to
keep the settlement sanitary, but...

789
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,300
you can't imagine the
filth and the germs.

790
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,600
You know about germs?

791
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,800
I do read, Doctor.

792
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,100
I spend years trying to convinced the
medical establishment that the hand washing
prevent disease

793
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,500
and unsuccessfully.

794
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,200
and then here you are
teaching it to the children.

795
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,500
And with great success.

796
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:40,300
I know. With the parents is another story.
But, eventually the children will teach
them themselves.

797
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,700
Bravo.

798
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:47,100
For the women, we're trying to provide
services that will offer the most direct
result.

799
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,200
Good hot meal, safe place for their
children and communal laundry.

800
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,500
I think that if we can ease their work
load a bit We could get on to the important

801
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,900
work, of changing their minds.

802
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,500
You Madam, are a socialist.

803
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,700
A socialist?

804
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,900
What if I am?

805
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,000
Socialism, it isn't hard.

806
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,100
lt's nothing more than a
group pulling together.

807
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:15,100
lf women pull together,
if they weren't so frightened,

808
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,100
There's no telling what
we could accomplish.

809
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,400
ln this revolution that you're planning,
will you achieved it all from here?

810
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,300
Drop a stone in a pond,
then it will main rippled.

811
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,900
lt's a bit like pond. lt is true.
I know this. - Yes.

812
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,700
The building adjacent,

813
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,800
and the one behind, are both for
sale for two thousand pounds.

814
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,500
Bought them together, and we're
not just a classroom and a kitchen

815
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,500
we're centre for the
neighbourhood with a garden,

816
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,400
a proper school,
maybe even a medical clinic.

817
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,100
And two thousand pounds,
is aiming quite high, don't you think?

818
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,500
No, I don't think so.

819
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,300
I know, by the time I'm gone,
women will have the vote

820
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,500
they have equal education and
rights over their own bodies.

821
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,700
and l'd like to play some small
part in making that happen.

822
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,700
Absolutely. And then,
you should teach them how to fly.

823
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,700
I would.

824
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,100
You just wait and see, Doctor.

825
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,900
l'd like to see your face.

826
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,900
Your passion, your devotion
to this work is admirable.

827
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,500
Honestly,

828
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,100
I get much more out
of it than they do.

829
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,900
They only get food and laundry
and I'm giving a useful life.

830
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,500
And I set my own hours.

831
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,900
You know...

832
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,500
I could really use the help of an
able Doctor on a more regular basis.

833
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,800
bread and apple for the least of it

834
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,200
All the children suffer
from malnutrition, scurvy,

835
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,200
even cholera and typhus.

836
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,900
All preventable as you know

837
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,100
with the knowledge and resources.

838
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,600
I'm afraid my patients
keep me very busy.

839
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I only mean... I only
mean a weekend a month.

840
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,100
I don't believe l
would have the time.

841
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,200
Or even a few hours on a Sunday.
Anything would help.

842
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,200
I'm sorry.

843
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,000
Please. Please. - Miss Dalrymple.

844
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,000
I'm afraid I can't help.

845
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,500
You can't...

846
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,700
or you won't?

847
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,400
lt's a bit more complex than that.

848
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,000
I know, I know. lt's...

849
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,600
lt's my father.
He wouldn't allow it, would he?

850
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,700
ls that why you came here?

851
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,600
To keep me from bringing Fannie
back to his posh little practice?

852
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,900
Thank you for the tea.

853
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,700
Run along Doctor. Back to your...

854
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,100
silly comfortable life.

855
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,900
Mrs. Castellari, Doctor.

856
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,900
Send her in, Nurse.
Mrs. Castellari.

857
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,500
Mrs. Castellari, how are you?

858
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,000
Sad, Doctore.

859
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,800
Very sad today.

860
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,000
Good, good. Lie back, please.

861
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,700
Aii!!!

862
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,900
Your hand is so cold, Doctore.

863
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,600
I'm so sorry, Mrs.
Castellari. I forgot.

864
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,000
Yes.

865
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,800
ls that better?

866
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,700
I think that's enough
for today, Doctore.

867
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,600
Feeling better, than?

868
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,000
Mrs. Castellari!

869
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,900
Mrs. Castellari!

870
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,500
I assure you Mrs. Castellari,
this has never happened to me before.

871
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,300
You have discredited
my entire practice.

872
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,400
I'm very sorry.

873
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,800
Sorry will hardly suffice.

874
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,300
Your disability is clearly far more
serious than you let me to believe.

875
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,300
Ms. Castellari tells me you
fail to complete the treatment.

876
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,000
And now,

877
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,000
I discovered that Mrs.
Parsons has stopped coming altogether.

878
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,700
lf you could only see or wait while giving
me one more chance, I can assure you...

879
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:31,800
No.

880
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,000
I thought you were
someone I could trust,

881
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,200
with my business, my family,

882
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,300
my reputation.

883
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,300
But, clearly I was mistaken.

884
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,900
You're dismissed.

885
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,100
Doctor. - Dismissed!

886
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,600
I'm terribly sorry.

887
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,400
I'm finished, Edmund.

888
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,500
Completely buggered.

889
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,500
I had a perfect life within
reach and, I lost it.

890
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,300
All due to hand cramps.

891
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,700
God!

892
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,100
Someone's telephoned.

893
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,100
Ahoy!

894
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I didn't know you had a telephone.

895
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,800
I'm very, very flattered. Yeah.

896
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,100
Oh, yes, indeed.

897
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,300
My God!

898
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,300
Now I'm inventing a cleaning tool.

899
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,000
Yeah, very good.

900
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,300
Yes.

901
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,400
Yeah, do that...

902
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,700
Got to rush, actually now. Goodbye.

903
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,700
Oh... Don't stop.

904
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,300
I think you're enjoying
yourself too much.

905
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,600
lt makes your hand feel all...
all warm and tingling.

906
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,100
I feel it right down to the bone.

907
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,100
Oh, really?

908
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,900
Turn it back on.

909
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,000
Please...

910
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
Well, that's what I call
good steady pressure.

911
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,800
Does it go any higher?

912
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:21,900
Go on.

913
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,500
That's it. That's the spot.

914
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,100
My feathers!

915
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,900
This is the spot, indeed.

916
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,900
Bugger...

917
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,600
You smell burning?

918
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:55,300
But you said yourself that you could
feel the vibration deep inside...

919
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,900
I know what I said.

920
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,700
But this is crude and
rough and inexact

921
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,900
and nothing at all like the
motion and pressure that I use.

922
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,800
Didn't seem to have much this time.

923
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,400
I grant you.

924
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,000
lf this works,

925
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:11,300
it could put you back in good
standing with Dr. Dalrymple and Emily.

926
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,500
Edmund, let me be perfectly
clear about this.

927
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,800
We are not going to take

928
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,600
a dangerous explosive and
untried electrical device

929
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,800
and press it against the
ladies most gentle areas.

930
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:26,900
That's it, then.

931
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,600
I believe I shall regret this
to the very end of my days.

932
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,800
Now, who should we try it on?

933
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,900
Ordinarily for five pounds,
I wouldn't ask questions.

934
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,700
That's with the men.
This is a different kettle of fish.

935
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,100
I don't believe it will involve
any pain. But if it does,

936
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,300
we will stop immediately.

937
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,500
Think of it this way, Molly.

938
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,200
for one brief moment,
you could be a pioneer of technology.

939
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,600
A voyage of the British Empire,

940
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,900
and quite possibly, the vanguard
of modern medical science.

941
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,500
And we pay up front.

942
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,300
Why not?

943
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,600
Do your worst.

944
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,100
Ooh... - Are you hurt?

945
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,000
No.

946
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,200
No. lt just scared me.
That's all. No.

947
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,800
No. lt just scared me. That's all.

948
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,200
I've never felt one
like that before.

949
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,700
Shall I stop?

950
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,200
No, no. Try again.
l'll be ready this time.

951
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,800
Oh, right there.

952
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,200
Yes, like that.

953
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,500
How do you feel, Molly?

954
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,500
Bloody marvellous,
what do you think?

955
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,500
Would you say you had a paroxysm?

956
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,900
l'd say three from conunting.

957
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,800
lt got a little
muddled in the middle.

958
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,500
lt's astonishing.

959
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,300
What you call that little thing?

960
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,400
Well, I was calling
it a feather duster.

961
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,200
Well, let's think
of something quick.

962
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,200
So the girls know what to ask for.

963
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,700
Whore's feathers?

964
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,100
I give you my word
as a gentleman, sir.

965
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,300
Three paroxysms in five minutes.

966
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,100
No harm came to the girl?

967
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,800
She was completely
satisfied with the result.

968
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,700
Yes. Well, I can hardly
take the word of a trollop.

969
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,700
That's why we must try it here.

970
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,500
Medical science demands a
thorough investigation.

971
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,900
What better place to start than with these
women whom we know suffer so from hysteria?

972
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,200
Yes. Well, in my opinion,
change is rarely beneficial.

973
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,500
I believe we're on the verge of
something revolutionary, sir.

974
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,900
lf we achieve half as
much of your patients,

975
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,800
all credit goes to you.

976
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,500
Not just money, fame.

977
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,900
Three paroxysms in
five minutes, you say?

978
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,100
Very well . One test case.

979
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,900
But if she comes to harm,
on your head be it.

980
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,100
The rubby-nubby.

981
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,900
The vibratorium.

982
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,600
Jigly-wigly?

983
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,800
paroxysmator.

984
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,600
Oh, the sorcerer's apprentice.

985
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,800
- Excitetator?
- Mr. Wobleck.

986
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,700
What about, the squealer?

987
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,500
You gonna need a bigger
appointment book.

988
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,200
Electric massage?

989
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:30,800
I don't know.

990
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,700
I have full confidence that the
machine will equal if not better,

991
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,400
any treatment you've had before.

992
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,700
And, since you're so
unsatisfied last time,

993
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,100
I'm prepared to offer
you this, gratis.

994
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,700
l'll trust you, Doctore.

995
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,300
This is Mr. Edmund St...

996
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,100
That is my electrical assistant.

997
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,100
He'll be attending as well,
if that's alright?

998
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,200
lt's a little surprising at first, Mrs.
Castellari. But don't be alarmed,

999
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,100
you'll soon get used to it.

1000
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,400
Everything all right, Mrs.
Castellari?

1001
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,500
Bravo!

1002
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,100
Well done.

1003
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,900
So, don't forget to chain the gate,

1004
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,800
And, oh... I left the
candle lit in the kitchen.

1005
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,600
Go, and have a lovely evening.

1006
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,500
You know, I think I will.

1007
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:09,900
Bye.

1008
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,700
Dr. Mortimer Granville.

1009
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,600
Oh, I'm sorry. We're closing.

1010
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,800
Get her out of there.

1011
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,300
Two hundred pounds plus interest,
or we lock the gate.

1012
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,700
But I don't have it.

1013
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,200
Right. I'm locking the gate.

1014
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:46,900
Get of me!

1015
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:05,600
No doubt, you're the luckiest man
in all of London. - Miss Dalrymple.

1016
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,200
Miss Charlotte Dalrymple.

1017
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,400
Will you excuse me, ladies?

1018
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,200
Miss Dalrymple.

1019
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,400
Dr. Granville, good evening.

1020
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,100
Congratulations. I'm sure you'll
make my sister very happy.

1021
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,200
Something wrong?

1022
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,400
No, no.

1023
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I just never seen you so...

1024
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,000
Formally attired?

1025
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,300
I was going to say...

1026
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,800
clean.

1027
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,600
Dr. Granville, I can assure you

1028
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,600
that women enjoy physical
pleasure just as much as men,

1029
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,300
even if it can be harsh to come by. -
Physical pleasure has nothing to do with it.

1030
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:02,100
lt is strictly a medical treatment
that stimulates the nervous system.

1031
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:05,300
lndeed it does, doesn't it.
Bargain it to guinea.

1032
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,800
But my point is,

1033
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,300
according to your diagnosis,
hysteria seems to cover everything,

1034
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,400
from insomnia to toothache.

1035
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,400
lt's not my... - lt's nothing
more than a catch-all

1036
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,400
for dissatisfied women.

1037
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,800
women, forced to spend their
lives on domestic chores

1038
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,600
and their prudish and selfish
husbands who are unwilling

1039
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,600
or unable to make love to them
properly, or often enough.

1040
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,300
You seem to have strong opinions on
husbands for a woman who doesn't have one.

1041
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,400
Look, if you don't believe me,

1042
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,300
ask your patients.

1043
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,800
Faintly ironic, don't you think.
Use my engagement party

1044
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,700
as an opportunity to deliver
your opinion matters? - Yes, yes.

1045
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:42,300
and I apologize for that, but you must
admit, you men really did get the best side
to the bargain.

1046
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,200
Bargain?

1047
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,600
For I said, lt's mindless
housework and dating some halfwit

1048
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,500
you can make some
halfwit very happy.

1049
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,900
lt simply not enough for me,
or for most women.

1050
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,200
Would it be enough for you?

1051
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,100
I'm not most women.
Wouldn't you be lonely?

1052
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,200
I will take a partner. An equal.

1053
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:03,000
But, not for me a life of
darning socks, doing chores

1054
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,700
until my mental faculties
become Sunday pudding.

1055
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,100
Does someone say Sunday pudding?

1056
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,700
Lord and Lady St.
John Smythe may I present

1057
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,800
Miss Dalrymple.

1058
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,800
Miss Dalrymple, my guardians.
Lord and Lady St. John Smythe.

1059
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:13,800
Charlotte "Sunday pudding" Dalrymple. Miss
Dalrymple, my guardians. Lord and Lady St.
John Smythe.

1060
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,600
Charlotte
"Sunday pudding" Dalrymple.

1061
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,800
So please to meet you, my dear.

1062
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,200
I love a good Sunday pudding.

1063
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,200
Cannot be happier for you,
Mortimer.

1064
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,200
You make us proud,
each and every day.

1065
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:23,900
Thank you.

1066
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,300
Lovely earrings.

1067
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,400
Oh, thank you.
They were my mother's.

1068
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,500
Will your mother be
joining us this evening?

1069
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,200
No, my mother is in
fact dead, my Lord.

1070
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,800
I trust we didn't waste
an invitation on her.

1071
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,500
What about your father?

1072
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,700
Will he be here or
is he dead as well?

1073
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,600
No. My father is quite well.
Thank you.

1074
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:43,500
I've not seen him but I'm
sure he'll be here soon.

1075
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,100
Oh, hurry up. Damn you.

1076
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,200
Give a move on!

1077
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,600
They only keep the love of
your life waiting, my dear.

1078
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,000
A toast to the happy couple.

1079
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:08,700
You'll soon find that the
key to a happy marriage

1080
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,400
is the ability to enjoy
a good argument. - Yes.

1081
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,500
Do remember to let him win
once in a while, my dear.

1082
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,500
Oh... Oh... no, no.

1083
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,100
There's a misunderstanding.

1084
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,200
l'd rather marry Edmund
than Dr. Granville.

1085
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,500
Marry Edmund?

1086
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,400
Sure, she's a live one.

1087
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,200
Who is this man?

1088
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,200
That's my father.

1089
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,500
I thought he was dead.

1090
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,700
May I present, Dr.
Robert Dalrymple.

1091
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,500
My Lord.

1092
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,900
And this is my fiancée,
Emily Dalrymple.

1093
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,000
Fiancée? But I thought...

1094
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,000
Never mind, dear.

1095
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,200
How very nice to meet you,
Doctor. - My Lady

1096
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,800
Miss Dalrymple.

1097
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,200
I do apologize for being so late.

1098
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,000
That's quite alright.

1099
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,100
Your hair is the most
adventurous, Emily.

1100
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,000
Oh, do you think so?

1101
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,100
It took it so long
to get it up there.

1102
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,500
Shall we do the once around.

1103
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,200
Well, yes. - Excuse us.

1104
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,200
Port, Doctor?

1105
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:15,900
Delightful.

1106
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,100
Tell me how you met
our young Mortimer?

1107
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,700
Lovely party.

1108
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,800
Yes... yes, it is.

1109
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,000
What are your interests?

1110
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,500
Music, I enjoy reading.

1111
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,600
Phrenology.

1112
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,000
Mortimer stay modest.

1113
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,300
Tell us how widen your
accomplished, you are.

1114
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:49,500
Phrenology is a treasure map to the
personality if one is properly trained.

1115
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:52,700
We are licensing this machine
to doctors all over London.

1116
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,200
For a very generous royalty,
of course.

1117
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,900
I despise business.

1118
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,100
So do l.

1119
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,400
Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Huddleston.
Come, let me introduce you.

1120
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,300
Good evening, Mr. Huddleston.

1121
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,700
Mrs. Huddleston,
do you know Dr. Granville?

1122
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:13,900
Not personally.

1123
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,800
Very nice to meet you. - Charmed.

1124
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,100
Looks though You going to be
getting these earrings after all.

1125
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,500
You'll have to excuse us.

1126
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,700
I'm sorry.

1127
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:23,900
That was a little odd.

1128
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:28,000
These earrings are the security against the
loan for the settlement house for this due
tomorrow.

1129
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,900
So this is my last night with them.

1130
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,000
They were your mother's.

1131
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:34,900
Yes, they were.

1132
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,400
You do what you must.

1133
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,300
I'm sure she would have approved.

1134
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:13,700
Bugger.

1135
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,200
Throughout history,

1136
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,400
great English families have
gathered in halls such as this,

1137
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,300
to celebrate the
impending nuptial...

1138
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,700
Lord, save us.

1139
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,700
Tell me. What happened?

1140
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,400
They came for the money,
I told them that I didn't have it...

1141
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,000
Mr. Huddleston, what's the meaning of this?
you gave us until Monday.

1142
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,300
I no longer hold the note, Charlotte.
Your father does.

1143
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,400
Father?

1144
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,000
Charlotte, calm down.

1145
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,800
I'm simply doing
what's best for you.

1146
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
What are you doing?

1147
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,800
I purchased the note from Mr.
Huddleston,

1148
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,000
and I'm closing down the settlement house.
You no longer have any debt...

1149
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,900
These are the actions of a villain.

1150
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,200
Charlotte. - Of a villain

1151
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,200
This is your sister's
engagement party.

1152
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,400
Party? She's bruised and bleeding.
You want me to consider a party?

1153
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,800
Make way, please.

1154
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:09,900
Leave her. - This
is a private party.

1155
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,500
You're not manhandling her.

1156
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,500
Let me handle this.

1157
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,600
We've got this under control.

1158
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,700
I'm a doctor. I believe this
woman needs medical attention.

1159
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,000
I don't know that, sir,
but I do know she's not staying.

1160
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,100
I haven't done anything wrong.

1161
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,400
Please stop. She's hurt.

1162
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,600
Just please, Charlotte.

1163
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,100
lf we can discuss this
like civilized men.

1164
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,400
Let me by.

1165
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,200
I said let me by.

1166
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,300
Damn. Did I miss something?

1167
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,700
I would never have imagine
it will come to this.

1168
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,000
But we'll have to help her.

1169
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,000
There's nothing 'but', Emily.

1170
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,200
I tried indulging her,
I tried a firm hand

1171
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,200
I've met my worst end.

1172
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,000
Mortimer.

1173
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,400
Please, she's my sister.

1174
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:28,900
What would you have me do?

1175
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:31,200
You must testify on her behalf.

1176
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,400
- And say what?
- The truth.

1177
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,900
That she's hysterical.

1178
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,500
Sir, they will send
her to a sanatorium.

1179
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:41,700
That's the only thing that
will keep her out of prison.

1180
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:00,300
Order! Order!

1181
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,500
This court will come to order.

1182
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,400
The facts are these, Your Honour.

1183
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:45,100
One fortnight ago, the defendant,
Charlotte Dalrymple,

1184
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,900
in full view of witnesses,

1185
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,900
assaulted a police Constable
caring out his duty.

1186
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,700
If this were a first offense,

1187
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:53,700
then a short prison sentence might suffice,
but... If this were a first offense,

1188
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:56,900
then a short prison sentence
might suffice, but...

1189
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,100
this isn't the first offence,
is it Miss Dalrymple?

1190
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,400
You're arrested last April

1191
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,200
on public nuisance

1192
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,600
and resisting arrest.

1193
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,400
Your honour, I was handing out
suffragette leaflets in Trafalgar Square

1194
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,100
when two officers arrested me.

1195
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,100
The officers sworn statements read:

1196
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:18,000
"Miss Dalrymple was asked
to leave the square,

1197
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:19,700
where upon she started

1198
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:22,400
to shout and jump about".

1199
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,600
"When finally we did try
to place her in handcuffs,

1200
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,100
she resisted

1201
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:29,900
most violently".

1202
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,300
No. That is not true.

1203
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,800
You will speak only when questionrd,
Miss Dalrymple.

1204
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,000
Well, how am I to defend myself against
his accusation if you won't let me speak?

1205
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:38,700
ls there more?

1206
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:40,200
I'm afraid there is, Your Honour.

1207
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,200
October 1879, solicitation.

1208
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,800
No, that was not me.

1209
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,900
My friend, Molly...

1210
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,000
she is a prostitute.
She was a prostitute.

1211
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,600
She has since found
gainful employment,

1212
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,700
as a maid, in my father's house.

1213
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,800
Anything else, Mr. Squyers?

1214
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:01,700
No, Your honour.

1215
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,600
No? Nothing else?
What's of the crime

1216
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,500
of charity and compassion?

1217
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,500
Very admirable I'm sure.

1218
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,200
Seems that the help included prostitution,
resisting arrest and

1219
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,200
assaulting police officers.

1220
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,100
One could only imagine that the cost to
England, should be sending university
education to all her women .

1221
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,600
Yes, it's very easy, isn't it?

1222
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,600
to make fun of women's lives.

1223
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,400
I would like to see you,

1224
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,000
walk for one mile in our shoes,

1225
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:32,300
I imagine that your
mirth would turn, first

1226
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,600
to sympathy and then to despair.

1227
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,900
Be careful, Miss Dalrymple.
Your symptoms are showing.

1228
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,000
Until England fully recognizes

1229
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,500
the worth and
contributions of women,

1230
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,300
will she'll be anything other
than a second class country

1231
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,600
despite all her wealth.

1232
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,000
That's enough, Miss Dalrymple.

1233
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,100
Your Honour, Charlotte
Dalrymple clearly suffers from

1234
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:03,200
erratic, aggressive
and violent emotions.

1235
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:06,500
That are best described,
as incurable hysteria.

1236
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,700
To back truce my opinion,
I would like to call

1237
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,600
an expert witness, Your Honour.

1238
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,400
Proceed, Mr. Squyers.

1239
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,200
I would like to call Dr.
Mortimer Granville,

1240
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,700
lf it pleases the court.

1241
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,700
Mortimer Granville, please.

1242
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,600
Dr. Mortimer Granville.

1243
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,700
Your Honour.

1244
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:45,400
The evidence you shall
give shall be the truth,

1245
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,200
the whole truth nothing but
the truth so help you God!

1246
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,000
lt will.

1247
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,800
State your name.

1248
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,200
Mortimer Granville.

1249
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:59,200
Now, I'm sure we all, are well
aware of your celebrity, Doctor.

1250
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:03,000
But, if you wouldn't mind just telling us
a little of your professional experience.

1251
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,800
I'm a medical doctor whose practice consists
of treating women diagnosed with hysteria.

1252
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:12,100
And in this capacity,
how many women have you treated?

1253
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,000
Hundreds, certainly.

1254
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,500
And always good results, I trust?

1255
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,400
we've had few complaints of late.

1256
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,600
ls it true Dr. Granville that,

1257
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,800
incurable cases of hysteria

1258
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,500
demand institutionalization
and surgical hysterectomy?

1259
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:31,900
Please answer the question,
Dr. Granville.

1260
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,900
Well, yes.

1261
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,100
Traditionally, yes.

1262
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:40,100
But only in the most severe,
most persistence cases...

1263
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,600
Thank you, doctor.

1264
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:43,500
We have already address the...

1265
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,300
the persistence of
Miss Dalrymple problem.

1266
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:51,800
ln your professional opinion, Doctor,
as an expert in the field of hysteria,

1267
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,200
how would you describe
Miss Dalrymple behaviour?

1268
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,100
Without a doubt,

1269
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,300
Charlotte Dalrymple is...

1270
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:03,900
erratic,

1271
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,300
and volatile,

1272
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,100
and at times physically aggressive.

1273
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,300
She is also the most
vexing woman I've ever met.

1274
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,700
Thank you, doctor.

1275
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,100
Your Honour,
based on this evidence,

1276
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:22,300
I find that, I must recommend

1277
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:26,900
that Charlotte Dalrymple be remanded to the
chumps for the institute for the criminally
insane.

1278
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,500
With a further recommendation

1279
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:32,900
for immediate
surgical hysterectomy.

1280
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,300
I wasn't quite finished.

1281
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:43,400
Miss Dalrymple is also the
most generous, compassionate,

1282
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,700
selfless and truly Christian

1283
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,700
woman that I have ever met.

1284
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,500
Doctor, you just sworn
that she is erratic,

1285
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,600
volatile,

1286
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,000
and even physically aggressive.

1287
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,000
Would you not characterize
that as hysterical?

1288
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,300
Well, you see...

1289
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,300
after consulting with my patients

1290
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,000
and considerable reflection,

1291
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,900
lt is my professional opinion

1292
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,700
that hysteria is a fiction.

1293
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,300
lt's nothing but a...

1294
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:20,900
a catch-all diagnosis for
women without opportunity

1295
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:24,300
forced to spend their life
tending to domestic chores

1296
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,600
and selfish,
prudish husband who are

1297
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,900
unwilling or unable

1298
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:32,500
to make love to them properly.

1299
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,100
Or often enough.

1300
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,000
I beg your pardon, Doctor...

1301
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,000
Your Honour,

1302
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,800
the Constable suffered
no grave injury.

1303
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:47,500
but great harm must still be done if Miss
Dalrymple is locked away and butchered.

1304
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:50,800
England will lose a
devoted and singular woman

1305
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,600
she can ill afford to spare.

1306
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,700
I grant you, there may
not be room in the world

1307
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,800
for more than one
Charlotte Dalrymple.

1308
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,500
Fortunately for all of us,

1309
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,900
I think they must've
broken the mould.

1310
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,400
ln the case of Charlotte Dalrymple,

1311
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,100
there are no easy answers.

1312
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,500
Mr. Squyers,

1313
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,400
I find your case for hysteria

1314
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:36,100
wanting.

1315
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,600
By your reasoning,
we should lock up every female in

1316
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,700
whom whimsy and logic collide which

1317
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:48,000
suggests me most of
the women in England.

1318
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:50,900
My wife included.

1319
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,700
On behalf of that matter, however

1320
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:56,500
I am loath to offer precedent where

1321
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,800
a policeman safety is being served.

1322
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,400
Miss Dalrymple,

1323
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:03,900
for striking a police officer
in the course of his duty,

1324
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,800
I sentenced you to

1325
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,500
thirty days in prison.

1326
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,800
and I want you

1327
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:15,700
to think most carefully and act
most cautiously in the future.

1328
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,200
Take her.

1329
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,000
Miss Dalrymple.

1330
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,800
Dr. Granville.

1331
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,300
suppose I know that you
might be interestrd.

1332
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:33,700
That's an interesting offer, something to
meditate on while I consider a new career.

1333
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:37,300
Mortimer Granville, you're a good doctor,
and you should remain one

1334
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,700
lnstead of leaching and bleeding
people in cutting them up to no purpose

1335
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:44,100
you, have invented a machine
that does harm to no one

1336
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,900
and makes anyone had comes into
contact with to feel better.

1337
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:52,200
I should think there a very few doctors in
history that could have a glimpse of such
accomplishment.

1338
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,800
You are a confounding woman.

1339
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:00,300
You're all fier and brimstone in one minute,
compliments and common sense the next.

1340
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,300
I am a woman like any other.

1341
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,900
No, no. You're quite unlike
any women I've ever met.

1342
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Will you be alright?

1343
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:09,700
I'm fine. I've got lots
of friends in prison.

1344
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:19,900
Mortimer

1345
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,100
Thought I might find you here.

1346
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:32,900
I've been thinking a
lot about my future.

1347
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,600
And... well, actually

1348
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,700
I was wondering if you
might give me a reading.

1349
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,700
I'm sorry. I've
giving up phrenology.

1350
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:43,300
Oh, Emily, I'm...

1351
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:44,900
I'm so sorry.

1352
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,200
Don't be.

1353
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Charlotte's trial was a
revelation for me as well.

1354
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,400
I realized... I haven't
been living my life at all.

1355
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:57,100
I've been living my father's
idea what my life should be

1356
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:59,100
Phrenology, Chopin.

1357
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,900
Even you, Mortimer.

1358
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,900
You seem happy.

1359
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,300
I am.

1360
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:12,100
After all, life will always be to large
extent to what we ourselves make it.

1361
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:16,100
The inimitable Mr. Smiles.
I shall miss him.

1362
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:17,900
And I shall miss you.

1363
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,400
God, you're naughty

1364
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,900
I should never send
yourself of it .

1365
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:33,100
No, no. Not even for Christmas.

1366
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,800
You just go out and
purchase one for yourself.

1367
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,200
God bless you, Mom.

1368
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:42,000
lt is a clever old woman who can
keep up with today's technology.

1369
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,100
Alright then.

1370
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,500
Lovely chatting to you.

1371
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,600
Ring me anytime. Goodbye.

1372
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,300
Any prospects?

1373
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,400
My name is mud.

1374
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:57,900
Open this.

1375
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,900
I told you before l
don't want your money.

1376
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:07,800
lt's not my money, it's yours.

1377
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,200
lt's your share of the royalties

1378
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,100
of my manufacturers.

1379
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,900
The portable electric massager.

1380
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:19,200
The portable electric massager?

1381
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:22,300
Yes, I told you I was working
on something rather exciting .

1382
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:25,100
You see, I made a very small motor.

1383
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:27,900
lt seems to go really well,
so I shared it to few firms,

1384
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:29,900
and they simply adored it.

1385
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:30,900
And apparently,

1386
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,100
They're selling it directly
to women for home use.

1387
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,900
I really have to admit,
I know for it go so high

1388
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,900
but, it is rather ingenious
that I signifies saying it

1389
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,200
myself.

1390
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:49,100
Don't you understand,
Mortimer? You have your fortune now.

1391
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,100
You can have anything you want.

1392
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:40,600
Miss Dalrymple.

1393
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,300
Dr. Granville.

1394
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,300
Hello.

1395
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,300
Merry Christmas.

1396
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:01,200
I realize it's a day early but
I thought you might need it.

1397
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:02,900
I don't know what to say.

1398
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,500
Apparently, there is a
first time for everything.

1399
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,000
Right.

1400
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:20,800
May I?

1401
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,700
That's lovely.

1402
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,500
Oh, that's very kind.

1403
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:36,900
Oh, there's something more.

1404
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,100
Think of it as a getting
out of prison present.

1405
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:51,100
You once said that with two thousand pounds,
you can change the world.

1406
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,500
You're not serious?

1407
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:53,900
Apparently, I'm rich.

1408
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,200
And the buildings are yet for sale.

1409
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,200
Well, I'm not too late,
am l? You're still interested?

1410
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,800
Yes, of course. More than ever.

1411
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:10,500
Although I should think by the time l
finished, few thousand pounds not be nearly
enough...

1412
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,700
Are you never satisfied, woman?

1413
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,100
might be enough for a clinic.

1414
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:16,000
Clinic?

1415
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,800
Would it pay well?

1416
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:21,900
I'm afraid not.

1417
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,700
Would the cases be interesting?

1418
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,300
Routine, I should think.

1419
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,800
Broken bones,

1420
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,300
sick children,

1421
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,100
needy women.

1422
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:31,400
Sounds revolting.

1423
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:33,300
Perhaps something else.

1424
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:36,300
Perhaps something there.

1425
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,700
I wondered if you
might have an opening

1426
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,900
for a partner, for an equal?

1427
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,200
Mortimer, if you think...

1428
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:52,100
Oh damn it!

1429
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:54,800
Charlotte Dalrymple,

1430
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,800
I love you.

1431
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:03,100
Will you marry me?

1432
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,300
Please don't make me beg.
Not in the street.

1433
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:12,500
I need to kiss you first.

1434
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,800
Charlotte, I hardly think
that in the circumstance...

1435
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,900
- Did you like it?
- Yes, it was rather nice actually.

1436
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:29,800
You so?

1437
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,900
Not bad. You'll get better.

1438
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,600
Who would've thought?

1439
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:55,500
Charlotte and Mortimer, together.

1440
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,100
Life often brings together
strange bedfellows.

1441
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,100
Yes, quite... quite.

1442
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,800
Well, all's well that ends well.

1443
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,300
