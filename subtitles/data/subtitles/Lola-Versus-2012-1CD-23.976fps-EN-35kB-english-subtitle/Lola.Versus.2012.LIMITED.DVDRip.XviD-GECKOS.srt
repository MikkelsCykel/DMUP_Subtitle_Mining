It's Iike everyone always says:

To Iove someone else,
you have to Iearn how to Iove yourself.

1249
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:35,410
But I don't know, after this year,
I don't think that's true.

you will see Iasers shooting out of the moon.

But it's fleeting.

And it's not real.

And I just think I needed some distance
to realize that.

-Was that all you needed?
-Yeah.

You didn't want me or us or any of it.

1292
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:58,559
And then you got this distance.

01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:02,726
But the thing is, I haven't, really.

I mean, you've had time.

It's been months.
