00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,671
Good morning,
good morning!

2
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,839
That was
"A-Billion-and-One Strings,"

3
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,974
playing one of
your favorite tunes.

4
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,143
At the top of the news
this morning...

5
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,551
there's monkey
business in Utah.

6
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,715
A band of renegade
chimpanzees...

7
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,554
have kidnapped Pulitzer prize-winning
poet Lester Charles.

8
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:44,119
<i>What's the big idea?
I'm attempting to sleep!</i>

9
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,461
I doing a broadcasting.
Do you mind?

10
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,400
Whoa,
not in the face!

11
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,166
Uh, the chimps
are protesting...

12
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,402
I've got a mind to reset
your alarm... permanently!

13
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,774
Sorry, folks.

14
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,006
We're experiencing
technical difficulty...

15
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,310
<i>but it's nothing
we can't handle!</i>

16
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,374
This just in.

17
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,045
Domestic violence erupts
in peaceful cottage!

18
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,180
We'll keep
you post...

19
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,588
Whew!

20
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,856
Can't hear your own thoughts
with all the racket.

21
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,430
Holy mother of Edison!
What were you thinking?

22
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,561
You might have
broken my bulb!

23
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:28,733
I'm thinking you think too much.
We need wake-up music.

24
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,675
# So when it's raining #

25
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,076
# Have no regrets #

26

<i>#Because it isn't raining

28
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,762
Blah!

29
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,169
Va-rooooom!

30
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,516
<i>I'll track you to
the end of this carpet.</i>

31
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,492
<i>Come here.
I'm going to get you.</i>

32
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,086
<i>Wait till I fix
your speaker!</i>

33
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,394
Rusetti picks it up
and throws.

34
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,027
<i>Cepeda tags,
he heads for second.</i>

35
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,435
Wait till I get
my plugs on you!

36
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,099
<i>The crowd goes wild.</i>

37
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,540
<i>Can you believe those

38

<i>I've got you.</i>

39
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,811
<i>I've got you now.</i>

40
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,784
Ha, ha, ha.

41
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,787
<i>Come here.</i>

42
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,619
You dare to cross foils...

43
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:55,092
with the greatest Saxon
swordsman in the land?

44
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,959
<i>Have you any
inkling who you're dealing with?</i>

45
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,659
<i>Precisely. A total idiot.</i>

46
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,065
<i>If your saber
wags as loosely as your tongue...</i>

47
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,400
<i>you'll be run through

48
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,929
<i>Defend yourself,
Sir Lampy of Locksley.</i>

49
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,909
- A blow for Richard!
- Ouch!

50
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,946
- A blow for Marian!
- Ouch!

51
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,881
- A blow for Mario, the garbage man.
- Ouch!

52
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,714
<i>And for the boys
at the delicatessen.</i>

53
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,688
<i>And here's one for
the guys on 5th Street.</i>

54
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,690
No!

55
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,558
Whoa! Ugh!

56
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,369
What's going on?
Who turned out the lights?

57
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,836
Good morning.

58
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,998
Good morning,
Toaster.

59
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,542
- Hey, slots.
- Salutations!

60
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,543
Umph!

61
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,974
- Thanks.
- What's on our lineup today?

62
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,044
What are our
instructions?

63
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,181
<i>What are we
gonna do today?</i>

64
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,657
<i>The same thing we've done
for the last 2,000 days.</i>

65
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,160
Chores!

66
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,492
- Chores?
- It'll be fun.

67
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,623
I'm always
up for fun!

68
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,963
Listen, a broadcast
from Ebbets Field!

69
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,265
It's the top
of the ninth...

70
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,965
I don't understand
how chores could be fun.

71
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,476
Not supposed to be fun.
It's work!

72
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,535
I don't like to work
without the Master.

73
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,547
Well, okay.

74
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,413
If you don't want to work,
why don't we play a game?

75
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,545
- What sort of game?
- What are the rules?

76
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,555
There's only one rule.

77
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,921
You can't stop till
the house is clean.

78
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,426
<i>- Boo!
- Boo! - Boo!</i>

79
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,629
Gotcha, pal.
Leave it to me.

80
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,193
Hang on to your hats,
you devil dogs...

81
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,796
because the master
bebop blaster...

82
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,469
is gonna give you
a soul injection.

Absolutely nothing,
nothing at all.

laughing at us.

00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,766
<i>Any day he might
come romping back...</i>

160
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,893
just come whistling
back through that door...

161
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,903
and everything
will be the same...

162
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,598
real peachy keen.

163
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,005
- Uh-huh.
- It's a possibility.

164
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,737
Well, at least we
try to be optimistic.

165
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,803
<i>Optimistic?</i>

166
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,372
Somebody untie the knot
in this guy's cord.

167
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,010
Why don't you
just shut off?

168
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,077
I'm real scared, Kirby.

169
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,350
Are you going
to suck me to death?

170
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,120
<i>- Hmph!
- What is it with you?</i>

171
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,662
<i>You act like you just came
off the assembly line.</i>

172
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,720
Get this through
your chrome.

173
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,096
We've been dumped,
abandoned.

174
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,499
- But he loved us.
- That's right.

175
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,733
So what?
He has a family.

176
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:04,071
<i>They move, he moves.
It's a package deal.</i>

177
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,110
But...

178
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,577
He's not coming back,
pure and simple.

179
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,511
Did you talk to him?

180
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,846
They could drive up
any second.

181
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,078
You really think so?

182
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,747
I'm not talking to you.

183
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,757
<i>You have a combined wattage
of five, maybe less.</i>

184
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,885
It's been years.
It's scrap metal time.

185
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,557
Do what you like.
We're not gonna give up hope.

186
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,759
That's real touching.

187
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:32,031
You're gonna get me bawling
like a baby any time now.

188
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,299
I think
you're jealous.

189
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,206
Sure, I'm jealous of
a bunch of dimwits.

190
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,210
- Dim?
- Yeah!

191
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,269
The Master never
played with you.

192
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,407
Because you're
stuck in the wall!

193
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:52,954
So, it's back to that
stupid static again.

194
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,825
You think I don't know
what's going on in here?

195
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,456
<i>I know what goes on
in this cottage.</i>

196
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,726
It's a conspiracy...

197
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,861
and every one of you
low-watts is in on it.

198
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,906
<i>Just because
you move around...</i>

199
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,237
<i>you think you're
better than I am.</i>

200
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,972
I was designed
to stick in a wall!

201
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,981
I like being stuck
in this stupid wall!

202
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,983
I can't help it...

203
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,849
if the kid was too short
to reach my dials!

204
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,015
We didn't mean it,
really.

205
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,854
<i>It's my function!</i>

206
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,054
Don't.
Wait, wait!

207
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,494
- He's gonna blow!
- Yank the cord!

208
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,126
The fuse!

209
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,680
Poor Air Conditioner.

210
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,348
I didn't know
he'd take it so hard.

211
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,359
He was a jerk anyway.

212
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,328
Hey, what's that?

213
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,728
<i>What is it?</i>

214
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,733
A car.

215
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,735
Not another word
about cars.

216
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,737
You said it.

217
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,739
Sounds close.

218
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,866
Just don't even start.

219
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,035
Sounds real close.

220
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,413
Wah, hah, hah!

221
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,222
Stop it!

222
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:08,087
We're going out
to find him.

223
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:11,492
- What?
- What do you mean?

224
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:13,496
Exactly
what I said.

225
00:17:13,564 --> 00:17:15,998
We're gonna go out
and find the Master.

226
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:17,932
To the city?

227
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:19,902
No matter what!

228
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,167
How would you propose we're
gonna do that, exactly?

229
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,174
I don't know.

230
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:27,472
<i>Come off it.
Be serious.</i>

231
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:29,479
I am serious.

232
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:31,276
You're insane.

233
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:34,841
If only we were wiener dogs,
our problems would be solved.

234
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:37,844
What?

235
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:40,015
Maybe it was
a basset hound.

236
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:42,025
You're all insane!

237
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:45,085
It was a news flash
I picked up about a dog.

238
00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:47,426
In an amazing show
of loyalty and courage...

239
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:50,160
a terrier named Grover
traveled hundreds of miles...

240
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:53,260
<i>to be reunited
with his owner.</i>

241
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:56,135
<i>The poor critter was
accidentally left behind...</i>

242
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:58,732
on a fishing trip
three weeks ago.

243
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:01,369
He had to find his way
across rugged mountains...

244
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:04,380
<i>and scorching deserts
in order to get home.</i>

245
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:07,975
<i>Little Grover turned out
to be one spunky pup.</i>

246
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:10,577
If a dog can do it,
we can do it!

247
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:12,918
But a dog has legs.

248
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,584
Ah, don't be
a wet blanket.

249
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:19,060
- Legs would help.
- Brains wouldn't hurt either.

250
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,429
<i>- Lay off.
- Pipe down, carpet breath.</i>

251
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,298
I'm going,
with or without you.

252
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:26,802
I say we stay.

253
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:29,203
We'll have a new master
when someone buys the cottage.

254
00:18:29,273 --> 00:18:32,436
But I don't want
a new master.

255
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,707
I want
our master.

256
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:39,148
Well...

257
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:41,616
<i>what about the
rest of you?</i>

258
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:44,449
You boys are gonna
need a leader.

259
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:48,185
Alone, you wouldn't last
for 5 minutes out there.

260
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:50,352
I used to be
a mountaineer.

261
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:51,895
Together...

262
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:54,430
we can stand against
the forces of nature!

263
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:56,625
Were you really
a mountaineer?

264
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,726
Sure, ask anybody.
Ask Teddy Roosevelt.

265
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:02,602
We shot moose together
on the Klondike.

266
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:05,870
You know,
I was thinking...

267
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:09,606
you guys will need
somebody bright along.

268
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,547
- Good idea.
- Listen to this.

269
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:15,449
World War II,
the Normandy Invasion...

270
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,478
and who dare but Lampy
to light the way?

271
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:26,387
You know...

272
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:29,399
I thought it would be good
to have somebody come along...

273
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:32,903
who's really... strong.

274
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,938
- And loud.
- And grumpy!

275
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:37,235
And oblivious
to reality.

276
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:40,001
Well?

277
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:50,413
I just know I'm going
to regret this.

278
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:56,960
- Yippee!
- Hot dog!

279
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:04,094
Wow, this is
our last fuse.

280
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:07,399
Good thing we're
getting out of here.

281
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:09,564
I've always
loved travel.

282
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,235
The open road,
the wind in my face...

283
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,744
the flies clogging
up my grille.

284
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:18,714
Yeah? How are
we going to travel?

285
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:21,649
We could all pile
on top of the bed...

286
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,744
and then Kirby
can push us!

287
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:30,120
No, no.

288
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:33,425
Hey, what about
the Master's pogo stick?

289
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:39,068
That's no good.

290
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:41,127
How about we're
in the refrigerator...

291
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:43,332
on a skateboard
and Kirby can pull?

292
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:52,648
No, no. Hey!

293
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:54,911
- Shut up.
- Shut up!

294
00:20:54,985 --> 00:20:57,249
Let somebody else
try for a change.

295
00:20:57,321 --> 00:21:00,313
Arise, Hassan.

296
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:03,121
Arise,
oh magic carpet.

297
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:20,170
We need a longer cord.

298
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:23,680
We need an alternate
power source, I say.

299
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,836
- I guess this is it.
- Uh-huh.

300
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:52,942
<i>Blanket?</i>

301
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:53,942
Huh?

302
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:55,740
Ready to go?

303
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:57,974
Yeah, I'm ready.

304
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:00,175
Okay, Kirby.

305
00:22:27,077 --> 00:22:29,637
Hmm, shag carpet.

306
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:31,647
<i>Look, Lampy.</i>

307
00:22:31,715 --> 00:22:34,183
From here you can see
the really big lamp.

308
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:36,219
<i>Wow!</i>

309
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:38,379
I wonder where
his switch is?

310
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,659
We are pioneers.
Whoa!

311
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:49,993
<i>Can't see the road anymore.</i>

312
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:52,467
Are we going in
the right direction?

313
00:22:52,536 --> 00:22:54,470
<i>I don't think so.</i>

314
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:57,132
You boys need a navigator.

315
00:22:57,207 --> 00:22:58,640
Navigator?

316
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:02,440
I'll tune in a radio
signal from the city.

317
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:05,778
I can take you right there,
lickety-split.

318

Watch out for
low-flying aircraft.

320
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,757
- Ow.
- What's wrong?

321
00:23:21,832 --> 00:23:23,766
He stepped on me.

322
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:26,325
- Did not.
- Did too.

323
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:27,461
Did too!

324
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:28,766
Did not!

325
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,773
Hey, come on.

326
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:34,538
How do you expect us to get
there if you're fighting?

327
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:37,580
You mean we're
not there yet?

328
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:39,912
No, not yet.

329

- A clearing!
- Great.

Spread out the blanket

422

Boodle-boodle.

428
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:24,667
Get out of here!

429
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:28,008
Hey fellas,
come look at this.

430
00:32:28,078 --> 00:32:29,636

00:32:58,441 --> 00:33:00,341
Oh.

434
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,843
No, no.

435
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:03,845
It's just a reflection.

436
00:33:03,913 --> 00:33:05,881
I'm not a flower.

437
00:33:46,723 --> 00:33:47,815
Ribbit.

438
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:52,350
Come on, help me.
They're killing me.

439
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:54,397
Leave him alone!

440
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,731
Stop it.
Give me that.

441
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:13,514
He was chewing
on the Master.

442
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:15,744
Time to go.

443
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:18,788
Bye.

444
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,832
Are you sure this is the right direction?

445
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:39,876
As sure as I am honest.

446
00:34:39,943 --> 00:34:42,537
Then we're definitely lost.

447
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,548
There might be lions
in there.

448
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,380
And tigers
and bears, oh my.

449
00:34:48,452 --> 00:34:51,751
He's such a baby.
Waa-waa!

450
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:46,609
What's the matter,
Kirby?

451
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,611
Battery's running low.

452
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,772
We should
give it a rest.

453
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,474
<i>Turn out that light.</i>

454
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:05,795
Do we have
to stop here?

455
00:36:05,862 --> 00:36:07,796
Only for a while.

456
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:09,991
Just long enough
to lose our minds.

457
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,365
We'll be cannibals
within a few days.

458
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:16,463
You'll be the first
to go, dial face.

459
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,599
Hey, fellas,
we can stay here.

460
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:20,609
Look.

461
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,544
What's the matter?

462
00:36:24,614 --> 00:36:27,640
Eaten alive, the poor sap.

463
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,321
Wow, wow!

464
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:35,717
I thought you
were a goner.

465
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,726
You wish.

466
00:36:37,794 --> 00:36:41,423
We are gonna need
some kind of shelter.

467
00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:43,830
<i>Shelter from the
likes of them.</i>

468
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,232
Come here and say that,
chrome-dome.

469
00:36:46,303 --> 00:36:48,464
- What?
- Oh, sorry.

470
00:36:48,538 --> 00:36:51,063
I meant to say
"vacuous vacuum. "

471
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:55,403
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's get ready to rumble.

472
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,777
In the blue corner,
undefeated champion...

473
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,782
Rocko "The Radio" Ratuno.

474
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,785
Ding!
And there's the bell.

475
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:06,789
They're on each other
like black on a bowling ball.

476
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,051
Look.

477
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:29,104
That concludes
our broadcast day.

478
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:32,012
This is Lowell Winchell
signing off.

479
00:37:32,082 --> 00:37:36,075
Good night, America,
and all the ships at sea.

480
00:37:41,124 --> 00:37:43,183
Thanks.

481
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,457
That's all right.

482
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:04,308
So, what's this thing
with you and the blanket?

483
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:06,076
What thing?

484
00:38:06,149 --> 00:38:10,313
All of a sudden you're
being so darn nice to him.

485
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:13,823
I was just thinking,
and I got this feeling...

486
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:17,155
that I should be nicer
to him for a change.

487
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:19,218
And now
I feel better.

488
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:21,958
<i>- That's weird.
- What's weird about it?</i>

489
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:25,593
You were never
this nice to him before...

490
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:28,695
and now you're nice
to him all the time.

491
00:38:28,772 --> 00:38:30,706
I don't know.

492
00:38:30,774 --> 00:38:34,232
I'm just trying to understand,
figure out what it means.

493
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:36,609
It's kinda
hard to describe.

494
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,117
It's like being next
to a new loaf of bread.

495
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,283
Hmm, let's see.

496
00:38:47,357 --> 00:38:50,849
It's like a warm,
toasty feeling inside.

497
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:53,452
<i>Like a glow.</i>

498
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,760
- A glow?
- Yeah.

499
00:38:55,832 --> 00:38:59,268
I think I know what
you're talking about.

500
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:03,932
It's like the feeling I get
when I think about the Master.

501
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:05,941
<i>That's it.</i>

502
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:09,467
<i>I remember the first time
my bulb burned out.</i>

503
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:14,915
<i>I thought,
"That's it.</i>

504
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,112
<i>"It's over.
I'm burned out.</i>

505
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:20,156
<i>Eighty-sixed.
To the showers! "</i>

506
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:24,626
<i>But then the Master
put in a brand-new bulb.</i>

507
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:29,893
And I just glowed.

508
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:33,192
That's all
there is to it.

509
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:37,297
That's very interesting.

510
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:39,774
Good night, slot head.

511
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,338
Good night.

512
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,392
Blah.

513
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,333
Ahh.

514
00:40:36,132 --> 00:40:37,963
Run.

515
00:41:11,768 --> 00:41:14,498
Aahh. Help me!

516
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:16,869
Help me!

517
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:19,772
Toaster!

518
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:22,710
<i>Blanky!</i>

519
00:41:24,514 --> 00:41:28,280
- Blanky?
- Blanky!

520
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:30,444
Where are you?

521
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,545
<i>- Blanky?
- Blanky!</i>

522
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:35,785
- Blanket!
- Can you hear me?

523
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:43,690
The battery's
gone dead!

524
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,826
We're trapped
like rats...

525
00:41:45,902 --> 00:41:48,234
small rats with
no hair and one light.

526
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:50,238
Blanky!

527
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:55,401
<i>- Blanket!
- Blanky!</i>

528
00:41:57,714 --> 00:42:00,342
Where are you,
you little wimp?

529
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:06,945
<i>Blanky!</i>

530
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,574
Lampy!

531
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,770
<i>Blanky?</i>

532
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:01,675
<i>Where are you?</i>

533
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:06,045
Blan...

534
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,516
...keey?

535
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:12,351
Come on, Blanky,
speak up!

536
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,225
<i>Just relax.</i>

537
00:43:17,293 --> 00:43:19,523
You've done enough.
We'll look for him.

538
00:43:19,596 --> 00:43:21,894
I am feeling
burned out.

539
00:43:21,965 --> 00:43:23,432
<i>Listen.</i>

540
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,627
Lamp was awarded
a Purple Heart...

541
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:27,761
for being wounded
in the line of duty.

542
00:43:27,837 --> 00:43:29,896
<i>Lamps across the nation
were switched off...</i>

543
00:43:29,973 --> 00:43:34,410
<i>for a moment of silence
in respect for his bravery.</i>

544
00:43:34,477 --> 00:43:36,274
<i>Help.</i>

545
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:39,281
<i>- Listen.
- Help me.</i>

546
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:42,910
Toaster, Kirby,
I'm stuck.

547
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:46,387
- I hear him.
- But I can't see him.

548
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:48,890
Maybe he's calling
from blanket heaven.

549
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:52,450
He's a puffy yellow angel,
with a knob nose.

550
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:55,794
He's just stuck,
that's all. Look!

551
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:00,392
Help.

552
00:44:11,447 --> 00:44:13,415
<i>Hang on tight.</i>

553
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:15,178
<i>I am.</i>

554
00:44:15,251 --> 00:44:18,277
<i>Don't let the tremendous height scare you.</i>

555
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:26,091
Hey, watch out.
Come on.

556
00:44:26,162 --> 00:44:28,824
<i>I can't see.
Get off.</i>

557
00:44:30,366 --> 00:44:32,630
<i>Watch out below!</i>

558
00:44:36,005 --> 00:44:37,939
That was
kind of fun.

559
00:44:38,007 --> 00:44:39,941
Now get off
of my face!

560
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:42,876
- Thanks, Kirby.
- Great idea.

561
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,880
You saved me.

562
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,473
I knight thee
"Sir Vac. "

563
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,040
Cut it out.

564
00:44:49,118 --> 00:44:51,348
<i>I did it
so we could go.</i>

565
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:53,514
We're wasting time.

566
00:45:05,935 --> 00:45:08,199
What's this?
What's...

567
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:11,570
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

568
00:45:15,945 --> 00:45:18,004
Kirby, no!

569
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:20,015
Get the cord
out of his mouth!

570
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:22,051
Don't let him
swallow it.

571
00:45:22,118 --> 00:45:24,052
Switch him off.

572
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:35,561
Just shorted right out.

573
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,499
Cracked up, snapped,
sold the farm.

574
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:42,402
- Poor chump.
- How's he look?

575
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:44,406
Better than you,
actually.

576
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:46,408
Keep it up, slots.

577
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:48,535
Carpet-sweeping motions.

578
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:50,875
He should
come around.

579
00:45:50,947 --> 00:45:53,438
<i>Hey, I think
it's working.</i>

580
00:45:54,517 --> 00:45:57,213
Kirby, can
you hear me?

581
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:00,723
Wake up.
Wake up!

582
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:03,850
- Kirby!
- You're all right.

583
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,189
Yeah!

584
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:09,664
Lay off.
Just lay off!

585
00:46:09,732 --> 00:46:13,224
- What's the matter?
- We were worried.

586
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,396
You gave us
a scare, pal.

587
00:46:15,471 --> 00:46:18,235
There's nothing wrong
with me, pal!

588
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:21,072
- Just back off!
- Don't be angry.

589
00:46:21,144 --> 00:46:23,977
Keep your antennas,
knobs, and wires...

590
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,311
and rivets
off my chrome!

591
00:46:26,382 --> 00:46:28,316
<i>Who needs you?</i>

592
00:46:28,384 --> 00:46:31,615
<i>Got to drag you
around all the time.</i>

593
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,622
I'd be better off
without you.

594
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:34,816
But...

595
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:37,325
Especially you,
you little rag.

596
00:46:41,497 --> 00:46:44,796
So how do we get across
this thing, anyway?

597
00:46:48,604 --> 00:46:50,629
Houdini did this once.

598
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:53,335
He was out of the hospital
in no time.

599
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:55,240
That's encouraging.

600
00:46:57,647 --> 00:47:00,138
Okay, Kirby.

601
00:47:21,437 --> 00:47:23,701
Hey, we're not dead.

602
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:26,708
Yeah? Where's some wood
to knock on?

603
00:47:26,776 --> 00:47:28,767
Toaster, you okay?

604
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:31,336
<i>Toaster?</i>

605
00:47:31,414 --> 00:47:35,680
Yeah, I am.

606
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:38,277
Give me some slack.

607
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:41,515
Oh.

608
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,827
Wha...

609
00:47:48,898 --> 00:47:51,423
Agh.

610
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,526
Aaahhhh!

611
00:48:20,463 --> 00:48:23,261
Yeowwww!

612
00:48:33,776 --> 00:48:36,210
Help! Help!

613
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,984
<i>Damn thee,
thou cursed whale!</i>

614
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,359
From the depths of hell
I stab at thee.

615
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,297
- Climb on, you idiot.
- Oh, it's you.

616
00:48:57,366 --> 00:48:59,357
Where's Toaster?

617
00:48:59,435 --> 00:49:01,369
He sank.

618
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,089
Are we glad
to see you!

619
00:49:20,156 --> 00:49:23,455
I really thought I'd
turned in my warranty.

620
00:49:23,526 --> 00:49:25,585
Yeah, until
baggy showed up.

621
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:28,289
I just slipped and
fell in, that's all.

622
00:49:28,364 --> 00:49:31,891
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Sure!

623
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,596
You can't fool us.
We love you.

624
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,230
Like Mrs. Roosevelt
loved her husband.

625
00:49:37,306 --> 00:49:40,571
Here's the shore.
Everybody off.

626
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:43,874
Listen to this!
This is President Roosevelt...

627
00:49:43,946 --> 00:49:46,414
awarding the vacuum
the Medal of Honor.

628
00:49:46,482 --> 00:49:48,416
Blah!

629
00:49:48,484 --> 00:49:51,146
Ha, ha!
That's funny.

630
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,154
I'm dying.

631
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:56,191
Where are we?

632
00:50:01,797 --> 00:50:03,924
I can't
believe this.

633
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,195
I'm really sorry.

634
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,430
Oh, come on.

635
00:50:08,504 --> 00:50:11,098
It's not your fault.

636
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:14,405
Things could be worse,
you know.

637
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:16,570
- How?
- How what?

638
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,637
How could
they be worse?

639
00:50:18,714 --> 00:50:21,182
They couldn't.
I lied.

640
00:50:38,267 --> 00:50:40,201
Can't you find anything?

641
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:42,669
I'm lucky my backup
batteries work at all.

Come on.

644
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,214
Aaah!

645
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:03,588
I knew I shouldn't
have let you guys drive.

646
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:05,752
Come on, pull!

647
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,997

648
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,329
This is great fun.

649
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,426
Let's make these outings
a regular thing, okay?

650
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:16,767
Inflate your bag!

651
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:19,774
Help me!

652
00:51:19,842 --> 00:51:21,434
Aaah!

653

Wow, the poor guy

<i>Just ssss,

657
00:51:34,824 --> 00:51:38,316
Blanky, let go.
Try to untie yourself.

658
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:41,295
I'm not scared.

659
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:49,163
Well, that concludes
our broadcast today.

660
00:51:49,238 --> 00:51:51,433
Actually, it concludes...

661
00:51:51,507 --> 00:51:53,907
all future broadcasting
of any sort.

662

A customer!

679
00:53:47,823 --> 00:53:50,758

Dingy, but nice.

684
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,835
Oh, you poor baby.

Here, you can have
one of mine.

687
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:14,208
Use it in good health...

688
00:54:14,283 --> 00:54:17,047

A blender motor?

There you are!
I found you.

700
00:54:54,156 --> 00:54:56,488
Gotta move you guys
out of the way.

701

This was the

You never quite know
what he's going to do.

708
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:05,750
He's so spontaneous.

709
00:56:05,828 --> 00:56:08,592
W- w-well,
how do we escape?

710
00:56:08,664 --> 00:56:10,655
Did you
hear that?

711
00:56:10,733 --> 00:56:13,201
They want to know
how to escape!

712

01:03:00,542 --> 01:03:02,476
Good-bye, Mom!

801
01:03:02,544 --> 01:03:04,671
<i>Take a sweater.</i>

802
01:03:10,886 --> 01:03:12,820
Hey, Plugsy.

803
01:03:12,888 --> 01:03:16,346
<i>- Yeah?
- Did you hear that?</i>

804
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:18,825
He's taking some old...

805
01:03:18,894 --> 01:03:21,419
<i>stuff to the dorm...</i>

806
01:03:21,496 --> 01:03:23,623
instead of us.

807
01:03:27,302 --> 01:03:29,327
<i>All right, go!</i>

808
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:35,566
You're gonna
like this cabin.

809
01:03:35,644 --> 01:03:37,839
Too bad we
have to sell it.

810
01:03:49,658 --> 01:03:53,219
How are we gonna find the Master...

811
01:03:53,295 --> 01:03:56,025
in this big place?

812
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:05,631
<i>Here it is.</i>

813
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,914
Excuse me...

814
01:04:13,982 --> 01:04:16,143
could you tell us
how to get to...

815
01:04:16,218 --> 01:04:18,448
To, uh...

816
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,284
2470 McBean Parkway.

817
01:04:33,168 --> 01:04:35,398
A113.
This is it.

818
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:37,461
Go ahead.

819
01:04:43,879 --> 01:04:46,541
He's not home.

820
01:04:46,615 --> 01:04:48,606
We'll have to wait.

821
01:04:48,683 --> 01:04:51,413
Let's wait inside
and relax!

822
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:53,545
But it's locked.

823
01:04:53,622 --> 01:04:57,820
Luckily, my war training
included inter-appliance codes.

824
01:04:57,893 --> 01:05:00,760
I will simply render
the secret appliance knock...

825
01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:03,821
and we'll be welcomed
by the native machinery.

826
01:05:03,899 --> 01:05:07,027
Stand aside,
my meager companion.

827
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:18,845
Hiya, pal!

828
01:05:18,914 --> 01:05:20,939
<i>It's them!</i>

829
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:22,950
<i>What are
we gonna do?</i>

830
01:05:23,018 --> 01:05:24,952
<i>Should we
let them in?</i>

831
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:27,147
<i>Shhh!
All right.</i>

832
01:05:28,256 --> 01:05:30,417
How do ya do?

833
01:05:30,492 --> 01:05:33,017
Tarry not upon
our doorstep.

834
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:36,963
Please feel free
to enter, all of ya.

835
01:05:41,503 --> 01:05:44,233
Boy, you were
some lucky kid.

836
01:05:44,306 --> 01:05:47,366
Every summer for as
long as I can remember...

837
01:05:47,442 --> 01:05:50,138
we'd be running
all over this place.

838
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:55,283
I looked her straight
into those big blue eyes.

839
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:57,818
It was you who
killed Johnson.

840
01:05:57,886 --> 01:06:00,320
Parker found out
and you killed him.

841
01:06:00,388 --> 01:06:02,413
Then you tried
to get me.

842
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:04,584
It's your turn,
sweetheart.

843
01:06:04,659 --> 01:06:06,684
Now you're
taking the fall.

844
01:06:06,761 --> 01:06:09,628
There was a shot!
A puff of smoke!

845
01:06:09,698 --> 01:06:12,030
We ran like
the dickens!

846
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:15,228
- And that's how we got here.
- Wow!

847
01:06:15,303 --> 01:06:17,635
Well, something like that.

848
01:06:17,706 --> 01:06:20,197
And all on
your own, too.

849
01:06:20,275 --> 01:06:22,243
How convenient.

850
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:23,834
<i>I mean...</i>

851
01:06:23,912 --> 01:06:26,472
- Remarkable.
- Yeah.

852
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:29,714
<i>Junkyard refugees...</i>

853
01:06:29,784 --> 01:06:32,446
- in this house.
- What's the world coming to?

854
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:35,115
I wouldn't sew a stitch
on that raggedy blanket.

855
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:37,920
If you could
call it a blanket.

856
01:06:37,993 --> 01:06:40,621
- Looks like an old diaper.
- It smells.

857
01:06:40,695 --> 01:06:43,721
- It's raggedy.
- Get that thing away from me.

858
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:46,392
- Did someone wash that thing?
- No.

859
01:06:46,468 --> 01:06:48,698
Yuck.
I'm nauseous.

860
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:52,399
Oh, how do you do?

861
01:06:52,474 --> 01:06:55,375
How do you do?

862
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:03,308
<i>Hey, look at this!</i>

863
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:11,859
<i>Boy!</i>

864
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:13,895
He sure has grown.

865
01:07:13,962 --> 01:07:16,294
What a heartbreaker!

866
01:07:16,364 --> 01:07:18,525
He graduated, too!

867
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,535
Of course!
He knows how to work hard.

868
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:23,696
He's all big now.

869
01:07:23,772 --> 01:07:27,538
<i>- I hope he still needs us.
- Still needs you?</i>

870
01:07:27,609 --> 01:07:30,134
That's the silliest thing
I ever heard!

871
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:33,010
If it isn't
old rabbit ears!

872
01:07:33,081 --> 01:07:35,709
If it isn't
old loudmouth!

873
01:07:35,784 --> 01:07:38,344
- Hi, TV!
- How ya doing?

874
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,650
I've got a few
more seasons left.

875
01:07:40,722 --> 01:07:43,919
The cottage wasn't the same
after they took you away.

876
01:07:43,992 --> 01:07:46,324
Yeah,
it wasn't as noisy.

877
01:07:46,394 --> 01:07:48,362
I see you
haven't changed.

878
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:50,421
Kind of gives you
a sense of security.

879
01:07:50,498 --> 01:07:52,432
Where's the Master?

880
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,491
<i>No one told you?</i>

881
01:07:54,569 --> 01:07:57,504
Is he gonna be surprised
when he gets back!

882
01:07:57,572 --> 01:08:00,097
He just left to
drive out to the...

883
01:08:05,146 --> 01:08:07,979
- Hey!
- What's the idea?

884
01:08:08,049 --> 01:08:10,244
Oh, many pardons.

885
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:13,151
Was you watching
that channel?

886
01:08:13,221 --> 01:08:15,917
Come on in.

887
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:18,789
It's the greatest,
isn't it?

888
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:21,988
You guys sure did some weird
stuff with your furniture.

889
01:08:27,135 --> 01:08:29,262
What happened?

890
01:08:29,337 --> 01:08:31,999
This is... Gee!

891
01:08:32,073 --> 01:08:35,201
Somebody trashed
the whole cottage!

892
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,211
You big dumbo.

893
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,509
Didn't you lock
the doors?

894
01:08:39,614 --> 01:08:42,105
I don't believe
I've ever seen...

895
01:08:42,183 --> 01:08:44,310
quite so many
smiles before.

896
01:08:44,385 --> 01:08:47,115
I've never seen
contraptions with so many...

897
01:08:47,188 --> 01:08:50,646
buttons and knobs
and dials before.

898
01:08:50,725 --> 01:08:52,750
Naturally.

899
01:08:52,827 --> 01:08:55,694
We are on the cutting edge
of technology.

900
01:08:55,763 --> 01:08:58,493
- Wow.
- What does that mean?

901
01:08:58,566 --> 01:09:01,194
I don't know.
What does that mean?

902
01:09:14,081 --> 01:09:16,015

903

905

01:25:53,346 --> 01:25:56,144
So lock up the office,
take down the top...

1116
01:25:56,216 --> 01:25:58,343
and open that
rumble seat!

1117
01:25:58,418 --> 01:26:01,012
Last one to Coney Island
is a party pooper.

1118
01:26:01,087 --> 01:26:03,851
From the starlight roof
high atop the Ritz...

1119
01:26:03,923 --> 01:26:06,414
we wish our intrepid
little friends...

1120
01:26:06,493 --> 01:26:08,552
the best of luck...

1121
01:26:08,628 --> 01:26:11,153
and a fond farewell!

1122
01:26:11,231 --> 01:26:14,200
Ah, you're all
a bunch of junk.
