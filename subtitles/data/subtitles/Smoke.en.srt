1
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,280
I'll tell you why they're
not going anywhere.

2
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,760
Yeah? And why is that?

3
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Management. Those guys are walking
around with their heads up their asses.

4
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,680
They made some great deals. Tommy. Hernandez. Carter.
Without those two, there never woulda been no World Series.

5
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,520
That was four years ago.
I'm talking about now.

6
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,760
Look who they got rid of.

7
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,760
Mitchell. Backman. McDowell.
Dykstra. Aguillera. Mookie. Mookie

8
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,840
Wilson, for Chrissakes.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,720
And Nolan Ryan. Don't forget him.

10
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,080
Yeah. And Amos Otis.

11
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,040
The team was good, the best
fucking team in baseball.

12
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
But then they had to screw it up.

13
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?

14
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,280
Hey, man. Good to see
you. What'll it be today?

15
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,320
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks.

16
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,000
And throw in a lighter
while you're at it.

17
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,400
The boys and I were just
having a philosophical

18
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,560
discussion about women and cigars

19
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,440
I suppose it all goes
back to Queen Elizabeth.

20
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,240
The Queen of England?

21
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,480
Not Elizabeth the Second,
Elizabeth the First.

22
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,040
Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?

23
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,960
Sure. He's the guy who threw
his cloak down over the puddle.

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,240
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes.

25
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,920
They came with a free
gift coupon in every pack.

26
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,080
That's the man. Well, Raleigh was the
person who introduced tobacco in England,

27
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,200
and since he was a
favorite of the Queen's

28
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Queen Bess, he used to call her –

29
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,440
smoking caught on as a fashion at court.

30
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,520
I'm sure Old Bess must have shared
a stogie or two with Sir Walter.

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Once, he made a bet with her that
he could measure the weight of smoke.

32
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,560
You mean, weigh smoke?

33
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,800
Exactly. Weigh smoke.

34
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,560
You can't do that.
It's like weighing air.

35
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,520
I admit it's strange. Almost
like weighing someone's soul.

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,600
But Sir Walter was a clever guy.

37
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,120
First, he took an unsmoked cigar and
put it on a balance and weighed it.

38
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,360
Then he lit up and smoked the cigar,

39
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,680
carefully tapping the
ashes into the balance pan.

40
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,240
When he was finished, he
put the butt into the pan

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,280
along with the ashes and
weighed what was there.

42
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,120
Then he subtracted that number from the
original weight of the unsmoked cigar.

43
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,960
The difference was the
weight of the smoke.

44
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,720
He's a writer.

45
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,200
Lives in the neighborhood.

46
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,120
And what kind of writer
is he? An underwriter?

47
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,800
Very funny. Some of the
cracks you make. Tommy,

48
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,720
sometimes I think you
should see a doctor.

49
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,440
You know, go in for some
wit therapy or something.

50
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,880
To clean out the valves in your brain.

51
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,920
It was just a joke, Auggie.

52
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,080
The guy's a novelist.

53
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,400
Paul Benjamin. You ever hear of him?

54
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,680
That's a stupid question.

55
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,240
The only things you guys
read is the Racing Form

56
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,160
and sports pages of the Post.

57
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,200
He's published three or four books.

58
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,800
But nothing now for the past few years.

59
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
What's the matter? He run out of ideas?

60
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,960
He ran out of luck.

61
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,400
Remember that holdup out here
on Seventh Avenue few years back?

62
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,360
You talking about the bank?

63
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,920
The time those two guys started
spraying bullets all over the street?

64
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,160
That's it. Four people got killed.

65
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,080
One of them was Paul's wife.

66
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,480
The poor lug, he hasn't
been the same since.

67
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,840
The funny thing was, she stopped
in here just before it happened.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,480
To stock up on cigars for him.
She was a nice lady, Ellen.

69
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,040
Four or five months pregnant
at the time, which means

70
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,400
that when she was killed,
the baby was killed, too.

71
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,680
Bad day at Black Rock, eh, Auggie?

72
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,680
It was bad, all right.

73
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,440
I sometimes think that if she hadn't
given me exact change that day,

74
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,320
or if the store had been
a little more crowded,

75
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,120
it would have taken her a few
more seconds to get out of here,

76
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,040
and then maybe she wouldn't have
stepped in front of that bullet.

77
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,520
She'd still be alive, the
baby would have been born...

78
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,840
Hey! What are you doing there, kid?

79
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,360
Hey, cut that out!

80
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,920
Watch out, man. You'll get
yourself killed like that.

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,680
It's a law of the universe.

82
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,120
You have to let me do something for
you to put the scales in balance.

83
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,080
OK. If I think of something, I'll
send my butler over to tell you.

84
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,560
Please. At least let me
buy you a cup of coffee.

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,320
I don't drink coffee.

86
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,920
On the other hand, since you insist,

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,160
if you offered me a cold
lemonade. I wouldn't say no.

88
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,120
Good.

89
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,240
My name is Paul.

90
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,360
I’m Rashid. Rashid Cole.

91
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,600
Listen, if someone offered
you a place to stay,

92
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,360
you wouldn't necessarily
refuse, would you?

93
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,360
People don't do that kind
of thing. Not in New York.

94
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,520
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do
whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?

95
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,760
Thanks, but I'll manage.

96
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,840
In case you're wondering, I
like women, not little boys.

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,720
And I'm not offering
you a long-term lease...

98
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,200
just a place to crash
for a couple of nights.

99
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,960
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.

100
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,640
Suit yourself.

101
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,320
But if you change your mind,

102
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,880
Miss

103
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,480
Do you have a pen I can borrow?

104
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,040
In case you change your mind,

105
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,160
here's my address.

106
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,200
You don't take anything
seriously, do you?

107
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,600
I try not to, anyway. It's
better for your health.

108
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,800
I mean, look at you, Vincent.

109
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,080
You're the guy with the wife and three
kids and the ranch house on Long Island.

110
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,240
You're the guy with the white shoes and
the white Caddy and the white shag carpet.

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,960
But you've had two heart attacks,
and I'm still waiting for my first.

112
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,000
I should stop smoking
these is what I should do.

113
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,800
The fuckers are going
to kill me one day.

114
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,640
Enjoy it while you can, Vin.

115
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,040
Pretty soon, they're going to
legislate us out of business anyway.

116
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,160
Pretty soon, they catch
you smoking tobacco,

117
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,960
they'll stand you up
against a wall and shoot you.

118
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,800
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow.

119
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,160
In three or four years, it'll probably
be against the law to smile at strangers.

120
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,800
Speaking of which, are you still going
ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?

121
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,960
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd
have them within the next few weeks.

122
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,840
Are you sure you don't
want to go in with me?

123
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,120
Five thousand dollars outlay, a
guaranteed ten- thousand-dollar return.

124
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,960
A consortium of Court
Street lawyers and judges.

125
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,840
They're just drooling to get their
lips around some Cuban cigars.

126
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,720
Hey, I don't care what you do, but just
make sure you don't get caught, okay?

127
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,600
The last I heard, it was still illegal
to sell Cuban cigars in this country.

128
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,400
It's the law that's buying.

129
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,800
That's what's so beautiful about it.

130
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,160
I mean, when was the last time you
heard of a judge sending himself to jail?

131
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,400
Suit yourself. Just don't keep
the boxes around here long.

132
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,040
They come in, they go out. I've
got it planned to the last detail.

133
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,280
I've got to get moving. Terry
will bust my chops if I'm late.

134
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,400
See you in September, Auggie.

135
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,360
Okay, my man.

136
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,160
Are you closed?

137
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?

138
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,680
Do you think I could buy
some before you leave?

139
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,840
No problem. It's not as though I'm
rushing off to the opera or anything.

140
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,520
Looks like someone forgot a camera.

141
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,960
Yeah, I did.

142
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,520
It's yours?

143
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,440
It's mine all right.

144
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,120
I've owned that little
sucker for a long time.

145
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,720
I didn't know you took pictures.

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,040
I guess you could call it a hobby.

147
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,760
It doesn't take me more than
about five minutes a day to do it,

148
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,040
but I do it every day. Rain
or shine, sleet or snow.

149
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,240
Sort of like the postman.

150
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,000
So you're not just some guy who
pushes coins across a counter.

151
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,440
That's what people see, but
that ain't necessarily what I am.

152
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,680
They're all the same.

153
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,320
That's right.

154
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,440
More than four thousand
pictures of the same place.

155
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,920
The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh
Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning.

156
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,200
Four thousand straight days
in all kinds of weather.

157
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,000
That's why I can never take a vacation.

158
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,320
I've got to be in my spot every morning.

159
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,360
Every morning in the same
spot at the same time.

160
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,640
I've never seen anything like this.

161
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,920
It's my project. What
you'd call my life's work.

162
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,640
Amazing.

163
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,560
I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean...

164
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,160
What was it that gave you the
idea to do this... this project?

165
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
I don't know, it just came to me.

166
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,600
It's my corner, after all.

167
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,240
It's just one little part of the world,

168
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,760
but things happen there, too,
just like everywhere else.

169
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,960
It's a record of my little spot.

170
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,440
It's kind of overwhelming.

171
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,000
You'll never get it if you
don't slow down, my friend.

172
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,280
What do you mean?

173
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,800
I mean, you're going too fast. You're
hardly even looking at the pictures.

174
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,400
But they're all the same.

175
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,280
They're all the same, but each one
is different from every other one.

176
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,360
You've got your bright
mornings and your dark mornings.

177
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,440
You've got your summer
light and your autumn light.

178
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,200
You've got your weekdays
and your weekends.

179
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,480
You've got your people
in overcoats and galoshes,

180
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,640
and you've got your people
in T- shirts and shorts.

181
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,440
Sometimes the same people,
sometimes different ones.

182
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,960
And sometimes the different
ones become the same,

183
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,800
and the same ones disappear.

184
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,080
The earth revolves around
the sun, and every day

185
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,800
the light from the sun hits
the earth at a different angle.

186
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,080
Slow down, huh?

187
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,240
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend.

188
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,760
You know how it is.

189
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,120
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow,

190
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,080
time creeps on its petty pace.

191
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,400
Jesus.

192
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,840
Look.

193
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,200
It's Ellen.

194
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,960
Yeah. There her allright.

195
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,440
She's in quite a few from that year.

196
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,400
She must have been on her way to work.

197
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,360
It's Ellen.

198
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,560
Look at her.

199
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,240
Look at my sweet darling.

200
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,840
Shit.

201
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,840
Who is it?

202
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,280
Rashid.

203
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,080
Who?

204
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,680
Rashid Cole. The lemonade kid, remember?

205
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,920
Yeah. Come on up.

206
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,080
Come on in. I didn't
expect to see you again.

207
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,760
Same here.

208
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,920
But I had a long talk with my
accountant this afternoon, you know,

209
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,320
to see how a move like this
would affect my tax picture,

210
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,240
and he said it would be okay.

211
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,840
Time to wake up.

212
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,480
Rashid!

213
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,160
Up and out. I have to work in
here. The slumber party is over.

214
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,080
What time is it?

215
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,320
Eight-thirty.

216
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,440
Eight-thirty?

217
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,320
You'll find juice and eggs
and milk in the refrigerator.

218
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,600
Cereal in the cupboard.
Coffee on the stove.

219
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Take whatever you want. But it's
time for me to get started in here.

220
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,400
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise.
Can't you see I'm trying to work?

221
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm sorry. They just... they
just slipped out of my hands.

222
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,160
A little less clumsiness around
here would be nice, don't you think?

223
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,040
How long have you been here?

224
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,160
Two nights.

225
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,440
And how long did I
tell you you could stay?

226
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,440
A couple of nights.

227
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,520
Well, it looks like our
time is up, doesn't it?

228
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,320
I'm sorry I messed up.
You've been very kind to me...

229
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,440
But all good things
have to come to an end.

230
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,480
No hard feelings, okay?
It's a small apartment,

231
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,680
and I can't get my work
done with you around.

232
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,600
You don't have to apologize.

233
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,440
The coast is probably clear now anyway.

234
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,440
Are you going to be all right?

235
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,320
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.

236
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,960
Whatever that means.

237
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,440
Do you need some money?
Some extra clothes?

238
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,120
Not a penny, not a
stitch. I'm cool, man.

239
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Take good care of yourself, okay?

240
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,480
You too.

241
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,640
And make sure the light is green
before you cross the street.

242
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I
think you're a hell of a good writer.

243
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,120
Is your name Paul Benjamin?

244
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,240
How can I help you?

245
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,880
I just want to know what your
game is, mister, that's all.

246
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
How the hell did you
get into the building?

247
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,440
What do you mean, how'd I get in?

248
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,880
I pushed the door and
walked in. What do you think?

249
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,840
The damn lock's broken again.

250
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,880
And so you just barge in on strangers,
is that what you do? Is that your game?

251
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,880
I'm looking for my nephew, Thomas.

252
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,320
Thomas? Who's Thomas?

253
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,440
Don't give me any of that.
I know he's been here.

254
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,800
You can't fool me, mister.

255
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,400
I'm telling you. I don't
know anyone named Thomas.

256
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,320
Thomas Cole. Thomas
Jefferson Cole. My nephew.

257
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,200
You mean Rashid?

258
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,480
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what
he told you his name was?

259
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,200
Well, whatever his name
is, he's not here anymore.

260
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,960
He left two days ago, and I
haven't heard from him since.

261
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,240
And what was he doing
here in the first place?

262
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,760
That's what I want to know.

263
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,120
What's a man like you messing around
with a black boy like Thomas for?

264
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,080
Are you some kind of pervert, or what?

265
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,240
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't
calm down. I'm going to throw you out.

266
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,040
Do you hear me? Right now!

267
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,720
I just want to know where he is.

268
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,640
As far as I know, he
went back to his parents.

269
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,960
His parents? Is that what
he told you? His parents?

270
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,199
That's what he said.

271
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,200
He told me he lived with his mother and
father on East Seventy-fourth Street.

272
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,280
I always knew that
boy had an imagination,

273
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,040
but now he's gone and made up
a whole new life for himself.

274
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,200
Do you mind if I sit down?

275
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,480
He's been living with me and his
uncle Henry since he was a baby.

276
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,520
And we don't live in Manhattan.

277
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,080
We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.

278
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?

279
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,600
He goes to John Jay
High School in Brooklyn.

280
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,200
And his parents?

281
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,160
His mother's dead, and he hasn't
seen his father in twelve years.

282
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,960
I shouldn't have let him go.

283
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,080
Could anything happened lately?

284
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,160
Anything unusual or unexpected?

285
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,200
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't
think it has anything to do with this.

286
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,200
A friend of mine called
about two weeks ago

287
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,360
and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working
at some gas station outside of Peekskill.

288
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,280
And you told your nephew about it?

289
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,840
I figured he had a right to know.

290
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,320
And?

291
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,640
And nothing. Thomas looked at
me straight in the eye and said,

292
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,800
I don't have a father. As far as I'm
concerned, that son-of- a-bitch is dead.

293
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,800
You going to sit here all day?

294
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,120
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

295
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,560
Why don't you pick some other spot?

296
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,000
It gives a man the creeps
to be stared at all morning.

297
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,320
It's a free country, isn't it?

298
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,480
As long as I'm not trespassing on your
property. I can stay here till kingdom come.

299
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,120
Let me give you some
useful information, son.

300
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,880
There's two dollars and fifty-seven
cents in that cash register over there

301
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,040
And considering all the time you've
put in casing the joint so far,

302
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,320
you won't make but about fifty
cents an hour for all your pains.

303
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,720
However you slice it,
that's a losing proposition.

304
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,400
I'm not going to rob you, mister.

305
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,080
Do I look like a thief?

306
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,960
I don't know what you look like, boy.

307
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,120
As far as I can tell, you sprouted up
like a mushroom in this spot last night.

308
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,680
You live in this town... or
on your way from here to there?

309
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,120
Just passing through.

310
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,840
Just passing through.

311
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,160
A lonesome traveler with
a knapsack on his back

312
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,240
plops himself across from
my garage to admire the view.

313
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,960
There's other places to roam,
kid, that's all I'm saying.

314
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,120
You don't want to make
a nuisance of yourself.

315
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,200
I'm working on a sketch.

316
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,840
That old garage of yours is so
rundown, it's kind of interesting.

317
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,800
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a
picture won't improve the way it looks.

318
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,840
Let's see what you did.

319
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,600
It'll cost you five bucks.

320
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,320
Five bucks! You mean you're going to
charge me five bucks just to look at it?

321
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,720
Once you look at it, you're
going to want to buy it from me.

322
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,080
That's guaranteed. And
that's the price: five bucks.

323
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,440
So if you're not
willing to spring for it,

324
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,120
you might as well not bother to look.

325
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,920
It'll just tear you up
inside and make you miserable.

326
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,320
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some
piece of work, aren't you?

327
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,640
I just tell it like it is, mister.

328
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,560
If I'm getting on your nerves, though,
you might want to think about hiring me.

329
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Are those eyes in your head, or are those brown
things bulging out of your sockets just marbles?

330
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,800
You've been sitting here all day, and how many
cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?

331
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,760
Not a one.

332
00:28:46,761 --> 00:28:47,560
Not a one.

333
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,080
Not one customer.

334
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,360
I bought this broken-down shit-hole
of a place three weeks ago,

335
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,200
and if business don't pick up soon,
I'm going straight down the skids.

336
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,360
What do I want to be hiring someone
for? I can't even pay my own wages.

337
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,680
It was just a thought.

338
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,720
Won’t you keep your
fucking thougts to yourself.

339
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,560
Keep your hands to yourself.

340
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,840
Auggie.

341
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,400
Auggie, I think there's a customer.

342
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,240
Hello Auggie

343
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,200
It's really you, isn't it, Auggie?

344
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,200
Christ, Ruby, it's been so
long. I figured you were dead.

345
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,960
Eighteen and a half years.

346
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,440
Is that all? I thought it
was about three hundred.

347
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,280
You're looking good, Auggie.

348
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,640
No I'm not. I look like shit. And
so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.

349
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,840
What's with the patch, anyway? What'd
you do with that old blue marble...

350
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,800
hock it for a bottle of gin?

351
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,240
I don't want to talk about it.

352
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,520
If you really want to know. I lost it.

353
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,200
And I'm not sorry I did.

354
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,800
That thing was cursed, and it
never gave me nothing but grief.

355
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,040
And you think it looks better to go
around dressed up like Captain Hook?

356
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,280
You always were a
son-of-a-bitch, weren't you?

357
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,840
A little weasel with
a quick, dirty mouth.

358
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,960
At least I've stayed true to myself.

359
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,960
Which is more than I can
say about some people.

360
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,160
I came here to talk to you about something,
and the least you can do is listen.

361
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,320
You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh
to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.

362
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,640
Fine. Talk away, lady of
my dreams. I'm all ears.

363
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,840
I think this is between you and
I. Maybe we can have some privacy

364
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,800
You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady
and I have private business to discuss.

365
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,320
Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone
tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got it?

366
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,360
Yeah, I got it.

367
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,760
The store's closed.

368
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
And when do I tell them it's open?

369
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,000
When I tell you it's open. It's
open when I tell you it's open!

370
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,160
Okay, I got it. You don't have to yell.

371
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,960
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?

372
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,720
Will you stop staring at me like
that. It gives me the creeps.

373
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,680
Like what?

374
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,680
Like what you're doing.
I'm not going to eat you up.

375
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,360
I need your help, and if you keep staring
at me like that. I might start screaming.

376
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,520
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help
has anything to do with money, does it?

377
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,000
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to
conclusions before I've even said anything.

378
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,960
And besides, it's not for me.

379
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,280
It's for our daughter.

380
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,720
Our daughter?

381
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,880
Is that what you said? Our daughter?

382
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,880
I mean, you might have a
daughter, but I sure as hell don't.

383
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,560
And even if I did -- which I don't
-- she wouldn't be our daughter.

384
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,200
Her name is Felicity, and
she just turned eighteen.

385
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,040
She ran away from Pittsburgh last year,

386
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,080
and now she's living in some shit-hole
here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico.

387
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,640
Strung out on crack,

388
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,600
four months pregnant.

389
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,400
I can't bear to think about that baby.

390
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,200
Our grandchild, Auggie. Just
think of it. Our grandchild.

391
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,560
Stop it, already. Just stop
all this crap right now.

392
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,000
Was that your idea to call her Felicity?

393
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,120
It means "happiness."

394
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,840
I know what it means. That
still don't make it a good name.

395
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,560
I don't know who else
to turn to, Auggie.

396
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,760
You've suckered me before, sweetheart

397
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,680
Why should I believe you now?

398
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,480
Why would I lie to you?

399
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,080
You think it was easy to come
here and walk into this place?

400
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,360
Why would I do it if I didn't have to?

401
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,240
That's what you told me when I
shoplifted that necklace for you.

402
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,120
You remember, baby, don't you?

403
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,880
The judge gave me a choice:
either enlist or go to the can.

404
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,920
So I wind up in the navy for four
years, instead of going to college

405
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,840
I watch men lose their arms and
legs, I nearly get my head blown off,

406
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run
off and marry that asshole, Bill.

407
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,680
You didn't write to me
for more than a year.

408
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,160
What was I supposed to think?

409
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,320
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I
got a new one, I was clean out of paper.

410
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,120
It was over with Bill
before you ever came home.

411
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,280
Maybe you don't remember it now, but
you were pretty hot to see me back then.

412
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,520
You weren't so lukewarm
yourself. At least at first.

413
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,840
It fizzled, baby.
That's the way it goes.

414
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,680
But we had our good
times? It wasn't all bad.

415
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,200
A couple of moments,
I'll grant you that.

416
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,320
And that's how Felicity
came into the picture.

417
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,040
During one of those two seconds.

418
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,000
You're conning me, sweetheart.
I ain't responsible for no baby.

419
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,800
I thought I could handle it.

420
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
I didn't want to bug you.

421
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,560
I thought I could handle it on my own,

422
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,440
and I couldn't.

423
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,440
She's in it real bad, Auggie.

424
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,760
Nice try, old girl. I'd
like to help you out.

425
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,040
You know, for old time's sake.

426
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,120
But I really can’t right now. All my spare cash is tied up
in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet.

427
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,760
Too bad. You caught
me at the wrong time.

428
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,800
You're a cold-hearted bastard

429
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,680
How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?

430
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,520
I know you think I'm
lying to you, but I'm not.

431
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,560
Every word I told you is
the God's honest truth.

432
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,760
I'll tell you what. You want
to work. I'll give you a job.

433
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,120
Nothing permanent, mind you,
but that upstairs room over there

434
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,400
-- the one above the office
-- is a hell of a mess.

435
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,480
It looks like they've been throwing
junk in there for twenty years,

436
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,560
and it's time it got cleaned up.

437
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,440
What's your offer?

438
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,880
Five bucks an hour. That's
the going rate, isn't it?

439
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,720
It's a quarter past two now.

440
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,240
My wife's picking me up at five-thirty,
so that'll give you about three hours.

441
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,720
If you can't finish today,
you can do the rest tomorrow.

442
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,880
Is there a benefits package, or are
you hiring me on a freelance basis?

443
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,120
Benefits?

444
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,360
You know, health insurance,
dental plan, paid vacation.

445
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,520
It's not fun being exploited. Workers
have to stand up for their rights.

446
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,560
I'm afraid we'll be working
on a strictly freelance basis.

447
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,520
Five dollars an hour?

448
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,840
I'll take it.

449
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,080
Cyrus Cole.

450
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,480
Paul. Paul Benjamin.

451
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,760
Time for a pause, kid. Relax.

452
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,160
I don't mean to be nosy,

453
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,320
but I was wondering what
happened to your arm.

454
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,720
An ugly piece of hardware, ain’t it?

455
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,040
I'll tell you what happened to my arm.

456
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,960
I'll tell you what happened.

457
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,640
Twelve years ago,

458
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,320
God looked down on me

459
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,320
and said, "Cyrus,

460
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,760
you're a bad, stupid, selfish man.

461
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,000
First, I'm going to fill
your body with spirits,

462
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,440
and then I'm going to put
you behind the wheel of a car,

463
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,280
and then I'm going to
make you crash that car

464
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,280
and kill the woman who loves you.

465
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,520
But you, Cyrus,

466
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,760
I'm going to let you live,

467
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,000
because living is a
lot worse than death.

468
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,760
And just so you don't forget
what you did to that poor girl,

469
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,240
I'm going to rip off your arm
and replace it with a hook.

470
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,880
If I wanted to, I could rip off
both your arms and both your legs,

471
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,320
I'm going to be merciful and
just take off your left arm.

472
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,920
Every time you look at your hook,

473
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,440
I want you to remember

474
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,880
what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are.

475
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,800
Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus,

476
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,840
a warning to mend."

477
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,000
So, have you mended your ways?

478
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,280
I try.

479
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,280
Every day.

480
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,560
Hi, baby. How'd it go today?

481
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,720
If I have to wash one more old lady's
hair, I think my fingers would fall off.

482
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Busy, huh? That's good, because things
around here sure were sleepy today.

483
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,040
Don't worry, Cy. It's early days yet.

484
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,080
Hey, it's you.

485
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,680
I wanted to give you this as
a token of my appreciation.

486
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,640
Appreciation for what?

487
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,680
I don't know. For helping me out.

488
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,160
Where did you get that thing?

489
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,320
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five
on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.

490
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,600
Well, that does it.

491
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,840
You'll be able to watch the ball games.

492
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,200
You know, as a little
break from your work.

493
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,240
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

494
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,320
Business meeting.

495
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,880
I'm seeing my accountant
at three o'clock.

496
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,480
Cut it out, will you? Just
cut it out and come back here.

497
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,840
I don't really have time.

498
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,880
Close the door.

499
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,320
Sit down in that chair.

500
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,640
Now listen carefully.

501
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,680
Your Aunt Em came here
a couple of days ago.

502
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,080
She was sick with
worry, out of her mind.

503
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,920
We had an interesting
talk about you, Thomas.

504
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,960
Do you understand what I'm saying?

505
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,040
Your aunt thinks you're
in trouble and so do I.

506
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,800
Tell me about it, kid. I want
to hear all about it right now.

507
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,680
You don't really want to know.

508
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,840
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an
authority on what I want or don't want?

509
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,800
Okay, okay.

510
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,360
It's all so stupid.

511
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,520
There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm.
The Creeper, that's what people call him.

512
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,440
The kind of guy you don't
want to cross paths with.

513
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,400
And?

514
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,120
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm
trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.

515
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,800
To make sure I don't run into him again.

516
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,400
So that's the something you
weren't supposed to see, huh?

517
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,280
I just happened to be walking by...

518
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,160
All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other
guy come running out of this check-cashing place

519
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,200
with masks on their faces
and guns in their hands...

520
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,480
They just about ran smack into me.

521
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,000
The Creeper recognized me, and
I knew he knew I recognized him...

522
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,400
If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed
out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me.

523
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,560
I'm telling you, the Creeper would have
shot me right there on the sidewalk.

524
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,520
But the noise distracted him,

525
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:18,080
and when he turned around to see
what was happening, I took off...

526
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,480
One more second, and
I would have been dead.

527
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,000
Why don't you go to the police?

528
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,160
The man has friends. And they're not likely
to forgive me if I testify against him.

529
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,680
What makes you think you'll be any safer around
here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.

530
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,000
It might not be far,
but it's another galaxy.

531
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,680
Black is black and white is white,
and never the twain shall meet.

532
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,800
It looks like they've
met in this apartment.

533
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,240
Let's not get too idealistic.

534
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,520
Fair enough. We wouldn't want
to get carried away, would we?

535
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,760
Now call your aunt Em and
let her know you're alive.

536
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,320
Get in, Auggie. I've got
something to show you.

537
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,400
You don't give up, do you?

538
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,760
Just get in and shut up.

539
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,160
I'm not asking you to do anything.
I just need you to come with me.

540
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,120
Where to?

541
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,840
Dammit, Auggie, don't
ask so many questions.

542
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,200
Just get in the car.

543
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,880
I told her she was
going to meet her father.

544
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,840
You what?

545
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,280
It was the only way, Auggie.

546
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,000
Otherwise, she wasn't
going to let me see her.

547
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,560
I think you'd better stop
the car and let me out.

548
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,360
Relax, okay? You don't
have to do anything.

549
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,000
Just go in there and pretend.

550
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,400
It won't kill you to do
a little favor like that.

551
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,800
Besides, you might even learn something.

552
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,920
Yeah, like what?

553
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,200
That I wasn't bullshitting
you, sweetheart.

554
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,160
At least you'll know I've
been telling the truth.

555
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,800
Look, I'm not saying you
don't have a daughter.

556
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,200
It's just that she's not my daughter.

557
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,560
Wait till you see her, Auggie.

558
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,680
And what's that supposed to mean?

559
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,280
She looks just like you.

560
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,080
Cut it out.

561
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,040
When I told her I was going to
bring her father, she kind of melted.

562
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,680
It's the first time Felicity's
talked nice to me since she left home.

563
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,760
She's dying to meet you, Auggie.

564
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,280
Nice neighborhood you've brought me to.

565
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,440
Full of happy, prosperous people.

566
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,520
Well?

567
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,400
Well what?

568
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,160
Aren't you going to say anything?

569
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,280
What do you want me to say?

570
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,000
I don't know.

571
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,480
Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad.

572
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,120
Something like that.

573
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,080
I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born
last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.

574
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,240
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.

575
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,200
You told me you wanted to
meet him. Well, here he is.

576
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah, I might have said that.

577
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,160
Chico told me to see what he was like,
maybe there'd be some dough in it for us.

578
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,240
Well, now I've seen him, and
I can't say I'm too impressed.

579
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,440
Are you rich mister?

580
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:46,600
Yeah, I'm a millionaire. I walk around in
disguise because I'm ashamed of all my money.

581
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,320
Be nice, sweetie. We're
just here to help you.

582
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,120
Help? What the fuck do
I need your help for?

583
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,800
I've got a man, don't I?

584
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,440
That's more than you can
say for yourself, Hawkeye.

585
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,360
Hey, hey, don't talk to
your mother like that.

586
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,960
You're telling me you actually
went to bed with this guy?

587
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,800
You're telling me you
actually let him fuck you?

588
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,200
You can do whatever you
want with your own life.

589
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,680
We're thinking of the baby.

590
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,720
We want you to get yourself
cleaned up for the baby.

591
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,200
Before it's too late.

592
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,360
What baby?

593
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,680
Your baby. The baby you're
carrying around inside you.

594
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,440
Yeah, well, there ain't
no baby in there now.

595
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,360
There's nothing in there now.

596
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,200
What are you talking about?

597
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,080
An abortion, stupid.

598
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,880
I had an abortion the
day before yesterday.

599
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,960
So you don't have to bug
me about that shit anymore.

600
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,200
Bye-bye, baby!

601
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,160
Come on, let's get out
of here. I've had enough.

602
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,440
Yeah, that's right, you better go.

603
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,840
Chico'll be back any minute, and I'm sure
your boyfriend doesn't want to mess with him.

604
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,440
Chico's a real man. Not some scuzzy
dickhead you find in last month's garbage.

605
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,840
Do you hear what I'm saying?

606
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,640
He'll chop up Mr. Dad
here into little pieces.

607
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,280
That's a promise.

608
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,000
He'll kick the living shit out of him.

609
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,400
Listen carefully.

610
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,160
About twenty-five years ago, a young
man went skiing alone in the Alps.

611
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,600
There was an avalanche,

612
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,080
the snow swallowed him up,

613
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,200
and his body was never recovered.

614
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,600
The end.

615
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,200
No, not the end. The beginning.

616
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,520
His son was just a
little boy at the time,

617
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,840
but the years passed, and when he
grew up, he became a skier, too.

618
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,160
One day last winter, he went out by
himself for a run down the mountain.

619
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,880
He gets halfway to the bottom and then
stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock.

620
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,400
Just as he's unwrapping
his cheese sandwich,

621
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:03,160
he looks down and sees a body, right
there at his feet, frozen in the ice...

622
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,680
He bends down

623
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,640
to take a closer look,

624
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,280
and suddenly he feels that
he's looking into a mirror,

625
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,680
that he's looking at himself.

626
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,240
There he is - dead - and
the body is perfectly intact,

627
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,760
frozen in a block of ice
- like someone preserved in suspended animation.

628
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,120
He gets down on all fours, looks
right into the dead man's face,

629
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,080
and realizes that he's
looking at his father.

630
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:52,120
And the strange thing is that the
father is younger than the son is now.

631
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,920
The boy has become a man, and it turns
out that he's older than his own father.

632
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,920
So what are you going to do today?

633
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,520
Read, think, do some
drawings if I get in the mood.

634
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,640
But tonight I'm going to
celebrate. That's definite.

635
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,000
Celebrate? What for?

636
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,960
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years
old as of forty-seven minutes ago,

637
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,440
and I think I should celebrate
having made it this far.

638
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,120
Hey, hey. Happy birthday.

639
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,640
I thought I recognized you. You're
Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?

640
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,320
I confess.

641
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,480
I keep waiting for the
next novel to come out.

642
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,920
Anything in the works?

643
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,080
It's coming along.

644
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,160
At the rate he's going, he'll have a
story finished by the end of the summer.

645
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,400
Wonderful.

646
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,080
I apologize for springing
it on you at the last minute,

647
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,440
but Mr. Benjamin and I are
attending a celebration tonight,

648
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,160
and we would be most pleased
if you chose to accompany us.

649
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,840
Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?

650
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,720
Yes. We would be honored.

651
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,880
And what's the occasion
of this celebration?

652
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,080
It's my birthday.

653
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,320
And how many people will be
attending this birthday party?

654
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,800
I wouldn't actually call it a party.

655
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,960
It's more along the lines of a
dinner in celebration of my birthday.

656
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,920
The guest list is quite restricted.

657
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,560
So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself.

658
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,520
If you accept, that
would make three of us.

659
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,080
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner.

660
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,360
But aren't threesomes a little
awkward? How does the phrase go...

661
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,000
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that.

662
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,880
But I have to keep an eye on
Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes.

663
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,960
To make sure he doesn't
get himself into trouble.

664
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,040
And what are you, his chaperone?

665
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,960
Actually, I'm his father.

666
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,080
Most people assume I'm his father.

667
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,240
It's a logical assumption... given
that I'm older than he is and so on.

668
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,120
But the fact is, it's
the reverse is true.

669
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,400
He's my father, and I'm his son.

670
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,960
Hey, man, good to see you.

671
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,760
This is April Lee, Auggie.
April, say hello to Auggie Wren.

672
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:14,280
Howdy, Miss April. I'm right
pleased to make your acquaintance.

673
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:18,440
And this pretty little lady here
is Miss Violet Sanchez de Jalapeno,

674
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,440
the hottest chili pepper
this side of the Rio Grande.

675
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,360
Ain't that so, baby?

676
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,840
Ees so, Auggie. And you not
so cold, neither. Eh, baby?

677
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,880
So, what brings you to a dive like this?

678
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:39,400
It's his birthday so we
decided to whoop it up a little.

679
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,640
How old, kid?

680
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,800
Seventeen.

681
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,160
Seventeen?

682
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,480
I remember when I was seventeen.

683
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:01,640
Christ, when I was seventeen, I was
one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch .

684
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,400
Is that what you are, son? One
little whacked-out crazy fella?

685
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,880
Definitely. I'd say you've
hit the nail on the head.

686
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:16,040
Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll
grow up and become a great man like me.

687
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,560
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking.

688
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,200
You wouldn't need some
help around the store?

689
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,600
Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?

690
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,720
What did you have in mind?

691
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,560
I'm thinking about the kid.

692
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,320
I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.

693
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,480
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your
employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.

694
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,560
A job?

695
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,200
I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.

696
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,840
Come around to the cigar
store tomorrow morning

697
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,040
at ten o'clock and we'll
talk about it, okay?

698
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,280
We'll see what we can work out.

699
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,080
Ten o'clock tomorrow
morning. I'll be there.

700
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,680
I owe you one.

701
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,560
Don't forget.

702
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:26,840
It's 1942, right?

703
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,440
And he's caught in
Leningrad during the siege.

704
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,960
I'm talking about one of the
worst moments in human history.

705
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:38,160
Five hundred thousand people
died in that one place,

706
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,680
and there's Bakhtin,
holed up in an apartment,

707
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,680
expecting to be killed any day.

708
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,920
He has plenty of tobacco,
but no paper to roll it in.

709
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:49,080
So he takes the pages of a manuscript
he's been working on for ten years

710
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,440
and tears them up to
roll his cigarettes.

711
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,480
His only copy?

712
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,600
His only copy.

713
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's
more important, a good book or a good smoke?

714
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,520
And so he huffed and he puffed, and
little by little he smoked his book.

715
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,840
Nice try. You had me going
for a second, but no...

716
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,800
no writer would ever
do a thing like that.

717
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,760
Would he?

718
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,600
You don't believe me, huh?

719
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,280
I'll show you. It's all in this book.

720
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,800
What's this?

721
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,400
I don't know.

722
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,440
Is it yours?

723
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,160
Yeah, it might be.

724
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,360
Here, catch.

725
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,080
So you're saying it
wasn't like that at all.

726
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:56,240
Not exactly. I mean, there
was more to it than I told you.

727
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,200
Christ. You didn't
just see what happened.

728
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,960
They dropped the package on
the ground and you picked it up.

729
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,200
I picked it up.

730
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,240
And started to run.

731
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,000
And started to run.

732
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:14,880
Good thinking.

733
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,400
That's just it. I didn't think.

734
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,480
I just did it.

735
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,280
You have one hell of a knack for
getting into trouble, don't you?

736
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,600
So how much does it come to?

737
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,080
Six thousand dollars.

738
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,120
Five thousand eight hundred and
fourteen dollars, to be exact.

739
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,880
So you robbed the robbers, and
now the robbers are after you.

740
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,080
That's it. In a nutshell.

741
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,640
Yeah, well, you have to be
crazy to do what you did.

742
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,160
If you want my opinion,

743
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,720
take this money back to the Creeper.

744
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,360
Just give it back and
tell him you're sorry.

745
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,560
No way. There's no way I'm giving
that money back. It's my money now.

746
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:56,560
A lot of good it will do
you if the Creeper finds you.

747
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,520
That money is my whole future.

748
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,320
Keep up with that attitude,
and you won't have a future.

749
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,120
Seventeen is a hell of an age to die.

750
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,560
Is that what you want?

751
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,240
I'll be back in about an hour.

752
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,360
Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?

753
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,080
Sure thing. See you later.

754
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,200
It might be illegal, but it's hard to see
where the crime is if there's no victim, right?

755
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,720
No harm done.

756
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,760
This is what it must have felt like
to go to a speakeasy during Prohibition

757
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,360
Forbidden pleasures, eh?

758
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,120
Much business while I was gone?

759
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,440
A little. Not much.

760
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:47,040
This way, gentlemen. Let's
retire to my office, shall we?

761
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,360
What the fuck is going on here!

762
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,720
Look at this! The
goddamn place is flooded!

763
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,520
Holy fucking shit!

764
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,200
The kid's sorry, Auggie.

765
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,000
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.

766
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,880
It took me three years to save up those
five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke.

767
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,720
I can't hardly pay for this beer.

768
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,880
Not to speak of having
my credibility destroyed.

769
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,200
Do you understand what I'm saying?

770
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:15,960
My credibility.

771
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,320
So yeah, I'm sorry, too.

772
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,400
About as sorry as I've ever
been in my whole fucking life.

773
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,040
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.

774
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:39,080
If he's got something to tell me,
why don't he tell it to me himself?

775
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:40,920
It's for you.

776
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,000
For me?

777
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,400
And what am I supposed
to do with a paper bag?

778
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,360
Open it.

779
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,120
What is this, some kind of joke?

780
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,480
No, it's five thousand dollars.

781
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,360
I don't want your
money, you little twerp.

782
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,240
It's probably stolen anyway.

783
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,320
What do you care where
it comes from? It's yours.

784
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,960
And why the hell would
you give me money?

785
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,680
So I can get my job back.

786
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,200
You're a dumb, whacked-out
little fuck, do you know that?

787
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:56,360
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to
make it up to you, can't you see that?

788
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:58,440
He's crazy.

789
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,080
No, he's not. You are.

790
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,160
You're right.

791
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,080
I just wasn't sure you knew.

792
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,560
It's written all over
you like a neon sign.

793
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,240
Now say something nice to
Rashid to make him feel better.

794
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,560
Fuck you, kid.

795
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,640
Fuck you, too, you
white son-of-a-bitch.

796
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,120
Good. I'm glad that's settled!

797
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,920
Mr. Benjamin, I presume?

798
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,680
You got a security problem in
this building, you know that?

799
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,440
The lock on that door
downstairs is busted.

800
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,240
Not a good idea in these troubled times.

801
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,960
You never know what kind of trash
might wander in off the streets.

802
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,760
I'll talk to the landlord
about it tomorrow.

803
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,440
You do that. Don't want no
unpleasant surprises, do you?

804
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,000
And who do I have the
pleasure of talking to now?

805
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,120
Pleasure?

806
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,280
I wouldn't call this
pleasure, funny man.

807
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,400
I'd say it's more in
the nature of business.

808
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,840
It doesn't matter. I
know who you are anyway.

809
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,720
You're the Creeper, aren't you?

810
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,680
The what?

811
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,880
Ain't nobody calls Charles
by that name to his face.

812
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,760
Do you understand me?

813
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,080
Sure, I understand.

814
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,000
...If it happens, it happens.

815
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,760
If it doesn't, it doesn't.

816
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,920
Do you understand what I'm saying?

817
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,120
You never know what's
going to happen next,

818
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,440
and the moment you think you know,

819
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,600
that's the moment you
don't know a goddamn thing.

820
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,000
That's what we call a
paradox. Are you following me?

821
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,000
Sure, Auggie. I follow.

822
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,240
When you don't know
nothing, it's like paradise.

823
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,680
I know what that is.

824
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:15,080
It's after you're dead and you go
up to heaven and sit with the angels.

825
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,960
Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.

826
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,840
If the cops hadn't come, I
might not be standing here now.

827
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,200
They did some number on you.

828
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,920
For once in my life I
managed to keep my mouth shut.

829
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:44,040
There's something to be
said for that, I suppose.

830
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,200
Does it hurt?

831
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,200
Of course it hurts.
What does it look like?

832
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,400
I thought maybe he was pretending.

833
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,680
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?

834
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:55,640
Not a peep.

835
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,440
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days
ago, but she hasn't heard from him either.

836
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,840
It's beginning to get a little scary.

837
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:05,600
That could be a good sign, though.
It could mean that he got away.

838
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:06,560
Or didn't.

839
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,920
There's no way of knowing, is there?

840
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,280
So you're just going
to give up and go home?

841
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,440
I don't have much choice, do I? It's
pretty clear she doesn't want me around.

842
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,560
Still, you can't just write her off.

843
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,040
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do?

844
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:25,200
There's no baby anymore, and if she wants
to throw away her life, that's her business.

845
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:30,280
She's just a kid. There's time for
more babies later. After she grows up.

846
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:34,920
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to
make it to her nineteenth birthday.

847
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,400
Not if you got her into
one of those rehab programs.

848
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,480
I'd never be able to talk her into it.

849
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,080
And even if I could,
those things cost money.

850
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:45,800
And that's just what I don't
have. I'm flat out dead broke.

851
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:46,840
No you're not.

852
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,400
Are you calling me a liar?
I'm telling you I'm broke.

853
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,440
I don't even have insurance
on my goddamned car.

854
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,560
Remember that business venture
I was telling you about?

855
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,640
Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.

856
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:01,800
Bully for you.

857
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,240
No, bully for you.

858
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,320
What's this?

859
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,240
Why don't you open it and find out?

860
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,760
Jesus God, Auggie.
There's money in here.

861
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,280
Five thousand bucks.

862
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,400
And you're giving it to me?

863
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,320
It's all yours, baby.

864
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,160
For keeps?

865
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:32,800
For keeps.

866
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,600
You're an angel, Auggie.
An angel from heaven.

867
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,720
Fuck this angel shit.
Just take the dough, Ruby.

868
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:52,880
But no bawling, okay? I can't
stand people who blubber.

869
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,880
There's just one thing I want to know.

870
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,920
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.

871
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:11,880
Felicity.

872
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,720
She's not my daughter, is she?

873
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:24,720
I don't know.

874
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,400
She might be.

875
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,240
Then again, she might not.

876
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,960
Mathematically speaking,
there's a fifty- fifty chance.

877
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,280
It's your call.

878
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,240
Bureau of Missing
Persons. Sergeant Fosdick.

879
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,400
Well, blow me down.
Peter Rabbit's alive.

880
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,640
Hey. What are you doing here on Sunday?

881
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,920
We decided to have a
picnic. Want to join us?

882
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,880
Uh, yeah, sure. Just a second.

883
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:41,680
Jesus Christ!

884
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:46,880
Hi, kid.

885
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,480
Wow. They sure did a job on you.

886
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:51,680
Research.

887
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,160
I worked the scene right into my story.

888
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:59,160
That makes the medical bills one
hundred percent tax deductible.

889
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,280
Try selling that one to the IRS.

890
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:02,600
You know these men?

891
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:03,960
I thought we had some customers.

892
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:07,440
Yeah, he knows us. But you've
also got some customers.

893
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,400
We came here to deliver
some clean laundry.

894
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,680
It's all right. I really do know them.

895
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:17,920
Cyrus Cole.

896
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,040
Augustus Wren.

897
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:20,920
Paul Benjamin.

898
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,640
That's funny. His name
is the same as yours.

899
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,440
Well, you and Junior have
the same name, too, don't you?

900
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,000
Yeah, but he's my son.

901
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,760
He's my own flesh and blood.

902
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,160
But here you got the same
name as this man here,

903
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:35,440
and you're not even the same color.

904
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,200
That's how we met.

905
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:42,960
We're members of the
International Same Name Club.

906
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:46,720
Believe it or not, there are
846 Paul Benjamins in America.

907
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,840
But only two in the New
York metropolitan area.

908
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,320
That's how Paul and I got
to be such good friends.

909
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,040
We're the only ones who
show up at the meetings.

910
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:59,200
You're full of crap, kid. Why don't you
just come clean and tell the man who you are?

911
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,320
What the hell's going on, guys?

912
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,200
You better ask him.

913
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,560
Yeah, Rashid baby, spill it.

914
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:11,520
Rashid?

915
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,360
Sometimes.

916
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,880
It's what you'd call a nom de guerre.

917
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,240
What the hell are we talking about?

918
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:25,680
Come on. Tell him your real name.
The name on your birth certificate.

919
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:31,920
Thomas.

920
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,760
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?

921
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:40,440
Thomas.

922
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,200
Come on, come on, you yellow
belly. The whole thing.

923
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,880
First name and last name.

924
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:47,800
What difference does it make?

925
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,960
If it doesn't make any
difference, why not just say it?

926
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,960
I was going to tell
him... but in my own time.

927
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,240
In my own time....

928
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,200
No time like the present, man.

929
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:57,880
Well?

930
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:14,080
Thomas Cole. My name is
Thomas Jefferson Cole.

931
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,240
Are you making fun of me?

932
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:32,960
You mocking me?

933
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:35,640
You mocking me?

934
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,800
I won't let no punk kid
stand there and mock me!

935
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:41,159
You mocking me?

936
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,440
Like it or not, Cyrus,
that's my name. Cole.

937
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,560
Just like yours.

938
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,080
Now ask him who his mother was.

939
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,720
I don't like this. I
don't like it one bit.

940
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,200
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?

941
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,400
You shut your mouth!
You shut your mouth now!

942
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:04,400
Damn you. There'll be none of that
on my watch, you dumpy bag of shit.

943
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,280
Stop it! Stop it!
You'll kill him, Cyrus!

944
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,720
He's your son, goddammit! He's your son!

945
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:21,439
Do you want to kill your son?

946
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,280
You’re lying.

947
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:21,360
Look I’m telling you,
there's gonna be another war.

948
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:26,360
Those slobs in the Pentagon'll be out
of job unless they find a new enemy.

949
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:30,720
They got this Saddam character now, and they're
going to hit him with all they've got. Mark my words.

950
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,000
Hey, man, how's it going?

951
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:35,920
Hi, Auggie.

952
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,880
Two, right?

953
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:42,640
Make it one.

954
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,320
You usually get two.

955
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:48,040
Yeah, I know, but I'm
trying to cut down.

956
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:51,360
Somebody's worried about my health.

957
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:52,840
Ah-hah.

958
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,680
And how's the work going
these days, maestro?

959
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:57,640
Fine.

960
01:26:58,600 --> 01:26:59,640
Or it was until a couple of days ago.

961
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:03,800
A guy from The New York Times called
and asked me to write a Christmas story.

962
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,000
They want to publish
it on Christmas Day.

963
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:12,360
That's a feather in your
cap, man. The paper of record.

964
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:17,200
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come
up with something, and I don't have a single idea.

965
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:21,600
You know anything
about Christmas stories?

966
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,280
Christmas stories? Sure,

967
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,320
I know a ton of 'em.

968
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,240
Anything good?

969
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,800
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?

970
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:36,040
I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and
I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard.

971
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,000
How's that?

972
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,840
And I guarantee every
word of it is true.

973
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,160
So. Are we ready?

974
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,440
Ready. Any time you are.

975
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:02,960
I'm all ears.

976
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:11,160
You remember how you once asked
me how I started taking pictures?

977
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:14,360
Well, this is the story of
how I got my first camera.

978
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:17,920
As a matter of fact, it's
the only camera I've ever had.

979
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,760
Are you following me so far?

980
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:20,800
Every word.

981
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,440
So this is the story of how it happened.

982
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,320
Okay.

983
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:32,040
It was the summer of seventy-six, back
when I first started working for Vinnie.

984
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,120
The summer of the bicentennial.

985
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:38,600
A kid came in one morning and started
stealing things from the store.

986
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,080
He's standing by the rack of
paperbacks near the front window

987
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:44,000
He’s stuffing skin
magazines under his shirt.

988
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,840
It was crowded around the counter just
then, so I didn't see him at first...

989
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,400
But once I noticed what he
was up to, I started to shout.

990
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:53,560
He took off like a jackrabbit, and by the time I managed to get out
from behind the counter, he was already tearing down Seventh Avenue.

991
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,200
I chased after him for about
half a block, and then I gave up.

992
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:04,360
He'd dropped something along the way, and since I didn't
feel like running anymore, I bent down to see what it was.

993
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,000
It turned out to be his wallet.

994
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:14,400
There wasn't any money inside,
but his driver's license was there,

995
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,720
along with three or four snapshots.

996
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,400
I suppose I could have called
the cops and had him arrested.

997
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,440
I had his name and
address from the license,

998
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,640
but I felt kind of sorry for him.

999
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,800
He was just a measly little punk,

1000
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,040
and once I looked at those
pictures in his wallet,

1001
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,200
I couldn't bring myself to
feel very angry at him...

1002
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,200
Roger Goodwin.

1003
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,200
That was his name.

1004
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:43,360
In one of the pictures, I remember,
he was standing next to his mother.

1005
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:47,520
In another one, he was holding some trophy he got from
school and smiling like he just won the Irish Sweepstakes.

1006
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,800
I just didn't have the heart.
A poor kid from Brooklyn

1007
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,840
without much going for him,

1008
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:01,040
and who cared about a couple
of dirty magazines, anyway?

1009
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,080
So I held onto the wallet.

1010
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:10,920
Every once in a while I'd get a little urge to send it back
to him, but I kept delaying and never did anything about it.

1011
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,320
Then Christmas rolls around,
and I'm stuck with nothing to do.

1012
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,280
Vinnie was going to invite me over,
but his mother got sick, and he and his

1013
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,400
wife had to go down to
Miami at the last minute.

1014
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,080
So I'm sitting in my
apartment that morning,

1015
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:32,240
feeling a little sorry for myself, and then
I see Roger Goodwin's wallet lying on a shelf.

1016
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,440
I figure what the hell, why
not do something nice for once,

1017
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:42,040
and I put on my coat and go
out to return the wallet....

1018
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:46,280
The address was over in Boerum
Hill, somewherein the projects.

1019
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:50,440
It was freezing out that day, and I remember getting
lost a few times trying to find the right building.

1020
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:54,920
Everything looks the same in that place, and you keep
going over the same ground thinking you're somewhere else.

1021
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:00,680
Anyway, I finally get to the apartment
I'm looking for and ring the bell...

1022
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:02,880
Nothing happens.

1023
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:07,160
I assume no one's there, but
I try again just to make sure.

1024
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:11,200
I wait a little longer, and
just when I'm about to give up,

1025
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,640
I hear someone shuffling to the door.

1026
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:17,960
An old woman's voice asks, "Who's there?"
and I say I'm looking for Roger Goodwin.

1027
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:25,360
Is that you, Roger? she says, and then she
undoes about fifteen locks and opens the door...

1028
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,840
She has to be at least
eighty, maybe ninety years old,

1029
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,360
and the first thing I notice
about her is she's blind.

1030
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:43,600
I knew you'd come. Roger, she says. "I knew you wouldn't forget your Granny
Ethel on Christmas." And then she opens her arms as if she's about to hug me.

1031
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,360
I don't have much time
to think, you understand.

1032
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:56,240
I had to say something real fast,
and before I knew what was happening,

1033
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,920
I could hear the words coming out of
my mouth. "That's right, Granny Ethel,"

1034
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,920
I said. "I came back to
see you on Christmas."

1035
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,120
Don't ask me why I did
it. I don't have any idea.

1036
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:12,280
It just came out that way, and suddenly
this old woman's hugging me there

1037
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:15,760
in front of the door,
and I'm hugging her back.

1038
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:20,040
It was like a game we both decided to
play... without having to discuss the rules.

1039
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:27,600
I mean, that woman knew
I wasn't her grandson.

1040
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:31,840
She was old and dotty, but she wasn't so far gone that she couldn't
tell the difference between a stranger and her own flesh and blood.

1041
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:39,600
But it made her happy to pretend, and since I had nothing
better to do anyway, I was happy to go along with her...

1042
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,640
So we went into the apartment
and spent the day together.

1043
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,520
Every time she asked me a question
about how I was, I would lie to her.

1044
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:53,000
I told her I'd found a
good job in a cigar store.

1045
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:54,480
I told her I was about to get married.

1046
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:58,640
I told her a hundred pretty stories, and
she made like she believed every one of them.

1047
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:02,120
That's fine, Roger, she would
say, nodding her head and smiling.

1048
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:05,120
I always knew things
would work out for you...

1049
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,520
After a while, I started getting hungry.

1050
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,720
There didn't seem to be
much food in the house,

1051
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,880
so I went out to a store in the neighborhood
and brought back a mess of stuff.

1052
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,000
A precooked chicken, vegetable soup, a
bucket of potato salad, all kinds of things.

1053
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:30,960
Ethel had a couple of bottles
of wine stashed in her bedroom,

1054
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:36,200
and so both of us we managed to put
together a fairly decent Christmas dinner...

1055
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:40,600
We both got a little tipsy
from the wine, I remember,

1056
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:44,800
and after the meal was over we went out to sit in the
living room where the chairs were more comfortable...

1057
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,840
I had to take a pee, so I excused myself
and went to the bathroom down the hall.

1058
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,280
That's where things took another turn.

1059
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:01,360
It was ditsy enough doing my
little jig as Ethel's grandson,

1060
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,040
but what I did next
was positively crazy,

1061
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:10,000
and I've never forgiven myself since...

1062
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:12,920
I go into the bathroom,

1063
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,520
and stacked up against the
wall next to the shower,

1064
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,960
I see a pile of six or seven cameras.

1065
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,560
Brand-new, thirty-five
millimeter cameras,

1066
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,120
still in their boxes.

1067
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,360
I've never taken a picture in my life,

1068
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,960
much less never stolen anything,

1069
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:37,240
but the moment I see those
cameras sitting in the bathroom,

1070
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:40,840
I decide I want one of them for myself.

1071
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:43,800
Just like that.

1072
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,760
And without even stopping
to think about it,

1073
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:50,920
I tuck one of the boxes under my arm
and go back to the living room...

1074
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,360
I couldn't have been gone
for more than three minutes,

1075
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:58,480
but in that time Granny
Ethel had fallen asleep.

1076
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:02,040
Too much Chianti, I suppose.

1077
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,920
I went into the kitchen
to wash the dishes,

1078
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:10,160
and she slept on through the
whole racket, snoring like a baby.

1079
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:15,400
There didn't seem to be any point in
disturbing her, so I decided to leave.

1080
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:23,120
I couldn't even write a note to say
good-bye, seeing that she was blind and all,

1081
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:25,480
so I just left.

1082
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:31,880
I put her grandson's wallet on the table, picked up
the camera again, and walked out of the apartment...

1083
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:41,640
And that's the end of the story.

1084
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,720
Did you ever go back to see her?

1085
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:59,040
Once, about three or four months later.

1086
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:04,960
I felt so bad about stealing the
camera, I hadn't even used it yet.

1087
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:09,600
I finally made up my mind to return it,
but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore.

1088
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:14,600
Someone else had moved into the apartment,
and he couldn't tell me where she was.

1089
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,120
She probably died.

1090
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:23,640
Yeah, probably.

1091
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:37,200
Which means that she spent
her last Christmas with you.

1092
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,840
I guess so. I never
thought of it that way.

1093
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:53,440
It was a good deed, Auggie. It
was a nice thing you did for her.

1094
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:57,600
I lied to her, and
then I stole from her.

1095
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,720
I don't see how you can
call that a good deed.

1096
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:03,120
You made her happy. And the
camera was stolen anyway.

1097
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:08,280
It's not as if the person you
took it from really owned it.

1098
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,120
Anything for art, eh, Paul?

1099
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:17,680
I wouldn't say that. But at least
you've put the camera to good use.

1100
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:23,120
And now you've got your
Christmas story, don't you?

1101
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:28,880
Yes, I suppose I do.

1102
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:48,160
Bullshit is a real talent, Auggie.

1103
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:55,840
To make up a good story, a person has to
know how to push all the right buttons.

1104
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,800
I'd say you're up
there among the masters.

1105
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,440
What do you mean?

1106
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:07,680
I mean, it's a good story.

1107
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:18,480
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with
your friends, what kind of friend are you?

1108
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:36,640
Exactly. Life just wouldn't
be worth living, would it?

1109
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:30,000
