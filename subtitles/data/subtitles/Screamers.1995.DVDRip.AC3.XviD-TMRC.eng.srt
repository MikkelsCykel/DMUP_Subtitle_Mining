00:00:21,276 --> 00:00:26,406
The year 2078.
A mining colony on planet Sirius 6B.

2
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:33,330
For 50 years, the New Economic
Block, the NEB Corporation, -

3
00:00:33,497 --> 00:00:37,501
- has controlled mining
throughout the known solar systems.

4
00:00:37,668 --> 00:00:40,671
20 years ago, on Sirius 6B, -

5
00:00:40,837 --> 00:00:45,259
- the NEB discovered the solution
to the energy crisis. Berynium.

6
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:50,430
But mining berynium unleashed lethal
doses of radiation and pollution.

7
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:54,768
"The Alliance", a federation
of mine workers and scientists, -

8
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:57,980
- demanded mining be stopped.

9
00:00:58,146 --> 00:01:01,984
The NEB's response
was to declare all-out war.

10
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,488
This conflict has fuelled
a new cold war on Earth, -

11
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:10,784
- but so far the fighting
has been confined to Sirius 6B.

12
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:18,500
Massive NEB bombing raids have
devastated this beautiful planet.

13
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:23,171
Thousands have been killed
by deadly berynium radiation.

14
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:27,885
Now, in the tenth year of the war,
the survivors on Sirius 6B -

15
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:32,681
- are faced with a new threat
beyond imagination...

16
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,974
- Okay, ante up.
- Five.

17
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:25,354
Okay, I see your five.

18
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:35,864
- Back in the slammer.
- Those were my last smokes.

19
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:40,410
This game sucks.

20
00:04:43,622 --> 00:04:48,085
This whole place sucks.

21
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:10,524
Lieutenant, I think you'd
better have a look at this.

22
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:36,300
What the hell is he doing here?

23
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:41,513
Tell the captain we've got
a situation. A NEB coming in.

24
00:05:44,182 --> 00:05:48,478
- How did he get this far?
- I'm going to take him.

25
00:05:51,315 --> 00:05:53,317
He's mine.

26
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:18,217
- What are you waiting for?
- Something's not right. He's alone.

27
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:28,685
Here comes the cavalry.

28
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:46,179
No matter how many times
I see this, it still makes me sick.

29
00:07:54,563 --> 00:08:00,360
I'm glad
those things are on our side.

30
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:07,284
Our side's the good side, right?
Tell me again, it's a little blurry.

31
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:11,997
We created them.
We didn't have any choice.

32
00:08:12,915 --> 00:08:16,752
Without the screamers
we'd have lost the war.

33
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:22,716
- Is the NEB still out there?
- Yeah, but not in one piece.

34
00:08:22,883 --> 00:08:28,722
Just the one?
What the hell was he doing out here?

35
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:33,852
He had something in his hand
that he wanted to show us.

36
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,985
Well...
I guess I'd better take a look.

37
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:45,405
Are you going out there?

38
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:49,868
That's a great plan.
It's probably some kind of bomb.

39
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:54,373
Get off your butt
and open the goddamn door.

40
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:13,517
Check your tabs, sir.

41
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:13,554
CRUCIAL: TO ALLIANCE COMMANDER

42
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:51,216
- Who wrote this shit?
- Mozart.

43
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:55,429
- "Don Giovanni."
- Don Giovanni?

44
00:11:55,596 --> 00:11:58,682
What the hell do you want, Chuck?

45
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:03,604
Tear your eye away from that coin,
and I'll tell you.

46
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,815
It's the portrait of a sphinx.

47
00:12:06,982 --> 00:12:11,945
It belonged to Augustus Caesar, the
first great emperor of the world.

48
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:17,034
Riddle me this, Caesar. We haven't
seen a NEB soldier in six months.

49
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:21,955
Why does one solitary grunt
get shredded by a screamer -

50
00:12:22,122 --> 00:12:25,292
- trying to hand deliver this?

51
00:12:30,255 --> 00:12:34,635
Priority seven. You and me... and
God, if he's still paying attention.

52
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:37,888
I doubt it.

53
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,481
- Is it a trick?
- I couldn't get into it, either.

54
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:51,360
- Don't do that!
- Scared you, didn't I?

55
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,240
Jesus!

56
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:07,209
"From Marshall Richard Cooper,
Fifth NEB Army Command."

57
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:12,130
"To Joseph Hendricksson.
Matters of extreme urgency."

58
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:15,676
"Demand immediate
peace negotiation."

59
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:21,515
"Request two officers.
Safe passage guaranteed."

60
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:25,894
"We await your arrival ASAP."

61
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:30,148
- Peace negotiation.
- They sound pretty desperate.

62
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:36,780
- We've been waiting for this.
- What have we been waiting for?

63
00:13:36,947 --> 00:13:40,242
The end of the war.

64
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:45,080
Maybe it's another bullshit tactic
to get us to lay back.

65
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:48,542
- MacDonald, are you there?
- Yes, sir.

66
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,676
I want the following message
transmitted to San Francisco.

67
00:13:57,843 --> 00:14:02,389
Have received first contact
from NEB army in six months.

68
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:07,603
They wish to open peace
negotiations. Please advise.

69
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:12,733
We picked up an emergency message
from a commercial transport.

70
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,862
We're 5 million miles
off of the shipping lanes.

71
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:22,868
Find out what their emergency is.
No clearance, no landing.

72
00:14:23,035 --> 00:14:26,788
Joe, what do you make of this?

73
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:33,879
Looks like a map
of the forward command post.

74
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:38,884
- They're laying themselves open.
- So why the pony express?

75
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:44,598
They've been completely silent
for two weeks. Not even radio.

76
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:49,436
But why just one guy?
Why not a patrol?

77
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:06,954
- Secretary Green is arriving.
- Thank you, MacDonald.

78
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,679
Joe, Chuck, I have some very
inspiring news for you all.

79
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:28,809
Alliance HQ has been keeping
it classified. Wrapped up tight.

80
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:33,647
The NEB Corporation has approached
us requesting an armistice.

81
00:15:33,814 --> 00:15:38,610
We could actually end this war.

82
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:42,573
Reserves of berynium
have been found on Triton 4.

83
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:50,038
After extensive testing,
there's no sign of radioactivity.

84
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:54,668
We are on the verge of signing
a world peace agreement.

85
00:15:54,835 --> 00:16:01,174
We'd also renew contracts
with the NEB to mine on Triton 4.

86
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:05,971
These negotiations
are extremely delicate -

87
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:11,518
- and we can't afford to do anything
that might upset the apple cart...

88
00:16:11,685 --> 00:16:15,230
- Sorry, sir.
- Fix it.

89
00:16:17,858 --> 00:16:23,113
- There's radiation interference.
- Give me the damn thing.

90
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:29,036
Morse code was better
than this virtual reality shit.

91
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:36,376
It is imperative to make no contact
with NEB Command on Sirius 6B.

92
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:43,175
I'm sure you won't do anything that
would jeopardise our chances now.

93
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:52,559
Peace, can you believe it?
The NEBs are businessmen.

94
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:56,647
Now they're mining on Triton 4,
peace is in their interest.

95
00:16:56,813 --> 00:17:00,275
- Thank God for Green.
- He's a good man.

96
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:03,862
He prevented a war on Earth.

97
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:08,033
A war on Earth
might've done them some good.

98
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,787
If those assholes
rolled around in the mud.

99
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:15,332
- Which assholes?
- NEBs and us.

100
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:19,253
- We were all NEBs once.
- Exactly.

101
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:31,098
I just want to go home.

102
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,602
What's the first thing you'll do?

103
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:38,939
I've got no plans for the future.

104
00:17:39,106 --> 00:17:42,776
- You have a lot to look forward to.
- Income tax.

105
00:17:45,988 --> 00:17:51,410
Are you going to look her up
when you get back?

106
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:56,874
- What for?
- You tell me.

107
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:02,588
She couldn't take it.
She's married and moved on...

108
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:05,632
...and I'm still here.

109
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,429
Not for long.
Do you still think about her?

110
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:14,641
It used to be every minute,
then once a day.

111
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:19,104
About twice a year
I get a kick in the chest.

112
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:21,982
What did she look like?

113
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:26,570
All personnel. Radiation alert!
Please light your reds.

114
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:30,490
I left mine in the office.
Have you got one?

115
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:37,539
He must have been a brave man...
that NEB soldier.

116
00:18:45,505 --> 00:18:50,761
Alert!
All personnel to their stations.

117
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:27,005
- They're not civilians.
- No, a troop transport. All ours.

118
00:19:27,172 --> 00:19:30,342
- How bad is it?
- No survivors.

119
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:35,556
- Then what the hell is that?
- Get me out of here, man!

120
00:19:35,722 --> 00:19:40,060
We're going to cut you out of here.
Just hang on.

121
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:46,775
"Sirius 6B Transportation."
We've got no transportation service!

122
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:52,364
- What the hell is that?
- You've got to look at this.

123
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:59,705
- Look at this.
- And this. It's a bomb factory.

124
00:19:59,872 --> 00:20:02,583
Holy shit!

125
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:05,669
A nuclear reactor!

126
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:11,091
- When did we last see one of these?
- What's happening here?

127
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:15,596
Come on.

128
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:21,476
- Careful. Are you all right?
- Calm down. I'm all right.

129
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:25,772
- Get this man a tab.
- What the hell's a tab?

130
00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:30,444
- This guy's naked here.
- Hold on a second.

131
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:34,281
One second!

132
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,979
I'm out of here.

133
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:38,679
DEPT. OF DEFENCE

134
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,268
REVISED

135
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:03,537
You wanted to see me, Commander?

136
00:22:03,704 --> 00:22:07,791
Yeah.
At ease, we're informal around here.

137
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:11,128
That'll be all, Rodgers.

138
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:19,219
- How are you doing?
- Good... there's a scar on my arm.

139
00:22:19,386 --> 00:22:24,516
If you go outside without a tab on,
you'll lose your arm. Name?

140
00:22:24,683 --> 00:22:29,104
Private Michael Jefferson.
Gunnery specialist on six levels.

141
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:32,316
First class.

142
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:37,779
Level six? You can shoot
the dots off a dice at 100 yards.

143
00:22:37,946 --> 00:22:43,368
If you can load it, I can shoot it.
Instructors used to call me "Ace".

144
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:47,664
- Everybody here calls me "sir".
- Yes, sir.

145
00:22:52,794 --> 00:22:58,759
- Sir, what are they?
- It's a sword. Take a look.

146
00:22:59,718 --> 00:23:04,890
Screamers were developed to
neutralize the war on the ground.

147
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:11,230
- How do you know it's dead?
- I yanked its brain out.

148
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:18,070
- That'll take your finger off!
- You said it was dead.

149
00:23:18,237 --> 00:23:21,740
It still has
a mechanical surface reflex.

150
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:26,328
They get shot up, but can still
swing a sword. Pretty smart.

151
00:23:27,162 --> 00:23:31,959
Maybe too smart.
It seems to have modified itself.

152
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:36,255
Where's everybody else?
The guys who were with me?

153
00:23:36,421 --> 00:23:41,301
- How many men onboard?
- 38, including me.

154
00:23:41,468 --> 00:23:44,805
Now there's one, including you.

155
00:23:48,851 --> 00:23:51,478
Those guys...

156
00:23:51,645 --> 00:23:58,402
I didn't even know them.
I couldn't even talk to them.

157
00:23:58,569 --> 00:24:04,157
Jefferson... what in the hell
are you doing here?

158
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:09,997
There was a nuclear reactor aboard
programmed for weapons manufacture.

159
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:16,837
- I wasn't aware of that.
- You radioed you were civilian.

160
00:24:17,004 --> 00:24:22,509
- Where were you bound?
- Triton 4.

161
00:24:22,676 --> 00:24:26,972
Why were you carrying
a nuclear reactor and weapons?

162
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:30,184
To invade, attack
and extinguish the enemy.

163
00:24:31,351 --> 00:24:35,147
- What enemy?
- The NEBs.

164
00:24:35,314 --> 00:24:39,193
You were going to attack
the NEBs on Triton 4?

165
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,364
Yes... but we're just a task force.

166
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:51,205
4,000 Alliance Army regulars are
on their way to Triton 4 right now.

167
00:24:51,371 --> 00:24:55,209
- Secretary Green informed us...
- Secretary Green?

168
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:59,880
- That's right.
- Secretary Green is gone.

169
00:25:00,047 --> 00:25:05,886
He's been gone
for almost two years.

170
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:11,225
We got a V. R. Communique
from him yesterday.

171
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:17,689
Secretary Green was arrested and
eliminated by the Alliance command.

172
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:23,070
Two years ago.

173
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:34,581
Dismissed.

174
00:25:35,707 --> 00:25:41,004
- I enlisted to fight...
- Dismissed, Jefferson.

175
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:46,677
- The NEBs have been running...
- Get out of here!

176
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:03,235
What in Goïs name
are we doing, Chuck?

177
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:10,450
- We just saw Green.
- We saw bullshit!

178
00:26:10,617 --> 00:26:16,790
You know as well as I do that
they can send us anything they want.

179
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:23,672
- That kid doesn't know policy.
- Get your head out of the lilacs.

180
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:28,385
Do you expect me to believe
that we're being dumped?

181
00:26:28,552 --> 00:26:33,640
That our 20-year stand here has
turned into a galactic gold rush?

182
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:36,852
They keep sending us provisions.

183
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:42,941
Will they let us die up here while
they carry on running the universe?

184
00:26:43,108 --> 00:26:46,653
- I don't buy it.
- Wake up, man!

185
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,533
We are betrayed here, brother.
We are beached.

186
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:58,165
Green's been shit-canned
and this whole place is a lie!

187
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:02,920
They just can't
cut us off up here.

188
00:27:03,086 --> 00:27:05,839
Families on Earth would raise hell.

189
00:27:06,006 --> 00:27:09,301
And they won't take us back there.

190
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:14,515
If we sound off about this, nobody's
going to fight their war for them.

191
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:19,561
They're just going to let us
roll on and on up here.

192
00:27:19,728 --> 00:27:23,023
We ain't ever getting off here.

193
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:28,529
Marshall Cooper and
his NEB Command knows it, too!

194
00:27:28,695 --> 00:27:31,156
He sent us a map.

195
00:27:31,323 --> 00:27:37,788
Your solitary NEB grunt
got his ass shot to stop this thing.

196
00:27:37,955 --> 00:27:40,916
They know it's pointless now.

197
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:47,381
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to NEB Command.

198
00:27:47,548 --> 00:27:50,551
We'll make our own peace right here.

199
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:59,810
NEB said they wanted two men.

200
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:09,027
Somebody's got to stay here in case
anyone else falls out of the sky.

201
00:28:09,194 --> 00:28:12,322
- I'll take Johnny Gung-Ho.
- The kid?

202
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:17,077
I'm not risking any more of our men.

203
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:25,669
This is your tab.
It won't work for anybody but you.

204
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:28,881
That makes me feel a lot better.

205
00:28:29,047 --> 00:28:32,885
Screamers only attack living things.
They read your pulse rate.

206
00:28:33,051 --> 00:28:37,431
Your tab broadcasts
a false heartbeat, flat-lining you.

207
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:42,519
In theory they work perfectly,
but radioactivity corrodes them.

208
00:28:42,686 --> 00:28:46,440
- What then?
- We thank God you're a good gunner.

209
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:04,124
I was remembering that day
up in Point Reyes.

210
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:08,837
- That bartender...
- With the monkey.

211
00:29:09,004 --> 00:29:15,427
The beach. We sat drinking beer,
watching the humpbacks blowing.

212
00:29:15,594 --> 00:29:21,683
You watched the whales, Joe.
I was watching other things.

213
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:26,230
We should go back there.
I'd like to see that again.

214
00:29:26,396 --> 00:29:31,276
What, girls volleyball?

215
00:29:36,657 --> 00:29:39,826
Hey, Joe...

216
00:29:39,993 --> 00:29:42,913
I'll see you soon.

217
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,960
On that day. Jefferson, are you
coming or are you breathing hard?

218
00:29:48,126 --> 00:29:50,963
Good luck.

219
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,985
Cicero, this is Libby.
Radio check, over.

220
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:58,405
Cicero reading you loud and clear.

221
00:30:58,655 --> 00:31:04,453
Next transmission will be 33:00
and then every 4 hours after that.

222
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,082
If I miss one, don't sweat it.
If I miss two...

223
00:31:09,249 --> 00:31:13,503
...move into the office,
change the music and carry on.

224
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:18,926
I'll take the office, but the
"Don Giovanni" will have to go.

225
00:31:19,092 --> 00:31:21,762
Roger, copy.

226
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:57,381
- The air is terrible out here.
- It's what's in the air.

227
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:04,096
- What, radiation?
- This'll neutralize it. Here.

228
00:32:04,471 --> 00:32:09,643
- It's an anti-radiation red.
- That's what poisoned it?

229
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:16,650
That used to be the most profitable,
wonderful enterprise in the galaxy.

230
00:32:16,817 --> 00:32:21,196
It produced berynium. The answer
to the worlïs energy question.

231
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:25,367
A spoonful could take you from
Earth to Saturn in a day.

232
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:29,454
Then those mines started
puking up tons of radiation.

233
00:32:29,621 --> 00:32:34,418
We thought we'd discovered gold...
but we discovered shit.

234
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:41,341
And you smoke this shit just to
neutralize the shit in your lungs.

235
00:32:44,845 --> 00:32:49,433
- How do you know it's working?
- If you don't die.

236
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:58,984
- God! What happened here?
- Blasts.

237
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:02,196
- NEB bombers.
- They nuked the civilians?

238
00:33:02,362 --> 00:33:06,366
The civilians got in the way.
The bombs were aimed at us.

239
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:13,040
You just don't have a clue about
what brought you here, do you?

240
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:18,212
You'd fight for any son of a bitch
if he convinced you you were right.

241
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:23,008
- Someone convinced you.
- Not someone, something.

242
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:27,888
The Alliance was formed
to support you.

243
00:33:28,055 --> 00:33:35,437
You're right, Jefferson. And it
divided my country and my world.

244
00:33:35,604 --> 00:33:41,109
So as much as you're dying
to get shot by some NEB soldier, -

245
00:33:41,276 --> 00:33:45,697
- we're going to make peace
with these people, you and me.

246
00:33:45,864 --> 00:33:51,161
We're going to rip you off
of that experience.

247
00:33:55,457 --> 00:33:58,418
Look at this place.

248
00:33:58,585 --> 00:34:04,716
I came here 20 years ago
to mine berynium for the NEB.

249
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:07,886
We were all NEBs then.

250
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:13,559
The scientists found radiation
and shut down the mines.

251
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:19,731
The NEB Corporation threatened them,
and there was a stand-off for years.

252
00:34:19,898 --> 00:34:23,902
They they started to rain everything
down on us.

253
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:27,781
Nuclear disc bombs, chain bombs,
bacteria crystals.

254
00:34:27,948 --> 00:34:34,746
Civilian survivors were evacuated.
We retreated to the bunker.

255
00:34:34,913 --> 00:34:40,127
- How did you fight back?
- We reinvented an early weapon.

256
00:34:40,294 --> 00:34:44,173
- The sword?
- The autonomous mobile sword.

257
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:46,800
The screamer.

258
00:34:53,932 --> 00:34:55,684
Save it.

259
00:34:57,436 --> 00:35:00,981
They don't eat rats, do they?

260
00:35:01,148 --> 00:35:05,819
We're not sure.
They're scavengers and they learn.

261
00:35:05,986 --> 00:35:11,491
They use everything. Rotting meat
gives off methane gas for fuel.

262
00:35:11,658 --> 00:35:14,661
Maybe eyeball jelly
makes good blade wax.

263
00:35:14,828 --> 00:35:19,583
Are they machines? Are they alive?
I don't understand...

264
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,170
I don't have the answers, Jefferson.

265
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:27,382
- But where are they coming from?
- Underground.

266
00:35:27,549 --> 00:35:31,470
The first design was sent to us
from the Alliance on Earth.

267
00:35:31,637 --> 00:35:34,765
It's all automated now.

268
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:40,270
No one's been down there since they
pushed the first button and ran.

269
00:35:40,437 --> 00:35:46,527
- They make themselves now.
- And no one knows how?

270
00:35:46,693 --> 00:35:51,198
They're down there breeding
like rabbits and no one knows?

271
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:56,578
Am I speaking Swahili?
That's exactly what I mean.

272
00:35:57,913 --> 00:36:01,083
Hit the dirt!

273
00:36:08,215 --> 00:36:12,386
Come out of there!

274
00:36:12,553 --> 00:36:17,558
Come out of there!

275
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:21,270
Come forward.

276
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:30,320
- Stop.
- Can I come with you?

277
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:32,739
My God...

278
00:36:32,906 --> 00:36:36,243
- Cover me.
- Go.

279
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,752
Jefferson.

280
00:37:03,228 --> 00:37:09,193
You all right? It's okay.

281
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,955
What have you got there?

282
00:37:22,956 --> 00:37:25,792
Let me see.

283
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:31,965
That's a good guy.
No, you keep him.

284
00:37:32,132 --> 00:37:37,137
That's your friend.
Where do you live?

285
00:37:37,304 --> 00:37:41,391
- In there?
- Yes.

286
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:44,603
In the ruins?

287
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:52,236
How many are you?
How many people?

288
00:37:52,402 --> 00:37:56,823
- You're alone? How do you survive?
- Food.

289
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:01,328
- What kind of food?
- Different.

290
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:06,208
How do you keep away
from the screamers?

291
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:10,462
- The blades underground that kill.
- I hide.

292
00:38:10,629 --> 00:38:15,467
- Can I come with you?
- No, you stay here.

293
00:38:15,634 --> 00:38:21,431
Give me a macro-ration.
We'll give you something to eat.

294
00:38:21,598 --> 00:38:27,437
We'll come back for you.
In two or three days we'll find you.

295
00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:35,195
Take this.
You tear this and eat it.

296
00:38:35,362 --> 00:38:42,286
- I want to come with you now.
- We'll come back in two days.

297
00:38:42,452 --> 00:38:46,498
You take care of this guy, okay?

298
00:38:56,508 --> 00:39:01,972
We can't just leave him here.
He's a kid. He'll never survive.

299
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:06,518
- What am I saying?
- Can I come with you?

300
00:39:24,828 --> 00:39:31,126
- What's your name?
- David Edward Dearing.

301
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:51,480
- Where's your mum and dad?
- They died in the blasts.

302
00:39:51,647 --> 00:39:55,317
You've been alone here
for four years?

303
00:39:55,484 --> 00:40:00,280
Everything seems to be okay.
Is it safe to make a fire like this?

304
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:04,076
We want to let them know
we're coming.

305
00:40:04,243 --> 00:40:09,623
- Fire keeps the rats away.
- Rats?

306
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:15,045
I had this friend,
he used to eat them. Rats.

307
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,965
You'll appreciate this...

308
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:23,846
You don't just heat up the oil,
that makes them stick to the pan.

309
00:40:24,012 --> 00:40:28,976
You get the pan hot, put the oil
in cold, then add your rats.

310
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:32,813
But don't crowd the pan,
it sucks all the heat out.

311
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,733
You keep flipping them,
or they burn.

312
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,153
- My friend said...
- Jefferson!

313
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:45,868
You must be confusing me
with somebody who gives a shit.

314
00:40:46,034 --> 00:40:52,499
Give me that rock, boy.
Cicero, this is Libby calling.

315
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:57,254
- Come in, Cicero.
- Libby, how is it out there?

316
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:02,259
It's cold.
We're at 14 degrees north latitude.

317
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:06,555
We expect to reach
the NEB Command...

318
00:41:06,722 --> 00:41:09,725
...in about four hours. Hello.?

319
00:41:09,892 --> 00:41:14,855
We've got a new arrival.
He came in yesterday.

320
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:17,774
Chuck, you're breaking up.

321
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:22,362
You'll get your next transmission
at 00:00 hours.

322
00:41:22,529 --> 00:41:27,117
- Libby, over.
- It seems a little strange...

323
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:44,801
If you're gonna be a rock,
be a rock. Don't be a bug.

324
00:41:44,968 --> 00:41:49,723
Don't do that to me!
I nearly pissed my pants... sir.

325
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:53,227
Things ain't what they used to be.

326
00:43:11,513 --> 00:43:14,183
Jefferson!

327
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:34,870
- Didn't you hear it?
- No.

328
00:43:45,547 --> 00:43:49,009
- Good God, man!
- Cool, huh?

329
00:43:49,176 --> 00:43:53,514
- Do you know how much they cost?
- Keep that on your wrist.

330
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,684
- Doesn't it work if it's nearby?
- It stays on your arm!

331
00:43:57,851 --> 00:44:02,231
I'm already dragging one kid around.
Do I have to tie your shoes for you?

332
00:44:02,397 --> 00:44:06,902
Your tab was on
and it was going for you.

333
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:14,076
What is this?
I've never seen this.

334
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:19,456
It looks like an animal.

335
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:25,712
It's not an animal.
It's an upgrade.

336
00:44:25,879 --> 00:44:31,426
- Maybe it's a NEB one.
- Jefferson, relent.

337
00:44:31,593 --> 00:44:35,722
We're getting out of here.
Take your bear with you.

338
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:40,644
- Where are we going?
- A long way for you, kid.

339
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:47,317
You soap the socks the night before.

340
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:51,405
The water dries out
but the soap stays in.

341
00:44:51,572 --> 00:44:56,618
- You've got soap against skin...
- Have you got a dimmer switch?

342
00:44:56,785 --> 00:45:00,998
If you put a teddy bear
in a microwave, nothing will happen.

343
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:05,335
- But a wet frog...
- Shut up.

344
00:46:46,478 --> 00:46:50,649
Jefferson!

345
00:46:53,902 --> 00:46:58,365
Goddamn screamer!
It wanted to kill us.

346
00:46:58,532 --> 00:47:05,873
It can see us and touch us.
I can't tell what the signals say.

347
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:08,417
It can talk.

348
00:47:27,603 --> 00:47:31,398
- He's a fucking toaster.
- That's right.

349
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:35,152
Pinocchio's not a real little boy.

350
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:40,324
- Why didn't it try to kill us?
- It was tagging you.

351
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:45,996
They're smarter now. They get
into our bunkers. They tag along.

352
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:49,833
Who can resist a kid
with a hard luck story?

353
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:55,631
Once it gets inside, the killing
starts. But you knew that already.

354
00:47:55,797 --> 00:48:00,052
- You brought him in here.
- It found us.

355
00:48:00,219 --> 00:48:03,514
What is your reason for being here?

356
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,935
We were invited here
for a peace negotiation.

357
00:48:08,101 --> 00:48:14,107
Marshall Cooper sent this
from NEB headquarters.

358
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:22,157
You want to negotiate.?

359
00:48:22,324 --> 00:48:25,452
We ain't gonna do it here.

360
00:48:29,289 --> 00:48:35,712
- Are you taking them to the bunker?
- You got something better to do?

361
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:44,805
- Sir, do you trust these guys?
- No.

362
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:21,944
- What are you doing?
- Calling the office. Problem?

363
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,449
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.

364
00:50:28,951 --> 00:50:35,457
- How is it out there?
- We've got a new kind of screamer.

365
00:50:35,624 --> 00:50:39,920
- I can't hear you real well.
- It's a kid. A little boy.

366
00:50:40,087 --> 00:50:45,926
- Don't let it into the bunker.
- I can't hear you.

367
00:50:46,093 --> 00:50:49,179
There's too much interference.

368
00:51:07,656 --> 00:51:12,786
That kid, he was like a person.

369
00:51:12,953 --> 00:51:16,123
How did he know what to say?

370
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:20,627
You think Santa
makes them his little elves?

371
00:51:20,794 --> 00:51:23,797
They've got more brains than you.

372
00:51:23,964 --> 00:51:27,092
Fighting won't solve our problems.

373
00:51:27,259 --> 00:51:34,099
One of those kids tagged my patrol.
We took him into our bunker.

374
00:51:34,266 --> 00:51:38,645
- Nobody got out.
- Except you.

375
00:51:39,855 --> 00:51:43,442
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You figure it out.

376
00:51:43,609 --> 00:51:46,445
You guys brought them here.

377
00:51:46,612 --> 00:51:49,656
Only after the bombing started.

378
00:51:49,823 --> 00:51:55,495
But now they don't care what uniform
is covering your ass.

379
00:51:55,662 --> 00:51:58,790
- Neither do I.
- Slow down, soldier.

380
00:51:58,874 --> 00:52:00,501
- Neither do I.
- Slow down, soldier.

381
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:04,296
Would you mind
taking that outside?

382
00:52:04,463 --> 00:52:07,758
Stray bullets
are bad for the inventory.

383
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:13,847
It's worth a lot more
when it ain't all shot to... shit.

384
00:52:14,014 --> 00:52:19,144
I'm letting you stay here out of
the kindness of my heart, Becker.

385
00:52:19,311 --> 00:52:26,735
So follow the ground rules.
First, no gunplay inside.

386
00:52:26,902 --> 00:52:33,116
Second, this is my place,
and nobody touches anything.

387
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:36,870
Real Scotch, not synthetic shit.

388
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:42,543
No spitting.

389
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:48,131
Spare a cigarette?

390
00:52:57,266 --> 00:53:00,561
Well, gentlemen...

391
00:53:00,727 --> 00:53:02,729
Live it up.

392
00:53:24,084 --> 00:53:28,755
I haven't had an American cigarette
in over a year.

393
00:53:28,922 --> 00:53:32,718
There's plenty back at base,
but I forgot to bring them.

394
00:53:32,885 --> 00:53:37,431
- You got the last one.
- Very generous of you.

395
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,732
What is this place, a commissary?

396
00:53:46,899 --> 00:53:52,446
There hasn't been a commissary here
in over two years.

397
00:53:52,613 --> 00:53:55,991
Not since those blades arrived.

398
00:53:56,158 --> 00:54:02,122
- Are you a freelancer?
- Right. Black market, Commander...

399
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:04,708
Hendricksson, Joseph. San Francisco.

400
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:08,837
Jessica Hanson, Pittsburgh.
How do you do?

401
00:54:09,004 --> 00:54:12,049
- It's early in the day for that.
- Yeah.

402
00:54:12,966 --> 00:54:16,595
I'm looking for Marshall Cooper,
Fifth NEB Army.

403
00:54:16,762 --> 00:54:21,016
He'd be in the command bunker,
if there still is one.

404
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:25,938
What about
your communication satellites?

405
00:54:26,104 --> 00:54:30,108
If they're still working,
they'd be in there, too.

406
00:54:30,275 --> 00:54:33,028
What do you mean by that?

407
00:54:33,195 --> 00:54:36,949
You have no idea
of the hell you opened up.

408
00:54:37,115 --> 00:54:44,706
We opened up? Just tell me
where the command bunker is.

409
00:54:44,873 --> 00:54:50,546
You wouldn't last ten yards
out there without me.

410
00:54:50,712 --> 00:54:55,717
- Have you seen it?
- I heard it.

411
00:54:55,884 --> 00:54:59,388
- Hordes of them.
- What hordes?

412
00:54:59,555 --> 00:55:04,393
Davids. I heard them
screaming into the bunker above us.

413
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,813
I heard the soldiers screaming.

414
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,524
Then it got very quiet.

415
00:55:13,485 --> 00:55:19,199
Nothing...
except the smell of death.

416
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:29,459
- Still want a guided tour?
- If Cooper is alive, I'll find him.

417
00:55:31,879 --> 00:55:35,757
I'll take you to Command.
We'll go underground.

418
00:55:40,137 --> 00:55:43,557
- I want something in return.
- Speak.

419
00:55:43,724 --> 00:55:46,518
- I want off this ashtray.
- Where?

420
00:55:46,685 --> 00:55:53,901
Earth. How long do you think
I'm gonna last in here?

421
00:55:54,067 --> 00:56:00,032
Nobody leaves. The NEBs and
Alliance are fighting on Triton 4.

422
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:05,662
They've hung everybody
on this planet out to dry.

423
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:12,461
Good Lord, you're beautiful.

424
00:56:16,089 --> 00:56:21,011
I can take you back
to the Alliance bunker.

425
00:56:21,178 --> 00:56:25,140
- Deal.
- Going somewhere, Jessica?

426
00:56:25,307 --> 00:56:30,270
She's taking me to NEB Command
and I'm taking her to Alliance.

427
00:56:30,437 --> 00:56:34,066
Cosy.

428
00:56:34,233 --> 00:56:38,904
And then what?
Become a prisoner of war?

429
00:56:39,071 --> 00:56:44,034
You can relocate anywhere
if you can get off this globe.

430
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:48,497
Or you can go straight to hell
for all I care.

431
00:56:48,664 --> 00:56:53,293
You're crazy.
You don't know what's down there.

432
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:58,048
- Afraid of the dark, Ross?
- Get off my back.

433
00:57:06,598 --> 00:57:10,602
Look at this. It's one of ours.

434
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:15,399
She's got everything.
And I found something else.

435
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:28,662
- What is it?
- A plutonium rocket.

436
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:33,750
Plutonium? Have I been
blowing smoke out of my ass?

437
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:40,048
We've not used nukes in this war yet
and we're not going to use them now.

438
00:57:40,215 --> 00:57:43,343
So leave it.

439
00:58:02,988 --> 00:58:08,410
Okay, let's get on the good foot.
Anybody that's coming, come on.

440
00:58:08,577 --> 00:58:12,372
"When he's best,
he's little worse than a man."

441
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:17,252
"And when he's worst,
he's little better than a beast."

442
00:58:17,419 --> 00:58:21,465
I never knew they put
Shakespeare in comic books.

443
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:26,261
Ain't it sharp enough yet?

444
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:33,560
It's never sharp enough.

445
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:50,577
I'm not sure if these tabs work,
but stay close to me and Jefferson.

446
00:58:50,744 --> 00:58:54,206
Let's go.

447
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:27,781
This leads to the maintenance tunnel
underneath the command bunker.

448
00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:37,291
I ain't going in there.

449
01:00:35,682 --> 01:00:41,104
Don't tell me a big guy like you
is scared of mice!

450
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:46,235
- Has a rat got your tongue?
- Get off my back.

451
01:00:46,401 --> 01:00:51,532
Is that all you know how to say?
Explain your vocabulary, Ross.

452
01:00:51,698 --> 01:00:57,496
Knock it off!
Just get off my back!

453
01:01:29,862 --> 01:01:33,490
We're almost there.

454
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:05,272
This is the command centre.
This is the ground level.

455
01:02:30,506 --> 01:02:36,803
REDISCOVER PARADISE ON
SIRUS 6B

456
01:03:13,382 --> 01:03:19,179
- What the hell is this?
- It's exactly what you think it is.

457
01:03:21,974 --> 01:03:24,977
I knew it!

458
01:03:25,143 --> 01:03:28,397
We're all gonna die!

459
01:03:31,692 --> 01:03:38,448
Jefferson, if that man moves,
or even farts, shoot him.

460
01:03:42,703 --> 01:03:44,913
Shut up.

461
01:04:08,228 --> 01:04:14,735
If Richard Cooper were alive,
he'd be here, wouldn't he?

462
01:04:23,577 --> 01:04:27,122
The ComSat stabilizers
are all frozen.

463
01:04:28,957 --> 01:04:31,960
This one's free.

464
01:04:41,303 --> 01:04:48,852
Uplink attempt initiated.
Sat Net downlink does not respond.

465
01:04:54,816 --> 01:05:00,822
Malfunction.
Sat Net does not respond.

466
01:07:00,275 --> 01:07:02,402
Way to go, Ross.

467
01:07:08,575 --> 01:07:12,412
Can I come with you?

468
01:07:20,921 --> 01:07:26,593
Jefferson, get everybody
out of here now. Do it!

469
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,555
Go.

470
01:08:18,145 --> 01:08:21,815
AUTONOMOUS MOBILE SWORD
TYPE 1 REVISED

471
01:08:40,501 --> 01:08:45,172
Can I come with you?

472
01:09:08,362 --> 01:09:11,573
AUTONOMOUS MOBILE SWORD
TYPE 3

473
01:09:13,826 --> 01:09:16,328
IDENTIFY TYPE 2

474
01:09:19,832 --> 01:09:23,210
Can I come with you?

475
01:09:36,723 --> 01:09:40,060
We're not leaving
without Hendricksson.

476
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,097
Can I come with you?

477
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:24,021
- Can I come with you?
- Jefferson!

478
01:10:24,188 --> 01:10:27,441
Cute, Jefferson.

479
01:10:48,962 --> 01:10:53,133
It won't take them long
to get through this door.

480
01:11:45,853 --> 01:11:49,982
- Thanks for waiting, Becker.
- Yeah, next time.

481
01:11:50,148 --> 01:11:53,402
There won't be a next time.
That was stupid.

482
01:11:53,569 --> 01:11:59,491
- What was so important back there?
- What other type?

483
01:11:59,658 --> 01:12:04,872
David was a type 3.
The reptile was a type 1.

484
01:12:05,038 --> 01:12:09,251
What's the other type?

485
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:19,970
Can I come with you?

486
01:12:21,805 --> 01:12:25,893
It's a... type 2.

487
01:12:26,059 --> 01:12:30,939
- Genius. You can count up to three.
- Get off my back!

488
01:12:31,106 --> 01:12:36,320
- It's a wounded soldier.
- "Help me. Help me."

489
01:12:36,486 --> 01:12:41,658
There were only a few reported.
We thought you'd discontinued them.

490
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:45,954
- We've never seen them.
- What do they look like?

491
01:12:46,121 --> 01:12:50,417
- Who do they look like?
- Look in the mirror, Ross.

492
01:12:50,584 --> 01:12:56,798
I'm warning you...
just get off my back.

493
01:12:58,258 --> 01:13:03,764
They keep saying the same thing
over and over.

494
01:13:03,931 --> 01:13:06,642
Just get off my...!

495
01:13:09,728 --> 01:13:12,564
Exactly.

496
01:13:27,204 --> 01:13:34,127
He's one of them.
He's a machine. Type 2.

497
01:13:34,294 --> 01:13:38,590
He kept repeating himself.
You heard him.

498
01:13:38,757 --> 01:13:42,511
And what about the scotch?
You saw, he didn't take a sip.

499
01:13:44,304 --> 01:13:48,475
That's right, sir.
We offered, but he refused.

500
01:13:57,651 --> 01:14:00,362
That's blood.

501
01:14:04,032 --> 01:14:10,080
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit? Take a look.

502
01:14:10,247 --> 01:14:16,712
I see a human being who got
wasted for no reason at all.

503
01:14:25,637 --> 01:14:31,476
- What are you looking at?
- That wasn't very human of you.

504
01:14:35,355 --> 01:14:39,359
Until two days ago,
I didn't even know you existed.

505
01:14:39,526 --> 01:14:43,363
You think I'm one of them?

506
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:48,160
Then you'd better kill me, too.

507
01:14:48,327 --> 01:14:55,125
See if I've got any switches inside.
Come on, be on the safe side.

508
01:14:59,713 --> 01:15:03,550
Do it!

509
01:15:05,385 --> 01:15:09,932
Man, I'm out of here.
Anybody that's coming, come on.

510
01:15:27,574 --> 01:15:32,746
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.

511
01:15:32,955 --> 01:15:37,125
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.

512
01:15:40,254 --> 01:15:43,924
If you get killed,
will your man let us in?

513
01:15:44,091 --> 01:15:47,177
Not if he's smart.

514
01:16:08,448 --> 01:16:12,077
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Well, I'm not.

515
01:16:13,787 --> 01:16:18,208
It was a mistake.

516
01:16:18,375 --> 01:16:21,962
I'll kill you
before I let you make another one.

517
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:01,752
Just got out of basic training,
didn't you?

518
01:17:03,962 --> 01:17:07,508
It's pretty obvious you're a rookie.

519
01:17:07,674 --> 01:17:13,347
You think you're the centre
of the universe, but you're not.

520
01:17:13,514 --> 01:17:17,768
We're just insignificant
little specks, you and me.

521
01:17:17,935 --> 01:17:22,147
We're not gonna change the world.

522
01:17:22,314 --> 01:17:26,527
We're not gonna win the war.

523
01:17:26,693 --> 01:17:30,531
Nobody's gonna care that we die.

524
01:17:30,697 --> 01:17:37,454
"Which many signify that you should
snarl and bite and play the dog."

525
01:17:37,621 --> 01:17:41,875
- Not me.
- Shakespeare?

526
01:17:42,042 --> 01:17:44,086
Very good.

527
01:18:33,927 --> 01:18:37,389
Cicero, this is Libby. Over.

528
01:18:37,556 --> 01:18:39,892
Cicero, come in. Over.

529
01:18:42,186 --> 01:18:46,899
Goddamn radiation!
Come on, we've got to get closer.

530
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:56,574
- Come on down.
- We're right in front of the door.

531
01:18:56,575 --> 01:19:02,331
- Come on down.
- We're right in front of the door.

532
01:19:02,498 --> 01:19:08,045
- Come out. Over.
- Bad connection, Joe.

533
01:19:08,212 --> 01:19:12,049
I've got NEBs with me.
Come on up.

534
01:19:12,216 --> 01:19:15,385
You're breaking up, Joe.

535
01:19:19,598 --> 01:19:25,270
- Come up out of the bunker.
- Come on down, Joe.

536
01:19:30,275 --> 01:19:34,321
You come up, Chuck.

537
01:19:35,823 --> 01:19:40,786
- Chuck, that's an order.
- Come on down. Over.

538
01:19:44,998 --> 01:19:49,044
- Chuck...
- Come on down. Over.

539
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:55,008
- Let me speak to Don Giovanni.
- This is Don Giovanni.

540
01:19:55,175 --> 01:19:59,263
Come on down. Over.

541
01:19:59,429 --> 01:20:08,355
- This is your old pal Wolfgang.
- I will open the door. Over.

542
01:20:09,773 --> 01:20:13,861
I'm coming down right now.
Do you copy?

543
01:20:14,027 --> 01:20:19,741
- Come down. Over.
- I'm coming in... Go!

544
01:21:29,311 --> 01:21:32,439
Watch the flame.

545
01:22:04,972 --> 01:22:08,559
- Give me the nuke!
- What?

546
01:22:08,725 --> 01:22:13,063
Give me the mini-pluto
you stole out of the bunker!

547
01:22:18,277 --> 01:22:22,406
- Loading.
- Watch your heads.

548
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:26,368
Hang on!

549
01:23:09,369 --> 01:23:10,662
Help me!

550
01:23:10,787 --> 01:23:13,373
Help me!

551
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:30,432
- Help me!
- Sir!

552
01:23:33,352 --> 01:23:36,063
Help me!

553
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:39,566
- Sir.
- I'm okay, Jefferson.

554
01:23:39,733 --> 01:23:45,572
- What about you?
- Becker's down. He's wounded.

555
01:23:47,407 --> 01:23:50,911
Becker...

556
01:23:53,705 --> 01:23:59,086
- He's wounded...
- Hold on, man.

557
01:23:59,253 --> 01:24:02,130
Wounded.

558
01:24:02,965 --> 01:24:07,052
- Help me.
- Jefferson! No!

559
01:24:07,219 --> 01:24:12,391
Down! Down to hell!
And say that I sent you there.

560
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,814
"I came into the world
with my legs forward."

561
01:24:18,981 --> 01:24:23,777
"And the woman cried,
'He was born with teeth!"'

562
01:24:47,801 --> 01:24:51,471
I had no father.
I am my own father.

563
01:24:51,638 --> 01:24:55,517
I have no brother
I am my own brother.

564
01:25:07,988 --> 01:25:13,160
This word love,
which old farts call blind, -

565
01:25:13,327 --> 01:25:17,372
- be resident in men like you,
asshole, but not in me.

566
01:25:18,332 --> 01:25:21,835
I am my motherfucking self. Alone!

567
01:25:41,104 --> 01:25:43,899
Jefferson!

568
01:25:51,865 --> 01:25:54,493
We're gonna die.

569
01:25:55,619 --> 01:25:59,081
You know that, don't you?

570
01:26:06,421 --> 01:26:09,550
Yeah...

571
01:26:11,426 --> 01:26:15,013
...but not today...

572
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:19,643
...and not here.

573
01:26:19,810 --> 01:26:24,356
Where will we go?

574
01:26:24,523 --> 01:26:28,652
Where do you go
when there's nowhere else to go?

575
01:26:28,819 --> 01:26:30,529
Home.

576
01:26:31,905 --> 01:26:32,605
Earth.

577
01:26:32,656 --> 01:26:35,909
Earth.

578
01:26:36,076 --> 01:26:43,584
There's an emergency escape vehicle
for use by the commanding officer.

579
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:47,880
It's hidden in these mountains
in a place named ironically -

580
01:26:48,046 --> 01:26:56,346
- for where they developed the
first atomic bomb. Alamogordo.

581
01:26:56,513 --> 01:26:59,308
I've never been there.

582
01:26:59,474 --> 01:27:04,980
- What are you talking about?
- There's a way off this planet.

583
01:27:11,487 --> 01:27:16,658
- Type 2?
- Hell if I know.

584
01:27:16,825 --> 01:27:21,497
I've never even seen this tag.
I've never even seen this language.

585
01:27:27,544 --> 01:27:30,464
Can I see it?

586
01:27:35,594 --> 01:27:38,138
Yeah.

587
01:27:44,311 --> 01:27:48,065
God! I'm sorry.

588
01:27:49,775 --> 01:27:52,986
Give it to me. I'm sorry.

589
01:27:56,323 --> 01:28:00,077
I had to know.

590
01:28:00,619 --> 01:28:05,499
No! Don't do that...
you don't need to.

591
01:29:25,245 --> 01:29:28,916
- That's the last one.
- It's okay.

592
01:29:29,082 --> 01:29:33,253
According to this
we should be close.

593
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:37,841
- Does that locator work?
- Yeah.

594
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,803
- Is it up there?
- It should be.

595
01:29:43,222 --> 01:29:47,476
- I don't see anything.
- That's the idea.

596
01:29:54,274 --> 01:29:59,571
I can't go on any more.
I don't want to go on any more.

597
01:30:08,205 --> 01:30:11,124
Listen to me. I don't have anybody.

598
01:30:11,291 --> 01:30:16,964
I don't have a family or a friend
or that kid Jefferson.

599
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:22,719
I don't even have him.
But I have you, do you hear me?

600
01:30:22,886 --> 01:30:26,598
I have you, and we're going home.

601
01:30:30,853 --> 01:30:34,314
I'm taking you home.

602
01:30:42,823 --> 01:30:46,994
BERYNIUM WAS DISCOVERED HERE
ON JULY 16, 2064.

603
01:30:48,579 --> 01:30:53,500
When I took over command,
this was coded in my bio-signature.

604
01:30:53,667 --> 01:30:56,295
- It only works for you?
- We'll soon find out.

605
01:30:56,378 --> 01:30:57,629
- It only works for you?
- We'll soon find out.

606
01:31:04,761 --> 01:31:08,098
Then I'm with the right guy.

607
01:32:20,212 --> 01:32:24,675
- What do we do?
- I have no idea.

608
01:32:24,842 --> 01:32:28,178
Let's try this chair.

609
01:32:28,345 --> 01:32:32,933
What about this?

610
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:36,270
Elevator activated.

611
01:32:38,230 --> 01:32:41,358
Countdown to launch commencing.

612
01:32:42,609 --> 01:32:45,279
It's moving. Get on.

613
01:32:48,282 --> 01:32:52,703
Hang on.
The crane's blocking the trajectory.

614
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:56,331
- I'll be down.
- Okay.

615
01:32:56,498 --> 01:33:01,670
Please clear launch pad.

616
01:33:03,213 --> 01:33:09,761
Gantry inoperable.
Circuit malfunction.

617
01:34:23,085 --> 01:34:25,921
Launch sequence initiated.

618
01:34:26,088 --> 01:34:30,050
Time to launch: 15 minutes.

619
01:34:52,656 --> 01:34:56,243
- Chuck!
- Remember that bar at Point Reyes?

620
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:01,165
I guess you'll never see it again.

621
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:13,302
We all die alone, Joe.

622
01:35:54,051 --> 01:35:57,554
Like the new look, Commander?

623
01:35:57,721 --> 01:36:01,391
What do you think?
Is this me, or what?

624
01:36:01,558 --> 01:36:04,895
I liked the other face better.

625
01:36:05,062 --> 01:36:09,316
Do you know who I got it from?
Marshall Richard Cooper.

626
01:36:09,483 --> 01:36:14,488
Name ring a bell?
Do you know how we got it off him?

627
01:36:14,655 --> 01:36:18,325
Just like your buddy Chuck,
we ripped it off.

628
01:36:18,492 --> 01:36:22,746
He was screaming
something about God and Jesus.

629
01:36:35,676 --> 01:36:39,346
You're in the wrong place.

630
01:36:39,513 --> 01:36:43,851
I took his face.
He didn't have much use for it.

631
01:36:44,017 --> 01:36:46,645
But I like your face better.

632
01:36:48,188 --> 01:36:53,902
"She couldn't take it. She married
and moved on, and I'm still here."

633
01:36:58,448 --> 01:37:02,536
Obstruction cleared.
Prelaunch proceeding.

634
01:37:02,703 --> 01:37:07,291
Down to hell,
and say that I sent you.

635
01:37:07,457 --> 01:37:12,713
"I came into the world
with my legs forward..."

636
01:37:58,967 --> 01:38:02,971
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Let's go.

637
01:38:07,267 --> 01:38:10,437
- Prelaunch sequence complete.
- Joe...

638
01:38:14,441 --> 01:38:17,736
- Damn.
- One seat. One life support system.

639
01:38:21,156 --> 01:38:26,954
Get in. We've got eight minutes
for you to get out of here.

640
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:32,417
- You know how to fly it.
- It'll fly by itself.

641
01:38:33,085 --> 01:38:35,295
Shit!

642
01:38:38,090 --> 01:38:43,595
I'll flip you for it.
Call it. Heads or sphinx.

643
01:38:43,762 --> 01:38:49,852
Rome, Egypt.
I'll flip it. You call it.

644
01:38:50,018 --> 01:38:53,313
All right, Cleopatra, I'll call it.
Rome.

645
01:38:57,568 --> 01:39:01,655
It doesn't matter. You're going.

646
01:39:01,822 --> 01:39:05,242
Now, go.

647
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:16,670
I can't...

648
01:39:16,837 --> 01:39:20,966
Pardon me, gentlemen,
would you mind taking that outside?

649
01:39:21,133 --> 01:39:24,261
Stray bullets
are bad for the inventory.

650
01:39:24,428 --> 01:39:27,890
Jessica Hansen, Pittsburgh.
How do you do?

651
01:39:30,184 --> 01:39:33,479
We can smile, we can cry,
we can bleed.

652
01:39:33,645 --> 01:39:36,398
We can fuck.

653
01:39:39,026 --> 01:39:42,863
I wanted to tell you. I did.

654
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:59,379
Not so fast.

655
01:40:53,725 --> 01:40:56,270
Two minutes to launch.

656
01:41:04,903 --> 01:41:08,115
Hey, bitch!

657
01:41:36,476 --> 01:41:39,855
Prelaunch burn complete.
90 seconds to launch.

658
01:41:56,622 --> 01:42:01,668
I didn't want to...

659
01:42:01,835 --> 01:42:08,008
...go back with you. I was afraid.

660
01:42:08,175 --> 01:42:15,724
I know. You were afraid
of what you would do.

661
01:42:19,853 --> 01:42:23,857
You're coming up in the world.

662
01:42:24,024 --> 01:42:27,528
You've learned
how to kill each other now.

663
01:42:30,072 --> 01:42:38,872
I learned something else, too.
I learned to...

664
01:42:40,749 --> 01:42:43,710
...love.

665
01:42:54,555 --> 01:42:58,225
30 seconds to launch.

666
01:43:13,907 --> 01:43:18,954
This is Joseph Hendricksson
aboard EEVT 3. Over.

667
01:43:19,121 --> 01:43:21,707
Alliance San Francisco. Over.

668
01:43:21,874 --> 01:43:26,837
On a prelaunch, requesting
emergency clearance for Earth.

669
01:43:27,004 --> 01:43:31,091
Cleared for Earth. Over.

670
