1
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:06,548
I think we can begin.

2
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:09,430
The first parole request
for Carter "Doc" McCoy.

3
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:10,914
Is legal counsel present?

4
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:13,986
Yes, sir. I'm Eugene Stewart,
representing Mr. McCoy.

5
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:23,031
"Carter McCoy, one to ten year sentence
for armed robbery.

6
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:26,024
"First offense in the state of Texas.

7
00:01:26,715 --> 00:01:29,149
"Wanted by the state of Ohio
for assault with a deadly weapon...

8
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:30,349
"...and armed robbery. "

9
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:33,507
The State of Ohio has waived jurisdiction,
Mr. Chairman.

10
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,513
Mr. McCoy is no longer wanted
in that case.

11
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:41,503
Good luck, man.

12
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,787
Mr. McCoy has served
four years of his sentence.

13
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,546
His record's satisfactory.

14
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:48,992
Applied for parole
on September fifth of this year.

15
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,150
Remarks?

16
00:01:52,234 --> 00:01:54,703
I would only, once again,
like to point out to the committee...

17
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:57,263
...Mr. McCoy's good behavior
while a prisoner.

18
00:01:57,355 --> 00:01:59,391
-Notice is taken.
-Thank you, sir.

19
00:01:59,474 --> 00:02:01,942
The board met
in closed chambers last week.

20
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,909
Have you reached a decision regarding
Mr. McCoy's request for parole?

21
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:07,872
Request for parole is denied.

22
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:11,306
The prisoner may re-apply
after one calendar year.

23
00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:30,188
Lock 'em up.

24
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:23,113
Open the gate.

25
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:39,629
Lance said to have eight hole,
Gallo one, Kirksky two.

26
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:41,754
Eight hole colored.

27
00:04:42,235 --> 00:04:45,704
Go down to the garden house,
turn to your left, go to the woods.

28
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,947
We're going on to the brush. Burn it.
Take the stumps up out of the ground.

29
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:53,226
Bob Field, get them dogs out there
close to the trailer.

30
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:12,949
One hole.

31
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:22,829
Eight hole.

32
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:31,944
Thirty.

33
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:33,389
Thirty.

34
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,824
Come on.

35
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:38,511
-Fifteen.
-Fifteen.

36
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:44,182
Get them dogs in close to 'em, Bob Field.

37
00:06:07,954 --> 00:06:09,387
-Thirty.
-Thirty.

38
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:17,144
Hogfield, you go to the left
and start rounding up on that brush pile.

39
00:06:17,235 --> 00:06:18,384
Time to go.

40
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,105
Put it back. Catch them, this squad.

41
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:25,788
Round this pile up and get it burning.

42
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:31,151
Oh, man, that's just a game.

43
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:36,185
Man, get on this stump.

44
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:39,112
Look out, McCoy.

45
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:42,274
Get your axe and come on up here
and pitch in.

46
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:46,786
Go to work. Go to work.

47
00:06:52,714 --> 00:06:55,149
De Leon, get the fire going.

48
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:58,026
That Mexican there...

49
00:06:58,154 --> 00:07:01,112
Get up all this little stuff
and put it on this pile.

50
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:05,144
Thirty.

51
00:07:05,394 --> 00:07:06,509
Eight hole.

52
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:09,394
Catch that brush pile here
and get it rounded up.

53
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:13,588
I want it tight to where it'll burn.
Get these stumps down under the ground.

54
00:07:16,355 --> 00:07:17,504
Bob Field...

55
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,432
...round up that pile.

56
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:22,307
Get it to burn.
Kirk Shaw, over on the ground...

57
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:30,747
Keep that line straight.

58
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:35,713
Keep that line tight.

59
00:08:27,954 --> 00:08:29,149
Hello, Doc.

60
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:39,744
I'm sorry.

61
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,102
Get to Beynon.

62
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:47,504
Tell him I'm for sale. His price.

63
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:52,104
Do it now.

64
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:06,192
Hello, Mrs. McCoy.

65
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:08,751
I'd like to see Jack Beynon.

66
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:14,344
Go ahead.

67
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:20,508
Class. Is she a regular?

68
00:09:20,595 --> 00:09:22,664
No. Doc McCoy's old lady.

69
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:24,626
Jeez, is that Carol Ainsley?

70
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:25,989
Shut up!

71
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:30,986
How are you, Mrs. McCoy?

72
00:09:32,754 --> 00:09:35,222
Ready to talk about my husband,
Mr. Beynon.

73
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:39,153
Please sit down.

74
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:45,791
So the good doctor comes up again.

75
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:50,785
He asked me to come and see you.

76
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:53,269
Why?

77
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:56,350
Can I help?

78
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:00,513
Yes, I think you can.

79
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:06,827
How about a drink?

80
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,513
Yeah, I could use one.

81
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:11,708
Come on over.

82
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:35,073
You'll be back, Doc.

83
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:14,953
Mr. Beynon will see you
the day after tomorrow.

84
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,311
12:30 at the River Walk.

85
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:08,947
-Hi, Doc.
-Hi.

86
00:12:11,154 --> 00:12:12,190
Feel okay?

87
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:15,427
I'm a lot better off now
than I was an hour ago.

88
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:20,907
-You want to drive?
-My driver's license has expired.

89
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:27,753
Sorry I'm late. I was having my hair done,
the girl was slow.

90
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:29,062
You look fine.

91
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:32,793
-You feel good?
-Yeah.

92
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:37,590
-Where do you want to go?
-Take a walk.

93
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,706
What do you want for dinner?

94
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:12,985
Drinks. Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey...

95
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:57,543
You okay?

96
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:00,062
Pretty good.

97
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:03,303
Made a trip to Oregon
to see my brother and his kids.

98
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:05,225
I figured it'd be
the last time I'd see them...

99
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:07,350
...unless they decide to travel.

100
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,908
How's Estelle?

101
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:10,350
Fatter.

102
00:16:12,315 --> 00:16:14,384
You know, some things never change.

103
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:17,467
Yeah, that's right.

104
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:21,307
That's not all of it.

105
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:25,153
It's been a long time, Doc.

106
00:16:26,514 --> 00:16:27,994
Did you go out much?

107
00:16:29,674 --> 00:16:32,109
Four years, and now
the question comes up.

108
00:16:42,195 --> 00:16:44,025
I couldn't handle it inside.

109
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:45,629
But I can now.

110
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,354
I'm still here, Doc.

111
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:25,785
It does something to you, you know.

112
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:28,752
It does something to you.

113
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:33,865
It does something to you in there.

114
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:46,104
We've got time, Doc.
We've got lots of time.

115
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:48,026
Just give me a minute, baby.

116
00:18:49,075 --> 00:18:51,384
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.

117
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:54,710
Really?

118
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:56,108
Really.

119
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,585
Let me make you feel good, Doctor.

120
00:19:12,755 --> 00:19:14,507
It's been so long.

121
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:17,909
So long.

122
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:40,104
Fantastic.

123
00:19:45,474 --> 00:19:46,669
She's here.

124
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:52,553
Hey, I was gonna fix you breakfast.

125
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:53,953
You were sleeping.

126
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:55,387
A little ketchup.

127
00:20:00,194 --> 00:20:02,026
And then we have a little...

128
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:11,230
Thank you.

129
00:20:13,474 --> 00:20:15,385
-For what?
-For getting me out.

130
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:19,193
It was a pleasure.

131
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:30,513
Thank you, ma'am.

132
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:37,303
Hey, Claude. Here's your boy.

133
00:20:47,474 --> 00:20:48,907
You have to be kidding.

134
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:52,112
Not at all.
Just a pleasant way to have lunch.

135
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:53,743
Sit down.

136
00:20:56,474 --> 00:20:58,784
It's good to see you
in them civilian clothes.

137
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,911
It just takes a long arm, Beynon.

138
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:05,712
You know, it's hard to say
how those things happen.

139
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:09,866
The parole board almost never
changes their decision.

140
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,263
It must be because I'm a model prisoner.

141
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:18,034
This is the only time
you and I meet in public.

142
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:20,747
Any business with me...

143
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:22,987
...you handle it with him.

144
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,554
He's my brother.

145
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,786
Back with your own people, now.

146
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,832
I got you some professionals.

147
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,185
I'll get my own men, Beynon.

148
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,394
You run the job, but I run the show.

149
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:39,268
And don't forget it.

150
00:21:44,755 --> 00:21:46,825
You've got two weeks to set it up.

151
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:51,794
It's not a big bank, but it handles
the cash deposits for an oil company.

152
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:54,586
Over half a million dollars.

153
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,147
It's a family bank.

154
00:21:57,755 --> 00:21:59,074
The brother of the bank director...

155
00:21:59,154 --> 00:22:02,510
...is on the board of directors
at Con-Sol Oil in Beacon City.

156
00:22:09,914 --> 00:22:12,587
Here's a couple of fellas
I'd like you to meet.

157
00:22:13,714 --> 00:22:15,467
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson.

158
00:22:21,555 --> 00:22:23,192
Yeah, I've heard of you.

159
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,788
You work with Miller?

160
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:27,073
You're out of touch, Doc.

161
00:22:27,515 --> 00:22:29,028
Miller got blown up.

162
00:22:32,275 --> 00:22:33,263
Where?

163
00:22:34,035 --> 00:22:35,354
Fort Lauderdale.

164
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,992
-Were you with him?
-Yeah.

165
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:41,064
I got out.

166
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,630
You?

167
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:46,464
I was backup man on a payroll job.

168
00:22:47,994 --> 00:22:49,666
I'd hit some liquor stores. I drive good.

169
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:50,824
I drive.

170
00:22:52,355 --> 00:22:53,628
Sure.

171
00:22:55,315 --> 00:22:57,589
I want Mexican visas and passports.

172
00:22:58,115 --> 00:22:59,627
They'll be ready.

173
00:23:00,434 --> 00:23:02,106
You boys just do your job.

174
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:10,910
Carol.

175
00:23:12,234 --> 00:23:13,634
Bank guard, 7:59.

176
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:15,144
He's early.

177
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,663
You got a flashlight, some light batteries.

178
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:28,914
A-hooks, pliers, wire cutters...

179
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:35,944
What do you want all this stuff for?

180
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:38,709
-I'm going on a picnic.
-Going on a picnic?

181
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:40,867
Well...okay.

182
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:50,990
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
especially you gentlemen...

183
00:23:51,315 --> 00:23:55,432
We very proudly present
the pride and joy of Beacon City.

184
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:58,626
Our own high-stepping and high-kicking...

185
00:23:58,714 --> 00:24:00,785
...Southwest Texas Ropers.

186
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:26,743
Following the strutters...
representing the Ladies' Auxiliary of...

187
00:24:26,835 --> 00:24:30,952
...the Volunteer Fire Brigade.
We have the first beautiful float...

188
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:35,386
...which consists of the Constitution
in the history of the Lone Star State.

189
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,183
Good morning.

190
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,391
I'd like an application
for a checking account, please.

191
00:24:54,474 --> 00:24:58,150
He goes here, follows down here.
Now, this is the spot you're looking for.

192
00:24:58,234 --> 00:24:59,429
Here. Yeah.

193
00:24:59,555 --> 00:25:01,671
-Can I get a copy of this?
-Yes, sir.

194
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,751
-Thanks a lot.
-You're welcome.

195
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:35,633
Change for a $50, please.

196
00:25:40,795 --> 00:25:42,625
$20, $30...

197
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:45,949
...$40, $45, $50.

198
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:49,669
Thank you.
Y'all come back and see us soon.

199
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:54,555
Set your clocks for five minutes after 9:00.

200
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,066
All right, on the nose, now.

201
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:01,949
The diversionary explosions are spaced
20 seconds apart.

202
00:26:02,035 --> 00:26:03,387
That gives you...

203
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:06,634
...one minute and 38 seconds,
before they blow.

204
00:26:09,714 --> 00:26:12,626
You've got a bank president,
you have three tellers.

205
00:26:14,035 --> 00:26:15,513
And you've got a bank guard.

206
00:26:15,595 --> 00:26:16,868
Usually on the right as you come in.

207
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:18,387
Pin him right away.

208
00:26:18,515 --> 00:26:21,188
Careful he doesn't panic,
and go shoot somebody.

209
00:26:22,595 --> 00:26:25,472
You got one local police car.
Now he's a rover.

210
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:28,987
Shouldn't be anywhere near the vicinity
when we make our hit.

211
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:31,066
Traffic is usually light at that hour.

212
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:34,271
There are three exits. One at Hopkins,
one at Guadalupe Street...

213
00:26:34,355 --> 00:26:35,946
...and then there's the alley.

214
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:38,469
Will you put that away and pay attention!

215
00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:43,826
Now the guard carries a .38.

216
00:26:45,835 --> 00:26:48,712
The cops carry 357-magnums.

217
00:26:52,234 --> 00:26:53,792
You know what this is.

218
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,628
This'll stop an M-2 army rifle at 50 yards.

219
00:27:00,674 --> 00:27:03,064
I've been working ten years without one.

220
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:07,266
-Suit yourself.
-Thank you.

221
00:27:07,954 --> 00:27:09,148
What about the vault?

222
00:27:09,234 --> 00:27:10,429
It's a Chambers Reilly.

223
00:27:10,515 --> 00:27:13,472
It's on a time lock.
Opens up 20 minutes before office hours.

224
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:14,431
Wire pull over?

225
00:27:14,515 --> 00:27:17,268
No, one-inch stuff
on a three number combination.

226
00:27:17,394 --> 00:27:18,509
That's me.

227
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:22,270
No, no. I'll handle the fine stuff.
You're backup all the way.

228
00:27:23,634 --> 00:27:25,386
Whatever you need, brother.

229
00:27:26,154 --> 00:27:27,223
Right.

230
00:27:30,035 --> 00:27:33,152
You keep going over this.
I don't want anybody lost.

231
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:36,429
If we're clean,
Gollie will take us across at Laredo.

232
00:27:36,515 --> 00:27:39,507
If we're hot, we'll have to try Laughlin's
in El Paso.

233
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,865
Aren't we going a little bit hard?

234
00:27:51,394 --> 00:27:53,113
That's a walk-in bank, man.

235
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:54,989
A piece of cake.

236
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,634
You don't have to be Dillinger for that one.

237
00:28:05,954 --> 00:28:06,910
Bang.

238
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:18,907
Dillinger got killed.

239
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:23,314
Not in the bank.

240
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:28,513
Take it with you.

241
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:49,703
Expenses.

242
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:58,944
Tell Beynon I don't want any mix-ups.
I make one phone call.

243
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:02,548
And his people better be there.
All of them.

244
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:05,864
I understand.

245
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:07,148
Beynon's to be alone at the drop.

246
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:10,113
Only one car in the garage
at the ranch and that's it.

247
00:29:10,194 --> 00:29:11,627
Now, I'm not gonna have the money.

248
00:29:11,714 --> 00:29:15,469
And she's not gonna know where it is
until I know I'm clear. Got it?

249
00:29:16,315 --> 00:29:18,067
-He understands.
-Good, good.

250
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:20,349
Make sure everybody does. Okay?

251
00:30:12,115 --> 00:30:14,026
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

252
00:30:16,555 --> 00:30:18,385
Good morning.

253
00:30:19,315 --> 00:30:20,463
Good morning.

254
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:29,784
Good morning.

255
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,223
Good morning, Mr. Morgan. How are you?

256
00:30:35,315 --> 00:30:36,588
Fine, thank you.

257
00:31:43,555 --> 00:31:44,544
Hold it.

258
00:32:06,194 --> 00:32:07,513
Come on, move it!

259
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:43,630
Relax.

260
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:02,183
Superior technology, my ass.

261
00:33:13,914 --> 00:33:15,233
Hands up!

262
00:33:22,275 --> 00:33:23,913
Mr. President? Up!

263
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,426
Everybody, out this way.

264
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:39,471
Come on, come on! Hurry it up! Move it!

265
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:43,190
Go!

266
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:50,507
Come on, move it!

267
00:33:54,714 --> 00:33:56,386
Come on, honey, get on it.

268
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:15,391
Now just relax.

269
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:17,228
Face down!

270
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,791
Move it. Move it, honey.

271
00:34:38,074 --> 00:34:40,269
They're on their way. Just relax.

272
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:43,467
Everybody relax.

273
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:34,228
Ninety seconds.

274
00:35:59,155 --> 00:36:00,110
Seventy-five.

275
00:36:05,155 --> 00:36:06,269
Sixty-five.

276
00:36:09,514 --> 00:36:10,742
Fifty, brother.

277
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:23,471
No!

278
00:36:23,795 --> 00:36:24,670
No!

279
00:36:32,914 --> 00:36:34,143
Stupid bastard!

280
00:36:53,114 --> 00:36:54,342
Take the wheel.

281
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,023
Take the wheel.

282
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:25,184
How did it go?

283
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:27,425
Bad. Jackson killed the guard.

284
00:37:34,315 --> 00:37:36,829
Fourteen seconds till the next one goes off.

285
00:37:38,914 --> 00:37:40,826
Come on, come on.

286
00:38:33,635 --> 00:38:34,670
Shit.

287
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:08,228
Where's Jackson?

288
00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:11,074
He didn't make it.

289
00:40:11,554 --> 00:40:12,907
Neither did you.

290
00:41:58,114 --> 00:42:00,675
...was held up this morning
shortly after opening.

291
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:04,987
The bank officials state that $7 50,000
was taken by three masked men...

292
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:06,304
...who forced the employees...

293
00:42:06,394 --> 00:42:08,351
Hey, there's only $500,000 here.

294
00:42:08,434 --> 00:42:10,311
-You sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.

295
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:14,344
Doc?

296
00:42:14,994 --> 00:42:16,871
I see it. Take it easy.

297
00:42:17,074 --> 00:42:19,429
They're looking for three men, remember?

298
00:42:33,675 --> 00:42:35,949
What seems to be the problem, Officer?

299
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:41,943
Okay, drive on.

300
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:14,349
I'll kill him.

301
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:17,387
I'll kill that mother!

302
00:43:24,914 --> 00:43:25,949
He's on.

303
00:43:27,514 --> 00:43:28,583
I'm here.

304
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:31,190
Yeah?

305
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:33,585
Yeah?

306
00:43:35,235 --> 00:43:36,269
I'm here.

307
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:52,393
They checked in.

308
00:44:05,155 --> 00:44:06,873
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.

309
00:44:06,954 --> 00:44:08,547
I've never been there.

310
00:44:09,554 --> 00:44:11,590
When we met, it was at his office.

311
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:18,474
Do you trust him?

312
00:44:19,474 --> 00:44:21,625
I don't figure he's gonna try to cross us.

313
00:44:21,715 --> 00:44:23,945
At least not until he gets his money.

314
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:27,186
Well, let's just send his cut back
and just get going.

315
00:44:29,715 --> 00:44:32,103
If we make a mistake, he's gonna burn us.

316
00:44:32,474 --> 00:44:35,068
You make a deal,
you're better off keeping up your end.

317
00:44:35,155 --> 00:44:36,873
I don't want to go there.

318
00:44:38,835 --> 00:44:40,268
Let's do it my way.

319
00:45:17,554 --> 00:45:18,590
Stay here.

320
00:45:20,474 --> 00:45:22,545
I'll wrap it up as quick as I can.

321
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:06,425
News said two people killed.

322
00:46:06,594 --> 00:46:08,903
Three. Rudy got ambitious.

323
00:46:09,355 --> 00:46:10,708
And you got him.

324
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:12,983
That's right.

325
00:46:13,074 --> 00:46:14,666
What about your wife?

326
00:46:15,474 --> 00:46:16,668
Let's cut up the money, Beynon.

327
00:46:16,755 --> 00:46:18,268
I want to get north.

328
00:46:19,594 --> 00:46:21,744
She told me no one would get killed.

329
00:46:31,434 --> 00:46:33,027
I'm in a hurry, Beynon.

330
00:46:33,235 --> 00:46:35,623
You still don't get the picture, do you?

331
00:46:36,434 --> 00:46:39,472
And I've always heard
what a smart-ass operator you was.

332
00:46:39,795 --> 00:46:40,989
No applause.

333
00:46:43,795 --> 00:46:45,626
Let's examine the situation.

334
00:46:47,235 --> 00:46:49,987
One. An extremely attractive woman.

335
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:58,831
And there's the woman's husband.

336
00:46:58,914 --> 00:47:01,382
And there's a man with political influence.

337
00:47:02,034 --> 00:47:04,867
A man who can easily get a parole
for a convict.

338
00:47:05,994 --> 00:47:07,313
Why should he?

339
00:47:07,675 --> 00:47:09,188
A simple reason, McCoy.

340
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:10,833
Let's get down to it.

341
00:47:11,034 --> 00:47:13,230
Radio's rapping about $750,000.

342
00:47:13,954 --> 00:47:15,911
There's a half a million, here.

343
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:19,945
A little more was taken out before.

344
00:47:20,675 --> 00:47:23,393
You see, my brother's
the director of that bank.

345
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:26,068
We had a few problems we had to iron out.

346
00:47:28,994 --> 00:47:30,871
Okay. We covered you...

347
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,351
Yeah.

348
00:47:33,715 --> 00:47:35,228
You surely did, Doc.

349
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:44,907
My old lady must've made you
a lot of promises.

350
00:47:45,914 --> 00:47:46,903
Close.

351
00:47:47,434 --> 00:47:48,788
I wouldn't feel...

352
00:49:57,474 --> 00:49:58,429
Stupid!

353
00:49:59,554 --> 00:50:01,385
Why didn't you tell me, huh?

354
00:50:01,554 --> 00:50:03,112
Why didn't you tell me?

355
00:50:03,195 --> 00:50:05,389
There wasn't any way to explain it.

356
00:50:11,355 --> 00:50:13,231
You sent me to him, you know.

357
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,431
What the hell do you want anyway?

358
00:50:45,074 --> 00:50:46,268
Goddamn you!

359
00:51:07,994 --> 00:51:09,268
Still no answer.

360
00:51:09,755 --> 00:51:11,108
Something's wrong.

361
00:51:12,795 --> 00:51:15,150
Come on! Come on!

362
00:51:20,434 --> 00:51:21,833
What's the damage?

363
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:26,423
Your collarbone's broken
but it's not shattered.

364
00:51:26,514 --> 00:51:28,233
There's no infection, yet.

365
00:51:28,554 --> 00:51:31,148
Those bandages ought
to be changed twice a day.

366
00:51:32,114 --> 00:51:33,264
It's okay.

367
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:35,592
I got a nurse in mind.

368
00:51:38,635 --> 00:51:41,148
The three of us are gonna
do some traveling.

369
00:51:43,514 --> 00:51:45,710
We're gonna take your car to El Paso.

370
00:51:46,795 --> 00:51:48,751
We...we can't leave here.

371
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,827
That's not possible.
I mean, we have all of this.

372
00:51:57,635 --> 00:51:59,590
Is that possible, Mrs. Clinton?

373
00:52:01,755 --> 00:52:03,552
Just tell us what you want.

374
00:52:10,114 --> 00:52:11,833
What kind of a car do you drive?

375
00:52:11,914 --> 00:52:13,586
A Ford. We have a Ford.

376
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:19,789
That's good.

377
00:52:22,034 --> 00:52:23,706
That's very good, Harold.

378
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,625
You run on out and gas up the Ford.

379
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:30,753
If anybody but you comes back, Harold...

380
00:52:32,195 --> 00:52:34,150
...she gets her clock stopped.

381
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:40,831
You do what he says, Harold.

382
00:52:41,795 --> 00:52:43,148
Just do as I say.

383
00:53:00,315 --> 00:53:02,465
You. Get a cloth.

384
00:53:03,474 --> 00:53:04,987
You're gonna wash me.

385
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:13,231
They still may be on the way to Laredo.

386
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:16,034
What about El Paso?
He's a friend of Laughlin.

387
00:53:16,635 --> 00:53:17,862
Well, we have to cover them both.

388
00:53:17,954 --> 00:53:19,945
We've got to get somebody down there.
Either Rudy or...

389
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:22,309
...McCoy's got a half a million bucks.

390
00:53:22,554 --> 00:53:24,670
-Put out the word.
-What about Jack?

391
00:53:26,434 --> 00:53:28,824
Just dump him down a dry well,
if you can find one.

392
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,951
No, he ought to be buried proper.

393
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:34,106
You just do what I tell you.

394
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:38,268
Thank you, ma'am.

395
00:53:42,155 --> 00:53:43,634
Wendy, sit down.

396
00:53:45,434 --> 00:53:47,471
Two day-coach tickets to El Paso.

397
00:53:52,755 --> 00:53:55,952
Leaves in 45 minutes. Gate three.
Thank you, ma'am.

398
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:56,913
Kind of tricky, isn't it?

399
00:55:02,835 --> 00:55:04,552
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

400
00:55:18,635 --> 00:55:19,909
Come over here.

401
00:55:35,914 --> 00:55:38,349
You don't always have to
take your gun out.

402
00:55:41,034 --> 00:55:42,786
I'll do anything you want.

403
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,063
Really.

404
00:55:45,715 --> 00:55:46,704
I will.

405
00:55:52,034 --> 00:55:53,865
Get rid of that nail polish.

406
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:56,271
Okay.

407
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:57,907
I don't like it.

408
00:56:10,155 --> 00:56:11,793
And get rid of that, too.

409
00:56:12,594 --> 00:56:13,744
What is that?

410
00:56:36,514 --> 00:56:38,949
Don't get any blood on me. I hate blood.

411
00:56:47,994 --> 00:56:50,827
Say, you wouldn't happen to be
a Mormon, would you?

412
00:56:52,315 --> 00:56:53,748
No, I'm afraid not.

413
00:56:53,835 --> 00:56:54,903
I'd like another one.

414
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,222
Me, neither.

415
00:56:56,755 --> 00:56:59,315
I'm from Orem. That's right near Salt Lake.

416
00:57:00,114 --> 00:57:04,266
There's about 12 people in the state who
aren't Mormons, and I'm one of them.

417
00:57:06,835 --> 00:57:09,143
I guess that makes you kind of special.

418
00:57:09,954 --> 00:57:12,422
-Yeah, I guess it does.
-Thank you.

419
00:57:13,235 --> 00:57:14,384
Hey, baby.

420
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:19,309
You wouldn't be taking the train
to Salt Lake, would you?

421
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,873
No, I'm afraid not!

422
00:57:21,195 --> 00:57:22,514
That's just my luck.

423
00:57:22,594 --> 00:57:24,347
Listen, I hope you have a really nice trip.

424
00:57:24,434 --> 00:57:26,585
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.

425
00:57:30,034 --> 00:57:31,228
Where's the bag?

426
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:33,112
It's in the locker. I've got the key.

427
00:58:10,355 --> 00:58:11,309
A man helped me open it.

428
00:58:11,394 --> 00:58:12,668
How long ago?

429
00:58:13,394 --> 00:58:14,873
Fifteen minutes ago.

430
00:58:19,795 --> 00:58:23,309
It's the oldest con game in the world.
He switched keys with you.

431
00:58:28,114 --> 00:58:30,947
He'll figure you for more time.
He's probably still in the station.

432
00:58:31,034 --> 00:58:32,103
Find him.

433
00:58:33,103 --> 00:58:43,103
