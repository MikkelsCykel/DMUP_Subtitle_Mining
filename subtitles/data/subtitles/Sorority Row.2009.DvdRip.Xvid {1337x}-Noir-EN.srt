1
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:47,699
Danny, give me my shirt!

2
00:00:47,867 --> 00:00:49,698
Come and get it.

3
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:22,580
Don't you think that maybe we're taking
this hazing thing a little bit too far?

4
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:24,226
I absolutely do not.

5
00:01:25,547 --> 00:01:26,616
Hey!

6
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:29,096
Cassidy!

7
00:01:46,027 --> 00:01:48,541
- Hey, give me a beer. Come on, man.
- Get your own, pretty boy.

8
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:50,140
- Don't be a dick.
- Get your own.

9
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:53,424
Hey, move it, douche bag. Get out of here.

10
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:56,104
Mmm. Sudsy!

11
00:01:57,187 --> 00:02:00,338
Hey, Chugs! Give me a beer! And a BJ.

12
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:16,301
Hey, what the fuck?

13
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:51,620
Hey, no! You both, out! Now!

14
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:54,819
Some massive titties!

15
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:04,142
How long have you been a Theta?

16
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:06,025
- Do you want one?
- No, thanks.

17
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:11,346
- Hey, Ellie, up here.
- I got to go. Sorry.

18
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:13,499
It wasn't that hard a question.

19
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:20,701
Asshole!

20
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,867
- Where are we going, Claire?
- Hurry up. Jessica's waiting.

21
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:33,742
Goodbye, virginity! Yeah! Theta Pi rules!

22
00:03:35,107 --> 00:03:37,985
I think I'm gonna be sick. Look out below!

23
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,146
Heather, get a room.

24
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,583
Hey, boys. Out, out, out!

25
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:50,697
- I just got tested. It's cool.
- Okay.

26
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:54,305
Cassidy, my room, Theta toast, now.

27
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,106
- Have you seen Andy?
- Hos before bros.

28
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:59,498
Uh, Claire, line up those shots!

29
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:02,056
None of that Jell-O crap.
Mama needs to get her buzz on.

30
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:03,342
Thetas!

31
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:05,498
This party kicks off our senior year.

32
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:10,780
But first, shout outs. Claire,
I like being your friend, because

33
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,266
it makes me multi-cultural
without having to do anything.

34
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:18,460
- That's so racist.
- Okay. Okay.

35
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,786
Chugs, I love you, because
you're always willing to try anything new

36
00:04:21,947 --> 00:04:23,983
and you don't give a damn
what anyone thinks.

37
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:26,422
Is this a bad time to tell you
I boned your dad?

38
00:04:28,187 --> 00:04:29,256
Gross.

39
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:31,225
It was after the divorce.

40
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:36,063
Ellie, I love you because you are
always there to help with homework.

41
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:37,979
You're like a spell check with a nice rack.

42
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:43,782
Okay, Cass, I love you
because you're so real.

43
00:04:43,947 --> 00:04:46,142
That's just because
she can't afford fake ones.

44
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:50,823
I love you, Jessica,
because you make being a bitch an art form.

45
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:52,862
Hear, hear!

46
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:56,982
Theta Pi, we honor thee!
From life to death, sorority!

47
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,062
Wait, wait, wait, where's Megan?
She should be here for this.

48
00:05:03,227 --> 00:05:05,343
Oh, I forgot.

49
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:08,904
Let me show you something
that is sure to be a YouTube classic.

50
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:12,383
Gather round, ladies.
Chugs, grab the laptop.

51
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:13,866
What are you guys up to?

52
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,905
<i>- Baby, I love you so much.
- Oh, my God.</i>

53
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,261
Is that Garret?

54
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:21,497
I thought Megan dumped him
after he cheated on her.

55
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:24,500
Well, apparently, she took him back.

56
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,976
- What can I say? My brother's good in bed.
- Chugs.

57
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:28,739
- That's so gross.
- You guys are sick.

58
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:30,579
Did Megan get a little work done
over the summer?

59
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,136
What? You thought she gained
four bra sizes in three months?

60
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:35,659
God, is this all he's got?

61
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:38,057
Yeah, what is this?
The Dry Hump Olympics?

62
00:05:41,627 --> 00:05:44,141
- Come on, guys, this is gross.
- Oh, my God.

63
00:05:44,587 --> 00:05:45,542
Why isn't she moving?

64
00:05:45,707 --> 00:05:47,698
We gave Garret a little something
to put into her drink.

65
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:49,095
Told him it'd help put her in the mood.

66
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,258
You let your brother give her roofies?

67
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:52,746
Come on, roofie sex isn't that bad.

68
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:54,625
You get laid
and you get a good night's sleep.

69
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:57,300
- It's true.
- Chugs.

70
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:00,065
Finally, we're getting somewhere.

71
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:05,460
- Ooh! Looks like he's kissing a corpse.
- Exactly. This is the best prank ever.

72
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,137
Oh, my God.

73
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:17,138
<i>- Oh, my God. Megan. Jesus Christ.
- Guys, what the hell?</i>

74
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:18,706
<i>- Baby?
- Holy shit, you guys.</i>

75
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:21,586
<i>- We got to do something.
- Baby, are you okay? Jesus Christ.</i>

76
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:23,146
- Jesus!
- Let's go!

77
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:24,456
My God.

78
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:27,896
You guys...

79
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:30,183
She's convulsing and there's
shit coming out of her mouth.

80
00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:31,541
- What?
- Yeah, I don't...

81
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:32,856
What the fuck did you do?

82
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:34,506
I didn't do...
I slipped her the pills you gave me.

83
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:35,941
I said give her one!

84
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:36,983
- I didn't know!
- Guys!

85
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,705
- She's not breathing.
- We have to clear her airway.

86
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:39,777
Why doesn't somebody call an ambulance?

87
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:41,062
There's no time. Here.

88
00:06:41,227 --> 00:06:43,058
Give me the keys. Get me the Escalade now!

89
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:44,626
- I'm going.
- Claire! Hey!

90
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:46,186
Yep. I'm on it.

91
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:53,145
That is so hot.

92
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:54,296
Chugs!

93
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:58,776
What? No tongue?

94
00:06:58,947 --> 00:07:01,381
Easy there, Lezzie Lohan.
This is make-believe, remember?

95
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,378
- What is going on?
- She's okay?

96
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:07,142
No, I'm not okay. I have fake puke
all over my $800 silk sheets.

97
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:08,342
What exactly is happening?

98
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:10,225
- Garret cheated on me.
- Didn't you cheat on him first?

99
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:13,584
Details! That little bitch boy
cheated on a Theta.

100
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:15,897
You cheat on one Theta,
you cheat on every Theta.

101
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:19,423
Also he says, "I love you,"
like, 15 times every time we do it.

102
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:21,020
But Garret is Chugs' brother.

103
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:24,145
My brother, who slipped my Theta sister
pills he thought were roofies.

104
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:26,298
My brother who also rushed Tri Pi.

105
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:28,503
Whose motto is, "We'll try any pie."

106
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,259
That boy needs to be taught a lesson.

107
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:32,065
So if they weren't roofies,
then what were they?

108
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:33,216
Vitamin B-12.

109
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:34,740
You know that helps prevent anemia?

110
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:38,343
Too bad it doesn't prevent bulimia.
That's something Megan could actually use.

111
00:07:42,387 --> 00:07:43,661
Show time.

112
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:51,657
I can't even tell if she's breathing or not.

113
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:52,816
I think she's turning cold.

114
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:54,818
Don't say that to me!
Don't tell me that!

115
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:56,215
How far are we from the hospital?

116
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:58,617
I don't know. I think I took a wrong turn.
I'm totally freaking out.

117
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:00,584
- What!
- She's not gonna make it!

118
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,624
Oh, my God, she's dead.
She really fucking died.

119
00:08:02,787 --> 00:08:04,857
She died and it's my fault.
I'm gonna go to fucking jail!

120
00:08:06,907 --> 00:08:08,499
Hey! Watch my car!

121
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:11,181
Okay, you know what?
Everybody calm down. Garret, this is all...

122
00:08:11,347 --> 00:08:13,144
Oh, my God! She's really dead!

123
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:16,697
I need help. I need help.
Chugs, I want to call Mom right now.

124
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,542
Where are we going?

125
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,698
Garret, we're gonna take care of this. Okay?

126
00:08:30,547 --> 00:08:32,060
- I'm gonna call for help.
- No, no, no!

127
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:33,216
Hey, we all had...

128
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,345
I'm calling the fucking cops.
You guys had nothing to do with this.

129
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:38,418
Really? Who gave you the roofies?
Jessica did.

130
00:08:38,587 --> 00:08:40,339
And she died at a party
at our sorority house.

131
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:42,543
They'll close down our chapter for sure.

132
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:45,945
- Right, Ellie?
- Yeah. Any illicit drugs use on campus

133
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:47,665
is an automatic
two-year chapter suspension.

134
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,057
I don't care about that! She's dying!

135
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:56,104
- There's no signal.
- Garret, look at me.

136
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:59,657
Look at me. Look at me, all right?
Hey, you've got to look at me.

137
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:02,785
- We can make all this go away.
- How?

138
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:05,258
Trust me. I know a place.

139
00:09:06,107 --> 00:09:07,426
Okay. All right.

140
00:09:09,547 --> 00:09:10,582
Okay.

141
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:13,426
Claire, turn up here.

142
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:48,338
Get on the ground. Shh.

143
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:51,177
Garret, there's a blanket in the back. Get it.

144
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:56,265
I guess I'll get it.

145
00:10:11,107 --> 00:10:12,699
What's happening? I can't see.

146
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:14,619
Shh. You're dead, dummy.

147
00:10:15,387 --> 00:10:17,423
So the only thing to settle on is the body.

148
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:21,466
Do we wrap it in the blanket as it is,
or do we chop it into little pieces first?

149
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:25,540
Okay. Let's try not to leave our DNA
all over the place. Thank you.

150
00:10:26,387 --> 00:10:28,025
So, what's it gonna be?

151
00:10:28,187 --> 00:10:30,303
One big chunk or little bits and pieces?

152
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:33,265
In premed, we learned that if there's air
in the lungs or the chest cavity

153
00:10:33,427 --> 00:10:34,655
the body will float to the surface.

154
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:37,500
Yeah, she's right. We can't have her body
floating to the top.

155
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:38,782
Yeah. Somebody will find her.

156
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:41,222
What about those implants?
Does silicone float?

157
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,583
All right. Everybody spread out and find
sharp rocks to dismember the body with.

158
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:12,737
So how long
are you gonna keep this going?

159
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:15,425
Yeah, I mean I kind of agree
with Cass.

160
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:17,259
This is funny and all, but...

161
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:21,266
You're right. That's why we're doing it.

162
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:23,382
Because it's funny.

163
00:11:29,027 --> 00:11:29,903
Oh, my God!

164
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:32,456
- There's no air in her lungs now.
- What the hell did you do?

165
00:11:32,627 --> 00:11:36,017
There's no air in her lungs now.
There's no air in her lungs now.

166
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:39,741
- Oh, my God, what did you do?
- You mean, she wasn't dead?

167
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:41,902
Shut the fuck up!

168
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,103
Ellie! Ellie! Help me stop the bleeding.

169
00:11:44,907 --> 00:11:46,135
Start on her.

170
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,499
Oh, my God, Megan!

171
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:51,702
Oh, my God!

172
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:53,186
Oh, my God!

173
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,019
Somebody call 911.

174
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:04,942
God!

175
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:09,899
I don't have any reception!

176
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:11,615
Anyone?

177
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,546
We can't move her!

178
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:17,661
Come on, Megan!

179
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:38,456
Somebody get in the car
and drive until you get a signal.

180
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:40,140
Wait, no. Wait, you guys.

181
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:42,143
She's dead.

182
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:44,457
- No, no, no.
- Cassidy, look at her. She's dead.

183
00:12:44,627 --> 00:12:46,379
She couldn't be more dead.

184
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,739
What are we gonna do?

185
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:02,783
We need to talk about this for a minute.

186
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:04,858
Do you want to put her
in the car and go back?

187
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:06,346
We could.

188
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:10,580
Maybe. But we all need to be prepared
with what comes with that.

189
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:11,862
What does that mean?

190
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:15,178
Well, maybe we should call
our parents first.

191
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:16,905
I mean, Megan's dead.

192
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:22,058
And we're all responsible,
so we're gonna need lawyers.

193
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:23,182
But Garret did it.

194
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:26,384
Yes, and Garret will be going to jail,
but we are all just as responsible.

195
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:29,698
Garret? I am not letting my little brother go
to jail for a stupid prank! No way!

196
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:31,664
What, do you want to leave Megan
out here?

197
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:32,657
Why not?

198
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:34,419
I mean, everything we said a minute ago
is still true.

199
00:13:34,587 --> 00:13:35,940
Nobody knows we're here except us.

200
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,826
- That's true.
- Oh, my God, you can't be serious.

201
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:41,296
- She's our sister.
- That's also true.

202
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:45,540
Megan was our sister. And we loved her.

203
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,904
But I also know that Megan loved us.

204
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,066
And Theta Pi.

205
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:54,057
Would she want us to go down like this?

206
00:13:54,987 --> 00:13:57,979
Throw away our lives
and destroy the people we love?

207
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:02,019
Yes, Claire. Didn't your dad have
a heart attack last year?

208
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:04,018
Enough, Jessica.
I know what you're trying to do.

209
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:05,540
What am I trying to do?

210
00:14:05,707 --> 00:14:08,460
I'm trying to make the best
out of a tragic situation.

211
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:10,140
You're the one who suggested
we just leave her out here.

212
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,775
No, I did not, and you know that!
There's right and there's wrong.

213
00:14:12,947 --> 00:14:14,938
I agree. But it's also wrong

214
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:18,986
to destroy the lives of our families
for mistakes that we have made.

215
00:14:19,147 --> 00:14:22,025
All I can see is my father's face
when he hears all this.

216
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:23,621
It'll kill him.

217
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:25,937
Jessica doesn't care about
your father, Claire.

218
00:14:26,107 --> 00:14:28,257
The only thing she cares about is herself.

219
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:31,737
Think about it. If this gets out,
Kyle's daddy won't let him be with her,

220
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:33,545
because a killer in the family
doesn't look very good

221
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,140
when you're running for Senate.

222
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,059
What about your Mr. Perfect?

223
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:38,580
You really think
Andy's gonna stay with you after this?

224
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,419
This has nothing to do with him.

225
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:43,306
This decision affects the rest of our lives!

226
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,379
All right? Every job.
Every relationship we ever have.

227
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:47,980
People will know.

228
00:14:49,107 --> 00:14:51,462
Shit! What the fuck
did you guys make me do, man?

229
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:52,980
This is fucked!

230
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,022
Maybe we should vote on it.

231
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:01,305
What? I cannot believe my ears. What
happened to the tenets of sisterhood?

232
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,378
Trust, honor, respect.

233
00:15:03,747 --> 00:15:05,339
Well, you forgot two.

234
00:15:06,627 --> 00:15:08,504
Secrecy and solidarity.

235
00:15:09,747 --> 00:15:12,261
There is a dead person here.
A girl that we murdered.

236
00:15:12,427 --> 00:15:13,576
Accidentally!

237
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:14,862
Listen to yourself. All of you.

238
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:18,064
This is not something you just sweep
under the rug or choose to forget.

239
00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:19,660
You have to live with this forever!

240
00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:21,579
I completely agree, Cassidy.

241
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:27,456
I'm just trying to figure out
how we're going to live with it.

242
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:35,380
I can't help but think

243
00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:38,505
what I would want if I were lying
where Megan is now.

244
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:41,823
I could tell you what I wouldn't want.

245
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,942
I wouldn't want you guys
to throw away your lives

246
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:48,224
over something that cannot be changed.

247
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:53,377
Because that's how much I love
each and every one of you.

248
00:15:57,867 --> 00:15:59,095
Shall we vote?

249
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:02,179
Vote all you want.
Ellie and I know the truth. Right, Ellie?

250
00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:05,736
Ellie?

251
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:13,103
Look, Cass. Everything you said was right.

252
00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:18,586
You're stronger than me, okay?
And you guys aren't on scholarship.

253
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:20,936
I don't see a way out of this.

254
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:22,745
There is no way out of this.

255
00:16:22,907 --> 00:16:26,183
Well, maybe there is.

256
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:32,866
Oh, my God,
have you lost your fucking mind?

257
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,422
I'm gonna make this very easy on all of you.

258
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:44,782
Forget her. You guys, the last time
we saw Megan was at the party.

259
00:16:45,227 --> 00:16:48,299
She disappeared.
And we never saw her again.

260
00:16:49,147 --> 00:16:50,102
Okay?

261
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:53,065
If we all stick to the same story,
no one will ever know, right?

262
00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:55,183
You guys can say
whatever the hell you want to say.

263
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,302
No.

264
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:59,700
You're gonna say
what we tell you to say. Okay?

265
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,339
Are you gonna kill me, too?

266
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:06,816
Cass, we can't let you do that.

267
00:17:06,987 --> 00:17:08,136
No. Let her go. It doesn't matter.

268
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:10,457
She's gonna have to walk for three miles
before she gets any reception.

269
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:12,583
But now, later, if she tells the cops,
goodbye, life.

270
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:15,261
Come on, you guys. We have no choice.

271
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,100
Come on, help me lift her.

272
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:24,820
Come on. Come on.

273
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:57,382
Ready?

274
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:05,226
- Ready? One, two...
- Wait!

275
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:11,023
What if this is a mistake?
I mean, if we cross this line...

276
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:13,542
Look at the hole in her chest, Ellie.
The line's already been crossed.

277
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:14,776
Three.

278
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:23,183
You guys, I still can't get a signal.

279
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:28,776
Where is she?

280
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:33,421
Don't worry. At least she'll be warm, Cass.

281
00:18:33,587 --> 00:18:35,817
We wrapped her up
in your bloody jacket first.

282
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:37,815
Oh, my God.

283
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,978
And we all agreed.
We won't tell anyone what you did.

284
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:49,779
- What I did?
- How you killed Megan with the tire iron.

285
00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:53,142
We're sisters. We'll protect you.

286
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,906
You can count on us.

287
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:59,697
Trust, respect, honor,
secrecy and solidarity.

288
00:19:01,427 --> 00:19:02,416
You wouldn't.

289
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:06,421
We did. We're not gonna let this
ruin our lives, Cassidy.

290
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:08,539
And there's no reason you have to, either.

291
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:11,460
You guys, it is not that simple.
You can't do this, okay?

292
00:19:11,627 --> 00:19:13,424
Do you know what it's like
to live with a secret like this?

293
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:14,815
Of course we do.

294
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,386
We're Theta Pi.

295
00:19:17,347 --> 00:19:20,862
Now let's go wash the blood off in the lake.
And get back to the party.

296
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,304
We knew you'd come around, Cass.

297
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:40,940
Thank you, Cassidy.

298
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,375
Come on.

299
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,259
<i>As I stand
here with you today,</i>

300
00:20:09,427 --> 00:20:11,622
<i>I'm reminded of one of my favorite quotes.</i>

301
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:14,585
<i>"Reputation comes
from the company you keep. "</i>

302
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:19,426
<i>Well, thanks to you all,
the company I've kept these past four years</i>

303
00:20:19,907 --> 00:20:23,616
<i>has provided me with a reputation
I will always be proud of.</i>

304
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:25,505
<i>Congratulations, graduates.</i>

305
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:27,259
<i>Good luck. And God bless.</i>

306
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:38,218
To my sisters at Theta Pi,
not just for four years, but forever.

307
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:41,904
- Congrats, ladies.
- Ellie, you drink like a girl.

308
00:20:42,627 --> 00:20:44,583
Ooh. That went up my nose.

309
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,226
Here, Jess. Have a sip.

310
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:48,139
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

311
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,346
I'm gonna miss you guys.

312
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:58,339
This is gonna be awful.

313
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:00,017
So, let's skip it.

314
00:21:00,187 --> 00:21:02,178
We don't have to go to
some stupid luncheon.

315
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:05,180
My mother is a legacy.
She wants to see the house.

316
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,907
Think about the good side.
You live through tonight,

317
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,535
then tomorrow, we drive down
to my parents' place

318
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,698
and wake up to waves crashing
on the beach.

319
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,983
Yeah, well, if I thought
we'd be waking up in the same bed,

320
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:17,980
- maybe it would give me a thrill.
- My parents still think it's the '50s.

321
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:22,026
Mmm-hmm. Did I mention that I know
some great hotels in the area?

322
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:28,417
Hey, what happened to you
and your sisters, anyway?

323
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:31,263
You were all so close,
then after Megan disappeared...

324
00:21:31,427 --> 00:21:32,940
Could we not talk about that?

325
00:21:34,547 --> 00:21:35,741
I keep hoping you'll change your mind.

326
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:37,977
Can we please just talk about
something else?

327
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:40,458
I just want you to know I'm here for you.

328
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:57,859
I think you put this on wrong.

329
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:04,625
And you definitely put this on wrong.

330
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:10,941
Let me guess. I put these on wrong, too.

331
00:22:34,827 --> 00:22:36,180
I'm so excited.

332
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:38,945
- It's so pretty.
- Wow. Look at this place.

333
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,540
You'd almost think nice people lived here.

334
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:41,856
Hey, be nice.

335
00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:47,505
And there's the devil herself.

336
00:22:49,307 --> 00:22:52,265
Mr. and Mrs. Tappan!
I haven't seen you in forever.

337
00:22:52,427 --> 00:22:53,780
Hi, Jessica.

338
00:22:53,947 --> 00:22:57,496
Well, well, well, if it isn't the boy
who has taken our little Cassidy away.

339
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,464
She's a big girl.
She can make her own decisions.

340
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:03,415
Careful. Don't you know? Earth and fire
can't break the bonds of Theta Pi.

341
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:05,498
After all, we're sisters.

342
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:07,861
Excuse me.

343
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:10,218
So, where is everyone? Chugs?

344
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:11,696
Chugs...

345
00:23:12,427 --> 00:23:13,303
Well, you know Chugs.

346
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:16,903
She's always willing to help out
with a little freshman orientation.

347
00:23:21,587 --> 00:23:23,179
You taste like vomit.

348
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:26,420
That's because I threw up before.
But I ate a mint, so you're fine.

349
00:23:29,147 --> 00:23:31,263
Oops! I forgot to wear underwear.

350
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:35,743
And it's really cold down there.

351
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:40,178
Maybe you could warm it up for me?

352
00:23:41,907 --> 00:23:43,863
This whole thing's kind of grossing me out.

353
00:23:45,627 --> 00:23:49,063
Whatever. Move it, loser.
Not my fault you're gay.

354
00:23:52,227 --> 00:23:55,981
This has been the best four years
of our lives.

355
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:59,020
The best five years for some of us.
Not mentioning any names.

356
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,302
Becky Reed.

357
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:04,018
We have this luncheon every year

358
00:24:04,187 --> 00:24:06,985
to celebrate the long-lasting ties
of sisterhood.

359
00:24:07,427 --> 00:24:09,895
And to remember that our motto,

360
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:15,585
"Trust, respect, honor,
secrecy and solidarity,"

361
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,783
are truly words that last a lifetime.

362
00:24:17,947 --> 00:24:20,541
As you can see by looking
at the east wing of the house,

363
00:24:20,707 --> 00:24:22,584
renovations are getting underway.

364
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:26,622
So the house, like our sisterhood,
will be stronger than ever.

365
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:29,223
We have our beloved housemother to thank

366
00:24:29,387 --> 00:24:30,820
for all of her hard work
on getting this done.

367
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:32,386
Thank you, Mrs. Crenshaw.

368
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:33,696
Thank you.

369
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:49,301
However, as happy as this day is,
there's still one whom we cannot forget.

370
00:24:50,507 --> 00:24:52,418
One of our sisters is still missing.

371
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:58,057
And we hope and pray
that she will come back to us.

372
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:01,936
To Megan.

373
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,901
No frigging way.

374
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:07,615
We love and miss you always.

375
00:25:14,107 --> 00:25:17,497
Well, as you can see, some of us
are still a little overwhelmed by it all.

376
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:26,739
Okay, who up and faints anymore?

377
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:28,022
It's okay. I told them it was the heat.

378
00:25:28,187 --> 00:25:30,826
- It was Megan. I know it was her.
- It was her sister, dumbass.

379
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,057
And might I say, you played it real cool.

380
00:25:34,347 --> 00:25:38,545
Hi. I'm so sorry.
I did not mean to scare you, Ellie.

381
00:25:38,707 --> 00:25:39,822
How'd she know my name?

382
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:44,026
I'm Maggie. I met you before.
All of you. When I was 15.

383
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:47,259
Right. You're bigger. You've grown up.

384
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,856
I decided I'm coming to Rosman next year.

385
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:55,345
I think it's important for my sister.
You know, some closure.

386
00:25:55,507 --> 00:25:58,465
And I think it'd be good
for my parents, too, so...

387
00:25:58,627 --> 00:26:00,060
So, how are they doing?

388
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,263
Okay. They couldn't come today.

389
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,738
It's still way too hard.

390
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:06,860
But I didn't want to miss it.

391
00:26:07,027 --> 00:26:10,337
Anyways, I just wanted to come by
and say hello

392
00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:13,704
and let you guys know that I'm gonna be
rushing Theta Pi next year.

393
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:15,346
I'm gonna be sick.

394
00:26:17,507 --> 00:26:19,225
We'd be lucky to have you.

395
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:23,700
Um, you guys having a party tonight?

396
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:27,098
Yeah. Yeah. You know,
you should totally come.

397
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:30,942
Wait, no, you're rushing next year
and that violates Greek rules of recruiting.

398
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:33,667
Well, I won't tell if you guys won't.

399
00:26:34,987 --> 00:26:37,547
Well, we have to go.
Sorry about tonight, but I'll tell you what,

400
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:40,540
I will personally see to your future
as a Theta Pi next year.

401
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:42,296
- Okay.
- Okay.

402
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,900
- Nice to meet you guys.
- You, too.

403
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,183
Friend me on Facebook, I'll totally confirm.

404
00:26:47,187 --> 00:26:48,336
- Bye.
- Bye.

405
00:26:51,387 --> 00:26:53,582
Was it just me,
or was that girl all sorts of creepy.

406
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:54,782
Can't imagine why.

407
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,619
No way she's getting in with that outfit.

408
00:26:57,067 --> 00:26:58,739
Who is ready to party?

409
00:26:58,907 --> 00:27:00,784
That would be me.
That would be me.

410
00:27:02,507 --> 00:27:03,542
That's what I was looking for.

411
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:04,662
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

412
00:27:04,827 --> 00:27:06,624
- Hi, you.
- Hi.

413
00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:08,698
Chugs, your mom? Smoking.

414
00:27:08,867 --> 00:27:10,380
I would definitely have
a sip of that MILF-shake.

415
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:13,459
- Hey!
- If I wasn't dating you, of course, Claire.

416
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:16,300
Okay, we have two hours
before this place is packed.

417
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:18,185
I got to get to my shrink. Score some Oxys.

418
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:21,020
Hey, you think if you blow him,
you can get enough for everyone?

419
00:27:21,187 --> 00:27:22,666
- Kyle, excuse me.
- What? I'm serious.

420
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:26,297
I wish it were that painless. Unfortunately
for me, he's more of an ass man.

421
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:30,464
Okay, you guys, it's on.
Tonight we bring the house down.

422
00:27:30,627 --> 00:27:31,537
That we do.

423
00:27:31,707 --> 00:27:33,698
Kyle, can you and Mickey
go get some decorations from the cellar?

424
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:35,539
- Yeah. Let's do it.
- Yeah, we can do that.

425
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:36,981
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

426
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:39,184
- You are so whipped.
- Speak for yourself, pretty boy.

427
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:41,780
It's Ellie's.

428
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:52,625
What? Oh, my God.

429
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:54,698
- Who sent this?
- What the hell?

430
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:56,698
- Oh, my God.
- Is this a joke?

431
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:58,300
Garret! I'm gonna kill him.

432
00:27:58,467 --> 00:28:00,503
Garret? What the fuck is this, Chugs?

433
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,180
It's a joke. It's a really bad joke.

434
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,541
This is beyond sick.

435
00:28:03,707 --> 00:28:04,981
Okay. Why would Garret do this?

436
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:08,059
I can think of a reason. He's gone psycho
and he wants to kill us all.

437
00:28:08,227 --> 00:28:09,546
Hey, he's not...

438
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:14,545
Guys! Look, I know my brother.
Okay, yes, he's sort of

439
00:28:16,147 --> 00:28:19,264
lost his way, but I know him, okay? And...

440
00:28:20,027 --> 00:28:22,587
Look, he developed
this weird sense of humor

441
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:26,303
since the accident,
and this is just his way of saying...

442
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:28,856
Oh, happy graduation? That's real funny.

443
00:28:29,027 --> 00:28:30,016
What the hell are we gonna do?

444
00:28:30,187 --> 00:28:32,655
Nothing. That's why delete was invented.

445
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:34,579
- Hey, guys.
- Delete it, Claire.

446
00:28:36,227 --> 00:28:39,537
So, now all we have to do
is get rid of Crenshaw

447
00:28:39,707 --> 00:28:41,425
and get this place ready for the party.

448
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:45,378
Ellie, can you be in charge
with freshman cleaning up the place?

449
00:28:45,547 --> 00:28:47,026
If Cassidy helps me.

450
00:28:47,187 --> 00:28:48,700
I'm not...

451
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:51,700
Please don't say you're not coming.
How is that gonna look?

452
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:52,743
I don't care how it looks.

453
00:28:52,907 --> 00:28:55,137
To be honest, Jessica,
I don't really care if we get caught.

454
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:57,263
I just don't want to share a cell with you.

455
00:28:58,147 --> 00:28:59,546
Don't act all holier than thou.

456
00:28:59,707 --> 00:29:01,982
You could have gone to the cops
if you really wanted to.

457
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:22,106
- Hey.
- What you doing?

458
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:23,586
Careful what you say, I just pinned you.

459
00:29:23,747 --> 00:29:26,022
Hey, I'm just updating my Facebook.
I just wrote,

460
00:29:26,187 --> 00:29:28,906
"Andy has just graduated
and can't wait to take his girl fishing."

461
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,137
<i>I told you, I'll go to your parents,</i>

462
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:34,140
if you and your dad catch the fish,
your mom cooks the fish and I eat the fish.

463
00:29:34,307 --> 00:29:36,377
<i>- It's not that complicated.
- Lazy! God!</i>

464
00:29:36,547 --> 00:29:38,139
<i>- Hey.
- To think, I was gonna ask</i>

465
00:29:38,307 --> 00:29:40,696
if you wanted to come to Europe with me
this summer.

466
00:29:41,507 --> 00:29:42,826
Look, Andy,

467
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:46,579
there's some things
you really don't know about me.

468
00:29:46,747 --> 00:29:49,056
Hey, if it's the morning breath,
trust me, I know.

469
00:29:49,227 --> 00:29:50,865
No, I'm being serious.

470
00:29:51,027 --> 00:29:53,302
<i>I'll tell you everything tonight
on the way to your parents.</i>

471
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:55,537
And I just have one more favor.

472
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:57,743
I've kind of been sucked
into this thing at Theta.

473
00:29:57,907 --> 00:29:59,340
Would you mind coming with me
to the house

474
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,384
just for the beginning of the party,
and then we can leave?

475
00:30:02,787 --> 00:30:04,903
<i>- Yeah. Anything for you.
- You're the best.</i>

476
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:08,537
Really. You're the most wonderful thing
in my life.

477
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:12,336
And I'd do anything for you.

478
00:30:12,627 --> 00:30:15,095
Really? Well, we'll test that theory tonight.

479
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:18,906
- Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
- Cool. Bye.

480
00:30:26,227 --> 00:30:28,582
Okay, ladies,
I know the rules.

481
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:32,820
You get the house to yourself
the last night you spend in Theta Pi.

482
00:30:32,987 --> 00:30:35,296
And I trust that you will show this place

483
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:39,506
the same respect
that you've shown me the past four years.

484
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:42,019
- Of course.
- That was a joke.

485
00:30:43,547 --> 00:30:45,902
Now I know that during your time here,

486
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:48,342
I was forced to give most of you
a write-up or two.

487
00:30:48,507 --> 00:30:51,783
But trust me, for every boy
that I threw out of here,

488
00:30:51,947 --> 00:30:55,496
there were five times I knew about it
and didn't say one thing.

489
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:59,819
And sometimes there were five boys
in one night. Right, Chugs?

490
00:31:00,147 --> 00:31:02,502
I have a lot of areas that need attention.
I don't know.

491
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:03,543
- Slut!
- What are you looking at?

492
00:31:03,707 --> 00:31:07,256
Anyway, I hope, as you girls prepare
to go out into the world,

493
00:31:07,427 --> 00:31:10,624
that the things that you've learned
here in Theta Pi

494
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:14,462
will always help to guide you
to do the right thing.

495
00:31:14,627 --> 00:31:17,664
And now, to make sure
you don't forget me or each other,

496
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:19,180
a little gift.

497
00:31:21,627 --> 00:31:23,583
I'm sorry. It's really nice.

498
00:31:25,987 --> 00:31:28,421
There are 22 links in each chain.

499
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:31,385
One for every graduating Theta Pi senior.

500
00:31:31,547 --> 00:31:34,141
When you wear these bracelets,
you will always remember

501
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:37,060
just how strong the bonds
of sisterhood are.

502
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:39,582
- Thank you.
- Please!

503
00:31:39,747 --> 00:31:42,261
Okay, I'm out of here.

504
00:31:42,747 --> 00:31:45,181
- You girls behave yourselves.
- We will.

505
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:47,657
Well, screw it. That'll never happen.

506
00:31:48,387 --> 00:31:51,663
Just make sure you don't hurt yourselves
or the house. All right?

507
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,146
- No problem, Mrs. Crenshaw.
- All right.

508
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:54,660
- Thank you, Mrs. Crenshaw.
- Bye, girls!

509
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:56,499
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

510
00:31:57,507 --> 00:32:00,658
What is this? Silver-coated?
I'm never gonna wear this.

511
00:32:01,427 --> 00:32:03,145
Excuse me. Move, bitches.

512
00:32:03,307 --> 00:32:04,865
Jess, wait up. Give me a hug.

513
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:08,339
- Bye, Mrs. Crenshaw.
- Bye.

514
00:32:24,827 --> 00:32:28,217
<i>Seconds to your elevator
from the station</i>

515
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:32,057
<i>How can I resist that kind of invitation?</i>

516
00:32:32,627 --> 00:32:35,266
Come on, chicken.
One last time in the hot tub?

517
00:32:35,427 --> 00:32:40,376
You're crazy, there's people all around.
I say we just head upstairs, huh?

518
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,136
What have you got there, Claire?

519
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:45,502
I don't think the bubble bath
will be good for the jets.

520
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:52,219
No, not the boobies.

521
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:54,576
So...

522
00:32:56,547 --> 00:32:57,582
Okay.

523
00:32:58,667 --> 00:32:59,861
I'm gonna do it.

524
00:33:17,227 --> 00:33:18,580
Dr. Rosenberg?

525
00:33:23,227 --> 00:33:24,580
Anybody home?

526
00:33:32,187 --> 00:33:33,415
Hello?

527
00:33:51,587 --> 00:33:53,020
Dr. Rosenberg?

528
00:34:00,267 --> 00:34:01,382
Hello?

529
00:34:03,787 --> 00:34:05,015
Dr. Rosenberg?

530
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:11,665
Doc? I'm here for my 5:00.

531
00:34:25,987 --> 00:34:27,022
Dr. Rosenberg!

532
00:34:27,187 --> 00:34:32,819
Hi. Sorry about this.
The last session ended abruptly.

533
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,420
Where are the keys?

534
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:37,259
They're on the... Hey.

535
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:41,742
There's no reason you and I can't finish
what my last patient started.

536
00:34:43,627 --> 00:34:46,016
Have I mentioned
all the sample prescriptions I have

537
00:34:46,187 --> 00:34:47,620
with no place to go?

538
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:53,135
Okay. I'm gonna go freshen up.

539
00:35:13,547 --> 00:35:16,778
Excuse me.
You have to schedule an appointment.

540
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:38,818
Hey, Jess, it's me. Look,

541
00:35:39,227 --> 00:35:41,343
I'm not gonna make it back
until after the party starts

542
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:45,102
'cause Dr. Rosenberg's really making me
earn the pills this time.

543
00:35:45,747 --> 00:35:47,180
But I'll see you later? Bye.

544
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:12,266
Cheers, slut.

545
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:23,182
Really?

546
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:29,415
Hello?

547
00:36:36,787 --> 00:36:39,062
I don't have time for "Catch Me, Rape Me."

548
00:37:17,307 --> 00:37:19,662
Theta Pi, bitches!

549
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,336
Guys, it's 6:00 and I'm already wasted.

550
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:25,623
Yeah, and by 10:00, she'll be pregnant.

551
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:41,056
Okay.

552
00:37:48,027 --> 00:37:49,346
Senator Tyson.

553
00:37:50,507 --> 00:37:52,304
It is so nice to see you.

554
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:54,617
I apologize. I wasn't able
to make your luncheon.

555
00:37:54,787 --> 00:37:56,937
I just flew in
from a Commerce Committee meeting.

556
00:37:57,107 --> 00:37:58,506
That's no problem.

557
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:05,617
- Where's Kyle?
- He'll be along.

558
00:38:05,787 --> 00:38:09,746
This is nice for us. Gives us a chance
to talk. Sort out a few things.

559
00:38:10,147 --> 00:38:11,216
Thank you.

560
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:15,260
Jessica, may I be frank?

561
00:38:16,907 --> 00:38:18,738
You are a spirited girl.

562
00:38:19,387 --> 00:38:20,581
Oh, thank you, sir.

563
00:38:21,227 --> 00:38:22,899
I didn't mean that as a compliment.

564
00:38:23,507 --> 00:38:24,542
As I'm sure you've heard,

565
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:27,858
there are rumblings I might get
a vice presidential nod.

566
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:29,376
Yes, sir.

567
00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:33,103
In my experience,
there are two kinds of girls in this world.

568
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:37,260
The ones you spend your life with
and the ones you burn hard with.

569
00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:40,587
Problem is that I'm not sure
what kind you are.

570
00:38:40,747 --> 00:38:43,705
But I am sure that Kyle wants
to spend his life with you.

571
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:49,263
Sir, I've been dreaming my whole life
to marry someone like Kyle.

572
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:50,985
I don't like surprises.

573
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:53,376
Okay.

574
00:38:53,547 --> 00:38:56,778
When I pick up a book,
the first thing I do is read the last page.

575
00:38:58,027 --> 00:39:01,815
I'll be watching you, Jessica.
Don't give me any surprises.

576
00:39:01,987 --> 00:39:04,945
Otherwise this dream
you've had your whole life, well,

577
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:06,985
it all goes away.

578
00:39:08,587 --> 00:39:11,943
Senator Tyson, I won't disappoint you.

579
00:39:12,587 --> 00:39:15,340
I know you won't. I know you won't.

580
00:39:15,947 --> 00:39:17,141
I'm sorry.

581
00:39:18,627 --> 00:39:21,619
I am so sorry.
I was riding my bike and I got a flat.

582
00:39:21,787 --> 00:39:23,140
Yeah. Well, nothing to worry about, son.

583
00:39:23,307 --> 00:39:26,379
Your charming young lady
and I were just catching up.

584
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:28,978
She is a charmer, isn't she?

585
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:42,663
Looks like someone's been hard at work.

586
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:45,343
- Hey.
- Yeah.

587
00:39:45,507 --> 00:39:46,622
Could you put your eyes back in your head?

588
00:39:46,787 --> 00:39:48,379
- At least until I leave the room?
- Sure can.

589
00:39:48,547 --> 00:39:49,662
Thanks.

590
00:39:51,427 --> 00:39:53,338
Seriously, dude, the party starts in an hour.

591
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:54,735
- Go get ready!
- I'm going!

592
00:39:54,907 --> 00:39:57,182
Okay. Good. Bye.

593
00:39:57,907 --> 00:39:59,135
Are you gonna be all right?

594
00:39:59,307 --> 00:40:00,740
Sure. Why wouldn't I be all right?

595
00:40:00,907 --> 00:40:04,946
I'm good, Cass. Just let me help clean up.
That goes in the basement. I'll take it down.

596
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:11,941
That's tacky.

597
00:40:13,147 --> 00:40:14,865
- I'm worried about her.
- Who?

598
00:40:15,187 --> 00:40:18,623
Ellie. What is gonna happen to her
when she leaves this place?

599
00:40:18,787 --> 00:40:19,822
What do I care?

600
00:40:19,987 --> 00:40:21,898
I don't need her to do my term papers
for me anymore.

601
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:25,503
Jessica, I think that we have different
definitions of the word "sister."

602
00:40:26,747 --> 00:40:29,307
I'm gonna go take a shower.
That's not an invitation.

603
00:40:46,267 --> 00:40:48,827
Wow. Yoga is working wonders
on your ass.

604
00:41:33,227 --> 00:41:35,457
<i>Sorry. Didn't know this was ocupado.</i>

605
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:38,541
FYI, waxing isn't just for floors anymore.

606
00:41:41,147 --> 00:41:42,216
Riley?

607
00:41:42,707 --> 00:41:43,742
Are you a senior?

608
00:41:43,907 --> 00:41:46,137
Because last time I checked,
this was a senior bathroom.

609
00:41:46,867 --> 00:41:48,425
Do I have to start checking stalls again?

610
00:41:48,587 --> 00:41:49,622
Fuck.

611
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:51,541
No, I didn't think so.

612
00:41:52,347 --> 00:41:53,541
You can leave now.

613
00:41:54,467 --> 00:41:56,822
Actually. Wait. Drop your towel first.

614
00:41:58,467 --> 00:41:59,456
My room's on the other side of the...

615
00:41:59,627 --> 00:42:01,618
Without rules, there would be chaos.

616
00:42:02,907 --> 00:42:06,422
Fine. But if you wanted to see perfect tits,
all you had to do was ask.

617
00:42:11,747 --> 00:42:12,816
What?

618
00:42:17,747 --> 00:42:19,624
I keep thinking about that text.

619
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:21,096
Claire...

620
00:42:22,587 --> 00:42:26,182
Garret is a little bitch.
He says we made him kill Megan?

621
00:42:26,347 --> 00:42:27,416
As if.

622
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,498
Seriously, Claire, grow a pair.

623
00:42:29,987 --> 00:42:32,057
Jessica, I've always had your back.

624
00:42:32,227 --> 00:42:34,183
But you've never had a backbone.

625
00:43:07,187 --> 00:43:08,302
Hello?

626
00:43:32,627 --> 00:43:33,776
Hello?

627
00:44:20,147 --> 00:44:22,536
Hey, Ellie,
see if there's more vodka down there.

628
00:44:22,707 --> 00:44:23,822
Okay.

629
00:44:44,387 --> 00:44:46,184
Okay, more vodka.

630
00:44:49,067 --> 00:44:50,102
Hello?

631
00:44:54,227 --> 00:44:55,455
Anybody there?

632
00:44:58,707 --> 00:45:00,743
Where the hell
would they keep more vodka?

633
00:45:10,427 --> 00:45:12,497
No. No.

634
00:45:13,347 --> 00:45:15,907
Damn it! Shit.

635
00:45:18,747 --> 00:45:20,385
Oh, this is really dumb.

636
00:45:25,627 --> 00:45:28,141
"Here lies Ellie Morris,
and she never got laid."

637
00:45:59,347 --> 00:46:01,099
Ellie. Whoa.

638
00:46:02,067 --> 00:46:03,182
You all right?

639
00:46:05,107 --> 00:46:07,462
What are you...
What are you doing down here?

640
00:46:07,627 --> 00:46:09,185
I'm looking for you.

641
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:12,377
Cassidy said you might need some help.

642
00:46:17,587 --> 00:46:19,623
We killed her, you guys.
Don't you understand that?

643
00:46:19,787 --> 00:46:21,743
We dumped her body down a mineshaft!

644
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:22,942
- Why can't you understand that?
- Hey, Ellie,

645
00:46:23,107 --> 00:46:24,699
there are 30 other girls behind that door

646
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:27,222
that probably shouldn't know
we murdered our sorority sister, okay?

647
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:28,661
This isn't happening. It's not possible.

648
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,863
Okay, seriously, everyone just relax

649
00:46:31,027 --> 00:46:33,746
- for two seconds.
- Relax? The last time I saw that jacket,

650
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:36,262
you wrapped it around a dead body
and dropped it down a mineshaft.

651
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:38,065
- Where's the rest of it?
- It's a prank.

652
00:46:38,227 --> 00:46:40,821
It's the only explanation. It's...
Somebody's playing a prank.

653
00:46:40,987 --> 00:46:43,660
Yeah, or maybe Megan came back
from the dead and she wants to kill us.

654
00:46:43,827 --> 00:46:44,896
- How about that?
- No, listen.

655
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:47,262
Ellie, we didn't want to tell you,
but we got a text message earlier

656
00:46:47,427 --> 00:46:49,816
and we think that this is Garret
playing a sick joke on us.

657
00:46:49,987 --> 00:46:51,705
- Garret?
- Yes.

658
00:46:51,867 --> 00:46:52,982
He came back?

659
00:46:53,147 --> 00:46:56,696
He's gone psycho. He's left the compound.
Where the hell is Chugs, anyway?

660
00:46:56,867 --> 00:46:58,539
She left me a message.
She'll be here when the party starts.

661
00:46:58,707 --> 00:47:02,222
The party's already started!
I'm sorry, but it has.

662
00:47:02,387 --> 00:47:04,696
We all deserve to die.

663
00:47:04,867 --> 00:47:06,459
<i>HI, It's Chugs. Leave a message after the...</i>

664
00:47:07,707 --> 00:47:09,857
Chugs, we need to know where
your brother is and we need to know now.

665
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,621
Please, call back whenever you get this.

666
00:47:13,987 --> 00:47:17,536
- We're dead. We're so dead.
- Nobody is dead, Ellie.

667
00:47:17,707 --> 00:47:18,856
Well, Megan.

668
00:47:19,027 --> 00:47:22,178
This is Garret. Garret is harmless.
That's not the problem.

669
00:47:22,347 --> 00:47:25,862
- Then what is the problem?
- Well, Garret's gone nuts!

670
00:47:26,027 --> 00:47:29,463
Guys, if he blabs,
that's orange jumpsuits for all of us.

671
00:47:29,627 --> 00:47:30,537
What do we do?

672
00:47:30,707 --> 00:47:32,425
- We're calling the police.
- No.

673
00:47:32,587 --> 00:47:34,862
We stick together. Above all else.

674
00:47:35,027 --> 00:47:37,495
Why is it that the only time
you want to stick together

675
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:39,976
- is when your ass is on the line?
- And we wait for Chugs

676
00:47:40,147 --> 00:47:41,819
to put a pin in her brother.

677
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:46,026
But for now,
let's get ready and go downstairs

678
00:47:46,187 --> 00:47:48,178
- and enjoy the party.
- Like that's gonna happen.

679
00:47:48,347 --> 00:47:49,621
If we do not go to our own party,

680
00:47:49,787 --> 00:47:52,859
we might as well magic-marker "guilty"
across our foreheads.

681
00:47:53,027 --> 00:47:55,825
And if anybody sees Garret,
come get me, I will deal with him.

682
00:47:55,987 --> 00:47:58,421
But what about the jacket?

683
00:47:58,587 --> 00:48:00,066
Hide it, Ellie.

684
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:39,575
Help yourself.

685
00:48:40,987 --> 00:48:43,296
Yeah, I can see this ending well.

686
00:49:38,587 --> 00:49:39,906
Boo!

687
00:49:45,307 --> 00:49:47,696
Oh, my God, I so want to be anywhere
but here right now.

688
00:49:47,867 --> 00:49:51,177
- You're not alone.
- I promise we'll leave soon.

689
00:49:56,707 --> 00:49:57,856
Get off.

690
00:50:08,187 --> 00:50:09,540
Are you deaf or stupid?

691
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:12,699
Claire, what is your problem?
All right? Relax. Come on.

692
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:15,222
I just don't want you grinding
all your business all over me.

693
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,220
Yeah? Well, you didn't seem
to mind my business today in the hot tub.

694
00:50:18,387 --> 00:50:19,502
You know, Mickey,

695
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:22,181
it'd be really nice to have someone
who cared enough to read a situation.

696
00:50:22,347 --> 00:50:24,258
The situation is that
it's the last night of college, all right?

697
00:50:24,427 --> 00:50:27,737
I could catch action off
any of these girls. All right?

698
00:50:28,227 --> 00:50:29,546
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

699
00:50:30,347 --> 00:50:32,941
Well, catch this action, asshole.

700
00:50:50,227 --> 00:50:53,264
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

701
00:50:54,867 --> 00:50:56,266
I'm a sea pig!

702
00:51:08,547 --> 00:51:09,582
Dick!

703
00:51:21,747 --> 00:51:24,136
Hey, sweetie. How are you?

704
00:51:27,347 --> 00:51:28,985
So me and Claire just broke up.

705
00:51:29,147 --> 00:51:32,901
She hit me. Can you believe it?
It's ridiculous.

706
00:51:34,147 --> 00:51:38,106
But you, you look really pretty tonight.
I wanted to tell you that.

707
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:40,538
Really nice. I like this.

708
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:45,027
The whole braid thing you got going.

709
00:51:47,427 --> 00:51:51,056
Mickey? If you touch me again,
I'll fucking kill you.

710
00:51:52,507 --> 00:51:54,304
Okay. We'll talk later.

711
00:52:00,387 --> 00:52:01,900
- Come on, I'll push you up. Go.
- Okay.

712
00:52:02,827 --> 00:52:03,737
I can't...

713
00:52:03,907 --> 00:52:07,695
Ladies? Girls. I think I know what you want.

714
00:52:10,587 --> 00:52:12,703
Show a little skin, you're in.

715
00:52:14,387 --> 00:52:15,422
Hmm?

716
00:52:16,067 --> 00:52:18,661
Step into my office. Do excuse the mess.

717
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,416
Just one flash. That's it.

718
00:52:26,587 --> 00:52:28,179
That's negotiable.

719
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:31,466
What was that?

720
00:52:31,627 --> 00:52:34,346
Ladies? Stay. Okay? I got the passes.

721
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:39,062
Hello?

722
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:43,742
Buddy, you graduated. That's awesome.

723
00:52:43,907 --> 00:52:45,704
We're all real impressed.

724
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:47,505
- However, you're blocking...
- Hey!

725
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:48,986
- Yeah?
- We're gonna pass.

726
00:52:49,147 --> 00:52:51,581
- No. You're not gonna pass.
- No, you're just a little too creepy.

727
00:52:51,747 --> 00:52:55,376
- Yeah. And you're not real hot, either.
- That's not very nice.

728
00:52:55,867 --> 00:52:58,859
Hey, thanks a lot, buddy.

729
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:01,582
Ladies?

730
00:53:04,187 --> 00:53:06,655
Ellie? Hey, we were just messing around.

731
00:53:06,827 --> 00:53:09,421
It's nothing worth talking to Claire about.

732
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:11,464
Right, Ellie? Ellie!

733
00:53:11,627 --> 00:53:14,141
You're better off
without him, Claire.

734
00:53:19,467 --> 00:53:21,503
I'm really glad you stayed.

735
00:53:23,827 --> 00:53:26,216
Cass, I want you to know that

736
00:53:26,387 --> 00:53:30,300
I think it's great
that you've turned into a better person.

737
00:53:30,467 --> 00:53:33,265
I have not become a better person.
I'm far from it.

738
00:53:33,427 --> 00:53:36,464
No, I mean, with the charity work

739
00:53:36,627 --> 00:53:40,700
and all the other stuff you've done
and getting away from this place.

740
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:43,976
I...

741
00:53:45,507 --> 00:53:49,819
We made a huge mistake
not going to the cops.

742
00:53:51,787 --> 00:53:53,186
Yeah, we made

743
00:53:54,747 --> 00:53:57,136
a string of bad choices that night.

744
00:53:57,827 --> 00:53:59,977
And right now there's not much
we can do about it.

745
00:54:00,147 --> 00:54:02,058
We are sisters.

746
00:54:02,227 --> 00:54:06,857
And right now all we can do
is stick together and get through this thing.

747
00:54:07,587 --> 00:54:08,622
Yeah.

748
00:54:11,587 --> 00:54:12,656
Yeah.

749
00:54:13,587 --> 00:54:14,702
Ellie?

750
00:54:19,907 --> 00:54:21,022
Ellie?

751
00:54:22,067 --> 00:54:23,580
Are you up here?

752
00:54:26,907 --> 00:54:31,219
All right, look, I... I can admit
I've been kind of a jerk, all right?

753
00:54:31,387 --> 00:54:37,462
But I promise if you come out,
I'll apologize and we can

754
00:54:38,707 --> 00:54:40,265
kiss and make up.

755
00:54:43,787 --> 00:54:45,379
What are you doing?

756
00:54:45,547 --> 00:54:47,265
Who the fuck are you?

757
00:55:00,267 --> 00:55:02,576
Please! Help me!

758
00:55:07,627 --> 00:55:09,902
Please! Help me! Help me, please!

759
00:55:12,147 --> 00:55:14,661
That dude's fucking wasted.

760
00:55:14,827 --> 00:55:16,260
Please help me!

761
00:55:17,387 --> 00:55:18,945
Why are you doing this to me?

762
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,621
Help me! Help me! Help!

763
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:38,583
Why are you doing this to me?

764
00:55:39,707 --> 00:55:41,106
Oh, my God!

765
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:51,625
Help! Help! Oh, my God!

766
00:55:51,787 --> 00:55:55,780
Help me! I need help! Help!

767
00:56:12,627 --> 00:56:15,016
I think you need some more mascara.

768
00:56:16,427 --> 00:56:18,987
- Yeah, I do. Thanks.
- Yeah.

769
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,822
Oh, God, Ellie's falling apart.

770
00:56:22,987 --> 00:56:24,181
What now?

771
00:56:35,947 --> 00:56:37,460
Excuse me, honey.

772
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:38,821
Is everything okay?

773
00:56:38,987 --> 00:56:42,104
Yeah. Ellie's just freaking out. As usual.

774
00:56:44,307 --> 00:56:46,457
I thought you said you had everything
under control.

775
00:56:46,627 --> 00:56:47,662
I do.

776
00:56:50,387 --> 00:56:51,661
You better.

777
00:56:56,627 --> 00:56:58,697
Ellie? You okay?

778
00:56:58,867 --> 00:57:02,382
- What? What now, Ellie?
- Enough! Shh!

779
00:57:04,147 --> 00:57:07,264
Okay, we don't have time for this.
Just... First word?

780
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:08,826
First syllable?

781
00:57:08,987 --> 00:57:11,865
- Okay, go!
- He was wearing a hooded graduation...

782
00:57:12,027 --> 00:57:13,380
Somebody in a graduation gown?

783
00:57:13,547 --> 00:57:16,937
A hooded graduation gown?
Ellie, it's Graduation Day.

784
00:57:17,107 --> 00:57:19,575
Half the Greek system is
in hooded graduation gowns right now.

785
00:57:19,747 --> 00:57:21,146
Did he have two eyes?
Did he have two ears?

786
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:22,865
Okay, stop! Jessica, stop.

787
00:57:23,027 --> 00:57:24,745
- What?
- Let her talk.

788
00:57:26,587 --> 00:57:28,259
He... He...

789
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,301
Okay, if you can't tell us,
you're going to show us.

790
00:57:35,467 --> 00:57:36,695
- No! Please! No!
- Okay.

791
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:38,903
- We'll go together. We'll go together.
- Ellie!

792
00:57:39,787 --> 00:57:42,460
- No!
- Can't we just leave her?

793
00:57:43,707 --> 00:57:45,459
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna stay with her.

794
00:57:45,627 --> 00:57:46,662
Good.

795
00:57:54,547 --> 00:57:56,663
This is stupid.
We're missing the party of the year.

796
00:57:56,827 --> 00:57:59,625
I know. Why couldn't Ellie
have had a nervous breakdown tomorrow?

797
00:57:59,787 --> 00:58:03,336
You know, Cassidy, sometimes
when you're sarcastic like that,

798
00:58:03,507 --> 00:58:07,341
it really makes you sound like a bitch.
And nobody likes a bitch.

799
00:58:11,627 --> 00:58:12,946
Oh, my God.

800
00:58:16,067 --> 00:58:19,457
It's Mickey. I would know
those ugly-ass shoes anywhere.

801
00:58:19,827 --> 00:58:21,101
Is he dead?

802
00:58:22,027 --> 00:58:25,463
Well, he has a fucking tire iron
through his head.

803
00:58:27,907 --> 00:58:29,340
Do you think it's the same one
that killed Megan?

804
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:32,385
You make it sound like
the tire iron killed Megan by itself.

805
00:58:32,547 --> 00:58:34,822
Thank you for the grammar lesson.

806
00:58:34,987 --> 00:58:39,026
I'm just saying it looks a little updated,
doesn't it? Like someone's

807
00:58:39,627 --> 00:58:41,060
pimped it out.

808
00:58:44,987 --> 00:58:47,217
Oh, my God,
are you seeing this?

809
00:58:48,147 --> 00:58:49,102
Who shot this?

810
00:58:49,267 --> 00:58:52,145
This is from Megan's phone.
Look at the angle.

811
00:59:02,867 --> 00:59:05,939
This can't be Megan.
She's rotting in a mineshaft.

812
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:07,457
This has to be Garret.

813
00:59:12,987 --> 00:59:14,136
We can't let him do that.

814
00:59:14,307 --> 00:59:15,786
If Garret or Megan are killing people,

815
00:59:15,947 --> 00:59:17,346
we have bigger problems
than him texting the police.

816
00:59:17,507 --> 00:59:19,463
We cannot let Ellie see this text message.

817
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:21,782
Shit. Too late.

818
00:59:21,947 --> 00:59:24,336
Okay, I'm gonna go get the Escalade.
And you go round up the girls.

819
00:59:24,507 --> 00:59:25,906
Okay. Where are we going?

820
00:59:26,067 --> 00:59:27,659
You read the text.
We're gonna go down to the lake

821
00:59:27,827 --> 00:59:30,500
and put an end to this once and for all.

822
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,380
- What is it?
- Get in the car. Jessica's driving.

823
00:59:34,547 --> 00:59:36,424
What did you guys find?

824
00:59:36,587 --> 00:59:40,580
Mickey is dead. We have to go now, okay?
I'll be there in two minutes.

825
00:59:42,547 --> 00:59:43,582
What?

826
00:59:49,467 --> 00:59:52,777
- Do I know you?
- I imagine. Yeah.

827
00:59:52,947 --> 00:59:55,780
You sell weed on the quad, right?

828
00:59:55,947 --> 00:59:59,701
No, I was the valedictorian.
At your graduation?

829
01:00:00,387 --> 01:00:03,185
- Today?
- No.

830
01:00:06,707 --> 01:00:09,426
- Andy, I really need to talk to you.
- Yeah?

831
01:00:10,427 --> 01:00:12,577
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just...

832
01:00:13,507 --> 01:00:16,146
There's something I need to take care of.

833
01:00:16,307 --> 01:00:18,821
I want you to go to your parents'
and I'll meet you there tomorrow.

834
01:00:18,987 --> 01:00:20,215
Cass, this is ridiculous. I'll stay.

835
01:00:20,387 --> 01:00:22,105
- We'll drive down together.
- No. Just do me this one favor.

836
01:00:22,267 --> 01:00:23,700
I promise I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

837
01:00:23,867 --> 01:00:26,700
Just go get in the car.
Go. Okay? For me.

838
01:00:27,987 --> 01:00:29,215
All right, fine.

839
01:00:31,867 --> 01:00:34,506
Sorry. Just doing a little redecorating.

840
01:00:45,707 --> 01:00:46,981
I gotta go.

841
01:00:55,587 --> 01:00:57,225
That was so beautiful.

842
01:00:57,387 --> 01:00:59,582
- I don't understand. Why Mickey?
- I don't know.

843
01:00:59,747 --> 01:01:01,783
Maybe because he was a dick.

844
01:01:02,747 --> 01:01:04,863
- Out of my way, bitches!
- Jessica!

845
01:01:05,027 --> 01:01:05,982
Chill out!

846
01:01:07,347 --> 01:01:10,623
Look, we have 14 minutes before that clip
is sent to the police.

847
01:01:09,786 --> 01:01:10,786
I'd rather not spend my childbearing years
in lockup.

848
01:01:10,787 --> 01:01:12,823
Does anyone have a weapon?
Mace? Anything?

849
01:01:12,987 --> 01:01:15,455
Yeah, there's a chainsaw
in the glove box.

850
01:01:15,627 --> 01:01:18,221
Ellie, you've got to stop doing that.

851
01:01:21,867 --> 01:01:24,381
Where the hell are you going?

852
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:26,577
Where are you guys going?
Is the party over already?

853
01:01:26,747 --> 01:01:28,703
I thought I said not to come.

854
01:01:28,867 --> 01:01:30,346
Funny thing. It turns out it's not actually
against Greek rules after all.

855
01:01:30,507 --> 01:01:33,305
- Yeah, but we told you to stay away, so...
- Yeah. But then I thought,

856
01:01:33,467 --> 01:01:36,698
"Why would I listen to a lying bitch
like you?"

857
01:01:36,867 --> 01:01:39,256
By the way, my sister hated you. Peace.

858
01:01:39,427 --> 01:01:42,976
Hey, Jessica, we gotta go.

859
01:01:44,307 --> 01:01:46,502
I'm gonna deal with you later.

860
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:47,782
You might want to deal with that hair first,
'cause it looks like shit.

861
01:01:47,947 --> 01:01:52,065
Okay.

862
01:01:54,467 --> 01:01:55,502
She'd have made a great Theta.

863
01:01:58,307 --> 01:02:00,218
Megan's alive, you guys.

864
01:02:08,267 --> 01:02:09,461
Ellie, you're being
borderline retarded right now.

865
01:02:09,627 --> 01:02:11,345
She's not alive. Garret is doing this.

866
01:02:11,507 --> 01:02:14,021
There should be
a flashlight in there.

867
01:02:18,627 --> 01:02:20,697
No, but there's a flare gun.

868
01:02:20,867 --> 01:02:22,858
Daddy has an overactive imagination.

869
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:25,944
Good for us.

870
01:02:26,107 --> 01:02:27,335
Stay close, okay? Keep our heads on.
This could be anyone.

871
01:02:27,507 --> 01:02:31,705
Okay, so no flashlight.

872
01:02:33,107 --> 01:02:34,620
Do we have, like, a lighter?
A light? Anything?

873
01:02:34,787 --> 01:02:38,177
Hold on.

874
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:39,661
You know this was all your fault.

875
01:02:46,227 --> 01:02:48,218
- You guys made me do this.
- Back the fuck up, psycho!

876
01:02:48,387 --> 01:02:50,662
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Calm down?

877
01:02:50,827 --> 01:02:52,863
- He killed Mickey.
- You guys, it's the other half.

878
01:02:53,027 --> 01:02:55,461
You fucking... You fucking bitches!

879
01:02:55,627 --> 01:02:57,663
Where'd you get that jacket?
And whose blood is that on you?

880
01:02:57,827 --> 01:03:01,615
It's mine.

881
01:03:01,787 --> 01:03:03,061
Fuck you! You made me...

882
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:05,744
Oh, my God!

883
01:03:14,747 --> 01:03:15,975
Take that, you freak show.

884
01:03:16,147 --> 01:03:18,103
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

885
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:20,464
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, he's not moving.

886
01:03:21,147 --> 01:03:23,263
Well, it looks like he won't be sending us
any more video clips.

887
01:03:23,427 --> 01:03:25,702
What the fuck did you do, Jessica?

888
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:27,539
- He was coming at you with a knife.
- It was a piece of a mirror!

889
01:03:27,707 --> 01:03:30,267
Same diff. Should I have waited for him
to stab you guys?

890
01:03:30,427 --> 01:03:33,419
You should be thanking me right now.

891
01:03:33,587 --> 01:03:36,021
Okay, three-to-one odds he's still alive.

892
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,906
Or not.

893
01:03:51,347 --> 01:03:52,462
Garret?

894
01:03:53,307 --> 01:03:54,456
My God. He cut his own wrists.

895
01:03:57,107 --> 01:03:59,701
- No.
- He didn't kill Mickey.

896
01:03:59,867 --> 01:04:01,346
No, hold on. Let's take a field trip
to reality for a second.

897
01:04:01,507 --> 01:04:04,419
He sent half the jacket to us, killed Mickey
and then slit his wrist in guilt.

898
01:04:04,587 --> 01:04:09,138
You guys, it's not Megan.
We killed her. She's dead.

899
01:04:09,307 --> 01:04:12,936
Oh, yeah? Well, he got the same message
we did. From Megan's phone.

900
01:04:13,107 --> 01:04:17,066
Now do you believe me? It's Megan.

901
01:04:18,227 --> 01:04:20,866
There's only one way to find out.

902
01:04:22,147 --> 01:04:24,377
Oh, Jesus.

903
01:04:24,547 --> 01:04:25,866
Slower, slower! Easy.

904
01:04:35,867 --> 01:04:38,586
- Give me as much light as you can!
- This is it.

905
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:48,105
More slack!

906
01:04:51,267 --> 01:04:52,586
Wait! The chain!

907
01:04:57,107 --> 01:04:58,825
Oh, my God!

908
01:04:59,227 --> 01:05:00,546
Cassidy!

909
01:05:01,267 --> 01:05:02,461
- Cass!
- Cass!

910
01:05:04,427 --> 01:05:05,746
Cassidy?

911
01:05:07,747 --> 01:05:08,896
Cassidy, are you okay?

912
01:05:11,067 --> 01:05:12,864
Yeah.

913
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:14,622
We're gonna get you
out of there, okay?

914
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:17,460
- Oh, my God, Cass!
- Sorry.

915
01:05:21,027 --> 01:05:22,938
Nice, Ellie.

916
01:05:24,347 --> 01:05:25,700
- Do you see Megan down there?
- What's going on, Cass?

917
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:36,698
Can you see anything?

918
01:05:45,627 --> 01:05:47,379
Cass?

919
01:05:49,347 --> 01:05:50,416
I see the blanket, but I don't see Megan.

920
01:05:51,387 --> 01:05:54,060
- Where is everybody?
- Probably dead.

921
01:06:26,547 --> 01:06:29,584
Yeah. And then the corpses
drove their cars home, idiot.

922
01:06:29,747 --> 01:06:32,898
Bitch.

923
01:06:33,067 --> 01:06:34,182
Bucky? Where did everybody go?

924
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:38,658
After-party at Rho Sigma Nu.

925
01:06:38,827 --> 01:06:41,182
- What's that noise?
- The Jacuzzi. It overheated.

926
01:06:41,347 --> 01:06:44,544
See you guys there?

927
01:06:44,707 --> 01:06:46,379
I still can't get Chugs
on the phone.

928
01:06:47,147 --> 01:06:49,581
Maybe Megan won't kill us.
I mean, we are sisters. Sisters for life, right?

929
01:06:49,747 --> 01:06:53,626
Yeah, that ought to trump
dumping her down a mineshaft.

930
01:06:53,787 --> 01:06:56,221
We cannot just leave his body at the lake.

931
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,696
I don't care what you guys do,

932
01:06:58,867 --> 01:06:59,982
but I'm gonna go find Kyle
to make sure he's okay

933
01:07:00,147 --> 01:07:02,103
and then I'm getting my stuff
and I'm getting the hell out of here,

934
01:07:02,267 --> 01:07:04,462
and never looking back.

935
01:07:04,627 --> 01:07:06,424
- I'm gonna shut that thing off.
- No! Wait! Don't go alone.

936
01:07:07,147 --> 01:07:10,059
I'm good.

937
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:11,455
Kyle?

938
01:07:30,507 --> 01:07:31,542
Kyle? Kyle? It's me! Kyle?

939
01:07:34,707 --> 01:07:38,495
Fuck.

940
01:08:01,867 --> 01:08:02,902
Oh!

941
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:08,782
Great.

942
01:08:09,747 --> 01:08:10,862
Okay, drunkees, out!

943
01:08:23,027 --> 01:08:25,018
Fine.

944
01:08:25,867 --> 01:08:26,936
Out! Out! Out! Get out!

945
01:08:28,427 --> 01:08:31,976
Oh, my gosh! What the fuck?

946
01:08:32,147 --> 01:08:33,341
- You're kind of sexy.
- Bye!

947
01:08:33,507 --> 01:08:35,463
Come on, baby, let's go.

948
01:08:37,627 --> 01:08:39,219
What's your guys' names?

949
01:08:39,387 --> 01:08:41,059
Is somebody gonna turn off the music
or do I have to do everything myself?

950
01:09:26,307 --> 01:09:30,619
- You okay, Ellie?
- No.

951
01:09:33,907 --> 01:09:36,023
Ellie, come on,
you gotta get it together. Okay?

952
01:09:39,947 --> 01:09:43,826
Finally, Chugs.

953
01:09:46,067 --> 01:09:47,546
"Jess, Cass and Ellie,
I'm gonna miss the party."

954
01:09:51,907 --> 01:09:54,660
No!

955
01:10:01,027 --> 01:10:01,982
How come that didn't include Claire?

956
01:10:02,947 --> 01:10:05,461
Oh, gosh! I can't...

957
01:10:06,347 --> 01:10:07,860
Door won't open!

958
01:10:08,027 --> 01:10:09,585
Hurry up, Cass!

959
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,226
Oh, my God!

960
01:10:11,867 --> 01:10:13,425
Give me your hand, Claire.
Give me your hand!

961
01:10:14,227 --> 01:10:16,297
Please, help me, please!

962
01:10:20,867 --> 01:10:23,301
Claire, no!

963
01:10:27,067 --> 01:10:28,261
Oh, my God! Help!

964
01:10:32,907 --> 01:10:35,137
- Help!
- Claire!

965
01:10:40,707 --> 01:10:42,140
Claire?

966
01:10:53,867 --> 01:10:54,982
- Go, go! Go, go, go!
- What?

967
01:11:22,387 --> 01:11:24,776
Kyle!

968
01:11:25,107 --> 01:11:26,176
She's here. It's Megan
and she's gonna kill all of us.

969
01:11:29,187 --> 01:11:32,418
It's okay. It's okay.

970
01:11:32,587 --> 01:11:33,940
- Let's go. Come on, Ellie!
- Oh, my God!

971
01:11:35,467 --> 01:11:37,025
Kyle?

972
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:38,462
Kyle?

973
01:11:39,627 --> 01:11:40,696
Kyle!

974
01:11:41,387 --> 01:11:42,502
Oh, God.

975
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:46,416
Kyle, is that you?

976
01:11:47,707 --> 01:11:49,299
Kyle?

977
01:11:51,867 --> 01:11:52,936
- What are you doing in my bed?
- Oh, I met the cutest boy.

978
01:11:57,347 --> 01:12:01,545
- This one.
- That's my boy.

979
01:12:01,707 --> 01:12:03,345
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

980
01:12:03,507 --> 01:12:04,781
Awkward. Anyways, you mind giving us
a little space?

981
01:12:04,947 --> 01:12:07,620
We were just kind of getting started
when you pulled up, and...

982
01:12:07,787 --> 01:12:10,426
By the way, I know
you fucked Megan's boyfriend. She told me.

983
01:12:10,587 --> 01:12:15,263
- Hmm. Payback's such a bitch.
- You're a bitch!

984
01:12:15,587 --> 01:12:19,057
Stop it!

985
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:25,861
You're such a whore!

986
01:12:27,827 --> 01:12:29,499
- I'll kill you.
- She's in the house.

987
01:12:33,107 --> 01:12:35,063
- Who's in the house?
- Shut the fuck up!

988
01:12:35,227 --> 01:12:37,741
Stop it!

989
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:40,781
Screw this.

990
01:12:49,747 --> 01:12:51,066
Mrs. Crenshaw, it's me, Jessica.

991
01:13:22,747 --> 01:13:24,385
I know. You've had that
coming for four years.

992
01:13:24,547 --> 01:13:27,380
I saw what you did.

993
01:13:27,547 --> 01:13:29,219
We didn't mean to kill Megan.

994
01:13:30,427 --> 01:13:32,543
What?

995
01:13:33,747 --> 01:13:34,623
Kill Megan?
I was talking about trashing my house.

996
01:13:34,787 --> 01:13:37,506
You killed my sister? You fucking bitch!

997
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:40,818
- Talk.
- Okay, listen. It was an accident

998
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:45,903
and we'll explain everything later,
but right now Claire is dead,

999
01:13:46,067 --> 01:13:48,456
Mickey's dead, Chugs is dead
and we don't know if Megan is alive or not.

1000
01:13:48,627 --> 01:13:51,858
Wait. So Megan is not dead?

1001
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:54,097
We don't know!
We need to get the hell out of here.

1002
01:13:54,267 --> 01:13:57,100
- Who else is here?
- Kyle.

1003
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:59,098
- Is he in on this thing?
- No.

1004
01:13:59,267 --> 01:14:01,656
- Lie to me again.
- Okay, I told Kyle about Megan.

1005
01:14:03,387 --> 01:14:06,857
Of course, you did!
What's with this "sisters for life" crap?

1006
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:10,861
Was I the only one that didn't tell anybody?

1007
01:14:11,027 --> 01:14:14,019
Where is Kyle?

1008
01:14:14,187 --> 01:14:15,620
Don't look at me.
He left as soon as he heard you coming.

1009
01:14:16,547 --> 01:14:19,744
Well, he, she or it
is about to get two rounds to the face.

1010
01:14:19,907 --> 01:14:23,217
You girls wait in Jessica's room.
And call the police.

1011
01:14:23,387 --> 01:14:26,663
Wow, who knew Mrs. Crenshaw
was such a badass?

1012
01:14:28,067 --> 01:14:29,944
Where's your phone?

1013
01:14:30,107 --> 01:14:31,142
Mine?

1014
01:14:31,987 --> 01:14:32,976
I don't know.
I think I dropped it somewhere.

1015
01:14:33,187 --> 01:14:35,655
Where's your phone, Ellie? Ellie!

1016
01:14:35,827 --> 01:14:37,943
I don't really know
where my phone is right now.

1017
01:14:38,107 --> 01:14:39,665
I've had kind of a crazy day.
And I don't really...

1018
01:14:39,827 --> 01:14:42,546
There's been a lot of shit
going down here.

1019
01:14:42,707 --> 01:14:46,017
So can you just give me a minute?

1020
01:14:46,547 --> 01:14:48,060
I don't understand. You're saying
that you think my sister's alive?

1021
01:14:48,227 --> 01:14:51,139
We don't know anything for sure, Maggie.

1022
01:14:51,307 --> 01:14:52,899
- Maybe she got her.
- Oh, my God! No! Megan!

1023
01:14:56,147 --> 01:15:00,186
- No, don't go out there.
- Wait. Wait.

1024
01:15:00,347 --> 01:15:02,986
What? I tried to warn her.

1025
01:15:03,627 --> 01:15:05,458
Come to mama.

1026
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:25,506
Please don't think I'm afraid of you.

1027
01:15:40,307 --> 01:15:42,377
I run a house with 50 crazy bitches.

1028
01:15:42,547 --> 01:15:45,345
You guys, that's coming
from the back of the house.

1029
01:15:46,307 --> 01:15:47,899
We can make a run for it.

1030
01:15:48,067 --> 01:15:49,056
You guys can do whatever you want.
I'm staying here.

1031
01:15:49,227 --> 01:15:52,025
If I can get to Mickey's body,
I can get his phone and we can call for help.

1032
01:15:52,187 --> 01:15:54,940
Okay, well, I'm going with you.

1033
01:15:55,107 --> 01:15:56,540
Okay, I could use your cover with the ax.
But you work with me, understand?

1034
01:15:56,707 --> 01:16:00,495
I don't want to turn around
and not be able to find you.

1035
01:16:00,667 --> 01:16:02,578
Cassidy! Seriously?
After everything we've been through?

1036
01:16:02,747 --> 01:16:06,581
Okay, Ellie? If you get a chance to run,
take it. Don't worry about us.

1037
01:16:06,747 --> 01:16:10,376
- Okay.
- Okay.

1038
01:16:10,547 --> 01:16:11,900
Meg?

1039
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:20,902
Megan?

1040
01:16:26,147 --> 01:16:27,262
It's Mags.

1041
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:29,941
God!

1042
01:17:00,347 --> 01:17:01,416
You stay the fuck away from my girls.

1043
01:17:20,907 --> 01:17:24,263
Megan?

1044
01:17:30,907 --> 01:17:32,022
You there?

1045
01:17:38,867 --> 01:17:40,141
Megan? Is that you?

1046
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,697
Oh, my God.

1047
01:17:58,347 --> 01:17:59,621
I have to do something.

1048
01:18:10,187 --> 01:18:12,018
Okay, okay.

1049
01:18:16,947 --> 01:18:18,221
Shit.

1050
01:18:21,707 --> 01:18:22,696
Come on.

1051
01:18:32,907 --> 01:18:34,101
Please, God, don't let me get killed.

1052
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:39,385
- Please, God, don't let me get killed.
- Stop giving him ideas.

1053
01:18:39,547 --> 01:18:43,256
- Okay.
- Come on.

1054
01:18:45,027 --> 01:18:46,699
Kyle?

1055
01:18:55,667 --> 01:18:56,702
What are you doing here?

1056
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,100
When I heard you calling, I was...

1057
01:19:00,267 --> 01:19:03,384
I heard gunshots.

1058
01:19:03,547 --> 01:19:04,662
- Why are you wearing that gown?
- And why aren't you wearing any pants?

1059
01:19:04,827 --> 01:19:08,866
- I threw something on, because...
- You fucked her, didn't you?

1060
01:19:09,027 --> 01:19:11,746
- I need you to get a hold of yourself.
- You fucked her!

1061
01:19:11,907 --> 01:19:13,340
Don't tell me to calm down!

1062
01:19:13,507 --> 01:19:15,543
I warned you, Jessica.

1063
01:19:18,827 --> 01:19:21,136
You just couldn't hold it together,
could you?

1064
01:19:21,307 --> 01:19:24,140
Put the ax down.
Honey, I really don't want to hurt you.

1065
01:19:25,267 --> 01:19:29,226
What do you think you're doing?

1066
01:19:32,747 --> 01:19:34,942
Give me the phone!

1067
01:19:36,907 --> 01:19:38,784
Can't breathe.

1068
01:19:38,947 --> 01:19:40,266
I told you, Jessica, this can't get out.

1069
01:19:40,427 --> 01:19:42,782
Jessica, help me!

1070
01:19:42,947 --> 01:19:44,016
Help? Don't you know anything
about Jessica?

1071
01:19:44,187 --> 01:19:46,257
She's a power whore.

1072
01:19:46,427 --> 01:19:47,860
She'll do anything, as long...

1073
01:19:48,027 --> 01:19:50,382
As long as you keep your dick
in your pants, scumbag.

1074
01:19:50,547 --> 01:19:53,857
Are you crazy?

1075
01:19:54,027 --> 01:19:55,460
Do you have any idea
what my father is capable of?

1076
01:19:56,467 --> 01:19:59,698
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe
I'm fucking the wrong guy!

1077
01:19:59,867 --> 01:20:03,143
- That's it.
- Cassidy! Shit!

1078
01:20:03,307 --> 01:20:06,185
- Some sister she turned out to be.
- Hey, asshole!

1079
01:20:06,347 --> 01:20:09,384
Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

1080
01:20:12,947 --> 01:20:15,336
The window!

1081
01:20:17,147 --> 01:20:18,466
- Shit! The scaffolding.
- Well, good plan!

1082
01:20:21,187 --> 01:20:23,576
Come on, Jess! Cass? Let's hug it out.

1083
01:20:23,747 --> 01:20:28,025
Okay. Who the hell lit the house
on fire? Shit!

1084
01:20:30,347 --> 01:20:32,463
Oh, my God.

1085
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:33,821
Ladies?

1086
01:20:33,987 --> 01:20:35,420
Jessica! Come on, babe. I'm sorry.

1087
01:20:42,347 --> 01:20:46,977
Come on.

1088
01:20:55,547 --> 01:20:56,696
- Oh, my God! It's Megan! Oh, my God!
- She looks terrible.

1089
01:21:09,067 --> 01:21:12,377
I'm really starting to think
he's not marriage material.

1090
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:29,057
My dad

1091
01:21:34,347 --> 01:21:35,700
is gonna be

1092
01:21:35,867 --> 01:21:37,778
very angry.

1093
01:21:37,947 --> 01:21:39,983
I can't let my father hang out to dry for this.

1094
01:21:48,107 --> 01:21:50,860
And we're not leaving here
until we come up with a story.

1095
01:21:51,027 --> 01:21:54,463
I guess your boyfriend's not here
to protect you, huh?

1096
01:21:56,547 --> 01:21:59,584
- Guess again.
- Andy?

1097
01:22:07,107 --> 01:22:09,257
It's okay.

1098
01:22:09,427 --> 01:22:10,701
- Oh, my God. You didn't leave?
- It's okay.

1099
01:22:11,067 --> 01:22:13,058
I couldn't, Cass. I knew you were in trouble.

1100
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:16,105
What... What happened?

1101
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:20,778
- This place isn't safe.
- You saved me.

1102
01:22:22,147 --> 01:22:24,422
Yeah. And I always will.

1103
01:22:24,587 --> 01:22:27,579
You don't need this place. These people.

1104
01:22:28,187 --> 01:22:30,985
I'm the one who's never gonna let anything
happen to you.

1105
01:22:31,747 --> 01:22:35,183
Oh, my God.

1106
01:22:49,067 --> 01:22:50,341
- What?
- You?

1107
01:22:53,987 --> 01:22:55,943
You?

1108
01:22:57,187 --> 01:22:58,176
You know what? It's okay. This is okay.

1109
01:22:59,027 --> 01:23:01,700
We can fix this. I mean, this is fixable, so...

1110
01:23:03,067 --> 01:23:06,537
Andy, you can count on us.
The five tenets of sister...

1111
01:23:07,867 --> 01:23:11,462
That girl really needs to learn
to keep her mouth shut.

1112
01:23:13,707 --> 01:23:17,063
I know, Cassidy. I know everything.
Ellie told me.

1113
01:23:17,227 --> 01:23:21,459
Some of the things she said
about some of the things you did...

1114
01:23:22,267 --> 01:23:27,022
- You killed...
- I freed us.

1115
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:30,942
Hey.

1116
01:23:32,747 --> 01:23:33,782
Admit it.

1117
01:23:34,027 --> 01:23:35,301
These are horrible people. Playing house.

1118
01:23:35,867 --> 01:23:38,904
Sitting around circling each other's fat.
Drinking their lives away.

1119
01:23:39,067 --> 01:23:41,979
You've been trying to get away for a year.

1120
01:23:42,147 --> 01:23:44,536
- I'm just helping you cut the cord.
- You killed everybody.

1121
01:23:44,707 --> 01:23:47,983
Well, everybody that knew had to die.

1122
01:23:48,427 --> 01:23:50,463
Claire, Chugs.

1123
01:23:50,627 --> 01:23:51,855
You told Crenshaw. Jessica told Kyle.

1124
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:54,541
And I'm sure Claire told Mickey.

1125
01:23:54,707 --> 01:23:56,584
You know, and even if she didn't,
that guy really was a dick.

1126
01:23:56,747 --> 01:23:59,420
I didn't kill Garret.

1127
01:23:59,587 --> 01:24:01,339
Give me some credit there.

1128
01:24:01,747 --> 01:24:02,975
Now, then again,
that kid was so ready to snap,

1129
01:24:03,147 --> 01:24:04,819
he had the suicide hotline on speed dial.

1130
01:24:04,987 --> 01:24:07,660
I'm feeling
a little under-appreciated here, Cassidy.

1131
01:24:07,827 --> 01:24:10,341
Don't you see?
You've been attached to this forever.

1132
01:24:10,507 --> 01:24:13,465
One of them gets drunk, gets blabby.

1133
01:24:13,627 --> 01:24:15,060
Some girl overhears it in the bathroom.

1134
01:24:15,227 --> 01:24:17,024
Another spills the beans to her therapist.

1135
01:24:17,187 --> 01:24:18,825
Do you really want to be dealing
with this for the rest of your life?

1136
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:22,104
For the rest of our lives?

1137
01:24:22,267 --> 01:24:24,223
Now today I gave the valedictorian speech.
Remember?

1138
01:24:25,307 --> 01:24:28,902
"Reputation comes
from the company you keep."

1139
01:24:29,507 --> 01:24:32,340
And the company you keep?

1140
01:24:33,187 --> 01:24:35,098
Bitches.

1141
01:24:36,427 --> 01:24:37,621
Do you know what that word "valedictorian"
comes from?

1142
01:24:39,227 --> 01:24:41,980
<i>It's from the Latin. Vale dicere.</i>

1143
01:24:42,147 --> 01:24:44,502
"To say farewell."

1144
01:24:45,867 --> 01:24:47,459
Well, to the bitches of Theta Pi,

1145
01:24:48,147 --> 01:24:51,219
I'm saying farewell.

1146
01:24:53,107 --> 01:24:54,825
Are you with me?

1147
01:24:56,387 --> 01:24:57,900
Yes.

1148
01:25:05,987 --> 01:25:07,215
I knew you would be.

1149
01:25:07,387 --> 01:25:09,059
It's for the best. For us. For our future.
Hell, for society in general.

1150
01:25:09,227 --> 01:25:14,062
Great.

1151
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:16,782
Now let's go kill Ellie,
then we're off to my folks' summer house

1152
01:25:21,787 --> 01:25:23,937
for some well-deserved R&R.

1153
01:25:24,107 --> 01:25:25,256
- Wait. Ellie?
- Of course. Come on, we'll both do Ellie.

1154
01:25:25,427 --> 01:25:28,339
You're always saying
we need to do more stuff together.

1155
01:25:28,507 --> 01:25:30,418
I'm with you on everything, but Ellie?
I mean, she's okay.

1156
01:25:30,587 --> 01:25:33,624
You're joking, right?

1157
01:25:33,787 --> 01:25:35,505
She's the weakest of them all.
Hell, she told me.

1158
01:25:36,267 --> 01:25:39,304
But, Andy, the house is on fire.
We gotta go.

1159
01:25:41,107 --> 01:25:43,905
We better move fast.

1160
01:25:44,227 --> 01:25:45,945
Call her name.

1161
01:25:49,747 --> 01:25:51,180
- Ellie will come to you.
- Ellie!

1162
01:25:51,827 --> 01:25:53,624
Ellie! Hey, Andy,
we need to leave right now, okay?

1163
01:25:53,787 --> 01:25:56,938
Okay. You go wait for me outside.

1164
01:25:58,227 --> 01:26:01,424
- I'll take care of Ellie.
- Okay.

1165
01:26:02,467 --> 01:26:04,662
Go tell Ellie to meet me in the basement.

1166
01:26:17,707 --> 01:26:20,016
There's the team spirit.

1167
01:26:20,187 --> 01:26:22,064
Ellie?

1168
01:26:28,947 --> 01:26:30,016
Ellie, where are you?
Come on, come on.

1169
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,382
- What? What?
- Okay, we've got to get out of here now.

1170
01:26:34,547 --> 01:26:36,742
- Is it safe?
- No, it's not safe,

1171
01:26:36,907 --> 01:26:38,022
but it's not getting any safer.

1172
01:26:38,187 --> 01:26:39,256
What?

1173
01:26:39,427 --> 01:26:40,576
Why would you lie to me? Why?

1174
01:26:46,307 --> 01:26:48,218
Do you have any idea
what I've done to give you back your life?

1175
01:26:48,387 --> 01:26:50,742
Ellie, run!

1176
01:26:50,907 --> 01:26:52,181
I am very, very disappointed in you.

1177
01:26:58,507 --> 01:27:01,067
I pinned you, and you left.

1178
01:27:06,027 --> 01:27:07,858
I guess my cell phone
took a Greyhound out of town.

1179
01:27:08,027 --> 01:27:09,824
Yeah, good one.

1180
01:27:09,987 --> 01:27:11,420
Help! Ellie! Cassidy!

1181
01:27:16,787 --> 01:27:19,859
Help! It's Maggie! I'm trapped!

1182
01:27:20,347 --> 01:27:23,419
Help!

1183
01:27:26,387 --> 01:27:27,376
Help me!

1184
01:27:29,147 --> 01:27:30,341
Maggie!

1185
01:27:36,307 --> 01:27:37,422
- I'm trapped!
- Fuck. Okay.

1186
01:27:38,347 --> 01:27:40,258
- Okay, try and jump over.
- What?

1187
01:27:43,147 --> 01:27:45,456
I left your sister.
I'm not gonna leave you, too.

1188
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:47,618
Get the fuck over here.

1189
01:27:47,787 --> 01:27:49,505
Oh!

1190
01:27:49,667 --> 01:27:50,622
I'm getting goose bumps.

1191
01:27:50,947 --> 01:27:52,824
You might want to stay there, Maggie.

1192
01:27:55,227 --> 01:27:57,104
Out of the fire, into the tire iron.
Do you know what I mean?

1193
01:27:57,267 --> 01:27:59,622
Andy, leave her alone!

1194
01:27:59,787 --> 01:28:00,697
Come over here,
I'll be happy to kill you first.

1195
01:28:00,867 --> 01:28:03,381
Not to worry, Maggie.

1196
01:28:13,427 --> 01:28:15,145
What kind of guy would I be
if I let you burn to death?

1197
01:28:15,307 --> 01:28:18,663
- Andy, don't do this!
- Stop it! Just stop it!

1198
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:25,141
I will, but you need to stand perfectly still.

1199
01:28:25,307 --> 01:28:28,219
Hey.

1200
01:28:44,827 --> 01:28:45,862
Come on, Maggie!
Come on, get over! Come on.

1201
01:28:47,987 --> 01:28:51,457
- Maggie! Come on, come on, come on.
- Watch out!

1202
01:28:51,627 --> 01:28:55,063
Oh, my God! Get off of her!

1203
01:28:55,707 --> 01:28:58,267
Oh, fuck!

1204
01:29:09,707 --> 01:29:10,901
- Andy, please help me.
- I tried to help you.

1205
01:29:15,787 --> 01:29:18,540
You didn't want my help, remember?

1206
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:21,498
Do you know how many times
I tried to get you to tell me the truth?

1207
01:29:21,667 --> 01:29:24,227
I practically begged you.

1208
01:29:24,387 --> 01:29:26,139
But no.
You decided to protect your girlfriends.

1209
01:29:28,907 --> 01:29:32,183
I loved you so much, Cass.

1210
01:29:33,227 --> 01:29:35,377
I thought you were different.
But as it turns out, you were just the same.

1211
01:29:35,547 --> 01:29:39,335
Sisters till the end.

1212
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:41,259
Well, as this year's valedictorian,

1213
01:29:43,667 --> 01:29:46,579
- I guess it's time to say...
- Farewell, asshole.

1214
01:29:47,947 --> 01:29:50,939
Maggie, use the curtain to wrap yourself up.

1215
01:30:13,907 --> 01:30:16,740
Grab my hand.

1216
01:30:20,067 --> 01:30:21,466
I thought I told you to get out of here.

1217
01:30:34,227 --> 01:30:35,626
You did,
but then I thought, "What are sisters for?"

1218
01:30:35,787 --> 01:30:38,904
<i>Don't touch me, trust me</i>

1219
01:30:40,947 --> 01:30:43,381
<i>You disgust me</i>

1220
01:30:43,547 --> 01:30:44,866
<i>Tried to shove me
in your daddy's money</i>

1221
01:30:45,027 --> 01:30:48,906
<i>But I'm better on my own</i>

1222
01:30:49,067 --> 01:30:51,376
<i>I've got some things
that I do better on my own</i>

1223
01:30:51,787 --> 01:30:54,984
<i>I'll show you how
you turn my insides out</i>

1224
01:30:55,747 --> 01:31:00,218
<i>Get the hell away from me</i>

1225
01:31:00,467 --> 01:31:02,378
<i>It's an emergency</i>

1226
01:31:02,547 --> 01:31:04,902
<i>Turn me black and blue</i>

1227
01:31:05,307 --> 01:31:07,867
<i>Get the hell away from me</i>

1228
01:31:08,467 --> 01:31:10,423
<i>All of my friends agree</i>

1229
01:31:10,587 --> 01:31:12,657
<i>I gotta run away from you</i>

1230
01:31:12,827 --> 01:31:15,819
The house is clear.
Come on, let's go.

1231
01:31:20,587 --> 01:31:24,546
<i>Do you remember all we had?</i>

1232
01:31:37,027 --> 01:31:41,305
<i>How we loved It all</i>

1233
01:31:42,867 --> 01:31:45,779
<i>Such a perfect world</i>

1234
01:31:46,547 --> 01:31:49,345
<i>We trusted all</i>

1235
01:31:51,027 --> 01:31:53,825
Theta Pi says goodbye!
Theta Pi says goodbye!

1236
01:31:57,707 --> 01:32:00,426
Theta Pi says goodbye!
Theta Pi says goodbye!

1237
01:32:00,587 --> 01:32:03,579
Theta Pi says goodbye!
Theta Pi says goodbye!

1238
01:32:03,747 --> 01:32:06,580
Theta Pi says goodbye!
Theta Pi says goodbye!

1239
01:32:06,747 --> 01:32:09,784
<i>Don't push It
your bullshit don't phase me</i>

1240
01:32:27,707 --> 01:32:31,620
<i>You can cut me but I won't bleed baby</i>

<i>'Cause I'm better on my own</i>

1242
01:32:35,787 --> 01:32:38,426
<i>I've got some things
that I do better on my own</i>

1243
01:32:38,587 --> 01:32:42,421

<i>How we loved It all</i>

1250
01:33:09,627 --> 01:33:12,380

<i>Baby don't touch me, trust me
Don't touch me</i>

1255

<i>Baby don't touch me, trust me</i>

<i>Top down, hear the engine call</i>

1266
01:34:26,507 --> 01:34:29,260
<i>So cold, burning through the black</i>

<i>Walt up, daddy's coming back</i>

1268
01:34:32,427 --> 01:34:35,225
<i>You're so alone
Back at the door</i>

1269
01:34:35,387 --> 01:34:38,140
<i>I'm coming home
Back at the door</i>

1270
01:34:38,307 --> 01:34:41,060
<i>You need your fix
Back at the door</i>

1271
01:34:41,227 --> 01:34:44,060
<i>Gonna give you more</i>

1272
01:34:44,227 --> 01:34:47,299
<i>Coming down, gonna take you away</i>

<i>I'm the one you love, gonna take you away</i>

<i>This night won't wait for you</i>

1276
01:34:55,867 --> 01:34:58,745
<i>Every time I brake into the light
I glance a moment in your eyes</i>

<i>I can taste your cries</i>
