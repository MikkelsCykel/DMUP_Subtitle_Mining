1
00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:19,457
Long ago in another galaxy far, far away...

2
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:26,020
Let us rock and roll with the Fat Man.
Here Fats...

3
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:32,408
Miss Givens drives me crazy.

4
00:01:33,363 --> 00:01:37,069
If she holds my pipe I'm 35
the high school as I did.

5
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:40,824
I do not care,
as I sit by Marilyn Mc Cauly.

6
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,976
Forget it, Jonathan.

7
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:47,207
You sat her down last year,
all you did was drool.

8
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,415
You're funny Harry.
I've never had the chance.

9
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,889
The word, if we are to unif.

10
00:01:54,807 --> 00:01:58,922
Here's your chance loverboy,
there is Marilyn and Rosalie.

11
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:02,602
Come on Jonathan, not ruining it.
You're with your dad his car...

12
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:04,702
Say something.

13
00:02:05,047 --> 00:02:07,172
I can not.
- No guts, huh?

14
00:02:07,785 --> 00:02:10,930
Look at those Jugs,
They defy gravity.

15
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,890
We're dead.

16
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:31,776
I had no idea it was
going to be so much fun.

17
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:33,876
Rosalie, come inside.

18
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:37,718
The water feels so good.

19
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:04,986
It does not matter so much.

20
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:07,431
I see you, Jonathan.

21
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:40,511
1001, 1002.

22
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:45,079
2000.

23
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:47,824
Do not do that.

24
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Turn that thing off.

25
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Where did he come from?

26
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:25,551
Oh, my God.

27
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:29,691
Okay, dude?

28
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,569
You came all of a sudden.
- Yes, I did.

29
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:34,669
Are you ok?

30
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,001
Yes.

31
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,709
I'm okay.

32
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:48,082
Kenny do something, he's ok.

33
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:54,290
He's hurt.
- Get in the car, he has nothing.

34
00:05:56,611 --> 00:05:58,991
Everything cool, no problem.

35
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:03,742
Take care.

36
00:06:14,894 --> 00:06:19,059
It was his mistake.
He came from behind the truck.

37
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:24,854
He also drove across the grass.
- He has more pieces.

38
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,270
I'm Jonathan Bellah I live next door.

39
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:39,189
From where are you?
- Chicago.

40
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,770
Are you serious?

41
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,625
Give me the hex again.

42
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
I said 'hex'.

43
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:03,802
Got something on wheels?

44
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:05,037
What?

45
00:07:05,137 --> 00:07:07,137
Need a car?

46
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:10,787
No, not yet.
- How do you decorate?

47
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,155
Dad lends me his car sometimes.

48
00:07:14,787 --> 00:07:17,422
What does he have?
- Studebaker.

49
00:07:17,911 --> 00:07:20,376
Girls do not in a Studebaker.

50
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:24,139
Not?
- Chevy's, Ford are the best.

51
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:28,041
But a Studebaker?
Is worse than a Desoto.

52
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:35,602
What about the girls?

53
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:37,877
Are there?

54
00:07:39,953 --> 00:07:42,672
All at the fair.

55
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,958
So it is.
I would not find them.

56
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:48,497
I understand what you mean.

57
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:51,164
I do not think you do.

58
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:57,477
I have to stay out of trouble.

59
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:59,681
Why?

60
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:03,216
I may not enjoy school anymore.

61
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,611
Have you put out at school?

62
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:07,448
Hoedat?

63
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:09,548
I fucked two.

64
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:14,091
Come on.
- The moms were complaining.

65
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:16,341
I was out.

66
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,599
Unbelievable.

67
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:21,736
You've never been binned?

68
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:24,190
What?
- You've never had any contact?

69
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,795
I am not a freak or anything.
Not freak, weird though.

70
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:30,928
I had the chance yet.

71
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:34,266
Is there someone you like?
- Yes.

72
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,289
Maybe.
- What's her name?

73
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:40,148
Marilyn Mc Cauley.

74
00:08:40,464 --> 00:08:42,131
And?

75
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,441
She does not know I exist.

76
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:58,961
Good throw.

77
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,935
The fair, where is him?
- Tonight.

78
00:09:08,141 --> 00:09:10,141
I'll take you.

79
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,483
<Verdrink A leraar. >.

80
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:24,967
What a small village.

81
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:33,040
Your dad sure the flag every morning heist
and your mom make pie every Sunday.

82
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,520
My mom does not bake, yours?

83
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:37,835
I have no mother.

84
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:39,901
Sorry.

85
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:42,769
Okay kid, come get it.

86
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:45,239
I want a real kiss for one euro.

87
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:46,936
Marilyn Mc Cauley is here.

88
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:48,244
With my brother.

89
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,420
Watch out for that tongue.

90
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
Brunette?
- The blonde.

91
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,427
You have competitors.

92
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:00,984
Go home.
- Jonathan Day.

93
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:03,885
Rosalie Day.
Hey Marilyn.

94
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,730
You got me.

95
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:32,443
Thanks Jonathan,
this was for a good cause.

96
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:34,543
I am very happy.

97
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:36,617
My turn now.

98
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:38,952
Turn it.

99
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,950
You have Marilyn.

100
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,159
Are you ready?

101
00:11:03,257 --> 00:11:04,871
Thank you for your donation.

102
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:06,971
It was my pleasure.

103
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,867
Do you have money?

104
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:14,239
You have quite a nerve.

105
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:17,745
That kiss lasted three times
longer than normal.

106
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,820
I can put her feelings do not hurt?

107
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:23,033
I have 50 cents.

108
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,723
I took 6.

109
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:30,033
Who do you get back.
- Hey.

110
00:11:34,538 --> 00:11:36,538
You have Bunny.

111
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,942
We met al
- I know.

112
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:06,581
I heard ringing.

113
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,630
It is over there.

114
00:12:09,953 --> 00:12:12,261
No, from here.

115
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:16,328
I see you.

116
00:12:18,098 --> 00:12:20,098
Now I've had enough.

117
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,333
Who is he?

118
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,476
I do not know.

119
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:29,255
Day.

120
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:32,544
Village idiot?

121
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:35,716
Oh, yeah.
He is also good at it too.

122
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,475
His dad has Brubaker.
- What is that?

123
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:42,175
The biggest clothes store in Nelsonville.

124
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:44,275
And he goes with Bunny?

125
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:46,477
What a waste.

126
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:49,324
What a waste.

127
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,998
So, you never loved one?

128
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:57,552
I bet you score within the month.

129
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,652
With marilyn.

130
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:02,916
Why are you so docile with my sex life?

131
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:06,702
To combat boredom.
So I stay out of trouble.

132
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:11,168
It is a challenge you know, a good thing.

133
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:14,941
Thanks, but no.

134
00:13:15,557 --> 00:13:18,872
Find it for yourself.
Do you have money?

135
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:08,071
Good morning.
- Good morning.

136
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:14,126
I've been thinking about your bet.
- Yes?

137
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,445
What are my chances?
- You have quite confident in yourself.

138
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:23,717
Jump to it.

139
00:14:59,974 --> 00:15:04,181
Rule number 1:
make eye contact every chance you have.

140
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:08,720
What if they look away?
- Keep staring, your eyelids down.

141
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,030
Then it seems you smarter.

142
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:15,357
Oh yeah?
- Like James Dean in 'East Of Eden'.

143
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,791
Like this?

144
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,955
This never works.

145
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,558
I can practice.

146
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:35,010
Where did you get the jeans from?

147
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:39,307
You have exactly one
luggage in your pants.

148
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:42,090
My mom, she has achieved.
- Shrink.

149
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,255
Why?
- So your balls bulge.

150
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,430
You have to look hot.

151
00:15:50,497 --> 00:15:54,106
Girls have no balls.
So they are curious.

152
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:56,332
Is it so?

153
00:15:56,432 --> 00:15:59,788
Occasionally they look to check.

154
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,513
Do you have a handkerchief?
- Yes.

155
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:06,613
Put it in your pants.

156
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:10,755
Here is Marilyn.

157
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:15,445
Do not stand there like a sissy.
Lean against the wall.

158
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,313
Everything OK, Jonathan?

159
00:16:23,803 --> 00:16:25,803
Just a cramp.

160
00:16:30,096 --> 00:16:33,071
This becomes harder than I thought.

161
00:16:57,426 --> 00:16:59,426
Why the rush?

162
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:03,777
No hurry, Kenny.
I was just the first.

163
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:05,877
Slow down, live longer.

164
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:10,428
Here's a little bit for you.

165
00:17:12,888 --> 00:17:15,108
Let the bastard if not tease you.

166
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,208
Easy for you to say.

167
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:25,715
Let now the title bar
discussion of our government.

168
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:31,865
Eg. If President Eisenhower died in August.
We all know who follow him.

169
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:35,075
Is not it?
- Nixon.

170
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:36,355
Exactly.

171
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:42,660
What happens if they both die?

172
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:45,186
The Communists.

173
00:17:46,913 --> 00:17:48,597
Not true, Kenny.

174
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:52,692
Not even the Democrats.
- Is there a difference?

175
00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:59,264
It maybe funny to you, now.
But our constitution provides for a line...

176
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:03,652
That's a difference to the
democracy and dictatorship.

177
00:18:03,752 --> 00:18:07,081
When a dictator dies is
that the people hard.

178
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:09,181
Very difficult.

179
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:12,015
Now, the question is.
- I die.

180
00:18:12,302 --> 00:18:15,268
I have a hard that does not break.

181
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,684
and if both presidents die?
Who follows?

182
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,983
Yes, Rosalie.

183
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,823
The spokesman of the
White House, Joe Martin.

184
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,961
And as Joe Martin dies?
Who follows?

185
00:18:30,381 --> 00:18:32,421
No Rosalie,
someone else.

186
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:36,832
Jonathan?

187
00:18:37,726 --> 00:18:39,726
What haunts you from?

188
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,395
Nothing, ma'am.
I just took my pencil.

189
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,710
Certainly, Jonathan.

190
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:52,385
Explain to the class once from
what we just explained...

191
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:55,254
...about the title line of our government.

192
00:18:55,354 --> 00:19:00,813
Well... if Eisenhower would die...
- Get up, Jonathan.

193
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:09,559
Eh... I can not.

194
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:13,066
Why not?
- My leg is asleep.

195
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:16,943
Stand up and put your weight on it.

196
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,586
I can not.
- Why not?

197
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:23,519
My other leg also sleep.

198
00:19:24,842 --> 00:19:26,882
Stand up and massage 'm.

199
00:19:36,103 --> 00:19:38,568
Put down the books, Jonathan.

200
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:00,347
Here she comes,
just in time.

201
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:05,198
I can not.
- Where's your sense of adventure?

202
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:07,690
Hiding behind my fear of shame.

203
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,581
You have nothing to lose but your virginity.

204
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:13,302
I'm used to it after 17 years.

205
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Is everything okay?

206
00:20:41,546 --> 00:20:44,521
Your blood, I have no handkerchief.

207
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:46,591
I do.

208
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:09,862
Why did you do that?

209
00:21:09,962 --> 00:21:13,532
I'm sorry. I did not see what I was doing.

210
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,991
My first chest.

211
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:28,138
Thank you said
- That's nothing.

212
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:30,645
You go the whole ride.

213
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,311
Have they no Elvis?

214
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,896
Sir Hugh will not.

215
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:05,632
What are you doing?
- I know a better version of the song.

216
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:15,346
Do you love rock and roll?
- And some classical.

217
00:22:15,446 --> 00:22:18,676
My father played for The Chicago band.

218
00:22:20,442 --> 00:22:22,442
It swings.

219
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Where's your boyfriend?

220
00:22:26,365 --> 00:22:28,365
Kenny?

221
00:22:30,342 --> 00:22:32,342
We're not serious.

222
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,490
Really? He thinks so.

223
00:22:36,811 --> 00:22:40,636
I think I'll go back to my friends.
- See you.

224
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,619
Two hamburgers...

225
00:22:51,684 --> 00:22:53,734
...And two frits.

226
00:22:56,219 --> 00:22:57,898
Thank you, Rosalie.

227
00:22:57,998 --> 00:23:00,712
It's okay.
- Do you...

228
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:04,569
...The reading list of all Ohio?

229
00:23:04,637 --> 00:23:06,307
I think so.

230
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:10,466
Need 'In The Cathur Reye' already read?
- No.

231
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:13,612
I do not like baseball stories.

232
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:19,961
Rosalie, pick up.

233
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:38,235
So there you are. hey.

234
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:43,887
You feeling better?
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

235
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,198
Nelsonville be annoying
are compared with Chicago?

236
00:23:49,298 --> 00:23:51,298
Yes, a little bit.

237
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:55,632
Have you 'Rebel Without a Cause seen?
- Twice.

238
00:23:55,732 --> 00:23:58,132
Do you want him again?

239
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:01,327
He plays on the drive-in.
I want to go with you.

240
00:24:01,427 --> 00:24:04,378
Yes, good idea.
- Here's my number.

241
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,805
So Saturday night.

242
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:25,535
I understood that correctly?

243
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:27,635
I had no idea.

244
00:24:28,143 --> 00:24:30,895
She asked you out?

245
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:35,102
I could not say no
- She asked you out.

246
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:39,050
You bastard.
- Jonathan, come outside.

247
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
She was for me.

248
00:24:50,982 --> 00:24:53,818
I have to tell you anyway
I was planning on her.

249
00:24:53,918 --> 00:24:56,638
Stay calm, Jonathan.
If I say no?

250
00:24:57,093 --> 00:24:59,606
We now have at least control of it.

251
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,447
We know where she is,
what she does.

252
00:25:02,547 --> 00:25:06,249
I want nothing to do with you.
- I do not touch her.

253
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:08,349
I want bunny, remember?

254
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:12,468
Swear.
Swear that your hair does not touch.

255
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:18,258
Listen to me, I have a plan.
Bunny you ask for the drive-in.

256
00:25:18,358 --> 00:25:21,101
Yes, and I'm Elvis Presley.

257
00:25:41,747 --> 00:25:44,807
Are you sure that Kenny is not here?

258
00:25:44,894 --> 00:25:48,886
Kenny owns me.
- You're pretty brave.

259
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:54,096
Shut up if he hears you I'm embarrassed.

260
00:26:18,363 --> 00:26:22,507
Hey Gene, where we exchange?
- Stay calm, later.

261
00:26:29,783 --> 00:26:32,333
It is so sad about James Dean.

262
00:26:32,821 --> 00:26:36,901
Live fast and die young.
And good-looking corpse.

263
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:39,841
Gene, you are so absurd.

264
00:26:40,747 --> 00:26:42,874
Why I love you so.

265
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:55,995
Lights on.

266
00:26:58,148 --> 00:27:00,148
Damn.

267
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:16,708
I'm so sorry Gene.

268
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,957
Oh Jonathan,
it's just a movie.

269
00:27:41,484 --> 00:27:45,955
It's break time.
So hurry, hurry you.

270
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,298
I'm thirsty.

271
00:27:48,578 --> 00:27:51,043
Jonathan, do you want a Coke?

272
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,440
Yes.
- Get me one.

273
00:27:58,081 --> 00:28:00,407
For me a shake.
- Me too.

274
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:05,009
You come along.

275
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:15,406
What a piece.

276
00:28:15,555 --> 00:28:17,555
He is ok.

277
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,821
How's Jonathan?

278
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:21,999
Very good.

279
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:29,383
Can not we go bowling or something?
- Why?

280
00:28:29,483 --> 00:28:33,223
Because the waiver is yours to see her kiss.

281
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,677
Do you think I am happy
Bunny behind you?

282
00:28:35,777 --> 00:28:37,777
They in no danger.

283
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
Going somewhere?

284
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:45,280
What do you think you are?
- It's about me and puistenkop.

285
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,657
Keep your outside.

286
00:28:46,757 --> 00:28:48,757
Oh no, it's Kenny.

287
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:57,060
Do not be so Kenny.
- Shut up bunny.

288
00:28:58,134 --> 00:29:01,602
Did you score?
- Walk to the pump Kenny.

289
00:29:07,674 --> 00:29:09,674
Let him asshole.

290
00:29:09,877 --> 00:29:11,343
Shut up.

291
00:29:11,443 --> 00:29:13,443
He took them not.
I was.

292
00:29:13,915 --> 00:29:15,915
You took her out?

293
00:29:19,006 --> 00:29:21,641
Want something out of it maybe?

294
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:27,521
Yes.

295
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,202
Do you know where the old mill?
- I like it.

296
00:29:32,302 --> 00:29:35,558
See you in 15 minutes there.
- Ok.

297
00:29:40,121 --> 00:29:42,246
Bunny Come, come with me.

298
00:29:44,128 --> 00:29:46,128
I said, come on.

299
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,540
I better go.

300
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:52,509
But do not get lost, Eugene.

301
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,759
I wait for you.

302
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,619
Exciting.
As the movie.

303
00:30:22,456 --> 00:30:25,919
I thought you had no guts.
- Let's begin.

304
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:29,985
Have you heard of the coward-Race?

305
00:30:30,085 --> 00:30:32,085
I've heard.

306
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:35,954
100 meters you turn back
left tire on the white stripe.

307
00:30:36,054 --> 00:30:39,199
The first that comes off is a coward.

308
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:43,092
Do you play a lot?

309
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,285
Always.
- Liar, you never play.

310
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:50,423
Listen, I do not.
- A little bit of fun.

311
00:30:50,872 --> 00:30:54,017
Eugene wants his luck a little force.

312
00:31:43,343 --> 00:31:45,151
Go fuck.

313
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:47,251
Oh shit.

314
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:08,128
Are you okay?
- Gene, are you okay?

315
00:32:13,629 --> 00:32:15,629
Kenny, you okay?

316
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,574
Asshole.

317
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:53,888
Come to the car.

318
00:32:56,577 --> 00:32:58,577
Come on, Bunny.

319
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:01,776
I kill you.

320
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:31,343
That car was my income.

321
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:36,598
How do I work?

322
00:33:36,987 --> 00:33:39,049
Go inside.

323
00:33:56,071 --> 00:33:59,014
Does he go to school today?
- I do not know.

324
00:33:59,114 --> 00:34:02,599
I have knocked on the door but no answer.

325
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:23,103
Move around, Jonathan.

326
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,190
Want to talk?

327
00:34:25,824 --> 00:34:27,824
Get out.

328
00:34:48,616 --> 00:34:50,616
Listen damn.

329
00:34:50,995 --> 00:34:57,014
I had an appointment with 'r.
- Forget it now.

330
00:34:57,726 --> 00:34:59,733
I do not forget.

331
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:04,716
If you do not open I break my neck.

332
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:16,829
Thank you.

333
00:35:20,224 --> 00:35:22,224
Very funny.

334
00:35:24,285 --> 00:35:25,740
House arrest.

335
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Except school.

336
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:34,391
Want some?

337
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:57,272
This is good stuff.

338
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:01,513
You must be accustomed to.

339
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:04,363
You need to simmer down.

340
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:16,971
He had no right me store for everyone.

341
00:36:21,537 --> 00:36:23,537
For bunny.

342
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:28,039
Let's go.

343
00:37:02,827 --> 00:37:06,127
Do you know how to run?
- Shit, yes.

344
00:37:10,082 --> 00:37:12,173
What did I do?

345
00:37:12,587 --> 00:37:14,967
Do sober and go to the side.

346
00:37:28,972 --> 00:37:32,353
Which one of you drove?
- Ikke.

347
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:36,455
Great. Stand up.

348
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:45,666
Marc Bellah is not your father?
- Yes, sir.

349
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:50,293
You know that your dad on the street, now?
- No, sir.

350
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:55,619
Shame on you.

351
00:37:58,418 --> 00:38:02,581
Normally I throw you in jail.
Only that I did not love klikspanen.

352
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:04,681
You know what guys?

353
00:38:04,736 --> 00:38:07,711
Take your motorcycle.
And walk home.

354
00:38:08,211 --> 00:38:10,547
Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.

355
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:23,457
Can you run?
- Shit, yes.

356
00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:45,646
That was nice.

357
00:39:07,134 --> 00:39:11,109
Do not you feel bad when you
before someone does something?

358
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:13,209
Kenny do you mean?

359
00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:15,451
No idiot.
My dad.

360
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:20,563
He's hard and stuff.

361
00:39:22,438 --> 00:39:24,438
But it's not my fault.

362
00:39:24,532 --> 00:39:28,101
Have you already agree
with him talking about it?

363
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:29,716
Yes.

364
00:39:29,816 --> 00:39:31,816
No.

365
00:39:33,023 --> 00:39:36,253
When my mom died crept him in a shell.

366
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:38,506
He could not stomach.

367
00:39:39,887 --> 00:39:41,927
When I got into trouble.

368
00:39:42,785 --> 00:39:44,550
Truancy.

369
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,394
Autos borrow. Stupidities.

370
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:52,528
He then began to rattle me.

371
00:39:53,538 --> 00:39:55,538
Next time I knock back.

372
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,150
It was not your fault.

373
00:40:03,128 --> 00:40:06,358
He has stopped playing to me to watch.

374
00:40:06,497 --> 00:40:08,622
That was the final straw.

375
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:12,843
Do not worry.

376
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:16,171
Next year you are on the unif.

377
00:40:16,778 --> 00:40:19,855
Then you worry.
- Are you mold?

378
00:40:20,572 --> 00:40:22,572
I'm not made for unif.

379
00:40:23,282 --> 00:40:25,282
Why not?

380
00:40:25,514 --> 00:40:28,761
What would you be?
Dentist as your father?

381
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:31,496
I take his practice time, Gene.

382
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,704
Exactly.
- What's wrong with it?

383
00:40:35,346 --> 00:40:37,404
Nothing.

384
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:42,758
You're not the world's largest
seducer, Jonathan...

385
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:45,323
You need at least one family.

386
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:48,120
You can have my brother.

387
00:40:50,446 --> 00:40:52,446
Thanks friend.

388
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:05,432
This is Kenny's shop his family?

389
00:41:05,532 --> 00:41:08,337
The largest store in Nelsonville.

390
00:41:11,877 --> 00:41:13,877
What will you do now?

391
00:41:14,947 --> 00:41:17,107
Just wait.

392
00:41:59,858 --> 00:42:02,918
I love this store.
What a collection.

393
00:42:14,695 --> 00:42:16,764
See you at school.

394
00:42:33,697 --> 00:42:35,962
You okay?
- Sure.

395
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:41,490
I was worried.
I wanted to call you.

396
00:42:45,215 --> 00:42:47,215
No problem.

397
00:42:48,871 --> 00:42:52,016
I wanted to let you know what I felt.

398
00:43:05,097 --> 00:43:07,097
I want to see.

399
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:09,959
Tonight?

400
00:43:11,316 --> 00:43:15,523
I'll be better for you.
- Yes.

401
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,710
Marilyn Day.

402
00:43:44,921 --> 00:43:47,980
What does this mean?
- I want to save for my dad's car.

403
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,080
Great.

404
00:43:51,432 --> 00:43:56,219
House arrest is over?
- If I did I must go home.

405
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,838
I saw you with Bunny in the hall.

406
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:04,085
Now you have no fear of Kenny?
- I have no fear of that idiot.

407
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:08,605
Gene, keep your eye on the matter here?
Jonathan Day.

408
00:44:09,586 --> 00:44:13,526
What you gonna do with Marilyn?

409
00:44:14,353 --> 00:44:18,879
Forget it.
We tried, eh?

410
00:44:19,906 --> 00:44:21,496
As for the bet?

411
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:23,293
Admit it.

412
00:44:23,393 --> 00:44:26,886
They need me.
I am the dreamer type.

413
00:44:29,387 --> 00:44:32,617
Would you like an idiot all your life?

414
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:37,679
I'm not an idiot, Eugene.

415
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:40,303
Really?

416
00:44:45,496 --> 00:44:47,496
See this?

417
00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:53,194
I put him on the phone Marilyn and I'll call.

418
00:44:53,773 --> 00:44:57,365
I ask her for an appointment.
They will of course refuse.

419
00:44:57,465 --> 00:45:02,099
They humiliated me that snow white again.
But maybe, maybe...

420
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,061
...Leave me alone.

421
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:27,768
Marilyn Day, will you Saturday
with me to the movies?

422
00:45:28,546 --> 00:45:31,041
Oh, Mrs. Mc Cauley?

423
00:45:32,451 --> 00:45:35,851
Would you possibly take me to the movie?

424
00:45:35,997 --> 00:45:39,283
No no, it was just a joke.

425
00:45:40,926 --> 00:45:43,143
Marilyn Can I speak?

426
00:45:58,532 --> 00:46:00,532
She said...

427
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,649
Yes.

428
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:06,181
Yes.
I play so bad.

429
00:46:06,328 --> 00:46:08,328
She said yes?

430
00:46:08,681 --> 00:46:11,571
Remember boy.
You have to progress.

431
00:46:11,638 --> 00:46:13,848
What does that mean again?

432
00:46:14,363 --> 00:46:16,363
You have to hit.

433
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:18,521
Them?

434
00:46:18,621 --> 00:46:21,664
You have to hit.

435
00:46:31,504 --> 00:46:34,564
Honey, can you bring me some coffee?

436
00:47:12,671 --> 00:47:16,666
We go to church tomorrow.
I need an early start.

437
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:21,690
Good night.

438
00:47:22,233 --> 00:47:24,233
Not so early.

439
00:47:54,194 --> 00:47:56,500
We would rather keep for another time.

440
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,575
Say good night your friend Marilyn.

441
00:48:00,033 --> 00:48:01,480
Good night.

442
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,580
Good night.

443
00:48:20,252 --> 00:48:22,252
Hi, honey.

444
00:48:23,964 --> 00:48:26,206
Kenny came along and you missed him.

445
00:48:26,306 --> 00:48:30,726
Where were you?
- I was studying French with Rosalie.

446
00:48:31,123 --> 00:48:33,123
We have a key.

447
00:48:33,886 --> 00:48:37,606
Just go to sleep.
Sleep well.

448
00:48:58,512 --> 00:49:00,512
Not so fast.

449
00:49:00,675 --> 00:49:02,724
What?

450
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,815
come here.

451
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:11,012
what?

452
00:49:20,949 --> 00:49:23,614
You're crazy.
Where are we?

453
00:49:55,077 --> 00:49:57,669
Come 'ns flat pants here.

454
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:42,041
Unbelievable.

455
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:46,867
That's not fair.

456
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,913
Wait a minute.

457
00:51:29,335 --> 00:51:31,812
You see that horse?
This is a Quatermain.

458
00:51:31,912 --> 00:51:33,207
Ready to jump.

459
00:51:33,307 --> 00:51:34,444
How do you know?

460
00:51:34,544 --> 00:51:37,094
Strong hind legs, long stride.

461
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:41,764
How do you know so much about horses?

462
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:43,864
My mom drove.

463
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:48,104
In the stables...

464
00:51:52,021 --> 00:51:54,021
...I want to help.

465
00:51:55,306 --> 00:51:57,516
It depends how you ask me.

466
00:52:08,104 --> 00:52:10,739
Where are Jonathan and Marilyn?

467
00:52:12,507 --> 00:52:14,636
Jonathan.
- Yes?

468
00:52:16,274 --> 00:52:20,111
Not here, we should stop.
- Okay, okay.

469
00:52:22,902 --> 00:52:25,562
I mean stop.
- I'm stopping.

470
00:52:30,695 --> 00:52:34,555
Jonathan, pull back.
- No, not yet.

471
00:52:41,008 --> 00:52:43,694
Jonathan the horn.
- Sorry.

472
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:57,697
There are people.
- They do not look.

473
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:02,232
I must not let...
- You must, you should.

474
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,025
It's enough now Jonathan.
Do not remember.

475
00:53:07,994 --> 00:53:10,145
But it feels so good.

476
00:53:11,263 --> 00:53:15,636
Jonathan, where are your hands?
- They fell off.

477
00:53:16,056 --> 00:53:19,209
Do not weak.
- I admit that I am weak.

478
00:53:29,759 --> 00:53:33,584
You put your hand in my pants.
- Do not worry.

479
00:53:37,842 --> 00:53:41,629
They come back anytime.
- It's alright.

480
00:53:46,906 --> 00:53:48,524
We can not continue.

481
00:53:48,624 --> 00:53:51,631
Please Marilyn, it is already 17 years ago.

482
00:53:51,731 --> 00:53:53,731
Let me go.

483
00:53:57,727 --> 00:54:00,552
I said, let me go.

484
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:15,190
You need to make that door.
Somebody might fail.

485
00:54:16,064 --> 00:54:19,124
What do you want?
It is a Studebaker.

486
00:54:37,196 --> 00:54:39,406
What you did was indecent.

487
00:54:40,462 --> 00:54:42,462
I know.

488
00:54:45,108 --> 00:54:47,108
Here.

489
00:54:55,509 --> 00:54:57,509
Jonathan?
- Yes?

490
00:54:59,252 --> 00:55:04,136
You do not look dangerous.
While you're well.

491
00:55:06,287 --> 00:55:09,092
My parents are away this weekend.

492
00:55:28,316 --> 00:55:30,316
Jonathan day.

493
00:55:31,743 --> 00:55:35,143
I have a headache, find mind if I afzeg?

494
00:55:36,593 --> 00:55:38,593
Cancel?

495
00:55:40,009 --> 00:55:42,009
Just kidding.

496
00:55:42,101 --> 00:55:44,189
Come here.
Hurry.

497
00:56:04,107 --> 00:56:08,532
I dribble towards the goal and go score.

498
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:32,354
I got everything from Elisabeth
Taylor his publications.

499
00:56:34,946 --> 00:56:37,335
Then you have lots of books.

500
00:56:39,086 --> 00:56:45,801
Remember the scene in Montgomery Cliff
Elizabeth Taylor and 'Place In The Sun?'.

501
00:56:58,396 --> 00:57:01,371
Are you sure your parents are gone?

502
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,817
Far away.

503
00:59:10,942 --> 00:59:14,141
Jonathan?
- Yes?

504
00:59:18,724 --> 00:59:20,724
Do you not like?

505
00:59:24,877 --> 00:59:26,877
Of course.

506
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:51,298
Do you do anything?

507
00:59:52,912 --> 00:59:54,912
I had to just take off.

508
00:59:56,103 --> 00:59:58,694
I mean a contraceptive.

509
01:00:00,238 --> 01:00:03,968
Do not you?
- No.

510
01:00:09,196 --> 01:00:14,006
I thought you was useless.
- What do you think?

511
01:00:18,087 --> 01:00:23,246
Ok then, we can.
But not the whole way.

512
01:00:39,573 --> 01:00:44,758
I'm a bit of it stabbing
and get out before something happens.

513
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:46,830
Promise?
- I promise.

514
01:00:46,957 --> 01:00:49,134
Swear you?
- I swear.

515
01:01:01,138 --> 01:01:05,607
You are incorrect.
- Sorry, I'm aiming.

516
01:01:11,493 --> 01:01:13,493
Better?

517
01:01:20,847 --> 01:01:25,077
Remember your promise.
- Yes, certainly.

518
01:01:25,498 --> 01:01:28,121
Do not forget.
- Not at all.

519
01:01:40,469 --> 01:01:42,801
Go away.

520
01:01:43,896 --> 01:01:46,044
Herbie, get out.

521
01:02:14,423 --> 01:02:17,294
You came, right?

522
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:21,310
You did not removed.

523
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:25,438
I was planning.
- The whole time in it?

524
01:02:32,113 --> 01:02:35,081
We have never talked about.

525
01:02:36,971 --> 01:02:41,136
I thought you would think I
a freak when I was a rubber omdeed.

526
01:02:41,236 --> 01:02:44,336
Montgomery cliff would certainly not to do.

527
01:02:44,436 --> 01:02:46,436
What are you so naive.

528
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,380
I'm sorry.

529
01:02:57,031 --> 01:02:59,666
I did not spoil the first time.

530
01:03:01,769 --> 01:03:05,764
Nobody has ever said
that this is my first time.

531
01:03:13,453 --> 01:03:15,961
Something happened.
They're back.

532
01:03:16,061 --> 01:03:18,061
They're back?

533
01:03:22,983 --> 01:03:25,119
The back.
- I'm not.

534
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,200
Quick quick.
Hurry.

535
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:39,366
Marilyn, are you home?
- Yeah, Dad, is there anything happening?

536
01:03:39,466 --> 01:03:42,666
Your mom forgot the wedding gift.
Can you imagine?

537
01:03:42,766 --> 01:03:44,766
Maybe.

538
01:03:49,758 --> 01:03:52,120
Under the bed.
- No.

539
01:03:53,234 --> 01:03:54,435
The cabinet.
- No.

540
01:03:54,535 --> 01:03:56,535
Out the window.

541
01:04:00,321 --> 01:04:02,321
I think it is up.

542
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:11,348
Go, go.

543
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:18,898
Hi, honey.
- Daddy Day.

544
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:21,692
Get bored?
- A little.

545
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:23,792
I see you.

546
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,940
Mrs. Mc Cauley day.

547
01:04:45,832 --> 01:04:48,009
Goodbye Mrs. Mc Cauley.

548
01:04:48,712 --> 01:04:50,712
Harold.

549
01:04:52,863 --> 01:04:54,863
Darn.

550
01:05:01,978 --> 01:05:04,273
Ok Eugene.
It does not hurt.

551
01:05:16,844 --> 01:05:18,844
Next.

552
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,470
What is it?
- Does nothing.

553
01:05:22,791 --> 01:05:25,169
See you tonight?
- Can not.

554
01:05:27,795 --> 01:05:31,124
Tomorrow. Absolutely.

555
01:05:46,563 --> 01:05:48,618
I need the toilet.

556
01:06:41,152 --> 01:06:43,148
How nice to see you,
my boy.

557
01:06:43,248 --> 01:06:46,138
Come in and make yourself at home.

558
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:50,666
Look who's here.

559
01:06:50,836 --> 01:06:52,836
Hi Kenny.

560
01:06:53,945 --> 01:06:58,450
Bunny is at the top of it to do.
She'll be right down.

561
01:06:58,587 --> 01:07:00,587
I put these in water.

562
01:07:01,423 --> 01:07:03,994
Sit down.

563
01:07:50,089 --> 01:07:51,104
Gene, what's up?

564
01:07:51,204 --> 01:07:54,350
How was the dinner with
your parents last night?

565
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:57,049
It was my parents idea.
I knew nothing.

566
01:07:57,149 --> 01:07:59,810
You think I do?
- Yes. I do.

567
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:02,644
You think I lie to you?

568
01:08:03,286 --> 01:08:07,535
No, sorry.
- I hated all the sneaking too tired.

569
01:08:08,147 --> 01:08:10,667
I know.
It will be okay.

570
01:08:11,018 --> 01:08:16,964
If I got one million, then I pass
the front door like a bastard from Kenny.

571
01:08:17,064 --> 01:08:20,362
Why now an issue of it.
We just hurt their feelings.

572
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:24,087
Ocharme, Mom and Dad.
- Stay reasonable Gene.

573
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:26,957
I'm unreasonable? Great.

574
01:08:39,501 --> 01:08:40,372
I gotta go.

575
01:08:40,472 --> 01:08:42,472
Jonathan?

576
01:08:42,906 --> 01:08:45,082
You can tell a user with days.

577
01:08:45,182 --> 01:08:48,018
I thought you were mad at me?
- No, my parents.

578
01:08:48,118 --> 01:08:50,792
I called you but never got answer.

579
01:08:50,892 --> 01:08:58,824
We can make it right.
The gala is about 6 weeks.

580
01:09:00,073 --> 01:09:02,335
How fortunate I am free.

581
01:09:02,735 --> 01:09:04,735
Oh yeah?

582
01:09:08,002 --> 01:09:10,002
Day.

583
01:09:28,712 --> 01:09:30,712
$ 1.

584
01:09:48,295 --> 01:09:50,295
Can a little faster?

585
01:09:52,854 --> 01:09:54,894
We have not got all day.

586
01:10:02,457 --> 01:10:04,612
You've missed a spot.

587
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,660
Good boy.

588
01:10:11,345 --> 01:10:13,385
This is one U.S. dollar.

589
01:10:14,031 --> 01:10:16,031
Turn on the account.

590
01:10:16,798 --> 01:10:19,093
Check the tires every post.

591
01:10:24,574 --> 01:10:26,574
Thank you.

592
01:10:32,498 --> 01:10:34,498
Guess.

593
01:10:35,126 --> 01:10:37,676
I go to the gala with Merilyn.

594
01:10:38,278 --> 01:10:41,286
She asked me.
- Fantastic.

595
01:10:42,315 --> 01:10:47,500
You should go get her for me.
Her parents think I'm oversexed.

596
01:10:48,032 --> 01:10:51,584
Have you already asked Bunny?
- I want to talk about it.

597
01:10:51,684 --> 01:10:53,684
What do you get?

598
01:10:56,075 --> 01:10:58,075
What is the service?

599
01:11:02,077 --> 01:11:04,077
The usual.

600
01:11:07,945 --> 01:11:09,778
Check it out.

601
01:11:09,878 --> 01:11:12,190
Dinner for two.

602
01:11:19,325 --> 01:11:26,102
Kenny Say, are not you going to Bunny?
- Again? Were you not there yesterday?

603
01:11:26,391 --> 01:11:29,026
I've been a part of the family.

604
01:11:29,793 --> 01:11:31,280
That's 95 cents.

605
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:33,051
Keep the rest.

606
01:11:33,151 --> 01:11:35,151
Thank you.

607
01:11:37,299 --> 01:11:41,141
Apropos Eugene. Her parents
want you to stay away there.

608
01:11:41,241 --> 01:11:43,241
You're scum.

609
01:11:48,502 --> 01:11:50,502
Check it out.

610
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:54,188
Stay away from her, asshole.

611
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:58,516
You miserable dog.

612
01:12:18,745 --> 01:12:20,745
Look, a fight.

613
01:12:53,407 --> 01:12:54,858
Remain outside.

614
01:12:54,958 --> 01:12:56,958
Let him fight.

615
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:11,160
Come on motherfucker,
Come on.

616
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,333
Come on Kenny, get up.

617
01:13:14,007 --> 01:13:16,007
Stop.

618
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:42,608
I said, stop it.
I mean, stop.

619
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:47,169
It's over.
Go home.

620
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:54,693
You okay?
- Yes.

621
01:13:55,016 --> 01:13:57,016
You have him beaten.

622
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,828
Everything ok?
- I think my arm is broken.

623
01:13:59,928 --> 01:14:02,988
Come, I'll take you to the hospital.

624
01:14:05,946 --> 01:14:07,946
Wait a minute.

625
01:14:10,339 --> 01:14:12,450
I know who you are.
You started it...

626
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:14,930
And you will pay for it all.

627
01:14:17,682 --> 01:14:21,823
You were great.
- And my best friend is finished.

628
01:14:22,219 --> 01:14:25,789
It was worth it.
- My dad thinks it is not.

629
01:14:37,263 --> 01:14:39,263
Out.

630
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:41,874
Pack your bags and off the ball.

631
01:14:41,974 --> 01:14:43,801
You had something to do about that boy.

632
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:46,454
You are nothing than a beggar.

633
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,147
You're lucky you now are not in jail.

634
01:14:49,247 --> 01:14:51,247
Who pays all this?

635
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:53,359
Pack and Go.

636
01:14:53,843 --> 01:14:55,509
Where should I go?

637
01:14:55,609 --> 01:14:58,716
Not my problem.
That is your problem.

638
01:15:01,434 --> 01:15:03,814
You're gone when I get back.

639
01:15:39,365 --> 01:15:41,889
Have you heard anything?
- No.

640
01:15:42,999 --> 01:15:45,534
When I hear, I tell you.
I promise.

641
01:15:45,634 --> 01:15:48,116
You do the same for me?
- Yes.

642
01:15:50,118 --> 01:15:57,003
I keep thinking that this is my fault.
I had to ignore my parents and him to talk.

643
01:15:59,371 --> 01:16:01,718
I think that more going on.

644
01:16:04,736 --> 01:16:06,736
See you.

645
01:16:39,563 --> 01:16:42,623
Buy your Gala tickets now.

646
01:17:17,354 --> 01:17:20,242
Is not it lonely without: what's him again?

647
01:17:20,342 --> 01:17:23,465
Would he have the guts to
Kenny to come back?

648
01:17:23,565 --> 01:17:25,927
He's not coming back.

649
01:17:29,826 --> 01:17:31,826
He's not coming back.

650
01:17:37,274 --> 01:17:39,484
I have my bracket anymore.

651
01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:42,289
You look good, Rosalie.

652
01:17:54,326 --> 01:17:56,326
Going to a funeral?

653
01:17:59,219 --> 01:18:01,219
I wish Gene was back.

654
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,958
Maybe it is'm ashamed in order to be seen.

655
01:18:05,058 --> 01:18:07,863
Maybe there were reasons Marilyn.

656
01:18:07,939 --> 01:18:10,744
He'll be back.
Where should he go?

657
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:20,680
It's not a good time.
But Jerry Jeager here at the gala ball.

658
01:18:21,417 --> 01:18:24,987
Jerry who?
- Jeager. Soccer star last year.

659
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:32,011
He called me an appointment or
had the gala ball.

660
01:18:32,111 --> 01:18:37,339
What did you do that?
- I said I needed to talk to someone first.

661
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:39,439
With someone?

662
01:18:39,501 --> 01:18:41,501
You mean me?

663
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:47,350
Jerry is only a few times a year...
I thought you would understand.

664
01:18:49,047 --> 01:18:51,047
Sure.

665
01:18:52,226 --> 01:18:53,712
Marilyn...

666
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,667
What?

667
01:18:55,767 --> 01:18:57,767
First...

668
01:18:58,111 --> 01:19:01,381
We had a bad football team last year.

669
01:19:02,207 --> 01:19:04,207
Second...

670
01:19:04,263 --> 01:19:06,643
You do but with a gala ball.

671
01:19:06,894 --> 01:19:08,125
And third...

672
01:19:08,225 --> 01:19:12,985
You and Jerry-celebrity-Jeager,
walking together to hell.

673
01:19:43,572 --> 01:19:46,260
You have quite a taste for music.

674
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:50,068
Darn.
- Dancing shoes at home?

675
01:19:52,572 --> 01:19:54,108
And my sweater too.

676
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:57,268
I'll leave you alone and you end it?

677
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:04,500
I thought I would never look back.

678
01:20:04,589 --> 01:20:06,589
I also thought not.

679
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:14,766
I had no one to talk.

680
01:20:15,871 --> 01:20:20,853
Where were you?
- I'll tell you later.

681
01:20:21,175 --> 01:20:23,470
Do you know where Bunny is?

682
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:25,744
Yes, come.

683
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:46,886
You're not a student anymore.
You and Jonathan have to leave.

684
01:21:46,986 --> 01:21:48,986
Right now.

685
01:21:50,268 --> 01:21:53,251
Wait a minute. I'll be back.

686
01:21:56,274 --> 01:21:58,274
Exuseer me.

687
01:21:58,778 --> 01:22:01,356
Well, is not Eugene?

688
01:22:02,018 --> 01:22:04,018
Back for more?

689
01:22:10,774 --> 01:22:12,774
You're not worth it.

690
01:22:27,561 --> 01:22:29,561
Let go, Kenny.

691
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:55,164
I had not run away.
My dad has put me out.

692
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:57,629
So I'm to Kentucky gone and I now work.

693
01:22:57,729 --> 01:22:59,729
As a groomsman.

694
01:23:00,095 --> 01:23:02,095
I love it.

695
01:23:02,757 --> 01:23:06,372
I came back for Bunny.
Maybe they leave with me.

696
01:23:06,472 --> 01:23:08,472
What a joke, right?

697
01:23:09,294 --> 01:23:15,894
They love you very much.
- Tomorrow I'm very far from here.

698
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:21,520
Why leave?
- There is nothing left for me here.

699
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:23,620
Except you.

700
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:27,447
You still get your dentist after college.

701
01:23:28,772 --> 01:23:32,087
Then I come back and you make my teeth.

702
01:23:33,316 --> 01:23:37,396
Very funny, Eugene.
I want you so many questions.

703
01:23:43,206 --> 01:23:47,626
I was so wrong about Marilyn
I was so busy for her...

704
01:23:50,105 --> 01:23:52,105
Fucking.

705
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:57,729
I do not even know her.
I do not understand women.

706
01:23:58,293 --> 01:24:02,293
I watch while I live never to housewifes.

707
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:11,780
Gene?

708
01:24:25,395 --> 01:24:27,395
Jonathan?

709
01:24:30,072 --> 01:24:32,877
Where's Gene?
I looked everywhere.

710
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:35,070
Come with me, come on.

711
01:24:36,472 --> 01:24:38,472
Are you sure?
- Yes.

712
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:40,342
Gene?

713
01:25:43,664 --> 01:25:45,664
Gene?

714
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:58,284
How did you get here?

715
01:26:00,779 --> 01:26:02,779
Jonathan.

716
01:26:05,306 --> 01:26:07,899
Well done, wretch.

717
01:26:11,901 --> 01:26:13,901
Shall we walk?

718
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:16,091
Yes.

719
01:26:20,605 --> 01:26:23,120
You know I can be found.

720
01:26:23,748 --> 01:26:25,878
I sit at home all alone.

721
01:26:26,578 --> 01:26:28,833
And if you can not get.

722
01:26:29,194 --> 01:26:31,339
Please Call me.

723
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:36,324
Do not be cruel. Your heart is pure.

724
01:26:37,984 --> 01:26:40,191
Maybe I made you mad.

725
01:26:40,713 --> 01:26:42,958
To something I said.

726
01:26:43,654 --> 01:26:45,654
Please forget the past.

727
01:26:46,188 --> 01:26:48,504
The future looks bright to us.

728
01:26:48,604 --> 01:26:53,323
Do not be cruel. Your heart is pure.

729
01:26:54,733 --> 01:26:57,190
I want no other love.

730
01:26:57,862 --> 01:27:01,754
It's you that I think.

731
01:27:03,406 --> 01:27:05,701
Do not stop thinking of me.

732
01:27:06,129 --> 01:27:08,562
Let me not feeling so feel.

733
01:27:09,187 --> 01:27:11,511
Come here and love me.

734
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:14,129
You know what I want you to say.

735
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:18,795
Do not be cruel. Your heart is pure.

736
01:27:20,233 --> 01:27:23,044
Why should we break up?

737
01:27:23,318 --> 01:27:27,328
I really love you baby I swear.

738
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:31,277
Let's go to a priest.

739
01:27:31,616 --> 01:27:33,752
Let us say 'I want'.

740
01:27:34,627 --> 01:27:37,022
Then you know you need me.

741
01:27:37,245 --> 01:27:39,436
And I know it.

742
01:27:39,737 --> 01:27:44,249
Do not be cruel. Your heart is pure.

743
01:27:45,712 --> 01:27:48,515
I want no other love.

744
01:27:48,799 --> 01:27:53,210
It's you that I think.

745
01:27:56,617 --> 01:27:59,745
We leave together.
- Darn.

746
01:28:00,102 --> 01:28:03,275
Jonathan, I do not want my parents
I do worry about.

747
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:05,753
You tell them?
- Sure.

748
01:28:06,494 --> 01:28:08,494
Thank you.

749
01:28:08,843 --> 01:28:10,843
I drive back.
- No.

750
01:28:11,618 --> 01:28:13,658
But departure from here.

751
01:28:13,878 --> 01:28:16,639
No problem.
- I need the walk.

752
01:28:18,552 --> 01:28:22,158
Besides, you need an edge.

753
01:28:23,136 --> 01:28:25,690
Thank you.
- Ok.

754
01:28:38,717 --> 01:28:40,717
See you friend.

755
01:29:00,089 --> 01:29:02,089
Thank you.

756
01:29:39,606 --> 01:29:42,055
Mr. Miller?
- Jonathan Day.

757
01:29:42,707 --> 01:29:44,626
I have a message from Bunny.

758
01:29:44,726 --> 01:29:46,348
She has started walking
with Gene Harbrough...

759
01:29:46,448 --> 01:29:47,706
...and she said you had to not worry...

760
01:29:47,806 --> 01:29:49,846
Everything will be fine.

761
01:30:05,306 --> 01:30:07,771
Hey, strontkop.
See you later.

762
01:30:10,523 --> 01:30:13,049
Tell your friend Eugene I'm looking for.

763
01:30:13,149 --> 01:30:15,614
When I'm like, I'll break 'm.

764
01:30:15,961 --> 01:30:18,554
Tell him that, strontkop.

765
01:30:49,109 --> 01:30:52,424
Look what that bastard did with my car.

766
01:31:19,397 --> 01:31:21,397
Come on.

767
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:58,810
Damn.

768
01:32:01,875 --> 01:32:03,875
Damn.

769
01:32:21,754 --> 01:32:23,879
Look what you my car did.

770
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:26,988
That was Gene.
Strontkop.

771
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:46,285
Jonathan, what have you done?

772
01:32:46,338 --> 01:32:47,506
Rosalie...

773
01:32:47,606 --> 01:32:50,173
Do you want me to cinema, Saturday?

774
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:54,523
Why do you think I
with you would go to the cinema?

775
01:32:55,881 --> 01:32:58,856
Just kidding.
- Very much, Jonathan.

776
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,140
Great.

777
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:07,876
Maybe we better with your car.
- Yes.

778
