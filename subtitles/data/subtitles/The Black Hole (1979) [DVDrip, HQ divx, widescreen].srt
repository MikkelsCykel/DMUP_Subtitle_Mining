1
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,399
2130, day 547.

2
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,950
Unscheduled course correction
due at 2200.

3
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,238
Pre-correction check:
Rotation axis plus three degrees.

4
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,189
Nitrous oxide pressure:
4,100, rising to 5,000.

5
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,033
Quad jets C and D
on pre-select.

6
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,351
Rotor ignition sequence
beginning in 3-0.

7
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,908
Thruster line reactors
on standby.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,150
Vincent, notify me with 15 to go.

9
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,559
- Alex?
- Yes, Dan.

10
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,916
Have you determined the difference
in ETAs with and without our correction?

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,788
Working on it. You know, we shouldn't
be needing a direction at this time.

12
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,156
Vincent, run a confirmation
on the last inertial fix...

13
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,310
and check it
with another celestial, please.

14
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,516
I have.
It is correct...

15
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,036
but I think I've found the reason
for our present variation.

16
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,270
- Mr. Pizer.
- Yes, Vincent.

17
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,920
Mr. Pizer, I think
you should come up here.

18
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,908
What's up, Vincent?

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,039
The largest black hole
I have ever encountered, Mr. Pizer.

20
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,111
Hmm. Let's have a look at it
on the holograph.

21
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,676
My God!

22
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,672
<i>Right out of Dante's Inferno.</i>

23
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,753
Yes. The most destructive force
in the universe, Harry.

24
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,070
Nothing can escape it,
not even light.

25
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,674
I had a professor who predicted
that eventually black holes...

26
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,672
would devour
the entire universe.

27
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,231
Why not, when you can see giant suns
sucked in and disappear without a trace?

28
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,357
- Give us the magnification, Vincent.
- Polarizing image.

29
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,877
Every time I see one of those things, I expect to
spot some guy in red with horns and a pitchfork.

30
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,109
It's a monster, all right.

31
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,953
A rip in the very fabric
of space and time...

32
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,951
but I picked up
something else of interest.

33
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,157
- Let's see it.
- Ýt hasn't moved since I first picked it up.

34
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,708
- Ýt seems to be some kind of ship.
- Do you copy, Alex?

35
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,998
<i>- Roger, Dan.
- Enlarge again, Vincent, and let's try to identify it.</i>

36
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,795
But how could anybody
be out here ahead of us?

37
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,189
<i>Arcturius-10, United Kingdom.</i>

38
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,117
<i>Liberty-7, United States.</i>

39
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,195
<i>Russian experimental space station,
series five.</i>

40
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,149
<i>France, Sahara Module 5-3.</i>

41
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,753
<i>Pluto-4, Japan.</i>

42
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,956
<i>United States,
Space Probe One.</i>

43
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,554
- That's it.
- USS Cygnus.

44
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,552
<i>Dr Kate, wasn't that the ship
your father was on?</i>

45
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,551
<i>USS Cygnus.</i>

46
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,714
Its mission: To discover habitable
life in outer space. Same as ours.

47
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,711
Signal that ship, Vincent.

48
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,154
- Activate the sensors, Charlie.
- You bet.

49
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,311
They were recalled to Earth
20 years ago...

50
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,914
their mission
considered a failure.

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,958
How that must have galled
Dr Hans Reinhardt.

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,474
Did you ever meet
Commander Reinhardt?

53
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,478
Collided with him would be
a more accurate description.

54
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,028
- A legend.
- So he believed.

55
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,589
Reinhardt had the knack
of making his own ambitions...

56
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,877
seem like a matter
of national pride.

57
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,155
Why, he talked
the space appropriations committee...

58
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,708
into the costliest fiasco
of all time...

59
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,711
and refused to admit failure.

60
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,552
He ignored his recall.

61
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,393
Maybe not.
Maybe it never got through.

62
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,675
That ship just...
just disappeared.

63
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,070
They've never been seen again.

64
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,233
Dan, get us in close enough. Vincent
and I could get aboard on tethers.

65
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,278
To quote Cicero, "Rashness is
the characteristic of youth...

66
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,592
prudence that of mellowed age and
discretion the better part of valour."

67
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,719
No sense leaving the story
of a lifetime untold, Captain.

68
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,870
<i>I believe there is, Harry...</i>

69
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,155
and it's looking
straight at us.

70
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,832
Picking up anything
on the sensors, Charlie?

71
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,512
Negative, but with all
that turbulence...

72
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,034
<i>out there, our signal
might not be getting through.</i>

73
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,350
According to my instruments,
it hasn't moved a centimetre...

74
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,431
since we first spotted it.

75
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,195
But, Alex, how can a lifeless derelict
defy that kind of gravity?

76
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,794
I don't know, but it's
certainly worth investigating.

77
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,552
<i>My instincts
are against it, Alex...</i>

78
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,029
but we'll go in
for a closer look.

79
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,918
Fix a coordinate approach, Charlie.
Full power on the thrusters, Vincent.

80
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,957
Strap yourselves in. We'll be feeling
the gravitational force...

81
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,231
right now.

82
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,716
Range: 29551 and closing.

83
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,551
<i>What's your reading
on Cygnus, Vincent?</i>

84
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,552
Triangulation shows
it's still holding steady, sir.

85
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,156
- Gravity pull?
- .02450 and rising.

86
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,631
Puts us in an escape attitude of
8-5 degrees. Cut power by two-thirds.

87
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,754
- 8-5 degrees. She's bucking
like a bronco. - Gravity?

88
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,035
.46960, still climbing.

89
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,190
Switching to manual.

90
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,999
Captain, I'm not sure how long
the engines will remain operable...

91
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,150
against that much force
when we turn back.

92
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,151
Alex, gravity's close to maximum.

93
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,629
We can afford one pass, and then we're
gonna have to get the hell out.

94
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,913
- Zero gravity.
- Cut the power.

95
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,831
Smooth as glass.

96
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,156
It's like being
in the eye of a hurricane.

97
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,075
- What happened?
- Natural phenomenon.

98
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,712
Or something from that ship.

99
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,912
Activating the microbeam.

100
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,276
Picking up anything, Charlie?

101
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,153
Negative, Alex. No way our signals
can't get through this time.

102
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,233
- Gravity's at maximum, Dan.
- My God, I think it's got us.

103
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,232
We're starting to tumble.
Hundred percent on the roll jet quads.

104
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,751
Roll jet quads, full capacity.

105
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,078
- Air break at midship. Losing oxygen.
- Charlie...

106
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,799
give me a full burst
at 180 degrees, main thrusters.

107
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,149
We got a break here too!

108
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,437
Emergency readouts show the primary
and secondary air lines ruptured!

109
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,074
Never rains.

110
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,469
Full-pitch attitude thrusters,
A and B rings.

111
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,471
The black hole
is pulling us in.

112
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,551
Going to manual.

113
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,828
The number four hatch blew outward,
Captain. I'll go out and secure it.

114
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,708
Watch yourself out there, Vincent. There's
more gravity pull than we've ever encountered.

115
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,313
Yes, sir.

116
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,596
Alex, we'd better check out
the damage below!

117
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,512
Vincent, do you read me?
Come in, Vincent.

118
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,830
Kate, either we have
a malfunction here...

119
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,911
or there's too much interference
on the outside.

120
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,911
See if you can get through
to Vincent with your ESP.

121
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,911
I got through to Vincent.

122
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,479
He said there are old pilots
and there are bold pilots...

123
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,518
but there are very few
old, bold pilots.

124
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,630
She's tuned in on Vincent,
all right.

125
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,708
Grab my leg! My leg!

126
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,191
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

127
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,229
And that's got it!

128
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,914
Hit the boosters, Charlie. We gotta
make a run for that zero gravity.

129
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,356
He secured the hatch!

130
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,793
Good.

131
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,556
<i>We can only make temporary repairs here,
Dan, and that's only to the secondary line.</i>

132
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,154
Unless we can replace the damaged parts
in the main regulator...

133
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,549
we're gonna lose
our oxygen supply.

134
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,551
Damn!

135
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,076
Dan, the tether's broken.

136
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,993
- Ý'm going after him.
- Stay at your post, Charlie.

137
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,197
What the hell are you made of?

138
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,795
- What if it were one of us out there?
- Vincent is one of us.

139
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,993
Reverse thrusters
and look for a place to set down.

140
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,915
- What's going on?
- That's what I'd like to know.

141
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,911
Like a tree
on Christmas morning.

142
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,434
Locking warheads
into firing position.

143
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,274
Hold it, Dan. They've got to be friendly. They
could have blasted us right out of the sky.

144
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,751
Your side, Dan.

145
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,111
<i>You got a picture down there?</i>

146
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,958
- There are people on board.
- Just a shadow, Kate.

147
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,031
Enlarge, please.

148
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,716
There are people, Alex.
I know it. I feel it.

149
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,795
Docking elevator coming up.

150
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,589
Wonder why they didn't roll out
the red carpet earlier.

151
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,591
I don't know,
and I don't like it.

152
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,752
But they're calling the shots,
and we've got to repair this craft.

153
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,673
Dan, I'm sorry I blew my stack.

154
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,469
I guess we all have a soft spot
for the little guy, Charlie.

155
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,920
- Yeah.
- All right, let's bring her in.

156
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,672
Okay.

157
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,515
Bingo.

158
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,875
We have gravity.

159
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,673
Nice work, Vincent.

160
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,957
Out of the frying pan;
hopefully, not into the fire.

161
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,597
- Are you all right, Vincent?
- Nothing a hammer and a little metal polish can't fix. Thank you.

162
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,796
Looks like
we'll have to go to them.

163
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,600
<i>- Charlie, you'll stay with the Palomino.
- But you need everyone that's got...</i>

164
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,591
- Charlie.
- Don't worry, Mr. Pizer.

165
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,716
They also serve
who only stand and wait.

166
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,711
Vincent, were you programmed
to bug me?

167
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,711
No, sir, to educate you.

168
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,715
When I volunteered for this mission, I never
thought I'd end up playing straight man to a tin can.

169
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,276
This place looks as if
it hasn't been used for years.

170
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,909
It's eerie. I feel like
a thousand eyes are watching us.

171
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,194
Vincent!

172
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,919
- Charlie, do you read me?
- Vincent, are you all right?

173
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,709
Weapons destroyed by laser fire.
No injuries. Hold your position.

174
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,791
Vincent.

175
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,676
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Down, but never for the full count, Dr Kate.

176
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,390
- So much for the friendship theory.
- Come on, Harry. They could have killed us if they'd wanted to.

177
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,391
Yeah, sure.

178
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,435
I don't like it when somebody else
pulls the strings, Captain.

179
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,991
Neither do I, Vincent. Whoever's up in that
control tower is calling the shots right now.

180
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,992
Whoever or whatever, Captain.

181
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,110
- Easy, Kate.
- Ý know I shouldn't get my hopes up, but it's hard not to.

182
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,111
I know.

183
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,909
I don't mind telling you,
I'm a little concerned.

184
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,436
Some of my brother robots
were assigned to Project Black Hole...

185
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,035
programmed to send ESP messages
back from space probes.

186
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,237
Oh, a grand experiment,
the scientists thought.

187
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,231
Also ancient history, Vincent.

188
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,517
Not to me, Mr. Booth.
Not this close.

189
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,637
The heat in there
melts types like me rather quickly.

190
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,753
Hello? Ý'm Kate McCrae.

191
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,075
Is Officer Frank McCrae aboard?

192
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,709
They appear to be
some sort of robot, Dr Kate.

193
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,231
Look over here.

194
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,435
Incredible.

195
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,159
It oughta be.
Sure cost the taxpayers enough.

196
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,276
Kate.

197
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,271
There's someone else with us.

198
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,316
Identify yourself.

199
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,671
What is your type and model?

200
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,233
- A mystery monster.
- Don't move.

201
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,278
Charlie, do you read me?
Charlie Pizer. Come in, Charlie.

202
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,433
This is the story
to end all stories, Harry.

203
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,275
A ship of robots and computers
with this thing in charge?

204
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,112
Not quite, Dr Durant.

205
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,911
Maximilian and my robots only run
this ship the way I wish it run.

206
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,752
How do you know my name?

207
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,310
You were monitored ever since
our sensors first detected you.

208
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,470
Now, now, Maximilian.
Calm down.

209
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,471
Don't pick on small people.

210
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,954
Such a nice little robot.
He's harmless.

211
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,555
Miss McCrae,
you might come closer.

212
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,478
<i>Welcome aboard the Cygnus.</i>

213
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,472
Hans Reinhardt.

214
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,471
It can't be.

215
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,109
You always did have a flair
for theatrical entrances, Doctor.

216
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,111
Dr Reinhardt.

217
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,909
My father, where is he?

218
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,475
My dear child,
I'm sorry to dash your hopes...

219
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,676
but your father's
not with us any more.

220
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,431
He's dead.

221
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,751
A man to be proud of.

222
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,274
A grave personal loss to me.

223
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,749
He was a trusted and loyal friend.

224
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,476
And you are his daughter.

225
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,955
Yes. The same eyes.

226
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,554
The same eyes.

227
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,551
And the rest of the crew?

228
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,876
- They didn't make it back?
- They did not.

229
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,634
Pity, for such a good crew.

230
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,234
What happened when your mission
was recalled, Doctor?

231
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,153
Is this going to be
an interview, Mr. Booth?

232
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,390
I haven't had that for a long time,
but if you want to...

233
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,838
I will answer.

234
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,071
Now, don't be frightened.
Nobody's going to harm you.

235
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,835
<i>The Cygnus encountered
a field of meteorites...</i>

236
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,309
and was disabled...

237
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,155
our main and auxiliary
communication systems smashed.

238
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,552
We were adrift.
I told the crew to abandon ship...

239
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,671
to return home as ordered.

240
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:26,471
Perhaps it was another of what you term
my "theatrical gestures," Mr. Booth...

241
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,630
but I chose to remain aboard.

242
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,352
Your dear father
chose to remain with me.

243
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,075
We never knew
what happened to the others.

244
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,711
You've lived out here
for 20 years? Alone?

245
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,109
Twenty years?

246
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,475
Twenty Earth years, but...

247
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,149
I didn't live exactly alone.

248
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,357
I've created companions
of a sort.

249
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,150
They look a bit medieval...

250
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,151
but I'm a romantic.

251
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,990
Ah, Mr. Pizer!
Come in. Join us.

252
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,230
Thank you.
Have you met the goon squad?

253
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,429
"Goon squad." Nice.
I'm Hans Reinhardt.

254
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,832
Forgive this little incident, but you
were disarmed for your own safety.

255
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,956
Dismissed.

256
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,909
My robots are programmed to react
against any act of aggression.

257
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,195
I assure you, none was intended.

258
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,559
I am glad to hear that. Please.
Consider yourselves my guests.

259
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,757
We won't impose
on your hospitality, Doctor.

260
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,308
Just long enough
to repair our ship.

261
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,153
And then we can offer you the means
of returning to Earth, Doctor.

262
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,754
What makes you think
I want to return?

263
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,196
<i>The Cygnus is in danger
of being destroyed here.</i>

264
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,750
Yes! Your captain
was worried about that too.

265
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,751
One step too far...

266
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,871
and we are done.

267
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,599
But there's no cause for alarm.

268
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,913
We developed antigravity forces
to maintain our position.

269
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,560
It's what you might call
a Mexican stand-off.

270
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,349
If you were monitoring us,
you must have picked up our signals.

271
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,795
- That's right.
- You failed to reply.

272
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,791
Did I have to reply?

273
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,479
Charlie, Charlie.

274
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,788
Slight communications problem.

275
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,714
Maximilian will take you to requisition
whatever you need to repair your ship.

276
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,396
In the meantime, you and Dr McCrae
will get enough information...

277
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,552
to make your mission
of historic importance.

278
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,913
- Back off, Vincent.
- Not until he does.

279
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,960
When you're nose to nose
with a trash compactor, you cool it.

280
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,989
Now, what does that remind me of?

281
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,039
Oh, yes. David and Goliath.

282
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,190
A classic confrontation.

283
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,352
Only this time,
David is overmatched.

284
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,231
Call him off, Reinhardt.

285
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,433
I said call him off!

286
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,868
On my ship, you ask, Captain.

287
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,875
Indeed.
Please, call him off, Doctor.

288
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,068
Maximilian?

289
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,993
Remember, these are our guests.

290
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,391
Now, let him in.

291
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,428
Show that you've good manners.
That's a good robot.

292
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,195
Communication problems aside, he took
an awful long time to show any lights.

293
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,316
- Be careful.
- Ý know.

294
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,078
Those other robots aren't any friendlier
than Dr Frankenstein's monster.

295
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,391
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

296
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,989
Maybe you should've smiled
when you said it, Vincent.

297
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,389
Doctor, this ship
doesn't appear to be crippled.

298
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,712
Of course not. We repaired the damage
and became operable again.

299
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,633
But you never obeyed the order
to return to Earth.

300
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,234
That's right.
I refused this order.

301
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,788
There were larger considerations...

302
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,996
other worlds
yet to be explored...

303
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,640
life dreams unrealized.

304
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,794
The authorities would still consider
that an act of piracy, Doctor.

305
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,110
What would you have said, Mr. Booth,
if the authorities...

306
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,749
would have called back Columbus just
before he discovered the New World?

307
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,231
You wouldn't even exist.

308
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,875
I'm about to prove to you
that the end justifies the means.

309
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,392
Pretty busy around here, Max.
What are you gearing up for?

310
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,754
Tell you what, Charlie.

311
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,753
You'll take care of business here, and I'll go back
to the ship and start working on that regulator.

312
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,954
Don't bother to point the way, Max.
I'll find it by myself.

313
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,952
Well, we need primary and secondary
demand oxygen pressure regulators...

314
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,838
and an ECS proportion
flow valve controller.

315
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,952
Max.

316
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,952
Dr Reinhardt told you
to requisition the parts for us.

317
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,031
Let's get cracking.

318
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,874
Way to go, Max.
Way to go.

319
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,793
Vincent. Vital Information
Necessary Centralized.

320
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,030
Labour force. The 396.

321
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,998
I see by your markings
you're from the old 2-8.

322
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,991
Programmed in Houston.

323
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,913
There is enough instant energy
down there to supply all of Earth.

324
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,673
The first step
to colonizing the galaxy.

325
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,275
You will be remembered as one of the
greatest space scientists of all time.

326
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,314
I have never doubted that.

327
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,951
It's about time that people learn
about their failures and my successes.

328
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,998
You should come back with us
and enjoy the glory of that success.

329
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,959
I don't want to go back,
and I don't enjoy successes any more.

330
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,793
There is too much at stake
to pull back.

331
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,189
I'm on the brink
of a great achievement.

332
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,999
All this is just the beginning.

333
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,072
- The beginning? Of what?
- You will know in due time.

334
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,071
Dr Reinhardt, could we have
a demonstration...

335
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,355
- Of this incredible new power source.
- Harry?

336
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,113
Come with me,
and I'll show you everything.

337
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,760
I call it "Cygnium,"
after my ship.

338
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,511
Must've made a wrong turn, Max.

339
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,591
Quite a layout.

340
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,916
I said it's quite
a layout you got here.

341
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,231
Can you speak?

342
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,439
Are you programmed to speak?

343
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,558
No, I guess not.

344
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,316
No, I guess that'd make you
a little bit too real, wouldn't it?

345
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,913
That Reinhardt sure loves
to play God, doesn't he?

346
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,679
Hey, wait a minute!

347
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,311
Hey!

348
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,551
- Ý know what I saw, Charlie.
- Dan, nobody buries a robot.

349
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,313
- Ý didn't say it was a robot.
- Then what?

350
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,871
I don't know what they shot out into space, but they did
it with all the reverence and honour of a human funeral.

351
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,189
Huh. Maybe Reinhardt lied.

352
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,716
Maybe there are some survivors still
alive. What do you think he's up to?

353
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,711
- Haven't got a clue.
- Well, whatever it is...

354
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,791
he seems cooperative enough
about getting us operable.

355
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,950
A wolf remains a wolf...

356
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,190
even if it has not eaten
your sheep.

357
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,272
Correct, Vincent. The sooner
we blast out of here, the better.

358
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,271
Whatever you say.
Let's snap it up, Vincent.

359
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,636
A pint cannot hold a quart,
Mr. Pizer.

360
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,790
If it holds the pint,
it's doing the best it can.

361
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,031
Thank you, Vincent.

362
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,791
- Fascinating.
- From a distance.

363
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,399
Are you interested
in black holes?

364
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,029
How can one not be overwhelmed
by the deadliest force in the universe?

365
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,111
That long, dark tunnel to nowhere.

366
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,799
Or somewhere.

367
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,634
These are exactly answers
yet to be explored.

368
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,871
You've defined the power of the black
hole with your antigravity calculations.

369
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,871
A stunning achievement, sir.

370
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,831
- You think so?
- Yes. I do.

371
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,909
Thank you.

372
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,874
I think, Dr Durant...

373
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,758
that you are a man
who longs for a sense...

374
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,513
of his own greatness...

375
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,273
but has not yet found
his true direction.

376
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,715
Right?

377
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,916
Perhaps I could find it here...

378
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,116
if you're in no hurry
for us to leave.

379
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,909
Shall we discuss that
over dinner?

380
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,270
- Ýt's only dinner.
- "Said the spider to the fly." I should be with you.

381
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,874
Yeah, we'll be safer without you
and Max trying to knock heads.

382
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,871
I can handle that thing.

383
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,679
Well, far be it from you to admit
there isn't anything you can't handle.

384
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,479
There are three basic types, Mr. Pizer.
The wills, the won'ts and the can'ts.

385
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,120
The wills accomplish everything,
the won'ts oppose everything...

386
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,111
and the can'ts
won't try anything.

387
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,270
Well, do us all a favour, Vincent,
and try to be a can't...

388
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,271
especially where
that monster's concerned.

389
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,510
We need you,
not another corkscrew.

390
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,831
Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.

391
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,831
Vincent, you're gonna have
the time of your life in there.

392
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,912
I don't mean to sound superior,
but I hate the company of robots.

393
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,991
So try and relax.
Have some fun.

394
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,230
Remember what they say:
"All work and no play"?

395
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,550
"All sunshine makes a desert,"
so the Arabs say.

396
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,551
You'll alert me
if you're in trouble, Captain?

397
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,710
Why don't you go on in there
and have some laughs, Vincent.

398
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,588
We've been in some scrapes before,
and we're gonna get out of this one.

399
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,351
As you were.

400
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,755
- Who's the flashy black hat?
- S-T-A-R.

401
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,990
Special Troops Arms Regiment.

402
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,753
Reinhardt's prototype
for the sentry robots.

403
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,274
He was number one
until Reinhardt built Maximilian.

404
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,072
He's sharp, but we're sharper.
Do you ever go up against him?

405
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,435
- Once.
- What happened?

406
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,830
I beat him. He got so upset,
he blew a fuse.

407
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,311
He had his revenge, though. He did things
to me that I sure don't like to think about.

408
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,552
<i>A great many experiments are in progress
aboard the Cygnus, gentlemen...</i>

409
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,551
some of them dangerous.

410
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,551
I suggest in the interest
of your own safety...

411
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,191
that there are no more unescorted
excursions for the duration of your stay.

412
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,271
- Agreed?
- Sure, sure.

413
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,512
Good. Please, sit down.

414
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,511
Captain.

415
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,789
Well, Mr. Booth,
what's new on Earth?

416
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,519
Well, I don't think it's changed
very much since you left, Doctor.

417
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,558
Nothing much ever changes.

418
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,551
Same news, different names.

419
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,070
- You still writing for the same paper?
- The same.

420
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,912
Still on strike?

421
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,598
Ah, fresh mushroom soup.

422
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,148
Prepared from my own personal garden.

423
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,518
I remember writing about
the extensive agricultural station.

424
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,876
Large enough to supply the needs
of the entire crew, wasn't it, Doctor?

425
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,349
These days it's tiny.

426
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,351
Just enough for one person.

427
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,351
Ah. Naturally.

428
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,710
Our wine and our spare parts
are vintage, Captain.

429
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,631
I hope they're satisfactory.

430
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,075
We've had to modify
a few of the parts, Doctor...

431
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,276
but, uh, that shouldn't take long.

432
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,591
- We'll be ready to leave soon.
- Speak for yourself, Dan.

433
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,639
I, for one, believe I have a great deal
to learn from Dr Reinhardt.

434
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,756
Thank you.

435
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,637
Our mission's finished, Alex.

436
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,631
A toast.

437
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,792
To you and your companions,
Dr Durant...

438
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,156
<i>on the occasion
of your visit to the Cygnus.</i>

439
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,196
Welcome aboard, Miss Kate.

440
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,675
The only Earth people to know
of my existence.

441
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,957
And to you, sir,
and your magnificent accomplishments.

442
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,316
Tonight, my friends...

443
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,591
we stand on the brink...

444
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,797
of a feat unparalleled
in space exploration.

445
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,071
If the data on my returning probe ship
matches my computerized calculations...

446
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,311
I will travel
where no man has dared to go.

447
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,115
Into the black hole?

448
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,713
In...

449
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,119
through...

450
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,431
and beyond.

451
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,236
Why, that's crazy.

452
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,709
Ha! Ýmpossible!

453
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,394
The word "impossible,"
Mr. Booth...

454
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,517
is only found
in a dictionary of fools.

455
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,796
Are there any more like us
left on board?

456
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,271
I'm the last one. These upstarts
think I'm some old freak.

457
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,558
They still haven't improved on our model. Oh,
you can't modify perfection. We are the best.

458
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,040
Oh, lordy.
He wants a rematch.

459
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,391
As an old navy hero once said,
"Damn the torpedoes. Full speed ahead!"

460
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,677
He also said something about
goin' in harm's way.

461
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,951
Nice shooting, Bob.

462
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,235
You'd have beat him again
if he hadn't bumped you.

463
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,788
Nah, I'd have missed on purpose.

464
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,430
Don't worry. I'll uphold
the honour of the old outfit.

465
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,312
STAR, Vincent's my name.
Sharpshooting is my game.

466
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,550
Try me.

467
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,634
Your probe ship has only gone
to the event horizon, Doctor...

468
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,075
not into the black hole itself.

469
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,358
<i>How do you expect the Cygnus to escape
being crushed by the force in there?</i>

470
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,399
I would assume that Dr Reinhardt has
created an antigravitational force field...

471
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,471
capable of withstanding that stress.

472
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:58,998
Indeed, and I know you will say, Captain,
that one mistake in navigation can be fatal.

473
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,356
But I know exactly what I'm doing.
The course I have chosen...

474
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,319
<i>will take the Cygnus through
at its optimum angle of rotation.</i>

475
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,837
The vortex will cause us to move
at incredible speed...

476
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,913
and that angle
will slingshot us through.

477
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,914
Nice shot, STAR.
Simple, but nice.

478
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,956
Tricky. Here, try this.

479
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,672
If one dances,
one must pay the piper.

480
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,678
If there's anything I cannot stand,
it's a sore loser.

481
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,236
Meet me in parts storage.

482
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:40,909
<i>So, as I understand it, you want
the Palomino to monitor your journey.</i>

483
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,516
That's right. I need you to go
to another place and another time...

484
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,433
a place where,
if you're lucky...

485
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,149
I'll have the possibility to find
what we call "the ultimate knowledge."

486
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,151
Yes, Maximilian?

487
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,871
The probe ship is about to dock.
Continue your meal, gentlemen.

488
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,751
Cuckoo as a Swiss clock.

489
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,839
My name's Bob,
Bio-sanitation Battalion.

490
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,117
I couldn't talk freely before,
but I have a whole lot to tell you.

491
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,670
If Maximilian knew you were here, why,
it'd be the end for the both of us.

492
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,115
Can you permanently rearm my lasers?

493
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,558
Yeah, I can. Vincent, you and
your friends are in grave danger.

494
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,110
<i>Reinhardt only turned the lights on
to prevent any damage to the Cygnus.</i>

495
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,111
This is a death ship.

496
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,111
What does your intuition
tell you, Kate?

497
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,399
That Dr Reinhardt is walking a tightrope
between genius and insanity.

498
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,119
- Ý think the guy's nuts.
- Ý don't buy that.

499
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,714
Well, whatever he is,
he's an out-and-out liar.

500
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,032
That tiny little one-man garden of his
is big enough to feed an army.

501
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,031
Nothing strange about that.
It purifies the air.

502
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,554
- Oh.
- Tell them about the funeral, Dan.

503
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,349
A robot funeral, Alex.
It was almost human.

504
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,874
Look. Granted, the 20 years
out of contact with people...

505
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,679
has made this man a little eccentric,
but you can't ask me to believe...

506
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,830
that he's programmed his robots
to feel emotions.

507
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,832
- Come on.
- Ý know what I saw, Alex...

508
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,593
and we only have Reinhardt's word
for what happened to his crew.

509
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,593
All I know is that that robot gardener
was almost human too.

510
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,035
Ha! He even walked with a limp.

511
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,271
What spooks you
about a malfunctioning robot, Harry?

512
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,271
I wasn't spooked, old buddy.

513
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,557
I'm just telling you
that I had a gut feeling that...

514
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,676
that I was looking at
some kind of...

515
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,433
some kind of person.

516
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,717
- What are you getting at?
- That we make our apologies, say our goodbyes...

517
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,836
and get off this ship
as quick as we can.

518
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,876
Oh, now, wait a minute, Dan.
Now, hold it, hold it.

519
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,428
Now, now, now, l-let's stop
and figure this thing out.

520
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,230
If Reinhardt has antigravity
strong enough to hold him here...

521
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,231
I figure he's got enough
to pull away.

522
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,436
- So?
- "So"?

523
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,637
So why not take this ship
and Reinhardt back home?

524
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,394
That's a long shot
you're talking about, Harry.

525
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,155
Aw, come on. You've got
two scientific wizards here...

526
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,518
to figure out the computers, a-and they
can even reprogram the robots.

527
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,831
And the three of us can handle Reinhardt
and that pet monster of his.

528
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,990
I'm tellin' you,
we could all be heroes.

529
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,150
We could also be dead.

530
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,432
These poor creatures are
what's left of the crew.

531
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,638
Kept alive by means
I don't pretend to understand.

532
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,109
Humans?

533
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,589
They're more robot than human.

534
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,194
Let's get outta here
before we're discovered.

535
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,669
Too late. Watch it!

536
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,833
Think there are any more?

537
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,070
All clear.

538
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,634
Let's get rid of the evidence.

539
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,596
Maximilian will take you
to Debriefing.

540
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,592
I will check out
your computers personally.

541
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,310
How long before they'll start
searching for these two?

542
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,278
It depends on their duty schedule.
Could be anytime.

543
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,033
Then we have to move fast.

544
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,195
So, he neglected his duty
to his country for a higher ideal.

545
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,831
So what? What basis in fact do you have
for these macabre speculations?

546
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,673
I agree that his style
is somewhat unconventional...

547
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,830
but he's willing and eager
to share his knowledge with us.

548
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,038
- Doesn't that mean anything to you?
- We're not staying aboard this ship any longer than we have to, Alex.

549
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,680
- Ý think that's up to Reinhardt to decide.
- Dan.

550
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,594
<i>Vincent wants you aboard
the Palomino right away.</i>

551
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,309
Let's go, Charlie.

552
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,994
I think I'll tag along.

553
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,590
This isn't our party.
Let's get outta here.

554
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,591
Reinhardt will solve the one final
mystery that has eluded mankind.

555
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,634
Or he'll die in the attempt.

556
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:04,271
Alex, I'm beginning to feel
you want to go with him.

557
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:09,388
On a glorious pilgrimage, straight
into what may be the mind of God?

558
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,268
I do. I do.

559
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,955
"And darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

560
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,068
And the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters."

561
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,116
What an incredible sight.

562
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,237
I still haven't got used to it.
Where are the others?

563
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,676
- They were recalled to the ship.
- Recalled?

564
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,833
Didn't I say no more
unescorted excursions?

565
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,911
Where was your communication?

566
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,039
Ah, the ESP you share
with the robot.

567
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,510
Extraordinary.

568
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,797
Dr Durant.

569
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:59,000
- Yes, Doctor?
- These are all my formulas I've compiled over the years.

570
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,514
I want you to take them
back with you...

571
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,196
and pass them on to others
in case something might happen to me.

572
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,191
You can depend on me.

573
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,590
I also want you
to monitor my flight.

574
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,116
Stay as long as you can
at the event horizon.

575
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,431
There might be an Einstein-Rosen
bridge to consider.

576
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,432
I will.

577
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,195
Believe me, I've been
waiting a long time...

578
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,317
for someone like you
to record this moment.

579
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,073
Thank you, Doctor.

580
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,152
Then I'm ready.

581
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,710
Ready to embark on
man's greatest journey.

582
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,519
Certainly his riskiest.

583
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,956
The risk is incidental
compared to the possibility...

584
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,510
to possess the great truth
of the unknown.

585
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:52,116
There, long-cherished
laws of nature...

586
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,509
simply do not apply.

587
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,034
They vanish.

588
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,156
And life?

589
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,029
Life?

590
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,636
Life forever.

591
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,791
The officer the men trusted most
was Frank McCrae.

592
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,000
- Kate's father.
- They turned to him when Dr Reinhardt ignored the orders to return home.

593
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,230
<i>He tried to take control
of the Cygnus.</i>

594
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,278
Reinhardt called it mutiny
and killed Mr. McCrae.

595
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,956
- What became of the crew?
- They were captured by the sentry robots and are still on board.

596
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,871
- What?
- Where?

597
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,599
In the command tower,
the power centre.

598
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,389
Robots, Mr. Pizer, humanoid robots.

599
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,710
The most valuable thing
in the universe...

600
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,837
intelligent life, means
nothing to Dr Reinhardt.

601
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,196
Without their wills, the crew
became things he could command.

602
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,236
- That explains the funeral.
- Right.

603
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,154
And the limping robot you spotted.

604
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,472
Do you mean to tell me that there's
actually a human body under that clothing?

605
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,755
Exactly, Mr. Booth.

606
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:04,072
We can't just take off and leave
these poor devils behind.

607
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,355
Harry, looks like we're
gonna have to try your plan.

608
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:10,228
What? And end up just like
the rest of the crew?

609
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,914
Why, if they couldn't pull it off,
what chance do we have?

610
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,549
Captain, the damage is irreversible.

611
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,835
Death is their only release.

612
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,833
That's right. For God's sakes, Dan,
we can't take on that mechanical army.

613
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,798
Captain, I was forced
to destroy two sentry robots.

614
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,474
The others are searching now.
If they're found...

615
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,835
- Gotcha, Vincent. Charlie, start the countdown.
- Right.

616
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,833
Vincent, tell Kate I want her
and Alex back here on the double.

617
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,111
Fix navigational course.

618
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,114
You have achieved all this
on your own, Dr Reinhardt...

619
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,512
and you would have every right to reject
the request of a comparative stranger, but...

620
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,639
What are you hoping for, Alex?
Immortality?

621
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,109
No, scientific truth.

622
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,352
Alex, we have to board right away.
They're waiting to blast off.

623
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,710
Prepare reactors!

624
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,836
Maximilian!

625
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,513
- How are your readings, Vincent?
- All systems are go, Mr. Pizer.

626
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,358
Alex, I will not have you
throwing your life away for this.

627
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,389
- He can do it. I know he can.
- Oh, God, Alex!

628
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,836
There's an entirely different world
beyond that black hole...

629
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,198
a point where time and space
as we understand it no longer exists.

630
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,195
We will be the first to see it,
to explore it, to experience it.

631
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,114
Damn it all, Dan! Ýf we wait
for Alex, we may be too late.

632
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,397
Don't you see?
He's hypnotized by that man.

633
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,791
- Vincent.
- Yes, Captain?

634
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,192
Tell Kate we want her back here fast,
with or without Alex. Tell her why.

635
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,794
Reactors on.

636
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,909
He's going to do it.

637
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,991
He's going to do it!

638
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,795
He's really going to do it.

639
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,314
He'll kill us all if you don't get us
outta here now, Holland.

640
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,073
He wants us out there to monitor
his flight. We still have time.

641
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,720
You're gambling with our lives,
but you're not gonna gamble with mine!

642
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,631
Shut up, Harry!

643
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:03,030
- Alex.
- R squared.

644
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,873
- Alex! Could I have a word with you?
- B plus...

645
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,599
B squared...

646
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,912
over A squared,
sine squared, data...

647
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,912
Do you remember what we were
talking about the other day?

648
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,390
- We've gotta get out of
here. - Ý'm staying. - Shh!

649
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,235
- Reinhardt is a murderer.
- What?

650
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,517
Yes. Those creatures...

651
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,034
Those aren't robots. They're...

652
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,556
They're humanoids. They're... They're
what's left of the original crew.

653
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,596
What's wrong, Miss Kate?

654
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,351
You look ill.

655
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,830
<i>Kate's upset because I've elected
to stay with the Cygnus.</i>

656
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,357
- Ý hope she's electing also to stay with us.
- No, I...

657
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,557
- What changed your mind?
- Ý'm not. I, uh...

658
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:53,349
The right moment to go
into the black hole is now.

659
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,312
What are you doing?

660
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,629
He would be dead by now.

661
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,029
They all would be dead.

662
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,351
It was the only way
to keep them alive.

663
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,556
One of my greatest achievements.

664
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,918
But you told us the crew
had left the ship.

665
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,312
Some cause must have
created all this.

666
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,597
But what caused that cause?

667
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,389
Come on, Kate.
Let's get you out of here.

668
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,069
Maximilian!

669
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,991
Alex!

670
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,189
You shouldn't have done that!

671
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,674
He was a good man.

672
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,671
Protect me from Maximilian.

673
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:38,788
If there's any justice at all,
the black hole will be your grave.

674
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,634
Take the young lady to the hospital.

675
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,194
<i>You're cleared for take-off, Captain.</i>

676
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,078
<i>Dr Durant and Dr McCrae
chose to remain aboard.</i>

677
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,357
I told you! Alex bought Reinhardt's
theory hook, line and sinker.

678
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,911
Dr Durant is dead. Maximilian killed him.
They are taking Dr Kate to the hospital.

679
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,436
Vincent, get old Bob to show us
the quickest way there.

680
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,680
Maximilian?

681
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,796
Bring us about.

682
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,635
All right. We may have just enough time.
Don't wait too long.

683
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,234
Get off before the gravity pull
is too strong, no matter what.

684
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,231
- Look, Dan, what if...
- No matter what, Charlie!

685
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,437
I wish you a safe
voyage home, Mr. Pizer.

686
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,035
Yeah, well, just make sure
you get aboard in one piece!

687
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:27,756
The time has come
to liquidate our guests.

688
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,468
Go, go.

689
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:54,275
- Keep coming, old-timer.
- You don't have to wait for me.

690
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,031
Fire thrusters.

691
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,718
That madman is headed
straight for the black hole.

692
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,679
- What'll we do?
- We wait.

693
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,238
Hurry.

694
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,152
<i>Charlie, Kate's okay.
We're on our way.</i>

695
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,471
Well, it's about time.
How close can we cut it?

696
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:17,439
<i>Tell the sentries to fire on any
humanoids between Medical and Palomino.</i>

697
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,749
- They're on to us.
- Well, at least it got us this far.

698
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,149
Start down.

699
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,675
All right, Vincent.
Let's make this one an end run.

700
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,228
We'll catch them in a crossfire.

701
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,911
Way to go, old Bob!

702
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,995
- Are you all right?
- The first fightin' I've done in 30 years.

703
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,674
I only wish it'd been Reinhardt
and Maximilian out there.

704
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,636
Your crack unit,
outwitted and outfought...

705
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,633
by some Earth robot
and that antique from storage!

706
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:38,116
<i>We cannot endanger the Cygnus
by exploding them too soon.</i>

707
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,793
Give them distance.
Then blow them out of the sky!

708
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,189
<i>- Charlie, do you read me?
- Loud and clear, Dan.</i>

709
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,512
<i>Man the controls. Post Harry at the
hatch and give us exactly 60 seconds.</i>

710
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,318
<i>- Where are you?
- Side corridor near reception.</i>

711
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,598
They got us pinned down, but we're gonna raise
hell here in a second. Start countin', Charlie.

712
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,399
<i>Dan! Dan, are you all right?</i>

713
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:33,751
Charlie, reversing last order.
Take her up now. Repeat, lift off.

714
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:40,229
- You heard the captain.
- You're pretty big on talking heroics, Harry. Let's see some.

715
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,911
- Oh, damn!
- Harry?

716
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,718
- Damn. - You
hit? - My leg.

717
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,509
- How bad?
- Oh, uh... l-I think it's broken.

718
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,636
- Can you make it back to the ship?
- Ý think so.

719
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,553
All right, then. Harry, we're counting
on you to make sure they don't get aboard.

720
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,631
- Right.
- Good.

721
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:37,550
- Way to go, Charlie.
- Hyah!

722
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:10,597
What's that idiot
trying to do? Harry!

723
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,117
Oh, no.

724
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,919
Blow it apart before
it hits us! Fire!

725
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,236
I should've known he was all talk,
no guts, and locked him up.

726
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,278
- He may have done us a favour, Charlie. At least we're alive.
- And where there's life...

727
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,954
I'm sure that's not what he had in mind.
He was trying to save his own skin.

728
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,349
There is a saying that
you can't unscramble eggs.

729
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,716
A penny's worth of philosophy right now
isn't gonna buy us out of this now, Vincent.

730
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,519
- A good offence is the best defence.
- And what?

731
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,036
Go after Reinhardt and turn the ship
around? Ýt's too late for all that.

732
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,510
- There is an alternative.
- The probe ship. Vincent, you're a genius.

733
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:42,196
- A meteorite struck the ship, Captain.
- Let's go, let's go. Come on. - Go.

734
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,875
A whole storm of them, Captain.
The black hole's dragging them in too.

735
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,997
We'll have to try the main corridor!

736
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:08,631
Get down!

737
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,315
Hang on, Kate.

738
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,914
Get down, Charlie!

739
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,718
- Ý got you, Bob.
- Let go, Captain! Save yourself!

740
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,714
- We've gotta keep moving!
- He's frozen.

741
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,229
- Come on! Hurry!
- All right, Charlie! Move it!

742
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,550
Keep going!

743
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,834
Increase power to maximum!
We are going through!

744
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:29,796
It's over. The storm's over.

745
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,276
Maximilian!

746
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,554
Prepare the probe ship.

747
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,919
Maximilian!

748
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,595
Help me! H-Help me!

749
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,194
Fools!

750
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:25,560
Listen to me!

751
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,835
Help!

752
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,912
Listen, somebody!

753
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,993
H- Help me. Help. Help.

754
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,916
Vincent!

755
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:17,592
All light.

756
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,309
- We have to go.
- No. No, I can't make it.

757
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,755
My hover stabilization's gone.

758
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,674
My main circuit's blown,
and both back-ups are failin'.

759
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,751
You can make it.

760
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,833
It's no use, Vincent.
My useful days are finished.

761
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,434
But part of me goes with ya.

762
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,988
We'll never be obsolete.

763
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,674
Carry on the tradition.

764
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,069
We're the best.

765
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:19,557
- Charlie!
- Help!

766
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:23,474
- No!
- Help!

767
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:01,036
- We better get the hell off! The whole ship's breaking up!
- Everybody, sit tight.

768
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:13,670
Hang on! Lift-off!

769
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,514
Gravity force field is on!

770
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,352
Controls not responding.

771
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:07,512
Captain, the ship
has been programmed.

772
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,591
To Reinhardt's course.

773
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,030
You mean we're going
into the black hole?

774
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:21,353
- Yep.
- Let's pray he was a genius.

775
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:38,152
In, in, in, through,
through, through...

776
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,549
and beyond.

777
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,871
In, in, through, through,
through and beyond.

778
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:51,234
Help me! Help me! Help me!

779
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,551
Help, help, help, help me, me!

780
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,638
Life? Life? Life? Life?
Life forever.

781
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:04,918
Reinhardt murdered my father,
my father, father.

782
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,675
Where is he? Reinhardt
murdered, murdered, murdered...

783
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,478
murdered, murdered,
murdered, murdered...

784
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,438
The black hole is pulling us in,
pulling us in, pulling us in.

785
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:17,308
We could also be dead,
could also be dead...

786
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,392
Be dead, be dead, be dead,
be dead, be dead, be dead.

787
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,074
We're the best. We're the best.
We're the best. We're the best.

788
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:27,950
Vincent. The best,
best, best, best, best.

789
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,918
We're the best. The best.
The best, the best.

790
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,434
- Christmas morning, Christmas morning.
- Our mission's finished.

791
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,030
- Ýt's pulling us in, pulling us in.
- Christmas morning. Christmas...

792
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:41,908
- We are the best.
- Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me!

793
01:24:42,908 --> 01:24:52,908
