1
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,043
Morning.

2
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:47,959
Lovely morning.
- Not bad

3
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,992
Banks never on time, are they?

4
00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:53,991
No, no, they're desperate.
Desperate.

5
00:01:55,307 --> 00:01:56,496
Desperate altogether.

6
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:58,433
Try another branch.

7
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:07,935
Morning.
Like to make a withdrawal, please.

8
00:02:22,388 --> 00:02:24,652
Harrison will defend
the bail application,

9
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:26,619
maybe even take the trial.

10
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:30,624
But he insists on
two thousand pounds in cash.

11
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:31,958
For a morning's work?

12
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:34,157
Up front.
As in now, before we go in.

13
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:35,996
I see, he doesn't trust me.

14
00:02:36,704 --> 00:02:39,297
Here he is now,
Michael, he's worth it.

15
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,046
Morning.
- Morning

16
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:46,212
It's nearly time.

17
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,678
Are we in funds?

18
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:49,504
Huh?

19
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:53,245
Oh, the cash.
Just been to the bank.

20
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:57,119
No... not here, Mr. Lynch.

21
00:02:57,223 --> 00:03:01,216
And you will be taking that off
in court, won't you?

22
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:04,195
The prosecution's claim that
they fear my client

23
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:05,560
might leave this country
while on bail,

24
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:10,329
is completely and totally
without foundation.

25
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:13,463
Especially when Mr. Lynch's
lovely little daughter, Breda

26
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,974
is having her
first Holy Communion soon

27
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:19,012
and it would be tragic

28
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,106
if her father were not
to be with her on that day.

29
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:24,547
So, Your Honour,

30
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:29,578
the State can find no course
in law or in justice

31
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:34,094
why this clean-living unassuming --

32
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:36,993
teetotaler should have
his bail rescinded.

33
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:39,259
Mr. Lynch may remain on bail

34
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:42,164
until his trial commences
two weeks on Monday.

35
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:45,238
Mr. Lynch, how does it feel to be
the most wanted man in Ireland?

36
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:47,672
Do you think
you'll get a fair trial?

37
00:03:47,943 --> 00:03:50,706
Mr. Lynch, you enjoy making
the Gardai look thick, don't you?

38
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:53,470
Hold... a minute, lads...

39
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:55,174
don't ever think the Gardas
are thick, you'd be wrong.

40
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:59,653
It'd be a big mistake.
The Gardas are anything but thick.

41
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:01,479
In fact, I think the Gardas are
very, very clever.

42
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:02,717
Is your name Michael Patrick Lynch?

43
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,017
You see, right there,
an example of brains. You see?

44
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:06,458
Excuse me, I am Mr. Lynch's attorney
and I object very much...

45
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,053
I'm detaining you on suspicion of
possessing illegal substances,

46
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:11,496
under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

47
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:12,966
I know what you want to do.

48
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:15,162
You want to strip search me,
don't you?

49
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,465
Please, let go of him.
This man is my client.

50
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:19,369
Oh, I see, you think
you'll humble me, do you?

51
00:04:19,474 --> 00:04:21,966
Oh, no...! Look at them!
Look at what I have to put up with!

52
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,308
Look at what they do
to innocent people.

53
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,281
Trying to grab a feel.
Trying to grab me balls, you queer.

54
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,944
You dirty perverts,
trying to get your rocks off.

55
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,452
Drugs? What drugs?

56
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:33,920
I've never done drugs in me life
and everyone knows it.

57
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,684
Show them your credentials, Mike.

58
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:36,915
Find the drugs.

59
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,256
Give us a look, get them off.

60
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:44,466
Find the drugs. Come on,
put your fucking hand up my hole,

61
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,330
you poofters.

62
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:46,628
Come on.

63
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:49,064
Show 'em your credentials, Michael.

64
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:51,606
Hey, you fucking faggots.
What are you afraid of?

65
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:54,438
You do it in private,
but not here, you fuckers.

66
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:01,149
Do you want any more, love?

67
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,187
I'm grand unless there's dessert?

68
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:05,345
Of course there is.

69
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:08,356
Is that you in the newspaper da?

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,349
Oh, can I finish that?

71
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:14,258
Yeah, waste not, want not. Thanks.

72
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,163
Oh, God, Michael, give it to me.
Give it to me.

73
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:20,463
You know the way
all that red meat makes him hyper.

74
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,038
Sorry, sorry wasn't thinking.

75
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:23,628
Your father first.
Who earns the money in this house?

76
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:24,998
Da does.

77
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,336
They're all grand.
There's enough for everyone.

78
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:28,103
They have to learn.

79
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:30,008
you just better go to bed
when you're told tonight.

80
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:31,341
Okay, mum.

81
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,945
Have you got Lynch with you, lads?

82
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:38,384
Check. We have him in our sights.

83
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:40,045
Clothes on or off today?

84
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:41,384
Fuck off.

85
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:43,083
She's great.

86
00:05:47,396 --> 00:05:50,024
Say hello to your da.
Go on. Found him.

87
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:51,065
Is that them, huh?

88
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:52,260
Is that the two sisters?

89
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:54,029
Oh, that's them all right, boy.

90
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:57,072
Bet he was glad he didn't have to
choose between them, huh?

91
00:05:57,507 --> 00:06:00,475
Why choose
when you can have both, boy?

92
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:02,238
Mind your mothers now.
Do what they tell you.

93
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:03,642
See you tonight.

94
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:05,211
See you.

95
00:06:05,716 --> 00:06:07,684
I'll call round later,
collect the kids, yeah?

96
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:11,577
Hey, Tommy, get off the bleeding
bike, come on.

97
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:12,451
Oh, come on, can I stay on?

98
00:06:12,556 --> 00:06:14,319
You know I can't take you
without a helmet.

99
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:16,893
Please Auntie Lisa...
Come on, just one go.

100
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:18,087
Come on then,
say goodbye to your da.

101
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:19,527
Bye, da.

102
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:21,895
Wave him goodbye.

103
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:29,400
Look at daddy
going round and round.

104
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,338
Say goodbye.

105
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,880
Jesus, there's no way he can
shake us off, not out here anyway.

106
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,973
So what's the point?

107
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:56,625
Jesus. We're running very low
on petrol, Barry.

108
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:58,928
Control where's
the nearest service station?

109
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,563
Con's very worried about
the petrol situation.

110
00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:02,572
He's getting out.

111
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:04,005
Okay, lads,
I'll be right back to you.

112
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:05,701
We're off.

113
00:07:09,315 --> 00:07:11,714
Right, lads,
the nearest petrol station's

114
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,211
a good ten miles away, maybe more.

115
00:07:13,284 --> 00:07:14,217
Oh, Jesus.

116
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:16,549
North east of the Bray Road.
Turn left for Bray.

117
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:19,522
There's an Esso on the left,
about three miles outside the town.

118
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:20,615
Keep in touch.

119
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:22,622
I don't believe this.

120
00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:27,161
Ah for fuck, I told you
stop for petrol, didn't I?

121
00:07:27,232 --> 00:07:29,894
But, no, you said,
''We're fine, Con''.

122
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:32,936
Look at him.
Sure, give him a wave, you wander.

123
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:06,667
Where would you be
without the social welfare, huh?

124
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:09,237
I couldn't agree more, Michael.
A vital few bob.

125
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:10,672
Tony Brady.

126
00:08:10,943 --> 00:08:13,309
It's the difference between eating
and not eating sometimes.

127
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,178
You said it, Tony. Good luck.

128
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:18,976
Later.

129
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:21,887
Michael Lynch.
And how are you today?

130
00:08:21,989 --> 00:08:22,478
Fine thanks.

131
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:30,655
There you go.

132
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:32,159
You're a gentleman
do you know that?

133
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:33,290
Thank you.

134
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:35,925
It's fellas like you
make the world go around.

135
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:43,474
Right, we've caught up with Lynch.

136
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:46,944
Told you he wouldn't miss out
on collecting his precious dole.

137
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:48,407
Well, don't lose him this time.

138
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:50,484
Oh, don't worry,
we're up his hole, Control.

139
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:52,017
And we've a full tank

140
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,211
Mr. Lynch won't be getting away
from us again today.

141
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,288
Right, lads, keep in touch.

142
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:02,219
I'll say one thing for him,
he sticks to the speed limit.

143
00:09:19,314 --> 00:09:20,473
Don't fuck about.

144
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:22,447
Yeah, no problem, Michael.

145
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:25,517
You're a mess, little brother.

146
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:39,197
Relax, we're just passing through!

147
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:40,360
Fucking hell!

148
00:09:40,436 --> 00:09:41,424
Excuse me, ladies...

149
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:43,936
say hello to my little friend.

150
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:11,625
Ho... here we go. He's off.
Put your foot down there, Con.

151
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:13,061
Something happening, Control.

152
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:16,104
You're telling me. There's a report
of a robbery at the dole office.

153
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:19,107
Oh, for fuck's sake, we're just
at the fucking dole office.

154
00:10:19,174 --> 00:10:19,698
What?

155
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:21,910
Fuck it! What do we do now?

156
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:29,382
I never promised you a story.

157
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:30,178
You did!

158
00:10:30,287 --> 00:10:31,049
I did not.

159
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:32,178
You did so, da!

160
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:33,449
What did I tell you about lying?

161
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:36,025
To lie to everyone
except you and ma.

162
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:38,084
And us.

163
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:40,324
Oh, yeah, and Auntie Lisa.

164
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,489
And the whole family. You never
lie to anyone in the family.

165
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:48,132
Tell us the story
about The Mansions, da.

166
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:51,537
Yeah, da,
tell us about The Mansions.

167
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:54,467
Fair enough.

168
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:55,442
Do you want to hear
the whole thing?

169
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:56,410
From the start.

170
00:10:56,513 --> 00:10:58,036
Okay.

171
00:10:58,715 --> 00:11:01,445
Long, long ago,
years ago before you were born

172
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:04,146
and your ma and me and Auntie Lisa
were very young

173
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:06,585
we all lived in a place
called The Mansions.

174
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:09,216
All our grannies and grand-dads
and brothers

175
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:12,488
and sisters and all our pals.
It was brilliant.

176
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:15,325
It was like a big hotel...

177
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:18,127
built specially for us
and all our mates.

178
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:20,260
And when I was young,

179
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,430
I used to think
God was smiling down on us.

180
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,941
Putting a special glow around us
so we could do as we pleased.

181
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:30,605
Go about our business with
no-one getting in our way.

182
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:33,082
And that it would never change.

183
00:11:33,184 --> 00:11:35,084
Tell us about the bailiffs, da.

184
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:38,419
All right, so.

185
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,024
Do you know what bailiffs are?

186
00:11:41,092 --> 00:11:43,423
They're just like gods
but they're worse.

187
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:45,154
Much worse.

188
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:51,063
So... one day...
this was before you were born.

189
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:54,332
I was coming home
after working hard all day.

190
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:59,069
And I saw them -- the bailiffs
attacking our homes.

191
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:02,408
Big bastards with hammers and
knives and all sorts of things.

192
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:04,481
But that didn't stop me
when I saw what they were at.

193
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:06,049
I went for them.

194
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:07,481
We fought for hours.

195
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:09,613
But there was too many altogether.

196
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,655
So, your ma and me and Lisa

197
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:14,553
we barricaded ourselves in
and we wouldn't come out.

198
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,991
You're need gonna take our homes
away from us.

199
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:18,652
And they couldn't get in,
no matter how hard they tried.

200
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:22,127
They huffed and they puffed,
but it was no use.

201
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:25,201
And all around us...

202
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:27,237
we could hear
the screaming and wailing

203
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:29,068
of our friends and neighbors

204
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,131
as they tore their houses
to little pieces.

205
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,371
Like savages they were.

206
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,638
They tried everything

207
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:38,541
but they didn't know me.

208
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:40,345
I wouldn't budge.

209
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:42,682
No matter if they brought the
whole place down around our ears.

210
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,252
And then the Mayor came!

211
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:46,187
That's right.

212
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:48,988
They were so pissed off
they couldn't get the better of me

213
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:53,052
the Lord Mayor of Dublin himself
come out to see your da.

214
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:54,660
Mr. Lynch.

215
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:57,724
Michael!

216
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:03,304
Michael! Michael, please,
if you'll just hear me.

217
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,002
Michael...

218
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:09,147
Get on your knees!

219
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:10,340
I'm pleading with you!

220
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,179
I personally have been authorized

221
00:13:12,285 --> 00:13:16,119
to offer you these keys
to two houses.

222
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:18,089
One for us and one for Auntie Lisa.

223
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:19,988
And I made him promise...

224
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:23,460
that no-one could ever take
our homes away from us again.

225
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:25,927
And the Mayor said...

226
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:30,594
Yes, I promise!

227
00:13:30,704 --> 00:13:33,900
So, I graciously
accepted their offer.

228
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:37,399
I won. I beat them all.

229
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:40,446
The bailiff and the Mayor
and the law.

230
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:44,346
I was loyal.
And that's why I won.

231
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:47,145
You see, the thing is...

232
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,949
they'll never beat you...

233
00:13:49,055 --> 00:13:52,923
if you stick together
and stay loyal.

234
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:08,432
Are they asleep?

235
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:14,009
It's time
for the tickle man.

236
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:20,375
See you tomorrow.

237
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:22,310
'Night.

238
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,107
Hiya, Michael.

239
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:44,575
Hey, Shaun.

240
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:55,512
You're late.

241
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:57,216
Sorry, bedtime stories.

242
00:14:57,325 --> 00:14:59,555
God! The Mansions again.

243
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:01,925
I bet that put 'em to sleep.

244
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:13,697
Christine asked me to ask you

245
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:17,069
would you mind looking
after Tom and Shane tomorrow.

246
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:19,647
She has to go into town to
get Breda her first communion gear.

247
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:21,382
No problem.

248
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:27,515
Are you ready for this?

249
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:29,146
Oh yeah.

250
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:34,161
I missed you.

251
00:15:49,276 --> 00:15:51,905
Fuck them! Don't answer!

252
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:59,484
No, gotta call Billy,
tell him what's happening.

253
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:02,122
Jesus! Fuck 'em!

254
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:08,393
Who was with you at the bank?

255
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:09,725
It was Stevie.

256
00:16:09,998 --> 00:16:12,523
No, no. Did Stevie drive the car?

257
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:14,568
Stevie drove the car, right?

258
00:16:14,636 --> 00:16:15,625
That's right.

259
00:16:15,904 --> 00:16:17,394
And Tony Brady was with you, yeah?

260
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:19,370
You see,
we know what you did, Lynch,

261
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:21,534
doing jobs
while you're out on bail.

262
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,577
And we have proof boy.

263
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:31,651
All you have to do is say,
''Yes, that's just the way it was''.

264
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:35,481
You drove to the courts
on a motorbike

265
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:38,115
and then you switched
at the last moment, right?

266
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:41,061
Fifteen minutes,
that's easy on a bike, Lynch.

267
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:42,657
Give us an answer,
you fucking gobshite!

268
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,924
All right, Con. Take it easy.

269
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:47,968
Shall we start all over again,
shall we?

270
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,062
You weren't with either of
your two wives Monday night

271
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:52,434
we know that much.

272
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:56,136
So, Michael, if you weren't
with the two ugly sisters

273
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:59,611
don't tell me you were off
banging some other old slag?

274
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:28,437
I realize you're not a golfing man,
Detective Sergeant

275
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:31,913
but...
the Association of Inspectors

276
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:34,213
and Superintendents Annual
Four Ball

277
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:35,309
had to be cancelled today.

278
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,389
Now, why do you think
it had to be cancelled?

279
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:40,252
Well, I did mention to you, sir,

280
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,225
that things like this usually
happen when we try to inter...

281
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,318
Don't be the smart Alec with me,
Noel.

282
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:45,657
I haev to tell you,

283
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:48,161
there's a lot of very unhappy
golfers here today.

284
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:51,360
This is vital rest and recreation
for senior officers.

285
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:54,165
Do you understand the importance
of this, Detective Sergeant?

286
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:55,364
Well I do now, sir.

287
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,034
Are you trying to tell me
''I told you so''?

288
00:17:58,476 --> 00:18:01,104
I'll tell you someting,
Detective Sergeant...

289
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:04,079
I will not have
the reputation of the Garda...

290
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:08,175
brought into disrepute
by these shenanigans.

291
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:11,983
We will not be intimidated
by the likes of Michael Lynch.

292
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,991
Are you listening to me now?

293
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:16,287
Christine wasn't upset, was she?

294
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,022
No, no, she's fine.

295
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:20,987
You see, every time
you go out on the road

296
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,191
there's dangers out there

297
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,327
bits of glass lying in wait nails,
pot-holes.

298
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,200
So you have to watch out,
watch your every move

299
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,606
coos otherwise they'll get you.

300
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,243
Who?

301
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,506
The bits of glass and that.

302
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,412
Sooner or later,
if you're not careful

303
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,248
and then you get a puncture
and then you're fucked.

304
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,981
And then you fix it for me.

305
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:46,683
Yeah, I do.
Aren't you a clever little shite.

306
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,984
Can I put the patch on now?

307
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,552
Don't wrinkle it.

308
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,528
Job's worth doing.

309
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:59,298
If a job's worth doing,
it's worth doing well.

310
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,906
That's right... cool.

311
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,379
That'll be the best way to park.

312
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,384
Fucking brilliant parking that was.

313
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,250
Shit!
A beaut.

314
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,916
Hey, Tony, you drive like
a bleeding old woman.

315
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,960
Fucking comedian...

316
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,935
Mad fuck.

317
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,410
Michael...

318
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,912
...the new fella, Shay Kirby...

319
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,647
doesn't bother you
he used to be in the IRA?

320
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,583
Nah, he's out a couple of years.

321
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,454
A bit doggy though, isn't it?

322
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,617
Look, why are you bringing him in?

323
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,088
He's the inside man on the job
I'm gonna tell you about.

324
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,027
Look, I understand.

325
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,361
While I'm talking I'll make
some crack about the Provos,

326
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,559
you watch how he reacts.

327
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,431
Tommy, come on, we're going.

328
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,468
Say goodbye to daddy.

329
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,367
Bue-bye, da.

330
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,404
By, chicken.

331
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:08,531
Bye lads.

332
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,108
Bye.

333
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,472
Bye, da.

334
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,407
All right, sitting down, lads.

335
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:16,080
One more round, Michael?

336
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:17,514
Little fella, sit down.

337
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,016
All right...

338
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,914
First, you've all met Shay Kirby.

339
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,182
How's it going?

340
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,015
Now, as you know...

341
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:31,223
I may be a bit occupied in the
Four Courts come Monday week.

342
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,390
Now, should go okay,
but you never know.

343
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,297
So I thought maybe now is the time

344
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,629
for a job I've been thinking about
the last few months.

345
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,171
One of those impossible ones.

346
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:42,036
Now, this is one the IRA
had their piggy little eyes on

347
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,269
but even they thought
it couldn't be done.

348
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:47,211
Well, lads, when I heard that
I thought to myself,

349
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,646
we're gonna have to show
those dozy fuckers a thing or two

350
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:53,447
about robbing
O'Donnell's jewellery factory.

351
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,487
Jesus Christ, Michael.

352
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:56,215
Bollocks, man!

353
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,187
What I was thinking was...

354
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:02,456
we wouldn't actually try to
break into the factory itself

355
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:07,126
but we'd sort of drop in.

356
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:18,238
Fuck. Jesus Christ!

357
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,319
And then sort of camp
out in the yard

358
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:36,557
until someone arrives to let us
in the next morning.

359
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,963
And that someone...

360
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:40,125
is Mr. Fintan Doorley
the General Manager.

361
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:43,432
Like myself, very precise man.

362
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:47,099
Fintan arrives
at five-to-eight every morning.

363
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:50,235
Now, as a man
who likes and needs routine

364
00:21:50,312 --> 00:21:53,441
he will probably be
a bit surprised at what he sees.

365
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:04,388
Good morning, Mr. Doorley.
We're here to steal your gold.

366
00:22:04,493 --> 00:22:05,960
Meet our esteemed leader.

367
00:22:06,063 --> 00:22:07,257
Good morning, staff.

368
00:22:07,363 --> 00:22:09,558
Identify yourselves.

369
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:16,069
Once inside
they'll meet Tony, Tom and Billy

370
00:22:16,172 --> 00:22:18,470
who'll invite them
to step into the marquee.

371
00:22:18,574 --> 00:22:21,065
And lads... Politely, okay?

372
00:22:21,143 --> 00:22:22,543
As long as
they're doing us no harm,

373
00:22:22,612 --> 00:22:24,204
we won't do them any harm.

374
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,339
Stop mucking around.
Do as you're told!

375
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,076
You got that, Billy?

376
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,014
What?

377
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:30,176
Just get the people inside.

378
00:22:30,286 --> 00:22:32,277
Blow up the air bed, love,
I'l be in in a minute.

379
00:22:32,388 --> 00:22:33,356
That's enough out of you, Billy.

380
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:34,923
Give us a kiss,
you big ride, you.

381
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:37,320
Yeah, yeah. Okay, Michael.

382
00:22:48,537 --> 00:22:51,734
So that at quarter-to-nine,
we all drive back out again.

383
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:53,441
And we can all relax

384
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:56,943
because it will be some time before
anyone gets to call the Gardai.

385
00:22:59,615 --> 00:23:02,584
Now does everyone have a picture
of that in their minds?

386
00:23:03,586 --> 00:23:07,454
Because, lads, I promise...

387
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:12,324
that's just the way
it's gonne be easy as pie.

388
00:23:15,464 --> 00:23:17,261
What age are you, Alec?

389
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:19,561
What, ten years younger than me?

390
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,967
Big difference.

391
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,998
Then Tony and Michael,
add another ten years on to that.

392
00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:26,398
Now, when they were kids
they had fuck all.

393
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:27,976
Ain't that right, Michael?

394
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:28,703
We had each other.

395
00:23:28,944 --> 00:23:30,242
True.

396
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,971
Now, I'm that much younger
so I got some stuff,

397
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,948
but it was never the right stuff.

398
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:37,247
What are you
shitting on about, man?

399
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:39,185
Billy, Billy knows
what I'm talking about, don't you?

400
00:23:39,288 --> 00:23:40,690
No.

401
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,357
For fuck's sake.

402
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,985
What was the big thing
when you were eight, say?

403
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:47,089
''Star Wars'', I suppose.
Is that what you mean?

404
00:23:47,198 --> 00:23:48,222
''Star Wars''.

405
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:50,529
Now, I bet you got the proper
''Star Wars'' stuff.

406
00:23:50,635 --> 00:23:53,195
You know, the real toys.
What were they called?

407
00:23:53,304 --> 00:23:55,364
Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader,
I had all that shite, man.

408
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:57,407
And it was the proper thing, yeah?
The official stuff?

409
00:23:57,475 --> 00:23:59,067
Yeah, so what?

410
00:23:59,177 --> 00:24:00,474
So, I never got that.

411
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:03,177
But, sure, me da probably robbed
the fucking things anyway.

412
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:04,441
It doesn't matter!

413
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:07,416
My ma and da couldn't even rob
the proper thing.

414
00:24:08,953 --> 00:24:10,944
That's a fucking tragedy, Stevie.

415
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:13,649
It is a fucking tragedy.

416
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:17,388
Fellas your age,
you got the proper thing.

417
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:20,488
And now my kids want
every fucking thing that's going.

418
00:24:20,598 --> 00:24:21,998
And you're gonna use
all your money

419
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:23,466
to make sure they get it.
Fair play to you.

420
00:24:23,534 --> 00:24:24,967
In me hole.

421
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:29,233
I'm gonna make up for all the stuff
I missed out on.

422
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,504
I'm gonna enjoy myself.

423
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,410
Go ahead Tom.

424
00:24:43,923 --> 00:24:44,911
Right, Michael.

425
00:24:46,158 --> 00:24:48,649
Now, the depth of this door
is just right.

426
00:24:49,995 --> 00:24:53,362
Now, once that panel is removed
the bars sit in there,

427
00:24:53,432 --> 00:24:55,491
nice and snug.

428
00:24:55,601 --> 00:24:57,967
Now, if you have enough of them,
they don't rattle around.

429
00:25:00,606 --> 00:25:02,575
And you don't even notice
the extra weight

430
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:05,006
when you're opening
and closing the door.

431
00:25:07,012 --> 00:25:10,175
Now this couple I've lined up
they're complete innocents

432
00:25:10,282 --> 00:25:11,544
that's the beauty of it

433
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,447
no extra splits.

434
00:25:13,552 --> 00:25:15,486
They're just
old friends of me da's.

435
00:25:15,588 --> 00:25:18,887
Couple in their fifties
Mr. and Mrs. Harmless.

436
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:20,288
And you know Customs...

437
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:24,557
while they're busy searching
bearded ex-hippies in their 2CVs

438
00:25:24,663 --> 00:25:27,532
they'll be tipping
their hats at our pair

439
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:29,124
as they chugger, chugger through

440
00:25:29,202 --> 00:25:30,931
at their usual
twenty-five miles an hour.

441
00:25:31,037 --> 00:25:33,505
Then they drive all the way over
to the Cotswolds.

442
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:36,040
They've told me all about
this lovely hotel

443
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:39,102
it's so quiet and peaceful that
they always go back every year.

444
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,606
This is how I see it all happening,
Michael.

445
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,213
It's not too far from Birmingham,
right,

446
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:48,982
so I can fly in be at their hotel
inwhat, half an hour.

447
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,582
They'll be there taking afternoon tea
completely unaware

448
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,355
that they've a couple of
hundred thousand quids'

449
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:56,623
worth of gold
sitting outside in the car.

450
00:26:02,503 --> 00:26:05,473
There'll be no more than,
what a dozen cars parked there

451
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:08,167
no security, so getting
at the car'll be no problem.

452
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:10,302
Bing, bang, boom. Get the gold

453
00:26:10,411 --> 00:26:11,343
bring it to the fence.

454
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,676
Tom, it all sounds fine.

455
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:15,973
I'll see you when you get back, so.

456
00:26:17,018 --> 00:26:21,010
Don't worry about it, Michael.
You can trust me.

457
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:26,954
Hi, Uncle Billy.

458
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:31,431
Come here to me, chicken.
Come here to me.

459
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:34,959
Oh, look at you.

460
00:26:35,036 --> 00:26:37,231
My God,
are you an angel or a princess?

461
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:38,237
Isn't she gorgeous?

462
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:41,365
Come here to me. Tell me this would
that buy a few rosary beads eh?

463
00:26:43,077 --> 00:26:44,943
Come here.
What do you say to Mr. Higgins?

464
00:26:45,046 --> 00:26:45,535
Thank you.

465
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:46,670
No problem, love.

466
00:26:46,914 --> 00:26:48,006
Good girl, good girl.
Now, come here to me, listen.

467
00:26:48,082 --> 00:26:48,947
Go on uupstairs, right,

468
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,038
and I'll be with you
in a few minutes.

469
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:50,981
All right, chicken, go on.

470
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:53,144
Save us a dance, love,
will you?

471
00:26:56,057 --> 00:26:57,615
Who's your man there
with Billy?

472
00:26:57,725 --> 00:26:59,124
Higgins is his name.

473
00:26:59,594 --> 00:27:02,961
Grew up around here all right.
Went to college, you know.

474
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,021
IRA I heard.

475
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:08,660
Funny thing, he looks more like you
than your brother does.

476
00:27:08,736 --> 00:27:10,135
Same haircut anyway.

477
00:27:10,238 --> 00:27:11,500
Yeah, yeah.

478
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:15,099
I'm telling you.

479
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,008
Yeah, I know, I'm not gonna
fuck it up all right?

480
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:20,306
Thanks for the lift.

481
00:27:20,382 --> 00:27:23,011
Da, da, look what granny gave me.

482
00:27:23,085 --> 00:27:24,279
What is it, chicken?

483
00:27:24,386 --> 00:27:27,914
It's a holy book
with lots of pictures.

484
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:29,651
Oh, isn't that brilliant?

485
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:31,688
What I'd give to
have a present like that.

486
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,424
That's what I'd like to know
where did you come from?

487
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:36,657
Guess.

488
00:27:36,932 --> 00:27:41,666
Mickey, you know that job that
Tom was doing for you in England?

489
00:27:41,937 --> 00:27:43,496
Yeah.

490
00:27:43,572 --> 00:27:46,133
What I mean, Mike,
even though I always knew that

491
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:49,109
Tom was a bit of a fucking eject
you know, he was sound.

492
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,145
I mean, if you'd asked me
that's what I'd have told you.

493
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,917
Looks like
he's done a runner and...

494
00:27:57,986 --> 00:28:00,148
there's no car and there's no gold.

495
00:28:00,255 --> 00:28:02,019
Yeah.

496
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,456
So what do you wanna do?

497
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:07,586
Why the fuck did he think
he could get away with it?

498
00:28:07,664 --> 00:28:09,222
It's not like him,
I'll say that for him.

499
00:28:09,699 --> 00:28:12,328
And mind you, can you ever
trust anyone these days?

500
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:14,926
Yeah, you can.
That's what it's all about.

501
00:28:15,004 --> 00:28:17,473
Wouldn't have asked him to
do the job if I didn't trust him.

502
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:21,166
What now?

503
00:28:21,277 --> 00:28:23,108
You go find him. Bring him back.

504
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:24,874
Okay.

505
00:28:24,981 --> 00:28:25,572
Tony...

506
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:26,477
Yeah?

507
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:28,642
You can finish your dinner first.

508
00:28:39,629 --> 00:28:41,894
Jesus, are you gonna queue up?

509
00:28:41,965 --> 00:28:45,127
I'll have to, won't I
unless you've any better ideas?

510
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:47,668
Well, I can get you in there
no bother. Private tour.

511
00:28:47,937 --> 00:28:50,497
No, thanks,
I'll try the front door.

512
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:52,233
Fair enough.
Listen, I've gotta go.

513
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:54,640
Got this stupid fucking court thing
in half-an-hour.

514
00:28:54,711 --> 00:28:55,700
Enjoy yourself.

515
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,913
I will.
You'll be all right, will you?

516
00:28:58,015 --> 00:28:59,312
Course.

517
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,081
My Lord, may I request
an adjournment of proceedings

518
00:29:09,193 --> 00:29:10,124
until Wednesday?

519
00:29:10,227 --> 00:29:12,058
Application refused.

520
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:13,493
but, my Lord, Mr. Harrison...

521
00:29:13,597 --> 00:29:19,002
the prosecution is ready,
the jury is ready, I am ready.

522
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:23,597
Your client cannot avoid
the process of law indefinitely.

523
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:27,041
Mr. McHale, are you ready to begin?

524
00:29:27,144 --> 00:29:28,509
Certainly, my Lord.

525
00:29:31,515 --> 00:29:34,609
Almost two years ago
on the nineteenth of February

526
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:37,684
the defendant, Michael Lynch
and an unknown associate

527
00:29:37,922 --> 00:29:41,050
entered the premises of Superex
a video game company.

528
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:43,218
They were armed and dangerous.

529
00:29:43,294 --> 00:29:45,592
They threatened the life
of a member of staff

530
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:48,689
and stole over
thirty-two thousand pounds in cash.

531
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:52,066
Listen, Michael...

532
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:55,505
See this?

533
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:57,972
Yeah?

534
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:00,100
Can I hang it up in our room?

535
00:30:00,211 --> 00:30:02,042
What do you want
a holy picture for?

536
00:30:02,413 --> 00:30:04,710
It's not a holy picture,
it's a Caravaggio.

537
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:06,278
He's about as holy as you are.

538
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:07,908
Well, it looks like
a holy picture to me.

539
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:09,543
Can I hang it up, or can't I?

540
00:30:10,187 --> 00:30:10,676
Of course.

541
00:30:10,955 --> 00:30:12,387
And you wont' be
slagging me about it?

542
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:13,923
I promise.

543
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:15,920
Grand.

544
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:21,160
Can I go to the toilet, da?

545
00:30:21,265 --> 00:30:22,426
Of course.

546
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:26,437
Do you get the feeling
I don't believe you, Tom?

547
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:31,606
Please, Michael... please!
I swear...

548
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,371
I mean, even if it is true,
these old ones

549
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:35,538
got their car door
ripped off by a passing Land Rover

550
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:37,741
and then left it abandoned
on the side of the road.

551
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:40,575
I searched, Michael.
I drove up and down.

552
00:30:40,651 --> 00:30:43,951
I found the car and I even
put a new door on it an' all.

553
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:48,618
I fucked up, you know,
and I was, I was afraid.

554
00:30:48,695 --> 00:30:51,492
So you don't think
I'm a fair man then, Tom?

555
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:53,231
No.

556
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:56,567
No, it's not, it's not that,
Michael, it's...

557
00:30:58,371 --> 00:31:03,239
Please, Michael...
I'm sorry, please.

558
00:31:04,444 --> 00:31:06,275
What did you do with the gold?

559
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:08,176
Oh, God...

560
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:11,540
I did nothing!

561
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:14,517
I never got it, I never!

562
00:31:15,088 --> 00:31:18,023
It's gone. You have to believe me.

563
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,956
But you ran away, Tom.

564
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,984
Only scumbags run away.

565
00:31:23,096 --> 00:31:25,086
You can't trust someone
who does that, can you?

566
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:26,721
I mean, would you trust them, Tom?
Would you?

567
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,194
No, no, I wouldn't.

568
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,049
So you see why this is a problem
I have to deal with, don't you?

569
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:45,483
I mean, I can't leave it
hanging around, can I?

570
00:31:45,586 --> 00:31:46,610
Yeah, I know...

571
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:48,119
Where's the gold?

572
00:31:48,222 --> 00:31:49,655
I don't know.

573
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:55,761
What do you think?

574
00:31:55,995 --> 00:31:58,521
I don't know, Michael, I...

575
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:04,167
I'm not certain...
or anything like...

576
00:32:04,238 --> 00:32:05,603
I'd nearly believe him, Michael.

577
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:06,694
Yeah, I think you're right.

578
00:32:06,974 --> 00:32:10,102
His story is so stupid
it's probably true.

579
00:32:10,611 --> 00:32:12,203
All rigth, let him down.

580
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,646
I'm sorry, Tom.
I believe your story now.

581
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:21,318
Tony'll take you to the hospital.

582
00:32:22,056 --> 00:32:23,215
Oh, you're on the medical card,
aren't you?

583
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:25,383
I mean this won't
cost you anything, will it?

584
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:26,221
No.

585
00:32:26,293 --> 00:32:28,694
Grand, night. Lads.

586
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:34,158
And will the accused sit up

587
00:32:34,236 --> 00:32:37,693
and let us see his face, please!

588
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:42,375
The accused is a very clever man.

589
00:32:42,444 --> 00:32:45,277
But the extraordinary thing
about him

590
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,575
is that he seems unable to resist

591
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:51,209
letting the rest of the world
know how clever he is.

592
00:32:51,318 --> 00:32:53,287
sometimes I think
he's not a real criminal at all,

593
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,948
he's just a big show-off.

594
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:09,594
How are things, Michael?

595
00:33:09,703 --> 00:33:10,966
Fair, Shay.
What'll you have?

596
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:12,334
No, I'm grand.

597
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:16,566
Is everything all right,
Michael?

598
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:19,673
Yeah, fine.

599
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:25,714
Oh, it's just this...
there's this judge...

600
00:33:25,986 --> 00:33:27,920
he's getting on my nerves.

601
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:31,550
He's prejudiced, you know.

602
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:32,422
Is that right?

603
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:39,431
That's his daughter's car.
Do you think you could find it?

604
00:33:40,502 --> 00:33:42,128
Consider it done.

605
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,667
Trial's supposed to end
on Thursday

606
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,969
will that give you enough time
to send them a bit of a message?

607
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:52,471
A ''frightener''?

608
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,379
It has to be timed just right.

609
00:33:57,218 --> 00:33:58,650
Give me the keys, love.

610
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:00,480
Thanks for the lunch, sir...

611
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:02,385
and a very stimulating
conversation.

612
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,690
Bye, dad. Hope we didn't
outstay our welcome.

613
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,261
Not at all, Moira.

614
00:34:10,365 --> 00:34:12,334
Mind you, he does like the osund of
his own voice, doesn't he?

615
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:17,361
You're one to talk.

616
00:34:21,077 --> 00:34:22,942
In conclusion...

617
00:34:23,012 --> 00:34:25,344
whatever the jury's feelings
may be...

618
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:30,715
as to what seems
the just conclusion to draw...

619
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:33,148
I must remind you that...

620
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:38,455
if the available evidence is not
sufficient for a conviction

621
00:34:38,562 --> 00:34:40,928
then...

622
00:34:41,964 --> 00:34:44,934
you must not convict.

623
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,999
This is another disaster
for the Gardai, isn't it?

624
00:34:51,108 --> 00:34:52,700
Mr. Lynch has been found not guilty.

625
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:54,944
That is not to say that the Gardai

626
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:59,038
are pursuing anyone else
in connection with this crime.

627
00:34:59,149 --> 00:35:00,343
It's also not to say that

628
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,350
the Gardai will
cease its investigations

629
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:03,750
in the activities
of Mr. Michael Lynch.

630
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,346
Do you think the justice system is
too soft on criminals, Michael?

631
00:35:06,457 --> 00:35:08,288
Michael, how can you afford such
an expensive legal team, Mr. Lynch?

632
00:35:08,393 --> 00:35:09,655
Are you back on the dole, Michael?

633
00:35:09,761 --> 00:35:12,321
Now that you're innocent,
can you show us your face?

634
00:35:12,397 --> 00:35:13,421
Daddy.

635
00:35:13,498 --> 00:35:14,988
There's daddy
with the black hood on him.

636
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:16,225
That's right.

637
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,528
Da, why are you wearing
a black hood?

638
00:35:17,634 --> 00:35:19,034
Cos, I don't want them to see me.

639
00:35:19,137 --> 00:35:21,970
...that Mr. Michael Lynch
is not a funny man.

640
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,598
All right, now, kids, who is he?

641
00:35:23,674 --> 00:35:25,005
A Garda.

642
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:26,076
Is he a pig, da?

643
00:35:26,177 --> 00:35:27,371
You're both right,
but you never call him a pig.

644
00:35:27,478 --> 00:35:28,410
Pay attention to him,
call him a Garda

645
00:35:28,513 --> 00:35:30,413
and never trust him
or anyone like him.

646
00:35:30,515 --> 00:35:32,710
Come on, play it, Michael.
Are me and Lisa in it?

647
00:35:32,984 --> 00:35:34,382
It's just a little bit
you have to watch

648
00:35:34,452 --> 00:35:35,350
it's in the, the beginning...

649
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,354
Hey, that's us.We're famous.

650
00:35:37,422 --> 00:35:39,481
We're not the stars of the show,
of course.

651
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,251
We'd only be like extras, you know.

652
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:44,254
Will you go and play outside,
please.

653
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:45,260
Are you going home?

654
00:35:45,363 --> 00:35:46,694
We've gotta go home in a minute.

655
00:35:46,964 --> 00:35:47,930
All right, come on,
we'll watch it again in a while.

656
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:50,000
Get your coats.

657
00:35:56,206 --> 00:35:59,040
But it does seem that the Gardai
just can't control

658
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:00,543
the spiral of crime
in the city right now.

659
00:36:00,612 --> 00:36:01,636
Does it?

660
00:36:15,561 --> 00:36:16,493
Billy.

661
00:36:17,196 --> 00:36:18,458
Billy!
How are youse?

662
00:36:18,564 --> 00:36:20,622
Billy, how are you?

663
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,499
God, you're looking well tonight.

664
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,501
I like the suit there, big fella.
Thanks. How are you doing?

665
00:36:24,602 --> 00:36:26,627
Right, fine.
How are you, Michael?

666
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:28,702
Lisa and Christine, isn't it?

667
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:31,306
Sorry, I'm not sure which is which.
Dark, you know.

668
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,434
Who's that?

669
00:36:32,544 --> 00:36:34,944
It's Jerome Higgins.
He wants to talk to you.

670
00:36:35,013 --> 00:36:37,038
Jerome Higgins?

671
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:40,008
Since when yhave you become
the messenger boy for the IRA,

672
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:40,949
little fella?

673
00:36:41,053 --> 00:36:41,951
Talk to him, will you?

674
00:36:42,054 --> 00:36:43,987
A few minutes,
that's all, honestly,

675
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:45,078
it's no trouble or anything.

676
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,422
What's the problem, Michael?

677
00:36:49,495 --> 00:36:52,055
I don't like being told what to do,
that's the problem.

678
00:36:55,968 --> 00:36:57,265
It's grand.

679
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:01,302
I won't be long. Okay?

680
00:37:01,372 --> 00:37:03,170
Billy.

681
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,973
Conversing with the riff-raff.

682
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,442
Glad our man, Shay Kirby,

683
00:37:09,547 --> 00:37:11,573
was able to help you out
with that Judge, Michael.

684
00:37:11,683 --> 00:37:13,173
Shay doesn't work with you
any more.

685
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:16,311
But his training, Michael.
His methods.

686
00:37:16,421 --> 00:37:17,547
What are you looking for?

687
00:37:17,655 --> 00:37:19,089
Well, I was just saying
to Billy there

688
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:20,920
that I think
there could be a lot of merit

689
00:37:21,025 --> 00:37:22,653
in a bit of co-operation
between us.

690
00:37:23,561 --> 00:37:25,051
Well, I don't.

691
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,961
Billy wouldn't agree with you there

692
00:37:27,065 --> 00:37:29,556
and we've done a few favours
for your Billy.

693
00:37:29,635 --> 00:37:30,498
Now, I suppose you know that

694
00:37:30,602 --> 00:37:33,400
we had our eye on
O'Donnells Jewellery as well.

695
00:37:34,973 --> 00:37:35,632
Tough shite.

696
00:37:35,707 --> 00:37:38,608
Because we thought a reasonable
cut from the what?

697
00:37:38,676 --> 00:37:42,704
Two million, I believe, would be
a nice gesture to us, Michael.

698
00:37:42,982 --> 00:37:45,314
Call it a symbol
of future collaboration.

699
00:37:45,385 --> 00:37:48,445
How about a symbol
of future fuck all?

700
00:37:48,555 --> 00:37:50,182
You've neither the fucking brains

701
00:37:50,256 --> 00:37:51,245
or the gumption
to do your own robbing

702
00:37:51,323 --> 00:37:53,121
so you think
you can come around here

703
00:37:53,225 --> 00:37:54,420
and squeeze an ordinary
decent criminal, like me,

704
00:37:54,527 --> 00:37:56,426
who knows something about his job.

705
00:37:56,496 --> 00:37:59,623
Fuck off and double fuck off,
Jerome.

706
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:02,398
Night, little fella.

707
00:38:03,102 --> 00:38:04,090
Excuse me.

708
00:38:06,238 --> 00:38:08,230
Oh, and,
no hard feelings by the way.

709
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,569
God loves a trier

710
00:38:09,676 --> 00:38:11,405
and keep your eye on the papers,
Higgins...

711
00:38:11,511 --> 00:38:13,672
cos that'll be the first place
you hear about my next job

712
00:38:13,746 --> 00:38:15,145
when it's all over the front pages.

713
00:38:15,215 --> 00:38:17,514
The biggest yet.
Way out of your league.

714
00:38:17,617 --> 00:38:18,949
What job are you talking about,
Michael?

715
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:20,486
Don't ask me, I'm making it up
as I go along.

716
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:40,336
M, it's me.

717
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,603
Hi, Michael.

718
00:38:47,682 --> 00:38:50,310
Look, I'm really sorry about that
you know. Look, I'm really...

719
00:38:50,418 --> 00:38:52,147
Christine!

720
00:38:53,288 --> 00:38:57,122
So, you got caught dealing and
now you're in hock to the IRA.

721
00:38:58,693 --> 00:39:00,422
You fucking spaz.

722
00:39:00,528 --> 00:39:02,497
I want you out of Dublin, fast,
little fella.

723
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:04,498
England, the States,
I don't care where.

724
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,296
But keep away from them
and keep away from me.

725
00:39:14,076 --> 00:39:15,941
I'm sorry, Michael.

726
00:39:51,114 --> 00:39:53,605
Mostly he enede up
doing religious painting

727
00:39:53,684 --> 00:39:56,585
but that's only cos that's
where the money was in those days.

728
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:59,588
Cardinals and Bishops were
always hiring artists

729
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:00,657
to paint scenes from the Bible.

730
00:40:00,924 --> 00:40:04,553
And Lords, of course, trying to
show of how holy they were.

731
00:40:05,062 --> 00:40:08,429
He had to do a runner out of Rome
for killing some fella in a fight.

732
00:40:08,498 --> 00:40:10,557
Bit of a fucking headcase,
do you know.

733
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:15,136
Michael, this isn't right.

734
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:18,497
Excuse me, my, my wife,
she needs to...

735
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,722
See Jesus and Judas...

736
00:40:41,965 --> 00:40:45,366
Caravaggio used fellas
off the street as his models.

737
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:48,063
He hung around bars and
whorehouses all the time

738
00:40:48,171 --> 00:40:51,732
picked out someone interesting
to be Jesus or whoever.

739
00:40:52,342 --> 00:40:54,276
I think he got a kick out of that,
you know...

740
00:40:54,378 --> 00:40:57,347
having Cardinals on their knees...

741
00:40:57,447 --> 00:41:00,575
praying away to some painting
of a murderer or something.

742
00:41:01,518 --> 00:41:03,452
What are you laughing at?

743
00:41:04,154 --> 00:41:05,348
Oh, nothing.

744
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,083
I was just thinking about
what lasts, you know,

745
00:41:09,192 --> 00:41:10,056
and who gets the benefit.

746
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:12,255
I mean, your man who painted this

747
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:14,992
he never saw any of the money
it's supposed to be worth, right?

748
00:41:15,366 --> 00:41:17,062
But he gets the reputation though

749
00:41:17,136 --> 00:41:19,399
I mean, people remember who he is.

750
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,495
And that's the thing, isn't it?

751
00:41:22,141 --> 00:41:24,574
You're afraid no-one'll
remember you after you're dead?

752
00:41:25,676 --> 00:41:27,576
I think
you should take up painting.

753
00:41:27,678 --> 00:41:29,407
Why? So I'll be remembered?

754
00:41:29,515 --> 00:41:31,175
Nah. So you could do the kitchen.

755
00:41:50,635 --> 00:41:51,602
Hello, yeah?

756
00:41:51,702 --> 00:41:53,033
Father Grogan?

757
00:41:53,137 --> 00:41:54,536
Paul Grogan, yes, that's me.

758
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:56,369
My name's Christine.

759
00:41:56,474 --> 00:41:58,271
I phoned you about the Caravaggio.

760
00:41:58,376 --> 00:41:59,707
Oh, yes, of course.

761
00:41:59,777 --> 00:42:01,473
Come in, you're welcome.

762
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,040
Oh, the painting was hanging
right down here for years

763
00:42:06,118 --> 00:42:08,747
looking down at everyone
having their supper

764
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:12,149
and no-one took any notice of it.

765
00:42:12,257 --> 00:42:15,249
Getting dirtier and dirtier.

766
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:21,622
Then one day I was celebrating Mass
in our little chapel upstairs

767
00:42:21,733 --> 00:42:24,202
remind me to show it to you
before you go.

768
00:42:24,303 --> 00:42:29,434
Anyway, this morning
it was Luke's wonderfully moving

769
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:32,237
account of Veronica
washing the face of Jesus.

770
00:42:32,344 --> 00:42:36,713
And I thought, we must have
that beautiful painting cleaned.

771
00:42:36,982 --> 00:42:39,382
No idea
what was about to be uncovered

772
00:42:39,486 --> 00:42:41,248
a Caravaggio...

773
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:43,082
I mean, a priceless original.

774
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:45,122
It was a pity for us in a way,
of course,

775
00:42:45,224 --> 00:42:47,522
because it was lovely to
have it there.

776
00:42:47,593 --> 00:42:51,029
But, well...
as soon as we knew its value

777
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,461
we knew it couldn't stay here.

778
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:56,968
I mean any half decent thief
could just walk in.

779
00:42:57,035 --> 00:42:59,561
The gallery made us
that very fine copy though.

780
00:42:59,672 --> 00:43:00,764
Same size and all?

781
00:43:01,007 --> 00:43:03,032
Oh, yes, an absolute replica.

782
00:43:03,576 --> 00:43:05,511
Oh, I couldn't tell the difference.

783
00:43:05,578 --> 00:43:07,637
What about an art expert?

784
00:43:07,714 --> 00:43:10,410
Well, he or she
would spot it in seconds.

785
00:43:10,518 --> 00:43:12,178
If it really is
worth thirty million

786
00:43:12,252 --> 00:43:14,015
why didn't you sell it
to the gallery

787
00:43:14,087 --> 00:43:15,145
rather than giving it to them?

788
00:43:15,255 --> 00:43:18,623
Well, not blowing
our own trumpets now

789
00:43:18,725 --> 00:43:23,958
but I suppose we just thought
it was the right thing to do.

790
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:44,641
Won't be long,
about ten minutes I suspect.

791
00:43:44,752 --> 00:43:46,344
Okay, lads, good luck.

792
00:44:25,226 --> 00:44:27,193
What the bloody hell's he doing?

793
00:45:06,034 --> 00:45:06,966
Get out of the car.

794
00:45:07,035 --> 00:45:08,731
Get out of the fucking car!

795
00:45:20,682 --> 00:45:22,343
Yes!

796
00:45:22,451 --> 00:45:24,282
Did you see their fucking faces?

797
00:45:25,988 --> 00:45:27,352
Raferty van, that's it, that's it.

798
00:45:27,422 --> 00:45:29,288
Get after him, Con.
Turn the car around, get her round!

799
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:30,722
Shut up. I'm, like, doing it.

800
00:45:30,993 --> 00:45:32,721
Oh their tail.
We'll lose them, hurry up!

801
00:45:32,995 --> 00:45:34,656
Would you, for fuck's sake,
just shut up!

802
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:54,679
Okay, we're up on them.

803
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,577
Right, steady as you go, Con,
steady as you go now.

804
00:45:56,686 --> 00:45:57,277
Nice and handy.

805
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:58,546
Fuck!

806
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,589
The door's open, now's your chance.

807
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,488
What's the fucking matter with you?
It's only a picture!

808
00:46:02,558 --> 00:46:05,425
Jesus Christ!
Come on.

809
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,701
I knew we were a country
that respects art.

810
00:46:18,374 --> 00:46:20,365
Yes.

811
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:23,577
You never mind if there's bastards
out there trying to get you.

812
00:46:23,646 --> 00:46:25,638
They're only satisfied
when they can grind you down,

813
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:27,910
keep you poor, put you away.

814
00:46:27,983 --> 00:46:30,419
They don't count. Not with us.

815
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,718
In fact, I think we can give them
the run around any time we like

816
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:34,286
cos they're only eejits.

817
00:46:34,357 --> 00:46:35,985
Mentioning no names like.

818
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:39,119
And this thing of me becoming
a bit of a TV star lately

819
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:40,720
I want you all to know

820
00:46:40,997 --> 00:46:45,264
it's not gonna change me
one little bit.

821
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,637
Come on,
I wanna show you something.

822
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:49,968
We're top of the ratings, lads.

823
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:51,268
They might even give us
our own series.

824
00:46:51,374 --> 00:46:56,209
...valuable painting Caravaggio,
''The Taking of Christ''

825
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:56,608
was stolen in broad daylight

826
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,378
by an unknown criminal gang
posing as American tourists.

827
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:04,215
And none of them have
a fucking clue as to who did it.

828
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,513
Oh, you wanna see the bum shot?

829
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:10,387
What the fuck is a bum shot?

830
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,659
Oh, Jesus.

831
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,230
Look at that arse on you, man.

832
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,361
Michael, the painting,
how are we gonna get rid of it?

833
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:23,963
It's all sussed.

834
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,632
Alec is going to Amsterdam
next week to see a fence.

835
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,069
Let him make us an offer.

836
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,669
But the crack is, in the meantime
while we're waiting for all of that

837
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:33,108
we can just sit back
and watch the Gardai

838
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,241
make a pig's mickey of it.

839
00:47:34,317 --> 00:47:36,308
I'll drink to that.

840
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:39,584
Michael, any idea how much we'll
get for this holy picture here?

841
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:41,987
Like, just cos
it's valued at thirty million.

842
00:47:42,058 --> 00:47:44,083
We'll get enough to get rich,
don't worry.

843
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,458
The point is, we've won.

844
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:50,000
I mean, you see ths,
you see all this?

845
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,194
Think about what it means.

846
00:47:53,405 --> 00:47:56,067
We're number one,
not the Gardai

847
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:58,665
not the IRA, not anyone else.

848
00:47:58,944 --> 00:48:01,639
The whole country is in awe of us.

849
00:48:01,746 --> 00:48:03,646
Because of a little divine
intervention here from...

850
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:05,716
we're bigger than Riverdance.

851
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:10,115
One day at a time...

852
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:17,095
sweet Jesus,
that's all I'm asking of you

853
00:48:17,163 --> 00:48:25,160
Just give me the strength to
do everything that I have to do

854
00:48:25,238 --> 00:48:30,198
Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus

855
00:48:30,275 --> 00:48:35,077
And tomorrow may never be mine

856
00:48:42,155 --> 00:48:43,452
I think this is the signal.

857
00:48:43,523 --> 00:48:44,387
Watch... see?

858
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:46,616
Spot on.

859
00:48:46,692 --> 00:48:48,956
Well, it's the signal itself
that got to me, sir.

860
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:50,494
Well, you're right,
he's giving a signal but...

861
00:48:50,563 --> 00:48:52,463
he's imitating the painting, sir.

862
00:48:52,565 --> 00:48:54,533
Same as your man Judas there.

863
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,000
Oh, right, very clever, but...

864
00:48:56,068 --> 00:48:58,036
Yeah, it's smart.

865
00:48:58,104 --> 00:49:01,971
Obviously someone that likes a gag.
Someone that likes a joke.

866
00:49:02,074 --> 00:49:04,440
That's what made me realise
it's Michael Lynch.

867
00:49:04,544 --> 00:49:06,672
We can't get a positive ID
from that picture, sir,

868
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:10,280
but I did body size and shape
comparisons with Lynch and Brady.

869
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,545
Heads, heights, everything,
they match.

870
00:49:12,653 --> 00:49:14,711
Very interesting, Noel, well doen.

871
00:49:15,189 --> 00:49:17,452
Good to see the gizmos being
put to use and so on,

872
00:49:17,523 --> 00:49:19,583
but it's a coincidence.

873
00:49:19,692 --> 00:49:21,353
Your nose alone
should tell you that

874
00:49:21,462 --> 00:49:23,622
Lynch is not capable of
this kind of thing.

875
00:49:23,696 --> 00:49:25,994
I went back over
some of the security videos

876
00:49:26,065 --> 00:49:27,033
from the art gallery, sir.
I found this.

877
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:31,037
Lynch and his wife Christine
on a day out.

878
00:49:31,104 --> 00:49:32,504
I know it's not
evidence of anything, sir

879
00:49:32,573 --> 00:49:35,064
but what the fuck
is Michael Lynch doing

880
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:36,904
at a seventeenth century
Italian art exhibition?

881
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,274
My wife went to that exhibition!

882
00:49:39,379 --> 00:49:41,974
I'm sorry, but we'd look like fools

883
00:49:42,081 --> 00:49:44,379
presenting that idea
to the top lads in Interlope.

884
00:49:44,485 --> 00:49:47,214
If my training with the FBI
has taught me anything,

885
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,982
it's these specialist robberies

886
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:51,080
are the preserve of
a few international gangs.

887
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:55,320
Germans, Dutch, art thieves that
really know their business.

888
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:56,690
Come on, Noel, admit it.

889
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:59,365
Lynch just isn't in that league.

890
00:50:05,105 --> 00:50:06,073
Behave yourself.

891
00:50:12,147 --> 00:50:14,137
Oh, charge it to room 764, please.

892
00:50:14,249 --> 00:50:17,479
No... Peter. In fairness you've
travelled a long way to meet us.

893
00:50:17,552 --> 00:50:19,143
You have to let me pay this time.

894
00:50:19,254 --> 00:50:21,312
Hey, you know it's no problem.

895
00:50:21,423 --> 00:50:22,446
You'll be paying
the hotel bill anyway.

896
00:50:22,524 --> 00:50:23,319
Hey, Alec, he's right.
He's fucking right.

897
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:24,618
So we will.

898
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:27,286
Hey, I like your style, Peter.

899
00:50:27,394 --> 00:50:29,295
Smart fella there.
I like that.

900
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:31,057
Oh phone call. Won't be long.

901
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:33,690
Hey, Peter, I think that slapper
over there has her eye on you.

902
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:34,632
What's a slapper?

903
00:50:34,736 --> 00:50:37,602
Yeah... no, yeah, no,
half eleven's fine, yea...

904
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:39,138
No... I'll be there, yeah...

905
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:42,436
It's certainly not the MO
of any gang that we know.

906
00:50:42,509 --> 00:50:44,603
Which suggests very strongly that

907
00:50:44,678 --> 00:50:47,409
it's a very clever
local Irish operation.

908
00:50:47,514 --> 00:50:51,006
You've probably come to that
conclusion yourselves already.

909
00:50:51,086 --> 00:50:53,280
Oh yes, oh, indeed, aye.

910
00:50:54,556 --> 00:50:57,491
Well, of course we're
pretty confident at this stage

911
00:50:57,592 --> 00:51:00,719
that this is the work of
a gang led by Michael Lynch.

912
00:51:00,995 --> 00:51:03,294
Now, I'm personally familiar
with Lynch's MO

913
00:51:03,398 --> 00:51:06,299
and though normally art theft
isn't really histhing,

914
00:51:06,401 --> 00:51:09,369
this particular robbery seems to
have his mark on it all right.

915
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:12,403
If you know who you're dealing with

916
00:51:12,507 --> 00:51:15,305
it will make a recovery operation
much easier.

917
00:51:16,945 --> 00:51:20,107
We know that someone here in Dublin

918
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:23,241
has made contact with a fence
in Amsterdam.

919
00:51:23,318 --> 00:51:24,944
Let us call him Peter.

920
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:26,680
Peter had made contact with us

921
00:51:26,955 --> 00:51:29,013
to offer his co-operation.

922
00:51:55,683 --> 00:51:57,480
Good afternoon, lads.

923
00:51:57,553 --> 00:51:58,075
All set?

924
00:51:58,187 --> 00:51:59,017
All ready, sir.

925
00:51:59,088 --> 00:52:00,145
Noel...

926
00:52:00,221 --> 00:52:01,484
Yes, sir?

927
00:52:02,058 --> 00:52:02,752
Get to work.

928
00:52:03,024 --> 00:52:03,992
Right away, sir.

929
00:52:11,233 --> 00:52:12,325
Whatever you do,

930
00:52:12,436 --> 00:52:13,595
don't say anything to him
about where you're taking him,

931
00:52:13,703 --> 00:52:15,364
or mention anything
about the painting at all.

932
00:52:15,472 --> 00:52:16,370
Okay.

933
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,964
Not a word.

934
00:52:18,075 --> 00:52:19,063
I mean it. Good luck.

935
00:52:19,176 --> 00:52:20,404
See you there, Michael.

936
00:52:21,677 --> 00:52:24,044
Do you like art, generally?

937
00:52:24,114 --> 00:52:26,548
What do you think of the painting?

938
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:30,176
Oh, I couldn't give a shite, man,
to be honest with you.

939
00:52:30,287 --> 00:52:33,552
Well, it's a beautiful Caravaggio,
isn't it?

940
00:52:35,759 --> 00:52:37,624
Well, of course I realize,

941
00:52:37,728 --> 00:52:41,129
well, I suppse that
money is your main interest.

942
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:46,092
I can tell you,
you don't like to talk,

943
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,263
you have no interest
in conversation.

944
00:52:48,372 --> 00:52:51,068
Not true. I love a good chat, man.

945
00:52:53,244 --> 00:52:56,043
So, these are the beautiful
Dublin mountains.

946
00:52:56,148 --> 00:52:57,273
Spotter plane.

947
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,643
They've got it, sir.

948
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,340
All right.

949
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:03,417
Let's hope
the weather remains fine,

950
00:53:03,522 --> 00:53:05,386
especially if
we have to view outdoors.

951
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,033
Where do you want it?

952
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:16,393
The Caravaggio?

953
00:53:16,502 --> 00:53:17,628
Upright somewhere.

954
00:53:17,735 --> 00:53:18,667
Lean it against the tree there.

955
00:53:18,736 --> 00:53:20,261
It's so strange to be standing on
a wooded mountain top

956
00:53:20,371 --> 00:53:25,605
looking at one of the great
marvels of Renaissance art.

957
00:53:25,711 --> 00:53:28,373
''The Taking Of Christ'',
by Caravaggio.

958
00:53:33,353 --> 00:53:35,184
What are you shouting for?

959
00:53:39,325 --> 00:53:40,485
Oh, sorry, was I?

960
00:53:41,528 --> 00:53:45,259
A little excited perhaps.
After all, this is a...

961
00:53:49,335 --> 00:53:52,361
Right. So, tell me, are you happy
with your examination?

962
00:53:52,472 --> 00:53:55,100
Yes, very happy.

963
00:53:55,542 --> 00:53:59,238
Right then, lads, follow me.

964
00:54:01,014 --> 00:54:02,504
Back to Roundwood okay?

965
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,640
Roundwood. Got him.

966
00:54:05,752 --> 00:54:07,583
Units 2,3 and 6, Roundwood.

967
00:54:07,686 --> 00:54:12,317
I want a complete roadblock.
All roads in. All roads out.

968
00:54:13,993 --> 00:54:16,358
All units to Roundwood...

969
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:19,389
Copy that, control.
Unit 6 on our way to Roundwood.

970
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,025
Unit 5, how far away are you?

971
00:54:23,102 --> 00:54:25,696
Isn't the scenery around here
only fantastic Peter?

972
00:54:25,939 --> 00:54:29,375
Of course, you've no mountains
in Holland, sure you haven't.

973
00:54:29,943 --> 00:54:32,172
No, very flat Holland.

974
00:54:35,614 --> 00:54:37,674
I love your country very much.

975
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:39,678
Same here, Peter.

976
00:54:39,953 --> 00:54:42,353
Ireland's a great place to live,
do you know that?

977
00:54:42,956 --> 00:54:44,354
Are we near Roundwood yet?

978
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,152
About half a mile.

979
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:48,617
As soon as we get off this road
we're as good as there.

980
00:54:48,695 --> 00:54:50,959
Fantastic.
We might stop for a pint, will we?

981
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,395
Are you thirsty?

982
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:54,398
The cheek of the man.

983
00:54:58,103 --> 00:54:59,162
Are they in position yet?

984
00:54:59,271 --> 00:55:01,739
I want that roadlock rock solid
do you hear me?

985
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,272
Mothing repeat,
nothing is to get through.

986
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:06,736
Unit 6, call in, where are you?

987
00:55:07,313 --> 00:55:10,373
I know the very best pub
for you, Peter.

988
00:55:10,482 --> 00:55:14,010
Lovely log fire.
Irish music sessions

989
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:15,520
and they serve a great pint.

990
00:55:16,457 --> 00:55:18,254
Are you sure he said Roundwood?

991
00:55:18,325 --> 00:55:20,657
Sir, the surveillance plane can't
spot the subjects

992
00:55:20,928 --> 00:55:21,622
anywhere near Roundwood.

993
00:55:21,695 --> 00:55:22,719
What?

994
00:55:22,997 --> 00:55:23,964
He says they're not in the area.

995
00:55:24,064 --> 00:55:25,053
Well, they have to be.

996
00:55:25,165 --> 00:55:26,530
Are you sure it's Roundwood?
Over.

997
00:55:26,634 --> 00:55:28,363
Maybe they're not
out of the woods yet.

998
00:55:32,138 --> 00:55:35,074
Here we go. That's Roundwood
up ahead there, Peter.

999
00:55:35,175 --> 00:55:38,337
Supposed to be the highest village
in Ireland.

1000
00:55:38,445 --> 00:55:40,379
Wouldn't mind living aroung here,
I can tell you.

1001
00:55:40,447 --> 00:55:42,607
A lovely quiet spot.

1002
00:55:42,716 --> 00:55:45,048
Yes, yes, very tranquil.

1003
00:55:45,452 --> 00:55:47,181
They're just
coming into Roundwood now.

1004
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:51,046
Well, the surveillance plane
still can't spot them.

1005
00:55:51,157 --> 00:55:53,285
Well, what's going on?

1006
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,523
Oh, fuck... God forgive me.

1007
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:59,224
No sign of them. Nothing at all.

1008
00:56:09,778 --> 00:56:12,338
What an awful
waste of taxpayers' money.

1009
00:56:12,446 --> 00:56:14,312
What's he talking about now?

1010
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:17,214
I hope the Government will pay
for your funeral, Peter.

1011
00:56:17,285 --> 00:56:18,546
It's the least they can do.

1012
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:20,417
Please, don't.

1013
00:56:20,955 --> 00:56:23,617
Jesus Christ, Michael,
that was fucking amazing.

1014
00:56:23,692 --> 00:56:26,718
Here, Tony, Stevie,
wasn't that the business?

1015
00:56:26,994 --> 00:56:28,587
I bet the Gardas are sitting there
thinking,

1016
00:56:28,663 --> 00:56:31,131
''What the fuck are we
after letting ourselves in for?''

1017
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:33,634
''There is no way
we can get all these fuckers''

1018
00:56:33,703 --> 00:56:35,694
''they're untouchable.''

1019
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:09,730
You knew all along, didn't you?

1020
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,639
How do you mean?

1021
00:57:11,742 --> 00:57:13,209
Like, explain it to me.

1022
00:57:13,276 --> 00:57:15,676
What the fuck
did we go through all that for

1023
00:57:15,945 --> 00:57:17,914
if you knew Peter was a fake?

1024
00:57:18,014 --> 00:57:20,949
They're gonna feel so stupid.

1025
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:24,543
The Gardas are gonna think
they'll never get the better of us.

1026
00:57:25,321 --> 00:57:27,313
Yeah, maybe.

1027
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:30,086
I just wouldn't try that one
with stevie right now.

1028
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,958
Stevie? Fuck him
if he's got no sense of humor.

1029
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:13,368
On the night, He was betrayed.

1030
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:16,928
He took bread and gave you thanks

1031
00:58:17,006 --> 00:58:21,137
and praise. He broke the bread
gave it to his disciples and said

1032
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:26,205
''Take this all of you nd eat it
this is my body''

1033
00:58:26,316 --> 00:58:28,443
''which will be given up for you.''

1034
00:58:49,707 --> 00:58:52,733
May He make us an everlasting gift
to you

1035
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:56,537
and enable us to share
in the inheritance of your Saints

1036
00:58:56,614 --> 00:59:00,175
with Mary,
The Virgin Mother of God

1037
00:59:00,284 --> 00:59:01,683
with the Apostles...
the Martyrs...

1038
00:59:25,543 --> 00:59:28,011
Right, Michael,
we're up your arse now.

1039
00:59:30,548 --> 00:59:32,413
Michael...

1040
00:59:32,517 --> 00:59:34,075
Take a look at
what's happening outside.

1041
00:59:34,151 --> 00:59:34,674
What?

1042
00:59:34,919 --> 00:59:36,477
Look!

1043
00:59:41,293 --> 00:59:42,624
What the fuck...

1044
01:00:01,413 --> 01:00:02,539
Hi, cunts.

1045
01:00:02,614 --> 01:00:04,605
Shut your fucking mouth,
you little toerag.

1046
01:00:04,716 --> 01:00:06,684
What the fuck are you
gonna do about it?

1047
01:00:06,952 --> 01:00:08,647
I'll fucking shut it for you.

1048
01:00:08,754 --> 01:00:11,621
Alec, come here. I'll fucking
shut it for you, you runt.

1049
01:00:19,364 --> 01:00:21,389
Lads. It's Christine.

1050
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,263
How are you all?

1051
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:26,667
Bastards.

1052
01:00:27,739 --> 01:00:31,574
Come on. Let's see what they're at.
Thisi s something new...

1053
01:00:31,644 --> 01:00:33,635
we just ignore 'em,
no matter what they do.

1054
01:00:33,746 --> 01:00:35,577
Right, lads?

1055
01:00:35,648 --> 01:00:36,512
Alec...
What?

1056
01:00:36,616 --> 01:00:37,548
They don't exist.

1057
01:00:37,617 --> 01:00:38,982
I wouldn't fucking touch them.

1058
01:00:39,085 --> 01:00:41,075
Then again I might have to
give someone a good kicking.

1059
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:45,713
Your escorts. Here boys,
we'll look after you.

1060
01:00:45,992 --> 01:00:47,653
You fucking wanker,
get out of my way.

1061
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:51,424
That baldy fuck's supposed to be
a mastermind criminal?

1062
01:00:51,531 --> 01:00:53,021
You must be joking

1063
01:00:53,132 --> 01:00:54,759
just a thick gobshite
who got lucky I'd say.

1064
01:00:55,034 --> 01:00:56,194
Well, he's fucked now.

1065
01:00:56,302 --> 01:00:58,203
Hey, Lynch,
are you listening to me?

1066
01:00:58,272 --> 01:01:00,206
Can you feel it, can you?

1067
01:01:00,274 --> 01:01:01,400
You might as well give up now.

1068
01:01:01,475 --> 01:01:03,534
Cos we're gonna be glues
to your arse from now on.

1069
01:01:03,612 --> 01:01:06,205
Yeah, like flies on shite.

1070
01:01:54,595 --> 01:01:57,063
Hey, girls, you got a minute?

1071
01:01:57,164 --> 01:01:58,096
What's up with you?

1072
01:01:58,198 --> 01:01:59,358
Oh, nothing.

1073
01:01:59,433 --> 01:02:02,493
Fucking Gardas, you know,
getting on me nerves.

1074
01:02:02,569 --> 01:02:05,197
Listen, I need one of you
to drive me later on.

1075
01:02:05,606 --> 01:02:06,732
So where are the Gardas gonna be?

1076
01:02:07,007 --> 01:02:09,032
Are you gonna fucking hlep me
or not?

1077
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:10,541
Yeah.

1078
01:02:12,513 --> 01:02:13,707
Keep your hair on.

1079
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,719
Why can't you cops
leave people alone?

1080
01:02:27,996 --> 01:02:30,487
How can they keep this up?
This is harassment.

1081
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:31,690
How many of them are there?

1082
01:02:31,967 --> 01:02:34,332
How are we supposed to work
with the cops all over us?

1083
01:02:34,402 --> 01:02:36,029
I don't recognize any of them.

1084
01:02:36,137 --> 01:02:38,662
Would somebody call the Gardas,
sort out this mess?

1085
01:02:38,773 --> 01:02:40,365
They're never around
when you need them.

1086
01:02:40,475 --> 01:02:43,137
It's just no fun any more,
is it, Lisa?

1087
01:02:43,545 --> 01:02:46,013
time's up and I think you know it.

1088
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:48,315
I've had a contact about
the painting, Michael.

1089
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:49,280
Yeah?

1090
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:51,443
An offer. From the IRA
a hundred grand.

1091
01:02:51,553 --> 01:02:53,988
Not great, I know,

1092
01:02:54,089 --> 01:02:55,454
but it's better than
letting the thing just rot away.

1093
01:02:55,523 --> 01:02:57,457
Their man Higgins said,
if you did the deal

1094
01:02:57,525 --> 01:02:58,993
it would be okay about Billy.

1095
01:02:59,094 --> 01:02:59,753
Sorry?

1096
01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:02,190
Like, if he comes to Dublin,
there'd be no hassle.

1097
01:03:02,297 --> 01:03:04,197
You talked to Higgins about Billy?

1098
01:03:04,266 --> 01:03:05,391
Look, let's do the deal

1099
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,366
so thowe fuckers go after the IRA
and let us alone.

1100
01:03:07,469 --> 01:03:10,200
Fucking sure anyway, it's not
our kind of stuff, you know

1101
01:03:10,306 --> 01:03:11,170
this art shite.

1102
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,434
Let the IRA deal with it, man.

1103
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:15,204
Look at all these Gardas...
look what we've done to them,

1104
01:03:15,311 --> 01:03:17,074
we've dragged them
down to our level.

1105
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:18,612
They're acting like criminals now.

1106
01:03:18,714 --> 01:03:20,682
I'm their worst fucking nightmare.

1107
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,645
And now you're telling me
you want to get rid of the painting

1108
01:03:22,752 --> 01:03:25,152
the thing we'll be remembered for.

1109
01:03:26,255 --> 01:03:27,347
You think
he'll give you a hundred grand?

1110
01:03:27,456 --> 01:03:28,184
Yeah.

1111
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:29,757
Like fuck he will.

1112
01:03:30,326 --> 01:03:32,124
Can't you see
what Higgins is up to?

1113
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:34,219
It's not about the money,
it's not about the painting.

1114
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:35,695
It's about splitting us.

1115
01:03:35,965 --> 01:03:38,729
Michael, we're robbers.
We rob for a living.

1116
01:03:39,001 --> 01:03:40,491
I'm not making a living any more.

1117
01:03:40,603 --> 01:03:44,664
Yeah, I know, you need things.
You want money, I know.

1118
01:03:44,774 --> 01:03:46,571
Michael, they're coming.

1119
01:03:46,675 --> 01:03:49,236
Will you have a think about it
what we've been saying?

1120
01:03:49,312 --> 01:03:50,710
Will you, Michael?

1121
01:03:52,081 --> 01:03:54,447
Tell Higgins I'll let him know.

1122
01:03:54,517 --> 01:03:56,075
And I'll let him know too.

1123
01:03:56,185 --> 01:03:58,119
And I hope we're talking about
the same thing.

1124
01:03:59,688 --> 01:04:01,452
See you later, Michael.

1125
01:04:02,993 --> 01:04:04,426
D'you fancy a pint, copper?

1126
01:04:11,368 --> 01:04:15,099
Look at the time,
I'll be late picking up me kids.

1127
01:04:23,847 --> 01:04:26,338
Michael Lynch.
And how are you today?

1128
01:04:28,352 --> 01:04:29,649
What's this?

1129
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:34,613
Your benefits have been rescinded.

1130
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:36,451
Try that one again.

1131
01:04:36,827 --> 01:04:38,658
It's the Government.

1132
01:04:38,762 --> 01:04:39,888
I just got the order.

1133
01:04:40,163 --> 01:04:43,724
You see,
they've cut off your payments.

1134
01:04:51,775 --> 01:04:53,800
So I have to...

1135
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:55,468
you know, I, I, I can't...

1136
01:04:55,578 --> 01:04:57,443
You think
you can break me like this?

1137
01:04:57,514 --> 01:05:00,973
You're off your fucking head.

1138
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:04,351
Would you stop for a minute
and listen.

1139
01:05:04,454 --> 01:05:06,615
Can't you see
where it's all heading, Michael?

1140
01:05:06,689 --> 01:05:07,986
Only the one way...

1141
01:05:08,224 --> 01:05:10,192
You've been prison twenty years

1142
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,318
Me, Lisa, the kids...

1143
01:05:11,428 --> 01:05:13,589
No, no, I wouldn't
let it fucking happen...

1144
01:05:13,696 --> 01:05:17,689
Michale Lynch, Norman here, good morning

1145
01:05:18,268 --> 01:05:20,760
Tell you the news about donor

1146
01:05:20,871 --> 01:05:23,396
I'd say
Christine's very pissed off.

1147
01:05:23,508 --> 01:05:25,771
You ugly bag os shite.

1148
01:05:27,745 --> 01:05:31,306
You're losing it, Lynch, so fast.

1149
01:05:31,749 --> 01:05:32,614
As long as you live...

1150
01:05:32,716 --> 01:05:34,445
Stop it...

1151
01:05:34,552 --> 01:05:36,248
we'll be here watching you.

1152
01:05:36,321 --> 01:05:37,480
No escape.

1153
01:05:37,588 --> 01:05:39,453
Fuck off, Michael.

1154
01:05:39,557 --> 01:05:42,788
Christine, did we wake you?

1155
01:05:43,761 --> 01:05:45,422
Do you really think they'll ever
let you get away, Michael...

1156
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:46,258
All right.

1157
01:05:46,363 --> 01:05:47,296
after all you did?

1158
01:05:47,365 --> 01:05:48,297
All right, you're right,

1159
01:05:48,366 --> 01:05:49,492
but they're never gonna
fucking put me away,

1160
01:05:49,568 --> 01:05:51,593
you hear me, no matter
what they fucking do. Never.

1161
01:05:51,704 --> 01:05:52,863
They're out to get you.
What can you do it?

1162
01:05:52,938 --> 01:05:53,836
What can I do about it?

1163
01:05:53,905 --> 01:05:55,931
I'll tell you
what I'll fucking do about it...

1164
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:57,971
Christine...

1165
01:05:58,677 --> 01:06:00,872
Sorry for the disturbance,
Christine.

1166
01:06:08,487 --> 01:06:09,385
Bastards.

1167
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:16,653
I never thought
they'd get this close.

1168
01:06:23,802 --> 01:06:25,235
Hey, Lynch...

1169
01:06:25,337 --> 01:06:26,929
What's so, what?

1170
01:06:27,205 --> 01:06:28,536
Show us your ugly mug.

1171
01:06:28,641 --> 01:06:30,870
If they were me down,
then it was all worth nothing.

1172
01:06:30,942 --> 01:06:32,876
I'll lose everything.

1173
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:37,872
You... Lisa... the kids.

1174
01:06:49,829 --> 01:06:52,195
What about the painting?
If we got some money...

1175
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:53,891
I wasn't in it for the money.

1176
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:56,601
In it for the crack.

1177
01:06:56,702 --> 01:06:58,567
I got a few good laughs
out of it.

1178
01:07:01,741 --> 01:07:04,574
You know what you are?

1179
01:07:05,611 --> 01:07:06,908
That good, yeah?

1180
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:10,713
Wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea,
but it suits me.

1181
01:07:33,709 --> 01:07:35,300
That is disgusting.

1182
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:37,276
Hey, keep the noise down, Lynch.

1183
01:08:18,287 --> 01:08:20,312
How are you, Michael?

1184
01:08:20,756 --> 01:08:22,781
You got me offer?

1185
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,790
So what do you think?

1186
01:08:25,793 --> 01:08:28,557
Last time we spoke
I told you to go fuck yourself.

1187
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:32,328
Things have changed a bit
since then, haven't they?

1188
01:08:32,433 --> 01:08:33,491
That's right, Michael.

1189
01:08:33,601 --> 01:08:35,866
I mean, all these lads, following
it's not good, you know?

1190
01:08:36,138 --> 01:08:37,696
one has to face facts.

1191
01:08:37,805 --> 01:08:39,739
You cut your cloth, Michael.

1192
01:08:40,142 --> 01:08:41,836
So I suppose
it'll come as a bit of a shock

1193
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,140
when I tell you
to go fuck yourself again.

1194
01:08:44,213 --> 01:08:46,238
I'd tear up that painting
and wipe me hole with it

1195
01:08:46,347 --> 01:08:47,814
before I let you near it.

1196
01:08:49,585 --> 01:08:50,950
It's too late for you, Michael.

1197
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:54,211
There's no Lord Mayors begging to
do you favours any more.

1198
01:08:54,289 --> 01:08:56,484
That's long gone.

1199
01:08:56,592 --> 01:08:57,489
I've a picture in me head of you

1200
01:08:57,593 --> 01:08:59,856
sitting with your grandchild
on your knee.

1201
01:08:59,962 --> 01:09:02,589
A bit of drool
coming slowly down your chin.

1202
01:09:02,664 --> 01:09:04,791
Talking shite.

1203
01:09:04,867 --> 01:09:06,459
Michael who?

1204
01:09:28,258 --> 01:09:30,589
We have a show. Tony.

1205
01:09:39,169 --> 01:09:39,725
Michael.

1206
01:09:39,836 --> 01:09:41,166
Tony.

1207
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:44,236
I've been fucking you around,
haven't I?

1208
01:09:45,643 --> 01:09:47,474
Yeah, you have, Michael.

1209
01:09:48,578 --> 01:09:49,739
I'm sorry.

1210
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,444
Well, it's to be expected
with all this shite going on.

1211
01:09:53,551 --> 01:09:55,177
Yeah, but whatever Stevie's up to,

1212
01:09:55,251 --> 01:09:56,878
he's gonna make things worse.
You know that, don't you?

1213
01:09:57,153 --> 01:09:59,213
No, I don't
He's only trying to sort things.

1214
01:09:59,322 --> 01:10:00,654
Get us back to where we were.

1215
01:10:00,758 --> 01:10:02,487
Oh, you think that's what
Higgins wants? You believe that?

1216
01:10:02,592 --> 01:10:04,561
What choice do we have?
You're not helping.

1217
01:10:08,299 --> 01:10:10,564
Do you think
any of these fellas can lip-read?

1218
01:10:11,203 --> 01:10:13,830
You'd be amazed the skills
the Gardas have these days.

1219
01:10:18,242 --> 01:10:20,677
You're fantastic lads.

1220
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:24,770
Do you know that?

1221
01:10:24,882 --> 01:10:26,543
He's got a crack.

1222
01:10:26,952 --> 01:10:29,250
For Christ sake, Michael.

1223
01:10:29,321 --> 01:10:32,984
Tell me then. What's next?

1224
01:10:33,824 --> 01:10:36,794
Stevie's gonna try to get
the painting to Higgins, isn't he?

1225
01:10:36,862 --> 01:10:38,329
With or without me.

1226
01:10:40,364 --> 01:10:43,334
Come on, we all know that, Tony.

1227
01:10:43,435 --> 01:10:45,493
So how's he gonna
get away from the Gardas?

1228
01:10:48,005 --> 01:10:50,200
It's a good plan.
I think it'll work.

1229
01:10:50,307 --> 01:10:53,471
Fair enough.
Tell it to me then.

1230
01:10:54,945 --> 01:10:57,311
Come on, trust me with it,
will you?

1231
01:10:59,016 --> 01:11:00,814
You know Copeland Grove?

1232
01:11:00,918 --> 01:11:01,782
Yeah.

1233
01:11:01,852 --> 01:11:03,617
It's a cul-de-sac, right.
With the steps at the end.

1234
01:11:03,723 --> 01:11:04,985
Yeah, leading up to Summerhill.

1235
01:11:05,223 --> 01:11:06,952
You're gonna drive up there.

1236
01:11:07,527 --> 01:11:09,427
How? All together?
One car's no good.

1237
01:11:09,529 --> 01:11:10,961
No.

1238
01:11:11,029 --> 01:11:13,327
No... a car each,
so you could block the road.

1239
01:11:13,398 --> 01:11:15,332
Not bad, if you can pull it off.

1240
01:11:15,435 --> 01:11:16,867
Don't see why we can't.

1241
01:11:16,968 --> 01:11:18,300
A car will be waiting for you?

1242
01:11:18,403 --> 01:11:19,462
Van.

1243
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:20,868
Of course, for the painting.
No, that's not bad.

1244
01:11:20,972 --> 01:11:23,908
Alec can move that out
lively enough.

1245
01:11:24,509 --> 01:11:26,807
Yeah. Once we get shot of
the Gardass... all we have...

1246
01:11:26,913 --> 01:11:28,174
Hold on a minute.

1247
01:11:28,748 --> 01:11:30,181
That's where it'll happen.

1248
01:11:30,248 --> 01:11:31,681
What?

1249
01:11:32,385 --> 01:11:33,875
Oh, you'll get rid of the Gardas
all right.

1250
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:35,982
Easily.

1251
01:11:37,789 --> 01:11:39,655
Cos I think they'll be tipped off.

1252
01:11:40,525 --> 01:11:41,822
Which is better for Higgins?

1253
01:11:41,928 --> 01:11:43,418
To buy some painting
he can't get rid of

1254
01:11:43,496 --> 01:11:45,487
or to get all of Michael Lynch's
gang arrested in one go?

1255
01:11:45,565 --> 01:11:48,693
Leaving just me for him to
come after in his own good time.

1256
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:50,393
Think about it...

1257
01:11:51,571 --> 01:11:52,969
Higgins or Stevie...

1258
01:11:53,605 --> 01:11:55,630
who would the smart money be on?

1259
01:12:01,581 --> 01:12:04,709
Look, all I'm saying...
whatever happens...

1260
01:12:04,784 --> 01:12:08,378
I promise... I'll be waiting.

1261
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:28,539
Come and get me.

1262
01:12:37,315 --> 01:12:39,648
oh, you'll get rid of
the Gardas all right.

1263
01:12:40,186 --> 01:12:41,584
Easily.

1264
01:12:41,653 --> 01:12:43,622
Cos Higgins will
have tipped them off.

1265
01:12:43,689 --> 01:12:45,281
The way me and Higgins see it is,

1266
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:47,859
if we're reasonable,
we can divide the work.

1267
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,486
Co-operate, let each other know
what we're doing,

1268
01:12:50,596 --> 01:12:52,496
that kind of thing, so as we
don't get in each other's way.

1269
01:12:52,598 --> 01:12:53,293
Yeah.

1270
01:12:53,367 --> 01:12:54,732
While the cops are looking for us,

1271
01:12:54,835 --> 01:12:56,893
Higgins is robbing the bank
on Dame Street.

1272
01:12:57,004 --> 01:12:58,494
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
Stevie,

1273
01:12:58,571 --> 01:13:00,199
I thought we were doing one thing...

1274
01:13:00,306 --> 01:13:01,796
unloading the painting

1275
01:13:01,909 --> 01:13:03,206
to try and get everything
back to normal Persuade...

1276
01:13:03,277 --> 01:13:06,371
Yeah, normal that means no Michael.

1277
01:13:06,446 --> 01:13:08,242
Cos he's not normal any more,
is he?

1278
01:13:08,348 --> 01:13:10,372
Alec, pull up here.

1279
01:13:10,751 --> 01:13:14,277
If anything goes against us...
It'll be nothing to do with me.

1280
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:18,387
Yeah?

1281
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:20,550
It's Tony, you were right, Michael.

1282
01:13:20,661 --> 01:13:21,888
Stevie's gone over to Higgins.

1283
01:13:21,961 --> 01:13:23,862
Okay... Are you free?
Anyone on to you?

1284
01:13:23,963 --> 01:13:26,194
Nah, not a Garda in sight.

1285
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,459
Jesus, yes. Right.

1286
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:29,728
Liten, have you found out anything?

1287
01:13:29,836 --> 01:13:30,962
Where's Higgins picking up
the painting?

1288
01:13:31,204 --> 01:13:32,898
It's Stevie
who's doing the pick-up.

1289
01:13:33,172 --> 01:13:35,505
Apparently while he's
collecting the painting...

1290
01:13:35,576 --> 01:13:37,874
Higgins is planning to rob a bank.

1291
01:13:37,977 --> 01:13:40,607
I think it's some plan
to confuse the Gardas.

1292
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:42,549
Do you know where?

1293
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:45,175
The Metro Bank in Dame Street,
Stevie said.

1294
01:13:45,252 --> 01:13:46,880
Jut before mid-day.

1295
01:13:47,755 --> 01:13:48,949
All right, here's what you do...

1296
01:13:49,223 --> 01:13:50,713
you get there now, fast,
to check it out.

1297
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:51,816
And make sure
you're not being followed.

1298
01:13:51,925 --> 01:13:52,551
Yeah.

1299
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:53,684
Ring me in fifteen minutes.

1300
01:13:53,795 --> 01:13:54,726
Okay.

1301
01:13:54,828 --> 01:13:56,728
Oh, and Tony...
Yeah?

1302
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:58,458
What are you wearing by the way?

1303
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:03,570
Well?

1304
01:14:04,405 --> 01:14:04,996
What?

1305
01:14:05,239 --> 01:14:06,730
Have you two kissed and made up?

1306
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:09,503
Me and Tony? Oh, yeah, sure.

1307
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:10,442
Good.

1308
01:14:10,545 --> 01:14:12,605
Can't be falling out with friends
like him.

1309
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:21,749
Listen girls...

1310
01:14:22,557 --> 01:14:24,788
I think I'm gonna be able to
fix things, you know

1311
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:27,453
so you wont' be
walking the streets begging.

1312
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:30,224
Tony and me have come up
with something...

1313
01:14:30,298 --> 01:14:33,531
something very tasty.
Like this...

1314
01:14:35,338 --> 01:14:36,805
Listen, I gotta go, okay?

1315
01:14:36,873 --> 01:14:38,534
Don't worry. It's grand, Michael.

1316
01:14:39,376 --> 01:14:41,674
Go on so.
Get out from under our feet.

1317
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:45,646
Wish me luck, girls, there's
a lot of bad people out there.

1318
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:48,815
Hi, da.

1319
01:14:48,918 --> 01:14:50,180
Nothing yet, Michael.

1320
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:51,242
Maybe Stevie was bullshitting.

1321
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,881
I don't thinkso.
I think we're in business, Tony.

1322
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:55,288
All right, now are you listening?
Yeah.

1323
01:14:55,392 --> 01:14:57,325
Here's how it's gonna happen.

1324
01:14:57,426 --> 01:15:01,488
You hang around inside the bank.
I'll be outside.

1325
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,707
There'll be the usual Gardas
in attendance.

1326
01:15:12,776 --> 01:15:14,538
But not so many.

1327
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:17,340
Remember...
Higgins will betray Stevie...

1328
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:19,745
At last we can make
some fucking money on this thing.

1329
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,475
So most of the armed units

1330
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:23,610
will be chasing him and Alec
to get the painting.

1331
01:15:31,795 --> 01:15:35,287
Now once Higgins' boys arrive...
we're off and running.

1332
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,713
I'm disappointed in you, Shay.

1333
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:00,221
Mother of Christ.

1334
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,659
That's Shay Kirby.

1335
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:07,489
Let's check it out.

1336
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,624
Good morning.
I'd like to apply for a loan.

1337
01:16:15,638 --> 01:16:16,605
Thank you.

1338
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:18,366
How's it going, Shay?

1339
01:16:18,476 --> 01:16:19,465
Put it down. Drop it.

1340
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:20,771
Put it down, now. Drop it.

1341
01:16:20,845 --> 01:16:22,244
Take it easy, Shay.

1342
01:16:22,346 --> 01:16:24,541
Put it down!
Now!

1343
01:16:24,648 --> 01:16:28,744
Put it down!
Do it. Nice and easy.

1344
01:16:28,853 --> 01:16:31,219
Stand up! Turn around!

1345
01:16:31,321 --> 01:16:32,414
Against the wall.

1346
01:16:32,523 --> 01:16:33,716
Fuck!

1347
01:16:35,592 --> 01:16:38,289
Alec, watch the fucking painting.
Jesus Christ.

1348
01:16:40,664 --> 01:16:44,395
Don't move a fucking muscle.

1349
01:16:44,468 --> 01:16:46,732
Fuck me. What the fuck
are we gonna do, man?

1350
01:16:46,837 --> 01:16:49,168
Right,
keep the fucking painting up...

1351
01:16:49,273 --> 01:16:50,830
Right, right,
we keep behind the painting.

1352
01:16:50,941 --> 01:16:51,566
Why?

1353
01:16:51,675 --> 01:16:52,699
Keep behind the fucking painting!

1354
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:53,868
Right, right.
Come on, back we go then.

1355
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:54,842
Right.

1356
01:16:54,945 --> 01:16:56,242
Shite!

1357
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:00,776
Go...
Fucking back up.

1358
01:17:04,755 --> 01:17:05,914
Drop the guns!

1359
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:09,852
Drop the guns!

1360
01:17:11,763 --> 01:17:12,729
What the fuck are we gonna do?

1361
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,298
Drop the fucking picture!

1362
01:17:37,889 --> 01:17:41,756
Everybody...
On your knees now.

1363
01:17:46,397 --> 01:17:47,922
Get down.

1364
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,633
You're a fucking arsehole.
What the fuck are we gonna do?

1365
01:17:51,736 --> 01:17:53,465
Michael would never have gotten us
into this fucking mess.

1366
01:17:53,538 --> 01:17:56,302
Cara-fucking-vaggio.

1367
01:18:06,585 --> 01:18:08,178
Fuck art!

1368
01:18:12,925 --> 01:18:13,949
All right, Liam, he's safe.

1369
01:18:14,226 --> 01:18:15,216
We need back-up.

1370
01:18:15,561 --> 01:18:16,823
This is foxtrot one calling...

1371
01:18:16,896 --> 01:18:18,921
we request immediate
armed assistance.

1372
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:20,392
We've got a situation here.

1373
01:18:20,466 --> 01:18:22,229
All armed units are
chasing that painting!

1374
01:18:22,334 --> 01:18:23,699
Fucking bollocks!

1375
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:26,431
What the fuck are you looking at?

1376
01:18:26,539 --> 01:18:27,870
All right let's move.

1377
01:18:28,507 --> 01:18:29,668
Right, stay there.

1378
01:18:31,778 --> 01:18:33,439
You'll have to sign for that boys.

1379
01:18:41,888 --> 01:18:44,153
Drop the gun.

1380
01:18:47,294 --> 01:18:48,522
Don't... don't fucking shoot me!

1381
01:18:48,595 --> 01:18:52,429
Drop the gun.
Nice and easy.

1382
01:18:52,499 --> 01:18:55,627
Michael Lynch is involved. This is
a highly dangerous situation.

1383
01:18:55,736 --> 01:18:58,636
We're doing our best, but we've
no armed units right now.

1384
01:18:58,705 --> 01:19:01,572
For fuck's sake,
we need armed units, now!

1385
01:19:08,582 --> 01:19:10,277
Holy shit.

1386
01:19:10,384 --> 01:19:12,852
Hope they dont' take that
out of your wages, boss.

1387
01:19:13,854 --> 01:19:15,822
Sorry, Noel,
we've got urgent calls.

1388
01:19:15,922 --> 01:19:18,858
There's an armed robbery going on
in the Metro Bank in Dame Street.

1389
01:19:18,925 --> 01:19:21,724
They're still inside,
and apparently one of the's Lynch.

1390
01:19:26,133 --> 01:19:27,157
Fuck!

1391
01:19:28,568 --> 01:19:29,762
How the fuck did he...

1392
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:31,804
I've no idea.

1393
01:19:33,874 --> 01:19:35,466
Tell them to keep him there.

1394
01:19:35,575 --> 01:19:36,735
Whatever they do, keep him there.

1395
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:37,742
Right, Noel.

1396
01:19:37,811 --> 01:19:39,369
Come on, lads, out of here.
Come on, move.

1397
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:43,347
Luke, get on to Control.
I want cars down there now.

1398
01:19:43,417 --> 01:19:44,884
And get those guys out of the bank.

1399
01:19:46,553 --> 01:19:48,681
Michael Lynch talking.
Do you hear me?

1400
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:52,350
I'm coming out.
I'm giving myself up. Okay?

1401
01:19:53,661 --> 01:19:54,787
What do you want me to do?

1402
01:19:54,896 --> 01:19:56,557
Die, you motherfucker.

1403
01:19:56,631 --> 01:20:00,259
Put your hands clearly in the air
and come out slowly.

1404
01:20:00,368 --> 01:20:03,428
Okay. Here I come, lads.

1405
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:08,475
Keep walking towards us
until we tell you to stop.

1406
01:20:08,543 --> 01:20:11,307
You fellas are gonna be famous
do you know that?

1407
01:20:11,813 --> 01:20:13,303
Shoot the fucker.

1408
01:20:13,381 --> 01:20:14,643
Put your gun down.

1409
01:20:18,886 --> 01:20:20,352
Walk away from it.

1410
01:20:20,421 --> 01:20:22,981
You're dead, Lynch,
so's your fucking family.

1411
01:20:23,256 --> 01:20:24,417
Shut up.

1412
01:20:28,596 --> 01:20:31,258
All right, everyone stand up.
Up, up, now.

1413
01:20:31,366 --> 01:20:33,459
Go, move...

1414
01:20:33,568 --> 01:20:34,626
What the...?

1415
01:20:34,736 --> 01:20:36,431
How are you doing?

1416
01:20:40,608 --> 01:20:42,474
Shoot the fucker!

1417
01:20:44,613 --> 01:20:45,602
Get down...

1418
01:20:45,714 --> 01:20:47,272
Lynch is still in there.

1419
01:20:52,286 --> 01:20:54,585
Keep Lynch there
whatever happens.

1420
01:20:54,656 --> 01:20:56,419
Repeat, keep Lynch there.

1421
01:20:56,492 --> 01:20:57,823
What the fuck now?

1422
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:03,230
Lynch, come out.

1423
01:21:05,768 --> 01:21:07,325
Lynch!

1424
01:21:17,813 --> 01:21:19,405
Rifle.

1425
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:29,384
What's going on?

1426
01:21:29,725 --> 01:21:30,953
Haven't a clue.

1427
01:21:31,226 --> 01:21:33,217
But Lynch is still in there.

1428
01:21:33,295 --> 01:21:34,388
Good.

1429
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:41,635
Are you out there, Noel?

1430
01:21:41,738 --> 01:21:44,673
I know I've been messing
with your lads

1431
01:21:44,774 --> 01:21:47,743
and they're probably a bit annoyed.

1432
01:21:47,844 --> 01:21:49,539
But this is it.

1433
01:21:49,646 --> 01:21:52,342
You have me for real this time.

1434
01:21:52,882 --> 01:21:54,213
I'm coming out.

1435
01:21:58,888 --> 01:22:00,753
Put the gun down.

1436
01:22:03,526 --> 01:22:05,494
Put the fucking weapon down.

1437
01:22:40,698 --> 01:22:43,792
Noel... that's it?

1438
01:22:44,468 --> 01:22:46,629
Tell his wife to come
and identify the body.

1439
01:22:46,737 --> 01:22:47,864
Okay.

1440
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:07,519
Where's Michael?

1441
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,284
Tony?

1442
01:23:40,259 --> 01:23:43,194
Are you Michael Lynch's wife
Christine?

1443
01:23:47,767 --> 01:23:52,966
And you are his sister-in-law
Lisa?

1444
01:23:55,341 --> 01:23:56,569
Right.

1445
01:23:59,712 --> 01:24:01,703
Would you formally
identify this body

1446
01:24:01,815 --> 01:24:04,283
as that of your husband
Michael Lynch?

1447
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:08,481
A nod'll do.

1448
01:24:13,293 --> 01:24:14,885
Oh God.

1449
01:24:22,936 --> 01:24:25,928
Sure they'd never recognise him
with his head in that state.

1450
01:24:27,874 --> 01:24:28,842
I think they will.

1451
01:24:28,942 --> 01:24:30,432
What?

1452
01:24:36,475 --> 01:24:38,272
Oh yes, of course, right enough.

1453
01:24:43,682 --> 01:24:45,946
So, is that him then, girls?

1454
01:24:52,558 --> 01:24:57,154
Yes...
this is the body of my husband.

1455
01:25:10,043 --> 01:25:11,601
Right...

1456
01:25:11,678 --> 01:25:14,546
it's over... well done.

1457
01:25:25,192 --> 01:25:26,681
Take it

1458
01:25:37,537 --> 01:25:39,130
Give me the fucking mask

1459
01:25:52,518 --> 01:25:54,146
Good morning, Jero

1460
01:25:56,522 --> 01:25:58,012
Before we go our separate ways,

1461
01:25:58,125 --> 01:26:00,684
let us take leave of
our brother Michael.

1462
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:04,025
May our farewell express
our affection for him.

1463
01:26:04,097 --> 01:26:07,795
May it ease our sadness
and strengthen our hope.

1464
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:13,139
Lynch would love this send off.

1465
01:26:14,807 --> 01:26:16,776
He's probably up there somewhere

1466
01:26:16,843 --> 01:26:19,676
having a good laugh at the idea
of us protecting him now.

1467
01:26:39,465 --> 01:26:41,763
It was the right thing to do, Noel.

1468
01:26:41,868 --> 01:26:44,860
Fuck it, he's dead.

1469
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:51,104
Something between me and him, Ger.

1470
01:26:51,712 --> 01:26:54,112
It's the way
these things usually end up.

1471
01:26:59,019 --> 01:27:00,816
Now, that's what your mummy
sent you for.

1472
01:27:00,888 --> 01:27:02,117
Yeah, she'll pay you tomorrow.

1473
01:27:02,222 --> 01:27:04,191
Grand. Mind yourself
crossing that road now.

1474
01:27:04,291 --> 01:27:04,985
Okay.

1475
01:27:05,059 --> 01:27:05,821
Bye.

1476
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:07,053
Bye.

1477
01:27:07,795 --> 01:27:08,819
Hiya.

1478
01:27:08,929 --> 01:27:13,263
Hello there.
Lovely day for it huh?

1479
01:27:13,534 --> 01:27:15,502
It certainly is.

1480
01:27:17,037 --> 01:27:18,130
And how are you today?

1481
01:27:19,074 --> 01:27:21,907
Well, now...

1482
01:27:21,976 --> 01:27:24,103
Let's see now.

1483
01:27:24,647 --> 01:27:26,614
Is that tins of corned beef
you have there?

1484
01:27:26,715 --> 01:27:30,811
Yep, ''John West''.
Do you want one?

1485
01:27:31,186 --> 01:27:33,882
I'll tell you what,
can you hang on to it for me?

1486
01:27:33,988 --> 01:27:35,513
I'll collect it
later on me way back.

1487
01:27:35,623 --> 01:27:37,989
Save me lugging it
around on the bike.

1488
01:27:38,059 --> 01:27:41,756
Well, of course.
That's a grand bike you have.

1489
01:27:41,864 --> 01:27:44,093
I wish I had your speed.

1490
01:27:46,001 --> 01:27:48,196
Well, gets me around, you know.

1491
01:27:53,043 --> 01:27:54,475
Good luck.

1492
01:27:54,945 --> 01:27:56,104
Bye.

1493
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:56,697
Michael, you just can't live
without us, can you?

1494
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,548
Bless us, oh, Lord.

1495
01:29:25,552 --> 01:29:28,380
And these thy gifts,
which of thy bounty,

1496
01:29:28,381 --> 01:29:33,037
we are about to receive
through Christ our Lord, amen.
