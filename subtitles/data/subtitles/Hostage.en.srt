00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,940
I need to talk to that motherfucker!
You hear me?

2
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,340
I want to talk to that fucker right now!

3
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,660
I want that motherfucker!

4
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,780
<i>You find that bastard now,
or I am gonna...</i>

5
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,420
<i>I'm gonna shoot my whore wife,
and I'm gonna shoot the boy!</i>

6
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,820
Joe, just relax,

7
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,060
Relax, We're looking
for your wife's boyfriend,

8
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,100
<i>- and I'm gonna find him, all right?
- You want to help me?</i>

9
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,900
<i>Which one do I shoot first? Do I shoot
the whore, or do I shoot the whore's boy?</i>

10
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,540
<i>Huh? You help me choose!</i>

11
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,380
No, no, Joe,
nobody wants to hear gunshots in there,

12
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,100
You scare us all out here,

13
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,140
Now look,
I've been trying to help you all day,

14
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,900
All right, You want me to help you,
you gotta help me,

15
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,700
<i>You don't know what it's like, man.</i>

16
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,220
<i>You do not know what it's like.</i>

17
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,140
<i>You do not know what I've been through.
You don't know what I'm going through.</i>

18
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,140
<i>You don't think I got the balls, do you?</i>

19
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,660
I know you got the balls, Joe,

20
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:24,260
<i>- No, you don't think I'm gonna do it.
- Joe, you got the gun,</i>

21
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,500
You can do whatever you want,

22
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,980
<i>I feel so tired, man.
When in Christ am I gonna sleep?</i>

23
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,300
I know you're tired, Joe,
You've been up all night,

24
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,780
Come on, Let me come down there,

25
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,820
<i>- What do you say?
- No! No, no!</i>

26
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,100
<i>Fuck you!</i>

27
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,060
You all right?

28
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,860
I hate this fucking guy,

29
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,020
Jeff, I'm leaning toward an entry,

30
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,620
We know the boy's in his room, If we move
now, we got a 100% chance of saving him,

31
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,780
- We're giving up on the mom?
- She's 20% at best,

32
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,860
Jeff, we gotta move on the boy,
It's the only choice,

33
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,540
- This one's getting away from him,
- Shrink-wrap, don't talk like I'm not here,

34
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,260
- We've been here for 16 hours,
- Fucking new guy,

35
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,740
Everybody calm down,
We're all tired,

36
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,580
I'd just steer Joe away from the subject
of choice, Choosing represents...

37
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,420
Tell me something I don't fucking know,

38
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,380
Wait, wait,

39
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,020
- I hear crying,
- The boy's awake,

40
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,740
We've gotta keep the boy in his bedroom,

41
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,220
<i>Shut up, Sean, Shut up!</i>

42
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,820
Hey, Joe, It's me, Jeff, I'm back on,

43
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,980
Listen, let Sean's mom
take care of him, all right?

44
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,340
<i>He's such a little shit, you know?
He's a little shit.</i>

45
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,300
<i>He's probably hungry,
'cause he wakes up and he just whines...</i>

46
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,660
<i>- Tell you what, Let me do you a favor,
- ... till that bitch feeds him.</i>

47
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,580
Find out what Sean likes to eat,
and I'll send it in,

48
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,220
Him and his mom can eat in the bedroom
while me and you fix this thing,

49
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,940
<i>- What do you say?
- Sean!</i>

50
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,860
<i>The cops want to know
what you want to eat, so get in here.</i>

51
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,540
<i>- The boy's moving from his bedroom,
- Get in here!</i>

52
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,860
Our guys put him at 80%,

53
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,740
60,

54
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,540
30,

55
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,740
<i>Hello?</i>

56
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,980
Sean,

57
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,060
<i>Hey, this is Jeff Talley.</i>

58
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,980
<i>Son, I need you to move back
to your bedroom, OK? Right now.</i>

59
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,660
<i>- Mr, Talley?
- Yes?</i>

60
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,100
Are you gonna save us?

61
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,580
Yeah, Sean, I'm gonna save you,

62
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,860
Now I know why you couldn't choose,

63
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,380
<i>It's because God
decided everything already.</i>

64
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,620
<i>Me and the whore are gonna go to hell.</i>

65
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,700
<i>- No, Joe, Just... Look, relax, Just relax,
- But my boy's gonna go to heaven.</i>

66
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,380
<i>I'm sorry, Jeff.</i>

67
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,460
<i>Joe, listen,</i>

68
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,300
Come on, Joe, Pick it up, Pick it up,

69
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,580
<i>- I hear ringing,
- Pick it up,</i>

70
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,580
<i>- It's just ringing,
- Pick it up, Joe,</i>

71
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,980
Jeff? He's saying something,

72
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,740
<i>- We got movement!
- Fuck!</i>

73
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,260
<i>- Where's your shot?
- We lost the shot,</i>

74
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,460
- Where do you want it?
- Side one, opening two,

75
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,260
<i>- I'll put him there,
- O my God, at the end of this day,</i>

76
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,660
<i>I'm heartily thankful
for all the graces I've received.</i>

77
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,780
<i>I'm so sorry for all the sins
I've committed against you.</i>

78
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,260
<i>Please forgive me, O God.</i>

79
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,860
<i>And graciously protect me
at the end of this night.</i>

80
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,140
<i>Blessed Virgin Mary, my heavenly mother,
please take me under your protection.</i>

81
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,780
<i>Joe! Hey, it's me, Jeff...</i>

82
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,300
<i>And St. Joseph.</i>

83
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,540
I'm outside your house!

84
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,380
<i>Saints of God, please pray for me.</i>

85
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,500
Just come to the window
and talk to me! Come on!

86
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,860
<i>- Amen.
- It's me, Jeff! Just come on!</i>

87
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,740
Joe, only God has the right to decide
who lives and who dies!

88
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
And he hasn't decided!

89
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,380
Joe! It doesn't have to end now!
I know you can hear me!

90
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,220
Joe, just come to the window
and talk to me!

91
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,020
Come on, pray with me,
I'll pray with you, Come on,

92
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,140
Come on, Just shoot me, Shoot me,

93
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,980
Come on, I'm right here, Just come to
the window, Come on, I know this prayer,

94
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,620
St, Joseph, dear God...

95
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,180
<i>Joe!</i>

96
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,140
Fuck,

97
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,500
Sean?

98
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,500
Sean?

99
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,180
Medic!

100
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,900
<i>Everybody stand down,
Get the EMTs,</i>

101
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,980
<i>'Cause it's not fair,
My life sucks since Dad moved up here,</i>

102
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,420
<i>We've all had
to make adjustments,</i>

103
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,500
It's just as hard on your father,

104
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,860
<i>Oh, bullshit, Mom, He loves it here,
He thinks Bristo Camino's nice,</i>

105
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,180
<i>Can we talk about this in the car?</i>

106
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,660
<i>No, Mom,
Why can't you tell him to come back to LA?</i>

107
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,260
<i>His job is here, Amanda,</i>

108
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,260
His home is here,
and when we visit, it's our home too,

109
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,020
<i>It's not my home
and it'll never be my home!</i>

110
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,980
Mom, don't you get it?
I fucking hate it here!

111
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,180
- Don't swear, and keep your voice down,
- What about me?

112
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,140
Bathroom's free,

113
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,500
<i>Why don't you guys
just get divorced?</i>

114
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,500
Freezie, come on,

115
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,660
It's OK, I'm not finished with it yet,

116
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,740
Sorry for all the shouting,

117
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,500
Well... She had to get me to hear her
somehow, didn't she?

118
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,260
This is getting really, really hard,
you know?

119
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,780
I just wish you would talk to me,

120
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,100
How am I not talking to you?
I'm talking to you right now,

121
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,620
It would be nice
to know what you're thinking,

122
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,220
I'm thinking
that I'm a half-hour late for work,

123
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,460
Well, at least explain again
to your daughter why you took this job,

124
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,900
See you next weekend,

125
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,580
Hey,

126
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,980
Look, I don't know
what pisses you off more,

127
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,860
Me or my Tater-Tot casserole,

128
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,020
Amanda,

129
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,460
Amanda,

130
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,380
<i>Aman...</i>

131
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,220
This yours?

132
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,340
Dennis,

133
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,820
Smooth,

134
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,660
- Hey, that's, like, a $ 200 ticket,
- Shut up,

135
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,940
- You got $ 200? Huh?
- Shut up, Kevin,

136
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,100
Green light,

137
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,660
<i>If you have four dollars, you can't
give him seven, So you have to borrow,</i>

138
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,860
<i>Yeah, but... so you're...
If you're studying borrowing,</i>

139
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,020
you have to know
exactly how much you're borrowing,

140
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,820
OK, Bye,

141
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,740
- Can I go hang at the Plaza tonight?
- The Plaza?

142
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,700
- Yeah, just friends, It might be a movie,
- Can we have Mr, Kim's tonight?

143
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,780
- Can you wait?
- Oh, Mr, Kim we have on speed dial,

144
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,580
- I'm hungry,
- I'm talking,

145
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,220
I'm ordering, Hello, yes, I wanted to
put in an order, please, to pick up,

146
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,500
<i>- What about homework?
- Done,</i>

147
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,140
<i>Ha, I almost believe that,</i>

148
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,940
Yeah, We'd like to order...

149
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,020
Well, what would we like to order?

150
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,380
<i>Kev, do the Dew, In super size,</i>

151
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,020
<i>Hey, why do I always gotta go?</i>

152
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,020
If I'm buying, you're flying,
Get out of the truck,

153
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,300
- You should listen to your brother,
- Give me some money then,

154
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,300
It's in the box,

155
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,060
What's that for? Dennis?

156
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,820
Check the car, Check the car, Mars,

157
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,820
Hey, I know her,

158
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,460
I mean... I don't know her,
I've seen her around,

159
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,500
- You know where she lives?
- No,

160
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,940
Oh, you think it's funny?

161
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,820
Rich bitch driving in her daddy's Escalade,

162
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,460
Fuck you,

163
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,900
- Hello, Louise,
- Afternoon, Chief,

164
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,620
Who's in the field?

165
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,460
Ruiz and Kovaks are working
a TC over on Monte Verde,

166
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,420
Two units, one fender bender,
Hope she's 18,

167
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,180
- Afternoon, Chief,
- Bill,

168
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,540
Mikey, Very dynamic wheels,

169
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,020
- Casual Monday?
- Well, Chief, I...

170
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,820
How do you expect
to be taken seriously as a cop

171
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,820
if you're gonna wear
sneakers to work, kid?

172
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,380
- I'm sorry, Chief, It won't happen again,
- That's what you said on Casual Sunday,

173
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,060
- It was the play-offs,
- Yeah,

174
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,860
What do you say we rename today
"Low-crime Monday"?

175
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,060
- Followed by what?
- Low-crime Tuesday,

176
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,060
That's right,

177
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,780
Low-crime Tuesday,

178
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,900
<i>Yes, I would say
Brenda's looking very good,</i>

179
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,060
Fine, Couple of minutes,

180
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,220
Daddy?

181
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,500
Uh, can you give me just a second?
My son just walked in,

182
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,620
What's this attached to my ear?

183
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,620
- A phone,
- Why is it attached to my ear?

184
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,900
- 'Cause you're talking on it?
- Which means you are...

185
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,940
- Interrupting your conversation?
- That's my genius,

186
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,100
OK, Mr, Genius, What I'd like is
all your homework done, on my desk,

187
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,140
before any more television, Sound good?

188
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,300
- God...
- I know,

189
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,260
How about getting
the doors there for me, champ?

190
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,860
- Appreciate it, One, and then...
- The other,

191
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,860
Yeah, Thanks, champ,

192
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,140
<i>OK, I am ready
to loan you Heaven Can Wait.</i>

193
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,940
What time would you like me to drop it?

194
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,940
OK,

195
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,180
Done,

196
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,140
I like it,

197
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,980
Let's just go to the movies,

198
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,340
We're gonna go to the movies,

199
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,940
<i>- But first we're gonna take daddy's car,
- No, man,</i>

200
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,540
Dennis, this is way worse
than any shit you've done before,

201
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,740
Stay in the truck, OK?

202
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,260
Dad, you're such a dinosaur!

203
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,740
All right, All I'm saying
is that there are men out there,

204
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,700
Men, Not the boys I go to school with,

205
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,940
Right, Men, OK?

206
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:53,620
Men see this sort of outfit
as a sexual invitation, That's all I'm saying,

207
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,780
- Looking for something?
- Empty,

208
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,420
Ooh, how'd that happen?

209
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,340
Look, how's this?
If I change what I'm wearing,

210
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,700
- will you give me $40 for tonight?
- If that doesn't remind me of your mother,

211
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,980
How about you change
what you're wearing,

212
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,260
then we talk about the $40 afterwards, OK?

213
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,780
Hey, Hey,

214
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,700
Door,

215
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,380
Say it again, rich bitch, Huh?

216
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,620
Say "Fuck you,"

217
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,580
Tommy?

218
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,660
- Tommy, what...
- Hey, don't move,

219
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,140
- No, No,
- Don't move, man,

220
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,740
- What do you want?
- Who else is in the house?

221
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,020
Nobody,

222
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,620
<i>Daddy!</i>

223
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,860
<i>- Tommy...
- Where's mommy?</i>

224
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,060
Huh? Where's mommy?

225
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,820
<i>My wife's dead,</i>

226
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,460
Mars, the door,

227
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,140
You really should listen to your brother,

228
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,620
- Shit!
- What are you doing?

229
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,540
I told you to stay in the fucking truck,

230
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,340
- Dennis, man, you can't do this,
- I told you, don't use my fucking name,

231
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,340
- Where are the keys?
- Keys?

232
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,220
- Where are the fucking car keys?
- In my office,

233
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,660
Office, Go, Come on, let's go,

234
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,860
All right,
It's gonna be OK,

235
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,700
I like your shirt,

236
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,380
<i>By the way,
Carol's answering a silent alarm,</i>

237
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,420
Says there's a suspicious vehicle out front,

238
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,100
All right, Let's get her some backup,
See who's in the area,

239
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,380
Bristo 23 and 29er, 15 requesting backup,

240
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,700
<i>Ruiz, Kovaks, are you out there?</i>

241
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,740
<i>Bristo 23 and 29er,
15 requesting backup.</i>

242
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,100
<i>Bristo 23 and 29er,
15 requesting backup.</i>

243
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,180
Louise, what's the address on that alarm?
I'm gonna go check it out myself,

244
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,660
- Daddy, just give them the keys,
- I'm gonna give them the keys, honey,

245
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,900
<i>I just need to be certain...</i>

246
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,900
- What is that? What the fuck is that?
- The front gate,

247
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,820
- It's a cop, Dennis, it's a cop,
- Shit!

248
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,260
<i>- It's OK, I know her, Just be cool,
- Shit, shit, shit, shit!</i>

249
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,540
- It's OK, I can just...
- Shut the fuck up!

250
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,980
Calm down, OK? I can talk
to the police officer from here using that,

251
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,580
<i>I can tell her that everything's fine,
Then she'll go, and then you can go,</i>

252
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,100
<i>Hello?</i>

253
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,420
<i>Afternoon. This is Officer Flores
with the Bristo Camino Police Department.</i>

254
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,300
We're answering a silent alarm,
Is everything OK in there?

255
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,460
<i>I'm sorry. We must have
accidentally tripped the alarm.</i>

256
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,100
I understand, sir,
These things happen all the time,

257
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,540
But there's an abandoned
pickup truck on your street,

258
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,860
Have you seen who it might belong to?

259
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,500
<i>Oh, no, it's not abandoned. There's
a guy here fixing the air conditioning.</i>

260
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,340
<i>I'm sure everything's OK,</i>

261
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,220
<i>Could you come outside, please?</i>

262
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,020
<i>- Say something,
- Officer, my son's got a fever,</i>

263
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,940
<i>I've got the pediatrician on hold. Do you
really need me to come down there?</i>

264
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,420
<i>- 15, please respond.
- Bristo base, this is 15, Come back,</i>

265
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,780
<i>Carol, be advised
there's a felony want on that red pickup.</i>

266
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,180
<i>The vehicle's suspected of being involved
in a carjacking last week in Valencia...</i>

267
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,060
Mars! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fucking shit!

268
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,260
<i>Shit!</i>

269
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,420
Code three!
I'm taking fire, I'm taking fire!

270
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,740
Get on the fucking couch!
I gotta fucking think, man,

271
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,340
- Fuck! Shit,
- Dennis, in my desk I have contacts

272
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,620
for lawyers and judges,

273
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,100
- I can help you get out of this, Dennis,
- Fuck! Don't say my fucking name!

274
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,740
<i>- No! No!
- Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!</i>

275
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,060
Stop it!

276
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,860
Daddy, no! Daddy, wake up!

277
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,940
Fuck you,

278
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,620
<i>Flores is down. Flores is down!</i>

279
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,980
Heads down, heads down,
I'm coming up to...

280
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,180
- Hector, you all right?
- Jesus!

281
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

282
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,740
They ran your truck, dawg,
They know we've been jacking cars,

283
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,020
<i>- Shit,
- Attention, you in the house.</i>

284
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,780
<i>This is Chief Talley
of the Bristo Camino Police Department.</i>

285
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,500
I'm gonna bring my car closer
so I can evacuate the injured officer,

286
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,660
I am not coming in the house,
I repeat: I am not coming in the house,

287
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,380
Do not shoot me,

288
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,460
<i>Do not shoot at me.</i>

289
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,220
Carol, come on, Give me your hand,

290
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,700
Hang on, Come on,

291
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,660
Come on,

292
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,460
Just hang on, Hang on,

293
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,620
<i>Hey,</i>

294
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:23,180
Pull yourself together,
Put this in the back of one of the cars,

295
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,180
Go on,

296
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,940

299
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,340
Truck's registered

300
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,940
We're still trying to track her down,

301
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,700
But a neighbor told us she lives with
her two teenage boys, Dennis and Kevin,

302
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,980
And the neighbor also told us
that Dennis has some juvenile history,

303
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,860
<i>You're gonna go to jail,</i>

304
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,660
<i>- You're all gonna go to jail,
- Enough!</i>

305
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,100
- Why won't you just leave us alone?
- Tie 'em up,

306
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,660
- Tie 'em up with what?
- I don't know, Just figure something out,

307
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,300
Tie 'em up, Go upstairs, Let's go,

308
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,300
I'm not leaving my father,

309
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:11,180
I'm gonna take care of him, I'm gonna get
some ice for his head, maybe a pillow,

310
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,980
- It's OK,
- Come on, let's go,

311
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,100
<i>Let's go,</i>

312
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,020
Yeah?

313
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:34,660
<i>Since you're answering the phone,
I'm going to assume this is Dennis.</i>

314
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,540
I'll take that as a yes,

315
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,100
This is Jeff Talley, Dennis,
I'm with the local police,

316
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,980
You the man in charge in there?

317
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,700
Yeah, I'm in charge,

318
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,060
<i>All right.</i>

319
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,420
Then you can tell me who shot my cop,

320
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,100
- Was it you, or Kevin?
- No... no, don't put that on us,

321
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,380
I want to talk to Mr, Smith for a minute,

322
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,900
I want to hear from him
that everything's OK inside the house,

323
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,540
Fuck you, I'm running this shit,

324
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,620
<i>- You talk to me,
- That's right, Dennis.</i>

325
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,860
<i>You are running this shit.</i>

326
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,460
<i>Tell me you're the man in charge, that'll
be your responsibility. You understand?</i>

327
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,580
<i>Fuck you.
Don't try and play me.</i>

328
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,900
<i>You get us a helicopter
to fly us out of this shit.</i>

329
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,580
I'm just a local paper-pusher, Dennis,

330
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,220
<i>Get me a fucking helicopter
before I start shooting people.</i>

331
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,540
Be cool, Dennis, Be cool,

332
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,620
Nobody wants to hear guns go off in there,

333
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,980
You tell me you didn't shoot my cop?
All right, I believe you,

334
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,580
But nobody's gonna be able to help you
if you start hurting people in there,

335
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,060
<i>- You understand?
- Just get me what I want.</i>

336
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,340
- I'm not the guy, Dennis,
- Then get me the guy!

337
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,780
<i>- Louise, come back,
- Go, Chief.</i>

338
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,140
Confirmed the entire Smith family
is inside the house,

339
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,540
along with two suspects, possibly a third,

340
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,660
You want a hit?

341
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,460
OK,

342
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,980
- Can't get out this way,
- We can't get out this way, either,

343
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,740
- Hey, Dennis, Dennis,
- What?

344
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,980
- Dennis,
- What?

345
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,460
That cop... Mars just started shooting,

346
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,300
You know what, Kevin? Mars had a reason,

347
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,220
- Had a reason?
- Yeah,

348
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,020
Dennis, you've known that guy,
like, three weeks, and he just shot a cop,

349
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,660
Whose fault
do you think that was, Kevin? Huh?

350
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,740
- He shot a cop,
- Huh?

351
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,020
Maybe you should've stayed in the truck,
If you'd listened, you could've warned us,

352
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,540
You could've lied to the cop, Done
something other than fucking this shit up,

353
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,300
There's no way out up here,

354
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,580
<i>Hey, you guys
gotta come see this shit,</i>

355
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,820
Kitchen, Driveway,

00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,500
And office right there,

357
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,500
Holy shit,

<i>...apparently
a hostage situation is unfolding.</i>

359

<i>Hi. This is Walter Smith. You've reached
my voice mail. Please leave a message.</i>

We have a problem,
I can't get to the accountant,

370

I know, I'm watching it on TV,

We must get control of this situation,
We have nine hours until the hand-off,

<i>Bristo Camino

Shut up, Watch the TV,
That's the police, OK? They're gonna help,

- Under my bed? What's under my bed?
- Your bong, We can break it,

- Right from the jump,

405
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,700
Might want to get a minister
or a priest up here,

What do you want?

453
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:37,980
I want you to put your hands
on the roof of the car,

454
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,740
Pardon me,

455
00:41:54,860 --> 00:42:01,460
Now, would you mind putting your left
hand through the steering wheel, please?

456
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,620
Now bring me the right,

457
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,620
Good,

458
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,500
Good,

459
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,500
Now the guy behind you
is gonna take hold of you,

460
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:22,940
Don't struggle, It's for your own good,
Please,

461
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,460
Eyes in the rearview mirror, Now,

462
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,740
<i>- Daddy!
- Jane! Amanda!</i>

463
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,340
I know, I know, I know,

464
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,860
But at least they're still alive,

465
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,980
From this point on,
you control what happens to them,

466
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,260
Can we let you go?

467
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,380
Can you be calm?

468
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,740
Good, Good,

469
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:26,660
Now, listen to me, I want you
to go back to Walter Smith's house,

470
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:32,020
There's a DVD inside Walter Smith's
house that belongs to me,

471
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,660
I'm no longer in command,

472
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:38,740
You are going to reassume command
until my people arrive to finish the job,

473
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,420
You're not gonna let anyone
go into the house or anything come out,

474
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,900
Are you with me so far?

475
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,900
How am I gonna do that?

476
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:52,620
You... are the famous Jeff Talley,

477
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,700
Ten years SWAT,
seven years prime hostage negotiator,

478
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,660
You'll figure it out,

479
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:08,300
When this white phone rings,
it'll be me with further instructions,

480
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,340
If you deviate from the plan one little bit,

481
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,460
I will kill your wife,

482
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,700
And then I will kill your child,

483
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:23,300
But when I have what I want,
you get your family back,

484
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,180
Here,

485
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,340
Now, you wait until our van is gone
before you uncuff yourself,

486
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,780
Let's bring this home, Talley,

487
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,580
<i>- Yeah?
- We have a boy on the line.</i>

488
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,100
<i>And he says he's Tommy Smith.</i>

489
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,900
I was gonna turn him over to the Sheriff's,

490
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,500
but he says he saw you on TV
and he wants to speak with you,

491
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,300
<i>- All right, Louise. Put him on.
- Hold on,</i>

492
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,660
<i>- You're the man on TV?
- Yes, Tommy, this is the man on TV,</i>

493
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,620
<i>The guy called Dennis hit my dad,
and now he's...</i>

494
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,220
Slow down, slow down, slow down,
Slow down, Tommy, Slow down,

495
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,060
<i>I'm really, really scared,
and you gotta help us.</i>

496
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,060
Slow down and take it easy,

497
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,700
Was your dad shot?

498
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,420
<i>Dennis hit him
a bunch of times with his gun.</i>

499
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,260
<i>- He hit my dad.
- Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!</i>

500
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,100
<i>- He needs a doctor.
- Try and talk quietly, OK?</i>

501
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,740
<i>- Just take it easy,
- OK.</i>

502
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,260
All right,
Are you in a safe place?

503
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:16,580
<i>I'm in my bedroom.
They think I'm tied up, but I got free.</i>

504
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:20,540
Wait, Tommy,
How do you know they can't hear you?

505
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,940
<i>'Cause I can see them
on the security channel.</i>

506
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,980
Tell me everything you can see on the TV,

507
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,580
I see Dennis,

508
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,820
I see Kevin,

509
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,540
I see trees,

510
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,980
<i>I see army men.</i>

511
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,780
I see... the Mars guy...

512
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,900
<i>Wait, Tommy.</i>

513
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,580
Tell me about Mars,

514
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,940
- Captain Shoemaker?
- Get me an aerial shot ASAP,

515
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:48,980
This is Shoemaker,

516
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,780
<i>They're watching you
on the outside cameras.</i>

517
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,540
<i>Chief Talley?</i>

518
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,620
The suspects inside the house
are watching you,

519
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,260
<i>- They're watching every move you make,
- Where did you get this information?</i>

520
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,620
If I were you I'd be thinking about
what to do with that information,

521
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,820
Mikey, Yeah, it's me, Listen to me,

522
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,660
Yeah, Chief,

523
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,020
Yeah, the snipers are shifting positions,

524
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,940
<i>Louise? Louise, come back,</i>

525
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,340
<i>- Come on, Louise, Where's that patch?
- I'm locked out.</i>

526
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,460
It's a dedicated line, Chief,
They won't let me cut in,

527
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,020
What about Walter Smith's cell phone?
Did you get that?

528
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,140
<i>Uh... yes. Yes, I got it.</i>

529
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,540
<i>- OK, go,
- It's 805-459...</i>

530
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,540
Dennis, you know what I'm hearing?
I'm hearing your dad's a real son of a bitch,

531
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,260
<i>No, we're fucking done, OK?</i>

532
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,420
All I want is my fucking helicopter
to fly me the fuck out of here,

533
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,700
You got that, fuckhead?

534
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,020
<i>Dennis, listen, I...</i>

535
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,060
<i>Hi. This is Walter Smith.
You've reached my voice mail.</i>

536
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,620
<i>- Shit,
- Please leave a message.</i>

537
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,780
Come on, Dennis, Pick it up, Come on,

538
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,460
He keeps ringing,

539
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,900
<i>- Hello?
- Dennis, this is Jeff Talley.</i>

540
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,980
Listen to me, Watch the security channel,

541
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,900
<i>Dennis, can you hear me?</i>

542
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,420
Yeah, I don't really know
what you're talking about,

543
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,140
<i>The hell you don't!
Shut up and listen to me!</i>

544
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,860
<i>Just watch the TV.
Just keep watching the outside cameras.</i>

545
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,460
<i>- Yeah, what am I supposed to be seeing?
- Shut up!</i>

546
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,460
Get your ass on the floor
and watch the outside cameras, Dennis,

547
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,300
I'm watching, OK? I'm watching,

548
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,180
What?

549
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,420
What? What are they doing?

550
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,900
<i>- What?
- Talk to me, Dennis.</i>

551
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,460
<i>- Yeah, Yeah, I'm here,
- Listen to me. Listen to me carefully.</i>

552
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,580
<i>The Sheriff's playbook
is to make you dead.</i>

553
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,060
First they're gonna
shoot out those cameras,

554
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,860
<i>and then they're gonna shoot you.
Am I clear?</i>

555
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,260
<i>- What are you talking about?
- I'm trying to save your life!</i>

556
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,540
<i>- I don't understand what...
- Shut up! I'm trying to save your life.</i>

557
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,580
But you said you weren't the guy,

558
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,340
<i>I am the guy, Dennis,</i>

559
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,300
<i>I am the guy.</i>

560
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,220
TAC sergeant,
pull your people back 50 yards,

561
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,380
<i>Hold it, You turned
authority of this situation over,</i>

562
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,180
I'm reassuming command,
What are you waiting for?

563
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,260
Disregard,
You don't give orders to my men,

564
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,940
Now, ten minutes ago you called and
told me to shoot out the cameras, Now...

565
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,940
You shot out the cameras?

566
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,700
I give you great intel like that and you
just piss it away? Way to go, big time,

567
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,660
I am not gonna let you step back in
after you stepped out,

568
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,820
- This is my town,
- Captain Shoemaker!

569
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,340
I invited you into my jurisdiction,

570
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,340
Dennis says he doesn't trust me anymore,

571
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,780
Says he's gonna shoot a hostage
if he doesn't talk to Talley,

572
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,060
right now,

573
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,140
The name of the shooter
in the house is Mars,

574
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,260
You're gonna want to
run that through your database,

575
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,540
Your next question is:
How did I get that information?

576
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:26,540
The little boy in the house called me
on his sister's cell phone,

577
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,660
Chief?

578
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,420
Chief? You OK?

579
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,500
Go on back up top, kid,

580
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,500
Hey, Dennis, it's Jeff,
Everybody OK in there?

581
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:19,100
<i>- We're buggin' in here, man,
- I know. I know. I'm trying to help.</i>

582
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,900
Dennis, I really need
to talk to Walter Smith,

583
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,900
Smith's not talking,

584
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:32,100
Is Smith not talking
because you won't let him?

585
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:34,580
<i>- Or is he not talking because he can't?
- It's not my fault.</i>

586
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,100
I've hit people harder
and they haven't fallen!

587
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,500
<i>I know. I understand.</i>

588
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,780
You're under a lot of pressure in there,

589
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:44,700
But come on, man,
I just saved your life, and you know it,

590
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:48,020
<i>All I'm asking
is that you help me save his life,</i>

591
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,900
Come on,

592
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,140
He wants me to give up the old man,

593
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,980
Yeah, Yeah,

594
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:04,740
- It's your spin,
- Yeah, Good idea,

595
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:08,580
It's not a wise move,
We don't have enough information,

596
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,220
Look, I want to help,

597
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,420
But I am not gonna let you
do something that draws fire on my men,

598
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,540
You want to help me? Turn the lights off,

599
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,300
Get the bird out of here,

600
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,900
Please,

601
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:36,060
Mikey, I'm behind the command post,
Come on up here, will you?

602
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,300
I'm for breaking all the rules -
but one,

758
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,780
<i>Tommy, I need you to go back
to your room right now, OK?</i>

759
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:16,860
OK,

760
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,620
Did you turn your sister's cell phone
on vibrate like I told you?

761
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,620
<i>- Yeah.
- Good boy,</i>

762
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,940
<i>Wait for me to call you back, OK?</i>

763
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:25,900
<i>- OK,
- All right.</i>

764
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,260
<i>- I gotta get better plans to this house,
- s</i>

765
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,300
Where's Shoemaker?

766
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:38,340
<i>- Yeah,
- It's about Walter Smith.</i>

767
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:40,740
<i>- What happened?
- He's awake.</i>

768
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:44,900
<i>- I gave him the shot,
- OK.</i>

769
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:46,260
<i>Thanks.</i>

770
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,220
Mr, Smith, my name is Jeff Talley,

771
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:56,420
I'm the chief of police
here in Bristo Camino,

772
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,700
I've been talking to your son, Tommy,

773
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:03,780
He's still inside the house,
along with his sister Jennifer,

774
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:08,140
I know you know the kind of young men
they're dealing with,

775
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:14,300
I need that DVD, Mr, Smith,

776
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:17,740
You know what I'm talking about,

777
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:22,140
You save my children,

778
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:25,020
Of course I want to save your family,

779
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:32,900
But the only way I can do it
is if I get that DVD,

780
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,020
<i>Heaven Can Wait.</i>

781
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,940
Where is it?

782
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:51,900
<i>Office.</i>

783
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,100
Tommy,

784
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:13,180
<i>- You OK, buddy?
- Yeah, I'm fine,</i>

785
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:14,940
<i>Good.</i>

786
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,660
<i>Tommy, I have to ask you
a grown-up question now, OK?</i>

787
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:21,260
OK,

788
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,660
If you could do it safely,

789
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:27,780
and only if you could do it safely,

790
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:32,420
could you get into your daddy's office
without anyone seeing you?

791
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,380
I guess so, But my daddy says
I'm never ever supposed to go in there,

792
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:37,380
Shh, Keep your voice down, buddy,

793
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:39,620
Keep your voice down, Remember?

794
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,620
<i>OK. OK.</i>

795
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:49,220
- Tommy, do you like to play video games?
- Yeah,

796
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,740
<i>Do you?</i>

797
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:52,700
What kind of games do you play?

798
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:58,740
I like Monster Jam,
I play Bounty Hunter, I play Wubba Zorg...

799
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:01,020
Wubba Zorg, I know Wubba Zorg,

800
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:04,380
I know that game,

801
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,740
That means you know
who Agent Zero is, right?

802
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:09,540
<i>Yeah.</i>

803
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:12,540
What do you think
Agent Zero would do right now?

804
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:14,820
Do you think he would say
"never ever," Tommy?

805
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,340
No, he wouldn't say "never,"

806
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:20,660
Agent Zero would help Captain Wubba
save Planet Xenon,

807
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:23,420
Are you like Captain...
Are you like Captain Wubba?

808
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,420
<i>And my house is Planet Xenon.</i>

809
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,900
And Captain Wubba's
gonna save Planet Xenon,

810
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,860
<i>Right?</i>

811
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,540
Yeah, Tommy,

812
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:48,260
Captain Wubba's
gonna save Planet Xenon,

813
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,620
<i>But I need your help.</i>

814
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,500
Well, the most efficient entry point
is here, The pool area,

815
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:57,300
Four-man team ropes in, Silent entry
through one of the skylights here,

816
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,780
All right,

817
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:02,660
I put the doer and the two boys here in the
courtyard, I keep the two kids in the house,

818
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:06,500
- How much time you need for the play?
- Two minutes,

819
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:08,700
Say you can get
the hostages to the pool area,

820
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:11,980
How are you gonna get all three suspects
to this side of the house?

821
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:15,780
Well, we're about to jump off that bridge,
aren't we?

822
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:22,460
<i>- Yeah?
- I'm coming up.</i>

823
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,420
<i>- What?
- You and I are gonna talk.</i>

824
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,340
<i>Make sure you're alone.</i>

825
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:00,900
Dennis?

826
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,300
Dennis?

827
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:07,420
What do you want?

828
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,900
You by yourself?

829
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,180
Yeah,

830
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:16,420
We got a problem, Dennis,

831
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,300
Oh, yeah?

832
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:20,260
Yeah,

833
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:23,500
Walter Smith just died,

834
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:30,740
Hear what I said?

835
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:32,940
Yeah,

836
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:38,940
I know Mars killed my cop,
but Smith's death is on you, man,

837
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:44,620
Things just got a lot more complicated,
didn't they, Dennis?

838
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:48,500
Not to mention the fact
that helicopters are very expensive,

839
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:51,860
Gotta pay for the fuel, the pilot...

840
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:55,300
chief of police,

841
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:58,580
You know what cops do
when they retire, Dennis?

842
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,820
They play golf,

843
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:04,580
I don't want to play golf,
I hate fucking golf,

844
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,180
I want a house on the golf course,

845
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,900
I want that,

846
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:15,860
Walter Smith talked to me before he died,

847
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:19,060
I know about the money,

848
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:22,780
I don't know shit about money, man, I don't
know shit about what you're talking about,

849
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,740
I'm talking about a transaction,

850
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:29,060
You want a helicopter,
I want a house on the golf course,

851
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:35,660
Fifty thousand,

852
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:37,780
Maybe you can negotiate
with the sheriffs for that,

853
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,700
No, No!

854
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:41,660
No,

855
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,820
Shit,

856
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,860
Half,

857
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,820
I'll give you half, OK?

858
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:57,140
That's, like... two million, OK?
Half is good,

859
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:01,020
All right, Sell it to your crew,

860
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:03,420
Jennifer and Tommy stay in the house,

861
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:06,420
The three of you
down here in the courtyard,

862
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,900
I'll trade the helicopter for the cash,

863
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:11,460
How do I know
the pilot's not gonna shoot me?

864
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:14,100
Let me worry about the pilot,

865
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:18,140
You just make sure he gets that bag,
understand?

866
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,700
Yeah,

867
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,660
Half an hour,

868
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:52,740
<i>Heaven... Can... Wait.</i>

869
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:18,660
<i>I'm the one who did this, I'm
the one who had the balls, I made the deal,</i>

870
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,260
<i>Fine, Whatever, Just get us out,</i>

871
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,260
<i>I'm getting us out, Kevin,
What do you think I'm doing?</i>

872
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:25,540
<i>- You're just making it worse,
- Look, I always take care of you,</i>

873
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,300
Bullshit,

874
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:29,620
That's the way it is, Kevin,
Always has been and always will be,

875
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,900
Always, OK?

876
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,820
What... What if they just want
to get us outside just to shoot us?

877
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,620
They could have killed us,
like, a million times, Kev,

878
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,620
But they didn't,
because Talley wants to get paid,

879
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:42,340
Yeah, Get paid and then shoot us,

880
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,700
<i>We're leaving,</i>

881
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,700
Wait, Leaving where?

882
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:53,140
We're going on a helicopter ride,

883
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,260
No, No, I don't want to,

884
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,340
I'm not your girl,

885
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,940
I'm not going anywhere with you,
I'm not leaving...

886
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:15,100
You're my girl,

887
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,940
And my girl comes with me,

888
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:26,220
Red team ropes in,
Upon entry, our packages should be here,

889
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:29,220
This indoor pool area, Any questions?

890
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:56,260
It's all there!

891
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:58,780
- Two million,
- OK, Let's go,

892
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:00,660
Where's...

893
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:05,140
What's this?
This wasn't what we discussed,

894
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:07,220
This wasn't what we talked about,

895
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,980
Three people in the chopper,
That's all it can carry, Dennis,

896
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:14,820
I thought you were the man in charge,
Isn't that what you told me?

897
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,940
- You said, "I'm the man,"
- I am the man! I am in charge!

898
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:20,140
- Prove it,
- Mars, leave her!

899
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,700
Jenny and I aren't going nowhere,

900
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:26,340
Dennis, The man that owns
this house is a criminal,

901
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:29,220
So are his friends,
This money belongs to them,

902
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:31,780
- You want more money?
- They'll come after you and fuckin' kill you,

903
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:32,940
You want more fucking money?

904
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:34,940
You just chose
the wrong house on the wrong day,

905
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:36,300
- I'm not lying,
- Bullshit,

906
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:40,020
The only thing
I lied to you about was Smith,

907
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,460
He's not dead, You didn't kill anybody,

908
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:44,820
That means that you and your brother
can still beat the hard shit,

909
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:48,220
Just walk out of here with me,
Put those guns down and walk out now,

910
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,300
- Come on, don't let him fuck this up,
- Dennis, it's fucked,

911
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,100
They're gonna shoot us
as soon as we get through the gate,

912
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,660
<i>- You're lying to me!
- Shoot him,</i>

913
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,740
- What the fuck is that?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

914
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,260
Shoot him!

915
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,540
- I'm gonna turn around,
- You will not,

916
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,500
I'm gonna turn around
and walk out of here,

917
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:05,940
- And I will call you on the phone,
- Dennis, come on, Come on, Den,

918
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,540
- Shoot him!
- Dennis, Dennis, don't,

919
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:19,180
- We can go,
- Let him go,

920
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:21,180
- Fuck you,
- Come on, Kevin, Come with me,

921
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:22,700
- Grab the bags,
- Come on,

922
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:25,540
Get the goddamn bags,
Get the bags!

923
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,780
God damn it, Dennis!

924
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:31,380
<i>- Dennis...
- I am in charge,</i>

925
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:34,020
<i>Please, please, we need help!</i>

926
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,260
Please help us!

927
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:38,060
No, please! Please!

928
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:41,020
No, please! Help! No!

929
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,380
Stand down, Stand down,

930
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,860
Kids are in the house,

931
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,580
<i>I fucking hate you.</i>

932
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:22,100
I want to go,

933
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:24,420
Please,

934
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:26,380
I want to go,

935
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:35,980
- I'm your brother,
- I said I've fucking had it,

936
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:40,500
I'm your brother!
So you gotta choose, Me or Mars,

937
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:49,340
I choose the money,

938
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:51,180
Oh, You choose the money,

939
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:54,260
You choose the money?

940
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:03,940
- What do you think of that?
- Done?

941
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,140
Chief Talley,

942
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:26,980
The situation
has clearly gotten away from you,

943
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:28,820
Your flagrant disregard for protocol

944
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:32,740
has unnecessarily placed yourself
and my officers in the line of fire,

945
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:37,980
My opinion? You remain in command,
there's a probability of a negative outcome,

946
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:39,980
Jeff!

947
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:42,860
<i>- What are you doing?
- No, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff,</i>

948
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:46,500
You've just made it easier, Chief,
You're done, You're finished,

949
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:52,140
<i>Chief Talley? The FBI's here at
the barricade and they're asking for you.</i>

950
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,620
Where's Chief Talley?

951
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,740
Laura Shoemaker, Sheriff's Department,
I'm in command,

952
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:21,420
Are you Talley?

953
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,220
Walter Smith and his family are witnesses
under federal protection,

954
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:28,500
Chief, the US government would like to
thank you for your service and cooperation,

955
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:30,180
Chief, move, now,

956
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:32,340
Chief Talley is no longer in command here,

957
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:34,900
This is a federal matter now, ma'am,

958
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:38,300
Get in,

959
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:04,780
That would be the white phone,

960
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:13,780
Ah...

961
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:26,420
<i>- Yeah,
- You're almost home, Talley.</i>

962
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:30,780
<i>All you have to do is stay put
and leave the rest to my men.</i>

963
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:34,300
<i>When they recover the DVD,
you recover your family.</i>

964
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:36,300
Counterfeit feds,

965
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:40,260
Must be very expensive,

966
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,980
<i>Maybe they're real,</i>

967
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:43,740
<i>and maybe not.</i>

968
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:47,100
<i>The less you know, the better for you.</i>

969
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:16,300
Don't fucking touch me,

970
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:31,860
Look, when all this shit's done, it's just
gonna be you and me again, OK, Kev?

971
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,380
And with this kind of cake...

972
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:43,380
I mean, rich people
always got a way out, you know?

973
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:50,020
Come on, let me see how bad it is,

974
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:51,860
Kev,

975
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:54,860
God damn it, there are kids in that house,

976
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:57,500
Turn this into a smash-and-grab job
and people are gonna get killed,

977
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:00,580
You have your instructions, I have mine,
We'll leave it at that,

978
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:04,500
Come any closer to the house
and your family is dead,

979
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:35,020
It's over,

980
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:37,380
I'm taking them and going,

981
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:41,460
OK,

982
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,860
You gotta go, huh?

983
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:45,820
Go,

984
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:01,660
Shit!

985
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:03,500
Shit, Shit,

986
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:05,540
They shot him, They shot him,

987
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:10,260
I'm sorry, Kevin, I'm really sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

988
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,500
Shit!

989
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:16,540
Mars, they shot Kevin! Mars!

990
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:19,220
- Dennis,
- Mars?

991
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,780
Please, do something, Please,

992
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:23,980
Please, please, please...

993
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:25,980
- I am,
- What?

994
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:15,140
<i>Come on, hurry!</i>

995
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:17,020
Hurry, please!

996
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:19,420
Come on, hurry! Faster! Come on!

997
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:22,380
<i>Hurry, Hurry!</i>

998
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:27,260
Tommy! Run, Tommy, run!

999
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:36,220
Shoot him, Tommy! Shoot him!

1000
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:38,260
Shoot him!

1001
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:47,060
Tommy, shoot him! Shoot him!

1002
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:50,140
Shoot him, Tommy! Shoot him! Shoot him!

1003
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:57,540
Do it,

1004
01:24:57,620 --> 01:24:59,340
Please, Do it,

1005
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:10,860
Safety first,

1006
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,380
Come on!

1007
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:24,820
Come on, come on! Follow me!

1008
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,700
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

1009
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,980
Come on, Tommy,
Pick it up, kid, Come on,

1010
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:43,820
<i>- Come on, Tommy, pick it up,
- Chief Talley?</i>

1011
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:46,060
<i>- Who are you talking to?
- Tommy, where are you?</i>

1012
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:48,420
<i>- He's coming!
- Run away!</i>

1013
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:51,020
Tommy, Tommy, can you hear me?

1014
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:53,060
<i>Answer me, Tommy.</i>

1015
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,180
<i>- Go faster, go faster,
- Come on,</i>

1016
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:03,020
Come on, This way,

1017
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,420
Oh, Jesus,

1018
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,660
No!

1019
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:14,980
Come on, you've gotta go faster!
Come on!

1020
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:17,580
Go, go! He's coming,

1021
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:21,860
Tommy!

1022
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:46,860
Tommy, answer me,

1023
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,500
<i>Answer me, Tommy!</i>

1024
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,580
It's OK, He can't see us,

1025
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:02,500
He can't see us,

1026
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:17,300
Oh, my God,
Oh, my God! No! No!

1027
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:27,860
Christ!

1028
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:05,740
- Chief Talley!
- You did very good, You did really good,

1029
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:06,820
OK,

1030
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,380
Jennifer, come on,
We have to leave right now,

1031
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:11,340
Come on, Get that shower on in there, Go,

1032
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:12,980
- Get the shower on, get some towels wet,
- I found them,

1033
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:15,100
Get 'em soaked,
Tommy, come on, Come on,

1034
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:17,820
- I've got your special movies,
- Oh, my God,

1035
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:20,620
You were very brave,
But it's not over, right?

1036
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:23,620
Go help your sister, We're still
in trouble, all right? Hurry, please,

1037
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:40,380
Fuck!

1038
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:53,260
<i>Come on, come on, Get down,</i>

1039
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,420
Gun - down,

1040
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:07,220
Turn around, slowly,

1041
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:11,820
Nobody leaves till I get what I need,

1042
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:13,740
Just let 'em get to the front door,

1043
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:48,060
Just let 'em go,

1044
01:32:58,980 --> 01:33:00,380
<i>Down, Get down!</i>

1045
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:19,260
Come on,

1046
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:50,300
Thanks for everything, man,
How bad?

1047
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:52,500
You could be bleeding to death,
we wouldn't even know it,

1048
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:55,300
<i>You gotta get to a hospital, Jeff, Now,</i>

1049
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:57,460
No time,

1050
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:02,100
Yeah?

1051
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:06,620
<i>Do you know how bad you have
fucked this up? Your family is dead!</i>

1052
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:08,100
<i>- Shut up,
- They are fucking dead.</i>

1053
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:10,340
Shut up,
Just shut up and listen to this,

1054
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:12,980
- Fuck! Talk,
- It's me,

1055
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:14,940
This is Walter Smith,

1056
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:19,340
Now what?

1057
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:34,460
Look out the window,

1058
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:01,580
<i>Listen to me, I...
I don't even know who these people are,</i>

1059
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:03,940
Or what they do, I cook the books,

1060
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:08,420
You know, set up shell companies,
offshore accounts,

1061
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:13,260
And then I would encrypt it onto a disk
and leave it at the drop point,

1062
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:15,660
I mean...

1063
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:19,340
It was never face to face,

1064
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:46,100
I want to see my family,

1065
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:24,500
<i>Jane? Amanda?</i>

1066
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:26,420
Shh, Shh,

1067
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,540
It's OK, baby,

1068
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:33,020
We're gonna be out of here
in just a minute,

1069
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:42,740
<i>Now, only the famous Jeff Talley
could come up with a rig like that,</i>

1070
01:37:42,820 --> 01:37:45,180
And I see you've taken a bullet,

1071
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:50,260
Walter, you're looking
fairly banged-up as well,

1072
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:53,460
How do I know you still have what I need?

1073
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:56,820
- Trinidad...
- Wait,

1074
01:37:56,900 --> 01:38:00,420
- Go ahead,
- Trinidad Mercantile, Dominican Republic,

1075
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,660
Uh... Michelangelo Sister Trust,

1076
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:08,900
The account number's Brenda 65007265,

1077
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:10,380
<i>...65,</i>

1078
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:12,220
Um... Um...

1079
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:14,500
- Dutch Antilles National...
- Shut up,

1080
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:18,500
- Dutch Antilles...
- Shut up, Walter,

1081
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:20,540
<i>- You're good,
- OK,</i>

1082
01:38:20,620 --> 01:38:22,860
You can let 'em leave now, right?

1083
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:25,500
Just let my family leave,
Walk 'em to the door,

1084
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:28,260
I leave with 'em, Smith stays here,

1085
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:31,260
Everybody's happy,

1086
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:39,460
I haven't seen your face,

1087
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:41,700
I haven't seen any of your faces!

1088
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:46,020
<i>I leave you alone, you leave me alone,</i>

1089
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:52,620
You're negotiating?
Is that what this is, Talley?

1090
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:55,740
You're gonna wear me down?

1091
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:58,380
I'm just trying to bring us all home,

1092
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:03,500
Cut Walter loose, Send him over next
to me, and we will disappear into the day,

1093
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:05,980
Let them go,
I'll stay here, Just let them go,

1094
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:09,660
You get this one thing: I don't bargain,

1095
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:12,580
I give, You take, That's it,

1096
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:14,780
Cut him loose,

1097
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:24,220
Good,

1098
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:29,100
Hands, Hands up, in the air,

1099
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:33,220
Oh, you're a fucking dead man,
You're a fucking dead man!

1100
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,900
Thank you very fucking much,
He hasn't seen your face?

1101
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:38,380
<i>- He's seen my face!
- My family hasn't seen his face,</i>

1102
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:40,380
- What are you waiting for? Kill him!
- They didn't see his face,

1103
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:41,460
Come on,

1104
01:39:41,540 --> 01:39:43,900
My family hasn't seen Walter Smith's face!
Just let 'em go!

1105
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:47,180
- Come on, what are you waiting for?
- Just let 'em leave! Just let 'em go now!

1106
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:51,140
Goddammit, kill him!

1107
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:16,380
<i>Daddy.</i>
