1
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,667
Did you hear that?

2
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,634
Come on.

3
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,685
Freeze, this is the police.

4
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,770
Drop your weapons
and place your hands above your heads.

5
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,053
And in the local news,

6
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:25,264
six youth gang members were killed
in a shoot-out last night

7
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,683
with police in South Los Angeles.

8
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,103
Police Commissioner Davidson called
a news conference earlier this morning

9
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,980
to comment on the shooting.

10
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,232
As Police Commissioner
of Los Angeles County,

11
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:39,737
I have called this emergency
news conference. We have a crisis.

12
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,240
The juvenile gang problem
is completely out of control.

13
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,452
The missing automatic weapons
have not been recovered.

14
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,037
We now have a lead which shows

15
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,582
that some of the weapons
have fallen into the wrong hands.

16
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:55,586
It's true that law enforcement
is being driven to deplorable extremes,

17
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:59,382
but those guns are out there.
And believe me,

18
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,970
if the people who have them get organized,
no one will stand a chance.

19
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,388
Commissioner Davidson also said

20
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,722
that several weapons have been...

21
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,203
For the six.

22
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,780
One-W-90, this is Lieutenant Bishop in
unmarked vehicle, requesting assignment.

23
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,698
Is Staff Seven there?

24
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,368
Stand by.

25
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,206
One-W-20, this is Staff Four.

26
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,584
If I look around real hard,
maybe I can find something for you to do.

27
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:45,714
Hey, hey, Captain Collins. Hello there.
I'm surprised to hear your voice, sir.

28
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:51,137
W-20, so,
how's it going so far, Lieutenant?

29
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:56,976
One-W-90, okay. Seeing as
I've been on the job exactly four minutes.

30
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,229
W-20, I've got
a temporary reassignment for you tonight.

31
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,732
A little supervisory job
for the Police Department.

32
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:08,237
Proceed to Precinct Nine, Division 13,
and take over from Captain Gordon.

33
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,409
-Isn't that the Anderson Precinct?
-Affirmative.

34
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,912
But they're closing it down.

35
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:21,000
Nothing for me to do there,
except stare at the packing crates.

36
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,336
You wanna be a hero
your first night out, Lieutenant?

37
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,380
Yes, sir.

38
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,090
There are no heroes
anymore, Bishop,

39
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,343
only men who follow orders.

40
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:36,015
W-90, yes, sir.
Proceeding to Precinct Nine, Division 13.

41
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,434
KMA-492 off.

42
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:03,959
Starker?

43
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,008
This way.

44
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:16,305
-Well, they sure gave you some sweet job.
-Better than some.

45
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,517
Carrying a busload of hate
is not my idea of better than anything.

46
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,695
This is Wells and Caudell.

47
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,823
-Is he all right?
-He's just got a little cold.

48
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,453
-Where's Wilson?
-We got him in a special room.

49
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,631
This is Napoleon Wilson.

50
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,718
-Got a smoke?
-Close the door.

51
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:02,434
I want you to know something, Wilson.

52
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,522
Now, I don't enjoy driving
anybody to death row.

53
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,566
You try anything, anything,

54
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:14,280
I've got two guards with shotguns
and they'll blow you apart.

55
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:19,285
-Sure could use a smoke.
-You understand me, Wilson?

56
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:23,872
You mumble a little bit,
but I get the general idea.

57
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,667
Let's go.

58
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,433
Slipped right out of the chair.

59
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,566
Yeah. I don't sit in chairs
as well as I used to.

60
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,279
-Get him up.
-Come on, let's go.

61
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,932
I'm all jealous of you, Wilson.
You get all this VIP treatment.

62
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,268
Here they let me walk around almost free.

63
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,187
-Hey.
-What?

64
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,689
-You got a smoke on you?
-Yeah.

65
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,567
-But I'm not gonna give it to you.
-Why not?

66
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:39,281
-Not good for you. Smoking can kill you.
-You don't like competition, huh?

67
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:44,620
-You think you're real fancy, don't you?
-I have moments.

68
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,915
All right, knock off the talking.
Let's move. Move.

69
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,302
Okay if I stretch a minute?

70
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,763
You're gonna chain me to a seat
and drive for hours.

71
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,349
We get to Sonora,
you're gonna chain me in a cell.

72
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:11,522
Maybe for as long as 90 years.
Chains is all I got to look forward to.

73
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,856
Go ahead.

74
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,407
You know, Wilson, I'm gonna miss you.

75
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,496
That's not the truth, Warden.

76
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,086
Now, you should always tell the truth.

77
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,339
Even a little white lie
can sometimes trip a man up.

78
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,560
He don't stand up as good as he used to.

79
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,247
...but the
sun-spotting caused an unusually...

80
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,583
...with the early morning
shooting of six youths,

81
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,042
now known to be members of

82
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,296
a South Los Angeles gang
known as Street Thunder.

83
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,508
Davidson also commented on
the highly unusual interracial mixture

84
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,094
of the gang victims, and pointed...

85
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:41,153
All right, let's go over this again.
Now, what are you gonna tell Margaret?

86
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,531
-I forget.
-You're gonna say, "Margaret,

87
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,326
"I want you to come up and live with us
now that Fred is gone."

88
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,996
I want you to come and live with us,
now that Fred is dead.

89
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,831
-Gone.
-Gone.

90
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,085
"We have a big spare room
all ready for you."

91
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,755
We have a big spare room all ready for you.

92
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,468
"And I told my daddy,
if you don't come up and live with us,

93
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:09,181
-"then I'm gonna run away from home."
-She'll never buy that.

94
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,476
Okay, drop that one.

95
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,311
-Daddy?
-Yeah?

96
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,605
I'm hungry.

97
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:21,693
You'd rather eat than get your nanny
out of this horrible neighborhood.

98
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:25,948
Well, I'd know what to say to her better
if I had something to eat.

99
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,826
Where is that street?
I can never seem to find that street.

100
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,708
Why don't we ask them?

101
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,131
Bonaire Place. I think it's down here,
just a couple of blocks more.

102
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,385
Mrs. Seward says a policeman's
always there to answer questions

103
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,971
and to help you when you're in trouble.

104
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:53,892
Obviously, Mrs. Seward has never taken
any big steps outside of the sixth grade.

105
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,811
Huh?

106
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,481
We're not in any trouble, honey.

107
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,718
-Yeah?
-Hello, I'm Lieutenant Bishop.

108
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:21,641
Yes, sir.
One moment. I'll tell the Captain you're here.

109
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,331
-Hello, Lieutenant.
-Hi.

110
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,125
-I'm Leigh.
-Ethan Bishop.

111
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,710
This is Julie.

112
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,172
-Hello, Julie.
-Hello.

113
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,801
-Things are quiet.
-For a change.

114
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:59,888
-You took over at the right time.
-Apparently.

115
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,598
When are you moving?

116
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:05,018
They shut off the phones and the electricity
at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

117
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,480
-That sounds pretty final.
-Would you like some coffee, Lieutenant?

118
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,066
-Yes, thank you.
-Just made some fresh. I'll get you a cup.

119
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,359
Thanks.

120
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,072
Hello, 7814.

121
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,576
No, I'm sorry,
the precinct has been relocated.

122
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:27,499
Let me give you the new number. 734-3612.

123
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,418
You're welcome.

124
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:35,090
The phone company should be doing this.
They're supposed to cut in at 5:00.

125
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:41,471
Hello. May I speak to Supervisor 12, please?

126
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,766
Yes, hello. This is 734-374...

127
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:58,405
-Black?
-For over 30 years.

128
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,952
I'm sorry. Two sugars.

129
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,793
I grew up four blocks from here.

130
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:19,676
When I was about four or five, my father
sent me in here one day with a note.

131
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,514
Detective read it and said,
"We lock up little boys who can't behave."

132
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,765
When he went to call my father,

133
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,936
I carved something on the top of his desk
with a letter opener.

134
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:34,566
For months, I was afraid he might see it
and come after me.

135
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,818
Why did your father send you in here?

136
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,488
For using foul language
in the presence of my mother.

137
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,118
What did you carve on the desk?

138
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,584
Kind of advanced for a little kid.

139
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:59,507
Your father or somebody obviously
got you out of Anderson early enough.

140
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,515
The Captain would like
to see you now, Lieutenant.

141
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,476
Be right there.

142
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:14,230
By the way,

143
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:17,943
no one took me out of Anderson
when I was a baby.

144
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:21,529
I walked out, myself, when I was 20.

145
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:27,077
-Enjoy your new police station.
-I will. Thanks for the coffee.

146
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:34,125
Well, are they out?
Then get them out!

147
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,420
Double your patrols.
Go ahead. Send them up there.

148
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:41,383
Don't call over here every time
another division stubs its toe.

149
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:48,473
What a night.
We've had a 3-12 every 15 minutes.

150
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:52,852
Twelve stolen cars, three burglaries,
eight aggravated assaults.

151
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,854
And it's not even 8:00.

152
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,242
Could be the sunspots.

153
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,538
Pressure on the atmosphere.

154
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,083
I heard it on the radio.

155
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:22,632
It's 7:00. I'm going over
to the new station on Ellendale.

156
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:27,595
You take over here
till Weaver comes in at 4:00.

157
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,767
All you do is answer the telephone
and send over any strays.

158
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:36,563
There may be some who still think
this is a police station.

159
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:50,452
-Are there any facilities left over here?
-A couple of cells and a bathroom.

160
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,496
I don't understand
why this place is still open.

161
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:58,918
Well, it is and it isn't, Lieutenant.
The result of transition.

162
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,212
I really think someone in the central office

163
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:05,091
wanted to give you
something special on your first night out.

164
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,388
That sure got around fast.

165
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,711
I'm going to talk to Wilson. Watch me.

166
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:00,475
You don't mind if I sit down
a minute or two, do you, Wilson?

167
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,853
-Got a smoke on you?
-You asked me before.

168
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:08,191
-Well, I never got a definite answer.
-I don't smoke.

169
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,276
That's a definite answer.

170
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,696
Another one gone.

171
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,493
When you're in my position,
days are like women.

172
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:25,333
Each one is so goddamn precious.
They always end up leaving you.

173
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,753
What do you want?

174
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:33,174
-Why? Do I have to want something?
-You're a cop.

175
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:37,011
You're either curious about me,
or you wanna give me some shit.

176
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:41,641
-I don't understand you, Wilson.
-Curious.

177
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,439
-You're not a psychopath. You're not stupid.
-I am an asshole.

178
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,904
-Can't take everything away from me.
-Why did you kill those men?

179
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:02,704
Everybody asks me the same question.

180
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,874
I always tell them the same thing.

181
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,337
First time I ever saw a preacher,

182
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:16,342
he said to me,
"Son, there's something strange about you.

183
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:22,056
"You got something to do with death."
Being real young, I believed him.

184
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:27,770
-Turned out he was right.
-That's no answer.

185
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:35,486
-I thought it was pretty good.
-Where'd you get a name like Napoleon?

186
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,239
-I'll tell you sometime.
-When?

187
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,284
Moment of dying.

188
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:46,164
I'm gonna do my best to be there
when your time comes.

189
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,171
Hey.

190
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,341
He's really sick.

191
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,144
I thought the warden said it was only a cold.

192
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,104
The man is sick.

193
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:23,701
-How long till we get to Sonora?
-Another six hours.

194
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,453
We gotta stop.

195
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,707
What's the closest precinct?

196
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,337
Anderson.

197
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:21,717
-Descanso to Pinehurst.
-Daddy?

198
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,761
-To Glen Oaks?
-Daddy?

199
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:27,140
-Daddy, the ice-cream man.
-Wait a second, Margaret.

200
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:57,086
Here you go. Okay, by your place?

201
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:04,719
Descanso to Pine...
I mean, Descanso to Glen Oaks, right?

202
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,722
Right. Then I...

203
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,774
Can I get an ice cream?

204
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,155
-It's late, sweetheart. I'm closed.
-The music's still playing.

205
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,711
Please, can't I get an ice cream?

206
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,673
-What flavor?
-Vanilla twist.

207
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,488
Oh, Jesus. Come on.

208
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:09,700
Come on, I'll give you my money.
Just don't hurt me, please. Please.

209
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,933
Hey, this is regular vanilla.

210
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,483
I wanted vanilla twist.

211
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:01,794
Okay, Margaret, I'll see you
in a few minutes. Right, bye.

212
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:45,463
Gun. In the truck, under the dash.

213
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,604
-Hello.
-Hello, Lieutenant, Special Officer Starker.

214
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,231
Ethan Bishop.

215
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,692
I'm on my way to Sonora
with three prisoners.

216
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,236
About half an hour ago
one of them got pretty sick.

217
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,238
-I think it's serious.
-What is it?

218
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:38,242
Well, I don't know, but I'd like to put him in
your holding tanks until I can call a doctor.

219
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,828
I guess you didn't see the sign.

220
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,914
Well, the station isn't here anymore.
It's being relocated.

221
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,249
Well, yeah, but you're here.

222
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,168
Waiting for the electricity
to go off in the morning.

223
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:51,172
Are you telling me that
I can't put them in your holding tanks?

224
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:55,176
If you just get back on the main boulevard,
go about 10 blocks...

225
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,803
Look, I don't have a lot of time to discuss it.

226
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:02,391
Now, if what that man has in the bus
is infectious, then all of us will have it.

227
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:04,602
Now, the sooner we can put him
in the holding tanks

228
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,479
and I get on the phone and call a doctor...

229
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:09,064
-Okay. Bring him in.
-All right.

230
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:10,918
-Isn’t that overdoing it a little?
-Napoleon Wilson.

231
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,712
No kidding.

232
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:26,433
-Got a smoke?
-No. Sorry.

233
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:34,692
Well, you see one floating around,
snag it for me, will you?

234
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,626
-May be a sick man back there.
-Just passing through.

235
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:18,694
I have to admit it, Wilson.
You do have some fancy moves.

236
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,654
For a man in leg irons.

237
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:09,865
Come on, man, pull yourself together.
Come on, speak up.

238
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,576
Speak up.

239
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,206
Lieutenant?

240
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,044
-Who?
-Wait a minute.

241
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:28,092
-Lot of action for a closed-down station.
-Ease up a little, Chaney. He can't talk.

242
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,844
He says there's somebody following him.

243
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,889
Who...

244
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:38,185
Come on. Look, operator,
I have been waiting 10 minutes.

245
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,940
What do you mean?
Where's he gone to?

246
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,317
-He's gone on a coffee break.
-What's your name?

247
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,319
What do you mean
he's not available?

248
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,113
Who's after you?

249
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:50,739
Who's after you?

250
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:55,035
Where is he? Coffee break?
Get him off the coffee break.

251
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:00,415
Yes, I'll continue holding. Police doctors.

252
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:04,378
-Just relax.
-Just a minute. Let's calm down...

253
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,172
-There's nobody out there.
-Let's try to...

254
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:08,298
You're safe now.

255
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,259
Chaney, help me take him
to the Captain's office.

256
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:11,718
-Take it easy.
-Come on.

257
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,555
Hello? I just got cut off.

258
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,100
Do we have a blanket somewhere?

259
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,476
-Yeah.
-Okay, wrap him up.

260
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,061
-Make sure he stays warm.
-Right.

261
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,105
-I'll call the doctor.
-Good luck.

262
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:28,235
I mean, first I got put on hold, then I got
cut off, and now I can't even get a dial tone.

263
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,239
They didn't cut you off.

264
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,491
-What are you talking about?
-The phone's dead.

265
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:37,828
Maybe the company shut it off early.

266
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,455
That's it. I'm leaving.

267
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,834
Lieutenant, you run this station
like chicken night in Turkey.

268
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,419
Thanks a lot!

269
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:54,178
He was mumbling,
something about his daughter being shot.

270
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,890
-Where?
-I don't know. He still can hardly talk.

271
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,766
What about the phone?

272
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,945
-Now what?
-Power failure?

273
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,281
The streetlights are still on.

274
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,582
I'll call Ellendale on the two-way in my car.

275
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,929
Chaney just fell down.

276
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:08,585
-He didn't fall. He was shot.
-What?

277
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,587
Couldn't tell if he was still alive.

278
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:15,008
-But there wasn't any sound.
-Silencers. They're using silencers.

279
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,600
They're in those trees over there.

280
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:26,561
Why would anybody shoot
at a police station?

281
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:37,990
Starker! Lock the doors!
Stay down, away from the windows!

282
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,123
Phone breaks down,
the lights go off.

283
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,710
With the highway patrol running this place,
it's amateur night in Dixie.

284
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:05,183
Open the door! Let me in!

285
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,440
Get up!

286
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:49,227
You're not gonna let us sit in here.
At least take these cuffs off.

287
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:50,687
Hey! Hey!

288
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,879
-Leigh?
-Yeah?

289
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,263
I want you to stay at the window.

290
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,103
I'll be right back.

291
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,569
-You both all right?
-Fabulous, as usual.

292
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:48,114
What's happening out there?

293
00:47:56,457 --> 00:48:01,962
Hey. Come on! We got a right
to know what's happening. Hey!

294
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:08,760
Left out again.
Life just seems to pass us by, doesn't it?

295
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:21,940
-I think they're gone. I can't see anything.
-Is there a back way out?

296
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,401
Past the holding tanks,
there's a door at the rear.

297
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:28,655
-We're blocked off back there.
-How come?

298
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,408
There's a big wall
with a barbed wire fence around it.

299
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:34,953
The only way out from the back
is to come around front.

300
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:37,747
Come with me.

301
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,182
-What about the houses behind the wall?
-Empty.

302
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,727
All the houses in back are condemned
and boarded up.

303
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:00,854
No one lives nearby anymore?

304
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,857
There are two houses
at the end of the block.

305
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:09,362
-How far are they from the station?
-500, 600 yards.

306
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:29,215
-That means no one nearby heard anything.
-That's impossible!

307
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:35,972
They're using silencers. No gun shots.
The only sounds are the windows breaking.

308
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:38,558
Well, somebody could've heard that.

309
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:44,356
I really think they're gone.
I mean, take a look.

310
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,912
-I found a box of magnesium flares.
-No flare gun.

311
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:03,208
Figures. Try to get that open.

312
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,173
Nothing.

313
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,176
-Not a goddamn thing moving anywhere.
-See?

314
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,138
If you'll just look outside,
you'll see they're gone.

315
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:19,349
Look, I can't get this open.

316
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,654
Damn thing's solid.

317
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,949
What are you doing with that thing?
We should be figuring a way to get out of...

318
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,992
You got any suggestions?

319
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:48,837
We're gonna stay here and hold
until somebody comes. Okay?

320
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:52,424
We're in the middle of a city,
inside a police station.

321
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,970
Someone is bound to drive by eventually.

322
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,725
It may take 15, 20 minutes. They'll come.

323
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:17,991
It doesn't look like they cut our phone lines.
They're still connected to the pole.

324
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,161
I'll bet they took out
a whole pole down the block.

325
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,913
What does that mean?

326
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:29,461
If phone lines are down in the area,
no one nearby can call in.

327
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,755
But doesn't the phone company
automatically know

328
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,926
-where there's a line down?
-Wait a minute. There they are.

329
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:26,768
-They've set up a road block.
-Someone's coming!

330
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,413
What does that mean?

331
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:37,046
I think
we've just been marked for something.

332
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:43,928
-Let me guess what it is.
-This is a siege. It's a goddamn siege.

333
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,646
He's the one they want.

334
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:58,276
Why don't we give him to them?

335
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,990
Well, don't give me that civilized look.

336
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:10,663
This is my station tonight.
He came in here for help.

337
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:13,708
He's gonna get all the help we can give him.

338
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:20,798
-Very nice, Lieutenant.
-Thank you.

339
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:24,052
No!

340
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:30,516
Get them out of the cells.

341
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:54,832
Come on, baby. Hurry it up.

342
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:05,051
Okay. Get out front. Quick. Move!

343
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,441
Hide!

344
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:02,233
Give me a gun!
They're coming down the hall.

345
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:08,114
-I can't hold it.
-Shit!

346
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,735
The windows!

347
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,332
Watch the front.

348
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:28,648
Julie?

349
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:41,637
Wilson?

350
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:44,932
We gotta barricade that door.
Give me a hand.

351
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:48,060
Wells, you watch the front
and the two offices.

352
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,951
You saved my life. Twice now.

353
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:48,871
Twice?

354
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,665
First time outside by the bus.

355
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:55,544
I figured that was a mistake on your part,
so I let it go.

356
01:01:55,629 --> 01:02:00,549
Then you did it again
when you pulled us out of the cells.

357
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:03,469
You must be serious
about keeping me alive.

358
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,014
I want all of us alive.

359
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:15,481
This time I know somebody heard us.
There'll be squad cars here in five minutes.

360
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,251
Acetylene.

361
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:41,257
-If a stray bullet had hit this...
-Come look at this.

362
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:53,769
How is it?

363
01:02:53,854 --> 01:02:57,148
I can't move it,
and it hurts like a son of a bitch.

364
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:06,866
That was close timing in there.
You were good.

365
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:13,539
If I'd been any good in here,
maybe she'd still be alive.

366
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,803
They moved the cars.

367
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:33,809
Can't believe it.
They parked them where they were before.

368
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:38,022
-Why'd they do that?
-From a distance, the street looks normal.

369
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:43,194
-Like nothing happened.
-Like nothing happened?

370
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:47,490
They gunned down five police
officers, a secretary, one prisoner!

371
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:51,160
We killed a dozen of them,
and that's "nothing happened"?

372
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:54,580
Where are the bodies?

373
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,262
They took them away.

374
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:21,357
-How'd they do it so fast?
-Maybe they got the good fairy to help them.

375
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:23,734
You really are a smart ass.

376
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:33,953
-Prison bus is gone and so are the bodies.
-They dragged old Starker away.

377
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:40,793
Too bad. I promised to tell him something.

378
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:44,922
What's going on?
What are they doing out there?

379
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:49,635
They're hiding every single sign that
there's been an attack on this building.

380
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,305
What I wanna know is
what started all of this?

381
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,727
He came running in here,

382
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:04,942
-Jesus Christ, 30 minutes ago!
-Now, all of this about one man?

383
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:09,822
Don't forget the Cholo.
They delivered it to us.

384
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:16,120
You look like somebody spit in your socks.

385
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:19,540
No one said anything about the Cholo.

386
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:24,044
All right, all right. What does it mean?
What does it mean?

387
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:26,171
It means they don't care.

388
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,969
They're not afraid to die. Any of them.

389
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:36,015
They want to rip us apart,
no matter what it costs.

390
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:42,896
-It means to the death.
-How do you know so much about it?

391
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:47,318
I spent some time in a cell with one of them
crazy young bastards once.

392
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:53,324
This can't happen.
Not in the middle of a city.

393
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:58,370
-Not today.
-Then let's pinch each other and wake up.

394
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:04,293
There was gun fire for a minute and a half,
two minutes.

395
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:09,965
-I can't believe no one heard us.
-Maybe they heard it. What do they see?

396
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:13,344
An empty street? An empty police station?

397
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:16,639
Maybe somebody from
the new precinct will come by.

398
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:22,561
In the meantime, I've got this plan.
Now, it's called save ass.

399
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:24,647
Now, the way it works is this.

400
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:28,275
I slip out of one of these windows,
and I run like a bastard.

401
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,568
Wells.

402
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:37,159
-You know I can't let you do that.
-I'm not asking you to let me.

403
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,161
They'll cut you down before you get 10 feet.

404
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:44,792
-Are you on his side, Wilson?
-No sides to it. We're all together.

405
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,256
I've been shot once tonight.

406
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:55,219
I don't feel like a second time.

407
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:04,019
I just wanted to say one thing to you
before you jump out that window.

408
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:05,229
When they drag you off,

409
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:08,774
I'll lean out and ask them
if they wouldn't mind saying a little prayer

410
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:12,820
as they dump you in some vacant lot
next to the five other police officers

411
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:15,239
and your sick, handcuffed friend.

412
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:26,959
I go through all that
and his gun isn't even loaded.

413
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:41,056
Goddamn silencer.
I've been clicking off empty shots all night,

414
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:43,058
and I didn't even know it.

415
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:52,443
Very close timing. You are good.

416
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:55,612
Sometimes.

417
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,159
Problem is he's not alone.

418
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:04,788
This goddamn thing's
got three shots left in it.

419
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:07,332
-Wilson?
-Three rounds.

420
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:10,002
-Leigh.
-Two shots.

421
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:14,339
If there's any spare ammunition
around here, I don't know where it is.

422
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,477
Anybody got a smoke?

423
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,115
Got a light?

424
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,649
One-X-Five,
we have a series of reports

425
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,692
of firecrackers and/or gunfire

426
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:17,277
between Ninth and Warren.

427
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:22,658
The telephone service is still out in
the fourth quadrant from Warren to Vermont.

428
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:26,703
Telephone repair vehicle does not
respond to radio communication.

429
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:30,999
Jesus Christ. We got a war going on
down here and we can't find the damn thing.

430
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:35,754
This is Unit Seven. We are making
a rapid circuit of Quadrant Four.

431
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:40,092
Everything looks quiet and normal.
Nothing unusual to report at this time.

432
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,552
We're gonna make another full circuit.

433
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:45,889
Suggest backup vehicles
and helicopter surveillance, over.

434
01:09:45,974 --> 01:09:49,017
One-X-Five,
as soon as other units are available,

435
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:51,311
they will be sent into your area.

436
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:54,147
All helicopters are in use at this time.

437
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:57,109
How the hell do they expect us
to find anything without backup?

438
01:09:57,193 --> 01:10:02,865
-It's that damn Saturday night overload.
-This is Unit Seven, 10-4.

439
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:07,494
Hey, don't you want to check that street?

440
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:09,705
-That's Gramercy, wasn't it?
-Yeah.

441
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:13,000
-Nothing down there but the old station.
-Don't you wanna cruise it?

442
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:14,334
What for?

443
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:27,180
-It'll work.
-You guys are crazy.

444
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:29,016
-You sure about the basement?
-I'm sure.

445
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,642
-What if you're wrong?
-I said I was sure.

446
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:31,768
But what if you're wrong?

447
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:34,563
I've worked here for five years.
I ought to know the place.

448
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:52,623
-Looks pretty good to me.
-Looks like hell, but it's all we got.

449
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:55,000
Who goes?

450
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:59,963
I gotta tell you,
I don't know how to hot wire a car.

451
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:03,467
I'm a cop.

452
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:11,266
-Between me and Snow White.
-Shit! Shit, shit!

453
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:14,227
What's wrong?
We haven't flipped a coin yet.

454
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,355
I'm gonna lose.

455
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:20,233
-You got a bad attitude, Wells.
-I always lose.

456
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:23,862
Had bad luck all my life.
How do you think I ended up in here?

457
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:30,494
-Maybe it'll change.
-It might. If we don't flip a coin.

458
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:32,955
-Let's do something else.
-What?

459
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:34,331
Potatoes.

460
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,002
All right.

461
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:46,176
One potato, two potato,
three potato, four.

462
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,803
Five potato, six potato, seven potato, more.

463
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:50,639
Eight potato, nine potato, ten potato,
eleven. Kiss my ass and go to heaven.

464
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,224
Y-O-U spells you.

465
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,476
I told you I'd lose.
God damn it, we're gonna do it again.

466
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,687
Hey, hey. There isn't time.

467
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,902
-Well, how come she's out of it?
-All right, if I can do it with one arm.

468
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:10,033
Still no sign of them. Let's get moving.

469
01:12:10,118 --> 01:12:14,830
-You want me to show you where it is?
-I'll take him down. You stay up here.

470
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:21,920
It's right next to the furnace.
You can't miss it.

471
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:28,135
Nobody gonna wish me luck?

472
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:30,345
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

473
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:35,017
Look at that. Two cops wishing me luck.
I'm doomed.

474
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:10,093
Five feet down to the sewer,
20 yards straight ahead to the manhole.

475
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:12,262
Right.

476
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:16,516
What I wanna know is
what the hell is the difference between this

477
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:20,604
-and what I was gonna do 10 minutes ago?
-No difference.

478
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:23,315
But you stopped me then. Why not now?

479
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,488
One thing, when you get out of here,

480
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:34,409
make sure you call the cops
before you take off for the border, huh?

481
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:37,454
Now, what makes you think I'd do that?

482
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,124
I'll see you, Wilson.

483
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:35,804
That basement's not a bad place to be
if they come at us again.

484
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:38,515
The only way in is down
that long, narrow hallway.

485
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:41,643
We might be able to hold them back
for a couple of minutes.

486
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,311
We'd be trapped down there.

487
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:46,857
But we're not gonna last up here
with only eight shots between us.

488
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:49,985
The upstairs is out. Wide open up there.

489
01:14:55,241 --> 01:15:01,538
-Someone will come.
-A man with faith, a rare quality.

490
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:06,585
What about you?

491
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:09,963
I've never had too much faith
in anyone coming to my rescue.

492
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:12,883
Maybe you've been associating
with the wrong people.

493
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:19,431
-I've been with policemen for five years.
-That's enough to grow hair on a rock.

494
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:24,019
-And you?
-I believe in one man.

495
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,896
Hey! He's there!

496
01:15:29,317 --> 01:15:31,151
It's still clear. Move.

497
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:39,951
What the hell is he waiting for?

498
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:42,662
He's clear in front.

499
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,458
Move, damn it!

500
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,588
He's out.

501
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:03,183
Go, you son of a bitch.

502
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:10,398
They've seen him.

503
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:15,987
Save it for us.

504
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,337
He made it. He made it!

505
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:48,436
-Go, go.
-Hit it, hit it!

506
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:53,233
He's gonna make it.

507
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:15,088
Maybe it was just a window breaking.

508
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:24,139
Sons of bitches.

509
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:32,731
Too bad, Wells.
He never got to see the border.

510
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:41,448
We'd better get down in that basement.
Look, we're out of time, out of ammunition.

511
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:44,993
Just like Wells, we're out of luck.
Take a look.

512
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,920
Let's go.

513
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:52,977
We can make one last stand.

514
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:55,563
Take that sign,
put it down the end of the hallway.

515
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:58,566
It'll help us stand them off.

516
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:02,487
-What do we use to hold them back with?
-Anything we can find.

517
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:14,958
-You still have the gun?
-Two shots. Do I save it for the two of us?

518
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:18,753
You save them for the first two assholes
who come through that vent.

519
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:22,757
They're bound to have seen Wells
come up out of the manhole.

520
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:26,052
What do I use on the rest of them
that come climbing through?

521
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:29,222
Then you'll have to wing it.

522
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:34,436
None of us know who he is,
what happened to him, or what he's done.

523
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,022
He could be anybody or anything.

524
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:42,402
-I'm curious about one thing.
-Just one?

525
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:48,283
No, there are other things, but at
the moment this one interests me the most.

526
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:51,619
-What's that?
-Why didn't you climb through that vent

527
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:54,747
and take off down the sewer
in the other direction?

528
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:57,292
There are two things
a man should never run from,

529
01:19:57,376 --> 01:20:00,086
even if they cost him his life.

530
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:04,132
One is a man who's helpless
and can't run with you.

531
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:05,884
What's the other?

532
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:11,931
Come here a minute, Wilson.

533
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:18,188
The very least of our problems
is we've run out of time.

534
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:23,526
It's an old story with me.
I was born out of time.

535
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:40,001
Acetylene tank, magnesium flares.

536
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:44,756
We strap the flares onto the tank
then tie them both up on that pipe.

537
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:49,594
I stand in the doorway with my rifle.
I shoot the flares, they ignite the tank.

538
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:54,974
We blow the hell out of
everybody in this hallway!

539
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:58,978
And what's gonna keep it
from blowing the hell out of us?

540
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:02,440
You hold up that sign
in front of the door for cover.

541
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:08,613
-Can you hit it from there?
-I got three shots. That's enough.

542
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:14,536
-Can't argue with a confident man.
-Let's go.

543
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:29,008
This is Unit Seven. We've just checked
the fire lane between Gramercy and Imperial.

544
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:33,429
Dark, quiet and deserted.
Request instructions, over.

545
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:35,807
What are those cars doing over there?

546
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,725
There's supposed to be
a few people on duty.

547
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:40,061
They've been moving things out of there
for the past couple of weeks.

548
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:44,148
They're probably between here
and the new station.

549
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,234
We're wasting time here.

550
01:22:05,296 --> 01:22:08,798
I don't know.
There's something funny back there.

551
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:11,092
One-X-Five,
we have continued reports

552
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,094
of gunfire between Ninth and Warren.

553
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:15,138
How come we don't hear a goddamn thing?

554
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:17,140
Most reports are from residents

555
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:20,476
who are unable to pinpoint
the location of the gunfire.

556
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:24,439
The telephone repair vehicle
is officially reported lost.

557
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:28,151
We are sending four backup units in
to assist you.

558
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:31,613
This is Unit Seven.
Still nothing unusual to report.

559
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:34,616
We cannot locate the source of the gunfire.

560
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:38,036
Repeat request for immediate
helicopter surveillance. Over.

561
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,913
One-X-Five,
as soon as a helicopter is available,

562
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:42,457
we will send it in.

563
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,959
This is Unit Seven, 10-4.

564
01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:49,339
There's something wrong here somewhere.

565
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:54,844
Would you listen to that?
It's starting to rain. Just what we need.

566
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,930
There's something funny
about that old station back there.

567
01:22:58,015 --> 01:23:02,226
Hey, that's not rain. What the hell is that?

568
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:12,236
Jesus Christ.

569
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:21,663
This is Unit Seven, emergency
to all precincts and vehicles.

570
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:23,539
Emergency. Emergency.

571
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:43,559
Molotov cocktails.
They'll set the goddamn place on fire.

572
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:45,019
This is it.

573
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:48,940
Let's go.

574
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:48,583
-Sorry.
-Kind of pretty.

575
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,922
Can I ask you a question?

576
01:24:57,301 --> 01:25:01,262
Being a cop,
I figured you'd get around to it eventually.

577
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:08,144
How did you come to be
named Napoleon Wilson?

578
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:10,146
I'll tell you sometime.

579
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:15,693
-When will you tell me?
-Maybe in a minute or two.

580
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:08,287
Can't argue with a confident man!

581
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:36,208
Anybody got a smoke?

582
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:05,196
We have a stretcher for you, miss.

583
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:09,742
Miss.

584
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:43,985
Get away from him!

585
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:02,628
It would be a privilege
if you'd walk outside with me.

586
01:29:04,548 --> 01:29:06,132
I know it would.

587
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,763
You're pretty fancy, Wilson.
