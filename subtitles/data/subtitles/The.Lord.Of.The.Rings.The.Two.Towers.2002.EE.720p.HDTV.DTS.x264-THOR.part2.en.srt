1
00:00:00,997 --> 00:00:02,277
Let her go.

2
00:00:02,456 --> 00:00:04,449
Let her take the ship into the west.

3
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:07,710
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.

4
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:09,670
There it will be ever green.

5
00:00:11,174 --> 00:00:13,546
But never more than memory.

6
00:00:14,802 --> 00:00:17,839
I will not leave my daughter here to die.

7
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:21,674
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

8
00:00:21,851 --> 00:00:24,177
She belongs with her people.

9
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,503
Nach gwannatha sin?
(Is this how you leave?)

10
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:40,962
Ma nathach hi gwannathach...
(Did you think you could slip away at...)

11
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:43,256
...or minuial archened?
(...at first light unnoticed?)

12
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:47,998
Ú-ethelithon.
(I will not be coming back.)

13
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:50,868
Estelio guru lîn ne dagor.
(You underestimate your skill in battle.)

14
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:52,433
Ethelithach.
(You will come back.)

15
00:00:52,537 --> 00:00:54,570
Ú-bedin o gurth ne dagor.
(It is not of death in battle that I speak.)

16
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:57,177
O man pedich?
(What do you speak of?)

17
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:05,675
Edra le men, men na guil edwen
(You have a chance for another life...)

18
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:12,140
...haer o auth...a nîr a naeth.
(...away from war...grief, despair.)

19
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:14,313
Why are you saying this?

20
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:19,073
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

21
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:23,206
It was a dream, Arwen.

22
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:24,998
Nothing more.

23
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:29,579
I don't believe you.

24
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:40,423
This belongs to you.

25
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:44,762
It was a gift.

26
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,933
Keep it.

27
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:52,641
My lord?

28
00:01:55,447 --> 00:02:00,026
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.

29
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,970
What is it?

30
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,518
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.

31
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,157
Wargs!

32
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,340
A scout!

33
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,179
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

34
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,731
Get them out of here!

35
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,530
All riders to the head of the column.

36
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,194
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

37
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,114
Come on!

38
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:39,437
You must lead the people to
Helm's Deep, and make haste.

39
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,048
- I can fight.
- No!

40
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,801
You must do this, for me.

41
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,390
Follow me!

42
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:57,230
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

43
00:03:57,405 --> 00:04:00,075
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

44
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:14,604
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

45
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:18,982
That one counts as mine!

46
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:37,297
Stinking creature.

47
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:06,429
Aragorn!

48
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:12,604
Aragorn?

49
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,537
Tell me what happened and
I will ease your passing.

50
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:31,117
He's...

51
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,286
...dead.

52
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:36,909
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

53
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:41,810
You lie.

54
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,295
Get the wounded on horses.

55
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,756
The wolves of Isengard will return.

56
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:24,300
Leave the dead.

57
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:33,181
Come.

58
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:44,990
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

59
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:48,029
There it is, Helm's Deep.

60
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:52,408
We're safe!

61
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:56,788
We're safe, my lady.

62
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:58,160
Thank you.

63
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:43,920
- Mama!
- Éothain!

64
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:45,636
Freda!

65
00:09:51,393 --> 00:09:54,228
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

66
00:09:58,067 --> 00:09:59,395
Take it to the caves.

67
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:02,371
Make way for the king!

68
00:10:03,622 --> 00:10:07,235
Make way for Théoden!
Make way for the king!

69
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:18,874
So few...so few of you have returned.

70
00:10:21,632 --> 00:10:23,921
Our people are safe.

71
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:27,799
We have paid for it with many lives.

72
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,182
My lady.

73
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:36,137
Lord Aragorn...

74
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:37,559
...where is he?

75
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,110
He fell.

76
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:06,755
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

77
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:09,846
Bar the gate and set a watch on the surround.

78
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:13,183
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

79
00:11:13,352 --> 00:11:15,974
Get them into the caves.

80
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:21,684
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

81
00:11:23,738 --> 00:11:27,154
<i>Helm's Deep has one weakness.

82
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:29,650
<i>Its outer wall is solid rock...

83
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:32,912
<i>... but for a small culvert at its base...

84
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:35,868
<i>... which is little more than a drain.

85
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:42,875
How? How can fire undo stone?

86
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:47,592
What kind of device could bring down the wall?

87
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:55,222
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.

88
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:58,895
Even if it is breached, it would
take a number beyond reckoning...

89
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,639
...thousands, to storm the Keep.

90
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:03,229
Tens of thousands.

91
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:07,484
But, my lord, there is no such force.

92
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,504
A new power is rising.

93
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:25,674
Its victory is at hand.

94
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:33,425
This night...

95
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:38,181
...the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!

96
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:41,689
March to Helm's Deep!

97
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:45,359
Leave none alive!

98
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:50,357
To war!

99
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:58,750
There will be no dawn for Men.

100
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:17,976
Look. There's smoke to the south.

101
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:21,313
There is always smoke rising...

102
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:25,357
...from Isengard these days.

103
00:13:25,613 --> 00:13:27,190
Isengard?

104
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,280
There was a time...

105
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:33,152
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.

106
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:36,662
But now he has a mind of metal...

107
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,789
...and wheels.

108
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:45,041
He no longer cares for growing things.

109
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:47,007
What is it?

110
00:13:52,015 --> 00:13:54,221
It's Saruman's army.

111
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:55,970
The war has started.

112
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:38,644
<i>May the grace of the Valar protect you.

113
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:12,803
Brego.

114
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,114
Arwen.

115
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:43,554
Tollen i lû.
(It is time.)

116
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:47,362
I chair gwannar na Valannor.
(The ships are leaving for Valinor.)

117
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:49,248
Si bado, no círar.
Go now...before it is too late.

118
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:51,760
I have made my choice.

119
00:15:58,186 --> 00:16:01,176
He is not coming back.

120
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,868
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?

121
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:09,779
There is still hope.

122
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:18,121
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.

123
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:24,064
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...

124
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:26,662
...and all that you hope for comes true...

125
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:31,624
...you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.

126
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:34,846
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...

127
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,933
...Aragorn will die.

128
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:43,344
<i>And there will be no comfort for you...

129
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:47,734
<i>...no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.

130
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:53,283
<i>He wlll come to death...

131
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:56,024
<i>...an image of the splendor of the Kings of Men...

132
00:16:56,203 --> 00:17:00,865
<i>...in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.

133
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:13,917
<i>But you, my daughter...

134
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:19,764
<i>...you will linger on in darkness and in doubt...

135
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:24,016
<i>...as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.

136
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:28,809
<i>Here you will dwell...

137
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:33,898
<i>...bound to your grief under the fading trees...

138
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,611
<i>...until all the world is changed...

139
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:42,284
<i>...and the long </i>years of your life are utterly spent.

140
00:17:50,843 --> 00:17:52,005
Arwen.

141
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:00,931
There is nothing for you here...

142
00:18:01,604 --> 00:18:03,680
...only death.

143
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:27,627
A im ú-'erin veleth lîn?
(Do I not also have your love?)

144
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,121
Gerich meleth nîn, ada.
(You have my love, father.)

145
00:19:21,903 --> 00:19:25,513
<i>I amar prestar aen.
(The world is changed.)

146
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,846
<i>Han mathon ne nen.
(I feel it in the water.)

147
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,766
<i>Han mathon ne chae,
(I feel it in the earth,)

148
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:36,710
<i>a han noston ned 'wilith.
(and I smell it in the air.)

149
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:40,737
<i>The power of the enemy is growing.

150
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:43,535
<i>Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...

151
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:47,160
<i>...to destroy the people of Rohan.

152
00:19:49,214 --> 00:19:52,879
<i>Isengard has been unleashed.

153
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,550
<i>The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...

154
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:04,686
<i>...the last free Kingdom of Men.

155
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:09,232
<i>His war on this country will come swiftly.

156
00:20:12,947 --> 00:20:16,067
<i>He senses the Ring is close.

157
00:20:16,242 --> 00:20:19,693
<i>The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.

158
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,915
<i>In his heart, Frodo begins to understand...

159
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:29,327
...the quest will claim his life.

160
00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:31,664
You know this.

161
00:20:32,258 --> 00:20:35,093
<i>You have foreseen it.

162
00:20:37,222 --> 00:20:40,673
<i>It is the risk we all took.

163
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:49,274
<i>In the gathering dark, the
will of the Ring grows strong.

164
00:20:50,443 --> 00:20:54,856
<i>It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.

165
00:20:55,031 --> 00:21:00,488
<i>Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.

166
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:04,287
<i>The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand...

167
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:08,538
<i>...take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.

168
00:21:10,964 --> 00:21:12,791
<i>It is close now.

169
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:17,214
<i>So close to achieving its goal.

170
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:23,973
<i>For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth...

171
00:21:24,145 --> 00:21:28,273
<i>...even unto to the ending of the world.

172
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:31,936
<i>The time of the Elves...

173
00:21:32,153 --> 00:21:34,062
<i>...is over.

174
00:21:34,906 --> 00:21:38,488
<i>Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?

175
00:21:40,453 --> 00:21:43,703
<i>Do we let them stand alone?

176
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:49,664
What news?

177
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:52,673
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.

178
00:21:52,841 --> 00:21:55,676
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.

179
00:21:55,844 --> 00:21:59,889
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

180
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:02,464
Sauron is marshaling an army.

181
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:04,932
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.

182
00:22:05,103 --> 00:22:08,519
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

183
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:13,191
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

184
00:22:13,362 --> 00:22:16,398
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.

185
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:20,692
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

186
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:23,574
Sauron from Mordor.

187
00:22:24,873 --> 00:22:28,124
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.

188
00:22:28,294 --> 00:22:30,002
Gondor is weak.

189
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:33,290
Sauron will strike us soon.

190
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,876
And he will strike hard.

191
00:22:36,344 --> 00:22:40,424
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.

192
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:56,568
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

193
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:59,491
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

194
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:01,901
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?

195
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:10,537
Speak.

196
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,251
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

197
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:17,592
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.

198
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:19,553
Your bodyguard?

199
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:21,513
His gardener.

200
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:24,091
And where is your skulking friend?

201
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:27,928
That gangrel creature.

202
00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:30,229
He had an ill-favored look.

203
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:33,851
There was no other.

204
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:40,274
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.

205
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:46,705
One we lost in Moria...

206
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,286
...two were my kin...

207
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,209
...a Dwarf there was also and an Elf and two Men.

208
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:57,295
Aragorn, son of Arathorn and Boromir of Gondor.

209
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,050
You're a friend of Boromir?

210
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:07,972
Yes.

211
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:10,143
For my part.

212
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,609
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.

213
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,119
Dead?

214
00:24:23,286 --> 00:24:25,326
How? When?

215
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:28,250
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

216
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:32,374
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

217
00:24:35,132 --> 00:24:41,585
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.

218
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:44,890
It was cloven in two.

219
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,976
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

220
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,816
He was my brother.

221
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:45,738
Boromir!

222
00:25:46,246 --> 00:25:48,120
Boromir!

223
00:25:52,378 --> 00:25:56,126
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.

224
00:25:56,298 --> 00:25:59,964
A place of light and beauty and music.

225
00:26:00,136 --> 00:26:02,461
And so it shall be once more!

226
00:26:05,016 --> 00:26:07,685
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

227
00:26:07,852 --> 00:26:12,229
Never again will the land of my
people fall into enemy hands.

228
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:20,092
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed.

229
00:26:20,248 --> 00:26:24,158
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

230
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:29,007
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

231
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:38,507
Good speech. Nice and short.

232
00:26:38,675 --> 00:26:41,593
Leaves more time for drinking!

233
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:46,134
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

234
00:26:49,603 --> 00:26:51,762
Remember today, little brother.

235
00:26:51,939 --> 00:26:54,940
Today, life is good.

236
00:26:59,113 --> 00:27:00,690
What?

237
00:27:01,073 --> 00:27:02,532
He's here.

238
00:27:02,896 --> 00:27:04,877
Well done men...

239
00:27:05,745 --> 00:27:08,781
- Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
- Where is he?

240
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:12,408
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

241
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,668
Father!

242
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:21,881
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.

243
00:27:22,053 --> 00:27:25,469
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

244
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:29,851
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.

245
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:32,934
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

246
00:27:33,106 --> 00:27:35,146
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.

247
00:27:35,317 --> 00:27:37,025
Oh, too few.

248
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:39,899
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.

249
00:27:42,115 --> 00:27:45,200
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

250
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:47,610
That is not my intent.

251
00:27:47,788 --> 00:27:51,536
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.

252
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,838
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

253
00:27:58,006 --> 00:28:00,758
...I know his uses, and they are few.

254
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:04,544
We have more urgent things to speak of.

255
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:08,130
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

256
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:11,179
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.

257
00:28:11,354 --> 00:28:15,138
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.

258
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,648
The One Ring.

259
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:27,069
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

260
00:28:27,245 --> 00:28:30,863
Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, Wizards.

261
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,169
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

262
00:28:36,963 --> 00:28:39,632
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

263
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:43,500
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men. But you!...

264
00:28:43,678 --> 00:28:47,628
You are strong.
And our need is great.

265
00:28:47,808 --> 00:28:53,098
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.

266
00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:58,349
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

267
00:28:58,527 --> 00:29:00,021
He will return.

268
00:29:00,195 --> 00:29:03,944
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.

269
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:06,654
You must go.

270
00:29:07,828 --> 00:29:09,951
Bring me back this mighty gift.

271
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:16,294
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

272
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:20,127
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

273
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:23,300
...send me in his stead.
- You?

274
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,379
Oh, I see.

275
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:30,767
A chance for Faramir, captain of
Gondor, to show his quality.

276
00:29:31,185 --> 00:29:33,178
I think not.

277
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,225
I trust this mission only to your brother.

278
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,317
The one who will not fail me.

279
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,628
Remember today, little brother.

280
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,976
Captain Faramir!

281
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:23,360
<i>We found the third one.

282
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,868
You must come with me. Now.

283
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,212
Down there.

284
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:06,985
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

285
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:19,080
They wait for my command.

286
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:25,672
Shall I shoot?

287
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:29,930
<i>The rock and pool
Is nice and cool

288
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:31,926
<i>So juicy sweet

289
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:35,555
<i>Our only wish
To catch a fish

290
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,434
<i>So juicy sweet

291
00:31:45,448 --> 00:31:46,823
Wait.

292
00:31:48,326 --> 00:31:51,161
This creature is bound to me.

293
00:31:51,788 --> 00:31:53,697
And I to him.

294
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,288
He is our guide.

295
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:04,418
Please...

296
00:32:04,592 --> 00:32:06,466
...let me go down to him.

297
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:19,391
Sméagol.

298
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,642
Master is here.

299
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:24,983
Come, Sméagol.

300
00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:30,494
Trust master. Come.

301
00:32:33,664 --> 00:32:37,496
We must go now?

302
00:32:37,835 --> 00:32:41,286
Sméagol, you must trust master.

303
00:32:41,464 --> 00:32:42,839
Follow me. Come on.

304
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,674
Come.

305
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:49,341
Come, Sméagol.

306
00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:51,923
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

307
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:53,975
Come on.

308
00:32:58,356 --> 00:33:00,016
Don't hurt him!

309
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:02,943
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

310
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:04,391
Master!

311
00:33:29,596 --> 00:33:31,968
That's enough.

312
00:33:35,602 --> 00:33:37,761
Where are you leading them?

313
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:41,225
Answer me.

314
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:45,271
Sméagol.

315
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:53,486
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

316
00:33:54,747 --> 00:33:57,368
Cruel Men hurts us.

317
00:33:57,542 --> 00:34:00,543
Master tricksed us.

318
00:34:00,711 --> 00:34:04,246
Of course he did.

319
00:34:04,632 --> 00:34:08,333
I told you he was tricksy.

320
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:11,548
I told you he was false.

321
00:34:11,723 --> 00:34:14,428
Master is our friend.

322
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:16,926
Our friend.

323
00:34:17,103 --> 00:34:19,262
Master betrayed us.

324
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:22,440
No. Not its business.

325
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:25,934
Leave us alone!

326
00:34:26,113 --> 00:34:28,520
Filthy little Hobbitses!

327
00:34:28,698 --> 00:34:30,987
They stole it from us!

328
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,618
No. No.

329
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:34,786
What did they steal?

330
00:34:36,957 --> 00:34:42,296
My precious!

331
00:34:45,966 --> 00:34:47,626
We have to get out of here.

332
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:50,176
You go. Go, now.

333
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:54,633
You can do it.

334
00:34:56,102 --> 00:34:57,560
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

335
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,520
Just this once.

336
00:34:59,689 --> 00:35:01,480
Put it on.

337
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,939
Disappear.

338
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:06,065
I can't.

339
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:11,363
You were right, Sam.

340
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:15,318
You tried to tell me but...

341
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:22,160
I'm sorry.

342
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:29,587
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

343
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:32,672
If I put it on...

344
00:35:32,848 --> 00:35:35,173
...he'll find me.

345
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:38,809
He'll see.

346
00:35:40,022 --> 00:35:42,014
Mr. Frodo...

347
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:51,192
So this is the answer to all the riddles.

348
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,411
Here in the Wild I have you...

349
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,489
...two Halflings...

350
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:01,832
...and a host of men at my call.

351
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:08,630
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

352
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:22,059
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor...

353
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,686
...to show his quality.

354
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:49,424
No!

355
00:36:52,596 --> 00:36:53,924
Stop it!

356
00:36:54,097 --> 00:36:55,129
Leave him alone.

357
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:58,966
Don't you understand?

358
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,180
He's got to destroy it!

359
00:37:02,356 --> 00:37:05,606
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

360
00:37:05,776 --> 00:37:07,436
To the Mountain of Fire!

361
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:11,607
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

362
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:14,783
Please. It's such a burden.

363
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:19,030
Will you not help him?

364
00:37:20,374 --> 00:37:22,284
Captain?

365
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,167
Prepare to leave.

366
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:32,542
The Ring will go to Gondor.

367
00:38:33,082 --> 00:38:37,879
Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.
(Well done, Brego, my friend.)

368
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:48,214
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

369
00:38:48,381 --> 00:38:51,418
Get out of the way!
I'm gonna kill him!

370
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:55,377
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

371
00:38:55,555 --> 00:38:59,553
...and the most reckless man I ever knew.

372
00:39:00,227 --> 00:39:01,721
Bless you, laddie.

373
00:39:02,312 --> 00:39:04,056
Gimli, where is the king?

374
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:14,104
Le abdollen.
(You're late.)

375
00:39:17,828 --> 00:39:19,157
You look terrible.

376
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:48,159
Hannon le.
(Thank you.)

377
00:40:00,914 --> 00:40:02,953
A great host, you say

378
00:40:03,124 --> 00:40:05,794
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

379
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:09,462
Ten thousand strong at least.

380
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,466
Ten thousand?

381
00:40:12,884 --> 00:40:15,376
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

382
00:40:18,056 --> 00:40:20,179
To destroy the world of Men.

383
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,679
They will be here by nightfall.

384
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,808
Let them come!

385
00:40:33,322 --> 00:40:36,109
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms...

386
00:40:36,283 --> 00:40:39,403
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

387
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,588
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.

388
00:40:50,757 --> 00:40:53,164
No army has ever breached the deeping wall...

389
00:40:53,343 --> 00:40:56,094
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

390
00:40:56,262 --> 00:40:58,670
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

391
00:40:59,265 --> 00:41:01,472
These are Uruk-hai.

392
00:41:01,643 --> 00:41:05,059
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.

393
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:10,355
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.

394
00:41:10,527 --> 00:41:14,145
I know how to defend my own keep.

395
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:24,162
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.

396
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:29,540
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

397
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:32,424
Crops can be resown...

398
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:35,592
...homes rebuilt.

399
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,758
Within these walls...

400
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,634
...we will outlast them.

401
00:41:40,808 --> 00:41:43,216
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.

402
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:44,936
They come to destroy its people...

403
00:41:45,104 --> 00:41:47,595
...down to the last child.

404
00:41:48,482 --> 00:41:50,724
What would you have me do?

405
00:41:50,902 --> 00:41:52,645
Look at my men.

406
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,564
Their courage hangs by a thread.

407
00:41:56,741 --> 00:42:01,154
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end...

408
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:04,365
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

409
00:42:08,002 --> 00:42:09,912
Send out riders, my lord.

410
00:42:10,213 --> 00:42:13,084
You must call for aid.

411
00:42:16,344 --> 00:42:18,586
And who will come?

412
00:42:19,014 --> 00:42:20,591
Elves?

413
00:42:20,766 --> 00:42:22,842
Dwarves?

414
00:42:23,602 --> 00:42:26,472
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.

415
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:29,603
The old alliances are dead.

416
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:32,812
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

417
00:42:32,986 --> 00:42:35,193
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?!

418
00:42:36,156 --> 00:42:39,406
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?!

419
00:42:39,576 --> 00:42:41,486
Where was Gon...?

420
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:46,122
No, my Lord Aragorn...

421
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:50,165
...we are alone.

422
00:42:57,053 --> 00:42:58,796
Get the women and children into the caves.

423
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:00,216
We need more time to lay provisions...

424
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:03,889
There is no time. War is upon us.

425
00:43:04,143 --> 00:43:05,851
Secure the gate.

426
00:43:11,067 --> 00:43:13,143
We Ents have not troubled...

427
00:43:13,361 --> 00:43:16,730
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

428
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:20,491
...for a very long time.

429
00:43:21,745 --> 00:43:26,490
But now, something is about to happen...

430
00:43:26,666 --> 00:43:28,992
...that has not happened...

431
00:43:29,211 --> 00:43:31,666
...for an age.

432
00:43:32,881 --> 00:43:35,123
Entmoot.

433
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,582
What's that?

434
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,846
'Tis a gathering.

435
00:43:41,014 --> 00:43:43,588
A gathering of what?

436
00:44:01,535 --> 00:44:03,861
Beech. Oak.

437
00:44:04,038 --> 00:44:05,947
Chestnut. Ash.

438
00:44:06,207 --> 00:44:08,200
Good. Good. Good.

439
00:44:08,376 --> 00:44:10,701
Many have come.

440
00:44:18,261 --> 00:44:21,048
Now we must decide if the Ents...

441
00:44:21,222 --> 00:44:23,760
...will go to war.

442
00:44:32,734 --> 00:44:35,771
Move back! Move to the caves!

443
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,316
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

444
00:44:40,742 --> 00:44:43,031
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

445
00:44:43,203 --> 00:44:45,492
They can support the archers from above the gate.

446
00:44:45,664 --> 00:44:48,784
Aragorn, you must rest.

447
00:44:48,959 --> 00:44:51,367
You're no use to us half alive.

448
00:44:51,837 --> 00:44:53,035
Aragorn!

449
00:44:56,425 --> 00:44:59,461
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.

450
00:44:59,637 --> 00:45:01,297
That is an honorable charge.

451
00:45:01,472 --> 00:45:04,342
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.

452
00:45:04,517 --> 00:45:06,225
What renown is there in that?

453
00:45:06,394 --> 00:45:10,094
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.

454
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:13,143
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?

455
00:45:13,317 --> 00:45:18,312
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

456
00:45:18,614 --> 00:45:21,450
You do not command the others to stay!

457
00:45:21,617 --> 00:45:25,366
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.

458
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:28,746
Because they love you.

459
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,383
I'm sorry.

460
00:46:43,213 --> 00:46:46,498
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

461
00:46:47,592 --> 00:46:49,383
These are no soldiers.

462
00:46:51,638 --> 00:46:55,137
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

463
00:46:59,062 --> 00:47:01,980
Look at them. They're frightened.

464
00:47:02,149 --> 00:47:03,607
I can see it in their eyes.

465
00:47:08,694 --> 00:47:10,815
Boe a hyn
(And they should be)

466
00:47:10,991 --> 00:47:14,111
Neled herain...dan caer menig
(300...against 10,000!)

467
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:16,619
Si beriathar hyn
(They have more hope of...)

468
00:47:16,723 --> 00:47:18,099
ammaeg na ned Edoras.
(...defending themselves here than at Edoras...)

469
00:47:18,204 --> 00:47:22,169
Aragorn nedin dagor hen ú-'erir ortheri.
(Aragorn, they cannot win this fight.)

470
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:24,367
Natha daged dhaer.
(They are all going to die!)

471
00:47:24,547 --> 00:47:26,753
Then I shall die as one of them!

472
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,007
Let him go, lad.

473
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,557
Let him be.

474
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:44,524
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.

475
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,689
My lord?

476
00:47:52,742 --> 00:47:55,316
Who am I, Gamling?

477
00:47:58,707 --> 00:48:02,574
You are our king, sire.

478
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:08,874
And do you trust your king?

479
00:48:10,385 --> 00:48:13,552
Your men, my lord...

480
00:48:13,722 --> 00:48:16,557
...will follow you to whatever end.

481
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:25,308
To whatever end.

482
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:38,743
Where is the horse and the rider?

483
00:48:38,914 --> 00:48:41,951
Where is the horn that was blowing?

484
00:48:43,461 --> 00:48:47,922
<i>They have passed like rain on the mountains.

485
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:52,128
<i>Like wind in the meadow.

486
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:59,591
The days have gone down in the West...

487
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,939
<i>... behind the hills...

488
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,441
<i>...into Shadow.

489
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,326
How did it come to this?

490
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,470
It's been going for hours.

491
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,054
They must have decided something by now.

492
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:49,313
Decided? No.

493
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:54,647
We only just finished saying...

494
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,700
...good morning.

495
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:02,241
But it's nighttime already.

496
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,208
You can't take forever.

497
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:07,287
Don't be hasty.

498
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:10,121
We're running out of time!

499
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:16,090
Move! Move to the outer wall.

500
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:34,985
Give me your sword.

501
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,658
What is your name?

502
00:50:46,212 --> 00:50:48,537
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

503
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:53,338
The men are saying we will not live out the night.

504
00:50:55,304 --> 00:50:57,261
They say that it is hopeless.

505
00:51:15,074 --> 00:51:16,734
This is a good sword.

506
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:21,070
Haleth, son of Háma...

507
00:51:25,418 --> 00:51:27,577
...there is always hope.

508
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:53,938
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

509
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:55,657
Forgive me.

510
00:51:55,825 --> 00:51:57,283
I was wrong to despair.

511
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:02,945
Ú-moe edhored, Legolas.
(There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.)

512
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,296
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

513
00:52:12,717 --> 00:52:14,793
It's a little tight across the chest.

514
00:52:20,975 --> 00:52:22,933
That is no Orc horn.

515
00:52:28,608 --> 00:52:30,435
Send for the king.

516
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:34,193
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

517
00:53:05,855 --> 00:53:07,515
How is this possible?

518
00:53:08,524 --> 00:53:12,189
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

519
00:53:12,361 --> 00:53:15,565
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.

520
00:53:16,282 --> 00:53:20,529
Long ago we fought and died together.

521
00:53:22,789 --> 00:53:25,706
We come to honor that allegiance.

522
00:53:26,081 --> 00:53:27,957
Mae govannen, Haldir!
(Well met, Haldir!)

523
00:53:34,175 --> 00:53:36,085
You are most welcome.

524
00:53:41,474 --> 00:53:45,140
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.

525
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:22,305
You could have picked a better spot.

526
00:54:27,146 --> 00:54:31,358
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.

527
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:39,282
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

528
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,400
Let's hope they last the night.

529
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:46,139
A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn...
(Show them no mercy...)

530
00:55:47,145 --> 00:55:49,434
...an uben tanatha le faelas.
(...for you shall receive none!)

531
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:26,684
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

532
00:56:27,937 --> 00:56:29,728
Or would you like me to find you a box?

533
00:57:09,146 --> 00:57:10,426
Dartho!
(Hold!)

534
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,747
So it begins.

535
00:57:40,636 --> 00:57:41,799
Tangado a chadad!
(Prepare to fire!)

536
00:57:42,737 --> 00:57:44,927
<i>Tangado a chadad!
(Prepare to fire!)

537
00:57:50,153 --> 00:57:52,603
Faeg i-varv...
Their armour is weak at the neck...

538
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:54,741
...dîn na lanc a nu ranc.
(...and beneath the arm.)

539
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,878
Leithio i philinn!
(Fire the arrows!)

540
00:58:01,616 --> 00:58:02,944
Did they hit anything?

541
00:58:03,618 --> 00:58:05,611
Give them a volley.

542
00:58:05,787 --> 00:58:08,953
- Fire!
- Fire!

543
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:16,587
Tengado chadad!
(Keep firing!)

544
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:25,299
Send them to me! Come on!

545
00:58:44,845 --> 00:58:45,887
Pendraith!
(Ladders!)

546
00:58:46,078 --> 00:58:47,157
Good!

547
00:58:53,961 --> 00:58:56,962
Swords! Swords!

548
00:59:35,045 --> 00:59:37,168
Legolas! Two already!

549
00:59:37,339 --> 00:59:39,462
I'm on 17!

550
00:59:39,633 --> 00:59:42,207
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

551
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,726
19!

552
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,124
Merry.

553
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:26,336
We have just agreed.

554
01:00:36,358 --> 01:00:37,817
Yes?

555
01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:43,483
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

556
01:00:44,616 --> 01:00:47,867
...and we have agreed...

557
01:00:48,328 --> 01:00:52,373
...you are not Orcs.

558
01:00:54,126 --> 01:00:56,249
Well, that's good news.

559
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:00,548
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

560
01:01:01,175 --> 01:01:04,959
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

561
01:01:05,137 --> 01:01:06,680
Hasty?

562
01:01:07,473 --> 01:01:09,347
Our friends are out there.

563
01:01:09,517 --> 01:01:13,681
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.

564
01:01:14,021 --> 01:01:16,310
War? Yes.

565
01:01:16,482 --> 01:01:18,356
It affects us all.

566
01:01:18,526 --> 01:01:21,527
Tree, root and twig.

567
01:01:22,405 --> 01:01:26,450
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

568
01:01:26,659 --> 01:01:28,569
...it takes a long time...

569
01:01:28,745 --> 01:01:33,656
...to say anything in Old Entish...

570
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:38,045
...and we never say anything...

571
01:01:38,213 --> 01:01:42,127
...unless it is worth taking...

572
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:46,345
...a long time to say.

573
01:01:47,115 --> 01:01:50,347
17! 18!

574
01:01:50,452 --> 01:01:51,703
19!

575
01:01:52,172 --> 01:01:53,997
20!

576
01:01:54,205 --> 01:01:55,978
21!

577
01:01:56,395 --> 01:02:00,149
<i>22 and 23!

578
01:02:06,033 --> 01:02:08,026
Causeway!

579
01:02:15,793 --> 01:02:18,165
Is this it?

580
01:02:18,337 --> 01:02:21,255
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

581
01:02:47,659 --> 01:02:49,034
Togo han dad, Legolas!
(Bring him down, Legolas!)

582
01:02:52,372 --> 01:02:53,202
Dago hon!
(Kill him!)

583
01:02:53,373 --> 01:02:54,893
Dago hon!
(Kill him!)

584
01:03:47,262 --> 01:03:48,637
Brace the gate!

585
01:04:06,949 --> 01:04:09,191
Hold them! Stand firm!

586
01:04:17,084 --> 01:04:18,413
Aragorn!

587
01:04:23,056 --> 01:04:24,247
Gimli!

588
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:32,597
Hado i philinn!
(Hurl the arrows!)

589
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,926
Herio!
(Charge!)

590
01:05:13,016 --> 01:05:16,931
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

591
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:21,727
We must weather such things as we have always done.

592
01:05:22,568 --> 01:05:24,644
How can that be your decision?!

593
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:28,939
This is not our war.

594
01:05:29,241 --> 01:05:31,448
But you're part of this world!

595
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:37,408
Aren't you?!

596
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:43,876
You must help. Please.

597
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:47,926
You must do something.

598
01:05:48,219 --> 01:05:52,513
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

599
01:05:53,725 --> 01:05:57,425
But your part in this tale is over.

600
01:05:57,604 --> 01:05:59,846
Go back to your home.

601
01:06:09,866 --> 01:06:12,108
Maybe Treebeard's right.

602
01:06:12,285 --> 01:06:14,159
We don't belong here, Merry.

603
01:06:14,329 --> 01:06:16,618
It's too big for us.

604
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:19,459
What can we do in the end?

605
01:06:21,753 --> 01:06:24,375
We've got the Shire.

606
01:06:24,923 --> 01:06:27,461
Maybe we should go home.

607
01:06:29,303 --> 01:06:32,506
The fires of Isengard will spread...

608
01:06:32,681 --> 01:06:37,593
...and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.

609
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,348
And...

610
01:06:41,148 --> 01:06:44,233
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.

611
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,698
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

612
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:11,465
Aragorn!

613
01:07:11,638 --> 01:07:14,010
Fall back to the Keep!

614
01:07:14,182 --> 01:07:17,267
Get your men out of there!

615
01:07:18,395 --> 01:07:19,889
Am Marad!
(To the Keep!)

616
01:07:24,735 --> 01:07:26,359
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!)

617
01:07:26,904 --> 01:07:28,564
Haldir!

618
01:07:29,364 --> 01:07:30,823
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!)

619
01:07:32,701 --> 01:07:35,951
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

620
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:38,308
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!)

621
01:07:55,183 --> 01:07:57,423
Haldir!

622
01:08:39,103 --> 01:08:40,597
Brace the gate!

623
01:08:42,815 --> 01:08:44,095
Hold them!

624
01:08:45,943 --> 01:08:49,312
To the gate. Draw your swords!

625
01:09:17,475 --> 01:09:19,384
Make way!

626
01:09:22,313 --> 01:09:24,021
We cannot hold much longer!

627
01:09:29,988 --> 01:09:33,571
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

628
01:09:33,742 --> 01:09:36,315
As long as you can give me.

629
01:09:36,495 --> 01:09:38,155
Gimli!

630
01:09:39,623 --> 01:09:40,998
Timbers!

631
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:43,123
Brace the gate!

632
01:09:57,892 --> 01:09:59,600
Come on. We can take them.

633
01:10:00,436 --> 01:10:02,060
It's a long way.

634
01:10:07,318 --> 01:10:09,061
Toss me.

635
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:12,064
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

636
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,817
You'll have to toss me!

637
01:10:19,414 --> 01:10:20,694
Don't tell the Elf.

638
01:10:21,207 --> 01:10:22,999
Not a word.

639
01:10:38,225 --> 01:10:39,683
Shore up the door!

640
01:10:39,851 --> 01:10:41,927
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

641
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:43,183
Watch our backs!

642
01:10:47,317 --> 01:10:49,559
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

643
01:11:39,496 --> 01:11:40,907
Hold fast the gate!

644
01:11:45,126 --> 01:11:48,081
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

645
01:11:52,801 --> 01:11:54,426
Aragorn!

646
01:12:27,837 --> 01:12:30,293
Pull everybody back.

647
01:12:30,673 --> 01:12:32,465
Pull them back.

648
01:12:33,009 --> 01:12:34,468
Fall back!

649
01:12:34,636 --> 01:12:37,127
Fall back!

650
01:12:38,306 --> 01:12:40,014
They have broken through!

651
01:12:40,183 --> 01:12:42,425
The castle is breached. Retreat!

652
01:12:42,602 --> 01:12:44,844
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

653
01:12:45,021 --> 01:12:47,595
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

654
01:12:47,774 --> 01:12:50,016
Into the Keep!

655
01:13:01,496 --> 01:13:06,455
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.

656
01:13:06,627 --> 01:13:11,336
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.

657
01:13:17,054 --> 01:13:18,334
Wait! Stop!

658
01:13:19,223 --> 01:13:20,717
Stop!

659
01:13:23,853 --> 01:13:25,561
Turn around.

660
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,185
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

661
01:13:29,358 --> 01:13:34,353
But that will lead you past Isengard.

662
01:13:34,697 --> 01:13:37,402
Yes. Exactly.

663
01:13:37,575 --> 01:13:40,778
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.

664
01:13:40,953 --> 01:13:43,623
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.

665
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,782
It's the last thing he'll expect.

666
01:13:48,419 --> 01:13:51,420
That doesn't make sense to me.

667
01:13:51,589 --> 01:13:52,752
But then...

668
01:13:52,924 --> 01:13:55,629
...you are very small.

669
01:13:56,094 --> 01:13:57,885
Perhaps you're right.

670
01:14:00,515 --> 01:14:02,057
South it is, then.

671
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,894
Hold on, little Shirelings.

672
01:14:08,941 --> 01:14:11,692
I always like going south.

673
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:16,154
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

674
01:14:16,782 --> 01:14:19,238
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

675
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:21,319
No, we won't.

676
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:24,321
Not this time.

677
01:14:30,963 --> 01:14:31,994
Look!

678
01:14:33,632 --> 01:14:36,088
Osgiliath burns!

679
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:37,671
<i>Mordor has come.

680
01:14:38,804 --> 01:14:41,212
The Ring will not save Gondor.

681
01:14:42,558 --> 01:14:44,765
It has only the power to destroy.

682
01:14:45,645 --> 01:14:47,104
Please...

683
01:14:47,271 --> 01:14:48,896
...let me go.

684
01:14:49,941 --> 01:14:51,519
Hurry.

685
01:14:54,988 --> 01:14:56,399
Faramir!

686
01:14:56,573 --> 01:14:59,064
You must let me go!

687
01:14:59,492 --> 01:15:02,944
And those little family of field mice...

688
01:15:03,121 --> 01:15:05,956
...that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.

689
01:15:06,666 --> 01:15:10,000
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...

690
01:15:21,181 --> 01:15:24,099
Many of these trees were my friends.

691
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:29,833
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.

692
01:15:30,608 --> 01:15:31,806
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

693
01:15:31,984 --> 01:15:34,736
They had voices of their own.

694
01:15:36,989 --> 01:15:39,527
Saruman.

695
01:15:39,867 --> 01:15:42,951
A wizard should know better!

696
01:15:57,218 --> 01:16:01,063
There is no curse in Elvish...

697
01:16:01,167 --> 01:16:03,725
...Entish or the tongues of Men...

698
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:06,217
...for this treachery.

699
01:16:07,645 --> 01:16:10,481
Look! The trees! They're moving!

700
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:16,393
Where are they going?

701
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:20,155
They have business with the Orcs.

702
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:24,911
My business is with Isengard tonight...

703
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,701
...with rock and stone.

704
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:55,650
- Yes.
- Rárum-rum! Come, my friends.

705
01:16:56,612 --> 01:17:00,824
The Ents are going to war.

706
01:17:00,992 --> 01:17:02,783
It is likely...

707
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:06,452
...that we go to our doom.

708
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:10,329
Last march...

709
01:17:10,877 --> 01:17:12,917
...of the Ents.

710
01:18:01,012 --> 01:18:04,760
Faramir! The Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.

711
01:18:04,932 --> 01:18:07,008
By nightfall we will be overrun.

712
01:18:09,771 --> 01:18:11,229
Mr. Frodo?

713
01:18:11,522 --> 01:18:15,651
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

714
01:18:15,818 --> 01:18:18,310
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

715
01:18:32,627 --> 01:18:34,038
Take them to my father.

716
01:18:35,589 --> 01:18:38,590
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

717
01:18:41,011 --> 01:18:44,047
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.

718
01:18:45,224 --> 01:18:47,893
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?

719
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,312
You want to know why your brother died?

720
01:18:51,814 --> 01:18:55,562
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

721
01:18:55,734 --> 01:18:57,608
He tried to kill him!

722
01:18:57,778 --> 01:19:00,103
The Ring drove your brother mad!

723
01:19:00,906 --> 01:19:02,733
Watch out!

724
01:19:13,669 --> 01:19:14,784
Mr. Frodo?

725
01:19:17,423 --> 01:19:19,250
They're here.

726
01:19:22,387 --> 01:19:24,842
They've come.

727
01:19:27,434 --> 01:19:29,307
Nazgûl!

728
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,617
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

729
01:19:55,421 --> 01:19:57,627
Take cover!

730
01:20:14,982 --> 01:20:16,524
The fortress is taken.

731
01:20:17,318 --> 01:20:18,481
It is over.

732
01:20:18,653 --> 01:20:22,603
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.

733
01:20:22,782 --> 01:20:25,699
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

734
01:20:28,454 --> 01:20:29,830
They're breaking in!

735
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,991
<i>They're past the door!

736
01:20:38,339 --> 01:20:42,468
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

737
01:20:45,138 --> 01:20:47,047
Is there no other way?

738
01:20:48,642 --> 01:20:51,678
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

739
01:20:52,354 --> 01:20:54,560
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

740
01:20:59,444 --> 01:21:01,852
Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass.

741
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:04,866
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

742
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:10,452
What can Men do against such reckless hate?

743
01:21:15,127 --> 01:21:16,538
Ride out with me.

744
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:22,299
Ride out and meet them.

745
01:21:23,052 --> 01:21:25,210
For death and glory.

746
01:21:25,388 --> 01:21:26,799
For Rohan.

747
01:21:28,307 --> 01:21:29,766
For your people.

748
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:32,427
The sun is rising.

749
01:21:36,941 --> 01:21:39,942
<i>Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

750
01:21:40,111 --> 01:21:41,522
<i>At dawn...

751
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:43,404
<i>...look to the east.

752
01:21:47,577 --> 01:21:49,237
Yes.

753
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:53,366
Yes.

754
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:57,082
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

755
01:21:57,254 --> 01:22:00,089
...shall sound in the deep...

756
01:22:00,507 --> 01:22:02,500
...one last time.

757
01:22:02,676 --> 01:22:04,170
Yes!

758
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:11,006
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.

759
01:22:18,776 --> 01:22:20,104
Fell deeds, awake.

760
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,435
Now for wrath...

761
01:22:22,613 --> 01:22:25,982
...now for ruin and a red dawn.

762
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,282
Forth Eorlingas!

763
01:23:23,092 --> 01:23:24,337
Gandalf.

764
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,266
Théoden King stands alone.

765
01:23:35,855 --> 01:23:38,013
Not alone.

766
01:23:38,441 --> 01:23:39,555
Rohirrim!

767
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:46,652
Èomer.

768
01:23:46,824 --> 01:23:49,362
To the king!

769
01:25:06,948 --> 01:25:08,739
Yes!

770
01:25:17,876 --> 01:25:21,292
A hit. A fine hit.

771
01:25:45,863 --> 01:25:48,319
Break the dam!

772
01:25:48,491 --> 01:25:51,942
Release the river!

773
01:26:19,272 --> 01:26:22,024
Pippin! Hold on!

774
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,198
Hold on, little Hobbits.

775
01:27:11,576 --> 01:27:13,568
What are you doing?

776
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:23,748
Where are you going?

777
01:28:21,898 --> 01:28:23,226
It's me.

778
01:28:25,735 --> 01:28:27,942
It's your Sam.

779
01:28:32,283 --> 01:28:34,905
Don't you know your Sam?

780
01:28:52,638 --> 01:28:56,007
I can't do this, Sam.

781
01:28:56,892 --> 01:28:58,885
I know.

782
01:28:59,895 --> 01:29:02,267
It's all wrong.

783
01:29:03,023 --> 01:29:05,016
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

784
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:14,526
But we are.

785
01:29:20,958 --> 01:29:23,995
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

786
01:29:24,170 --> 01:29:26,542
The ones that really mattered.

787
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:30,591
<i>Full of darkness and danger they were.

788
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:33,714
<i>And sometimes you didn't want to know the end

789
01:29:33,888 --> 01:29:36,842
<i>...because how could the end be happy?

790
01:29:39,394 --> 01:29:41,600
<i>How could the world go back to the way it was...

791
01:29:41,771 --> 01:29:45,271
<i>... when so much bad had happened?

792
01:29:46,109 --> 01:29:48,018
Victory!

793
01:29:48,195 --> 01:29:49,737
We have victory!

794
01:29:49,905 --> 01:29:53,855
<i>But in the end, it's only a passing thing...

795
01:29:54,034 --> 01:29:55,362
<i>...this shadow.

796
01:29:55,535 --> 01:29:57,908
<i>Even darkness must pass.

797
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,785
<i>A new day will come.

798
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:04,908
<i>And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer

799
01:30:06,839 --> 01:30:09,211
<i>Those were the stories that stayed with you...

800
01:30:09,383 --> 01:30:11,126
<i>...that meant something.

801
01:30:11,302 --> 01:30:13,875
<i>Even if you were too small to understand why.

802
01:30:15,264 --> 01:30:19,096
<i>But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

803
01:30:19,268 --> 01:30:20,846
<i>I know now.

804
01:30:21,687 --> 01:30:23,894
Folk in those stories...

805
01:30:24,065 --> 01:30:28,193
...had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.

806
01:30:28,361 --> 01:30:30,603
They kept going...

807
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:34,531
...because they were holding on to something.

808
01:30:36,119 --> 01:30:38,444
What are we holding on to, Sam?

809
01:30:50,383 --> 01:30:54,298
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.

810
01:30:54,596 --> 01:30:57,217
And it's worth fighting for.

811
01:31:24,126 --> 01:31:28,420
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.

812
01:31:29,173 --> 01:31:33,123
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.

813
01:31:33,302 --> 01:31:35,509
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

814
01:31:39,851 --> 01:31:41,261
Then it is forfeit.

815
01:31:44,022 --> 01:31:45,813
Release them.

816
01:31:57,869 --> 01:31:59,909
Stay out of the forest!

817
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,871
Keep away from the trees!

818
01:32:52,717 --> 01:32:54,508
Final count...

819
01:32:54,677 --> 01:32:57,595
...42.
- 42?

820
01:32:59,057 --> 01:33:03,802
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.

821
01:33:04,604 --> 01:33:08,269
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

822
01:33:12,404 --> 01:33:15,689
- 43.
- He was already dead.

823
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:18,941
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

824
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:23,828
...because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!

825
01:33:26,043 --> 01:33:30,752
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

826
01:33:31,006 --> 01:33:34,541
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.

827
01:33:34,718 --> 01:33:37,672
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

828
01:33:37,847 --> 01:33:40,682
I hear the staff are very good.

829
01:33:46,355 --> 01:33:48,727
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

830
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:53,147
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

831
01:33:53,321 --> 01:33:54,566
I'm starving.

832
01:33:54,739 --> 01:33:57,823
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.

833
01:33:57,992 --> 01:34:01,077
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

834
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:27,428
Saruman's storeroom!

835
01:34:29,775 --> 01:34:32,527
I don't believe it.

836
01:34:32,694 --> 01:34:34,734
It can't be.

837
01:34:35,364 --> 01:34:38,234
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

838
01:34:39,535 --> 01:34:41,860
The finest pipe-weed in the South Farthing.

839
01:34:42,204 --> 01:34:45,324
It's perfect. One barrel each.

840
01:34:45,499 --> 01:34:46,614
Wait.

841
01:34:47,376 --> 01:34:48,574
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?

842
01:34:48,753 --> 01:34:50,295
Share it?

843
01:34:52,131 --> 01:34:54,539
No. No.

844
01:34:56,052 --> 01:34:57,380
Dead plant and all that.

845
01:34:57,803 --> 01:34:59,962
Don't think he'd understand.

846
01:35:01,224 --> 01:35:03,430
Could be a distant relative.

847
01:35:04,227 --> 01:35:06,718
I get it.

848
01:35:06,896 --> 01:35:09,731
Don't be hasty.

849
01:35:10,817 --> 01:35:12,560
Exactly.

850
01:35:13,653 --> 01:35:15,895
Bar-hrum.

851
01:35:41,557 --> 01:35:42,837
This is the old sewer.

852
01:35:43,016 --> 01:35:46,136
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.

853
01:35:46,312 --> 01:35:48,055
You'll find cover in the woods there.

854
01:35:49,106 --> 01:35:51,597
Captain Faramir...

855
01:35:52,234 --> 01:35:54,061
...you have shown your quality, sir.

856
01:35:56,572 --> 01:35:57,853
The very highest.

857
01:35:58,366 --> 01:36:00,987
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee...

858
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:04,114
...where gardeners are held in high honor.

859
01:36:05,289 --> 01:36:07,282
What road will you take once you reach the woods?

860
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:09,453
Gollum says there's a path...

861
01:36:09,627 --> 01:36:13,541
...near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.

862
01:36:14,007 --> 01:36:15,750
Cirith Ungol?

863
01:36:19,304 --> 01:36:21,842
- Is that its name?
- No.

864
01:36:22,015 --> 01:36:23,675
No!

865
01:36:24,517 --> 01:36:27,518
- Yes.
- Frodo...

866
01:36:27,896 --> 01:36:31,431
...they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.

867
01:36:32,317 --> 01:36:34,855
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

868
01:36:35,195 --> 01:36:41,483
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.

869
01:36:42,995 --> 01:36:44,786
I must.

870
01:36:48,333 --> 01:36:51,916
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

871
01:36:52,087 --> 01:36:54,127
Thank you.

872
01:37:05,935 --> 01:37:10,063
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.

873
01:37:22,535 --> 01:37:24,077
Come on, keep up.

874
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:30,327
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.

875
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,787
You know that, don't you?

876
01:37:33,588 --> 01:37:35,166
He was trying to save you, see?

877
01:37:35,674 --> 01:37:37,216
Save me?

878
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:39,709
So there's no hard feelings.

879
01:37:39,886 --> 01:37:45,011
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

880
01:37:45,183 --> 01:37:47,805
Gollum, Gollum.

881
01:37:48,854 --> 01:37:50,597
Yes, master.

882
01:37:51,690 --> 01:37:54,525
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

883
01:37:54,693 --> 01:37:56,982
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

884
01:38:02,493 --> 01:38:07,700
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.

885
01:38:14,839 --> 01:38:17,840
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

886
01:38:18,509 --> 01:38:22,044
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.

887
01:38:27,185 --> 01:38:30,601
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...

888
01:38:31,606 --> 01:38:34,809
<i>...somewhere in the wilderness.

889
01:38:38,113 --> 01:38:41,529
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.

890
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:43,075
What?

891
01:38:43,243 --> 01:38:47,193
I wonder if people will ever say;
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

892
01:38:47,372 --> 01:38:50,622
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

893
01:38:50,792 --> 01:38:53,746
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"

894
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,580
"Yes, my boy.

895
01:38:55,756 --> 01:38:59,540
The most famousest of Hobbits. And that's saying a lot."

896
01:38:59,718 --> 01:39:02,256
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:

897
01:39:02,429 --> 01:39:04,303
"Samwise the Brave."

898
01:39:04,473 --> 01:39:07,225
I want to hear more about Sam.

899
01:39:11,522 --> 01:39:14,523
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.

900
01:39:15,860 --> 01:39:19,904
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

901
01:39:20,990 --> 01:39:22,365
So was I.

902
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:33,955
"Samwise the Brave."

903
01:39:38,216 --> 01:39:39,544
Sméagol?

904
01:39:39,717 --> 01:39:42,635
We're not going to wait for you. Come on.

905
01:39:42,804 --> 01:39:44,713
Master.

906
01:39:44,889 --> 01:39:47,843
Master looks after us.

907
01:39:48,643 --> 01:39:51,430
Master wouldn't hurt us.

908
01:39:51,605 --> 01:39:54,060
Master broke his promise.

909
01:39:54,232 --> 01:39:56,391
Don't ask Sméagol.

910
01:39:56,568 --> 01:39:59,771
Poor, poor Sméagol.

911
01:39:59,946 --> 01:40:02,782
Master betrayed us.

912
01:40:02,949 --> 01:40:06,034
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

913
01:40:06,203 --> 01:40:10,117
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.

914
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:13,042
Kill him! Kill him!

915
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:14,704
Kill them both!

916
01:40:14,878 --> 01:40:18,497
And then we take the precious...

917
01:40:18,674 --> 01:40:22,209
...and we be the master!

918
01:40:22,887 --> 01:40:25,556
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

919
01:40:25,723 --> 01:40:28,392
Eyes always watching.

920
01:40:28,559 --> 01:40:32,094
Then we stabs them out.

921
01:40:32,271 --> 01:40:36,767
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.

922
01:40:36,943 --> 01:40:40,394
Yes. Yes. Yes.

923
01:40:40,571 --> 01:40:43,276
Kill them both.

924
01:40:43,449 --> 01:40:45,940
Yes. No! No!

925
01:40:46,119 --> 01:40:49,819
It's too risky. It's too risky.

926
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:53,113
Where is he? Where has he gone?

927
01:40:53,293 --> 01:40:55,914
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Sméagol?

928
01:40:56,087 --> 01:41:01,462
We could let her do it.

929
01:41:02,427 --> 01:41:06,591
Yes. She could do it.

930
01:41:06,765 --> 01:41:11,308
Yes, precious, she could.

931
01:41:11,478 --> 01:41:17,516
And then we takes it once they're dead.

932
01:41:18,443 --> 01:41:21,279
Once they're dead.

933
01:41:25,701 --> 01:41:29,402
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

934
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:31,619
Sméagol will show you the way.

935
01:41:31,790 --> 01:41:33,928
Follow me.

936
01:41:34,032 --> 01:42:39,725
