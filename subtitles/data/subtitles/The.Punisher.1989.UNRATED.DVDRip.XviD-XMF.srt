00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:18,229
After nearly five years of appeals,

2
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:19,731
Dino Moretti, reputed lieutenant

3
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:21,733
of the Franco crime family,

4
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,735
was released from prison today

5
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:25,236
and acquitted of all charges

6
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:26,738
in connection with the murders

7
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:28,239
of police officer Frank Castle

8
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,741
and his family.

9
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:31,743
Moretti has long
maintained his innocence,

10
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:34,746
claims he has no idea who is responsible

11
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:37,749
for the 125 mysterious gangland murders,

12
00:02:37,749 --> 00:02:40,251
often attributed to a shadowy figure

13
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:41,753
known as The Punisher,

14
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:43,254
which have occurred here

15
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:44,756
over the last half decade.

16
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,758
Laurie Silvers has this report.

17
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:47,759
Mr. Moretti?

18
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,762
How does it feel to
be finally acquitted?

19
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:52,263
It feels great.

20
00:02:52,263 --> 00:02:53,765
Just great.

21
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:55,767
The government says
it's going to appeal.

22
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:57,769
Let them appeal a hundred times.

23
00:02:58,269 --> 00:02:59,270
I'll still win.

24
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:00,772
This is America.

25
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:03,274
If a man is innocent, justice prevails.

26
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:05,777
Are you worried about The Punisher?

27
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:08,780
Let me tell you something
about This Punisher,

28
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,281
whoever he is.

29
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:14,285
If he ever shows up
within 1,000 yards of me,

30
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:17,789
he'll find out what the
word “punished” really means.

31
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:20,291
Now, if you'll excuse me.

32
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:23,294
And there you have it.

33
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:24,796
The dapper don,

34
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:26,798
allegedly head of the
powerful Franco crime family,

35
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:29,801
once again shrugging off
any fear of The Punisher

36
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:33,304
despite the fact that over
125 organized crime figures

37
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:36,307
have been murdered by
the self-styled vigilante

38
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:38,309
in the last five years.

39
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,312
This is Laurie Silvers
for channel 8 news.

40
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:46,818
Hey, what do you think?

41
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:48,820
Maybe I got a future in politics.

42
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,321
Enough of the jokes.

43
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:51,823
Break out the champagne.

44
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:53,324
I'll get it, boss.

45
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:54,826
No. First things first.

46
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:56,327
You guys check the house.

47
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:59,831
Mikey, start the music around here.

48
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:01,833
Winning isn't everything,

49
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,969
it's the only thing...

50
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:14,479
What the fuck?

51
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:53,267
Jesus!

52
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:54,268
Joey!

53
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:07,281
Come on, you guys. Party time.

54
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:12,537
Joey.

55
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:14,038
You!

56
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:15,656
Switch on those cameras!

57
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:17,158
Keep them rolling!

58
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:18,659
Come on, guys!

59
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:20,161
Move it!

60
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:25,166
Keep it rolling!

61
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,667
Keep it rolling!

62
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:34,308
Look, there's somebody there.

63
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:36,811
I got the tight shot.

64
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:39,680
Who is that?

65
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:42,683
Holy shit! The Punisher!

66
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:43,317
It's him!

67
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:45,820
Move in for a close-up!

68
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,322
Are you getting it?

69
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:53,327
Out of the way!

70
00:05:58,449 --> 00:05:59,951
Are you getting it?

71
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:02,954
I got shit all over the place!

72
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:04,455
Keep them going!

73
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:11,963
Come on, God.

74
00:06:12,463 --> 00:06:13,965
Answer me.

75
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:16,467
It's years I'm asking you why.

76
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:18,469
Why are the innocent dead

77
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:20,471
and the guilty alive?

78
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:21,973
Where is justice?

79
00:06:22,473 --> 00:06:24,475
Where is punishment?

80
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:26,978
Or have you already answered?

81
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:29,981
Have you already said to the world,

82
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:33,484
"Here is justice, here is punishment,"

83
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:34,986
Here...

84
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:36,988
In me?

85
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:41,876
Mommy, aren't we going
to wait for daddy?

86
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:43,127
Daddy's working.

87
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:45,129
We'll meet him at grandma's.

88
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,130
OK?

89
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:53,137
Julie!

90
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,641
Julie!

91
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,522
Are you being pressured to resign

92
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:14,025
as head of the Punisher task force?

93
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:15,026
No comment.

94
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:16,527
Do you have leads?

95
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:17,528
No comment.

96
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:19,030
Do you still think

97
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,532
Frank Castle and The
Punisher are the same person?

98
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:22,533
Absolutely.

99
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:25,536
Don't you people have
anything better to do

100
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:26,537
with your time?

101
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:29,540
It's 2:00 in the god damn
morning, for Christ's sake.

102
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,541
Shit.

103
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:33,544
Hey, give me a break.

104
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:38,049
Now, that was smart.

105
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:39,550
Very smart.

106
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,052
The chief of detectives.

107
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:42,553
It must be important.

108
00:07:42,553 --> 00:07:44,055
It is.

109
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:46,557
I have a message from the mayor.

110
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:49,060
I quote, "Frank Castle is dead."

111
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,063
No more talk about him being otherwise.

112
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,066
You tow the line or you get the boot.

113
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,068
You'd go along with that, too.

114
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:59,070
We cannot let the public think

115
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,955
there's some psychotic
ex-cop whacking off wise guys

116
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:02,957
like he's got a hunting license.

117
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:03,958
Why not?

118
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,459
Why not?

119
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:07,461
Berkowitz, it's late.

120
00:08:07,962 --> 00:08:08,963
I'm tired.

121
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:11,465
You're warned.

122
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:17,471
What the hell ever happened to you?

123
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:30,484
Excuse me, lieutenant Berkowitz?

124
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:31,986
I'm detective Sam Leary.

125
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:32,987
Sam?

126
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:34,488
Samantha.

127
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:36,991
I worked with you once five years ago.

128
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:38,993
Did the Moretti heroin bust.

129
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:41,996
It was my first
assignment plain-clothes.

130
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:43,497
I was the hooker.

131
00:08:43,497 --> 00:08:44,498
Oh, right.

132
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:46,867
What can I do for you, detective?

133
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:48,869
I'd like to be your partner.

134
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:51,372
I don't work with a partner.

135
00:08:51,372 --> 00:08:52,873
But you used to.

136
00:08:52,873 --> 00:08:55,126
Used to. Past tense.

137
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:58,879
I'm not after a free ride.

138
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,881
I can carry my share of the load.

139
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:02,383
I'm sure you can.

140
00:09:02,383 --> 00:09:05,386
No, you're not. You're
not even listening.

141
00:09:05,386 --> 00:09:06,387
That's right.

142
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:08,389
I'm not even listening.

143
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:09,390
Why?

144
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,891
I work with the best.

145
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:12,893
Anything else is a waste of my time.

146
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:14,895
Think you're the first to apply?

147
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:17,398
No, but I'm the most qualified.

148
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:18,399
What makes you think that?

149
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,901
I graduated first in
my class at the academy.

150
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:23,904
I scored in the top
1% in the target range.

151
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:26,407
I made detective first time up,

152
00:09:26,407 --> 00:09:29,410
the second youngest on
the force to do that.

153
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,912
It must make your parents proud.

154
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:34,915
But why should it make you my partner?

155
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:39,920
I believe that Frank
Castle's The Punisher.

156
00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:44,925
Know where my office is?

157
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:46,927
Yeah.

158
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:50,931
You be there at 9:00 sharp.

159
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:01,692
Mr. Franco, how does
it feel to be back home?

160
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:04,695
In the 30 minutes since
I've landed, so far, so good.

161
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:06,447
Have you come to take over?

162
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:07,948
It was a long flight.

163
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:09,450
Give him a break.

164
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,452
Aren't you afraid of The Punisher?

165
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:14,455
In Europe, they think you made it up

166
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:15,956
to sell newspapers.

167
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:18,959
What's been killing your
associates for five years?

168
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,961
Too much stress, I guess.

169
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:22,463
Thanks for coming.

170
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:24,465
Come on. Vanish.

171
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:25,966
Just a second.

172
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:29,970
Can I help you, detective?

173
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:33,474
Oh, you already have, Franco.

174
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:34,975
Really? How?

175
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:37,978
Kind of like a worm helps a fisherman.

176
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:41,982
I'm glad you finally came home, Gianni.

177
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:44,485
I was running out of bait.

178
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:45,986
I'll see you around.

179
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:49,990
Too much stress, huh?

180
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:52,493
That's funny.

181
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,380
How'd you like it there?

182
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:57,882
It was OK.

183
00:10:57,882 --> 00:11:00,384
Learn good stuff in those fancy schools?

184
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:01,886
Show him something.

185
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:03,387
You got a quarter?

186
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:04,889
Sure.

187
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:06,390
Here you go.

188
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,391
Watch him.

189
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:12,396
Hey, that's great.

190
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:16,400
I can do it with $10.

191
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,402
That's expensive for me.

192
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:21,906
Give this to Louie in the kitchen.

193
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:24,909
Ask him to give you more cheesecake.

194
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:25,910
Lose something?

195
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,411
Heh heh!

196
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,418
So tell me.

197
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:36,420
How bad is it?

198
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,922
How bad?

199
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:39,924
If you didn't come home,

200
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:42,927
I would be head of the family.

201
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:45,930
It's not going to be families anymore.

202
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,431
That's old thinking.

203
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,433
It's “Dad” thinking.

204
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:51,435
There'll be no more wars,

205
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:52,937
no more territories.

206
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:55,439
How are you going to convince anyone?

207
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,943
With an act of good faith so generous

208
00:11:58,943 --> 00:12:02,947
that even Freddy De Leo
will see the light.

209
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:04,448
A week from now,

210
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:07,451
I've arranged for 600 kilos of pure junk

211
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:08,953
to come in.

212
00:12:08,953 --> 00:12:09,954
600 keys?

213
00:12:09,954 --> 00:12:11,455
$500 million worth.

214
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:12,957
Everyone gets their share,

215
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:15,960
provided they work
together to make it happen.

216
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,462
One group on security,

217
00:12:18,462 --> 00:12:19,964
one at receiving,

218
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:21,465
one in collecting,

219
00:12:21,465 --> 00:12:22,967
one in distribution.

220
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,969
That wouldn't be too hard.

221
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:27,972
And what do we do about The Punisher?

222
00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:30,474
One thing at a time, Jim.

223
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:34,478
First we consolidate.

224
00:12:34,478 --> 00:12:36,981
And then we obliterate.

225
00:12:54,114 --> 00:12:55,115
Excuse me, kind sir,

226
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:58,118
but I can't help but see in you

227
00:12:58,118 --> 00:13:00,621
a man far luckier than me.

228
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:01,622
What?

229
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:04,625
Whatever you can spare
will be sufficient.

230
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,627
And this old
thespian--

231
00:13:08,128 --> 00:13:10,130
What the hell's a thespian?

232
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,132
An actor, sir.

233
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:14,635
Oh, sure.

234
00:13:16,637 --> 00:13:18,138
Thank you.

235
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:19,640
Hey.

236
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,142
What'd I tell you about
bugging the customers?

237
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:23,143
Richie.

238
00:13:23,143 --> 00:13:25,646
Throw this trash out of here.

239
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,151
You can't treat me like this.

240
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:32,653
I demand some respect!

241
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:34,154
I'm not trash!

242
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:36,657
I'm a man!

243
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,663
Maybe I should have
tried some Eugene O'Neill.

244
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:45,165
Aw.

245
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:28,208
Hi there.

246
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,212
Nice weather we
are having for--

247
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:38,218
You were supposed to meet
me here four hours ago.

248
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:39,219
I know.

249
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:41,221
I've heard it all my life.

250
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:43,223
Cheques, responsibility...

251
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:46,226
Can't keep an appointment.

252
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:48,729
Where is the dope coming into?

253
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:50,230
The dope.

254
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:52,733
The dope.

255
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,234
Oh, that.

256
00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:56,737
Pier 30.

257
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:04,745
But the location's not the big story.

258
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:06,747
Who'll be there is.

259
00:15:06,747 --> 00:15:08,749
Who'll be there?

260
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:09,750
Everyone.

261
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,252
They're all working together now.

262
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:13,754
One big, happy family

263
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:17,758
under the fatherly wing of
your old friend Gianni Franco.

264
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:24,264
Mr. P!

265
00:15:24,264 --> 00:15:26,266
Happy hunting.

266
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:40,781
Allez, vite. Ils rapprochent.

267
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:48,789
I can't get this frigging thing to work.

268
00:15:53,794 --> 00:15:55,295
Very difficult.

269
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:56,797
Well, fuck you.

270
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:58,298
Fuck you!

271
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,800
Fuck you!

272
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,803
Hey, there's $500 million
out there, assholes.

273
00:16:02,803 --> 00:16:04,304
Cool out!

274
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:05,806
Here, check the perimeter.

275
00:16:05,806 --> 00:16:07,307
Get with it.

276
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,311
Hello, Red 1.

277
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:12,312
Come in.

278
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:15,816
Red 1, will you get off your ass?

279
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:17,317
What?

280
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:18,819
Everything's OK?

281
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:19,820
Yeah.

282
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:27,828
Red 2, what have you got?

283
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:29,329
Bad kidneys. I got to pee.

284
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,832
So pee. Everything's OK?

285
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:32,833
Yeah.

286
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,334
It's dead here.

287
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:44,976
The U.S. Coast Guard.

288
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:46,477
Cut your engines.

289
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:49,480
What are you doing here?

290
00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:51,983
We had to pull into dock.

291
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:53,484
Our hull is leaking.

292
00:16:53,985 --> 00:16:55,486
Down there. Have a look.

293
00:17:23,514 --> 00:17:25,516
15 minutes late.

294
00:17:25,516 --> 00:17:26,517
Jesus Christ.

295
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:28,019
Fucking faggot Frenchmen.

296
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:30,521
Here they come. Here they come!

297
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:13,064
You're 15 minutes late,
you stupid dickhead.

298
00:18:13,064 --> 00:18:14,565
What's the big idea?

299
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,093
Hey, guys, get back there.

300
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:10,296
600 kilos of dope.

301
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:11,797
Seven dead wise guys.

302
00:20:11,797 --> 00:20:13,799
All from different families.

303
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,402
Guess it's a drug deal gone bad.

304
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,911
Guess again.

305
00:20:55,091 --> 00:21:00,480
Aah!

306
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,002
Idiko Tanaka.

307
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:24,003
She's single,

308
00:21:24,003 --> 00:21:25,505
in her early 40s.

309
00:21:25,505 --> 00:21:27,006
She has one daughter,

310
00:21:27,006 --> 00:21:30,009
a mute American girl
she adopted at birth

311
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:31,511
who never leaves her sight.

312
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:34,514
She's a graduate from
Harvard business school

313
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:38,017
and the first female
ever to head the Yakuza.

314
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:39,519
Yaku what?

315
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,521
Yakuza.

316
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:42,522
Japanese mafia.

317
00:21:43,022 --> 00:21:45,024
This is a long fucking way from Japan.

318
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:47,026
What are they doing here?

319
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:48,528
I don't know.

320
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:50,530
We are about to find out.

321
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,532
OK.

322
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,042
Lady Tanaka.

323
00:22:03,543 --> 00:22:04,544
Mr. Franco.

324
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,546
It is an honour.

325
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:09,048
Your reputation precedes you.

326
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:10,550
As does yours.

327
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,051
Please sit down.

328
00:22:12,051 --> 00:22:13,553
No, thank you.

329
00:22:13,553 --> 00:22:16,556
What I have to say will be brief.

330
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:19,058
We have been tracking your organization

331
00:22:19,058 --> 00:22:20,560
for quite some time.

332
00:22:21,561 --> 00:22:24,564
Your leadership is decimated.

333
00:22:24,564 --> 00:22:26,566
Your soldiers are inexperienced.

334
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:29,068
Our little demonstration on pier 30

335
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:31,070
was ample proof of that.

336
00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:35,575
You're weak, Mr. Franco,

337
00:22:35,575 --> 00:22:37,577
vulnerable...

338
00:22:37,577 --> 00:22:40,079
and we are not.

339
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,083
We could cripple
all your operations--

340
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:48,588
Legal, as well as
illegal-- Very easily.

341
00:22:52,592 --> 00:22:54,093
But we don't want that.

342
00:22:54,594 --> 00:22:57,096
With all due respect,

343
00:22:57,096 --> 00:22:59,098
let's cut through the bullshit.

344
00:22:59,098 --> 00:23:00,600
What do you want?

345
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,602
A partnership.

346
00:23:02,602 --> 00:23:04,103
Define the term.

347
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:06,606
You will manage and oversee

348
00:23:06,606 --> 00:23:09,609
all your business on
a Day-To-Day basis.

349
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:13,613
We will assume the duties
of executive administration,

350
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:17,116
investments, and financial services.

351
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:18,117
Come on!

352
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:20,119
I'm not through.

353
00:23:25,124 --> 00:23:28,127
What do you propose as a split?

354
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:30,630
75% for us.

355
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,132
25% for you.

356
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:36,636
No fucking way am I
going to be a salary boy

357
00:23:37,136 --> 00:23:38,638
to some bunch of nips.

358
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:40,640
I don't know about you guys,

359
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,142
but the De Leo family gives up shit.

360
00:23:43,142 --> 00:23:44,644
We don't work for nobody.

361
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:47,146
Who the fuck do you think you are?

362
00:23:47,647 --> 00:23:49,148
We are Yakuza.

363
00:23:49,148 --> 00:23:52,151
When your ancestors were
still shepherds screwing sheep

364
00:23:52,151 --> 00:23:54,153
on the Mediterranean coast,

365
00:23:54,153 --> 00:23:57,156
ours were the crime lords of Asia.

366
00:23:58,658 --> 00:23:59,659
I'm not offering terms,

367
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:00,660
Mr. Franco.

368
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,662
I'm making demands.

369
00:24:02,662 --> 00:24:05,164
And what if we choose not to comply?

370
00:24:05,164 --> 00:24:09,168
Steps are now being taken
to ensure that you will.

371
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,173
You Americans have a great
capacity for violence.

372
00:24:14,173 --> 00:24:18,177
But it's wild, unfocused.

373
00:24:18,177 --> 00:24:19,679
You will learn.

374
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:26,936
Good day, gentlemen.

375
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:32,441
What do we do?

376
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:35,444
Only one thing we can.

377
00:24:36,445 --> 00:24:38,447
We go to war.

378
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:52,328
What do you think you're
going to do with that,

379
00:24:52,828 --> 00:24:54,330
Play Ms. Pac-Man or something?

380
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,831
Hopefully find Castle.

381
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:56,832
No shit.

382
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:57,833
No shit.

383
00:24:58,334 --> 00:24:59,335
Uh-huh.

384
00:24:59,335 --> 00:25:02,338
How are we going to
accomplish this little miracle?

385
00:25:02,338 --> 00:25:05,341
I've accessed into all
available data banks

386
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:07,343
with information on him

387
00:25:07,343 --> 00:25:10,346
and programmed the
computer to form an analysis

388
00:25:10,346 --> 00:25:11,981
of probable locations.

389
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:12,982
Oh, wow.

390
00:25:12,982 --> 00:25:15,985
Even The Punisher has to live somewhere.

391
00:25:25,494 --> 00:25:26,495
Hey.

392
00:25:27,997 --> 00:25:29,999
You see this board here?

393
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah.

394
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,502
I've been living with it for five years.

395
00:25:33,502 --> 00:25:35,004
Every time he kills somebody,

396
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:36,505
I put a pin there.

397
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:38,507
I fine-tooth every building,

398
00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:41,010
every alley, in this city.

399
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:44,513
The only thing that
I've got to show for it

400
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:47,516
is these little calling cards here...

401
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:49,769
and a whole bunch of these.

402
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,774
I've already been through this city.

403
00:25:55,274 --> 00:25:58,778
I've been in it,
around it, on top of it.

404
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:01,280
You name it.

405
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:05,034
How about under it?

406
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:15,544
I get the red.

407
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:17,046
I hate yellow.

408
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:18,547
The red's gross, Jenny.

409
00:26:18,547 --> 00:26:20,549
I think it's totally hot.

410
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:25,054
Hi. I'm Peter Bear. I really care.

411
00:26:25,054 --> 00:26:28,057
And to show you it's true,

412
00:26:28,057 --> 00:26:30,309
I have things to teach you.

413
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:31,927
Like what, Peter?

414
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:33,429
Ohh! Ohh!

415
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,321
Come on!

416
00:26:42,321 --> 00:26:43,322
Wait up!

417
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:51,330
Roger?

418
00:26:52,331 --> 00:26:53,833
Roger?

419
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:02,708
Hello?

420
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:04,710
Hello?

421
00:27:06,212 --> 00:27:07,213
Come out.

422
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:09,715
Come out, wherever you are.

423
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:10,716
Oh!

424
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:14,220
Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble,

425
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,723
I better get out of here on the double.

426
00:27:19,225 --> 00:27:19,725
Aah!

427
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,731
With your flair for entrances,

428
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:28,734
you should consider a
career in the theatre.

429
00:27:30,236 --> 00:27:31,237
I'll think about it.

430
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:34,740
What are you doing here?

431
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,742
What would I be doing,

432
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:39,745
tramping around the sewers
of this great metropolis?

433
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:41,247
Sightseeing.

434
00:27:41,247 --> 00:27:43,749
Heh heh. Very funny.

435
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:46,752
I bring you news, you give me grief.

436
00:27:48,254 --> 00:27:51,257
You know, they all think you're dead.

437
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:53,759
They'll kill each other now.

438
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,763
Turn the lights off when you leave.

439
00:27:57,763 --> 00:27:59,765
Very clever.

440
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:01,767
And what will you do

441
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:03,269
while the carnage ensues?

442
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:04,770
Take a vacation.

443
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,273
Yes, I hear the sewers of Paris

444
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:09,775
are lovely this time of year.

445
00:28:10,276 --> 00:28:11,777
And what about the children?

446
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:12,778
What children?

447
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,281
The children of the new bosses

448
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,783
are now counted among their losses.

449
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:21,287
They're being held for
ransom by the Japanese.

450
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:24,290
So the bosses will have to pay up.

451
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,292
Pay they will and all for naught.

452
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:28,794
The children will be
sold by the slave trade--

453
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:30,296
They've been bought.

454
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:32,298
My god, man, don't you see?

455
00:28:32,298 --> 00:28:35,301
This is the result of your
five-year killing spree.

456
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:37,803
You weakened the
fathers to such degrees,

457
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:40,806
they couldn't protect
their own families.

458
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:43,809
I punish the guilty.

459
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:47,696
And as a result, the
innocent now suffer.

460
00:28:53,202 --> 00:28:54,703
You must do something!

461
00:28:54,703 --> 00:28:57,706
You must do something.

462
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:02,711
Enough of this fucking brainstorming.

463
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:04,213
Let's snatch her daughter,

464
00:29:04,213 --> 00:29:05,714
take her to the meeting

465
00:29:05,714 --> 00:29:07,216
with this in her mouth,

466
00:29:07,216 --> 00:29:08,717
then we talk.

467
00:29:08,717 --> 00:29:10,719
Before you go snatching anybody,

468
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:13,222
let me tell you a story

469
00:29:13,222 --> 00:29:14,723
about our Miss Tanaka.

470
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:17,226
The only person she was ever close to

471
00:29:17,226 --> 00:29:18,727
was her twin brother.

472
00:29:18,727 --> 00:29:21,730
They grew up in a Tokyo orphanage

473
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,232
after the second world war.

474
00:29:23,232 --> 00:29:24,733
They were inseparable.

475
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:26,735
They lived together their whole lives.

476
00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:28,737
One day he stuck the Yakuza

477
00:29:28,737 --> 00:29:30,739
for a lot of money,

478
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:33,242
which he had no
intention of paying back.

479
00:29:33,242 --> 00:29:36,245
Nothing happened to him because of her.

480
00:29:36,245 --> 00:29:39,248
Then other people started
getting the same idea.

481
00:29:39,248 --> 00:29:43,752
Before she could become
head of the organization,

482
00:29:43,752 --> 00:29:48,257
the other leaders demanded
an act of absolute loyalty.

483
00:29:48,257 --> 00:29:50,259
You know what she did?

484
00:29:52,261 --> 00:29:54,263
She went home,

485
00:29:54,263 --> 00:29:58,767
cooked her brother a beautiful meal,

486
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:01,770
waited until he had finished,

487
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,273
and then slit his throat.

488
00:30:04,273 --> 00:30:05,274
Jesus.

489
00:30:05,274 --> 00:30:06,775
What are you saying?

490
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:08,777
We don't deal with her?

491
00:30:08,777 --> 00:30:10,779
We can't deal with her.

492
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:13,282
You're saying there's nothing
that can save our kids.

493
00:30:13,782 --> 00:30:17,786
There is, but it's lying
at the bottom of the harbour.

494
00:30:21,288 --> 00:30:24,291
Well, I'm going to the meeting.

495
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,292
Yeah.

496
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:27,294
Yeah, I'm going, too.

497
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:30,297
I'm not.

498
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:54,131
Good.

499
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:56,133
The money for the children.

500
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:59,252
The slave business is very profitable.

501
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:02,139
Come on. Don't cry.

502
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:04,141
We're going to be OK.

503
00:32:04,141 --> 00:32:07,144
We're not. It's because
of my father I'm here.

504
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:08,645
That's not true.

505
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:10,647
Then why are we here?

506
00:32:10,647 --> 00:32:12,149
I don't know.

507
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:13,650
We're being held for ransom

508
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,153
because our fathers are rich gangsters.

509
00:32:16,153 --> 00:32:18,655
But my father's not a gangster.

510
00:32:18,655 --> 00:32:20,157
Are you kidding?

511
00:32:20,157 --> 00:32:22,159
Your father's the biggest gangster

512
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,660
and a coward.

513
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,663
My dad said he's
responsible for this mess.

514
00:32:26,663 --> 00:32:27,664
Bullshit!

515
00:32:27,664 --> 00:32:29,166
You're bullshit!

516
00:32:41,178 --> 00:32:43,680
Why are you fighting?

517
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,184
Everything is going to be all right.

518
00:32:47,184 --> 00:32:49,186
I want to go home.

519
00:32:49,186 --> 00:32:51,188
And you will.

520
00:32:51,188 --> 00:32:52,189
When?

521
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:53,690
Soon.

522
00:32:57,694 --> 00:32:59,196
Shh.

523
00:33:00,697 --> 00:33:02,699
No more tears.

524
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:06,203
Here.

525
00:33:08,205 --> 00:33:10,207
Come with me.

526
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:11,708
Leave her alone.

527
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:15,212
Ow!

528
00:33:28,225 --> 00:33:29,226
Uhh!

529
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:00,624
Come in.

530
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:02,125
Thank you.

531
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:09,633
Hi.

532
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:41,164
Here's your usual.

533
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,711
Aah! Aah! Aah!

534
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:29,713
Aah! Aah! Aah!

535
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:48,231
Every day the children are gone,

536
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:49,733
it's going to cost you money.

537
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:57,741
Take that message to your people.

538
00:36:48,174 --> 00:36:51,177
Take the money. Run. Go! Go!

539
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,672
Hold it. Hold it.

540
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:21,174
Who are these two happy campers?

541
00:37:21,174 --> 00:37:22,676
They won't say anything.

542
00:37:22,676 --> 00:37:24,678
Be still.

543
00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:26,179
I said, be still.

544
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,183
You'd think he was hiding
something under there.

545
00:37:31,184 --> 00:37:32,185
May I?

546
00:37:32,185 --> 00:37:33,186
Be my guest.

547
00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:39,693
What the hell is this?

548
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:42,195
Trouble.

549
00:37:43,196 --> 00:37:45,699
Get him out of here.

550
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:49,202
I'll get it.

551
00:37:49,202 --> 00:37:50,203
OK.

552
00:37:50,203 --> 00:37:51,204
Lieutenant?

553
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,220
You won't believe this.

554
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,221
Try me.

555
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:10,223
The kids of the new family heads

556
00:38:10,223 --> 00:38:11,224
have been snatched.

557
00:38:11,725 --> 00:38:14,728
They've named The Punisher
as the prime suspect.

558
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,231
They're wrong.

559
00:38:18,231 --> 00:38:19,733
It makes sense.

560
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:21,234
I know it does.

561
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:22,235
But they're wrong.

562
00:38:22,235 --> 00:38:24,237
Do you have a reason for saying that?

563
00:38:24,237 --> 00:38:27,240
I've got two reasons for saying that.

564
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:56,853
My contacts tell me the kids are here.

565
00:38:58,855 --> 00:39:00,857
You sure this is it?

566
00:39:00,857 --> 00:39:03,360
I'd stake my reputation on it,

567
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,861
if I had one.

568
00:39:04,861 --> 00:39:07,364
Do you got a spare?

569
00:39:07,364 --> 00:39:08,365
What?

570
00:39:08,365 --> 00:39:09,866
One of those.

571
00:39:09,866 --> 00:39:11,868
If they're holding the kids here,

572
00:39:11,868 --> 00:39:13,870
it's with a fucking arsenal.

573
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,873
You move left instead
of right, you're dead.

574
00:39:16,873 --> 00:39:20,377
The critics said the same
thing about my Hamlet.

575
00:39:20,377 --> 00:39:22,379
Stay here.

576
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,382
Watch your back.

577
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:17,614
That was a very expensive
question you asked

578
00:43:17,614 --> 00:43:20,116
at our place the other night.

579
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:28,124
It cost us nearly $2 million in cash.

580
00:43:34,631 --> 00:43:37,634
How much pain do you think that buys?

581
00:43:40,136 --> 00:43:43,139
Is the question true/false
or multiple choice?

582
00:43:45,141 --> 00:43:46,142
Neither.

583
00:43:55,652 --> 00:43:57,153
Uhh!

584
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,661
Who sent you?

585
00:44:06,162 --> 00:44:07,664
Batman.

586
00:44:19,676 --> 00:44:23,179
Do you get the impression
I don't believe you?

587
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:25,682
Do you think I give a shit?

588
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:45,702
You handle your pain very well.

589
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:56,212
Let's see how well you
handle the pain of others.

590
00:45:20,236 --> 00:45:22,739
Now will you tell me?

591
00:45:25,742 --> 00:45:28,745
You're a very stubborn man.

592
00:45:30,246 --> 00:45:31,748
I have an appointment.

593
00:45:31,748 --> 00:45:35,752
I will leave you in
the hands of Mr. Ito.

594
00:45:38,755 --> 00:45:41,257
He will keep you alive

595
00:45:41,257 --> 00:45:44,260
much longer than you care to be.

596
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:46,262
Goodbye.

597
00:45:49,265 --> 00:45:50,767
Hey.

598
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,271
Have a nice day.

599
00:46:21,297 --> 00:46:22,799
Wait.

600
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,301
Come here.

601
00:46:27,303 --> 00:46:29,305
I've got something to say.

602
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:35,445
Sayonara.

603
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,823
I don't want to stretch this out,

604
00:46:46,823 --> 00:46:49,325
so tell me where the kids are.

605
00:46:49,325 --> 00:46:51,327
Deserted warehouse. Avenue "A".

606
00:46:51,327 --> 00:46:53,830
Take care of the little ones.

607
00:46:54,831 --> 00:46:56,833
Thank you for your cooperation.

608
00:47:04,974 --> 00:47:07,477
You could spend your
whole life down here

609
00:47:07,477 --> 00:47:08,978
and not find one clue.

610
00:47:08,978 --> 00:47:09,979
We could get lucky.

611
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,481
The eternal optimist, huh?

612
00:47:11,981 --> 00:47:12,982
Look who's talking.

613
00:47:13,483 --> 00:47:14,734
Five years with no leads.

614
00:47:14,734 --> 00:47:18,738
Now you're tramping around the
sewers on a computer's hunch.

615
00:47:18,738 --> 00:47:19,739
How come?

616
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:21,240
How come what?

617
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,242
How come you never gave up?

618
00:47:23,242 --> 00:47:27,246
I know what it's like to be given up on.

619
00:47:27,246 --> 00:47:29,248
Who gave up on you?

620
00:47:29,248 --> 00:47:30,249
Everybody.

621
00:47:32,251 --> 00:47:33,252
Except him, right?

622
00:47:33,252 --> 00:47:34,253
That's right.

623
00:47:35,755 --> 00:47:37,256
So, what happened?

624
00:47:37,256 --> 00:47:41,761
You know how you go out
for a drink after work?

625
00:47:41,761 --> 00:47:44,764
In my case it was the drink before work,

626
00:47:44,764 --> 00:47:46,265
the drink during work,

627
00:47:46,265 --> 00:47:49,268
and finally the drink instead of work.

628
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:52,271
Then it became a problem.

629
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:54,273
Nobody wanted to deal with it,

630
00:47:54,273 --> 00:47:55,274
especially me.

631
00:47:55,274 --> 00:47:56,776
Before I knew it,

632
00:47:56,776 --> 00:48:00,279
I was busted down to
collecting empty shell casings

633
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:02,281
on the firing range.

634
00:48:02,281 --> 00:48:04,283
Out of sight, out of mind.

635
00:48:04,283 --> 00:48:06,285
Then along comes Frank Castle

636
00:48:06,285 --> 00:48:08,287
with a shiny new detective badge,

637
00:48:08,287 --> 00:48:10,790
and he says he wants to learn

638
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:13,292
from the guy who wrote the book

639
00:48:13,292 --> 00:48:14,794
on busting bad guys.

640
00:48:14,794 --> 00:48:15,795
Me.

641
00:48:15,795 --> 00:48:17,797
He took me into his life,

642
00:48:17,797 --> 00:48:19,799
helped me get my act together,

643
00:48:19,799 --> 00:48:22,802
and showed me how to be a cop again.

644
00:48:22,802 --> 00:48:26,055
So what's a little
sewer shit for a friend?

645
00:48:28,558 --> 00:48:31,561
You know, when we get our kids back,

646
00:48:31,561 --> 00:48:34,564
I'll rip her fucking heart
out with my bare hands.

647
00:48:35,064 --> 00:48:36,065
I swear.

648
00:48:36,065 --> 00:48:38,067
None for me. I'm on medication.

649
00:48:39,569 --> 00:48:40,570
Hey, salud.

650
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:42,572
Here's to the safe
return of our children.

651
00:48:42,572 --> 00:48:43,573
Salud.

652
00:48:43,573 --> 00:48:44,574
Salud.

653
00:48:47,076 --> 00:48:49,078
Here we go.

654
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:58,087
So, Mr. Franco decided not to attend.

655
00:48:59,088 --> 00:49:00,590
A wise decision.

656
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,708
What are you talking about?

657
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:17,320
You fucking bitch!

658
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:20,323
Aah!

659
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:27,831
What are you waiting for?

660
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:30,083
You're going to kill us, do it!

661
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:31,585
I already have.

662
00:49:35,088 --> 00:49:36,590
Champagne.

663
00:49:41,094 --> 00:49:42,095
The glasses.

664
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:12,626
Thirsty, Mr. De Leo?

665
00:50:25,138 --> 00:50:27,641
Since you have refused the drink...

666
00:50:29,643 --> 00:50:31,144
Please,

667
00:50:31,144 --> 00:50:33,647
accept the chaser.

668
00:50:34,648 --> 00:50:35,649
Aah!

669
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,536
Black coffee, Ed.

670
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,537
Thanks.

671
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,542
Hey, that's my bus!

672
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,543
Hey!

673
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:50,547
Hey, that's my stop!

674
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,052
Hey!

675
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,554
Hey!

676
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,556
You missed my stop.

677
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,557
Sorry.

678
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,061
Thank you.

679
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,066
Don't mention it.

680
00:51:49,472 --> 00:51:52,475
The kid's ready. The
boat sails in an hour.

681
00:51:52,475 --> 00:51:54,978
I want you to meet Jimmy.

682
00:52:05,488 --> 00:52:06,489
Wake up!

683
00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:14,497
Psst!

684
00:52:14,497 --> 00:52:15,999
Uhh! Uhh!

685
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:25,508
It's all right.

686
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:27,510
Don't be afraid.

687
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:34,517
I'm here to take you home.

688
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:49,532
Come on. Let's go.

689
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:53,536
Let's go.

690
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:56,539
Come on. Run. Run.

691
00:52:56,539 --> 00:52:58,041
Into the bus.

692
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,542
Move it. Move it.

693
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:00,543
They took Tommy away.

694
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,544
What?

695
00:53:01,544 --> 00:53:03,046
Down the corridor.

696
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:04,547
Cathy. Where's Cathy?

697
00:53:04,547 --> 00:53:06,549
Get in the bus.

698
00:53:06,549 --> 00:53:08,051
Come on.

699
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:12,055
Stay in the bus, OK? Stay here.

700
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:42,085
Tommy.

701
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:44,087
Where's Cathy?

702
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:45,588
I don't know.

703
00:53:45,588 --> 00:53:46,589
Come on.

704
00:53:56,883 --> 00:53:58,885
I came down for my dolly.

705
00:54:01,888 --> 00:54:03,390
Run to the bus, Cathy.

706
00:54:09,396 --> 00:54:10,397
Let him go!

707
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,402
Shoot him!

708
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:30,417
Get down!

709
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:31,418
Where's Tommy?

710
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:34,671
They've got him. I'll get him back.

711
00:54:45,298 --> 00:54:46,549
All right. Let's go.

712
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:10,573
Hold on!

713
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:23,586
Stay down!

714
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:24,587
I'm scared.

715
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,089
Yaah!

716
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,189
Shit! Cops!

717
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:13,696
Hold on!

718
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,719
Hold your fire!

719
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,222
Come on, kids. Come on. Over here.

720
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:40,223
Hurry. Hurry.

721
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:41,724
Is my mommy here?

722
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:42,725
Hurry!

723
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:31,407
Hello, Frank.

724
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:34,911
How you been?

725
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:39,916
Busy.

726
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:41,417
Oh, I know.

727
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:48,424
I know you have.

728
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:53,930
I'm in charge of the body count.

729
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,935
What the hell happened, Frank?

730
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:01,437
Frank is dead.

731
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:02,939
All right?

732
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,441
Oh, I see.

733
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:09,946
So you decided everybody
else had to be dead, too.

734
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:11,447
Is that it?

735
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:12,448
Nah.

736
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:15,952
If you're guilty, you're dead.

737
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:21,457
Courts decide who's guilty,

738
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:22,959
not cops.

739
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,463
They hereby swear to uphold the law.

740
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:28,464
Remember?

741
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:36,973
I've been looking for
you for five years, man.

742
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:42,979
Why the hell didn't
you come to me for help?

743
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:45,481
I didn't need your help.

744
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:48,484
You're sick. You know that, don't you?

745
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:54,490
No, I'm not.

746
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:58,494
Then what the fuck you call
125 murders in five years?

747
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,497
Work in progress.

748
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:03,499
God damn you! Look!

749
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,501
It's no fucking joke here.

750
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,004
They are going to electrocute you,

751
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:10,506
and there's nothing I
can do anything about.

752
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:12,008
Talk to me, man.

753
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,009
Let me in!

754
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,510
Let me in!

755
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,012
They were my family, too.

756
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:18,014
They were my family, too.

757
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:22,018
Let me in, god damn it! Let me in!

758
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:24,520
I see.

759
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,023
You want to die. Is that it?

760
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,525
Well, fuck you. Go ahead and die.

761
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:33,029
The Frank I knew died five years ago.

762
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,031
Fuck you!

763
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,537
Open this door.

764
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,552
Ha ha ha ha!

765
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:01,174
No! Please don't!

766
01:01:03,309 --> 01:01:05,561
Aah!

767
01:01:08,815 --> 01:01:09,816
In a few moments,

768
01:01:09,816 --> 01:01:11,317
Frank Castle, the ex-police officer

769
01:01:11,818 --> 01:01:14,320
who's waged a one-man war
against organized crime

770
01:01:14,821 --> 01:01:15,822
for the past five years,

771
01:01:16,322 --> 01:01:18,825
will be escorted to court
to face an unprecedented

772
01:01:19,325 --> 01:01:21,327
125 first-degree murder charges.

773
01:01:21,828 --> 01:01:23,830
There's still no news
as to the whereabouts

774
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:25,331
Of Tommy Franco,

775
01:01:25,331 --> 01:01:28,334
the son of crime boss Gianni Franco.

776
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:40,963
Where's Berkowitz?

777
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:42,465
Hurting.

778
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:45,968
What happened
between you two--

779
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:46,969
What do you care?

780
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:49,972
Hey, I care. I'm his partner.

781
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:52,975
He carried the burden for
a long time by himself.

782
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:58,481
He needed help, and you weren't there.

783
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:01,234
I was the next best thing.

784
01:02:01,734 --> 01:02:04,237
He resigned from the
force after seeing you.

785
01:02:04,237 --> 01:02:06,739
He lived for the day he found you.

786
01:02:06,739 --> 01:02:10,743
That's all he had, and
now you've taken that away.

787
01:02:10,743 --> 01:02:12,245
He's your best friend.

788
01:02:12,245 --> 01:02:16,249
Why do you want to
take him down with you?

789
01:02:16,249 --> 01:02:19,252
You were his life before
this ever happened,

790
01:02:19,252 --> 01:02:21,754
and you've been his life ever since,

791
01:02:21,754 --> 01:02:24,757
and you fucking well know that.

792
01:02:24,757 --> 01:02:27,760
How long do you think someone can live

793
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,263
after you've cut out their heart?

794
01:02:31,264 --> 01:02:33,766
A long time.

795
01:02:33,766 --> 01:02:36,769
Like you? Is that
what you want for Jake?

796
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:39,772
To live like you?

797
01:02:41,774 --> 01:02:43,276
Call him.

798
01:02:43,276 --> 01:02:44,277
What?

799
01:02:44,777 --> 01:02:46,779
I said, call him.

800
01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:18,311
Nighty-night, asshole.

801
01:03:33,826 --> 01:03:35,328
Let him be.

802
01:03:39,332 --> 01:03:42,335
What happened to your
family wasn't supposed to.

803
01:03:42,835 --> 01:03:46,339
If I could undo it,
I would, but I can't.

804
01:03:46,339 --> 01:03:50,343
I swear this on the life
of my son Thomas Anthony.

805
01:03:52,345 --> 01:03:54,347
I want him back.

806
01:03:56,349 --> 01:03:59,852
I can't do it myself, or I would.

807
01:04:01,354 --> 01:04:03,856
I need you, Castle.

808
01:04:03,856 --> 01:04:06,359
I'll give you anything you want.

809
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:08,361
I'll do anything you wish.

810
01:04:11,364 --> 01:04:12,865
Say something.

811
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:14,867
Fuck you.

812
01:04:16,869 --> 01:04:19,372
Let me put it another way.

813
01:04:32,385 --> 01:04:34,387
A life for a life.

814
01:04:34,387 --> 01:04:37,890
I'm not going to ask you twice, Castle.

815
01:04:41,394 --> 01:04:42,395
Well?

816
01:04:51,404 --> 01:04:52,405
OK.

817
01:04:52,405 --> 01:04:54,407
OK, I'll do it.

818
01:04:54,407 --> 01:04:56,909
But understand...

819
01:04:56,909 --> 01:05:00,913
when this is over, you're dead.

820
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:13,175
The elevator stops at 40.

821
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:14,677
They're on 41.

822
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:18,681
We need a key to get there,
which the lobby guard has.

823
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:20,683
Five minutes. Push the first button.

824
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,685
What's that going to do?

825
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:27,189
Blow out the lights.

826
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,191
Sir, just in case,

827
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:32,695
it's been an honour to have known you.

828
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:35,698
Likewise.

829
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:38,701
Castle, here's some body armour for you.

830
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:40,703
Just in case.

831
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:42,705
Here. Just in case.

832
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:45,708
Have it your way.

833
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:48,210
15 minutes.

834
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:51,213
You hit the second button.

835
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:53,215
What's that going to blow out?

836
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,217
Everything else.

837
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:04,226
Hey.

838
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:07,229
I got to take a leak.

839
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:08,731
Be my guest.

840
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:10,232
That's fine.

841
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:13,235
I don't know what the boss will say

842
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:16,739
about a yellow stain on the seat.

843
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:25,247
Hey, hey, man! That's skin back there.

844
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,249
Take it easy.

845
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:28,250
Um...

846
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,752
What?

847
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:34,757
Are you going to handle
the equipment for me?

848
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:40,763
In front.

849
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:42,765
Can I ask you a question?

850
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:43,766
What?

851
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:46,268
Is an IQ test required for this job?

852
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:47,269
No.

853
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:52,274
I didn't think so.

854
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:55,911
Hey, man, I got the pizza.

855
01:07:23,189 --> 01:07:24,690
Psst.

856
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:34,510
Can I ask you a question?

857
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:39,515
What's the reason behind
you killing all those guys?

858
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:42,017
There's a limit to revenge.

859
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:44,520
Well, I haven't reached mine yet.

860
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:26,812
Which way?

861
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:30,816
Not that way.

862
01:10:57,801 --> 01:10:59,302
You go that way.

863
01:13:41,111 --> 01:13:42,112
You all right?

864
01:13:42,612 --> 01:13:44,865
Don't worry about this poor, old slob.

865
01:13:44,865 --> 01:13:46,867
Get on the case. Do the job.

866
01:13:46,867 --> 01:13:48,368
Take care of this guy.

867
01:13:48,368 --> 01:13:51,488
I'll operate under my
own steam, thank you.

868
01:14:04,634 --> 01:14:06,002
Here. Hold this.

869
01:14:22,519 --> 01:14:23,520
Tommy!

870
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:24,521
Dad!

871
01:14:26,022 --> 01:14:27,023
Tommy!

872
01:14:29,526 --> 01:14:32,779
How long will it take
to get an elevator?

873
01:14:32,779 --> 01:14:34,281
It's hard to say.

874
01:14:34,281 --> 01:14:36,283
Elevators are very temperamental things.

875
01:14:36,283 --> 01:14:38,785
So do cops who hate being jerked around.

876
01:14:38,785 --> 01:14:39,786
10 minutes.

877
01:14:39,786 --> 01:14:41,788
How long? Hey, how long?

878
01:14:41,788 --> 01:14:43,790
Uh, five minutes?

879
01:14:45,425 --> 01:14:47,427
Ah, Mr. Franco.

880
01:14:47,427 --> 01:14:50,430
How nice to see you again.

881
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:51,932
Let him go.

882
01:14:53,934 --> 01:14:55,435
You've gotten everything you wanted.

883
01:14:57,938 --> 01:14:59,439
Not quite yet.

884
01:16:28,028 --> 01:16:30,530
Take another step, Mr. Franco.

885
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:32,532
Well, you can't win here.

886
01:16:32,532 --> 01:16:35,035
You kill him, I kill you.

887
01:16:35,035 --> 01:16:36,536
And who loses more?

888
01:16:36,536 --> 01:16:38,538
Certainly not me.

889
01:16:48,048 --> 01:16:49,549
What do you want?

890
01:16:49,549 --> 01:16:51,051
On your knees.

891
01:16:53,553 --> 01:16:55,055
On your knees!

892
01:16:59,059 --> 01:17:01,561
Put the gun in your mouth.

893
01:17:04,064 --> 01:17:07,567
You have my word he will live.

894
01:17:07,567 --> 01:17:10,570
How do I know you'll keep it?

895
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:12,072
You don't,

896
01:17:12,072 --> 01:17:15,575
but some chance is
better than no chance.

897
01:17:22,582 --> 01:17:25,085
All the way in.

898
01:17:25,085 --> 01:17:27,087
Pull that trigger, Mr. Franco.

899
01:17:27,587 --> 01:17:28,588
Now! Now!

900
01:17:28,588 --> 01:17:32,092
This is part of your
education. You watch.

901
01:17:32,092 --> 01:17:35,095
Goodbye, Mr. Franco.

902
01:17:54,364 --> 01:17:56,366
All right, guys. Let's go.

903
01:17:58,868 --> 01:17:59,869
Tommy?

904
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:01,371
Dad.

905
01:18:01,621 --> 01:18:02,622
Tommy.

906
01:18:06,023 --> 01:18:09,526
Let me have a look at you. Care to walk?

907
01:18:10,027 --> 01:18:11,028
Yeah.

908
01:18:11,028 --> 01:18:12,279
OK. Come on.

909
01:18:20,153 --> 01:18:22,155
Wait outside, my son.

910
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:25,158
I'll see to him.

911
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:26,660
I can help him.

912
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,161
Wait outside, Tommy.

913
01:18:42,809 --> 01:18:45,195
I must compliment you, Castle.

914
01:18:45,195 --> 01:18:48,198
You've done something I
never dreamed possible.

915
01:18:48,198 --> 01:18:50,701
You've wiped out the competition.

916
01:18:50,701 --> 01:18:53,704
Thanks to you, there's only me.

917
01:18:53,704 --> 01:18:55,072
In five years' time,

918
01:18:55,072 --> 01:18:56,573
my new organization

919
01:18:56,573 --> 01:19:00,077
will be the most powerful
crime syndicate on earth,

920
01:19:00,077 --> 01:19:03,330
and that boy whose life you saved

921
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:05,332
will inherit all of it.

922
01:19:05,332 --> 01:19:08,218
And the only thing he will have to fear,

923
01:19:08,218 --> 01:19:10,721
I'm about to eliminate.

924
01:19:14,725 --> 01:19:16,727
You gave me back my son.

925
01:19:16,727 --> 01:19:19,229
Thank you very much. I'm in your debt.

926
01:19:21,481 --> 01:19:23,483
See you in hell, Castle.

927
01:19:23,483 --> 01:19:24,484
Dad!

928
01:19:24,484 --> 01:19:25,352
Tommy!

929
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:19,357
Dad, stop!

930
01:20:19,357 --> 01:20:20,358
Stop!

931
01:20:24,746 --> 01:20:26,247
Dad, get off him!

932
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:10,792
Dad?

933
01:21:11,793 --> 01:21:12,660
Dad.

934
01:21:29,177 --> 01:21:31,179
I'm going to kill you.

935
01:21:38,186 --> 01:21:39,187
Good.

936
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:44,192
Maybe if you get it over with now,

937
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:47,078
you won't grow up to be like him.

938
01:21:57,589 --> 01:21:58,590
Come on.

939
01:22:00,091 --> 01:22:01,593
Do it.

940
01:22:02,093 --> 01:22:03,094
Do it.

941
01:22:06,097 --> 01:22:07,599
Do it.

942
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:23,231
What the hell?

943
01:22:24,732 --> 01:22:25,233
Whoa.

944
01:22:25,733 --> 01:22:27,235
All right. Split up.

945
01:22:28,236 --> 01:22:28,987
Frank?

946
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:30,488
Frank?

947
01:22:40,498 --> 01:22:42,500
You're a good boy, Tommy.

948
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,503
Grow up to be a good man.

949
01:22:55,013 --> 01:22:57,015
Because if not...

950
01:22:57,015 --> 01:22:59,017
I'll be waiting.

951
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:18,152
Are you all right?

952
01:23:18,152 --> 01:23:20,655
Which way did he go?

953
01:23:44,679 --> 01:23:46,180
Frank!

954
01:23:50,184 --> 01:23:52,687
Frank!

955
01:24:02,697 --> 01:24:05,199
I still talk to God sometimes.

956
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:09,704
I ask him if what I'm
doing is right or wrong.

957
01:24:09,704 --> 01:24:12,707
I'm still waiting for an answer.

958
01:24:12,707 --> 01:24:16,210
And until I get one, I'll be out here.

959
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:17,712
Waiting.

960
01:24:17,712 --> 01:24:18,713
Watching.

961
01:24:20,715 --> 01:24:22,717
The guilty will be punished.
