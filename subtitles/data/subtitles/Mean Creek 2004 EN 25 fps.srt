00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,320
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?!

2
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,520
- You're a punk, Sam!
- Get off.

3
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,680
I ought to kill you!
You fucking dickhead!

4
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,720
- I told you to never touch my camera!
- Stop!

5
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,040
Didn't I?! Fucker! You little wimp!
Bitch! Pussy! I told you!

6
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,200
I ought to fucking kill you!
And I will kill you, you little punk,

7
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,840
if I ever catch you fucking
with my camera again.

8
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,200
- He's so gonna cry.
- Step on him!

9
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,080
- Get out of my way!
- Relax, man.

10
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,920
Are you OK?

11
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,520
You ever stare at the ceiling
till it started looking kind of funny?

12
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,720
Like it was breathing.
Like it was saying something.

13
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,200
Like it was saying,
"Rocky,

14
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,600
you gotta do something
about what's been going on."

15
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,120
Something's gotta happen, Sam.

16
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,200
Something's gotta give.

17
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,760
We can call the police.

18
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,800
Police wouldn't do jack.

19
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,360
I wish I was bigger.

20
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm bigger.

21
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,440
Not to mention the fact
that I'm smarter.

22
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,960
If you do something,
he'll just get you.

23
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,520
Did you ever used to get me
when we used to play hide-and-seek?

24
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,720
- No.
- He wouldn't have any better luck.

25
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,160
Wanna know my secret hiding spot?

26
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,120
The roof.

27
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,400
The disappearing man.

28
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,440
Exactly.

29
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,040
So high. Oh, my God.

30
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,280
Rocky's thinking about
doing something to George.

31
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,400
I don't get how the teachers

32
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,440
can just let him get away with that.

33
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,520
Teachers don't care.

34
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,240
They have him in detention
for 15 minutes for a week.

35
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,520
Something's gotta give.

36
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,400
If you could snap your fingers
right now,

37
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,040
and he would drop dead in his tracks,
would you do it?

38
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,440
Are we still on for Saturday?

39
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,040
Yeah, of course.

40
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,120
So, what are we gonna do?

41
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,720
I'll figure something out,

42
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,360
and I'll surprise you.

43
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,000
Hey, you know that fat kid, George,

44
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,360
who they keep holding back
from graduating middle school?

45
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,920
Yeah, I hate that guy.

46
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,640
He beat up Sam.

47
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,480
No.

48
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,720
Hey, you know
when we were at Rollins,

49
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,480
that crazy kid
chased me across the field

50
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,080
and cracked my head
open with a bat.

51
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,840
- Finally, an explanation.
- Yeah, anyway...

52
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,120
- He's a real pig.
- I say we smoke that ham.

53
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,520
Yeah? Make some
ham sandwiches?

54
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,120
Pork chop-ify him.
Spam-icize him.

55
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,920
- Link sausage-ize him!
- Squeal, piggy! Squeal!

56
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,200
No, screw that guy.

57
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,160
You'd really like to do that,
wouldn't you, Clyde?

58
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,440
- You're projecting, Marty.
- Projecting?

59
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,960
That's when you say something
that someone else...

60
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,880
You say that they want to do, when
you're the one who wants to do it.

61
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,480
No, no, no. That's good.
That's good.

62
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,960
Hold up, Rocky. Back up.
I got something for you.

63
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,600
Just a little...

64
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,240
- Oh, you son of a bitch!
- I was just projecting.

65
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,640
Oh, you asshole!

66
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,440
Later.

67
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,160
Wait up, man!

68
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,640
Let's go get some ice cream.

69
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,240
OK, Dave.

70
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,360
Hey!

71
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,880
Hey!

72
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,800
- Where were you guys?
- Get beat up today?

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,920
See any new scars?

74
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,760
- Got any more gum?
- I'm chewing the whole pack.

75
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,400
Why, you want some?

76
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,160
Tasty.

77
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,120
OK,

78
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,240
Jennifer Lopez or the girl
who sits behind you in school?

79
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,040
J. Lo.

80
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,720
OK, I think I got one.

81
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,400
Tie him to a tree,
pour some honey on his face,

82
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,120
and leave him there
all day and night.

83
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,400
- Why?
- It's for the bugs,

84
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,000
so they'd get on him
and bite him.

85
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,400
- No, we can't do that.
- Why not?

86
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,640
Well, what if a bear came?

87
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,680
Shut up.

88
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,400
You know,

89
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,800
if we hurt him,
we'd be just as bad as him.

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,160
So we need to hurt him
without really hurting him.

91
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,960
I mean, if you could think
of something like that, then...

92
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,880
Then what?

93
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
I don't know.

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,080
All right, Heather Locklear

95
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,280
or Shannen Doherty?

96
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,800
Don't know who
Heather Locklear is.

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You don't...? Dude!

98
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,480
So, what do you say?

99
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,160
I think it's a totally wild plan.

100
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,280
It's also the only plan
my brother would agree to.

101
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,200
He's just a little fucking
Gandhi, isn't he?

102
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,760
Like a fucking white
Martin Luther King.

103
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,240
All we need now is a boat.

104
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,320
Hey, my neighbor's got a boat
in her back yard that she never uses.

105
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,800
- Does that mean you're in?
- Do you actually think he'll go for it?

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,880
Oh, please. George'll get a hard-on
as soon as he picks up the phone.

107
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,080
Rock will throw on some of
that "sweet boy" charm of his.

108
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,080
Kid's desperate. Stupid.
It's human nature.

109
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,560
All I know is, is I'm getting a hard-on
just thinking about it.

110
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,280
Your mom don't need
the car Saturday, does she?

111
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,800
The only thing my mom needs
on Saturdays is Valium.

112
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,640
What do you think, Clyde?

113
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,880
Do we want to give Georgie Porgie a
little taste of his own medicine? Huh?

114
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,720
Be some good, clean fun,
don't you think?

115
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,320
Yeah, he deserves it, doesn't he?

116
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,360
If there's one thing
that can't be argued,

117
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,640
it's that that fat freak deserves
whatever he's got coming to him.

118
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Dude, what'd I tell you?

119
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,440
You don't smoke herb.

120
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,480
Yeah, so get it out of my face.

121
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,600
Faggot.

122
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,760
Clyde-o,

123
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,720
I'm just fucking with you.

124
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,200
You're not a faggot, all right?

125
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,280
OK?

126
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,280
Fist bump?

127
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,600
Fist bump?

128
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,000
OK, zero kilter.

129
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,680
Besides, I like your dads, Clyde.

130
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,560
I never knew any homosexual men
personally until I met them.

131
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,400
They're not so bad.

132
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't you think so, Rocky?

133
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,360
Clyde, don't worry about Marty.

134
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,280
It's just B.S.

135
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,000
OK? Come on. It's B.S.

136
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,640
OK? It's B.S.! B.S.! Come on!

137
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,520
OK?

138
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,400
Hello? George?

139
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,880
Hey, hey. This is Rocky Maris,
Sam's older brother.

140
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,880
Yeah. I got your number
off the call list.

141
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,200
Is that OK? Great.

142
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,360
Well, what I wanted to call
you about was...

143
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,640
Is that I'm inviting you to...
To a party for Sam.

144
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,720
Now, I know that you two have
been having some trouble lately.

145
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,920
But you know what?

146
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,920
He's always talking about
how cool you are.

147
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,440
And it would really mean a lot
to him if you could come.

148
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,080
It's his birthday.

149
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,160
It's on Saturday at noon.

150
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,000
We can pick you up if you'd like.

151
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,920
We're going boating.
We're going on a boating trip.

152
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,880
You like boating?

153
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,040
Yeah, awesome.
So the only thing

154
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,160
that I can really ask you to do,
is not tell too many people.

155
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,960
Because we didn't really invite
a lot of people, and...

156
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,920
And, you know, everyone knows
everybody in this town.

157
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,360
And you tell your parents,

158
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,360
parents will tell other parents,
and those parents will tell their kids.

159
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,440
And pretty soon everyone
who didn't get invited

160
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,720
will be sitting at home, crying.
We don't want that, do we?

161
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,080
There you go.
So do you want me to pick you up

162
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,520
at noon? Awesome!

163
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,120
So I will see you at noon, George.

164
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,840
Awesome. Have a great day. Bye.

165
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,280
- Oh, God.
- What did he say?

166
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,680
He said he would love to go.

167
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,000
He'd love to go.

168
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
Oh, I'd love to go.

169
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,960
I'd love to... If you could just...

170
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,160
I'd love, love, love to go.

171
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,520
Oh, I'd love to go! Come here.

172
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,560
- Say "uncle."
- Uncle.

173
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,360
- Uncle who?
- Uncle Martini!

174
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,480
Kiss my ass, Mr. Shaham.

175
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,440
Kiss my ass, Mr. Estes.

176
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,200
Kiss my ass, Ms. Johnson.

177
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,080
Kiss my ass, Mr. Rosenthal.

178
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,560
Shit.

179
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Hey! What's up with my shooter,
twerp face.

180
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,280
Target practice.

181
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,560
It's 11 a.m. In the morning
for chrissakes.

182
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,320
Most people are doing cartwheels
by 11, Kile.

183
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,360
Aren't you supposed to be
in school?

184
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,960
Fuck school.

185
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,680
I don't see you in school.

186
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,720
And besides, you're not Dad.

187
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,880
Come here.

188
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,040
Come here!

189
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,400
Yeah, you're right, I'm not Dad.

190
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
Dad didn't yank as hard as I do.

191
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,600
I don't really want to hear about Dad,
you understand?

192
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,120
- You understand?
- Yes.

193
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,240
Now, hand me my gun.

194
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,760
Look, stupid.

195
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,360
You ever take this
without my permission again,

196
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,360
I guarantee it, you'll be sorry.

197
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,000
- You understand?
- Yeah.

198
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,160
- You get it?
- Yes.

199
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,440
Kiss my ass, Kile.

200
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,080
Things to say to Sam
on our date.

201
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,280
One.

202
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,000
So...

203
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,360
Sam, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?

204
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,240
Two.

205
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,640
Are you happy

206
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,680
or sad

207
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,640
that we're leaving
Rollins next year?

208
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,440
Three.

209
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,000
So, what's your father do
for a living again?

210
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,640
Oh, he has a car-stereo company.

211
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,880
Do you believe in God?

212
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,160
That's a weird question.

213
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,320
So, what's it like being a male?

214
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,640
OK, stupid question.

215
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,680
My name is George.

216
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,440
This is the inside of my mind.

217
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,720
This is my mother.

218
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,880
My mom works out every day.

219
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,760
And this is my street.

220
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,040
This is the street I live on.

221
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,560
- What are we doing?
- You're gonna like this.

222
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,240
Isn't that George Tooney?

223
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,920
Yeah, he's coming
to the river with us.

224
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,800
- Why?
- Sammy, don't you tell

225
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
your girlfriend nothing?

226
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,920
- What's he talking about, Sam?
- You should've told her, Sam.

227
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,040
All right, everyone.
He's coming. Be nice to him.

228
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,040
Millie, it's supposed to be part
of the surprise. We...

229
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,680
Happy birthday, Sammy.

230
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,920
Hi, George.
Glad you could make it.

231
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,680
You know everybody?

232
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,120
- Yeah, sure. Hey, everybody.
- Hey.

233
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,000
- What's happening, George?
- Hey, Georgie.

234
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,880
- Hi, George.
- Hey, Millie.

235
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,840
We ready?

236
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,520
- What are you doing?
- Making a documentary.

237
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,200
- Of what?
- Of things.

238
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,360
Like Sam opening his present.
Go ahead and open it.

239
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,400
Yeah, Sam, go ahead and open it.

240
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,920
You already opened
all your other presents at home.

241
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,360
Stream Machine's top of the line.

242
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,120
I have one at home,
so we can have a war sometime.

243
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,680
- Isn't it excellent?
- Oh, yeah, thank you, George.

244
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,440
You must've blown your whole
allowance on that thing, huh, George?

245
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,800
How much you bagging
a week now, 40, 50 bucks?

246
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,920
It's very sweet of you, George.

247
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,120
I got it at Funco.

248
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,680
- You can return it if you want.
- Oh, no, it's perfect.

249
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,520
Well...

250
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,840
...it's a beautiful day
for a boat trip with some buddies.

251
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,280
Hey, Marty?

252
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,120
My mom made me sign
one of those contracts.

253
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,240
It's just, like... You know, I'm not
allowed to get in a car with a driver

254
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
- who's been drinking.
- Oh, it's cool.

255
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,280
My mom gave me permission
to drink and drive.

256
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,520
- You don't have to worry about it.
- Your mom must be pretty stupid

257
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,680
to give you permission
to drive inebriated.

258
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,520
No, you're right, George.
My mom is pretty stupid.

259
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,600
In fact, she's got one of those
learning-disability things.

260
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,920
Must be a bad LD.

261
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,320
I have an LD,

262
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,240
but I should know you're
not supposed to drive drunk.

263
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,600
I see stuff all backwards and shit.

264
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,600
Like, instead of seeing "stop"
on a stop sign,

265
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,960
I see "pots."

266
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,840
My doctor says it's

267
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,040
a genetic variation,
like for evolution.

268
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,080
So maybe I'm a superior being.

269
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,680
The future of the race.

270
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,680
Like, if aliens came down
and they had a...

271
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,440
A language,
a super-advanced language,

272
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,480
that said you had to read
this way to that way,

273
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,600
instead of that way
to this way.

274
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,040
Shit.

275
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,800
Yo, kidlings.

276
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,840
What are you guys doing here?

277
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,440
Eating mini beef tacos.

278
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,920
Finest mini beef tacos
in the world here.

279
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,080
Yummy.

280
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,000
What, did you steal
Mom's car again?

281
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,040
- Why do you care?
- I don't give a fuck.

282
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,080
Who's the minors?

283
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,000
It's just my brother
and some of his friends.

284
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,120
What are the paddles for?

285
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,560
We're going cow spanking.

286
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,400
Cow spanking, what's that?

287
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,120
It's like cow tipping,

288
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,440
only we spank.

289
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,520
Really.

290
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,560
Come on, let's just get the smokes
and get out of here.

291
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,160
Camels.

292
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,680
While you boys are out
cow spanking,

293
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,400
Kile and I are gonna go
pussy hunting.

294
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,400
- Good for you, Jasper.
- Hey, don't get sassy with my boy.

295
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,720
You ever been pussy hunting?

296
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,840
No, I didn't think so.

297
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,080
You know how I knew?

298
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,920
Because you gotta have some bait
to catch one.

299
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,800
That's great.

300
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,360
Grow up, Jasper.
Let's go, Marty.

301
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,520
Jesus, Jasper.
Why do you have to...?

302
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,880
Dumb fucks.

303
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,480
Why do you have
to act so retarded?

304
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,480
Have fun cow spanking, boys.

305
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,760
- Oh, man. That was awesome.
- You see that shit?

306
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,080
- So whose road is this?
- It's just a road.

307
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,400
Hey, you guys ever hear about

308
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,040
when Rocky and I
were kicking it out here?

309
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,760
We got some poison oak
on our hands.

310
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,640
This is a disgusting story.

311
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,480
Anyway, so we were out here,

312
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,440
and we got some poison oak
on our hands.

313
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,320
With all the beers we were drinking,

314
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,560
well, naturally,
we had to take a piss.

315
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,600
Now, I don't know
if you're hip, Millie,

316
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,720
but when a guy pisses,

317
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,400
he has to hold his pisser
in his hands.

318
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,000
- Like so:
- Thanks, Marty.

319
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,680
No, wait, I'm not finished yet.

320
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,080
Next morning when we woke up,

321
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,040
we both had totally chapped,
rash-y nuts.

322
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,160
Hey, lucky you didn't run out
of toilet paper,

323
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,960
have to wipe your butt
with your hand.

324
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,560
Ouch, ouch!
I just got stung by something.

325
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,160
- You all right?
- Yeah.

326
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,520
You guys just go ahead.

327
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,360
Better make sure it's not a tick.

328
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,120
Lyme's disease, you know.

329
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,200
Look, all right, there'll be three circles
around the bite if it's Lyme's disease.

330
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,960
But, like, you gotta watch out
because you could

331
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,880
just straight drop dead
from Lyme's disease.

332
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,520
Thanks, George.

333
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,800
Oh, if it is a tick and it gets dug in,

334
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,520
we might need to take my tweezers

335
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,120
and, like, put it under a flame
until it gets, like, red hot,

336
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,920
and then burn the thing to death
so it'll let go before we pull it out.

337
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,920
Can you leave us alone
for a second?

338
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,480
Thanks.

339
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,560
Seems like George is having
a good time.

340
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,440
What are you trying
to say, Clyde?

341
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,760
Fat boy's gonna get
what he's got coming.

342
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,680
I don't see a stinger.

343
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,840
Sam, what's going on here
with George?

344
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,640
Oh, it's nothing bad.
It's just a joke.

345
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,320
What kind of joke?

346
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,960
Well...

347
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,080
...we're planning on stripping him,
throwing him in the river,

348
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,480
and then we're gonna make him
run home naked.

349
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,520
- We have a plan. It involves a dare.
- A dare?

350
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,280
Yeah. See, the only reason
I didn't tell you before...

351
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,560
Who said I wanted to be
part of this?

352
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,600
All right, what about this?

353
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,040
What's that?

354
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,560
"If you could snap your fingers
right now,

355
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,120
"and he would drop dead
in his tracks, would you do it?"

356
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,440
- It's totally mean, Sam.
- He's mean.

357
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,560
He's a stupid fat kid.

358
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,440
He's got problems.

359
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,920
But he's obviously...

360
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,800
Promise me you won't
do anything to him.

361
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
It's not just me.

362
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,520
Promise, or I go back to the car.

363
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,840
All right, I promise.

364
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,200
I'll tell Rocky.

365
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,720
Can't wait to get her on the river
and start paddling.

366
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,840
- Hey, Rock, you wanna go untie us?
- Sure.

367
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,200
- There any life jackets?
- No, I don't think we'll need them.

368
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,480
Come on, sweetheart.
Gotta learn to live life on the edge.

369
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,320
He doesn't smoke, Marty.

370
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,040
Why don't you speak
for yourself, faggot?

371
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,240
I gotta keep my eye on you.

372
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,680
These are really strong.

373
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,520
Come on, Rock,
he's not such a bad guy.

374
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,000
He's acting like a nice guy, Sam.

375
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,080
In reality, he's not.

376
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,040
You a...

377
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,440
You a cigarette virgin, George?

378
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,400
No. No, I'm not, man.

379
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,240
I've smoked before.

380
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,800
I... No, I once cold smoked

381
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,880
an entire pack
of American Spirit Menthols.

382
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,200
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

383
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,200
What if I told you American Spirit
doesn't make menthols?

384
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,520
They don't?

385
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,320
It's OK if you've never
smoked before, George. I never have.

386
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,400
Well, I have.
All right, I'm not lying.

387
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,640
You know, maybe they weren't
menthols, but they were definitely

388
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,080
- American Spirits.
- Right.

389
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,000
The only reason why
he's being nice to us

390
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,960
is because he sees this as
an opportunity to get something.

391
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,520
To get friends.
Everybody wants that.

392
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,440
OK, what if you were
his friend, Sam?

393
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,280
I mean, he'd still go around school,
beating everybody else up.

394
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,200
And that's actually
if you'd be his friend.

395
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,480
I don't care what you say.
I don't wanna do it.

396
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,480
- Millie thinks it's a bad idea too.
- Oh, well, if Millie thinks...

397
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,320
- Millie thinks what's a bad idea?
- Nothing.

398
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,080
You pansies untie the knot yet?

399
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,120
Chop, chop, come on.

400
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,400
Hey.

401
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,040
Hey, Rock, you know,
I got a knife

402
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,800
that'll slice through that
like butter.

403
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,120
That's OK, George.

404
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,000
I think we got it.

405
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,920
Well, it's got, like, a bone saw,

406
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,160
scissor, pick ax,
I mean, everything.

407
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,280
It's OK, George.

408
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,920
OK.

409
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,880
I'll talk to Marty about it, OK?

410
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,920
Give me your oar.

411
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,520
- Nice.
- Thank you, George.

412
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,320
Yeah, I once skipped
a rock on this lake,

413
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,880
it skipped, like,
a thousand times.

414
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,880
Let's get her in the water.

415
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,200
Aye, aye, capitan.

416
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,400
Calling off the plan.
I'll tell you later.

417
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,080
It's all taken care of.

418
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,080
Hey! You guys should take
your shoes off

419
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,680
if you don't want
to get them wet.

420
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,840
Too late. They're soaked.

421
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,600
This is gonna be fun,
don't you think?

422
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,280
Yeah. But whoever didn't
bring life jackets

423
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,880
on a boat trip's a moron.

424
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,200
Hey, you know
I have athlete's foot?

425
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,240
- Get in.
- You are so disgusting.

426
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,800
Oh, my gosh.

427
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,880
Row, two, three, four!

428
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,280
One, two, three, four...

429
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,520
Sam loves it, don't you lie

430
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,160
Rocky is a pimp

431
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,920
Clyde is a fag

432
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,640
Yeah, you love it, don't you?

433
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,920
He spit all over the lens.

434
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,880
Shut up, Rocky, this is
what's gonna get me on MTV.

435
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,240
You need go-go dancers.

436
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,920
This is expensive.

437
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,440
OK, now you have to stop.

438
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,960
Send your donations
to George Tooney, Oregon.

439
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,080
Love one.

440
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,320
I always thought I was really
talented in that sense.

441
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,680
You agree, right? Up top.
Maybe later.

442
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,480
I'm glad the way
this day's turning out.

443
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,400
It's a nice day.

444
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,360
Yeah, if nothing else,
it's a nice day.

445
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,840
Can you guys taste
how sweet the air is?

446
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,000
Smells like cherry blossom.

447
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,360
How do you know what
cherry blossoms smell like, George?

448
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,480
It's obvious.

449
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,720
I don't know.

450
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,200
What is a cherry blossom?

451
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,920
It's the blossom on a cherry.

452
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,480
No, I thought it was
its own kind of plant.

453
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,240
What do you think, Marty?

454
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,560
I think I'm bored as fuck.

455
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,760
I also think I got some more beer
in my pack.

456
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,360
- Anyone want one?
- Yeah.

457
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,160
- You drinking, Sammy?
- Yeah, sure.

458
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,880
I thought you...
Didn't you want a beer?

459
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,080
Hey, Sammy.

460
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,480
If you're really feeling
like a party animal...

461
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,480
...you wanna smoke
a birthday doobie?

462
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,080
Sam doesn't smoke weed, Marty.

463
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,080
- Rocky, chill out.
- There's younger people

464
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,400
- on this trip, Marty.
- All right, fuck-face, calm down.

465
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,840
- I've been stoned before.
- Oh, yeah?

466
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,080
Yeah. Yeah. I smoked a whole blunt
myself once. Yup.

467
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,920
I... I hallucinated that there was...

468
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,800
There was a little blue guy
on my shoulder,

469
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,080
fucking tap dancing.

470
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,880
But, no, I don't smoke weed
after that,

471
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,480
because, like, my doctor says
it stunts your growth.

472
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,480
- So I'm waiting until I'm 24.
- Yeah.

473
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,920
Because, you know, that's when
you stop growing.

474
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,160
Have you ever been stoned, Millie?

475
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,000
Would you please get that
out of my face?

476
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,520
All right, go ahead, turn it off.

477
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,120
Sure is a beautiful river.

478
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,760
Oh, you guys, look!

479
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,680
- What?
- What?

480
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,120
What?

481
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,960
I thought I saw a water snake.

482
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,840
Sam.

483
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,480
Millie.

484
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,080
Thanks.

485
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,880
- Here.
- Thanks.

486
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,520
All that boating really gets
your appetite up.

487
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,200
You've just been sitting in the boat.

488
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,160
I've been shifting my weight
the whole time,

489
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,520
trying to keep us level.

490
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,400
Yeah, you've really been
working hard.

491
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,080
As if your pussy ass
has been doing anything.

492
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,600
Did you make these yourself?

493
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,560
You'II... You'll have to give me
the recipe sometime.

494
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,880
It's peanut butter and jelly.

495
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,800
Oh, yeah.

496
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,720
Nothing beats a good piss
in the river.

497
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,880
Except, of course,
a good romping session

498
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,480
of a stupid, ugly, dumb,
pathetic piece of shit.

499
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,480
- Yeah, we gotta talk about that.
- Yeah?

500
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,800
What's to talk about?

501
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,880
I want to call it off.

502
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,880
I'm not laughing.

503
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,760
I'm dead serious.

504
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,400
Wait a minute.

505
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,800
First, you get me all juiced up.

506
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,080
You make me steal my mom's car.

507
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,920
You get me out here
on a Saturday

508
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,240
when I could be at home
watching TV.

509
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,040
- Marty, come on.
- Then you have me steering

510
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,880
the fucking Titanic all across the river
with a bunch of munchkins

511
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,600
who are totally sober
and bringing me down.

512
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,640
Now, you mean to tell me
we don't even get to do

513
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,280
what we came out here for?

514
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,360
I had no idea the guy
was gonna turn out so nice.

515
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,960
Check it out, Rock,
he's not nice!

516
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,360
He's a spoiled, retarded punk
who beat up your brother.

517
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,320
OK, maybe I feel a little sorry
for him now.

518
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,040
OK, well, then I'm gonna
give you two choices:

519
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,160
You're either hard as hell
and you're yanking my chain,

520
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,560
or you're the limpest dick
I've ever met in my life.

521
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,000
- Everyone wants to call it off.
- Well, everyone is a vagina!

522
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,800
You don't even have
a real grudge against him.

523
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,960
If you were any kind
of a good brother,

524
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,440
you wouldn't let Sammy boy
get the shit kicked out of him

525
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,400
and then stroke the beater-upper's dick
all day long.

526
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,440
- Just remember the plan's off.
- Yeah.

527
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,840
I just wonder if,
when push came to shove,

528
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,680
if you'd have my back.

529
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,440
Hey, Clyde.

530
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,480
Remember when you were in the
fourth grade, and I was in third, and I...

531
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,760
I smacked you across the face
with a bat?

532
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,640
- How could I forget?
- Maybe you had that thing

533
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,720
where you forget
from getting hit in the head.

534
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,800
- Amnesia?
- Yeah.

535
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,160
Anyway, I was trying to remember.

536
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,360
- Why'd I do it?
- I don't know.

537
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,640
You must've done something.

538
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,960
No, I never do anything to anybody.

539
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,920
That's stupid.
Of course you do.

540
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,840
Look, it's not stupid, George.
You just attacked me.

541
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,760
A kid doesn't just attack
for no reason.

542
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,800
You always attack for no reason.

543
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,280
I know it's your birthday, Sam,
but shut your trap.

544
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,960
Hey! You pussies done
with your sammies?

545
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,760
Does it look like we're done
with our sandwiches?

546
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,840
Yeah, I'm gonna get the boat
back in the water.

547
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,960
You ladies can join me
whenever you want.

548
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,840
Why'd you drop the anchor?

549
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,560
Because I felt like it.

550
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,120
Hey, Sammy.

551
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,640
What you say we bust out
that Stream Machine.

552
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,920
- Yeah, OK.
- Clyde, can you give it to me?

553
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,200
All right.

554
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,600
Put that away.

555
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,880
All right, first, we must charge
the propulsion system.

556
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,280
And then take aim
and run a preliminary test.

557
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,720
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

558
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,120
Don't fucking squirt
that thing at me again!

559
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,040
Hey, what do you guys say
we play some Truth or Dare?

560
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,280
Yeah. Yeah, I love that game.

561
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,520
- OK, then, let's do it.
- Let's not.

562
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,360
People's feelings always end up hurt
when we play this game.

563
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,760
Yeah, she's right.

564
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,600
God, Sam and Millie

565
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,080
are a couple of little
wet pussies, aren't they?

566
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,120
Clyde, do you wanna start?

567
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,560
I don't know. I'm kind of with
Millie and Sam on this one.

568
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,640
Pussy number one,
pussy number two,

569
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,000
pussy number three.

570
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,920
Go ahead, Clyde. Start the game.

571
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,280
OK, then.

572
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,200
Rocky, truth or dare?

573
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,520
Truth.

574
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,840
All right, I want you to tell us,

575
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,880
in 20 words or more,

576
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,440
what you were thinking
the last time you beat off.

577
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,840
Susie Johnson.

578
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,520
But that's...
That's not even 20 words.

579
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,280
It's, like, two.

580
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,800
OK, I imagined that
she followed me into the locker room,

581
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,240
went into the stall.

582
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,880
She got on her knees.
I sat on the toilet.

583
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,960
- That's 20.
- All right, Rocky, it's your turn.

584
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,040
OK, Sammy. Truth or dare?

585
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,440
Dare.

586
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,280
I dare you to French kiss
Millie for ten seconds.

587
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,160
Man.

588
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,840
It's pretty exciting.

589
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,240
- It's OK.
- What? It's OK.

590
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,040
Wait, did you hear that?
It's OK.

591
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,040
She wants it.

592
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,640
This is what I paid for? Come on!

593
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,400
- Come on!
- Let's go!

594
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,720
I want my money back.

595
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,760
OK. There you go.

596
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,760
There you go! Ten.

597
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,400
Nine,

598
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,880
eight, seven,

599
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,240
six, five,

600
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,720
four, three,

601
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,760
two...

602
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,880
Oh, shit. Oh, man.

603
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,440
Yo, Rock. Rock, I just had
an amazing flash

604
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,840
of what your brother and Millie would
look like all hot and bothered in bed.

605
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,400
- That's gross.
- Sammy, go. It's your turn.

606
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,360
Wait, wait, maybe... Maybe we
shouldn't call him Sammy anymore.

607
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,280
Maybe we should call him
"lover boy."

608
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,000
OK, then.

609
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,600
Marty.

610
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,200
- Truth or dare?
- Dare.

611
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,760
All right.

612
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,960
I dare you to pull down
your pants and your underwear,

613
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,120
and show us that famous dick of yours
for at least ten seconds.

614
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,520
Ten seconds.
Wow, you are a killer, Sam.

615
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,080
All right, I will do it,

616
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,800
because I am proud of my boys.
But if I do,

617
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,840
I don't want anyone else
wimping out on their dares.

618
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,720
So let's see the penis.

619
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,640
- Bring on the penis!
- All right.

620
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,360
Millie, close your eyes.
Marty doesn't want to go to jail.

621
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,800
No cameras.

622
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,840
We ready?

623
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,440
That's sick.

624
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,640
- Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
- Oh! OK. OK.

625
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,360
All right.
You fucking asshole.

626
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,760
- It was hairy as a chimp!
- Yeah, was it?

627
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,400
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

628
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,280
It looked like a giant frog.

629
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,280
All right, assholes.
That was pretty funny, douche bag.

630
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,840
- At first I thought it was all deformed,
- Thank you.

631
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,160
- Because it was just so fucking ugly.
- OK. All right.

632
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,280
Have you gotten out
all your stupid chuckles yet?

633
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,640
Have I gotten out all
my stupid chuckles? No!

634
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,640
All right. Well, whenever you're done,
let me know, because it's my turn next.

635
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,240
"Whenever you're done, let me know,
because it's my turn next."

636
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,800
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, well, what are you doing?

637
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,440
- Stop imitating me.
- "Stop imitating me."

638
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,840
- Enough is enough!
- "Enough is enough!"

639
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,640
Is that what your dad says to you?

640
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,280
You don't know shit about my father.

641
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,200
If you ever say anything
about my father again, I will kill you.

642
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,520
Do you understand?

643
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,680
Marty, I...

644
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,520
I was just messing around with you.

645
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,400
OK, messing boy.

646
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,000
I dare you to strip butt naked
and jump in the river.

647
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,040
Marty, leave him alone.

648
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,720
I did my dare.

649
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,400
Now he does his.
Those are the rules, Clyde.

650
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,680
Marty, why don't you
just calm down?

651
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,560
- OK, the game's over.
- The game'll be over in a minute!

652
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,800
Right after fat-ass here takes
his clothes off and gets in the bath.

653
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,160
Chill out, Marty, all right?

654
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,080
Because you know what?
I didn't even pick dare, all right?

655
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,320
I pick truth.

656
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
You want a truth?

657
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,680
OK, I'll give you a truth.

658
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,200
The truth is, lard-fart,

659
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,480
is that we didn't invite you out here
because we've been secretly in love

660
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,920
- with you all these years.
- Marty, don't do this.

661
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,040
We invited you out here
because you smacked Sammy boy

662
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,280
- right there in the cranium.
- Marty, stop.

663
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,760
So we came up with a plan
to mess you up.

664
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,480
Is that true, Sam?

665
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,440
Yeah.

666
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,240
But then we changed our minds
because we liked you.

667
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,840
Wait, you...? You tricked me?

668
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,760
Yes, we tricked you.

669
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,040
And, yes, all these suckers here
changed their minds,

670
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,200
but I didn't change mine.

671
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,800
I'm a man who likes to
follow through with his plans.

672
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,440
What have you been planning?

673
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,320
We were planning
on stripping you,

674
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,440
throwing you in the river,
then making you run home naked.

675
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,760
- It's not funny.
- Oh, it's super-duper funny to me.

676
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,400
- I'm sorry, George.
- You're not sorry!

677
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,440
I'm sorry.

678
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,200
Is...? Is it even your birthday?

679
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,880
No.

680
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,640
You're a fucking lying
son of a bitch, Sam!

681
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,880
All right? And I hope you
fucking go to hell!

682
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,520
- Don't make things worse, George.
- Shut the fuck up, Millie.

683
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,640
You fucking stupid JAP cunt!

684
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,440
Sit down, George.
You're out of control.

685
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,080
Shut the fuck up, Clyde!
You faggot!

686
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,320
Fucking skinny,
butt-munching faggot!

687
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,280
I hate you, you know that?
I really do!

688
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,600
Because all you do is
fucking prance around school,

689
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,120
talking about your fucking
faggoty, fairy fathers!

690
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,960
I'll tell you what!
I don't want to hear

691
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,680
about your fucking fathers
and how their assholes work.

692
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,560
All right? It makes me sick!

693
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,360
And I... I fucking hope they
fucking die of fag disease!

694
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,520
Yeah!

695
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,440
And... And speaking
of dead fathers...

696
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,640
...I just remembered
why bonehead, white-trash,

697
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,760
fucking donkey-dick Marty
got so fucking freaked

698
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,880
when I started talking
about his daddy.

699
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,520
His Neanderthal

700
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,640
drunk dad put a gun in his mouth

701
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,560
and splattered his brains
all over the wall.

702
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,280
You know, I almost forgot
that my mom told me that.

703
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,320
She said, "His daddy splattered
his brains all over the wall."

704
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,920
I thought it was sad at first.
But, now, I like it.

705
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,920
His daddy splattered
his brains

706
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,120
all over the wall.

707
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,680
- His daddy splattered his brains
- Shut up, George.

708
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,360
- All over the wall.
- George, come on. Shut up.

709
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,520
His daddy splattered his brains
all over the wall!

710
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,240
- Stop it, George!
- All over the wall!

711
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,240
- His daddy splattered his brains
- No one talks to people like that.

712
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,240
- All over the wall!
- Shut the fuck up, George!

713
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,800
- Shut the fuck up!
- All over the wall!

714
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,760
All over the wall!
His daddy splattered his brains

715
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,320
- Shut up!
- All over the wall!

716
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,720
- Marty!
- Stop it!

717
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,320
- Marty! George!
- All over the wall!

718
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,200
Shut the fuck up!

719
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,800
- Help! Help!
- That's what happens

720
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,640
when you fuck with Martini Blank!

721
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,680
- Help, help! Please!
- Martini Blank's friends back him up.

722
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,040
- That's what friends do, fuck-o.
- Help!

723
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,840
- Help! Help! Help!
- That's why you're in the water.

724
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,560
- Because you've got none.
- Help! Fucker!

725
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,560
Help!

726
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,600
Help! Help!

727
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,360
Help! Help!

728
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,120
Please help.

729
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,320
Shit, you guys,
he's not coming up!

730
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,520
Help!

731
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,240
Guys, help, now! Hurry!

732
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,640
Get him up.

733
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,480
George.

734
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,000
- Oh, shit.
- Do you know what you're doing?

735
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,640
One, two, three, four...

736
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,720
Help!

737
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,200
Help!

738
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,280
Help!

739
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,600
Can anyone help us?

740
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,960
- Help!
- One, two, three, four.

741
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,520
One, two, three, four.

742
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,240
Come on.

743
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,000
Wake up. Come on, wake up!

744
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,280
Wake up.

745
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,880
Shit.

746
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,880
Wake up!

747
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,520
Wake up!

748
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,520
Wake up! God, wake up!

749
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,200
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

750
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,680
Wake up, wake up!

751
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,600
Wake up! Wake up,
wake up, wake up!

752
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,320
Wake up!

753
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,240
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you!

754
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,360
We can never be forgiven
for what we did.

755
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,520
You didn't do anything.

756
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,960
I don't wanna be here.

757
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,560
I don't wanna be here.

758
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,680
I wanted to kill him before
I threw him over. Now he's dead.

759
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,720
Maybe this was his time to go.

760
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,840
Maybe it was his fate.

761
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,520
Why would it be his fate?

762
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,520
Because everything happens
for a reason, Rock.

763
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,640
I don't know.

764
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,280
I'm sorry.

765
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,440
I'm sorry.

766
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,160
I'm sorry.

767
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,240
Anybody know what time it is?

768
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,560
What if we say
we were playing Truth or Dare,

769
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,760
and then we dared him
to jump into the river,

770
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,760
and he did, and he drowned.

771
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,760
What the hell are you doing?

772
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,680
Looking for his fucking
video camera.

773
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,000
If it gets found, then everybody
finds out what we did.

774
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,480
Everyone's gonna find out
what we did,

775
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,320
regardless if the video camera
gets found, Marty.

776
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,600
Not if we don't want them to.

777
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,000
Are you joking?

778
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,560
Look, this was a prank that went
wrong. We come completely clean.

779
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,320
No one's got a ton of sympathy
for guys who throw fat kids in the river.

780
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,400
All right? If we turn ourselves in,
we're all screwed.

781
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,320
What do you think's
gonna happen, Marty?

782
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,040
Superman's gonna fly around
Earth and turn back time?

783
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,640
No. I don't think Superman's
going to turn back time.

784
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,960
Think we gotta bury the body.

785
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,760
Rocky, if we bury the body, it's gonna
look like we did it on purpose.

786
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,840
If we bury the body,
we're not gonna look like anything.

787
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,160
Out of sight, out of mind.

788
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,200
Yeah, well, maybe out of your mind,
you stupid fuck.

789
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,080
Look, we just committed
a major fucking crime.

790
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,480
And if any one of us cracks,
we are all gonna be screwed.

791
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,640
Look, it was an accident. Kids like us
have accidents all the time.

792
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,000
This wasn't just an accident.

793
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,160
All right? We schemed this,
from the beginning.

794
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,560
All right, so fine, we schemed.
No one has to know that.

795
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,680
They're gonna figure it out.

796
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,760
Somebody's bound to crack when
they start asking a million questions.

797
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,840
Put Sammy boy in a lie detector.

798
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,360
Look, the idea
of burying the body is nuts.

799
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,360
Going to jail
and getting raped every night

800
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,720
for the rest of your cute,
little, fucking lives is nuts.

801
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,920
I think you're nuts.

802
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,040
So that's it?

803
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,480
We're just gonna pretend
like we're all innocent.

804
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,600
- Shut up.
- No.

805
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,840
- Shut up.
- No!

806
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,720
If you've got a better idea,
then you better spit it out

807
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,640
- because no one else does.
- Marty, come on.

808
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,280
- Do you have one?
- Shit, Marty. Get off. Come on.

809
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,360
If you've got a better idea,
I'll listen. Do you?

810
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,840
- No.
- Then do you agree

811
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,240
that we have to go
with the best idea we've got?

812
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,240
Yes. Get off.

813
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,320
You always gotta go
with the best idea you've got.

814
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,320
Otherwise you're just left

815
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,040
laying around
not knowing what to do.

816
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,880
I can't do it.

817
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,840
It's not safe.

818
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,520
It's a big joke anyway.

819
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,040
I think that's deep enough.

820
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,120
Hey, you guys wanna help?

821
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,400
First thing we gotta do
when we get back

822
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,520
is deal with Jasper
and my brother.

823
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,640
How?

824
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,760
Gotta make sure they forget
they ever saw George with us.

825
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,240
What the fuck
you gonna do? Huh?

826
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,960
Hit them over the head with a rock,
hope they get amnesia?

827
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,840
Thanks.

828
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,040
All right, this is the way
it's gonna work.

829
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,800
We drop everybody off
at their houses.

830
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,920
Everybody's gonna sit tight
until I go make sure

831
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,440
everything's "copathetic"
with Kile and Jasper.

832
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,280
The word's copacetic, Marty.

833
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,600
Yeah.

834
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,640
Millie...

835
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,760
...mum's the word.

836
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,240
Peg, can I get the phone?

837
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,240
Shit.

838
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,600
- Kile?
- Hey, Marty.

839
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,440
- What's cooking?
- Hey, you little fucker.

840
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,040
How'd the cow spanking go?

841
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,760
What?

842
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,760
Looks fantastic.

843
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,080
You OK?

844
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,640
You look a little...

845
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,840
No, I'm fine.

846
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:07,400
Clyde, if something's up,
it's OK to tell us about it.

847
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,880
This is so fucked.

848
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,400
Fuck!

849
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,280
I don't even know...

850
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,120
I don't even know.

851
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,360
Hey.

852
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,120
Maybe you guys
could take me home?

853
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,240
Wish we knew what to do.

854
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,760
We know what to do.

855
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,160
You know what we did, Rocky.

856
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,640
What are you trying to say, Sam?

857
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,920
You have to trust me
on this one, Sam.

858
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,720
I'm your big brother.

859
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,800
But I don't trust you.

860
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,600
Where you going?

861
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:07,960
What do you want?

862
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,840
To talk.

863
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,560
We have nothing to talk about.

864
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:16,200
It was your guys' plan.
I was just there.

865
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:19,280
That doesn't mean
I have to tell on you.

866
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,720
And that's your problem.

867
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,360
Are you done?

868
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,960
Can I come in?

869
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,320
Do you remember when you said
we could never be forgiven?

870
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,760
That might be right.

871
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,280
I don't know.

872
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:13,120
The only thing I do know is that
I'm not sure about anything.

873
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,320
What do you want us to do?

874
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,400
Go back and unbury the body?

875
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,680
He's dead.

876
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,360
You know...

877
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,400
...when we graduate
high school

878
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,600
and go to college and become doctors
and lawyers and all that...

879
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,880
...what do you think it'd be like?

880
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,520
- Hey.
- Hey, Marty.

881
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,240
- Good to see you.
- How you doing, Mr. Maris?

882
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,040
- How are you?
- I'm good.

883
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,960
Are...?
Is Rocky and Sam home?

884
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,680
Oh, yeah, yeah.
The whole gang's here.

885
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,360
They're listening to music
in the bedroom there.

886
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:36,240
- Do you mind if...? Thanks.
- Yeah, yeah.

887
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,360
What's going on here?

888
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,720
Why don't you sit down?

889
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,200
What, so I go off to make sure
all our business is taken care of,

890
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,440
and all of a sudden
you guys form a new club?

891
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:08,560
- We've come to a decision.
- You've come to a decision?

892
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,280
What, are you kidding me?

893
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,200
We already decided.
I talked to Jasper and Kile.

894
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,320
They're not gonna say anything.

895
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,600
Everything is going to be OK.

896
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,080
No. Everything is not
gonna be OK.

897
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,880
So, what?

898
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,600
All you guys decide to squeal
or something?

899
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,360
We have to, Marty.
It's the only way...

900
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:35,000
No, there is no "only way", Sam.
That's crap.

901
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,160
OK? You know that's crap.

902
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,680
All right.

903
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,680
Screw all of you, then.

904
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,440
- Marty, hang on.
- No!

905
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,280
- Where you going?
- Away from you.

906
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,440
You suck.

907
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,680
You know that, right?

908
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,720
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know, drive to Mexico.

909
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,120
What do you think?

910
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,000
I don't know what to think.

911
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,640
Well, if you don't know
what to think,

912
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,800
then you probably shouldn't
be making decisions.

913
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:18,840
What do you think about
letting me borrow your gun?

914
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,200
- Hey.
- Yeah.

915
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,080
Easy, man.

916
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,320
He was saying terrible things.

917
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,800
Things that shouldn't
have been said.

918
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,200
When your brother
knocked George overboard...

919
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,240
...would you say he was

920
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,600
in control

921
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,960
or out of control?

922
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,760
- You got something for me?
- Yeah.

923
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,160
Excuse me, Sam.

924
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,320
Never seen him
more out of control in my life.

925
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,240
My name is George.

926
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,480
And this...

927
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,480
...is the inside of my mind.

928
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:59,000
The inside of my mind
has a zillion things.

929
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:26,240
The inside of my mind
has a zillion things about it.

930
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,440
But...

931
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,720
...people that don't
see inside my mind

932
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:36,080
don't know there are
a zillion things and...

933
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,800
You know, since no one
sees inside my mind,

934
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,320
no one really knows.

935
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,600
But...

936
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,240
...one day people will know.

937
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:05,000
One day people will know
because that's my master plan.

938
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:13,400
To film it all.

939
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:19,280
To document every aspect
of the life that is me.

940
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,200
And put it in a time capsule
in my back yard.

941
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,800
And so that one day, some...

942
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,240
...alien,
or some highly evolved species,

943
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:33,240
will find it and...

944
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,400
understand.
