All right, goddamnit! Who shot me?

164
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,600
Oww! Fuck!
Who did it?!

165
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,700
What are you idiots looking at?
My goddamn foot´s blown off here!

166
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,000
Who shot me?

167
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,100
Her fella.

168
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,400
My husband.

169
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,800
Where is the son of a bitch?

170
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,400
He´s dead.

171
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
What?

172
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,500
What the fuck happened down here?

173
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,800
What? What?

174
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Look, it wasn´t me, all right?

175
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,100
lt was a f-fucking monster
or something!

176
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,300
l-l didn´t do nothin´.

177
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,700
One of their heads is over here.

178
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,400
Ow!

179
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,600
Yeah, that´s...

180
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,100
that´s definitely one for the wall.

181
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,900
Oh, my God.
What is that thing?

182
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,700
l have no--
l don´t know.

183
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,600
l don´t even know how l got here.
They were so fast.

184
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,700
That head used to be attached
to some huge, twisted body

185
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,000
like a rotting jackal or something,
like something out of a nightmare.

186
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,300
Of all the bars to be stuck in.

187
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,700
Anything else?

188
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,800
Yeah. We need to lock
this place down completely.

189
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,700
- ls everybody downstairs?
- My son--

190
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,400
- My son´s upstairs!

191
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500

192
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,300
Cody!

193
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Cody?

194
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,000
- Oh, God, no!
- Momy?

195
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,400
Cody! l am never gonna
let you be alone again.

196
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,200
All right, look,
we gotta lock this place up.

197
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,900
Look, come here.
You okay?

198
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,300
Yeah?
l´m so sorry.

199
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,000
l am never gonna let you--

200
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,100
Aaaah!

201
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,100
Aah! Get it off me!

202
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,400
Aah! God!

203
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,100
No!!!

204
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,500
No!

205
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,800
No!!!

206
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,100
No!

207
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,600
No!

208
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,300
No! No!

209
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,400
No!

210
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,600
Fuck! Aw!

211
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,000
Aw, God!

212
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,200
Somebody help me, man!

213
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,000
God damn! Ow!

214
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,300
Burnin´, man! Shit!

215
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,300
Get this shit off me, man!

216
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,300
- Come on in--
- Fuck!

217
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,200
Come on, l got a sink in here.
Come on.

218
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,700
- Come on.
- Where´d he go, man?

219
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
All right. Ohh!

220
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,900
God! Aah!

221
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,400
Was that the only phone?

222
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,500
Yep.

223
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,900
What about cell phones?

224
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,800
This is canyon country, honey.
lt ain´t gonna happen.

225
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,200
Well, we´ve got to
have something here, right?

226
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Just relax.
l´ve got a shortwave radio.

227
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,000
Except it´s...

228
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,100
upstairs there, somewhere.

229
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,600
This is bullshit.

230
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,400
What did you say to me?

231
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,000
l didn´t say anything, Flo.

232
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,200
How you doin´, buddy?
You holdin´ up?

233
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Bad! l´m doin´ bad!

234
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,600
- Fuck!
- lt´s green.

235
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,200
Yeah, l know!

236
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,800
You got any more water pressure?

237
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,900
- No, that´s all it´s got.
- Aw, fuck!

238
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,900
God, your sink sucks!

239
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,200
Oh, fu--oww!
The stuff´s up my nose, man!

240
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,700
Can you--can you feel it?

241
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,900
Just calm down, you goddamn pussy.
You´re all right.

242
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,300
l gotta go to the hospital, man.
l gotta fuckin´ leave, man.

243
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,300
l need a doctor, man.
l´m outta here.

244
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,900
l´m goin´ to the hospital.
l´m gettin´ my truck. l´m goin´.

245
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,100
- Just calm down, okay?
- No, you calm down.

246
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,200
Now, you can risk your life,
but not mine.

247
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,500
My daughter is out there
waiting for me.

248
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,100
l have just as much reason
to get out of this place as you do.

249
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,100
But l also have
the comon fuckin´ sense to know

250
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,900
that staying alive means
being in here and not out there.

251
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,100
Do you understand?

252
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,500
Do you understand me?!

253
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,400
Yeah--yeah. Got--got ya. Got ya.

254
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,300
Pull that tough-guy shit again,

255
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,200
l will slice you from your neck
to your nuts.

256
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,800
This is bullshit, man.
You can´t keep me here.

257
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,500
You fuckers can´t keep me here, man!
This is bullshit.

258
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,700
This is fuckin´ bullshit!

259
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,600
This is bullshit, man!

260
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,400
Fuck this.

261
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,600
...this shit off of me myself!

262
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,100
Act like you´ve had some.

263
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,200
- Oh, l´ve had some, baby.
- l haven´t.

264
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh, God.

265
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,600
That´s gonna stain.

266
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,300
We can´t risk letting them in.

267
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,400
Have they left? lt´s quiet.

268
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,300
No, they´re still out there.

269
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,100
They´re just listening to us.

270
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,900
We gotta start
clearin´ these bodies up.

271
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,800
Jesus Christ.

272
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,700
Oh, shit! Fuck!

273
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,900
- Come on! Come on!
- Easy, bud.

274
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,800
lt´s just a death rattle.

275
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,900
He´s gone, he just ain´t done
movin´ yet.

276
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Let´s wrap ´em up in tablecloths
and dump ´em in the basement.

277
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,300
All right?

278
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,700
- All right?
- All right.

279
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,400
Let´s lock this place down.

280
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,600
- Boo!
- Shit.

281
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,900
lt´s hungry again!
lt´s gonna eat us!

282
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,300
Just calm down, okay?
We have to kill this thing.

283
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,200
Fire in the hole.

284
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,400
How you like that,
you little bastard?

285
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,800
Ow!

286
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,100
God bless guns.

287
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,800
Aaahh!

288
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,800
Get this fuckin´ thing off me!

289
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,800
Aah!

290
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,700
Okay.

291
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,600
Jeez...

292
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,900
it took all that?

293
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,200
- All those bullets?
- That´s the little one?!

294
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,200
We can´t kill these things!
No way!

295
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,200
Look, we lave to fight these things.

296
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,600
We just have to be clever
about this, okay?

297
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,500
Maybe we don´t need to
fight them at all.

298
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,100
Yeah. Why don´t we
just call them names?

299
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,500
Fuckin´ genius.

300
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,900
We´re stuck here--
l can see this.

301
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:26,100
But what we need to do
is think outside the box.

302
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,500
We don´t need to fight them.
We need to scane them.

303
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,000
We need to scare them back.

304
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,200
This...

305
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,200
...is a species stand-off.

306
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,500
We just need to show them
that we are not vulnerable.

307
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,700
That we...are fonmidable.

308
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,100
How?

309
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,700
l need a stick.

310
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,500
Open up that ice chest.

311
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,200
God damn.

312
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,000
Oh, shit.

313
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,400
All right,
give me some room.

314
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,700
lt´s gnoss.

315
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,600
How old do you think
that thing is?

316
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,700
- Take one of the planks off the window.
- No way.

317
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Just one board. One minute.
lt´ll save your life. Just trust me.

318
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,100
- No.
- One board.

319
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,700
One minute. Home free.

320
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,000
Okay. Make it quick.

321
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,200
- You ready?
- Yeah.

322
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,300
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Showing superiority.

323
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,300
The scent of their dead
may drive them back.

324
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,000
- You see ´em?
- ls there like a call or something?

325
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,200
Come on, you
monkey motherfuckers!

326
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,200
Come on!!!

327
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,600
You can´t fuck with man!

328
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,000
Sweet.

329
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Whoa.

330
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,100
There´s two of ´em.

331
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,000
lt´s like they´re wearing
dead animals or something.

332
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,100
Hey! lt´s working!
You´re a genius.

333
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,900
See? What did l tell ya?

334
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,100
Wait. There´s a third.

335
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,600
lt´s like a family.
lt´s a goddamn family.

336
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,400
And we just killed their baby.

337
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,700
Holy shit! She ate it!

338
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,800
She didn´t even chew it, man.
She just swallowed it.

339
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,200
Oh, dear.

340
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,800
What? What´s he doing?

341
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,300
They´re humpin´!

342
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,000
Oh, man.

343
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,000
The monsters are
doin´ it doggie-style.

344
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,500
Monster sex.

345
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Where you goin´, boss?
You be careful, boss.

346
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,800
What is that?

347
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,400
Dude...took a dump.

348
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,100
No...it´s moving, stupid.

349
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,300
Ohh....spread out.

350
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,200
- God almighty!

351
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,500
lt´s one of the little bastards.

352
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,500
Any more ideas,
Animal Planet?

353
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,900
l was just bein´ proactive.

354
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,600
Hey, dipshit.
l didn´t see you workin´, did l?

355
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,500
Oh, go douche, Grandpa.

356
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:43,700
Well, what now? Huh?!

357
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,500
Well, what now? Huh?!

358
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
We´re stuck in here, that´s what.

359
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,100
lf you don´t mind me askin´...

360
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,000
how´d you run into these things?

361
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
We dnopped oun dauglten off
at my mom´s louse...

362
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,900
my little ginl Clanlie. My baby.

363
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,100
lt was only fon tle niglt.

364
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,800
Tlen suddenly... we lit it.

365
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,500
We lost contnol of tle can.
lt spun and flipped.

366
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,000
And l was tlnown fnom tle can.

367
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,400
lts lead was in tle noad.

368
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,300
Tlat´s wlen tley came.

369
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,300
lt´s road-kill revenge.

370
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,800
Well, l´d like to be the first
to thank you and your dead husband

371
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,900
for draggin´ this fuck fest
into my tavern.

372
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,100
The only thing we brought here
was a heads-up that saved your ass.

373
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,100
This is not my fault.

374
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,000
You pissed off the wrong clan, lady.

375
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,400
Maybe all they want´s you.

376
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,600
Maybe all they want´s the person that
ran over their old granddaddy in a car.

377
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,300
And maybe they can have you
on a silver platter,

378
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,800
apple in fuckin´ mouth.

379
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,500
You shoulda thought of that
before we killed their child

380
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,200
and stuck it outside on a pike.

381
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,000
No need to get menstrual.

382
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,800
That was a dumb fuckin´ idea, man.

383
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,500
Ow! Shit!

384
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,900
Fuck!

385
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,900
What the fuck´s happening, man?!
What the fuck is this shit?!

386
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,700
Just don´t touch it, okay?
Leave it alone.

387
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,600
- You´re making it worse.
- You tell me to leave it alone?

388
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,800
You get puked on by a monster

389
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,100
and you tell me
how that feels, huh?

390
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,100
l´m rottin´ here, and nobody
could give a shit!

391
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,700
l´m dying, all right?!

392
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,000
l´m fuckin´ dying!

393
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,100
l am upper-case fucked!

394
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
You don´t give a shit, man!

395
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,100
You don´t give a shit, either!

396
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,700
All you guys don´t fuckin´
care about me!

397
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,800
l don´t care.
Go suffer somewhere else.

398
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,500
Get the fuck away from me.

399
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,600
Ohh, God! Fuck, that hurts!

400
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,600
Look, somebody´s got
to know something about this.

401
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,800
This stuff doesn´t just
happen out of the blue.

402
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,600
You.

403
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,400
What?

404
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,300
- You know something.
- Huh?

405
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,200
- Yeah, you´re old. You´ve seen things.
- l don´t know anything.

406
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,200
- Easy, cowboy.
- Hey, back off me, Whitey!

407
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,100
l´m interrogating her.

408
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,000
She´s old.
Old people know things,

409
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,000
like legends and tall tales and shit.

410
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,400
No. No. Really,
l don´t know anything.

411
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,400
Come on, spill it.

412
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,400
- Spill it, or l´ll get rough.
- l don´t know anything!

413
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,900
Why don´t you ask him?
He´s old.

414
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,800
- Start diggin´.
- Ahh, sheesh.

415
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,000
Back off.
She doesn´t know anything.

416
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah, allegedly.

417
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,000
lt doesn´t matter where
they fucking came from.

418
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,900
They´re here. Either we kill them
or they kill us. That´s it.

419
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Hey, no offense, Xena...

420
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,700
but by the way things are going,
looks like we need another chief,

421
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,100
somebody that knows
the lay of the land,

422
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,200
somebody with a little moxie.

423
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Somebody like myself.

424
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,100
-Aah.
- Careful.

425
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,900
l think we´re gonna be all right.

426
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,100
l think we´re gonna be okay, guys.

427
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,400
Ohh!

428
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,000
Yeah. l think we´re
gonna be all right.

429
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:50,300
This is just some leaky barrel
radiation toxic dump waste

430
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,000
enviro-crap freak-beast accident
that crawled out of the sewer, man.

431
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,700
That´s all this is.
We´re gonna be all right.

432
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,400
l think the experts, they´re gonna be
showin´ up any minute to fix this up.

433
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,900
You know, some of those green guys?

434
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,500
Those guys with
the real can-do attitude and the tanks

435
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,200
and M-16s and torpedoes and--

436
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,400
Hey! Can you just give it a break?

437
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,900
Those guys are en noute.
You hear ´em?

438
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,100
They´re comin´.

439
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,800
- l wouldn´t do that if l were you.
- Yeah, be careful.

440
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,700
l don´t see a thing.
l can´t see a thing.

441
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,300
Aah! Aah!

442
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,200
Give me my eye back!!!

443
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,900
- Jeez!
- Ol.

444
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,200
Hm. Ahem.

445
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,800
Hm. Ahem.

446
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,900
Does everyone agree
that the monsters are still out there?

447
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,500
Huh, chief?
- Yeah, no slit. Sherlock.

448
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,000
l have some sweats
behind the bar in a...in a bag.

449
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,400
Tha-thank you.

450
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,600
- They coordinated that strike.
- Yeah, l know.

451
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,100
- l´m gonna need more shells.
- Yeah, tell me about it, missy.

452
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,600
A .45´s got six shots.

453
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,900
l got two refills.

454
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,500
- ln my locker in the basement l got--

455
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,000
...l got maybe some more shells.

456
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,500
Ah!

457
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,700
Jeez.

458
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,800
And...l got this.

459
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,800
Shhh...

460
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,000
...shit.

461
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,100
Honey, why don´t you just
leave the offense to us?

462
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,500
You need a whole lot more than that
to get out of here alive.

463
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,700
Oh, now you got
somethin´ to say.

464
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,000
You young´uns.
You worry about weapons.

465
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,500
- l´m thinkin´ strategy.
- Oh. And what´s that?

466
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,000
Sit still...
and look less like a meal.

467
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,500
That´s for bears and sharks,
Chunky Chew.

468
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,200
How do you tolerate him?

469
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,900
He´s an ass, but he´s my brother.

470
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,200
l´ve stood everywhere. Nothin´.

471
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,300
Didn´t you say you had a radio?

472
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,000
Upstairs, back of my closet.
Little slidin´ door.

473
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,500
- Channel 9´s the emergency frequency.

474
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,000
Have fun.

475
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:37,100
All right. l´m gonna go
to the basement for supplies.

476
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,100
And you--you´re going upstairs.

477
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,500
Heh.

478
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,500
Let´s not get carried away.

479
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,300
Step up, chief.
Ain´t you got a pair?

480
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,200
Watch it.

481
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,600
Yeah.

482
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,300
Okay, yeah. Shotgun.

483
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,300
All right, partner,
you´re comin´ with me.

484
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,500
Whoa. l don´t know about that, bub.

485
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,300
l mean, l ain´t exactly
no Billy the Kid.

486
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,400
Yeah, but you´re slow,
and that´s helpful.

487
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,700
Just stay close.
Who else is comin´?

488
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,400
l´ll go with ya.

489
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,500
What are you gonna do,
throw your teeth at ´em?

490
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,700
Just sit down, Cocoon.

491
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,200
You. You´re comin´ with me.

492
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,200
Keys.

493
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,200
- You´re locked in.
- What?

494
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,000
These two will be
on the other side waiting for you.

495
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,500
lf you become food,

496
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,300
l don´t want a set of keys in the belly
of one of those things.

497
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,400
Don´t get your hopes up.

498
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,900
Any volunteers
for the basement?

499
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,900
l´ll go.

500
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,500
All right. l don´t want to hear
any of this "Where is the key?"

501
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,000
"l dropped the key."
l want out. l want out.

502
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,000
You just find that fucking radio.

503
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,300
We´ll get you out.

504
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,200
We got your front, bro.

505
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,700
lt´s your "back."
"We got your back. "

506
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,900
Shit.

507
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,600
Okay.

508
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,100
You keep that handy.

509
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,600
- You wish me luck, girls.
- All right.

510
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,700
l´m okay. l´m okay.

511
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,500
l´m okay! l´m okay!

512
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,200
l´m okay...l´m okay.

513
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,300
Come on.

514
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,600
Just breathe....

515
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,400
just breathe.

516
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,500
Come on...come on.

517
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Aah!

518
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,900
Come on...

519
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,400
just breathe.

520
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,300
Unh!

521
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,300
Easy. Easy.

522
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,100
Aah! Augh!

523
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,800
lt´s okay! lt´s just a bat.

524
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,800
lt´s just a bat.

525
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,800
Come on, hurry up.

526
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,300
Come on, you motherfucker.

527
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,800
Hello.

528
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,000
ls anyone out there?

529
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,600
Look, we need help. The Bear Tavern.
Send guns. And tanks.

530
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,600
Aaahhh!

531
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,400
l repeat! l repeat! S.O.S.!

532
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,200
S.O.S.! Calling all cars!

533
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,000
Okay! l´m ready to come out!

534
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,200
l´m neady to come out now!

535
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,100
Oh--

536
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:07,200
"Oh"?
What do you mean, "Oh"?!

537
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,400
Help! Help!

538
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,300
Cheese and crackers.

539
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,000
Goddamnit, open up!

540
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,100
Come on!

541
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,300
The goddamn key busted.

542
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,900
Old man! Help!

543
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,800
Goddamnit. lelp!!!

544
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,100
Help!!!

545
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,200
Old man!

546
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,200
The monster´s cock
is stuck in the door!

547
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,100
Aaahhh!

548
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,000
Fuck!

549
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,500
Help!

550
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,400
Shit!

551
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,900
l thought that was it
for a second there.

552
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,500
Hold me, brother.

553
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,900
What happened?

554
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,900
Papa Beast got neutered, missy.

555
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,400
Oh...good one.

556
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:39,500
lf they can´t reproduce,
then we´re one step closer.

557
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,500
A big step.

558
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,600
Now is the time
to band together.

559
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,900
We need to rise up
against these creatures of the night.

560
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,500
These monsters are no match
for the human spirit.

561
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:56,600
We can do it.
We just need to believe in each other,

562
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,100
believe in all of us.

563
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,400
We need to make a stand.

564
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,700
Right here, right now.

565
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,700
Dude...

566
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,100
are you gay?

567
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,600
Look....

568
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:21,000
those monsters were clawing
those nails out upstairs.

569
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,500
They´re like Mensa monsters.

570
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,900
They´re gonna need
a lot more than claws

571
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
to pop out these boards down here.

572
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,900
They´ll need a crowbar or somethin´.

573
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,600
- We gotta find a way out. Now.
- l have a really good idea.

574
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,700
We could all run outside
to our cars

575
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,800
and we could spread out
in different directions.

576
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,500
That´s a goddamn suicide trip.

577
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,000
- But if we all stick together--
- Hey, half of us can´t run,

578
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,100
and one of us
can´t even walk, hon.

579
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,800
Hanging out isn´t looking
too much better.

580
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,500
Even l can admit that.

581
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,900
Hey. Hey. Ow.

582
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Hey, what about the basement
hatch door?

583
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,000
What about it?

584
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,500
We--we could trick ´em.

585
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,300
That could be our--our escape.

586
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,400
The--the--the monsters
don´t know about it.

587
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,200
lt´s a--it´s a--it´s a--
sh--sh--

588
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,700
shh--shh--

589
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,300
lt´s a sec--secret hatch.

590
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,900
Oh, crap. Ohh....

591
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,900
Has anyone got lip balm...
l can borrow?

592
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,000
- Fucked up and stupid.
- Look, it´s true.

593
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,100
lf we just go out there, no matter
how quiet or fast we are, we´re dead.

594
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,300
But if we can draw them away
to the other side of the bar,

595
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,900
we at least got a chance.

596
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,900
Do either of you have any--
a can of hairspray or anything?

597
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,900
Yeah, l do in my purse.

598
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,600
You put in some household cleaner
and some low-grade booze,

599
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,200
and you got yourself a distraction.

600
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,800
What about a car?

601
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,000
Whose car is close?

602
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,100
You gonna climb
through that hatch down there?

603
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,800
- Yeah.
- My truck´s the closest,

604
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,700
but there ain´t no way
it´s gonna haul the whole lot.

605
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,600
- ls it gassed?
- Fully.

606
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,900
- Four-door?
- Two.

607
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,200
- How many fit?
- Six.

608
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,700
- Max?
- Seven.

609
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,200
Ten. lt´s gonna fit ten.

610
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,100
Ten clowns couldn´t
fit in that truck.

611
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,800
Here´s a plan. Two of us go.
One to drive, one to defend.

612
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,400
We back up to the bar,
and tear ass out of here.

613
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,100
Not good odds, missy.

614
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,400
My daughter is waiting for me.
l don´t have a choice.

615
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,600
Okay, l´m in.

616
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,600
No, ma´am. lt would be an honor
to accompany you

617
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,200
on this dangerous journey.

618
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,400
- All right.
- You´re not gonna make it, hon.

619
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,800
l´m sorry.

620
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,100
Sooner or later
that wall is coming down.

621
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,500
lf we stay, we die.

622
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,900
What´s the distraction?

623
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,800
- Well, they want to eat us, right?
- Yeah.

624
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,300
- Let´s give ´em something to eat.

625
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,200
Uh-oh.

626
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,400
Turn on the light.

627
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,000
Which one?
The boy or the girl?

628
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,000
The girl.

629
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,300
Catch!

630
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,500
Ohh!

631
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,000
Oh, God.

632
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,900
All right.
Body bomb is good to go.

633
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,500
This is simple.
l plug in, and she goes boom.

634
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,600
We´re goin´ to hell.
Right to hell.

635
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:01,000
This chick is more useful dead
than you are alive. Will you shut up?

636
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,700
Yeah, we´ll just run this cord
upstairs there

637
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,000
where we been attacked
twice already...

638
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,700
then Fucko and l
drop her through a hole

639
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,600
without making a sound,

640
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,600
and trick the smartest creatures
l ever seen

641
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,500
into taking a bite out of her
instead of us.

642
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,300
That´s real simple.

643
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,700
Hey, l already had my moment.
How come l have to go upstairs again?

644
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,700
´Cause you´re lucky.

645
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,100
You see these peanut barrels?

646
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,800
We line up some planks,

647
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,800
when that wall comes down....
we roll ´em out.

648
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,100
Just like Donkey Kong.

649
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,900
Dipshit.

650
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,600
l don´t believe in guns.

651
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,700
This isn´t a time for
a political stance, hot shot.

652
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,000
This won´t run out of amo.

653
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,500
l want this back.

654
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,600
Hey.

655
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,900
Don´t monkey with my stereo.

656
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,400
Yeah.

657
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:26,000
How does it feel?

658
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,800
How does it feel?

659
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,800
Uh, okay.

660
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,200
Good. Do you mind if l
take a look at it real quick?

661
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,700
- No.
- l´ll try not to hurt you.

662
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,400
How´s it look?

663
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,500
- Uh....
- ls it gettin´ better?

664
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,800
Maybe.

665
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,400
ls it healin´ up?

666
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,700
l´m just gonna
swish out my mouth.

667
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,600
ls it gettin´ better?

668
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,300
- Yeah, looks pretty good.
- Okay.

669
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,500
You should be a nurse.

670
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,100
Thanks.

671
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,200
Can you mend a broken heart?

672
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,800
l wouldn´t fuck you for practice.

673
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,800
- Tease.
- Asshole.

674
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,400
Ohh...ohh...

675
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,200
Bet this place is creepy
in the daytime, too.

676
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,100
Pull that chair down.

677
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,800
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!

678
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,900
Fuckin´ monster.

679
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,100
Hyah!!!

680
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,200
- Up and over.
- Okay.

681
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,900
You and l have
a lot of similarities.

682
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,900
Strong, resolute...

683
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,900
You need to be quiet.

684
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,700
l´m sorry.
l talk when l get nervous.

685
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,800
Quiet. Come on.

686
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,900
lt´s just that it´s been a while
since someone was horribly killed,

687
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:41,500
and it seems like the opportune time
for someone to get, l don´t know, offed.

688
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,000
What did l say?

689
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,800
- Quiet.
- Sorry. l´ll stop now.

690
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,100
We´re up.

691
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,200
Come on, you lazy bastard,
l can´t do it all.

692
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,000
Get on up there. Chop-chop.
ln you go.

693
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,300
Get up there!

694
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,000
Holy shit! She´s alive.

695
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,600
Help me.

696
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,000
No, she´s not.

697
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,200
- Okay, let´s do this.

698
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,200
Help me.

699
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,600
- No. No!
- Help me.

700
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,700

704
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,100

01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,300

Come on. man!

Come on! Auggh--

710
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,300
Shit.

711
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,300
Great men will write
about my bravery.

712
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,500
Hey.

713
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,400
When we get downstairs...

714
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,200
...our story´s the same, right?

715
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,400
Hey.

716
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:02,200
l can stick this in your mouth,
get all dramatic, and ask again, but....

717
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,300
what about if l just say please?

718
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,200
Keep going for the truck!
l´ll draw them away!

719
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,200
Hey, over here!

720
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,100
Fucking monsters!

721
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,000
What the hell are you doing?

722
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,900
l think he´s going
for the truck. l couldn´t make it!

723
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,900
You gotta help me unlock it!

724
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,000
Stop! Stop!

725
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,500
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

726
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,600
They can´t get in here!
We agreed!

727
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,800
Just calm down.
Just take it easy.

728
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,600
Drop it!
Drop it!

729
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,200
- Okay.

730
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,800
Please let me in. Hurry! They´re--

731
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,600
Ohh! Aaahhh!

732
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,700
Open the fucking thing!
l´m gonna fucking die!

733
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,600
- You´re killing her!
- Put the gun down, son.

734
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,800
Don´t let it in!
We´ll all die!

735
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,200
- They got her.

736
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,800
They got her.

737
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,800
Back off! Get away!

738
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:33,200
lf you could stop trying to
get people killed, that´d be great.

739
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,200
Fuck.

740
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,600
You motherfucken!

741
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,500
You ain´t got a chance
without me, dumb-ass--

742
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,300
Arrgghh!

743
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,600
Hold it!

744
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,400
Now we both got a secret,
don´t we?

745
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,800
Arrggh!

746
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,000
Hey, she´s outside.

747
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,700
We´ve got to get her
out of there. Come on.

748
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,000
- She ain´t comin´ back.
- What?

749
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,100
She´s gone.

750
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,400
What happened?

751
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,100
They got her, that´s all.

752
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,500
We tried.

753
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,900
That´s it.

754
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,200
That´s the fuckin´ end of it.

755
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,000
That´s the fucking...end of it.

756
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,100
Unh!

757
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,700
Ohh! Fuck.

758
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,100
Ah, fuck it.

759
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,800
Hey, you guys...

760
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,800
Our plan is--is--is good,

761
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,300
and--and that truck is coming.

762
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,000
lf we all just stick together, we--

763
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:52,500
Hey!

764
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:56,500
lf anyone has a right to have
a complete meltdown right now,

765
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,700
it´s me.

766
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,200
But right now,
l don´t have the time,

767
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,800
because right now
you morose motherfuckers

768
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,200
are gonna get off your ass
and get ready to roll.

769
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,100
´Cause if those things
are gonna fuck with us...

770
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,900
...we´re gonna fuck with ´em right back.

771
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,000
Now, who´s with me?

772
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,400
Yeah, y´all go ahead
and make a run for it.

773
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,200
Make it happen. Just...

774
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,400
you convoy out of here
and save the day.

775
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,100
Me, l´m gonna stay right here,

776
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,400
wait for help,

777
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,800
and, uh, limp out of here
to safety.

778
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,400
Y´all go ahead, though.

779
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:46,400
Storm out of here,
make a bunch of racket.

780
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,600
They won´t even notice me.

781
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,400
They like food that moves.

782
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,600
Aah!

783
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:57,500
- On the tables, now!

784
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,000
l´m not getting near it!

785
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,800
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

786
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,700
Aaaahhh!!!

787
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,300
Get off him! Get off him!

788
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,600
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

789
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,400
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

790
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,300
Calm down! Calm down!

791
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,800
- Calm--
- Stop it...

792
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,700
He didn´t make it.

793
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:58,200
- Yes, he did!
- No, he didn´t!

794
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,600
Yes, he did!
Yes, he did!

795
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,500
No, he didn´t.
No, he didn´t!

796
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,500
Bullshit!!!

797
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,800
Aah!

798
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,800
Those goddamn doors
aren´t gonna fucking hold!

799
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,200
Plan B?

800
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,400
Here. See this?

801
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:30,600
l want you to light
this motherfucker and throw it.

802
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,300
lf we get out of this shit,
l´ll personally take you to the hospital.

803
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,200
And don´t fuck it up.

804
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,100
Oh!

805
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,700
lt´s over.

806
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,500
We´re gonna die.

807
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,700
lt´s not gonna hold!

808
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,900
Comin´!

809
