Hey, watch where you're
going, you old klutz...

2
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,844
- Sorry. Sorry.
- You gonna pick that up?

3
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,846
Pervert.

4
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,557
You're late. l've been
looking all over for you.

5
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,852
l slept right through the alarm clock.
That baby kept me up all night.

6
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:10,232
- What baby?
- l don't know. Our neighbors have a kid?

7
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,859
Our neighbors are 90 years old.

8
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,447
You want to try and get
the paint on the canvas.

9
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,241
l like it messy.

10
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:23,578
Oh, yeah?
l gotta go.

11
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,958
Hey-

12
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:39,469
l just start drinking
and doing a lot of,like, pills.

13
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,806
'Cause then it just kills the pain,
and then l can just deal with it later.

14
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,435
l'm just saying- l'm not
telling you to go drink.

15
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,273
l know you go to meetings.
l'm just telling you what works for me, okay?

16
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:55,652
lt's hard to deal with those feelings.
Well, drinking kills feelings. That's why.

17
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,781
lt's gonna hail this afternoon.

18
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:04,077
You think?
Looks pretty sunny to me.

19
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,788
Who the fuck are you?

20
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,833
l'm Dr. Sam Foster.
You must be Henry.

21
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,335
Where's Dr. Levy?

22
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,838
Didn't she get in touch with you?

23
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,965
No.

24
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,051
Oh, l'm sorry.
She's away for a while.

25
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,846
- l'm covering for her.
- She's away where?

26
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,974
She's not feeling well.
She'll be back in a couple of weeks.

27
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,311
What are you-
a substitute shrink?

28
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,983
l guess you could call me that.

29
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,861
Oh.

30
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,155
This is her office.

31
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:45,118
Yeah, we share it. l'm only here
a few hours a week. Please take a seat.

32
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,704
Oh, l see.

33
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,666
So you treat the, uh...

34
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,836
depressed investment bankers,
paranoid housewives all week?

35
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,214
Come up here to do
a little pro bono work?

36
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,216
lt's the other way around.

37
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:04,220
The bankers are paranoid,
and the housewives are depressed.

38
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:10,852
Now,you're a junior at the college.
ls that right? Majoring in fine art?

39
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,692
She passed me off to you, huh?

40
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,364
You get the hard cases.

41
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,535
Does it make you uncomfortable
that l'm filling in for her?

42
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,874
She was trying to help me.

43
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,043
l'll try and help you too.

44
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,381
She afraid of me?
ls that why she's gone?

45
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,717
Did l scare her?

46
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,553
Should she be afraid of you?

47
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,902
l've read your file.

48
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,571
And can l read your file?

49
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,408
Tell me why you're here.

50
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,577
l thought you read the file.

51
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,581
You torched your car.
Why?

52
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,835
l don't remember.
l just woke up...

53
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,630
and l was in the car,
and it was on fire.

54
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,634
ls that something you do-
set fires?

55
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,390
l didn't mean to hurt anybody.

56
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,769
Who did you hurt?

57
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,150
l don't know.
l'm gonna go.

58
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,736
No. Please, sit down.
We have more time.

59
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,739
No, l, uh- l'm gonna go home
before this hail starts.

60
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:51,286
The king of Poland goes hunting
in the woods with one ofhis assistants.

61
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,288
And they're looking around...

62
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,833
and suddenly on the other side
of the clearing a farmer walks by.

63
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,419
Hold still.

64
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,671
And the king raises his rifle,
and the farmer yells...

65
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,756
''l'm not a moose.''

66
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,676
The king shoots
and kills the guy...

67
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,678
and the assistant's shocked.

68
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,055
And he says...

69
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,809
''Sire, the man said,
l'm not a moose.''

70
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,813
''Oh, says the king.
l thought he said, l am a moose.''

71
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,694
lt's a joke.

72
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,238
No, l'm just trying
to figure out...

73
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,408
if l'm the king or the farmer.

74
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,038
You're the moose.

75
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:39,125
- l'm the moose?
- Yeah.

76
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,881
Well, l appear to be the moose.

77
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,510
- lt's shit.
- lt's not shit.

78
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,681
lt's not shit.

79
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,819
Still there.

80
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,614
Sometimes l forget.

81
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,369
They're from another life.

82
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,596
Oh, my God.

83
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,443
l love this song.

84
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:02,083
l know you. Psych 221.
Professor Azzopardi?

85
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,588
You did that presentation on psychosis
and Tristan Reveur, right?

86
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,925
No smoking on the train.

87
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,596
Look at the sign, fella.
No smoking.

88
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,019
Capisce? Put it out.

89
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,522
''Capisce''?

90
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,570
Put out the fucking cigarette.

91
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,001
You oughta be locked up,
you asshole.

92
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,263
Beth? Sam. l hope
you're getting some rest.

93
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,143
Look, l met with your
patient today- Henry Letham.

94
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,812
l'd really like
to talk to you about him.

95
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,316
Give me a call, okay?
l wanna hear your voice.

96
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,779
You don't think it's a little odd-
predicting a hailstorm like that?

97
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,990
So he watches the Weather Channel.

98
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,452
No. l looked in the newspaper.
There was nothing about hail today.

99
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,872
How's Beth?

100
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,625
l don't know.
She hasn't returned any of my calls.

101
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,878
She always kinda
liked you, didn't she?

102
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,632
What, are you jealous?

103
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,634
Of Beth?

104
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,637
- l'm just faking it.
- Your students love you.

105
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,391
My students love me
'cause l give 'em all A's.

106
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:46,687
l mean, what the fuck do l know?
This kid could be the next Rothko.

107
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,914
Tell me l'm good.

108
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,916
You're good.

109
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,668
Tell me they'll remember me.

110
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,254
Who's ''they''?

111
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,840
The world.

112
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,843
ls that what you want?

113
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,224
The world will remember you.

114
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,562
Now take off your clothes.

115
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,414
Hey.

116
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,217
Who did that?

117
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,427
My girlfriend.

118
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,888
Where'd you get that?

119
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,267
This? l bought it.

120
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,775
Henry, what are you
doing here? l-

121
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,070
l wasn't expecting you.
l have someone coming in.

122
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:29,331
So, have you considered
a career in meteorology?

123
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:31,000
Hmm?

124
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,837
The weatherman
said something about hail?

125
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,631
The weatherman?

126
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,010
No.

127
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,806
You know, l can't even
listen to him anymore?

128
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,478
l don't understand a word
that comes out of his mouth.

129
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,814
You don't understand
the weatherman?

130
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,816
No.

131
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,322
But you do?

132
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,491
Sure. He says rain,
l bring an umbrella.

133
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,917
Henry, give me something.

134
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,380
l'm good at what l do.

135
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,676
Well, l'm hearing voices now.

136
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,680
Voices?

137
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:34,021
They come and they go,
but when they are there-

138
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,815
You're hearing them now?

139
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,068
Okay.

140
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,157
Can you write down
what they're saying?

141
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,418
- Yeah?
Hey, Dr. Foster. lt's Frederick.

142
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,763
Can you read it to me?

143
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,642
- Hmm?
- Can you read it to me?

144
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,105
Uh, yeah.

145
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,982
''Hey, Dr. Foster. lt's Frederick.''

146
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:24,571
This is-This voice isn't in your head.
This is a real voice.

147
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,746
Okay. Well, l don't know.

148
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,916
Maybe you could show me
how to tell the difference?

149
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,294
Go on.

150
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,296
l don't know.

151
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,472
''l didn't move him.
l know you're not supposed to move 'em.''

152
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,600
''l can't watch anymore.''

153
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:58,814
''Stay with me, Henry.
Stay with me.''

154
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:03,152
Hey, guys. Sorry
to interrupt, but, uh-

155
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,988
Hey, Frederick,
can you give me a minute?

156
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,283
- l've got a conference call at 11:00.
-Just a minute. Thank you.

157
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,785
Yeah, okay.

158
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,168
Where's this from?

159
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,172
Oh, l burned myself.

160
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,966
You burned yourself? Why?

161
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,804
Practicing for hell.

162
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,474
Why do you think
you're going to hell?

163
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,810
Um...

164
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,316
'cause of what l did.

165
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,153
What l'm gonna do.

166
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,864
What are you gonna do?

167
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:58,040
You're gonna try and kill yourself?

168
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,169
And how seriously should l take that?

169
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,963
Saturday at midnight
is when l'm gonna do it.

170
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,674
You gotta know that
everything just changed.

171
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:11,053
lf you talk to me about suicide,
l'm required to take certain actions.

172
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,556
Hey, look.Just wait a second.
Wait a second.

173
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:15,807
Just, you know, deal with him...

174
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:18,852
Just, you know, deal with him...

175
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,981
and, uh, we'll talk
about it next time.

176
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,525
There's a next time?

177
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,527
Yeah.

178
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,696
Yeah.

179
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,910
Yeah, we got three days.

180
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:40,582
He's coming! He's coming!

181
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:45,712
l am not a monster, goddamn you!
Get off of me!

182
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:49,216
Nobody's calling you a monster,
Daisy. Come on now.

183
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,552
Please! You said you would-
l don't deserve this!

184
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:56,014
Well, if you'd just remember to take your pills,
you wouldn't have to go through this.

185
00:16:56,098 --> 00:17:00,102
- l'm not a monster. l'm lovable.
- l know you are.

186
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:03,772
l'm lovable. Stop!

187
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,900
- No, please! l'm lovable.
- Very lovable.

188
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,736
He's coming!
l oughta know he's coming!

189
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:13,407
l'll be good. l'll be good!
l don't want to- No!

190
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,409
- Hey, Sammy.
- Hey.

191
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,078
He's just a kid!
He's just a kid!

192
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,039
Okay, now.
Let go, Daisy.

193
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,458
He's just a kid!

194
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,460
He's just a kid!

195
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:28,130
Sorry about that.
You okay?

196
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:32,134
Yeah. Yeah. l'm used to dealing
with neurotic stockbrokers.

197
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,511
Neurotic stockbrokers pay better.

198
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,974
So, uh, what brings you
to Club Meds?

199
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,476
l have a student
threatening to kill himself.

200
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:44,604
Christ. Well, tell him
to take a number.

201
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,648
Look, you know how it works.

202
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:49,443
lf he threatens to hurt
himself or someone else...

203
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,696
then we can take him in,
but we can't hold him here forever.

204
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,865
He said he's gonna
do it on Saturday.

205
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,117
lf you take him in now,
he'll be out by then.

206
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,078
Organized kid.
He's got it all scheduled.

207
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,706
Saturday, midnight.
That's what he said.

208
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:07,210
We can pick him up Friday,
hold him for the weekend.

209
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:09,880
As you can see, it's
not a real fun process.

210
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,632
Anything you could do to avoid it?

211
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,302
- What have you got him on?
- He won't take any meds.

212
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:47,667
Where's my man?

213
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:52,339
You know what l've
been craving all day?

214
00:18:57,093 --> 00:18:59,679
Something to drink.

215
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:07,687
What's the matter?
You're looking a little tense.

216
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:10,190
lt's nothing.

217
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:12,901
So tell me about nothing.

218
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:17,405
l'm just tired.

219
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,076
Let me make a call,
and then we can take a bath together.

220
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:26,581
Beth, it's Sam again.

221
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,376
Um, l hope
you're getting some rest.

222
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:33,213
Everyone's been asking about you.
Look, give me a call.

223
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:37,717
l want to speak to you about Henry Letham
and find out how you're feeling, okay?

224
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,845
Bye.

225
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:46,393
You sound like you're talking
to one of your patients.

226
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:50,689
- ls she sick?
- She's exhausted.

227
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,732
Exhausted?

228
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:57,570
Come on. We live in New York City.
Everyone's exhausted.

229
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,989
- What, is that a code word?

230
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,410
Yeah.

231
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,539
Yeah, l guess it is.

232
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:23,596
How's the kid with the hail?

233
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,057
Ever heard of
doctor-patient privilege?

234
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,643
What's the prediction
tomorrow? Locusts?

235
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:30,895
He's confused.

236
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,441
Confused?
ls that like exhausted?

237
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,776
l don't want to get
into this right now.

238
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,780
You told me about the lawyer
who thought her cat was talking to her.

239
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,949
l shouldn't have.

240
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:49,205
He wants to kill himself.

241
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,585
That's it, isn't it?
That's why you won't talk about it.

242
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,923
- He has a right to confidential counseling.
- Come on, Sam.

243
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,307
He wants to kill himself
on Saturday night.

244
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,436
At midnight, like it's a date.

245
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,610
What's so special about Saturday?

246
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:21,571
l didn't have time to ask.

247
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:25,325
Look, we can talk
about it, you know.

248
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:27,368
lt doesn't scare me.

249
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,705
- lt scares me.
- Yeah, l know.

250
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,791
But you have to trust me.

251
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:37,170
l do.

252
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:52,227
- Up slow,Jerry.
- Got it.

253
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,229
- Looking good, Mikey.
- Not  - Not so fast.

254
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:56,231
- Stop that swaying.
- Come on, Mommy. Faster.

255
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:59,859
Easy. Easy. Hold it!
Stay clear, you guys. Quick.

256
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:03,363
Wait! Wait! My balloon!

257
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:05,865
Sorry, kid.
lt's gone to balloon heaven.

258
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,910
Oh, that's okay, sir.
We're gonna get another one at the park.

259
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:11,329
- Go ahead, honey.
- Promise, Mommy?

260
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:13,748
All right, you guys.
Comin' your way.

261
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:15,959
Tristan Reveur once said...

262
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:20,171
''lf we cannot see the wind,
we can see the wind's will.''

263
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:25,927
Here, Pradilla Ortiz forces us
to imagine the wind...

264
00:22:26,052 --> 00:22:28,054
by showing its effect
on the smoke...

265
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:31,557
the candle flames
and Dona Juana's veil.

266
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:37,355
Only the victims' faces are
visible in Goya's masterwork.

267
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:42,902
Our eyes are drawn
to the brightest spot on the canvas-

268
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:47,949
the white shirt of a doomed man
pleading for his life.

269
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:51,077
Behind him, the hill closing in...

270
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,455
refusing a path to escape.

271
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,793
- The Dead Toreador was originally
part of a larger painting...

272
00:22:58,918 --> 00:23:01,921
lncident in a Bullfight.

273
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:06,551
After the painting was mocked
by critics and viewers...

274
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:09,053
Manet angrily sliced it in half...

275
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,431
removing the fallen hero
from his arena...

276
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,057
removing the fallen hero
from his arena...

277
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:18,229
and accidentally creating
one ofhis most enduring works.

278
00:23:18,312 --> 00:23:21,065
- Hey.
- Hey.

279
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,609
How are you doing?

280
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,611
Oh, you know.

281
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:29,866
l didn't know if you'd still be coming
to class after what you told me.

282
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,869
Yeah, well, where else
am l gonna go?

283
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,871
Have you got a minute?

284
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,956
Sure.

285
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:40,543
Are any of these yours?

286
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:42,545
Ouch.

287
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,630
What?

288
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,175
Well, these are bad, so-

289
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,053
- Oh.

290
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:56,934
Do you know that Tristan Reveur quote
about bad art?

291
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:01,272
lt's ''Bad art is more tragically
beautiful than good art...

292
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:03,816
because it documents
human failure.''

293
00:24:08,654 --> 00:24:11,032
Why'd do you want
to do it on Saturday?

294
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:14,786
lt's my 21st birthday.

295
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:18,456
l think the tradition
is to go out and get drunk.

296
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:22,043
Well, um, Tristan started
a different tradition.

297
00:24:22,168 --> 00:24:24,045
What did he do?

298
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,465
He died.

299
00:24:27,548 --> 00:24:29,675
What about your parents?

300
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,682
What about 'em?

301
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:39,227
Don't you think they care?

302
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:47,318
No.

303
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:49,820
Do they live around here?

304
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,741
They're over in Mahlus Gardens.

305
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:56,244
Mahlus Gardens-
Where is that?

306
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,871
lt's a cemetery in Jersey.

307
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:05,878
- l thought you read the file.
- l'm sorry.

308
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,880
l did.
lt didn't mention that.

309
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,925
lt's a little out of date.

310
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:12,927
Do you have any other family?

311
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,929
No.

312
00:25:15,012 --> 00:25:17,056
Girlfriend?

313
00:25:20,434 --> 00:25:22,687
You talked to her?

314
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:26,107
No.

315
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:29,068
Who is she?

316
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,201
No, you're not talking to her.

317
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,081
l thought you were talking
about this waitress...

318
00:25:42,206 --> 00:25:44,750
in this diner l used to go to
over on Canal Street.

319
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,794
Tell me about her.

320
00:25:46,877 --> 00:25:51,507
When she filled up my cup of coffee,
she would ask me how l was doing.

321
00:25:51,632 --> 00:25:54,969
Waitress things, you know.
lt doesn't really constitute a girlfriend.

322
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:57,805
Did you ever get her name?

323
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,807
Yeah, it was Athena.

324
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:02,310
l was gonna marry her.

325
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:06,313
You were gonna marry her?

326
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,151
Yeah. l bought her
a ring and everything.

327
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,700
lt looked just like the one
that you got your girl.

328
00:26:22,663 --> 00:26:27,293
l didn't steal your ring,
Henry, okay? l promise.

329
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:35,843
Yeah, l lost it.

330
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,931
Anyway, she's gone.

331
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:43,976
- She's gone?
- Yeah.

332
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,479
- Or she's somewhere else?
- What do you mean?

333
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:48,981
There is no somewhere else.

334
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:14,215
He's not going to make it.

335
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:39,865
- lt's beautiful.
- No.

336
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,202
lt's like the crap
tourists buy on Fifth Avenue.

337
00:27:48,082 --> 00:27:51,919
- You talk with your student today?
- Mm-hmm.

338
00:27:53,796 --> 00:27:55,965
Still wants to do it?

339
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,425
l don't feel right talking about it.

340
00:27:59,802 --> 00:28:02,179
Talking about it with me, you mean.

341
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:13,023
You stopped taking your pills.

342
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:18,237
l've been counting.
You haven't taken one in weeks.

343
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:20,364
l don't need 'em anymore.

344
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:23,409
Well, that's a decision
we should've made together.

345
00:28:23,492 --> 00:28:28,205
l can't paint on meds.

346
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,419
l can't.

347
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:40,426
- Well, it makes me nervous.

348
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:43,429
l'm not happy
you did this in secret.

349
00:28:43,512 --> 00:28:48,350
Well, l'm not happy
you're counting my pills in secret.

350
00:28:48,475 --> 00:28:51,937
We have to trust each other.

351
00:28:57,568 --> 00:29:00,612
Hey, look at me.

352
00:29:05,492 --> 00:29:08,162
l can't make them disappear.

353
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:12,416
l wish l could.

354
00:29:17,588 --> 00:29:19,965
l made you a promise.

355
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:25,346
l gotta go.

356
00:29:28,223 --> 00:29:30,142
l'll see you at home.

357
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:38,192
Henry?
Forgetting something?

358
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:44,656
- What's the matter?
- You just called me Henry.

359
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:49,328
- Baby, l think l know your name by now.
- Yeah, but you called me Henry.

360
00:29:49,453 --> 00:29:53,165
Sam, l know who you are.
l promise.

361
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:56,543
Sorry.

362
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:01,882
Okay.

363
00:30:17,356 --> 00:30:17,481
Do you get nervous?

364
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:19,233
Do you get nervous?

365
00:30:19,358 --> 00:30:21,902
lt's a great part,
but she should resist more.

366
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:25,531
- She just takes his abuse and walks into the river.
- You should use that.

367
00:30:25,614 --> 00:30:27,908
- All without a fight.
- Can we come and see you?

368
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:30,077
- Henry, that would be nice, wouldn't it?
- Yeah, Mom.

369
00:30:30,202 --> 00:30:31,203
We could all go together.

370
00:30:31,203 --> 00:30:32,079
We could all go together.

371
00:30:35,082 --> 00:30:39,086
King's rook to E-3.

372
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:42,881
Mm-hmm.

373
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:45,551
How's Lila?

374
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:49,388
She's good. Oh,
l got something for her.

375
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:52,015
- Mm-hmm.
- Give me your hand.

376
00:30:53,976 --> 00:30:56,770
Ah.

377
00:30:56,895 --> 00:30:58,897
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

378
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:01,358
l hear she's a beautiful girl.

379
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:05,195
How long have you
been carrying that around?

380
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,905
A while.

381
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:09,199
What are you waiting for?

382
00:31:09,283 --> 00:31:12,244
The fear to go away, l guess.

383
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:14,621
Mm.

384
00:31:14,746 --> 00:31:17,291
How do l know she won't try again?

385
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:19,376
You don't know, Sam.

386
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:21,545
Does she make you happy?

387
00:31:21,628 --> 00:31:23,755
Oh, yes.

388
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,592
Well, here's something that won't.

389
00:31:26,675 --> 00:31:29,469
Knight to C-3.
Check.

390
00:31:29,595 --> 00:31:31,597
- Oh, shit.

391
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:38,812
Do you remember the dream
of the burning boy referred to by Freud?

392
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:41,607
- Vaguely.
- Vaguely meaning no?

393
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,609
- Right.
- Yeah.

394
00:31:43,692 --> 00:31:46,653
Well, he describes a man
whose child is dying.

395
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:50,449
The father sits by the boy's bed
night after night...

396
00:31:50,532 --> 00:31:53,994
and after the boy is dead,
they give him a wake.

397
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:59,333
And they set up a circle of candles
around the boy's body.

398
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:02,878
And the father's exhausted.
He falls asleep.

399
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:06,840
And he dreams that his son
is standing beside him...

400
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:10,927
holding his arm
and whispering...

401
00:32:11,011 --> 00:32:13,680
''Father, can't you see
that l'm burning?''

402
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:16,641
- You have a visitor?
- Henry.

403
00:32:16,725 --> 00:32:18,727
- l can come back.
- No, no. You're all right.

404
00:32:18,852 --> 00:32:20,854
- l don't mind.
- Do you know Dr. Patterson?

405
00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:23,982
- No.
- Pleased to meet you.

406
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,824
What's the matter, Henry?

407
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,538
What the fuck?

408
00:32:40,665 --> 00:32:42,876
What are you doing here?

409
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:45,670
We're playing chess.

410
00:32:45,754 --> 00:32:47,964
You're dead.

411
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:51,968
- Sam?
- l watched you die.

412
00:32:52,052 --> 00:32:54,638
Sam, we'll finish this game later.

413
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:56,556
Sure.

414
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,352
- Where are you going?
- Henry, take a seat.

415
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:03,897
- Why'd you come back?
- Do you know Leon?

416
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,900
What did he say to you?
Did he say something about me?

417
00:33:06,983 --> 00:33:10,070
No, he didn't say anything about you.
l don't think Leon even knows you.

418
00:33:11,738 --> 00:33:14,866
That's my father.

419
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,910
He knows me.

420
00:33:17,035 --> 00:33:20,080
Now, listen, l've known Leon a long time.
He doesn't have any children.

421
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:23,333
Don't say that! Don't
fuckin' say that to me!

422
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:26,586
What are you doing?

423
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:29,172
Do you think l don't
recognize my own father?

424
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:32,217
- You told me your father was dead.
- He is dead.

425
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,720
He's dead, and that's him
walkin' out the fuckin' door!

426
00:33:35,804 --> 00:33:38,431
The man walking out the door
is alive and well.

427
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:41,560
What's happening?

428
00:33:41,643 --> 00:33:44,855
l saw all the blood,
and l watched him die.

429
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,900
l did it.

430
00:33:48,984 --> 00:33:52,445
lt's my fault.

431
00:33:52,571 --> 00:33:55,365
Maybe you hurt someone,
but not Leon.

432
00:33:55,448 --> 00:33:58,118
Who did you hurt?
Your father?

433
00:33:58,243 --> 00:34:02,956
l don't remember.

434
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:07,460
Sometimes we don't want to remember,
but l think you have to try.

435
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,423
Fuck you! What the fuck
do you know!

436
00:34:11,506 --> 00:34:15,427
You don't know anything!
Everything you know is a fuckin' lie!

437
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,513
- All right?
- Okay.

438
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:21,266
Tell me what the truth is.

439
00:34:26,479 --> 00:34:29,983
Your troubles will cease,
and fortune will smile upon you.

440
00:34:34,362 --> 00:34:37,657
Your troubles will cease,
and fortune will smile upon you.

441
00:34:37,782 --> 00:34:39,784
Yes, Henry.

442
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:42,829
Henry?

443
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:48,168
Henry?

444
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:52,297
Henry!

445
00:34:56,718 --> 00:34:59,471
Henry!

446
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,808
Henry?

447
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:06,144
Henry, are you there?

448
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:25,705
Here we go.

449
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,697
Trouble.

450
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,100
- Henry, listen.

451
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:29,769
Stay with me, okay?
Listen to my voice, Henry.

452
00:36:29,894 --> 00:36:33,606
- Stay with us here, all right?
- ls that your voice?

453
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:39,154
l didn't leave that message.

454
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:42,615
Probably someone who
sounds exactly like you.

455
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:44,909
So what do we do now?

456
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:46,911
Not much we can do
at this point.

457
00:36:46,995 --> 00:36:51,040
We don't have the resources or the manpower
for a stakeout or anything like that.

458
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:53,585
l'll notify the police,
but they won't do anything.

459
00:36:53,668 --> 00:36:55,587
Why not?

460
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,591
Because they've got more important things
to do than look for depressed college students.

461
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:01,426
Then l'll find him.

462
00:37:01,509 --> 00:37:03,469
Well, if you do,
give me a call.

463
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:06,055
We'll pick him up for you.
But do me a favor, Sammy.

464
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:08,892
The kid hears voices
and carries a gun.

465
00:37:08,975 --> 00:37:10,727
Watch your back.

466
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:21,446
Mommy, is that man
gonna die?

467
00:37:24,407 --> 00:37:26,618
Come on, Bobby.
We're gonna be late.

468
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:29,579
You shouldn't run away from me like that,
you little monkey.

469
00:37:29,662 --> 00:37:31,664
But is he gonna die?

470
00:37:36,628 --> 00:37:38,504
Listen to this.

471
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,507
''Henry Letham has a fertile,
powerful imagination.

472
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:46,095
lf he maintains his concentration,
he will create new worlds with his art.''

473
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:48,973
Jim O'Shea?

474
00:37:49,057 --> 00:37:51,142
Professor O'Shea, yeah.
How'd you know?

475
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:54,938
'CauseJim wants to fuck
every cute boy in his class.

476
00:37:55,021 --> 00:37:59,192
- Did you ever hear of an artist
named Tristan Reveur?
- Yeah, of course.

477
00:37:59,317 --> 00:38:01,986
- Do you like his work?
- l've never seen it. Nobody has.

478
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:04,614
He burned all his paintings
before he killed himself.

479
00:38:04,697 --> 00:38:06,616
- He killed himself?
- Mm-hmm.

480
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:09,327
When he was 18, he told everyone
he'd live three more years...

481
00:38:09,452 --> 00:38:11,496
then go to New York
and kill himself.

482
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:15,541
And that's exactly what he did.
Left a one-line note:

483
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:20,171
''Un suicide elegant
est l'oeuvre d'art finale.''

484
00:38:20,254 --> 00:38:23,132
''An elegant suicide is
the ultimate work of art.''

485
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:26,552
Ah,Jesus.
He's Henry's favorite artist.

486
00:38:26,636 --> 00:38:28,680
Of course he is.

487
00:38:34,227 --> 00:38:36,229
Let me talk to him.

488
00:38:36,312 --> 00:38:38,648
Talk to him?
First l've gotta find him.

489
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:42,735
He'll find you. He knows you can help him.
That's exactly why he keeps coming back to you.

490
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,363
Well, even if he does,
l can't let you talk to him.

491
00:38:45,488 --> 00:38:47,532
l'd violate every rule in the book.

492
00:38:47,615 --> 00:38:52,704
So violate them. You have something, Sam.
This kid trusts you.

493
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:56,499
But you've never stood where
he's standing right now, and he knows that.

494
00:38:56,582 --> 00:39:01,212
Yeah, but l treat people every day
with conditions l've never experienced myself.

495
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,093
You know, the day l did it...

496
00:39:07,218 --> 00:39:10,513
l took two razor blades
to the bathtub.

497
00:39:10,596 --> 00:39:13,891
You know why?

498
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:18,521
Because l knew that
once l started to bleed, l'd get weak...

499
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:23,025
and l didn't want to drop one blade
and leave myself half done.

500
00:39:24,902 --> 00:39:27,280
Can you imagine that?

501
00:39:27,363 --> 00:39:30,366
Can you imagine hating
your life so much...

502
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,286
that you want to bring
a backup razor?

503
00:39:48,134 --> 00:39:50,094
So what do l tell him?

504
00:39:53,723 --> 00:39:56,642
There's too much beauty to quit.

505
00:39:58,477 --> 00:40:02,982
Tell him that.
There's too much goddamn beauty.

506
00:40:15,786 --> 00:40:17,663
Eat something.

507
00:40:17,788 --> 00:40:20,625
l'm not hungry.

508
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:23,628
Eat your fortune cookie.

509
00:40:27,506 --> 00:40:29,800
lt's yours.

510
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:43,689
''Your troubles will cease,
and fortune will smile upon you.''

511
00:40:43,814 --> 00:40:46,484
Not a moment too soon.

512
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:50,529
What's the matter?

513
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,382
- Beth, it's Sam.
-  l didn't touch him.

514
00:41:09,465 --> 00:41:12,385
- Beth? Beth?
- l know you're not supposed to move-

515
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:29,485
Beth?

516
00:41:31,028 --> 00:41:33,072
Beth?

517
00:41:33,197 --> 00:41:35,157
lt's me.

518
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:38,411
Are you okay?

519
00:41:41,163 --> 00:41:43,416
l'm gonna turn on the light, okay?

520
00:41:50,798 --> 00:41:54,719
l know Leon's been trying
to get through to you.

521
00:41:54,802 --> 00:41:56,721
And Toni.

522
00:42:00,975 --> 00:42:03,728
Oh,Jesus.

523
00:42:05,938 --> 00:42:10,109
- Beth, are you gonna talk to me?

524
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:12,903
What do you want to talk about?

525
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:17,283
How are you feeling?

526
00:42:17,408 --> 00:42:20,911
What do you really
wanna talk about?

527
00:42:22,538 --> 00:42:25,207
l'm worried about you...

528
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:28,502
and l wanna know more
about Henry Letham.

529
00:42:28,627 --> 00:42:30,755
l didn't touch him.

530
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,883
l know you're not
supposed to move them.

531
00:42:33,966 --> 00:42:35,759
What does that mean?

532
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:36,635
What does that mean?

533
00:42:39,346 --> 00:42:42,391
l wanna kiss you.
Do you want to play a kissing game?

534
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:43,893
Beth.

535
00:42:45,978 --> 00:42:48,814
No. You're loyal.

536
00:42:48,939 --> 00:42:53,277
You're a good dog.
Good, loyal dog, Sam.

537
00:42:54,737 --> 00:42:56,739
What's her name?

538
00:42:56,822 --> 00:42:58,741
Lila?

539
00:42:58,824 --> 00:43:01,994
You should've let her
bleed in the bathtub.

540
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:05,498
- She had the right idea.
- What are you talking about?

541
00:43:05,581 --> 00:43:08,667
lt's highly inappropriate.

542
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:12,838
You're not supposed to fuck your patients,
even the pretty ones.

543
00:43:12,963 --> 00:43:14,965
You know the rules.

544
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:19,303
- You can't drink while you're taking these.
- Mm. Apparently l can.

545
00:43:19,386 --> 00:43:22,848
No, you can't. Come on, Beth.
l want you to come take a shower.

546
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:25,809
Bathe the corpse.

547
00:43:25,893 --> 00:43:28,270
We won't really be corpses
though, will we?

548
00:43:28,354 --> 00:43:30,940
lt will be more
like a memory of nothing.

549
00:43:31,023 --> 00:43:33,484
What happened to you, Beth?

550
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:37,863
- l need to sleep, please.
- No, you got too much crap in your system.

551
00:43:37,988 --> 00:43:40,032
Are you okay to shower?

552
00:43:40,157 --> 00:43:43,160
- He's watching us.
- No, we're alone.

553
00:43:43,285 --> 00:43:47,206
- He's watching.
- Are you still talking to him?

554
00:43:47,331 --> 00:43:49,959
- Do you know where he is?
- Ask the mother.

555
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:53,003
- The mother's dead.
- ls she?

556
00:43:53,087 --> 00:43:55,047
Ask anyway.

557
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,174
Hello? Hello? Yeah.

558
00:43:57,258 --> 00:43:59,510
This is Sam Foster,
Dr. Sam Foster.

559
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:03,180
l'm a psychiatrist. Yeah.

560
00:44:03,264 --> 00:44:06,809
l'm calling about a student
named Henry Letham.

561
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,688
He is?

562
00:44:10,813 --> 00:44:13,274
This is very strange, Mrs. Letham.

563
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:17,528
He told me you had passed-
Hello? Hello?

564
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:19,697
- Damn it.

565
00:44:23,283 --> 00:44:26,078
This is it.
l won't be long.

566
00:44:43,846 --> 00:44:47,725
- l've been waiting for you.

567
00:44:47,808 --> 00:44:49,768
Mrs. Letham?

568
00:44:49,852 --> 00:44:53,564
l'm Dr. Sam Foster.
l'm sorry to bother you at this hour.

569
00:44:53,689 --> 00:44:55,983
l thought you'd never come.

570
00:44:56,108 --> 00:45:00,195
l would have come earlier.
l didn't know you were here.

571
00:45:00,279 --> 00:45:03,490
lt's easy to forget about me...

572
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,701
all alone up here.

573
00:45:05,784 --> 00:45:09,121
Your son's not well.
That's why l'm here.

574
00:45:09,204 --> 00:45:11,123
l'm trying to find him.

575
00:45:11,206 --> 00:45:14,793
l'm sorry to say he's threatened
to commit suicide.

576
00:45:14,918 --> 00:45:19,214
You came to see Olive,
didn't you? Not me.

577
00:45:19,298 --> 00:45:21,383
Olive?

578
00:45:21,467 --> 00:45:25,596
There she is.
She's been lonely.

579
00:45:25,721 --> 00:45:28,640
Me and Olive
keep each other company.

580
00:45:28,724 --> 00:45:32,394
We've been alone in this house
for a thousand years.

581
00:45:34,563 --> 00:45:37,107
Hey, Olive.

582
00:45:37,232 --> 00:45:39,610
How are you doing, girl?

583
00:45:39,693 --> 00:45:42,446
She doesn't remember you.

584
00:45:44,782 --> 00:45:48,452
- Are you hungry?
- No.

585
00:45:48,535 --> 00:45:50,746
Do you know
how to contact your son?

586
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:53,457
Are there any relatives or friends
he might have gone to see?

587
00:45:56,126 --> 00:45:58,295
Let me fix you something to eat.

588
00:45:58,378 --> 00:46:01,965
You stay with Olive.
There's some leftovers in the fridge.

589
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:07,638
Most days l don't say
a single word.

590
00:46:07,763 --> 00:46:11,600
Sometimes l'm silent so long,
l forget how to speak.

591
00:46:16,897 --> 00:46:20,108
Mrs. Letham,
we have an emergency here.

592
00:46:20,192 --> 00:46:22,110
You-

593
00:46:22,194 --> 00:46:25,030
Do you hate me?

594
00:46:26,615 --> 00:46:28,617
You must hate me.

595
00:46:29,952 --> 00:46:32,120
ls that why you did it?

596
00:46:32,204 --> 00:46:34,456
No, l don't hate you.

597
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:38,710
l'm here because
your son needs help.

598
00:46:39,962 --> 00:46:42,881
l knew you'd come eventually.

599
00:46:43,006 --> 00:46:46,593
lt's been quiet without you.
Lonely.

600
00:46:46,718 --> 00:46:51,014
Mrs. Letham, who do you think l am?

601
00:46:51,098 --> 00:46:54,393
Don't play games.
Not anymore.

602
00:46:54,518 --> 00:46:56,561
Who am l?

603
00:46:56,687 --> 00:46:59,398
You think l don't
know you, Henry?

604
00:46:59,523 --> 00:47:02,567
You think l don't
recognize my only son?

605
00:47:02,693 --> 00:47:07,197
Oh, Lord, l've missed you.
l've missed you so much.

606
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:11,451
l know you never
meant to hurt us.

607
00:47:11,576 --> 00:47:14,913
- Mom?
- Yes, baby.

608
00:47:14,997 --> 00:47:17,457
How did l hurt you?

609
00:47:17,582 --> 00:47:22,087
lt doesn't matter anymore.
l could never stay angry with you.

610
00:47:24,131 --> 00:47:26,091
What do l do on Saturdays?

611
00:47:28,427 --> 00:47:32,973
When you were a boy,
you used to go to the zoo.

612
00:47:33,098 --> 00:47:38,562
Remember? You loved
to watch the walrus swim.

613
00:47:38,687 --> 00:47:41,106
But l'm older now.

614
00:47:41,189 --> 00:47:45,402
lt's my 21st birthday tomorrow.
What'll l do for my birthday?

615
00:47:46,987 --> 00:47:51,950
Who knows?
You don't tell me anything these days.

616
00:47:52,075 --> 00:47:55,037
l guess you tell Athena
your secrets now.

617
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,041
Athena?
Do you remember where Athena lives?

618
00:47:59,124 --> 00:48:01,376
Dogs are a big responsibility, darling.

619
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,755
- Look at the mess l'm making.

620
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:07,632
- l just have to clean it up.
- Let me see your head.

621
00:48:07,758 --> 00:48:09,760
- You don't want to see.
- Mrs. Letham.

622
00:48:09,885 --> 00:48:12,554
You didn't mean to hurt anyone.
You know you didn't.

623
00:48:12,637 --> 00:48:15,140
Let me look at your head.
That's a serious wound.

624
00:48:15,265 --> 00:48:18,935
- Don't look at me, darling. Don't-

625
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:21,271
- Olive, off!.

626
00:48:21,354 --> 00:48:24,900
- Olive, off!.

627
00:48:24,983 --> 00:48:27,110
Let me fix you something to eat.

628
00:48:29,404 --> 00:48:32,324
You're a bleeder, huh?

629
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:34,659
Here, maintain pressure on that.

630
00:48:36,995 --> 00:48:41,041
Dr. Foster?
Could l have a word with you?

631
00:48:44,294 --> 00:48:46,755
Yeah,you got bit up pretty good.

632
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:50,175
- Get your rabies shot already?
- Yeah.

633
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,431
Look, l'm, uh-
l'm Sheriff Kennelly.

634
00:48:56,515 --> 00:48:59,851
Now, l-l know you already
spoke with Deputy Carlyle...

635
00:48:59,935 --> 00:49:03,647
but l just wanted
to confirm a few things.

636
00:49:03,772 --> 00:49:08,693
You said the, uh- the assault took place
at 9625 Rickover Street?

637
00:49:08,777 --> 00:49:11,696
- That's right.
- The home belonging to the Letham family?

638
00:49:11,822 --> 00:49:15,367
Right. Her dog attacked me,
and... she needs some help.

639
00:49:15,492 --> 00:49:17,994
She has a severe head wound.
She should be in a hospital.

640
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:20,330
l went to high school
with Maureen Letham.

641
00:49:20,413 --> 00:49:23,792
Oh, yeah? Maybe you know her son, Henry.
He's a patient of mine.

642
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:27,337
l remember Henry.
Pale, skinny kid, always drawing pictures.

643
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,507
- Yeah, that's him.
- He kind of gave me the creeps.

644
00:49:30,632 --> 00:49:33,176
What's strange, Doctor-

645
00:49:33,301 --> 00:49:35,679
What l'm trying to figure out is...

646
00:49:35,762 --> 00:49:39,516
who you were speaking with
over there at 9625 Rickover Street.

647
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,727
l'm sorry. l thought we already
established Maureen Letham.

648
00:49:42,852 --> 00:49:45,564
She told you her name
was Maureen Letham?

649
00:49:45,689 --> 00:49:47,691
Yeah. We were talking
about her son.

650
00:49:47,816 --> 00:49:50,235
She wasn't entirely coherent.
She needs medical assistance.

651
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,154
But why did you want to talk
to this woman at 1:00 in the morning?

652
00:49:53,238 --> 00:49:55,907
Look, l'm treating her son.
lt's an emergency situation.

653
00:49:56,032 --> 00:49:59,411
The- Sheriff, she needs help.
She's lost a lot of blood.

654
00:50:00,745 --> 00:50:04,249
l told you l went to school
with Maureen Letham.

655
00:50:04,374 --> 00:50:06,918
l also went to her funeral.

656
00:50:07,043 --> 00:50:10,088
She's been dead for months.

657
00:50:10,213 --> 00:50:12,716
Car wreck-
her and her husband.

658
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:16,636
As far as l know, that house is empty still.
The family's trying to sell it.

659
00:50:16,761 --> 00:50:19,889
l spoke to Maureen Letham
an hour ago.

660
00:50:20,015 --> 00:50:23,435
lt's probably just
someone's confused.

661
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,564
So how long they keeping you here?

662
00:50:27,647 --> 00:50:31,568
l don't know. l gotta head back into the city.
Look, 9625 Rickover Street.

663
00:50:31,651 --> 00:50:34,738
l was there.
Henry's mother was there.

664
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:37,324
All right, Dr. Foster.

665
00:50:37,449 --> 00:50:40,118
We'll be in touch.
l've got your number.

666
00:50:45,123 --> 00:50:47,625
Sheriff?

667
00:50:49,961 --> 00:50:52,088
Sheriff?

668
00:50:52,172 --> 00:50:54,632
- Uh-huh.
- Mrs. Letham-

669
00:50:54,716 --> 00:50:56,718
Did she have brown eyes?

670
00:50:56,801 --> 00:51:00,305
Oh, no, sir.
Bluest eyes in town.

671
00:51:43,807 --> 00:51:49,020
No, no, no, no, no.

672
00:51:50,020 --> 00:52:00,020
