1
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,700
Ryan, what happened?

2
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,400
It's bad. It's not good.

3
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,500
What do you mean, it's
bad, Wolfe? Talk to us.

4
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,200
Horatio took a round to the chest,

5
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,400
and I got here too late.

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,900
He's gone.

7
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,800
What?
He's dead.

8
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,600
Oh, my God.

9
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,000
Calleigh...

10
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Eric, Horatio's dead.

11
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,900
Listen to me-- Horatio's gone.

12
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,600
He's dead.

13
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,600
Where is he? I
need to see him.

14
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
I released the body.

15
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,900
What?!
What?!

16
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,700
What the hell did
you do that for?

17
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,600
The first responder

18
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,400
waits for the team
to get here!

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,700
His team.
I'm sorry!

20
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,800
I didn't want him lying here

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,900
in his own blood
on the evening news,

22
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,400
I released the body!

23
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,700
How did you get here so fast?

24
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,700
I was running an errand nearby.

25
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,100
You left that interrogation
for an errand?

26
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,900
I left a stupid errand,
I dropped everything

27
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,400
as soon as I heard
it on the radio.

28
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,000
It just doesn't
make sense.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Let's focus.

30
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,500
Horatio had enemies.

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,000
We know that.

32
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,300
This must have been
someone close.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,300
We're gonna find out
who did this.

34
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,900
We find out!

35
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600

38
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,300
Where's Lieutenant Caine?

39
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,200
I released the body to
a federal agent 20 minutes ago.

40
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,300
Why would you do that?

41
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,800
The airstrip's
on government land.

42
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,500
Federal agency
has jurisdiction.

43
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,300
What was the agent's name?

44
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,100
I don't know.

45
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,400
What do you mean, you don't know?!
He had

46
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
He signed our release form,
took the remains.

47
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,500
The remains have a name.

48
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,200
Horatio Caine.
Yeah.

49
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,800
We're waiting for a statement
from the department.

50
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,500
Airport personnel are saying
that Lieutenant Caine is dead.

51
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,300
The shot was fatal.

52
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,400
How you doing?

53
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,600
Talked to everybody
from the crew to the tower.

54
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,100
Learn anything?

55
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,000
Private jet took off right about
the time the shot was reported.

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,700
It was bound for Puerto Rico.

57
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,200
What about witnesses?

58
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,500
Lot of noise on the ground,
planes taking off.

59
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,900
Nobody claims to have seen
or heard anything.

60
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,100
You know what I
don't understand is

61
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,600
what Horatio was doing out
here in the first place.

62
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,700
Well, this might explain it.

63
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,800
It's the flight manifest
from the jet.

64
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,600
Julia and Kyle were on board.

65
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,700
Where are they now?

66
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,500
Plane landed 40 minutes ago
in San Juan.

67
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,300
I've already talked
to local authorities.

68
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,400
No sign of them.

69
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,300
Well, let's stay on that,

70
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,800
'cause they're either
our two best suspects

71
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,700
or our two best witnesses.

72
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,500
Let's find out
who did this, Cal.

73
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,500
As long as we're
breathing, Frank.

74
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,100
I just can't wrap
my head around this.

75
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
Where's Wolfe?

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,300
Um, the last I saw,
he was walking the perimeter.

77
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:26,800
Why?

78
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,000
Something's just not right.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,300
He was here too quick,

80
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,600
and now I can't
find Horatio's body.

81
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,700
Eric, he's one of us.

82
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,800
Listen, I think I'm looking
at our first break.

83
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Got a partial shoeprint
here in the blood pool.

84
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,900
Someone walked
through his blood?

85
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,900
Yeah. Here, look.

86
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,600
Left a little fleck
of some kind.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,300
That looks like
coagulated blood.

88
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,600
One fleck of blood doesn't dry
on its own,

89
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
so this could be
from the killer.

90
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,200
I'm gonna rush it to the lab.

91
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,000
Running the fleck
from the shoe print?

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,900
Yeah, um, my-my hunch is right.

93
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,500
That blood is definitely
from a different source.

94
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,700
Pop it into CODIS.

95
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,800
I'm way ahead of you.

96
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,100
If ever there was a
time to get lucky.

97
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,800
Yeah, right.

98
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,600
Brett Hanson.

99
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,500
"Armed robbery, attempted
murder, assault."

100
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,600
Deceased?

101
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,800
This guy was killed
in jail yesterday.

102
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,300
So how does a dead man's blood wind up
at that airstrip?

103
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,200
Whoever killed Horatio walked
through Hanson's blood first.

104
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,800
Take off your shoe, Diaz.

105
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,500
You're the only person released from Miami
Dade Detention in the last 24 hours.

106
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,700
Gated out, 4:00
this morning. So?

107
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,200
So you went straight from jail
to the Miami Shores Airstrip?

108
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,900
Nah, I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

109
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,700
We found blood
from a man named Brett Hanson

110
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,500
at the scene of the murder.

111
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,600
You transferred that blood there
on the bottom of your shoe.

112
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,300
We know you're a associate
of Juan Ortega.

113
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,000
Who?

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't play dumb with me.

115
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,900
You hear me?
Don't play dumb with me.

116
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,500
Ortega manufactures and sells
fused alloyed bullets.

117
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,800
You know it, and we know it.

118
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,300
He sent you
to kill Horatio Caine

119
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,400
because he was after
those bullets.

120
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,200
Me? Nah.

121
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,300
I was there
trying to catch a flight.

122
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,900
Heard a shot, saw Caine go down.

123
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,100
You know, I figure
I'd take a picture.

124
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,400
Get credit for the hit.

125
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,600
Nice.

126
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,100
You get credit for the hit?

127
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,400
With Ortega? Hmm?

128
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,200
Well, you didn't fly anywhere.

129
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,300
How are you gonna explain that?

130
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,800
Hey, man, no
crime, no time.

131
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,200
Eric! Eric!

132
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,600
No crime, no time?!
Huh?

133
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,000
Get your hands
off of me.

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,400
You're going back
to the lockup.

135
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,000
You okay?

136
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,300
Check out this photo
on his phone.

137
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,700
There's a reflection in the blood pool
of the mntenance hanger.

138
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,700
It looks like
there's something on top.

139
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,800
That's not something.
That's someone.

140
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,200
Perfect vantage point
for a shooter.

141
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,800
Let's do this.

142
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,700
Surface is pristine.

143
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,800
No latents.

144
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,500
I've got a bandage.

145
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,200
I spoke to Agent Caldwell
this morning.

146
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
He had the same bandage.

147
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,700
If this is about
Manny Ortega,

148
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,200
I already told
Lieutenant Caine...

149
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,600
Ortega murder's
been solved.

150
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,700
I think I know who shot Horatio.

151
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,600
Oh, come on.

152
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,800
You don't think
I killed Horatio?

153
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,900
I've been tracking those
fused alloys for months.

154
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,000
He's helping.

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,200
You were trying to track down
the same supplier

156
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,600
Ortega.
Yeah.

157
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,100
And maybe
you got jealous.

158
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,400
I mean, you could want
the case for yourself,

159
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,100
you could be using the collar
to get promoted.

160
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,200
It wouldn't be the first time

161
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
a Fed crawled over the body
of a good cop,would it?

162
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,400
You watch your mouth.

163
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,700
Don't talk to me like that.

164
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,000
I'll talk to you
any way I see fit, young lady.

165
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,400
Now, if you've got
nothing else...

166
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,200
Oh, but I do.

167
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,300
It's the release form
for Horatio's body.

168
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,100
It was signed for
by an Agent Dean Redland.

169
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,700
We've matched
the handwriting to you.

170
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
The body's out
back, sir.

171
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,900
I don't have to say
another word to you.

172
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,600
I would love that.

173
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,000
In the meantime,

174
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,100
I'm going to get a warrant
for your phone.

175
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,500
You do that.

176
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,800
I've got Caldwell's PDA.

177
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,700
Okay.

178
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,200
If the guy did it, he was
working with someone.

179
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,600
Let's find out who.
Forensics?

180
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,100
No, surface computing.

181
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,700
Oh.

182
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,800
Hey, wait
a minute.

183
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,300
Check out that text.

184
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,700
"It's done."

185
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,200
Yeah, the time stamp
says it was sent

186
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,000
at the same time
H was shot.

187
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,100
And the text log gives us
the recipient's number.

188
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,200
Let's call it, see what we get.

189
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,400
Yeah, this is Wolfe.

190
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,800
Hello?

191
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,100
Ryan?

192
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,300
Yeah.

193
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,200
It all makes sense now.

194
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,600
How you got there so fast,

195
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,700
why you released the body.

196
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,900
Eric, I want you
to relax,

197
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,800
'cause this is not how it looks.
Really?

198
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,000
Because it looks like you and Caldwell
are responsible for Horatio's murder.

199
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,700
Really? 'Cause you're wrong.

200
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,000
He texted you, "It's done."

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,800
Yeah, what does,
"It's done" mean, Wolfe?

202
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,700
I was following orders.

203
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,600
Orders from who, Wolfe?

204
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,900
Orders from who, Wolfe?!

205
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,800
Hmm? From who?!

206
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,900
From Horatio.

207
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,700
I don't believe anything
you're saying.

208
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,000
You tell us what you know.

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He's alive.

210
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,300
What?

211
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,000
Horatio is alive.

212
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,300
The M.E. was an ATF plant.

213
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,500
Ortega was sending
someone to kill him.

214
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,200
Horatio Caine.

215
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,600
Y quiero saber cuando
esta hecho.
(I want to know it's done.)

216
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,100
Saris wanted him dead, too.

217
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,400
The only way he was
going to survive is

218
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,800
he was going to stage
his own execution.

219
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,400
Every gang that Saris sold
those fused alloys to

220
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,700
are coming after you.

221
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,700
Including someone even
closer to home.

222
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,500
Find the fused alloys,

223
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,400
take down this
entire operation.

224
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,600
But why me?

225
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,700
Because you have a problem
with fused alloys.

226
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,400
And you're a dead shot.

227
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,800
I'm going underground
to flush Saris out.

228
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,200
Caldwell did
the shooting.

229
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,100
I was responsible
for the blood.

230
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,700
That's why I left
the interrogation.

231
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,700
What about the others?

232
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,500
No one knows anything
till this over. Agreed?

233
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,200
Where's Horatio now?

234
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,900
He could be anywhere.

235
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,900
Dad. I heard a noise.

236
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,600
It's me, son.

237
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,500
You're okay.

238
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,400
Horatio?

239
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,200
We didn't think
we'd see you again.

240
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
We did just what
you said to do.

241
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,600
We waited
and now we're leaving.

242
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,100
I need more time,
Julia.

243
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,500
What am I supposed
to tell Ron?

244
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,100
I don't want you
to see Ron.

245
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,500
That man is my husband.

246
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,900
And that is your
problem, Julia.

247
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,100
I need four more hours.

248
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,400
Mom, just give
him more time.

249
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,500
Hang on, son.

250
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,700
I need to talk to your mom
alone for a minute.

251
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,300
What's this?

252
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,900
This is the key to a safe place.

253
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,400
There's been a change in plans.

254
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,700
I want you and Kyle to go there

255
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,600
and wait for my call.

256
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,200
Where are you going to go?

257
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,400
I'm going underground.

258
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,100
Thank you for coming,
Miguel.

259
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,200
You called, I'm here.

260
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,300
Lieutenant,

261
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:54,900
my foundation represents vital
Cuban-American interests from Miami.

262
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,800
Does this affect
my community?

263
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,900
Everyone is effected
by this, Miguel.

264
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,000
I see.

265
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,800
You saved my life three
years ago, Lieutenant.

266
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,100
And I meant it when I said,
"Anything you need."

267
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,400
Those bullets need to come
off the street now

268
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,700
On the phone you mentioned
$10 million.

269
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,400
If you don't mind
me asking,

270
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,100
why can't you go to the police
department for this money?

271
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,900
My... situation
is complicated.

272
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,800
Lieutenant,
I trust you completely.

273
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,100
You will retrieve
these bullets.

274
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,600
Lives will be spared.

275
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,000
If it's the last thing I do.

276
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,700
All right, what do you people
want from me?

277
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,300
You sold some fused
alloy rounds

278
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,900
to a buyer in Miami.

279
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,600
Now, what kind of businessman
would I be

280
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,300
if I gave  my customers, huh?

281
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,800
Then, uh,

282
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:07,000
Eric here is going to take you on
a little ride through gang

283
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,200
Let you sit up front.

284
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,100
You know in the
"informant" seat.

285
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,700
Let's go.

286
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,800
Horatio.

287
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Back from the dead.

288
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,700
Frank Tripp called.

289
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,200
Said you were gone.

290
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,500
I didn't want to
believe him.

291
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,300
Yelina, the only thing
that matters right now

292
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,500
is Ron Saris believes it.

293
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,600
Right.

294
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,900
With you gone,
he drops his guard

295
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,200
and walks into your trap.

296
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,100
That's my plan.

297
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,800
Is this the cash
for Saris?

298
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
That's the money.

299
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,700
What if he asks me
where it comes from?

300
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,700
You convince him you're
a foreign entity looking to buy.

301
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,800
Military perhaps?

302
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,900
Perhaps.

303
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,600
But the $10 million
is incentive.

304
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,700
You won't have a problem.

305
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,500
When I meet with him
where will you be?

306
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,400
I'll be close by.

307
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,300
Yelina, be careful.

308
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Sit up tall, Ortega.

309
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,700
Gang town's coming up.

310
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,600
You can do what you want
to me, man.

311
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
It's too late for you guys.

312
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,000
Too late for what?

313
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,400
Balance of power has
already shifted.

314
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,700
Shut up.

315
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,500
Tell us where to find the rest
of those fused alloys.

316
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,900
Stay with him!

317
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,700
Hey, I need you to stay calm--
I'm gonna help you out, all right?

318
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,600
Help me!

319
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,500
Turn your face.

320
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,100
Turn your face away.

321
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,300
Watch your face.

322
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Watch your face.

323
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,400
All right.
Seat belt.

324
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,300
Your seat belt.
Come on.

325
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,300
Stay put!

326
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,900
Here we go,
come on.

327
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,000
Watch your legs.

328
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,100
Ortega!

329
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,400
Get down!

330
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,500
Everybody get down!

331
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,000
Everything's gonna be okay now.

332
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,700
All right? You're safe.

333
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,400
All right?
Yeah.

334
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,500
3104!

335
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,800
Shots fired.
Officer needs assistance.

336
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,500
Fourth and Bay.

337
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,300
They openeup
on that truck.

338
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,500
Driver's dead,
guard's injured.

339
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,700
Money's gone.

340
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,200
Perfect ambush.

341
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Fused alloys?

342
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,300
Yeah. They went right through
that bulletproof armor.

343
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,700
All right. Thanks.

344
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,600
Yeah.

345
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,500
You okay?

346
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,100
I'll be fine.

347
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,300
Any information you can give
us will be real helpful.

348
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,700
We stopped at a red.

349
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,300
Something was wrong, you know?

350
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,300
The light just wouldn't
turn green.

351
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,600
It was like
we were set up.

352
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,700
And then
they just started shooting.

353
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,900
Run it, run the red!

354
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,200
Relax.

355
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,600
It's bulletproof
glass. We're safe.

356
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,900
We're going to find
whoever did this.

357
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,300
I promise.

358
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,200
H?

359
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,900
I lost him.

360
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,800
I lost Ortega.

361
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,400
How?

362
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,800
Woman got trapped in her car.

363
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,100
If I didn't save her,
she was gonna die.

364
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,400
Okay, so you did
the right thing.

365
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,000
Let's contact Metro,
see if they can help us.

366
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,600
Why Wolfe?

367
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,900
Why didn't you come to me?

368
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,400
Eric, you were the
obvious choice,

369
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
and there was a chance
this was going to fail.

370
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,600
I didn't want
that for you.

371
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,000
It still may.

372
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,700
Let's make sure that it doesn't.

373
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,100
Got something-- clean round.

374
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,800
Well, we get a match,
we might get a shooter.

375
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,400
You know what I don't get?

376
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,800
Why kill the driver?

377
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,700
Fused alloys pierce armor
and kill people, Calleigh.

378
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,100
They can't open that door.

379
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,100
So they needed the
keys to get the cash?

380
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,600
That's exactly right.

381
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,900
I've got epithelials
on this glass.

382
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,900
You get a name, maybe we'll get
closer to those bullets.

383
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,200
Todd Keener.

384
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,600
Age 22, gang affiliation.

385
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,800
The Crypt Kings?

386
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Hold on. The Crypt Kings--

387
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,900
that's not part
of Ortega's gang.

388
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,800
That means
these bullets are everywhere.

389
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,400
Mr. Keener, you know
you left evidence of yourself

390
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,400
at the armed robbery today.

391
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,700
That means we've got you
for felony murder.

392
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,500
I didn't shoot nobody.

393
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,100
Then tell us who did.

394
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,200
I don't rat out
my boys, either.

395
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,900
Oh, yeah?

396
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,100
Well, cooperating's
all you've got.

397
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,800
Well, I guess
we're both losers then.

398
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,400
Take him.

399
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,300
You cops-- you
just don't get it.

400
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,900
You're on
the short end.

401
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,400
Gangs got all the ammo.

402
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,800
You're nothing but ducks
on a pond.

403
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,100
I said get him out of here.

404
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,300
These bullets
are everywhere, H.

405
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,600
What do we do?

406
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,100
I am working on it.

407
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,900
Mr. Saris?

408
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,800
You know, on the phone,

409
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,900
you didn't sound quite this lovely.

410
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,400
Did you come prepared
to do business?

411
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,300
Depends on who you are.

412
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,900
What's more
important is,

413
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,200
who I represent.

414
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,300
I'm listening.

415
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,700
I have a client who wishes to purchase a
large amount of fused alloy rounds.

416
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,900
And who is this client?

417
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,300
Whoever he might be.

418
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,600
His money's American.

419
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,600
And, uh, how many of these supposed rounds
are you looking to buy?

420
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,400
All of Ortega's supply.

421
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,600
Word is, you have
possession of them.

422
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,400
What do you think I am?
You think I'm stupid?

423
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Who are you?

424
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,700
Really?

425
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,500
And who sent you here?

426
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:24,100
I represent a consortium of
global military interests.

427
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,000
And I'm authorized
to pay you any price.

428
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,800
Okay.

429
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,200
I' sell you all
of Ortega's bullets

430
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,500
and all the gangs
that he sold them to.

431
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,000
Oh, right.

432
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,700
I'll approach those entities
on my own, thank you.

433
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,500
Entities?

434
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,900
The Crypt Kings,
The Rhodes Gang.

435
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,800
I mean, they'll be stripping
all that money off you,

436
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,500
and then they'll strip
everything else... off you.

437
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Let me guess.

438
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,800
You'll buy back the bullets

439
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,100
and sell them to me
at double the price.

440
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,800
Gorgeous, I'm just trying
to protect you.

441
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,600
Sure you are.

442
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
You get those
bullets back,

443
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,400
and I promise you...

444
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,300
I'll make you a
very wealthy man.

445
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,100
That's just a
down payment.

446
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,700
Okay.

447
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,700
How am I gonna get in touch
with you?

448
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,500
That's my phone.

449
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,600
You text this number when you've dealt
with the gangs...

450
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,200
and have the bullets.

451
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,400
I keep a boat down
at the marina, okay?

452
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,600
That's where I'm gonna be.

453
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,200
Ortega escaped when the radio car
was rear-ended.

454
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,100
Yeah? Well, there's blood
on the passenger side door,

455
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,300
so Ortega cut himself
getting out.

456
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,500
He's on foot,
headed east.

457
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,000
Let's see what he left behind.

458
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,400
Got a blood drop here.

459
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
Oh, yeah, look at that.

460
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,000
That spatter pattern,
angled impact.

461
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,400
Long ellipse with a tail.

462
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Ortega was running for his life.

463
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
In this direction.

464
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,600
Got another one.

465
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,800
Let's keep going.

466
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,500
The blood stops here.

467
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Must have stolen a car
from here and gotten away.

468
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,100
It's a dead end.

469
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,900
This is the traffic light
Horatio wanted us to check into?

470
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,300
Yeah, from the armored car
robbery, but luckily for us,

471
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,700
it's an intelligent
intersection,

472
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,000
and it interacts
with a PCS.

473
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,400
The priority control system?

474
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,700
Yup. Those hand-held devices.

475
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,300
When the user pushed a button,
the traffic signal changes.

476
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,700
It's used mainly
by emergency personnel.

477
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,100
Metro reported
a system override.

478
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,900
Eastbound light is green,
and all the others are red.

479
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,000
So that armored car
didn't stand a chance, did it?

480
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,500
If somebody altered the signal,
how do we get an ID?

481
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,700
Well, you know, the beautiful thing
about intelligent

482
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,600
They keep
a record.

483
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,000
They got a database of
every cop, firefighter,

484
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,900
medical personnel.

485
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,200
The emitter's registered
to an ATF agent.

486
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,100
Jake Berkeley.

487
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,900
It's been a while.

488
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,900
I'm sorry.

489
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,900
For just disappearing like that.

490
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,100
I had to go
off the grid.

491
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,200
Is that a euphemism
for not picking up the phone?

492
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,500
I had to rejoin ATF.

493
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,500
I'm back with my undercover
detail with the the Crypt Kings.

494
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,600
Yeah, I figured as much.

495
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,200
An infrared traffic device
was used today

496
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,800
in an ambushed armed robbery.

497
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,200
A man was killed.

498
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,800
What has that got to do with me?

499
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,300
We ran a check

500
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,100
and traced the device
back to you.

501
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,200
I was assigned that thing
from the bureau.

502
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
One of the bikers took it.

503
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,800
I haven't seen it since.

504
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,600
The Crypt Kings look good
for this.

505
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,700
We need your help.

506
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,500
That could take some time.

507
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
We don't have any time.

508
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,300
Whato you want me to do?

509
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,000
Well, how far undercover
are you?

510
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,500
What are you implying?

511
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,900
Exactly what you think
I'm implying.

512
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,900
I'll see what I can find out.

513
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,300
Crypt Kings.

514
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,100
Howdy doody, fellas.

515
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,500
You're all very scary.

516
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,800
Very scary.

517
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,300
You got all the
bullets, right?

518
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,100
Money first, my friend.

519
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,400
I'm gonna need
all the rounds

520
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,500
that Ortega sold you
guys last month.

521
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,400
Well, minus what we used
in today's heist.

522
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,500
Armored car
job downtown.

523
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,600
Tell you what, for you,
I'll make it

524
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,000
eight bucks a round,
but you got to do the math.

525
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,100
Oh, I've done the math

526
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,500
for both of
us, you moron.

527
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Here it is, okay?

528
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,600
the penny,

529
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,900
double what u paid.

530
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,000
There we go.

531
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,700
I guess we got stones

532
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,700
doing this deal
in broad daylight.

533
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,700
With Caine dead,
are you kidding me?

534
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,400
It's gonna be like
the wild, wild West.

535
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,400
We're all gonna get
rich, me first.

536
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,600
Come on, come on!

537
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,400
Get your guys going.

538
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,900
I got three more
stops in an hour.

539
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,700
Horatio, connection's been made.

540
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,000
Hey, Eric?

541
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,300
Did you get anything
on Julia Winston's Mercedes?

542
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,400
No, nothing, I'm
still waiting.

543
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,500
Where does that leave us?

544
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,400
I'm not sure yet.

545
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,000
Take ???

546
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,300
and...???

547
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,800
Wait ???

548
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,100
???

549
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,900
You ???

550
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,700
That's ???

551
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,500
Ok, ???

552
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,200
???

553
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,100
Who's ???

554
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,000
Diaz's ???

555
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,300
That's ???

556
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,000
We ???

557
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,800
I ???

558
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,400
???

559
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Diaz's cell phone.

560
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
Okay, we should
work backwards.

561
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,900
We should do the most
recent phone calls first.

562
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,900
Only one phone call
received today.

563
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,600
From Ortega.
All right, let's ping it

564
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,000
and see if we get a hit.
Okay.

565
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Triangulating.

566
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,600
Searching.

567
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,100
Can you get a clear
picture up here?

568
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,400
Yeah, sure.

569
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,400
Ortega's at an airstrip at the edge
of the Glades.

570
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,600
And so am I.

571
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,500
Hands up! Let me see 'em!

572
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,200
You'll be dead
before you hit the ground.

573
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,700
Taken down by a dead man.

574
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,100
I didn't do it, Caine.

575
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,000
Must be millions
in these bags.

576
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,100
The gangs bought
a lot of bullets.

577
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,700
Ron Saris--
he hijacked everything.

578
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,700
You don't know
the half of it.

579
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,500
Thank you, Juan.

580
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Book him.

581
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,400
Takes care of Ortega.

582
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,500
Saved ATF a bundle--
nice job.

583
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,600
I've got some
bad news for you.

584
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,300
Those bullets
are still on the street.

585
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,900
What? Who's got them?

586
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,800
I'll take it from here.

587
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,500
Hey.

588
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,900
Hey.

589
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,900
What are you doing here?

590
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,900
I brought you something.

591
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,700
Three .45s,

592
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,500
two Mac Tens,
full auto.

593
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,500
Took them from the
Crypt King safe house.

594
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,400
All these guns were used
in the ambush today.

595
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,600
This is amazing.

596
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,000
I'll compare it to the fused
alloy round I've got,

597
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,300
see if I get a match.

598
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,900
You get a match,
I'll give you a whole crew.

599
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,100
How'd you get out
without getting noticed?

600
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,800
I didn't.

601
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,000
They're looking
for me right now,

602
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,400
and if they find me, I'm dead.

603
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,800
That's an incredible sacrifice
to make for the case.

604
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,400
I didn't do it
for the case, Calleigh.

605
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,500
I did it for you.

606
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,400
Thank you.

607
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,600
So what happens now?

608
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,300
Well, ATF will send me
somewhere,

609
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,900
put me on ice
for a while.

610
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,300
Six months, a year.

611
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,500
But there's
no guarantee.

612
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,300
No, there's never
a guarantee.

613
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,500
I was kind of hoping
that you would wait.

614
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,900
I feel like the
last couple months,

615
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,100
all I've been
doing is waiting.

616
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,800
It's terrifying for me.

617
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,300
I wonder every day if
I will see you again,

618
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,600
if something
happens to you

619
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,900
if I would
know about it.

620
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,200
I can't live like that.

621
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,100
What happened to your face?

622
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,800
I had an altercation
with a thug.

623
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,500
It's nothing.

624
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,800
Horatio was so stupid to think that I'd
ever leave you.

625
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,200
Forget him.

626
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,700
Forget that name, okay?

627
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,600
He's dead to us, okay?

628
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,600
You know what?

629
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,400
This right there...
that's only the beginning.

630
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,000
What's in those
boxes, Ron?

631
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,200
Thought you'd never ask.

632
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,700
Fused alloy bullets.

633
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,400
That's the whole shipment.

634
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,200
A whole shipment
in all those boxes,

635
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,900
and we've got more
down in the hull of the boat.

636
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,100
You don't need
to do this.

637
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,200
I've got money.

638
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,700
My money this time.

639
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,800
So, what's our plan?

640
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,400
We're gonna sail
out of here,

641
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,000
you and me,
all these bullets.

642
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,600
I've got a buyer
in South America

643
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,600
who has an eless need
for fused alloys.

644
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,800
Money and me.

645
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,400
And bullets.

646
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,800
What more could
a woman want, right?

647
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,200
A divorce.

648
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,800
A what?

649
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,000
A wh...

650
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,400
What the hell is this?

651
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,200
It's called irreconcilable
differences, Ron.

652
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,300
No, don't do this.

653
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,200
What are you doing?

654
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,100
No.

655
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,500
No, it's not gonna go
down like this, Horatio.

656
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,200
It's my boat-- you
gonna shoot me?

657
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,100
Don't do it, Ron.
Shoot me in the back?

658
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,300
Ron!

659
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,100
We searched everywhere.

660
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,900
There's still no body.

661
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,300
We got to keep looking, Eric.

662
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm with you, H,
what do you want to do?

663
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,100
Whatever it takes.

664
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,500
We'll find him.

665
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,400
You and me?

666
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,700
You and me, Eric.

667
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,600
This never ends, does it?

668
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,500
And it never will.

669
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:38,000
