<i>- Who is she?</i> - The recently
deceased Harriet Gould of Astoria.

2
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:13,365
No surviving relatives.
She's perfect.

3
00:00:13,436 --> 00:00:16,803
- She even has a bun.
- That's her.

4
00:00:16,872 --> 00:00:19,670
Dr. Marie Charles.

5
00:00:19,742 --> 00:00:22,176
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:57,677
<i>Every bull</i>
<i>begins a relationship... </i>

7
00:00:57,746 --> 00:01:00,681
with certain cards
up his sleeve... aces.

8
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:05,118
Tools of seduction
by which he lures a new cow.

9
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:07,451
One of the most
notorious examples...

10
00:01:07,523 --> 00:01:09,582
<i>is the current cow</i>
<i>sob story. </i>

11
00:01:09,658 --> 00:01:13,856
<i>Allow me to deconstruct</i>
<i>the essential elements. </i>

12
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:16,796
You're so easy to talk to,

13
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:19,528
not like my current cow.

14
00:01:19,602 --> 00:01:22,002
This is key to understanding
the myth of male shyness,

15
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:24,005
for though you think
he is flattering you,

16
00:01:24,073 --> 00:01:26,007
he is actually
flattering himself,

17
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:29,636
showing how open
and sensitive and honest he is.

18
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,308
I just try so hard and...

19
00:01:36,385 --> 00:01:39,843
Well, I'm sure she doesn't
mean to be such a cold cow.

20
00:01:39,922 --> 00:01:43,289
<i>Just in case you're starting</i> <i>to think he's
a coldhearted,</i> <i>home-wrecking womanizer,</i>

21
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,157
he'll throw this in just to prove
he's putting his current cow...

22
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:48,162
<i>out to pasture for good reason,</i>

23
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,597
<i>and that he's actually</i> <i>tormented with
guilt at</i> <i>the thought of abandoning her. </i>

24
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:54,932
What's that thing they always say
about the love of a good woman?

25
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:57,837
<i>That, once offered,</i>
<i>it's guaranteed to come back... </i>

26
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:59,841
<i>and bite her in the ass. </i>

27
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:02,207
<i>- Enter case in point. </i>
- Hey.

28
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:04,678
- Hey.
- Thought you were with what's her name.

29
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:08,808
- Didn't work out.
- You have a little saddle sore on that white horse of yours?

30
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:13,914
- Okay, so what happened?
- Just lost interest.

31
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:16,617
What do you mean,
you lost interest?

32
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:18,717
How exactly?

33
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:22,821
Christ, Jane, do we really have
to have another postmortem?

34
00:02:22,898 --> 00:02:26,061
I'm just curious is all.
So you went to a movie,

35
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:29,070
<i>then back to her place?</i>

36
00:02:29,138 --> 00:02:32,164
Then what?

37
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:34,232
So we're in the kitchen
getting a drink,

38
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,244
and suddenly, she starts
looking for food.

39
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:39,611
We had dinner right after the
movie, but... I don't know.

40
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:42,947
She was still hungry.
She's always hungry, it seems.

41
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:46,385
And that's bad,
Women who eat?

42
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:54,021
Okay, so you're in the kitchen,
she's hungry again, inexplicably,

43
00:02:54,096 --> 00:02:55,961
then what?

44
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:59,626
So she takes out a pint
of Haagen-Dazs... a pint...

45
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:03,035
<i>and just starts eating it</i>
<i>right out of the container,</i>

46
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:06,472
and there was just something
about it that turned me off.

47
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:09,568
Was the refrigerator door open?

48
00:03:09,645 --> 00:03:12,443
<i>- Why?</i> - Answer the
question. Open or closed?

49
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:14,539
It was open, I think.

50
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:16,642
<i>Would it have</i> <i>made a
difference</i> <i>if it were shut?</i>

51
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,620
<i>Would that have made</i> <i>the act of a
nonfat woman</i> <i>eating ice cream... </i>

52
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:21,622
a little less revolting to you?

53
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,558
<i>What if she'd not had dinner?</i>
<i>What if she were legitimately hungry... </i>

54
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:28,620
before she shoved her face
into a trough of Haagen-Dazs?

55
00:03:28,697 --> 00:03:30,631
<i>Would it have repulsed you less</i>
<i>if she used a dish?</i>

56
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:33,964
- Good night, you psycho!
- Good night, neophiliac!

57
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,839
<i>- Are you sitting down?</i>

58
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,777
Oprah read the article
on her show today.

59
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:47,008
The audience went so crazy for it,
she called us personally,

60
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:49,016
begging for Dr. Charles
to appear as her guest.

61
00:03:49,084 --> 00:03:52,485
- What?
- I told everyone in P.R. A different story.

62
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:55,819
She's vacationing in Hong Kong.
She's at a conference in Tangiers.

63
00:03:55,891 --> 00:03:59,349
- Oh, this is bad.
- No, no, no. This is all good.

64
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:02,056
Okay? Trust me.
I've got it all under control.

65
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:04,691
This won't come
anywhere near you.

66
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:07,327
"And so, while the male
may often seem shy...

67
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:12,466
"with all his Uriah Heep hand-wringin'
and 'aw, shucks' toe-kickin',

68
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,237
"he's actually a narcissist...

69
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:20,715
"because this apparent shyness belies
the more deeply rooted feelings...

70
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:24,617
<i>"of unworthiness</i>
<i>and fear of rejection. </i>

71
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:28,885
"And this is what compels him
to constantly seek attention...

72
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:34,793
<i>from new cow after new cow</i>
<i>ad nauseam, ad infinitum. "</i>

73
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:37,195
<i>This is such great stuff. </i>

74
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:40,258
It obliterates any sentimentality
we might have...

75
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:42,668
about what
noble creatures men are.

76
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:46,003
This right here is what we've been
looking for. It's-It's provocative.

77
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:49,511
It's clever. It's got mass
appeal written all over it.

78
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:52,376
There's just one problem. Nobody
can seem to find this woman.

79
00:04:52,448 --> 00:04:54,746
<i>The</i> Today Show's <i>tried. </i>
Oprah's <i>tried. </i>

80
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:56,978
- Yeah, and have you tried?
<i>- Eddie?</i>

81
00:04:57,052 --> 00:05:00,419
- Uh, well, no.
- Well, get on it!

82
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:03,583
Do you realize what
we're talking about here?

83
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:07,459
- The ungettable get? <i>
- Yes!</i>

84
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:11,556
<i>I don't care what it takes. </i>
<i>You find that Dr. Marie Charles... </i>

85
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:14,671
<i>and bring her here</i>
<i>to my studio. </i>

86
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:17,204
Let me get this straight. Your best
friend works at <i>M</i> magazine...

87
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:19,366
and she has no idea
where this cow doctor is?

88
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:21,501
That's what she said.

89
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:23,545
<i> I don't buy that. </i>
<i>Why are you holding out on me?</i>

90
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:25,740
<i> I'm not!</i>
<i>I told you she's working on it!</i>

91
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:27,783
- Just give me her number.
- I'm not gonna give you her number.

92
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,408
- Why not?
- She's working on it!

93
00:05:29,485 --> 00:05:31,953
- Besides, you'd never reach her. She's at Jivamukti.
- Huh?

94
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:33,989
- Yoga.
- Yoga what?

95
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:36,355
- Jivamukti.
- Jiv...

96
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:42,392
- Manhattan. Jivamukti.
<i>- Eddie!</i>

97
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:44,956
It's a yoga place.

98
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:47,559
Eddie, don't be a jerk!

99
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:53,740
Eddie, come on!

100
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,540
- This is so ridiculous.
- Ohhh!

101
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:59,513
Hey, hey, you have
to leave your shoes in here.

102
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:06,113
Liz?
Excuse me.

103
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:10,888
Jerk, she is my best friend.
I would certainly know if...

104
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,087
<i>- Jane?</i>

105
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,264
Stay!

106
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:19,768

- Excuse me, sir,</i> <i>you're gonna have to leave. </i>

107
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:21,895
Gee. Sorry. I know.
I'm just looking for a friend.

108
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:24,303
Oh.

109
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:26,967
<i>- Sorry. You okay?</i>
- Eddie.

110
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:34,542
How you doin', Becca?

111
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:36,710
I'm good.

112
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:40,622
What are you
doing here?

113
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:46,654
I, uh... I-I don't know.

114
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:49,955
Come, class. Let's forget
about this disturbance.

115
00:06:50,032 --> 00:06:52,023
<i>It's okay. Everyone,</i>
<i>let's come on up. </i>

116
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:55,298
<i>Get back to your spaces</i>
<i>and let's prepare for lion pose. </i>

117
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:59,000
<i>Hey, inhale. Exhale. </i>
<i>Open your mouth. </i>

118
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:01,100
Stick out your tongue.

119
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:04,704
That was Rebecca?
Eddie, talk to me.

120
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:06,715
There's nothing
to talk about.

121
00:07:06,783 --> 00:07:10,514
- Hi, Liz.
- I cannot believe it.

122
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:13,282
- Hey, Janey!
- Hi! Hi, guys!

123
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:16,621
Eddie, this is my sister Alice
and my brother-in-law Stephen.

124
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:20,321
- You're... Eddie.
- Yeah. Hey.

125
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:22,728
- Are you two taking yoga class together?
- No.

126
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:26,735
- We were just... I... It-It's stupid.
<i>- No, no, it's not stupid. </i>

127
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:29,294
- We don't think it's stupid.
- No. We just started the pregnancy class.

128
00:07:29,372 --> 00:07:31,363
- Oh, yeah. Congratulations.

129
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,466
- Thanks. She's a great breather.
- Listen, I gotta go.

130
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:37,206
- Hey, it was really nice to meet
you, Eddie. <i>- Bye-bye. </i>

131
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:19,344
<i>Eddie preferred</i>
<i>to leave things unsaid... </i>

132
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:23,425
<i>and went back to grazing</i>
<i>in greener pastures. </i>

133
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:28,226
<i>Merry Christmas. </i>

134
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:30,287
Merry Christmas, everyone.

135
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:32,299
Merry Christmas.

136
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:35,268
- I'm getting out of here.
- Okay.

137
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:40,070
- Uh, two champagnes, please.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:43,668
Shouldn't that be a champagne
and a Shirley Temple?

139
00:08:43,745 --> 00:08:46,908
- Sorry.
- No, you're not.

140
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:50,781
- So where'd you meet her?
- She's Emily's roommate.

141
00:08:50,852 --> 00:08:54,083
Emily that I made
coffee for last Sunday?

142
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:56,487
Uh-huh.

143
00:08:56,558 --> 00:08:58,719
Isn't that complicated?

144
00:08:58,793 --> 00:09:02,593
It's never complicated, Jane.

145
00:09:02,664 --> 00:09:04,655
Thank you.

146
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:24,776
Evening, sir.
What can I get you?

147
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:26,980
- Scotch, please.
- Yes, sir.

148
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:30,582
Did you hear Diane's
joke about the reindeer?

149
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:34,127
Funny!

150
00:09:37,932 --> 00:09:39,991
<i>- Here you go. </i>
<i>- Thank you. </i>

151
00:09:49,444 --> 00:09:51,844
I miss you, Jane.

152
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:02,420
Am I... Am I supposed
to walk away now?

153
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:09,060
No.

154
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,294
Can we get away from this?
Can we do something?

155
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:15,996
Get together for lunch,
dinner, Friday night.

156
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:21,198
Friday is New Year's Eve.

157
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:25,645
Oh, that's right.
That's right.

158
00:10:25,713 --> 00:10:27,647
You probably have
some, uh, plans.

159
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:29,649
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

160
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:32,811
Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.

161
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:36,254
I have...

162
00:10:36,324 --> 00:10:39,885
No.

163
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:43,897
I have none.

164
00:10:43,965 --> 00:10:49,335
Could I call you?
Would that be okay?

165
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:54,975
Yeah.

166
00:10:56,644 --> 00:11:00,375
Merry Christmas, Jane.

167
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:04,714
<i>- Yee-haaaw!</i>

168
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:07,846
Well, you can't stop now.
We'll do it together.

169
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:10,117
You're syndicated
in over 300 newspapers.

170
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:12,182
Talk radio is having
a field day with it.

171
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,320
Clearly the world
is one giant used-cow lot.

172
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:19,230
- Look, I just want to think about it, okay?
- What's there to think about?

173
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,734
You don't want to be
a post-feminist icon?

174
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:26,001
Come on. Let's get something great to
wear for Julian’s New Year's Eve party.

175
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:32,073
I meant to tell you that...
I kind of made other plans.

176
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:34,512
I mean, it's nothing major.
It's not a big...

177
00:11:34,582 --> 00:11:36,948
- Well...
- What are you talking about?

178
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:41,387
- Ray asked me out.
- Ray?

179
00:11:41,456 --> 00:11:44,482
As in Ray Brown?

180
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,493
As in devil incarnate?

181
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:48,654
No! No, I forbid it!

182
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,823
L- I-I thought you
were over this.

183
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:53,765
I think I'm having
second thoughts.

184
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:59,296
Oh, so now... Dr. Charles
is having them too.

185
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:12,477
- Done yet?
<i>- You got a hot date?</i>

186
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:15,147
- No, I just have to pee.
- Be my guest.

187
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:17,817
- What's this, party Viagra?
- Huh?

188
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:20,019
No, it's nicotine gum.

189
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:24,463
- When did you quit?
- Oh, since Daphne told me she wanted to marry a smoker.

190
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:26,830
Here.

191
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:28,960
Thank you.

192
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:31,198
Why don't you put on a dress
and come out with me tonight?

193
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:33,536
Why, so I can
trail after your harem?

194
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:36,168
- I'm flying solo. I thought I'd keep my options open. <i>
- </i>

195
00:12:36,244 --> 00:12:38,178
Yeah?

196
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:40,214
<i>Although</i>
<i>that may be for me. </i>

197
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:43,875
- Hello.
- You're home.

198
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:45,475
Does this mean you've
come to your senses?

199
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:47,748
No, and I only have
an hour to get ready.

200
00:12:47,822 --> 00:12:49,881
So quit worrying about me.
Go out. Have a good time.

201
00:12:49,957 --> 00:12:51,891
I'm going to wear that red lipstick
you gave, and I'll call you tomorrow.

202
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,893
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

203
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:03,396
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

204
00:13:05,273 --> 00:13:07,969
- Doing what?
- Ray.

205
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:10,738
I don't know what
you're talking about.

206
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:13,747
Okay.

207
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:19,014
- Well, if you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
- Oh, thanks.

208
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:21,885
I think I'll...
jump into my pj's,

209
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:24,356
probably
watch a little TV...

210
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:26,689
- go to bed early...
<i>- Happy New Year. </i>

211
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:28,786
- Same to you!

212
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:53,683
<i> Now, back</i> <i>to our special New
Year's Eve</i> <i>coverage with Hugh Downs. </i>

213
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:56,383
To recap, it was
less than 48 hours ago...

214
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:58,823
that Ray Brown called
to confirm his plans...

215
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:00,986
to take Jane Goodale out
this evening,

216
00:14:01,062 --> 00:14:03,360
a clear indication
that he was, indeed,

217
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:06,594
regretting his decision
to terminate their involvement.

218
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:10,467
So the question remains,
why hasn't he shown up yet?

219
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:14,304
<i>By all accounts,</i> <i>it would appear
that Mr. Brown</i> <i>is sticking firmly... </i>

220
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,900
<i>to his September sanctions. </i>

221

<i>Nine, eight, seven,</i>

six, five, four,
three, two, one!

00:15:52,273 --> 00:15:54,264
Ahh...

00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:42,650
- L-I need to talk to you.
- Shh...

232
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:46,160
Excuse me. Why didn't you...
Why didn't you return my calls?

233
00:16:46,227 --> 00:16:48,252
You mean the calls that came
after the call you didn't make?

234
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:50,490
L...
This is not true.

235
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:54,160
It's so true.

236
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:00,832
Will you stop
for just a moment?

237

<i>- Hey, Jane. </i>
- Listen, I know it was inexcus...

- Hi, Jane. Ray.

239
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:08,371
<i>- There's a reason I didn't showup that night. </i>
- I'm sure there is.

240
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:10,383
And you know what?
I couldn't possibly care less.

241
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:12,385
So let's forget about it.
Okay!

242
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:14,614
I don't suppose you're
interested in hearing me out.

243
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:16,816
You know what, Ray?
The truth is...

244
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:19,689
Hi!
You did me a favor.

245
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:22,628
Any delusions I may have still
had about you, they're gone now.

246
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:26,295
<i>It was a gift. </i>
<i>You released me. </i>

247
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:28,858
- For the first time in months, I feel great. <i>
- </i>

248
00:17:28,937 --> 00:17:32,737
- Staff meeting in my office in two minutes.
- Okay, be right there.

249
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:38,970
Uh, what's wrong?

250
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:42,107
Diane's wearing your shirt.

251
00:17:42,183 --> 00:17:45,118
<i>The shirt I bought you</i>
<i>on the sidewalk. </i>

252
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:53,923
<i>So, does that mean</i>
<i>that the, uh... </i>

253
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:57,795
- the two of you are...
- Seeing each other again.

254
00:17:57,866 --> 00:18:01,324
<i>- Yes. That's what I've been trying to explain. </i>
- Wait. Stop.

255
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:03,734
Did you say, "Again"?

256
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:07,104
I should have told you
a long time ago,

257
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:09,803
but Diane insisted
on keeping it quiet.

258
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:12,073
<i>- We got back together</i> <i>right

Hey, what is it?

263
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:49,374
- "D... " She's "D."

Di... Di... "D."
Diane is "D."

265
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:55,017
Yes. "D" is for Diane.
"E" is for Eddie.

266
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:57,853
Ray's "D."
She's the one!

267

is the one. I mean, she...

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

269
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:04,522
Just breathe. Breathe, Jane. Breathe.

270
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,067
Now, let me get this straight.
Ray and Diane are together?

271

<i>- Back</i> together. Together
again. - All right. I get it.

Okay. Shh...
It doesn't matter.

274

That chapter's over, remember?
It doesn't matter.

275
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:18,470
Now we got to go in there,
so pull it together.

Do you hear me?
Don't cry.

Don't cry, please. You're gonna be fine.

Jane, where are we
for next week?

281
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:37,187
Uh, we're-we're all set with

<i>actually. I mean... </i>

287
00:19:51,346 --> 00:19:53,576
<i>You know, they show</i>
<i>the whole love story first. </i>

288
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:57,379
<i>You see that this woman means... </i>
<i>everything to this-this man. </i>

289
00:19:57,452 --> 00:20:00,478
In fact, there's this-this...
this one scene...

290
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:04,218
where he actually sits
in just a... a dark... uhh...

291
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:08,490
It's very touching. He's sits
in a dark room, and he just...

292
00:20:08,563 --> 00:20:12,055
You just start to see
the-the tears and stuff.

293

<i>I mean, the man</i> <i>is completely, you
know,</i> <i>broken, and you feel it. </i>

You really feel it, and it's
devastating. It's a devastating...

295
00:20:20,942 --> 00:20:24,173
Is this a joke?

296
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:27,272
N- No.
What do you mean?

297
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:34,384

I mean, is this a joke?

298
00:20:34,455 --> 00:20:38,824
- No, I saw it two nights ago.
- What's so funny, Jane?

299
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:42,624
- Oh, can you believe this guy?
- I know, I...

300
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:45,598
So sensitive... So...

301
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:49,500
So devastated when it comes to
some chubby French guy, but, oh!

302
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,563
<i>Stomp on somebody's heart</i> <i>in real life,
and where's</i> <i>his sorry-ass pity then, huh?</i>

303
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:56,610
<i>Nowhere! Why?</i>
<i>Because he doesn't get it!</i>

304
00:20:56,677 --> 00:20:59,077
<i>He never gets it!</i>

305
00:20:59,147 --> 00:21:01,138
Someone please
explain it to me.

306
00:21:01,215 --> 00:21:05,743
Because I don't know
what you are talking about!

307
00:21:14,228 --> 00:21:17,026
- Evelyn, is she free?
- Yeah. She is.

308
00:21:17,098 --> 00:21:19,032
Thanks.

309
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:31,642
I'm sorry, Diane. I... I don't
know where that came from.

310
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:35,170
Well, I do. I know
exactly where it came from.

311
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:37,183
You do?

312
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:40,186
Some guy crushed you
under his boot heel,

313
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:42,688
and you lashed out
at poor Ray as being...

314
00:21:42,757 --> 00:21:44,850
representative of the prick
that did that to you.

315
00:21:44,926 --> 00:21:49,329
<i>- I'm right, aren't I?</i>
- More or less.

316
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:51,331
Well, you can't do it, Jane.

317
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:54,129
- I don't care how much it hurts.
- I know.

318
00:21:54,202 --> 00:21:56,227
No, you don't know.
Now, sit down and listen to me.

319
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:04,307
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

320
00:22:06,114 --> 00:22:10,141
About six months ago,
my boyfriend tried to leave me.

321
00:22:10,218 --> 00:22:13,710
<i>Well, he did. </i>
<i>He left. </i>

322
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:19,249
And I was devastated. I was
destroyed. Did you see it?

323
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:26,130
- No. I-I-I didn't. No.
<i>- Right. </i>

324
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,466
Do you know why?
Because if I fall apart,

325
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:32,631
everything around me
falls apart...

326
00:22:32,707 --> 00:22:38,168
<i>everything that I have worked</i>
<i>my entire life for. </i>

327
00:22:38,246 --> 00:22:40,544
- Do you love him?
- Wh-Who?

328
00:22:40,615 --> 00:22:45,177
- Him. The guy.
- I don't know.

329
00:22:45,253 --> 00:22:48,916
<i>Of course you do. </i> <i>Now, have
you talked</i> <i>to him lately?</i>

330
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,585
No. No. Not ex...
Not exactly talked.

331
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,721
Do it. Do it.
Talk to him.

332
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,860
I used to feel that if I
kept my heart to myself,

333
00:23:03,938 --> 00:23:08,534
<i>If I never let him know</i> <i>how much I needed
him,</i> <i>that he would never leave me. </i>

334
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:11,476
Well, guess what?
He did.

335
00:23:11,546 --> 00:23:16,108
And I lived in a private,
pathetic puddle...

336
00:23:16,184 --> 00:23:18,709
<i>until I couldn't</i>
<i>stand it anymore,</i>

337
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:21,846
<i>And so you know what I did?</i>
<i>I showed up at his doorstep... </i>

338
00:23:21,923 --> 00:23:25,723
with two corned beef sandwiches
on rye, lightly toasted,

339
00:23:25,793 --> 00:23:30,287
and I told him that
I was lost without him.

340
00:23:30,364 --> 00:23:32,525
You said that?

341
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,593
Pretty progressive, huh?
And I'm happy. Go figure.

342
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:38,662
I never thought
I'd be happy.

343
00:23:44,143 --> 00:23:46,270
<i>And you believe her?</i>

344
00:23:46,345 --> 00:23:49,405
<i>This is true love?</i>
<i>This is what we all should be looking for?</i>

345
00:23:49,482 --> 00:23:52,042
That is the most tragic thing
I've ever heard.

346
00:23:52,118 --> 00:23:56,714
We're talking about a woman whose boyfriend
was screwing you in order to get away from her.

347
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:58,950
And she's the authority
on romance?

348
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:01,857
The only reason she believes
that crap is because she has to.

349
00:24:01,927 --> 00:24:04,293
She's an old cow.

350
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:08,527
Truth is all we need to do
is adjust our radar a bit.

351
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:11,627
You know, learn to be attracted to
men we're simply not attracted to.

352
00:24:11,704 --> 00:24:14,696
Whoa. Hang on.
What are you talking about?

353
00:24:14,774 --> 00:24:17,800
Well, for example, normally...

354
00:24:17,877 --> 00:24:21,108
I might be attracted
to a guy like you.

355
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:25,048
But thanks to Dr. Charles, I've learned
to control my passion for testosterone,

356
00:24:25,117 --> 00:24:27,051
and now I can proudly say...

357
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,556
that I no longer find you
in the least bit desirable.

358
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:34,559
Oh, gee.
That's swell.

359
00:24:34,627 --> 00:24:36,857
I need a drink.

360
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:42,023
Does she have any
idea that she's completely insane?

361
00:24:42,101 --> 00:24:46,401
No. She's right. Diane is an old
cow. He cannot go back to her.

362
00:24:46,472 --> 00:24:48,963
Okay, that's it.

363
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:54,001
Jane, these are people,
not cows!

364
00:25:04,657 --> 00:25:06,591
Hello.

365
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:15,426
<i>I should have known</i>
<i>you would take his side. </i>

366
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:18,959
This isn't about sides, Jane.
It's about dealing with reality.

367
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:21,905
- And you need to get a grip.
- Oh, that's rich...

368
00:25:21,974 --> 00:25:25,375
coming from an emotional moron who's
whoring his way through Manhattan,

369
00:25:25,444 --> 00:25:28,072
using women
like A.T.M. Machines.

370
00:25:28,147 --> 00:25:31,446
<i>Oh, that's great. </i>
 <i>I get dumped, sleep around, and I'm a moron. </i>

371
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:33,917
You, you get dumped
and become the disciple...

372
00:25:33,986 --> 00:25:36,750
of some crone-slash-quack
behavioral scientist...

373
00:25:36,822 --> 00:25:39,882
who can't tell the difference between
quadrupeds and bipeds, and you're normal.

374
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:42,484
- She is not a crone. And she is not a quack!
- How do you know?

375
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:45,155
Who gives a shit?

376
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:48,962
You know, while you were out there buying
these theories about the horrors of men...

377
00:25:49,034 --> 00:25:51,400
And why guys like Ray won't ever come back,

378
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,768
deep down inside
you're hoping he would.

379
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,434
<i>Men are evil. Men are scum. </i> <i>But please,
Ray, won't you</i> <i>make a liar out of me?</i>

380
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,070
Well, you got
what you asked for, Jane.

381
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:03,137
He did go back. He just
did it with the wrong girl!

382
00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:08,052
It's over! Over.

383
00:26:09,288 --> 00:26:12,018
- Why can't you just let it go?
<i>- Because. </i>

384
00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:14,286
- Because why?
- Because I can't.

385
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,228
<i>- Why?</i>
- Because I was happy.

386
00:26:18,297 --> 00:26:21,232
Because if this...
theory is wrong,

387
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,326
men don't leave all women,
Eddie, they leave me.

388
00:26:31,977 --> 00:26:35,538
I know what
it does to you. I know.

389
00:26:35,614 --> 00:26:39,072
Maybe that's why
we hold on as hard as we do.

390
00:26:39,151 --> 00:26:43,884
We just can't believe that such a
miracle can ever happen to us twice.

391
00:26:43,956 --> 00:26:48,791
And...

392
00:26:48,861 --> 00:26:50,852
But it can.

393
00:26:52,865 --> 00:26:56,528
Someday you'll
find it again.

394
00:26:56,602 --> 00:27:00,402
- I promise you.
- Look at me.

395
00:27:00,472 --> 00:27:04,067
- A mess.
- I'm looking at you.

396
00:27:06,745 --> 00:27:09,680
And you're beautiful.

397
00:27:09,748 --> 00:27:13,912
Hey, you are beautiful.

398
00:27:15,821 --> 00:27:20,815
You're intelligent... and real.

399
00:27:25,464 --> 00:27:28,592
And Ray is not the last man
you're ever gonna love.

400
00:27:38,944 --> 00:27:42,243
I promise you he's not.

401
00:27:44,617 --> 00:27:47,586
Shh. Shh...

402
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:43,365
Oh, my God.

403
00:28:53,218 --> 00:28:57,518
Oh...

404
00:29:14,773 --> 00:29:17,264
Mmm...

405
00:29:24,616 --> 00:29:27,710
Hmm...

406
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:30,016
Hi.

407
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,224
Hi.

408
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:37,023
<i>Uh... listen. </i>

409
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:41,889
- L...
<i>- No, no, no. </i>

410
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:44,401
No. No.

411
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,337
No, you're not going
to analyze this one, Jane.

412
00:29:47,406 --> 00:29:51,809
- I'm not?
- No. No.

413
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:55,813
<i>You're so hell-bent on making</i> <i>sure things fit,
you miss out</i> <i>on all the fun when they don't. </i>

414
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,872
<i>- Eh? Oh... </i>
- Well, I...

415
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,319
No? Right now you're trying
to rationalize last night.

416
00:30:02,387 --> 00:30:05,049
Yeah? Worrying about
what might have happened.

417
00:30:05,124 --> 00:30:07,922
<i>Me, I'm just getting a kick</i>
<i>out of the fact that I, uh,</i>

418
00:30:07,993 --> 00:30:10,518
spent an entire night
with you in my arms,

419
00:30:10,596 --> 00:30:12,587
and I didn't even cop a feel.

420
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:20,661
Well...

421
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:24,106
maybe one.

422
00:30:27,746 --> 00:30:31,204
<i>- Whew!</i>
- What?

423
00:30:31,283 --> 00:30:34,616
Well, I'm relieved.

424
00:30:34,686 --> 00:30:38,315
I mean,
for a second there, I...

425
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:43,692
I thought maybe you
thought last night was, um...

426
00:30:43,762 --> 00:30:49,359
You know, or that you would...
think...

427
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:53,461
That would've really blown your
Dr. Charles out of the water, huh?

428
00:30:55,107 --> 00:30:59,203
Temporarily maybe, but you would
have shown your spots eventually.

429
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:03,806
- My spots.
<i>- Oh, come on, Eddie. </i>

430
00:31:03,882 --> 00:31:07,079
Men never fail to do
what's in their nature to do.

431
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,620
And what is that, Jane?

432
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:18,595
Disappoint you?
Abandon you?

433
00:31:18,664 --> 00:31:21,895
<i>Hmm?</i>

434
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:25,672
<i>What's really behind</i>
<i>these theories, huh?</i>

435
00:31:25,805 --> 00:31:28,535
What are you hiding?

436
00:31:28,608 --> 00:31:31,509
Nothing.

437
00:31:34,547 --> 00:31:36,742
Sorry. What you see
is what you get.

438
00:31:36,816 --> 00:31:40,252
Is it?

439
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:46,588
You know, this is not about my
nature, Jane. This is about yours.

440
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:05,272
- Hello.
- Janey?

441
00:32:05,344 --> 00:32:07,539
Listen, Stephen.
Can I call y'all back?

442
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:12,050
Your sister's in the hospital.
We lost the baby, kiddo.

443
00:32:19,425 --> 00:32:22,861
Hey, Janey.

444
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:38,534
Did you see Stephen?

445
00:32:38,611 --> 00:32:40,806
I saw him in the hallway...

446
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,871
- Getting water.
- Getting ice.

447
00:32:42,949 --> 00:32:46,578
Good luck.
God love him.

448
00:32:46,652 --> 00:32:50,144
They break so easily,
don't they?

449
00:32:58,264 --> 00:33:01,131
Last weekend,
he woke up in a panic.

450
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,398
He said that he had to go
shopping for the baby.

451
00:33:05,471 --> 00:33:09,134
You know how anal he is. I thought
he was gonna come back with...

452
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:13,008
thermometers and baby blankets
and safety gates.

453
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:18,176
When he walked in the door,
all he had was this little, tiny bag...

454
00:33:18,251 --> 00:33:23,018
and inside was this...

455
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:25,614
this perfect little
baseball mitt.

456
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:39,500
He got it in his head that
it was going to be a boy.

457
00:33:39,572 --> 00:33:42,336
Janey.

458
00:33:50,449 --> 00:33:53,043
<i>Okay, I've got ice. </i>

459
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,647
I've got blankets.
I've got magazines.

460
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:08,765
Look at my wife.

461
00:34:11,504 --> 00:34:15,304
Have you ever seen
anyone more beautiful?

462
00:34:15,374 --> 00:34:19,105
You're nuts.

463
00:34:50,576 --> 00:34:52,806
Diane, it's Jane.

464
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,646
I found Dr. Charles,

465
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:06,422
<i>Okay, is everybody ready</i>
<i>to have a good time?</i>

466
00:35:06,492 --> 00:35:08,858
<i>Now, come on. </i>
<i>You're going to have to do a lot better than that. </i>

467
00:35:11,097 --> 00:35:13,497
<i>Okay, let me explain how everything</i>
<i>on the show's gonna work. </i>

468
00:35:13,566 --> 00:35:16,797
<i>- It's a really informal show... </i>
- Yo, Ray! Do we have her on the line yet?

469
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:20,771
Two minutes. The magazine's
putting her through.

470
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,071
<i>- All right!</i>
- Two minutes.

471
00:35:24,143 --> 00:35:27,874
- Diane, two minutes.
<i>- So, Diane's going to come out. </i>

472
00:35:27,947 --> 00:35:30,507
<i>The first guest is going to come. </i>
<i>We have about a 15-minute segment. </i>

473
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:33,609
<i>Our first interview is gonna be</i>
<i>on the telephone, okay?</i>

474
00:35:33,686 --> 00:35:35,620
<i>- Dr. Marie Charles. </i>

475
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:51,533
I'm going to ask you one more time.
Are you 100% sure you want to do this?

476
00:35:51,604 --> 00:35:53,902
<i> I'm sure. I'm sorry</i>
<i>to put you in this position. </i>

477
00:35:53,973 --> 00:35:56,305
<i>Don't worry about me. </i>
<i>I just want to make sure you haven't lost your mind. </i>

478
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:59,401
<i>- Maybe I have. </i> -
Here she is, Ray.

479
00:35:59,478 --> 00:36:04,006
- Dr. Charles.

480
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,113
Welcome. Rarely have I
had the honor to host...

481
00:36:12,191 --> 00:36:14,659
such a distinguished
and extraordinary guest.

482
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:18,686
Today, Dr. Marie Charles
speaks out for the first time...

483
00:36:18,764 --> 00:36:21,130
<i>since the publication</i>
<i>of her searing article... </i>

484
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,532
Network says we've already
had 20,000 hits on the web site.

485
00:36:23,602 --> 00:36:27,060
- Holy cow.
<i>The reclusive Dr. Charles... </i>

486
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:31,269
<i>has agreed to an exclusive,</i>
<i>live telephone interview. </i>

487
00:36:31,344 --> 00:36:34,006
And I consider it
a rare gift...

488
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,744
from someone whose work has meant
a tremendous amount in my life,

489
00:36:38,818 --> 00:36:41,753
<i>- as I'm sure yours. </i>

490
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:45,154
<i>- Dr. Marie Charles</i>

491
00:36:45,224 --> 00:36:47,385
Hello, Dr. Charles.
Are you there?

492
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,487
Hello, Dr. Charles.
Can you hear me?

493
00:36:51,564 --> 00:36:53,395
- I'm getting nothing.

494
00:36:56,268 --> 00:36:58,236
- Where the hell is she? Where's the feed?
- Excuse me.

495
00:36:58,304 --> 00:37:00,772
We seem to be having
some technical difficulties.

496
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,331
If you'll just bear with us,
I'm sure we'll get it repaired.

497
00:37:06,012 --> 00:37:08,344
Tell them to patch it through
on the other line.

498
00:37:08,414 --> 00:37:10,678
- We can't. We only have one dedicated line.
- Shit!

499
00:37:15,187 --> 00:37:17,121
Okay, take us to commercial.

500
00:37:17,189 --> 00:37:19,453
Uh, she's here.
She wants to go on.

501
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:23,117
<i>Ho-Hold that. </i>
<i>Hold that. Hold that. </i>

502
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:25,925
- She's here.
- <i>Well, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

503
00:37:25,998 --> 00:37:28,558
it seems that the reason we've
been unable to get through...

504
00:37:28,634 --> 00:37:30,602
to Dr. Charles
telephonically...

505
00:37:30,669 --> 00:37:33,137
is because at this moment
she is right here in our studio,

506
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:36,038
having decided to do
the interview in person after all.

507
00:37:36,108 --> 00:37:38,633
- Holy shit.
- So let's not waste any more time.

508
00:37:38,711 --> 00:37:41,771
Join me in welcoming
Dr. Marie Charles!

509
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:49,050
- Makeup?
- Stop. Stop.

510
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:51,385
<i>Show yourself, Dr. Charles. </i>

511
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:57,060
Wake up!

512
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:05,327
Jane, what's going on?
Where's Dr. Charles?

513
00:38:08,574 --> 00:38:10,906
- There is no Dr. Charles.

514
00:38:10,976 --> 00:38:13,206
There never was.

515
00:38:15,548 --> 00:38:20,451
- I invented her, Diane.

516
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:24,455
- You...
- I invented her because...

517
00:38:24,523 --> 00:38:29,085
I had something to say,
and... somehow...

518
00:38:29,161 --> 00:38:35,862
<i>I thought if... </i> <i>if-if-if it were
coming</i> <i>from a 65-year-old Ph. D.,</i>

519
00:38:35,935 --> 00:38:38,130
that you would
see it the way I had...

520
00:38:38,204 --> 00:38:44,006
as a truth, as a legitimate,
scientific truth.

521
00:38:44,076 --> 00:38:48,536
But it isn't.
It's completely ridiculous.

522
00:38:48,614 --> 00:38:53,415
And...

523
00:38:53,486 --> 00:38:55,852
I lied to you all,
and I lied to myself.

524
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:58,120
Because
the real truth is that...

525
00:38:58,155 --> 00:39:00,319
Because
the real truth is that...

526
00:39:04,263 --> 00:39:07,323
I was heartbroken...
and lost.

527
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,200
You know, and I just wanted
to understand it somehow.

528
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:16,173
I wanted it to be...
about them.

529
00:39:16,242 --> 00:39:19,405
So everything I thought I had figured
out was completely upside-down.

530
00:39:19,478 --> 00:39:22,038
I thought this bull had gone on
to another new cow,

531
00:39:22,114 --> 00:39:24,742
<i>when, in fact, she was</i> <i>an old cow
who had</i> <i>become a new cow again. </i>

532
00:39:24,817 --> 00:39:27,581
<i>I mean, what was</i>
<i>I talking about?</i>

533
00:39:27,653 --> 00:39:31,555
I was comparing
men to animals,

534
00:39:31,624 --> 00:39:35,060
- which... okay, let's face it... sometimes they are. <i>
- </i>

535
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:40,687
But sometimes they are not.

536
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:44,600
Sometimes
you open the barn door,

537
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,604
or the hospital room door...

538
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:51,439
<i>or the bedroom door and... </i>

539
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,968
you find the real thing.

540
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:58,847
You find a guy who...

541
00:39:58,918 --> 00:40:01,978
can sit with you when you
are at your absolute worst,

542
00:40:02,054 --> 00:40:05,182
when you are knee-deep in Kleenex, and
your face looks like a punching bag,

543
00:40:05,257 --> 00:40:07,851
and you are a complete
and total mess.

544
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:11,260
And he...

545
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:14,458
can still look at you
and tell you...

546
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:19,470
that Ray is not the last man
you're ever going to love.

547
00:40:34,787 --> 00:40:39,019
- Eddie! Oh, my God.

548
00:40:44,563 --> 00:40:47,691
<i>Hey, are you all right?</i>

549
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:50,895
All right.
There you go. Late edition.

550
00:41:14,894 --> 00:41:17,226
Eddie!

551
00:41:17,296 --> 00:41:21,858
<i>- Oh, Eddie!</i>

552
00:41:33,412 --> 00:41:36,040
- Eddie! Eddie!

553
00:41:36,115 --> 00:41:40,609
Stop. Stop.

554
00:41:43,122 --> 00:41:45,056
Whew.

555
00:41:51,497 --> 00:41:53,863
So, what you see
is what you get, huh?

556
00:41:56,268 --> 00:41:59,965
Minus a few gray hairs
and a Ph. D., yeah.

557
00:42:03,275 --> 00:42:06,073
I'm really sorry, Eddie.

558
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,812
You should have told me.

559
00:42:10,883 --> 00:42:13,511
I should have told you
a lot of things.

560
00:42:14,587 --> 00:42:16,578
You were right.

561
00:42:18,524 --> 00:42:20,719
It was about my nature.

562
00:42:21,961 --> 00:42:25,590
Out of all the things
you said to me that night,

563
00:42:25,664 --> 00:42:28,997
what scared me
the most is...

564
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:32,231
that I would find it again.

565
00:42:32,304 --> 00:42:35,740
Because I have.

566
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,141
Would you please
say something?

567
00:42:48,454 --> 00:42:50,820
No.

568
00:43:11,343 --> 00:43:14,506
So you're saying?

569
00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:19,314
What do we got to lose?

570
00:43:19,385 --> 00:43:22,980
- Everything?
- Exactly.
