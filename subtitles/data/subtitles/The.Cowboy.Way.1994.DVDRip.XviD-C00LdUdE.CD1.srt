1
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:20,739
- Whoo! Yeah!

2
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,315
That brings us now to our final
team, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,977
Sonny Gilstrap and Pepper Lewis. Keep
your eyes right on the roping chutes.

4
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,284
These could be our 1993
champion team ropers.

5
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,324
Our boys are just about ready. Keep
your eyes right on the roping chute.

6
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,762
Sonny makes
a good head catch.

7
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,393
Now Pepper rides in, throws
it down, goes to the horn...

8
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,233
they turn and face,
and the time is in!

9
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,264
Checking our official timers.

10
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,174
How 'bout a 5.4!

11
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:29,875
Ladies and gentlemen, that might be good
enough to win the state championship!

12
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:35,683
The 1993 New Mexico
State Champion Team Ropers...

13
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,383
Sonny Gilstrap and Pepper Lewis.

14
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,392
Good goin', boys!

15
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,792
- Thank you!

16
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,450
Hey, Carlos.
How ya doin'?

17
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,820
- Mr. Stark.
- Hey, stuff looks nice.

18
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,825
Looks really nice.

19
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,055
Look, there's some money
missing from petty cash.

20
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,828
- You know anything about it?
- Uh, uh, no, sin'.

21
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:33,167
Right. All right.
I just thought I'd ask around.

22
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,906
It's good to see you,
Carlos.

23
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:47,112
You steal from me, and then you
lie to me about it in my face?

24
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,246
Did you take my money?

25
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,791
- Yes! Yes!
- Good! That's what I like to hear.

26
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,987
That's what I like
to hear. Now...

27
00:04:56,062 --> 00:05:00,396
you pay me back, and I won't
add the amount to your debt.

28
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,764
- All right?
- Mr. Stark.

29
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:06,327
El Señor Huerta's downstain's.
He's by the docks.

30
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,607
What the hell is he
doin' down here?

31
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,467
Manny. Havert seen you
down here in a while.

32
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,509
- John, I don't like this.
- What?

33
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,510
No, no. Look at
this old woman.

34
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,843
She won't live
long enough to work off her debt.

35
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,247
That's why I came
down here tonight.

36
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,308
I have been getting
complaints, John.

37
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,482
Manny, you know it's not an exact system.
We don't always get what we expect.

38
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,793
Qué pasa?
Buscas a alguien?

39
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,798
Dónde está mi papa?

40
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,300
- Quién?
- Mi papá.

41
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,202
Tú vaya con el grupo
primero, okay?

42
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,277
She says she wants
her father.

43
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,618
- What is she talking about?
- Manny, I don't know.

44
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,854
Am I supposed to be personally responsible
for everybody that comes off that boat?

45
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,129
Look, I'll call our people
on the other side...

46
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:42,031
and I'll
handle this, okay?

47
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:46,396
Make sure you do that.
All right?

48
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,445
Bueno.

49
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:57,882
Bienvenidos a los
Estados Unidos de América.

50
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,312
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
let's put our hands together...

51
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:05,289
and welcome Miss Espanola Valley,
Melba Van Buren!

52
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,997
We're gonna
move to the calf roping event next...

53
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,092
if we can get these two clowns
out of the arena.

54
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,229
I don't know what
they're doin' out there...

55
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,239
but if they're
not careful...

56
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,781
Well, lookee what
the cat drug in.

57
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,519
Hey, Melba. Lookin'
more gorgeous that ever.

58
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:44,996
Mm-mm-mm.

59
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,859
- All righty.
- Well, here's mine, boys.

60
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,870
- You all gonna wish me luck?
- Shit!

61
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,805
You fellas gonna be cryin'
all the way home tonight.

62
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:58,071
- What's the deal here, boys?
- Hundred bucks a man.

63
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,841
- One ride, winner takes all. Just the same as always.
- You in, Pepper?

64
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,815
Hobby horse have
a hickory dick? 'Course I'm in.

65
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:08,411
Bullshit, Pepper. I ain't ridin'
to win no I.O.U. From you.

66
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,286
Yeah, Pepper, you can
keep your damn old I.O.U.

67
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,690
That there's good as gold.
When you know me not to pay my debt?

68
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,456
Shit! When we know you
to pay 'em?

69
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,464
Hell, you still owe me
from last April.

70
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:23,127
April? Hell, he still owes me
ten bucks from high school.

71
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,660
You didn't get my check,
Eddie? I sent it U.P.S.

72
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,197
You never. You're a lyin'
little son of a bitch, Pepper.

73
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,810
- Who you callin' "little," asshole?
- You,

74
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,874
you little son of a bitch!

75
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:42,387
He throws his hands in the ain'.
Get away from him, cowboy!

76
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,889
The time is in
for Mike Ray.

77
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,983
The time is
nine seconds flat!

78
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,585
Let him ride.

79
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,030
Yeah, Sonny. What the hell.

80
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,000
Let him ride.

81
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,038
Sonny.

82
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,536
Sonny. Ho! Wait up!

83
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,945
Thanks, man. You just saved Eddie
about four teeth back there.

84
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,109
You win that prize money tonight,
you're payin' off all your debts.

85
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:16,177
You understand me? Otherwise, it's
gonna be me kickin' your ass tonight.

86
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,452
Oh, yeah? Why don't you just
try kickin' it right now, okay?

87
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,756
Be better than this Eskimo treatment
you been givin' me all year long.

88
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,228
You heard me, Pepper.

89
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,530
Luke Short, Jim Wilshin'e,
our next team out.

90
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,800
Luke rides up, makes
a nice, quick head catch.

91
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,241
Now Jim's gotta ride in.
Throws it down, go to the horn.

92
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,246
Turn and face, and the time...
- Chili Pepper.

93
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,782
Nacho.

94
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,874
Good to see you, man.

95
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,115
- Cómo estás?
- Where the hell have you been?

96
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,588
Oh, I been with
the worms in Mexico.

97
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,956
- Ay, Chihuahua!
- I miss your cookin'.

98
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,364
You talk to Sonny?

99
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,401
Come on, Pepper.
Sonny will forgive you.

100
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,402
Oh, yeah? When?

101
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,065
That rodeo was a year ago.
He ain't said six words to me since.

102
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,267
I told him I was sorry.
What's he want?

103
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,437
Sonny don't care about words.
You have to show him.

104
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,675
Yeah, well, I ain't gonna kiss his ass,
if that's what you mean.

105
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,650
So sour, probably tastes like
a damn old lemon anyhow.

106
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,655
Don't give up on him. You've
been friends too long for that.

107
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:27,750
Yeah, well, I had a reason for
not showin' up at that rodeo.

108
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:31,263
Tell him what it was.
He will understand.

109
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,822
Maybe someday, when he ain't bein'
such a damn shit-ass.

110
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,528
- Buena suerte.
- Thanks, viejo.

111
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:41,061
- Good luck on your ride.
- I don't need luck. I need sleep.

112
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,370
Senoritas.

113
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,172
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm single.

114
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,621
- Pepper's still trying to make up, huh?
- Yeah, well, I ain't listenin'.

115
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,123
He's your friend.

116
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:03,753
You two guys should be out there chasing
that steer together right now.

117
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:08,323
Friend don't pull a no-show at a national
rodeo final, Nacho. Not in my book.

118
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,733
I had plans for that money.
You know that.

119
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,996
Nothing in your book
about forgiving?

120
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,541
Nacho, Pepper and I
are through, okay?

121
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,511
You got a heart the size
of a tiny raisin, you know that?

122
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,570
Why don't you just
hand me my bronc rein?

123
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,344
If you only knew
what it was to be alone...

124
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,352
you would treasure
your friend.

125
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,354
Where you goin'?

126
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,357
- Home. I'm going home.
- You're not gonna stay and watch me ride?

127
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,191
No. You're a hardheaded donkey with
a heart the size of a tiny raisin,

128
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,231
and I don't want
to watch you ride.

129
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,756
You better have a pot of coffee
waitin' for me when I get home.

130
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,429
Next cowboy out this afternoon...

131
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:16,298
Sonny Gilstrap
from Belen, New Mexico.

132
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:19,235
High Dive is the name of the bucking
horse he's drawn this afternoon.

133
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,399
Easy, boy. I got him. I got him.

134
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:34,109
There we go. There we go.

135
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,245
There we go.

136
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,950
Seventy-five's the score
the cowboy's tryin' to beat...

137
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,585
to take the lead in
the bronc riding this afternoon.

138
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,285
An excellent ride for Sonny Gilstrap.

139
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,352
This could be
a high score.

140
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,761
Hard to beat
that one.

141
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,663
Maybe for you.

142
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,430
- Shit.
Seventy-seven points...

143
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:28,371
for that cowboy!

144
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:35,573
Let's move up to chute number five.
Keep your eyes right there.

145
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,776
Pepper Lewis, Belen, New Mexico,
is gonna be our next cowboy.

146
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,376
Lone Star is the name
of the bucking horse he's drawn.

147
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,887
- This cowboy's gotta do better than 77 points...
- Okay now.

148
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,153
If he wants to take the lead in
the bronc riding this afternoon.

149
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,353
Take it easy now.

150
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,139
He's just about ready.

151
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,970
Say when, buddy.

152
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,239
Lemme have the old hammerheaded
son of a bitch.

153
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,076
Damn! Well, there
goes our money.

154
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:46,015
- Hope to hell you're happy.
- God, I hate that little peckerwood!

155
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,019
You oughta not let him
in the jackpot, Sonny.

156
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:52,888
That old Pepper sure can cowboy,
can't he? When he wants to.

157
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,429
The judges signal:

158
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,124
Seventy-nine points
for the cowboy!

159
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,099
Seventy-nine!

160
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,806
Hello?

161
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,076
Yes, this is
Nacho Salazar.

162
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:51,740
What? Teresa? My daughter
Teresa is in New York City?

163
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,944
God's blessing on you,
Señor Stark.

164
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,953
I'll go get her right away.

165
00:15:56,021 --> 00:16:00,788
Good, good. And please make sure you
bring the other $5,000 with you.

166
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,953
Five thousand? But I
already paid, Señor Stark.

167
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,520
That's what I thought too,
but the people I work for...

168
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,362
said you agreed to pay
another 5,000 on delivery.

169
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,199
No, no, no. That was
not the agreement.

170
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,501
Well, look, I could
try talking to them...

171
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,507
but I don't think
it would do any good.

172
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,806
- Maybe we could go to the police.
- Wait a second, Mr. Salazar.

173
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:23,405
Think about what you're saying. Your
daughter is in this country illegally.

174
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,313
Yes, of course.
You're right.

175
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,444
All these people are interested
is in the money.

176
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,479
- And all you care about is your daughter.
- But what can I do?

177
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:36,016
Is there any way
you can get the money?

178
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,166
Yes, I think I can get it.

179
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:45,192
- Good, good.
- How can I get in touch with you?

180
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,173
My number's 212-555-4320.
You got that?

181
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,176
Yes, I have it.

182
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:56,044
Señor Stark, my daughter,
is she okay?

183
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,516
She's fine. Just think,
in a couple of days...

184
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,610
you two will be
together again.

185
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,621
Good night,
Mr. Salazar.

186
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:41,821
"Dear Sonny. Praise God, my daughter
Teresa is out of Cuba.

187
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,330
I've gone to New York City
to pick her up.

188
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:49,458
I will telephone you as soon
as possible about your guns.

189
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,527
Forgive me. I did not
know what else to do. "

190
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,439
"P.S. Here's
your damn coffee. "

191
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,185
Where are you, Big Chief?

192
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,924
Now, where are you?

193
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:21,231
I don't wanna play if you
ain't gonna play fain'. Oh!

194
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,498
Big Chief on
trail of naked paleface woman.

195
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,938
Oh. Oh, no.

196
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:33,842
What are you gonna do when you find
naked paleface woman, Big Chief?

197
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:38,849
Big Chief gonna teach naked
paleface woman to play his tom-tom.

198
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:42,944
- Is much fun for Big Chief.
- Oh, no. Not that.

199
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,149
Oh!

200
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,854
Oh. Big Chief.

201
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,431
Now time for
naked paleface woman...

202
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,263
to make Big Chief
happy chief.

203
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:01,935
Oh. Why, you wicked
old heathen!

204
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,535
Pepper?

205
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,638
Pepper?

206
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,148
Sonny?
Hey, how ya doin'?

207
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:25,560
Got any of that prize money
left over from the other night?

208
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,464
- Sure. Why?
- Need to borrow it.

209
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:32,197
- How come?
- None of your business. You gonna loan it to me?

210
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,170
- Yeah. How much you need?
- How much you got?

211
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,505
Just one minute.
I'll check.

212
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,214
- Hey, Sonny.
- Melba.

213
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,314
Big Chief
catch you yet?

214
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,724
He just about
had me when you drove up.

215
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,853
You wanna play?

216
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,398
No, thanks.

217
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,697
You used to like
to play, remember?

218
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,261
- Yeah, well, you're
a married woman now, Melba.

219
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,500
That don't bother
Pepper none.

220
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,874
Yeah, well,
not much does, does it?

221
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:20,345
Oh, hey. Keep the wigwam
warm for me, baby.

222
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,478
Mmm.

223
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,887
I will return.

224
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,432
Where the hell you
think you're goin'?

225
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,229
You tell me.

226
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,702
You sure as hell ain't
goin' nowhere with me.

227
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,762
- Where you goin'?
- New York City.

228
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,298
New York City? What the hell's
in New York City?

229
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,004
- Nacho.
- Nacho?

230
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,048
He was supposed to pick up his daughter
and call me. That was five days ago.

231
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,050
- You reckon he run into trouble?
- I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

232
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,053
- Let's get goin'.
- I said, you ain't goin' nowhere with me.

233
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,889
- You might need my help.
- I counted on your help once before, remember?

234
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,053
You gonna loan me
that money or not?

235
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,063
You want my money,
not me, is that it?

236
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:10,329
- That's it.
- Well, my money goes where I go, you know that?

237
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,496
- You go where your money goes, is that a fact?
- Yessin'ee, that's a fact.

238
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:16,405
- I'm a businessman.
- Well, Mr. Businessman, guess what?

239
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,411
You and your money can both
get the hell outta my truck...

240
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,413
'cause I don't want
either one of you now.

241
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,042
Okay.

242
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,382
I'd rather play
Big Chief anyhow!

243
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,183
Good.
Don't slam the door.

244
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:38,291
And another thing... I wouldn't throw a
bucket of water on your ass if it was drownin'!

245
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,957
Good. I wouldn't
want you to neither!

246
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,938
Pepper! Get out!

247
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:50,031
Nacho's my friend!
I'm goin' to help him, not you!

248
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,099
Get out.

249
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,481
Aaah!

250
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,617
Okay. You wanna go? You can go, but
you're ridin' back here, you understand me?

251
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:10,992
- I swear to God, you are not getting up front with me.
- Not polite to swear to God.

252
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,759
Oh, God! Hey!

253
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:19,031
- Sonny... Shit!

254
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,982
- Hey.

255
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,756
- Hey!

256
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,763
I told you, Pepper,
you ain't ridin' up front with me.

257
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,565
I don't wanna get up front. I'm just
curious what the hell's goin' on.

258
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,902
All I know is Nacho's been payin' this
guy for the last couple years...

259
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,999
to get his daughter
outta Cuba.

260
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:01,045
When I got home, there was a note sayin'
she was in New York City...

261
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,013
and he'd gone
to get her.

262
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,606
Nacho must've been hot to get there
if he left before you got home.

263
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,482
Wouldrt you be if someone snuck
your daughter outta Cuba?

264
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,215
I wouldn't let
my daughter go to Cuba.

265
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,519
She didn't go to Cuba.
She was born there.

266
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,617
She never been
nowhere else.

267
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,662
Always somethin'.

268
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,663
You gotta give 'em
one thing, though.

269
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,790
Them Cubans make
a damn fine cigar.

270
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,803
- Okay, goddamn it, you can ride up front with me...

271
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,845
but I don't want you yappin'
my ear off, you understand me?

272
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,948
Peculiar how things
work out, ain't it?

273
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,507
I mean, one minute,
I'm playin' Big Chief.

274
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:17,021
Next minute, I'm on my way
to New York City.

275
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:22,025
One day, never been east of Tulsa.
Next day, boom! I'm east of Tulsa.

276
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,822
Peculiar.

277
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,193
Yeah. Woo, woo, woo, woo.

278
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,165
You believe in hypnotism?

279
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,361
I can hypnotize you
while you're drivin'...

280
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,927
only it's probably not good
to do while you're drivin'.

281
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:42,736
This old boy... has got this
dead-drunk horse passed out in his bed.

282
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,045
So old Tug, who's pretty well
shit-faced himself...

283
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:48,312
takes one look at
this horse and says...

284
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,445
I don't care
what old Tug says.

285
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:55,050
I don't care what you say. You been
sayin' it for the last 24 hours straight.

286
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,856
- You don't wanna hear the rest of the story?
- No, I don't!

287
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,193
I don't wanna hear you
talk no more!

288
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,733
- You don't wanna hear me talk no more?
- That's right.

289
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:07,864
- Okay. That's the way you want it, fine. No more talkin'.
- Good.

290
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:25,912
Pepper, how far did that sign
say it was to the interstate?

291
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,176
So where you wanna eat?

292
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,923
Okay, Pepper,
finish your damn story.

293
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,687
So Tug takes one look
at this horse and says...

294
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:06,788
"Well, she ain't pretty, but I wouldn't
kick her outta bed for eatin' oats. "

295
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,471
Oh, Lordy.

296
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,377
Good to be talkin' again.

297
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,646
- Sonny?
- Yeah.

298
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,121
Big, ain't it?

299
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,123
Yeah.

300
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,650
Whoo! Yeah!

301
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,811
Boy, I like this city.

302
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,152
You ever heard such
a racket in your life?

303
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,454
- Huh?
- You ever heard such a...

304
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,756
Forget it.

305
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:14,356
Hey, how we supposed to track down
Nacho in all this madness?

306
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:17,265
He left a New York number
on the desktop.

307
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:20,361
Called it up. Turns out it's
this place called "La Habanita. "

308
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,702
- Little Havana.
- That's right.

309
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:26,972
So I called 'em up and asked if a Cuban
named Nacho Salazar had been there.

310
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,036
- You know what that bastard did to me?
- What?

311
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,706
He hung up.

312
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:34,809
I wish I knew his name.
I'd whup his rude ass for ya.

313
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,988
Hey! You know where
Club La Habanita is?

314
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:53,795
- What'd he say?
- Wa-hee, wa-hee, wa-canna?

315
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:57,364
- Italian, huh?
- I believe so.

316
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,911
This one's gone.

317
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,846
- The L's are gone from this one.
- Must be a phone book thief on the loose.

318
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:06,008
I'll try information.

319
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,119
Oh, here.
This works.

320
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,631
Howdy. Hey.

321
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,336
Operator said it was
on Perez Street. Right there.

322
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,970
- One last little piece.
- Goddamn it, Pepper!

323
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,037
You're rippin' out
all my ear hain's.

324
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:41,108
That'll teach ya not to look at
a phone 'fore you stick it to your ear.

325
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,751
There it is.

326
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,762
Operator said Perez.
Looks more like Juarez.

327
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,773
You two goin' in there?

328
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,374
- Sure. Why not?
- Yes, indeed, sin'.

329
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,715
Why not? Why not?

330
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,846
Why not?

331
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,414
Fella there's about three bricks
shy of a load if you ask me.

332
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,272
Hey, hey.
Dance, senorita?

333
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,214
Come on, Pepper.

334
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,215
Hey. Come on. She likes me.

335
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:51,180
There's a huge warehouse
in Newark. It's in probate.

336
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,315
You could put
300 workers in there.

337
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,121
Hell, it's big enough
to let 'em live there.

338
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,822
- How much?
- Quarter of a million.

339
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,457
You gotta be kiddin' me.
I know a guy downtown...

340
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,798
who can get us that same kind of space
for half that price.

341
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,374
- Howdy.
- Hola.

342
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,740
Can I have a whiskey
and a beer, please?

343
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,838
Yeah, a beer and a mescal.
Hold the lime, hold the lemon.

344
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,681
It's a mighty nice
place you got here.

345
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:24,381
Hell of a nice place.
Friend told us about it.

346
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:28,687
He was here the other night. Maybe you
remember him. A guy named Nacho Salazar.

347
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,891
Chubby fella about yea tall. Come here
from New Mexico to fetch his daughter.

348
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,896
Guess not.

349
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,406
Sonny, I'd like
to make a toast.

350
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,272
We, uh, spent a little time apart
over the past year...

351
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,972
but it's nice to just
be back... Okay.

352
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,513
Mm. Ohh!

353
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,262
Howdy.

354
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,096
Hey, man, por qué tú no
yippee-hi-yay pa' fuera, huh?

355
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,226
Sonny, I don't think
this fella likes us.

356
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:16,239
Yeah, well, don't go causing no trouble.
Probably just don't speak English. Howdy.

357
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,332
Speak English?

358
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,242
Sabe English?

359
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:24,008
Well, that's too bad,
'cause I was gonna tell you...

360
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:27,609
your face looks like a hatful of
assholes.

361
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,960
Sonny, did you see what
this pukehead just did?

362
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,894
Yeah, well, maybe if you werert bein'
so rude. Try a little politeness.

363
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:42,194
- "Politeness"?
- Politeness. We're in the city now.

364
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,861
Okay. Politeness.

365
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,634
Uh, sin', I apologize
for my rude behavior.

366
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,574
I don't know what came
over me. Bartender?

367
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:56,080
Could I get a beer
for my new friend here?

368
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:00,007
See, a little common courtesy goes
a long way, Pepper.

369
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,212
Amazin', ain't it?
Oh, here's your beer.

370
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:07,658
Goddamn it, Pepper!

371
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,399
Howdy.

372
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,150
Sonny!

373
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,459
Y tus sombreros
de mierdas!

374
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,103
Thanks for breakin'
my fall.

375
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,105
Here's your hat.

376
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,936
- Why not? Why not?
- Here's your hat.

377
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:01,445
Well, now you know why not.
Eh, gringos?

378
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,571
Let's get out of here.

379
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:11,052
- Te llamo mañana.
- Pronto, huh?

380
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,056
Okay.

381
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:20,195
- What was all that about?
- I don't know. I'll find out, though.

382
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,198
You better take off.
We could get some cops.

383
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,667
John, uh... You were
out of line earlier.

384
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,229
I'm sorry, Manny.
I just...

385
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,673
I just don't want this guy
tryin' to rip you off.

386
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,803
This guy is a friend
of mine for 30 years.

387
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:39,578
Who was it always told me about
mixing business and friendship?

388
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,811
Always watching
my back, eh, John?

389
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:47,858
Yeah, Manny, I am.

390
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,893
Always.

391
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,406
- Who were they?
- Two cowboys from New Mexico.

392
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,668
They're looking for
that old Cuban.

393
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,711
How much do they know?

394
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,974
They know he was here
looking for his daughter.

395
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,982
I don't think they
know nothing else.

396
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,143
We made sure
they won't be back.

397
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,016
Oh, you did, huh?
I hope you're right.

398
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,217
Ow. Boy. Hell of a town.

399
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:26,457
- Ain't been here five minutes, already got our asses whupped.
- Thanks to you.

400
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,398
Here. Take a bite
of this pepper.

401
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,900
Go ahead.

402
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,869
Cures what ails ya.

403
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,270
At least we know someone
in there knows somethin'.

404
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,535
- You figure?
- Hell, yeah.

405
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:43,308
Second I mentioned Nacho's name, we got them
two damn gorillas standin' right next to us.

406
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:51,887
- So what now?
- We find us a motel and sleep on it, I reckon.

407
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,988
Oh, hey. Hook a left.
That looks like a motel right there.

408
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,743
A bit uptown for us,
ain't it, Pepper?

409
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:19,749
Don't worry about a thing.
You're my guest.

410
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:33,360
- Howdy do?
- Hidy what?

411
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,626
Hidy... He... Hello.

412
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,597
Uh, welcome to the Waldorf.
May I help you?

413
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:45,768
Yeah. Uh, me and my partner could use
a couple beds. We just blew into town.

414
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:49,472
- We ain't from around here.
- Really?

415
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,879
Um, just fill this out.

416
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:56,045
Right away. Fill that out, will ya,
Sonny? I'll take care of the finances.

417
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,054
Okay.

418
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,856
You're a real cowboy,
aren't you?

419
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,292
Been accused of it
a time or two, ma'am.

420
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:10,198
Well, hell, yeah,
we're real cowboys.

421
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,202
What the hell?

422
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,864
Damn!

423
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,205
Well,
there you go.

424
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,711
Little piece of New Mexico
right there.

425
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:24,714
Hey, uh, you know,
we were thinkin' maybe later...

426
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,683
to go to a museum,
maybe take in an opera or two.

427
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,913
How's that sound to you?

428
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:32,478
Will this be cash
or credit card, sin'?

429
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,491
Personal check, if you
don't mind, little darlin'.

430
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,695
I can't believe
she didn't take my damn check.

431
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,827
You ain't got no account. I don't know
why you didn't just pay cash.

432
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:49,270
Cash? After she insulted me
like that? Hell, no.

433
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,308
At least we can get
a bite while we're here.

434
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,309
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

435
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:59,407
And how would you gentlemen
like those steaks prepared?

436
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,508
"Prepared"?
Oh, you mean cooked.

437
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:05,522
Yes, sin'. "Cooked" is most definitely what
I should have said. Do excuse me, please.

438
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,888
How would you like
those steaks cooked?

439
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:12,453
Well, just knock its horns off, wipe its
nasty old ass, and chunk it down on the plate.

440
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,760
Same for me, please.

441
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,697
I will give chef
your instructions exactly.

442
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:19,827
And would you care
to order wine with your meal?

443
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,101
Uh, yeah. Why don't you bring us
a bottle of somethin'-or-other?

444
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,233
Uh, not too sweet.
American.

445
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:29,109
American something-or-other.
Yes, sin'. An excellent choice.

446
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,981
And would you like to have glasses, or do
you prefer to drink din'ectly from the bottle?

447
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,816
Well, uh, glasses, I reckon.

448
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:41,255
Oh, and hey, toss a little ice
in mine if you would, my good man.

449
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:44,590
Ice. Certainly, sin'.
Nothing could surprise me now.

450
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:49,565
Hey, tell that cook he better not screw up
them steaks. We're particular about our meat.

451
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,304
Thank you, Pepper.

452
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:11,546
I hope you enjoy this bottle as much
as you did the previous two.

453
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,641
Mmm. Hmm.

454
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,441
I been thinkin'. We got
but one choice tomorrow.

455
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:40,473
I think we oughta boot on over
to the police station.

456
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,519
Let them
handle it.

457
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,713
I must say...

458
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,123
they've done a fine job
with this steak.

459
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:54,492
I don't understand why they
gift-wrap these little lemons...

460
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,829
but the steak
is mighty tasty.

461
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:02,361
For all we know, Nacho
could've gotten drunk...

462
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,068
and thrown in jail.

463
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:09,203
It don't really matter.
Fin'st thing in the morning...

464
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,374
we'll make our way over to the police
station, let them handle this.

465
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,475
That's what they
get paid for.

466
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:20,347
This little secret. We don't
have to tell her right now.

467
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,929
What do you think?

468
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,904
- Jesus Christ, Pepper!
- Ow!

469
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,705
We're in New York City.
That shit don't fly around here.

470
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:43,372
Whoa!
Would you please...

471
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,913
Just to come
for a fitting.

472
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,387
Will there be
anything else?

473
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,856
Yeah, you got any,
uh, popsicles?

474
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,859
Popsicles.
No, sin'.

475
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,657
Well, I guess
that'll be all, then.

476
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,698
Thank you.

477
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:04,530
Thank you.

478
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,536
That was wonderful.

479
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,732
- Well, shall we?
- Of course.

480
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,714
- Gentlemen.
- Margarette.

481
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,664
Sonny, take a gander at this.
Tell me what it says.

482
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:41,899
"Tuesday, 9 p. m. 50 Central
Park South. Top floor. "

483
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,433
"I must see you again.
Margarette. "

484
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,742
Whew. Well, kiss
a duck's red ass.

485
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,113
I do believe she loves me.

486
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,010
I'll be right back.

487
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,858
That amazes me.

488
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,894
That truly amazes me.

489
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,662
I'm beginnin' to like
this town, you know.

490
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,475
- Well, it's time to go.
- Hmm?

491
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,875
- Stop touching me, Pepper!
- Hey, get down.

492
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:33,782
- Them people think we skipped the check.
- They think right.

493
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,883
- Well, bullshit. Pay 'em.
- With what?

494
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,121
You lyin' son of a bitch.

495
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,527
You told me you still had some of
that prize money left.

496
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,431
- I do. I wouldn't lie to you.
- Well, how much you got?

497
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,265
About eight bucks,
I reckon.

498
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:50,364
- "Eight bucks, I reckon. "
- Better than a poke in the eye, ain't it?

499
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,342
Pepper, I've had it with you.

500
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:13,259
Ah! Ooh!

501
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:19,228
Ah. Don't worry.
Things will get better.

502
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,239
Only when my father comes.

503
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:26,936
You have to face the fact
that maybe your father isn't coming.

504
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,571
He is coming.

505
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,740
Back to work!

506
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,175
I said, back to work.

507
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,584
Where is my father?

508
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:39,589
- Let go of me!
- Juan!

509
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,591
Déjala quieta.

510
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:50,194
- Are you okay?
- No.

511
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,735
There's a sink
in the other room.

512
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:56,398
Let's go in there and
wash that off, all right?

513
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:59,101
We'll take care of this.
Come on.

514
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,110
Go ahead.

515
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:11,010
My father was going to
take me to New Mexico...

516
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,079
to work with him
on the ranch.

517
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,687
Where is my father?

518
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,559
- Please tell me.
- I don't know.

519
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,361
I mean, that's the truth.
The last time...

520
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,369
The last time I talked to him, he was
still trying to raise the money...

521
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,803
to pay me for
getting you outta Cuba.

522
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,806
He already paid you.

523
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,638
Yeah, he paid me. He paid me some.

524
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,702
I mean, he didn't
pay me everything.

525
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,770
Please, sit down.

526
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,310
Your father's comin', Teresa.
I mean, I don't know what's keepin' him.

527
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:48,622
Until he comes, let me
take you outta here.

528
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:52,025
These people can be very cruel,
as you just saw.

529
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:55,862
They take advantage of a pretty girl
any chance they get.

530
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,527
I promised your father
I'd take care of you.

531
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,178
What are you gentlemen
doing here?

532
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,486
Just catchin'
a few winks, officer.

533
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:23,526
For your information,
there's a law...

534
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:26,028
against camping
in Central Park, and a fine.

535
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,394
I.D.'s, please.

536
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,400
Are you fellas cowboys?

537
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,234
No, we, uh,
criminals, mostly.

538
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:39,400
You know,
sleep out in parks.

539
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:42,070
- Bloodthin'sty shit like that.
- Pepper.

540
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,910
Excuse him, officer.
He wasrt raised with any manners.

541
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:47,746
- Where you guys from, Texas?
- Texas!

542
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:51,083
There ain't no real cowboys from Texas.
We're from New Mexico.

543
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,817
So what brings you guys
to New York?

544
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,492
- Lookin' for a friend.
- A friend?

545
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:00,655
He came here about a week ago.
Havert heard from him since.

546
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:03,393
Thought we'd come check it out
ourselves, you know?

547
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:08,229
Hey!

548
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:12,241
Yeah, hey. You better watch it.
She's liable to come up lame on you.

549
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:16,006
Oh.

550
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,105
Hey, uh, thanks.

551
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:21,913
Listen, uh, you guys been to
Missing Persons?

552
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,577
No, sin'.

553
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,350
Come on. I'll, uh,
I'll walk you over.

554
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:30,092
- Thank you very much.
- Maybe they know something.

555
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,220
Ho.

556
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:35,788
Almost forgot.

557
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,629
Next time you'll be
a little more polite.

558
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:48,739
I always wanted to be a cowboy myself.
Ridin' the range.

559
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:51,440
Always wanted to ride
the Chisholm Trail from end to end.

560
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:55,246
Of course, the only cow I've ever seen
is over in the Central Park Zoo.

561
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,777
- Sign in, then I'll take you down to Missing Persons.
- Thank you very much.

562
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,752
Hey.

563
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:07,295
You, uh, you ever heard
of Bill Pickett?

564
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:09,924
- What's that?
- Bill Pickett. He was a cowboy in the Old West.

565
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,595
He pretty much invented bulldogging.
Black man. Like me.

566
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,230
Who told you that?

567
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,240
- It's true.
- Hey.

568
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:20,242
Sonny, you hear that?

569
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,710
He thinks some old black cowboy
invented bulldogging.

570
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,714
That'd be
Bill Pickett, Pepper.

571
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,716
- Ready?
- Yeah.

572
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,443
Oh, you mean
William Pickett.

573
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:32,819
Yeah. Oh.

574
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:35,650
- Age?
- Fifty-five or so.

575
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,489
Social Security number?

576
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:40,359
I don't even know
if he has one, ma'am.

577
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,465
Any tattoos or
distinguishing marks?

578
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,366
He's got a small scar
over his left eye.

579
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:51,999
Yeah, I remember that. One night
he got toilet-huggin' drunk...

580
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:54,475
- Shut up, Pepper.
- Okay.

581
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,911
- That's our friend.
- Goddamn!

582
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:31,141
- I'm sorry.
- How did it happen?

583
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:35,515
They found him
in the East River four days ago.

584
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,555
One shot in the head.
His thumbs were tied behind his back.

585
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:40,214
Oh, Jesus.

586
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:43,316
We found this
in his shin't pocket.

587
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:46,328
It's a claim ticket
from a pawn shop.

588
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:50,166
Listen, uh, let's go
talk to the Chief.

589
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,725
There's nothing more
you can do for him here.

590
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,311
Adiós, my old friend.

591
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:29,438
They place illegals into domestic work,
prostitution, sweatshops.

592
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:32,703
There may be 3,000 sweatshops
running in this city alone.

593
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:35,370
- Goddamn, that's slavery.
- Yeah.

594
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:38,414
A lot of big cities run on it, whether
anybody wants to admit it or not.

595
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,474
What are you all gonna do about our
friend's daughter, Teresa Salazar?

596
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:44,543
Look, Mr. Gilstrap, we'll do all
we can to find your friend's daughter.

597
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:48,717
There's a procedure. Sam will have to file
reports with the I.N.S., the Department of Labor.

598
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:52,387
It's gonna take time.
You have to be patient.

599
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,726
Damn, who's the law
around here, Sam?

600
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:02,330
Look, I'm, uh, sorry
I couldn't do more.

601
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:04,340
I guess I'm
no Bill Pickett.

602
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:07,605
Yeah, well, not much use
for cowboys these days anyhow.

603
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,908
Look, I'll, uh,
do what I can here.

604
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,448
I'll call you in New Mexico
and keep you posted.

605
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,507
Thanks.

606
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,801
How we supposed to know what
we're lookin' for when we see it?

607
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,302
Lookee there.

608
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:38,807
It's them
two bastards from last night.

609
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,845
I don't remember seein'
that other guy.

610
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:45,882
Neither do I, but he sure
as hell looks like the boss to me.

611
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:49,851
I think we oughta see
what we can find out about that guy.

612
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,354
Okay, I got it.

613
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,721
You go in there and talk to him.
I'll cover the truck.

614
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,321
That's real cowboy
of you, Pepper.

615
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:03,389
I got a better idea.

616
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:18,579
Lemme go! Lemme go, lemme go,
lemme go, lemme go! You bully!

617
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:20,878
Stink factory!

618
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:23,852
Hey! You settle down,
you ornery little cuss.

619
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,218
Listen here. We wanna
ask you some questions.

620
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:29,884
- What kinda questions?
- I wanna know about that guy drivin' that fancy car.

621
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,822
I don't know nobody
in no fancy car.

622
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:36,889
Let's tie some rocks to the peckerwood
and kick him in the river.

623
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:40,596
- Okay.
- You wouldn't do that to a veteran.

624
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,104
Hell, I'd do it just to see
what it looked like.

625
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:49,611
So let me get this
straight. These guys smuggle people.

626
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,944
Why? You got somebody you want
smuggled outta someplace?

627
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,950
Answer
the question.

628
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:59,011
Yeah, Huerta and Stark,
they smuggle people... for a price.

629
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:03,082
- Who's the boss?
- Huerta's the boss, but Stark does all the legwork.

630
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,187
We got a friend that had somebody
smuggle his daughter outta Cuba.

631
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:09,789
We were wonderin' maybe you could
tell us where she is.

632
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:12,198
Now, why would I do that?

633
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:16,365
Hey, we're the ones askin'
the questions here, bub.

634
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,375
- Why don't we throw him on the spit with the pigeon?
- Okay.

635
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:24,380
Wait, wait, wait! You just wanna know
where your friend's daughter is, right?

636
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,076
That's right.
And we'll pay you.

637
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,642
- Write you a check.
- Don't take checks.

638
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,753
Twenty bucks.

639
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:41,288
You get the other half
when you deliver.

640
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,999
Howdy, ma'am.
Hey. How ya doin'?

641
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:51,006
People so unfriendly here.

642
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:54,100
It's like talkin' to a bunch of rocks.
Get away from me!

643
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:56,668
- Pepper, behave yourself.
- He ain't gonna show.

644
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:58,839
- I only gave him half
a twenty. He'll show.

645
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:01,349
- Hey! I'm gonna hit him.
- Pepper.

646
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:03,318
Hey, look.

647
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,877
Well, this towrs
full of surprises.

648
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,618
- Did you have any luck?
- Gimme a smoke.

649
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:11,593
- There's your brand right there, pal.
- Easy, Pepper.

650
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:16,193
- You owe me half a twenty, cowboy.
- Yeah, well, earn it.

651
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:19,963
Your friend's daughter? Stark is
keepin' her in a house over by the river.

652
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,596
Aha. I'm gonna
give you the address.

653
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:25,607
I got a better idea.
Why don't you show us?

654
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,298
Okay.

655
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,364
Don't waste a lot of money on rent,
I'll say that for him.

656
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:58,498
- Which one is it?
- On the end there. 4-B.

657
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:01,942
- Okay, come on. - Oh, no,
no, no. Uh, not me. Mm-mmm.
