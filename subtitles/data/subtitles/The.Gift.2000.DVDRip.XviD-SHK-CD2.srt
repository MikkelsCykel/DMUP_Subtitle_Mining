1
00:00:03,707 --> 00:00:08,420
False alarm. It's just a old bicycle.

2
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:15,720
None of y'all brought a thermos
of coffee out here?

3
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,952
That day at school -

4
00:00:40,202 --> 00:00:42,997
you looked kinda strange
at me and Jessica.

5
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:47,001
Did you think something bad then?

6
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,098
Shit! Come on.

7
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:02,809
- Donnie, he called, I told him...
- Pearl!

8
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,895
Shut your mouth!

9
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:09,148
- What are you doin' on my property?
- I'm on Sheriff's business.

10
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:13,361
- Got permission from your wife.
- Think that ninny talks for me?

11
00:01:13,612 --> 00:01:18,074
How did your arm get all scratched up?

12
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:23,038
Stray cat. She didn't like it
when I killed her.

13
00:01:23,288 --> 00:01:26,542
- What brought you here?
- Routine investigation.

14
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:31,254
We're checking
all the ponds in the county.

15
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,639
- I knew it was you!
- No! You...

16
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:47,061
Hey! I'm on county business, Donnie!
Don't fool with me.

17
00:01:47,312 --> 00:01:49,898
- Hey, Pearl!
- What?

18
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:54,528
- You need to take a look at this.
- Watch him.

19
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:06,207
It's her!

20
00:02:06,457 --> 00:02:09,918
Donnie?

21
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,632
Get those hooks outta my baby!
Get her off them hooks!

22
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:16,591
- No!
- Cuff him!

23
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:21,597
- No, no!
- Mr King!

24
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:27,519
Get an ambulance!
I think he's having a heart attack!

25
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:30,147
- I didn't do this!
- Get him outta here!

26
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:33,693
This ain't right, Pearl! Bitch!

27
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:38,822
Bitch! Bitch! Pearl!

28
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:54,798
Come in.

29
00:02:56,256 --> 00:03:00,761
- Somebody might come in here!
- Guess you'd better fuck me fast!

30
00:03:01,012 --> 00:03:05,350
You want some coffee? Mrs Wilson?

31
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:08,436
Do you want some coffee?

32
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:10,688
No, thank you.

33
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:14,568
Have a seat.

34
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:20,531
Why have you called me here?

35
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:24,202
Tomorrow Donnie Barksdale
goes on trial for murder.

36
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:26,662
I feel that we have a powerful case.

37
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:31,543
Today the coroner verified Donnie's
tissue under the victim's nails.

38
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:35,505
I only have one weak link
I gotta worry about.

39
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:38,758
- What?
- You.

40
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:43,096
You see, you're how we found out
where the victim's body was,

41
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:46,432
and how you found out, well...

42
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:49,769
...that might open up
a real can of worms for us.

43
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,357
Psychic phenomenon,
ESP, dreams, visions.

44
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:57,527
The defence could go to town on you
and, if that's not bad enough,

45
00:03:57,777 --> 00:04:01,990
I understand there was bad blood
between you and Donnie Barksdale?

46
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:05,035
Yeah, he threatened my kids!

47
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:09,498
That's what I heard. I also heard
you threatened him right back.

48
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:13,377
Told his wife to leave him.

49
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,421
Donnie's quite a ladies' man.

50
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:20,300
Were you involved with him?

51
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,305
- What?
- I can deal with any revelation now.

52
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:29,226
But at the trial,
there can't be any surprises.

53
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:31,228
Is there anything I need to know

54
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:35,233
about you or Donnie
or Donnie's wife or the victim?

55
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,360
No.

56
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,655
Will that be all?

57
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:45,535
Yes, ma'am.

58
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:49,788
You know, Mr Duncan...

59
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,668
...the victim had a name.

60
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,880
It was Jessica King.

61
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,553
Mr Hawkins, how long
have you worked out at Ay Jay's?

62
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,804
About ten years.

63
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,100
Were you working
on Saturday night, April 8th?

64
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,935
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:14,230
Did you see Donnie Barksdale
that night?

66
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,940
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,734
Could you describe the circumstances?

68
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:23,490
The circumstances were I come outside
to throw out some trash.

69
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,577
- Do you recall what time it was?
- About midnight, I reckon.

70
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,664
Anyhow, I seen Donnie Barksdale
out there by his truck

71
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:35,543
having an argument
with this white lady.

72
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:40,381
{y:i}She scratched his arm
{y:i}and he slapped the tar outta her.

73
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,926
{y:i}About that time, I go back inside.

74
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,554
- Is this the woman you saw with him?
- Yes, sir.

75
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,015
Your Honour, let the record show

76
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:54,730
that I've just shown Mr Hawkins
a photograph of Jessica King.

77
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,400
You just said
that your attention was drawn

78
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,279
to the defendant's pond.

79
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,032
Drawn in... Drawn in what way?

80
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,493
Me, Wayne Collins and Kenneth King

81
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,288
went to see a woman
name of Annie Wilson.

82
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,667
What made you think
she'd be able to help you?

83
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:19,254
Well, word around town was
that she was a...

84
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:24,385
...uh... well, I don't know
what the right word is.

85
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:28,346
- Isn't it "fortune teller"?
- I guess so.

86
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:33,727
What did this fortune teller see
when she looked into her crystal ball?

87
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:38,607
Well, she didn't have no ball.
She had these special cards.

88
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,944
What did she see
when she looked into her cards?

89
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,196
She didn't see nothin' then,

90
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:49,827
but next day, she come to see me
and told me she'd had this dream.

91
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,705
- She had a dream?
- Yes, sir.

92
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:58,419
She'd seen this pond that looked
a lot like Donnie Barksdale's...

93
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,297
...then she woke up from her dream

94
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:07,261
and she went outside
and looked up in this tree...

95
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,224
I'm all ears!

96
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:16,687
She seen Jessica King...

97
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,939
...floatin' in the tree...

98
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,235
...half-naked, with a chain
wrapped around her.

99
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:25,863
Floating around in a tree?

100
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,283
Yes, sir.

101
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:31,578
Floating in a tree...

102
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:35,372
...half-naked...

103
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,959
...chain wrapped around her.

104
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:41,838
Thank you, Sheriff.

105
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:44,341
Gerald Weems is just mean and skinny!

106
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,968
Never known a Weems worth a damn!

107
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:49,846
- He was just doin' his job.
- Mrs Wilson.

108
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:53,475
Can... Can I talk to you
for a minute?

109
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:55,935
Just call me later on, OK?

110
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,563
- OK.
- OK. Bye.

111
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:04,986
Look, Buddy, I got a lot on my mind,
hon. It... It's not a good time, OK?

112
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:09,032
Mrs Wilson... you did tell me
to do some thinkin' and talkin'

113
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:11,284
and I been thinkin'.

114
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,161
What?

115
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:16,831
Can you tell me
why I do things to myself

116
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,084
when I think about my daddy?

117
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:21,044
Oh, I... well...

118
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:25,548
Bud, you call me later, hon,
and we'll talk, all right?

119
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:28,426
- I need to talk to you!
- Buddy!

120
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:32,014
I been thinking about my daddy
and touching myself!

121
00:08:32,264 --> 00:08:34,432
- How?
- Why do I do that?

122
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:38,645
- Oh, Buddy...
- Something's bad wrong with me!

123
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:42,441
And... And I keep thinkin'
about that blue diamond...

124
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:46,319
If you look into one,
you won't think a negative thought!

125
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,199
I promise! Hon, I'm going
through a hard time myself!

126
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:55,328
I just...
I can't talk to you now, OK?

127
00:08:56,663 --> 00:09:01,127
Y'all burn in hell,
Annie Wilson!

128
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:13,347
Mike, I know you skipped school
and went to that trial.

129
00:09:13,598 --> 00:09:16,558
- How do you know?
- A little bird told me.

130
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:19,812
It's time you started
making things easier on me.

131
00:09:21,606 --> 00:09:23,316
Phone's ringing.

132
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:28,237
Second of all, I'm gonna have
to testify at that trial tomorrow.

133
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:31,115
- The phone's ringing, Momma!
- I'm not deaf!

134
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:33,368
Let the machine get it.

135
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:37,121
Donnie Barksdale's side
are gonna give me a hard time.

136
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:41,501
They're gonna call me names and I...
I just want you all to be prepared...

137
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:45,379
If you hear any bad stuff
about me, all right?

138
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:48,424
We're gonna have
to stick together on this.

139
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:51,761
{y:i}Annie Wilson,
{y:i}it's Buddy's mother!

140
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:54,430
{y:i}Buddy's threatening
{y:i}to kill his daddy!

141
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,433
He's got Odell tied up
in the back yard!

142
00:09:57,683 --> 00:10:01,813
- Accusing him of horrible things!
- Have you called the police?

143
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:06,651
He said if I did,
he'd kill Odell! He wants you!

144
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:12,657
Hey, Bud...

145
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:17,745
Buddy, put the strap down, hon!
Tell me what he's done to you!

146
00:10:17,996 --> 00:10:20,832
I'm here, Buddy.
You can talk to me, hon.

147
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:27,005
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT!
IT'S TOO GODDAMN LATE!

148
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:31,969
This here... is a criminal!

149
00:10:32,302 --> 00:10:34,888
And he's gonna be punished!

150
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:38,308
- Buddy... Buddy, it's Annie...
- You shut up!

151
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:40,602
- YOU SHUT UP!
- It's all right...

152
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:43,646
- GET AWAY! Where were you?!
- I'm sorry!

153
00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:49,236
You knew everything...
and you did nothing!

154
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:52,823
You ruined me! YOU RUINED ME!

155
00:10:53,073 --> 00:10:55,825
I was just a little boy, Daddy!

156
00:10:56,076 --> 00:10:59,246
It got so I was embarrassed
to go to school, Daddy!

157
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:03,833
How could you do that
to your little boy?!

158
00:11:14,803 --> 00:11:18,223
No, Bud, you put that down!
No, you put that down, Bud!

159
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:21,310
- You put that down! Listen to me!
- Get away!

160
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,646
- You, get away!
- All right, all right.

161
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:29,193
It's all right. Come on.

162
00:11:29,443 --> 00:11:32,822
Why didn't you help me, Annie?

163
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:36,492
- What?
- Why didn't you help me?!

164
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:40,121
- I had you for a friend and then...
- I am your friend.

165
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:46,043
Now I have nobody! I have NOBODY!

166
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:59,640
I'm gonna kill this thing.

167
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:03,477
NO!

168
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:12,195
Help me! Help me!

169
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:16,741
Look into that thing and tell me
what kind of thoughts you have!

170
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,828
You... look!

171
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:22,080
You lookin' at that thing?!

172
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:47,772
{y:i}Mrs Wilson... Mrs Wilson.

173
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:50,567
Your husband, Ben Wilson Senior,

174
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:55,530
was one of the men killed last year
in the explosion at the cable plant.

175
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,783
Yes, that's right.

176
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:01,203
You were left
with three children to raise alone.

177
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:03,788
Yes, sir.

178
00:13:04,038 --> 00:13:08,502
How do you provide
for you and your sons?

179
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,214
I get a little bit of money
from Social Security

180
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:17,219
as a result of my husband's death.

181
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:22,932
And I... I also give readings.

182
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:25,185
- Psychic readings?
- Yes, sir.

183
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:29,899
What does being psychic
enable you to do?

184
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:32,109
I see things...

185
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,821
...and I, you know, I sense... things

186
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:38,240
that hadn't happened yet or...

187
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,369
...they happened someplace else.

188
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:46,749
My granny told me that I... I had
a gift, that it runs in my family.

189
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:49,460
She told me
I shouldn't be afraid of it,

190
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,380
I should just always use my instinct
and I'd be all right.

191
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,469
So you're swearing before this court
that you didn't get your information

192
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:02,723
from any other means
than your special ability, your gift?

193
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:04,975
Yes, sir,

194
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:07,269
I'm swearing that, yes.

195
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,649
Thank you, Mrs Wilson.
I have no further questions.

196
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,528
Mr Weems.

197
00:14:18,197 --> 00:14:22,326
Mrs Wilson...

198
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:25,955
...how many fingers
am I holding up behind my back?

199
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:27,999
Objection!

200
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:34,380
My client is on trial partly because
of powers this woman claims to have.

201
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,094
In all fairness, I should be given
the opportunity to test the powers

202
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:41,972
instead of having
to take her word for it!

203
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:46,643
You have a good point.
Objection overruled.

204
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:53,024
Can everyone in the jury box see
how many fingers I'm showin'?

205
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:59,156
How many fingers, Mrs Wilson?

206
00:15:03,242 --> 00:15:05,245
I don't know.

207
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:09,541
You don't know?

208
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:15,213
- Seven. Seven fingers.
- That doesn't prove anything.

209
00:15:15,463 --> 00:15:19,426
Your Honour, I can't do this -
you know, at the drop of a hat.

210
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:23,888
Well, ma'am, how about doing it
at the drop of a dollar bill?

211
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:26,141
What are you trying to say?

212
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:29,853
Maybe this gift doesn't work
unless you're being paid.

213
00:15:30,104 --> 00:15:32,981
Like they say in the army -
no money, no honey.

214
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:34,941
That's not true.

215
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:40,281
In Hatcher County, it's illegal
for a psychic to charge people money.

216
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:44,117
- I-I don't charge money...
- You testified that you do!

217
00:15:44,368 --> 00:15:47,997
No, I accept donations.
People give me gifts.

218
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,750
Oh... a distinction
worthy of a lawyer.

219
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,044
Mrs Wilson, are you a rich woman?

220
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:57,256
- No.
- Why not?

221
00:15:57,506 --> 00:16:02,219
If I had powers like yours and could
read the future, I'd be filthy rich!

222
00:16:02,469 --> 00:16:07,266
I'd be playing the stockmarket,
I'd be at Mobile betting on the dogs.

223
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:12,229
I'd warn my husband not to go to work
on the day the plant's gonna blow up,

224
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:17,485
leaving three children to be raised
in a carnival sideshow!

225
00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:21,822
It doesn't work that way.
I can't use my gift for personal gain.

226
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:28,746
Except for those -
what you call 'em? - Donations.

227
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:37,839
You have had some personal troubles
with Donnie Barksdale, haven't you?

228
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,384
Yes, I have.

229
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:47,807
A few weeks ago, you said you were
gonna have his ass thrown in jail!

230
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,060
He was threatening my kids!

231
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,396
Isn't it true,
in one of those readings of yours

232
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,648
when you were doing your ESP,

233
00:16:55,898 --> 00:17:00,445
you told Valerie Barksdale
that Donnie was an insecure redneck

234
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:05,867
and he wasn't really crazy enough
to kill anybody?

235
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:14,459
- Yes, I did say that.
- Then why are you saying he did?

236
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:17,796
- I have never said that!
- You might as well have!

237
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:20,048
You wanted his ass in jail and...

238
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:22,508
I just told the Sheriff what I saw.

239
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:27,305
And how could any of us
ever forget that?

240
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:30,017
Jessica King floatin' up in that tree...

241
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:32,602
...naked...

242
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,188
...with a chain... wrapped...

243
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:39,068
...around her.

244
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:42,612
It must be so much fun for you.

245
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:47,493
You must be having the time of your
life entertaining yourself with...

246
00:17:47,743 --> 00:17:51,871
Think it's fun seeing decomposed
bodies in my tree, do you, sir?

247
00:17:52,122 --> 00:17:56,919
You think it's fun that I've people
trying to strangle me in my sleep?!

248
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:01,965
I'm blaming myself 'cause some crazy man
tried to burn his daddy half to death

249
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,218
and you think I'm having fun?!

250
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:07,513
I'm sorry, sir,
you're crazy if you think that!

251
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:11,099
No more questions, Your Honour.

252
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:14,978
You're dismissed.

253
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:32,037
Let's cut to the chase. Did you
or did you not kill Jessica King?

254
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:33,998
I did not.

255
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:38,795
Did you or did you not see Jessica
King on the night she was killed?

256
00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:41,046
Yeah, I seen her.

257
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:43,591
Describe the circumstances.

258
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:46,469
I'd been seeing her
for quite a while.

259
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:49,931
Would you clarify
what you mean by "seeing"?

260
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:53,476
I mean her and me
had been... having sex.

261
00:18:53,726 --> 00:18:56,771
OK... go ahead.

262
00:18:57,021 --> 00:18:59,524
Well, she called me about 11 o'clock

263
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:03,152
so I told her
I'd meet her out at Ay Jay's

264
00:19:03,402 --> 00:19:06,114
and I told my wife
I was going out for a beer.

265
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:09,075
- What happened?
- We got into an argument.

266
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:12,745
- She didn't wanna see me no more.
- She tell you why?

267
00:19:12,995 --> 00:19:17,000
She said she was getting married.
She wanted to stop playin' around.

268
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,252
Least till after the wedding.

269
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:25,967
During the course of this argument,
did you at any moment strike her?

270
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:31,389
Yes, sir.

271
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:35,435
What happened after you struck her?

272
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:38,855
She banged her head pretty hard
when she went down,

273
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:41,691
so I decided
to take her to the hospital.

274
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:44,569
- Did you reach the hospital?
- No, sir.

275
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:48,448
Are you feelin' OK?

276
00:19:48,949 --> 00:19:52,577
I'm fine.

277
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:57,916
I wanna go back. I don't wanna go
to the hospital. Someone might see me.

278
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:00,794
{y:i}She said
{y:i}she was feelin' better anyhow,

279
00:20:01,044 --> 00:20:03,046
{y:i}so I took her back to Ay Jay's.

280
00:20:03,296 --> 00:20:07,134
{y:i}I dropped her off,
{y:i}then I... I went on back home.

281
00:20:07,384 --> 00:20:11,888
{y:i}And that was the last time
{y:i}you saw Jessica King alive?

282
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:14,933
- Yes, sir, the very last.
- Donnie...

283
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:19,647
...are you guilty
of the charge against you?

284
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:22,232
I'm guilty of cheatin' on my wife...

285
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,860
...of being a bad husband...

286
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,446
...a bad Christian...

287
00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:32,492
...but I ain't guilty
of killing Jessie, I swear to God.

288
00:20:32,743 --> 00:20:35,871
No more questions, Your Honour.

289
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:38,332
Mr Duncan.

290
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:43,545
Mr Barksdale,
you're a wife-beater, aren't you?

291
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:48,634
I've swore
to tell the truth here today.

292
00:20:48,885 --> 00:20:53,013
Yeah, I've hit Valerie before.

293
00:20:53,264 --> 00:20:55,266
Guess it ain't no secret.

294
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:58,728
You admit to having a history
of violence against women

295
00:20:58,978 --> 00:21:02,314
and to beating up the victim
the night she was murdered.

296
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:05,568
- I wouldn't say I beat her up.
- You're the expert.

297
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:09,947
How badly do you have to beat a woman
before it fits your definition

298
00:21:10,197 --> 00:21:12,116
of beating up?

299
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:17,831
Now, your story is that you've been
having an affair with the victim.

300
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:21,459
Tell us why a beautiful young woman
like Jessica King,

301
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:24,963
from one of the finest families,
about to be married

302
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:29,301
to a decent professional man
and with a bright, shining future,

303
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:32,428
would get involved
with something like you.

304
00:21:32,678 --> 00:21:36,683
I asked her that myself one time.

305
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:40,394
She said I was the only man in town
who knew how to fuck.

306
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,191
You're really disgusting,
you know that?

307
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:48,153
- Objection, Your Honour!
- Sustained.

308
00:21:48,403 --> 00:21:51,823
Mr Duncan, refrain from making
personal comments.

309
00:21:52,073 --> 00:21:56,203
I apologise, Your Honour.
It won't happen again.

310
00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:59,664
So let's get this straight.
Let's clarify this.

311
00:21:59,914 --> 00:22:02,459
You're saying
it just was a coincidence

312
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:06,254
that on the same night
that you assaulted Jessica King,

313
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:09,466
someone else
put her body in your pond?

314
00:22:09,716 --> 00:22:12,427
- I'm not saying that!
- What are you saying?

315
00:22:12,677 --> 00:22:15,764
- I got framed!
- Oh, what an original defence!

316
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:18,225
Did you think of Jessica as a stray cat?

317
00:22:18,475 --> 00:22:22,187
- No.
- Did you say a cat clawed your arm?

318
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:26,233
Didn't you just tell us
that Jessica scratched your arm?

319
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:30,237
Didn't you tell the Sheriff the cat
didn't like it when you killed her?

320
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:33,699
I was lying!
My wife was standing right there!

321
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:36,619
- How do we know you're not now?!
- I'm not!

322
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:40,080
- It's her, goddamnit!
- Be seated, Mr Barksdale!

323
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:47,755
She's a goddamn witch! She's putting
spells on every-damn-body in town!

324
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,139
{y:i}In Brixton today,
{y:i}Donald J Barksdale was found guilty

325
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,767
{y:i}in the sex and strangulation
{y:i}killing of Jessica King,

326
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:04,689
{y:i}daughter of the prominent
{y:i}businessman Kenneth King.

327
00:23:04,939 --> 00:23:07,817
Is everything gonna be
all right now, Momma?

328
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:11,320
Yeah, hon.

329
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,408
We can get on with our lives now.

330
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,880
I-I guess I'm the last person
you wanna see.

331
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,387
How you been?

332
00:24:19,722 --> 00:24:22,976
Terrible.

333
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:25,896
Annie, if you tell me
to get goin', I will.

334
00:24:26,146 --> 00:24:31,860
I wouldn't blame you,
but... I need you to read for me.

335
00:24:37,616 --> 00:24:41,244
Give me a hand.

336
00:24:42,746 --> 00:24:45,791
I feel like I can't hold on
any longer.

337
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,919
I mean, I know Donnie's mean
and everythin',

338
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:51,213
but I feel real lost without him.

339
00:24:51,463 --> 00:24:54,258
You know, I ain't ever been
on my own before.

340
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:57,136
I-I'm scared, Annie.

341
00:24:57,386 --> 00:25:02,933
You don't need to be scared, hon.
You'll be fine.

342
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,102
You see that in the cards?

343
00:25:05,352 --> 00:25:08,980
Mm-hm. Right through here.

344
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,945
Can you see what I'm thinkin'?
Can you see that in the cards?

345
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:17,198
What do you mean?

346
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:19,408
Well...

347
00:25:19,658 --> 00:25:25,081
I've been thinkin'
some real bad, bad thoughts.

348
00:25:25,331 --> 00:25:27,542
Un-Christian thoughts.

349
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,626
Like what?

350
00:25:29,877 --> 00:25:32,672
Like...

351
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:35,758
...I'm glad that girl's dead - Jessica.

352
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:39,470
Messin' around with my husband,
she deserved what she got.

353
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,722
No one deserves that.

354
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:47,062
Like I said,
I know it's un-Christian...

355
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:53,067
What?

356
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:57,155
Are you seeing something bad?

357
00:25:58,781 --> 00:26:02,410
I don't know.

358
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,667
It's not clear.

359
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:48,684
FUCK YOU!

360
00:28:28,432 --> 00:28:32,061
Wayne?

361
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:44,658
Wayne?

362
00:29:03,677 --> 00:29:07,764
It's not normally like this.

363
00:29:12,102 --> 00:29:15,189
You need to lie down.

364
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:17,649
I'm really... not sleepy.

365
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:22,613
I think, if you sleep,
you'll feel better.

366
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:37,753
Thank you, Annie.

367
00:30:02,445 --> 00:30:06,074
Wayne...

368
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:10,953
...I don't think this is a good idea.

369
00:30:10,953 --> 00:30:14,582
No...

370
00:30:15,124 --> 00:30:18,753
...it's not.

371
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:24,884
I just thought we could
forget all this for a while.

372
00:30:25,176 --> 00:30:28,804
You want to, don't you?

373
00:30:43,528 --> 00:30:47,657
I know there's something between us.

374
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,624
I can't.

375
00:30:55,874 --> 00:30:59,919
I guess I still feel married.

376
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:04,967
You're not, though.

377
00:31:05,676 --> 00:31:07,468
He's gone.

378
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:09,929
I know.

379
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,434
You gotta learn to deal with that.

380
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:21,483
The same way I gotta learn to deal
with the fact that Jessica's gone.

381
00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:28,782
She's dead.

382
00:31:28,907 --> 00:31:32,745
Oh, Wayne, I'm so sorry.

383
00:31:33,704 --> 00:31:35,915
It's OK.

384
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:40,294
No, it's not OK.

385
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:47,342
I don't think
Donnie Barksdale killed her.

386
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:49,845
- No, no, Annie...
- I'm really sorry.

387
00:31:50,095 --> 00:31:52,306
I... I can't do this. It's finished.

388
00:31:52,556 --> 00:31:55,560
I know I want to let
that bastard rot in jail.

389
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,645
- He's guilty!
- No, Wayne.

390
00:31:58,896 --> 00:32:02,525
I see it.

391
00:32:03,818 --> 00:32:07,446
I see he didn't do it.

392
00:32:09,698 --> 00:32:12,493
- Do you see who did?
- I-I'm trying.

393
00:32:12,743 --> 00:32:15,997
But... I don't know yet.

394
00:32:16,246 --> 00:32:19,917
What are we gonna do?

395
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:23,129
Well... if you ever had
a piece of clothing...

396
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:25,882
...or maybe
I could go out to the pond...

397
00:32:26,131 --> 00:32:29,760
...or... see if I...

398
00:32:30,553 --> 00:32:33,056
It's not over.

399
00:32:33,306 --> 00:32:36,934
Jesus!

400
00:34:16,994 --> 00:34:20,623
Come on in.

401
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,419
Well?

402
00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:27,629
What brings you out here?

403
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,341
I'll just come straight out
and say it.

404
00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:33,302
I don't think Donnie
killed Jessica King.

405
00:34:33,553 --> 00:34:36,972
- It was open-and-shut.
- I'm telling you he didn't.

406
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:39,225
The killer is still out there.

407
00:34:39,475 --> 00:34:42,979
- The Barksdales threatening you?
- No.

408
00:34:43,229 --> 00:34:46,941
- I'll talk to Pearl...
- This has nothing to do with them.

409
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:49,694
I know Donnie didn't kill Jessica

410
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:53,740
the same way I knew
her body was in his pond.

411
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:58,244
And do you know who did kill her?

412
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:01,372
No.

413
00:35:01,623 --> 00:35:03,667
So what do you care? He's in jail.

414
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:06,335
I got a warning today.

415
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:09,339
I think somebody's gonna try
and kill me.

416
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:12,759
- So what do you want me to do?
- Re-open the case.

417
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:16,262
- I can't. He's been convicted.
- Talk to somebody!

418
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:21,309
- I'd look like a fool!
- I don't give a damn how you'd look!

419
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,562
Now, you listen to me.

420
00:35:23,812 --> 00:35:26,814
I know you had an affair
with Jessica.

421
00:35:27,065 --> 00:35:31,444
So how will you look if people find
out you had sex with the "victim"

422
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:35,365
the night before she was killed?

423
00:35:58,805 --> 00:36:02,434
You want money?

424
00:36:03,853 --> 00:36:08,732
No, I want you to re-open the case.

425
00:36:10,317 --> 00:36:13,571
There's a saying
about letting sleeping dogs lie.

426
00:36:13,821 --> 00:36:17,699
You think you're in danger now?
Look at it logically.

427
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,871
The danger begins if it's re-opened
and someone starts worrying

428
00:36:22,121 --> 00:36:27,626
that you're gonna have
another one of your damn dreams.

429
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:40,931
The wrong man's in jail -
I don't care how awful he is -

430
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:44,810
and I helped put him there.

431
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,148
I can't live with something like that.

432
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:52,652
So you find a way to re-open
this case, sir...

433
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:56,530
...or I will.

434
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:35,403
Buddy?

435
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:44,412
Buddy, I'm here...

436
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:12,483
{y:i}- Hello?
- Hi, Mrs Francis, I'm back.

437
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:14,776
- How are the boys?
{y:i}- Just fine.

438
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,237
{y:i}- Want me to bring them over?
- No!

439
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:21,867
No, listen... could we stay
over at your house tonight?

440
00:38:22,117 --> 00:38:26,163
{y:i}- Sure you can. You all right?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

441
00:38:26,413 --> 00:38:28,832
{y:i}- Well, come on over.
- All right.

442
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:31,085
- I'm just gonna lock up.
{y:i}- OK.

443
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:34,212
- Thank you.
{y:i}- Bye-bye.

444
00:38:48,811 --> 00:38:51,731
Buddy?

445
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,235
Have you seen Buddy Cole?

446
00:38:56,485 --> 00:38:59,739
No, I thought he was
at the hospital in Benton.

447
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:01,741
- Oh, he is.
- You OK?

448
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:05,452
- Maybe I imagined it.
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.

449
00:39:05,703 --> 00:39:10,124
Since you told me what you told me
today, I feel like I'm going crazy.

450
00:39:10,374 --> 00:39:16,714
I can't stand another night of this.
I need you to read for me.

451
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:27,558
It's no good.

452
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:32,522
- Try again.
- I can't make it happen.

453
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:41,990
How about what you said today?

454
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,200
What?

455
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,452
The... The pond.

456
00:39:46,703 --> 00:39:49,748
What... What if we did
go back out there?

457
00:39:49,998 --> 00:39:53,834
Do you think that might help you?

458
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:57,338
I don't know. Yeah... maybe.

459
00:39:57,589 --> 00:40:00,091
Yeah, OK,
then it's worth a try, right?

460
00:40:00,342 --> 00:40:04,846
You mean tonight? No, Wayne, I can't
do that. I got my kids. It's dark.

461
00:40:05,096 --> 00:40:08,725
You know, it's...
It's a police matter now.

462
00:40:08,975 --> 00:40:11,186
How long do you think that'll take?

463
00:40:11,436 --> 00:40:13,730
It'll sit on someone's desk
for months.

464
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,192
It's over for them.
They've got their man. It's up to us.

465
00:40:17,442 --> 00:40:22,322
I know, but I'm telling you,
I don't see anything!

466
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:29,830
You can't keeping running
from things.

467
00:41:18,754 --> 00:41:21,382
Maybe if you just sort of walk around.

468
00:41:21,632 --> 00:41:25,261
All right.

469
00:42:05,468 --> 00:42:09,097
Oh, shoot!

470
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,860
Jeez! You all right? You OK?

471
00:42:23,111 --> 00:42:26,531
Yeah.

472
00:42:27,991 --> 00:42:31,411
Yeah.

473
00:43:04,861 --> 00:43:08,490
What are you doin' here?

474
00:43:13,996 --> 00:43:18,042
You seeing something?

475
00:43:25,632 --> 00:43:30,596
{y:i}I've been thinkin'
{y:i}some real bad, bad thoughts.

476
00:43:30,847 --> 00:43:33,891
{y:i}I'm glad that girl's dead -
{y:i}Jessica.

477
00:43:34,141 --> 00:43:39,856
{y:i}Messin' around with my husband,
{y:i}she deserved what she got.

478
00:43:41,482 --> 00:43:46,362
I couldn't sleep.
I met the girls for a drink.

479
00:43:46,529 --> 00:43:48,740
Take off your clothes.

480
00:43:54,703 --> 00:43:58,124
Aren't you taking yours off, too?

481
00:43:58,374 --> 00:44:02,461
{y:i}There's a saying
{y:i}about letting sleeping dogs lie.

482
00:44:02,711 --> 00:44:06,382
You just fucked him, didn't you?

483
00:44:09,135 --> 00:44:12,763
Donnie Barksdale?

484
00:44:14,056 --> 00:44:17,310
- So?
- Why would you do this to me?!

485
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,814
- I love you!
- Maybe I wanted to be with a man!

486
00:44:21,064 --> 00:44:24,484
- Watch your mouth!
- You watch your mouth! Fuck you!

487
00:44:24,734 --> 00:44:29,155
We're through!
I don't like being spied on!

488
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:34,077
The only reason I'm with you
is 'cause my daddy likes you!

489
00:44:34,327 --> 00:44:36,538
- You're a joke!
- You little bitch!

490
00:44:36,788 --> 00:44:41,460
I'll show you a bitch
if you don't let go of me!

491
00:45:02,021 --> 00:45:06,193
- I think we'd better go back.
- Nothing's coming to you?

492
00:45:06,443 --> 00:45:08,237
No...

493
00:45:08,487 --> 00:45:12,157
...nothing.

494
00:45:19,957 --> 00:45:23,585
You know.

495
00:45:24,419 --> 00:45:28,048
I knew if I got you
close enough to it, you'd see it.

496
00:45:28,299 --> 00:45:31,052
- Wayne, I-I told you...
- No, no, it's OK.

497
00:45:31,302 --> 00:45:33,762
I swear to God, Annie,
it's OK, it's OK.

498
00:45:34,012 --> 00:45:37,600
I wanted you to. I swear to God,
I wanted you to see it so bad.

499
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:39,852
That's why we're here.

500
00:45:40,102 --> 00:45:42,479
I'm not some killer, Annie. I'm not.

501
00:45:42,729 --> 00:45:45,816
You don't... Do you know
what it was like with her?

502
00:45:46,066 --> 00:45:49,153
She... She was
so fucking hurtful and spiteful!

503
00:45:49,403 --> 00:45:51,114
- Wayne...
- I know!

504
00:45:51,363 --> 00:45:53,991
It all happened
in this flash of a moment.

505
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:57,537
- Wayne, I...
- Listen to me! I'm a good man!

506
00:45:57,787 --> 00:46:04,752
If it had been you with me instead of
her, none of this would've happened!

507
00:46:06,754 --> 00:46:12,885
It's all right, you know.
I won't... I won't tell.

508
00:46:14,553 --> 00:46:19,225
I-I won't... I won't tell anybody.

509
00:46:19,392 --> 00:46:23,020
Oh, Annie...

510
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:38,848
Are you all right, Mrs Wilson?

511
00:48:26,062 --> 00:48:30,108
I thought you were supposed
to be in the hospital.

512
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:33,986
I escaped, Mrs Wilson.

513
00:48:34,987 --> 00:48:37,657
I'm free.

514
00:48:37,907 --> 00:48:42,036
Buddy, I'm so sorry
I wasn't there for you.

515
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:47,167
- I should've been...
- Don't you say another word.

516
00:48:48,668 --> 00:48:53,589
You was the only one
that was a friend to me...

517
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,469
...and I love you.

518
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,808
You're the soul of this town,
Mrs Wilson...

519
00:49:04,058 --> 00:49:09,147
...and you just need
to keep doin' what you're doin'.

520
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,289
I washed it.

521
00:49:39,637 --> 00:49:42,055
Will you come back into town with me?

522
00:49:42,305 --> 00:49:45,934
Yeah.

523
00:50:00,115 --> 00:50:04,495
You know you're gonna have to go back.

524
00:50:04,745 --> 00:50:08,374
Yes, ma'am, I know.

525
00:50:40,614 --> 00:50:44,243
Can I have your keys, ma'am?

526
00:51:08,059 --> 00:51:13,815
I just talked to Wayne.
He pretty much admitted to everything.

527
00:51:14,065 --> 00:51:19,570
I've known that boy...
about half my life.

528
00:51:20,863 --> 00:51:25,744
Just goes to show -
you can know somebody...

529
00:51:27,537 --> 00:51:31,165
...and not know 'em.

530
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:34,085
How's his...

531
00:51:34,336 --> 00:51:37,798
- How's his head?
- You put a pretty good dent in it.

532
00:51:38,048 --> 00:51:41,968
Oh, no, Sheriff. I told the...
I told the deputy.

533
00:51:42,218 --> 00:51:44,679
It wasn't me who did that. It was Buddy.

534
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,266
- He saved me.
- No, it weren't Buddy.

535
00:51:47,516 --> 00:51:51,186
Well, yes, it was.
Why don't you just ask Wayne?

536
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:55,274
I did.
He don't remember what happened.

537
00:51:55,524 --> 00:51:59,527
- Head injuries is funny.
- I'm telling you, it was Buddy...

538
00:51:59,778 --> 00:52:05,200
What I'm trying to say is...
it couldn't have been Buddy.

539
00:52:05,451 --> 00:52:07,453
I called at the State Hospital.

540
00:52:07,703 --> 00:52:12,749
- He told me he escaped.
- Ma'am...

541
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,837
Buddy Cole is dead.

542
00:52:17,546 --> 00:52:21,633
He hanged hisself
in the shower room...

543
00:52:21,884 --> 00:52:25,513
...at six o'clock this evening.

544
00:52:33,354 --> 00:52:36,983
But he...
