00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,320
When I remember Lisa, I don't think about our clouds

2
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,400
or her work, or where she was from or what she said.

3
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,680
I think about her smell, her taste

4
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,360
her skin searching mine

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,920
The first time I met her was the Brixton Academy

00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,680
# You want a part of me #

9
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,080
# You want the whole thing #

10
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,920
# You want to feel something more than I could ever bring #

11
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,640
# You want it badly You want it tangled #

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,920
# I want to feel something more #

13

# with the sweet sensation #

15
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,840
# I gave my heart to a simple chord #

16
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,160
# I gave my soul to a new religion #

17
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,520
# Whatever happened to you? #

18
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,960
# Whatever happened to our #

# Whatever happened to my rock'n'roll? #

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,800
# She wants it hallow #

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,400
# She wants it tainted #

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,200
# She wants to feel something more than she was naked #

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,640
# You want to hide away You're scared to touch it #

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,960
# I want to feel something more than #

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,200
# I care to take. I fell in love with the sweet sensation #

# Whatever happened to you? #

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,720

32
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,640

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,800
# to my rock'n'roll? #

34
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,960
# You can't have it crying #

35
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,320
# Neither with your disguise. #

36
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,040
# Was so sweet, yes #

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,000
# She's not the leader of religion #

38
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,920
Go save your soul, ok?

39
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,680
Where are you going?

40
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,160
I have a meeting this morning. An appointment

41
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,320
with my supervisor

42
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,160
The Antarctic

43
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,400
13,800.000 km2(square Km)s of ICE.

44
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,320
A continent of ICE

45
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,000
A place where no man had ever been until its 20th century

84
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,440
Oh Baby, pay attention to me?

85
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,400
Who's gonna make your breakfast?

86
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,000
Ah, yes.

87
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,240

96
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,640
Fuck me faster.

Come inside me! Come on....!

99
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,880
Coffee?

100
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,520
Yeah...

101
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,200
- Why not?
- I will put it back on you

102
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,120
Do you think I look like a boy?

103
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,600
Yeah, so I like it

104
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,640
Boy?

105
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,760
Girl?

106
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,840
I feel it big muscle

107
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,000
Look like wings!

108
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,720
You look like an angel

109
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,720
There's a big clog

110
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,560
Only unhappy people abhor dancing.

111
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,440
- How's Americans dance?
- Like this

112
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,800
- Um...Turn around
- Like this?

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,280
And everyones in Brasil..

114
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,800
I guess they can't help it

115
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,360
This is how we dance raves in America

116
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,920
This is how we dance in England

117
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,280
That's fantastic

118
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,400
I think we will make love without using a condom

119
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,840
No!

120
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,000
Why? I did all the test...make sure I am clean

121
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,360
I know

122
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,640
But I like better this way

123
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,760
Can I take a bath?

124
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,080
Yeah...you should....Dick is stink

125
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,800

Ahh...No I was fine..I just kind a finish work and came home

127
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,720

00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,520
Ummm! You always get all the good boys..! Um..What's the name?

129

131
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,960
Natasha always comes back at the boutique
You know stories about this really grand man she meets

132
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,160
Really..Really fucking weird man

133
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,640
The weirdest people comming to our bar...the princes,

134
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,480

136
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,880
I went out with a guy who always had a briefcase with him

137
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,600
And rumor had it that is filled 20,000 Euros at all times

138
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,800
Did you have seen the money?

139
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,680

The ICE sheet can be 4 km a date

236
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,880
The ICE found that can be half-million years old.

237
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,440
The air trapped in the ICE..

238
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,040
We called the climate when the ICE was formed

239
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,760
The Antarctic is a planet's memory

240
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,120
a memory of time before there were the people

241
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,280
She is 21...beautiful..egotistical

242
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,920
careless and crazy

243
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,080
Hey!

244
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,880
listen to this

245
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,400
Immediately after I undressing I was 
a little embarrassed discouvered that I had a hard-on

246
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,240
And I lay down on my stomach beside her

247
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,680
One of the misshaped pubic hair

248
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,400
You can easily make out of slender delicate slit.

249
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,240
I really go for that type of pussy Valery said low voice

250
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,000
It make you feel like slipping  your finger inside?

251
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,720
As she lay down..I can make out of the thick plump lips of pussy

252
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,880
I heard footsteps approaching accross 
the sand and I closed my eyes again.

253
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,520
It sounds very hard on your skin

254
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,920
Don't weigh that belt on my face

255
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,320
You know I got hurt once

256
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,840
while wave of fart in front of my face.

257
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,080
Oh..no, don't put me stockings on

258
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
No..I can't see..

259
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,000
Forget who you are

260
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,000
Forget where you are

261
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,120
You are on a beach in Silent

262
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,600
Your eyes closed

263
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,160
So you can't see them

264
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,040
You feel them watching you

265
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,920
There's a couple behind me

266
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,280
Am I right?

267
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,040
I can feel them looking at me

268
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,440
And I put my hand between my legs.

269
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,040
I am so wet.

270
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,600
she slide down her boyfriend body

271
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,520
she has most amazing breast

272
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,480
And she is rubbing them

273
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,520
And she's covered with the oil

274
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,000
She leans toward ...to her...rr

275
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,880

276
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,040
she grabs his balls.

277
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,080

332
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,840
Ok.

333
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,720
in bed

334
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,360
# Artist: Goldfrapp 'HORSE TEARS'#
# The night has fallen #

335
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,960
# mute and cold #

336
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,960
# My horse is crying #

337
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,720
# But you know #

338
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,160
# all this time #

339
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,160
# But you know #

340
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,400
# all this time #

341
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,720
# that you'd never want #

342
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,480
# keep you still #

343
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,440
# Dare to come #

344
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,960
# But you love me #

345
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,800
# still #

346
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,920
# But you love me #

347
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,240
# Tears too cold #

348
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,000
OK?

349
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,000
Lisa didn't wanna go to the gate that night?

350
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,880
so I gave her ticket away

351
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,600
Five thousand people are woman but you can still be alone

# life....... #

367
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,880
Did you put sugar in my tea?

368
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,520
Possibly

369
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,800
I don't like sugar in my tea

370
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,760
Good for your...

371
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,240
I don't wanna be pick time....

372
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,200
You gonna drink your tea?

373
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,560
It's too hot

374
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,120
And it's got sugar in it?

375
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,240
You are so boring today..!

376
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,360
boring

377
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,880
Bo..Boring

378
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,440
I am sure someone name Bo...Boring

379
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,840
Bodereck

380
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,840
Its own fucking interesting when you start taking pills this time a day

381
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,240
You know what? I hardly taking the fucking pills this time a day

382
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,840
I took my prescription pill.. then I take everyday

383
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,320
That I have been taking  since you fucking met me

384
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,640
I didn't take any of those pills..
Did you see me taking any of those pills?

385
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:36,000
You been sitting right in front of me..... Are you sitting in front of me?
...now looking at..... don't pay any fucking attention to me?

386
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,120
Hey

387
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,320
Hi

388
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,480
I bought your president

389

Me

390
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,160
Just kidding

391

# Artist: Elbow 'I've Got Your Number'#

# have done #

402
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,440
Do you find my nipple swell to you? They are

403
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,720
Really?

404
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,280
# Artist: Franz Ferdinand 'Jacqueline'#

414
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,120
# She can return you the face #

415
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,000

Explorering Antarctic..

444
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,800
is almost like exploring space

445
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,880
You enter a void

446
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,280
Thousand of mile with no poeple..

447
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,440
no animals..no plants

448
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,600
You isolated on a vast...

449
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,000
empty continent

450
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,800
Claustrophobia and Agoraphobia is in a same place

451
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,960
like a two people in a bed

452
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:05,080
We spend my birthday in a hotel where friend of Lisa worked

453
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,280
Lisa gave me a book on Antarctic as my present

454
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,720
The Ice is everywhere and everything

455
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,320
It spreads to all sides unbounded void of

456
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,600
alien whiteness in geometric rigor

457
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,720
The Antarctic is highest, windest, driest continents

458
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,720
Its topography and dynamics is simpliest on earth

459
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,880
An exercise of reductionism

460
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,520
The iceberg is the microcosm of the Antarctica

461
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,920
Its fragment torn loose from the continents both substance and symbol

462
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,880
within it's ICE the burg contains record of all ICE terrains

463
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,560
As it moves away from the massive ICE it gradually disintegrates

464
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,080
Most burgs last less than two month in an open sea

465
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,560
so your back...

466
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,800
It's just this ...back & forth

467
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,920
But you have to move your ass more

468
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,680
- Do you love it?
- Turn around

469
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,480
Bend over

470
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,640
What time is it?

471
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,080
I don't know

472
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,880
Souldn't have a light?...

473
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,280
That's so attractive

474
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,520
Yeah...

475
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,840
We will save the rest for late

476
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,000
It is Michael Nyman's 60th birthday concert

477
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,280
That was the night she told me she's going back to America.

478
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,920
You looks like a gangster, you like that?

479
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,040
Trying look like a gangster

480
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,440
You look ugly

481
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,200
Trying look ugly

482
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:04,400
it's just for a year..um..?

483
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,560
Sometimes you have to have faith in people

484
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,360
- You miss me?
- Always

485
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,120
There's only a week before her flight to home

486
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,320
She was like a tourist on holiday In London

487
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,040
she bought souvenirs and Christmas presents

488
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,840
She was happy to be leaving

489
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,280
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

490
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,840
- One, two, three!
- Heee..Ya

491
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,320
- Ha..ha I like this
- Yeah...

492
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,600
I see in your future.

493
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,240
Hey

494
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,640
The day she left was the first time she invite me to her apartment

495
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,840
She didn't want me to come in the airport mount the station with her

496
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,200
She didn't want any long goodbyes

497
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,480
That you fly over the continet you see the journey of the ice in reverse

498
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,120
The sea, the Iceberg, the see Ice,

499
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,720
the Ice-shelf and the Ice sheet

500
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,480
Each year the Ice inches its way from the heart of the continent

501
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,080
to the see into which it finally melts

502
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,840
It's beautiful!

503

# Never thought I'd rather die #

509

# No loss, our love's been hung on a cross #

517
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,600
# Nothing seems to make a sound #

518
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,680
# And now it's all so clear somehow #

519
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,160
# Nothing really #

520
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,920
# matters now #

521
