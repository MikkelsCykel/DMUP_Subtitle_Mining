<i>- Target four. Wanna take the other truck?
- Roger.</i>

2
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:15,049
<i>Move by the truck.</i>

3
00:01:15,724 --> 00:01:16,953
<i>Move in right there.</i>

4
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:20,859
<i>Roger. He's wounded. Hit him.
Start hitting the truck.</i>

5
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,055
<i>Get the truck and him.
Go forward of it and hit him.</i>

6
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:27,498
<i>Roger.</i>

7
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:30,070
<i>Go ahead and store that.</i>

8
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,763
<i>Another guy moving right through.</i>

9
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:33,932
<i>Good. Fire. Hit him.</i>

10
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,864
Get down on the floor.

11
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:02,093
I said, down. Down.

12
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:03,933
You. Down. Now.

13
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:08,237
Let me see your hands.

14
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:10,772
Let me see your hands.

15
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:15,216
Get the hands over your head.
Over your head!

16
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,911
Get down.

17
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,955
On your knees.

18
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:25,753
There. Stay there.

19
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:30,798
Get your hands up.
Get your hands up.

20
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,331
Get down.

21
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:38,135
Shit, there's a kid in there.

22
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:41,269
That's not our problem.

23
00:02:41,443 --> 00:02:42,741
None of this is our problem.

24
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,573
Get your hands in the air.

25
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:48,807
Hey.

26
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:56,989
How's it going, little man?

27
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:00,689
You all right?

28
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:11,532
<i>I was 27 years old the first time I died.</i>

29
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:14,500
<i>I remember there was white everywhere.</i>

30
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:19,170
<i>There was war, and I felt alive.
But, really, I was dead.</i>

31
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,617
- So how old?
- Twenty-seven.

32
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:26,781
Here he is. Starks, Jack.

33
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:30,483
Born in Vermont.
Hasn't got a family listed.

34
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,060
Naval hospital will take care of it.

35
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:39,996
Oh, my God.

36
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:43,366
- This soldier's alive. This man just blinked.
- Been tagged already.

37
00:03:43,538 --> 00:03:46,235
- Worry about the others.
- No, no, look at this.

38
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:51,574
Oh, shit. Code blue, code blue.
We need a doctor.

39
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:54,409
Get a doctor over here now.

40
00:03:58,288 --> 00:03:59,754
Sergeant Starks was very lucky.

41
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:02,390
A little more to the right,
it wouldn't have come out.

42
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:05,253
He has retrograde amnesia,
acute psychological suppression.

43
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:06,724
<i>We couldn't find any family...</i>

44
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,326
<i>...in the States, sergeant.</i>

45
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:11,295
<i>- I'm sure you have friends.
- I want the paperwork this afternoon.</i>

46
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:14,459
<i>- Get him on the next flight out of here.
- Yes, sir.</i>

47
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:18,403
<i>He's recommended you for
the Bronze Star, sergeant.</i>

48
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:21,906
<i>- There is help for you, sergeant.
- Of course there is.</i>

49
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:24,245
<i>Of course there is.</i>

50
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,889
You guys all right?

51
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:41,124
- Our car won't start.
- That's your mom?

52
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,925
- Yeah.
- What's your mom's name?

53
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:46,624
Jean.

54
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:48,598
Hey, Jean.

55
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:52,072
Can you hear me?

56
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,009
Can you wake up?

57
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,740
I need you to try and stay awake.

58
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:03,514
- Oh, God.
- Your mom taking anything?

59
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:16,562
- What's your name?
- Jackie.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,865
Nice to meet you, Jackie.

61
00:05:20,502 --> 00:05:22,903
Tell you what. Why don't you do this.

62
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,233
Wrap it around yourself...

63
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,968
...and you try and keep your mom awake,
and I'll go work on your car.

64
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:31,136
- All right?
- Okay.

65
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,622
Oh, God.

66
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,596
No. Oh, no...

67
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:03,142
What do you think of all this snow?

68
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:07,012
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

69
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:11,317
What are these?

70
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:17,353
Those are dog tags. See, they got the name
and the date of birth on them.

71
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:20,461
- What for?
- In case I get lost...

72
00:06:21,363 --> 00:06:24,560
...or can't remember who I am.
- Can I have them?

73
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:29,168
- Yeah, you can have them.
- Thanks.

74
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,702
You think you can reach the ignition?

75
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:37,209
Go ahead and give it a shot.

76
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:42,173
Just keep turning, all right?

77
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:51,689
Keep going.

78
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:54,824
It works.

79
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:04,473
Hey, get your fucking hands off...

80
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,906
Get your fucking hands off my daughter.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter.

81
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,175
- Mom, he fixed our car.
- Jackie, get in that car. Now.

82
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,718
- Mom. He fixed the car.
- Get in the goddamn car!

83
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:06,593
- How's it going?
- Pretty good, man.

84
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:08,862
- Where you headed?
- On up in Canada.

85
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,199
- I can take you to the border.
- That'd be great.

86
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:14,137
- All right, bud, jump on in.
- It's freezing.

87
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:17,642
- Hey, man.
- Hey. Thanks.

88
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:19,644
Jump on in here. Hey, no problem.

89
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:21,783
My God, it's cold.

90
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:24,942
- Must've been freezing out there, boy.
- Yeah.

91
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,456
It's colder than a witch's titty with
a brass bra on doing pushups in the snow.

92
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:34,860
- So you drive?
- Yeah, sure.

93
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,225
All right, man, great.
We'll switch up in a bit.

94
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:43,827
You ever been to jail?

95
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:48,099
- No, I've never been to jail.
- I'll tell you what, buddy...

96
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,336
...it's a whole lot
goddamn worse than war.

97
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:52,639
It's probably worse
than anywhere you been.

98
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:54,509
I doubt that.

99
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,275
Are you kidding me?

100
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:01,183
What's he pulling us over for?

101
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,785
Recreation.

102
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:14,402
Jackie and Jean are the only things
you know for certain about that day?

103
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,934
Yes.

104
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:22,509
Are you aware that we have no last name,
no place of residence...

105
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:29,013
...and no record of any physical
presence for these friends of yours?

106
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:37,321
I'm afraid I might have to actually
hear that answer, Mr. Starks.

107
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,724
Yes.

108
00:09:41,062 --> 00:09:43,895
Officer Harrison
had been shot three times.

109
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:48,568
He was long dead
by the time we got there.

110
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:50,706
Jack Starks could be
blocking the incident.

111
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:54,467
It would explain his well-conceived plan
about the little girl and her mother.

112
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:56,770
- Objection.
- I have heard of Gulf War syndrome.

113
00:09:56,946 --> 00:10:00,711
War is just a CNN special. Half the shit
that went on in Operation Desert Storm...

114
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:03,908
...can't be tidied into
a top-of-the-hour headline.

115
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:07,581
Couldn't be said neatly,
so couldn't be said at all.

116
00:10:07,756 --> 00:10:09,519
- There was someone else.
- War's ugly.

117
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,684
- And they don't put ugly on TV.
- My client thinks he already died once.

118
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:18,163
- I don't really remember all of it...
- He doesn't know what's going on.

119
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:21,659
...but there was someone else.

120
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:25,229
I think that's what happened.

121
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:28,274
If Starks did kill that officer...

122
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:31,173
...can't hold a man responsible
for a damaged mind.

123
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:36,546
We, the jury, find the defendant
not guilty by reason of insanity.

124
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:41,589
<i>Jack Starks, I hereby sentence you
to be committed...</i>

125
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:44,418
<i>...to an institution
for the criminally insane...</i>

126
00:10:44,592 --> 00:10:48,528
<i>...where I hope the doctors
and proper treatment can help you.</i>

127
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:50,359
Come on, bud.

128
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:05,706
Come on.

129
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,879
What are you doing?

130
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:06,096
Get him up.

131
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:01,245
Please believe...

132
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,583
What are you doing? I don't belong here.

133
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,558
- I don't belong here.
- No, I don't think you do either.

134
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,426
But neither of us
can do anything about that now.

135
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:17,966
Please. Please.

136
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,736
Let me out of here.

137
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:30,778
Let me out of here. Please.

138
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,025
- How much did you give him?
- Fifty cc's.

139
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:55,669
- And he's been in for the full three hours?
- Yes, sir.

140
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:57,999
Okay, get him out.

141
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,208
Jack, can you hear me?

142
00:16:11,552 --> 00:16:13,645
Jack, blink for me if you can.

143
00:16:20,461 --> 00:16:24,557
- He didn't lose consciousness.
- Do you wanna put him back in?

144
00:16:24,732 --> 00:16:26,461
No, take him out of it.

145
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:29,570
Take him upstairs
and check his vitals every hour.

146
00:16:53,528 --> 00:16:57,259
<i>Now that's, I think, the context
in which to view what's going on.</i>

147
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:08,207
<i>Perhaps you may have seen a lead story
in The New York Times.</i>

148
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:19,048
Good morning, Dr. Lorenson.

149
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,057
You're the cop killer, right?

150
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:33,061
- That obvious, huh?
- TV, you know?

151
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:36,203
Helps soothe an active mind.

152
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:40,733
I'm Rudy Mackenzie. Welcome.

153
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,070
Listen, I...

154
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:47,506
- I don't really feel like talking.
- You know, that's a shame.

155
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,776
I don't believe
in disposable language either.

156
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:52,614
You know, small talk, little talk,
chitchat. Useless.

157
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:55,415
The game.
The game's something else, though.

158
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:01,757
This here is our court.
I'm ready to throw the ball. Come on.

159
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,262
All right.

160
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:07,261
What are you in here for?

161
00:18:09,704 --> 00:18:15,439
- I tried to kill my wife.
- Don't you go to jail for that?

162
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:20,275
Yeah, well, I tried, like, 30 times.
I never planned on doing it, you know?

163
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:23,009
It was always
in the heat of the moment.

164
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:27,679
And she kept threatening
to have me put away until finally...

165
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:30,085
...she did.

166
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:35,426
- Thirty times might make you seem crazy.
- Yeah, or just... Or just plain stupid.

167
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:40,159
Because you'd think by the 20th time,
I would've found an alternative method...

168
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:45,432
...or maybe a more effective one.
- Morning, gentlemen. How you doing today?

169
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:48,872
For me that is a really
difficult question, Dr. Lorenson...

170
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:53,105
...because the world around me is shrinking,
and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse...

171
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:56,307
...are coming to see me today,
and they're not bringing flowers...

172
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:59,784
...which just makes it really difficult
to get organized.

173
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:04,726
And you, Mr. Starks?

174
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,691
- I'm fine.
- So you're okay?

175
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:11,729
You tell me, doc.

176
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:15,967
You think there's
something wrong with me?

177
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:18,731
You're a little underweight.

178
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:22,405
Maybe I'm working it off in my dreams.

179
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:27,009
Done with the small talk?

180
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,082
Hey, it's okay.

181
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:51,795
Mr. Starks, glad to see
you're cooperating this time.

182
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:55,465
We're here to help, Jack.
We're only doing what's best for you.

183
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:03,114
Hold him while I get the tranquilizer.

184
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,309
- Get him down. Fuck the tranquilizer.
- No.

185
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:09,180
No, that's not necessary. Get him up.

186
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,728
Nurse, get the jacket.

187
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:17,730
The only thing
your mind's missing's a conscience.

188
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:23,001
Wait. Dr. Becker, how long
do you want us to leave him in for?

189
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:24,569
Just strap him in for now.

190
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:43,718
Help. Help, please.

191
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,484
Motherfucker.

192
00:20:50,164 --> 00:20:52,291
Let me out of here.

193
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:54,526
Let me out of here.

194
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:56,671
Let me out of here.

195
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:03,400
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

196
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:10,744
- Listen, I hate to bother you.
- Then don't.

197
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,784
But what about Starks?

198
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:16,053
What about Starks?

199
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,958
Should we be just...?

200
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,823
Should we be trying to help him
any way we can?

201
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:24,521
- Yes.
- Should we be leaving him in there like that?

202
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,192
The medication I've given him
is intended to adjust...

203
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:34,468
...maybe even reset, his violent proclivities.
Peel away some layers of hate.

204
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:37,270
The apparatus is merely
a safe place for that to happen.

205
00:21:37,445 --> 00:21:42,348
The grounds and the halls, where I can't
monitor side effects I can't predict, aren't.

206
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:45,486
But how can you be monitoring
the effects while he's in there?

207
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:49,420
I consider the time he's spent
in there part of the treatment.

208
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,391
You can't break something
that's already broken.

209
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:22,188
I don't belong here.

210
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,253
I can't breathe in here.

211
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,260
I can't breathe in here.

212
00:22:30,865 --> 00:22:32,696
I can't...

213
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:40,766
I can't breathe in here.

214
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:49,772
<i>I'm gonna blow your head off.</i>

215
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,018
In case you hadn't figured,
it's Christmas Eve.

216
00:24:08,195 --> 00:24:10,528
You're never gonna get a cab here.

217
00:24:10,932 --> 00:24:12,593
Thanks.

218
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:15,269
You got somewhere
you need to go?

219
00:24:17,939 --> 00:24:19,269
I'm not sure.

220
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,001
Well, let me ask you that again.

221
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:25,169
This time, look around
and consider your options.

222
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:29,641
Have you got somewhere
you need to go?

223
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,053
Yeah, I do.

224
00:24:33,654 --> 00:24:36,488
Well, great. Get in.

225
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:44,661
So where can I take you?

226
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,497
I don't know.

227
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:51,161
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

228
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:54,836
Okay.

229
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:05,242
Well, there must be
another shelter I can call.

230
00:25:07,788 --> 00:25:11,748
Yeah, well, thanks a lot.
Merry Christmas to you too.

231
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:13,587
Great.

232
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:16,252
That was our last option.

233
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:21,424
What am I gonna do with you?

234
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:23,698
Nothing.

235
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,501
I'll...

236
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,141
- Listen, thanks for bringing me this far.
- Where are you going?

237
00:25:32,646 --> 00:25:35,047
You'll freeze out there.
You don't even have a coat.

238
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,413
- I'll manage.
- No, you won't.

239
00:25:39,854 --> 00:25:43,983
You'll die of cold,
and then I'll have to feel guilty.

240
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,151
And I've already got more guilt
than I know what to do with.

241
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:49,319
You want a drink?

242
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:51,327
No, I'm okay.

243
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,034
Shit.

244
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:20,587
Hey.

245
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,721
You okay?

246
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:27,201
Yeah. I'm fine.

247
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:39,377
You know what?

248
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:43,646
It's Christmas Eve and...

249
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:50,857
And I have a couch,
so you can stay on it.

250
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:52,624
I'm gonna go take a bath.

251
00:26:53,728 --> 00:26:56,560
Fix yourself something to eat
if you're hungry or anything.

252
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:00,064
There's nothing to steal, but don't be
a jerk and take something anyway.

253
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:02,464
No. I wouldn't.

254
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:07,332
- My name is Jack.
- No.

255
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:10,239
Let's not do the name thing,
because it's...

256
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:12,912
I don't wanna meet you.

257
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,142
I may wanna help you tonight,
but I don't wanna know you, really.

258
00:27:20,821 --> 00:27:22,049
Okay.

259
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:34,259
What's this?

260
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:39,792
Best I could do
with what was in the fridge.

261
00:28:48,343 --> 00:28:50,003
Thanks.

262
00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:54,244
No problem.

263
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:02,980
- You want a drink?
- Yeah, sure.

264
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:31,910
It was pretty good, considering.

265
00:29:36,156 --> 00:29:41,151
Your fridge has quite an array of things.

266
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,387
Not a lot of food, but...

267
00:29:44,566 --> 00:29:46,692
- Freezer has a rock in it.
- What rock?

268
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:51,066
There was a stone in it. It said "petal. "

269
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:53,268
That's snooping.

270
00:30:00,414 --> 00:30:03,612
It was my mom's senseless idea
of a nickname.

271
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,146
It's...

272
00:30:09,757 --> 00:30:13,214
So you're a waitress. I mean...

273
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:16,724
I don't know what I mean.

274
00:30:17,164 --> 00:30:18,826
Okay.

275
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:41,951
I hate Christmas.

276
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:43,538
Hey.

277
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,769
Hey, wake up. Jackie.

278
00:32:46,346 --> 00:32:48,076
- No.
- Who are these people?

279
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:51,740
- What?
- Who are the people in this picture?

280
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,250
That's my mom and me.

281
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:56,655
- What do you mean, your mom and...?
- No, wait a minute.

282
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:59,816
- Where's your mother now?
- My mom is dead.

283
00:32:59,993 --> 00:33:04,327
- What do you mean, she's dead?
- I mean, she's dead. Dead. Gone.

284
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:08,595
She passed out with a cigarette and
burned to death a long time ago, all right?

285
00:33:08,935 --> 00:33:10,767
No, no, no...

286
00:33:11,338 --> 00:33:13,807
Listen, I'm sorry. Listen.

287
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:17,609
I don't know how...

288
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:20,843
- What's the date today?
- What?

289
00:33:21,148 --> 00:33:23,048
I know this sounds crazy.

290
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:25,980
What year is this?

291
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:28,115
2007.

292
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:31,853
What? What?

293
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:35,492
Who the hell are you?

294
00:33:38,231 --> 00:33:40,096
I'm Jack Starks.

295
00:33:41,635 --> 00:33:43,000
Get the fuck out of my house.

296
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:45,699
- What'd you do, snoop all over the place?
- No.

297
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:49,673
God, you had no right.
You had no right to go through anything.

298
00:33:50,377 --> 00:33:51,742
Look at me.

299
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:55,848
I know this doesn't make any sense,
because it doesn't make sense to me either.

300
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:59,111
Oh, my God. If you don't get out now,
I'm gonna call the cops.

301
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:03,383
No, please. Please, wait.
I won't hurt you. Just talk to me, please.

302
00:34:03,557 --> 00:34:08,427
L... Your mom was passed out
on the side of the road when I met you.

303
00:34:08,596 --> 00:34:11,530
She was wasted.
Jean, her name was Jean.

304
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:16,226
- Just stop it!
- Look, I gave this kid those dog tags.

305
00:34:16,403 --> 00:34:20,271
No, no. No, you didn't.

306
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,309
Jack Starks did,
and Jack Starks is dead.

307
00:34:25,012 --> 00:34:26,842
What?

308
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:28,878
What do you mean, he's?

309
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,641
He's dead.

310
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:36,847
His body was found New Year's Day, 1993,
Alpine Grove.

311
00:34:37,023 --> 00:34:38,514
He's dead.

312
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:43,188
- It can't be.
- Well, it is.

313
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:49,097
Listen, listen. I don't care who
or where you think you are...

314
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:50,793
...you're not Jack Starks.

315
00:34:50,972 --> 00:34:55,534
So whoever you are, I did a nice thing...
I did a really nice thing, and you've really...

316
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,577
God, you've really made me regret it,
so please, please, would you?

317
00:34:59,746 --> 00:35:01,543
Would you just leave? Okay?

318
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:03,541
Don't you remember me?

319
00:35:03,717 --> 00:35:05,844
- Oh, my God.
- Look at me.

320
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:10,581
I'll leave, okay, I'll leave, but look at me.
I'm not lying to you.

321
00:35:10,757 --> 00:35:17,128
I met you. I met you and your mother,
and there was no one around for miles.

322
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:21,860
I couldn't have known that from a pair
of dog tags you had lying around.

323
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,030
You put those down, and you get out.

324
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:31,606
Don't you remember me?

325
00:35:31,778 --> 00:35:36,614
- Don't you know? I'm...
- You get out!

326
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:40,313
I'm...

327
00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:42,422
Okay?

328
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,123
Please.

329
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:54,461
Please get out.

330
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:16,463
<i>I'm gonna blow your head off!</i>

331
00:36:21,478 --> 00:36:23,945
<i>Jackie.</i>

332
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:26,510
Oh, God.

333
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,313
I can't believe you left him in all night.

334
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:35,253
You didn't say anything when I asked...

335
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:39,192
I expected some common sense
on your part. Open the drawer.

336
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,233
Is he dead?

337
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,512
No. Get him upstairs immediately.
He's dehydrated.

338
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,806
I want him on an IV
by the time I get up there.

339
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:01,349
I tried to tell you
when I came to your office...

340
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:03,849
I expected you to take him out.

341
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:08,981
You're a physician. I shouldn't have
to spell everything out for you.

342
00:37:19,268 --> 00:37:20,702
Jack?

343
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,235
Jack?

344
00:37:29,346 --> 00:37:31,313
Tom.

345
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:35,918
Tom, can I speak with you
for a moment, please?

346
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:44,023
- What have you done with Jack Starks?
- What do you mean?

347
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:47,391
- He's unconscious.
- He's recovering from Loxadol and Ativan.

348
00:37:47,563 --> 00:37:50,726
Loxadol? He didn't need neuroleptics.

349
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,268
You know that from what, a couple
of two-minute stares across the room?

350
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,235
He didn't need antipsychotics,
if that's all you gave him.

351
00:37:57,407 --> 00:38:00,775
After he attacked me,
I figured he'd need a little placating.

352
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:02,934
You sure he wasn't provoked?

353
00:38:03,112 --> 00:38:05,603
Are you sure you wanna make
an accusation like that?

354
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:10,751
I'm not making any accusations.
He's bruised up.

355
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,184
Happens sometimes
when you gotta restrain them.

356
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:15,951
Listen to me.
He is not gonna end up like Ted Casey.

357
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:19,094
I don't know what you're trying to do,
but he's not a lab animal.

358
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:22,027
You can't reprogram them,
no matter what cocktail of drugs...

359
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:25,929
You really don't let up, do you?
Just because you failed Ted Casey...

360
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,730
...doesn't mean the rest of us did.

361
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:32,400
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's Christmas, remember?

362
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:52,085
Hi, how are you? Sorry I'm late.

363
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:58,592
- Hi, Babak.
- That's a nice wave.

364
00:38:59,268 --> 00:39:01,099
- Hey, Jamile.
- Hey.

365
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:07,568
Okay, that's great. That was the truck.
Now point to the ball.

366
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:14,179
Very good.

367
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:19,378
Wanna hold it? Feels nice. Strong.

368
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:29,358
I need you to stay with me
for just a little while more, okay?

369
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:40,599
We'll get there.

370
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,012
<i>Could I have some water?</i>

371
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:48,445
Could I have some water?
I have some water?

372
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,746
Here you go.

373
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,862
What the hell kind of drugs
are you people giving me?

374
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,556
Just something to keep you calm.

375
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,797
Did you just say something?

376
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,000
I said, the drugs are to keep you calm.

377
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:15,907
Did you sleep well?

378
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:22,809
- I wasn't asleep, was I?
- You were asleep for nearly a whole day.

379
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:27,047
It's December 26th, Jack.
How are you feeling?

380
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,521
- December 26th?
- That's right.

381
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,853
- 1992?
- Yes.

382
00:40:32,028 --> 00:40:34,862
And that's the sun, and you're on Earth.

383
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:38,297
And I know you know better, Jack.

384
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:42,737
<i>Who the hell are you?
My mom is dead. 2007.</i>

385
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,373
<i>Jack Starks is dead.</i>

386
00:40:45,775 --> 00:40:47,902
<i>Get out of here, get out!</i>

387
00:40:48,077 --> 00:40:50,443
- You left me in there.
- In where?

388
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:55,016
You left me in that thing. In the drawer.
And then...

389
00:40:55,184 --> 00:40:57,016
...you put me in a straitjacket.

390
00:40:57,554 --> 00:41:00,784
We were forced to use restraints,
if that's what you're referring to.

391
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:05,519
- It wasn't a fucking restraint.
- That's exactly what our equipment is.

392
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,096
Relax.

393
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:13,927
Don't act like I don't know what's real.

394
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,400
You're suffering from delusions
as part of your condition.

395
00:41:18,574 --> 00:41:20,099
No, I know what's real, I know.

396
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:24,007
You strapped me into something
and stuffed me in a fucking drawer.

397
00:41:25,748 --> 00:41:27,717
It wasn't a dream.

398
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,648
I don't know what you're trying to pull,
but I wasn't...

399
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,050
I have to say...

400
00:41:33,222 --> 00:41:37,523
...this is the most resilient I've seen
a patient undergoing this treatment.

401
00:41:37,693 --> 00:41:41,322
I had a patient a few years ago.
His name was Ted Casey.

402
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,967
Ted sodomized a 7-year-old girl.

403
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:51,063
His lawyers asked me to have a look at him
because after his deeds were done...

404
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,699
...he climbed into the trees
of the forest where he killed her...

405
00:41:54,878 --> 00:41:56,277
...and howled like a dog.

406
00:41:56,445 --> 00:42:02,146
Ted never went to prison because everyone,
including me, believed he was sick.

407
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:07,347
So he came here. Then one day a little girl
came with her mother to visit her relative...

408
00:42:07,523 --> 00:42:10,458
...and I caught Ted stealing looks at her.

409
00:42:10,994 --> 00:42:14,952
The kind you really have to steal,
if you know what I mean.

410
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,860
I asked Ted then...

411
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:24,201
...if he could remember what the little girl
who he'd slain was wearing.

412
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:28,208
"Oh, yes," he said. "I remember it.

413
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:31,710
I remember it well. "

414
00:42:32,548 --> 00:42:35,039
Those were actually his last words.

415
00:42:38,288 --> 00:42:40,380
What happened to your face?

416
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:46,155
I was careless. It won't happen again.

417
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:49,231
I'll say a prayer for you, Jack.

418
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,056
Maybe God will pick up
where the medicine leaves off.

419
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:56,329
You sure you know where to find him?

420
00:44:14,951 --> 00:44:16,577
Jack.

421
00:44:16,753 --> 00:44:18,583
What are you doing, Jack?

422
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:20,052
What are you gonna do to me?

423
00:44:20,222 --> 00:44:23,681
I thought I'd just ask you
to come inside with me.

424
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:28,887
- What if I didn't want to come?
- Well, I'd probably ask you why.

425
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:31,034
Because I'm not crazy.

426
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:35,159
You suffer from a delusional disorder.
It doesn't mean you're crazy.

427
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:37,396
It just means you're confused.

428
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,974
You're here instead of jail because
your condition...

429
00:44:40,143 --> 00:44:44,670
...played a role in your crime.
- I didn't kill that cop, but I don't remember.

430
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:48,614
Your mind's ability to distinguish
between your fantasies...

431
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:50,650
...and the real events that happened...

432
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:56,418
The real events that have happened to me
have been fucked up, not my mind.

433
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:01,090
Jack.

434
00:45:03,266 --> 00:45:05,166
I'd like to ask you a question, if I may.

435
00:45:05,601 --> 00:45:08,503
Since when do people around here
start asking for things?

436
00:45:09,505 --> 00:45:12,998
- Okay. Smoke?
- That's what you wanna ask?

437
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:17,112
No.

438
00:45:20,182 --> 00:45:21,672
I wanted...

439
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:26,315
I wanted to ask you how your treatments
with Dr. Becker are progressing.

440
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:29,715
Fine. Fine.

441
00:45:30,126 --> 00:45:32,856
I hope you'd tell me
if that wasn't the case.

442
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:38,163
Why? Why, what would you do?
What would you do?

443
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:42,400
I would try to make it stop.

444
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:47,407
- I'm not sure I want him to stop.
- So it's helping?

445
00:45:50,012 --> 00:45:53,505
They're making me feel like
a different person.

446
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,235
You coming?

447
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,737
We're gonna freeze out here, you and I.

448
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:31,016
Could get hurt if they catch you
trying to leave again.

449
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:44,932
What do you know about the shit
they do to us in the basement?

450
00:46:46,168 --> 00:46:47,659
What shit?

451
00:46:47,836 --> 00:46:50,135
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No, I don't.

452
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:54,268
Yeah, you do. That jacket.

453
00:47:01,117 --> 00:47:02,777
- What jacket?
- The fucking drawer.

454
00:47:02,952 --> 00:47:05,887
Now, stop playing games,
you know what I'm talking about.

455
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:14,190
I know that they take you down there.
I know that they put you in it.

456
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:16,262
The rest of it, it's...

457
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,268
It's a trip, you know,
it's like a serious vacation.

458
00:47:22,137 --> 00:47:23,365
I found out I'm gonna die.

459
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:26,838
Well, mortality is actually
a great thing to be familiar with.

460
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,409
I'm gonna die in four days.

461
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:33,273
That's what I found out.
They find my body in four days.

462
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:37,344
What are you two yapping about?

463
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:43,521
We're talking about our ability
to go forward in time...

464
00:47:43,693 --> 00:47:45,320
...to go into the future.

465
00:47:48,864 --> 00:47:51,356
I mean, that's what
we're talking about, right?

466
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,331
Yeah, that's right.

467
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:08,806
If you need to find something out
when you're in there, just calm down.

468
00:48:08,985 --> 00:48:12,512
The less you freak,
the less you'll trip out.

469
00:48:12,688 --> 00:48:17,182
Yeah, but all this shit from before
just comes tumbling...

470
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,123
Yeah, but that shit is in the past.

471
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:23,322
Focus on what you need to get now.

472
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,130
- I gotta get back in there.
- That could be a problem.

473
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:30,068
- Why?
- Lorenson's got her claws into it now.

474
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:36,644
When she started getting suspicious of me
was when they stopped putting me in there.
