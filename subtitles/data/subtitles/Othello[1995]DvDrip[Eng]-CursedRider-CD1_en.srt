1
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:45,852
'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.

2
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:52,203
But who shall lead our business
against the Turkish fleet?

3
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,001
Othello.

4
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:58,167
Another of his fathom
we have none.

5
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,893
The fortitude of the place
is best known to him.

6
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:30,802
I take it much unkindly
that thou, lago...

7
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:33,925
...who hast had my purse
as if the strings were thine...

8
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:35,885
...shouldst know of this.

9
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:39,210
By the faith of man,
I know my price.

10
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:44,168
I am worth no worse a place.
But he, one Michael Cassio...

11
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:48,804
...a Florentine,
must his lieutenant be.

12
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:52,523
And I, of whom
his eyes had seen the proof...

13
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:57,011
God bless the mark!
- His Moorship's ensign.

14
00:03:57,213 --> 00:04:00,285
O by heaven, I rather
would have been his hangman.

15
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:05,009
Why, there's no remedy.
'Tis the curse of service.

16
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:09,292
I would not follow him then.

17
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:12,923
O, sir, content you.

18
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:16,728
I follow him
to serve my turn upon him.

19
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:21,643
We cannot all be masters, nor
all masters cannot be truly followed.

20
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:23,845
You shall mark...

21
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:28,445
...heaven is my judge,
not I for love and duty...

22
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:32,566
...but seeming so for my peculiar end.

23
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,482
I am not what I am.

24
00:04:38,573 --> 00:04:43,328
What a full fortune does the
thick-lips owe, if he can carry it thus.

25
00:04:45,093 --> 00:04:47,732
Call up her father.

26
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:03,643
Awake! Thieves! Signor!

27
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:07,289
Thieves! Look to your house,
your daughter and your bags!

28
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:09,285
Signor Brabantio! Ho!

29
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:10,842
- Awake!
- Sir!

30
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:14,409
Thieves! Look to your house,
your daughter and your bags!

31
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:17,173
Thieves! Thieves!

32
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:20,522
What is the reason
of this terrible summons?

33
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,724
What is the matter here?

34
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:27,962
Signor...

35
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:30,688
...is all your family within?

36
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:33,282
I know you, Roderigo...

37
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:37,085
...and have charged thee
not to haunt about my doors.

38
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:39,682
In honest plainness,
thou has heard me say...

39
00:05:39,893 --> 00:05:41,929
...my daughter is not for thee.

40
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:44,163
Are your doors locked?

41
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:47,209
Why? Wherefore ask you this?

42
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,246
Even now, now, very now...

43
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:53,644
...an old black ram
is tupping your white ewe.

44
00:05:54,173 --> 00:05:56,243
What profane wretch art thou?

45
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:58,045
I am one
that comes to tell you...

46
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:01,250
...your daughter and the Moor are
making the beast with two backs.

47
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:04,723
- Thou art a villain!
- You are a senator.

48
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,041
This thou shalt answer, Roderigo.

49
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:09,288
Ay, sir!

50
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:11,371
I will answer anything.

51
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:14,286
But I beseech you,
straight satisfy yourself:

52
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:17,767
If she be in her chamber
or your house...

53
00:06:17,973 --> 00:06:22,285
...let loose on me the justice
of the state for thus deluding you.

54
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:26,570
Strike on the tinder, ho!

55
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:29,770
Give me a taper!
Call up all my people!

56
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:35,090
This accident is not unlike my dream.

57
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:37,724
Belief of it oppresses me already.

58
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,251
Light, I say!

59
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:41,772
Light!

60
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:45,683
Get weapons, ho!

61
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:49,770
Farewell, for I must leave you.

62
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,005
The goodness of the night
upon you, friends.

63
00:07:12,413 --> 00:07:15,530
I pray you, sir,
are you fast married?

64
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,725
Sir, you've been hotly called for.

65
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,607
Have with you.

66
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:39,685
- Halt!
- You!

67
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:45,601
Keep up your bright swords,
for the dew will rust them.

68
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,772
O, thou foul thief!

69
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:52,089
Where hast thou stowed my daughter?

70
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,807
Damned as thou art,
thou hast enchanted her...

71
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:59,689
...to run from her garden to the sooty
bosom of such a thing as thou.

72
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:06,691
Lay hold upon him.

73
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:08,565
Hold your hands...

74
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:11,282
...both you of my inclining
and the rest.

75
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:17,683
Were it my cue to fight, I should have
known it without a prompter.

76
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:20,972
Good signor...

77
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:24,293
...where will you that I go
to answer this, your charge?

78
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:25,522
To prison...

79
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:28,924
...till fit time of law and course of
direct session call thee to answer.

80
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,044
What if I do obey?

81
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:33,761
How may the Duke
be therewith satisfied...

82
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:38,245
...whose messengers are
here about my side to bring me to him?

83
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:40,165
'Tis true, most worthy signor.

84
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,325
The Duke's in council, and your
noble self, surely, is sent for.

85
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:46,525
How? The Duke in council?
In this time of night?

86
00:08:47,373 --> 00:08:48,647
Bring him away.

87
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:11,251
Valiant Othello...

88
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:15,208
...we must straight employ you
against the general Turkish foe.

89
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:18,092
Welcome, gentle signor.

90
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:21,091
We lacked your counsel
and your help tonight.

91
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:22,726
So did I yours.

92
00:09:23,253 --> 00:09:24,811
Good Your Grace, pardon me.

93
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:27,407
Neither my place,
nor aught I heard of business...

94
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:29,649
...has raised me from my bed.

95
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:31,761
My daughter!

96
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,641
- O, my daughter!
- Dead?

97
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:39,362
She is abused,
stolen from me and corrupted.

98
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:44,523
For nature so preposterously to err,
sans witchcraft could not.

99
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,972
Whoever he be
that in this foul proceeding...

100
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:53,888
...hath thus beguiled your daughter
of herself, and you of her...

101
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:57,683
...the bloody book of law you
shall yourself read...

102
00:09:57,893 --> 00:10:01,852
...in the bitter letter after
your own sense.

103
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:06,411
Humbly, I thank Your Grace.

104
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:17,453
Here is the man.

105
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:23,201
Othello?

106
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:25,881
What in your own part can you
say to this?

107
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,482
Nothing, but this is so.

108
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:39,443
Most potent, grave
and reverend signors...

109
00:10:40,493 --> 00:10:43,690
...my very noble
and approved good masters...

110
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:47,771
...that I have taken away this
old man's daughter...

111
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:50,726
...'tis most true.
True, I have married her.

112
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:55,283
The very head and front of my offending
hath this extent, no more.

113
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:57,884
Rude am I in my speech...

114
00:10:58,093 --> 00:11:02,644
...and little blessed
with the soft phrase of peace.

115
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:05,845
For since these arms of mine
had seven years' pith...

116
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:07,930
...till now some nine moons wasted...

117
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,170
...they have used their dearest action
in the tented field.

118
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:14,126
And little of this great world
can I speak...

119
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,609
...more than pertains to feats
of broil and battle.

120
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:20,532
Therefore, little shall I
grace my cause...

121
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:24,772
...in speaking of myself.
Yet, by your gracious patience...

122
00:11:24,973 --> 00:11:29,012
...I will a round,
unvarnished tale deliver...

123
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:31,523
...of my whole course of love:

124
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,964
What drugs, what charms...

125
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:39,291
...what conjuration
and what mighty magic.

126
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:44,009
For such proceedings am I
charged withal, I won his daughter.

127
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:45,931
A maiden never bold...

128
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:49,603
...of spirit so still and quiet
that her motion blushed at herself...

129
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:52,162
...and she, in spite of nature,
to fall in love...

130
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,164
...with what she feared to look on!

131
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:56,284
I do beseech you, send for the lady...

132
00:11:56,493 --> 00:11:58,609
...and let her speak of me
before her father.

133
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:01,168
If you do find me foul in her report...

134
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:04,968
...the trust, the office I do hold
of you, not only take away...

135
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:08,609
...but let your sentence even
fall upon my life.

136
00:12:11,853 --> 00:12:13,286
Fetch Desdemona.

137
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:25,887
Her father loved me...

138
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,010
...oft invited me...

139
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:31,968
...still questioned me the story
of my life from year to year...

140
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:36,325
...the battles, sieges, fortunes
that I have passed.

141
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,728
Even from my boyish days...

142
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:40,611
...to the moment
he bade me tell it.

143
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:43,043
Wherein I spoke of
most disastrous chances...

144
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:45,522
...of moving accidents by
flood and field...

145
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,884
<i>... hair-breadth escapes
in the imminent deadly breach...</i>

146
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:52,005
<i>... of being taken by the insolent foe...</i>

147
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:54,607
<i>... and sold to slavery.</i>

148
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:57,281
<i>And of the cannibals that
each other eat...</i>

149
00:12:57,453 --> 00:12:59,171
<i>... the Anthropophagi...</i>

150
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:02,604
<i>... and men whose heads do grow
beneath their shoulders.</i>

151
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:06,044
<i>These things to hear
would Desdemona seriously incline.</i>

152
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:10,963
<i>And with a greedy ear
devour up my discourse...</i>

153
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:13,090
<i>... which I observing...</i>

154
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:15,523
<i>... took once a pliant hour...</i>

155
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:18,884
<i>... and found means to draw
from her a prayer of earnest heart...</i>

156
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:21,613
<i>... which I would
all my pilgrimage dilate.</i>

157
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:24,811
<i>She gave me for my pains...</i>

158
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:28,044
<i>... a world of sighs.</i>

159
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:31,404
<i>She swore, in faith, 'twas strange...</i>

160
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:34,764
<i>... 'twas passing strange,
'twas pitiful...</i>

161
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:36,964
<i>... 'twas wondrous pitiful.</i>

162
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:42,887
<i>She loved me
for the dangers I had passed...</i>

163
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:45,926
...and I loved her
that she did pity them.

164
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:50,450
This only is
the witchcraft I have used.

165
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:05,572
Come hither, gentle mistress.

166
00:14:07,453 --> 00:14:12,129
Do you perceive in all this company
where most you owe obedience?

167
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:16,689
My noble father...

168
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:21,127
...to you I am bound
for life and education.

169
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:26,289
My life and education both
do learn me how to respect you.

170
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:29,291
You are lord of all my duty.

171
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:32,163
I am hitherto your daughter.

172
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,329
But here's my husband.

173
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:41,682
And so much duty
as my mother showed to you...

174
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:44,123
...preferring you before her father...

175
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:48,531
...so much I challenge
that I may profess due to the Moor...

176
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,246
...my lord.

177
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:59,686
God by you! I have done.

178
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:05,366
I had rather to adopt a child
than get it.

179
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:09,491
Come hither, Moor.

180
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:16,492
I here do give thee that
with all my heart...

181
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:19,167
...which, but thou hast already...

182
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:24,083
...with all my heart I would
keep from thee.

183
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:40,005
I humbly beseech you,
proceed with the affairs of state.

184
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:50,443
The Turk, with a mighty preparation,
makes for Cyprus.

185
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:51,887
Othello...

186
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:54,210
...you must away tonight.

187
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:57,769
The affair cries haste,
and speed must answer it.

188
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:01,248
Most gracious Duke...

189
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:11,371
What would you, Desdemona?

190
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:16,807
That I did love the Moor
to live with him...

191
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:20,445
...my downright violence
and scorn of fortunes...

192
00:16:20,653 --> 00:16:22,644
...may trumpet to the world.

193
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:28,003
My heart is subdued even to
the utmost pleasure of my lord.

194
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:34,803
I saw Othello's visage in his mind...

195
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:38,328
...and to his honors
and his valiant parts...

196
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:41,730
...did I my soul
and fortunes consecrate.

197
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:46,690
So that, dear lords...

198
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:51,606
...if I be left behind, a moth of peace,
and he go to the war...

199
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:55,010
...the rites for which I love him
are bereft me.

200
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:58,569
And I, a heavy interim,
shall support by his dear absence.

201
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:00,325
Let me go with him.

202
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:02,570
Let her have your voice.

203
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:04,530
And heaven defend your good souls...

204
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:09,329
...that you think I will your serious
business scant for she is with me.

205
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:14,573
Be it as you shall privately determine.

206
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:20,131
At 9 in the morning,
here we'll meet again.

207
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:22,369
Good night to everyone.

208
00:17:23,773 --> 00:17:26,685
And, noble signor...

209
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:31,847
...if virtue no delighted beauty lack...

210
00:17:32,013 --> 00:17:36,564
...your son-in-law
is far more fair than black.

211
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:45,288
Look to her, Moor,
if thou hast eyes to see.

212
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:50,051
She has deceived her father
and may thee.

213
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:53,443
My life upon her faith!

214
00:17:57,013 --> 00:18:00,210
Good lago, my Desdemona
must I leave to thee.

215
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:04,201
Let thy wife attend on her, and bring
them after in the best advantage.

216
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:06,802
Come, we must obey the time.

217
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:19,162
Lago!

218
00:18:22,613 --> 00:18:24,729
What sayest thou, noble heart?

219
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:30,203
What will I do, thinkest thou?

220
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,331
Why, go to bed and sleep.

221
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:35,568
I will incontinently drown myself.

222
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:38,930
If thou dost,
I shall never love thee after.

223
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:41,328
Why, thou silly gentleman!

224
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:46,248
It is silliness to live
when to live is a torment.

225
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:48,771
Desdemona!

226
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:52,332
Villainous!

227
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:57,968
I've looked upon the world for
four times seven years...

228
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:01,682
...and I never yet found a man that
knew how to love himself.

229
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:05,602
Ere I would say I would drown myself
for the love of a guinea hen.

230
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:09,726
- I'd change my humanity with a baboon.
- What should I do?

231
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:12,602
I confess it is my shame
to be so fond...

232
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:14,963
...but it is not in my virtue
to amend it.

233
00:19:15,173 --> 00:19:16,526
Virtue? A fig.

234
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:18,963
'Tis in ourselves
that we are thus or thus.

235
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:21,971
We have reason
to cool our raging motions...

236
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:24,806
...our carnal stings, our
unbitted lusts...

237
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:28,130
...whereof I take this, which you call
love, to be a sect or scion.

238
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,448
It cannot be!

239
00:19:29,653 --> 00:19:33,362
It is merely a lust of the blood
and a permission of the will.

240
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:34,972
Come, be a man!

241
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,323
Drown thyself?

242
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:40,691
Drown cats and blind puppies.

243
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:45,526
I have professed me thy friend
and I confess me...

244
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:48,491
...knit to thy deserving with cables
of perdurable toughness.

245
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:52,089
I could never
better stead thee than now.

246
00:19:56,693 --> 00:19:58,524
Put money in thy purse.

247
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,610
Follow thou these wars.

248
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:06,608
Disguise thy features with
an usurped beard.

249
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:08,445
I say, put money in thy purse.

250
00:20:08,653 --> 00:20:12,202
It cannot be that Desdemona should
long continue her love to the Moor.

251
00:20:12,413 --> 00:20:14,290
Put but money in thy purse.

252
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:17,570
When she's sated with his body,
she'll find the error of her choice.

253
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:20,088
She must have change, she must.

254
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:22,689
Fill thy purse with money.

255
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:26,727
If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
an erring barbarian...

256
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:30,369
...and a super-subtle Venetian
be not too hard for my wits...

257
00:20:30,573 --> 00:20:32,131
...and all the tribe of hell...

258
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,291
...thou shall enjoy her.

259
00:20:35,493 --> 00:20:37,529
Therefore, put...

260
00:20:38,293 --> 00:20:40,090
"Money in thy purse."

261
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:43,609
A pox on drowning, huh?

262
00:20:43,813 --> 00:20:45,166
'Tis clean out of the way.

263
00:20:45,373 --> 00:20:47,967
Seek thou rather to be hanged
in compassing thy joy...

264
00:20:48,173 --> 00:20:50,482
...than to be drowned
and go without her.

265
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:57,647
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes?

266
00:20:57,853 --> 00:21:00,321
Thou art sure of me.

267
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:04,890
There are many events in
the womb of time...

268
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,724
...which will be delivered.

269
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:11,210
Go, provide thy money.

270
00:21:11,613 --> 00:21:13,808
We will have more of this tomorrow.
Adieu.

271
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:15,890
Where shall we meet in the morning?

272
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:18,927
- At my lodging.
- All right.

273
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:21,848
- I'll be with thee betimes.
- Go to, farewell.

274
00:21:22,053 --> 00:21:24,328
- Does thou hear?
- What say thou?

275
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,484
No more of drowning, do you hear?

276
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:27,642
I am changed.

277
00:21:31,653 --> 00:21:34,121
Go to, farewell.
Put money enough in your purse!

278
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,124
I'll sell all my land.

279
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:41,566
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.

280
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:44,367
For I mine own gained knowledge
should profane...

281
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:47,252
...if I would time
expend with such a snipe...

282
00:21:47,453 --> 00:21:49,842
...but for my sport and profit.

283
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:59,528
I hate the Moor...

284
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:03,886
...and it is thought abroad that
'twixt my sheets...

285
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:08,251
...he's done my office.

286
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:10,526
I know not if it be true...

287
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:14,772
...but I, for mere suspicion
in that kind...

288
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:20,243
...will do as if for surety.

289
00:22:23,213 --> 00:22:25,010
He holds me well...

290
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:30,092
...the better shall my purpose
work on him.

291
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:35,252
Cassio's a proper man.

292
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:39,162
Let me see now...
To get his place...

293
00:22:39,373 --> 00:22:44,049
...and to plume up my will
in double knavery...

294
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:45,968
How?

295
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:50,007
How?

296
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:01,006
I have it.

297
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,168
It is engendered.

298
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:07,201
Hell and night...

299
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:11,645
...must bring this monstrous birth
to the worlïs light.

300
00:24:25,773 --> 00:24:28,765
- Hail to thee, lady.
- Thank you, valiant Cassio.

301
00:24:38,653 --> 00:24:41,804
Very good.
Ay, well said, whisper.

302
00:24:43,973 --> 00:24:46,328
With as little a web as this,
will I ensnare...

303
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:50,321
...as great a fly as Cassio.

304
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:12,246
O, my fair warrior!

305
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,492
My dear Othello!

306
00:25:15,853 --> 00:25:20,244
It gives me wonder great as my content
to see you here before me.

307
00:25:26,413 --> 00:25:28,722
O my soul's joy!

308
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:32,449
I cannot speak enough of this content.
It stops me here.

309
00:25:32,653 --> 00:25:35,087
It is too much of joy.

310
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:46,012
News, friends:

311
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:49,046
Our wars are done,
the Turks are drowned!

312
00:25:53,573 --> 00:25:56,087
This desperate storm
hath seen a grievous wrack...

313
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,602
...and sufferance
on most part of their fleet.

314
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:00,206
Worthy Montano.

315
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:03,566
How does my old acquaintance
of this isle?

316
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:06,162
Honey, you shall be
well desired in Cyprus.

317
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:08,682
I have found great love amongst them.

318
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:12,445
<i>O, you are well tuned now!</i>

319
00:26:12,653 --> 00:26:17,329
<i>But I'll set down the pegs that
make this music, as honest as I am.</i>

320
00:27:33,973 --> 00:27:37,329
If thou be'st valiant... As they say
base men being in love have then...

321
00:27:37,493 --> 00:27:41,247
...a nobility in their nature
more than is native to them... . List me.

322
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:45,004
The lieutenant tonight watches
on the court of guard.

323
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,569
First, I must tell thee this:

324
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,572
Desdemona is directly in love with him.

325
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:52,485
With Cassio?

326
00:27:53,573 --> 00:27:54,688
Why, 'tis not possible!

327
00:27:54,893 --> 00:27:57,487
Lay thy finger thus,
and let thy soul be instructed.

328
00:27:57,693 --> 00:27:59,445
Mark me. Her eye must be fed.

329
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:01,843
What delight shall she have
to look on the devil?

330
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,732
Her delicate tenderness has
found itself abused...

331
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,926
<i>... begun to heave the gorge,
disrelish and abhor the Moor.</i>

332
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:12,330
<i>Her nature instructs her to it,
and compels her to some second choice.</i>

333
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:15,809
<i>I cannot believe that.
She is full of most blessed condition.</i>

334
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:17,492
<i>Blessed fig's-end!</i>

335
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:19,924
<i>The wine she drinks is made of grapes.</i>

336
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:23,922
<i>If she were blessed, she would never
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding.</i>

337
00:28:24,213 --> 00:28:26,602
<i>Didst thou not see her paddle
with his hand?</i>

338
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:28,092
<i>Didst thou not mark that?</i>

339
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:31,603
- But that was but courtesy.
- Lechery, by this hand...

340
00:28:33,493 --> 00:28:35,563
...an index and obscure prologue...

341
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:38,207
...to the history
of lust and foul thoughts.

342
00:28:38,413 --> 00:28:41,803
They met so near with their lips
that their breaths embraced together.

343
00:28:41,973 --> 00:28:43,611
Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!

344
00:28:43,813 --> 00:28:46,452
When these mutualities
so marshal the way...

345
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:48,484
...hard at hand comes the master...

346
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,127
...and main exercise,
the incorporate conclusion.

347
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:54,769
But sir, be you ruled by me.
I have brought you from Venice.

348
00:28:57,813 --> 00:28:59,769
Watch you with the guard tonight...

349
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:03,249
...for the command I'll lay it upon you.
I'll not be far from you.

350
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:07,965
Do you find some occasion
to anger Cassio?

351
00:29:09,773 --> 00:29:10,762
Well...

352
00:29:18,253 --> 00:29:20,209
Welcome, lago.
We must to the watch.

353
00:29:20,373 --> 00:29:23,445
Not this hour, lieutenant.
'Tis not yet 10 of the clock.

354
00:29:23,613 --> 00:29:26,491
Our general cast us thus early for
the love of his Desdemona...

355
00:29:26,653 --> 00:29:28,371
...who let us not therefore blame.

356
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,125
He hath not yet...

357
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:33,803
...made wanton the night with her,
and she is sport for Jove.

358
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:35,605
She's a most exquisite lady.

359
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:38,771
And I'll warrant her, full of game.

360
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:41,970
- She is indeed perfection.
- Well...

361
00:29:42,173 --> 00:29:43,686
...happiness to their sheets!

362
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:45,372
Come, I have a stoop of wine...

363
00:29:45,573 --> 00:29:47,848
...and here without are
a brace of Cyprus gallants...

364
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,044
...that would have a measure to
the health of black Othello.

365
00:29:50,253 --> 00:29:51,606
Not tonight, good lago.

366
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:53,843
I have very poor and unhappy
brains for drinking.

367
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:56,243
I could well wish courtesy
would invent...

368
00:29:56,453 --> 00:29:58,569
...some other custom of entertainment.

369
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:02,283
They are our friends.

370
00:30:03,453 --> 00:30:05,284
But one cup? I'll drink for you.

371
00:30:05,493 --> 00:30:08,929
I have drunk a cup already and dare
not task my weakness with anymore.

372
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:11,601
What, man! 'Tis a night of revels.

373
00:30:11,813 --> 00:30:13,883
The gallants desire it.

374
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:17,606
Where are they?

375
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:24,211
If I can fasten
but one cup upon him...

376
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:00,725
The purchase made...

377
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:04,088
...the fruits are to ensue...

378
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:08,687
...that profis yet to come
between me and you.

379
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:29,204
Is your Englishman so expert
in his drinking?

380
00:32:29,413 --> 00:32:32,246
Why, he drinks you with facility,
your Dane dead drunk.

381
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:34,489
He sweats not to overthrow your Almain.

382
00:32:34,693 --> 00:32:38,402
And he gives your Hollander a vomit
ere the next pottle can be filled.

383
00:32:38,613 --> 00:32:39,932
Health to our general!

384
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:42,283
I am for it, lieutenant...

385
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:45,004
...and I'll do you justice.

386
00:33:00,293 --> 00:33:01,487
Sweet England!

387
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:10,291
Save you, friend Cassio.

388
00:33:10,453 --> 00:33:12,808
Well, how is it with you, most fair?

389
00:33:16,373 --> 00:33:17,488
Bianca.

390
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:22,486
Let be gallantly!

391
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:29,282
<i>He was a wight of high renown</i>

392
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:33,009
<i>And thou art but of low degree</i>

393
00:33:34,453 --> 00:33:38,765
<i>'Tis pride that pulls the country down</i>

394
00:33:39,693 --> 00:33:42,844
<i>Then take thine auld cloak...</i>

395
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:45,521
<i>... about thee</i>

396
00:33:50,573 --> 00:33:52,370
Les have no more of this.

397
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,046
Les to our affairs.

398
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:57,369
God forgive us our sins.

399
00:33:57,813 --> 00:34:00,805
Gentlemen, les look to our business.

400
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:05,372
Do not think, gentlemen,
that I am drunk.

401
00:34:06,173 --> 00:34:08,323
This is my ensign.

402
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:10,205
This is my right hand.

403
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:12,572
This is my left hand.

404
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:15,889
I am not drunk now.

405
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,969
I can stand well enough...

406
00:34:19,213 --> 00:34:20,612
...and I speak well enough.

407
00:34:20,813 --> 00:34:22,451
- Excellent well.
- Why, very well.

408
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:26,923
You must not think then
that I am drunk.

409
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:34,012
To the platform, masters.
Come, les set the watch.

410
00:34:34,213 --> 00:34:36,408
You see this fellow that is gone before?

411
00:34:37,013 --> 00:34:40,972
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
and give direction.

412
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:43,323
And do but see his vice.

413
00:34:43,573 --> 00:34:45,370
But is he often thus?

414
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:48,846
'Tis evermore the prologue
to his sleep.

415
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,931
- Whas the matter, lieutenant?
- A knave teach me my duty!

416
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,169
I'll beat the knave
into a twiggen bottle.

417
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,893
- Beat me!
- Dost thou prate, rogue?

418
00:35:00,653 --> 00:35:02,211
Nay, good lieutenant.

419
00:35:02,413 --> 00:35:06,008
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.

420
00:35:06,733 --> 00:35:10,282
Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you
over the mazzard.

421
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:13,610
Come, come...

422
00:35:13,813 --> 00:35:15,212
...you're drunk.

423
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,042
Drunk?

424
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,965
Nay, good lieutenant.

425
00:35:28,613 --> 00:35:29,728
Goïs will, gentlemen!

426
00:35:37,053 --> 00:35:39,283
Good lieutenant, hold!

427
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:41,410
Mutiny!

428
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,486
Mutiny!

429
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:53,408
Help, ho! Lieutenant!

430
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,046
Goïs will, lieutenant.
Hold!

431
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:05,687
Hold, for your lives!

432
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:07,002
Hold, for shame!

433
00:36:07,213 --> 00:36:09,010
Whas the matter here?!

434
00:36:09,213 --> 00:36:11,010
Are we turned Turks?!

435
00:36:11,733 --> 00:36:15,043
For Christian shame,
put by this barbarous brawl.

436
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:18,331
He who stirs next
to carve for his own rage...

437
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:19,807
...holds his soul light.

438
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:22,732
He dies upon his motion.

439
00:36:24,773 --> 00:36:27,162
What is the matter, masters?

440
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:29,281
Michael...

441
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:31,848
...how comes it you are thus forgot?

442
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:36,449
I pray you, pardon me, sir!

443
00:36:37,173 --> 00:36:38,731
I cannot speak.

444
00:36:41,893 --> 00:36:43,451
Worthy Montano...

445
00:36:45,373 --> 00:36:48,445
...what is the matter that
you unlace your reputation thus...

446
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:51,770
...and spend your rich opinion for
the name of a night-brawler?

447
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:56,569
- Give me answer to it.
- Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.

448
00:36:56,773 --> 00:36:59,765
Your officer, lago, can inform you,
while I spare speech...

449
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:02,163
...of all that I do know.

450
00:37:10,973 --> 00:37:14,966
Now, by heaven, my blood begins
my safer guides to rule.

451
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:19,086
On thy love I charge thee, lago.
Who began it?

452
00:37:19,293 --> 00:37:21,443
If partially affined or
leagued in office...

453
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:24,725
...thou dost deliver more
or less than truth...

454
00:37:24,893 --> 00:37:26,724
...thou art no soldier.

455
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:29,731
Touch me not so near!
I had rather cut this tongue...

456
00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:32,083
...than it should do offense
to Michael Cassio.

457
00:37:35,093 --> 00:37:37,288
Yet to speak the truth
shall nothing wrong him.

458
00:37:37,493 --> 00:37:38,892
This it is, general:

459
00:37:39,253 --> 00:37:42,245
Montano and myself being in speech,
comes a fellow crying for help...

460
00:37:42,453 --> 00:37:46,162
...and Cassio following him with
determined sword to execute upon him.

461
00:37:46,453 --> 00:37:49,206
Sir, this gentleman steps in
to Cassio...

462
00:37:59,453 --> 00:38:02,013
- but more of this matter
can I not report.

463
00:38:06,853 --> 00:38:10,482
But men are men.
The best sometime forget.

464
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:12,729
Though Cassio did
some little wrong to him...

465
00:38:12,893 --> 00:38:15,361
...as men in rage strike those
that wish them best...

466
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:16,568
...yet surely Cassio...

467
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:21,051
I know, lago, thy honesty and love
doth mince this matter...

468
00:38:21,253 --> 00:38:24,086
...making it light to Cassio.

469
00:38:42,013 --> 00:38:43,571
Cassio...

470
00:38:46,613 --> 00:38:50,526
...he that you hurt
is of great fame in Cyprus...

471
00:38:51,813 --> 00:38:53,531
...and great affinity.

472
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,086
I love thee...

473
00:38:58,013 --> 00:39:00,402
...but nevermore be officer of mine.

474
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:02,286
What is the matter, dear?

475
00:39:03,453 --> 00:39:05,330
Look, if my gentle love
be not raised up.

476
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:07,728
I'll make thee an example.

477
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:11,443
All's well now, sweeting.
Come away to bed.

478
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:13,325
Look with care about the town...

479
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:16,093
...and silence those
whom this vile brawl distracted.

480
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:18,165
Come, sweet Desdemona.

481
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:33,687
- Are you hurt, lieutenant?
- Ay, past all surgery.

482
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:36,890
- Marry, God forbid!
- I have lost my reputation.

483
00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:40,001
I have lost the immortal
part of myself...

484
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:42,647
...and what remains is bestial.

485
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:46,004
My reputation, lago!
My reputation!

486
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:48,090
I thought you'd received some wound.

487
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:50,926
There's more offense in that
than in reputation.

488
00:39:53,053 --> 00:39:56,250
What, man! There are ways
to recover the general again.

489
00:39:56,413 --> 00:39:57,926
You are but now cast in his mood...

490
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:00,249
...a punishment more in policy
than in malice.

491
00:40:00,413 --> 00:40:03,723
- Sue to him again, and he's yours.
- I would rather sue to be despised...

492
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:05,685
...than to deceive
so good a commander...

493
00:40:05,853 --> 00:40:09,562
...with so slight, so drunken and
so indiscreet an officer.

494
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:11,047
He that you followed...

495
00:40:11,253 --> 00:40:13,562
...what had he done to you?
- I know not.

496
00:40:13,773 --> 00:40:15,570
- Is it possible?
- Drunk!

497
00:40:15,773 --> 00:40:18,367
Wine is a good
familiar creature, if it be well used.

498
00:40:18,573 --> 00:40:20,848
Exclaim no more against it.

499
00:40:21,053 --> 00:40:24,090
And good lieutenant...

500
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:27,445
...I think you think I love you.

501
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:30,726
I have well approved it, sir.

502
00:40:31,853 --> 00:40:33,844
I'll tell you what you shall do.

503
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:37,126
Our general's wife is now the general.

504
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:40,493
Confess yourself freely to Desdemona.

505
00:40:40,693 --> 00:40:43,890
Importune her. She'll help
to put you in your place again.

506
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:46,812
This broken joint
between you and her husband...

507
00:40:47,013 --> 00:40:48,731
...entreat her to splinter.

508
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:52,124
And my fortunes
against any lay worth naming...

509
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:56,565
...this crack of your love shall
grow stronger than it was before.

510
00:40:58,653 --> 00:40:59,768
You advise me well.

511
00:41:00,213 --> 00:41:03,603
I protest, in the sincerity of love
and honest kindness.

512
00:41:03,813 --> 00:41:05,610
I think it freely.

513
00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:13,451
Good night, lieutenant.

514
00:41:13,653 --> 00:41:15,609
I must to the watch.

515
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,208
Good night, honest lago.

516
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:24,965
How am I then a villain...

517
00:41:25,173 --> 00:41:27,607
...when this advice is free I give
and honest...

518
00:41:27,773 --> 00:41:31,561
...probal to thinking, and indeed
the course to win the Moor again?

519
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:35,971
His soul is so enfettered
to Desdemona's love...

520
00:41:36,173 --> 00:41:39,609
...that she may make, unmake,
do what she list...

521
00:41:39,813 --> 00:41:43,692
...even as her appetite shall
play the god with his weak function.

522
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:46,168
How am I then a villain
to counsel Cassio...

523
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:49,285
...to this parallel course,
directed to his good?

524
00:41:50,053 --> 00:41:52,613
Divinity of hell!

525
00:41:53,413 --> 00:41:57,292
When devils will the blackest sins
put on, they do suggest at first...

526
00:41:57,493 --> 00:41:59,723
...with heavenly shows, as I do now.

527
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:04,370
For whiles this honest fool plies
Desdemona to repair his fortunes...

528
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:07,610
...and she for him
pleads strongly to the Moor...

529
00:42:07,773 --> 00:42:10,162
...l'll pour this pestilence
into his ear...

530
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:14,008
...that she repeals him for
her body's lust...

531
00:42:14,213 --> 00:42:17,125
...and by how much she strives
to do him good...

532
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:21,531
...she shall undo her credit
with the Moor.

533
00:42:25,053 --> 00:42:28,045
So will I turn her virtue...

534
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:34,005
...into pitch.

535
00:42:34,733 --> 00:42:37,327
And out of her own goodness...

536
00:42:37,533 --> 00:42:39,444
...make the net...

537
00:42:39,653 --> 00:42:41,530
...that shall...

538
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:43,490
...enmesh them all.

539
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:49,685
How now, Roderigo?

540
00:42:50,213 --> 00:42:52,807
I do follow here in the chase...

541
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:55,692
...not like a hound that hunts...

542
00:42:55,893 --> 00:42:58,566
...but one that fills up the cry.

543
00:42:59,013 --> 00:43:01,527
My money is almost spent.

544
00:43:01,733 --> 00:43:05,521
I have been tonight
exceedingly well-cudgeled.

545
00:43:06,373 --> 00:43:09,331
And I think the issue will be...

546
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:12,605
...that I shall have
so much experience for my pains.

547
00:43:12,813 --> 00:43:14,132
And so...

548
00:43:14,813 --> 00:43:18,522
...with no money at all and
a little more wit...

549
00:43:19,813 --> 00:43:22,168
...return again to Venice.

550
00:43:23,413 --> 00:43:26,530
How poor are they
that have not patience.

551
00:43:27,493 --> 00:43:30,963
What wound did ever heal
but by degrees?

552
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:33,967
Thou knowest we work by wit...

553
00:43:34,173 --> 00:43:35,925
...and not by witchcraft.

554
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:39,284
And wit depends on dilatory time.

555
00:43:40,053 --> 00:43:41,645
Does it not go well?

556
00:43:43,693 --> 00:43:45,604
Cassio hath beaten thee.

557
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:51,529
And thou, by that small hurt...

558
00:43:51,733 --> 00:43:54,725
...hath cashiered Cassio.

559
00:43:58,653 --> 00:44:00,450
Content thyself awhile.

560
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:13,132
By the mass, 'tis morning.

561
00:44:13,533 --> 00:44:16,764
Pleasure and action
make the hours seem short.

562
00:44:17,373 --> 00:44:18,806
Retire thee awhile.

563
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:23,285
Away, I say.

564
00:44:23,773 --> 00:44:26,003
Thou shalt know more hereafter.

565
00:44:27,693 --> 00:44:29,365
Nay, get thee gone.

566
00:44:46,409 --> 00:44:47,637
Bounteous madam...

567
00:44:47,809 --> 00:44:49,720
...whatever shall become of
Michael Cassio?

568
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:53,399
- He's never anything but your servant.
- I know it.

569
00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:55,043
I thank you.

570
00:44:56,329 --> 00:44:57,557
Madam, here comes my lord.

571
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:03,602
- I like not that.
- What dost thou say?

572
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:05,078
Nothing, my lord.

573
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:08,003
- Madam, I take my leave.
- Farewell.

574
00:45:10,689 --> 00:45:12,566
Was not that Cassio
parted from my wife?

575
00:45:12,729 --> 00:45:13,718
Cassio, my lord.

576
00:45:15,969 --> 00:45:17,721
How now, my lord?

577
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:20,644
I have been talking with
a suitor here...

578
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:22,840
...a man that languishes in
your displeasure.

579
00:45:23,009 --> 00:45:24,442
Who is it you mean?

580
00:45:24,649 --> 00:45:26,605
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.

581
00:45:27,049 --> 00:45:29,563
Good my lord, if he be not one
that truly loves you...

582
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:32,329
...I have no judgment in an honest face.

583
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:49,238
Excellent wretch!

584
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,406
Perdition catch my soul,
but I do love thee!

585
00:45:55,649 --> 00:45:57,719
And when I love thee not...

586
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,600
...chaos is come again.

587
00:46:02,169 --> 00:46:05,047
- My noble lord...
- What dost thou say, lago?

588
00:46:05,249 --> 00:46:08,480
Did Cassio, when you wooed
my lady, know of your love?

589
00:46:08,689 --> 00:46:10,441
He did, from first to last.

590
00:46:15,009 --> 00:46:16,601
Why dost thou ask?

591
00:46:16,769 --> 00:46:19,966
But for a satisfaction of my thought.
No further harm.

592
00:46:24,969 --> 00:46:27,278
Why of thy thought, lago?

593
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:29,884
I did not think he had been
acquainted with her.

594
00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:31,408
O, yes.

595
00:46:32,249 --> 00:46:33,807
And went between us very oft.

596
00:46:34,009 --> 00:46:35,681
- Indeed!
- Indeed?

597
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:37,681
Ay, indeed.

598
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:41,158
Discernest thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?

599
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:44,486
- Honest, my lord?
- Honest? Ay, honest.

600
00:46:44,849 --> 00:46:46,487
My lord, for aught I know.

601
00:46:46,689 --> 00:46:48,441
- What dost thou think?
- Think, my lord?

602
00:46:48,649 --> 00:46:51,209
"Think, my lord"!
By heaven, he echoes me.

603
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:52,922
Thou dost mean something.

604
00:46:53,129 --> 00:46:55,962
If thou dost love me,
show me thy thought.

605
00:46:57,089 --> 00:47:00,399
- My lord, you know I love you.
- I think thou dost.

606
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:03,118
And for I know
thou art full of love...

607
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:04,648
...and honesty...

608
00:47:05,129 --> 00:47:07,802
...and weighest thy words
before thou givest them breath.

609
00:47:07,969 --> 00:47:10,563
Therefore, these stops of thine
fright me the more.

610
00:47:10,769 --> 00:47:13,488
For Cassio, I dare be sworn
I think that he is honest.

611
00:47:14,049 --> 00:47:15,243
I think so too.

612
00:47:15,449 --> 00:47:16,802
Men should be what they seem.

613
00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:19,318
Or those that be not,
would they might seem none.

614
00:47:19,529 --> 00:47:21,247
Certain, men should be
what they seem.

615
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:23,798
Why then, I think Cassio's
an honest man.

616
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:25,687
Nay, yet there's more in this!

617
00:47:25,889 --> 00:47:28,039
I prithee, speak to me as to
thy thinkings.

618
00:47:28,249 --> 00:47:31,639
As thou dost ruminate, give thy
worst of thoughts the worst of words.

619
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,646
I do beseech you...

620
00:47:34,729 --> 00:47:36,924
Though I perchance am
vicious in my guess...

621
00:47:37,129 --> 00:47:40,917
...as I confess, it is my
nature's plague to spy into abuses...

622
00:47:41,129 --> 00:47:43,279
...and oft my jealousy...

623
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:46,802
...shapes faults that are not.

624
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,367
I entreat you then, it were not for
your quiet nor your good...

625
00:47:50,529 --> 00:47:55,284
...nor for my manhood, honesty and
wisdom to let you know my thoughts.

626
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:56,842
What dost thou mean?

627
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:00,841
Good name in man and woman,
dear my lord...

628
00:48:01,049 --> 00:48:04,280
...is the immediate jewel
of their souls.

629
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:06,883
Who steals my purse, steals trash.

630
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:09,887
'Tis something, nothing.
'Twas mine, 'tis his...

631
00:48:10,049 --> 00:48:11,402
...has been slave to thousands.

632
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:14,567
But he that filches from me
my good name...

633
00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:17,124
...robs me of that
which not enriches him...

634
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:19,797
...and makes me poor indeed.

635
00:48:21,329 --> 00:48:24,799
By heaven, I'll know thy thought.

636
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:26,721
You cannot, if my heart
were in your hand.

637
00:48:26,929 --> 00:48:29,682
Nor shall not,
while 'tis in my custody.

638
00:48:31,289 --> 00:48:34,008
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!

639
00:48:34,249 --> 00:48:38,322
'Tis the green-eyed monster
that doth mock the meat it feeds on.

640
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:39,958
Why?

641
00:48:42,609 --> 00:48:44,247
Why is this?

642
00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:48,925
Thinkest thou I'd make
a life of jealousy...

643
00:48:49,089 --> 00:48:53,082
...to follow still the changes of
the moon with fresh suspicions? No!

644
00:48:54,089 --> 00:48:56,557
To be once in doubt
is once to be resolved.

645
00:48:57,729 --> 00:48:59,765
Nor from mine own weak merits
shall I draw...

646
00:48:59,969 --> 00:49:04,485
...the smallest fear or doubt of her
revolt, for she had eyes and chose me.

647
00:49:04,689 --> 00:49:05,678
No, lago...

648
00:49:06,689 --> 00:49:10,398
...l'll see before I doubt.
When I doubt, prove.

649
00:49:10,609 --> 00:49:12,565
And on the proof,
there is no more but this:

650
00:49:12,769 --> 00:49:14,839
Away at once with love or jealousy.

651
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:16,601
I am glad, for now I have reason...

652
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:19,761
...to show the love and duty
that I bear you with franker spirit.

653
00:49:19,969 --> 00:49:23,757
Therefore, as I am bound,
receive it from me.

654
00:49:24,609 --> 00:49:26,520
I speak not yet of proof.

655
00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:33,608
Look to your wife.

656
00:49:36,169 --> 00:49:39,320
Observe her well with Cassio.

657
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:41,808
Look to it.

658
00:49:42,969 --> 00:49:45,039
I know our country disposition well.

659
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:47,809
In Venice, they do
let heaven see the pranks...

660
00:49:48,009 --> 00:49:49,920
...they dare not show their husbands.

661
00:49:50,129 --> 00:49:52,518
Their best conscience
is not to leave it undone...

662
00:49:52,729 --> 00:49:54,606
...but keep it unknown.

663
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:03,324
- Dost thou say so?
- She did deceive her father.

664
00:50:03,529 --> 00:50:06,248
And when she seemed to fear
your looks, she loved them most.

665
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:08,764
- And so she did.
- Why, go to then.

666
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:15,481
But I am much to blame.

667
00:50:17,569 --> 00:50:21,403
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
for too much loving you.

668
00:50:21,609 --> 00:50:23,520
I am bound to thee forever.

669
00:50:26,729 --> 00:50:28,321
I see this hath dashed your spirits.

670
00:50:28,489 --> 00:50:31,003
- Not a jot, not a jot.
- In faith, I fear it has.

671
00:50:31,169 --> 00:50:33,558
I hope you consider what is spoke
comes from my love.

672
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:35,646
But I do see you're moved.

673
00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:39,040
I am to pray you not to strain
my speech to grosser issues...

674
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:41,285
...nor to larger reach than
to suspicion.

675
00:50:41,489 --> 00:50:42,842
Should you do so, my lord...

676
00:50:43,009 --> 00:50:46,081
...my speech should fall into vile
success as my thoughts aimed not at.

677
00:50:46,249 --> 00:50:48,763
Cassio's my worthy friend...
My lord, you're moved.

678
00:50:48,929 --> 00:50:50,203
No, not much moved!

679
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:52,206
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

680
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:55,321
Long live she so.
And long live you to think so.

681
00:50:56,049 --> 00:50:59,359
And yet, how nature erring from itself...

682
00:50:59,569 --> 00:51:01,241
Ay, there's the point!

683
00:51:01,409 --> 00:51:03,684
As to be bold not to enter
into a marriage...

684
00:51:03,889 --> 00:51:06,357
...of her own clime, complexion
and degree...

685
00:51:06,569 --> 00:51:10,357
...whereto we see in all things
nature tends...

686
00:51:10,689 --> 00:51:13,157
One may smell in such
a will most rank...

687
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:17,078
<i>... foul disproportion,
thoughts unnatural.</i>

688
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:33,920
But pardon me. I do not in position
distinctly speak of her.

689
00:51:34,129 --> 00:51:38,520
Though I may fear, her will,
recoiling to her better judgment...

690
00:51:38,689 --> 00:51:41,806
...may fall to match you with
her country forms...

691
00:51:42,009 --> 00:51:43,920
...and happily repent.

692
00:51:45,529 --> 00:51:47,087
Farewell, farewell.

693
00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:50,599
If more thou dost perceive,
let me know more.

694
00:51:51,089 --> 00:51:52,442
Leave me, lago.

695
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,565
My lord, I take my leave.

696
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:02,280
Why did I marry?

697
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:06,158
My lord, I would
I might entreat your honor...

698
00:52:06,369 --> 00:52:08,519
...to scan this thing no farther.

699
00:52:08,689 --> 00:52:09,678
Leave it to time.

700
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:12,600
Let me be thought too busy
in my fears...

701
00:52:12,769 --> 00:52:15,681
...as worthy cause
I have to fear I am...

702
00:52:16,129 --> 00:52:18,040
...and hold her free.

703
00:52:18,409 --> 00:52:19,808
Fear not my government.

704
00:52:27,009 --> 00:52:30,888
That we can call
these delicate creatures ours...

705
00:52:31,329 --> 00:52:33,638
...and not their appetites!

706
00:53:10,089 --> 00:53:12,205
How now, my dear Othello!

707
00:53:12,449 --> 00:53:15,122
Your dinner and the generous
islanders by you invited...

708
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:17,399
...do attend your presence.

709
00:53:18,049 --> 00:53:21,598
- I am to blame.
- Why do you speak so faintly?

710
00:53:24,609 --> 00:53:26,167
Are you not well?

711
00:53:35,809 --> 00:53:38,801
Come, I'll go with you.

712
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:31,202
I have a thing for you.

713
00:54:31,409 --> 00:54:34,685
You have a thing for me?

714
00:54:35,249 --> 00:54:38,798
It is a common thing
to have a foolish wife.

715
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:40,522
O, is that all?

716
00:54:42,809 --> 00:54:44,800
What will you give me for
that handkerchief?

717
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:46,567
What handkerchief?

718
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:48,641
What handkerchief?

719
00:54:49,529 --> 00:54:54,239
Why, that the Moor
first gave to Desdemona...

720
00:54:55,289 --> 00:54:58,759
...that which so often you did
bid me steal.

721
00:54:59,649 --> 00:55:03,722
Hast stolen it from her?

722
00:55:03,889 --> 00:55:05,208
No, faith.

723
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:07,803
She let it drop by negligence.

724
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:24,803
What will you do with it,
that you've been so earnest...

725
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:26,601
...to have me filch it?

726
00:55:39,889 --> 00:55:42,005
Trifles light as air...

727
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:46,919
...are to the jealous confirmations
strong as proofs of holy writ.

728
00:55:48,449 --> 00:55:50,087
This may do something.

729
00:55:51,087 --> 00:56:01,087
