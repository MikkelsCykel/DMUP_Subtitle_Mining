1
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,680
Victor.

2
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,974
Victor!
Victor, come on!

3
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,643
Ooph!

4
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,811
Bad dog.

5
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,616
Charles!

6
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,784
Oh, hi.

7
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,952
Oh, what have you been doing?

8
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,787
There's South American stamps
on here.

9
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,623
You must know somebody
in Uruguay, Mr. Razaghi.

10
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,584
Sort of.

11
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,127
I hope it's good news.

12
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,295
Thank you.

13
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,801
"We do not see the need
for an authorized

14
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,512
"biography of Jules Gund
at this time,

15
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,598
nor at any time in the future"?

16
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,266
Why would they
deny me authorization?

17
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,767
It's not like
everyone in the world

18
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,646
is working on a biography
of Jules Gund.

19
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,148
Which one is Caroline Gund?

20
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,441
The widow.

21
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,485
There's a daughter too,
but she didn't sign.

22
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,529
So who's Arden Langdon?

23
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:21,909
She's the uh...
mistress, I guess.

24
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,660
Adam Gund, that's the brother.

25
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,746
And Ocho Rios is the place

26
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,081
where they all lived together
when Jules Gund was alive.

27
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,499
That's quite a setup:

28
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,420
the brother, the widow,
the lover, a daughter.

29
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,673
That's probably why they don't
want to authorize a biography.

30
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,260
It's too tortured
and incestuous.

31
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,512
Wait.

32
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,681
"Your request has prompted
much discussion

33
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,017
amongst the trustees."

34
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,395
That could mean
they don't all agree.

35
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,994
You'll have to go to Uruguay.

36
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,371
What?

37
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,872
After that letter?

38
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,165
Confront the three executors

39
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,959
and make them
change their minds.

40
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,794
It may be easier than you think.

41
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,212
But they said "no."

42
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,256
Mm.

43
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,423
You know perfectly well

44
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,133
that without
getting their permission,

45
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,469
there's no fellowship, no money,
no biography,

46
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,306
and no new contract for you
at the university.

47
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,685
Omar, you'll never
get another teaching job.

48
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,729
And what else can you do?

49
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:33,981
Nothing.

50
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,274
Exactly.

51
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,042
I forgot to heat the milk.

52
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,419
Do you think it matters?

53
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,839
I've never heard of a sublet
that comes with a dog,

54
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,174
and one
with such an elaborate diet.

55
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,854
How could you do that,
fall in a puddle?

56
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,105
It wasn't a puddle.

57
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,607
It was quicksand.

58
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,775
For you, it's quicksand.

59
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,278
For everyone else,
it's a puddle.

60
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,113
It's like you have this
subconscious drive

61
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:28,785
to fall in, to mess up.

62
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,454
I think I should come with you

63
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,414
to Uruguay.

64
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,333
I've had more experience
with things like that.

65
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,500
No.

66
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,252
I think I should go by myself,

67
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:41,465
if I decide to go.

68
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,467
Well, if you decide to go,

69
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,636
I think it would be better
for us to do it together.

70
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,807
Better for us
individually and as a couple.

71
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,101
I think it'll be better
for both of us

72
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,936
individually and as a couple

73
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,772
if I were to go by myself.

74
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,899
But I appreciate your offer.

75
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,942
You appreciate my offer?

76
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,986
Mm-hmm.

77
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,114
Omar, it's me, Deirdre.

78
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,742
You don't appreciate my offer.

79
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,536
I almost drowned in quicksand.

80
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,622
I saw my life
flash before my eyes,

81
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,292
and I did not like what I saw.

82
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,294
I've decided to change my life.

83
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,214
I have to be,
you know, more independent.

84
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,590
Like other people.

85
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,402
I don't want you
to be like other people,

86
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,112
to change.

87
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,664
Oh, what's wrong, buddy?

88
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,666
You want to go outside?
Let's go outside.

89
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,834
Come on.

90
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,001
Come on!

91
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,878
Oh.
Buddy.

92
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,004
Hopeless.

93
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,132
Out you go.

94
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,939
If you fly to Miami first,

95
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,192
it's nonstop from there
to Montevideo.

96
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:28,822
But that's horribly expensive.

97
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,282
What about Victor?

98
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,741
He's not your dog.

99
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,909
We'll put him in a pound.

100
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,745
Most of them
have a 30-day grace period.

101
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,539
You can redeem him
when you get back.

102
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,291
Deirdre,

103
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,459
he's part of the house-sit.

104
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,626
I'm responsible for him.

105
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:47,591
We can't just throw him
in the pound.

106
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,134
Ah, this is better.

107
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,261
From Houston to Sao Paulo,

108
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,472
then Montevideo.

109
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,891
For some reason,
it's much cheaper.

110
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,311
Ah, it takes much longer.

111
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,062
Don't do that now.

112
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,530
I'm hurt.

113
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,825
Senior.

114
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,953
- Si.
- Por favor.

115
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,386
Are you coming to Ocho Rios?

116
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,554
That's my house.

117
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,848
- You speak English.
- Of course.

118
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,183
And Spanish.

119
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,601
I'm Omar.

120
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,269
Omar Razaghi.

121
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,437
I'm Portia.

122
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,439
Why are you coming to Ocho Rios?

123
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,899
I want to write a book.

124
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,361
I want to write a biography
about Jules Gund.

125
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,029
Have you heard of him?

126
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,614
He was my father.

127
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,699
Your father?

128
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,159
Mm-hmm.

129
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,885
This is Omar.

130
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,303
He's writing a book.

131
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,722
This is my mother.

132
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,515
Mrs. Gund?

133
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,600
I'm Omar Razaghi.

134
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,935
I wrote you the letter

135
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,311
about the biography.

136
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,148
My name's Arden Langdon.

137
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,483
Caroline...

138
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,653
she's Mrs. Gund.

139
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,946
But we wrote to you.

140
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,114
We said no.

141
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,657
We very definitely said no.

142
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,160
Yes, that's why I'm here.

143
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,746
I'm hoping
you'll change your minds.

144
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,789
I guess
I should have written first.

145
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,375
It was very wrong of me
to come like this.

146
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,210
I have to find a hotel.

147
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,587
Where?

148
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,506
There's nothing except
this place for miles and miles.

149
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,426
I can sleep outdoors
in the garden,

150
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,594
if you'll let me.

151
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,762
Don't be ridiculous.

152
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,929
Now that you're here,

153
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,514
there's nowhere else
for you to go,

154
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,184
so till we can get you
back into town,

155
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,852
we'll have to let you stay.

156
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,562
Really?

157
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,491
Mad women and English men:

158
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,327
why they would want to walk here
in the sun is beyond me.

159
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:53,915
Of course, those two ladies
are always beyond me.

160
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:58,545
Can you help me with my cravat,
please?

161
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,255
You know,
I've always liked this cravat.

162
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,799
I bought it in Venice in 1966.

163
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,300
I must have been happy
at the time.

164
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,720
Otherwise, why would I have
bought such a beautiful thing?

165
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:12,058
I look very handsome in that.

166
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,602
They're walking like...

167
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,062
they're bringing important news.

168
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,898
Oh, what news?

169
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,985
Great tidings at Ocho Rios.

170
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,320
They do look serious,
don't they?

171
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,573
Supposing we...

172
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,492
stuck by our decision
to refuse authorization.

173
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,995
Then he shall have come
very far for nothing.

174
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,998
Yes, but he can still
write the biography

175
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,499
without authorization.

176
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,252
That is,
without our help and consent.

177
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,504
That would give him
quite a free hand, wouldn't it?

178
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,339
To make up things,
to make up stories,

179
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,091
twist the facts.

180
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,426
You know, once these people,

181
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,094
these biographers
turn against you,

182
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,179
they can become quite vicious.

183
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,016
Oh, he didn't look
as if he could ever be that.

184
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,893
How do you know?

185
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,311
You only saw him
for five minutes

186
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,688
before at once
inviting him to stay.

187
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:02,609
He looked so tired
and helpless somehow.

188
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,776
And young and handsome.

189
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,111
Oh, really?

190
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,654
That has nothing
to do with it.

191
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,365
Anyway, Jules said he didn't
want a biography of himself.

192
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,702
He said it was like having
one's corpse publicly exhumed.

193
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,538
Oh, when did he say that?

194
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,206
In a letter to me years ago.

195
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,459
My god.

196
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,836
Well, if we were
held accountable

197
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,130
for the things we wrote in
letters millions of years ago,

198
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,882
my dear,
where would any of us be?

199
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,508
But he must have told you
other things.

200
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,552
Um, for instance,
that he would be married

201
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,055
and faithful to you
forever and ever.

202
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,389
He was.

203
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,391
He stayed married to me.

204
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,643
Oh.

205
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,145
And Arden didn't count,
or Portia?

206
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,898
Caroline didn't say that.

207
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,245
The days pass,
and we live together,

208
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,830
Caroline and I,

209
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,332
and we manage it.

210
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,834
Quite well, I think.

211
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,586
And now this.

212
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,591
Adam's so moody nowadays.

213
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,426
It's because of you.

214
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,972
He's afraid you'll leave him.

215
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,557
I used to live like that,

216
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:21,562
always afraid
that Jules would leave me.

217
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,399
He'd get into those black moods,

218
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,277
not speak to me for days on end,

219
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,904
not to anyone,

220
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,281
not to Caroline.

221
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,284
And I thought
that she'd turn against me

222
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,954
and get him to send me away.

223
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,497
Where would I go?

224
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,375
Where would I go?

225
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,336
That's all in the past.

226
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,466
Yes, it's strange.

227
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,636
Everything's easier.

228
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,638
But now
when some stranger arrives...

229
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,640
Is he young and handsome?

230
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,685
It depends
what you mean by that.

231
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,937
Can you find any more teaspoons?

232
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,195
How can we just send him away?

233
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,239
Tell him,
"Good-bye; go home"?

234
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,407
We're not.

235
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,117
We're even letting him stay
in the house.

236
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,660
We're being very friendly.

237
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,788
But then he might start to
think we've changed our minds.

238
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,248
That's his problem.

239
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,292
I can be friendly
without changing my mind.

240
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,211
Well, he must have come here
with such hope.

241
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,547
Let's think about this.

242
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,008
A biography would stimulate
interest in Jules' work,

243
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,385
and that is something that we,
as his executors,

244
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,845
should encourage.

245
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,432
Anyway, let's not make
any hasty decisions, shall we?

246
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,726
My decision's made,
and it's not hasty.

247
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:45,730
And Arden, for her own reasons,
is on my side.

248
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,315
You are, aren't you?

249
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,649
Yes, you are.

250
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,903
So that's two
against one, Adam.

251
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,571
Well, I refuse
to be guided by anything

252
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,365
as stupid as democracy.

253
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,790
Portia.

254
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,254
Mustn't disturb him.

255
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,632
Are we gonna whisper
all night?

256
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,425
Hmm?

257
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,053
He's come a long way.
He must be tired.

258
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,443
Hello?

259
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,778
Hello?

260
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,947
I would like to speak
to Omar Razaghi, please.

261
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,115
Dee!

262
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,533
- Omar?
- Hi.

263
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,701
How did you get this number?

264
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,869
You don't sound like Omar.

265
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,036
Are you eating something?

266
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,454
Yes, bread and honey.

267
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,622
What?

268
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,790
Honey.

269
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,792
Darling, I miss you too.

270
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,627
But you won't be away long.

271
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,795
What's it like there?

272
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,130
I guess they're all pretty old.

273
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,756
I only hope they're not senile.

274
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,633
Well, it might take longer
than we thought.

275
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,552
Can't you stop eating
for a minute?

276
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,928
We have a very bad connection.

277
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,973
I told you to get a cell phone
when you went down there.

278
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,975
It could have come
out of the fellowship money.

279
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,812
Are you there?
Dee?

280
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,980
Omar?

281
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,652
Dee, are you there?

282
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,862
Hello?

283
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,488
click!

284
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,997
Thank you for the bread
and the honey.

285
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,916
It was delicious.

286
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,751
It's from our own bees.

287
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,502
You know anything about bees?

288
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,171
Bees.

289
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,839
I know they live in an apiary,

290
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,175
a word derived from apis,

291
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,678
which is Latin for "bee."

292
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,764
This is not
very interesting information.

293
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,020
I can't believe it.

294
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,105
You read a book and you think
all about the place,

295
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,941
but you don't really think
that it exists,

296
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,442
let alone that you'll be there.

297
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,612
Let me help you with that.

298
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,030
Oh.

299
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,967
Coming here, to Ocho Rios,

300
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,552
was like coming
to my first home,

301
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,638
the first I ever had.

302
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,806
My parents were divorced,

303
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,809
and I went back and forth
between them.

304
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,811
No one really cared.

305
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,230
They both died in plane crashes,

306
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,982
two different planes.

307
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,650
He was on his way to Prague

308
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,069
for one of his
not very successful films,

309
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,488
and Mother
was going to Hong Kong

310
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,241
to get married...
again.

311
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,575
All the years in America,

312
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,995
my parents wanted to go back
to Tehran,

313
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,246
but it never worked out.

314
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,414
What did they do?

315
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,665
They were doctors,

316
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,500
pediatricians.

317
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,752
They died
four years ago.

318
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:41,382
First my mother, then my father
after a few months.

319
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,844
So we're both orphans.

320
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,179
I think I was born an orphan.

321
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,850
I was 18 when Jules
first brought me here.

322
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,768
That was ten years ago.

323
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,770
I was 18 ten years ago.

324
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,355
You and I are the same age,

325
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,523
born at the same time.

326
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,066
We could be brother and sister.

327
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,234
Twins.

328
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,863
Only twins
can be born at the same time.

329
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,115
Oh.

330
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,742
I am Omar Razaghi.

331
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,952
Yes, I know who you are,
my friend.

332
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,120
You're the biographer

333
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:14,290
who showed up
in spite of our letter.

334
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,750
And what are you giving him?

335
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,335
Oh, what-tea?

336
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,627
Oh, really, Arden,

337
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,755
you'll have to give him
something better than that

338
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,465
to compensate
for his long journey here

339
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,632
and back.

340
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,426
How about some champagne?

341
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,677
Champagne?

342
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,137
At this time of day?

343
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,640
Well, is there a special
time of the day for champagne?

344
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,768
Well, if so, it is now.

345
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,353
Hmm?

346
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,153
You're flirting with him.

347
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,321
What?

348
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,655
When you start opening up

349
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,158
the beautiful secrets
of your past-

350
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,452
"I was born an orphan"-

351
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,579
that's flirting.

352
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,456
Caroline,
try not to tease and provoke.

353
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,291
Oh, come on.

354
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,001
How often do we have a guest,

355
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,836
even an uninvited one?

356
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,636
I may not
make it back tonight.

357
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,970
Why not?

358
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,138
Business,

359
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,307
as you know perfectly well.

360
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,143
I know your business
perfectly well:

361
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:20,731
antique furniture,
and some of it not so antique.

362
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,400
We need to raise some cash.

363
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,901
I know.

364
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:28,155
Land taxes are due
next month.

365
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,241
You have all this land;

366
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,493
you pay big taxes on it.
- Mm-hmm.

367
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,787
You don't try
to make it work for you.

368
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,002
Sorry to spoil your mood,

369
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,255
but try and be sensible.

370
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,589
I'm willing to be sensible,

371
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,299
but can you imagine
the other two

372
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,884
ever agreeing to anything?

373
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,177
I mean, look what's happening

374
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,847
with this
foolish little biography,

375
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,434
which, for all I know,
could be to our advantage.

376
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,519
But Caroline's only pleasure
left in life

377
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,604
is to say "no" to everything.

378
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,274
And as for poor Arden,
well...

379
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:11,115
I wish you had more of a life
of your own.

380
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,283
I do have.

381
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,410
Yeah.

382
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,121
It saddens me.

383
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,915
I think I was wrong
to bring you here.

384
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,042
Sorry.

385
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,210
Hey.

386
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,571
Hola!

387
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,825
Ah.

388
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,619
Hello, darling.

389
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,786
Champagne.

390
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,998
Is there a little drop
for me left, do you think?

391
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,083
- Ah, the guest.
- Hello, sir.

392
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,502
Mr. Ragazi
received our letter,

393
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,295
but as you see,
it did not discourage him

394
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,839
from coming to visit,
so now we're all having a party.

395
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,090
Oh.

396
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,092
Well, then we must show
Mr. Razaghi-Omar, may I?

397
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,344
- Oh, please.
- Omar.

398
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,888
Yes, we must show Omar
what fine hosts we can be

399
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,640
if, by some miracle,
a guest is washed up

400
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,183
on our lonely shore.

401
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,477
Huh?
What do you say?

402
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,645
A picture show.

403
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,812
Yes, why not?

404
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,648
Portia proposes a picture show.

405
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,982
Her one and only picture show.

406
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,570
Go and show uncle Omar
where the projector is.

407
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,241
Ocho Rios pictures presents...

408
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,159
the Gunds.

409
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,578
Ah.

410
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,916
This is very unwise,

411
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,001
as if we're suddenly
his collaborators.

412
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,753
Well, we're not
showing him anything

413
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,505
he doesn't already know, are we?

414
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,091
After all, Jules' book
was not exactly reticent

415
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,261
about our family affairs,
was it?

416
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,929
Champagne.

417
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:01,016
I'll get you a glass.

418
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,518
So...

419
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,187
how are you, my dear?

420
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,522
Peachy.

421
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,649
Peachy.

422
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,243
Our parents brought
all this film footage

423
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,452
with them from Germany,

424
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,538
and they used to sit
and watch it

425
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,123
the way we're doing now,

426
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:29,628
drinking champagne.

427
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,548
When they had to leave Germany
and became refugees,

428
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,008
they were allowed
to settle here,

429
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,217
in Uruguay

430
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,136
on condition
that they bought all this land

431
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,723
and developed it for a mine.

432
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,977
My parents
always traveled in style,

433
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:49,231
even when they were fleeing
Mr. Hitler and his Nazis.

434
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,484
Always traveled first class.

435
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,820
We lived here
the way they had done in Europe.

436
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,405
We lived in the past,

437
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,157
their past.

438
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,159
They didn't want to know
about the present,

439
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,119
any present anywhere.

440
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,746
South America's
very good for that

441
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,248
if you're a rich foreigner.

442
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,110
That's my grandfather.

443
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,862
They never
spoke German again...

444
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,951
Not even to each other.

445
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,584
There's mysterious Aunt Sarah.

446
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,798
She left for India
to follow her guru.

447
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,049
Ugh.

448
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,219
There she is,
signing away the family fortune.

449
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,726
They went to Venice
for their honeymoon.

450
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,813
And after that,
they went every year

451
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,525
for as long
as it was still possible.

452
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,861
But then the gondola
was the epitome of Europe,

453
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,405
of their Europe.

454
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,454
They persuaded the gondolier
to sell them his gondola.

455
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,289
They called it
the honeymoon gondola

456
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:33,293
and they had it shipped
all the way from the Adriatic,

457
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,962
right across the Atlantic,

458
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,797
here to Montevideo.

459
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:51,937
Their maddest
and saddest enterprise maybe.

460
00:28:56,443 --> 00:29:00,529
But you've heard all about
our gondola from Jules' book.

461
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,532
It's still here with us,
rotting in the boathouse.

462
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,540
Buenos dias.

463
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,417
I'm Pete.

464
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,710
You must be Omar.

465
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:15,878
Yes.

466
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,421
Hello.

467
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,589
Hi.

468
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,300
I'm looking
for the mill house.

469
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,553
Miss Langdon said
it was down this way somewhere.

470
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,972
Mr. Gund has invited me
to lunch.

471
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,767
He has?

472
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,477
He hasn't told me.

473
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,771
I'm the one who does the cooking
around here.

474
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,608
I haven't bought anything.

475
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:41,945
He'll have to take you
to the parilla.

476
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,989
There is no other place.

477
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,741
Do they take Visa?

478
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,910
Don't worry about that.

479
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,079
Adam always picks up the tab.

480
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,999
He's very generous.

481
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,126
Get in.

482
00:29:56,252 --> 00:30:01,089
It's a mile away.

483
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,425
This is where I found him,

484
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,093
Jules,

485
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,137
by that big palm.

486
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:10,474
I was the one who found him.

487
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,103
So near to the house?

488
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,438
Come on.

489
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,158
Blew the top of his head
right off.

490
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,494
I'm glad it was me
who found him

491
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,164
and not one of the others.

492
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,292
The odd thing
is that we all stayed here.

493
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,005
No, thank you.

494
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,508
Anyway,

495
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,635
here we all are...

496
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,178
including me.

497
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:51,390
Where are you from originally?

498
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,518
From Tokunoshima.

499
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,187
A small island.

500
00:30:57,313 --> 00:31:00,566
I was poor with no family.

501
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,318
When I was 14,

502
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,780
someone liked me enough
to take me with him to England.

503
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,497
Here.

504
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:20,085
I find this old furniture
and make it look older.

505
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,839
A lady comes twice a year
from New York and buys it.

506
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:28,844
She says I have a good eye.

507
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,638
Adam used to work at Christie's
in London.

508
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,682
- Hello, Mr. Gund.
- Hello.

509
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,517
He sent me to a school there

510
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,436
where I learned everything
about furniture.

511
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,771
That was 25 years ago.

512
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,273
Yes.

513
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:45,027
We're about to have our
silver anniversary, aren't we?

514
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,154
Ready?
Should we go?

515
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,951
I've ordered us
a platter of grilled meat

516
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,202
and some red wine.

517
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,370
Not too much for me.

518
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,039
I'm a bit of a lightweight,
I'm afraid.

519
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,042
Really?
How sad.

520
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,544
What about all those
drunken Persian poets of yours?

521
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,380
What about Hafez?

522
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,548
"Bring me a cup of red wine

523
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,634
that is dark red
and smells of musk..."

524
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,427
"Don't bring me
that expensive stuff..."

525
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,720
"That tastes like money..."

526
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,055
Both: "And smells like lust."

527
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,810
So now, about the biography.

528
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,313
Please understand,
unlike my two sisters-in-law,

529
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,731
or the two ladies,
I should say,

530
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:23,899
I'm on your side.

531
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,817
- You are?
- Entirely on your side.

532
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,486
See, I've been trying
to explain to them

533
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,155
that to revive an interest
in Jules Gund and his work,

534
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,741
a biography
would be invaluable to us.

535
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,534
Well, if only
I could convince everyone.

536
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,161
I would be very respectful
of the past,

537
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,329
everyone's feelings.

538
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,247
My dear boy,
he was my brother.

539
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,916
I knew him better than anyone.

540
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,250
I knew him when we were still

541
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,294
tearing the wings
off butterflies.

542
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,545
I was eight years older,

543
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,507
but it was he who invented
all the little torments

544
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,342
an older brother
inflicts on the younger.

545
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,219
We were both sent to school
in England.

546
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,470
I was utterly miserable,

547
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,681
but he, when in a system,
was in his element.

548
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,266
I suspect it was there at school
that he began to learn

549
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,520
how to exert power
over those who adored him.

550
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,440
It's that simple.

551
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:09,611
So we must work together,
you and I.

552
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,780
We must co-conspire.

553
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,408
I hadn't thought of conspiring.

554
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,742
Well, of course not.

555
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,581
Ah!

556
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,250
Gracias.

557
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,418
Ooh!

558
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,764
This is Mrs. Van Euwen.

559
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,225
The chatelaine
of Las Golondrinas,

560
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,476
our local grand dame.

561
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,769
Very grand.

562
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,818
Local color, you know?

563
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,154
I told them all they would see
was red meat.

564
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,363
Yes.

565
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,825
Worse,

566
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,619
why do you keep your new friend
away from me?

567
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,455
Oh, yes, he's very beautiful,
isn't he?

568
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,123
Yes, I thought
you'd be interested.

569
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,751
This is-
he's blushing.

570
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,169
- Ooh!
- This is Omar Razaghi.

571
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,337
He's come to do research
on my brother's biography.

572
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,423
- Mucho gusto.
- Ah!

573
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,133
Then you must research me.

574
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,177
I can tell you
things about Jules

575
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,970
that a brother
could never know...

576
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,847
or a wife or even a mistress.

577
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,477
You should write his life,
his and Pete's.

578
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,271
That a more interesting story,
yeah.

579
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,481
Go away.
Go away.

580
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,149
- Thank you.
- I go. I go.

581
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,110
You should come
to Las Golondrinas.

582
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,628
Have a sausage.

583
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,004
Is it pork?

584
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,172
Maybe.

585
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,340
I don't know.

586
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:59,179
You don't drink;
you hardly eat meat.

587
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,515
Um... well, as I said before,

588
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,682
I know I can trust you.

589
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,017
I feel I can ask you
for your help

590
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,394
as you're asking for mine.

591
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,064
Like I said, I'll do anything.

592
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,066
Wait, wait,
this is non-literary.

593
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,735
It's nothing to do
with the biography.

594
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,071
When our mother-that is,
Jules' mother, my mother-

595
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,073
when our mother arrived here
as a refugee,

596
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,284
she brought with her from
Germany some valuable things,

597
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,911
her jewelry.

598
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,080
Now, I have her jewelry.

599
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,124
And I would like
to dispose of it,

600
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:32,462
and I would like you to help me
dispose of it.

601
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,755
Is it legal?

602
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,923
Is what legal?

603
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,592
Taking these things
out of the country?

604
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,469
No, it's moral.

605
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,804
They're my things.

606
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,639
They were my mother's.

607
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,267
When she arrived here,
she hid them away.

608
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,768
Because of her experiences
in Germany,

609
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,936
she trusted no one.

610
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,896
She didn't feel safe anywhere.

611
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,482
Outside of this cocoon
that they built here,

612
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:56,153
why, she and my father
didn't feel safe on this planet.

613
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,782
So after her death,
very shortly after my father's,

614
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,117
I found the jewels.

615
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,953
Do Arden and Caroline know
about them?

616
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,121
Nope.

617
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,039
They know nothing
of that history.

618
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,624
Even Caroline
hardly knew my mother.

619
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:14,129
She certainly knew nothing
of what was precious to her.

620
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,964
So I took the jewels.

621
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,009
I felt I could assume
that they were mine

622
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,971
as Caroline, in due course,
felt free to take what was hers.

623
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,556
From what your mother left?

624
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:28,476
With Caroline,
it was what my brother left.

625
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,728
Have you never thought,

626
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,564
never suspected that
there might be another book?

627
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,815
Other than The Gondola?

628
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,442
Mm-hmm.

629
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:39,571
It is well known, Jules Gund
wrote only that one book.

630
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,825
Well, he was working
on another one when he died.

631
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,078
It is my theory that he died,
or killed himself,

632
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,332
because he couldn't...

633
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,167
couldn't write anymore.

634
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,752
Or because of what
he was writing

635
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,755
or trying to write.

636
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,465
A psychological impasse.

637
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,634
Caroline has the manuscript?

638
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,261
I don't know.
You have to ask her.

639
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,679
But that is not the subject

640
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,848
of our present little talk,
is it?

641
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,099
My jewels.

642
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,518
My need for money.

643
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,895
Ah, here's Pete.

644
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,532
Hail to thee!

645
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,240
Come upstairs.
Follow me.

646
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,533
I want to show you something.

647
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,873
It is not for myself
that I need the money;

648
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,041
it is for Pete,

649
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:18,712
who may be free to leave me.

650
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,297
Does he want to leave you?

651
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,589
He should.

652
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,385
He still has a chance at
a better life than with me here.

653
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,554
You know, in order to bring him
here to Uruguay,

654
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,223
I had to adopt him.

655
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,559
Legally, he is my son.

656
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:42,610
Come and sit down, please.

657
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,739
I'll do what you ask.

658
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,949
Even though it's illegal
and dangerous?

659
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,910
I think
it's the right thing to do.

660
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,747
If you can trust me
not to screw it up.

661
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,623
Ah, we shall see.

662
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,460
Please, sit down.

663
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,627
So here's the treasure.

664
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,755
Some of it is mixed up
with my father's.

665
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,673
That's my father's watch.

666
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,134
Mother used to keep them
locked in the safe,

667
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,679
but sometimes she'd take it out
and wear it for me to show me.

668
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:10,889
And, uh...

669
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,267
I was her favorite, you know,
her firstborn,

670
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,269
her Adam, she called me.

671
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,190
Of course,
Jules could never get over that.

672
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,150
She would show me
how she wore them

673
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,362
and where.

674
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,781
This at the opera.

675
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,616
She had much smaller wrists
than mine.

676
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,785
- Wow.
- It's beautiful.

677
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,994
Go on, you can take it.

678
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,123
It's all right.

679
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:43,004
And these at the Burgtheater.

680
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:47,133
Isn't that beautiful?

681
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:50,845
Oh, yes, and this little horse
was for the races.

682
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:54,641
And she'd wear this
attached to her cloche hat.

683
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,428
It's me, Omar Razaghi.

684
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,934
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

685
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,519
I'm just having my breakfast.

686
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,814
Come in.

687
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,529
Oh.
No, thank you.

688
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,206
You don't have to say
anything nice about it.

689
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,833
No, I like it.
It's very interesting.

690
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,418
It's only a copy.

691
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,587
That's all I do nowadays,
is copies,

692
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,088
copy the masters.

693
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,339
It's safer.

694
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,593
That way,
I don't reveal anything.

695
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,636
It's what art does,

696
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,929
even biography.

697
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,890
Especially biography.

698
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,809
I would be very discreet.

699
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,437
I would absolutely
respect your wishes

700
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,938
as to what to reveal.

701
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,615
What if I were to tell you
that Jules explicitly said

702
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:37,285
he didn't want a biography
of himself?

703
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,621
He wrote it to me in a letter.

704
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,748
I suppose
you'd want to see that letter.

705
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:42,916
Well, yes.

706
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,542
I'd like to very much.

707
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,503
And why
would I show it to you?

708
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,005
I don't know anything about you,

709
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:54,469
no more than you know about me
or ever will.

710
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:58,598
What if I were to ask you,
have you ever been in love,

711
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:02,560
passionately in love?

712
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,648
See, you can't answer me.

713
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,899
You're not sure.

714
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,317
I am sure.

715
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:13,404
Do you have a girlfriend?

716
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,739
A partner?

717
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,075
Why do you want to know?

718
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,577
Are you romantically involved?

719
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,538
Yes.

720
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,164
I suppose I am.

721
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,499
Suppose?

722
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,001
That doesn't sound very
positive, let alone passionate.

723
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,837
We've been together two years.

724
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,590
Her name is Deirdre.

725
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,509
If it weren't for her,
I wouldn't be here.

726
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:38,429
I mean, here in Uruguay.

727
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,015
I would have accepted
your decision.

728
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,183
I would have given up.

729
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,353
I see.

730
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:48,356
Sit.

731
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:51,901
So it is your friend Deirdre

732
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,153
who made you come
to change our minds.

733
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,780
And what if
you can't change our minds?

734
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,031
What will she think?

735
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,200
She'll think you failed.

736
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,368
Yes.

737
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,120
And she'd be right.

738
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,663
I will have failed.

739
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,540
Sometimes it's good to fail,

740
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,125
to try but to fail.

741
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,793
There's nothing ignoble in that.

742
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:09,961
You don't understand.

743
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,379
Everything depends on it:

744
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,298
my job, my career,

745
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,925
maybe my relationship
with my girlfriend.

746
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,390
You're so young.

747
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,559
Are you sure that's
what you want your life to be

748
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,478
forever and ever:

749
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,523
that job, that career,

750
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,942
that girlfriend?

751
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:41,659
I'll show you
a real picture I painted.

752
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,162
It's Jules, only it's not him,

753
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,914
not as he really was,
which only I knew.

754
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,917
You don't see it
because I couldn't paint it.

755
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:54,922
I wasn't good enough
to paint it.

756
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,884
I suppose now you'll write
how the widow of Jules Gund

757
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,927
is sitting
in a south American jungle

758
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:03,598
painting atrocious paintings
and slowly going mad

759
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,058
or not so slowly.

760
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,102
I promise to write nothing
you don't want me to write.

761
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,104
Point is,
I want you to write nothing.

762
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,856
If you could just give me
one reason.

763
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,107
I don't have a reason.

764
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,276
As anyone will tell you,
I am an unreasonable person.

765
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,778
Jules himself
would have told you that

766
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:17,945
if he'd still been here.

767
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,114
In fact,
it's the very word he used

768
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,784
when he felt I wasn't
being accommodating enough

769
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,452
to his arrangements.

770
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,454
"You're so unreasonable,
Caroline."

771
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,622
I'm sorry.

772
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,040
I shouldn't have come here.

773
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,958
Don't apologize.

774
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,211
No, it's good sometimes
to hear another voice.

775
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,379
I was beginning to think

776
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,005
that apart from
our little group here,

777
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,924
there was no one else
left in the world.

778
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,876
Do you want to hear
how Arden met Jules?

779
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,086
Yes.

780
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,380
- Omar doesn't want
to know that at all.

781
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:21,134
He's writing a book;
he has to know everything.

782
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,470
Mm-hmm.

783
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:28,891
Um... I was traveling
around Spain

784
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:32,395
when I met some people
going to Uruguay.

785
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,480
So I went with them,

786
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,316
and they turned out
to be a missionary group

787
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:41,404
sent to convert
the heathen of south America.

788
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,949
Don't laugh.

789
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,578
Our name was joyful noise.

790
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:54,667
And we went around in a bus
and gave concerts in the street.

791
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,169
We never drew much of a crowd,

792
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,839
but people listened
very politely.

793
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,257
But by the time we'd finished,

794
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,926
there was usually
only one or two left.

795
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:07,054
But we went right on singing
and playing.

796
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:11,601
Arden shook the tambourine.

797
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:16,606
Anyway, one day,
Jules stopped to listen.

798
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:21,235
And when we were through,
he came up to me and said,

799
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,779
"What are you doing?

800
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,281
And why are you doing it?"

801
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,074
So I stopped.

802
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,493
And then I was born.

803
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,912
Well,
not quite so quickly, darling.

804
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,080
Nine months later, anyway.

805
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,962
I'm packing a picnic lunch.

806
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,131
Why are you going on a picnic?

807
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,717
I'm taking Omar
to show him the gondola.

808
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:30,137
Why?

809
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,056
As if that gondola
isn't the most ludicrous

810
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,642
of all the ludicrous
collected items here.

811
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:35,810
I don't feel that.

812
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:39,313
No...

813
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:43,818
You've changed your mind
about the biography.

814
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,320
Well, haven't you?

815
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,324
Why shouldn't he
write the biography?

816
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,659
He seems-

817
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,996
he's just the right person
to understand Jules.

818
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,664
In what way
is he the right person?

819
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,833
Because he's good-looking
and charming

820
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,919
and because he's charmed you?

821
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,590
What is it?

822
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,133
I'm sorry.

823
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:11,095
It's just that what we decided
before still stands for me.

824
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,763
Maybe I shouldn't tell you this.

825
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,850
Tell me what?

826
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,810
Do you know
he's in love with someone?

827
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,357
I didn't know that.

828
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,942
He told me he has a fiance.

829
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,110
Maybe they're not engaged,

830
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,321
but he has
a romantic attachment.

831
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,948
Why are you telling me this?

832
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,326
Because I thought
you should know.

833
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,536
It has nothing to do
with anything.

834
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:40,291
I never said that it had,
but I wouldn't blame you.

835
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,500
You're lonely.

836
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,128
I'm not lonely.

837
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,297
Or maybe I am
and I didn't know it

838
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,883
until there was a new person.

839
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:54,055
When do we ever see anyone
or get to talk to anyone?

840
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,806
And now-

841
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,142
why are you talking to me
like this?

842
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,852
Why do you want to hurt me?

843
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:03,022
I don't want to hurt you.

844
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,691
I never wanted to hurt you.

845
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,402
Hola!

846
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,738
So you're off
to see the gondola.

847
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,073
Oh, yes.

848
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,743
You'll be coming with us?

849
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,663
I've been there.

850
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,916
Mmm.

851
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,168
Maybe we shouldn't go.

852
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,419
It's a long way.

853
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,923
Uh, well, if you're not
feeling up to it.

854
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,759
Well, if you're not allowed
to write the biography,

855
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,552
there's no point in going.

856
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,055
And Caroline
won't change her mind.

857
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,265
That's the way she is.

858
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,935
She has a much stronger
character than I have.

859
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,103
That's not true.

860
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,437
Oh, but it is.

861
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,730
Jules used to say that

862
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:48,234
any breeze could come
and blow me any which way.

863
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,903
But actually,
why shouldn't we go?

864
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,113
Right.

865
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,614
Why shouldn't we?

866
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,544
Whoa.

867
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,270
Who won?

868
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,938
We did.

869
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,612
I have to go find Arden.

870
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,448
She is showing Omar
the gondola.

871
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,615
Without me?

872
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,325
They'll take you another time.

873
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,286
What if Omar goes away?

874
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,662
Is he going away?

875
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:45,166
Do you want him to stay?

876
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,043
Definitely.

877
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,841
Do you live alone?

878
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,509
Yes.

879
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,471
But you have a girlfriend.

880
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:02,141
Yes.
I do.

881
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,226
What's her name?

882
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,519
Her name is Deirdre.

883
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:10,024
She teaches
at the same university.

884
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,650
What does she teach?

885
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,487
Literature, like me.

886
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,990
She's a good teacher.

887
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,701
Much better than I'll ever be.

888
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:24,163
The great Russians
and German poets.

889
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,750
Sorry, I'm being rude.

890
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,668
I'm not used to meeting
new people,

891
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:34,090
so I don't know
how to behave anymore.

892
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,133
I shouldn't ask you
all those questions.

893
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,220
But think of all the questions
I want to ask you.

894
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:45,184
Is all of this your land?

895
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:48,938
Pete keeps trying
to make us sell some of it,

896
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:53,109
or at least lease it
for a vineyard or something.

897
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,693
And we could do with the money,

898
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,488
but you see how we all are.

899
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:08,249
There's no quicksand here,
is there?

900
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,376
A swamp you could sink into?

901
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:13,462
Oh, well, yes,
there's lots of swamps.

902
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:14,922
So watch out.

903
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,931
What's wrong?

904
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,976
I...

905
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,812
I feel a bit strange.

906
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,438
Can't be the altitude.

907
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,774
Oh, no, we're at sea level.

908
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,776
Maybe you're just hungry.

909
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:36,944
Come on.

910
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,738
Maybe.

911
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,615
I want you to know,

912
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,994
I've changed my mind
about the biography.

913
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,540
Why should I be afraid
of stirring up bad memories?

914
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,708
There aren't any.

915
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,668
There's Portia

916
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:56,630
and this lovely place
for her to grow up in.

917
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,966
I want you to write the book.

918
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,385
Like Adam, I'm on your side.

919
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,387
I give you my-what is it?

920
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,764
My-my authorization.

921
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:16,233
You know, I came here
to write one kind of book.

922
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,776
No, thanks.

923
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:25,993
And now it's turning
into something different.

924
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:30,831
Like, it's no longer
about Jules

925
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:34,001
but about you-all of you.

926
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,670
And your life here

927
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:39,840
and even about me here with you.

928
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,176
Does that make sense?

929
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,553
No? It doesn't?

930
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,265
Well, not entirely,
but you said you were feeling...

931
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,147
Oh.

932
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,671
- May I get in?
- Yeah.

933
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,969
It needs painting.

934
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,387
I keep wanting to do it.

935
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,554
I'll help you.

936
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,556
I'd like to do that.

937
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,643
Caroline hates the gondola
more than anything.

938
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,603
I don't know why.

939
00:54:56,293 --> 00:55:00,921
What's she like,
Deirdre?

940
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:05,759
She's very determined.

941
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,262
Very strong personality.

942
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:12,224
She decides what needs
to be done and does it.

943
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,767
That's how I'd want to be.

944
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,519
Well, so would I.

945
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,062
I don't suppose
I'll ever manage it.

946
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:19,565
Me neither.

947
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,255
- Can you help me get out?
- Oh, sure.

948
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,578
More, more.

949
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,210
Portia.

950
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:24,505
Pete, I wish
you wouldn't let her do this.

951
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,714
You're not even protected.

952
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,926
- You want to help?
- No.

953
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,472
Gracias.

954
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,057
- Can't I do it?
- No.

955
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,934
Certainly not.
You're not to climb up there.

956
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,143
- I'll do it.
- Not at all.

957
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,645
- Can I help?
- Sure.

958
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:42,940
Take the net
up the other ladder.

959
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,942
I'll take that.

960
00:56:55,787 --> 00:57:00,040
Portia, stay away
from the bees.

961
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,167
Pull the net towards you.

962
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:06,713
- Let me get higher.
- Okay.

963
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,382
- A little more.
- Okay.

964
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,971
Ow!

965
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,139
Careful.

966
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,475
Omar.

967
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,643
Ow!

968
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,563
- Omar!
- Omar!

969
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:23,772
thud!

970
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,152
No!

971
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,113
Omar?

972
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,865
Omar.

973
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,701
Oh, Omar.

974
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,453
Omar, the doctor's
made a mistake.

975
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,081
He thinks I'm your girlfriend.

976
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:53,964
Can you hear me?

977
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:58,635
Can you feel me?

978
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,137
But it's all right.

979
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,473
I found Deirdre's phone number
in your book.

980
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,852
I left a message on her machine.

981
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:11,565
Maybe she'll come soon,
and then everything-

982
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,983
can you hear me?

983
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,736
Do you know what I'm saying?

984
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:19,489
Deirdre's coming.

985
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,950
Oh, please blink.

986
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,187
No way.

987
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,811
Let me just show you
your bedroom and bathroom.

988
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,939
Did you know Omar was allergic
to bee sting?

989
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,148
I did not.

990
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:38,985
But I'm not surprised.

991
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:50,997
Are those gauchos?

992
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,165
No.

993
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,459
Oh, yes.
Gauchos.

994
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:58,338
Cowboys.

995
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,340
There's something
I must tell you.

996
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:01,842
No, thanks.

997
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,177
The doctor, Dr. Pereira,

998
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:08,724
he's taken very good care
of Omar, but, um...

999
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,977
he's made a silly mistake.

1000
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:16,273
He thinks I'm Omar's lover.

1001
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:18,650
Oh.

1002
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,527
It's the sort of thing
he would think.

1003
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:21,987
He's Latin American.

1004
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,322
They see the world
in a certain way.

1005
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:27,534
But I didn't correct him.

1006
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,327
Why not?

1007
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:34,332
As I said, Dr. Pereira
is the way men are here.

1008
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,586
They like to think
of men and women involved,

1009
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,963
romantically involved.

1010
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,215
I thought that
if the doctor thinks that,

1011
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:46,428
that Omar is loved-
that I love him-

1012
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:50,140
then he would
take very special care of him.

1013
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,308
Moo!

1014
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,018
But of course,
now that you're here...

1015
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:55,437
No, that's all right.

1016
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,105
Whatever works best for Omar,

1017
01:02:57,231 --> 01:03:00,192
I don't care
what a doctor thinks.

1018
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,360
Let him think I'm Omar's sister.

1019
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,488
Oh, you don't look
like his sister,

1020
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:08,200
nothing like.

1021
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,470
He's in this ward,

1022
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,638
on the right.

1023
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:30,806
I'll wait outside.

1024
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,265
Okay, thank you.

1025
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:07,717
Mm.

1026
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:11,137
My god.

1027
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,807
Why are you here?

1028
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,726
Arden called me.

1029
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,311
You were in a coma.

1030
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:25,735
Has Arden been visiting you?

1031
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,988
Have you met her?

1032
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,739
Of course,
I'm staying in the house.

1033
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,242
Don't you like it?

1034
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,785
Isnt it amazing,

1035
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:36,997
the house and everything?

1036
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:41,251
Do you remember what happened?

1037
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:44,421
With the bees?

1038
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,673
No.

1039
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:50,468
I don't remember anything
that happened that day clearly.

1040
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,185
Are you a friend
of our poor Omar?

1041
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,438
Yes, I'm very worried
about Omar.

1042
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,689
You must not worry.

1043
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,357
You are too beautiful to worry.

1044
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:08,028
All the women who visit Omar
are beautiful.

1045
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:11,114
His recovery
has nothing to do with me.

1046
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,034
It is the beauty of women
that cured him.

1047
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:37,641
Where did you
get these pajamas?

1048
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:38,892
I don't know.

1049
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:42,228
I woke up wearing them.

1050
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,981
Did Arden bring them?

1051
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,900
They may have belonged to Jules.

1052
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:49,819
You are wearing
Jules Gund's pajamas.

1053
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,239
Mmm.

1054
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,992
Do you think she's changed
her mind about authorization?

1055
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,495
Well, I'm not very sure
about Caroline.

1056
01:05:58,621 --> 01:05:59,871
We'll see about her.

1057
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:01,331
What about Arden?

1058
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,209
She's leaning my way.

1059
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:07,253
Our way.

1060
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,381
And the other one,
the brother?

1061
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:11,716
- Adam?
- Mm-hmm.

1062
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:13,426
He's always been on my side.

1063
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:15,428
And he says
he'll help me with Caroline,

1064
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:16,763
and I said I'd help him.

1065
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:18,098
Help him with what?

1066
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,766
What can you help him with?

1067
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,434
It's nothing, really.

1068
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,478
He just wants me
to carry something for him

1069
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:25,397
when I go back to the States.

1070
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:26,940
Carry what?

1071
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:30,568
Just some things.

1072
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:32,445
What things?

1073
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:33,613
Some...

1074
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:35,573
pieces of jewelry.

1075
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,867
Stuff like that.

1076
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,035
Jewelry?

1077
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:42,789
Did you say you would?

1078
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:45,792
Omar, you're crazy.

1079
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:47,085
It's smuggling.

1080
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:48,712
He's asking you
to smuggle for him.

1081
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,922
You'll go to jail.

1082
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:53,008
He wouldn't ask me
to do anything criminal.

1083
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,175
He's not that type.

1084
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:56,261
Anyone who asks you
to take something

1085
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,138
secretly out of the country
for him

1086
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,973
is that type.

1087
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,684
He's been very helpful to me
with the biography.

1088
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:03,935
And that's what I'm here for:

1089
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:05,937
to get authorization
for the biography.

1090
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,647
This is not the way to get it.

1091
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:09,733
I'm doing it my way.
Everything's fine.

1092
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,484
Everything is not fine, Omar.

1093
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:13,486
If it were, I wouldn't be here.

1094
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:14,779
I didn't ask you to come here.

1095
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,156
Oh, I'm sorry.

1096
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,992
I flew 5,000 miles
because you were in a coma.

1097
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,160
A coma!

1098
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,369
Stop.

1099
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,955
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

1100
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:27,292
I just-I wish you wouldn't
treat me like a baby.

1101
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,960
Then don't act like a baby.

1102
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:30,962
Don't agree to smuggle jewelry.

1103
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,422
Don't fall out of a tree.

1104
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,841
Falling out of a tree
was an accident.

1105
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:36,551
You know what I think
about accidents.

1106
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:38,970
Accidents happen to people,
Deirdre.

1107
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:42,891
We can't all be perfect
like you.

1108
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:45,810
I'm not perfect.

1109
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:48,730
I know I'm not perfect.

1110
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,023
I don't think I am.

1111
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,317
I'm just trying
to help you, Omar,

1112
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:56,488
because I love you.

1113
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:58,448
You really wish I hadn't come?

1114
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:01,451
No.

1115
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:02,744
Because I can leave.

1116
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,037
I can leave whenever you want.

1117
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,705
No.

1118
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:07,040
Want you to stay.

1119
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:17,884
Omar,
you've broken your wrist.

1120
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,345
Let me wipe the soup
off your face.

1121
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:38,238
Adam!

1122
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:45,245
So how is
our poor young friend?

1123
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,455
I hear he's recovering.

1124
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:50,083
His girlfriend has arrived

1125
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,793
to comfort him,

1126
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:55,004
and hopefully
to take him home.

1127
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,090
Where's Pete?

1128
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,591
Taking a shower.

1129
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:08,685
So...

1130
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:12,856
to what do I owe
this pleasure?

1131
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,566
It really is a pleasure,
you know?

1132
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:28,037
Well, here we are.

1133
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:31,457
To the pleasure of you.

1134
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:36,296
How sweet you are.

1135
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,797
Not bad.

1136
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:38,965
Not bad at all.

1137
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,800
Please, sit down.

1138
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,927
It's supposed to be
a cocktail.

1139
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,141
Cocktail.

1140
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,643
What a lovely word.

1141
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:52,353
If only one could drink it

1142
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,314
where a cocktail
should be drunk,

1143
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,399
sitting on a barstool

1144
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:59,777
somewhere dark, secluded.

1145
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:00,945
But liquor is liquor

1146
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:02,614
wherever you go in the world,
isn't it?

1147
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,491
It's a Manhattan,

1148
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:08,411
or half a Manhattan,
since you have no bourbon.

1149
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:09,829
A Manhattan.

1150
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:11,998
That's your Moscow.

1151
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:13,166
Hmm?

1152
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,168
"Oh, Olga, Olga,
let us go to Moscow.

1153
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,503
There's no place in the world
like Moscow."

1154
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:21,925
Adam, I want to ask you,

1155
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,676
do you think
I was wrong to stay here?

1156
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:26,095
What do you mean?

1157
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,598
You know what I mean.

1158
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:32,185
When Jules came back
with Arden.

1159
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,770
I didn't judge you.

1160
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,481
It was your affair and Jules'.

1161
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,191
She was so pathetic.

1162
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,859
It was as if he'd picked up
a stray kitten

1163
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:42,779
and brought it home,

1164
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,489
a pregnant kitten.

1165
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:46,699
Yeah.

1166
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:49,118
Now I think she's changed
her mind about the biography,

1167
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,536
as you have.

1168
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:51,746
I never opposed it.

1169
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:52,914
Why should we?

1170
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,874
A biography is nothing,

1171
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,876
an account of the facts
written by,

1172
01:10:57,002 --> 01:11:00,046
well, just for all we know,
some academic hack.

1173
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:01,714
Though I hope not.

1174
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,800
Maybe he'll surprise us.

1175
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,218
Poor boy.

1176
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:06,803
What a thing to happen.

1177
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,471
A bee, can you imagine?

1178
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,139
It's his own fault.

1179
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,307
Why did he come here?

1180
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:13,977
He has no business here,
hack or not.

1181
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:17,146
Supposing Jules
had written something himself.

1182
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,649
Had he?

1183
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,109
Yes, he had.

1184
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,402
I thought so.

1185
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:25,321
And it would have to be
personal, autobiographical,

1186
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:27,824
'cause Jules
was not an inventive writer.

1187
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,159
And as The Gondola
was about our parents' lives,

1188
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:31,828
this other manuscript-

1189
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,663
Which no longer exists.

1190
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,498
Which no longer exists...

1191
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:39,669
would be about his life with you
and Arden in this place.

1192
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,422
And for all I know,

1193
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:45,842
even about Pete and me.

1194
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:50,179
How could any outsider
understand this place

1195
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:54,058
or what it was like
to all live here together

1196
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:57,603
or what it's like now
without him?

1197
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,272
Yes.

1198
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,109
You know,
you could leave tomorrow

1199
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:04,652
if you wanted to,

1200
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:06,779
any time you choose.

1201
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:09,907
You very well know,
I have no money.

1202
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:12,076
How could I get
the fare together?

1203
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:13,745
Don't you think I haven't
thought of it,

1204
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:16,122
that I don't sit up there
pretending to paint,

1205
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:19,459
brooding over
where I might be instead?

1206
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:20,626
I need a real drink.

1207
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:23,629
How about you?

1208
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,298
- Scotch.
- Yeah.

1209
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,800
Not getting very far
on just vermouth.

1210
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,098
Adam, do you like life?

1211
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,977
Well, I wouldn't like
to live forever.

1212
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:42,106
But um, for a little while,
yes, but...

1213
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:44,275
yes, I like it.

1214
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:45,818
But living here?

1215
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:47,487
You wouldn't rather
be somewhere else,

1216
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:48,654
New York, London?

1217
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,823
- No.
- Why not?

1218
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:52,617
Because you have
to care about-

1219
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:55,661
or at least pretend to care
about everything:

1220
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,122
politics, fashion, culture.

1221
01:12:58,248 --> 01:12:59,499
It's just exhausting.

1222
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,210
What I wouldn't give
to see some new painters,

1223
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:05,963
a new play, go to the opera.

1224
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,508
Yes, I know.

1225
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:11,344
To Moscow, Olga.

1226
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:14,972
Yeah.

1227
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,682
This is a very potent drink.

1228
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:20,103
Perhaps I should not
have indulged in a refill.

1229
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:26,526
Tell me something.
Was there ever a letter?

1230
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:27,735
Did Jules really write to you

1231
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:29,445
saying he didn't want
a biography?

1232
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:30,613
No.

1233
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,073
But I know
he wouldn't have wanted it.

1234
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,282
How would you know that?

1235
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,992
Because he destroyed
the manuscript.

1236
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,162
He destroyed it himself?

1237
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:39,497
He wanted no one to know

1238
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:42,333
what only concerned himself
and me.

1239
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:44,168
So no matter
what you and Arden decide,

1240
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:47,213
I shall never allow
this biography to be written,

1241
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:49,632
even if he gets stung
by 100 bees.

1242
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:02,603
Excuse me.

1243
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:05,064
Can you tell me the way
to the mill house, please?

1244
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,567
You have to go back this way

1245
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:11,612
and then
through the bamboo grove.

1246
01:14:11,738 --> 01:14:12,905
Through there.

1247
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:14,073
Thank you.

1248
01:14:18,912 --> 01:14:20,538
What do you think of her?

1249
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:22,457
What do you?

1250
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:25,585
I don't see her with Omar,

1251
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,044
her personality.

1252
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:30,173
But I don't know either of them
very well.

1253
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,467
What do you think?

1254
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,479
Will you miss them
when they're gone?

1255
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:46,564
No.

1256
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:48,649
I mean Omar.

1257
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:49,984
Will you miss Omar?

1258
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:57,992
Do you love him?

1259
01:14:58,118 --> 01:15:01,496
No.

1260
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:07,293
No, I don't love Omar.

1261
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:10,046
What?
Why did you ask me that?

1262
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:13,216
Omar didn't say anything to you
about me

1263
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,301
when you went to see him
in the hospital?

1264
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,094
No,
I just thought,

1265
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:18,971
if I were you...

1266
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:22,725
If you were me, what?

1267
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,810
I might love him.

1268
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:28,564
Well, it's as you said, Pete.

1269
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,899
We hardly know him.

1270
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:32,568
He's only been here
for a short time,

1271
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,153
he has a girlfriend,

1272
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,988
and he's leaving soon.

1273
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:38,908
The doctor says he can travel
in a few days.

1274
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,993
They're both leaving.

1275
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:42,161
I'm glad.

1276
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:04,433
Mr. Gund?

1277
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,644
Who calls?

1278
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:07,853
Hello.

1279
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,355
Hello.

1280
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:11,691
I could come back another time
if you're not free.

1281
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,109
Not free?

1282
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:14,860
As you can see, I'm quite free,

1283
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,529
hopelessly free,

1284
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,948
for the rest of my life.

1285
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:22,326
This is Jesus,
and you must be, uh... Deborah.

1286
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:23,494
Deirdre.

1287
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,037
Deirdre.

1288
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:27,373
May I offer you something?

1289
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:29,667
Oh, just some mineral water
if you have it.

1290
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:31,627
Mineral water, hmm.

1291
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:32,962
How about a dry martini?

1292
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:35,298
No.

1293
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,465
No, thank you.

1294
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,385
So you must be,
um... Omar's paramour.

1295
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,137
It's so difficult
finding the right word

1296
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:42,305
to describe a relationship.

1297
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:44,640
At least my relationships.

1298
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:47,393
They're all too complicated
for mere words.

1299
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,228
Paramour
is not the right word.

1300
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:53,149
I wouldn't use it to describe
Omar's and my relationship.

1301
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,860
Do sit down, my dear.
You look as if you might bolt.

1302
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:58,821
I've offended you, no doubt.

1303
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:01,157
Good.

1304
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,325
You know, in my youth,

1305
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,577
I used to call my partners
my paramours.

1306
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:07,371
It's such a lovely word
to describe a lovely situation.

1307
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:11,083
And as a result, I remained
a youth for a very long time.

1308
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:13,586
The aging process was retarded,
but alas,

1309
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:16,255
one morning I woke up and-

1310
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:18,924
I was an old man
who talks too much.

1311
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,760
But it is you who've come
to talk to me, yes,

1312
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:24,889
I have no doubt,
about the authorization.

1313
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:28,100
As you've probably heard,
I'm on Omar's side.

1314
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:30,436
We have made our arrangement.

1315
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:32,229
That is what I've come
to talk to you about,

1316
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:34,231
what you call an arrangement.

1317
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:35,399
So he has told you about it?

1318
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:40,112
He has,
and I consider it blackmail.

1319
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:42,615
You said you had made a bargain
with Omar.

1320
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:44,909
You asked him to smuggle
certain items out of the country

1321
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:47,119
in return for your help
in getting him authorization.

1322
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:48,537
I...

1323
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:49,914
call that blackmail.

1324
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,749
"Smuggle," "blackmail."

1325
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,960
My, my, you do have
a romantic imagination.

1326
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:56,587
I will not allow him to do it.

1327
01:17:56,713 --> 01:17:58,381
And besides,
he's the wrong person for it.

1328
01:17:58,507 --> 01:17:59,548
I agree with you.

1329
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,217
Omar is certainly not
the right person.

1330
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:04,178
Unlike you, he is not practical.

1331
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:10,101
But you will be returning
to the United States as well?

1332
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:12,186
Are you trying to make
a little bargain with me now?

1333
01:18:12,312 --> 01:18:13,354
Please, do sit down.

1334
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,939
I'm enjoying your company.
Sit down.

1335
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:16,482
You're so invigorating.

1336
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:18,401
It's a pity
you have no sense of adventure.

1337
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,277
I certainly have a sense
of what's legal

1338
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:21,779
and what is not.

1339
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:24,532
You know,

1340
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:26,283
one day, you will regret this.

1341
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:29,620
You will regret having come
all the way to south America

1342
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:33,791
and not involving yourself
in what you encounter here.

1343
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:35,668
You will think, "Oh, why?

1344
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:39,130
Oh, why
did I not smuggle those things?"

1345
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:41,257
So it is smuggling.

1346
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:45,803
Well, you read too many books.

1347
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:47,847
Or perhaps you don't even
read books anymore.

1348
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,975
You probably just read
criticism of books.

1349
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:52,476
Mr. Gund,

1350
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:54,979
you must consider your little
bargain with Omar dissolved.

1351
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,147
Neither he nor I

1352
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:58,023
will be able to help you
in this business.

1353
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,233
We'll have to get Caroline

1354
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:01,235
somehow to agree
to authorization without you.

1355
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:04,029
Mm-hmm.
How will you do that?

1356
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,740
We can try,

1357
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:07,575
honestly try,

1358
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,453
without resorting to bargains
and blackmail.

1359
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:12,747
Hmm.

1360
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:16,417
It seems a bit stupid to me,
if I may be so blunt,

1361
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:19,086
to alienate me like this.

1362
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:21,714
After all, what is stopping me
changing my mind?

1363
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,048
Oh.

1364
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,050
Excuse me, I...

1365
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:27,344
I understood
you wanted a biography.

1366
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:32,933
I didn't think your support
was variable or could be bought.

1367
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:36,353
Gracias, Jesus.

1368
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,774
Gracias.

1369
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:43,402
Well, I admire your gumption.

1370
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:45,738
But I think it best

1371
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:49,617
that this situation be resolved
between Omar and myself.

1372
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:51,410
The arrangement was made
with Omar,

1373
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:54,121
so it is up to Omar
to dissolve it.

1374
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:56,457
I have enjoyed our little chat.

1375
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:01,170
Please excuse me.

1376
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:37,498
Mrs. Gund.

1377
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:46,841
These are lovely.

1378
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:49,552
Are you fond of art?

1379
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:50,761
It's not my field,

1380
01:20:50,887 --> 01:20:55,224
but some paintings
I like very much.

1381
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,392
I have been hoping to talk-

1382
01:20:56,518 --> 01:21:01,146
What kind of paintings
do you like very much?

1383
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,148
The impressionists,

1384
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:06,861
Cezanne and Monet, van Gogh.

1385
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:08,654
Perhaps they weren't
all impressionists,

1386
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:13,075
or were they?

1387
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:15,828
As far you need be concerned,
they were.

1388
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:19,790
May I speak to you?

1389
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,333
Of course you may.

1390
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:23,836
Sit.

1391
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:25,462
Sit.

1392
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:29,300
May I?

1393
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:33,262
Of course.

1394
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:34,513
Little to the left, please.

1395
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:47,776
I'd like to assure you

1396
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,945
that Omar intends
to work very closely

1397
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:52,615
with you all on the biography.

1398
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,366
If you knew what this is

1399
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:55,701
for Omar,

1400
01:21:55,827 --> 01:21:57,620
how very much depends on it
for him

1401
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,788
to get authorization
and write this book.

1402
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:03,792
I am not concerned
with Omar's needs.

1403
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:05,294
I have other...

1404
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:12,301
different allegiances.

1405
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:13,552
To Jules Gund?

1406
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:15,638
I don't think this is really
any of your business.

1407
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:16,972
But yes, to my husband.

1408
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:25,648
And to myself, for that matter.

1409
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:28,067
Why are you
withholding authorization?

1410
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,778
Perhaps if you told me,
I could address your concerns.

1411
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:31,987
Shh.

1412
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:40,663
Do you recognize it?

1413
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:42,665
It sounds familiar.

1414
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:46,418
It's Poulenc,

1415
01:22:46,544 --> 01:22:51,382
Tres Lent et Calme.

1416
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:56,679
I hope
you will consider reconsidering.

1417
01:22:56,805 --> 01:23:00,516
I have already discussed this
with Omar.

1418
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,643
I have told him more than once

1419
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:04,603
that I will not
change my decision.

1420
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:07,106
But Arden has changed hers.

1421
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:10,442
Miss Langdon has her reasons;
I have mine.

1422
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:17,116
Isn't it marvelous?

1423
01:23:21,579 --> 01:23:23,956
I think I'm wasting your time.

1424
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:27,126
Time is not a very precious
commodity around here.

1425
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:29,628
But you've made up your mind.

1426
01:23:29,754 --> 01:23:32,131
I made it up long ago,

1427
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:34,383
long before Omar arrived.

1428
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:38,137
Then there's really no point
in me or Omar talking to you.

1429
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,596
Not about that subject,

1430
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:43,809
but we could talk
about something else.

1431
01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:45,811
Art?

1432
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:49,106
But that's not your field.

1433
01:23:49,232 --> 01:23:51,483
Music?

1434
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:54,153
Or is music
not your field either?

1435
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,824
But surely you like this.

1436
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:00,075
How could you not?

1437
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:07,249
No, thank you.

1438
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:34,568
But why do you need Omar?

1439
01:24:34,694 --> 01:24:36,487
I didn't want you to know.

1440
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,572
It was to be a secret.

1441
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:39,823
It was for you, you idiot.

1442
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:41,658
I wanted you to have the money.

1443
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:42,826
Why?

1444
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:44,328
For what?

1445
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:46,205
I have a good business
of my own.

1446
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:48,540
I don't need more money.
You do.

1447
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:49,708
I'm happy.

1448
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:51,210
What, here with me?

1449
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,629
I don't think you know much
about happiness, my friend.

1450
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:54,922
Do you?

1451
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:57,508
Oh, I gave up on all that
stuff a long time ago.

1452
01:24:57,634 --> 01:24:59,510
You pretend you have.

1453
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:02,096
Don't I make you happy,
at least sometimes?

1454
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:03,764
Yes, of course.

1455
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:08,060
So why are you trying
to send me away?

1456
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:10,437
Because I don't want you
wasting yourself on me.

1457
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:13,107
I'm an old man,

1458
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:16,193
"a paltry thing,
a tattered coat upon a stick."

1459
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:18,112
Make a life for yourself,

1460
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:20,781
for god's sake.

1461
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:22,741
Look at me.

1462
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:24,243
Go on, look.

1463
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:25,702
I'm looking.

1464
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:29,581
I'm 40 years old.

1465
01:25:29,707 --> 01:25:32,584
I've lived with you
for 25 years.

1466
01:25:34,754 --> 01:25:38,799
I don't want any other life.

1467
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:41,760
25 years.

1468
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:43,762
Hmm.

1469
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:45,889
You're a sweet boy.

1470
01:25:46,015 --> 01:25:48,267
And I've always loved you,
and I love you now.

1471
01:26:00,613 --> 01:26:04,241
But there is someone
who needs money to leave.

1472
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:08,036
Oh, Caroline, yes.

1473
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:14,459
Don't involve Omar in this.

1474
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:15,794
Hmm?

1475
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,505
I can get much better price
than he ever could.

1476
01:26:18,631 --> 01:26:21,466
If not in Montevideo,
then in Buenos Aires.

1477
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:22,634
You can?

1478
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:23,802
How?

1479
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:25,470
I have contacts.

1480
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:29,308
So how much do you think
you will make with these?

1481
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:32,311
Enough for
where she wants to be.

1482
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:34,771
Really?

1483
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:38,567
Supposing we exact
a small exchange with Caroline.

1484
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:41,904
Supposing the money
you make for her,

1485
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,323
she takes the cash and leaves.

1486
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:45,908
Quite a bit of cash.

1487
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,075
Yes.

1488
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,994
And in return
for that bit of cash,

1489
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,746
we could make a bargain
with her.

1490
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:52,748
I suggest
she might want to make over

1491
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:57,669
her part of Ocho Rios
to you.

1492
01:26:57,795 --> 01:27:00,255
You'd be 1/3 partner
with Portia and myself,

1493
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:01,423
and of course, as you know,

1494
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:03,592
we're more accommodating
than Caroline

1495
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:06,762
and more used to signing things.

1496
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:08,430
So perhaps you could,
if you want to,

1497
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:12,017
start one of
your moneymaking schemes.

1498
01:27:12,143 --> 01:27:15,771
Thousands of acres of soybeans

1499
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:18,982
blowing in the wind.

1500
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:20,317
My god.

1501
01:27:20,443 --> 01:27:23,820
How I'd make this place
work for us.

1502
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:26,073
Oh.

1503
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:42,839
I'm going to Las Golondrinas
for a few days.

1504
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:44,967
- I just wanted you to know.
- Why?

1505
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,677
I don't feel comfortable here.

1506
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:48,136
I want all these people
to go away.

1507
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,722
But as they only incapacitate
themselves and multiply,

1508
01:27:50,848 --> 01:27:52,224
I'm going away myself.

1509
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:53,892
Call me when the coast is clear.

1510
01:27:54,018 --> 01:27:55,727
I'll do no such thing.

1511
01:27:55,853 --> 01:27:57,604
Go if you want,
but don't give me orders.

1512
01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:59,064
Goodness.

1513
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:01,525
Sounds as if you're the one
who needs to get away from here.

1514
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:12,119
Caroline.

1515
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:13,912
I wonder
if Luis can get me there.

1516
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,876
Are you leaving
without talking to him,

1517
01:28:20,003 --> 01:28:21,044
to Omar?

1518
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:22,212
Omar.

1519
01:28:22,338 --> 01:28:23,380
Why should I talk to him?

1520
01:28:23,506 --> 01:28:24,548
I've talked a lot to him

1521
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:28,552
and to his
rather unpleasant girlfriend.

1522
01:28:28,678 --> 01:28:31,096
You're afraid that if you
stay, you'll change your mind.

1523
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:33,640
I'm afraid if I stay,
I'll lose my mind.

1524
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,399
"My dear Caroline,

1525
01:28:42,525 --> 01:28:44,568
"I have a confession to make.

1526
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:47,779
"I am a jewel thief.

1527
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:51,575
"I have secretly kept
all my mother's diamonds.

1528
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:54,786
"Graciously,
I beg you to absolve me

1529
01:28:54,912 --> 01:28:58,623
"by accepting them
from my guilty hands.

1530
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:01,585
Don't overdo it."

1531
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:02,753
"Forgive me, if you can,

1532
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:04,338
"and live happily
on the proceeds

1533
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:06,923
"wherever you may choose.

1534
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,301
"Pete and I have each other

1535
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:12,346
"and need almost nothing more.

1536
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:16,266
"But there is one fairly small
favor you can do for us.

1537
01:29:16,392 --> 01:29:18,852
"In return
for Mother's diamonds,

1538
01:29:18,978 --> 01:29:22,939
"would you relinquish
your 1/3 share of Ocho Rios?

1539
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:24,983
"Pete has great plans
for the estate

1540
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:27,944
"that I cannot even pretend
to understand.

1541
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:30,405
"A new chapter
will soon begin for you

1542
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:31,656
"and if, perchance,

1543
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,617
"something is weighing
on your conscience-

1544
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:35,786
"and who among us
is without blame?

1545
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:37,704
"Humanum errare est-

1546
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:40,749
"rid yourself of it
with one small gesture.

1547
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:44,211
"Allow the boy
to write the biography

1548
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:47,964
"yours is still
the one voice he needs.

1549
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:49,424
Adam."

1550
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:09,653
Where is everyone?

1551
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:12,155
They're busy
doing whatever they do,

1552
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:14,157
forging paintings,

1553
01:30:14,283 --> 01:30:16,159
raising killer bees, I guess,

1554
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:17,953
and smuggling jewels.

1555
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:23,542
Well,
can you please go find them

1556
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,460
and tell them we're back
from the hospital?

1557
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:32,175
Find whom?

1558
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:35,846
Arden... and everyone.

1559
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:37,264
Caroline.

1560
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:38,890
Caroline.

1561
01:30:39,016 --> 01:30:41,309
You certainly
need to speak to Caroline.

1562
01:30:57,326 --> 01:30:58,827
What are you drawing?

1563
01:31:13,926 --> 01:31:16,261
Are you finished?

1564
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:17,429
I'm sorry, Portia,

1565
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:19,598
but I need to talk to Omar.

1566
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:26,438
Run along.

1567
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:29,149
Can you believe it?

1568
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:30,775
Caroline has left.

1569
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:34,446
And without a word to us
about the authorization.

1570
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,323
I'll have to go after her
and speak to her.

1571
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:39,951
I think she's enjoying this.

1572
01:31:40,077 --> 01:31:42,204
These people are awful.

1573
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:47,626
If anyone speaks to Caroline,
it'll have to be me.

1574
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:51,505
I think I might be better
at handling a person like that.

1575
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:53,298
I don't want to handle anyone.

1576
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:56,843
I hate that attitude.

1577
01:31:56,969 --> 01:31:59,346
Omar,

1578
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:01,097
what's the matter with you?

1579
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:09,564
I'm sorry.

1580
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,942
I'm sorry, you've been ill.

1581
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:15,779
You've only just
come out of the hospital.

1582
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:17,864
You're not yourself.

1583
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:19,658
And really,
you're not in a fit state

1584
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:21,451
to go running
after crazy Caroline.

1585
01:32:21,577 --> 01:32:23,662
Please, Deirdre,

1586
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,080
leave it to me.

1587
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:26,248
Darling-

1588
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:27,624
Would you just let me rest?

1589
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:16,881
Omar, "Las Golondrinas"

1590
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:20,468
means little birds
that fly and sing.

1591
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:24,973
That is what we do here,
as you can see.

1592
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:28,059
Jules was always welcome here.

1593
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:30,812
He lived with his two women
at Ocho Rios,

1594
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:35,317
and sometimes
he had to come up for air...

1595
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:38,153
when Caroline
was too much for him.

1596
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:39,988
And Arden was too little.

1597
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:45,243
Don't you want to swim?

1598
01:33:45,369 --> 01:33:46,911
We have plenty of suits.

1599
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:48,246
Yes?

1600
01:33:48,372 --> 01:33:50,832
You don't have to put that arm
in the water, no?

1601
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,500
El bracito en el agua,
para que?

1602
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:53,668
No.

1603
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:57,130
Traele... traele, Wilson...

1604
01:33:57,256 --> 01:33:58,590
- No, no, no.
- Como no, no, no, no?

1605
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:01,259
Si.
Plunk! Plunk! Plunk!

1606
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:09,893
Jules was very, very attractive.

1607
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:11,770
And depressive, of course.

1608
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:14,439
But that made him
even more attractive,

1609
01:34:14,565 --> 01:34:17,609
like Hamlet
or someone out of Dostoyevsky.

1610
01:34:19,236 --> 01:34:22,781
He had the knack
of making each woman he met

1611
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:27,077
feel she was the only one
who truly understood him.

1612
01:34:27,203 --> 01:34:28,370
Only women.

1613
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:29,788
He didn't care for men,

1614
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:32,207
nor they for him.

1615
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:35,126
And he was writing this book,

1616
01:34:35,252 --> 01:34:38,338
another book
to make him even more famous.

1617
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:39,756
We thought it was thrilling.

1618
01:34:39,882 --> 01:34:42,008
Perhaps we were all in it.

1619
01:34:42,134 --> 01:34:45,804
And each one of us
thought she was his muse.

1620
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,765
And would go down in history,
no?

1621
01:34:55,064 --> 01:34:58,817
God knows
what she's telling him.

1622
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:00,360
Every woman who ever met Jules

1623
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:04,114
is convinced she understood him
better than I did,

1624
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,491
or Arden, for that matter.

1625
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:09,869
You know what I think?

1626
01:35:09,995 --> 01:35:13,206
That he wasn't writing a book
at all.

1627
01:35:13,332 --> 01:35:15,208
He was talking about it

1628
01:35:15,334 --> 01:35:17,544
to impress us,

1629
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:20,547
but he found he couldn't.

1630
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:24,968
And that made him-

1631
01:35:25,094 --> 01:35:26,469
he couldn't bear the thought

1632
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:29,889
of not being
a celebrated author anymore.

1633
01:35:30,015 --> 01:35:34,144
Admired and famous and...

1634
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:37,272
and everyone
hopelessly in love with him.

1635
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:41,776
Ah, Wilson.

1636
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:42,944
Seora.

1637
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:44,112
Gracias.

1638
01:35:48,617 --> 01:35:50,869
Permiso.

1639
01:35:52,621 --> 01:35:54,038
Tango.

1640
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:55,582
Tango.
Puedes.

1641
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:57,542
- Puedo.
- Puedes.

1642
01:35:57,668 --> 01:35:59,669
- Puedes.
- Puedo, puedo.

1643
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:09,846
Maybe we'll meet
in the States.

1644
01:36:09,972 --> 01:36:11,264
I'd like that very much,

1645
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:15,185
although maybe you prefer
to forget all about me.

1646
01:36:15,311 --> 01:36:17,437
I want to give you
a farewell present.

1647
01:36:17,563 --> 01:36:20,106
About the biography,
go ahead and write it.

1648
01:36:20,232 --> 01:36:23,443
Explain us to ourselves,
if you can.

1649
01:36:23,569 --> 01:36:24,944
I'll be interested

1650
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:28,573
to read your interpretation
or invention.

1651
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:34,788
I grant you my authorization.

1652
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,247
Isn't that what you wanted?

1653
01:36:36,373 --> 01:36:38,666
What you came here for?

1654
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:40,752
Of course.

1655
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:42,754
And I'm very grateful to you.

1656
01:36:45,925 --> 01:36:48,968
Deirdre anyway,
will be pleased.

1657
01:36:49,094 --> 01:36:51,805
But what about Jules' letter
that he didn't want a biography?

1658
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:53,264
Jules never wrote
such a letter.

1659
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:55,475
I made that up.

1660
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:58,812
But he did try
and write a second book.

1661
01:36:58,938 --> 01:37:01,105
There is a manuscript.
It does exist.

1662
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:04,859
No one's ever read it except me.

1663
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:06,027
Jules never finished it.

1664
01:37:06,153 --> 01:37:08,488
He couldn't.

1665
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:11,449
Shall I tell you
about the last scene?

1666
01:37:11,575 --> 01:37:14,786
The last he wrote
and then he couldn't go on?

1667
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:18,289
In this last scene, Arden and I
are in the gondola,

1668
01:37:18,415 --> 01:37:21,209
and we loathe each other
as we never did.

1669
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:23,753
Though, perhaps
that's what he was waiting for.

1670
01:37:23,879 --> 01:37:25,296
But in the gondola,

1671
01:37:25,422 --> 01:37:27,465
we have a terrible fight,

1672
01:37:27,591 --> 01:37:28,883
a physical fight.

1673
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:31,553
And I push Arden overboard.

1674
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:32,804
But you know what?

1675
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:34,806
The water isn't deep enough.

1676
01:37:34,932 --> 01:37:38,560
So I keep on pushing her down
and down.

1677
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:41,145
Did you intend to publish it?

1678
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:43,064
There were times
when I felt that I had to,

1679
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:45,483
that it was a responsibility,
a duty,

1680
01:37:45,609 --> 01:37:48,736
to literature, if that
doesn't sound too grandiose.

1681
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:52,490
I don't believe
any of us has such a duty.

1682
01:37:52,616 --> 01:37:55,326
I believe literature
takes its life from us,

1683
01:37:55,452 --> 01:37:56,995
not the other way around.

1684
01:37:57,121 --> 01:37:59,998
Is this the belief
of a professor of literature?

1685
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:04,752
Oh, I'm afraid
this is the other Omar,

1686
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:07,505
the misguided caliph
who burned all the books.

1687
01:38:07,631 --> 01:38:10,091
You know,
the entire library of Alexandria

1688
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:12,176
was fed into
the bathhouse boilers,

1689
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:15,138
700,000 papyrus scrolls.

1690
01:38:15,264 --> 01:38:17,765
It took six months
to burn them all up.

1691
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:40,121
Let me take that.

1692
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:47,587
Gracias.

1693
01:39:04,647 --> 01:39:06,981
I was just coming down
to say good-bye.

1694
01:39:07,107 --> 01:39:08,524
I've come up.

1695
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:20,578
You must be very happy
with your success.

1696
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,829
My success?

1697
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:24,248
You've achieved everything
you came for.

1698
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:27,251
With all three of us,
that's 100% success.

1699
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:28,586
Arden,

1700
01:39:28,712 --> 01:39:30,338
I'll come back soon.

1701
01:39:30,464 --> 01:39:32,507
I know.
You have to interview all of us.

1702
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:34,384
That's not
what I'm coming back for.

1703
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:43,685
Omar?

1704
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:49,565
I'll be right down.

1705
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:58,199
Deirdre's always afraid
of missing her plane.

1706
01:39:58,325 --> 01:39:59,367
She never has.

1707
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:00,535
Have you?

1708
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:02,245
Maybe twice, three times.

1709
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:03,413
Whatever.

1710
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:05,581
There are worse things in life
than missing a plane.

1711
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:10,461
Well,
try not to miss this one.

1712
01:40:10,587 --> 01:40:12,255
You're right.

1713
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:15,967
You know what I think?

1714
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:18,219
Those bees
knew what they were doing.

1715
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:23,307
They stung me so I'd remember
what I was here for.

1716
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:25,351
Not for my own selfish reasons,

1717
01:40:25,477 --> 01:40:27,812
not just to have a good time
and be happy-

1718
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:29,731
But to get your PhD.

1719
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:31,941
And write the book.

1720
01:40:32,067 --> 01:40:33,693
And when it's published,

1721
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:35,903
I hope you'll send us
one copy each.

1722
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:38,322
And please inscribe it,

1723
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:42,493
"With best wishes,
from professor Razaghi, PhD."

1724
01:40:42,619 --> 01:40:44,787
Professor Razaghi.

1725
01:40:44,913 --> 01:40:47,540
It sounds like a stage magician.

1726
01:40:47,666 --> 01:40:50,793
The kind that makes pigeons
fly out of a top hat.

1727
01:40:52,296 --> 01:40:54,297
And saws girls in half.

1728
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:23,284
Go on.

1729
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:33,336
Here you are.

1730
01:41:33,462 --> 01:41:35,713
We're going to miss the plane.

1731
01:41:35,839 --> 01:41:37,173
Good-bye, Deirdre.

1732
01:41:37,299 --> 01:41:40,718
I hope you and Omar have a safe
and pleasant journey.

1733
01:41:40,844 --> 01:41:44,097
Thank you for everything.

1734
01:41:44,223 --> 01:41:45,473
Good-bye.

1735
01:41:51,146 --> 01:41:52,313
Bye.

1736
01:43:14,813 --> 01:43:15,855
Hey, Omar.

1737
01:43:15,981 --> 01:43:17,523
- Where you going, Omar?
- I'm in a hurry.

1738
01:43:17,649 --> 01:43:19,317
- Oh, come on.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

1739
01:43:21,528 --> 01:43:23,070
Knock it off!

1740
01:43:23,197 --> 01:43:25,323
Hey!

1741
01:43:33,957 --> 01:43:35,541
In 500 words for Monday,

1742
01:43:35,667 --> 01:43:38,794
I want you to analyze the role
of fate in hardy's novel.

1743
01:43:38,921 --> 01:43:42,673
In Shakespeare,
character is always fate.

1744
01:43:42,799 --> 01:43:44,508
Which we know by now
from experience

1745
01:43:44,635 --> 01:43:45,843
to be absolutely true.

1746
01:43:45,969 --> 01:43:48,012
What happens to me happens

1747
01:43:48,138 --> 01:43:52,016
because I am I.

1748
01:43:52,142 --> 01:43:54,101
Hardy's characters
are caught in situations

1749
01:43:54,228 --> 01:43:57,772
that are impossible
to get out of.

1750
01:43:57,898 --> 01:44:01,859
But are they impossible?

1751
01:44:01,985 --> 01:44:04,612
Suppose a character decides
that he can do something

1752
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:06,781
about his fate.

1753
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:07,949
What then?

1754
01:44:09,576 --> 01:44:11,452
Any hands?

1755
01:44:11,578 --> 01:44:12,620
Come on, guys.

1756
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:49,782
It's Omar.

1757
01:45:13,307 --> 01:45:15,558
Omar, I found your shoe.

1758
01:45:15,684 --> 01:45:16,892
My shoe?

1759
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:19,562
The one you lost
when the bee stung you.

1760
01:45:19,688 --> 01:45:21,063
Do you still have the other one?

1761
01:45:21,189 --> 01:45:22,273
Then you can wear them.

1762
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:26,235
Thank you, Portia.

1763
01:45:26,361 --> 01:45:28,112
As a matter of fact,
I did keep it

1764
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:30,406
as a souvenir from my bee sting.

1765
01:45:30,532 --> 01:45:34,118
I'll go and get it.

1766
01:45:34,244 --> 01:45:35,953
You can't do this.

1767
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:37,413
It's wrong.

1768
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:40,750
Walk in, walk out
whenever it suits you.

1769
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:42,084
No, you can't.

1770
01:45:42,210 --> 01:45:43,294
I should have written.

1771
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:44,712
Yes, you should have written.

1772
01:45:44,838 --> 01:45:46,172
I tried to.

1773
01:45:46,298 --> 01:45:48,466
You don't know
how often I tried,

1774
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:49,967
how many letters I didn't send.

1775
01:45:50,093 --> 01:45:53,262
A postcard even,
instead of silence, nothing,

1776
01:45:53,388 --> 01:45:54,430
not a word,

1777
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:55,973
as if we no longer existed.

1778
01:45:56,099 --> 01:45:57,141
You don't understand.

1779
01:45:57,267 --> 01:45:58,434
What don't I understand?

1780
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:01,020
I was always thinking,
"Go there.

1781
01:46:01,146 --> 01:46:02,480
Go there.
Go there."

1782
01:46:02,606 --> 01:46:04,148
I knew I had to do something.

1783
01:46:04,274 --> 01:46:06,025
I wish
I could have done it right.

1784
01:46:06,151 --> 01:46:07,943
If there was one thing
I could give you,

1785
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:10,821
it would be for once
to do something right.

1786
01:46:10,947 --> 01:46:13,449
Well, you can't just
appear like this,

1787
01:46:13,575 --> 01:46:14,950
horribly upsetting everyone

1788
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:17,912
by turning up
in these fantastic ways.

1789
01:46:18,038 --> 01:46:19,789
So I should just sit
and do nothing

1790
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:21,707
and suffer
and miss you?

1791
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:22,875
Oh, please, go.

1792
01:46:23,001 --> 01:46:24,835
Just go, Omar.

1793
01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:38,265
I wanted to give him
his shoe.

1794
01:46:59,162 --> 01:47:00,162
Omar.

1795
01:47:00,288 --> 01:47:02,123
- Hi, Pete.
- Come in.

1796
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:07,086
Thank you.

1797
01:47:07,212 --> 01:47:11,215
I'll get you some dry socks.

1798
01:47:11,341 --> 01:47:12,550
Hail to thee, dear boy.

1799
01:47:12,676 --> 01:47:13,717
Where have you sprung from?

1800
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:16,262
Come and sit down.

1801
01:47:16,388 --> 01:47:18,347
Make yourself warm.

1802
01:47:18,473 --> 01:47:20,391
Sit here.
Would you like a drink?

1803
01:47:20,517 --> 01:47:21,892
- Please.
- Good.

1804
01:47:34,573 --> 01:47:35,906
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1805
01:47:36,032 --> 01:47:37,450
You seem to have developed
the habit

1806
01:47:37,576 --> 01:47:39,410
of popping up at the most
extraordinary times.

1807
01:47:39,536 --> 01:47:41,787
I'm clumsy and a fool.

1808
01:47:41,913 --> 01:47:43,747
I used to call myself that.

1809
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:45,791
But now Pete has set us up
as a corporation,

1810
01:47:45,917 --> 01:47:48,127
I'm not a fool anymore.

1811
01:47:48,253 --> 01:47:49,962
I'm a business.

1812
01:47:50,088 --> 01:47:51,130
And how's your business?

1813
01:47:51,256 --> 01:47:53,632
I've given it up,
the biography.

1814
01:47:53,758 --> 01:47:54,800
I'm not writing it.

1815
01:47:54,926 --> 01:47:56,260
Oh.

1816
01:47:56,386 --> 01:47:57,595
Well, quite frankly,
it seemed to me

1817
01:47:57,721 --> 01:47:58,804
that it was, um-

1818
01:47:58,930 --> 01:48:00,139
What was her name?
Deirdre.

1819
01:48:00,265 --> 01:48:02,183
It seemed to me
that it was Deirdre's project

1820
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:04,685
more than it was yours.

1821
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:06,812
Before I even came here,

1822
01:48:06,938 --> 01:48:08,898
I lost a dog.

1823
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:12,359
And searching for it,
I nearly drowned in a swamp.

1824
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:14,278
And then it happened again.

1825
01:48:14,404 --> 01:48:15,696
I lost a dog.

1826
01:48:15,822 --> 01:48:19,283
The same dog, Victor.

1827
01:48:19,409 --> 01:48:22,036
And looking for him,
I came to the same swamp,

1828
01:48:22,162 --> 01:48:25,456
and I thought, "Oh, no.
No, not again."

1829
01:48:25,582 --> 01:48:27,374
But I was sinking,

1830
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:30,461
not in that swamp
but in the biography,

1831
01:48:30,587 --> 01:48:32,630
my whole life.

1832
01:48:32,756 --> 01:48:34,215
Well, I haven't
the foggiest notion

1833
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:35,883
of what you're talking about,
dear boy,

1834
01:48:36,009 --> 01:48:37,718
but obviously, you've come
all the way back here

1835
01:48:37,844 --> 01:48:39,011
to save yourself from sinking.

1836
01:48:39,137 --> 01:48:40,179
Welcome.

1837
01:48:40,305 --> 01:48:41,972
Arden told me to leave.

1838
01:48:42,098 --> 01:48:43,474
She said
I had no right to come here.

1839
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,392
Oh, we're always saying
things we don't mean,

1840
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:46,977
especially in this family.

1841
01:48:47,103 --> 01:48:49,647
In fact, we often say
the opposite of what we do mean.

1842
01:48:49,773 --> 01:48:52,149
Adam sends me away every day.

1843
01:48:52,275 --> 01:48:53,859
He says it's better that way.

1844
01:48:53,985 --> 01:48:55,653
Yes, "It's better that way,"
which means,

1845
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:57,404
I can't bear it, but I will.

1846
01:48:57,531 --> 01:48:58,989
It's the Jewish mother in me,
you see.

1847
01:48:59,115 --> 01:49:00,282
What should I do?

1848
01:49:00,408 --> 01:49:01,450
Go and see her again.

1849
01:49:01,576 --> 01:49:03,327
But what if she tells me
to leave again?

1850
01:49:03,453 --> 01:49:05,829
Then come back here
and tomorrow try again,

1851
01:49:05,956 --> 01:49:09,166
and the day after that
and the day after that.

1852
01:49:10,877 --> 01:49:12,545
Omar!

1853
01:49:31,147 --> 01:49:32,231
Come on.

1854
01:49:47,330 --> 01:49:49,206
This ought to be good.

1855
01:49:49,332 --> 01:49:51,458
Don't forget he was only
10 or 12 when he wrote it.

1856
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:52,626
Be kind.

1857
01:49:56,172 --> 01:49:58,215
Hang on.

1858
01:49:58,341 --> 01:49:59,425
I think I know her.

1859
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:04,805
Excuse me.

1860
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:07,224
Aren't you Caroline Gund?

1861
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:08,726
I'm Deirdre.
We met in-

1862
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:10,477
Ocho Rios, of course.

1863
01:50:10,604 --> 01:50:11,729
How could I forget?

1864
01:50:11,855 --> 01:50:14,315
Hello.

1865
01:50:14,441 --> 01:50:16,150
Nice to meet you.
This is Tim.

1866
01:50:16,276 --> 01:50:17,318
Hello, nice to meet.

1867
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:18,819
Do you live here in Madrid?

1868
01:50:18,945 --> 01:50:20,863
No, no, we're just visiting.

1869
01:50:20,989 --> 01:50:22,072
We live in New York.

1870
01:50:22,198 --> 01:50:23,240
Really?
So do I.

1871
01:50:23,366 --> 01:50:25,993
I teach at Columbia.

1872
01:50:26,119 --> 01:50:27,244
Do you ever hear from them?

1873
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:28,579
I do occasionally.

1874
01:50:28,705 --> 01:50:29,747
They all seem very happy.

1875
01:50:29,873 --> 01:50:31,373
They've turned the land
into vineyards.

1876
01:50:31,499 --> 01:50:32,499
And there's a baby.

1877
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:33,917
A baby?

1878
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:35,252
A boy or a girl?

1879
01:50:35,378 --> 01:50:36,879
A girl.

1880
01:50:37,005 --> 01:50:39,840
A little sister for Portia.

1881
01:50:39,966 --> 01:50:41,383
And they still keep bees.

1882
01:50:41,509 --> 01:50:42,968
Oh.
Those bees?

1883
01:50:43,094 --> 01:50:44,094
It's a business now.

1884
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:45,846
They sell the honey.

1885
01:50:45,972 --> 01:50:48,265
How funny to meet you
like this after all these years,

1886
01:50:48,391 --> 01:50:52,394
and we both
live in New York now.

1887
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:53,562
Well.

1888
01:50:53,688 --> 01:50:57,107
Good-bye.

1889
01:50:57,233 --> 01:50:58,275
Who's that?

1890
01:50:58,401 --> 01:50:59,943
That's a crazy story.

1891
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:03,781
- She's not very-
- Give me a second.

1892
01:51:03,907 --> 01:51:05,574
Caroline.

1893
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:06,950
Call me.

1894
01:51:07,077 --> 01:51:08,118
I'm in the phone book.

1895
01:51:08,244 --> 01:51:09,578
The only Deirdre Rothemund,

1896
01:51:09,704 --> 01:51:11,038
West 84th.

1897
01:51:35,063 --> 01:51:36,647
So who was that?

1898
01:51:36,773 --> 01:51:38,524
Someone I met once

1899
01:51:38,650 --> 01:51:40,484
in Uruguay, of all places,

1900
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:44,238
three years ago.

1901
01:51:47,117 --> 01:51:50,536
What were you doing
in Uruguay?

1902
01:51:50,662 --> 01:51:55,374
I was sent for.
A friend needed me.

1903
01:51:55,500 --> 01:52:00,504
Did you know
that a bee sting can be fatal?

1904
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:03,549
Was it fatal?
Did he die?

1905
01:52:03,675 --> 01:52:05,634
No.
He recovered.

1906
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,137
But it a profound
psychological effect.

1907
01:52:44,299 --> 01:52:46,175
Will you call her?

1908
01:52:46,301 --> 01:52:50,304
She's friendlier
than I remember.

1909
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:52,389
What happened?

1910
01:52:52,515 --> 01:52:53,849
It's a long story.

1911
01:52:53,975 --> 01:52:55,017
Tell me.

1912
01:52:55,143 --> 01:52:59,438
Shh.

1913
01:52:59,564 --> 01:53:01,732
I'll tell you later.

1914
01:53:02,732 --> 01:53:12,732
