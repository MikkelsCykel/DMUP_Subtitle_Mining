1
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:29,708
Everybody, heads up. Keep it clear, now.

2
00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:31,168
Keep it clear.

3
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,045
Stand back.

4
00:01:46,142 --> 00:01:47,387
Slow it down.

5
00:01:57,904 --> 00:02:00,276
- Pushing team, move in there.
- Move in.

6
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:04,241
- On your ready.
- I want tasers on full charge.

7
00:02:05,953 --> 00:02:09,120
Steady! Go on. Step back in.

8
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,082
Ready. Move it.

9
00:02:12,418 --> 00:02:13,747
And push!

10
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:23,213
Well, locked. Loading team, step away.

11
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:34,060
Jophery, raise the gate.

12
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:54,447
Block the opening! Don't let her get out!

13
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:05,338
Somebody help him!

14
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:07,423
Work her back!

15
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:19,980
Shoot her!

16
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:23,523
Shoot her!

17
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:02,149
- I heard that Hammond's not even here.
- He sends his apologies.

18
00:04:02,235 --> 00:04:05,320
There's a $20 million lawsuit
for that worker's death...

19
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:07,978
...and you're telling me
that Hammond can't see me?

20
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:11,194
He had to leave early,
his daughter's getting a divorce.

21
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:14,322
I understand, but we need to deal
with the situation now.

22
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:16,572
- The insurance company...
- You okay?

23
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:23,623
The underwriters feel that the accident's
raised safety questions about the park.

24
00:04:24,174 --> 00:04:26,297
That makes the investors very anxious.

25
00:04:26,384 --> 00:04:29,967
I had to promise to conduct
a thorough, on-site inspection.

26
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:34,225
Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.

27
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:37,393
They'll pull the funding.
That'll slow him down even more.

28
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:44,896
Watch your head.

29
00:04:45,403 --> 00:04:50,445
If two experts sign off on the island,
the insurance guys'll back off.

30
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:53,861
I've already got Ian Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.

31
00:04:53,953 --> 00:04:55,531
- They want Alan Grant.
- Grant?

32
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:57,780
You'll never get him out of Montana.

33
00:04:58,374 --> 00:04:59,370
Why not?

34
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:02,832
Why not?

35
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:07,374
Because Grant's like me.

36
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,671
He's a digger.

37
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:58,260
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.

38
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,137
I hate computers.

39
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,098
The feeling's mutual.

40
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,276
Take a look.

41
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,405
Did it work?

42
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,585
- How long does this take?
- Should bring an immediate return.

43
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,750
You shoot the radar into the ground,
and the bone bounces the image back.

44
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:32,919
Bounces it back...

45
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:37,051
This new program is incredible.

46
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:41,097
A few more years' development,
and we won't even have to dig anymore.

47
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:42,892
Where's the fun in that?

48
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:46,978
It's a little distorted,
but I don't think it's the computer.

49
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:51,186
Post-mortem contraction
of the posterior neck ligaments.

50
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:52,816
Velociraptor?

51
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:54,482
Yes. Good shape, too.

52
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:57,984
It's 5, 6 feet high. I'm guessing 9 feet long.

53
00:06:58,076 --> 00:06:59,405
- Look...
- What'd you do?

54
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:00,526
He touched it.

55
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:04,862
- Dr. Grant's not machine compatible.
- Hell, they've got it in for me.

56
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:08,455
And look at the half-moon shaped bones
in the wrist.

57
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:11,000
It's no wonder these guys learned
how to fly.

58
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:14,247
No, seriously.

59
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:20,888
Maybe dinosaurs have more in common
with present-day birds than with reptiles.

60
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:24,718
Look at the pubic bone, turned backward,
like a bird's.

61
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,678
Look at the vertebrae,
full of air sacs and hollows, like a bird's.

62
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,186
And even the word "raptor"
means "bird of prey. "

63
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:34,484
That doesn't look very scary.

64
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,899
More like a 6-foot turkey.

65
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:42,699
A turkey?

66
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,283
- Imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period.
- Here we go.

67
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:53,332
You'd get yourfirst look at this
6- foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

68
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:56,216
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

69
00:07:56,718 --> 00:08:00,929
You keep still because maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement...

70
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,801
...like T. Rex and he'll lose you
if you don't move.

71
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:06,098
But no, not Velociraptor.

72
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:10,428
You stare at him
and he just stares right back.

73
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:15,734
And that's when the attack comes.
Not from the front, but from the side.

74
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,112
From the other two Raptors
you didn't even know were there.

75
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:26,279
Because Velociraptor's a pack hunter.
He uses co-ordinated attack patterns...

76
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:28,865
...and he is out in force today.

77
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,165
And he slashes at you with this...

78
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:37,167
...a 6-inch retractable claw,
like a razor, on the middle toe.

79
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:41,297
He doesn't bother to bite your jugular
like a lion. No.

80
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,221
He slashes at you...

81
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:46,091
...here or here...

82
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:47,298
Alan.

83
00:08:48,185 --> 00:08:51,969
Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.

84
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:58,060
The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.

85
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:02,823
So, you know, try to show a little respect.

86
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:04,906
Okay.

87
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:16,921
Alan, if you wanted to scare the kid,
you could've pulled a gun on him.

88
00:09:17,548 --> 00:09:19,540
Yeah, I know. Kids.

89
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,752
You want to have one of those?

90
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:27,804
I don't want that kid,
but a breed of child could be intriguing.

91
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,558
I mean, what's so wrong with kids?

92
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:34,973
They're noisy, they're messy,
they're expensive.

93
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:36,477
Cheap, cheap.

94
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:37,931
They smell.

95
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,902
- They don't smell!
- Some smell.

96
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:42,275
- Give me a break!
- Babies smell.

97
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:51,911
- Cover the site!
- Cover up the dig!

98
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:54,287
- Tell them to shut down!
- Cut the machine!

99
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:57,243
Cover it all up. Pull it over.

100
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,672
Just cut it, will you? Shut it down!

101
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:04,374
What?

102
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:21,944
What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?

103
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:24,521
We were saving that.

104
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,530
For today, I guarantee it.

105
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,114
- Who in God's name do you think you are?
- John Hammond.

106
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:35,574
And I'm delighted to meet you finally
in person, Dr. Grant.

107
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:41,621
So, I can see that my $50,000 a year
has been well spent.

108
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,538
Who's the jerk?

109
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:47,049
- This is our paleobotanist. Dr....
- Sattler.

110
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:49,421
Ellie, this is Mr. Hammond.

111
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:52,890
I'm sorry about the dramatic entrance,
Dr. Sattler, but...

112
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:54,968
- Did I say "jerk"?
... we're in a hurry.

113
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:58,430
Will you have a drink?
We won't let it get warm. Sit down.

114
00:10:59,148 --> 00:11:02,399
- Let me have this.
- I'll just get a glass or two. I can do it.

115
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:05,771
- There's samples all over here.
- I know my way around the kitchen.

116
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:07,773
Now, I'll get right to the point.

117
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:11,817
I like you. Both of you.

118
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:15,495
I can tell instantly about people. It's a gift.

119
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:21,752
I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica.

120
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:25,837
I've leased it from the government
and during the last five years...

121
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:28,416
...I've been setting up a biological preserve.

122
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:30,883
Really spectacular. Spared no expense.

123
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:34,423
Make the one I've got down in Kenya
look like a petting zoo.

124
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:38,680
And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.

125
00:11:39,021 --> 00:11:42,141
- And what are those?
- Small versions of adults, honey.

126
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,190
And not just kids, everyone.

127
00:11:44,443 --> 00:11:49,734
We're opening next year, if the lawyers
don't kill me first. Do you like lawyers?

128
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:53,576
- I don't really know any.
- Don't really know any.

129
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:58,739
I do, and there's a particular one right now,
who represents my investors.

130
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,834
Says that they insist on outside opinions.

131
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,543
What kind of opinions?

132
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:06,672
Well, your kind,
not to put too fine a point on it.

133
00:12:06,757 --> 00:12:10,837
Let's face it, in your particularfields,
you're the top minds.

134
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:13,384
And if I could just persuade you...

135
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:17,014
...to sign off on the park,
give it your endorsement...

136
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:21,513
...maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on schedule.

137
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:26,725
- Why would they care what we think?
- What kind of park is this?

138
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,987
It's right up your alley.

139
00:12:33,742 --> 00:12:37,111
Why don't you come down,
just the pair of you, for the weekend?

140
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:40,371
I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.

141
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,324
I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.

142
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:47,620
I'm sorry. This isn't possible.

143
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:50,125
We just dug up a new skeleton...

144
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:54,261
I'd compensate you
by fully funding your dig...

145
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:57,390
- This is a very unusual time.
- The timing is...

146
00:12:57,474 --> 00:12:59,799
...for a further three years.

147
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:06,190
Where's the plane?

148
00:13:07,651 --> 00:13:08,813
- Okay.
- Three years.

149
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:09,933
Cheers.

150
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:53,483
Dodgson!

151
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:03,663
You shouldn't use my name.

152
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,501
Dodgson. We've got Dodgson here.

153
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:11,333
See, nobody cares. Nice hat.

154
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:14,800
What're you trying to look like,
a secret agent?

155
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:16,587
- Well?
- $750,000.

156
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:19,634
On delivery, $50,000 more
for each viable embryo.

157
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:22,759
That's $1.5 million
if you get all 15 species off the island.

158
00:14:22,934 --> 00:14:23,965
I'll get them all.

159
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,974
Remember, viable embryos.
They're no use to us if they don't survive.

160
00:14:28,064 --> 00:14:30,306
How am I supposed to transport them?

161
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,778
The bottom screws open.

162
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:39,107
That's great. Oh, my God.

163
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,738
It's cooled and compartmentalised inside.

164
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:45,368
- You guys. That's great.
- Customs can even check it if they want to.

165
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:46,831
- Let me see.
- Go on.

166
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:50,584
- There's enough coolant for 36 hours.
- No menthol?

167
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:53,921
The embryos have to be back here
in San José by then.

168
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:55,750
That's up to your guy on the boat.

169
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:59,506
7:00 tomorrow night on the east dock.
Make sure he gets it right.

170
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:03,586
- How are you planning to beat security?
- I've got an 18-minute window.

171
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:07,384
18 minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research.

172
00:15:11,774 --> 00:15:13,766
Don't get cheap on me, Dodgson.

173
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,147
That was Hammond's mistake.

174
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:35,206
So you two dig up dinosaurs?

175
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:39,417
- Well...
- We try to.

176
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:48,221
You'll have to get used to Dr. Malcolm.

177
00:15:48,477 --> 00:15:52,854
He suffers from a deplorable excess
of personality, for a mathematician.

178
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,897
Chaotician. Chaotician, actually.

179
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:56,775
John doesn't subscribe to chaos...

180
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,647
...particularly what it says
about his science project.

181
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:03,071
Ian, you've never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns...

182
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:06,029
Because of the behaviour
of the system in phase space?

183
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:09,405
A load, if I may say so,
of fashionable number crunching...

184
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:10,702
Don't.

185
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:13,917
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
you've heard of Chaos Theory?

186
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:15,124
No.

187
00:16:15,253 --> 00:16:17,045
No? Non-linear equations?

188
00:16:18,006 --> 00:16:19,500
Strange attractors?

189
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,136
I refuse to believe that you aren't familiar
with the concept of attraction.

190
00:16:30,226 --> 00:16:33,512
I bring scientists. You bring a rock star.

191
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:39,015
There it is.

192
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:11,675
Bad wind shears. We have to drop
pretty fast. Hold on, this will be thrilling.

193
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:42,173
But you need that piece over here,
and that piece...

194
00:17:42,256 --> 00:17:45,008
We'll have landed
by the time you get it right.

195
00:17:46,302 --> 00:17:47,500
Great.

196
00:19:05,505 --> 00:19:08,175
The full 50 miles of perimeterfence
are in place?

197
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:11,461
And the concrete moats,
and the motion-sensor tracking systems.

198
00:19:11,553 --> 00:19:14,756
Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.

199
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:17,932
Let's get this straight.
This is not a weekend excursion.

200
00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:21,102
This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.

201
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:24,307
Your investors, whom I represent,
are deeply concerned.

202
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:27,649
48 hours from now,
if they're not convinced, I'm not convinced.

203
00:19:27,736 --> 00:19:29,479
I'll shut you down, John.

204
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:34,235
In 48 hours,
I'll be accepting your apologies.

205
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:45,873
All right, slow down. Slow. Stop.

206
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:49,583
This shouldn't be here.

207
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:12,446
Alan, this species of veriforman
has been extinct, since...

208
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,282
...the Cretaceous Period.
I mean, this thing...

209
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:16,695
What?

210
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:47,600
Look at that.

211
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:53,191
It's a dinosaur.

212
00:20:57,366 --> 00:21:00,700
You did it. Crazy son of a bitch, you did it.

213
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:05,620
We could tear up the rule book
on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply.

214
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,080
They're wrong.
This is a warm-blooded creature.

215
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:11,869
- This thing doesn't live in a swamp.
- This thing's got a 25, 27-foot neck?

216
00:21:11,964 --> 00:21:14,502
- The Brachiosaurus? 30.
- 30 feet.

217
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:33,646
We're gonna make a fortune
with this place.

218
00:21:38,574 --> 00:21:40,032
How fast are they?

219
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,362
Well, we clocked the T. Rex
at 32 miles an hour.

220
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:46,622
T. Rex?

221
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:49,659
You said you've got a T. Rex?

222
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:51,951
Say again.

223
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:54,333
We have a T. Rex.

224
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,458
Put your head between your knees.

225
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:00,130
Dr. Grant...

226
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:02,505
...my dear Dr. Sattler...

227
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:06,721
...welcome to Jurassic Park.

228
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,541
They're moving in herds.

229
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:35,373
They do move in herds.

230
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,054
How did you do this?

231
00:22:47,851 --> 00:22:49,179
I'll show you.

232
00:23:13,585 --> 00:23:15,292
G'day.

233
00:23:16,004 --> 00:23:19,586
The most advanced amusement park
in the entire world...

234
00:23:20,091 --> 00:23:22,629
...incorporating all the latest technologies.

235
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:26,004
And I'm not talking just about rides.
Everybody has rides.

236
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:30,308
No, we've made living
biological attractions so astounding...

237
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:33,976
...that they'll capture the imagination
of the entire planet.

238
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:36,140
So, what are you thinking?

239
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:40,359
- That we're out of a job.
- Don't you mean "extinct"?

240
00:23:48,452 --> 00:23:52,450
Why don't you all sit down?
Donald, sit down.

241
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:56,417
Here he comes. Well, here I come.

242
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,086
<i>Hello.</i>

243
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:04,255
Say hello.

244
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,459
Hello.

245
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,008
<i>Hello, John.</i>

246
00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:10,514
Yes, I've got lines.

247
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:14,051
<i>Well, fine, I guess.
But, how did I get here?</i>

248
00:24:15,563 --> 00:24:19,062
Well, let me show you.
First, I'll need a drop of blood.

249
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:20,890
Your blood.

250
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:21,980
<i>Right.</i>

251
00:24:23,821 --> 00:24:25,019
<i>That hurt.</i>

252
00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:28,573
Relax, John.
It's all part of the miracle of cloning.

253
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:30,693
<i>Hello, John.</i>

254
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:36,785
Cloned from what? Loy extraction
hasn't recreated an intact DNA strand.

255
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,951
Not without massive sequence gaps.

256
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,871
Paleo DNA, from what source?

257
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,046
Where do you get 100 million-year-old
dinosaur blood?

258
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,086
<i>What? What?</i>

259
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:54,803
<i>Well, Mr. DNA, where did you come from?</i>

260
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:56,257
<i>From your blood.</i>

261
00:24:56,353 --> 00:25:00,647
<i>Just one drop of your blood
contains billions of strands of DNA...</i>

262
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:03,224
<i>...the building blocks of life.</i>

263
00:25:03,986 --> 00:25:08,647
<i>A DNA strand like me
is a blueprint for building a living thing.</i>

264
00:25:08,865 --> 00:25:14,108
<i>And sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago, like dinosaurs...</i>

265
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:19,329
<i>...left their blueprints behind for us to find.
Wejust had to know where to look.</i>

266
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:24,329
<i>100 million years ago,
there were mosquitoesjust like today.</i>

267
00:25:24,464 --> 00:25:27,750
<i>Andjust like today,
they fed on the blood of animals.</i>

268
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:32,594
<i>Even dinosaurs.
Sometimes, after biting a dinosaur...</i>

269
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:37,427
<i>...mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap.</i>

270
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:42,680
<i>After a long time, the tree sap
would get hard and become fossilised...</i>

271
00:25:42,816 --> 00:25:47,691
<i>...just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.</i>

272
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:51,987
<i>This fossilised tree sap,
which we call amber...</i>

273
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:56,577
<i>...waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside...</i>

274
00:25:56,746 --> 00:25:59,747
<i>...until Jurassic Park scientists came along.</i>

275
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:04,878
<i>Using sophisticated techniques,
they extract the preserved blood...</i>

276
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:09,292
<i>...from the mosquito,
and bingo: dino DNA!</i>

277
00:26:10,426 --> 00:26:14,720
<i>A full DNA strand contains
three billion genetic codes.</i>

278
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:19,434
<i>If we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day...</i>

279
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:23,682
<i>...it'd take two years
to look at the entire DNA strand.</i>

280
00:26:23,773 --> 00:26:28,435
<i>It's that long.
Since it's so old, it's full of holes.</i>

281
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,739
<i>Now that's where our geneticists
take over.</i>

282
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:35,532
<i>Thinking machine super-computers
and gene sequencers...</i>

283
00:26:35,618 --> 00:26:38,026
<i>...break down the strand in minutes.</i>

284
00:26:38,246 --> 00:26:40,285
<i>And virtual-reality displays...</i>

285
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:43,539
<i>...show our geneticists the gaps
in the DNA sequence.</i>

286
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:46,617
<i>We used the complete DNA of a frog...</i>

287
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:50,627
<i>...to fill in the holes and complete the code.</i>

288
00:26:51,217 --> 00:26:55,380
<i>Whew! And now,
we can make a baby dinosaur.</i>

289
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:02,258
This score is only temporary.
It all has very dramatic music, of course.

290
00:27:03,187 --> 00:27:05,760
A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.

291
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,399
And then, the tour moves on.

292
00:27:17,243 --> 00:27:21,490
<i>Well, look here.
Those hard-working cowpokes...</i>

293
00:27:22,122 --> 00:27:24,495
This is overwhelming, John.

294
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:28,664
Are these characters autoerotica?

295
00:27:28,796 --> 00:27:31,501
No, we have no animatronics here.

296
00:27:31,715 --> 00:27:34,835
Those people are the real miracle workers
of Jurassic Park.

297
00:27:35,135 --> 00:27:38,339
<i>...in unfertilised emu or ostrich eggs.</i>

298
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:42,093
Wait a minute.
How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?

299
00:27:42,184 --> 00:27:44,889
- Can't we see the unfertilised eggs?
- Shortly.

300
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:49,935
<i>Now a whole team of genetic engineers
goes to work on...</i>

301
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:53,394
- Can't you stop these things?
- I'm sorry. It's kind of a ride.

302
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:55,444
One, two, three.

303
00:27:57,157 --> 00:27:58,486
You can't do that.

304
00:27:58,784 --> 00:28:00,823
- What?
- Can they do that?

305
00:28:03,372 --> 00:28:07,701
<i>A reminder: the boat for the mainland
will be leaving at 19:00.</i>

306
00:28:07,793 --> 00:28:12,704
<i>All personnel be at the dock
no later than 18:45. No exceptions.</i>

307
00:28:13,507 --> 00:28:16,710
- G'day, Henry.
- Good day, sir.

308
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,268
It's turning the eggs.

309
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:39,990
Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd hatch
before I had to go to the boat.

310
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:42,530
Henry, why didn't you tell me?

311
00:28:42,744 --> 00:28:46,658
I insist on being here when they're born.

312
00:28:47,415 --> 00:28:49,787
Come on.

313
00:28:51,336 --> 00:28:54,290
Come on, little one.

314
00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:05,884
Very good. Push.

315
00:29:07,852 --> 00:29:10,011
- Very good.
- God.

316
00:29:10,104 --> 00:29:12,512
Push. Come on.

317
00:29:13,107 --> 00:29:16,025
Come on. Come on, then.

318
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:19,154
There you are. There.

319
00:29:24,202 --> 00:29:28,246
They imprint on the first creature
they come in contact with.

320
00:29:28,873 --> 00:29:30,581
Helps them to trust me.

321
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:36,255
I've been present for the birth
of every creature on this island.

322
00:29:37,298 --> 00:29:40,501
Surely not the ones
that have bred in the wild.

323
00:29:40,676 --> 00:29:42,918
Actually they can't breed in the wild.

324
00:29:43,012 --> 00:29:45,847
Population control is one
of our security precautions.

325
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:48,886
There's no unauthorised breeding
in Jurassic Park.

326
00:29:50,144 --> 00:29:52,303
How do you know they can't breed?

327
00:29:53,522 --> 00:29:56,891
Because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.

328
00:29:56,984 --> 00:29:59,356
We've engineered them that way.

329
00:29:59,528 --> 00:30:01,071
There you are.

330
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:06,117
Oh, my God. Look at that.

331
00:30:06,535 --> 00:30:09,987
Blood temperature seems like
about high 80s, maybe.

332
00:30:10,081 --> 00:30:10,827
What?

333
00:30:10,915 --> 00:30:12,409
- 91.
- 91.

334
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,741
Homeothermic? It holds that temperature?

335
00:30:14,835 --> 00:30:15,950
Yes.

336
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:23,301
But, again, how do you know
they're all female?

337
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:27,466
What, does somebody go out in the park
and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?

338
00:30:27,556 --> 00:30:31,056
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.

339
00:30:31,143 --> 00:30:33,551
All vertebrate embryos
are inherently female.

340
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:37,478
They just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage...

341
00:30:37,566 --> 00:30:38,681
...to make them male.

342
00:30:38,776 --> 00:30:41,693
- We simply deny them that.
- Deny them that?

343
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:45,361
John, the kind of control
you're attempting is not possible.

344
00:30:45,449 --> 00:30:48,450
If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us...

345
00:30:48,535 --> 00:30:52,747
...it's that life will not be contained.
Life breaks free. Expands to new places...

346
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,623
...and it crashes through barriers,
painfully, maybe even dangerously...

347
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,415
...but there it is.

348
00:31:00,964 --> 00:31:02,423
There it is.

349
00:31:02,716 --> 00:31:07,923
You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed.

350
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:12,426
No, I'm simply saying that life finds a way.

351
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:21,482
What species is this?

352
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,195
It's a Velociraptor.

353
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:30,862
You bred Raptors?

354
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:49,250
Dr. Grant! As I was saying, we laid on
lunch for you before you go into the park.

355
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:52,382
- Our gourmet chef, Alejandro...
- What are they doing?

356
00:31:58,688 --> 00:31:59,886
Feeding them.

357
00:32:04,944 --> 00:32:10,187
Alejandro's prepared a delightful menu
for us. Chilean sea bass.

358
00:32:11,117 --> 00:32:12,148
Shall we?

359
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,488
They should all be destroyed.

360
00:32:54,577 --> 00:32:55,692
Robert Muldoon.

361
00:32:55,786 --> 00:32:57,578
My game warden from Kenya.

362
00:32:57,663 --> 00:33:00,664
Bit of an alarmist, but knows more
about Raptors than anyone.

363
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,493
What's their growth rate?

364
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:05,254
They're lethal at eight months,
and I do mean lethal.

365
00:33:05,338 --> 00:33:08,920
I've hunted most things that can hunt you,
but how these things move...

366
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:11,000
- Fast for a biped?
- Cheetah speed.

367
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:14,130
50, 60 miles per hour
if they ever got out in the open.

368
00:33:14,221 --> 00:33:16,013
And they're astonishing jumpers.

369
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:19,348
Yes. That's why we're taking
extreme precautions.

370
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:23,177
Do they show intelligence?

371
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:26,973
They show extreme intelligence.
Even problem-solving intelligence.

372
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,985
Especially the big one.

373
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:31,650
We bred eight originally,
but when she came in...

374
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:35,072
...she took over the pride
and killed all but two of the others.

375
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:40,782
That one, when she looks at you,
you can see she's working things out.

376
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:44,449
That's why we have to feed them like this.

377
00:33:44,543 --> 00:33:47,579
She had them all attacking the fences
when the feeders came.

378
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:49,415
The fences are electrified, right?

379
00:33:49,506 --> 00:33:52,591
That's right, but they never attack
the same place twice.

380
00:33:52,801 --> 00:33:56,466
They were testing the fences
for weaknesses systematically.

381
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,384
They remember.

382
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:13,523
Yes. Well, who's hungry?

383
00:34:13,906 --> 00:34:17,524
<i>More adventurous guests, of course,
can opt for ourjungle river cruise...</i>

384
00:34:17,618 --> 00:34:19,824
<i>...or for a close-up look at our majestic...</i>

385
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:23,411
None of these attractions are ready yet,
but the park will open...

386
00:34:23,498 --> 00:34:27,828
...with the basic tour you are about to take,
and then other rides will come on-line...

387
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,538
...six or twelve months after that.
Absolutely spectacular designs.

388
00:34:31,631 --> 00:34:34,917
- Spared no expense.
- And we can charge anything we want.

389
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,715
$2,000 a day, $10,000 a day,
and people will pay it.

390
00:34:37,804 --> 00:34:40,675
- And there's the merchandise...
- Donald.

391
00:34:41,183 --> 00:34:44,433
This park was not built to cater
only for the super rich.

392
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:47,520
Everyone in the world has the right
to enjoy these animals.

393
00:34:47,606 --> 00:34:48,720
Sure. They will.

394
00:34:48,815 --> 00:34:52,266
We'll have a coupon day or something.

395
00:34:56,197 --> 00:35:01,951
The lack of humility before nature
that's being displayed here staggers me.

396
00:35:02,746 --> 00:35:06,245
I think things are a little different
than you and I had feared.

397
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:07,910
I know. They're a lot worse.

398
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:11,251
Now, wait a second,
we haven't even seen the park yet...

399
00:35:11,963 --> 00:35:16,257
Donald, let him talk. There's no reason,
I want to hear every viewpoint.

400
00:35:16,342 --> 00:35:20,803
Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

401
00:35:21,097 --> 00:35:24,264
Genetic power's the most awesome force
the planet's ever seen...

402
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:27,221
...but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.

403
00:35:27,312 --> 00:35:30,811
- It's hardly appropriate to start hurling...
- Lf I may.

404
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:34,647
I'll tell you the problem
with the scientific power you're using here.

405
00:35:34,736 --> 00:35:38,520
It didn't require any discipline to attain it.

406
00:35:38,906 --> 00:35:42,441
You read what others had done
and you took the next step.

407
00:35:42,577 --> 00:35:44,735
You didn't earn the knowledge
for yourselves...

408
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:47,581
...so you don't take
any responsibility for it.

409
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:52,413
You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to
accomplish something as fast as you could.

410
00:35:52,503 --> 00:35:56,583
Before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, and packaged it...

411
00:35:56,674 --> 00:36:00,921
...and slapped it on a plastic lunch box,
and now you're selling it.

412
00:36:02,263 --> 00:36:04,552
I don't think you're giving us
our due credit.

413
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,056
Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.

414
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:11,394
But your scientists were so preoccupied
with whether they could...

415
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,722
...they didn't stop to think if they should.

416
00:36:13,816 --> 00:36:17,565
Condors.
Condors are on the verge of extinction.

417
00:36:17,778 --> 00:36:23,318
If I created condors on this island,
you wouldn't have anything to say.

418
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:26,114
This isn't some species
that was obliterated...

419
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:29,323
...by deforestation or the building of a dam.

420
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:34,623
Dinosaurs had their shot
and nature selected them for extinction.

421
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,627
I don't understand this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.

422
00:36:40,718 --> 00:36:45,629
How can we stand in the light of discovery
and not act?

423
00:36:45,723 --> 00:36:49,388
What's so great about discovery?
It's a violent, penetrative act...

424
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:53,059
...that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery...

425
00:36:54,148 --> 00:36:56,852
...I call the rape of the natural world.

426
00:36:57,735 --> 00:37:01,732
The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct eco-system?

427
00:37:01,822 --> 00:37:04,823
How could you ever assume
that you can control it?

428
00:37:04,908 --> 00:37:09,321
You have poisonous plants in this building.
You picked them because they look good.

429
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:13,624
But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in...

430
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:16,710
...and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.

431
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:24,373
Dr. Grant. If there's one person who
could appreciate what I am trying to do...

432
00:37:25,971 --> 00:37:30,716
The world has just changed so radically
and we're all running to catch up.

433
00:37:31,435 --> 00:37:35,978
I don't want to jump to any conclusions,
but dinosaurs and man...

434
00:37:36,106 --> 00:37:40,269
...two species separated
by 65 million years of evolution...

435
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,811
...have just been suddenly
thrown back into the mix together.

436
00:37:43,905 --> 00:37:48,283
How can we possibly have
the slightest idea what to expect?

437
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:51,617
I don't believe it.

438
00:37:51,705 --> 00:37:54,990
You're meant to come here
and defend me against these characters...

439
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:58,534
...and the only one I've got on my side
is the blood-sucking lawyer.

440
00:37:59,379 --> 00:38:00,542
Thank you.

441
00:38:07,595 --> 00:38:08,876
They're here.

442
00:38:09,681 --> 00:38:12,516
You four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park.

443
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,388
Spend a little time
with our target audience.

444
00:38:15,478 --> 00:38:16,557
Grandpa!

445
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:18,059
Kids!

446
00:38:21,025 --> 00:38:24,525
- Wait! Careful with me.
- We missed you.

447
00:38:25,154 --> 00:38:28,855
- We loved the presents. They were great.
- Did you enjoy the helicopter?

448
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,619
Yeah, it went down
and we all went right up.

449
00:38:34,914 --> 00:38:38,081
Now, kids, come away.
Not too close to the cars.

450
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:42,622
Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious, though.

451
00:38:42,714 --> 00:38:45,205
These will be your transports
for the afternoon.

452
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:48,004
- No drivers?
- No, drivers. They're electric.

453
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:51,130
They run on this track
in the middle of the roadway here.

454
00:38:51,222 --> 00:38:54,139
Totally non-polluting. Top of the line.
Spared no expense.

455
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:57,007
It's an interactive CD-ROM!

456
00:38:57,103 --> 00:39:00,104
You touch the screen
and it talks about whatever you want.

457
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:03,274
Lex, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me.

458
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,268
Dr. Grant, come in the second car.

459
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:07,934
I'm gonna ride with, Dr. Sattler.

460
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,160
I read your book.

461
00:39:22,712 --> 00:39:23,957
That's great.

462
00:39:24,922 --> 00:39:28,587
Do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they went?

463
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:32,923
A few species may have evolved
along those lines.

464
00:39:37,935 --> 00:39:40,307
They sure don't look like birds to me.

465
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:44,482
I heard that there was this meteor...

466
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:48,861
...hit the earth someplace down in Mexico
and made this big crater.

467
00:39:48,946 --> 00:39:50,274
Listen...

468
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,369
...Tim, which car were you planning on?

469
00:39:56,787 --> 00:39:58,578
Whichever one you are.

470
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:06,457
<i>I heard about this thing in Omni
about this meteor making all this heat.</i>

471
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:09,079
It made diamond dust
and that changed the weather.

472
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:10,799
They died because of the weather.

473
00:40:10,884 --> 00:40:15,345
My teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named Bakker. He says...

474
00:40:17,307 --> 00:40:20,759
She said I should ride with you
'cause it'd be good for you.

475
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:22,894
<i>The boat is now loading.</i>

476
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,688
<i>Everyone must be on the dock
for the 19:00 departure.</i>

477
00:40:29,069 --> 00:40:32,023
National Weather Service
is tracking a tropical storm...

478
00:40:32,114 --> 00:40:34,402
...about 75 miles west of us.

479
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,991
Why didn't I build in Orlando?

480
00:40:37,077 --> 00:40:40,825
I'll keep an eye on it.
Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.

481
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,119
Start the tour program.

482
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,553
Hold onto your butts.

483
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:10,806
<i>And why did they put the fibreglass thing?</i>

484
00:41:21,704 --> 00:41:23,863
<i>You want tojoin the future, right?</i>

485
00:41:24,123 --> 00:41:26,412
<i>God help us when the hands of engineers...</i>

486
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:29,371
<i>During your tour,
the appropriate information will be...</i>

487
00:41:29,462 --> 00:41:32,131
<i>...automatically selected
and displayed for you.</i>

488
00:41:32,215 --> 00:41:35,880
<i>Simply touch the area of the screen
displaying the appropriate icon.</i>

489
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:37,249
Are we gonna hit that?

490
00:41:37,345 --> 00:41:39,421
<i>Welcome to Jurassic Park.</i>

491
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:45,967
What have they got in there, King Kong?

492
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:02,203
The voice you're now hearing
is Richard Kiley.

493
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,865
We spared no expense.

494
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,413
<i>If you look to the right...</i>

495
00:42:05,498 --> 00:42:10,836
<i>...you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.</i>

496
00:42:11,254 --> 00:42:13,376
- Dilophosaurus!
- Shit!

497
00:42:13,673 --> 00:42:15,464
<i>One of the earliest carnivores...</i>

498
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:18,634
<i>...we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous...</i>

499
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:23,927
<i>...spitting its venom at its prey,
causing blindness and paralysis...</i>

500
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:27,178
<i>...allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure.</i>

501
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:31,512
<i>This makes Dilophosaurus a beautiful
but deadly addition...</i>

502
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,517
<i>...to Jurassic Park.</i>

503
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:42,152
Alan?

504
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,204
Damn.

505
00:42:54,213 --> 00:42:56,455
Vehicle headlights are on
and not responding.

506
00:42:56,548 --> 00:42:59,039
Those shouldn't be running off
of car batteries.

507
00:42:59,134 --> 00:43:01,708
Item 151 on today's glitch list.

508
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:04,930
We have all the problems
of a major theme park and a zoo...

509
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:08,016
...and the computers
aren't even on theirfeet yet.

510
00:43:09,937 --> 00:43:13,721
Our lives are in your hands
and you have butterfingers?

511
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,773
I am totally unappreciated in my time.

512
00:43:17,986 --> 00:43:21,818
You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days.

513
00:43:21,907 --> 00:43:24,480
You think that kind of automation is easy?

514
00:43:24,993 --> 00:43:25,823
Or cheap?

515
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:28,580
You know anyone
who can network eight machines...

516
00:43:28,664 --> 00:43:32,661
...and de-bug two million lines of code
on my salary? If so, I want to see them.

517
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:37,164
Sorry about yourfinancial problems,
I really am. But they are your problems.

518
00:43:37,255 --> 00:43:39,711
You're absolutely right.
Everything's my problem.

519
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,304
I will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you. I really will not.

520
00:43:45,514 --> 00:43:47,590
There's been hardly any debate at all.

521
00:43:47,682 --> 00:43:50,767
I don't blame people for their mistakes.

522
00:43:51,353 --> 00:43:53,595
But I do ask that they pay for them.

523
00:43:53,813 --> 00:43:55,012
Thanks, Dad.

524
00:43:56,274 --> 00:43:57,270
The headlights.

525
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,028
I'll de-bug the tour program
when they get back, okay?

526
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:03,362
It'll eat a lot of compute cycles.
We'll lose part of the system.

527
00:44:03,448 --> 00:44:06,698
There's a small amount of memory,
you can't use it for everything.

528
00:44:06,785 --> 00:44:09,904
- Are you gonna compile for a half an hour...
- Quiet, all of you!

529
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:13,746
They're approaching
the Tyrannosaur paddock.

530
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:08,342
God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.

531
00:45:08,763 --> 00:45:13,555
God creates man. Man destroys God.
Man creates dinosaurs.

532
00:45:14,685 --> 00:45:18,683
Dinosaurs eat man.

533
00:45:19,774 --> 00:45:21,850
Woman inherits the earth.

534
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,653
<i>We'll try to tempt the Rex now.
Keep watching the fence.</i>

535
00:45:42,796 --> 00:45:44,670
What's going to happen to the goat?

536
00:45:49,011 --> 00:45:50,719
He's going to eat the goat?

537
00:45:51,055 --> 00:45:52,430
Excellent.

538
00:45:53,515 --> 00:45:56,766
What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?

539
00:45:57,394 --> 00:45:59,636
I happen to be a vegetarian.

540
00:46:07,988 --> 00:46:10,859
T. Rex doesn't want to be fed.
He wants to hunt.

541
00:46:12,117 --> 00:46:16,909
Can't just suppress 65 million years
of gut instinct.

542
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:44,019
<i>Eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs
on your dinosaur tour, right?</i>

543
00:46:47,402 --> 00:46:49,727
<i>Hello. Yes?</i>

544
00:46:50,322 --> 00:46:52,314
I really hate that man.

545
00:46:57,537 --> 00:47:02,329
The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey
any set patterns or park schedules.

546
00:47:02,459 --> 00:47:04,332
The essence of chaos.

547
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:07,753
I'm still not clear on chaos.

548
00:47:09,424 --> 00:47:13,338
It simply deals with unpredictability
in complex systems.

549
00:47:14,888 --> 00:47:16,880
The shorthand is the Butterfly Effect.

550
00:47:16,973 --> 00:47:19,179
A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking...

551
00:47:19,267 --> 00:47:22,102
...and in Central Park
you get rain instead of sunshine.

552
00:47:24,564 --> 00:47:26,557
- Was I going too fast?
- I missed it.

553
00:47:26,649 --> 00:47:27,645
I did a fly-by.

554
00:47:27,734 --> 00:47:30,485
Give me that glass of water.
We'll conduct an experiment.

555
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:33,690
The car should be still. But that's okay.
It's just an example.

556
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,648
Put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic.

557
00:47:37,493 --> 00:47:39,285
A drop of waterfalls on your hand.

558
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,992
Which way will the drop roll off?
Which finger?

559
00:47:42,415 --> 00:47:43,874
Thumb, I'd say.

560
00:47:46,586 --> 00:47:48,294
Freeze your hand. Don't move.

561
00:47:48,588 --> 00:47:51,624
I'll do the same thing,
start with the same place again.

562
00:47:51,716 --> 00:47:53,175
Which way, now?

563
00:47:53,259 --> 00:47:56,213
Let's say back the same way.

564
00:47:58,598 --> 00:48:00,970
It changed. Why?

565
00:48:01,142 --> 00:48:03,431
Because tiny variations...

566
00:48:03,978 --> 00:48:06,386
...the orientation of the hairs
on your hands...

567
00:48:06,481 --> 00:48:07,809
Alan, look at this.

568
00:48:07,899 --> 00:48:11,766
...the amount of blood distending
your vessels, imperfections in the skin...

569
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:14,268
- "Imperfections in the skin"?
- Just microscopic.

570
00:48:14,363 --> 00:48:17,946
...never repeat and vastly effect
the outcome. That's...

571
00:48:18,034 --> 00:48:20,073
...what?
- Unpredictability.

572
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:25,950
There. Look at this. See? I'm right again.

573
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:30,496
Nobody could predict that Dr. Grant
would jump out of a moving vehicle.

574
00:48:32,715 --> 00:48:35,087
And there's another example.

575
00:48:36,594 --> 00:48:41,054
See, here I am now by myself,
talking to myself. That's Chaos Theory.

576
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:44,057
Stop the program.

577
00:48:47,354 --> 00:48:51,222
I told you how many times we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.

578
00:48:51,317 --> 00:48:54,068
<i>Stopping park vehicles
and rebooting program.</i>

579
00:48:54,528 --> 00:48:56,817
<i>We're on. Will notify for resume.</i>

580
00:48:59,241 --> 00:49:01,317
I'll switch it over to TelePrompTer.

581
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:04,494
- What about the circuit integrities?
- Screen says faulty sensor.

582
00:49:07,374 --> 00:49:10,909
- I'll call security.
- We're at full go on that and it looks good.

583
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:14,289
Like I said, there's this other book
by a guy named Bakker...

584
00:49:14,381 --> 00:49:16,670
...and he says dinosaurs died
from diseases.

585
00:49:16,759 --> 00:49:20,092
- Where are we going?
- He didn't say they turned into birds.

586
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:22,302
Anyone else think
we shouldn't be out here?

587
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:25,176
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Like this.

588
00:49:25,267 --> 00:49:28,019
- Really?
- Yours was fully illustrated.

589
00:49:29,521 --> 00:49:30,850
You okay?

590
00:49:30,981 --> 00:49:33,353
Look at this. Wait. Watch.

591
00:49:34,109 --> 00:49:35,936
Come on. Watch this.

592
00:49:41,658 --> 00:49:43,200
Everybody stay here.

593
00:50:01,428 --> 00:50:03,634
- Okay?
- Of course.

594
00:50:06,558 --> 00:50:10,390
Don't be scared. Come on, it's okay.
Muldoon tranquillised herfor me.

595
00:50:10,478 --> 00:50:11,759
She's sick.

596
00:50:20,655 --> 00:50:22,066
Oh, my God.

597
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:47,135
She was always my favourite
when I was a kid...

598
00:50:47,223 --> 00:50:50,592
...and now I see
she's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

599
00:50:54,939 --> 00:50:56,314
It's okay.

600
00:50:59,444 --> 00:51:02,017
Microvesicles. That's interesting.

601
00:51:04,031 --> 00:51:06,320
Thanks. What are her symptoms?

602
00:51:06,909 --> 00:51:09,661
Imbalance, disorientation,
laboured breathing.

603
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:11,987
It seems to happen every six weeks or so.

604
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:13,456
Six weeks.

605
00:51:27,096 --> 00:51:28,721
- These are dilated.
- They are?

606
00:51:28,806 --> 00:51:31,475
- Take a look.
- I'll be damned.

607
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:36,058
That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.

608
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:45,610
Is this West Indian lilac?

609
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:49,608
Yes. We know they're toxic,
but the animals don't eat them.

610
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:56,874
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

611
00:51:58,377 --> 00:52:00,619
There's only one way to be positive.

612
00:52:01,297 --> 00:52:03,834
I'd have to see the dinosaur's droppings.

613
00:52:05,009 --> 00:52:08,128
Dino droppings? Droppings?

614
00:52:13,934 --> 00:52:15,725
Yeah, I got that.

615
00:52:17,229 --> 00:52:20,349
That storm centre hasn't dissipated
or changed course.

616
00:52:20,649 --> 00:52:22,891
We're gonna have to cut the tour short.

617
00:52:23,193 --> 00:52:24,985
We'll pick it up again tomorrow.

618
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:28,320
- Are you sure we have to?
- It's not worth taking the chance.

619
00:52:28,407 --> 00:52:32,025
- Sustained winds at 45 knots.
- Tell them when they get back in the cars.

620
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,781
Ladies and gentlemen last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in five minutes.

621
00:52:36,873 --> 00:52:39,199
Drop what you're doing and leave now.

622
00:52:41,712 --> 00:52:42,874
Damn.

623
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,213
That is one big pile of shit.

624
00:52:59,563 --> 00:53:02,184
You're right.
There's no trace of lilac berries.

625
00:53:02,274 --> 00:53:04,313
That's so odd, though.

626
00:53:04,776 --> 00:53:08,062
All right,
she's suffering from Melia toxicity...

627
00:53:10,115 --> 00:53:12,403
...every six weeks.

628
00:53:14,035 --> 00:53:17,570
Let's see, rats.

629
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,327
She's tenacious.

630
00:53:22,627 --> 00:53:24,335
You have no idea.

631
00:53:26,423 --> 00:53:30,337
You will remember to wash your hands
before you eat anything?

632
00:53:42,564 --> 00:53:46,478
Doctors, if you please,
I have to insist that we get moving.

633
00:53:48,903 --> 00:53:52,486
I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding
and finish up with the Trike.

634
00:53:53,241 --> 00:53:55,032
Sure. I'm in a gas-powered jeep.

635
00:53:55,118 --> 00:53:57,869
I'll drop her off at the centre
before I make the boat.

636
00:53:57,954 --> 00:54:00,789
Great. Then I'll catch up with you later.

637
00:54:00,873 --> 00:54:01,822
You sure?

638
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:04,703
Yeah, I want to stay
with her a little longer.

639
00:54:04,794 --> 00:54:06,205
Okay, then.

640
00:54:21,018 --> 00:54:25,016
<i>There's nothing I can do.
The captain says we have to go, we go.</i>

641
00:54:25,398 --> 00:54:27,106
You've got to give me time.

642
00:54:27,191 --> 00:54:30,856
I did a test run, it took me 20 minutes.
I think I can push it to 18 but...

643
00:54:30,945 --> 00:54:33,068
...you've got to give me
at least 15 minutes.

644
00:54:33,155 --> 00:54:34,484
<i>No promises.</i>

645
00:54:42,248 --> 00:54:44,821
Visitor vehicles are returning
to the garage.

646
00:54:47,169 --> 00:54:52,377
So much for ourfirst tour.
Two no-shows and one sick Triceratops.

647
00:54:53,592 --> 00:54:55,051
It could've been worse.

648
00:54:56,512 --> 00:54:57,792
A lot worse.

649
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:02,010
Anybody want a soda or something?
I'm going up to the machine.

650
00:55:02,101 --> 00:55:04,259
I thought maybe
I'd get somebody something.

651
00:55:04,353 --> 00:55:08,101
I've had only sweets
and I'm gonna get something salty.

652
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:11,183
I finished de-bugging the phones.

653
00:55:12,486 --> 00:55:14,526
I was going to, so I did.

654
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,401
So I de-bugged the phones.
And I thought maybe...

655
00:55:17,908 --> 00:55:20,660
...I should tell you the system
will be compiling...

656
00:55:20,744 --> 00:55:23,615
...for 18 to 20 minutes,
so some of the minor systems...

657
00:55:23,705 --> 00:55:27,324
...they might go on and off for a while,
but it's nothing to worry about.

658
00:55:49,648 --> 00:55:53,895
- Do you have any kids?
- Me? Hell, yeah. Three. I love kids.

659
00:55:55,862 --> 00:55:58,234
Anything at all can and does happen.

660
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,231
Same with wives, for that matter.

661
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,115
- You're married?
- Occasionally.

662
00:56:06,164 --> 00:56:10,541
I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

663
00:56:24,099 --> 00:56:26,506
Five, four...

664
00:56:38,696 --> 00:56:40,985
- That's odd.
- What?

665
00:56:41,241 --> 00:56:43,399
Door security systems are shutting down.

666
00:56:43,743 --> 00:56:46,946
Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?

667
00:57:43,094 --> 00:57:44,920
By the way, Dr. Sattler...

668
00:57:46,097 --> 00:57:49,512
...she's not, like, available, is she?
- Why?

669
00:57:52,436 --> 00:57:55,223
- I'm sorry. You two are...
- Yeah.

670
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:02,357
- What'd I touch?
- You didn't touch anything. We stopped.

671
00:58:11,246 --> 00:58:12,954
What the hell?

672
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,041
- What now?
- Fences are failing all over the park.

673
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,618
Find Nedry. Check the vending machines.

674
00:58:50,535 --> 00:58:52,611
Just look at this work station.

675
00:58:52,704 --> 00:58:56,204
- What a complete slob.
- The Raptorfences aren't out, are they?

676
00:59:03,215 --> 00:59:04,958
No, no. They're still on.

677
00:59:07,594 --> 00:59:10,132
Why the hell would he turn
the other ones off?

678
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,880
Access main program.

679
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,382
Access main security.

680
00:59:55,141 --> 00:59:56,849
Access main program grid.

681
01:00:05,985 --> 01:00:08,061
<i>You didn't say the magic word.</i>

682
01:00:08,488 --> 01:00:12,022
Please! Goddamn it.
I hate this hacker crap.

683
01:00:12,158 --> 01:00:15,408
Phone Nedry's people in Cambridge.

684
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:19,372
Phones are out, too.

685
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:24,579
Where did the vehicles stop?

686
01:00:45,733 --> 01:00:47,144
Their radio's out, too.

687
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:50,018
- Gennaro said to stay put.
- Kids okay?

688
01:00:50,196 --> 01:00:52,354
I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?

689
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:54,156
- Kids get scared.
- What's scary?

690
01:00:54,241 --> 01:00:57,326
- It's just a little hiccup in the power.
- I'm not scared.

691
01:00:57,453 --> 01:00:59,492
- I didn't say you were scared.
- I know.

692
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:05,450
Hey, where did you find those?

693
01:01:05,669 --> 01:01:08,291
- In the box, under my seat.
- Are they heavy?

694
01:01:08,756 --> 01:01:11,425
- Yeah.
- Then they're expensive. Put them back.

695
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:20,176
Don't scare me.

696
01:01:31,737 --> 01:01:33,528
Cool. Night vision.

697
01:01:58,805 --> 01:02:00,264
Did you feel that?

698
01:02:34,215 --> 01:02:36,837
Maybe it's the power
trying to come back on.

699
01:02:39,471 --> 01:02:40,751
What is that?

700
01:02:57,906 --> 01:02:59,281
Where's the goat?

701
01:03:22,346 --> 01:03:23,544
Jesus!

702
01:03:28,436 --> 01:03:30,227
He left us.

703
01:03:41,532 --> 01:03:45,861
- Where does he think he's going?
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.

704
01:04:03,971 --> 01:04:05,251
Dr. Grant.

705
01:04:18,152 --> 01:04:20,275
I hate being right all the time.

706
01:04:29,747 --> 01:04:33,910
Keep absolutely still.
Its vision is based on movement.

707
01:04:47,931 --> 01:04:49,473
Turn the light off.

708
01:04:54,396 --> 01:04:55,855
Turn the light off!

709
01:05:51,703 --> 01:05:54,573
- Hurry! Turn it off!
- I'm sorry!

710
01:05:58,751 --> 01:06:00,744
You're the one who turned it...

711
01:07:19,748 --> 01:07:21,077
Ian, freeze!

712
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:22,994
Get the kids!

713
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:26,286
- Get rid of the flare!
- Get the kids!

714
01:07:27,297 --> 01:07:28,875
Get rid of the flare!

715
01:07:31,844 --> 01:07:33,670
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord be...

716
01:07:56,118 --> 01:07:57,363
Dr. Grant!

717
01:08:01,999 --> 01:08:04,572
I'm stuck. The seat's got my feet.

718
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:06,957
I'll get you next. You're okay.

719
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:09,713
You're all right.

720
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:12,043
Tim. Tim!

721
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:18,680
Don't move.
He can't see us if we don't move.

722
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,156
Lex! Lex, you're choking me.

723
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:30,246
Grab the wire.

724
01:09:49,981 --> 01:09:53,848
"Keycheck space minus 0.
Keychecks off, safety space minus 0."

725
01:09:53,985 --> 01:09:57,188
He's turning the safety systems off.
Doesn't want anybody to see.

726
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:00,483
Look at this next entry.
It's the kicker. "White rabbit object. "

727
01:10:00,658 --> 01:10:04,608
It did it all. With the keychecks off,
the computer didn't file the keystrokes.

728
01:10:04,703 --> 01:10:08,404
The way to find them is to check
the computer's lines of code one by one.

729
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:11,707
- How many lines of code are there?
- About two million.

730
01:10:11,961 --> 01:10:13,371
- Two million?
- Yeah.

731
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:21,049
Robert, I wonder if perhaps you would
be good enough to take a gas jeep...

732
01:10:22,638 --> 01:10:24,880
...and bring back my grandchildren.

733
01:10:25,766 --> 01:10:26,797
Sure.

734
01:10:29,728 --> 01:10:31,222
I'm going with him.

735
01:10:34,566 --> 01:10:35,598
John.

736
01:10:41,573 --> 01:10:45,073
I can't get Jurassic Park back on-line
without Dennis Nedry.

737
01:11:05,222 --> 01:11:06,384
Damn it!

738
01:11:13,105 --> 01:11:14,515
There's the road!

739
01:11:21,071 --> 01:11:25,115
Winch this sucker off the thing
and then I tie it to the that thing there.

740
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,616
I'll pull down this thing here,
and pull it back up again.

741
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:40,371
My glasses. I can afford more glasses!

742
01:12:09,577 --> 01:12:12,911
You've got time. You can do it.
Do it. Come on, Dennis.

743
01:12:20,338 --> 01:12:21,369
Hello.

744
01:12:26,511 --> 01:12:29,298
Yeah, that's nice. I've got to go.

745
01:12:40,525 --> 01:12:41,853
Nice boy.

746
01:12:42,276 --> 01:12:43,355
Nice boy.

747
01:12:43,945 --> 01:12:45,569
Nice dinosaur.

748
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:49,821
Thought you were one of your big brothers.
You're not so bad.

749
01:12:49,909 --> 01:12:53,823
What do you want? A little food?
Look at me. I just fell down a hill.

750
01:12:53,913 --> 01:12:57,412
I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food.
I have nothing on me.

751
01:12:58,793 --> 01:13:00,999
Go on. Play fetch?

752
01:13:03,172 --> 01:13:04,370
Look, stick.

753
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:08,208
Look at stick.

754
01:13:08,886 --> 01:13:11,803
Stick, stupid.
Fetch the stick, boy. Look at the stick.

755
01:13:12,556 --> 01:13:14,882
You like the stick? Go on and get it.

756
01:13:15,059 --> 01:13:16,886
No wonder you're extinct.

757
01:13:18,145 --> 01:13:20,387
I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.

758
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:38,426
Timmy!

759
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,560
Now, Lex. Listen.

760
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:46,933
Lex, I'm right here.

761
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:50,064
I'll look after you.
I have to help your brother.

762
01:14:50,195 --> 01:14:52,401
Stay right here and wait for me.

763
01:14:52,781 --> 01:14:55,106
He left us.

764
01:14:55,617 --> 01:14:58,108
But that's not what I'm going to do.

765
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:01,194
Okay?

766
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:04,906
Stay here.

767
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:34,062
You hear me? I'm coming up.

768
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:38,730
I hate climbing. I hate trees, way too high.

769
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:08,100
You okay?

770
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:12,353
I threw up.

771
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:16,686
That's okay.

772
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,364
Just give me your hand.

773
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:27,582
Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up.
Just give me your hand.

774
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:37,962
Here, I've got you.

775
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:40,793
Okay.

776
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:45,178
- That's good. Over the rail.
- Don't pull me too hard.

777
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:51,972
Stand on the door. Hang on to me.

778
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,315
- That's not too bad, right, Timmy?
- Yes, it is.

779
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:01,110
It's like a tree house.
Your dad ever build you one?

780
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,742
- No.
- Yeah, me, too.

781
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:07,198
The thing about climbing is,
you never look down.

782
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,866
This is impossible.

783
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:13,413
- How am I going to do this? It's about...
- I'm going to help you with yourfooting.

784
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:20,207
Tim, go.

785
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,283
Go, Tim, go!

786
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:53,782
Faster, Tim!

787
01:18:00,508 --> 01:18:01,623
Tim, jump!

788
01:18:05,638 --> 01:18:06,718
Go, Tim.

789
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,597
We're back in the car again.

790
01:18:19,819 --> 01:18:21,895
At least you're out of the tree.

791
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:28,909
Where's the other car?

792
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:33,327
Alan!

793
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:35,704
Dr. Grant!

794
01:18:51,851 --> 01:18:55,267
- I think this was Gennaro.
- I think this was, too.

795
01:18:58,858 --> 01:19:01,396
- I think it's ahead of us.
- It could be anywhere.

796
01:19:01,485 --> 01:19:04,854
With fences down,
it can wander in and out of any paddock.

797
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,863
He's put a tourniquet on. Lan.

798
01:19:15,583 --> 01:19:18,287
Remind me to thank John
for a lovely weekend.

799
01:19:23,299 --> 01:19:25,042
Can we chance moving him?

800
01:19:26,385 --> 01:19:27,844
Please chance it.

801
01:19:36,395 --> 01:19:37,973
Ellie, come on!

802
01:19:45,529 --> 01:19:46,608
The other car!

803
01:19:47,364 --> 01:19:48,609
Dr. Grant?

804
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,614
They're not here.

805
01:20:23,984 --> 01:20:25,478
Anybody hear that?

806
01:20:29,072 --> 01:20:31,480
It's an impact tremor, is what it is.

807
01:20:32,367 --> 01:20:34,158
I'm fairly alarmed here.

808
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:38,290
Come on. We've got to get out of here.
Now!

809
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:41,204
Let's go.

810
01:20:52,679 --> 01:20:53,959
Must go faster.

811
01:20:56,641 --> 01:20:59,476
Here it comes! Stand on it! Fifth gear!

812
01:21:05,817 --> 01:21:08,937
- Get off the stick! Bloody move!
- Look out!

813
01:21:36,055 --> 01:21:38,380
Think they'll have that on the tour?

814
01:21:46,566 --> 01:21:48,143
Are you hearing this?

815
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:56,899
Come on, Tim. Hurry up.

816
01:21:57,868 --> 01:21:59,576
Let's get up this tree.

817
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:05,291
Come on, Tim, it's okay.
Listen. Try up here.

818
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:10,959
I hate trees.

819
01:22:11,632 --> 01:22:15,250
- They don't bother me.
- Yeah? Well, you weren't in the last one.

820
01:22:29,775 --> 01:22:33,310
Look at the Brontosauruses.
I mean, Brachiosaurus.

821
01:22:34,863 --> 01:22:36,274
They're singing.

822
01:23:05,519 --> 01:23:07,346
Don't let the monsters come here.

823
01:23:07,437 --> 01:23:10,853
They're not monsters, they're animals.
These are herbivores.

824
01:23:11,108 --> 01:23:14,477
They only eat vegetables.
For you, I think they'd make an exception.

825
01:23:14,569 --> 01:23:16,229
I hate the other kind.

826
01:23:18,323 --> 01:23:21,110
The other kind just do what they do.

827
01:23:41,221 --> 01:23:42,419
What's that?

828
01:23:47,644 --> 01:23:51,428
What are you and Ellie going to do,
if you don't dig up bones anymore?

829
01:23:53,024 --> 01:23:54,269
I don't know.

830
01:23:55,527 --> 01:23:57,934
I guess we'll just have to evolve, too.

831
01:24:01,616 --> 01:24:03,822
What do you call a blind dinosaur?

832
01:24:05,829 --> 01:24:09,245
- What do you call a blind dinosaur?
- "Do-you-think-he-saurus. "

833
01:24:13,545 --> 01:24:16,036
What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?

834
01:24:16,881 --> 01:24:18,044
You got me.

835
01:24:18,383 --> 01:24:20,375
A "Do-you-think-he-saurus' Rex. "

836
01:24:23,096 --> 01:24:25,088
- Alan?
- Yeah?

837
01:24:25,932 --> 01:24:29,099
What if the dinosaurs come back
while we're all asleep?

838
01:24:31,396 --> 01:24:33,602
- I'll stay awake.
- All night?

839
01:24:36,192 --> 01:24:37,307
All night.

840
01:25:27,576 --> 01:25:29,201
They were all melting.

841
01:25:32,915 --> 01:25:36,035
Malcolm's okay for now.
I gave him a shot of morphine.

842
01:25:39,922 --> 01:25:41,464
They'll all be fine.

843
01:25:42,466 --> 01:25:46,760
Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

844
01:25:51,225 --> 01:25:53,016
You know, the first...

845
01:25:54,269 --> 01:25:57,721
...attraction I ever built
when I came down from Scotland...

846
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,891
...was a flea circus, Petticoat Lane.

847
01:26:03,278 --> 01:26:05,070
Really quite wonderful.

848
01:26:05,656 --> 01:26:08,906
I had a wee trapeze and a...

849
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,319
...carousel...

850
01:26:17,251 --> 01:26:18,661
...and a seesaw.

851
01:26:19,795 --> 01:26:22,001
They all move motorised, of course.

852
01:26:22,339 --> 01:26:25,044
People said they saw the fleas.
"I can see the fleas.

853
01:26:25,133 --> 01:26:26,877
"Can't you see the fleas?"

854
01:26:27,636 --> 01:26:31,930
Clown fleas, high-wire fleas,
and fleas on parade.

855
01:26:38,146 --> 01:26:39,522
With this place...

856
01:26:41,733 --> 01:26:45,102
...I wanted to show them something
that wasn't an illusion.

857
01:26:46,112 --> 01:26:49,232
Something that was real.
Something that they could...

858
01:26:52,369 --> 01:26:53,827
...see and touch.

859
01:26:58,583 --> 01:27:00,991
An aim not devoid of merit.

860
01:27:05,507 --> 01:27:09,125
But you can't think through this one, John.
You have to feel it.

861
01:27:11,346 --> 01:27:13,089
You're absolutely right.

862
01:27:14,891 --> 01:27:17,180
Hiring Nedry was a mistake,
that's obvious.

863
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:20,015
We're overdependent on automation,
I can see that now.

864
01:27:20,104 --> 01:27:22,726
Next time, everything's correctable.

865
01:27:23,525 --> 01:27:26,728
Creation is an act of sheer will.

866
01:27:29,072 --> 01:27:31,029
Next time, it'll be flawless.

867
01:27:31,616 --> 01:27:34,949
It's still the flea circus. It's all an illusion.

868
01:27:35,078 --> 01:27:36,572
When we have control...

869
01:27:36,663 --> 01:27:39,332
You've never had control!
That's the illusion.

870
01:27:39,499 --> 01:27:42,168
I was overwhelmed
by the power of this place.

871
01:27:43,586 --> 01:27:44,997
I made a mistake, too.

872
01:27:45,129 --> 01:27:48,913
I didn't have enough respect
for that power, and it's out now.

873
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:54,719
The only thing that matters now
are the people we love.

874
01:27:56,891 --> 01:27:59,014
Alan, Lex, and Tim.

875
01:28:00,645 --> 01:28:03,764
John, they're out there,
where people are dying.

876
01:28:20,831 --> 01:28:21,946
It's good.

877
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,378
Spared no expense.

878
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:57,907
- Go away!
- It's okay. It's a Brachiosaurus.

879
01:28:58,577 --> 01:29:01,246
It's a "Veggie-saurus", Lex.
"Veggie-saurus. "

880
01:29:01,789 --> 01:29:02,820
Veggie.

881
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:05,707
Come on. Come on, girl.

882
01:29:09,922 --> 01:29:11,297
Come on, baby.

883
01:29:17,721 --> 01:29:19,215
I'm not letting go.

884
01:29:31,151 --> 01:29:33,986
- It looks like it has a cold.
- Yeah. Maybe.

885
01:29:34,363 --> 01:29:35,987
- Can I touch it?
- Sure.

886
01:29:36,323 --> 01:29:39,359
Just think of it as kind of a big cow.

887
01:29:42,746 --> 01:29:43,944
I like cows.

888
01:29:54,007 --> 01:29:56,332
Come on, girl. Come on up here, girl.

889
01:30:03,808 --> 01:30:05,053
God bless you.

890
01:30:11,441 --> 01:30:14,358
Great. Now she'll never try anything new.

891
01:30:14,903 --> 01:30:17,939
She'll sit in her room, never come out,
play on her computer.

892
01:30:18,031 --> 01:30:20,818
- I'm a hacker.
- That's what I said. You're a nerd.

893
01:30:20,909 --> 01:30:24,159
I am not a computer nerd.
I prefer to be called a hacker.

894
01:30:24,370 --> 01:30:25,485
God.

895
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:32,084
You know what this is?

896
01:30:34,005 --> 01:30:35,998
It's a dinosaur egg.

897
01:30:36,716 --> 01:30:39,919
The dinosaurs are breeding.

898
01:30:43,097 --> 01:30:47,177
But my grandpa said
all the dinosaurs were girls.

899
01:30:48,561 --> 01:30:50,803
- Amphibian DNA.
- What's that?

900
01:30:54,692 --> 01:30:59,734
The film said they used frog DNA
to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.

901
01:30:59,822 --> 01:31:03,108
They mutated the dinosaur genetic code.

902
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,402
And blended it with that of frogs.

903
01:31:09,332 --> 01:31:13,792
Some West African frogs have been known
to change sex from male to female...

904
01:31:13,878 --> 01:31:15,917
...in a single sex environment.

905
01:31:17,923 --> 01:31:19,466
Malcolm was right.

906
01:31:20,885 --> 01:31:21,916
Look.

907
01:31:30,686 --> 01:31:32,394
Life found a way.

908
01:31:35,733 --> 01:31:39,730
That's crazy. You're out of your mind.
He's absolutely out of his mind.

909
01:31:39,987 --> 01:31:42,193
Wait. What exactly would this mean?

910
01:31:42,281 --> 01:31:46,148
We're talking about a calculated risk,
which is the only option left to us.

911
01:31:46,243 --> 01:31:50,656
We'll neverfind the command Nedry used.
He's covered his tracks far too well.

912
01:31:51,206 --> 01:31:54,042
I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.

913
01:31:54,126 --> 01:31:58,669
- So, shutting down the entire system...
- Get somebody else. I won't do it.

914
01:31:58,756 --> 01:32:03,963
Shutting down the system is the only way
to wipe out everything he did.

915
01:32:05,054 --> 01:32:08,636
Now, as I understand it,
all the systems will then come back...

916
01:32:08,807 --> 01:32:11,512
...on their original start-up mode. Correct?

917
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:15,061
Theoretically, yes.
We've never shut down before.

918
01:32:15,147 --> 01:32:18,148
- It may not come back on.
- Would we get the phones back?

919
01:32:18,233 --> 01:32:19,858
Yes, again, in theory.

920
01:32:20,485 --> 01:32:23,901
What about the lysine contingency?
We could put that into effect.

921
01:32:23,989 --> 01:32:26,824
- What's that?
- That's absolutely out of the question.

922
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:29,744
The lysine contingency
prevents the spread of animals...

923
01:32:29,828 --> 01:32:31,702
...if they ever get off the island.

924
01:32:31,788 --> 01:32:35,453
Wu inserted a gene that creates
a faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.

925
01:32:35,542 --> 01:32:38,460
The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid, lysine.

926
01:32:38,545 --> 01:32:42,294
Unless they're supplied with lysine by us,
they slip into a coma and die.

927
01:32:42,382 --> 01:32:44,838
People are dying.

928
01:32:49,055 --> 01:32:51,428
Will you please shut down the system?

929
01:33:13,455 --> 01:33:15,115
Hold on to your butts.

930
01:33:35,018 --> 01:33:36,132
It's okay.

931
01:33:36,269 --> 01:33:38,938
Look, see that? It's on. It worked.

932
01:33:41,441 --> 01:33:43,813
What do you mean it worked?
Everything's off.

933
01:33:43,901 --> 01:33:48,030
Shutdown tripped the circuit breakers.
Turn them back on, reboot a few systems:

934
01:33:48,114 --> 01:33:51,483
Telephones, security doors,
half dozen others, but it worked.

935
01:33:51,576 --> 01:33:53,983
- System's ready.
- Where are the breakers?

936
01:33:54,078 --> 01:33:55,786
The shed at end of the compound.

937
01:33:55,872 --> 01:33:58,623
Three minutes, I'll have the power back on
in the park.

938
01:33:58,708 --> 01:34:01,792
Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker...

939
01:34:01,878 --> 01:34:05,211
...until Mr. Arnold returns,
and the whole system's running again.

940
01:34:05,506 --> 01:34:07,629
- I'm tired. I'm hot.
- I'm dirty.

941
01:34:08,634 --> 01:34:12,299
Looking at the map,
I'd say the visitor's centre is just a mile...

942
01:34:13,055 --> 01:34:14,763
...over that rise there.

943
01:34:19,228 --> 01:34:20,259
What is that?

944
01:34:23,024 --> 01:34:25,230
Tim, can you tell me what they are?

945
01:34:32,283 --> 01:34:33,528
Gallimimus.

946
01:34:33,617 --> 01:34:36,108
Are those meat-eating?

947
01:34:37,746 --> 01:34:39,027
"Meat-asauruses"?

948
01:34:44,044 --> 01:34:46,500
Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes.

949
01:34:46,589 --> 01:34:49,293
Just like a flock of birds
evading a predator.

950
01:34:50,801 --> 01:34:53,921
They're flocking this way.

951
01:35:36,888 --> 01:35:39,095
- I want to go now.
- Just look how it eats.

952
01:35:39,182 --> 01:35:40,214
Please.

953
01:35:40,559 --> 01:35:43,310
I bet you'll never look at birds
the same way again.

954
01:35:43,395 --> 01:35:45,471
- Yes.
- Go now.

955
01:35:47,315 --> 01:35:49,985
Okay. Keep low and follow me.

956
01:35:52,404 --> 01:35:54,195
Look how much blood.

957
01:35:56,408 --> 01:35:58,531
God. Something went wrong.

958
01:35:59,411 --> 01:36:02,945
Something's happened.
Something's wrong.

959
01:36:05,667 --> 01:36:07,245
This is just a delay.

960
01:36:07,335 --> 01:36:10,420
That's all it is.
All major theme parks have delays.

961
01:36:10,672 --> 01:36:15,001
When they opened Disneyland in 1956,
nothing worked.

962
01:36:15,427 --> 01:36:19,127
If the Pirates of the Caribbean
breaks down, the pirates don't eat tourists.

963
01:36:19,222 --> 01:36:24,098
I can't wait any more. Something's wrong.
I'm gonna go get the power back on.

964
01:36:24,394 --> 01:36:27,478
You can't just stroll down the road,
you know.

965
01:36:27,647 --> 01:36:30,933
Don't let's be too hasty.
I mean, he's only been gone...

966
01:36:33,611 --> 01:36:35,651
- I'm going with you.
- Okay.

967
01:36:51,295 --> 01:36:52,327
Sorry.

968
01:36:56,342 --> 01:37:00,589
Now, this isn't going to be just like
switching on the kitchen light.

969
01:37:00,721 --> 01:37:04,090
But I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.

970
01:37:08,688 --> 01:37:09,683
Right.

971
01:37:15,736 --> 01:37:17,776
It ought to be me, really, going.

972
01:37:17,863 --> 01:37:20,699
- Why?
- I'm a... And you're a...

973
01:37:22,201 --> 01:37:24,526
- Look.
- Come on, let's go.

974
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:27,870
We can discuss sexism
in survival situations when I get back.

975
01:37:27,957 --> 01:37:31,575
You just take me through this step by step.
I'm on Channel 2.

976
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:11,332
The shutdown must've turned off
all the fences.

977
01:38:11,959 --> 01:38:15,624
Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the Raptor pen.

978
01:38:21,593 --> 01:38:22,756
Come on, this way.

979
01:38:30,269 --> 01:38:32,226
I can see the shed from here.

980
01:38:32,437 --> 01:38:34,181
We can make it if we run.

981
01:38:34,523 --> 01:38:37,061
No. We can't.

982
01:38:37,985 --> 01:38:39,016
Why not?

983
01:38:39,778 --> 01:38:41,735
Because we're being hunted.

984
01:38:43,073 --> 01:38:45,066
In the bushes, straight ahead.

985
01:38:47,702 --> 01:38:48,983
It's all right.

986
01:38:49,579 --> 01:38:50,955
Like hell it is.

987
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:55,457
Run. Towards the shed.

988
01:38:57,671 --> 01:38:59,129
I've got her.

989
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:01,584
Go. Now!

990
01:39:20,777 --> 01:39:22,152
Mr. Arnold?

991
01:39:27,492 --> 01:39:28,737
John, I'm in.

992
01:39:29,327 --> 01:39:30,276
<i>Great.</i>

993
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:35,329
Ahead of you is a metal staircase.
Go down it.

994
01:39:36,376 --> 01:39:38,664
<i>Okay. Going down.</i>

995
01:39:39,587 --> 01:39:43,502
After 20 or 30 feet
you come to a T-junction. Take a left.

996
01:39:43,591 --> 01:39:46,711
- Have herfollow the main cable.
- I know how to read a schematic.

997
01:40:16,874 --> 01:40:19,081
I guess that means the power's off.

998
01:40:32,348 --> 01:40:34,969
- That's not funny.
- That was great.

999
01:40:37,478 --> 01:40:39,387
Well, maybe we, we could...

1000
01:40:57,248 --> 01:40:59,739
Damn it. Dead end.

1001
01:41:00,125 --> 01:41:01,370
Wait a minute.

1002
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:06,205
There should have been a right turn
back there somewhere.

1003
01:41:07,174 --> 01:41:08,123
Look above you.

1004
01:41:09,635 --> 01:41:13,502
<i>There should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction.</i>

1005
01:41:13,597 --> 01:41:14,760
Follow that.

1006
01:41:15,432 --> 01:41:17,591
Okay. Following the piping.

1007
01:41:20,270 --> 01:41:24,731
I bet I could climb over to the other side
before you could even get to the top.

1008
01:41:24,817 --> 01:41:27,142
- What would you give me?
- Respect.

1009
01:41:28,111 --> 01:41:30,151
Come on, guys, it's not a race.

1010
01:41:31,823 --> 01:41:33,068
I see the box.

1011
01:41:34,826 --> 01:41:36,534
It says, "High Voltage. "

1012
01:41:40,916 --> 01:41:41,912
Okay.

1013
01:41:46,004 --> 01:41:48,673
Good. Here we go.

1014
01:41:49,341 --> 01:41:50,539
Over the top.

1015
01:41:51,176 --> 01:41:52,801
Take your time.

1016
01:41:53,804 --> 01:41:54,799
Good. Come on.

1017
01:41:55,555 --> 01:41:57,464
Find yourfooting.

1018
01:41:59,726 --> 01:42:02,431
You can't throw the main switch by hand.

1019
01:42:02,521 --> 01:42:05,936
You've got to pump up the primer handle
in order to get the charge.

1020
01:42:06,024 --> 01:42:08,349
It's large, flat and grey.

1021
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:11,061
All right, here I go. Okay?

1022
01:42:12,572 --> 01:42:17,863
One, two, three, four.

1023
01:42:18,161 --> 01:42:19,786
Okay, charged.

1024
01:42:20,497 --> 01:42:24,281
Under the words "Contact Position,"
there's a round green button...

1025
01:42:24,584 --> 01:42:26,909
...which says "Push to Close. "

1026
01:42:27,462 --> 01:42:29,289
Push to close.

1027
01:42:32,801 --> 01:42:33,796
Push it.

1028
01:42:49,025 --> 01:42:52,975
The red buttons turn on
the individual park systems.

1029
01:42:53,863 --> 01:42:55,026
Switch them on.

1030
01:43:06,667 --> 01:43:08,874
- Get down now!
- You're gonna have to jump.

1031
01:43:08,961 --> 01:43:10,705
You crazy? I'm not gonna jump.

1032
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:13,501
- Do what Dr. Grant says!
- Let go. I'll count to three.

1033
01:43:13,591 --> 01:43:15,999
One, two, three!

1034
01:43:20,097 --> 01:43:21,841
I'm coming up to get you.

1035
01:43:21,933 --> 01:43:23,427
I've got to get Tim.

1036
01:43:23,851 --> 01:43:25,595
Okay. I'm gonna count to three.

1037
01:43:28,189 --> 01:43:29,185
One...

1038
01:43:31,150 --> 01:43:32,229
...two...

1039
01:43:43,329 --> 01:43:44,491
He's not breathing.

1040
01:43:49,752 --> 01:43:52,124
I think we're back in business!

1041
01:45:31,936 --> 01:45:33,181
Clever girl.

1042
01:45:57,503 --> 01:45:58,535
No, Tim!

1043
01:46:01,549 --> 01:46:03,423
Good boy.

1044
01:46:08,014 --> 01:46:09,212
Three.

1045
01:46:14,395 --> 01:46:15,474
Hello?

1046
01:46:27,325 --> 01:46:29,483
I'm gonna have to find the others.

1047
01:46:30,161 --> 01:46:32,912
Get you to a doctor.

1048
01:46:34,957 --> 01:46:37,246
- Lex, you look after Tim.
- Yeah.

1049
01:46:38,544 --> 01:46:40,501
Your hair is all sticking up.

1050
01:46:42,506 --> 01:46:44,795
Big Tim, the human piece of toast.

1051
01:46:49,096 --> 01:46:51,255
I'll be back soon. I promise.

1052
01:47:18,584 --> 01:47:19,580
Run.

1053
01:48:36,202 --> 01:48:38,112
Just the two Raptors, right?

1054
01:48:39,622 --> 01:48:41,496
You sure the third one's contained?

1055
01:48:41,583 --> 01:48:45,165
Yes, unless they figure out
how to open doors.

1056
01:49:11,779 --> 01:49:14,946
- What is it?
- It's a Velociraptor.

1057
01:49:17,743 --> 01:49:19,238
It's inside.

1058
01:49:44,812 --> 01:49:45,891
Follow me.

1059
01:52:21,467 --> 01:52:22,712
It's in there.

1060
01:52:23,594 --> 01:52:24,839
Control room.

1061
01:52:31,185 --> 01:52:34,471
- We can call for help?
- We've got to reboot the system first.

1062
01:52:37,316 --> 01:52:38,514
The door locks!

1063
01:52:39,527 --> 01:52:41,566
Ellie, boot up the door locks!

1064
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:52,907
No, boot up the door locks!

1065
01:52:53,958 --> 01:52:57,790
- Get back! Boot up the door locks.
- You can't hold it by yourself!

1066
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:09,719
It's a UNIX system. I know this.

1067
01:53:10,474 --> 01:53:12,550
It's all the files of the whole park.

1068
01:53:12,643 --> 01:53:15,893
It tells you everything.
I've got to find the right file.

1069
01:53:16,647 --> 01:53:18,224
Try to reach the gun.

1070
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:28,697
I can't get it unless I move.

1071
01:53:44,508 --> 01:53:47,081
This is it. This might be the right file.

1072
01:54:02,734 --> 01:54:04,312
- You got it!
- Yes!

1073
01:54:15,038 --> 01:54:16,069
What works?

1074
01:54:16,164 --> 01:54:18,869
All security systems are enabled.
We got it!

1075
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:29,625
Grant.

1076
01:54:30,053 --> 01:54:32,970
Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.

1077
01:54:33,473 --> 01:54:36,308
<i>- The children all right?
- The children are fine.</i>

1078
01:54:36,685 --> 01:54:40,054
Call the mainland.
Tell 'em to send the damn helicopters.

1079
01:54:41,272 --> 01:54:42,897
It's gonna cut through the glass!

1080
01:55:37,495 --> 01:55:38,360
Move!

1081
01:57:41,785 --> 01:57:46,078
After careful consideration,
I've decided not to endorse your park.

1082
