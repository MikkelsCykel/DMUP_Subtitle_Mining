Remember, I ride real horses now?

509
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:38,965
Well, I really ought to get going.

510
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Oh, Adrian,
what book did you loan Nick?

511
00:37:47,035 --> 00:37:49,517
Book?

512
00:37:49,552 --> 00:37:51,965
Oh.

513
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Well, that must have been
WutheringHeights.

514
00:37:57,035 --> 00:37:59,000
Did you like it?

515
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:00,965
Yes.

516
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Very much.

517
00:38:03,035 --> 00:38:03,965
Hmm.

518
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,500
WutheringHeights, huh?

519
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:07,000
Sounds femme to me.

520
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,000
Anyway, I-

521
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:08,965
Ahem.

522
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I really ought to go.

523
00:38:13,035 --> 00:38:13,965
Bye, Nick.

524
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Thanks for returning the book.

525
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:43,965
Hi.

526
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Can we talk?

527
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:46,965
Sorry?

528
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I was wondering
ifwe could talk.

529
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,000
What do you want
to talk about?

530
00:38:51,035 --> 00:38:52,965
Well, um...

531
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I don't know.
To tell you the truth,

532
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:58,000
it's-it's a little awkward.

533
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,965
Uh...

534
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
would you mind stopping that?

535
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:05,965
Why?

536
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,965
Never mind.

537
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,965
I hardly know where to begin.

538
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I- I guess
what I want to say is...

539
00:39:19,035 --> 00:39:22,517
I really like you, Adrian.

540
00:39:22,552 --> 00:39:25,276
I really like you, too.

541
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:28,155
No, I-I mean, as a friend.

542
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,595
I mean, let's face it.

543
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,965
You're 14.
I'm 28.

544
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
That's a big difference.

545
00:39:35,035 --> 00:39:37,965
Whateveryou say.

546
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,965
No. No. Seriously, Adrian.

547
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Now, I want you to know
you can count on me.

548
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:47,000
I'll always be your friend,

549
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:50,000
no matter what, okay?

550
00:39:50,035 --> 00:39:50,965
Okay.

551
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Like that night up
at the lighthouse

552
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:56,965
when we kissed?

553
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,965
Now, that was a mistake, Adrian.

554
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Was sneaking in to watch me
undress a mistake?

555
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:09,517
Hmm?

556
00:40:09,552 --> 00:40:13,965
Nick...

557
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
ever do a virgin?

558
00:40:16,035 --> 00:40:17,965
What?

559
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,965
I know you want to.

560
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Now, look.
Let's avoid any confusion here.

561
00:40:23,035 --> 00:40:25,000
I'll make this very simple foryou.

562
00:40:25,035 --> 00:40:26,965
You're too young for me.

563
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:35,000
There's nothing between us.
Nothing.

564
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:50,965
Hmm.

565
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,965
Wait till you see this.

566
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I can't believe
you bought me a car.

567
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:55,965
I didn't.

568
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I won't feel
any different about you.

569
00:40:59,035 --> 00:41:00,517
I didn't buy you a car.

570
00:41:00,552 --> 00:41:02,000
Then what's the surprise?

571
00:41:02,035 --> 00:41:05,017
Wait right here.

572
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:08,000
Okay. Grab an end.

573
00:41:08,035 --> 00:41:08,965
You ready?

574
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Never been so ready.

575
00:41:14,035 --> 00:41:14,965
Huh?

576
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Check it out.
Factory paint.

577
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:18,965
I got matching vinyl interior.

578
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
This is one of
the fiinest pieces of iron

579
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:35,000
ever came out of Detroit.

580
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:44,965
Sugar?

581
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,965
Well, um...

582
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
ifyou didn't, uh,
actually see her-

583
00:41:50,035 --> 00:41:50,965
is that right?

584
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,500
No, I didn't actually see her.

585
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:56,000
So you're not absolutely certain.

586
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:59,517
Well, no, I'm...

587
00:41:59,552 --> 00:42:02,965
not absolutely.

588
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But-But I do feel-

589
00:42:05,035 --> 00:42:06,965
But I-I just...

590
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,500
I just feel very strongly
that she did this.

591
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:10,965
Mm-hmm.

592
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Hi. I'm going out with Cheyenne.

593
00:42:14,035 --> 00:42:16,017
Hi, Nick.

594
00:42:16,052 --> 00:42:17,965
Adrian...

595
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I have a question.

596
00:42:19,035 --> 00:42:19,965
Hmm?

597
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Did you scratch up Nick's car?

598
00:42:23,035 --> 00:42:33,000
Why would I do that?

599
00:42:33,035 --> 00:42:34,000
Got to go.

600
00:42:34,035 --> 00:42:38,965
Bye.

601
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,965
Well, uh, that's that, then.

602
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Can I have some ofthat newspaper?

603
00:42:44,035 --> 00:42:50,017
Not the crossword.

604
00:42:50,052 --> 00:42:55,965
Hey, Cheyenne.

605
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I- I need to talk to you...

606
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,000
about Adrian.

607
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:00,965
What?

608
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Not now.
Meet me in back ofthe orchard

609
00:43:04,035 --> 00:43:07,000
at 7:00 when the streetlights come on.

610
00:43:07,035 --> 00:43:08,000

Hi, Cheyenne.

613
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Why are you so slow?

614
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:26,965
Everybody asks me that.

615
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Cheyenne, come on!
We're waiting!

616
00:43:30,035 --> 00:43:30,965
Shit.

617
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Don't worry.
Go get dressed.

618
00:43:33,035 --> 00:43:35,000
I'll take care of Buttercup.

619

tack her up.

in the hospital.

Hello, Adrian.

659
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,965
You know, I was wondering.

660
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Have you ever been
out to the lighthouse?

You mean Shelter Point?

662

Yeah. Make-out place.

663
00:46:46,061 --> 00:46:48,000
Not since high school.

664
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:48,965
It's nice.

665
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
You should defiinitely go.

666
00:46:52,035 --> 00:46:55,965
Nick took me.

667
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Maybe he'll take you sometime.
