writing these long diatribes
about how he'll never walk again

about how I love
to just sit around

the end of the block than walk.

I called him crippy-boy.

There's a crippled guy
who found a way

to reach out to a world
he feels isolated from,

Ow.

324
00:15:53,472 --> 00:15:54,769
Dude, how old are you?

325
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:56,103
<i>(laughs)</i>

326
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:58,109
You know I'm 19, Randal.

327
00:15:58,143 --> 00:16:00,771
You wouldn't work for me
last week, remember?

328
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:03,110
'Cause you said working
on my birthday

329
00:16:03,148 --> 00:16:05,275
would help me build character.

<i>(sighs)</i>

00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:09,286
Well, at least you spelled
"cock" right this time.

332
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:11,289
Why the fuck are you
still getting rides

333
00:16:11,323 --> 00:16:12,950
from your mother?

334
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:14,117
And even worse,

335
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,127
what the fuck are you
kissing her good-bye for?

336
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:18,288
What is she,
your fuckin' prom date?

337
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,957
You're not gonna bother me
today, Randal.

338
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:21,124
I'm in too good a mood.

339
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,134
Because your mom
slipped you the tongue?

340
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:27,468
No, because I just read online
that there's gonna be

341
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:29,565
a live-action
Transformers movie.

Well... I mean, as you know,

344
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:35,413
my online handle
is Optimus Prime.

345
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:37,415
I know that.
I wish I didn't.

346
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:40,907
Well, so not only is it awesome

347
00:16:40,952 --> 00:16:44,251
that there's gonna be a
live-action Transformers movie,

348

for when the movie comes out.

351
00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:57,093
Oh, you're gonna be rolling
in the pussy, man.

352
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:58,830
Don't be gross.

Says the guy
who was just playing

354
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:02,205
tonsil hockey with his mother.

355
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,537
Mr. Dante!

356

Leave Elias alone, Randal!

357

Don't look at his wee-wee.

Dude, the Transformers sucked.

359
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:14,779
Oh, no, they didn't.

360
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,184
They were more
than meets the eye.

361

<i>(scoffs)</i>

362

They could beat the pants
off Ranger Danger any day.

363
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:21,550
Yeah. I'll lose sleep wondering
whether you're right

364
00:17:21,593 --> 00:17:23,026
- about that or not.
- Ow.

365
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:25,461
I thought you weren't even
allowed to watch a lot of TV

366
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:27,294
in your house 'cause you're all
Christian and shit.

367
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:29,596
Well, as it turns out,
cars and trucks

368
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:31,397
that turn into...

369
00:17:31,436 --> 00:17:35,463
robots aren't really
that blasphemous,

370
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,474
because my pastor says

371
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:40,204
that machines can turn
into other machines,

372
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:42,975
and it's not a sleight
against God.

373
00:17:43,014 --> 00:17:44,709
Transformers were
a total sleight against God,

374
00:17:44,749 --> 00:17:47,411
inasmuch as God sent
His only begotten son

375
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:49,977
to die on the cross
to redeem mankind,

376
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:51,215
and all we did to pay him back

377
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:54,384
was make terrible fucking
cartoons like the Transformers.

378
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:57,224
Nice shot.

379
00:17:57,262 --> 00:18:02,063
Well, 'cause at Bible camp,
we made this flow chart which...

380
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,397
I mean, I don't know,

381
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:06,563
kind of, like, proved
or whatever that...

382
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:07,697
Well, okay...

383
00:18:07,739 --> 00:18:09,001
Bible camp?!

384
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,029
Since God created...

385
00:18:11,076 --> 00:18:13,271
Since God created man,

386
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:16,610
and man created
the Transformers...

387
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:20,741
..the Transformers are like
a gift from God, Randal.

388
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:23,583
No, sir.
They are not a gift from God.

389
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:25,817
They are an unholy curse

390
00:18:25,857 --> 00:18:27,791
from the beast
we call the Desolate One.

391
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:29,259
I don't really want
to hear this, Randal.

392
00:18:29,294 --> 00:18:30,818
The first of the fallen,

393
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:32,193
the spoiler of virgins,

She's your boss.

You can't be friends

No, you can't be friends

I like my boss.

You spend an awful lot

I spend an awful lot of time

you're harboring an unrequited
homosexual crush on me.

We're just friends.

That's what I keep telling you.

You're fucking
around with the boss.

Yeah, that's why I'm moving
to Florida with my fiancee.

435
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:03,847
Why would you want

Secondly, if I was cheating

it wouldn't be with a teenager.

Why not?

444
00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:21,470
The best part of this job

You show me one
33-year-old chick

17-year-olds

They're up for anything.

454

They even like it when
you go ass to mouth.

Are you serious?

458
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:48,330
I don't fuck around when
it comes to ass to mouth.

459
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:49,856
DANTE:
You never go ass to mouth.

460
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:51,232
It's never my idea.

461
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:53,260
These young girls today
get all horned up,

462
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:55,101
and they tell you
to go ass to mouth.

463

You never go
ass to mouth, Randal!

464

You sound like my mom.

465

Becks, do you ever
go ass to mouth?

466
00:20:59,544 --> 00:21:00,977
You never go ass to mouth.

You've never gone ass to mouth?

468

You never go ass to mouth.

Not even ever.

472

You're both so repressed.

473
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:10,846
All right, look,

474
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:12,880
I know you've given
a blow job, right?

475
00:21:12,924 --> 00:21:14,892
I haven't even put
my purse down yet.

476
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:16,052
That's a yes.

477
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:18,255

gone down on chicks.

478
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:19,593
What's your point?

479
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:20,620
Well,

480
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:22,826
when you're done chowing down
on the no-no parts

481
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:24,425
of your lover,
you kiss him, right?

482
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:26,096
That's just like going

00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:26,250
and will never win.

644
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,587
Bones.

645
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,785
Oh, sick burn.

646
00:28:28,826 --> 00:28:30,191
Let me tell you something.

647
00:28:30,228 --> 00:28:32,458
If Peter Jackson
really wanted to blow me away

648
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,431
with those "Rings" movies,
he would've ended the third one

649
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:36,933
on the logical closure point,

650
00:28:36,968 --> 00:28:39,368
not the 25 endings
that followed.

651
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:40,870
What's the logical
closure point?

652
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:42,065
Yeah, friend,

653
00:28:42,106 --> 00:28:43,437
enlighten us.

654
00:28:43,474 --> 00:28:46,307
When fucking Frito wakes up from
his little coma or whatever,

655
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:49,074
and the little hobbits are
jumping up and down on his bed,

656
00:28:49,113 --> 00:28:50,580
and Sam leans in the doorway

657
00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:52,480
and gives him
that very fuckin' gay look.

658
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,948
<i>ELIAS:
Not the Rings, Randal.</i>

659
00:28:53,985 --> 00:28:55,475
Say what you will about Jesus,

660
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,248
<i>but leave the Rings out of this.</i>

661
00:28:57,288 --> 00:28:59,688
I am gonna kick your ass
back to the Shire

662
00:28:59,724 --> 00:29:01,055
if you don't
shut your fuckin' mouth.

663
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:03,526
That look was so gay,
I thought Sam was gonna tell

664
00:29:03,561 --> 00:29:05,153
the little hobbits
to take a walk

665
00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:06,788
so he could saunter
over to Frodo

666
00:29:06,831 --> 00:29:08,128
and suck his fuckin' cock.

667
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:10,793
<i>Now, that would've been
an Academy Award-worthy ending.</i>

668
00:29:10,835 --> 00:29:14,430
Hey, faggot, they're not gay.
They're hobbits.

669
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:17,065
And then right after
the Sam-Frodo suckfest,

670
00:29:17,108 --> 00:29:18,905
right before the credits roll,

671
00:29:18,943 --> 00:29:21,571
Sam fucking flat-out bricks
in Frodo's mouth.

672
00:29:21,612 --> 00:29:24,012
I swear...

673
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:25,242
Fuck you!

674
00:29:28,286 --> 00:29:30,049
<i>(laughs): I made fun of
Lord of the Rings so hard,</i>

675
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:32,453
it made some super-geek puke
all over the counter.

676
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,014
Where do we keep
the mop and bucket

677
00:29:34,058 --> 00:29:35,457
so I can have
Elias clean it up?

678
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:37,757
In the closet with the rest
of the cleaning products.

679
00:29:37,795 --> 00:29:41,231
We have cleaning products?

680
00:29:41,265 --> 00:29:44,462
<i>(light jazz playing
over radio)</i>

681
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:46,697
Why does it smell so weird
in here?

682
00:29:46,737 --> 00:29:48,170
Buh-bye.

683
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:51,197
I'm on to you.

684
00:29:53,978 --> 00:29:56,003
You know he's not
gonna make it here long

685
00:29:56,047 --> 00:29:58,811
once you're not here to protect
him anymore, don't you?

686
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:01,215
Well, you're the one out
there encouraging him,

687
00:30:01,252 --> 00:30:03,220
advocating ass to mouth.

688
00:30:03,254 --> 00:30:06,121
I wasn't advocating it,
you big prude.

689
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:08,284
I just said it was fine
once in a while.

690
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:10,294
Like you wouldn't do it
if Emma told you to.

691
00:30:10,328 --> 00:30:11,818
<i>(scoffs):
Christ, no!</i>

692
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:14,092
Oh, I thought love
knew no bounds.

693
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:17,665
Ew. That came off
kind of catty, didn't it?

694
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:19,636
A little daytime soapish, yeah.

695
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,796
I'm sorry.

696
00:30:20,838 --> 00:30:22,499
I don't know why I said that.

697
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,235
I actually kind of like Emma.

698
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:25,333
So do I.

699
00:30:25,376 --> 00:30:27,469
So that's why
you're getting married!

700
00:30:27,511 --> 00:30:29,445
I can't wait until
you get engaged,

701
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,005
so I can bust your balls as
hard as you've busted mine.

702
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:34,415
You're going to be waiting
a long time, sir.

703
00:30:34,452 --> 00:30:35,885
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.

704
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,115
You're the cold-hearted
ice princess

705
00:30:38,155 --> 00:30:40,089
that doesn't believe
in marriage.

706
00:30:40,124 --> 00:30:42,319
I'm not saying that
it's not all right for you,

707
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,520
but, yes, I do think

708
00:30:43,561 --> 00:30:45,961
that marriage goes
against our primal nature.

709
00:30:45,996 --> 00:30:47,122
To be loved?

710
00:30:47,164 --> 00:30:49,758
To fuck as much as possible...

711
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,531
spread the seed around
and keep the species going.

712
00:30:53,571 --> 00:30:55,664
And all that shit
they feed us in the movies

713
00:30:55,706 --> 00:30:57,333
and greeting cards
is just propaganda

714
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,969
to get us to marry, have kids
and keep the economy going.

715
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,478
Marriage is just
the keystone to economics.

716
00:31:02,546 --> 00:31:03,911
You're such a sappy girl.

717
00:31:03,948 --> 00:31:06,041
- Mm.
- Are you trying to tell me

718
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,812
you don't believe in love,
Beckalah?

719
00:31:07,852 --> 00:31:09,149
In romantic love,

720
00:31:09,186 --> 00:31:10,448
no.

721
00:31:10,488 --> 00:31:12,615
Like, I love my parents.

722
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:15,250
I love my car.
I love you.

723
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:17,920
But romantic love,
hearts and flowers,

724
00:31:17,962 --> 00:31:20,760
"There's only one person
out there for me"?

725
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:23,494
Come on, you know how many
people there are out there?

726
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:24,933
Odds are there's always going

727
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:26,960
to be someone who's
a better match for you

728
00:31:27,004 --> 00:31:28,699
than the person
you end up marrying.

729
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:29,899
So based on your theory,

730
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,340
there's someone out there
better for me than Emma.

731
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:35,209
Oh, no,
I'm not touching that one.

732
00:31:35,246 --> 00:31:36,679
Wait a second.

733
00:31:36,714 --> 00:31:38,409
You don't think
I really love her?

734
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:40,610
<i>(sighs):
I think...</i>

735
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:42,812
you love what she represents.

736
00:31:42,853 --> 00:31:44,252
Which is?

737
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:46,483
Come on, Dante, she was
the girl who wouldn't give you

738
00:31:46,524 --> 00:31:48,014
the time of day
back in high school.

739
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:49,923
And years later,
after she's played the field

740
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,690
and realized how unsatisfying
the so-called "hotties" are,

741
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,891
she's finally gone
with someone who looks...

742
00:31:54,932 --> 00:31:56,194
Oh, my God,

743
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:57,996
you're gonna say
"fugly," aren't you?

744
00:31:58,035 --> 00:31:59,093
Unconventional!

745
00:31:59,136 --> 00:32:00,364
Ah, nice backpedal.

746
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:02,099
<i>Thank you.
(laughs)</i>

747
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:03,800
It took her a few years

748
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:05,138
to finally figure out
that thing

749
00:32:05,176 --> 00:32:07,235
that every mother tries
to teach their little girl

750
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:08,609
but she has to learn on her own,

751
00:32:08,646 --> 00:32:10,978
and that's that guys
that look like you

752
00:32:11,015 --> 00:32:13,040
have a lot more to offer,
because you'll always

753
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,607
try harder than the pretty boy.

754
00:32:14,652 --> 00:32:17,416
What am I, some hideous
fucking CHUD over here?

755
00:32:17,455 --> 00:32:20,390
<i>(laughs):
No, you're a catch... kind of.</i>

756
00:32:20,424 --> 00:32:22,790
And Emma's a catch, too.

757
00:32:22,827 --> 00:32:24,818
'Cause not only
is she pretty, but...

758
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:27,387
she'll make all your decisions
for you.

759
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:30,264
Which is lucky,
because you're pretty terrible

760
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:32,166
at making decisions.

761
00:32:32,203 --> 00:32:34,137
So my last day
is all about you telling me

762
00:32:34,171 --> 00:32:35,900
what an ugly,
indecisive loser I am?

763
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,032
<i>(laughs)</i>

764
00:32:37,074 --> 00:32:38,905
Come on, you worked
at Quick Stop

765
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:40,501
for, like, a decade,

766
00:32:40,544 --> 00:32:43,809
and you've been here
for a year almost,

767
00:32:43,848 --> 00:32:46,373
and since day one at both jobs,

768
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:48,112
all you've ever said
is how you needed

769
00:32:48,152 --> 00:32:49,517
to get out
and start your life.

770
00:32:49,587 --> 00:32:51,782
And it wasn't until Emma walked
through the door and was,

771
00:32:51,822 --> 00:32:53,414
like, "Come down
to Florida with me,

772
00:32:53,457 --> 00:32:54,788
"and I'll fuck your brains out,

773
00:32:54,825 --> 00:32:57,055
and my daddy will give you
a job, and blah-blah,"

774
00:32:57,094 --> 00:32:59,255
that you actually went
and did something about it.

775
00:32:59,296 --> 00:33:00,695
And I get it... it's...

776
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:03,757
she's your golden ticket, dude.

777
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:05,234
So, uh...

778
00:33:06,203 --> 00:33:07,670
..what's that make you?

779
00:33:10,241 --> 00:33:14,371
I'm just the girl who fucks
ugly, indecisive losers

780
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:17,209
in the kitchen
once this place is closed.

781

J- RAM Radio.
Right around high noon...

785
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:33,560
So, we're never gonna talk
about it, are we?

786
00:33:35,165 --> 00:33:38,293
What is there to say?

787
00:33:38,335 --> 00:33:40,200
Do you regret it?

788
00:33:40,237 --> 00:33:41,966
Do you?

789
00:33:42,006 --> 00:33:44,975
I regret that it was
on the prep station table.

790
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:46,772
Yeah, you regret it...
you weren't the one

791
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,038
who got mayo in your cooch.

792

<i>(both laughing)</i>

793
00:33:57,288 --> 00:33:59,848
What do you want me to say?

00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,881
We were drunk, you know?

795
00:34:01,926 --> 00:34:03,826
It just kind of happened.

796
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:06,159
You're just lucky

797
00:34:06,196 --> 00:34:08,756
I'm not one of those monogamists
like your girlfriend.

798
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:11,962
Otherwise, I might try
to make you stay in Jersey.

799
00:34:12,002 --> 00:34:14,232
If anyone could do it,
it'd be you.

800
00:34:24,048 --> 00:34:26,949
Dude, your old lady's out here
looking for you.

801
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:28,076
<i>(door creaks)</i>

802
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,083
<i>(whispers):
Yeah.</i>

803
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:41,321
Come outside with me.
I've got a surprise for you.

804
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:54,234
That's my surprise?

805
00:34:54,278 --> 00:34:55,802
No.

806
00:34:57,147 --> 00:35:00,412
# Goodbye, horses... #

807
00:35:06,924 --> 00:35:08,152
Hey.

808
00:35:09,627 --> 00:35:11,117
Oh.

809
00:35:11,161 --> 00:35:13,220
So, um...

810
00:35:13,263 --> 00:35:15,857
are you looking for
a good Transformers site?

811
00:35:15,899 --> 00:35:18,925
Because at CarsToBots. Com,

812
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:21,733
you can get an avatar

813
00:35:21,772 --> 00:35:25,936
that's your picture
morphed to look like a robot.

814
00:35:25,976 --> 00:35:27,443
Come on, man.

815
00:35:27,478 --> 00:35:29,207
You know I only surf
Transformers sites

816
00:35:29,246 --> 00:35:32,647
when there's girls around,
so they can see how cool I am.

817
00:35:34,852 --> 00:35:36,786
So what are you doing then?

818
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,256
Trying to secure a going away
present for Mr. Dante.

819
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,382
Really?

820
00:35:41,425 --> 00:35:44,917
Well, how about
an Arwen sword replica?

821
00:35:44,962 --> 00:35:46,827
What?

822
00:35:46,864 --> 00:35:49,628
Uh...

823
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:52,659
'Cause it's, like,
thoughtful and practical.

824
00:35:52,703 --> 00:35:57,504
I was thinking of something
a little more sexy.

825
00:35:57,541 --> 00:36:01,637
Well, what's sexier than
an elf princess's sword?

826
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,442
A donkey show.

827
00:36:03,514 --> 00:36:04,538
What's that?

828
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:07,015
You ever see a chick
give a mule a blow job?

829
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:08,780
<i>(screeching):
Oh, no!</i>

830
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:10,878
Shh!

831
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:12,286
Jesus!

832
00:36:12,322 --> 00:36:14,722
If you spoil this,
I'm gonna brain you.

833
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,749
You gonna keep your mouth shut?

834
00:36:16,794 --> 00:36:18,455
<i>(muffled):
Yes.</i>

835
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:19,461
God.

836
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,725
That's bestiality, Randal.

837
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,824
At its finest, I hope.

838
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:25,835
Who'd want to see
something like that?

839
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:28,337
Me, Dante, you.

840
00:36:28,372 --> 00:36:29,964
I don't want to see
something like that.

841
00:36:30,007 --> 00:36:31,872
Why would you want to see
something like that?

842
00:36:31,909 --> 00:36:33,467
Because it's fucked up.

843
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,670
And I want to see

844
00:36:34,712 --> 00:36:37,272
if a chick with a mouthful
of donkey spunk swallows.

845
00:36:37,314 --> 00:36:38,679
All right, here we go.

846
00:36:38,716 --> 00:36:41,116
"Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud.

847
00:36:41,151 --> 00:36:43,642
"Straight from
their dirty debut in Tijuana,

848
00:36:43,687 --> 00:36:45,587
"Kelly's taking it on the road.

849
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:48,090
Taking it in the ass, that is."

850
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:51,288
You got to give it up for Oscar
Wilde-like wordplay that good.

851
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,955
Do they show pictures?

852
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:55,829
Only one of Kinky Kelly
sucking off Optimus Prime.

853
00:36:55,866 --> 00:36:56,833
Really?

854
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:58,459
Ow.

855
00:36:58,502 --> 00:36:59,969
Let me borrow your cell phone.

856
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:00,992
Whoa.

857
00:37:01,038 --> 00:37:02,938
Well, 'cause, I'm only
supposed to use it

858
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:05,066
to call my parents
in case of an emergency.

859
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:06,235
This is an emergency.

860
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:08,107
We got to lock up
Kinky Kelly for tonight,

861
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:11,046
so we can give Mr. Dante
a memorable send-off.

862
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:13,879
You love Mr. Dante, don't you?

863
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:15,179
In a non-gay way.

864
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:16,618
Then give me your phone.

865
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:18,746
'Cause Mr. Dante's never
seen a donkey show.

866
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:21,280
And it'd be nice to give
him this before he goes off

867
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:23,623
to Florida and gets married and
does all those other things

868
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,150
that prevent a guy
from ever seeing

869
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:26,992
a fucked-up donkey
show in his lifetime.

870
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,361
Hello.

871
00:37:28,398 --> 00:37:31,458
Uh, I was hoping to schedule
Kinky Kelly for a performance.

872
00:37:31,568 --> 00:37:33,433
Tonight.

873
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,097
Okay.

874
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:36,766
I'm on hold.

875
00:37:36,807 --> 00:37:39,833
Fingers crossed.

876
00:37:39,877 --> 00:37:43,278
We should probably
cross dicks, too.

877
00:37:43,313 --> 00:37:44,280
No.

878
00:37:44,314 --> 00:37:46,305
BECKY:
Work, work, work.

879
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,079
That's all you ever
think about, Hicks.

880
00:37:48,118 --> 00:37:48,948
Hey, Becks.

881
00:37:48,986 --> 00:37:50,715
Hey, Emma.

882
00:37:52,222 --> 00:37:53,849
Great shirt.

883
00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:55,324
Isn't it?
I love it.

884
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,657
What I love even more are these.

885
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:58,683
These came in early,

886
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:00,890
and I just had to come back
and show Dante.

887
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:02,762
And give you yours, of course.

888
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,200
And I have one
for Randal, I guess.

889
00:38:05,235 --> 00:38:06,964
What is it?

890
00:38:07,004 --> 00:38:08,403
Look, I know it's
three months away,

891
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:11,271
but it would mean so much to us
if you could make the trip down.

892
00:38:11,308 --> 00:38:13,776
Well... yeah.

893
00:38:15,112 --> 00:38:16,579
Uh, I wouldn't miss it.

894
00:38:16,613 --> 00:38:18,877
I thought we were waiting
till we got down there

895
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:20,213
before we picked a date.

896
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,115
Oh, him is so cute.

897
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:23,551
Him thinking again, huh?

898
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:26,583
If we left anything
up to these jackals,

899
00:38:26,623 --> 00:38:28,318
nothing would ever
get done, would it?

900
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:31,617
I'm just teasing.

901
00:38:36,266 --> 00:38:38,734
Guess you got to make their
decisions for 'em sometimes.

902
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:47,434
All right, I've got it.

903
00:38:47,477 --> 00:38:48,466
I will see you then.

904
00:38:48,545 --> 00:38:50,069
Thank you.

905
00:38:50,113 --> 00:38:51,910
My friend, tonight,

906
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:54,474
we bring a bit of TJ
to the Jersey 'burbs.

907
00:38:54,518 --> 00:38:55,849
<i>(door moos electronically)</i>

908
00:38:55,886 --> 00:38:57,444
Well, I don't know
about this, Randal.

909
00:38:57,487 --> 00:38:59,478
I mean, how do we know
this isn't a hoax?

910
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,455
Like, were there any
pictures on the Web site?

911
00:39:01,491 --> 00:39:02,924
Strangely, no.

912
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,520
But if you've seen pics of
one chick sucking off a donkey,

913
00:39:05,562 --> 00:39:07,723
you've seen them all.

914
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,425
Well, what if you
haven't ever seen pics

915
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:11,195
of anything like that?

916
00:39:11,235 --> 00:39:13,430
Well, then you must be
as blind as Anne Frank.

917
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,665
'Cause what's the point in
having an Internet connection

918
00:39:15,706 --> 00:39:18,140
if you're not using it to look
at weird, fucked-up pictures

919
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:20,166
of dirty sex
you'll never have yourself?

920
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,445
Ho-ly shit.

921
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,115
You know, I've never pieced
this together until right now.

922
00:39:34,157 --> 00:39:35,624
You're a virgin, aren't you?

923
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:37,456
You know I have
a girlfriend, Randal.

924
00:39:37,494 --> 00:39:38,392
Oh, yeah.

925
00:39:38,428 --> 00:39:39,622
What's her name again?

926
00:39:39,663 --> 00:39:41,631
Myra Hodgkiss.

927
00:39:41,665 --> 00:39:43,428
You made her up, didn't you?

928
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:45,162
That name sounds so made-up.

929
00:39:45,202 --> 00:39:47,670
No.

930
00:39:47,704 --> 00:39:50,036
Seriously, Elias, have you
and Myra had sex yet?

931
00:39:50,073 --> 00:39:52,439
Well, that's just
kind of personal, Randal.

932
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:53,465
Come on!

933
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,944
I tell you about
my sex life all the time.

934
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,276
I let you smell my fingers

935
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:58,975
after I fucked
Taton Weathers' kid sister

936
00:39:59,016 --> 00:40:00,643
in the office
that one time, didn't I?

937
00:40:00,684 --> 00:40:03,244
You kind of made me
smell your fingers.

938
00:40:04,554 --> 00:40:07,148
Maybe you just
don't like the pussy.

939
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,987
Maybe you're all about the cock.

940
00:40:09,026 --> 00:40:11,256
No, no, I like the pussy.

941
00:40:11,295 --> 00:40:12,387
So come on.

942
00:40:12,429 --> 00:40:14,795
Did Myra ever give you a crack
at her crack or what?

943
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:17,629
Well, not that it's any
of your business, Randal,

944
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:18,828
but she can't.

945
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:20,336
Why?

946
00:40:21,705 --> 00:40:24,037
Jesus, Elias, come on.

947
00:40:24,074 --> 00:40:26,042
You got to start
trusting me more.

948
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:27,600
Because once Dante's gone,

949
00:40:27,644 --> 00:40:29,236
you're gonna be
my new best friend.

950
00:40:31,982 --> 00:40:33,142
No, I'm not.

951
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:35,344
Who the fuck else
am I gonna hang out with?

952
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:36,909
It's gonna be you and me, buddy.

953
00:40:36,954 --> 00:40:37,943
So come on.

954
00:40:37,988 --> 00:40:39,148
You got to start
trusting me more.

955
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:41,384
Open up and tell me shit.

956
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:45,122
Like why haven't you
fucked Myra yet?

957
00:40:45,162 --> 00:40:46,720
<i>(sighs)</i>

958

Well, we can't
because of Pillow Pants.

00:40:52,169 --> 00:40:54,194
What the fuck's Pillow Pants?

960
00:40:54,237 --> 00:40:58,333
Pillow Pants is a little troll
who lives in her pussy.

00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:10,213
Pillow Pants is her pussy troll.

962
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:11,720
Duh.

963
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:16,386
You know
how every girl's parents

964
00:41:16,426 --> 00:41:20,920
put a pussy troll in them
when the girls are young

965
00:41:20,964 --> 00:41:23,956
to keep them from having
premarital sex?

966
00:41:26,003 --> 00:41:27,368
Sure.

967
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:30,771
Well, Myra's is named
Pillow Pants.

968
00:41:30,807 --> 00:41:35,506
And so, even though she totally
wants to have sex with me,

969
00:41:35,545 --> 00:41:40,278
Myra says if I put
my thing in her,

970
00:41:40,317 --> 00:41:42,512
Pillow Pants will bite it off.

971
00:41:44,454 --> 00:41:48,015
So I got to wait
until Pillow Pants

972
00:41:48,058 --> 00:41:51,960
gets peed out of her body
on her 21st birthday

973
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:54,896
before we can have sex.

974
00:41:54,931 --> 00:41:57,525
And Myra told you this?

975
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:58,625
Boyfriends and girlfriends

976
00:41:58,668 --> 00:42:01,228
talk to each other
about sex stuff, Randal.

977
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,364
You'd know this
if you ever had a girlfriend.

978
00:42:03,407 --> 00:42:06,467
Have you and Myra
even kissed yet?

979
00:42:06,576 --> 00:42:09,977
We would have already,
if it wasn't for Lister Fiend.

980
00:42:12,015 --> 00:42:14,483
Lister Fiend is her mouth troll,
isn't it?

981
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:16,449
Women.

982
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:23,651
I'll be right back.

983
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,489
You are never gonna believe
what Elias just told me.

984
00:42:27,564 --> 00:42:28,622
Look who it is, Randal.

985
00:42:29,566 --> 00:42:31,591
Randal Graves.

986
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:33,125
You work here, too?

987
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,264
Jesus. Anyone else from
our graduating class back there?

988
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:37,273
RANDAL:
Well, well, well...

989
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:39,434
Pickle Fucker.

990
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:41,603
Man, look at you two
fun-ployees.

991
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:42,942
Nothing's changed.

992
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:44,970
You know, I'll bet
dollars to donuts,

993
00:42:45,015 --> 00:42:46,209
when you two aren't fighting

994
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:49,013
about who shot first,
Han or Greedo,

995
00:42:49,052 --> 00:42:51,043
you can still muster up
enough energy

996
00:42:51,088 --> 00:42:53,318
to make fun of other people.

997
00:42:53,356 --> 00:42:55,517
Yeah. So hurry up and order
and get out of here,

998
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:57,286
so we can make fun of you.

999
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:59,158
Oh, I don't know
if you're in a position

1000
00:42:59,196 --> 00:43:01,164
to make fun of anyone
anymore, Graves.

1001
00:43:01,198 --> 00:43:03,928
32 and you're
flipping burgers?

1002
00:43:03,967 --> 00:43:05,958
Before that, I'd heard
it was the Quick Stop

1003
00:43:06,002 --> 00:43:08,061
for, what, like, ten years?

1004
00:43:08,105 --> 00:43:11,302
We can't all be
Internet millionaires.

1005
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:13,803
Who's an Internet millionaire?

1006
00:43:13,844 --> 00:43:15,675
Elias, this is Lance Dowds.

1007
00:43:15,712 --> 00:43:17,043
We went to high school together.

1008
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,377
A few years ago,

1009
00:43:18,415 --> 00:43:20,849
he built a search engine which
compiles the lowest prices

1010
00:43:20,884 --> 00:43:23,444
of merchandise
you can buy online.

1011
00:43:23,487 --> 00:43:25,921
You might have heard of it...
MadDucketts. Com.

1012
00:43:25,956 --> 00:43:28,220
Didn't that just sell to Amazon
for, like, 20 million bucks?

1013
00:43:28,258 --> 00:43:29,748
RANDAL:
Yeah, but back before

1014
00:43:29,793 --> 00:43:32,785
he was the Mad Ducketts guy,
he was just Pickle Fucker.

1015
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:34,194
You see, freshman year,

1016
00:43:34,231 --> 00:43:36,290
the seniors would hunt us
down and put us through

1017
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:37,960
what they called initiations.

1018
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:39,298
They'd stuff us into lockers

1019
00:43:39,336 --> 00:43:41,361
or throw us in the girls'
shower room naked.

1020
00:43:41,404 --> 00:43:43,201
But Lance here
got the worst of it.

1021
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,265
The seniors yanked
down his pants,

1022
00:43:45,308 --> 00:43:46,832
and shoved a pickle up his ass,

1023
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:48,208
and made him walk ten feet.

1024
00:43:48,245 --> 00:43:51,237
The pickle fell out
before he hit the ten-foot mark.

1025
00:43:51,281 --> 00:43:56,446
He had to take a bite of it,
reinsert it and walk again.

1026
00:43:56,486 --> 00:43:57,851
Ew...

1027
00:43:57,888 --> 00:44:00,083
Yeah, but don't worry...
he made it.

1028
00:44:00,123 --> 00:44:02,318
His pickle was small enough
to stay wedged

1029
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:03,917
after only four bites.

1030
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,791
I'll bet you're the only guy
in the world

1031
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:07,456
who still remembers that,
Graves.

1032
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:10,294
Oh, I bet you still remember it
pretty vividly...

1033
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:11,300
Pickle Fucker.

1034
00:44:11,334 --> 00:44:12,562
ELIAS:
Do you have any interest

1035
00:44:12,602 --> 00:44:14,832
in building
the ultimate fan site

1036
00:44:14,871 --> 00:44:18,238
<i>for both The Lord of the Rings
and The Transformers?</i>

1037
00:44:18,275 --> 00:44:20,300
Because I'd moderate it
for free.

1038
00:44:21,178 --> 00:44:22,406
Ease up, Pillow Pants.

1039
00:44:22,445 --> 00:44:25,141
The dude's not into
your D&D, GoBots bullshit.

1040
00:44:25,182 --> 00:44:26,206
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1041
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:27,216
Don't insult the guy.

1042
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:30,242
The GoBots are like
the Kmart of Transformers.

1043
00:44:30,287 --> 00:44:32,847
Thank you!

1044
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,158
I keep telling them that.

1045
00:44:36,193 --> 00:44:37,990
Here, here's my e-mail address.

1046
00:44:38,028 --> 00:44:41,054
Drop me a line
with some of your ideas.

1047
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:42,086
Cool.

1048
00:44:48,505 --> 00:44:50,496
LANCE:
Okay, let's see.

1049
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:52,700
What do I want?

1050
00:44:52,742 --> 00:44:56,701
Uh... how about a Skinny Calf
with cheese and a Diet Coke?

1051
00:44:56,746 --> 00:44:59,442
I'll get your order.

1052
00:45:05,522 --> 00:45:06,546
Here you go.

1053
00:45:07,691 --> 00:45:08,919
Well, that was fast.

1054
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:10,358
And fresh.

1055
00:45:10,393 --> 00:45:12,384
Thanks. Come again.

1056
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:15,455
Yo, let's wrap this up
so I can get my Cow Tipper on.

1057
00:45:15,532 --> 00:45:16,692
You know what?

1058
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:17,722
Take mine.

1059
00:45:19,035 --> 00:45:21,003
Something tells me
I'm not gonna like it, am I?

1060
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:24,197
Wow, thanks, Pickle Fucker.

1061
00:45:25,442 --> 00:45:27,740
Yo, so Pickle Fucker
gave us free eats!

1062
00:45:27,777 --> 00:45:29,802
You know,
I don't eat fast food.

1063
00:45:29,846 --> 00:45:31,177
It's not good for you.

1064
00:45:31,214 --> 00:45:35,116
But when I heard you guys
were actually working here,

1065
00:45:35,151 --> 00:45:37,312
well, I just had
to see it for myself.

1066
00:45:37,354 --> 00:45:40,152
It's kind of nice
having that kind of free time.

1067
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,658
Just like it's
kind of comforting to know

1068
00:45:42,692 --> 00:45:45,855
that some things never change.

1069
00:45:48,565 --> 00:45:52,467
Take care, clerks.

I got to get out of here

Oh, yeah.

This will make me feel better.

DANTE: Here's what I
don't understand about you.

1105
00:47:53,656 --> 00:47:56,625
You have a license, you
can drive a grown-up car.

1106
00:47:56,659 --> 00:47:58,092
But when you ride the go-carts,

1107
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:00,358
you somehow feel
better about yourself.

1108
00:48:00,397 --> 00:48:02,422
Look, it just centers me,
all right?

1109
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:04,990
Kind of the way jerking off
at work centers you.

1110
00:48:05,034 --> 00:48:07,264
I only did it that one time.

1111
00:48:07,303 --> 00:48:08,634
And it wasn't to center me.

1112
00:48:08,671 --> 00:48:10,298
Yeah, it was to come.

1113
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,808
Well, I don't know about you,
but coming centers me.

1114
00:48:12,842 --> 00:48:14,309
Then why did we
have to leave work,

1115
00:48:14,344 --> 00:48:16,209
so we can ride the go-carts
to clear your head?

1116
00:48:16,246 --> 00:48:18,441
Well, I don't want to jerk off

all sex nuts and retard strong?

1119

Suddenly, I'm fighting him off

1120
00:48:24,187 --> 00:48:26,212
as he tries to jam
my dick in his mouth.

1121

Oh, fuck him.

He's an asshole.
He always was.

I'm sorry I let him bug me
even for a second.

1127
00:48:39,469 --> 00:48:41,664
At least I got a go-cart trip
out of it.

I don't know.

1130
00:48:46,843 --> 00:48:49,471
They just remind me
of a better time in my life.

1131
00:48:49,546 --> 00:48:51,480
Like when?

1132
00:48:51,581 --> 00:48:54,675
Like when we were young and the
world was still in front of us.

the world kind of left us behind
a long time ago.

you can do something about that.

Oh, I don't know...
since forever!

1250
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:29,154
- Why?
- Because "porch monkey"

1251
00:52:29,198 --> 00:52:31,029
is a racial slur
against black people.

1252

Shut up, Elias!

I didn't just call
Dante a nigger.

1257

I just said that "nigger"
is a racial slur.

00:53:05,702 --> 00:53:08,899
Since when did "porch monkey"
suddenly become a racial slur?

1273
00:53:08,938 --> 00:53:11,429
When ignorant racists started
saying it 100 years ago.

1274
00:53:11,474 --> 00:53:12,668
Oh, bullshit.

1275
00:53:12,709 --> 00:53:15,200
My grandmother used to call me
a porch monkey all the time

1276
00:53:15,244 --> 00:53:17,212
when I was a kid,
because I'd sit on the porch

1277
00:53:17,246 --> 00:53:18,304
and stare at my neighbors.

1278
00:53:18,347 --> 00:53:19,314
DANTE:
Despite the fact

1279
00:53:19,348 --> 00:53:21,043
that your grandmother
might have used it

1280
00:53:21,084 --> 00:53:22,483
as a term
of endearment for you,

1281
00:53:22,518 --> 00:53:24,042
it's still a racial slur.

1282
00:53:24,087 --> 00:53:26,487
It'd be like your grandmother
calling you a little kike.

1283
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:27,488
Oh, it is not.

1284
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:28,716
Plus, my grandmother had

1285
00:53:28,758 --> 00:53:31,488
nothing but the utmost respect
for the Jewish community.

1286
00:53:31,527 --> 00:53:33,222
When I was a kid,
she told me to always treat

1287
00:53:33,262 --> 00:53:36,197
the Jewish kids well, or they'd
put the sheeny curse on me.

1288
00:53:36,232 --> 00:53:37,893
What the fuck, man?!

1289
00:53:37,934 --> 00:53:38,696
What?!

1290
00:53:38,735 --> 00:53:40,396
"Sheeny" is a racial slur, too!

1291
00:53:40,436 --> 00:53:41,460
Oh, it is not.

1292
00:53:41,504 --> 00:53:42,732
Yes, it is!

1293
00:53:42,772 --> 00:53:44,501
Well, she never called
any Jews sheeny.

1294
00:53:44,607 --> 00:53:46,336
She just used to say
"sheeny curse" a lot.

1295
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:47,342
<i>(chuckling):
It was cute.</i>

1296
00:53:47,376 --> 00:53:49,435
It wasn't cute! It was racist!

1297
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:50,503
I disagree, man.

1298
00:53:50,613 --> 00:53:51,739
She was just an old-timer.

1299
00:53:51,781 --> 00:53:53,510
That's the way people talked
back then.

1300
00:53:53,616 --> 00:53:56,414
Didn't mean they were racists.

1301
00:53:56,452 --> 00:53:59,512
But my grandmother did refer
to a broken beer bottle once

1302
00:53:59,622 --> 00:54:00,919
as a nigger knife.

1303
00:54:01,758 --> 00:54:03,919
You know, come to think of it,

1304
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,791
my grandmother was
kind of a racist.

1305
00:54:05,828 --> 00:54:07,022
You think?!

1306
00:54:07,063 --> 00:54:08,587
Well, I-I still don't think

1307
00:54:08,631 --> 00:54:10,929
"porch monkey" should be
considered a racial term.

1308
00:54:10,967 --> 00:54:13,197
I mean, I've always used it
to describe lazy people,

1309
00:54:13,236 --> 00:54:14,464
not lazy black people.

1310
00:54:14,504 --> 00:54:15,801
I think if we really tried,

1311
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:18,068
we could reclaim "porch monkey"
and save it.

1312
00:54:18,107 --> 00:54:19,369
DANTE:
It can't be saved, Randal.

1313
00:54:19,408 --> 00:54:21,035
The sole purpose
for its creation,

1314
00:54:21,077 --> 00:54:22,908
the only reason it exists
in the first place,

1315
00:54:22,945 --> 00:54:24,879
is to disparage an entire race.

1316
00:54:24,914 --> 00:54:26,211
And even if it could be saved,

1317
00:54:26,249 --> 00:54:28,342
you can't save it,
because you're not black!

1318
00:54:28,384 --> 00:54:29,874
Well, listen to you.

1319
00:54:29,919 --> 00:54:33,082
Telling me I can't do something
because of the color of my skin?

1320
00:54:33,122 --> 00:54:34,487
You're the racist.

Hey.

So, are you scared
about getting married at all?

1335
00:55:36,786 --> 00:55:37,775
Um...

1336
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,414
were we in the middle

I don't remember leaving?

1338

I was just thinking about it,
and I was thinking

1339
00:55:45,127 --> 00:55:47,595
that maybe you were waiting
for some friend

1340
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:48,619
to try and stop you

1341
00:55:48,664 --> 00:55:50,063
from going through
with the wedding

1342
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:52,795
by asking if you're even ready
to go and get married.

1343
00:55:52,835 --> 00:55:54,803
So I'm asking.

1344
00:55:54,837 --> 00:55:56,600
Are you scared
about getting married?

1345
00:55:56,639 --> 00:55:58,470
Well, kind of.

1346
00:55:58,507 --> 00:56:00,839
I mean, I'm not scared
of getting married, you know...

1347
00:56:00,877 --> 00:56:03,311
I- I always wanted
to get married one day...

1348
00:56:03,346 --> 00:56:05,780
but I am scared
of the wedding.

1349
00:56:05,815 --> 00:56:07,806
Why?

1350
00:56:09,518 --> 00:56:11,748
I don't know how to dance.

1351
00:56:13,456 --> 00:56:14,684
You're kidding.

1352
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:16,021
I wish I was.

1353
00:56:16,058 --> 00:56:18,117
You're about to tie
your life to someone,

1354
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,252
someone who doesn't
even really get you

1355
00:56:19,295 --> 00:56:20,353
as well as your friends do,

1356
00:56:20,396 --> 00:56:23,627
and what you're sweating
is dancing at your reception?

1357
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:25,793
Well, I-I figure
she'll eventually get me.

1358
00:56:25,835 --> 00:56:27,632
I mean, you're married
to someone long enough,

1359
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,103
they got to get you
eventually, right?

1360
00:56:29,138 --> 00:56:30,105
Are you kidding?

1361
00:56:30,139 --> 00:56:33,131
My parents have been married
for 35 years,

1362
00:56:33,175 --> 00:56:34,802
and they still don't get
each other.

1363
00:56:34,844 --> 00:56:38,974
Emma's pretty,
smart, happy, a good person...

1364
00:56:39,015 --> 00:56:41,483
and for some strange reason,
she loves me.

1365
00:56:41,517 --> 00:56:42,484
I mean, what am
I supposed to do,

1366
00:56:42,518 --> 00:56:43,644
pass up on that because I have

1367
00:56:43,686 --> 00:56:45,176
a few stupid doubts
and some jitters?

1368
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:48,122
Besides, dancing
at the reception's

1369
00:56:48,157 --> 00:56:49,146
the more imperative concern
at this point,

1370
00:56:49,191 --> 00:56:50,317
because I only get,

1371
00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:53,260
well, presumably, one chance
to dance at my wedding.

No. Anybody can slow dance,

times I've ever gonna meet

most of Emma's extended family,

1377

to show some flair

on the dance floor, you know?

1379

Like, make an impression
so that maybe they'll see

whatever it is
that Emma sees in me

1381

I'm some burger-peddling loser

01:19:56,911 --> 01:19:59,880
You can badmouth Quick Stop all
you want, but I miss that place.

1902
01:19:59,914 --> 01:20:01,040
I loved working there.

1903
01:20:01,082 --> 01:20:03,550
I look back on that period
as the best time in my life.

1904
01:20:04,585 --> 01:20:06,052
Now I know you're fuckin' nuts.

1905
01:20:06,087 --> 01:20:09,215
Why? Because I enjoyed
what I did?

1906
01:20:09,257 --> 01:20:10,781
I got to watch movies,

1907
01:20:10,825 --> 01:20:13,225
fuck with assholes,
and hang out with my best friend

1908
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:14,387
all day.

1909
01:20:14,429 --> 01:20:15,726
Can you think of a better way
to make a living?

1910
01:20:15,763 --> 01:20:17,731
Yeah, maybe it's not
what everyone does,

1911
01:20:17,765 --> 01:20:19,426
but it was pretty fucking good.

1912
01:20:19,467 --> 01:20:20,434
<i>(laughs)</i>

1913
01:20:20,468 --> 01:20:22,060
Man, that's you all over.

1914
01:20:22,103 --> 01:20:23,695
Scrape by with the bare minimum.

1915
01:20:23,738 --> 01:20:26,138
Well, I'm tired of that, Randal.

1916
01:20:26,174 --> 01:20:27,732
I'm not in high school anymore.

1917
01:20:27,775 --> 01:20:30,073
Shit, I'm not
even in my twenties anymore.

1918
01:20:30,111 --> 01:20:31,908
I don't want to sit around
and rag on customers

1919
01:20:31,946 --> 01:20:33,072
while eating free food.

1920
01:20:33,114 --> 01:20:34,274
That's what you want to do.

1921
01:20:34,315 --> 01:20:36,215
That's what you've
always wanted to do.

1922
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:38,411
Well, if that's all you want out
of life, man, then God bless,

1923
01:20:38,453 --> 01:20:41,286
but I refuse to let your shit
taint the rest of mine.

1924
01:20:41,322 --> 01:20:44,416
No. I'm gonna smooth
things over with Emma,

1925
01:20:44,459 --> 01:20:45,824
go to Florida

1926
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:48,920
and start
my Randal Graves-free existence.

1927
01:20:50,765 --> 01:20:55,099
And try to forget these last
33 years ever happened.

1928
01:21:01,075 --> 01:21:04,374
So that's the way you see all
this time we've spent together?

1929
01:21:06,714 --> 01:21:08,477
That's weird, man.

1930
01:21:08,583 --> 01:21:10,483
I thought you were
the only guy in the world

1931
01:21:10,585 --> 01:21:12,450
who got me and had my back...

1932
01:21:12,487 --> 01:21:15,479
the only person
who'd take a bullet for me,

1933
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:17,057
'cause I assumed
you felt about me

1934
01:21:17,091 --> 01:21:19,924
the same way I feel about you.

1935
01:21:19,961 --> 01:21:22,429
Then, all of a sudden, one day,
you're like, "I'm moving. Bye."

1936
01:21:22,463 --> 01:21:25,591
Do you know
what that's been like for me?

1937
01:21:26,834 --> 01:21:28,495
I'm looking at a future
that just sucks,

1938
01:21:28,603 --> 01:21:30,503
because you're
not gonna be in it anymore.

1939
01:21:30,605 --> 01:21:32,072
And you're not
even throwing me over

1940
01:21:32,106 --> 01:21:33,903
for a life
that means something to you.

1941
01:21:33,941 --> 01:21:35,909
It's just a stupid,
hollow existence

1942
01:21:35,943 --> 01:21:36,910
you think you should embrace

1943
01:21:36,944 --> 01:21:38,309
because you're getting old
or something,

1944
01:21:38,346 --> 01:21:43,409
because it's the kind of life
everyone else goes after.

1945
01:21:43,451 --> 01:21:46,079
You're a fucking drone, dude.

1946
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,087
DANTE:
Fine.

1947
01:21:47,121 --> 01:21:48,748
Then the next friend
whose life you ruin

1948
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:50,690
can be a totally free spirit.

1949
01:21:50,725 --> 01:21:51,817
How's that?

1950
01:21:51,859 --> 01:21:55,522
You think I want to start
making friends at my age?

1951
01:21:55,563 --> 01:21:57,531
Christ.

1952
01:21:57,565 --> 01:21:59,556
Who would want me
as their friend?

1953
01:22:00,735 --> 01:22:04,227
I hate everyone, and everything
seems stupid to me...

1954
01:22:06,941 --> 01:22:09,876
..but you were always
the counterbalance to that...

1955
01:22:09,911 --> 01:22:14,211
the guy who was the yin
to my yang.

1956
01:22:14,248 --> 01:22:17,740
But now what the fuck am I gonna
do for the rest of my life?

1957
01:22:20,254 --> 01:22:22,017
I mean, shit, I really wish

1958
01:22:22,056 --> 01:22:23,489
you would've told me this
when I first met you

1959
01:22:23,558 --> 01:22:24,855
that one day,
you were gonna bail

1960
01:22:24,892 --> 01:22:26,189
on our friendship,

1961
01:22:26,227 --> 01:22:28,195
because if I had known
you were just gonna flake on me

1962
01:22:28,229 --> 01:22:31,858
a few decades later...

1963
01:22:31,899 --> 01:22:33,491
I wouldn't have even bothered
with your ass

1964
01:22:33,568 --> 01:22:35,798
in the first place.

1965
01:22:38,539 --> 01:22:39,699
Jesus, why don't you two

1966
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:41,901
just fuck and get it
over with already?

1967
01:22:43,845 --> 01:22:44,971
<i>(muttering):
Faggots.</i>

1968
01:22:45,012 --> 01:22:48,846
Why can't you ever say
something useful for a change?

1969
01:22:49,884 --> 01:22:51,146
Well, what the fuck
you waiting for?

1970
01:22:51,185 --> 01:22:53,517
That's your cue, man.

1971
01:23:04,198 --> 01:23:05,859
I got nothing.

1972
01:23:07,735 --> 01:23:08,997
Jesus fucking Christ,
what good are you,

1973
01:23:09,036 --> 01:23:10,162
you mute fuck?!

1974
01:23:10,204 --> 01:23:11,694
You know what?
That hurts.

1975
01:23:11,739 --> 01:23:14,264
Like, what do you ever add
to the fucking proceedings?

1976
01:23:14,308 --> 01:23:17,106
You got, like, one answer
for everything: "Pussy, man."

1977
01:23:17,144 --> 01:23:19,669
Oh, then, man, you must love
this fuckin' guy,

1978
01:23:19,714 --> 01:23:21,648
'cause he's the biggest pussy
I ever met.

1979
01:23:21,682 --> 01:23:23,172
The dude who lives his life

1980
01:23:23,217 --> 01:23:24,445
according
to everyone else's standards.

1981
01:23:24,485 --> 01:23:26,282
"I got to go to Florida

1982
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,686
and get married, 'cause that's
what's expected of me."

1983
01:23:28,723 --> 01:23:31,351
And the fuckin' insane part is,
he ain't even that crazy

1984
01:23:31,392 --> 01:23:33,656
about the chick he's marrying
or Florida,

1985
01:23:33,694 --> 01:23:34,854
never mind the fact
that he's got

1986
01:23:34,896 --> 01:23:35,863
a perfectly good chick

1987
01:23:35,897 --> 01:23:38,491
right here in Jersey
who he's nuts about,

1988
01:23:38,566 --> 01:23:41,694
and even Anne fuckin' Frank
could see she's nuts about him.

1989
01:23:41,736 --> 01:23:43,363
God knows why.

1990
01:23:43,404 --> 01:23:45,497
And she likes you
for who you are, man.

1991
01:23:45,573 --> 01:23:47,370
She ain't trying
to stuff you into a box

1992
01:23:47,408 --> 01:23:48,875
you'll never fit into.

1993
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:50,468
Not to mention the fact
that she's carrying

1994
01:23:50,511 --> 01:23:52,172
your hideous fucking CHUD
of a kid.

1995
01:23:53,481 --> 01:23:54,971
Jesus, if you had any sense
whatsoever,

1996
01:23:55,016 --> 01:23:56,313
you'd fuckin' stop trying

1997
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:57,977
to bray it up
with the rest of the sheep

1998
01:23:58,019 --> 01:24:00,817
and live your life
the way it makes sense for you,

1999
01:24:00,855 --> 01:24:02,220
you fuckin' ass!

2000
01:24:02,256 --> 01:24:04,224
Oh, yeah?
And what's that?

2001
01:24:04,258 --> 01:24:05,452
You obviously have
such a great handle

2002
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,822
on your life.

2003
01:24:06,861 --> 01:24:08,453
Tell me what you would do
if you were in my position...

2004
01:24:08,529 --> 01:24:10,793
or even what you'd do
in your own position?

2005
01:24:10,831 --> 01:24:13,322
Swing that judgmental pendulum
back the other way

2006
01:24:13,367 --> 01:24:15,130
and tell me how you'd solve
all your problems, asshole.

2007
01:24:15,169 --> 01:24:17,228
What the fuck would the
great Randal Graves do

2008
01:24:17,271 --> 01:24:18,670
if he were half the
master of his destiny

2009
01:24:18,706 --> 01:24:20,139
that I'm supposed to be?!

2010
01:24:20,174 --> 01:24:24,338
I'd buy the Quick Stop
and reopen it myself!

2011
01:24:26,247 --> 01:24:28,147
That's what I'd do.

2012
01:24:28,182 --> 01:24:30,776
That's what we should do.

2013
01:24:31,819 --> 01:24:33,286
Yeah, right.

2014
01:24:33,321 --> 01:24:35,983
Who-who are we, Lance Dowds?

2015
01:24:36,023 --> 01:24:37,786
Do you know
how much it would cost

2016
01:24:37,825 --> 01:24:38,792
to buy the Quick Stop?

2017
01:24:38,826 --> 01:24:40,487
Like, 50 grand, easy.

2018
01:24:40,561 --> 01:24:44,053
And neither one of us have
that type of money.

<i>(sighs)</i>

That's right.

2022
01:25:01,482 --> 01:25:03,950
You guys would be willing
to lend us some of that money

2023

so we can reopen the stores?

2024
01:25:08,823 --> 01:25:11,451
Sure, on two conditions.

2025
01:25:11,492 --> 01:25:13,619
One: We can hang out
in front of the store

2026
01:25:13,661 --> 01:25:15,424
anytime we want, and
you can't call the cops.

2027
01:25:16,664 --> 01:25:18,461
And two:

2028
01:25:18,532 --> 01:25:20,295
You have to blow each other,

2029
01:25:20,334 --> 01:25:21,323
and we get to watch.

2030
01:25:22,303 --> 01:25:24,828
Then you have
to go ass to mouth.

2031
01:25:28,309 --> 01:25:31,176
All right, just
the first condition.

2032

it kind of makes sense.

so much time in that store,

why college

You and me running
our own business
