1
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:05,730
I've seen him do it
a million times,

2
00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:08,607
but I can't tell you
how he does it, Henry.

3
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:10,590
The right-handed part.

4
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:13,627
I can tell you what he does
with his left hand.

5
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,609
He's a genius with it.

6
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:18,487
He might put that hand
on your elbow. . . .

7
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,013
or your bicep,
like he's doing now.

8
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:23,539
Basic move.
he's interested in you.

9
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:25,649
He's honored to meet you.

10
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:29,230
But if he gets any higher,
if he gets on your shoulder. . .

11
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:31,308
. .it's not as intimate.

12
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,921
He'll share a laugh with you,
a light secret.

13
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:38,726
And if he doesn't know you,
but wants to share emotional . . .

14
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:41,092
he'll lock you in a two-hander.

15
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:44,129
You'll see when he shakes
hands with you,Henry.

16
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:45,536
Governor.

17
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,181
Governor Stanton,
this is Henry Buton.

18
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:52,346
I met your grandfather
when I was a boy.

19
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,320
I hitchhiked to Washington
to hear him speak.

20
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:57,174
He was a great man.

21
00:01:57,206 --> 00:01:58,805
Thank you,sir.

22
00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:02,450
He's glad you' re coming on board,
I can see.

23
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:05,551
I'm not coming on board.
I'm just meeting him.

24
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:07,373
No, no. Take it easy.

25
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,795
Why is he here? He's a southern
governor nobody knows.

26
00:02:10,827 --> 00:02:13,608
You sound like a campaign
manager already.

27
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,134
-Howard, I'm not. . .
-I'm kidding.

28
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:20,067
If I said Stanton's here because
he cares about adult literacy. . .

29
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,273
You'd say I was full of it.

30
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:23,456
Yes.

31
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:26,110
Howard, Henry, this is
Marianne Walsh,

32
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:28,699
the librarian who runs
these classes.

33
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,842
Thank you, Governor walsh.

34
00:02:30,873 --> 00:02:33,048
Govemor stanton, I'm sorry.

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,478
I'm a little nervous. I'm sorry.

36
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,268
If you'll with me.

37
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,570
I'll take you up to the library.

38
00:02:40,337 --> 00:02:42,767
The walls are pretty bad,

39
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:45,645
but the library is much, um. . .

40
00:02:46,093 --> 00:02:47,531
Better. . .

41
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:48,874
Yes,yes.

42
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:51,336
We' re very proud of the library.

43
00:02:51,368 --> 00:02:54,022
When did you start
the reading program?

44
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:56,899
Three years ago.
We have very little money.

45
00:02:56,931 --> 00:03:00,448
It's the only reading program
like it in Harlem I know of.

46
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,262
There may be others,
but I don't uh. . . .

47
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:05,212
You okay?

48
00:03:05,244 --> 00:03:07,291
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

49
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:12,214
I'm Ruby. I'm a domestic.
I've been in this class 2 months.

50
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:14,804
Jack washington. I'm a handyman.

51
00:03:14,932 --> 00:03:16,435
Hello, Jack.

52
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:18,513
Tawana Carter, Waitress.

53
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:20,272
Good to meet you.

54
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:22,861
Anthony Ramirez,
freelance carpenter.

55
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:25,291
I wanted to say welcome aboard.

56
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:27,625
What? I'm not on board. I just. . .

57
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:30,343
You' re kidding, right?

58
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,558
Yeah.

59
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,659
Tell the governor a bit about
yourself, Dewayne.

60
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:37,377
I'm a short order chef.

61
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,693
And until I come here,
I couldn't read a lick.

62
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:43,548
Dewayne's dyslexic.

63
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:46,265
They just kept passing me up.

64
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,344
Third grade, fourth grade.

65
00:03:50,518 --> 00:03:53,843
I just sit in the back,
sticking to my own self.

66
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:57,488
It was like no one noteced.

67
00:03:57,648 --> 00:04:02,124
and I went all the way through
and graduated elementary school .

68
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,129
They sent me to Ben Franklin

69
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:07,016
that's generar studies.

70
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:10,309
They could have sent me
to the Bronx Zoo.

71
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,643
No one ever said:

72
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:16,064
Dewayne, you can't read.
What will you do with your ass?

73
00:04:16,544 --> 00:04:17,727
Excuse me.

74
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,499
Anyway, graduation come
and my mama come.

75
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:24,729
She took the day off
from the laundry where she worked.

76
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:26,807
So, we' re there. . . .

77
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:30,931
Dr. dalembretti calls out
the names on th diplomas. . .

78
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:33,521
and what each kid done.

79
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:35,919
Like "Sharonna Harris, honors."

80
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,180
Tyrone Kirby, Regents Diploma.

81
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:41,994
And then. . .

82
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:45,191
he come to my name.

83
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,016
he said, "Dewayne smith. . .

84
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:56,158
receive a certificate. . .

85
00:04:58,204 --> 00:04:59,867
of attendance.

86
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:04,151
You could hear people buzzing.

87
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:06,293
A couple of folks laughed.

88
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:08,851
And I had to go up there
and get it.

89
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:11,185
I had to stand up there. . . .

90
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:12,848
just dying. . .

91
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:16,717
trying not to look at anyone.

92
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,768
trying not to look too stupid.

93
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:26,149
Mama's in front.

94
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:29,122
She has her hat on and her purse
in her lap. . . .

95
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:34,110
tears coming down from behind
her glasses. . .

96
00:05:35,005 --> 00:05:38,170
Iike someone . .Iike someone died.

97
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,837
I want to thank you. . . .

98
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,555
for sharing that with us, Dawayne.

99
00:05:56,778 --> 00:06:00,072
I want to thank you all
for having real courage.

100
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:02,630
My uncle charlie was. . .

101
00:06:03,557 --> 00:06:06,115
a war hero, in World War ll.

102
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:09,568
He went to Jima,
where they raised the flag.

103
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:15,834
He took out four machine gun nests of Japanese
soldiers. . .who had pinned sown his buddies.

104
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,087
Did it with one grenade, his rifle,
bayonet, and bare hands.

105
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:21,270
Shit.

106
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:24,723
President Truman gave him
the Medal of Honor.

107
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:27,728
And when he came home,
there was a parade.

108
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:30,734
The town fathers came to
my parents house adn said:

109
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:33,483
Charlie, what are you going
to do now?

110
00:06:33,515 --> 00:06:35,721
Charlie said he didn't know.

111
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:38,535
The mayor said,
Maybe you'd like a scholarship.

112
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,468
The banker said maybe Charlie
didn't want to go back to school .

113
00:06:42,564 --> 00:06:45,601
Maybe he'd like a management
job with the bank.

114
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,894
and the owner said,
Don't be cooped up in a school .

115
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,251
Come manage my crew.

116
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:55,832
And you know what?
Charlie turned them all down.

117
00:06:56,568 --> 00:06:58,198
What did he do?

118
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,541
Nothing.

119
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:02,515
He just laid on the couch
and smoked Luckies.

120
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,593
Couldn't git him off it.

121
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,406
Was he messed up in the head
from the war?

122
00:07:07,438 --> 00:07:08,526
No.

123
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:11,051
It was just that he couldn't read.

124
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,504
He couldn't read and was too
embarrassed to tell anyone.

125
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:17,638
He had the courage to win the
Medal of Honor. . .

126
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,315
. .but didn't have the courage to
do what you' re doing here.

127
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:24,640
He didn't have the courage to get
the help he needed.

128
00:07:24,672 --> 00:07:28,317
So, know that I appreciate what
you' re doing and I honor it.

129
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:31,738
When people say,
Why spend effort on adult literacy?

130
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:34,136
I say to them. . .

131
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:37,173
I say, Because. . .

132
00:07:38,452 --> 00:07:40,818
It gives me a chance
to see courage.

133
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,399
I want to thank you.

134
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:48,460
I want to thank you for allowing me
to visit here today.

135
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:02,432
Let's get him out of here.

136
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:04,862
He likes it.

137
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:08,347
Governor Stanton,
thank you for coming today.

138
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:10,968
I will be damned.

139
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:24,333
You' re going to work for him.

140
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:25,868
No, I'm not.

141
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,458
I'm just going to meet him and talk.

142
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,928
About what?

143
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,486
Well , about going to work for him.

144
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:34,852
How can you quit on Adam Larkin

145
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:37,506
and get in bed with some cracker. . .

146
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:40,256
Who's done piss for blacks
in his state?

147
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:42,781
I could say the same about Larkin.

148
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:46,171
But he will . He has to wait.
He's a black congressman.

149
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:48,057
I don't like Larkin.

150
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:50,839
I don't know what Stanton wants,
but. . .

151
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:52,054
I do.

152
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:55,666
He wants to use the grandson of
a civil rights leader. . . .

153
00:08:55,698 --> 00:08:58,256
a black man in politics
to get votes.

154
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,015
That's hilarious.

155
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:03,788
Yeah, put a black man on the team,
that'll roll in those votes.

156
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,761
That's why so many black men
run the country.

157
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:10,022
If politics upsets you,
work for the black Advocate.

158
00:09:10,054 --> 00:09:11,941
We' re never like it.

159
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:14,690
Hand me that tie.
Get your own damn tie.

160
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,545
No,no tie, no suit.

161
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:18,687
Just leather jacket cool .

162
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,765
I'll be back in 2 hours.

163
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:23,451
Then we can discuss
the Black Advocate.

164
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:25,018
Don't be mad.

165
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:27,895
Okay, but only for 2 hours.
Wait up for me.

166
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:33,394
Oh, my God. My boy.

167
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,016
Henry Burton,
I am mighty honored.

168
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:39,725
I'm Arlen Sporken, the governor's
media consultant.

169
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,210
Nonfat caffeine?

170
00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:45,064
Thank you,don't it.

171
00:09:45,096 --> 00:09:47,494
I am delighted you' re on board.

172
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:50,884
-Honey, get me a sandwich.
-only if you pinch my cheek.

173
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:53,793
I'll get it. We' re going
to win this thing.

174
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,447
Absolutely.But the big question
is Ozio.

175
00:09:56,543 --> 00:09:58,941
You think he has
the ones to run?

176
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:04,184
It's cojones. I don't know Ozio
well enough to judge his cojones.

177
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,710
They' re big, but they' re glass.

178
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,564
Hey, there, Henry.

179
00:10:08,596 --> 00:10:10,771
Governor, it's nice to. . .

180
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:12,849
You remember Miss walsh.

181
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:15,183
-Sorry.
-You all right darling?

182
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,037
Thank you for this,

183
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:19,979
-The opportunity to discuss the. . .
-The program.

184
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:22,824
A great program,
don't you think. Henry?

185
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,062
Yes. It's an excellent program.

186
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,986
Now, tell the board what
we discussed.

187
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:31,329
Yes, I will .

188
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,846
I'll just see my way out.

189
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:36,765
Bye-bye.

190
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:39,578
She's on the board of
the teachers' union.

191
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,912
Ah, a teacher and a librarian.

192
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:43,703
Hi , darling.

193
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:47,571
Honey,

194
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:52,175
I'm sorry. We got stuck here.

195
00:10:52,271 --> 00:10:55,628
But great news--we made real
progress with the teaches.

196
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:59,369
Tonight? Are you sure?
Oh, I'm so sorry, honey.

197
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:03,526
Did we have a meeting with the guy
from the portsmouth Democratic Committee

198
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:06,180
Goddamn it, Charlie.

199
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:09,984
Are you uncle Charlie,
the Medal of honor winner?

200
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:13,501
Well , I'm Uncle Charlie.
And whatever else he says.

201
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,626
If you'll stop popping my eardrum,
I'll leave now.

202
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:20,056
Don't Susan, don't go.

203
00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:22,390
Susan, Just stay. . .

204
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:28,624
We better go. Where's the plane?

205
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:30,511
Teterboro.

206
00:11:30,543 --> 00:11:33,165
All the way out there?
Okay, Let's go.

207
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:35,147
Arien, see you in D.C.

208
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:37,129
Daisy, go with Howard.

209
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:39,687
Henry. . .Mitch, Charlie, Let's go.

210
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:42,245
Go?
But I came to talk to you about-

211
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:44,323
We'll talk on the plane.

212
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:46,881
But I teach classes in the morning.

213
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:49,407
Call in sick. The keds won't mind.

214
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,485
Can I make a phone call?

215
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:54,171
When we get there.
Now, Let's talk. . .

216
00:12:12,587 --> 00:12:14,026
Hi , honey.

217
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:19,557
This is Henry Burton.
My wife, Susan.

218
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:22,307
I met you 25 years ago
at your grandfater's.

219
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:25,760
You were running under
the sprinkler in wet underpants.

220
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:27,614
He was a great men.

221
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,053
Thank you.

222
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:31,643
Jack could also be
a great man. . . .

223
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:34,968
if he weren't such a thoughtless,
undisciplined shit.

224
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,982
Why is this a big deal?

225
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:39,764
Because first impressions count,
asshole.

226
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:41,746
This is New Hampshire.

227
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:45,423
These piople don't know you.
They don't even know your state.

228
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:48,748
They know Orlando Ozio, the governor
of a real state.

229
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,754
But they came to meet you and
you didn't show.

230
00:12:51,786 --> 00:12:55,782
I talked to the head of their
Democratic party about fly-fishing. . .

231
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:59,012
for an hour and 45 minutes.
Do you realize how. . .

232
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,569
indescribably boring
fly-fishing is?

233
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:04,607
Do you realize I've now committed
to doing. . .

234
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,717
this, this thing with him?

235
00:13:06,813 --> 00:13:10,010
I'm going fly-fishing
because of you, you asshole!

236
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:13,240
It's not funny. You can't do
this to me,Jack.

237
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:17,268
We've been at this a month and
you' re already fucking up.

238
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:22,032
The only shot we have here is
to be perfect.

239
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,494
Barely adequate won't swing it.

240
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,212
Jack, you can't blow off--

241
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:29,482
Primrose lane

242
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:33,350
Life's a holiday on Primrose Lane.

243
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,580
When I'm walking down Promise Lane

244
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:39,521
-With you
-You' re not funny.

245
00:13:41,024 --> 00:13:42,750
I have to find a phone.

246
00:13:42,846 --> 00:13:45,116
When we get to the apartment.

247
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,474
Honey, It was so great today.

248
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,264
the reading program.

249
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,758
You should have seen the piople.

250
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,220
And the teacher was inspirational .

251
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:59,760
Tell me how good was.
We can replicate a good curriculum.

252
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:03,884
You can't sell a program without
a good teacher.

253
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,666
Henry, was the teacher
that inspirational?

254
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,480
Well , she was. . . .

255
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:17,985
She was a pretty typical school
board bureaucrat, I thought.

256
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,297
We got it on a 6-month sublet.

257
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:28,855
Better than a hotel . Cheaper, too.

258
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:31,989
We can keep clothes and store stuff.
We have privacy.

259
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:36,529
I don't care about privacy.I'm here to
get know I can't do that in Private.

260
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,918
It's like the end of the campaign,
not the beginning.

261
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,467
Goddamn it, Charlie. No cable?

262
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:47,208
You can't run for President of
the United States without CNN!

263
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,126
Do you have any bags?

264
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:51,364
No, I didn't expect to come.

265
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:53,826
-You want something to eat?
-Yeah.

266
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:56,736
This is the worst damn place
I've ever seen!

267
00:14:56,768 --> 00:14:58,302
Hey! Darling.

268
00:14:58,334 --> 00:14:59,933
It's four A.M.

269
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,290
This is'nt how to introduce
yourself to the neighbors.

270
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:05,528
I'll make you coffee, Henry.

271
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,278
Well , I'm out of here
tomorrow morning.

272
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,420
I know we got to go cheap,

273
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,010
but not this cheap. Not loser cheap.

274
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:22,474
So, why did you quit Larkin?

275
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,881
Why?. . .

276
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:27,334
Why did you stop working for Larkin?
Careful , it's hot.

277
00:15:27,366 --> 00:15:28,772
Thank you.

278
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,595
I just, Um. . . .

279
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:34,144
I know-you can't talk about
your old boss to your new one.

280
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,446
I don't have a new boss yet.

281
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:42,489
Larkin's very different from Jack.
Very cool .

282
00:15:43,704 --> 00:15:46,645
Never blinks. A pro.

283
00:15:49,523 --> 00:15:52,240
Wouldn't swallow tea without
testing it.

284
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:58,699
That's the real thing experience
teaches you.

285
00:15:59,946 --> 00:16:01,832
How not to get bumed.

286
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:03,974
Do people ever learn that?

287
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,852
Do people ever learn that?
Not best people.

288
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:25,492
Adam taught me a lot. . . .

289
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:29,521
but it was all the same.
He never surprised me.

290
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:32,910
No one ever voted with us
because it was right.

291
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:35,308
They always asked for a lulu.

292
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,523
Lulu?

293
00:16:37,258 --> 00:16:40,072
It's New York for artificial
sweetener.

294
00:16:41,638 --> 00:16:44,420
Anyway, we'd win and then be
gutted. . . .

295
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:47,202
in the Senate. We'd accept
their version.

296
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:50,463
Then the White House would veto,
which was no surprise.

297
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,587
Then we'd celebrate our great
moral victory.

298
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:56,506
We'd forced a ceto.

299
00:16:57,689 --> 00:16:59,511
So you dropped out.

300
00:17:03,987 --> 00:17:05,842
So why are you here?

301
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,254
Tell me.

302
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:12,940
Tell me.

303
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,649
It's four in the morning.

304
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:19,238
Let's just tell the truth.

305
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:24,674
Okay, Well . . .

306
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:28,958
I wondered how it would be
to work with someone. . .

307
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:32,603
who actually cared about. . .

308
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:33,850
I mean. . .

309
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:37,815
It couldn't always have been
the way it is now.

310
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:41,140
It must have been different
in my grandfather's time.

311
00:17:41,172 --> 00:17:43,953
You were there. You had Kennedy.
I didn't.

312
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:47,502
I've never heard a president say
"destiny" and "sacrifice"

313
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,804
without thinking, "bullshit."

314
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:54,345
Okay, maybe it was bullshit
with Kennedy, too. but. . .

315
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,565
but people believed it.

316
00:17:59,236 --> 00:18:02,945
and I guess, that's what I want.

317
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,928
I want to believe it.

318
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:08,988
I want to be part of something
that's history.

319
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:15,319
I bet this is the longest answer
to a five word qusetion.

320
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:17,173
You've ever gotten.

321
00:18:17,205 --> 00:18:18,740
No, it isn't.

322
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:24,623
The longest was the one I got to. . .
Do you do much fly-fishing?

323
00:18:26,381 --> 00:18:28,204
It's a good answer, henry.

324
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:31,657
We are part of the history.

325
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,302
What else is there?

326
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:39,171
Hey, March.

327
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:42,080
Some guy about an automobile
insurance scam.

328
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:47,835
It's me. Don't hang up again.

329
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:50,809
-Fuck you.
-I'm in coffee shop in Hampshire.

330
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:53,462
I may not find another phone.
Listen.

331
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:57,043
Listen. I think guy could be
the real thing.

332
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:59,921
He's so incredible you could
work for him.

333
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:03,022
This son of a bitch actually
likes these people.

334
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:04,909
He's worth the risk.

335
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:08,745
Help me get him out of here.
We have a fund raiser in 20 minutes.

336
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:11,495
You bastard.
I waited for you all right.

337
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,605
I can explain about that.

338
00:19:14,884 --> 00:19:17,506
I got you some stuff
at the drugstore.

339
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:20,352
I can't go to Mammoth Falls
without clothes.

340
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,837
Daisy can pack some things
and bring them to you.

341
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,162
Why I can't pack the things?

342
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:29,911
Because you' re going to Mississippi .

343
00:19:29,943 --> 00:19:33,237
We have to set up campaign
headquarters before we go.

344
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:34,675
Thank you.

345
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,945
I thought you told us to hurry.

346
00:19:39,663 --> 00:19:42,221
Susan. . .Mrs. Stanton, I'm not sure.

347
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:44,011
I mean, I don't know.

348
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:47,560
I've never helped run
a presidenteal campaign before.

349
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,926
Well , neither have we.

350
00:19:50,502 --> 00:19:54,467
That's how history is made.
Henry-by the first-timers.

351
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,628
Stanton for President

352
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:03,131
Are you, uh. . .?

353
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:06,041
Is this. . .?

354
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,750
Where are the state party people?

355
00:20:09,782 --> 00:20:13,426
They' re tied up with
the congressional races. We' re it.

356
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:16,656
All right.

357
00:20:17,391 --> 00:20:22,539
Get the mailing lists of every donor
since the beginning of time.

358
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:27,047
I also need a complete database of
voting records on every candidate. . .

359
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,148
So we can set up a rapid response
operation.

360
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:32,099
How do we do that. Honey?

361
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,624
Don't you, uh. . . .

362
00:20:34,656 --> 00:20:37,726
Don't any of you have
any special skills.

363
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:40,156
I speak Hebrew.

364
00:20:43,513 --> 00:20:44,440
Great.

365
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:48,277
Voting Records

366
00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:51,314
Now call up the Harris vote.

367
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:53,936
No,no!

368
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:57,069
Why can't I learn this?

369
00:20:57,581 --> 00:21:01,162
This announcement is for
the candidate briefing on the 23rd.

370
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:03,592
Put it on five hundred leaflets.

371
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:05,222
And then what?

372
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:08,548
Hand them out.

373
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:16,988
Call only the Orthodox and
Conservative synagogues.

374
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:19,962
Speak only to the rabbis and
start off in Hebrew.

375
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:22,903
How's that?

376
00:21:22,935 --> 00:21:25,557
Great. We need to file that with. . .

377
00:21:26,516 --> 00:21:27,923
Excuse me.

378
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:34,158
Terry? Terry!

379
00:21:36,524 --> 00:21:39,913
Just hold out the leaflets
for people. Don't stalk them.

380
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:46,659
How y'all doing?

381
00:21:46,947 --> 00:21:48,801
We' re coming along.

382
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,103
We don't have much staff yet.

383
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:53,469
No, but what we have is choice.

384
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:57,018
Meet the most brilliant political
strategist in the party.

385
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,024
This is Richard Jemmons.
This is Henry Burton.

386
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:02,390
I sure admired your granddaddy.

387
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:03,637
Great.

388
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:07,122
-I'll pick you up for dinner.
-We can talk policy.

389
00:22:07,218 --> 00:22:09,999
Nice meeting you.
Say hi to Winona for me.

390
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:11,182
Who?

391
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:12,973
He means Jennifer.

392
00:22:13,005 --> 00:22:16,234
Every girl Richard falls for is
Winona Ryder to him.

393
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:18,025
Oh, that's uh. . .

394
00:22:18,057 --> 00:22:19,591
. .psychotic.

395
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:36,345
Does that good or what?

396
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:42,420
It smells so good.

397
00:22:42,452 --> 00:22:46,129
-We got it all set up. Where's
the governer? -He's down there.

398
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:47,887
He's got chicken.

399
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,093
Hey, Will , how's business?

400
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,331
Hey, Amalee, the Gov's here.

401
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:55,561
You got your mojo working tonight?

402
00:22:55,593 --> 00:22:57,639
Ain't no end to it, gov.

403
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:00,229
Hey, Lo!

404
00:23:02,786 --> 00:23:04,065
Gov's here.

405
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:06,208
How you doing?

406
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,733
Henry burton. Poeased to meet you.

407
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:10,588
How are you, honey?

408
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,137
I had to tell jackie you were
too busy working to baby-sit

409
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:16,055
and he was not happy.

410
00:23:17,174 --> 00:23:18,933
How are you, honey?

411
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:21,906
Not so good since my mama died.

412
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,793
I miss her like a pain.

413
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:27,438
You got to let that happen.
Your mama deserves it.

414
00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:30,763
Your pain will heal ,
but give your mama her due.

415
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:33,800
We got to miss our mamas.
Nobody loves us like them.

416
00:23:33,928 --> 00:23:36,326
Your mama still with you, Henry?

417
00:23:36,358 --> 00:23:39,555
NO. she's in Beverly Hills
with her second husband.

418
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:41,442
You' re a lucky man.

419
00:23:41,474 --> 00:23:42,880
Thank you.

420
00:23:42,912 --> 00:23:45,854
And the next time I see my mama,
she's blind.

421
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:48,540
A year later, she's got
one leg from diabetes.

422
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:51,929
She could have done anything.
Been anything.

423
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:53,623
God bless the mamas.

424
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:55,733
My mama worked her whole life.

425
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:58,483
My mama raised seven chikdren.

426
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:02,736
If he doesn't,
we focus on New Hampshire.//He does, we focus on the South.

427
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:05,165
He may wait until New Hampshire.

428
00:24:05,197 --> 00:24:07,883
Shouldn't we wait for
the Govemor for this?

429
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:12,967
He's in a mama-thon.
That'll go in all night.

430
00:24:13,063 --> 00:24:16,164
My mama worked her whole life
for her family. . .

431
00:24:16,196 --> 00:24:18,562
and never did anything
for herself!

432
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:22,878
and now they' re cutting her up!
Cutting pieces out of her!

433
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,660
Why is that happening to her?

434
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:29,017
I looked over jordan and
what did I see

435
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:31,479
Coming for to carry me home.

436
00:24:31,575 --> 00:24:34,325
You know what Richard's favorite
song is?

437
00:24:34,868 --> 00:24:39,025
It is the most American goddamn song
I can think of.

438
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:41,391
A southern governor wrote it.

439
00:24:41,423 --> 00:24:43,597
Know what I'm thinking ofz?

440
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:45,483
You are my sunshine.

441
00:24:45,515 --> 00:24:47,338
My only sunshine.

442
00:24:47,434 --> 00:24:51,078
You make me happy
when skies are gray.

443
00:24:51,174 --> 00:24:57,665
-I didn't know a governor wrote it.
-You'll never know. . .

444
00:24:57,761 --> 00:25:02,397
Please don't take my sunshine away.

445
00:25:02,493 --> 00:25:07,225
The other night,
dear as I lay sleeping.

446
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:12,340
I held you in my arms.

447
00:25:12,436 --> 00:25:14,674
When I awoke, dear.

448
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,328
I was mistaken.

449
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:22,252
and I hung my head and cried.

450
00:25:22,348 --> 00:25:24,682
You are my sunshine.

451
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:26,984
My only sunshine.

452
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,132
You make me happy when skies
are gray.

453
00:25:32,227 --> 00:25:37,279
You'll never know,
dear How much I love you. . .

454
00:25:37,343 --> 00:25:41,084
I have a list of all grassroots
organizations in New hampshire.

455
00:25:41,116 --> 00:25:43,194
Great. Put it on my desk.

456
00:25:43,354 --> 00:25:45,656
theae rabbis are putty
in my hands.

457
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,159
Fantastic.

458
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:52,562
I started out with 200,
I have one left. Know how I did it?

459
00:25:53,138 --> 00:25:54,672
Look it.

460
00:25:55,696 --> 00:25:57,326
I'm speechless.

461
00:25:57,358 --> 00:26:00,523
I think my grandfather would
endorse the Governor.

462
00:26:00,555 --> 00:26:02,538
Jesse. even if you ran.

463
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,968
Okay. You, too, my friend. Okay.

464
00:26:04,968 --> 00:26:07,270
Where the fuck are my clothes?

465
00:26:07,302 --> 00:26:08,517
Relax.

466
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:11,074
Daisy got sidetracked
to Washington.

467
00:26:11,106 --> 00:26:13,632
Does this guy have a chance
in hell?

468
00:26:13,664 --> 00:26:16,062
I haven't canvassed hell lately.

469
00:26:16,094 --> 00:26:20,091
But if we worked for guys who had
a chance, we wouldn't have Richard.

470
00:26:20,123 --> 00:26:22,169
Shit. He's bird-dogging.

471
00:26:22,201 --> 00:26:25,206
Why don't you go over to
my hotel room with me?

472
00:26:25,238 --> 00:26:27,540
You' re crushing my originals.

473
00:26:27,572 --> 00:26:28,787
Sorry.

474
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:31,345
You don't know
what you' re missing.

475
00:26:31,377 --> 00:26:33,487
Wait. Don't embarrass him.

476
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,045
I got cable. Want to walk
the snake?

477
00:26:36,077 --> 00:26:38,251
What, you don't believe me?

478
00:26:38,283 --> 00:26:40,553
Baby, I got a python in here.

479
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:48,802
Gee, I've never seen one
that old before.

480
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:58,554
Come on, bud. Park the Mustang
back in the garage.

481
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:03,862
Fuck you!

482
00:27:03,894 --> 00:27:06,068
You redneck son of a bitch!

483
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,297
Ever hear of Anita hill?
You' re lucky she's cool .

484
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:11,951
I wouldn't have done it
if she wasn't.

485
00:27:11,983 --> 00:27:15,755
And you know when a muffin is cool .
When to show her your cock.

486
00:27:15,787 --> 00:27:17,866
Where'd you go to school?

487
00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:21,543
Hotchkiss. You' re a tight-ass
prepie elitist from Hotchkiss.

488
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:22,949
Bullshit!

489
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:24,964
Bullshit it's bullshit!

490
00:27:24,996 --> 00:27:28,289
You called me a redneck,
which I'm proud to say I am.

491
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:29,983
You are a honky.

492
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,957
You just look black,
and it's your best part.

493
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:35,707
Lets you
intimidate the palefaces. . . .

494
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:38,808
and work that voodoo sexual shit
on white girls.

495
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,918
I'm blacker than you are.

496
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,380
I got slave in me, I can feel it.

497
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,011
You are crazy.

498
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:46,577
-Henry?
-What?

499
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:48,368
You got a visitor.

500
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,606
It's not a visitor. It's me.

501
00:27:50,638 --> 00:27:52,972
Where the fuck is my suit case?

502
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,379
I got it.

503
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:57,032
You can't let a lady carry
a suitcase.

504
00:27:57,064 --> 00:28:01,029
Herny I'm glad you got a wardrobe
because we' re haveing dinner. . .

505
00:28:01,061 --> 00:28:03,331
with a very important person.

506
00:28:03,363 --> 00:28:04,514
Who?

507
00:28:04,546 --> 00:28:06,368
Govemor Ozio's son.

508
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,926
What the fuck does Ozio's son want?

509
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:12,315
It could be that Ozio's
looking for someone to endorse.

510
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:13,562
Jesus.

511
00:28:13,594 --> 00:28:15,449
That'd be something.

512
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:16,888
You think?

513
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,317
This must be handled just right.

514
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:20,788
Just right.

515
00:28:22,003 --> 00:28:24,401
Mind eating pig with your hands?

516
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:26,415
Is there any other way?

517
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:28,174
Not in the South.

518
00:28:29,932 --> 00:28:32,522
Jack, the govemor's been
watching you.

519
00:28:32,618 --> 00:28:36,039
He was hoping when you next pass /our way, You stop in.

520
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:37,702
Get to know us.

521
00:28:37,734 --> 00:28:39,492
Absoultely, Jimmy,

522
00:28:39,524 --> 00:28:41,251
You got the book.

523
00:28:41,283 --> 00:28:44,576
When can we meet with. . .jimmy'd dad,governor Ozio?

524
00:28:44,608 --> 00:28:47,006
Do you mind us talking business?

525
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:49,020
No, no. How else will I learn?

526
00:28:49,116 --> 00:28:53,944
Next tuesday we' re in Albany,
on our way to New Hampshire.

527
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:55,671
How's Tuesday?

528
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,141
Let's look.

529
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:03,280
Tuesday. Let me just scroll down here.

530
00:29:04,815 --> 00:29:08,428
Tuesday's pretty full ,
but I can slot you in somewhere.

531
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:13,927
We land at four,

532
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:17,188
then do a drop-by
at the Teachers Union party. . . .

533
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,778
before their dinner at the Sheraton.

534
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,240
I'd skip that, but they'd notice.

535
00:29:22,272 --> 00:29:25,150
I'm the only candidate invited
to the party.

536
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:27,260
I know.The govemor tumed,

537
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:30,169
It down because he's speaking
at the dinner.

538
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:33,590
Good. You'll both be
at the Sheraton.

539
00:29:33,622 --> 00:29:37,203
You can meet after the party
and before the dinner.

540
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,464
Perfect.

541
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,182
I'll see him there.

542
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,621
Excellent.

543
00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:54,149
Fuck all , Henry.

544
00:29:54,277 --> 00:29:56,675
You don't know fuck about
briefing me!

545
00:29:56,803 --> 00:29:58,913
You make me look like an amateur.

546
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:03,325
Like a barefoot dipshit,
third-rate, southern fried. . . .

547
00:30:03,421 --> 00:30:05,243
piece of shit alderman!

548
00:30:05,691 --> 00:30:08,920
You didn't know Ozio was speaking
at the dinner. . .

549
00:30:08,952 --> 00:30:11,766
to keep me from shooting
my mouth off!

550
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,780
Hello, Richard.

551
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,082
If you'd like to make a call-

552
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,184
Shit! What kind of operation do
we got here?

553
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,500
How'd we get scheduled for a drop
when he's the main speaker?

554
00:30:23,564 --> 00:30:24,907
Get me Howard!

555
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,784
You threw the phone out
the window.

556
00:30:27,816 --> 00:30:29,351
Stop the car.

557
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:31,589
Don't kill us, Just stop it.

558
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,955
I think it landed in the brush.

559
00:30:33,987 --> 00:30:36,417
It landed in the trees. I saw it.

560
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:39,422
I look like shit going to that
cocktail party.

561
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:41,980
I'm Ozio's warm-up,
and he knows it.

562
00:30:42,012 --> 00:30:43,963
But we didn't know it.

563
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:46,520
I told you, it landed in the trees.

564
00:30:46,552 --> 00:30:49,973
Jimmy probably told his dad
he's nothing to worry about.

565
00:30:50,005 --> 00:30:52,979
He would have even if
Henry hadn't screwed up.

566
00:30:53,011 --> 00:30:54,737
Here's the phone.

567
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,752
It landed in the trees.

568
00:30:56,784 --> 00:30:58,638
It was in the brush.

569
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:02,251
Well , you wouldn't have found it
if I hadn't thrown it out.

570
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,709
Hi .

571
00:31:10,756 --> 00:31:12,354
Sorry, he's not here.

572
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:15,584
Henry Burton. Can I take a message?

573
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:21,147
Oh, God. I see.

574
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,629
How reliable is Daisy?

575
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:30,323
Hundred percent.

576
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,465
Then we just got bad news.

577
00:31:32,497 --> 00:31:35,854
An interview in Manhattan magzine,
Ozio blasts you.

578
00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:38,156
His state's last in everything.

579
00:31:38,252 --> 00:31:40,299
He knows shit about education.

580
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:43,976
You were ritht about the meeting.

581
00:31:45,031 --> 00:31:46,342
This is bad.

582
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,196
Hit back, Jack.

583
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:50,914
Not too hard
or you lose the liberals.

584
00:31:50,946 --> 00:31:52,992
You'll lost them anyway.

585
00:31:53,024 --> 00:31:54,335
Richard?

586
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:57,596
Give him a poke. We'll look
better when he drops out

587
00:31:57,628 --> 00:32:00,793
When who drops out?
OZio's 24 points ahead of our.

588
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:03,927
Exactly. If he's willing to
acknowledge us. . . .

589
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:07,316
then he's the strpidest
fucking ltalian since nero. . .

590
00:32:07,348 --> 00:32:10,353
or he's not going to race.
He'll sit and snipe.

591
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:12,655
Desn't matter. I won't do it.

592
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:13,870
Jack?

593
00:32:13,902 --> 00:32:16,204
Susan, I'm not going negative.

594
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:18,570
Any jackass can bum down a bam.

595
00:32:18,602 --> 00:32:21,224
-It's self-defense.
-I'm not doing it!

596
00:32:30,496 --> 00:32:31,743
Shane!

597
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:35,963
Come back!

598
00:32:37,242 --> 00:32:39,768
Come back, Shane.

599
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,550
Run for president.

600
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:50,159
How you doing,Henry?

601
00:32:50,255 --> 00:32:51,982
Uh, fine.

602
00:32:52,078 --> 00:32:54,635
There was a bender
on the interstate.

603
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:57,865
I'm on my way to meet the family,
so cancel Howard.

604
00:32:57,897 --> 00:32:59,335
Yeah, okay.

605
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:01,765
And, um, Govemor, look. . .

606
00:33:01,861 --> 00:33:04,195
about the Teachers Union dinner. . . .

607
00:33:04,323 --> 00:33:06,977
I know how much I lay on you.

608
00:33:07,105 --> 00:33:10,526
I know how hard you work for me,
and I'm honored by it.

609
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:12,157
I'm honored.

610
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:14,267
But I should have thought-

611
00:33:14,363 --> 00:33:15,770
Forget it.

612
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:18,359
Now, get out of
that office and rest.

613
00:33:18,391 --> 00:33:20,342
Open a bottle of Chablis.

614
00:33:20,438 --> 00:33:23,091
What are you doing this weekend,
Henry?

615
00:33:23,123 --> 00:33:25,425
Setting up a list of meetings-

616
00:33:25,457 --> 00:33:28,527
Do you think it's possible to
get yourself laid?

617
00:33:29,198 --> 00:33:30,349
Sir?

618
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:31,884
I'm serious.

619
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:35,976
I don't want you too horny to
think straight when we need. . .

620
00:33:36,104 --> 00:33:38,438
What are you doing Tanksgiving?

621
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,987
-What?
-Your mama's in Beverly Hills. . .

622
00:33:42,115 --> 00:33:45,792
so if you' re free. . .comespend it
with Susan, Jackie and me.

623
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:48,574
It's not like being
with your mama. . . .

624
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:50,588
but we' re family, too.

625
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,922
Thank you. Yes, I'd like that.

626
00:33:52,954 --> 00:33:54,393
Good, good.

627
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:57,174
and, the reason
I won't take on Ozio. . .

628
00:33:57,206 --> 00:34:01,011
is so I don't give that bastard
the power to make me the bastard.

629
00:34:01,043 --> 00:34:03,313
All right? See you, Henry.

630
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:06,446
Right.

631
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:11,658
Dear Lord, thank you. We' re about to receive.

632
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,614
Okay, son. Here we go.

633
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,076
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

634
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:23,936
Who are all these people?

635
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:25,918
Most are from shelter.

636
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:29,243
-You' re kidding.
-They come every year. A good news.

637
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,217
The bad news is, he also invites
his friends.

638
00:34:32,249 --> 00:34:36,245
Piople he's been collecting so he can
take them aboard when he sails.

639
00:34:36,277 --> 00:34:38,355
Some of them really suck.

640
00:34:38,387 --> 00:34:39,890
Henry? Daisy?

641
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:42,927
she had the same problem.

642
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:44,174
Right.

643
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:47,723
Meet lucille Kaufman, an old friend
of mine from New York.

644
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:48,970
Hello!

645
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:51,400
I marched with your grandfather.

646
00:34:51,432 --> 00:34:52,967
Hi ! Lucille.

647
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:55,493
Lucille and I went to law school .

648
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:57,699
You' re Jack's coordinator?

649
00:34:57,731 --> 00:35:00,065
Do something about his clothes.

650
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:03,198
And the campaign posters.
And Arlen Sporken, too.

651
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,300
I'm swamped, or I'd join
the campaign full-time.

652
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:09,081
Henry, I want you to meet my son,
Jackie.

653
00:35:09,113 --> 00:35:10,520
Hi ! jack.

654
00:35:10,552 --> 00:35:13,334
This is our family doctor,
Dr. Beauregard.

655
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:14,581
Henry!

656
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,906
You and jack must find a way to
educate them Yankees.

657
00:35:17,938 --> 00:35:20,240
Maybe if they both wear capes.

658
00:35:20,272 --> 00:35:22,254
This is Randy Culligan.

659
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,068
I gave Randy his first job
as a law clerk.

660
00:35:54,259 --> 00:35:56,977
Folks, may I have your attention?

661
00:35:57,456 --> 00:35:59,151
Folks, y'all know me.

662
00:35:59,247 --> 00:36:01,836
I'm Jackie stanton's mama.

663
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:08,231
How about if we sing a chorus of. . .

664
00:36:08,327 --> 00:36:09,862
You Are My Aunshine.

665
00:36:09,957 --> 00:36:14,434
. . .in honor of the great governors
of the South?

666
00:36:14,753 --> 00:36:16,384
You are my sunshine.

667
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,326
My only sunshine.

668
00:36:19,421 --> 00:36:24,313
You make me happy when skies
are gray.

669
00:36:26,455 --> 00:36:27,319
Hi !

670
00:36:31,443 --> 00:36:33,585
You' re kidding. You' re kidding.

671
00:36:35,216 --> 00:36:37,102
Hey! hey! Wait, wait.

672
00:36:37,134 --> 00:36:39,149
Ozio just dropped out.

673
00:36:44,904 --> 00:36:46,790
That's fantastic! Yes!

674
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,836
Gentlemen,

675
00:36:48,868 --> 00:36:52,769
welcome to the first debate of the
Democratic Presidential Primary.

676
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:55,775
Remember to keep your responses
to one minute.

677
00:36:55,807 --> 00:36:58,013
God, I'm so nervous, I'm sick.

678
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:01,434
Health care.

679
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:04,343
What I want to say about
health care is. . .

680
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:07,732
. .While it's vital that
every American be covered. . .

681
00:37:07,764 --> 00:37:10,866
It's also vital that we conserve
as well as expend.

682
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,766
We' re peoviding a safety net
for folks on welfare. . .

683
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:17,324
Oh, shit.

684
00:37:17,356 --> 00:37:18,507
How?

685
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:20,138
Oh, man. . . .

686
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,896
What did you see?

687
00:37:21,928 --> 00:37:23,559
Nothing No one.

688
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:26,660
You' re missing one of
the assholes of our time.

689
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:29,762
I can't help feeling sad as
I listen to Senator Martin.

690
00:37:29,858 --> 00:37:32,767
I remember a time when being
a Democrat. . .

691
00:37:32,863 --> 00:37:36,732
. . .meant more than just giving
welfare recipients a safety net.

692
00:37:36,828 --> 00:37:39,385
It meant giving them a ladder. . . .

693
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:42,839
. . .giving them a way to climb back
to an equal height.

694
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:45,300
If we don't control spending. . .

695
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:49,329
and shore up the economy of
this country, it will go under.

696
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:53,166
-This is a new economic era.
-Who' re we shoring the economy up?

697
00:37:53,262 --> 00:37:55,724
Your bond-holding fat cats?

698
00:37:55,851 --> 00:37:57,962
No, not just bond holders.

699
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:00,775
Ordinary men and women
will benefit, too

700
00:38:00,807 --> 00:38:02,310
My God. Lie.

701
00:38:02,342 --> 00:38:04,228
Why is he doing this?

702
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,001
Because he just has to get on
the good side of Lawrence Harris.

703
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:10,111
A lower deficit means.

704
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:13,277
working families will have lower
mortgage rates.

705
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:15,355
Okay, not bad, but shut up.

706
00:38:15,866 --> 00:38:18,169
Now Govemor Nilson's idea
has merit.

707
00:38:18,264 --> 00:38:21,398
We must provide jobs for those
who need work.

708
00:38:21,494 --> 00:38:23,156
Jack, excuse me.

709
00:38:23,476 --> 00:38:26,322
What, if anything, are you against?

710
00:38:31,629 --> 00:38:34,922
I'm against doing nothing
while people are suffering.

711
00:38:35,498 --> 00:38:40,549
I'm against dismissing any idea hat
might help because it isn't my idea.

712
00:38:40,645 --> 00:38:43,651
Senator, you've met these people.

713
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:47,424
Are you saying we'd nothing to help
unless we come up with it?

714
00:38:47,456 --> 00:38:48,894
Nailed him!

715
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,365
He's toast!

716
00:38:50,365 --> 00:38:53,275
-What I meant was. .
-Kicking ass and taking names!

717
00:38:57,527 --> 00:38:58,966
How was it?

718
00:38:58,998 --> 00:39:01,108
You took it. It was yours.

719
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,081
Govemor-March Cunningham,
the Black Advocate.

720
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:07,183
Were you ever arrested
during the vietnam war?

721
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:08,302
No.

722
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:10,732
You weren't arrested in Chicago?

723
00:39:10,764 --> 00:39:14,057
No. I was accidentally detained,
then released.

724
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:16,199
The record was expunged.

725
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:18,181
How were you released?

726
00:39:18,213 --> 00:39:21,539
The realized it was a mistake.
It was a long time ago.

727
00:39:21,571 --> 00:39:23,393
Check your records.

728
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:25,407
Come on. We'll be late.

729
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:27,869
You guys go ahead. I'll meet you.

730
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:38,964
What are you doing here?

731
00:39:38,964 --> 00:39:42,321
Why is the Black advocate
interested in Stanton?

732
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,079
They' re not. I am.

733
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:47,628
I'm finding out who he is
because a friend works for him.

734
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,515
MECH, don't do this.

735
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:51,721
Aren't you interested, too?

736
00:39:51,753 --> 00:39:53,831
Know why he was released?

737
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:57,028
He called. .a senator
to get him out of jail . . .

738
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,458
ask Daley to expunge his record.

739
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,577
So?

740
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:03,327
He was already so manipulative
in the 60s

741
00:40:03,455 --> 00:40:05,885
that he got in be with Daley. . .

742
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:08,794
who busted the protestors
at the Convention.

743
00:40:08,826 --> 00:40:11,576
I don't care.
Stanton was never a radical .

744
00:40:11,704 --> 00:40:13,463
He's a politician.

745
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:17,139
He couldn't get elected with
a record, so he had it expunged.

746
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:20,497
You want to work for that?
A man wants to get elected?

747
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:23,694
No, I want to work for a man
who fights for right.

748
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:26,252
and watch a Republican get elected.

749
00:40:26,284 --> 00:40:28,490
Do you know the diffeerence?

750
00:40:28,522 --> 00:40:32,263
I know the difference between
a man who believes what I do. . .

751
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:34,916
and lies about it to get elected. . .

752
00:40:34,948 --> 00:40:38,178
and one who doesn't give a fuck.
I'll take the liar.

753
00:40:38,209 --> 00:40:40,320
How did he do this to you?

754
00:40:40,352 --> 00:40:42,622
Do what? what are you. . . .?

755
00:40:42,654 --> 00:40:45,275
Why are you making him
into the devil?

756
00:40:45,307 --> 00:40:48,057
Get to know him.
Spend a few day with us.

757
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:50,519
I miss you. We could be together.

758
00:40:51,446 --> 00:40:55,251
I think you'd fuck me
to get good press for Stanton.

759
00:41:06,058 --> 00:41:07,816
We' re in trouble.

760
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:10,918
What does she have?

761
00:41:13,124 --> 00:41:15,969
Why is the Black Advocate
covering Stanton?

762
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:19,103
They' re not. It's. . .she's. . .
It's personal .

763
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:24,154
Don't matter. We' re fucked.

764
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:28,183
If some little shitty paper. . . .

765
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:31,156
Like the Black Advocate can
dig this up. . .

766
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,979
They'll all come after us.

767
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:36,400
I mean, did you see any
other president there tonight?

768
00:41:36,432 --> 00:41:39,150
We' re it.
We' re the fucking ball game.

769
00:41:39,182 --> 00:41:41,516
Now every flea that ever nipped

770
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:43,978
This ass will want a piece of us.

771
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,663
It'll be the war thing,
the drug thing,

772
00:41:46,695 --> 00:41:49,189
the woman ting. That's the killer.

773
00:41:49,221 --> 00:41:51,395
You talk to him about that.

774
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:53,857
Me? No. You' re the strategy guy.

775
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:55,935
But you' re the boy man.

776
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,950
We could talk to Susan.

777
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,412
Are you out of your fucking mind?

778
00:42:00,444 --> 00:42:03,545
Mrs. Stanton, we need to know
who Jack's plugging

779
00:42:03,577 --> 00:42:05,847
so we can have spin control .

780
00:42:05,879 --> 00:42:07,765
Then let's just quit.

781
00:42:07,797 --> 00:42:10,515
If we won't act, let's work
for someone,

782
00:42:10,547 --> 00:42:13,201
We' re not too chicken-shit
to protect.

783
00:42:14,384 --> 00:42:16,366
Okay, set up a meeting.

784
00:42:16,398 --> 00:42:17,837
Him or her?

785
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,276
shit, her!

786
00:42:19,563 --> 00:42:22,057
Goddamn, this is going
to be rough.

787
00:42:22,281 --> 00:42:25,446
I have to be in Concord
in an hour to meet Jack.

788
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:27,844
What's the crisis.

789
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:36,669
It's campaign business.
It's private

790
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:42,456
-Oh, please.
-Susan is my good friend.

791
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:45,238
What's the crisis.

792
00:43:06,947 --> 00:43:09,729
You' re in the wooks,
taking a shit. . . .

793
00:43:09,729 --> 00:43:12,734
and a wild boar comes
charging at you.

794
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:16,091
Do you pull your britches up
and run?

795
00:43:17,786 --> 00:43:20,408
Or do you try to pull
your britches up

796
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,093
and grab the doves you
just shot. . . .

797
00:43:23,285 --> 00:43:26,259
and then try to run,
all at the same time?

798
00:43:27,825 --> 00:43:30,703
Or do you just forget
about the doves. . . .

799
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:33,037
pull your britches up and run,

800
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:36,170
cause you got no time to aim
and button your fly?

801
00:43:38,057 --> 00:43:40,007
And if you miss. . . .

802
00:43:43,652 --> 00:43:46,753
you don't want to die with
your dick hanging out.

803
00:43:46,785 --> 00:43:48,640
See what I'm saying?

804
00:43:48,672 --> 00:43:51,517
I think I speak for everyone
when I say no.

805
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:53,404
Well , I mean. . . .

806
00:43:54,107 --> 00:43:57,080
what if you' re not prepared
for the boar. . .

807
00:43:57,112 --> 00:44:00,438
get caught with your britches
down and lose the doves?

808
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,772
What Richard is saying is. . .

809
00:44:04,914 --> 00:44:07,312
if you get caught in the forest-

810
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,966
Forget the shit
in the woods metaphor.

811
00:44:09,997 --> 00:44:12,172
What are you talking about?

812
00:44:12,204 --> 00:44:13,387
Okay.

813
00:44:13,962 --> 00:44:16,040
Say this boar is part of-

814
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:17,959
I don't believe this.

815
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:20,868
Who do the boars represent?
The Republicans?

816
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,307
The press.

817
00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:23,746
The press?

818
00:44:23,778 --> 00:44:25,408
Yes.Don't they?

819
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,103
Yeah, the press.

820
00:44:27,135 --> 00:44:30,012
Now, you' re dealing with
these boars. . . .

821
00:44:30,076 --> 00:44:32,986
and suddenly they say thing
like "marijuana" . . .

822
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:36,055
"Chicago" Maybe a woman comes
forward-

823
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:38,166
That's not going to happen.

824
00:44:38,261 --> 00:44:39,636
Absolutely not.

825
00:44:39,732 --> 00:44:41,810
I don't think so, either.

826
00:44:41,906 --> 00:44:43,313
But. . . .

827
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:47,246
I just wnat to figure this out.

828
00:44:47,598 --> 00:44:49,580
If is did happen. . . .

829
00:44:49,644 --> 00:44:52,138
he won't get trapped like Hart,

830
00:44:52,266 --> 00:44:54,312
cause we know the rules.

831
00:44:54,344 --> 00:44:56,550
If some bimbo comes forward,

832
00:44:56,582 --> 00:44:59,523
-we just say, "Bullshit."
-Bullshit is right.

833
00:44:59,555 --> 00:45:01,761
What do you suggest we do?

834
00:45:01,857 --> 00:45:03,840
How do we deal with it?

835
00:45:03,872 --> 00:45:07,676
Be prepared, so when a story hits,
we can fight back with the truth.

836
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:10,778
What can they make?

837
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:14,870
That's the point, Lucille.
That's the whole fucking point.

838
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:19,091
We need to hire an operative
to do research.

839
00:45:19,187 --> 00:45:21,137
Investigate our lives.

840
00:45:21,169 --> 00:45:24,750
Investigate everything
anyone could make into an allegation.

841
00:45:24,878 --> 00:45:27,691
But we don't play that game.

842
00:45:27,787 --> 00:45:29,898
We play the people's game.

843
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:33,511
We say "the republicans and media
want to talk about trash."

844
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:35,653
We talk about your future.

845
00:45:35,685 --> 00:45:39,042
We don't shoot doves in this
campaign. We protect them.

846
00:45:39,074 --> 00:45:40,800
What do you mean?

847
00:45:44,765 --> 00:45:47,323
Don't the doves represent
the people?

848
00:45:47,355 --> 00:45:48,442
No.

849
00:45:48,474 --> 00:45:50,456
Then who are the doves?

850
00:45:50,488 --> 00:45:53,430
Forget the doves. Henry,
you agree with this?

851
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:54,868
Yes.

852
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,130
We'll do it. I'll tell Jack.

853
00:45:58,225 --> 00:46:00,080
I want Libby Holden.

854
00:46:00,112 --> 00:46:03,181
If we' re hiring someone
to dind the dirt. . . .

855
00:46:03,213 --> 00:46:06,283
we must have someone who knows us,
who we trust.

856
00:46:06,315 --> 00:46:08,425
Is she out of the hospital

857
00:46:08,457 --> 00:46:09,608
Yes.

858
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,270
And she's okay?

859
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:12,741
Who is she?

860
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:15,970
She was Jack's chief of staff.
She had a breakdown.

861
00:46:16,002 --> 00:46:19,455
She suddenly became incoherent
during a press conference.

862
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:23,164
-She's been in and out of sanatarums
for years. -She's ok now.

863
00:46:23,196 --> 00:46:25,946
You and Henry can fly back
and brief her.

864
00:46:25,978 --> 00:46:28,472
well , that's good
that she's stable.

865
00:46:28,951 --> 00:46:32,117
Because you' re putting
the campaign in her hands.

866
00:46:32,149 --> 00:46:33,683
Yes. I know.

867
00:46:35,634 --> 00:46:37,136
That's good.

868
00:46:42,156 --> 00:46:44,107
then are we the doves?

869
00:46:44,138 --> 00:46:46,441
Lucille, don't kell the doves!

870
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,533
I think we' re the ones taking
the shit in the woods.

871
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:55,968
Henry.

872
00:46:56,736 --> 00:46:59,581
I'm just thrilled, thrilled
Y'all came back.

873
00:46:59,965 --> 00:47:02,459
I have a million messages for you.

874
00:47:02,491 --> 00:47:05,688
He looks like a band leader.
I'm getting rid of it.

875
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,461
Henry, how you going?

876
00:47:09,557 --> 00:47:12,754
On behalf of jack Stanton,
thanks for your support.

877
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:15,408
Call them assistants,
not secretaries.

878
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,550
Jennifer, look who's back.

879
00:47:17,582 --> 00:47:18,797
Henry.

880
00:47:18,989 --> 00:47:20,012
Shalom.

881
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:23,913
You' re working on Friday,
wearing a yarmulke?

882
00:47:23,945 --> 00:47:26,279
Actually, I'm dressed for work.

883
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:27,749
Hi , Henry.

884
00:47:27,781 --> 00:47:30,307
I'm here.
who's going to talk to me?

885
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:31,842
Miss Holden.

886
00:47:31,874 --> 00:47:33,409
Henry burton.

887
00:47:34,624 --> 00:47:36,030
I'm Terry Hicks.

888
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:38,332
Jennifer.

889
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,411
Hi , Lib.

890
00:47:40,507 --> 00:47:42,393
Hi , shit-for-brains.

891
00:47:42,425 --> 00:47:44,951
You learned to
watch your mouth yet?

892
00:47:44,983 --> 00:47:47,956
I will not let you fuck up
this campsign, too!

893
00:47:48,692 --> 00:47:50,642
That was 20 years agw.

894
00:47:50,674 --> 00:47:53,328
Yes, I was thinner then.
I had a waist.

895
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,022
Peter Goldsmith.

896
00:47:55,054 --> 00:47:56,941
Ella Louise Harriman.

897
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:59,019
Where is this happening?

898
00:47:59,051 --> 00:48:00,905
The fucking meeting.

899
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,582
I'll need a safe house.

900
00:48:04,614 --> 00:48:07,364
I know the one. Little,
nice rose garden.

901
00:48:07,396 --> 00:48:09,922
Call becky Raymond,673-4982

902
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:13,183
Tell her it's for the Governor.
She'll understand.

903
00:48:13,215 --> 00:48:14,654
Now, staff.

904
00:48:15,357 --> 00:48:18,394
I want her. The one who looks
like Winona Ryder.

905
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,537
Gorgeous. Is she smart?

906
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:22,647
Oh, she's smart.

907
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:25,588
I want her right away. Start.

908
00:48:26,292 --> 00:48:30,480
A Black Advocate reporter dug up
the Governor's Chicago arrest.

909
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:32,398
We can't stop that.

910
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,956
Why bother?
It's not that important.

911
00:48:34,988 --> 00:48:37,994
But we' re concerned there
may be other things.

912
00:48:38,026 --> 00:48:39,912
Like Cashmere Mcleod.

913
00:48:39,944 --> 00:48:41,095
Who?

914
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:43,333
You don't know shit, do you?

915
00:48:43,365 --> 00:48:45,220
Susan's hairdresser?

916
00:48:45,252 --> 00:48:47,074
and Jack's porkpie.

917
00:48:47,106 --> 00:48:48,289
What?

918
00:48:48,321 --> 00:48:50,847
Oh, for Christ's sake,
act your age.

919
00:48:50,879 --> 00:48:53,724
Jack Stanton fucks around,
and has enemies.

920
00:48:53,756 --> 00:48:56,538
But what can Susan's hairdresser
do to us?

921
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,511
Sell her story to the Flash
for $150,000. . .

922
00:48:59,543 --> 00:49:02,837
.minus the 10% she's giving
to the slime sucking. . .

923
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:06,322
. .shitty night school attorney
who's agenting the deal .

924
00:49:06,354 --> 00:49:07,952
You know this?

925
00:49:07,984 --> 00:49:10,542
No, I imagined it
in the booby hatch!

926
00:49:10,574 --> 00:49:12,173
It's bullshit.

927
00:49:12,205 --> 00:49:14,379
In your dreams, sweetheart.

928
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:16,169
She can't hurt us.

929
00:49:16,201 --> 00:49:18,919
She's selling a story.
She has no proof.

930
00:49:18,951 --> 00:49:21,157
It's the tip of the iceberg.

931
00:49:21,189 --> 00:49:23,907
Jackie's done some pretty
stupid things.

932
00:49:23,939 --> 00:49:26,944
He's poked his pecker
in some sorry trash bins.

933
00:49:26,976 --> 00:49:29,278
stop them before they stop us.

934
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:31,484
Crush 'em and sweep 'em up.

935
00:49:31,516 --> 00:49:34,777
From now on, you can call me
the Dustbuster.

936
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:38,167
You know, honey child-
I'm stronger than dirt.

937
00:49:38,231 --> 00:49:39,829
I believe you.

938
00:49:40,437 --> 00:49:43,314
We could offer her $200,000
not to print it.

939
00:49:43,346 --> 00:49:47,247
Then kill her to make sure?The important
thing is he did nothing wrong.

940
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:50,572
-He should act pissed off.
-But not too pissed off.

941
00:49:50,604 --> 00:49:53,961
More like it's too bad, but we
don't take it seriously.

942
00:49:53,993 --> 00:49:58,469
It's not as frightening as things that happen
to real people, like losing a job.

943
00:49:58,501 --> 00:50:00,260
Where's the light?

944
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:01,794
I'm looking.

945
00:50:01,826 --> 00:50:04,800
Shit happens, but we' re calm
in a shit storm.

946
00:50:04,832 --> 00:50:07,550
Or maybe,
we expected this kind of crap.

947
00:50:07,582 --> 00:50:10,012
Right.
The usual media trash bash.

948
00:50:10,043 --> 00:50:11,930
But why did he do it?

949
00:50:11,962 --> 00:50:15,511
Did he think Cashmere would be
so honored she'd never tell?

950
00:50:15,543 --> 00:50:17,397
Maybe it isn't true.

951
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:19,092
Would it matter?

952
00:50:19,124 --> 00:50:21,330
It'd be better if it wasn't.

953
00:50:21,362 --> 00:50:23,920
Why Hitler was faithful
to Eva Braun.

954
00:50:23,952 --> 00:50:26,062
Does that make him better?

955
00:50:26,094 --> 00:50:28,652
Or Jefferson or Roosevelt
or Kennedy.

956
00:50:28,684 --> 00:50:31,241
or any of the guys
who fucked around?

957
00:50:31,273 --> 00:50:33,799
But we can't say that
in interviews.

958
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:35,590
No, of course not.

959
00:50:35,622 --> 00:50:39,107
Today, a potentially explosive
development. . .

960
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:43,807
for Governor Jack Stanton is his quest for
the Democratic presidential nomination.

961
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,388
A dresser has alleged an affair
with the married candidate.

962
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,649
The story, unconfirmed,
appeared today in the Flash.

963
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:54,646
Stanton's made statement regarding
the woman, Cashmere Mcleod. . . .

964
00:50:54,678 --> 00:50:58,099
but the accusation directly
follows the disclosure. . .

965
00:50:58,195 --> 00:51:01,584
that Governor Stanton was arrested
in 1968 in Chicago.

966
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,502
Fucking Eyewitness news.

967
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:06,124
Ted Koppel wants someone
for his show.

968
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:12,359
-60 Minutes.too. -Do we have to take this?
They' re treating this like real .

969
00:51:12,422 --> 00:51:14,245
We can't ignore it.

970
00:51:14,277 --> 00:51:17,378
They could write off Chicago
it was 30 years ago.

971
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:20,064
Or Cashmere-she was paid
for her story.

972
00:51:20,096 --> 00:51:22,814
But the two, right on top
of each other?

973
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:26,778
People will say Do we want a
radical who messes with hairdressers?

974
00:51:26,874 --> 00:51:29,464
He did not fuck Cashmere Mcleod.

975
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:32,629
If you can't handle that fact,
leave now.

976
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:37,713
Okay,

977
00:51:37,873 --> 00:51:39,951
Let's think this through.

978
00:51:40,942 --> 00:51:43,468
Who has thoughts about
"60 Minutes"?

979
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,761
I think do it.
You agree to these interviews.

980
00:51:46,857 --> 00:51:49,255
Show them we've nothing to hide.

981
00:51:49,287 --> 00:51:52,293
And soon, because
this will cut into the money.

982
00:51:52,868 --> 00:51:56,129
We should act like
we expected this. . .

983
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:05,945
Doughnuts.

984
00:52:55,887 --> 00:52:58,508
Henry. Sit down, have some coffee.

985
00:52:59,244 --> 00:53:01,770
You going to get
some sleep tonight?

986
00:53:01,801 --> 00:53:03,240
Absolutely.

987
00:53:03,272 --> 00:53:06,470
Don't you worry. I was just
talking to Danny, here.

988
00:53:06,502 --> 00:53:08,100
Danny Scanlon.

989
00:53:08,132 --> 00:53:10,530
this is my friend, Henry Burton.

990
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,216
Can I get you something?
Apple fritter?

991
00:53:13,248 --> 00:53:14,687
No, thanks.

992
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,596
Danny works here every night,
12-hour shifr,

993
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:19,227
$5.25 an hour.

994
00:53:19,259 --> 00:53:22,232
Like I was telling the Governor,
I don't mind.

995
00:53:22,264 --> 00:53:24,470
I'd mind if I couldn't work.

996
00:53:24,502 --> 00:53:26,101
Apple fritter?

997
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:27,572
Not for me.

998
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:30,673
What was the best college game
you saw all year?

999
00:53:30,705 --> 00:53:33,199
Utah State versus San Diego State.

1000
00:53:33,231 --> 00:53:37,803
That was a great game. I saw it.
Great ground game.

1001
00:53:39,306 --> 00:53:41,512
You need a good ground game.

1002
00:53:43,174 --> 00:53:44,773
Apple fritter?

1003
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:46,468
No, I just said-

1004
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,929
I'll have one, Dan. But just one.

1005
00:53:48,961 --> 00:53:51,168
I'll make some fresh coffee.

1006
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,502
If you want some, you call me.

1007
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:55,260
Thank you, Danny.

1008
00:53:58,457 --> 00:54:02,454
You look tired, Governor.
Maybe it's time to go home.

1009
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,724
They'll kill me with trash.

1010
00:54:04,756 --> 00:54:06,387
Don't let them.

1011
00:54:06,419 --> 00:54:09,648
It's my own damn fault.
I didn't keep it together.

1012
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:14,156
We can still win this thing.
We' re going to win it.

1013
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:18,856
And these problems are nothing
compared to what folks go throgh.

1014
00:54:18,952 --> 00:54:21,606
Losing their jobs,
losing their homes.

1015
00:54:21,702 --> 00:54:23,460
Keep that in mind.

1016
00:54:23,492 --> 00:54:25,378
Keep the folks in your mind.

1017
00:54:25,922 --> 00:54:27,904
It's about them, isn't?

1018
00:54:27,936 --> 00:54:30,462
It's about them.
It's about history.

1019
00:54:30,494 --> 00:54:32,988
That's truer for Susan than
for me.

1020
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,226
It's always been about them.

1021
00:54:35,258 --> 00:54:37,592
Like this fella, Danny Scanlon.

1022
00:54:37,624 --> 00:54:40,246
He's worked every day since
he was 14.

1023
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:43,475
Couldn't get insurance,
couldn't get his leg fixed.

1024
00:54:43,507 --> 00:54:46,481
Doesn't complain.
Doesn't do any one any harm.

1025
00:54:46,513 --> 00:54:48,271
Aching to do good.

1026
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:52,364
God, if you let a man like
that go down. . . .

1027
00:54:52,396 --> 00:54:56,008
you don't deserve to take up
space on the planet.

1028
00:54:56,104 --> 00:54:57,895
We won't let him go down.

1029
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,718
Bummer. Bummer.

1030
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,317
What? Libby?

1031
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,043
She's go tapes?

1032
00:55:21,139 --> 00:55:22,546
Who has tapes?

1033
00:55:22,642 --> 00:55:25,136
Cashmere, the hair slut,
you moron.

1034
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:27,374
She's playing them tomorrow.

1035
00:55:27,406 --> 00:55:29,708
I have no time for ineptitude!

1036
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,521
Now tell Jack and Susan
the cunt has tapes

1037
00:55:32,553 --> 00:55:34,855
and get back to Mammoth Falls.

1038
00:55:52,217 --> 00:55:54,103
Honey, I have to run.

1039
00:55:54,135 --> 00:55:55,862
I will . Hold on.

1040
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:59,347
The new member of the swimming
team wants to talk to you.

1041
00:55:59,379 --> 00:56:01,904
Hey, Jackie boy. That's great.
You made it.

1042
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,526
That's great. We' re proud of you.

1043
00:56:05,294 --> 00:56:08,619
No, that's just a bunch of
campaign garbage.

1044
00:56:08,747 --> 00:56:10,537
Govemor, this can't wait.

1045
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,470
We'll call you tonight.
I love you. Bye.

1046
00:56:14,821 --> 00:56:16,260
What is it?

1047
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:19,969
Libby says Cashmere Mcleod's tapes
of you and her talking. . .

1048
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,728
On the phone and. . . .

1049
00:56:21,824 --> 00:56:24,573
she's going to play them tomorrow.

1050
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:29,977
I'm sorry.

1051
00:56:30,009 --> 00:56:31,319
How bad?

1052
00:56:31,351 --> 00:56:32,886
I don't know.

1053
00:56:32,918 --> 00:56:35,444
Did you tell her--
Henry, excuse us.

1054
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,396
It's cold here, Sam.

1055
00:56:44,812 --> 00:56:47,977
But these are friendly people.
Reminds me of home.

1056
00:56:48,009 --> 00:56:51,015
I like here hair that way.
It softens her face.

1057
00:56:51,047 --> 00:56:53,445
Yes. It could be longer, though.

1058
00:56:53,477 --> 00:56:55,811
If you spent a day with us. . .

1059
00:56:55,843 --> 00:56:58,944
. .you'd see what folks care
about is the future.

1060
00:56:58,976 --> 00:57:00,639
He's gotten fat.

1061
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:03,100
He jogs, so how much does he eat?

1062
00:57:03,132 --> 00:57:05,019
And what does he eat?

1063
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:06,937
What's he govemor of?

1064
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:09,527
Let me see. . .It's not Georgia. . .

1065
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,381
. .not Florida. . .

1066
00:57:11,413 --> 00:57:15,826
Sam, I'm not going to dignify
that trash.

1067
00:57:15,922 --> 00:57:20,014
At a time when the American people
have a lot to be concemed about. . .

1068
00:57:20,046 --> 00:57:22,924
I saw a picture of the hairdresser.
Not bad.

1069
00:57:24,266 --> 00:57:26,441
I don't think this is fair.

1070
00:57:27,304 --> 00:57:30,757
People suffer and struggle and
go through all sorts of things.

1071
00:57:30,853 --> 00:57:33,379
What matters is, we' re still here.

1072
00:57:33,475 --> 00:57:38,239
If you want to draw a lesson from
that about Jack's character. . . .

1073
00:57:38,334 --> 00:57:40,445
. .here it. He will stick.

1074
00:57:40,477 --> 00:57:42,907
He will work through tough times.

1075
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:46,136
He will bust his butt for
the Americann people.

1076
00:57:46,232 --> 00:57:48,310
Bust his butt. The mouth on her.

1077
00:57:48,406 --> 00:57:50,676
He should take her in hand.

1078
00:57:50,772 --> 00:57:52,275
Yeah, right.

1079
00:57:52,307 --> 00:57:54,705
She's honest. They had problems.

1080
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:57,678
Maybe that's when he screwed
the hairdresser.

1081
00:58:04,808 --> 00:58:06,023
You watching?

1082
00:58:06,151 --> 00:58:07,749
It's going off now.

1083
00:58:07,877 --> 00:58:10,275
And we' re out. Thanks everyone.

1084
00:58:11,203 --> 00:58:12,481
It's over.

1085
00:58:13,025 --> 00:58:15,839
How'd it play?
Wasn't she fantastic?

1086
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:19,835
Yeah, great. But they'd like to
see her hair a little longer.

1087
00:58:32,081 --> 00:58:33,520
Hey, Henry!

1088
00:58:33,584 --> 00:58:35,246
Nice to see you!

1089
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:36,813
Are you fine?

1090
00:58:36,845 --> 00:58:38,923
How long are you in town?

1091
00:58:38,955 --> 00:58:41,129
-Not long.
-No time to talk.

1092
00:58:41,161 --> 00:58:44,742
We got to get to Sailor's and
watch Cashmere with an expert.

1093
00:58:44,774 --> 00:58:47,108
You take care of youself, dear.

1094
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:50,081
I'll be home for dinner.
We'll take my truck.

1095
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:59,354
So you met jack and Susan
working for McGovem?

1096
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:00,473
Right!

1097
00:59:01,048 --> 00:59:02,903
What were they like?

1098
00:59:03,446 --> 00:59:04,725
Glorious.

1099
00:59:05,013 --> 00:59:06,707
Golden. Golden.

1100
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,224
Did they have any aspirition. . .

1101
00:59:12,303 --> 00:59:14,445
Please, mister, please

1102
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:18,537
Don't play B17.

1103
00:59:18,633 --> 00:59:21,735
It was our song. It was her song.

1104
00:59:21,831 --> 00:59:23,845
Sing with me, Henry!

1105
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,266
Please, mister, please

1106
00:59:28,385 --> 00:59:31,071
If you know what I mean

1107
00:59:32,989 --> 00:59:37,050
play that song again

1108
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:41,973
Sailorman!

1109
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:46,130
Good to see you, Libby.
How was the boody hatch?

1110
00:59:46,546 --> 00:59:49,391
A better class of drungs
than the old days.

1111
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:51,150
Where's the beer?

1112
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:55,210
Welcome to the world of
electronics.

1113
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:57,256
Brewski .

1114
00:59:58,663 --> 01:00:00,294
Here she comes.

1115
01:00:01,221 --> 01:00:02,628
Recording.

1116
01:00:06,976 --> 01:00:10,078
I know just what she looked like
in high school .

1117
01:00:10,109 --> 01:00:12,955
I'm Sherman Presley,
Miss Mcleod's attomey.

1118
01:00:12,987 --> 01:00:15,321
I want to make one thing clear.

1119
01:00:15,353 --> 01:00:18,550
We'll take no questions
until the tapes are played.

1120
01:00:18,582 --> 01:00:20,980
This will not be an inquisition.

1121
01:00:21,012 --> 01:00:23,538
Yeah, right. We git the inquistion.

1122
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:26,927
The tapes were recorded
on Miss Mcleod's phone machine.

1123
01:00:26,959 --> 01:00:30,156
This portion was recorded just
before Thanksgiving.

1124
01:00:30,188 --> 01:00:32,395
Governor Jack Stanton. . . .

1125
01:00:32,427 --> 01:00:34,057
seduced me. . .

1126
01:00:34,537 --> 01:00:37,862
and I have tapes to prove it.

1127
01:00:40,516 --> 01:00:42,946
I'm on my way to meet the family.

1128
01:00:42,978 --> 01:00:45,088
but you said you loved me.

1129
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,061
You said no one could do
the things I did to you.

1130
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:50,076
I could come up there.

1131
01:00:50,107 --> 01:00:52,154
God, what a whiny bitch.

1132
01:00:52,186 --> 01:00:54,200
Remenber we met in Taxas.

1133
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,973
I get hot just thinking about it.

1134
01:00:58,069 --> 01:01:00,275
What you doing this weekend?

1135
01:01:00,307 --> 01:01:02,801
Nothing, now that you' re leaving.

1136
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:04,911
Open a bottle of chablis.

1137
01:01:04,943 --> 01:01:07,597
Do you think it's possible
to get laid?

1138
01:01:07,629 --> 01:01:11,082
I'd say it's entirely possiblie,
if you postpone that trip.

1139
01:01:11,178 --> 01:01:13,192
I'm too homy to think straight.

1140
01:01:13,576 --> 01:01:17,828
As you can see these tapes were
recorded on Miss Mcleod's phone machine.

1141
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,865
I'll record the rest of it.
Let's go to work.

1142
01:01:20,897 --> 01:01:23,743
I'll kill him, How could he
be so dumb?

1143
01:01:23,807 --> 01:01:26,237
There are some abrupt cutouts.

1144
01:01:26,812 --> 01:01:29,242
I'm on my way to meet the family.

1145
01:01:29,274 --> 01:01:31,544
An abrupt cutout right there.

1146
01:01:31,576 --> 01:01:33,910
What are you doing the weekend?

1147
01:01:33,942 --> 01:01:36,916
That's picked in mid-sentence,
or it could be.

1148
01:01:36,948 --> 01:01:39,026
Open a bottle of Chablis.

1149
01:01:39,058 --> 01:01:42,031
Do you think it's at all possible
to get laid?

1150
01:01:42,063 --> 01:01:46,028
That breakup in the middle could
be static or they used it to cover.

1151
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,659
Wait a second.

1152
01:01:47,691 --> 01:01:49,513
Wait a damn second.

1153
01:01:49,897 --> 01:01:51,559
Play that again.

1154
01:01:52,518 --> 01:01:55,492
Do you think it's at all
possible to get laid?

1155
01:01:58,561 --> 01:01:59,776
Again.

1156
01:01:59,808 --> 01:02:00,959
Why!

1157
01:02:00,991 --> 01:02:02,846
Just again, damn it.

1158
01:02:02,878 --> 01:02:05,851
Do you think it's at all
possible to get laid?

1159
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,025
Yourself.

1160
01:02:08,537 --> 01:02:10,487
Yourself.

1161
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:12,725
Henry, are you carcking up?

1162
01:02:12,821 --> 01:02:15,251
Two of us dwould be one too many.

1163
01:02:15,283 --> 01:02:17,233
Un-fucking-believable!

1164
01:02:17,265 --> 01:02:20,782
He said, Do you think it's at all
possible to get youself laid?

1165
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:24,491
He said he didn't want me to be
too horny to think straight.

1166
01:02:24,523 --> 01:02:28,328
It was just before thanksgiving.
Play it again from the top.

1167
01:02:28,456 --> 01:02:30,087
Just his lines.

1168
01:02:30,118 --> 01:02:31,301
Shit!

1169
01:02:31,493 --> 01:02:33,923
I'm on my way to meet the family.

1170
01:02:34,627 --> 01:02:37,952
There was an accident, a bender,
on the in interstate.

1171
01:02:37,984 --> 01:02:40,925
That's the family he was
going to meet. Next.

1172
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:43,163
What you doing this weekend?

1173
01:02:43,195 --> 01:02:45,242
An abrupt cutout, right?

1174
01:02:45,433 --> 01:02:48,503
He said, What are you doing
this weekedn, Henry?

1175
01:02:48,535 --> 01:02:50,357
He called me Henry.

1176
01:02:50,389 --> 01:02:53,587
I remember the whole call ,
it meant so much to me.

1177
01:02:53,619 --> 01:02:55,441
Christ, we got her!

1178
01:02:55,473 --> 01:02:58,063
You got her. We don't.
How do we prove it?

1179
01:03:00,045 --> 01:03:03,178
Oh, no,no, No.Libby,they-

1180
01:03:03,306 --> 01:03:05,448
They can't get away with this.

1181
01:03:05,832 --> 01:03:09,189
This cannot be a world that
lets them get away with it.

1182
01:03:09,221 --> 01:03:11,619
Imagine a black boy saying that.

1183
01:03:11,651 --> 01:03:14,145
What a privileged life you've had.

1184
01:03:14,177 --> 01:03:16,511
But never mind about the world.

1185
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:19,037
I won't let them get away with it.

1186
01:03:19,069 --> 01:03:21,851
I'll track down Ted Koppel and
Larry King.

1187
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:24,664
Can you nail their cellular
conversations?

1188
01:03:24,696 --> 01:03:26,870
I have to rent a van. Sure.

1189
01:03:26,902 --> 01:03:29,236
Do it. We'll pick the best one.

1190
01:03:29,268 --> 01:03:30,931
Let's go, Henry.

1191
01:03:30,963 --> 01:03:33,361
We have to change the world now.

1192
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:34,927
You aasshole!

1193
01:03:34,959 --> 01:03:37,389
Yes, it was off a cellular phone.

1194
01:03:37,421 --> 01:03:40,139
But don't pull that outraged
puppy shit.

1195
01:03:40,171 --> 01:03:43,848
You haven't become an innocent
just because the tape is phony.

1196
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,981
I wish we'd castrated you
when we had the chance.

1197
01:03:47,013 --> 01:03:49,347
Libby, You' re on a cell phone.

1198
01:03:49,379 --> 01:03:50,754
Oh, shit!

1199
01:03:50,786 --> 01:03:53,504
Yes, I'm goddamn sure
I know who did it.

1200
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,765
Yes, I'll get it done.

1201
01:03:57,244 --> 01:03:58,619
Okay, Bye.

1202
01:03:59,003 --> 01:04:00,985
You know who did it?

1203
01:04:01,113 --> 01:04:03,735
Yes. Oh, yes, indeedy.

1204
01:04:05,334 --> 01:04:08,467
A triumphant day, Huh, Randy?
Perhaps your best ever.

1205
01:04:09,042 --> 01:04:11,312
Is that Cashmere on the line?

1206
01:04:11,344 --> 01:04:12,432
No.

1207
01:04:12,464 --> 01:04:15,021
Then say good-bye
to Sherman Preslsy.

1208
01:04:15,053 --> 01:04:17,771
It's not Sherman Presley,
whoever he is.

1209
01:04:17,803 --> 01:04:20,361
You've branched out.
Electronics now.

1210
01:04:20,393 --> 01:04:22,119
What do you mean?

1211
01:04:22,151 --> 01:04:25,892
You've been recording your friend
Jack's private conversations.

1212
01:04:25,924 --> 01:04:27,778
why would I do that?

1213
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:30,017
I'm a big Stanton supporter.

1214
01:04:30,049 --> 01:04:31,871
I always have been.

1215
01:04:31,903 --> 01:04:35,452
I've been here 20 seconds and
you've exhausted my patience.

1216
01:04:35,484 --> 01:04:37,658
I want a signed confession.

1217
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:41,111
Libby, put that away before
you get yourself in trouble!

1218
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,349
Randy, you human turd. . . .

1219
01:04:43,381 --> 01:04:46,579
. .you admit you ambushed
Jack Stanton, or you die.

1220
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:48,209
You' re crazy!

1221
01:04:48,241 --> 01:04:50,863
Certi-fucking-fiably.
At last, a fact.

1222
01:04:50,895 --> 01:04:52,877
You'll go to jail , too

1223
01:04:52,909 --> 01:04:55,019
I know nothing about this.

1224
01:04:55,051 --> 01:04:57,321
He's shocked. he had no idea.

1225
01:04:57,353 --> 01:04:59,911
Now, are you going to write
this out?

1226
01:04:59,943 --> 01:05:02,117
I don't know what you mean!

1227
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:03,428
Enough.

1228
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:06,466
You know what? I'm going to
blow your nuts off.

1229
01:05:06,498 --> 01:05:09,951
Yes, I am a lesbian. I do not
mythologize the male organ.

1230
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:13,500
Now, you tiny scumbag,
I know you did it.

1231
01:05:13,596 --> 01:05:15,834
You' re on retainer to the Flash.

1232
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:18,200
And you, you stupid shit. . .

1233
01:05:18,232 --> 01:05:21,109
. .the crap Jack actually
did wasn't enough-

1234
01:05:21,141 --> 01:05:23,187
you had to embellish it.

1235
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:25,873
Mister, You' re about to
become missus.

1236
01:05:25,905 --> 01:05:27,440
Libby, don't.

1237
01:05:27,472 --> 01:05:30,125
You have a choice to make.
And quickly.

1238
01:05:30,157 --> 01:05:32,204
Just how Crazy is libby?

1239
01:05:32,236 --> 01:05:34,857
and you have to do it now. One. . . .

1240
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,296
two. . . .

1241
01:05:36,328 --> 01:05:38,374
This is going to be fun.

1242
01:05:38,406 --> 01:05:40,133
Okay, Okay, Okay!

1243
01:05:40,165 --> 01:05:43,106
Very good. Very wise.

1244
01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:47,167
Now. I want you to be eloquent
in this letter.

1245
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:50,300
Guilt-ridden about
your jealousy and greed.

1246
01:05:50,396 --> 01:05:52,730
You couldn't live with yourself

1247
01:05:52,762 --> 01:05:55,544
if you deprived America of
this great man.

1248
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:58,326
Tonight, an aide of
Governer Jack Stanton

1249
01:05:58,358 --> 01:06:00,628
is joining us to play a tape.

1250
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:03,633
I haven't heard the tape,
but my producer has.

1251
01:06:03,665 --> 01:06:07,310
We'd like to thank her for
letting us go on with such notice.

1252
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:08,781
Here we go.

1253
01:06:08,909 --> 01:06:11,179
I can be there in 14 minutes.

1254
01:06:11,306 --> 01:06:13,193
I could come up there.

1255
01:06:13,289 --> 01:06:16,070
No, I can't wait,
I have to have it now.

1256
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:19,939
I get hot just thinking about it

1257
01:06:20,067 --> 01:06:22,401
Look at King. Look at his face.

1258
01:06:23,936 --> 01:06:25,822
That sounded like me.

1259
01:06:25,854 --> 01:06:27,293
It was you,

1260
01:06:27,325 --> 01:06:30,490
asking the head waiter
at Cafe Des Artistes. . . .

1261
01:06:30,522 --> 01:06:34,039
. .to seat you right away
because you hadn't eaten all day

1262
01:06:34,071 --> 01:06:35,478
but how. .

1263
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:38,004
We recorded it off
your cell phone.

1264
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:40,114
I'd like to read a letter

1265
01:06:40,146 --> 01:06:43,119
from the man who did this
to Governor Stanton.

1266
01:06:43,151 --> 01:06:46,477
To whom it May Concerm:
I am an employee of the Flash.

1267
01:06:46,509 --> 01:06:50,825
I took innocent statements of Governor
Stanton's off his cellular phone. . .

1268
01:06:50,857 --> 01:06:53,415
edited them and paid
Cashmere Mecleod

1269
01:06:53,447 --> 01:06:55,749
to pretend she was talking to him.

1270
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,882
I did this for my own gain
and advancement

1271
01:06:58,978 --> 01:07:02,335
I confess it now because
I cannot live with the fear. . .

1272
01:07:02,431 --> 01:07:07,099
that I may deprive the American
people of a great man.

1273
01:07:08,698 --> 01:07:11,415
Signed, Randy culligan,
Attorney-at-law.

1274
01:07:11,447 --> 01:07:14,996
Now I think the media owes
Governor Stanton an apology. . .

1275
01:07:15,028 --> 01:07:17,874
for spreading
this unsubstantiated garbage.

1276
01:07:17,906 --> 01:07:19,632
Very good, girl .

1277
01:07:19,664 --> 01:07:22,990
It should be harder than
this to smear an innocent man

1278
01:07:23,245 --> 01:07:25,771
We'll be right back
with your phone calls.

1279
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:28,457
How did you get my cellular?

1280
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,047
Henry, well done.

1281
01:08:04,043 --> 01:08:07,752
I want to thank you all for
sticking with us through all this.

1282
01:08:08,199 --> 01:08:10,917
We haven't much time,
but with you help. . . .

1283
01:08:11,013 --> 01:08:15,553
and the grace of God,

1284
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:18,335
we'll get done what needs
to be done.

1285
01:08:28,054 --> 01:08:30,420
It's would be easy to get laughs. . .

1286
01:08:30,516 --> 01:08:33,362
by doing some cheap
blow-dry jokes. . .

1287
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:35,088
so I'll get started.

1288
01:08:36,047 --> 01:08:39,117
It all started innocently
for Govemor Stanton.

1289
01:08:39,213 --> 01:08:42,346
He walked in one day and
asked for a little trim.

1290
01:08:43,273 --> 01:08:45,032
And some longer bangs.

1291
01:08:47,462 --> 01:08:50,211
They just don't care about
the fine points.

1292
01:08:50,307 --> 01:08:52,737
NO, it would ruin the punch line.

1293
01:08:52,865 --> 01:08:55,743
Does anyone survive onw of
these feeding frenzies?

1294
01:08:55,871 --> 01:08:58,428
If they've been around
a while,Maybe.

1295
01:08:58,524 --> 01:09:03,128
But this the first thing
people hear about Stanton,

1296
01:09:03,224 --> 01:09:05,622
-so he's history.
-Fucking idiot!

1297
01:09:05,654 --> 01:09:07,189
Damn it.

1298
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:13,136
O'er the land. . .of the free

1299
01:09:13,552 --> 01:09:21,928
And the home. . . of the brave.

1300
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,867
Thank you, Phil .

1301

Democratic Party

1302

progreessive govemors. . .

1304

the best fly-fishers I've met.

1305
01:09:43,542 --> 01:09:46,100
Please welcome
Governor Jack stanton.

1306
01:09:56,171 --> 01:09:58,729
Thank you for that kind
introduction, Tommy.

1307
01:09:59,177 --> 01:10:01,351
And thank you for the fish.

1308
01:10:02,566 --> 01:10:05,731
He gave me a big, slab-sided,
white-bellied fella.

1309
01:10:05,763 --> 01:10:07,650
Looked a lot like me.

1310
01:10:08,097 --> 01:10:10,815
Put it on the grill ,
gave it some heat.

1311
01:10:10,847 --> 01:10:13,117
kind of like I'm getting now.

1312
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:15,579
Thank you for coming tonight.

1313
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:18,776
I know you work hard and have
little time to rest.

1314
01:10:18,808 --> 01:10:21,526
Some of us got more time than
we'd like.

1315
01:10:21,973 --> 01:10:23,828
Right, I understand.

1316
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:27,089
Since this factory closed,
how many of you have found work?

1317
01:10:27,217 --> 01:10:28,656
Raise your hands.

1318
01:10:29,656 --> 01:10:39,656
