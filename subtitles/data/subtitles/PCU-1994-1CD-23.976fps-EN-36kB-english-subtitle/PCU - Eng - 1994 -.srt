We'd need an all-campus party
to raise enough money.

No one's been able

Thompson, your inability
to control the students...

1210
01:12:29,838 --> 01:12:34,207
has convinced us that you are
an ineffective president.

What? What are you
talking about?

You're fired, Thompson.
Dismissed. Booted. Sacked.

Out of here.

B.D., go beat up the pre-frosh.

Kick his ass.

This is.
