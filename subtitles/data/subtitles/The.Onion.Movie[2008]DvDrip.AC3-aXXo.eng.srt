think Melissa Cherry's...</i>

152
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:11,298
<i>image and music are too sexy...</i>

153
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:14,368
setting an inappropriate
example for their children.

154
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:18,473
So, what do you say to
all the concerned parents out there?

155
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,850
Well, Kip, I honestly don't understand
what all the fuss is about.

156
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:25,389
My music isn't about sex.

157
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:29,393
<i>It's about being a girl
and having fun.</i>

158
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:33,830
But clearly the song, "Down on my Knees,"
Melissa, is about fellatio, isn't it?

159
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,333
Ew. It's about how...

160
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:38,801
like, when you have
a big crush on a boy...

161
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,398
<i>sometimes you get down on your knees
and, like, beg for their love.</i>

162
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:48,503
# Oh, I got so much love
I need to show it #

163
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:53,312
What about your first big hit,
"Take Me From Behind"?

164
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:57,253
"Take Me From Behind"
isn't sexual at all.

165
00:10:57,322 --> 00:11:00,382
It's about love sneaking up on you.

166
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,154
You know, like from the behind.

167
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:05,662
<i>You know, it could be a boyfriend's love
sneaking up on you...</i>

168
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,598
or a friend's or even Jesus Christ.

169
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:14,002
# But what I really want is for
you to take me from behind #

170
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:16,370
# Oh, yeah #

171
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:18,432
# Oh, yeah #

172
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,070
# Oh #

173
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:23,205
# Oh, oh #

174
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:27,547
#When you love me right up front
you know that I don't mind #

175
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:31,612
# But what I really want is for you
to take me from behind #

176
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:37,628
Let's talk about the song,
"Lollipop Love."

177
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:41,097
"Lollipop Love" is...

178
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,499
the kind of love
that is just really sweet...

179
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:49,006
and you just kind of want to lick it,
you know, and suck it.

180
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,470
# Lollipop
Hey, yeah #

181
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:55,706
# Lollipop #

182
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,680
# Love #

183
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:59,182
# Lollipop #

184
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,311
<i># Love
Baby, baby #</i>

185
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,913
# Lolly, lolly, lolly
lollipop #

186
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,427
<i># Oh-ho, lollipop love #</i>

187
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:11,724
Like a lollipop.

188
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:17,933
What about the song
"Shoot Your Love All Over Me"?

189
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:22,201
<i>That's about how, like,
when you're in love...</i>

190
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:24,264
you just wanna be covered in it.

191
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:28,608
# Shoot your love all over me #

192
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,582
# Oh, drown me in a milky sea #

193
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:36,087
<i># Love all over me #</i>

194
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:38,520
But clearly, the video
seems to tell a different story.

195
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,024
What kind is that?

196
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:44,619
<i>- The kind with a... cum shot.
- I'm a virgin.</i>

197
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:46,391
How would I know what a facial is?

198
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:49,661
<i>Sometimes I like dressing up
sexy in my videos...</i>

199
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:52,464
but that's just my way
of celebrating being a woman.

200
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:55,472
<i>You know, people are always
gonna try to tear you down...</i>

201
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,701
<i>but that's their problem, not mine.</i>

202
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:01,143
<i>Because I know
who Melissa Cherry is.</i>

203
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:05,342
<i>She's just a good, old-fashioned country girl
from Monroe, Tennessee.</i>

204
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,408
<i># Baby ##</i>

205
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:13,216
The pope condemned
three more glands today...

206
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,818
bringing the total number
of sinful hormone secretion ducts...

207
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:19,386
on the human body to 11.

208
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:22,327
In international news...

209
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,202
relations between Sloravia and Azmenistan
continued to deteriorate...

210
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:32,607
when Azmenistani... rebels... seized a-

<i>Hey, Norm.</i>

Hey, Norm. Okay.

213
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:56,395
- Oh, there goes Norm again.
- He looks pissed.

214
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,070
Onion tip line.
What do you got?

215
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:16,318
Hey, Norm. What's up?

216
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:18,378
Hey, Norman.

217
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:20,356
What the hell was that?

218
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,753
We'd, uh, been meaning
to talk to you about that.

219
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:29,163
Um, it's Globie.
It's the Global Tetrahedron penguin.

220
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:32,362
<i>Yeah, the folks at Global
Tetrahedron thought he'd be...</i>

221
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:36,203
you know, a fun, unobtrusive way
to plug the company during the news.

222
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:38,708
Plus, you gotta admit,
he is pretty fucking cute.

223
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,143
Hi, Norm.

224
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:45,512
Who's the best anchorman
in the whole world? You are!

225
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:49,178
Come on, Norman.
You've gotta get with the times, mate.

226
00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:51,984
These kind of tie-ins are
commonplace these days, Norman.

227
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:55,219
It's called synergy, Norm.

228

We cannot have a shameless ad

<i>It's a blatant compromise
of our journalistic ethics and integrity.</i>

You know, what you're saying, it's-

233

It's a steaming pile of shit, mate.

234

00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:48,346
I just bounced from this
mad, crazy, ill party, dude.

305
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,219
I was hangin' out with these niggas
over in Pleasant Oaks and shit.

306
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,123
You were hanging out
with real black people?

307
00:19:56,661 --> 00:20:00,757
No, but they was blastin'
some crazy, phat beats, son!

308
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,699
They was pourin' out some Cristal...

309
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:07,363
breakin' off some endo smoke.

310
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:10,202
You know what I'm sayin'?
Just wildin' out!

311
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,676
- Yeah.
- Yo, I'm gonna score me a bag of Doritos.

312
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:19,648
Y'all straight?
Yeah? All right.

313
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:22,845
<i>Code Two. Code Two.
Intersection of 12th and Grand.</i>

314
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,184
We have visual confirmation
on the suspect.

315
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,920
<i>- This is Unit One.
- Hit it.</i>

316
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:31,928
<i>All possible units, please respond.</i>

317
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:38,732
<i>And this booty that was like-</i>

318
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:45,674
Yo, what the fuck is this?

319
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:48,837
- What's going on, Officers?
- The yarn store down the road was just held up...

320
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:52,440
by a young black male
fitting your friend's description.

321
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,849
What?

322
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,547
What are you- What are you
talking about? It-It wasn't me.

323
00:20:57,622 --> 00:20:59,556
- No, it's not you?
- No.

324
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:03,287
Hey, Frank, you see any other young
black males here in Lake Shore Bluff?

325
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,921
- Don't see any.
- What?

326
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:09,763
- In the car, darky.
- But I'm- I'm not black.

327
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:11,927
<i>I'm white.
My whole family's white.</i>

328
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:14,767
My dad's Irish.
My mom's Norwegian.

329
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,775
<i>We go to the Fourth Avenue Lutheran Church
where I help with the bake sale every Sunday.</i>

330
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:20,936
Settle down back there, chocolate!

331
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,548
<i>Let's stand right over here.
Don't worry about anything.</i>

332
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:28,551
Nobody can see you.

333
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:31,747
Now, I just want you to point
to the perpetrator for me.

334
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,523
Him. That... Negro.

335
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:40,587
Okay, thanks.
We can go.

336
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:50,000
This is Dana Dobbs here
at Lake Shore Bluff...

337
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:55,637
where any second now we'll hear
the verdict in the Timothy Shanahan case.

338
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:58,807
<i>Will the defendant please rise?</i>

339
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,082
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
have you reached a verdict?</i>

340
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:08,023
Yes, we have, Your Honor.
We, the jury...

341
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:10,253
find the Negro... guilty.

342
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:14,264
<i>There you have it. The Negro is guilty.</i>

343
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:22,367
<i>- Welcome to
Focus on Film with Kenneth Garber.</i>

344
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,170
<i>Hello. We are now a good
way through the film...</i>

345
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:29,009
so we thought it would be a good time
to get some perspective on it.

346
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,049
And joining us to provide just that...

347
00:22:32,116 --> 00:22:35,085
<i>are Nicholas Van Essen
and Raymond Marcus.</i>

348
00:22:35,152 --> 00:22:39,452
<i>Offer us, if you will, your take on
how the film is doing thus far.</i>

349
00:22:39,523 --> 00:22:43,721
I'll have to say, Kenneth,
that I am very impressed.

350
00:22:43,794 --> 00:22:47,230
Sketch after sketch,
we're being treated to...

351
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:51,234
a brilliantly biting skewering
of contemporary social mores.

352
00:22:51,302 --> 00:22:53,361
Well, Raymond, what do you think?

353
00:22:53,437 --> 00:22:55,997
<i>- I must strenuously disagree.
- Ah.</i>

354
00:22:56,073 --> 00:23:01,067
This is nothing but vulgar, low-brow,
potty humor thinly disguised as satire.

355
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:05,479
<i>It saddens me that the Onion has stooped
to this lowest common denominator...</i>

356
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:07,517
pandering to the masses.

357
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:10,383
Well, now for a third opinion...

358
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:12,388
let's go straight to the source.

359
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:16,358
We have with us here
in the studio a very special guest.

360
00:23:16,427 --> 00:23:18,361
Welcome, Masses.

361
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:23,391
So, what do you think of the film?

362
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:25,765
It's pretty cool so far, I guess.

363
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:29,203
That Cockpuncher dude is awesome.
Bam! Right in the balls.

364
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:34,438
<i>But this part, with these film-expert assholes-</i>

365
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:38,881
<i>I mean, why do you even have these two
gaywads in the movie for anyways?</i>

366
00:23:38,949 --> 00:23:40,780
Fags!

367
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:44,150
Lose 'em and let's get on
with the movie, dude.

368
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:47,713
<i>Gentlemen, experience the majestic splendor...</i>

369
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:51,455
<i>of a cruise aboard the luxurious
Queen Nathan II.</i>

370
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:55,693
<i>On the Queen Nathan, there's so much
for today's gay man to enjoy-</i>

371
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:59,600
<i>shuffleboard, exquisite cuisine...</i>

372
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,695
<i>monster cocks.</i>

373
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:03,899
<i>Grab a pole and go deep-sea fishing.</i>

374
00:24:03,974 --> 00:24:07,068
<i>Work those muscles
in our shipboard gym.</i>

375
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:09,544
<i>Enjoy our world-class spa.</i>

376
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:12,639
<i>Or take a thrilling
Las Vegas-style revue.</i>

377
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:15,811
<i>Yes, whether you want
to scuba dive, get blown...</i>

378
00:24:15,886 --> 00:24:18,878
<i>or play blackjack
in our glamorous casino...</i>

379
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:20,947
<i>the Queen Nathan II's
got what you're looking for.</i>

380
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:24,893
<i>So climb aboard the Queen Nathan II.</i>

381
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:29,490
<i>And now it's time
for Little-Known Racial Stereotypes.</i>

382
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:32,764
<i>Yes, everyone knows that
Italians are all mobsters...</i>

383
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:35,101
<i>and Native Americans are all drunks.</i>

384
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:39,199
<i>But did you know
that blacks love taffy?</i>

385
00:24:39,276 --> 00:24:43,303
<i>It's also true that Eskimos
run all the locksmith shops...</i>

386
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,544
<i>the Irish have enormous nipples...</i>

387
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:50,713
<i>and Puerto Ricans can dangle
from steel beams for hours at a time.</i>

388
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:53,086
<i>Damn, that's unbelievable.</i>

389
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:55,489
- How does he do that?
- Oh, he's a Puerto Rican.

390
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,493
<i>- Also...
- Y'ello?</i>

391
00:24:57,561 --> 00:25:00,086
<i>did you know that the Dutch
enjoy speaking with telemarketers?</i>

392
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:04,430
Visa? With a special
credit card offer?

393
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:09,303
<i>Peruvians love to swoop in
and save the day at the last minute.</i>

394
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:12,240
<i>And they can shoot laser beams
out of their eyes.</i>

395
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:16,143
<i>And, of course,
all Arabs are terrorists.</i>

396
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:20,013
<i>Ah, stereotypes. Can you imagine
a world without them?</i>

397
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:32,054
Okay, that must be our final player.

398
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:39,135
- Hi, Julie!
- Hi.

399
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:41,467
- Welcome.
- Oh, your house is so lovely.

400
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,030
Oh, thank you!
Come on in.

401
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:47,043
- Everybody, this is Julie.
- Hi.

402
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:49,511
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Hi, Julie.

403
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,413
Have a seat. So, I understand this
is your first whodunit party?

404
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:54,542
Ah, you are gonna
have so much fun! Okay!

405
00:25:54,618 --> 00:25:58,554
With any luck, by the end of the night
we'll figure out which one of us did the dirty deed.

406
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:03,184
<i>Any one of us could be the rapist!</i>

407
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,663
- I'm sorry. Did you say "rapist?"
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.

408
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:12,293
Don't these things usually
revolve around, um, a murder?

409
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:15,236
<i>Yeah, Julie, see,
we do this every few months...</i>

410
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:19,606
and frankly, we were getting
a little bored with murder.

411
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:22,578
So I was like, " Isn't there some other
violent crime we can reenact?"

412
00:26:22,646 --> 00:26:26,013
And I'm in the store the other day...
and I find this.

413
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:31,585
How fantastic is that?

414
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:35,955
So, anyway, Julie,
since you are new, luckyJulie...

415
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:40,395
you get to be the victim.

416
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:42,591
<i>Okay?</i>

417
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:45,726
- Ooh.
- So, I want you to put this on. Hop up.

418
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:48,067
Okay, so here's what's gonna happen.

419
00:26:48,138 --> 00:26:52,165
The lights are gonna go out.
So, you lie down on the floor.

420
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:56,771
We're all gonna come running in, but you're
gonna be unconscious, so you stay down there.

421
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:59,975
Don't you think this is a little... sick?

422
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,918
Oh, sweetie, it's all in fun.
No one's actually raping anyone.

423
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:08,991
I mean, you wouldn't have a problem with
a murder-mystery game now, would you?

424
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:12,392
- I guess not.
- Yeah, so why would you object to a game...

425
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:16,399
revolving around a lesser crime
where no one even loses their life?

426
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:18,401
- Well, it's just different.
- Oh, "it's just, it's just"!

427
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:21,734
Come on, guys.
Let's play the game.

428
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:24,603
Get your cards. Okay?

429
00:27:27,077 --> 00:27:29,307
CD in here.
You got that on, sweetie?

430
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,644
Okay, get down on the floor.
Get down on the floor.

431
00:27:31,715 --> 00:27:33,842
Ready for a rapin'?

432
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:40,318
Oh, no, please don't rape me.

433
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:44,293
- Shut up, you bitch!
- No, no, please, Mr. Raper Man.

434
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:46,556
- Shut the fuck up!
- What are you doing?

435
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,564
Shut up, bitch!

436
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:51,123
- Oh, no!
- Shut up!

437
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,708
Wow.

438
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:02,974
" Oh, no. The sweet, innocent,
young daughter of Mayor Lewis has been raped.

439
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:06,608
Lock the door. No one is leaving
until we figure out who did it."

440
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,618
- Nice accent.
- Thanks, man.

441
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,655
<i>Who committed this rape? Hmm?</i>

442
00:28:11,722 --> 00:28:14,213
Was it... the creepy uncle?

443
00:28:16,226 --> 00:28:19,059
The handsome, young Ivy League
fraternity brother...

444
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:22,155
who's used to getting what
and who he wants?

445
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:26,861
Um, the prisoner
just released on parole? That's me.

446
00:28:26,937 --> 00:28:30,873
Or the vaguely hermaphroditic
night nurse...

447
00:28:30,941 --> 00:28:32,909
from the senior center
just down the block?

448
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:37,812
<i>Ooh, he's so creepy!
Okay, come on. Let's play! Let's play!</i>

449
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:40,714
"I was with my wife.

450
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:44,618
"Besides, that bitch has been
making up stories since she was four.

451
00:28:44,688 --> 00:28:47,350
You can't believe anything she says!"

452
00:28:47,424 --> 00:28:50,518
"I have 22 fraternity brothers
who will vouch that I was with them."

453
00:28:52,496 --> 00:28:56,023
Oh, I bet you do.
Okay, time to spin.

454
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,433
Whoa, Julie, I know this
is your first time...

455
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:02,563
- but you're not acting very raped.
- Okay.

456
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,041
Oh, no, no, Julie, you can't stand up.
You've just been raped.

457
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,943
The rapist shattered
your pelvis with a baseball bat.

458
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,949
Um, I'm leaving.

459
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,781
Wha-What?
Where are you going?

460
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:19,880
Ju- Come-Julie, wh-

461
00:29:21,191 --> 00:29:23,182
Now what?

462
00:29:25,362 --> 00:29:29,128
I guess you guys are just gonna have to rape me.

463
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:32,293
<i>Oh, no, please don't rape me.</i>

464
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:39,635
Taffy?
God! Fucking blacks!

465
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:47,080
The nation's anti-tobacco lobby
won another victory today...

466
00:29:47,151 --> 00:29:51,645
when Congress passed legislation
restricting smoking within U.S. borders...

467
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:54,088
<i>to a single room in Iowa.</i>

468
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:56,820
<i>- Traffic was backed up from
Nevada all the way to lowa...</i>

469
00:29:56,894 --> 00:29:59,294
<i>as smokers tried to get to the lounge.</i>

470
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:02,662
Move the car,
you old, fucking bitch!

471
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:05,634
<i>Smokers from across the country
are making the long journey...</i>

472
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:09,799
<i>to the 10-by-10 smoker's lounge
in Des Moines, Iowa.</i>

473
00:30:09,873 --> 00:30:13,741
I drove all the way from San Francisco
just to sneak a smoke in on my lunch break.

474
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:16,678
I'm supposed to be back
at work in 10 minutes.

475
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:20,342
It's a 37-hour drive.
It's fuckin' bullshit!

476
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:24,478
In legal news, a judge has declared
local aerobics instructor...

477
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:29,822
and accused murderer, Jennifer Porter,
too fit to stand trial.

478
00:30:29,893 --> 00:30:32,726
Judge Edward Conlin
said that the suspect...

479
00:30:32,796 --> 00:30:35,856
with her washboard abs
and powerful leg muscles...

480
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:38,527
is of too sound body...

481
00:30:38,602 --> 00:30:41,969
to be tried for the killing
of her ex-lover.

482
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:47,105
According to a new medical study...

483
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:50,510
depression hits losers hardest.

484
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:53,880
The study found that extreme,
debilitating depression...

485
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:57,284
most commonly afflicts
those who are total screw-ups...

486
00:30:57,354 --> 00:30:59,618
who can't do anything right.

487
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:08,030
Are you ready?

488
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:11,499
Oooh.

489
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:16,028
# Baby, when we kiss
my heart just skips a beat #

490
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:20,839
#And when you hold my hand
Oh, I can hardly speak #

491
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:26,008
# But there's one kind of lovin'
that we can't do face to face #

492
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:31,749
# So let me give you some affection
just below your waist #

493
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:34,950
- I like that.
- # Oh, yeah, I'm down on my knees for you #

494
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:39,018
# I'm beggin' please, please for you #

495
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:43,829
# Oh, got so much love
I need to show it #

496
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:47,428
# It's a big job
Don't wanna blow it #

497
00:31:47,504 --> 00:31:50,667
# Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah #

498
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:53,733
# Oh #

499
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,740
# Baby
Down on my knees #

500
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,749
# Beggin' please, please ##

501
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,615
From Global Tetrahedron Pictures,
Steven Seagal is-

502
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:07,055
<i>Hey, welcome to Volt Village. My name's Dirk.
What can I help you find today?</i>

503
00:32:07,124 --> 00:32:09,524
Hey, Dirk.
Um, my computer...

504
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:12,790
it's a few years old,
and I feel like I'm ready for a new one.

505
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:15,855
I got just the thing.

506
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:19,664
The Bates 4000.
Absolute cutting-edge.

507
00:32:19,736 --> 00:32:22,466
These babies came in on Tuesday.
They're packed, man.

508
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:24,837
Eighty "G's" of RAM.

509
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:27,900
We're talking
a quad-port 900 processor...

510
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:30,674
D.V.K. compatible memory card...

511
00:32:30,747 --> 00:32:32,681
dual-burning DVD drives...

512
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:35,912
plus a 16,000 C.T.C. combo-drive...

513
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:38,716
with a plus-four digital
upgrade card.

514
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:41,724
This will knock the shit
out of your ass.

515
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:47,090
Well, I'm just looking for your basic,
simple home computer.

516
00:32:47,164 --> 00:32:51,294
I know, your wife has you
by the purse strings. But you know what?

517
00:32:51,368 --> 00:32:53,996
This is the Bates 4000.
It doesn't get any better than this.

518
00:32:54,071 --> 00:32:56,665
It's not going anywhere.
This is the future.

519
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,504
Well, I have the Bates 1000
and that worked-

520
00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:01,942
<i>Oh, excuse me.
You have the Bates 1000.</i>

521
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:05,675
Oh, that's great!
Fuck, man, wow!

522
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:09,344
<i>Maybe you should talk to a homeless woman
outside 'cause maybe she'll be impressed.</i>

523
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,512
Those things are barbaric.

524
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:14,523
I mean, last time I checked,
they didn't even have a delete key on it.

525
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:19,426
I'm joking, of course. But look,
this is the future. You get my point?

526
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:22,659
- Yeah.
- Okay? Let's write you up.

527
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:26,294
- All right, let's do it.
- All right, my friend.

528
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:33,904
Wow, honey. Are you sure
we needed such a fancy one?

529
00:33:33,977 --> 00:33:36,741
You kidding? This thing's got
a quad-port 900 processor...

530
00:33:36,813 --> 00:33:39,714
and a 16,000
C.T.D. combo-drive with-

531
00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:43,844
Dude, you're not still using
the Bates 4000, are you?

532
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,048
That thing's ancient.

533
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:48,353
<i>- Really?
- Really.</i>

534
00:33:48,425 --> 00:33:53,829
You got to get you one of these:
the Bates 5000.

535
00:33:53,897 --> 00:33:55,990
Absolute cutting-edge.

536
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:59,558
<i>Wow, that is newer.
Thanks.</i>

537
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:03,570
The new Bates 5000.

538
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,167
Throw your 4000 away.
It's a piece of shit.

539
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:20,749
<i>This is Hard Drive Hal, your computer expert.</i>

540
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:24,282
<i>My guest today
is Bates C.E.O. Gil Bates.</i>

541
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:27,990
<i>Now, he's here to talk about perhaps
the most powerful machine ever built:</i>

542
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:31,694
<i>the Bates 6000,
and it's available in stores right now.</i>

543
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:37,671
Asshole!

544
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:47,082
Hey, I just dropped off
a shipment of the Bates 7000s.

545
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,778
Now, what do you want me
to do with the leftover 6000s?

546
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:54,085
6000s? Throw 'em in the fucking
garbage where they belong.

547
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,960
<i>That's right. Twice the memory
capacity of the 8000.</i>

548
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:04,091
Mr. Bates, you have a visitor.
- Hang on. Come in.

549
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:06,931
Hi.

550
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:11,600
Bates was 42.

551
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:15,406
In other news, after a six-month
stint at the Betty King Clinic...

552
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:18,471
actor Bryce Brand
finally returned home today.

553
00:35:18,548 --> 00:35:23,042
That's right, Norm. I'm here outside superstar
Bryce Brand's Hollywood Hills mansion...

554
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,080
where, at any moment, he's due to return
from his stay at the Betty King Clinic.

555
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:30,422
<i>Bryce!</i>

556
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:36,663
Bobby, baby!

557
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:39,293
- Bryce.
- Bobby, baby!

558
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:42,930
Bobby, baby!

559
00:35:43,006 --> 00:35:45,998
- I'm back!
- You look great.

560
00:35:46,076 --> 00:35:50,410
I cannot tell you how good I feel
now that I'm off the drugs...

561
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,573
and high on life.

562
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:54,776
<i>Hey, that's what they're saying.</i>

563
00:35:55,852 --> 00:36:01,518
<i>Oh, man, was I a mess.</i>

564
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:05,254
<i>But all that's changed now
that I'm clean and sober.</i>

565
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:10,561
You know, I never knew how amazing
life can be without the haze of drugs.

566
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:14,866
It's just the little things, like...

567
00:36:14,938 --> 00:36:17,736
smelling the flowers-

568
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:24,771
<i>Or watching the sunset,
or just walking along the beach.</i>

569
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:29,376
You know, these things get me
way higher than drugs ever could.

570
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,717
<i>That's great, um, Bryce.</i>

571
00:36:31,788 --> 00:36:35,622
So, we have got a lot of
catching up to do with your career.

572
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:38,126
<i>Now I brought a script. It is fantastic.</i>

573
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:40,823
Actually, your part is comedic.
Uh, sort of a wise-cracking-

574
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:43,229
Bob, this chamomile is so amazing.

575
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,861
It is blowing my mind, man.
Smell this.

576
00:36:46,937 --> 00:36:49,201
No. Thank you, though.

577
00:36:49,272 --> 00:36:52,469
Um, back to the script.
Again, it took a lot to get this-

578
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:54,874
Bob, one thing sobriety
has taught me...

579
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:59,075
is that you have to take time out
to enjoy life's little pleasures.

580
00:36:59,149 --> 00:37:02,141
Can you put the tea down for a sec?

581
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:06,916
- Bryce?
- Oh, my God.

582
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,322
<i>- Bryce.
- Oh, my God.</i>

583
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:16,263
The nation's rapidly growing
prison population...

584
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:19,097
which recently passed
the 20 million mark...

585
00:37:19,169 --> 00:37:21,865
has created
a severe overcrowding problem.

586
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:24,372
<i>In an attempt to alleviate
the overcrowding...</i>

587
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:27,968
<i>the government announced today
that a random selection of U.S. households...</i>

588
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:31,036
<i>will be asked to take prisoners
into their homes.</i>

589
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:39,553
Hi. Uh, I'm Dick.

590
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:43,092
This-This is my wife, Sarah.

591
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,957
This is our daughter, Allie.

592
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:48,657
And this is our son, Bobby. He's 10.

593
00:37:48,732 --> 00:37:51,633
Welcome to our home.

594
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:53,635
'Sup.

595
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,307
Don't drop this shit on me, bitch!

596
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:04,370
What the fuck are you doing? Don't just
stand there! Get your man something to drink!

597
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,746
Damn, it's good to see some women.

598
00:38:13,823 --> 00:38:15,757
Mm-mm-mm.

599
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:19,989
Mr. Prisoner, my tattoo hurts.

600
00:38:20,063 --> 00:38:22,463
Lights out, guys.

601
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:27,129
If successful,
another 20,000 prisoners...

602
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:31,504
will be moved to suburban homes
by the first of next month.

603
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:38,272
<i>Hello and welcome once again
to Focus on Film.</i>

604
00:38:38,348 --> 00:38:40,282
I'm Kenneth Garber.

605
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:43,080
And I'm joined by Kwame Roberts...

606
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:46,122
<i>president of the National Coalition
of African Americans...</i>

607
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:51,149
and James Nakatami, director of
the Asian American Alliance for Equality.

608
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,719
Mr. Roberts, let's start with you.

609
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:59,133
Your organization is not pleased with
this film's depiction of African Americans.

610
00:38:59,202 --> 00:39:02,069
Oh, that is absolutely correct, Kenneth.

611
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:04,436
We are just about halfway
through the film...

612
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:08,170
and we've yet to see a dignified
portrayal of a person of color.

613
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:12,682
So far, we've only been shown
as vicious criminals or sex fiends.

614
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:14,717
Just take a look at that last sketch.

615
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:17,116
So, what specifically
is your group demanding?

616
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:21,214
The filmmakers put a positive black role model
on that screen in the next 10 minutes...

617
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:25,921
<i>or we will be organizing a nationwide
walkout of black moviegoers.</i>

618
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:29,397
That means every single African American
currently watching this film...

619
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:31,400
will exit the theater.

620
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:33,732
<i>Mr. Nakatami,
you are equally unhappy?</i>

621
00:39:33,803 --> 00:39:36,465
<i>Thus far, there are maybe one...</i>

622
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:40,498
<i>or, at the most, two,
three Asian faces in the film.</i>

623
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:43,808
How do you feel about such
gross underrepresentation?

624
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,781
Me no "rikey."

625
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,244
Excuse me?

626
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,652
Me no "rikey."

627
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:56,658
And... back to the film.

628
00:39:56,893 --> 00:39:59,919
In legal news, local
18-year-old Joey Frankel...

629
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:04,296
is suing for the right to be
sexually harassed in the workplace.

630
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:07,962
Frankel, an employee
at Carl's Copy Shop in Phoenix...

631
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:10,302
alleged that during
his three years there...

632
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:15,436
not a single female coworker made
inappropriate sexual advances toward him...

633
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:18,276
either verbal or physical.

634
00:40:19,516 --> 00:40:21,643
In other news, health officials
have confirmed...

635
00:40:21,718 --> 00:40:24,619
that a potentially deadly
airborne virus...

636
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,248
has been spreading
across eastern Canada.

637
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:31,055
And is now moving south towards the coast of-

638
00:40:42,205 --> 00:40:44,139
<i>Hey, Norm.</i>

639
00:40:49,612 --> 00:40:51,546
Hey, Norm.
Okay.

640
00:40:51,614 --> 00:40:54,845
- Oh, there goes Norm again.
- He looks pissed.

641
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:08,261
Onion tip line.
What do you got?

642
00:41:11,668 --> 00:41:13,602
- All right. Listen to me.
- Hi, Norm.

643
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:18,107
Our job isn't to advertise our parent company's
movie via goddamn penguin.

644
00:41:18,174 --> 00:41:21,575
<i>Our job is to deliver
to the American people...</i>

645
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:24,807
<i>fair, balanced, hard-hitting news.</i>

646
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:30,148
<i>In this crazy world, the Onion may be
the only news source that people can truly trust.</i>

647
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,348
<i>Look, don't be so naive, Norm.
This is a business.</i>

648
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:39,393
Listen, Norm. I know you're not
gonna want to hear this.

649
00:41:39,462 --> 00:41:41,453
But the suits at
Global Tetrahedron...

650
00:41:41,531 --> 00:41:45,365
want you to open up Friday's broadcast
with a slightly different lead story.

651
00:41:48,638 --> 00:41:51,801
But Friday is the day
Azmenistan gave Sloravia...

652
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:54,867
as a deadline for pulling out
of the Uzbagiyak region.

653
00:41:54,944 --> 00:41:58,345
<i>It's also the day that
Cockpuncher opens.</i>

654
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:02,511
I mean, this Azmenistani, uh, sloppy
ground thing is all well and good, right?

655
00:42:02,585 --> 00:42:05,076
But it's a million miles away.
Nobody gives a fuck about it.

656
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:08,818
<i>The more important news story
right now is Cockpuncher mania.</i>

657
00:42:08,892 --> 00:42:11,053
It's sweeping the nation.

658
00:42:11,127 --> 00:42:13,994
And it better sweep
your newscast Friday.

659
00:42:15,865 --> 00:42:17,230
Take a putt?

660
00:42:18,401 --> 00:42:19,868
No?

661
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:33,374
You owe me a pound,
you son of a bitch. I made that last one.

662
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:36,245
<i>From Global Tetrahedron Pictures...</i>

663
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,810
- Steven Seagal is-
- Awesome!

664
00:42:38,888 --> 00:42:43,222
Goddamn whorish corporate plugs.

665
00:42:45,995 --> 00:42:47,929
I'm a newsman, damn it.

666
00:42:47,997 --> 00:42:50,192
<i>Oh!</i>

667
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,762
<i>- Cockpuncher.
- I don't think you have the balls.</i>

668
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,435
Oh, I cannot wait for Friday.

669
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:06,748
- Excuse me, sir.
- What can I get you?

670
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:09,979
No, thank you. I don't drink,
or use drugs for that matter.

671
00:43:10,053 --> 00:43:14,012
No. I was just wondering if you could
give me directions to the local library.

672
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,753
Um, two blocks down
and left on Second.

673
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:21,194
Thank you very much.
You have a wonderful evening.

674
00:43:27,036 --> 00:43:29,766
Mm-hmm.

675
00:43:35,178 --> 00:43:37,612
Thank you.
You have a wonderful evening.

676
00:44:22,759 --> 00:44:26,422
<i>Uh, help?</i>

677
00:44:27,764 --> 00:44:30,995
Has your penis become stuck
in a library book return slot?

678
00:44:31,067 --> 00:44:34,628
<i>Call Kostman's, the penis people.</i>

experts for 64 years.

00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:43,035
We'll get any penis
out of any slot for $39.95.

682
00:44:43,112 --> 00:44:45,342
<i>That's my personal guarantee.</i>

686
00:44:57,393 --> 00:44:59,657
Dave got my penis out.

687
00:44:59,729 --> 00:45:02,459
Dave got all our penises out!

<i>Kostman's, the penis people.</i>

689
00:45:09,572 --> 00:45:11,506
This week's campaign is gonna rule.

690
00:45:11,574 --> 00:45:14,236
I can't wait for the assault
on castle Dragonflame.

691
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:16,608
I know. It's gonna be
super totally awesome.

692
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:21,207
I have a third-level elven cleric
I can't wait to pit against my foes.

693
00:45:21,284 --> 00:45:24,776
Well, uh, don't count on it being too awesome.
Look who just showed up.

694
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:32,823
<i>Well, what have we stumbled upon here?</i>

695
00:45:32,895 --> 00:45:34,726
Oh, shit.

696
00:45:34,797 --> 00:45:37,391
Dare you challenge the might
of Proteus the Invincible?

697
00:45:40,336 --> 00:45:45,239
Ah, I see there are some beardless saplings
with us this afternoon...

698
00:45:45,308 --> 00:45:48,368
who have ne'er tasted my blade.

699
00:45:48,444 --> 00:45:50,344
This douche bag ruins everything.

700
00:45:50,413 --> 00:45:52,677
Prepare for total devastation.

701
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:57,452
<i>The magical wizardry,
expert chaos techniques...</i>

702
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,217
and incomparable equipment roster
of Proteus the Invincible...

703
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:06,523
will make short work
of all pretenders to the throne.

704
00:46:16,873 --> 00:46:18,807
Okay, Lyle.

705
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:23,107
How's about letting some of
the younger guys have a chance today?

706
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:25,147
Okay?

707
00:46:25,214 --> 00:46:28,581
When it comes to Wizards and Warbeasts,
I expect no quarter.

708
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:30,915
And none shall be given.

709
00:46:33,156 --> 00:46:35,090
All right.

710
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:49,261
Now that I have readied my provisions
for the day's foray into the fairy realms...

711
00:46:51,774 --> 00:46:54,470
let the slaughter begin.

712
00:47:41,691 --> 00:47:44,660
None remain standing before me.

713
00:47:44,727 --> 00:47:49,187
All have fallen before
the might of my broadsword.

714
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:04,910
Hope you're happy, Lyle. You just ruined
another Saturday for the whole gaming club.

715
00:48:04,981 --> 00:48:07,882
What care I for
the sniveling excuses of the weak?

716
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:10,783
They shall bow before my wrath.

717
00:48:10,853 --> 00:48:15,813
In the realm of fantasy, only the strong
shall survive to conquer another day.

718
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:18,383
Whatever.

719
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:28,335
Alas, the day's adventuring
is now done...

720
00:48:28,404 --> 00:48:32,170
and I must take
the number two bus back home.

721
00:48:32,241 --> 00:48:37,235
If only I could live in
the world of fantasy forever...

722
00:48:37,313 --> 00:48:40,407
instead of being forced to
put up with this banal realm...

723
00:48:40,483 --> 00:48:43,145
and its silly, weak-minded mortals.

724
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:50,284
Oh, how I wish I could live in
the realm of Wizards and Warbeasts...

725
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:53,021
ruling the land as
a mighty conqueror...

726
00:48:53,095 --> 00:48:58,294
smiting orcs and ogres alike
with my trusty broadsword.

727
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:03,100
<i>Proteus the Invincible?</i>

728
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:07,700
<i>- I have heard your plea.
- What?</i>

729
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:13,716
<i>- Who-Who goes there?
- It is I, Gygax, demon of the Astral plane.</i>

730
00:49:13,783 --> 00:49:17,810
<i>Never before have I seen your equal
among the mortals that play this game.</i>

731
00:49:17,887 --> 00:49:20,549
What's going on? Guys?

732
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:23,888
<i>I have chosen to grant your wish,
Proteus the Invincible.</i>

733
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:28,928
<i>Come forth into the land of legends.</i>

734
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,302
God. Where am I?

735
00:49:38,374 --> 00:49:40,308
Ow!

736
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,664
<i>Oh, God. Where am I?</i>

737
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:06,998
<i>Proteus.</i>

738
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:15,435
Prepare to piss thyself, human.

739
00:50:17,113 --> 00:50:20,514
No, no, no.
No. No. No. No. Please.

740
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,984
Fucking geek.

741
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:29,820
After last night's heartbreaking
loss in Los Angeles...

742
00:50:29,892 --> 00:50:34,488
basketball star Dashante Jackson
had harsh words for the lord.

743
00:50:34,563 --> 00:50:37,031
You know, I'd like to put
the blame on God tonight...

744
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:41,661
<i>for not blessing me with the talent to
hit the game-winnin' three-pointer tonight.</i>

745
00:50:41,737 --> 00:50:45,833
You know, without him,
I would truly be goin' to the play-offs.

746
00:50:45,908 --> 00:50:48,308
Bitch, I don't know why
you do this shit to me!

747
00:50:51,213 --> 00:50:55,172
In news from our nation's capital,
a group of Alzheimer's disease sufferers...

748
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:58,709
marched on Washington today
demanding a cure for pancakes.

749
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:08,154
<i>Until this teakettle is cured...</i>

751
00:51:12,835 --> 00:51:14,598

<i>Give 'em hell!</i>

754
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:31,352
<i>Hi. I'm Michael Bolton.</i>

755
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,354
Did you know that all over
the world...

756
00:51:33,422 --> 00:51:36,186
there are millions of children
living in extreme poverty?

757
00:51:36,258 --> 00:51:40,354
For more than 40 years, the What About
the Children Foundation has been making...

758
00:51:40,429 --> 00:51:44,024
a difference in the lives of
kids throughout the third world.

759
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,034
And so can you...

760
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,627
by adopting a What About
the Children sponsor child.

761
00:51:48,704 --> 00:51:51,730
But don't take my word for it.
Take Dibo's.

762
00:51:51,807 --> 00:51:54,401
Hello. I am Dibo.

763
00:51:54,477 --> 00:51:57,446
<i>- Come.
- Thanks to What About the Children...</i>

764
00:51:57,513 --> 00:52:00,812
<i>Dibo has seen his standard
of living soar well above the level...</i>

765
00:52:00,883 --> 00:52:03,317
<i>of his pathetic
poverty-stricken village.</i>

766

<i>with some of the little things
in life we so often take for granted.</i>

769
00:52:10,793 --> 00:52:15,924

Get your own sponsor family!

776
00:52:40,689 --> 00:52:45,023
Thank goodness the McCormicks sent me
a security system to keep these animals out.

777
00:52:45,094 --> 00:52:49,030
Thank you, Dibo. It's stories like yours
that make it all worthwhile.

778
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:56,228
In breaking news, we now join
Dana Dobbs in Lake Shore Bluff...

779
00:52:56,305 --> 00:53:00,435
where a verdict has just been handed down
in the Timothy Shanahan trial.

780
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:03,205
Dana, what's the latest
on the situation?

781
00:53:03,279 --> 00:53:05,213
Well, Norm, as you can see...

782
00:53:05,281 --> 00:53:07,215
I'm here outside the First
District Federal Courthouse...

783
00:53:07,283 --> 00:53:11,982
where this angry mob of Negroes
is rioting over the guilty verdict...

784
00:53:12,054 --> 00:53:14,022
in the Timothy Shanahan case.

785
00:53:20,229 --> 00:53:22,697
We will keep you posted.

786
00:53:22,765 --> 00:53:25,029
- Thanks, Dana.
- Thank you, Norm.

787
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:28,036
Those crazy Negroes.

788
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:30,902
# Oh, when you love me right up front
You know that I don't mind #

789
00:53:30,973 --> 00:53:32,964
Enter.

790
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:34,976
Pardon me, General.
Your meeting is about to start.

791
00:53:35,044 --> 00:53:36,978
- #Take me from behind #
- Yeah.

792
00:53:37,046 --> 00:53:42,211
So, as you can see, generals, Deathco
Amalgamated's M-47 "Jumpin' Johnny" land mine...

793
00:53:42,284 --> 00:53:48,245
earned a triple-A rating in field trials
and boasts a 98% kill-through ratio...

794
00:53:48,324 --> 00:53:52,420
making it the best land mine
for the government's dollar.

795
00:53:59,468 --> 00:54:01,902
Nah, we're gonna pass.

796
00:54:01,971 --> 00:54:03,905
Thanks anyway.

797
00:54:53,222 --> 00:54:55,156
Fuck!

798
00:54:56,392 --> 00:54:58,826
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

799
00:54:58,894 --> 00:55:03,854
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

800
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:07,096
Fuck, fuck!

801
00:55:08,337 --> 00:55:10,464
<i>You call yourself a salesman?</i>

802
00:55:10,539 --> 00:55:14,771
We spent $400 billion of the company's money
developing these land mines for the military!

803
00:55:14,843 --> 00:55:17,437
You'd better find a way
to unload these things!

804
00:55:17,513 --> 00:55:20,038
<i>Tired of backbreaking yard work?</i>

805
00:55:20,115 --> 00:55:23,346
<i>Then jump back for Jumpin' Johnny!</i>

806
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,148
<i>Jumpin' Johnny
blasts weeds to pieces!</i>

807
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,020
<i>Frags ragweed...</i>

Get Jumpin' Johnny today!</i>

813

It's now time for our weekly
Inspirational Portrait.

814
00:55:47,142 --> 00:55:50,543
<i>This week, the Brendan Laroux story.</i>

815
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:53,878
<i>Brendan Laroux's story is one of dreams.</i>

816
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:57,112
<i>As a young boy,
he wanted to become a dancer...</i>

817
00:55:57,186 --> 00:55:59,950
<i>but at the age of 12,
he lost his legs.</i>

818
00:56:00,022 --> 00:56:02,354
<i>Now, this would be a setback
for any youngster...</i>

819
00:56:02,424 --> 00:56:06,292
<i>but not Brendan, who set
his eyes on being a surgeon...</i>

820
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:09,763
<i>until, at age 14,
he lost his wrists.</i>

821
00:56:09,832 --> 00:56:14,064
<i>Without my wrists, there was nothing
to keep my hands attached to my arms.</i>

822
00:56:14,136 --> 00:56:18,869
So, even though my hands were fine,
l- I lost them too.

823
00:56:18,941 --> 00:56:23,503
Now, Brendan may not have had as many
hands and legs as the other boys...

824
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:26,241
<i>but there was one dream
he didn't let go of-</i>

825
00:56:26,315 --> 00:56:28,249
<i>becoming a professional
hockey player.</i>

826
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:33,253
<i>At first, the other players
treated him fairly.</i>

827
00:56:33,322 --> 00:56:37,315
<i>But after seeing all the attention that
Brendan was getting, they became jealous.</i>

828
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:41,762
<i>The special treatment stopped. Brendan
toughed it out in the minors for two brutal years.</i>

829
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,765
<i>But it all paid off when
he finally got the call.</i>

830
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:49,202
<i>The coach said,
"How would you like to be pro hockey's...</i>

831
00:56:49,271 --> 00:56:53,298
first legless, handless player?"

832
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:58,312
<i>It was an inspiring night, full of inspiration.</i>

833
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,941
<i>But then, two days later...</i>

834
00:57:02,017 --> 00:57:05,077
<i>Brendan found out that
his rib cage was backwards...</i>

835
00:57:05,154 --> 00:57:09,614
<i>leaving his spine exposed, and that
he needed a complete muscle transplant.</i>

836
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:12,525
<i>The risky surgery lasted 720 hours.</i>

837
00:57:12,594 --> 00:57:14,562
<i>Brendan came back better than ever.</i>

838
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:23,102
<i>Brendan persevered
and was selected M. V.P.</i>

839
00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:28,542
<i>Just when it seemed like the dark clouds
had finally passed, Brendan contracted scurvy...</i>

840
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:32,671
<i>went bankrupt,
and his wife was eaten by wolves.</i>

841
00:57:32,748 --> 00:57:35,546
<i>He was also molested
by his Uncle Jerry.</i>

842
00:57:35,617 --> 00:57:39,383
<i>Today, Brendan's journey
has opened the door for many athletes...</i>

843
00:57:39,455 --> 00:57:41,582
<i>who never would have
been given a chance...</i>

844
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:46,185
<i>if he hadn't broken down
pro sports' physical ability barrier.</i>

845
00:57:46,261 --> 00:57:50,527
Athletes like Emma Heathcoat,
cerebral-palsy sufferer...

846
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:53,227
<i>and three-time national
equestrian champ.</i>

847

<i>Gil Sarinen, the world's first
professional comatose diver...</i>

850
00:58:21,497 --> 00:58:25,194
<i>and, of course, Chicago
shooting guard Herbie Cohn...</i>

851
00:58:26,201 --> 00:58:28,965
<i>who was born with Judaism.</i>

852
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:42,917
<i>Yes, none of it would have
been possible without Brendan Laroux...</i>

853
00:58:42,985 --> 00:58:46,477
<i>a true Inspirational Portrait.</i>

854
00:58:47,856 --> 00:58:50,381
In adult entertainment
industry news...

855
00:58:50,459 --> 00:58:53,553
the nation's porn stars
gathered today in Los Angeles...

856
00:58:53,629 --> 00:58:58,362
<i>in a unified demand for stronger,
more intense sexual intercourse.</i>

857
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:00,197
Fuck me with your big cock!

858
00:59:00,269 --> 00:59:03,295
- Give it to me harder!
- Fuck me till I explode!

859
00:59:04,573 --> 00:59:09,306
Calling the tragedy a terrible,
unintentional mistake...

860
00:59:09,378 --> 00:59:12,643
the Los Angeles Police Department
issued an apology today...

861
00:59:12,714 --> 00:59:15,274
for the accidental shooting, clubbing...

862
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:19,753
stabbing, firebombing, choking,
impaling, electrocution...

863
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:23,349
and lethal-injection death
of an African-American man.

<i>I'm Kip Kendall reporting

<i>- As the conflict between Sloravia
and Azmenistan deepens...</i>

866
00:59:31,667 --> 00:59:36,695
college campuses across this country
have become a hotbed of political activity.

867
00:59:36,772 --> 00:59:40,401
We're here in Santa Cruz, California today.
Let's listen in.

868
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:43,934
Stop the violence.

869
00:59:44,012 --> 00:59:46,003
Stop the violence!

870
00:59:46,081 --> 00:59:49,209
<i>Increase the peace!</i>

871
00:59:50,819 --> 00:59:54,721
For the past three years,
Sloravia and Azmenistan...

872
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:58,157
they've been locked in
a pointless and bloody war.

873
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:02,027
Their cowardly leaders send
innocent young men into battle to die.

874
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:06,733
Well, you know what?

875
01:00:06,802 --> 01:00:10,602
We need to put those leaders
in a room and let them fight it out!

876
01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:19,010
And you know what else? What these countries
need to do, what they need to do-

877
01:00:19,081 --> 01:00:22,881
<i>- Th-They need to listen to
their women a little more.</i>

878
01:00:22,951 --> 01:00:28,912
Because women create life,
while men, they destroy it.

879
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,887
<i>So, let's all stand up against
the corporate war machine...</i>

880
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:36,795
that only exists to do
the imperialist agenda...

881
01:00:36,865 --> 01:00:39,834
against the- the oppressed minority.

882
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:41,836
Right?

883
01:00:45,007 --> 01:00:49,603
Love your brother! Peace! One love.

884
01:00:56,985 --> 01:00:59,078
<i>- Excuse me, Chad.
- 'Sup?</i>

885
01:00:59,154 --> 01:01:03,989
We're with the U.N.
And let me just say, we are very impressed.

886
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:07,085
What you said up there
was dead on, Chad. Dead on.

887
01:01:07,162 --> 01:01:08,493
What?

888
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:12,796
We want you to negotiate talks
between Sloravia and Azmenistan.

889
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:15,860
Shut up, dude.

890
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:19,430
We're convinced you are the man who can
finally bring peace to this troubled region.

891
01:01:20,842 --> 01:01:26,007
Will you do it, Chad?
Will you help us increase the peace?

892
01:01:28,884 --> 01:01:32,285
- Fuck, yeah! Fuck, yeah, dude. I'm in!
- Great.

893
01:01:32,354 --> 01:01:34,822
- Would you come with me, please?
- Yeah.

894
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:43,458
<i>Your systematic campaign of aggression...</i>

895
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:46,330
against my country is the reason-

896
01:01:46,401 --> 01:01:51,998
Our military operations are purely
in response to your violation of the treaty.

897
01:01:52,074 --> 01:01:54,838
<i>- You are the one to violate the peace treaty!
- We?</i>

Guys, chill, chill.
Let's take a chill pill here.

900
01:02:09,224 --> 01:02:15,185
Don't you guys realize that war, no matter
how justified it may seem, it's not the answer.

901
01:02:16,932 --> 01:02:18,923
It's not?

902
01:02:20,202 --> 01:02:24,229
No, man.
Love is the answer.

903
01:02:28,343 --> 01:02:33,440
Now, let's get
this peace shit started.

01:04:07,809 --> 01:04:11,472
the crisis between Sloravia and Azmenistan
deepened today...

when the leaders of
the two rival nations-

Tomorrow is the deadline for Sloravia
to pull out of the Uzbagiyak region.

- Good evening.

923
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:42,892
For the past 27 years,
I've sat at this desk...

924
01:06:42,964 --> 01:06:44,955
dedicating myself to one thing-

925
01:06:45,033 --> 01:06:48,662
delivering the news to you,
the American viewing public...

926
01:06:48,737 --> 01:06:52,537
in the most fair, balanced,
serious way possible.

927
01:06:52,607 --> 01:06:54,268
What's he doing?

928
01:06:54,342 --> 01:06:56,970
Well, things are changing
in the news game...

929
01:06:57,045 --> 01:06:59,843
and I've been under pressure
to change with them.

930
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:04,716
<i>The powers that be at this network

932
01:07:06,955 --> 01:07:08,718
So what do they want me to do?

933
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:11,224
Plug our parent company's movies...

934

a two-bit network news whore.

936
01:07:16,097 --> 01:07:21,558
Well, I've been giving this
whole ugly business a lot of thought...

937
01:07:21,636 --> 01:07:24,605
and just a few moments
before going on the air tonight...

938
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:26,971
I finally came to a conclusion.

939
01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:30,068
And that conclusion is-

940
01:07:30,145 --> 01:07:33,672
<i>Nobody move

for its rotting, immoral culture.

950
01:08:09,451 --> 01:08:11,578
Like that's gonna happen.

951
01:08:11,653 --> 01:08:15,214

952
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:19,249

Hey, Norm. Some crazy shit, huh?

1015
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,337
Look, with all due respect,
we just wanted to ask, um...

1016
01:13:36,411 --> 01:13:38,436
what were you gonna say
during your speech?

1017
01:13:38,513 --> 01:13:42,677
Yeah, we were wondering what
the conclusion that you came to was.

1018
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:46,208
Well, I was going to say, " I'm mad as hell
and not going to take it anymore."

1019
01:13:46,287 --> 01:13:48,221

01:13:48,289 --> 01:13:50,519
I think I've learned a little lesson
I won't soon forget.

1021
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:56,359
As a matter of fact, I think we've all learned
a few things in the past 90 minutes.

1022
01:13:57,965 --> 01:14:00,957
We've learned that Irishmen
have huge nipples.

1023
01:14:01,035 --> 01:14:05,267
We've learned that film-critic intellectuals
are a bunch of gaywads.

1024
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:08,104
And, most of all, we've learned...

1025
01:14:08,176 --> 01:14:12,579
that creeping corporate
influence over the news...

1026
01:14:12,647 --> 01:14:14,808
protects us from terrorism.

1027
01:14:19,187 --> 01:14:23,817
<i>Hey, everybody, we're all gonna get laid!</i>

1028
01:14:41,809 --> 01:14:43,743
Um, I can't help but think...

1029
01:14:43,811 --> 01:14:48,407
it must have taken a lot of courage
to make such a provocative film.

1030
01:14:48,483 --> 01:14:52,146
And joining us
to discuss just that...

1031
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:55,451
<i>is the man who green-lit the film.</i>

1032
01:14:55,523 --> 01:14:57,616
Thanks, Kenneth.
Pleasure to be here.

1033
01:14:57,692 --> 01:15:03,562
So, uh, now, while you gave the makers
of this film tremendous leeway, obviously...

1034
01:15:03,631 --> 01:15:06,361
still, there was some material
that you simply refused to allow?

1035
01:15:06,434 --> 01:15:08,368
That's true.

1036
01:15:08,436 --> 01:15:11,894
Basically, as committed as I was to letting
these guys be free to do their thing...

1037
01:15:11,973 --> 01:15:15,841
there were simply some images
that I just didn't feel comfortable with.

1038
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:18,504
Mm-hmm. But I understand
you did bring some clips.

1039
01:15:18,579 --> 01:15:22,140
That's right. Uh, I would like to show
some special bonus material.

1040
01:15:22,216 --> 01:15:24,878
These are scenes that didn't
make it into the movie.

1041
01:15:24,952 --> 01:15:27,887
Great. Let's take a look.

1042
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:45,430
So what we do is we get the kitty...

1043
01:15:45,506 --> 01:15:47,940
and we put it in
a simple egg batter.

1044
01:15:48,009 --> 01:15:50,978
Careful. Okay. Shh. That's fine.

1045
01:15:51,045 --> 01:15:52,979
And then we just simply roll it around...

1046
01:15:53,047 --> 01:15:54,981
making sure we cover
the whole thing.

1047
01:15:55,049 --> 01:15:57,244
It's all right, baby. It's okay.

1048
01:15:57,318 --> 01:16:00,617
Get him completely covered in
an her bed bread-crumb batter here.

1049
