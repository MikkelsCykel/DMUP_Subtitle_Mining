1
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:44,358
Let's go, Buster.

2
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:05,737
Beer.

3
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,079
And a bottle.

4
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:11,655
Ain't much good.

5
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,348
It's all there is.

6
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:29,577
Will you want anything else?

7
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,083
Just a peaceful hour
to drink it in.

8
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,981
Flea-bitten range bums
don't usually stop in Lago.

9
00:08:05,438 --> 00:08:08,406
Life here's a little too quick for 'em.

10
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:16,311
Maybe you think you're fast enough
to keep up with us, huh?

11
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:44,793
A lot faster
than you'll ever live to be.

12
00:09:07,742 --> 00:09:09,597
Yes, sir?

13
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:11,680
A shave and a hot bath?

14
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:13,729
That'll be 90 cents.

15
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:36,933
Cash.

16
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:40,001
What I mean to say is that
the 90 cents usually comes first...

17
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:42,082
but, hell, it don't really matter.

18
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:44,227
Before or after,
what's the diff?

19
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:04,353
Eau de lilac's only ten cents more.

20
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:06,794
Lilac water.
The ladies love it.

21
00:10:06,794 --> 00:10:09,828
Shall we make it
an even dollar? No.

22
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,548
Right you are, gentlemen.

23
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:53,297
Be right with you.
Just have a chair.

24
00:10:57,494 --> 00:11:00,014
You don't like our company?

25
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:04,689
What's the matter with you?

26
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:09,938
I'm speakin' to you, pig shit.

27
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:12,395
I think he's got
some of that pig shit in his ear.

28
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:17,333
I don't know which smells worse,
him or the shit in the bottle.

29
00:12:32,898 --> 00:12:35,581
What did you say
your name was again?

30
00:12:36,802 --> 00:12:38,558
I didn't.

31
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:43,326
No. I guess you didn't
at that, did you?

32
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:26,236
Why don't you watch where you're going?
Look at this. It's ruined.

33
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,017
There's no need for all that.

34
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,650
All what?

35
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,861
If you want to get acquainted,
why don't you just say so?

36
00:13:34,817 --> 00:13:36,378
Acquainted?

37
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,490
You'd be amusing
if you weren't so pathetic!

38
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:44,476
Just a minute.
I'm not finished with you yet.

39
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:46,650
At a distance,
you'd almost pass for a man.

40
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:49,537
But you're certainly
a disappointment up close, aren't you?

41
00:13:57,698 --> 00:14:02,073
To your feet, ma'am.
They're almost as big as your mouth.

42
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:04,600
You know what you are?

43
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,137
Just trash.

44
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:09,723
A bottle of whiskey for courage
and the manners of a goat.

45
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,362
You're the one who could use
a lesson in manners.

46
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,285
Not from you, whiskey breath.

47
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,205
Let go of me.

48
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,282
Let go!

49
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:28,982
Let go of me!

50
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,539
Let go of me!

51
00:14:30,614 --> 00:14:32,556
Put me down!

52
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:39,763
What are you doing?

53
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,539
What are you doing?

54
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:24,376
My horse.

55
00:17:03,462 --> 00:17:05,251
A room.

56
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:15,970
Would you like to register,
please, sir?

57
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:53,083
Somebody, please help me.
Help me!

58
00:20:08,382 --> 00:20:10,291
Damn you all to hell!

59
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:17,600
- Good morning. Sleep well?
- Yeah.

60
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:21,929
Say, are you planning to stay,
keep your room another night?

61
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,788
- I'll let you know.
- All right. Anything you say.

62
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,686
Mornin'.

63
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:25,699
- I've still got a bath coming.
- Hot bath comin' right up. Yes, sir.

64
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,953
Put some more hot water in that tub.
This gentleman wants a bath.

65
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:35,949
You can hang your clothes
right down there on the peg.

66
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:39,793
- Miss Peekins does a nice-- I'm sorry.
- Right this way, captain, sir.

67
00:22:39,862 --> 00:22:43,091
Unless'n you want Mordecai
to take 'em out while you're soakin'...

68
00:22:43,157 --> 00:22:45,710
Miss Peekins does
a right clean boiled wash.

69
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,130
Uses lye for pants rabbits,
she does. No itch, no scratch.

70
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:59,669
Pour the water, Mordecai,
before it gets cold.

71
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,859
We want the gentleman
to be comfortable.

72
00:23:20,822 --> 00:23:23,986
I've been wantin' to talk to you.

73
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,029
I might as well
get this stool here...

74
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:33,069
and set right down
and do it, huh?

75
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:36,689
If that's all right
with you, huh?

76
00:23:46,198 --> 00:23:49,427
What it's about is Billy Borders.

77
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:52,943
Don't know the man.

78
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:56,753
You missed your chance,
'cause you shot him yesterday.

79
00:23:57,398 --> 00:24:01,871
Him and Ike Sharp
and Fred Morris.

80
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:08,306
You know, those is just the names
in case you're interested.

81
00:24:08,374 --> 00:24:10,873
Well, I'm not really interested,
Sheriff.

82
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:14,045
I can't say I blame you.

83
00:24:14,114 --> 00:24:16,569
Billy, he wasn't a loved man, no.

84
00:24:16,673 --> 00:24:21,463
He didn't have much personality.
What he did have was all bad,just bad.

85
00:24:23,618 --> 00:24:26,651
What you're tryin' to say is
there's no charge, right?

86
00:24:30,146 --> 00:24:34,488
'' Forgive and forget.''
That's our motto.

87
00:24:39,682 --> 00:24:41,470
You dirty bastard!

88
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,801
I'll kill you!

89
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:46,720
Damn it, Callie!

90
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:56,026
- Callie, damn it!
- Let go of me, you fat lug!

91
00:24:56,098 --> 00:24:58,170
Stop-- Ouch!

92
00:24:58,242 --> 00:24:59,965
Tell him I'd appreciate it...

93
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:04,190
if he doesn't leave town
until I talk to him.

94
00:25:04,258 --> 00:25:06,975
Goddamn it!

95
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,114
I'll kill you!

96
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:17,785
I wonder why it took her
so long to get mad?

97
00:25:18,113 --> 00:25:20,830
Because maybe you didn't
go back for more.

98
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:24,960
It don't seem to me
that we got a choice.

99
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:27,808
Seein' we got no time
to send for help...

100
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:30,426
and further seein' that
our sheriff's about as much use...

101
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:32,352
as tits on a boar.

102
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:34,589
Sorry I'm late.
Anything happen?

103
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,796
No, no.
His Honor's had the floor.

104
00:25:36,865 --> 00:25:39,516
In case you hadn't heard, Stacey Bridges
and the Carlin brothers...

105
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:42,552
- are due to get out of jail today.
- They comin' here?

106
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:45,887
That's their plan according to reports.
No reason to believe they've changed it.

107
00:25:45,953 --> 00:25:48,342
Possibly they've repented
their ways.

108
00:25:48,418 --> 00:25:51,626
Preacher, they're gonna burn this town
to the ground, and you know it.

109
00:25:51,726 --> 00:25:54,213
What we're talking about now
is a way to stop them.

110
00:25:54,285 --> 00:25:57,187
We've got to find
that way now, and quick.

111
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:59,912
Nevertheless, my conscience
will not allow me to be a party...

112
00:25:59,982 --> 00:26:01,924
to the hiring
of a professional gunfighter.

113
00:26:01,998 --> 00:26:05,260
Maybe you'd like to go out there
and stand them off yourself, Preacher.

114
00:26:06,221 --> 00:26:08,163
I'm just a simple man of God.

115
00:26:08,237 --> 00:26:10,474
It's time we unsimplified you,
Reverend.

116
00:26:10,542 --> 00:26:12,931
Borders, Morris and Short
were professional gunfighters...

117
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:14,762
on the payroll
of the Lago Mining Company...

118
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,164
to protect our interests
and the interests of this town...

119
00:26:17,229 --> 00:26:19,051
which are identical.

120
00:26:19,118 --> 00:26:22,118
They stood around drinking beer
and looking snotty for a full year.

121
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:24,197
Then one day before we actually
needed the bastards...

122
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,277
they managed to get
themselves killed.

123
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,771
So if you've got a suggestion,
we'd be delighted to hear it.

124
00:26:28,845 --> 00:26:30,667
Otherwise,
take your conscience elsewhere...

125
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:32,521
while we think
about saving your ass.

126
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:36,397
Land sakes!
Where's time gone to?

127
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:40,548
Miss Peekins' eldest
is feeling poorly. I promised--

128
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,358
If you gentlemen will excuse me.

129
00:26:49,805 --> 00:26:53,318
Well, we were talkin'
about hirin' a gunfighter.

130
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,113
But we don't know anything
about that fella there.

131
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:58,215
We know he took the best we could find
to hire like Grant took Vicksburg.

132
00:26:58,286 --> 00:27:00,675
Yeah, with a hidden gun in his lap.

133
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,132
Three for three.
One right between the eyes!

134
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:07,434
Goddamnedest shooting
I ever even heard of.

135
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,323
I still say
we're asking for trouble!

136
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:12,389
What do we know about him?
Who is he? Where does he come from?

137
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:15,331
You've got our permission
to go and ask him.

138
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:19,914
Although the last three that tried that
didn't fare all that well.

139
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:22,434
Let me out!

140
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:23,971
Damn you!

141
00:27:24,046 --> 00:27:26,020
Let go of me, you fat slug!

142
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,931
Let go of me!
Get off me!

143
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:32,911
Hey, come here. What is this?

144
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:35,572
I was just down there
soundin' out that stranger...

145
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:39,471
- when she come in blastin' away like--
- All right, Sam.

146
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:41,455
You're gonna let him
get away with this?

147
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,635
- Be a little patient, will ya?
- Patient?

148
00:27:43,706 --> 00:27:45,778
When a man's used
to having his own way...

149
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:47,791
you let him have it
until he goes too far.

150
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:52,084
Just what do you consider
goin' too far?

151
00:27:52,153 --> 00:27:55,765
Isn't forcible rape in broad daylight
a misdemeanor in this town?

152
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:58,322
There's too much at stake
to throw away on hysterics now.

153
00:27:58,394 --> 00:28:00,597
Hysterics?

154
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:05,112
I can remember some hysterics
one night not too long ago.

155
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:06,998
Callie, keep your mouth shut!

156
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:10,707
Morgan, get her out of here.

157
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:13,078
I'll see you later.

158
00:28:14,874 --> 00:28:17,638
Not while that squinty-eyed
son of a bitch is still breathing!

159
00:28:17,638 --> 00:28:19,296
Not while that squinty-eyed
son of a bitch is still breathing!

160
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:22,715
You wonder if there's
a man left in this town!

161
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:27,263
I mean, one honest-to-God man
with a full set of balls!

162
00:28:31,494 --> 00:28:33,501
Well...

163
00:28:34,534 --> 00:28:36,389
why not?

164
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:40,318
'Cause I'm not a gunfighter.

165
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,811
Well, don't get fact
mixed up with stupid.

166
00:28:45,446 --> 00:28:47,934
Besides, I have nothing
against these men.

167
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:49,980
Who'd you say they are?

168
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:54,181
Stacey Bridges and his cousins,
the Carlin boys.

169
00:28:54,246 --> 00:28:56,156
They worked for the company.

170
00:28:56,229 --> 00:28:58,618
What you call ''troubleshooters.''

171
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:02,843
Just like those three
you done in yesterday...

172
00:29:02,918 --> 00:29:05,569
except when they was here before,
there was lots of trouble.

173
00:29:05,638 --> 00:29:07,907
And they took care of it too...

174
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:10,396
except they got too damn big
for their britches.

175
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:13,100
Started pushin' people around
and takin' over the town...

176
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,017
- and we had to--
- Had to what?

177
00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:21,638
We had to take them into custody,
that's what.

178
00:29:21,714 --> 00:29:25,511
I clapped the old bracelets
on them myself.

179
00:29:36,722 --> 00:29:40,334
Hey, you won't be wantin'
that slab of pie, will ya?

180
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,886
You know what happened, friend?

181
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,565
They stole a golden ingot
out of the mining office...

182
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:55,595
and they hid it under the floorboard
of the shack that they lived in.

183
00:29:55,697 --> 00:29:58,545
Kind of careless of'em, wasn't it?

184
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:02,222
Does a mining company usually leave
gold ingots lyin' around like that?

185
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,592
That does seem a bit peculiar.

186
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:07,624
Matter of fact, Stacey kept bringing
that up at the trial all the time...

187
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,512
saying that he was
being railroaded.

188
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:12,585
That's why they're mad at us.

189
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:15,340
-I'll tell you what you can do, Sheriff.
-What?

190
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,930
When those boys
come back to town...

191
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:20,173
you just clap the bracelets
right on 'em.

192
00:30:20,241 --> 00:30:21,834
Me?

193
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,490
I might have forgot to mention...

194
00:30:24,562 --> 00:30:27,147
they were all three
passed out at the time.

195
00:30:28,337 --> 00:30:30,606
Look, I'm no lawman.

196
00:30:30,674 --> 00:30:32,583
They just hung
this thing on me...

197
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,544
when that young Marshal Duncan
was killed.

198
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,976
You know he was whipped to death
right here in this street.

199
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:39,562
Bullwhipped.
Damnedest thing I ever saw.

200
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,530
Why would anybody want
to do a thing like that?

201
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:47,213
I don't know. It wasn't anybody
from this town anyhow.

202
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:49,103
How do you know?

203
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,897
This is a good town
and these are good people.

204
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:56,722
Look, friend, we sure would like it
if you'd help us with our problem.

205
00:30:57,566 --> 00:31:01,014
Only problem you've got
is a short supply of guts.

206
00:31:01,086 --> 00:31:03,507
You people don't need me.

207
00:31:04,222 --> 00:31:05,912
Look.

208
00:31:05,982 --> 00:31:09,243
Place a couple of good riflemen
on top of that building.

209
00:31:10,013 --> 00:31:13,047
Maybe a couple more with shotguns
down behind grain bags over there.

210
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:16,151
A few more on this roof here.
A lookout up there in the tower.

211
00:31:16,221 --> 00:31:18,676
Maybe a rifleman.
That should take care of it.

212
00:31:18,782 --> 00:31:22,426
Well, what would it take
to see that through?

213
00:31:22,493 --> 00:31:24,981
The ambush.
What would it cost us?

214
00:31:25,054 --> 00:31:28,087
Sheriff, I don't know
if I really like this town that much.

215
00:31:28,157 --> 00:31:30,012
This is a God-fearin' town.

216
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:32,019
These are God-fearin' people.

217
00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:34,810
You like 'em, you save 'em.

218
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:39,251
What if we offered you
anything you want?

219
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:47,546
Anything?

220
00:31:47,613 --> 00:31:50,264
Unlimited credit.
That's what it means.

221
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:54,327
An open charge account
with no reckonin'.

222
00:31:54,685 --> 00:31:56,790
What His Honor's
trying to say is...

223
00:31:56,861 --> 00:32:00,244
you got yourself
a free hand in this town.

224
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:03,187
- Any damn thing I want, huh?
- Yeah. Go on. Help yourself.

225
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:06,011
Help yourself!. Go ahead.
It's my pleasure.

226
00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:07,987
Yes, sir.
Anything you want that's here...

227
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:10,298
as best as we can get it
for you, we will.

228
00:32:10,366 --> 00:32:14,140
Even if it's
some little squaw or Mex...

229
00:32:14,206 --> 00:32:16,726
to keep your bed warm at night.

230
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:18,548
Hey, you!

231
00:32:18,621 --> 00:32:20,476
Keep your sticky fingers
off them blankets...

232
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,429
and keep them kids under control.

233
00:32:22,494 --> 00:32:24,152
Goddamn savages.

234
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:27,037
And besides,
about handlin' that ambush...

235
00:32:27,102 --> 00:32:30,855
everybody in town,
more or less, is at your orders.

236
00:32:48,745 --> 00:32:50,600
Here you go.

237
00:32:52,425 --> 00:32:55,774
- No, no.
- Tell him it's all right.

238
00:32:57,546 --> 00:32:59,334
It's all right.

239
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,446
Anything I want, huh?

240
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:48,834
How's that feel?

241
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,680
Not bad. I'll take 'em.

242
00:33:51,785 --> 00:33:54,785
All right, that's three pairs
of hand-stitched boots...

243
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:57,411
and a tooled belt
with silver buckle.

244
00:33:57,482 --> 00:34:01,376
That'll be-- five and two,
carry the nine--

245
00:34:01,449 --> 00:34:04,133
that comes to exactly--

246
00:34:04,202 --> 00:34:06,503
No charge.

247
00:34:18,646 --> 00:34:20,653
Come on, now.

248
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:07,276
I'd like to get
all these people a drink.

249
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:11,441
Yes, sir. One round for the house.
There you are.

250
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:15,155
This gentleman here's
buying a round for the house.

251
00:35:15,221 --> 00:35:18,091
No fair. I ordered one too.
Don't I get a glass of beer?

252
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:21,330
You get a glass of beer
right there. Coming up.

253
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:27,180
There we are.

254
00:35:27,254 --> 00:35:31,377
Now, that's one round
for the house, sir. Anything else?

255
00:35:31,445 --> 00:35:33,104
Get yourself something.

256
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:36,785
Thank you very kindly, sir.
I'll have a cigar.

257
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:40,558
And smoke it later.

258
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:46,161
Now, including the smoke,
that comes to about $8.50.

259
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:48,946
There's no charge, Lutie.

260
00:35:50,178 --> 00:35:53,405
You was at the meeting.
Anything he wants in this town, he gets.

261
00:35:53,474 --> 00:35:56,605
- You voted on it.
- I didn't know that meant free whiskey.

262
00:35:57,474 --> 00:36:00,408
Everybody's got to put
somethin' in the kitty. Right?

263
00:36:02,945 --> 00:36:04,287
Right.

264
00:36:09,346 --> 00:36:12,193
About time this town
had a new sheriff.

265
00:36:14,913 --> 00:36:18,109
I'm the sheriff?
I'm the sheriff!.

266
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:21,306
I'm sorry, Sam...

267
00:36:21,377 --> 00:36:24,693
but you looked so comical
when he put your badge on the runt.

268
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:28,085
I'm not a runt anymore.
I'm the sheriff.

269
00:36:28,737 --> 00:36:31,836
- And the mayor.
- And I'm the mayor.

270
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:35,899
- Any objections?
- No. No, that's fine.

271
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:41,302
I'm the mayor.
I'm the sheriff.

272
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:44,541
No more
'' Mordecai, bring the water.

273
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,577
Mordecai, take the laundry.
Clean up the mess.''

274
00:36:47,649 --> 00:36:50,518
Hot damn!
I'm gonna declare a holiday.

275
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:52,571
Hot damn!

276
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:55,328
Wait a minute.

277
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:59,232
I can't be a sheriff
if I don't have a gun.

278
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,963
Is this about the size gun
you're lookin' for?

279
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:06,204
No, that one. That'll do.

280
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:16,701
Whatever this gent wants,
he's to have.

281
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:19,158
Orders of Mr. Drake and Mr. Allen.

282
00:37:19,617 --> 00:37:23,065
I want every man in the regiment
to have one of these nice rifles.

283
00:37:23,137 --> 00:37:24,381
What regiment?

284
00:37:27,169 --> 00:37:31,141
- The City of Lago Volunteers.
- Never heard of'em.

285
00:37:31,213 --> 00:37:32,969
You ought to. You're in it.

286
00:37:33,069 --> 00:37:36,265
So are you, you
and all of you out there.

287
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:39,301
I want you all out in the street
in ten minutes for drill.

288
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,778
Well, that's that.

289
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:13,254
Bridges, you Carlin boys...

290
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:17,574
don't forget your tickets
back here to my little hotel.

291
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:19,846
And don't worry--
they ain't loaded.

292
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:24,100
What about our horses?

293
00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:27,269
We had three good animals.

294
00:38:27,341 --> 00:38:30,407
What do you think you've been eatin'
the last six months?

295
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:39,939
Damn him!
I didn't eat my own horse!

296
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:43,715
That slop he fed us wasn't our horses.
He just stole 'em and sold 'em!

297
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:46,156
- Shut up.
- That's what he done!

298
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:50,021
When we get to Lago,
you can have the mayor's horse.

299
00:38:50,253 --> 00:38:51,846
Fried or barbecued.

300
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:55,876
Well, I guess we walk some.

301
00:38:55,949 --> 00:38:57,924
Old Drake and Allen don't seem
to have remembered.

302
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:01,859
They'll remember.

303
00:39:02,893 --> 00:39:05,260
One way or another,
they'll remember.

304
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:20,918
All right.

305
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:23,406
You don't want to get shot.

306
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:26,095
You don't want your shops
or houses burned.

307
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:30,129
You don't want your women touched.
You don't want anything to happen.

308
00:39:32,505 --> 00:39:34,708
Except you're afraid
to do anything about it.

309
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:38,901
Or you don't know how.

310
00:41:08,997 --> 00:41:10,590
Shit!

311
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:29,313
Fire!

312
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:04,027
I don't remember lending
my wagons to be shot up...

313
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:06,010
by those goddamned fools out there.

314
00:42:10,149 --> 00:42:13,018
You're gonna look awfully silly
with that knife sticking up your ass.

315
00:42:18,757 --> 00:42:21,986
Fire! Pull those triggers!
Come on!

316
00:42:31,985 --> 00:42:34,057
You still here?

317
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:37,965
No, I was just goin'.

318
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:54,125
- Damn! Can you do that every time?
- Damn right he can.

319
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:56,298
We're not gonna have a thing
in the world to worry about.

320
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:58,735
This is gonna be a picnic!

321
00:42:58,801 --> 00:43:01,037
All right, keep 'em after it, huh?

322
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:18,108
You men carpenters?

323
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,765
Sí, señor.
We do rough fixings.

324
00:43:20,836 --> 00:43:23,903
Could you make some big tables
that a lot of people could sit?

325
00:43:23,973 --> 00:43:26,242
- Like for a church picnic?
- Exactly.

326
00:43:27,717 --> 00:43:31,645
Well, you could use sawhorses
and one-by-twelvers.

327
00:43:31,717 --> 00:43:33,888
Could you have them ready
for me by tomorrow morning?

328
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:36,608
- If we have the lumber.
- You'll have the lumber.

329
00:43:36,676 --> 00:43:38,978
Come on with me.

330
00:43:39,172 --> 00:43:42,140
- You really plannin' a picnic?
- Any objection?

331
00:43:42,213 --> 00:43:44,449
No,just it's the damnedest thing
I ever heard of.

332
00:43:44,516 --> 00:43:46,523
- You haven't heard the funny part.
- What's that?

333
00:43:46,596 --> 00:43:49,214
You're furnishing
the beer and whiskey.

334
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:01,182
- Preacher.
- Good morning, Brother Belding.

335
00:44:01,252 --> 00:44:04,548
- Mrs. Lake was just asking about you.
- How is the dear old soul?

336
00:44:04,612 --> 00:44:07,263
She's chipper as a jaybird.
I don't know how she does it.

337
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:09,340
She's got the strength
of her faith, Brother Belding.

338
00:44:09,412 --> 00:44:11,463
Praise God.
The strength of her faith.

339
00:44:11,536 --> 00:44:13,675
Too bad about your barn.
Termites?

340
00:44:13,745 --> 00:44:16,395
There's nothing wrong with my barn.
It's sound as a dollar.

341
00:44:17,776 --> 00:44:20,198
How come those two Mexs
is tearin' it down?

342
00:44:20,272 --> 00:44:22,061
What?

343
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,241
What do you greasy bastards
think you're doing to my barn?

344
00:44:35,313 --> 00:44:37,255
Exactly what I told 'em.

345
00:44:37,328 --> 00:44:39,947
We're requisitioning
your barn, Belding.

346
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:43,784
Any objection?

347
00:44:45,873 --> 00:44:47,760
You men can go back to work.

348
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:53,416
Would you mind tellin' me
what the hell's goin' on here?

349
00:44:53,488 --> 00:44:55,757
You can help out too.

350
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,655
You want me to help you
tear down my barn?

351
00:45:01,328 --> 00:45:03,151
Wait a minute.

352
00:45:03,248 --> 00:45:05,256
Maybe he'd be better use
if he'd help us collect...

353
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:07,718
the few little items
we're still missing.

354
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,800
Items? What items?
What for?

355
00:45:09,872 --> 00:45:12,393
You got the list, Sheriff.
Read it to him.

356
00:45:14,704 --> 00:45:17,486
We still need 3 5 bedsheets...

357
00:45:17,552 --> 00:45:19,375
one barbecued steer...

358
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,861
and 200 gallons of red paint.

359
00:45:23,152 --> 00:45:24,810
Red paint?

360
00:45:24,881 --> 00:45:27,750
We're counting on you
for the bedsheets.

361
00:45:29,264 --> 00:45:31,174
- Is there anything else?
- Yes, there is.

362
00:45:31,249 --> 00:45:34,282
How long's it gonna take you
to get everybody out of your hotel?

363
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,542
- What?
- Everybody out.

364
00:45:38,608 --> 00:45:43,081
- How long is it gonna take?
- I just can't--

365
00:45:43,152 --> 00:45:45,770
I got eight people living in rooms
up there in my hotel.

366
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,229
Where are they gonna go?

367
00:45:49,552 --> 00:45:50,900
Out.

368
00:46:06,268 --> 00:46:08,886
You know better'n to walk
in a man's camp and--

369
00:46:10,364 --> 00:46:12,949
What the hell is goin' on?

370
00:47:00,252 --> 00:47:04,027
Well, Stacey, it looks like
we got three fresh horses.

371
00:47:04,124 --> 00:47:05,138
Wait a while.

372
00:47:08,157 --> 00:47:11,288
He's got him some snappy duds.

373
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:37,159
Faster!

374
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,535
Fire! Pull that trigger!

375
00:48:06,088 --> 00:48:09,122
- Any improvement?
- Some.

376
00:48:09,192 --> 00:48:12,487
Lew and I were thinking.
Maybe we were hasty in our decision.

377
00:48:12,552 --> 00:48:14,407
What do you mean?

378
00:48:14,472 --> 00:48:16,709
Maybe we don't need any outside help
to solve our problem.

379
00:48:16,776 --> 00:48:18,783
Hell, Dave, maybe we don't
even have a problem.

380
00:48:18,856 --> 00:48:21,027
Every man that ever got sent up...

381
00:48:21,096 --> 00:48:23,300
went away saying he'd come back
and get even, right?

382
00:48:23,368 --> 00:48:26,238
But can you actually remember anyone
ever comin' back and doin' anything?

383
00:48:26,312 --> 00:48:27,905
I can't think of one.
Can you?

384
00:48:27,976 --> 00:48:30,213
You want to get rid
of the gunfighter, is that it?

385
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,287
Dave, we've got to
before it's too late.

386
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,564
He's making a mock
of this whole town.

387
00:48:34,632 --> 00:48:36,966
Making that little dwarf
the sheriff.

388
00:48:37,032 --> 00:48:38,788
Kickin' my own people
out of my own hotel.

389
00:48:38,856 --> 00:48:41,703
Got half of the women in town
sewing bedsheets together.

390
00:48:41,768 --> 00:48:44,223
Got those Mexicans down there
building long picnic tables.

391
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,238
Lutie Naylor barbecuin'
a whole damn steer.

392
00:48:46,312 --> 00:48:49,924
- Some kind of a picnic.
- Right here in our own town.

393
00:48:49,992 --> 00:48:52,578
- Sounds pretty good to me.
- What do you mean?

394
00:48:52,648 --> 00:48:56,576
It sounds like a good idea
bringin' everything out in the open.

395
00:48:56,648 --> 00:48:58,655
This whole thing's
all for nothin'.

396
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:01,281
They're probably all three blind drunk
in some Nogales whorehouse.

397
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:03,840
Well, if they're dead drunk in Nogales,
we'll know in 2 4 hours.

398
00:49:03,912 --> 00:49:06,213
Surely we can put up
with the man for one more day.

399
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,752
No. He's got this whole town
so people are turnin' on each other.

400
00:49:12,404 --> 00:49:15,786
What's the matter, Morgan?
Anybody special turn on you?

401
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,263
- You want to spell that out, Drake?
- Spell it yourself.

402
00:49:21,332 --> 00:49:23,187
I'm not gonna jeopardize
everything I've built here...

403
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:25,227
because some blond bitch in heat
threw you out of bed.

404
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,886
- Don't talk to me that way!
- I'll talk to you any way I like!

405
00:49:27,956 --> 00:49:30,290
I'll say what I have to say
while I'm running this company.

406
00:49:30,356 --> 00:49:32,363
Say it, but you could listen
once in a while yourself!.

407
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,371
What's the matter? Not gettin'
your fair share of the profits?

408
00:49:35,444 --> 00:49:37,451
It's not the profits.

409
00:49:37,524 --> 00:49:39,531
This whole business
has gone sour...

410
00:49:39,604 --> 00:49:42,092
since that deal with that
former marshal, Duncan.

411
00:49:42,164 --> 00:49:45,775
We had no choice in that matter
and you know it.

412
00:49:45,844 --> 00:49:48,746
The big mistake was hiring
that man Duncan in the first place.

413
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,431
You did that all by yourself.
Quiet! Shut up.

414
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,322
We can trust one another.

415
00:49:55,316 --> 00:49:59,691
This whole town had a hand
in what happened.

416
00:50:01,716 --> 00:50:03,821
Why do you think Bridges
and the Carlin brothers...

417
00:50:03,892 --> 00:50:05,714
kept their mouths shut
all this time?

418
00:50:06,772 --> 00:50:09,106
Same reason everybody else did
in this town.

419
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,594
One hangs, we all hang.

420
00:50:13,684 --> 00:50:17,000
Now, you just grit your teeth
a little bit longer.

421
00:50:17,524 --> 00:50:20,338
The gunfighter stays
till I say otherwise. You understand?

422
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,053
There it is,just like he said.

423
00:50:31,124 --> 00:50:33,742
That stranger's got everybody
turnin' on everybody.

424
00:50:33,812 --> 00:50:36,463
Being put out
in the middle of the night!

425
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:38,320
That man!

426
00:50:39,124 --> 00:50:42,899
Right here. Folks, put your bags
right here in the wagon.

427
00:50:42,964 --> 00:50:46,193
All right, folks.
Just put your bags in the wagon.

428
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:50,091
- What's going on here?
- What the hell does it look like?

429
00:50:50,169 --> 00:50:52,215
They're emptying my whole hotel.

430
00:50:52,288 --> 00:50:54,295
Throwing out payin' guests,
right into the street...

431
00:50:54,368 --> 00:50:57,335
just to make room
for our new guardian angel.

432
00:50:58,304 --> 00:51:01,021
He likes to be by himself,
more or less.

433
00:51:01,823 --> 00:51:04,442
You can see
who's runnin' our town now.

434
00:51:05,696 --> 00:51:07,768
He's sitting right over there,
Mr. Belding.

435
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,465
If you don't like it...

436
00:51:09,536 --> 00:51:12,286
why don't you just go over there
and tell him he can't?

437
00:51:13,056 --> 00:51:15,161
Mordecai...

438
00:51:16,608 --> 00:51:19,772
someday soon someone's going to step
on your scrawny neck, you lizard.

439
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,109
When they do, you're going
to be nothing but--

440
00:51:22,176 --> 00:51:23,769
See here...

441
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,847
you can't turn all these people
out into the night.

442
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,441
It is inhuman, brother.
Inhuman!

443
00:51:31,648 --> 00:51:33,655
I'm not your brother.

444
00:51:33,728 --> 00:51:36,695
We are all brothers
in the eyes of God.

445
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,849
All these people,
are they your sisters and brothers?

446
00:51:43,264 --> 00:51:45,238
They most certainly are!

447
00:51:46,624 --> 00:51:49,973
Then you won't mind
if they stay at your place, will ya?

448
00:51:57,568 --> 00:51:59,607
All right, folks, let's go.
Put your bags here.

449
00:52:00,928 --> 00:52:03,546
Friends, don't worry.

450
00:52:03,616 --> 00:52:07,413
We shall find haven for you
in our own homes...

451
00:52:07,488 --> 00:52:10,390
and it won't cost you one cent more
than regular hotel rates.

452
00:52:17,184 --> 00:52:19,191
That's ridiculous.

453
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,567
- My room ready?
- Two connecting rooms.

454
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,741
The best in the hotel.

455
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:32,868
One for entertaining
your many new friends in town...

456
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,980
and one for sleeping...

457
00:52:35,052 --> 00:52:37,321
if your conscience lets you sleep.

458
00:52:38,092 --> 00:52:41,605
- I sleep just fine, ma'am.
- Is that so?

459
00:52:44,012 --> 00:52:46,019
You care to see for yourself?

460
00:52:56,204 --> 00:52:58,277
You tell Mrs. Belding
there'll be two for supper.

461
00:52:58,348 --> 00:53:00,682
I like chicken, fried.

462
00:53:02,827 --> 00:53:04,682
And anything else?

463
00:53:04,747 --> 00:53:07,617
Best bottle of wine in town.

464
00:53:09,932 --> 00:53:12,517
Remember: He won't be around
forever, you little--

465
00:54:42,263 --> 00:54:44,336
Marshal.

466
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,907
Help me, please.
Help me.

467
00:56:20,931 --> 00:56:23,866
- What are you doing?
- Let go! You've got to stop this!

468
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,849
Let go of me!

469
00:56:35,428 --> 00:56:38,014
Damn you all to hell.

470
00:58:03,218 --> 00:58:05,357
How did you get in here?

471
00:58:06,611 --> 00:58:08,618
You had your chance
and you missed it.

472
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:10,512
You're hurting me.
What do you want?

473
00:58:10,578 --> 00:58:14,026
Just a little pleasant
female company for supper.

474
00:58:14,098 --> 00:58:16,170
- You know what you are?
- What?

475
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:19,788
- You're an animal.
- You have a way of bringing that out.

476
00:58:19,858 --> 00:58:22,225
Thank you,
but I don't eat with dogs.

477
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,778
You might, if it's a dog
that runs the pack.

478
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:42,058
- Give me half an hour to get ready.
- You're ready right now.

479
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:45,199
I could be readier.

480
00:58:47,826 --> 00:58:49,517
Half an hour.

481
00:59:00,946 --> 00:59:04,394
You know, actually,
I eat like a bird.

482
00:59:05,106 --> 00:59:07,179
I've got it!

483
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:10,756
I knew that old bastard Hobart
had it in a hole under the store.

484
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,945
- Look. But I got it.
- Yeah, all the way from France.

485
00:59:14,014 --> 00:59:17,243
Stick a bent knife in that,
get the cork out.

486
00:59:18,174 --> 00:59:20,760
Do you have any special request
for dessert?

487
00:59:22,366 --> 00:59:25,497
No, I've already
taken care of that.

488
00:59:39,294 --> 00:59:43,156
Can't fix that without a blacksmith
or a vet. Maybe both.

489
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:46,132
It'll be hell
findin' either one out here.

490
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:48,507
I'll tell you something, Stace.

491
00:59:48,574 --> 00:59:50,745
I think we've been pushin' too hard.

492
00:59:50,814 --> 00:59:54,130
Like as not, all three of these horses
could have come up lame.

493
00:59:54,206 --> 00:59:58,036
I feel pretty lame myself, not being
on a horse 1 2 months in that jail.

494
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:01,558
Back off, Cole. Maybe we ought
to leave you and the horse here.

495
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:04,760
Now, Stace,
I didn't mean nothin'.

496
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:08,507
He can ride double with me
until we come across somebody.

497
01:00:08,574 --> 01:00:13,211
- We'll all need fresh animals.
- All right! But quit cryin' about it.

498
01:00:20,766 --> 01:00:22,904
I'll tell you what, though.

499
01:00:22,974 --> 01:00:24,982
Soon as they find those bodies...

500
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:27,061
they're going to have
a huntin' party out for us.

501
01:00:28,094 --> 01:00:31,639
And I want time to take one year
of my life out of Lago...

502
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:33,466
before we move on.

503
01:00:33,534 --> 01:00:35,444
How long is that going
to take, you figure?

504
01:00:36,286 --> 01:00:38,042
A lifetime...

505
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:39,768
for some of'em.

506
01:01:17,866 --> 01:01:19,971
You're out late, Mordecai.

507
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:42,625
Fornication and sins of the flesh.

508
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:45,830
That's what's going on under my roof
right now while I'm talking to you.

509
01:01:45,898 --> 01:01:47,970
That stranger
has taken over my hotel...

510
01:01:48,074 --> 01:01:51,619
and thrown good, honest,
decent folk out into the night.

511
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:54,822
Why didn't you stop him, Lewis?
You've got a gun.

512
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:57,061
Shut your fat mouth, Sam.

513
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,552
We're tired of giving you money
for doing an incompetent job.

514
01:01:59,626 --> 01:02:01,993
- Don't you talk to me that way!
- Gentlemen!

515
01:02:02,057 --> 01:02:04,359
Please! Look at us!

516
01:02:04,426 --> 01:02:06,881
Sweet God,
look what's happening to us!

517
01:02:06,953 --> 01:02:08,742
Right, it's just like
the preacher says.

518
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,396
That stranger's got everybody
at each other's throats.

519
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:13,189
He's set himself up like a king.

520
01:02:13,258 --> 01:02:17,120
He's got you all snake-fascinated,
every damn one of you.

521
01:02:17,194 --> 01:02:20,904
This crazy picnic.
Two hundred gallons of blood-red paint.

522
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:24,286
It couldn't be worse if the devil
himself had ridden into Lago.

523
01:04:32,226 --> 01:04:34,975
Welcome to Lago,
you son of a bitch.

524
01:04:44,737 --> 01:04:46,493
Get out of here!

525
01:04:54,562 --> 01:04:56,252
God, what was that?

526
01:04:56,322 --> 01:04:58,176
I'm sorry.

527
01:05:20,098 --> 01:05:22,269
Morg!

528
01:05:24,674 --> 01:05:28,219
Where are you going?
Morg? Take me with you!

529
01:05:31,042 --> 01:05:33,114
You better take me with you!

530
01:05:33,186 --> 01:05:36,983
Where are you going?
Don't leave me here!

531
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:39,130
He'll kill me!

532
01:05:55,662 --> 01:05:58,117
Oh, no!

533
01:06:12,878 --> 01:06:15,747
My beautiful hotel.
They promised me they wouldn't--

534
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:38,984
Ruined.

535
01:06:39,566 --> 01:06:41,355
A total loss.

536
01:06:41,422 --> 01:06:43,658
Didn't even touch my store.

537
01:06:44,589 --> 01:06:48,102
I want you to watch that pilfering.
I hold you responsible, Sheriff.

538
01:06:48,206 --> 01:06:50,213
I'm not your goddamn sheriff.

539
01:06:51,917 --> 01:06:54,601
I'll need one, two--
two up there.

540
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:56,361
I'll need four boxes from you...

541
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:59,147
and shovels from you,
so these people can dig the holes.

542
01:06:59,214 --> 01:07:02,596
Well, I thought perhaps we could--

543
01:07:02,669 --> 01:07:06,760
- Right now!
- Yeah. All right, everyone.

544
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,500
Was you here?
Did you see anything?

545
01:07:10,574 --> 01:07:13,127
Somebody left the door open
and the wrong dogs came home.

546
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:19,333
Get the shovel, will ya?

547
01:07:24,174 --> 01:07:28,996
I hope you're not going to blame us
for Morgan Allen's stupidity...

548
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:33,140
because the rest of us here
have an agreement with you.

549
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:36,439
Right now I don't feel
too agreeable.

550
01:07:36,506 --> 01:07:41,295
Well, maybe a little bonus will
make you a little more appreciative.

551
01:07:42,618 --> 01:07:45,782
- How little?
- Five hundred a head.

552
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:48,217
Five hundred an ear?

553
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:51,028
Done, done.

554
01:08:02,618 --> 01:08:04,625
$3,000?

555
01:08:04,698 --> 01:08:06,803
You promised
that son of a bitch $3,000...

556
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:08,881
after what he did to my hotel?

557
01:08:08,953 --> 01:08:11,888
Promising's one thing.
Paying's another.

558
01:08:12,345 --> 01:08:14,320
He may just catch a bullet.

559
01:08:18,905 --> 01:08:21,622
You and Lewis
can grab shovels too.

560
01:08:23,097 --> 01:08:27,799
I knew you were cruel,
but I didn't know how far you could go.

561
01:08:27,865 --> 01:08:30,102
You still don't.

562
01:08:32,665 --> 01:08:36,277
It doesn't matter to you.

563
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:39,280
I don't know where you're going
to sleep now. Bodies everywhere.

564
01:08:39,354 --> 01:08:42,005
All the rooms are ruined
except for our room.

565
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:55,857
Wait. Wait a minute.

566
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:58,639
Oh, no!

567
01:09:01,817 --> 01:09:04,719
Let go! Let go! Lewis!

568
01:09:04,793 --> 01:09:07,030
Lewis, don't just stand there.

569
01:09:07,098 --> 01:09:09,269
Let go of me!

570
01:09:11,424 --> 01:09:14,626
Stop! Look, you don't need me.
Let go!

571
01:09:18,693 --> 01:09:21,541
Let go of me!

572
01:09:26,757 --> 01:09:29,790
- What are you going to do with those?
- Defend myself.

573
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:31,650
Against what?

574
01:09:31,717 --> 01:09:34,467
It's no secret what you did
to Callie Travers.

575
01:09:34,533 --> 01:09:37,795
- Did?
- The other day in the stable.

576
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:43,108
As I recall,
she enjoyed that quite a bit.

577
01:09:43,173 --> 01:09:45,344
I promise you, I won't.

578
01:09:46,053 --> 01:09:50,810
- You flatter yourself, lady.
- I flatter myself?

579
01:09:51,877 --> 01:09:55,772
I'd love to oblige you, but a man's
got to get his rest sometime.

580
01:09:57,637 --> 01:09:59,841
Oblige me?

581
01:09:59,909 --> 01:10:03,138
But if you come back
in about a half hour...

582
01:10:03,237 --> 01:10:05,179
I'll see what I can do,
all right?

583
01:10:05,253 --> 01:10:09,476
Why, you low-down,
stinking, son of a--

584
01:10:38,277 --> 01:10:41,092
Have you ever heard the name
Jim Duncan?

585
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:44,412
I've heard a lot of things. Why?

586
01:10:45,254 --> 01:10:47,909
He was town marshal here.

587
01:10:47,909 --> 01:10:50,578
He's lying out there
in an unmarked grave.

588
01:10:51,533 --> 01:10:55,465
They say the dead don't rest
without a marker of some kind.

589
01:10:56,433 --> 01:10:58,735
Do you believe that?

590
01:10:59,954 --> 01:11:02,987
- What makes you think I care?
- I don't know.

591
01:11:03,761 --> 01:11:07,307
He's the reason this town's
afraid of strangers.

592
01:11:07,377 --> 01:11:10,411
I was going to warn you
about that. Pretty funny.

593
01:11:13,554 --> 01:11:15,376
What's funny?

594
01:11:15,761 --> 01:11:18,128
You ask me that
in a blown-up hotel...

595
01:11:18,194 --> 01:11:21,193
with seven dead men
to your credit already?

596
01:11:21,457 --> 01:11:24,424
I was just stopping by
for a bottle of whiskey...

597
01:11:24,497 --> 01:11:26,985
and a nice hot bath.

598
01:11:27,729 --> 01:11:30,511
All right. If you say so.

599
01:11:31,505 --> 01:11:33,709
You don't believe me?

600
01:11:36,977 --> 01:11:40,043
Mister, whatever you say
is fine with me.

601
01:11:47,185 --> 01:11:48,592
Be careful.

602
01:11:51,794 --> 01:11:54,576
You're a man who makes people afraid,
and that's dangerous.

603
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:58,796
It's what people know
about themselves inside...

604
01:11:58,865 --> 01:12:00,840
that makes them afraid.

605
01:12:12,766 --> 01:12:16,443
I don't know if we shouldn't
mark the grave somehow.

606
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:18,365
Sam?

607
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:20,285
I don't see any need.

608
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:23,798
Ain't likely anybody's
gonna cry over 'em anyhow.

609
01:12:38,826 --> 01:12:40,833
You know what to do.

610
01:12:40,906 --> 01:12:43,175
Yes, sir, captain.

611
01:12:44,617 --> 01:12:46,789
All right.

612
01:12:46,858 --> 01:12:50,174
Everybody grab a brush
and start in.

613
01:12:51,818 --> 01:12:54,469
You mean, you want
the whole place painted?

614
01:12:54,538 --> 01:12:58,400
- Everything.
- You can't possibly mean the church.

615
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,612
I mean especially the church.

616
01:13:02,474 --> 01:13:05,321
All right. I'll paint
if you say we've got to...

617
01:13:05,385 --> 01:13:07,807
but when we get done,
this place is gonna look like hell.

618
01:13:35,913 --> 01:13:38,150
Hello, Lewis.

619
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:54,788
I want you to go to that meeting
with me, Sarah. It's very important.

620
01:13:54,857 --> 01:13:56,384
No.

621
01:13:57,513 --> 01:13:59,847
Not now, not ever.

622
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:02,313
They are still your neighbors!

623
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:05,248
Yes, they're my neighbors,
and they make me sick.

624
01:14:05,321 --> 01:14:08,933
Hiding behind words
like faith, peace and trust.

625
01:14:09,001 --> 01:14:11,170
Good words.
Damn good words.

626
01:14:11,241 --> 01:14:15,115
- But we hid a murder behind them.
- Will you never understand, woman?

627
01:14:15,189 --> 01:14:17,360
That wasn't anything
we wanted to do.

628
01:14:17,429 --> 01:14:19,698
When Duncan found out the mine
was on government property...

629
01:14:19,765 --> 01:14:23,595
it was just a technicality, really,
but he was determined to turn us in.

630
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:25,677
Wouldn't listen to reason.

631
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:27,822
Is that why?

632
01:14:27,893 --> 01:14:31,822
- Is that really why it happened?
- Don't you see, Sarah?

633
01:14:31,893 --> 01:14:33,682
They would have closed down
the mine.

634
01:14:33,749 --> 01:14:35,822
Do you know what would've
happened to this town then?

635
01:14:35,894 --> 01:14:38,261
It would've been the end
of everything we've worked on.

636
01:14:38,326 --> 01:14:42,068
All of it, all of us.
And you too, wife.

637
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:48,786
Sometimes we have to do
what's necessary to do...

638
01:14:48,853 --> 01:14:50,860
for the good of everybody.

639
01:14:50,933 --> 01:14:55,570
- That's the price of progress.
- And what's the price of a human life?

640
01:14:55,637 --> 01:14:58,059
Ask your good friends
if they know that.

641
01:15:00,565 --> 01:15:02,670
Your damn conscience.

642
01:15:03,349 --> 01:15:06,131
It's sure taken a hell of a while
to bother you.

643
01:15:07,734 --> 01:15:10,101
I'm packing to leave, Lewis.

644
01:15:10,165 --> 01:15:12,401
I won't be coming back.

645
01:16:05,601 --> 01:16:08,667
That's Morg Allen,
or what's left of him.

646
01:16:08,737 --> 01:16:11,737
Well, now, what's he doing
ridin' around like that?

647
01:16:11,809 --> 01:16:15,551
He's come back to pay us back for some
jail time that was rightfully his...

648
01:16:15,649 --> 01:16:17,624
only he don't know it yet.

649
01:16:35,938 --> 01:16:38,109
Stacey, help me.

650
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:41,375
My arm. Help me.

651
01:16:45,794 --> 01:16:47,648
Help me, Stacey.

652
01:16:50,369 --> 01:16:52,125
I'm curious, Morg.

653
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:55,800
You helped them railroad us,
and then you've got the balls...

654
01:16:55,873 --> 01:16:58,328
to come down here
and ask us for a favor?

655
01:16:58,401 --> 01:17:01,784
Goddamn if I don't admire you.

656
01:17:01,858 --> 01:17:04,443
Do something about my arm, Stacey.

657
01:17:04,513 --> 01:17:06,750
I am doing something, Morg.

658
01:17:06,818 --> 01:17:09,403
I'm sitting here watching you
bleed to death.

659
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:15,297
Things have changed in Lago.

660
01:17:16,673 --> 01:17:18,713
You need me.

661
01:17:19,298 --> 01:17:21,753
I gotta tell you about it.

662
01:17:25,377 --> 01:17:27,384
From the looks
of your arm, Morg...

663
01:17:27,457 --> 01:17:30,672
you've run your welcome out
in Lago, and ours too.

664
01:17:31,394 --> 01:17:34,504
The boys want to know how
we're gonna get 1 2 months' back pay...

665
01:17:34,573 --> 01:17:36,461
and everything else that's owed us?

666
01:17:36,525 --> 01:17:40,486
- Stacey, for God's sake.
- No. For our sake.

667
01:17:40,558 --> 01:17:42,696
You can help us,
and you can help yourself too.

668
01:17:42,765 --> 01:17:47,522
Just give me the combination
to that big iron box in your office...

669
01:17:47,597 --> 01:17:51,972
and me and the boys
will sneak in there...

670
01:17:52,045 --> 01:17:54,052
real quiet like,
take what's ours...

671
01:17:54,125 --> 01:17:57,420
bring you the rest,
or leave it there safe and sound.

672
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:01,675
First, of course,
we'll fix up your arm...

673
01:18:01,741 --> 01:18:03,813
and set you over there
in the shade...

674
01:18:03,885 --> 01:18:05,740
with a nice canteen
full of water.

675
01:18:06,573 --> 01:18:09,290
You no-good,
worthless son of a bitch.

676
01:18:09,357 --> 01:18:11,561
You're probably right about that.

677
01:18:15,022 --> 01:18:17,061
Give me that combination, Morg.

678
01:18:17,133 --> 01:18:19,522
I wouldn't give you the combination
to the gates of hell.

679
01:18:28,941 --> 01:18:30,981
Dog!

680
01:18:31,053 --> 01:18:33,606
Sure had a lot of blood
left in him, didn't he?

681
01:18:42,605 --> 01:18:44,972
Two sticks of dynamite
will take care of that iron box anyway.

682
01:18:45,037 --> 01:18:47,338
We don't need him.

683
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:06,148
- Dan, you hit?
- I don't know.

684
01:19:06,862 --> 01:19:10,450
I don't think so.
Damn near tore my leg off!.

685
01:19:15,609 --> 01:19:19,602
- Who the hell is that?
- Must be Dave Drake.

686
01:19:22,201 --> 01:19:24,209
What the hell did you hit?

687
01:19:42,617 --> 01:19:45,487
- Keep shooting, damn it!
- He shot my ear off!.

688
01:19:46,201 --> 01:19:49,300
- Somebody up there's playing games.
- He shot my ear off!.

689
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:56,016
He could've shot your damn head off!.
Now get down!

690
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:01,233
Dave, is that you?

691
01:20:06,169 --> 01:20:08,373
Come on out!
We'll settle this.

692
01:20:17,017 --> 01:20:20,181
Morg was almost dead anyway
from that arm!

693
01:20:21,145 --> 01:20:23,316
I just put him out of his misery!

694
01:20:40,537 --> 01:20:42,359
I'll kill you!

695
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:46,102
You son of a bitch,
I'll kill you!

696
01:20:47,097 --> 01:20:51,407
Come down out of there, you bastard!
I'll cut your heart out!

697
01:20:51,483 --> 01:20:54,176
Don't go up there.
There might be more dynamite.

698
01:20:54,629 --> 01:20:57,563
I'll kill him,
whoever it was up there.

699
01:20:58,693 --> 01:21:00,766
I'll kill every man in Lago!

700
01:21:41,829 --> 01:21:44,829
The guests are on their way to the
party. Gather all the people together.

701
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:47,900
Right, captain!
All right, men, get that sign up!

702
01:21:55,909 --> 01:21:58,178
Come on!
They're coming!

703
01:22:09,061 --> 01:22:11,963
All right, everybody,
get a little move on!

704
01:22:22,692 --> 01:22:26,009
I want you up in that tower.
First sign of dust, you ring the bell.

705
01:22:26,085 --> 01:22:28,092
Are you sure
this is gonna be all right?

706
01:22:28,165 --> 01:22:30,209
It's gonna be all right.

707
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:37,645
He's back! He's here!
It's time to get ready.

708
01:22:39,408 --> 01:22:43,183
What's the matter with everybody?
Wait'll we gun 'em down.

709
01:22:46,257 --> 01:22:50,447
All right, everybody,
I think we're expected outside.

710
01:22:50,513 --> 01:22:52,935
I just hope that shooter we hired
is feelin' up to snuff.

711
01:22:53,009 --> 01:22:55,398
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

712
01:23:01,073 --> 01:23:02,447
Let's go.

713
01:23:53,265 --> 01:23:55,654
Señor, can we come to the fiesta?

714
01:23:55,729 --> 01:23:57,387
No.

715
01:23:59,665 --> 01:24:01,934
I want everybody
to have plenty of those.

716
01:24:15,901 --> 01:24:19,196
Ain't it about time
we got out there, huh?

717
01:24:21,116 --> 01:24:23,124
There's plenty of time.

718
01:24:23,197 --> 01:24:25,269
But they'll be here
any damn minute.

719
01:24:25,341 --> 01:24:27,861
I think Sam's right. We ought to.

720
01:24:28,477 --> 01:24:30,452
What about after?

721
01:24:31,837 --> 01:24:34,422
What about after we do it?

722
01:24:34,493 --> 01:24:36,827
What do we do then?

723
01:24:37,469 --> 01:24:39,444
Then you live with it.

724
01:24:52,733 --> 01:24:56,082
Where you gonna be?
Are you gonna take the first shot?

725
01:24:57,917 --> 01:24:59,957
Are you gonna get
Stacey Bridges first?

726
01:25:00,029 --> 01:25:02,712
Or maybe you're gonna get
all three by yourself?

727
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:13,398
- When are you gonna give the signal?
- I'm not.

728
01:25:13,469 --> 01:25:15,257
You are.

729
01:25:25,532 --> 01:25:28,631
You old people, move outta here!

730
01:25:41,277 --> 01:25:43,349
Here they come!

731
01:27:55,964 --> 01:27:57,306
Fire!

732
01:27:58,781 --> 01:28:01,148
Fire! Fire!

733
01:28:30,876 --> 01:28:32,818
Get 'em!

734
01:29:18,024 --> 01:29:19,912
Don't shoot!

735
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:27,262
A party?

736
01:29:36,233 --> 01:29:38,240
Welcome-home party, huh?

737
01:29:43,113 --> 01:29:46,888
Well, here's to your party.

738
01:29:55,272 --> 01:29:57,661
Give me another bottle.

739
01:30:00,393 --> 01:30:02,597
Give me another bottle!

740
01:30:15,272 --> 01:30:18,404
- Well, now the party's over.
- Let go of me!

741
01:30:18,473 --> 01:30:20,480
Look what I found
in the bushes!

742
01:30:27,688 --> 01:30:30,470
Stacey, it was always you.

743
01:30:32,169 --> 01:30:34,340
That's why Morg Allen hated you.

744
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,822
He knew how much I loved you.

745
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,840
Yeah, I bet you just cried yourself
to sleep every night...

746
01:30:43,912 --> 01:30:48,102
thinking about me
in that territorial prison.

747
01:30:48,745 --> 01:30:52,236
But I did. I really did!

748
01:30:52,308 --> 01:30:55,210
Yeah, well,
I can see it all now.

749
01:30:55,284 --> 01:30:57,772
You lying there
in Morg Allen's bed...

750
01:30:57,844 --> 01:31:00,713
just a-cryin' and a-humpin'.

751
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:03,123
Oh, no!

752
01:31:03,189 --> 01:31:05,229
Give me that bottle.

753
01:31:10,036 --> 01:31:13,331
- Cole, go and get the horses ready.
- You got it, Stace.

754
01:31:16,308 --> 01:31:18,796
You're going to take me
with you, aren't you?

755
01:31:20,084 --> 01:31:22,931
I can do better than you
in a four-bit fancy house.

756
01:31:27,092 --> 01:31:30,441
- You still here?
- Goddamn right I'm still here!

757
01:31:30,517 --> 01:31:33,680
I wanna know who them sons of bitches
was that ambushed us.

758
01:31:35,732 --> 01:31:38,481
That's what we're gonna
find out right now.

759
01:31:50,164 --> 01:31:52,204
Who are you?

760
01:32:01,588 --> 01:32:03,498
Don't hit me!

761
01:32:07,092 --> 01:32:08,947
Don't hit me, please!

762
01:32:38,912 --> 01:32:41,367
Come on, Stacey.
Let's get outta here.

763
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,164
Shut up!

764
01:32:50,497 --> 01:32:52,406
Everybody out.

765
01:32:52,896 --> 01:32:54,969
Everybody out!

766
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,863
- Out!
- Move!

767
01:32:56,928 --> 01:32:58,968
Go on. Get out!

768
01:33:11,488 --> 01:33:13,627
Hurry up in there. Move!

769
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,513
- Get in there.
- Hold it right there!

770
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:39,670
Dynamite!

771
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,509
Stacey, the goddamn horses
are gone!

772
01:34:06,656 --> 01:34:09,274
