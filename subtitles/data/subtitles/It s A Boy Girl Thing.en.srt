00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,240
In smalltowns
you take what you can get-

2
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:18,829
-whether you like it or not.
Your options are limited.

3
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:23,625
That's why many think life
is less complicated in small towns.

4
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,794
They are wrong.

5
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,881
There are always choices to be made.

6
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,301
Make the wrong one,
and you're in trouble.

7
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,960
Is something wrong?

8
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,297
No, no, no...

9
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,796
Help!

10
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:42,157
-Can't you stay?
-I don't have time.

11
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,994
I have to get home to Gunnar.
Magnus is leaving soon.

12
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,248
-Hasn't he lef tyet?
-I don't think so.

13
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:53,919
-And you're here?
-Yeah...

14
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:57,881
-You could have waited until he'd left.
-What for?

15
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,468
I couldn't stay there any longer.

16
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:07,766
He keeps getting more distant.
I think you should talk to him.

17
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:12,563
-Why? He's your husband.
-He's your friend.

18
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,097
Tuva?

19
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:34,645
Did you know that worms are
hermaphrodites? But they like sex-

20
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,148
-so they find themselves
partners anyway.

21
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:43,946
After I get that sorter, I can
produce ten million worms a year.

22
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:48,951
At one krone per worm,
that makes ten million kroner!

23
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:58,544
Even at 50 øre per worm,
I'd still net five million. Not bad.

24
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:05,217
I'm taking over the farm.
Mom and Odvar are moving out.

25
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:10,305
Why would I want a farm
all to myself?

26
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,561
Tuva, I want you to move in with me.

27
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,404
-You're kidding, right?
-No...

28
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:32,160
Have you forgotten
that I'm married and have a kid?

29
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:36,665
Magnus isn't exactly
fulfilling his marital duties.

30
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,962
-What do you know about that?
-A little.

31
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:47,176
Then why are we sleeping together?

32
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,932
For the sex. I thought that you
as a man would understand that.

33
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:57,269
Is that all it is?

34
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:04,026
-Do you love me, Jonny?
-Of course! Don't you love me?

35
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:10,616
-Sure. But I love Magnus, too.
-So do I.

36
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,690
Put it on my tab.

37
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,659
-She's hot and ready.
-As always.

38
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:06,106
Do you think you'll make any money
doing that?

39
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,506
Do you call that work,
digging around in crap?

40
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,675
I won't be doing the digging.
Look at this...

41
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:40,682
This is an industry.
My sorter will be here in a few days.

42
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,436
-Hi, Jonny.
-Hi, mom.

43
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:49,733
Odvar, come look at the curtains
for our new house.

44
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,662
She buys curtains, you collect worms,
and no one helps me.

45
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:25,037
Chop suey...

46
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,834
We might as well sell the fridge.
There's nothing I like.

47
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:35,422
Yes, and we can fill the cupboard
with canned meatballs instead.

48
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:40,093
I just want normal food for a change.
Is that asking too much?

49
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,848
Do you know what I want?

50
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:49,686
I want a miracle.
I want a bunch of miracles.

51
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:56,276
I want you to change.
I want to start over when we move.

52
00:12:56,443 --> 00:13:02,533
I want to be a better cook.
I want you to stop being so grumpy.

53
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:07,287
I want the sun to shine.
I want a new car and new boobs...

54
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,666
For God's sake...

55
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:16,296
No. No... No!

56
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:21,009
There are worse things in life
than a bump on the head.

57
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:25,806
-Like chopping yourself in the arm?
-Perhaps.

58
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:29,309
That was your own fault.
This is random violence!

59
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,479
Maybe not.
It may have been carefully planned.

60
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:36,692
Then you have to find
whoever did this.

61
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:42,155
I chopped myself in the arm.The long
arm of the law needs a bandage-

62
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:47,828
-and a tetanus shot.
I'll be on sickleave for a while.

63
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,652
You have a concussion.

64
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:26,325
-How did this happen?
-A work accident.

65
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,828
I see...

66
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,125
There now...

67
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:40,631
Try to relax for a couple of days.
Don't overexert yourself.

68
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,510
This is my first day.
Is it always this busy here?

69
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,138
I'll make sure
you have enough business.

70
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:22,714
Hey, Jonny. Did you hurt yourself?

71
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:28,136
-That doesn't look good.
-What happened?

72
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,976
You look great, Jonny.

73
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:38,272
If this doesn't get you some pussy,
nothing will.

74
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:05,674
Jesus... Did you hurt yourself?

75
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,802
-Shouldn't you be at work?
-Yeah, but...

76
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,099
What are you doing here?

77
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:19,521
-What's happened to you?
-Someone hit me with a shovel.

78
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:23,901
Come on in, Jonny.
Tell me what happened.

79
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:32,910
-Aren't you going to work?
-I quit. I'll put on some coffee.

80
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:41,460
I was working on my worms,
when someone hit me in the head.

81
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:45,380
I spun around, and after that
I don't remember anything.

82
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:51,011
Who the hell goes around
hitting people?

83
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:54,556
You can take off
your helmet now, Jonny.

84
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:03,065
-Does it hurt?
-Of course! What do you think?

85
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:17,996
-Did you quit your job?
-Yeah.

86
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:23,502
-So you've been home all day?
-Well, no...

87
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:30,551
You are one brave man.

88
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,804
-Are you kidding?
-No.

89
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:40,060
-Why do you look so surprised?
-Why would I do that to you?

90
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:45,858
-What makes you think that, Jonny?
-Maybe it was you?

91
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,405
Hey...

92
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:03,959
I've got to go.
The doctor told me to rest.

93
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:16,513
Why did you quit?

94
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,227
Did she end it, or did you?
Or did it just get old?

95
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:28,233
-No...That's not what this is about.
-What's the matter, then?

96
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,627
I've been looking for that.

97
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:50,255
-Where are you going with it?
-I need it.

98
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:54,551
-What for?
-It's evidence.

99
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,095
Fingerprints.

100
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:00,224
Get in the tractor and help me.

101
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,435
I can't. I have a concussion.

102
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:07,356
-So you can't drive a tractor?
-Nope.

103
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:43,892
-Can't you help your dad?
-He's not my dad. Help him yourself.

104
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:49,940
-I can't drive a tractor.
-I guess you'll have to learn.

105
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,046
Fingerprints.

106
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:21,180
Jonny, don't take it the wrong way
if I don't do everything you ask of me-

107
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:26,226
-but we have to
be careful about this.

108
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:32,608
This is a fragile community.
Whoever did this-

109
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:37,905
-must have felt he had a good reason.

110
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:44,203
People don't become violent overnight.
Think it through.

111
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:48,832
It's like with medicine.
We cure the disease-

112
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:52,836
-not the symptoms. Got it?

113
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:58,342
You need to get
to the bottom of this yourself.

114
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,263
Good man. I'll help you.

115
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:10,938
Did somebody drop a bomb
on your head, Jonny?

116
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:15,234
-Can I get a beer?
-You owe me money.

117
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,153
I owe everybody money.
Can I get a beer?

118
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,533
Please?

119
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:40,342
Hi. I'm Helene. I'm new here.

120
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,803
I can see that.

121
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:49,685
If you just hurt yourself, it's not
such a good idea to drink alcohol.

122
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:57,734
First you get dizzy from the injury,
and then you get dizzy from drinking.

123
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:04,158
-What's your name?
-Jonny.

124
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,161
-Who hit you, Jonny?
-I don't know.

125
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:13,584
Just forget about it, and pretend like
nothing happened. Otherwise they win.

126
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,089
Act like nothing ever happened. That's
what I do when people are mean.

127
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:47,993
Mom!

128
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,829
Mom!

129
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:28,325
He's been there all day.
He's leaving. I knew it.

130
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:33,288
He's been acting so strange lately.

131
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:39,753
Is he going on vacation?

132
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:44,758
Can't you talk to him?
He won't listen to me.

133
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,823
Going far?

134
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,535
For God's sake, Jonny.
Be a man, for a change!

135
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:15,414
Carry him inside or knock him down.
Just do something!

136
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:29,803
There you are.
We were just talking about you.

137
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:36,643
I hear worm farming
can be a tough business, Jonny.

138
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,147
I'm all right.

139
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:44,860
As you may have heard,
we have discussed your case.

140
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:49,656
Amundsen, our chairman,
wanted to talk to you.

141
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:53,076
We're not in the business of charity.

142
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:57,664
The problem is that you can't use
the farm as collateral.

143
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:01,585
It's already heavily mortgaged.

144
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:07,466
Perhaps we could offer you
some kind of investment loan.

145
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:12,554
But then we'd be talking about
different numbers.

146
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:15,265
Do you have any customers?

147
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:18,185
Yes. Several.

148
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:34,493
These are order sheets.

149
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:41,959
The project is almost fully funded
through these orders from anglers.

150
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:48,257
In addition,we have
the production of compost worms.

151
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:54,513
This Newsweek article reveals
how huge this market could be.

152
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,350
This is an emerging trend.

153
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:02,729
People compost foodwaste
in containers under their sinks.

154
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:08,819
They need worms for that.

155
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:17,119
My worms speed up the process.

156
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:25,002
I also plan to import the necessary
equipment for home composting.

157
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:28,964
From America.

158
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:36,180
All I need help with right now
is distribution.

159
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,682
A car.

160
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:44,104
When will I get the money?

161
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:47,524
We'll hold off on the loan for a while-

162
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:53,030
-but I've arranged for a line of credit
in the amount of 40,000 kroner.

163
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:57,743
-That's all I could do at the moment.
-Fair enough.

164
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:02,456
-I'll go home and get things started.
-Go to it!

165
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,304
How's the sun today, Uffe?

166
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,143
Are you interested in a job?

167
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,275
Come by tomorrow if you are.

168
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:36,573
Since it's you, you can have it
for more than it's worth.

169
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:47,835
-How much?
-Considering how much you owe me...

170
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,005
-and the fact that you're
completely unreliable... 60,000.

171
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,800
-Jerk!
-Business is business.

172
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:59,596
-I'm not doing charitywork here.
-I've heard that one before.

173
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:03,058
This is a great chance
to pay off your debt.

174
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:45,934
Do you like her? She's for sale.

175
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:50,063
How much will you give me for her?

176
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,610
50,000?
I guarantee she's in excellent condition.

177
00:28:54,776 --> 00:29:01,408
-What's the going rate?
-50,000 is an excellent price.

178
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:06,163
45,000, and I'll handle the paperwork.

179
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:10,042
40,000.

180
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:17,466
All right. You should listen
to your heart when buying a car.

181
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,028
Hi, Tuva. What?

182
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:42,157
Listen.

183
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:50,833
Can you hear that? What?

184
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,752
I'm on my way.

185
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,011
I'm pregnant.

186
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:09,476
I'm pregnant, and you're the father.

187
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,736
Are you sure?

188
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:24,867
500% sure.

189
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:32,374
It'll be good for Gunnar
to have someone to grow up with.

190
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:35,919
He shouldn't just play with rabbits.

191
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:38,630
Are you going to keep it?

192
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:47,931
-What about Magnus?
-What about him?

193
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:53,312
All he does is take walks all day long!

194
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:27,012
Shit!

195
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:49,034
Hey!

196
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,866
Another work accident?

197
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:32,119
Yes.

198
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:34,830
What business are you in, anyway?

199
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:37,583
I'm a worm farmer.

200
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:39,209
Worms.

201
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:43,297
So worms can both hit and shoot?

202
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:51,388
Did you know that worms only have
half as many genes as humans?

203
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:58,478
The worm is underrated.
It's the ideal creature.

204
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:03,775
All it does is eat, shit and reproduce-

205
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:09,364
-without making a fuss. It's simple.

206
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,160
If you cut a worm in two-

207
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:19,082
-each half goes on living
that same careless life.

208
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:24,213
God, I wish I were a worm right now!

209
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:31,512
Any more?

210
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,732
He'll come back in when he gets tired.

211
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,368
It's his handwriting.
I've tried calling. No answer.

212
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:42,958
-The County Council?
-It's just a bad cover for his mistress.

213
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:47,337
Odvar has a mistress?

214
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:49,506
I have to use the bathroom.

215
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:10,486
Did he leave?
Why didn't you do anything?

216
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:16,241
-Did you see who it was?
-The County Council?

217
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:20,579
Not the Duett!

218
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:24,833
Mom!

219
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:32,419
Your mom's fine, Jonny.
She never did like that turn.

220
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:36,882
-Have you arrested her?
-No. Are you crazy?

221
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:41,887
She's in the hospital.
It's not serious. Just a broken leg.

222
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:45,599
We'll take the scrap deposit
as a down payment on your debt.

223
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:50,020
-That sounds like a good deal.
-I want to fix it.

224
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:54,441
Look at me, Jonny.
What are you doing?

225
00:37:54,608 --> 00:38:01,031
Can't you do something right for
a change? This stupid car, for instance.

226
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:03,784
You run a worm farm,
not a car museum.

227
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:07,162
And you're a cop, not my dad!
Do your job.

228
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:10,624
This is what you should worry about.

229
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:15,003
Look at this. Who the hell
goes around shooting people?

230
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:21,385
-Is that from an air gun?
-Just forget it.

231
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:21,505
Hello?

232
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,977
Hello...

233
00:42:01,063 --> 00:42:07,444
So this is your new car? That
should solve your distribution problem.

234
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:10,280
Everything's going great.

235
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:16,245
-This is worse than I thought.
-It can always get worse.

236
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:23,752
We need to talk to your mother,
and tie up some loose ends.

237
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:28,215
The bank is foreclosing
and auctioning off the farm.

238
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:36,765
That's very efficient of you.

239
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:42,354
We're only being realistic.
We're doing you a favor.

240
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:46,608
Is it such a good idea for you
to take over the farm?

241
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:53,824
Your so-called business really
has nothing to do with the farm.

242
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:58,495
-Of course it does.
-The board has discussed this.

243
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:02,291
Why not run it as a normal farm?

244
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:06,545
Of course, if you have lots of cash
socked away, I'm not stopping you.

245
00:43:06,712 --> 00:43:09,673
Give this to your mother.

246
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:16,805
We have another board meeting
on Monday. I'm sorry.

247
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:51,006
-What are these?
-Sleeping pills.

248
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:58,305
-And these?
-Painkillers.

249
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:16,031
-How are you doing?
-Not well, as you can see.

250
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:21,995
-How long will you be here?
-Until I die.

251
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:28,627
And Odvar?

252
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:50,566
-I can't handle this, Jonny.
-We'll pull through. I promise.

253
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:56,113
I'm about to ship off
a big load of worms. We can do it.

254
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,533
No, we can't. I can't, anyway.

255
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,495
If I don't die here,
you'll have to finish me off.

256
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:07,166
A broken leg won't kill you, mom.

257
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:12,880
No, but unhappiness will.
I feel like a caged animal.

258
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:19,344
When they're unhappy,
they just lie down and die.

259
00:45:21,138 --> 00:45:25,184
-I want active euthanasia.
-No...

260
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:29,146
Yes, I do...

261
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:01,845
Hi, Paul.

262
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:08,644
Do you have any buyers for that van?

263
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:13,190
Why?
Aren't you going to fix the Duett?

264
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:17,069
You wouldn't consider
letting me rent it?

265
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:22,366
I'll pay you after my first shipment.
I have a load of worms to deliver-

266
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:29,122
-and I thought I could ask you
for a favor, until the Duett is fixed.

267
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:38,423
We're not in the car-rental business.
How much should I charge?

268
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:43,929
A couple of hundred a day,
plus something for mileage.

269
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:47,891
-Doesn't that sound fair?
-It sounds reasonable.

270
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:55,524
But I think we should stick
to the original deal.

271
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:04,783
60,000 and the van is yours.
Then we're even.

272
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,453
Until that happens,
we have nothing to talk about.

273
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:13,834
-I think I'd rather fix the Duett.
-I thought you didn't have time.

274
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:17,212
I never said that.

275
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:23,927
Do you want to borrow this?
It's great for small dents and...

276
00:47:48,035 --> 00:47:49,912
Hi, Jonny.

277
00:47:51,497 --> 00:47:54,249
What's the matter?

278
00:47:54,374 --> 00:47:57,503
-Has something happened?
-No...

279
00:47:57,669 --> 00:48:01,507
Nothing much.

280
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:07,763
You're pregnant,
mom crashed my car, and I'm broke.

281
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:15,062
-The bank's repossessing the farm...
-What?

282
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:20,776
They're taking the farm.
I'm bankrupt.

283
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:34,081
-Is the bank selling the farm?
-That's what they think.

284
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:38,001
But I won't make it easy for them.

285
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:49,513
He's working on some Mexican dish.

286
00:48:51,807 --> 00:48:57,896
And he's cleaned the entire house.
He even waxed the kitchen floor.

287
00:48:58,063 --> 00:49:00,357
-I just don't get it.
-Are you complaining?

288
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:06,155
-No, but he won't say anything.
-Go in to your husband, your family!

289
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:09,575
-Come in and eat with us.
-I just ate.

290
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:13,328
Jonny...

291
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,466
Are you Jonny?

292
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:32,181
I'm Agnes. Nice to meet you.

293
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:36,268
-Have you known him long?
-Since elementary school.

294
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:40,105
We were in the same class.

295
00:49:54,703 --> 00:49:59,166
You can do what you want
with the rest.

296
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:04,922
I sold the tractor to Amundsen.
He'll be over to pick it up.

297
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:08,509
-Amundsen?
-Yeah, he called the other day.

298
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:12,471
You might as well
sell the farm to him.

299
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:15,182
He could use some additional land.

300
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:19,394
Goodbye, Jonny.

301
00:50:29,822 --> 00:50:32,950
Amundsen!

302
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:34,993
Stop!

303
00:51:03,856 --> 00:51:06,024
Is this a bad time?

304
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:12,322
No, it's perfect.

305
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:23,125
It's simple. You shovel dirt
from the compost into this drum.

306
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:28,839
Rotate until only the worms are left,
and lift.

307
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:31,383
Then you put the worms...

308
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:38,432
...in these containers,
with a pinch of soil.

309
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:44,229
Put the containers in boxes,
label them-

310
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:47,816
-and stack them over there.

311
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:49,860
Okay?

312
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:57,993
-Okay?
-Yeah, sure.

313
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:22,184
Hi.

314
00:52:40,702 --> 00:52:43,539
Cheers.

315
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:55,551
What the hell have you
gotten yourself into now, Jonny?

316
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:01,056
Magnus, I...

317
00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:03,100
Hi, girls.

318
00:53:05,018 --> 00:53:08,147
So, Jonny...

319
00:53:08,313 --> 00:53:10,983
You're still alive?

320
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:16,196
And Magnus... Is that you?

321
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:19,950
Did you quit your job,
or did you get fired?

322
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:22,578
Hi, girls.

323
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:31,003
Jesus...What's up
with the bad mood? Cheers.

324
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:41,305
Hi, myname is Jonny.
I have a wife and four kids-

325
00:53:41,471 --> 00:53:46,643
-and I work in a button factory.

326
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:51,148
One day my boss came up to me
and said, ''Jonny, are you busy?''

327
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:56,487
I said, ''No.'' He said, ''Turn
this button with your left hand.''

328
00:53:56,653 --> 00:54:00,199
Hi, my name is Jonny.
I have a wife and four kids-

329
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:03,744
-and I workin a button factory.

330
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:08,415
One day my boss came up to me
and said, ''Jonny, are you busy?''

331
00:54:08,582 --> 00:54:13,587
I said, ''No.'' He said, ''Turn
this button with your right hand.''

332
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:59,341
Come here!

333
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:04,680
Magnus, he's fucking your wife!
Did you know that?

334
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:09,101
-But you don't care, do you?
-Are you jealous?

335
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:28,787
Jonny...

336
00:55:28,954 --> 00:55:33,292
Remember how far we could piss
when we were younger?

337
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:37,796
Now you can barely
get it past the tips of your shoes.

338
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:50,350
How long have you known
about me and Tuva?

339
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:54,730
-All along.
-And that she's pregnant?

340
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,775
-Yeah...
-I knew it.

341
00:55:58,942 --> 00:56:04,364
-Yet you haven't lifted a finger?
-It's not that easy, with work and all.

342
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:08,702
-But I'm home now, so...
-So everything goes back to normal?

343
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:13,123
-No. Thanks to you it won't.
-You could have said something...

344
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,126
...before it went too far.

345
00:56:16,293 --> 00:56:21,048
What the hell have you been doing?
Screwing some bitch at work?

346
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:25,511
-That's not what happened.
-I think it did.

347
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:28,514
I still think you're the one
who attacked me.

348
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,101
You're a coward, Magnus!
Just like back there...

349
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:39,858
You're bigger and stronger than I am.
But I still have to fight your fights.

350
00:57:57,644 --> 00:58:01,190
-Did you sleep okay?
-What are you doing?

351
00:58:01,356 --> 00:58:04,568
-I'm fixing your car.
-I can do it myself.

352
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:10,240
I know that, but two repairmen
are better than none at all.

353
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:13,911
-I don't need your help.
-That's too bad.

354
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:19,333
I need an alibi, since you
seem to think I'm a suspect....

355
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,879
-Tuva kicked me out.
-Poor you.

356
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:03,460
I'm done.

357
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:09,675
I'm done.

358
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:22,020
You did all of it?

359
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:25,315
You must have worked all night!

360
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:42,207
Uffe, you and I are going to make this
the best worm farm in the country.

361
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:13,947
Tomorrow we start delivering worms.

362
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:11,880
Anyone want a piece of me?

363
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:17,427
Come on, you cowards!

364
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:19,763
I'm right here.

365
01:01:37,406 --> 01:01:43,412
Come on. Don't move a muscle,
or I'll shoot you!

366
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:47,332
-What are you doing, Jonny?
-Come on!

367
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:54,423
Helene? You're on my side.

368
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:04,433
Did you sleep well?

369
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:10,647
I never sleep well anymore.

370
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:27,372
-Am I under arrest?
-Yes, I'm afraid so.

371
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:34,129
For how long?

372
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:40,636
You can leave now,
but you'd better eat something first.

373
01:02:46,975 --> 01:02:52,523
-I'm staying here.
-Here? Great.

374
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:56,151
-I need some help building...
-I'm serious.

375
01:02:56,318 --> 01:03:02,658
I don't want to go back out there.
It's time you did your job.

376
01:03:12,209 --> 01:03:17,172
-You can't stay here.
-I think you're behind it all.

377
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:23,637
But you hadn't expected
that I would want to stay here.

378
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:25,889
That doesn't fit your plans.

379
01:03:32,312 --> 01:03:36,567
I'll bet you know who's behind it.
Want to bet?

380
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:41,905
You don't dare to. You'd lose.
You're protecting the bastard.

381
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:48,162
Fine, I'll leave. Thanks for nothing.

382
01:03:48,328 --> 01:03:51,206
I hope you've had fun.
I'm never coming back.

383
01:03:52,749 --> 01:03:55,419
Jonny, get back here!

384
01:03:57,796 --> 01:03:59,673
There's food on the table. Enjoy.

385
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,583
Hi, Gunnar. Out for a walk?

386
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:46,803
What are you doing?
Don't you know that's dangerous?

387
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:50,599
Answer me, you little shit.
Are you insane?

388
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:06,990
It's been you all along.

389
01:05:07,157 --> 01:05:12,579
Did you... Is this all your doing?

390
01:05:12,704 --> 01:05:14,706
Is it?

391
01:05:18,627 --> 01:05:23,173
-Do you realize what you've done?
-Leave my mom alone!

392
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:28,178
Your mom? Do you really think
that would change anything?

393
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:39,231
Gunnar, I'm leaving now,
and I'm never coming back.

394
01:05:39,398 --> 01:05:43,443
But that's not going to
make things better.

395
01:05:44,653 --> 01:05:49,867
Nothing will ever get better
around here. Only worse.

396
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:11,114
Are you out driving?

397
01:07:12,324 --> 01:07:16,703
-Where to? I'm going to Oslo.
-Oslo it is, then.

398
01:07:55,325 --> 01:07:57,327
What?

399
01:07:57,494 --> 01:08:00,747
I have needs too.

400
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:09,923
Fritjof is the first man who really
understands me. Laugh if you want to.

401
01:08:11,175 --> 01:08:14,803
-I don't care anymore.
-Neither do I.

402
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:21,727
-I just came to say goodbye.
-Where are you going?

403
01:08:21,894 --> 01:08:25,481
I don't know.
I just can't stay here.

404
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:34,031
I hope you and Fritjof will be happy.

405
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:40,621
-What will I do without you?
-You'll be fine.

406
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:45,584
You'll probably
be better off without me.

407
01:08:57,638 --> 01:09:02,976
l had to leave. I liked the job,
but it was only temporary anyway.

408
01:09:03,101 --> 01:09:07,856
Plus my sister's having a baby,
and I want to be there for that.

409
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:12,402
I wantto have babies myself,
so it's good to experience a birth.

410
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:16,782
I'll be better prepared that way.
That's why I had to quit.

411
01:09:16,949 --> 01:09:24,373
She's my sister,
so I'll be an aunt for the first time.

412
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,375
Aunt Helene...

413
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:29,294
That sounds pretty good.

414
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:36,677
Tell me about yourself, Jonny.
We'll be spending some time together.

415
01:09:36,844 --> 01:09:41,348
I only know what other people
have told me about you-

416
01:09:41,515 --> 01:09:45,477
-and you can't believe
everything people say. So tell me.

417
01:09:47,354 --> 01:09:50,899
-About what?
-About yourself.

418
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:53,068
Why is your mom in the hospital?

419
01:09:53,235 --> 01:09:57,948
Or are you a mysterious
and secretive man?

420
01:09:59,575 --> 01:10:05,831
I know more about you than you think,
but I want to hear your side of things.

421
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:11,170
Your friends, your family,
why you're going to Oslo...

422
01:10:25,767 --> 01:10:29,688
-What are you doing here?
-I want to leave too.

423
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:44,578
You can't just leave.

424
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:51,001
What about everyone back home?
They'll be worried about you.

425
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:55,631
You said that nothing
would ever get better at home.

426
01:10:55,797 --> 01:11:02,513
I don't want to live there anymore.
I'd rather go to the city.

427
01:11:04,848 --> 01:11:11,021
-What are you going to do there?
-There's lots of stuff to do there.

428
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:32,292
Put your seat belt on.

429
01:12:34,062 --> 01:12:38,108
-Where the hell have you been?
-I've just...

430
01:12:45,616 --> 01:12:49,161
Think of it as penance.

431
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:55,209
I'm sorry I locked you up,
but I've solved the mystery.

432
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:59,129
-You didn't expect that, did you?
-No. Not like that.

433
01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:37,501
Come in.

434
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:05,654
-How's the bed?
-It's not too bad.

435
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:10,701
-Why do you ask?
-This is where we did it.

436
01:14:12,703 --> 01:14:16,582
It's a nice cabin.
You should rent it out.

437
01:14:16,707 --> 01:14:20,836
We had sex here night after night.

438
01:14:22,004 --> 01:14:25,340
While you were slaving away
at the construction site.

439
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,429
Tuva and I fucked in here
until the walls shook.

440
01:14:30,554 --> 01:14:33,015
How does that make you feel?

441
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:04,546
Do you want to hear a story, Jonny?

442
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:06,590
Jonny!

443
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:18,268
-Magnus...
-Jonny!

444
01:15:47,339 --> 01:15:51,260
People say that it's better to regret
something that you've done-

445
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:57,307
-than something that you
haven't done. That's bullshit.

446
01:15:58,934 --> 01:16:05,023
I was heading home one day, when
my foreman asked me for a favor.

447
01:16:05,149 --> 01:16:09,945
I had already packed my car,
but I said yes, to be nice.

448
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:15,117
He wanted me
to fire up an old compressor.

449
01:16:15,242 --> 01:16:18,453
It had to run for a while
to build up pressure.

450
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:29,715
It had a belt drive
with four or five big belts.

451
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,718
Listen to me, you prick!

452
01:16:34,303 --> 01:16:41,059
I had nothing to do while I waited,
so I just hung around there.

453
01:16:41,185 --> 01:16:46,231
It was hot as hell.
I was wearing nothing but shorts.

454
01:16:46,356 --> 01:16:50,444
I don't even know why-

455
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:55,324
-but I started scraping loose gravel
off the road with a little rake.

456
01:16:55,449 --> 01:16:59,661
A bulldozer had been there
earlier that day-

457
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:02,873
-and all I had was a little rake.

458
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:09,922
I made a nice little pile
that I planned to sweep off the road.

459
01:17:10,047 --> 01:17:12,049
Listen to me!

460
01:17:12,174 --> 01:17:15,219
You're going to
fucking listen to me, Jonny.

461
01:17:17,221 --> 01:17:23,560
I ended up backing my ass
into the compressor's drive gear.

462
01:17:23,685 --> 01:17:30,526
I felt it tighten around my waist.
It hurt like hell.

463
01:17:30,651 --> 01:17:36,198
I figured it was just my shorts
tightening around my waist.

464
01:17:36,323 --> 01:17:41,495
But then I got that nauseating feeling,
like when you hit your balls.

465
01:17:43,705 --> 01:17:48,585
Then I blacked out. I was out cold.

466
01:17:50,379 --> 01:17:54,925
When I came to,
I was lying on the ground.

467
01:17:56,927 --> 01:17:59,763
My shorts were gone.

468
01:18:01,557 --> 01:18:05,602
They were spinning around
the drive gear like a fan.

469
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:13,485
When I took a closer look, I could see
my''equipment'' also hanging there.

470
01:18:20,868 --> 01:18:23,287
So much for my manhood.

471
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:36,383
I wasn't myself again after that.
It seemed so pointless.

472
01:18:36,508 --> 01:18:40,554
I couldn't tell Tuva.

473
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:44,725
-Haven't you told Tuva?
-I tried.

474
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:48,353
I called her from the hospital
and tried to tell her.

475
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:55,944
But instead I pretended
that I was busy at work.

476
01:18:57,738 --> 01:19:02,868
I knocked a vase against my bedpan-

477
01:19:02,993 --> 01:19:06,788
-to make it sound like I was working.

478
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:15,297
Everything has its price.

479
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:20,552
Especially vital organs.

480
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:28,769
-Did you get compensated for it?
-Damages.

481
01:19:34,775 --> 01:19:37,903
How much?

482
01:19:38,028 --> 01:19:43,367
-Enough to buy your farm.
-Idiot.

483
01:19:47,412 --> 01:19:52,626
-Don't dick me around.
-I wish I could.

484
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:59,383
I thought maybe
we could all move in together.

485
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:05,347
Since it looks like we're all
going to have kids together.

486
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:08,058
If it's okay with you.

487
01:21:00,068 --> 01:21:05,365
Nothing turns out like you expected
it to. Nothing is what you think it is.

488
01:21:05,491 --> 01:21:10,996
The day when everything works out
may never come.

489
01:21:11,121 --> 01:21:15,751
But things can get better,
even if they don't go as planned.

490
01:21:15,876 --> 01:21:20,255
Sometimes you just feel
that something is right.

491
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:25,469
That things fall into place,
and that you can take a step forward.

492
01:21:25,594 --> 01:21:28,639
Toward that day in the distant future.

493
01:21:28,764 --> 01:21:34,603
That's what life is all about.
It's not that complicated, just complex.

494
01:21:35,603 --> 01:21:45,603
