Back there,
You did good.

469
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:41,853
Thanks.

470
00:59:51,944 --> 00:59:53,373
Catch.

471
00:59:55,785 --> 00:59:57,214
All right.

472
01:00:01,066 --> 01:00:02,976
Shake?

473
01:00:08,747 --> 01:00:10,657
Thanks.

474
01:00:12,107 --> 01:00:14,496
You bought yourself
Some time, son.

475
01:00:16,428 --> 01:00:19,308
Jesse, there's somethin'
I've been meanin' to ask you.

476
01:00:19,342 --> 01:00:22,658
- Yeah? What might that be?
- How old are you?

477
01:00:23,149 --> 01:00:25,058
Let's put it this way:
I fought for the south.

478
01:00:25,549 --> 01:00:27,589
The south?

479
01:00:30,478 --> 01:00:34,308
We lost.

480
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:39,588
Hey, caleb, let's go out
And look at the night.

481
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,989
All right.

482
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:48,720
How about a little five-card
Russian roulette?

483
01:00:48,754 --> 01:00:50,630
Why not, severen?

484
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,870
It almost feels like
You're one of us now.

485
01:00:57,361 --> 01:00:58,790
Yeah, it does.

486
01:01:00,242 --> 01:01:02,631
So what does that make me?
I ain't exactly sure.

487
01:01:06,482 --> 01:01:08,392
It's good, right?
I guess so, yeah.

488
01:01:10,322 --> 01:01:12,209
Do you miss the sun?

489
01:01:12,243 --> 01:01:14,632
It's been so long,
I can't really remember.

490
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:17,970
How long?

491
01:01:18,003 --> 01:01:21,939
Spring, four years back,

492
01:01:21,972 --> 01:01:24,339
And i was in high school. Mmm.

493
01:01:24,372 --> 01:01:27,722
Homer said he was in fifth grade
And he needed help With his homework.

494
01:01:28,693 --> 01:01:30,603
Little weasel.

495
01:01:32,534 --> 01:01:35,404
- Do you miss he day?
- The day?

496
01:01:38,774 --> 01:01:42,604
Nah. I can see better at night.

497
01:01:50,168 --> 01:01:53,038
Here we go.
I don't want this.

498
01:01:55,448 --> 01:01:57,358
Three cards.
How many you want, Little boner?

499
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:01,689
How many for you,
You old saddle bum?

500
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:04,089
Three. Three. There you go.
One for her.

501
01:02:04,123 --> 01:02:07,417
Three for the dealer.

502
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:09,850
Are you cheatin', Severen?
I ain't cheatin'.

503
01:02:09,884 --> 01:02:12,731
What's this then?

504
01:02:19,451 --> 01:02:21,361
Deal the cards.

505
01:02:21,852 --> 01:02:23,762
I fold. I'm gonna taste the air.

506
01:02:25,212 --> 01:02:28,082
Watch the time, boy.
Deal the cards.

507
01:03:12,131 --> 01:03:14,520
It's impolite to stare.

508
01:03:23,172 --> 01:03:25,539
Howdy.

509
01:03:25,572 --> 01:03:27,972

537
01:05:14,483 --> 01:05:16,370
I tried callin' you.

538
01:05:16,403 --> 01:05:18,323
We've been out a lot
Drivin' in the truck,

01:05:18,357 --> 01:05:21,193
Tryin' to track you down. Dad.

540
01:05:21,683 --> 01:05:24,051
Son.

541
01:05:24,084 --> 01:05:26,931
Son?
Son?

542
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,604
'Round and 'round
And 'round she goes.

543
01:05:29,638 --> 01:05:32,211
And where she stops,
Nobody knows.

544
01:05:32,245 --> 01:05:35,594
It's about time For that big old wheel
To stop rotatin'.

545
01:05:37,526 --> 01:05:39,680
Who are these people?

546
01:05:39,714 --> 01:05:41,835
I'm with them now.

547
01:05:44,247 --> 01:05:46,167
Jesse, you let them go.

548
01:05:46,201 --> 01:05:48,077

No. But you're goin'.

552
01:06:05,883 --> 01:06:09,656
No!

553
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:12,536
She's mine.

554
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:14,959
You're gonna have to Give her back, son.
She's not yours.

555
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:18,811
- I'm gonna nip her.
- You can't do that.

556
01:06:18,845 --> 01:06:21,178
I chewed mae.

557
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:24,571
She went off
And chewed on you.

558
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:27,932
Now i'm chewing
Your little sister.

559
01:06:27,966 --> 01:06:30,715
That makes us even-steven.

560
01:06:30,748 --> 01:06:33,115
You let her go or
I'm gonna have to hurt Your body, homer.

561
01:06:33,149 --> 01:06:36,509
- You're gonna have to hurt My body first.
- Hold on a second, pilgrim.

562
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:38,429
Remember which side Of the bread
Your butter's on.

563
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:40,846
Goddamn, this is my family!
Let 'em go!

564
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,196
The question is whether
They'd let us go.

565
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:47,070
They've been trackin' us.
Now they know our faces. I say kill 'em.

For you.

572
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:34,242

- Go on, daddy! Go!
- What the goddamn hell's Goin' on, son?

574
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:49,503
I can't expect y ou To believe it.
I can't believe it myself.

575
01:07:49,537 --> 01:07:52,933
I ain't a person anymore.
I don't know what i am. I'm sick!

01:07:58,728 --> 01:08:02,077
Normal folks, They don't spit out bullets
When you shoot 'em.

579

01:17:42,484 --> 01:17:44,393
Then i'm gonna knock
Your tonsils out your asshole.

628
01:17:44,885 --> 01:17:46,314
What do you think
Of them apples, huh?

629
01:17:56,886 --> 01:17:59,755
Stop! Stop!

630
01:18:04,087 --> 01:18:05,974
Hey, mister...
Get the hell off my truck!

631
01:18:06,007 --> 01:18:07,917

Before you get killed. -

632
01:18:08,407 --> 01:18:10,808
I'm gonna give you
Till the count of five!

633
01:18:10,841 --> 01:18:13,197
One, two, four...

634
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:16,078
Bull's-eye!

635
01:18:18,968 --> 01:18:22,318
Mister? Jesus.

636
01:18:22,809 --> 01:18:25,198
I'm sorry. Damn you.

637
01:18:26,649 --> 01:18:29,039
Now come on!

Come on, come on.

639
01:18:34,716 --> 01:18:35,763
Come on.

640
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:49,330
Whoo!

641
01:18:50,781 --> 01:18:53,147
Whoo!

642
01:18:53,181 --> 01:18:57,011
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

643
01:19:00,991 --> 01:19:04,317
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, caleb?

644
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:06,271
Fasten your fuckin'
Seat belt!

645
01:19:14,784 --> 01:19:16,705
Son of a bitch!

646
01:19:35,651 --> 01:19:38,040
No! -

647
01:19:43,332 --> 01:19:46,114
Whoo-hoo!

648
01:20:39,275 --> 01:20:41,185
It's time to pay The fiddler.

649
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:43,082
Where's my sister, jess?

650
01:20:43,116 --> 01:20:45,516
I taught severen
Everything he knew,

651
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,425
But not everything I know.

652
01:20:49,356 --> 01:20:52,226
The last sound that you hear
On your way to hell...

653
01:20:52,589 --> 01:20:54,498
Is gonna be your guts
Snappin' like a bullwhip.

654
01:20:54,989 --> 01:20:57,379
This ain't got nothin'
To do with my sister!

655
01:20:57,870 --> 01:21:00,270
You leave her out of this
And let her go!

656
01:21:00,303 --> 01:21:03,139
Jesse, let him come back.

657
01:21:05,551 --> 01:21:07,460
It's too late for that, Mae.

658
01:21:12,751 --> 01:21:14,661
Goddamn, jesse,
Where's my sister?

659
01:21:25,105 --> 01:21:27,025
Everything is gonna be
All right.

660
01:21:27,059 --> 01:21:28,912
Don't be scared.

661
01:21:28,946 --> 01:21:32,295
- I'm gonna take her back.
- Sure you will.

662
01:21:40,851 --> 01:21:43,601
Caleb, look out!

663
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:46,353
Jess!

664
01:21:46,836 --> 01:21:48,746
Hey!

665
01:21:55,957 --> 01:21:58,346
Go, caleb.
Make a run for it.

666
01:22:10,487 --> 01:22:12,397
Come on, jesse!
Get in the car! Mae, come on!

667
01:22:16,248 --> 01:22:18,637
Hurry up!
Get in the car!

668
01:22:40,379 --> 01:22:42,288
Go on! Aah!

669
01:22:42,779 --> 01:22:45,649
Go on, honey. Go on. Run.
Run, sarah!

670
01:23:03,838 --> 01:23:09,972
No!

671
01:23:20,385 --> 01:23:22,774
Block that sun out!

672
01:23:46,883 --> 01:23:49,409
No!

673
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:51,935
Mae!

674
01:23:54,564 --> 01:23:58,307
No, homer!

675
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:12,220
No!

676
01:24:24,232 --> 01:24:26,142
Caleb!

677
01:24:28,073 --> 01:24:29,731
Wait, sarah!

678
01:24:36,714 --> 01:24:38,624
My god.

679
01:24:41,035 --> 01:24:42,945
Jesse.

680
01:25:15,823 --> 01:25:17,252
Roast.

681
01:25:17,743 --> 01:25:19,172
Fun times.

682
01:26:21,784 --> 01:26:24,173
Caleb, what's happening?

683
01:26:26,233 --> 01:26:27,662
I brought you home.

684
01:26:32,953 --> 01:26:35,348
I'm afraid. Don't be.

685
01:26:35,382 --> 01:26:37,743
It's just the sun.
