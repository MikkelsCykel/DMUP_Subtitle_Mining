<i>I was dreamin'</i>

2
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:41,503
<i>Dreamin' my dick was out
and I was checking to see</i>

3
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:44,907
<i>if that infected bump on the head
of it had filled with pus again</i>

4
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:47,741
<i>If it had. I was gonna name
that bump after my ex-wife Priscilla</i>

5
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:49,906
<i>and bust it by jackin' off</i>

6
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:51,040
Oh, man.

7
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:52,947
<i>Or I'd like to think that's what I'd do</i>

8
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:56,117
<i>Dreams let you think like that</i>

9
00:02:56,188 --> 00:03:00,648
<i>Truth was. I hadn't had
a hard-on in years</i>

10
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:25,039
Oh, man.

11
00:03:57,016 --> 00:04:00,508
<i>My God. Man
How long have I been here?</i>

12
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:04,078
<i>Am I really awake now.
Or am I just dreamin' I'm awake?</i>

13
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:07,319
<i>How could my plans
have gone so wrong?</i>

14
00:04:07,393 --> 00:04:09,554
<i>When the hell are they
gonna serve lunch?</i>

15
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:12,358
<i>Considerin' what they serve.
Why the hell do I care?</i>

16
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:17,833
<i>If Priscilla discovered I was alive.
Would she come and see me?</i>

17
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:22,169
<i>Would we still wanna fuck?
Or would we merely have to talk about it?</i>

18
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,970
<i>Is there. Finally and really.</i>

19
00:04:24,043 --> 00:04:27,376
<i>Anything to life other than
food. Shit. And sex?</i>

20
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,781
<i>We, goddamn t</i>

21
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,788
<i>How could I have gone from
the "King of rock and roll" to this?</i>

22
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:47,158
<i>Old guy in a rest home in East Texas
with a growth on his pecker</i>

23
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,375
<i>And what is that growth. Man?</i>

24
00:05:07,453 --> 00:05:10,183
<i>Cancer? Nobody's talkin'</i>

25
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:13,781
<i>No one seems to know
or wants to</i>

26
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:19,684
Makes you wonder, doesn't it,
what kind of life this old guy had?

27
00:06:20,826 --> 00:06:24,660
What kind of life he had, you know.
His kids, his grandkids, his legacy.

28
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,890
Look at him now.

29
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:27,625
Oh, who gives a shit?

30
00:07:09,675 --> 00:07:11,006
Well...

31
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:23,548
Make you comfortable.

32
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:30,224
No.

33
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:14,891
I'm gonna squish you, cockroach!

34
00:10:19,097 --> 00:10:20,587
Help me.

35
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,781
You know, I was thinkin'...

36
00:11:13,852 --> 00:11:17,015
What? You gonna get
all weepy on me again?

37
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:21,082
No. I was merely gonna suggest that you
use some of this here deodorizer

38
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:24,651
and spray it on that corpse
because she's smellin' pretty ripe.

39
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:29,698
Good idea.

40
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:42,870
Excuse me, miss?

41
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:45,604
You gonna throw all that stuff out?

42
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:47,669
Yeah.

43
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:50,579
Could I have one
of them pictures of Bull?

44
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,415
Maybe his... his Purple Heart?

45
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:56,948
I mean,
he was pretty proud of that.

46
00:12:57,022 --> 00:13:00,719
And maybe that... that tin
of chocolates there?

47
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:04,125
I suppose.

48
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:13,431
<i>The revealin' of her panties
wasn't intentional or unintentional</i>

49
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:14,995
<i>She just didn't give a damn</i>

50
00:13:15,073 --> 00:13:18,133
<i>She saw me as so physically
and sexually non-threatenin'.</i>

51
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,475
<i>She didn't mind if I got
a bird's-eye view of her love nest</i>

52
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:24,276
<i>It was the same to her
as a house cat sneakin' a peek</i>

53
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:29,184
<i>I felt my pecker flutteronce like
a pigeon havin' a heart attack</i>

54
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:32,515
<i>then it laid back down
and remained limp and still</i>

55
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:36,251
<i>'Course. These days. Even a flutter
was kind of reassurin'</i>

56
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,361
- Here.
- Thank you.

57
00:13:40,432 --> 00:13:42,093
Say...

58
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:44,163
Bull your kin?

59
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:45,396
My daddy

60
00:13:47,806 --> 00:13:49,603
Never seen you here before.

61
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:54,003
I've only been here once before.
When I checked him in.

62
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:56,877
That's three years ago, wasn't it?

63
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,681
You and him friends?

64
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:02,948
No, we just roommates. I mean,
he never felt good enough to say much.

65
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:06,751
I just hated to see what
was left of him go away so easy.

66
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:11,493
Seemed like an all right guy.

67
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:15,499
Mentioned you a lot.
You're... you're Callie, right?

68
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:17,057
Yeah.

69
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:19,467
Well... he was all right.

70
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:22,600
But not enough so you'd
come and see him, though.

71
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:26,933
Don't lay some guilt trip on me, mister.
I did what I could.

72
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:30,675
I mean, if it hadn't been for Medicaid
or Medicare... whatever that stuff was...

73
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:32,649
he'd have been
in some ditch somewhere.

74
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:37,644
And I sure didn't have the money
to take care of him.

75
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:42,790
<i>My own daughter</i>

76
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:45,895
<i>lost long ago to me</i>

77
00:14:45,964 --> 00:14:48,899
<i>if she knew I lived.
Would she come and see me?</i>

78
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:50,366
<i>Woud she even ccae?</i>

79
00:14:51,336 --> 00:14:54,828
You could've come and seen him.
They don't charge you for that.

80
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,939
Mind your own business.

81
00:14:58,376 --> 00:14:59,866
I was busy.

82
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:18,590
Well, well, well.
If it isn't my favorite patient.

83
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:20,654
How are you this morning, Mr. Haff?

84
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:22,393
I'm all right.

85
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:25,868
But I prefer Mr. Presley or Elvis.
I keep tellin' you that.

86
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:28,428
I don't go by
Sebastian Haff anymore, okay?

87
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,769
I'm not tryin' to hide anymore.

88
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:33,777
Well, of course I knew that.
I forgot.

89
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:36,177
Good morning, Elvis.

90
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,814
Did you know we have
a celebrity here, Miss Thomas?

91
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:45,014
Elvis Presley. You know,
the rock and roll singer.

92
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:48,185
I thought he was dead.

93
00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:53,190
Well, actually, Elvis is dead.
Mr. Haff knows that. Don't you, Mr. Haff?

94
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:56,530
Hell, no. I'm right here.
I ain't dead.

95
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:58,398
Yet.

96
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,303
Now, Mr. Haff!

97
00:16:01,373 --> 00:16:04,035
I don't mind calling you "Elvis."

98
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:06,942
But you're a little confused
and you like to play sometimes.

99
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:11,881
You were an
Elvis impersonator, remember?

100
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:16,887
You fell off the stage
and broke your hip... when was it?

101
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:18,445
Twenty years ago.

102
00:16:18,523 --> 00:16:22,357
It got infected and you were
in a coma for quite a while.

103
00:16:22,427 --> 00:16:26,761
You came out with a few...
problems.

104
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:32,798
Look, I was just impersonatin' myself.
I couldn't do nothin' else.

105
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:34,202
I don't have any problems.

106
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:36,365
You're tryin' to say
my brain's messed up, aren't you?

107
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:38,932
Why would you
wanna be somebody else?

108
00:16:39,944 --> 00:16:41,104
I got tired of it.

109
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:44,004
I was hooked on pills, you know.

110
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:45,674
I wanted out.

111
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,480
And this boy Sebastian Haff...
he was an Elvis imitator.

112
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:51,386
He was the best of 'em.
He took my place.

113
00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:53,852
Problem is, he had a bad heart.

114
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:57,025
He liked drugs, too.
Liked them more than I did.

115
00:16:57,095 --> 00:17:01,122
So it was him that died, not me.
I just took his place.

116
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:05,067
<i>But why would you want
to leave all that fame. Mr Presley?</i>

117
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:07,728
<i>All that money?</i>

118
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:10,138
<i>I don't know
'Cause they got old</i>

119
00:17:13,745 --> 00:17:18,239
<i>The woman I loved... Priscilla...
she was gone</i>

120
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:20,978
<i>The rest of the women
were just women</i>

121
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:25,147
<i>I mean. The music
wasn't mine anymore</i>

122
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:28,215
<i>I wasn't even me anymore
Just this thing they made up</i>

123
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:32,226
<i>And my friends</i>

124
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,664
<i>We, they wwee succk n' moe d y</i>

125
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:44,035
<i>So I took a little road trip
down to Nacogdoches</i>

126
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:49,036
<i>to check out this Sebastian Haff</i>

127
00:18:36,094 --> 00:18:37,755
It's all right, boys.
Just wait here.

128
00:19:01,753 --> 00:19:02,913
Oh, my God.

129
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,390
I didn't think you'd really...

130
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:34,816
It's all right, boys.
Just another freak.

131
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:37,481
Let's split.

132
00:19:50,368 --> 00:19:52,768
- Sorry, man.
- King, I got it. I got it.

133
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:54,168
It's all yours, baby.

134
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:05,948
<i>So I signed everything
over to Sebastian</i>

135
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:09,509
<i>Except for enough money
to sustain me if things got bad</i>

136
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:12,613
<i>I was determined
to make myself a new life</i>

137
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,021
<i>A better one</i>

138
00:20:16,361 --> 00:20:19,023
<i>But me and Sebastian.
We had us a deal</i>

139
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:23,090
<i>If I wanted to trade back. He'd let me</i>

140
00:20:24,335 --> 00:20:26,326
<i>It was all written up in the contract</i>

141
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:28,997
<i>The thing was</i>

142
00:20:29,073 --> 00:20:31,564
<i>I lost my copy
in a barbeque accident</i>

143
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:34,469
<i>But that wasn't so bad. Either</i>

144
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:37,709
<i>I was makin' new friends
and enjoyin' myself</i>

145
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:41,445
Cheers!

146
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,090
Oh, my God.
Did you see that thing?

147
00:20:58,536 --> 00:21:00,026
It just went up like that.

148
00:21:00,972 --> 00:21:04,169
<i>- Now. Elvis
- Yes?</i>

149
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:08,436
Don't carry it too far.

150
00:21:08,513 --> 00:21:12,506
You may just get way out there
and not come back.

151
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:15,141
Oh, fuck you.

152
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:18,645
Shit.

153
00:21:18,723 --> 00:21:22,215
Get old, you can't even cuss
someone and have it bother 'em.

154
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:26,286
Everything you do is either
worthless or sadly amusing.

155
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:28,498
Well...

156
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:30,397
I've got what I want.

157
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:34,102
The clothes can go
to Goodwill or Salvation Army.

158
00:21:34,172 --> 00:21:38,802
Very well. And I'm sorry about
your father. He was a nice man.

159
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:40,343
Yeah.

160
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:43,103
It was nice to meet you, Mr. Presley.

161
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:45,376
- Get the hell out.
- Now, now.

162
00:21:46,718 --> 00:21:52,588
I'll be back later to do that little... thing
that has to be done. You know.

163
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:58,286
Elvis!

164
00:22:08,973 --> 00:22:10,133
Poor Bull.

165
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:16,307
In the end...
does anything really matter?

166
00:22:20,485 --> 00:22:22,476
<i>No one here ever listened to me</i>

167
00:22:23,154 --> 00:22:27,557
<i>Except this one guy
only. He was certifiable</i>

168
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,820
That's where they took
a piece of my brain.

169
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:33,352
They got it back in D.C.
In that goddamn jar.

170
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:38,359
I got a little bag of sand
up there now.

171
00:22:39,437 --> 00:22:41,928
Jack... no offense, but...

172
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:44,941
President Kennedy was a white man.

173
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:47,000
That's how clever they are!

174
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:50,070
They dyed me this color.
All over!

175
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:53,549
Can you think of a better way
to hide the truth than that?

176
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:53,670
<i>I was livin' simple</i>

177
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:56,574
<i>The way Haff had been</i>

178
00:23:56,647 --> 00:23:59,639
<i>Going from town to town
doin' the Elvis act</i>

179
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:02,951
<i>Only. I felt like I
was really me again</i>

180
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,351
Can you dig that?

181
00:24:04,422 --> 00:24:07,687
We're diggin' it, Mr. Haff...
Mr. Presley.

182
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:47,186
<i>Women were
throwin' themselves at me</i>

183
00:24:47,265 --> 00:24:49,199
<i>'cause they could imagine I was Elvis</i>

184
00:24:49,267 --> 00:24:53,135
<i>Only. I was Elvis playing
Sebastian Haff playing Elvis</i>

185
00:24:53,204 --> 00:24:54,694
<i>It was all pretty good</i>

186
00:24:54,772 --> 00:24:56,865
<i>I didn't mind the contract
being burned up</i>

187
00:24:56,941 --> 00:24:59,102
<i>Didn't even try to go back
and convince anybody</i>

188
00:25:01,312 --> 00:25:02,939
<i>Then I had the accident</i>

189
00:25:03,014 --> 00:25:06,245
<i>I was gyratin'. See. Takin' care business.
And then my hip went out</i>

190
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:09,614
<i>I'd been havin' trouble with it</i>

191
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,267
Damn. It's cold in here tonight.

192
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,313
No way. That's it.
This time, I make it.

193
00:25:43,421 --> 00:25:45,821
No more piss or crap
in the bed.

194
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:12,813
Shake it out...

195
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:24,058
There we go.

196
00:26:57,995 --> 00:27:02,193
Man... that is one
big bitch cockroach.

197
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:36,161
All right, man. Let's go.

198
00:27:45,176 --> 00:27:46,666
Damn.

199
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:52,444
Hot damn!

200
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:23,844
Got you, you six-legged bastard.

201
00:29:04,822 --> 00:29:08,485
Even a big bitch cockroach
like you should know...

202
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:14,354
Never... but never fuck with the King.

203
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:35,746
Hey! Is anybody out here?

204
00:29:40,524 --> 00:29:43,357
I think we got some major
bug problems in this place, man!

205
00:30:50,661 --> 00:30:52,595
Oh, man...

206
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:55,223
Hey, Jack?

207
00:31:07,044 --> 00:31:08,375
Hey, man, you okay?

208
00:31:15,386 --> 00:31:17,877
What the Sam Hill is that?

209
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:22,452
Mr. Kennedy?

210
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,763
Hey, man...
you're on the floor.

211
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:35,399
No shit.

212
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,968
Who are you?

213
00:31:38,976 --> 00:31:40,136
Look, I'm...

214
00:31:41,512 --> 00:31:44,572
Sebastian. Sebastian Haff.

215
00:31:45,382 --> 00:31:47,976
Did you see him go by in the hall?

216
00:31:49,286 --> 00:31:51,447
He scuttled like.

217
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:54,918
- Who, man?
- The one they sent.

218
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:59,317
- Who's "they"?
- Oh, you know who.

219
00:31:59,396 --> 00:32:01,125
No, Jack, I don't.
Come on, man.

220
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,931
Lyndon Johnson.

221
00:32:05,002 --> 00:32:06,492
Castro, maybe.

222
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,562
They sent somebody to finish me off.

223
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,803
I think maybe it was Johnson himself.

224
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:16,903
Real ugly.
Real goddamn ugly!

225
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:19,245
Look, man,
President Johnson's dead.

226
00:32:19,316 --> 00:32:22,808
Shit. That ain't gonna stop him.

227
00:32:28,025 --> 00:32:29,185
Get his feet.

228
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:37,258
So, you say you heard a... a noise?

229
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:41,202
Well, a sound's a sound, you know?
I mean, I heard something.

230
00:32:41,272 --> 00:32:45,675
It was like a... I don't know.
Like a... like a scuttling.

231
00:32:45,743 --> 00:32:48,268
- A scuttling sound?
- Yes, sir.

232
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:53,172
Were you awake or were you
in bed when you heard this noise?

233
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,084
I was in bed first, then I was awake
'cause the damn bugs woke me up.

234
00:32:57,154 --> 00:32:58,985
You got bugs all over this place.

235
00:33:00,157 --> 00:33:04,856
Bugs... well, Mr. Haff, what kind
of bugs have you been seeing?

236
00:33:04,928 --> 00:33:07,328
Look, do I look like
an ichthyologist to you?

237
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:08,558
Big damn bugs, all right?

238
00:33:08,632 --> 00:33:11,795
The size of my fist. The size
of a peanut butter and banana sandwich.

239
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:14,201
What do I care?
I got a growth on my pecker.

240
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:16,432
Okay, Mr. Haff.
Don't worry about a thing.

241
00:33:16,507 --> 00:33:19,943
We'll call the exterminator tomorrow
and we'll take care of the problem.

242
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,841
Good. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

243
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:45,597
It's time for that little thing again.

244
00:34:14,865 --> 00:34:18,426
<i>A doll like this handlin' me
without warmth or emotion</i>

245
00:34:18,502 --> 00:34:20,493
<i>Twenty years ago
Just twenty. Man</i>

246
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:24,234
<i>I could've made with the curly-lip smile
and had here atin' out of my asshole</i>

247
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:29,575
Doctor says this cream
ought to do the trick.

248
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:31,807
Corticosteroids.

249
00:34:31,882 --> 00:34:35,613
Should heal the inflammation,
stop the pus.

250
00:34:37,154 --> 00:34:38,712
<i>Whee'd my youth go?</i>

251
00:34:40,057 --> 00:34:42,992
<i>Why didn't fame
hold off old age and death?</i>

252
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,722
<i>Why the hell did I leave
the fame in the first place?</i>

253
00:34:45,796 --> 00:34:47,457
<i>Do I want it back?
Could I have it back?</i>

254
00:34:47,531 --> 00:34:51,023
<i>And if I could
would it make any damn difference?</i>

255
00:35:12,689 --> 00:35:15,180
Mr. Haff!

256
00:35:21,899 --> 00:35:23,764
<i>Lord almighty</i>

257
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:28,096
You old rascal.

258
00:35:30,374 --> 00:35:33,832
I think you better take
a cold shower, Mr. Haff.

259
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:38,411
<i>There'd been two presidential elections
since I had a boner like that one</i>

260
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:39,972
<i>WWhat ga ve hee?</i>

261
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,950
<i>Then I realized what gave</i>

262
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:44,214
<i>I was thinkin' about something
that interested me</i>

263
00:35:44,288 --> 00:35:46,347
<i>Not my next meal
orgoin' to the crapper</i>

264
00:35:47,124 --> 00:35:49,456
<i>I'd been given a dose of life again</i>

265
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:56,430
You get in there with me,
I'll take that shower.

266
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,991
You silly thing.

267
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:01,629
Come on, now.
Why don't you pull on it a little?

268
00:36:03,407 --> 00:36:05,671
You ought to be ashamed.

269
00:36:39,676 --> 00:36:43,874
Where at? Where at?

270
00:36:43,947 --> 00:36:45,175
I haven't seen my kids.

271
00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:46,409
It's an ambush!

272
00:36:48,886 --> 00:36:52,014
Under the bridge.
I saw him under the bridge.

273
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:56,124
It's an ambush!
Tonto, my boots, Tonto!

274
00:36:56,193 --> 00:36:59,924
<i>That's my friend Kemosabe
We used to play cards together</i>

275
00:36:59,997 --> 00:37:02,989
<i>- My boots!
- Now he doesn't even know who I am</i>

276
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:02,518
Daddy.

277
00:38:07,631 --> 00:38:08,791
Baby?

278
00:38:15,906 --> 00:38:19,740
Sebastian. Sebastian! It's loose!

279
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:20,970
What's loose?

280
00:38:21,044 --> 00:38:22,636
Lt. Listen.

281
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,684
Jesus Christ. What's that?

282
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:38,728
I thought it was Lyndon Johnson,
but I was wrong.

283
00:38:38,795 --> 00:38:42,356
I've come across new evidence
to suggest another assassin.

284
00:38:44,001 --> 00:38:45,161
Assassin?

285
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:47,829
He's after another target tonight.

286
00:38:47,904 --> 00:38:49,804
Come on, I wanna show you something.

287
00:38:49,873 --> 00:38:52,341
I don't think it's safe
if you go back to sleeping.

288
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:55,037
For chrissake, man.
Just tell the administrators.

289
00:38:56,613 --> 00:38:59,707
Suits and white starches?
No, thank you!

290
00:38:59,783 --> 00:39:04,083
I trusted them when I was back in Dallas,
and look where they got my brain and me.

291
00:39:04,154 --> 00:39:07,146
I'm thinkin' with sand here.

292
00:39:07,224 --> 00:39:10,387
I mean, I pick up some waves,
maybe, from my brain,

293
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,291
but somheday, who khows

294
00:39:12,362 --> 00:39:15,525
Somebody might just disconnect
the battery at the White House.

295
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,762
Oh, yeah. That's something
to worry about, all right.

296
00:39:21,471 --> 00:39:23,701
Listen here. Listen.

297
00:39:23,774 --> 00:39:25,605
I know you're Elvis.

298
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:37,814
There was a rumor, you know,
that you hated me.

299
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:39,287
But I thought about that.

300
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:44,817
If you hated me, you could've
finished me off the other night.

301
00:39:46,663 --> 00:39:50,497
What I want from you is
that you look me straight in the eye

302
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:55,732
and assure me you had nothing
at all to do with that day in Dallas,

303
00:39:55,806 --> 00:39:59,867
and that you did not know
Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby.

304
00:40:07,684 --> 00:40:09,345
Look, man...

305
00:40:09,419 --> 00:40:11,580
I had nothing to do with Dallas.

306
00:40:11,655 --> 00:40:15,216
And I knew neither
Lee Harvey Oswald nor Jack Ruby.

307
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:20,792
Good. May I call you Elvis
instead of Sebastian?

308
00:40:21,465 --> 00:40:22,659
You may.

309
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:24,223
Excellent.

310
00:40:24,301 --> 00:40:25,962
You wear glasses to read?

311
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:28,527
Well, I wear glasses
when I really want to see.

312
00:40:28,605 --> 00:40:30,596
Get them. Come on.

313
00:40:35,712 --> 00:40:38,203
Come on.
Right down the hall.

314
00:40:40,784 --> 00:40:43,252
<i>The walker was
swingin' along easier now</i>

315
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,651
<i>Not even like I needed it</i>

316
00:40:45,455 --> 00:40:47,616
<i>Damn. This here Jack was a nut</i>

317
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:50,349
<i>Maybe I was nuts. Too</i>

318
00:40:50,427 --> 00:40:52,657
<i>but there was
an adventure goin' on</i>

319
00:40:52,729 --> 00:40:53,821
It's in here.

320
00:41:00,504 --> 00:41:01,562
In here.

321
00:41:13,283 --> 00:41:14,614
That's it?

322
00:41:14,684 --> 00:41:18,245
We're investigating a scuttling in the hall,
trying to figure out who attacked you,

323
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:21,154
and you bring me here to look
at stick pictures on the shit house wall?

324
00:41:21,224 --> 00:41:22,748
Look close.

325
00:41:42,245 --> 00:41:43,405
It's Egyptian.

326
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,879
Right-a-reen-o.

327
00:41:44,948 --> 00:41:48,884
Hey, you're not as stupid
as some folks made you out.

328
00:41:48,952 --> 00:41:53,912
- Thank you.
- Now, I copied this down yesterday.

329
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:58,518
I came in here to take a shit because
they hadn't cleaned up my bathroom.

330
00:41:58,595 --> 00:42:01,928
Saw that on the wall,
took it back to my room,

331
00:42:01,998 --> 00:42:04,694
looked it up in my books,
and I wrote it all down.

332
00:42:04,768 --> 00:42:10,764
Now, this top line
translates roughly into,

333
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:14,675
"Pharaoh gobbles donkey goobers."

334
00:42:14,744 --> 00:42:19,238
And the bottom line,
"Cleopatra does the nasty."

335
00:42:19,316 --> 00:42:20,374
Say what?

336
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,180
Well, pretty much.
That's the best I can translate it.

337
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:27,779
All right, so, one of the nuts in here...
present company excluded...

338
00:42:27,858 --> 00:42:30,691
thinks he's Tutankhamen,
comes in here, writes hieroglyphics.

339
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,854
Big deal! What's the connection?
Why are we standin' here in the toilet?

340
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,331
Well, I don't know what
the connection is, exactly... not yet.

341
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,995
But that thing
caught me asleep last night.

342
00:42:41,071 --> 00:42:43,562
And I came awake just in time.

343
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,369
He had me on the floor.

344
00:42:45,442 --> 00:42:49,139
I had his mouth over my asshole.

345
00:42:49,212 --> 00:42:50,372
A shit-eater?

346
00:42:50,447 --> 00:42:51,937
I don't think so.

347
00:42:52,015 --> 00:42:54,745
He was after my soul.

348
00:42:54,818 --> 00:42:58,686
Now, you can get that out of any
major orifice of a person's body.

349
00:42:58,755 --> 00:42:59,813
I read about it.

350
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,949
<i>Yeah? Where, man? Hustler?</i>

351
00:43:02,025 --> 00:43:05,961
<i>The Everyday Man Or Woman's
Book of the Soul by David Webb.</i>

352
00:43:06,029 --> 00:43:08,259
And they got pretty good
movie reviews in there

353
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:11,266
about stolen soul movies
in the back.

354
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:13,359
Come on. I'll show you.

355
00:44:12,662 --> 00:44:17,224
I think that there might be some sort
of electrical problem in the gardener's shed.

356
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,235
That light...
looks like it's shortin' out.

357
00:44:20,303 --> 00:44:22,897
This whole damn place is fallin' apart.

358
00:44:22,973 --> 00:44:25,134
But you don't have to think about that.

359
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:28,200
Mrs. Biddlestein is waitin'
on her enema.

360
00:44:29,245 --> 00:44:32,146
All right. All right. I'm comin'.

361
00:44:34,184 --> 00:44:37,244
Just let me finish my cigarette, first.

362
00:44:38,188 --> 00:44:39,348
God.

363
00:45:31,274 --> 00:45:32,969
Here's an ugly son of a bitch.

364
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:45,313
Damn! Hey, Jack.

365
00:45:45,388 --> 00:45:48,551
What it says here
is that you can bury some dude,

366
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:53,619
and if he gets the right tanna leaves
and spells said over him and such bullshit,

367
00:45:53,696 --> 00:45:57,029
that he can come back to life
thousands of years later, man.

368
00:45:57,767 --> 00:45:58,825
But hold on, now.

369
00:45:58,902 --> 00:46:02,668
To stay alive, he has to suck
on the souls of the livin',

370
00:46:02,739 --> 00:46:06,402
and that if the souls are small,
his life force doesn't last long.

371
00:46:07,177 --> 00:46:09,338
Small.
What's that mean?

372
00:46:09,412 --> 00:46:11,903
Read on.
No, never mind.

373
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:13,642
I'll tell you myself.

374
00:46:14,384 --> 00:46:17,182
But first,
would you like a Ding Dong?

375
00:46:18,588 --> 00:46:20,078
I don't mean mine.

376
00:46:20,957 --> 00:46:22,618
I mean a chocolate Ding Dong.

377
00:46:23,493 --> 00:46:26,951
Of course, mine would be chocolate
now that I have been dyed.

378
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,554
You got Ding Dongs, man?

379
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:32,691
I got Paydays
and I got a box of Baby Ruths.

380
00:46:32,769 --> 00:46:34,100
Oh, mama!

381
00:46:35,939 --> 00:46:39,534
Which will it be?
Let's get decadent.

382
00:46:40,543 --> 00:46:41,805
I'll take a Baby Ruth.

383
00:46:44,547 --> 00:46:46,014
All right.

384
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:51,218
Now... small souls...

385
00:46:52,255 --> 00:46:55,918
are those that don't have
much fire for life.

386
00:46:55,992 --> 00:46:57,459
You know a place like that?

387
00:46:57,527 --> 00:47:01,520
Man, if souls were fires,
they couldn't burn much lower than in here.

388
00:47:01,598 --> 00:47:03,361
Exactamundo.

389
00:47:03,433 --> 00:47:08,769
What we have here at Shady Rest
is an Egyptian soul sucker of some sort.

390
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:11,329
You know, a mummy hiding out.

391
00:47:11,407 --> 00:47:14,899
Coming in here,
feeding on the sleeping.

392
00:47:14,978 --> 00:47:17,139
It's perfect, you see?

393
00:47:17,213 --> 00:47:20,876
We're small souls,
so we can't provide him much.

394
00:47:21,551 --> 00:47:25,954
But if that thing comes back
two or three times in a row

395
00:47:26,022 --> 00:47:30,721
and wraps his lips
around some elder's asshole,

396
00:47:30,793 --> 00:47:34,524
that elder is going to die pretty soon.

397
00:47:34,597 --> 00:47:36,963
And who would be the wiser?

398
00:47:56,953 --> 00:47:58,284
Asshole.

399
00:48:00,323 --> 00:48:03,690
A mummy can't be getting
too much energy from all this...

400
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,890
not like with big souls...
but the prey is easy.

401
00:48:08,431 --> 00:48:12,925
With new people comin' all the time, he can
keep this up forever... this soul robbin'.

402
00:48:13,002 --> 00:48:14,731
That's what they
brought us here for...

403
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:17,398
to get us out of the way
until we die.

404
00:48:17,473 --> 00:48:23,309
And those who don't die first from
disease or just plain being old, he gets.

405
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,714
Look, that's all well and good, Jack,
but there's one thing that still throws me.

406
00:48:28,818 --> 00:48:32,914
How does an ancient Egyptian
wind up in an East Texas rest home,

407
00:48:32,989 --> 00:48:36,220
and why is he writin'
on the shit house walls, man?

408
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:38,783
Well, he went in to take a crap,

409
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:41,728
got bored,
started writing on the walls.

410
00:48:41,798 --> 00:48:45,199
He probably wrote
on pyramid walls centuries ago.

411
00:48:45,268 --> 00:48:48,237
Come on. What would he crap?
It's not like he'd eat.

412
00:48:48,304 --> 00:48:50,465
Well, he eats souls.

413
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,306
So, I assume
that he would crap soul residue.

414
00:48:54,377 --> 00:48:58,279
By that, I would mean
that if you die from his mouth,

415
00:48:58,348 --> 00:49:01,340
you don't go to the other side
where the souls go.

416
00:49:01,417 --> 00:49:06,514
He digests souls
until they don't exist anymore.

417
00:49:06,589 --> 00:49:10,423
And you're just so much
toilet water decoration.

418
00:49:10,493 --> 00:49:12,859
And speaking of toilets...

419
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:16,387
This is how I figured
that whole thing out.

420
00:49:17,267 --> 00:49:20,498
He's just like anybody else
when it comes to taking a dump.

421
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:23,061
He wants a nice,
clean place with a flush.

422
00:49:23,139 --> 00:49:24,970
They didn't have that in his time.

423
00:49:48,865 --> 00:49:50,924
No, no.
Don't go out in the hall.

424
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,800
- That's all right. I'm not asleep.
- That don't mean he won't hurt you.

425
00:49:54,871 --> 00:49:58,432
"He" my ass. There isn't
any mummy from Egypt.

426
00:50:02,478 --> 00:50:04,537
Nice knowin' you, Elvis.

427
00:52:26,556 --> 00:52:27,716
Asshole.

428
00:53:35,124 --> 00:53:38,457
<i>Kemosabe was dead of a ruptured heart
before he hit the floor</i>

429
00:53:41,264 --> 00:53:43,755
<i>Gone down and out
with both guns blazing</i>

430
00:53:44,467 --> 00:53:46,867
<i>Soul intact</i>

431
00:53:50,973 --> 00:53:53,237
<i>Once again. We got scolded</i>

432
00:53:55,311 --> 00:53:58,246
<i>This time. We got quizzed about
what had happened to Kemosabe.</i>

433
00:53:58,314 --> 00:54:00,714
<i>But neitherof us told the truth</i>

434
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:04,479
<i>I mean. Who was gonna believe
a couple of nuts?</i>

435
00:54:05,755 --> 00:54:07,586
<i>Elvis and Jack Kennedy explaining</i>

436
00:54:07,657 --> 00:54:10,717
<i>that Kemosabe was gunning
fora mummy in cowboy duds?</i>

437
00:54:10,793 --> 00:54:13,455
<i>Some kind of Bubba Ho-Tep?</i>

438
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:16,129
<i>So. What we did was</i>

439
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:18,827
<i>we lied</i>

440
00:55:03,279 --> 00:55:05,110
Life sure is fleetin', you know?

441
00:55:05,181 --> 00:55:08,514
- What?
- Life. I'm saying it's fleetin'.

442
00:55:08,584 --> 00:55:11,246
One minute you're here,
and the next minute you're gone...

443
00:55:13,122 --> 00:55:15,283
Shit! Shit! Come on!

444
00:55:17,226 --> 00:55:19,558
Come on. Move it!
Come on. Get it!

445
00:55:23,766 --> 00:55:25,427
Nonchalant. Nonchalant.

446
00:55:25,501 --> 00:55:26,559
Nonchalant.

447
00:55:27,603 --> 00:55:28,763
Get it in there.

448
00:55:31,107 --> 00:55:32,938
You are one fuckin' idiot.

449
00:56:01,137 --> 00:56:02,297
Mr. Haff?

450
00:56:04,974 --> 00:56:06,703
Mr. Presley?

451
00:56:11,147 --> 00:56:14,480
Now, how, Mr Pres ey

452
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:19,283
You are looking much stronger,
but you shouldn't be out here too long.

453
00:56:19,355 --> 00:56:21,118
It's time for your nap.

454
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:25,718
And it's also time for us to do
that little... you know.

455
00:56:25,795 --> 00:56:27,922
You fuck off,
you patronizing bitch!

456
00:56:29,665 --> 00:56:33,658
I'm sick of your shit! I'll lube
my own crankshaft from now on.

457
00:56:36,038 --> 00:56:37,528
You treat me like a baby again,

458
00:56:37,606 --> 00:56:40,268
I'll wrap this goddamn walker
right around your head!

459
00:57:14,243 --> 00:57:16,177
How in the hell
did that mummy do that?

460
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:49,341
Well... what the hell.

461
00:58:36,025 --> 00:58:37,959
Where did old Bubba Ho-Tep go?

462
00:58:39,595 --> 00:58:41,085
Where did he come from?

463
00:58:43,032 --> 00:58:44,761
How the hell did he get here?

464
00:58:48,704 --> 00:58:50,035
Wait a minute.

465
00:59:10,492 --> 00:59:12,983
<i>Under the bridge
I saw him under the bridge</i>

466
00:59:47,029 --> 00:59:48,189
Come on, mama.

467
01:00:20,562 --> 01:00:21,722
<i>It's a cancer</i>

468
01:00:22,598 --> 01:00:26,034
<i>They're keepin' it from me 'cause I'm old.
And to them. It don't matter</i>

469
01:00:26,101 --> 01:00:28,763
<i>They think age will kill me first.
And they're probably right</i>

470
01:00:28,837 --> 01:00:29,997
<i>We, succk them</i>

471
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:33,065
<i>I know what it is.
And if it isn't</i>

472
01:00:33,142 --> 01:00:34,473
<i>it might as well be</i>

473
01:01:32,434 --> 01:01:38,430
<i>Station KROP is proud to present
the Elvis Presley movie marathon</i>

474
01:01:42,344 --> 01:01:46,838
<i>It's 24 hours of Elvis
in the roles he made famous</i>

475
01:01:46,915 --> 01:01:51,181
<i>Watch that two-fisted Hound Dog
out-strum. Outrace.</i>

476
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:54,586
<i>Out-fight. And outwit the bad guys</i>

477
01:01:55,824 --> 01:02:01,091
<i>And at the same time.
Watch the King slay the girls</i>

478
01:02:04,466 --> 01:02:05,865
Shitty pictures, man.

479
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:08,266
Every single one.

480
01:02:11,306 --> 01:02:14,798
<i>Here I was complainin' about
loss of pride and how life had treated me.</i>

481
01:02:14,877 --> 01:02:18,313
<i>And now I realized
I never had any pride</i>

482
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,712
<i>And much of how life
had treated me had been good</i>

483
01:02:20,783 --> 01:02:23,115
<i>The bulk of the bad
was my own damn fault</i>

484
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:27,853
<i>Should've fired Colonel Parker
by the time I got in the pictures</i>

485
01:02:27,923 --> 01:02:29,652
<i>Old fart had been a shark and a fool.</i>

486
01:02:29,725 --> 01:02:32,057
<i>And I was an even bigger fool
for following him</i>

487
01:02:33,429 --> 01:02:35,420
<i>If only I'd treated Priscilla right</i>

488
01:02:36,899 --> 01:02:39,026
<i>If I could've told
my daughter I loved her</i>

489
01:02:40,502 --> 01:02:43,335
<i>Always the questions
Never the answers</i>

490
01:02:43,405 --> 01:02:46,897
<i>Always the hopes
never the fulfillments</i>

491
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:57,580
I had the woman who calls herself
my niece come get me.

492
01:02:57,653 --> 01:03:00,816
She took me downtown this morning
to the newspaper morgue.

493
01:03:00,889 --> 01:03:03,357
She's been helping me
to do some research.

494
01:03:04,293 --> 01:03:07,126
- Research on what, man?
- On our mummy.

495
01:03:07,196 --> 01:03:08,857
You know somethin' about him?

496
01:03:08,931 --> 01:03:10,990
I know plenty.

497
01:03:13,402 --> 01:03:16,803
Now, one of the lesser mummies,

498
01:03:16,872 --> 01:03:19,466
on loan from the Egyptian government,

499
01:03:19,541 --> 01:03:22,601
was being circulated
all over the United States.

500
01:03:22,678 --> 01:03:24,236
You know, museums,
stuff like that.

501
01:03:24,313 --> 01:03:26,338
What do you mean?
Like King Tut or whatever?

502
01:03:26,415 --> 01:03:28,212
No, more like King Tut's brother.

503
01:03:28,283 --> 01:03:32,652
His mummy was flown or carried
by the train from state to state.

504
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:35,315
When it got to Texas,
it was stolen.

505
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:36,379
Stolen?

506
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:41,225
Evidence points to it being stolen at night
by a couple of guys in a silver bus.

507
01:03:41,296 --> 01:03:44,026
Bus? Hey, I've seen that!

508
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:46,329
Anyway, the thieves
broke into the museum,

509
01:03:46,401 --> 01:03:49,336
stole it in hopes of a ransom,

510
01:03:49,404 --> 01:03:54,273
when in comes the worst storm
in East Texas history.

511
01:03:55,244 --> 01:03:56,336
Let me guess.

512
01:03:57,312 --> 01:03:59,303
The bus was washed away, see?

513
01:03:59,381 --> 01:04:02,544
'Cause I think I saw it today.
It was way back in the creek.

514
01:04:02,618 --> 01:04:05,451
The mummy was imprisoned
by the debris.

515
01:04:06,355 --> 01:04:08,414
Look here...
how'd it come back to life?

516
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:10,890
And how did I end up
inside its memories?

517
01:04:10,959 --> 01:04:13,792
Speculation broadens here,
but from what I've read,

518
01:04:13,862 --> 01:04:16,695
some mummies get buried
without their names...

519
01:04:16,765 --> 01:04:19,063
a curse put on their sarcophagus.

520
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:23,429
Hey, now, maybe our boy's
one of them.

521
01:04:23,505 --> 01:04:27,669
I mean, when he's in the coffin,
he's just a dried-up old corpse,

522
01:04:27,743 --> 01:04:30,974
but when the bus got washed away,
maybe it overturned or broke open,

523
01:04:31,046 --> 01:04:33,037
and now he's free of coffin and curse.

524
01:04:33,115 --> 01:04:37,484
He's free from imprisonment,
but he still needs souls.

525
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,451
Now he's free to have them.

526
01:04:39,521 --> 01:04:43,719
He can just keep on feedin'
unless he's finally destroyed.

527
01:04:46,562 --> 01:04:48,052
So, what do we do, Jack?

528
01:04:49,398 --> 01:04:52,196
Changing rest homes
might be a good idea.

529
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:53,894
I can't think of much else.

530
01:04:53,969 --> 01:04:55,960
But I will say this...

531
01:04:56,038 --> 01:04:59,701
Our mummy is
a nighttime kind of guy.

532
01:04:59,775 --> 01:05:02,972
So, I'm gonna go and sleep now.

533
01:05:03,045 --> 01:05:05,411
I'll set my alarm
for just before dark,

534
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,108
then I can get myself
a couple of cups of coffee.

535
01:05:08,784 --> 01:05:10,046
Damn straight.

536
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:13,849
If he comes in here tonight, I don't
want him slappin' his lips on my asshole.

537
01:05:13,922 --> 01:05:16,288
Yes. Consider it.

538
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:22,025
He's got the proverbial
bird's nest on the ground here.

539
01:05:40,749 --> 01:05:43,684
<i>What do I really have
left in life but this place?</i>

540
01:05:48,257 --> 01:05:49,986
<i>It ain't much of a home</i>

541
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:52,717
<i>but it's all I got</i>

542
01:05:58,066 --> 01:05:59,465
Well, goddamnit.

543
01:06:00,802 --> 01:06:05,865
I'll be damned if I let some foreign,
graffiti-writin', soul-suckin',

544
01:06:05,941 --> 01:06:09,274
son of a bitch in an oversized
cowboy hat and boots

545
01:06:09,344 --> 01:06:13,178
take my friends' souls and shit 'em
down the visitors toilet!

546
01:06:19,288 --> 01:06:22,121
<i>In the movies.
I always played heroic types</i>

547
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:23,623
<i>But when the stage lights went out.</i>

548
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:27,355
<i>It was time fordrugs and stupidity
and the coveting of women</i>

549
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:29,893
<i>Now it's time</i>

550
01:06:29,965 --> 01:06:33,696
<i>Time to be a little of what I
had always fantasized bein'...</i>

551
01:06:33,769 --> 01:06:35,100
<i>a hero</i>

552
01:06:47,516 --> 01:06:48,574
Hello?

553
01:06:49,318 --> 01:06:51,286
Mr. Kennedy?

554
01:06:51,353 --> 01:06:53,617
Ask not what your rest home
can do for you.

555
01:06:54,656 --> 01:06:57,022
Ask what you can do
for your rest home.

556
01:06:57,092 --> 01:07:00,755
Hey, you're copying my best lines.

557
01:07:00,829 --> 01:07:03,093
Then let me paraphrase
one of my own.

558
01:07:04,032 --> 01:07:06,023
Let's take care of business.

559
01:07:06,568 --> 01:07:09,435
Just what are you
getting at, Elvis?

560
01:07:09,504 --> 01:07:11,699
I think you know
what I'm gettin' at, Mr. President.

561
01:07:13,241 --> 01:07:14,731
We're gonna kill us a mummy.

562
01:07:27,656 --> 01:07:30,056
Two bottles of rubbing alcohol.

563
01:07:31,193 --> 01:07:33,821
Check.
Don't even have to toss 'em.

564
01:07:33,895 --> 01:07:35,385
Look here.

565
01:07:35,464 --> 01:07:37,898
Found this in the storage room.

566
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:39,998
I thought they kept it locked.

567
01:07:40,068 --> 01:07:42,866
They do. I stole a hairpin
and picked the lock, baby.

568
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:44,235
Great.

569
01:07:44,306 --> 01:07:45,398
Matches.

570
01:07:46,174 --> 01:07:48,836
Check. Even scrounged up
a cigarette lighter.

571
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:52,413
Good. Uniform.

572
01:07:57,185 --> 01:07:59,016
Big check on that, baby.

573
01:08:00,455 --> 01:08:05,620
Well, I got a nice pair of shoes
to go with this.

574
01:08:05,694 --> 01:08:06,752
Check.

575
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:09,957
Scissors.

576
01:08:10,031 --> 01:08:11,259
Check.

577
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:13,525
All right.

578
01:08:13,602 --> 01:08:16,969
Now, I got my chair
oiled and ready to roll.

579
01:08:17,572 --> 01:08:19,597
That's good, man.
We could use some wheels.

580
01:08:19,674 --> 01:08:23,508
And I picked some words of power
from my book of magic.

581
01:08:23,578 --> 01:08:25,307
I don't know
if they'll stop a mummy,

582
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,712
but they're supposed
to ward off evil.

583
01:08:28,383 --> 01:08:31,284
I wrote them down.
One for each of us.

584
01:08:31,353 --> 01:08:33,344
Well, we'll use what we got, baby.

585
01:08:34,222 --> 01:08:36,690
All right, 2:45 a.m.,
we hook up right back here.

586
01:08:36,758 --> 01:08:41,024
No, at the rate we travel,
maybe we ought to start at 2:30.

587
01:08:43,832 --> 01:08:44,890
Say, Jack?

588
01:08:47,002 --> 01:08:48,663
Do we know
what the hell we're doin', man?

589
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:54,707
No. But they say
that fire cleanses evil.

590
01:08:54,776 --> 01:08:58,371
Let's just hope that they...
whoever they are... is right.

591
01:08:58,447 --> 01:09:00,005
Check on that, too.

592
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:01,639
All right, synchronize watches.

593
01:09:01,716 --> 01:09:04,947
And... mark.

594
01:09:05,921 --> 01:09:10,756
Now, the two key words for tonight
are "caution" and "flammable."

595
01:09:10,826 --> 01:09:14,318
And also...
"watch your ass."

596
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,131
What's that you got
hanging around your neck?

597
01:10:26,401 --> 01:10:28,164
That's my medicine bag.

598
01:10:28,236 --> 01:10:30,170
Indians used to wear 'em into battle.

599
01:10:31,306 --> 01:10:33,274
Full of all kinds of lucky stuff.

600
01:10:34,409 --> 01:10:37,469
See here?
Mucho mojo.

601
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:46,580
That's my daughter.

602
01:10:49,858 --> 01:10:51,257
I know.

603
01:10:53,929 --> 01:10:57,490
We weren't there for our kids
when they needed us, were we?

604
01:11:00,735 --> 01:11:02,726
Man, if I could just talk to her again...

605
01:11:04,005 --> 01:11:05,165
tell her I love her...

606
01:11:06,608 --> 01:11:08,667
try and make things right somehow.

607
01:11:09,911 --> 01:11:11,902
No time for regrets, Elvis.

608
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:15,177
We were the best fathers we could be
under the circumstances.

609
01:11:17,419 --> 01:11:19,580
Yeah, I guess,
no time for regrets.

610
01:11:20,922 --> 01:11:22,583
We got business to take care of.

611
01:11:22,657 --> 01:11:25,353
Look here.
Top it off with this.

612
01:11:25,427 --> 01:11:27,759
I stole it from the gardener
when he wasn't lookin'.

613
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:35,465
It's gonna be
one hell of a barbeque.

614
01:11:45,347 --> 01:11:46,746
Let's do it, amigo.

615
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:52,577
Hey, Jack?

616
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:58,183
I just got one last question.

617
01:12:00,462 --> 01:12:01,520
Marilyn.

618
01:12:04,699 --> 01:12:07,031
Come on, man.
Marilyn Monroe?

619
01:12:07,936 --> 01:12:09,927
What was she like in the sack?

620
01:12:10,905 --> 01:12:14,068
That is classified information.
Top secret!

621
01:12:15,644 --> 01:12:17,305
But between you and me...

622
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,540
Wow!

623
01:12:23,818 --> 01:12:25,911
You old dog.
Watch your back, Jack.

624
01:12:31,626 --> 01:12:32,786
Gotta hump it.

625
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:27,947
<i>Shitwhen Bubba Ho-Tep
comes out of that creek bed.</i>

626
01:13:28,016 --> 01:13:30,075
<i>He's gonna come out
hungry and pissed</i>

627
01:13:30,151 --> 01:13:32,813
<i>When I try and stop him. He's gonna
jam this paint can up my ass</i>

628
01:13:32,887 --> 01:13:35,219
<i>and jam me and that wheelchair
up Jack's ass</i>

629
01:14:19,334 --> 01:14:20,892
Shit.

630
01:14:28,777 --> 01:14:29,971
Hey, Jack.

631
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:46,550
Don't make me use
my stuff on you, baby.

632
01:16:30,131 --> 01:16:32,691
Damn!
Where did he go to?

633
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,267
Hey! You stay put!

634
01:16:37,972 --> 01:16:39,303
I'll flush him out!

635
01:16:42,043 --> 01:16:43,635
You be careful, man.

636
01:16:52,186 --> 01:16:53,175
No, Jack!

637
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:26,478
Oh, man.

638
01:18:03,257 --> 01:18:06,920
Come and get it,
you undead sack of shit.

639
01:18:32,453 --> 01:18:33,613
Sorry, man.

640
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:03,710
Mr. Kennedy?

641
01:19:10,224 --> 01:19:14,661
The President is soon dead.

642
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:24,900
So, now...
it's up to you, Elvis.

643
01:19:24,972 --> 01:19:27,406
You got to get him.

644
01:19:27,475 --> 01:19:31,707
You... got to...

645
01:19:31,779 --> 01:19:33,610
take care of business.

646
01:19:50,531 --> 01:19:51,691
That's right, man.

647
01:19:53,501 --> 01:19:54,991
T.C. B...

648
01:19:57,271 --> 01:19:58,602
It's just you and me.

649
01:20:17,592 --> 01:20:18,752
Mr. President.

650
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,081
"You nasty thing
from beyond the dead...

651
01:20:44,252 --> 01:20:49,417
"No matter what you think or do,
good things will never come to you.

652
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:55,924
"And if evil
is your black design,

653
01:20:55,997 --> 01:21:00,661
"you can bet the goodness
of the Light Ones...

654
01:21:00,735 --> 01:21:03,863
will kick your bad behind"?

655
01:21:04,906 --> 01:21:06,567
For chrissake...

656
01:21:06,641 --> 01:21:07,801
That's it?

657
01:21:09,877 --> 01:21:12,778
<i>That's the chant against evil
from the Book Of Souls?</i>

658
01:21:12,847 --> 01:21:14,109
Yeah, right, boss.

659
01:21:14,182 --> 01:21:16,673
And what kind of decoder ring
comes with that, man?

660
01:21:16,751 --> 01:21:19,049
Shit, it doesn't even nyme well!

661
01:21:46,814 --> 01:21:48,213
This is dog shit.

662
01:21:53,087 --> 01:21:55,817
It's time for A-C-T-l-O-N.

663
01:21:58,025 --> 01:22:00,186
Come on, baby.
Here we go.

664
01:23:18,539 --> 01:23:19,938
<i>I was goin' out</i>

665
01:23:20,708 --> 01:23:23,643
<i>And if I did. Rhot only would I be
one dead son of a bitch.</i>

666
01:23:23,711 --> 01:23:24,871
<i>But so would my soul</i>

667
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,711
<i>I'd be just so much crap</i>

668
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:32,315
<i>No afterlife. Rho reincarnation.
Rho angels with harps</i>

669
01:23:33,054 --> 01:23:35,614
<i>Whatever lay beyond
would not be known to me</i>

670
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:39,020
<i>It would all end right here
for Elvis Aaron Presley</i>

671
01:23:39,694 --> 01:23:41,753
<i>Nothin' left but a quick flush</i>

672
01:23:45,966 --> 01:23:47,456
T.C.B., baby.

673
01:23:56,744 --> 01:23:59,872
Your soul-suckin' days
are over, amigo.

674
01:24:57,204 --> 01:25:00,605
<i>I felt somethin' inside
gratin' against somethin' soft</i>

675
01:25:01,642 --> 01:25:04,577
<i>I felt like a water balloon
with a hole poked in it</i>

676
01:25:07,381 --> 01:25:09,542
<i>I was goin' down for the last count</i>

677
01:25:10,651 --> 01:25:11,811
<i>And I knew it</i>

678
01:25:14,255 --> 01:25:16,086
But I still have my soul.

679
01:25:18,259 --> 01:25:19,658
It's still mine.

680
01:25:21,195 --> 01:25:22,594
All mine.

681
01:25:27,134 --> 01:25:30,399
And the folks up there
at Shady Rest...

682
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:33,930
they have theirs, too.

683
01:25:35,576 --> 01:25:37,066
And they're gonna keep 'em.

684
01:25:38,946 --> 01:25:40,436
Every single one.

685
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:10,370
Thank you.

686
01:26:13,147 --> 01:26:14,978
Thank you very much.
