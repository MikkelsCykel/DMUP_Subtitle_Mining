What you gotta do is beg for little mercy.

5
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,800
Begging you would be like swallowing penis for eternity!

6
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,500
Come on, give it up!

7
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Got it.

8
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,900
Come on, Eddie!

Oh, shit

13
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, hey is that the best you can do?

14
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
You better phone for help.

15
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,300
Get him, Eddie!

16
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Come on Eddie, hit him.

17
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,600
Hurt him real bad.

18
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,800
Scumbag, faggot

19
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,600
Stop it Eddie!
Leave something for the garbage man.

20
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,600
I hate that cheap punk. What da fuck he thinks he's coming from?

21
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,500
You ripped him real bad this time, Eddie.

22
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,400
nothing left of him

23
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,400
It's the third time.
You think that son of a bitch will learn by <? missing ?> trying me?

24
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,500
Oh, wow <? ?>

26
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,300
Come on!

27
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,800
Hey, we ca-can't just leave him laying out there.

28
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
He might be dying out there.

29
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,800
He hates help. Piss on you, if he could. Fuck him.

30
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That guy's been gone for some time.

31
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,200
He was <?scaled?> last night. He might be a few steps slow.
He'll be back.

32
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,000
I am starving.

33
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
<?He ought to be close ?> to the place.
I say he's ok.

34
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,400
What's ok about him?
He's like a wet rat in the rain.

35
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,600
Rat without any teeth.

36
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,700
Red hell. He refuses to join <? the outrage ?>. He drinks and he waits.

37
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,000
I hope he doesn't wait for that sandwich to deliver itself.

38
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,500
Now look! 20 bucks for that kind of head is outrageous.

39
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,500
I did you good, old fart.
I did you good.

40
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,600
I picked your champaigne cork off.

41
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,500
I'm giving you 15 bucks.

42
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,400
20 bucks!

43
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,100
Nobody in this neighbourhood can swallow penis like I can.

44
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,100
Oh, shit.

45
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:02,800

46
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Oh, beautiful. Uhuu.

48
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,500
Good to see ya Henry.

49
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,700
yeah!, good to see you walk in here.

50
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:28,400
Hey, all of a sudden I'm so popular.
Maybe I gotta run for city council.

51
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,600
Aah, keep the change.

52
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
All of it?

53
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Yeah, go ahead have all.

54
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,200
What do you drink?

55
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,300
Almost everything.

56
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Give him a scotch and water.

57
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,100
Who the hell invented the sandwich?

58
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,100
They ought to write a book about him.

59
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,800
Henry, you've got to stop fighting Eddie.

60
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,400
<? You have no ?> reason, that's why you lose every fight.

61
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,400
I can whip him without a reason,
because I've got the guts.

62
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,100
Hey, I've got the guts.

63
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,100
But the guts need fuel.

64
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
Eeh, what the hell?

65
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Hmm, ham.
It's ham with mustard and radish.

66
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
He's a goddamn rat-thief.

67
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
That was <? unright ?>

68
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,500
I've gotta cream you good!

69
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,400
All I need is a litte fuel, that's all I need to be better.

70
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,000
You <? did the ?> line there, Henry!
<? You can't ?> man's food like that.

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,100
He's like a goddamned seagull!!

72
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Here's for the drinks.<? for  here ?> it's disgusting.

73
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,000
(from background) Have a nice day guys. hahaha.

74
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,300
Henry, you want to go to your room and lay down for a few hours.

75
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,100
Frankly, I'm sick of looking to your face.

76
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:07,100
Have a drink Jim.
Come on, on the <? cuff ?>, one on the house.

77
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,800
I think the last time you've ever paid for a drink is the first time.

78
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,100
Jim.

79
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:29,000
- See you tonight, over here?
- See you tonight.

80
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,800
I don't see what you see in that guy.

81
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,500
He's as right as any of us.

82
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:26,000
I've got to have the money tomorrow morning by 9 o'clock
or I'll be thrown out of my room and you're gonna be in trouble and I'm gonna be in trouble.

83
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And we've both gonna be in trouble. You understand that?

84
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,800
Fuel.

85
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:18,500
Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lifes they must live.

88
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,200
We continue now with the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. His <? Disuldante Jubilante ?>

Young man like you, drunk every day at noon. Got yourself a job!

94
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,400
- I have one
- Oh, Really?

95
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Yeah, killing the cockroaches in that place of yours.

96
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,800
Son of a bitch. Kiss my tuck ass.

97
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,300

Hey boy! Fetch me a draft.

101
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,500
Some guys really know how to get the women.

102
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,100
You don't know how?

103
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:40,500
Eh, I can get one for ten minutes.
<? That's my limit. ?>

104
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,300
Hey.

105

Be back in seconds.

108
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,600
I hear a voice down there, but sure I don't see much.

109
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Seems like, that beat I gave you last night, must have rattled your bells, nah?

110
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,100
Remember ordering a draft barkeep. <? ?> finally taken home?

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Yeah, it's definitely him. all right?
So what you wanna do?

114
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Well, I'm not sure that you wanna come down here right now.

115
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,000
Fuck you once a night!!

116
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
<? Look at him, you're man or boy? ?>
I've got a full tank of fuel.

117
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,600
You've got to pay for that goddamned beer.

118
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,900
Eddie, come on I want to tell you something.

119
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,900
- Come here, I want you to hear it good.
- Hear what?

120
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,300
Your mother's cunt stinks like carpet cleaner.

121
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,300
That's it, fuck! Come on!

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:21,300
How 'bout you?

129
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
- How about you?
- Yeah, I'll take 10 bucks for that.

130
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,900
You're on.

131
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,600
Hey Jim, maybe I can't.

132
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:36,300
Your life is just a points of can'ts.
You can't work, you can't fuck and you can't fight.

133
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,500
- I'm still putting up ten in taken 3 to 1.
- You're on it.

134
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,000
- You cover for Eddie?
- Absolutely.

135
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'd like to get ahold of your ten.

139
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
- You've got him?
- Got him.

140
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,700
Oh, man.

141
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Ten, twenty,...

142
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,900
Oh, Eddie. Eddie, what that bastard did you?

143
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,700
Fucking almost killed me.

144
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,700
Hey, man. Give me a draft.

145
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,000
No, no.

146
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm sorry man, I can't serve you.

147
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,300
Yo, Henry.

148
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,300
Look Henry, take this. Eddie <? ?> through his blood, but he paid up.

149
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,500
Come on, take it. You've earned your <? ?> watch.

150
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Ey, I can't take the money, Jim. Suppose I'd lost.

151
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,900
You buy alot of drinks for this, slugger.

152
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,100
As you put it that way, I'll take a couple of scotch and waters.

153
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,200
You should take some more.

154
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,000
Hey, what do you think I am? A bum?

155
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,500
- Thanx Jim.
- You've been not eating anything for a while. It might turn to something dangerous.

156
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,900
Hey. Give me a beer.

157
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,600
- Christ, who's that one?
- Who?

158
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:57,200
That woman. She looks like a kind of distressed goddess.

159
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,700
- Oh, Wanda
- Wanda?

160
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,500
Hey tell me man. This Wanda she looks pretty good.

161
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,300
- How come nobody sits next to her?
- She's crazy.

162
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,000
Crazy? Oh.

163
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,600
I can't stand people.

164
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,600
- I hate them.
- Oh, yeah?

165
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,400
You hate them?

166
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:01,000
No, but I seem to feel better when they're not around.

167
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:09,000
Hey barkeep. Two scotch and waters.

168
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:18,000
May I ask you the same damn think, people are always asking me?

169
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,900
Like?

170
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,700
Like what do you do?

171
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,200
I drink.

172
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,000
- That's it.
- That's what?

173
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm broke. Can't buy another drink.

174
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,600
You mean, you don't have any money?

175
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:01,600
No money. No job. No rent. Hey, I'm back to normal.

176
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Come with me.

177
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,200
Now I have a couple of packs of smokes. <? ?>

178
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,200
- Care for a couple of cigars?
- Yeah.

179
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Couple of good cigars.

180
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,700
And charge it to Rob Revans.

181
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,700
Wanda, I'm gonna have to call Willbur for his ok.

182
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:11,300
Go ahead.

183
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,700
Willbur. Yeah, Wanda has arrived, she's got some stuff.

184
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:26,000
Her total is 23.8. Yeah. Bottles of scotch. Sixpack of beer.

185
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
How did your face get so beat up?

186
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,600
You don't mind, do you?

187
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,800
I think it looks beautiful.

188
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,700
Hey, you little pricks.

189
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,900
Pardon me, Willbur.

190
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Willbur wants to know if your're coming over.

191
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,400
Yeah, she is.

192
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,400
It's ok wanda.

193
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Grab the stuff and follow me. We'll try my place.

194
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Goddamn it!

195
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,000
My place is next, I'm up on the third floor.

196
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,500
Don't worry, there is an elevator.

197
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,300
I love corn.

198
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:21,100
- I'm gonna pick some corn.
- Hey wait, you can't go up there, that's on the open. You'll be seen.

199
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,000
I don't care, I love corn. I'm gonna pick some corn.

200
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
hey. what are you doing?

201
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:44,200
Hey, you're drunk. Baby, look at those ears, they're still young.
They're green, you can't eat that stuff.

202
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,400
Who's Wilbur? Is he your pimp?

203
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,400
I'm no hooker, I don't have a pimp.

204
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,500
Who's the guy?

205
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Wilbur? Just an old guy who cares for me.

206
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,700
Oh shit! It's the cops. Let's go. Which way?

207
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:17,700
Go. Quick. Head for the basement. There.

208
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,500
Goddamn!

209
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,500
Stop! Police! Stay right where you are.

210
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,000
Here!

211
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,500
- Which way?
- This way.

212
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,700
If the elevator isn't at the bottom, we're damned.

213
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,700
Stop or we'll fire!

214
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,600
Hit quickly the three button!

215
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,600
Ah, shit! Get this fucking thing stop.

216
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:54,300
Leave the door open.

217
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,600
<? ?>

218
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,600
- Don't make a sound
- Hey, take your shoes of.

219
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:37,000
- I really wanna get those fuckers.
- And you see that woman? She really <? ?> Great legs.

220
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:08,300
Have they left?

221
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,900
Let's not take a chance.

222
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,900
Let's be quiet for the rest of the night.

223
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
They might be camped down there.

224
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,400
I guess you'll have to stay the night.

225
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,600
Don't you hate cops?

226
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,600
No, but I seem to feel better when they're not around.

227
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:52,400
I sure want to thank you for your hospitality.

228
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:02,100
Just one thing.

229
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,800
I want never fall in love.

230
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,800
I don't wanna go through that. I can't.

231
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,500
Don't worry. Nobody's ever loved me yet.

232
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Oh shit. I told you that stuff is green. Look at it.

233
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
That never works.

234
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
<? ?>

235
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,000
Hey stop it. shhh. hey, be quiet.

236
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,900
The cops might be still out there.

237
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,900
Nothing ever works allright in this life.

238
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's allright.

239
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
- Hey, what the hell was that?
- Same old thing, only it's a little better than TV.

240
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,400
There you go lover.

241
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,400
- Lover?
- Don't you remember?

242
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,000
Aah, but what's this?

243
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,200
<? ?>key.

244
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,500
<? ?>better than one.

<? ?> thing

246
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,500
Yeah?
What you're good at?

247
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Juicy. (phone rings)

248
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,400
Yeah? Oh.

249
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,000
Wilbur. I.. geez. I couldn't make it over last night.

250
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,200
I got <? ?>. I went to bed.

251
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,700
Tonight?

252
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,800
Well, geez, I don't know. Uhm.

253
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,300
Let me think about it.

254
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,300
Helloo. Yeah.

255
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,800
Hey Willbur, how're you doing?

256
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Hey, listen Willbur, you'll call here again, I'm gonna come over.
I <? ?> on your skull.

257
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:58,400
Listen, Willbur be very carefull. Yeah, he's a very jealous man, he's a wrestler.
He drinks beer, sits around all day, farts, lifts weights.

258
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,000
He hung up.

259
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Aaaaah. We really cut off a good source of suply there, Mr. von Builderass

260
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,800
von Builderass? What's that?

261
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,800
It's the way you walk across the room, when you act.

262
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,900
Yeah, you're the <? damnest ?> barfly I've ever seen.

263
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,900
You act like some real blue blood, a royalty.

264
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,700
I wasn't aware of that. Thank you.

265
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,700
- Noticed, that you're class too, baby.
- All right.

266
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,800
I gotta tell you something.

267
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:58,000
If a man came by with a fifth of whiskey, I'm afraid I'd go with him.

268
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,200
I could get a lot of booze out of Willbur. I'm giving up too much.

269
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:13,700
- I don't know about the next.
- Hey, I'm the next.

270
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:19,200
- I'll suply the booze.
- How?

271
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,700
I'll get a job.

272
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:26,700
(laughter)

273
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,300
What happened to you along the way?

274
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,500
You're weird.

275
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:40,500
By the way. The first thing I noticed about you, were your legs.

276
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:45,900
Really?

277
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,500
I guess I got lucky with legs.

278
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,500
It's the brain I was shorter though.

279
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,300
Oh, yeah. Hey.

280
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:09,300
I could look at a woman's legs for hours.

281
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,800
I've got nothin', but time.

282
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,500
- <? ?>crazy.
- That's crazy.

283
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,300
I dunno.

284
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,500
We're all in some kind of hell.

285
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,500
And the madhouse is the only place, where people know they're in hell.

286
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:38,800
I don't know, I'm just a crazy beer drinking wrestler. Let's fart.

287
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:47,700
You ass. You've got anything to pick up at your place?

288
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,400
Yeah, some rags and a radio. Hey, we don't need a moving wan.

289
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Ah, let's go.

290
00:38:52,400 --> 00:39:00,400
But I wanna make myself look good.

291
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,500
Hey Jim, can you hold this stuff for me for a while?

292
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,300
Yeah, sure.

293
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,300
Last time I saw you, you've got nothing neither a woman nor a radio.

294
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,000
Hey, Jim. I'm used to radios.

295
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,500
Wanda, this is Jim. Jim, this is Wanda.

296
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,800
- Hi.
- Hi. Me beer.

297
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,400
Yeah, likewise.

298
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,400
Hey Jim, can you cash this check for me? I signed him.

299
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,400
Hey, what's this?

300
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,800
You're not gonna believe this, but that's an income tax refund.

301
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,300
I found it in the mailbox of the old place.

302
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:03,600
You mean, you worked last year?
Six month in a toy factory. You don't know how men suffer for children.

303
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,900
Hey, Henry. You're gonna buy one or be one.

304
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:11,900
Hey, I'm gonna be one. Give her a beer.

305
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,200
- Yes, sir?
- Shot of bark whiskey, please.

306
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,000
- Hey, old timer. This one's on the house.
- I thank you.

307
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,300
Thanx, Jim.

308

<? ?>Take this.This covers the rent, I'll keep the rest.

00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,400
Why not? It's easier that way.

00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,700
Henry, are you losing what's left of your goddamned mind?

316
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,500
You mean, you gonna leave me here all alone?

317
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,500
All alone? Hey baby, there's Jim, there is Lilly. Come on.

318
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,500
What are you doing with a woman, Henry?

319
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,400
Lilly, sometimes I think you could use one too.

320
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,500
Four whiskeys.

321
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:03,100
Look Hank, why don't you go tomorrow. We just met.

322
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,800
When you ran off like this, I feel you're trying to get away from me.

323
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:14,500
Hey, baby. I'm doing this for us. We're be able to drink with class.

324
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,900
We don't have to be barflies, returned from the grave.

325
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:27,100
- Thank you, bartender.
- Ok, oldtimer.

326
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,600
Hey, he didn't pay.

327
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,600
He already paid.

328
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,900
Oh, god, I will get a job.

329
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,900
Yeah, hey. To the working class. Right.

330
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,500
- To us.
- To us. With gods help.

331
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,000
No chance. Even the devil wouldn't have you.

332
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,100
Hey, what's your problem?

333
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:57,000
Hey, you got any of those little mints for breath?

334
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Oh yeah. Baby.

335
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,500
Excuse me, who are you?

336
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,900
Hmm, the eternal question.

337
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:23,000
The eternal answer: I don't know.

338
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:58,300
- How do you explain this recent unemployment record?
- Hey, anybody didn't get a job.

339
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,600
- Takes some man to make you a hard worker.
- Excuse me?

340
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,600
Hey, I was just joking.

341
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,400
Everything here seems to read 'none'.

342
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:17,200
Hobbies none,  religion none, education none.
Even where they'd ask you sex you put none.

343
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,700
Hardly none. Yeah, you can put down now.

344
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,700
So, how did the job go?

345
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:30,000
Oh, they gave me a hard on. They couldn't use a hard on.

346
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,800
This is a world where everybody's gotta do something.

347
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:40,000
You know somebody laid down this rule, that everybody's gotta do something.
They've gotta be something

348
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:48,000
You know, a dentist, a <? glider ?> pilot, an arc, a janitor, a preacher, all that.

349
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,000
Sometimes, I just get tired of thinking of all the things that I don't wanna do.

350
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:03,000
All things that I don't wanna be.
All places that I don't wanna go, like India, like get my teeth cleaned.

351
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,200
Save the whale, all that. I don't understand that.

352
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,600
You're not supposed to think about it.

353
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:16,600
I think the whole trick is not to think about it.

354
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:25,200
Oh, I guess Wanda went home, huh?

355
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,200
- Henry.
- Yeah?

356
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:40,200
Eddie came in with a fifth of burbon. Tonight's his night of, Ben's working his shift.

357
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,200
I won't miss Eddie tonight.

358
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:51,100
Henry, Wanda left with Eddie.

359
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Huh? What?

360
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
- Jim?
- Yeah?

361
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,800
Scotch and water.

362
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,500
Humanity, you never had it from the beginning.

363
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,800
Hello.

364
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,800
I paid the rent.

365
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,300
Did you get the job?

366
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:00,300
Yeah, I start tomorrow. <? Matred D Musso at Frank's. ?>

367
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Listen, I told you not to leave me alone.

368
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:22,800
- Don't hit me!
- Hit you? I'm not your goddamned pimp.

369
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,400
Stop acting like one.

370
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,400
Why it had to be Eddie?!?!

371
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:37,200
- He symbolizes everything that disgusts me!
- What?

372
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:44,000
Obviousness, unoriginal macho energy.

373
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,000
Ladies man.

374
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
You're right. He's not much.

375
00:48:55,100 --> 00:49:00,100
I made an error, an unhappy error, but I'll drink.

376
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,500
When I drink, I'm moving in a wrong direction.

377
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:09,500
You know, every time I get with a woman, something happens.

378
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,400
Sometimes it happens sooner, sometimes it happens later.

379
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,400
- This time it happened pretty fast.
- <? ?> you don't own me.

380
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Hey, that's right. Nobody owns anybody.

381
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,100
I just thought, that we are something special.

382
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,000
Because we're just green corn.

383
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Hey, what are we? Just people that pass in hallways?

384
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,400
I guess I expect too much.

385
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:46,400
Hey, I can't handle this scene, you know.
I ought to be a fucking monk. Yeah.

386
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,700
(phone rings)

387
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,700
Hello?

388
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Natali Sorensen. I know this sound like I'm a lunetic or something,
but I have this reason why I wish to talk to you.

389
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:31,300
- Well, what you wanna do?
- Well, what can man do with a third rate chipi.

390
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:35,200
- You keep talking like that and I'm leaving.
- I'll open the door for you.

391
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,500
I'll be a gentleman.

392
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,900
Go ahead.

393
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,700
- OK, I'm going.
- Hope, you'll find a live one.

394
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:49,700
You rotten son of a bitch.

395
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:58,500
Oh, baby. Auch. What you...? What do ya...?
Auch, you've got something in there... Aaaauuuuuch

396
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:19,900
I think <? ?> sink. An empty bottle. Euphoria.

397
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Youth fenced in. Stamped. Shaven

398
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:40,300
Tough words. <? ?>

399
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:00,300
Are you Henry Chinaski?

400
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,800
No, I'm Rion Spinks.

401
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:09,800
You're looking in bad shape. Should I call a doctor?

402
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:15,500
Ooh, quite allright.

403
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,700
Where's the body? You?

404
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,000
There's no body.

405
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
We've got a call, that somebody was dying.

406
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
- Hey, everything is fine.
- You know, how each of these calls cost the tax payer?

407
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,700
- Jesus, why don't you turn your radio down?
- I can't find anybody.

408
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,000
This this room 309, ain't it?

409
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
So you didn't put in the call, did you?

410
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,400
No, I didn't.

411
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,100
All right, sign this buddy. <? ?> that.

412
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:34,100
Listen, you don't look so good. Better go to bed or something.

413
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:37,400
Are you gonna sign this buddy?

414
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:42,000
This guy's fucking nuts.

415
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Right there, bellow the line.

416
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,800
Get some sleep, you'll feel better.

417
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,800
Come on, let's go, Lenny.

418
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,900
Goddamn you.

419
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:55,600
(phone rings)

420
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Hello?

421
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,600
Oh yes, I'm allright.

422
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:12,100
If I wanna see you?

423
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:16,400
Well, you know what Tolstoy said. Tolstoy!

424
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:29,400
Tolstoy said: "Regard the society of women as a necessary unpleasentness of life and avoided as much as possible.

425
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,000
What?

426
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,500
Why? Yes, I know. Hey.
I know that I'm in your apartment, but I paid this month's rent.

427
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:46,500
Yes. Sure, I can always use a drink.

428
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,100
What you've said you're calling from?

429
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:56,100
Oh, allright. I'll see you in a minute.

430
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,000
How's your head?

431
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Oh, my head needs a beer.

432
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,500
The booze is on Willbur Evans.

433
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:07,500
It's probably the last time, I won't be able to run on him.

434
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:14,700
I guess it's not fair on Willbur, but he's got nothing but money.

435
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:20,800
Ooh, poor Willbur.

436
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:30,500
What did you do when I was gone?

437
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:38,700
Where the hell are my panties?

438
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,700
Where the hell is anything?

439
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:47,000
Did an earthquake hit this place?

440
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,500
Oh, well, I was looking for a lottery ticket.

441
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,600
You don't play the lottery.

442
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:58,600
Oh, well, I. hahaha

443
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,900
Is your head really allright?

444
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,900
It's just fine.

445
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:35,700
- What did you say?
- Oh, it's hatred. It's the only thing that lasts.

446
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:43,000
That guy beats his old lady and I hear he killed two guys.

447
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Oh, shit. What the fuck's he doing out?

448
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I don't know.

449
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
He killed one man, they put him in, and he got out, killed that oher guy and now he's out again.

450
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
He killed one man, they put him in, and he got out, killed that other guy and now he's out again.

451
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:02,000
Maybe it was selfdefence or maybe it's our penal system.

452
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,100
Anyhow, he's out on parole.

453
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:10,100
He must jack off his parole officer, when he comes around.

454
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,300
- I'm getting out.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

455
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:22,300
= Get up you whore!

456
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:36,400
Maybe this guy had a reason for killing.

457
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,400
Hey, most people think they do.

458
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:52,300
<? What we're gonna do ?>

459
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:59,400
Well, us? Us is gonna drink, I hope.

460
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:05,900
Pour me one then.

461
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:11,500
Thanks.

462
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,400
I feel kind of sleepy.

463
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,400
<? I don't know what it is ?> The booze or what, but ...

464
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:35,700
- I need a nap.
- Hey, you'll go ahead, I'll watch things.

465
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:43,000
By the way, I didn't get that job.

466
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,000
Tomorrow is lighter.

467
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I've been a waitress, a typist.

468
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,700
I can do it again.

469
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:04,700
Hey, you don't have to do anything <? ?>. I'll work something out.

470
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:56,500
This thing upon me, like a flower and a feast.

471
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:01,000
This thing upon me, crawling like a snake.

472
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,900
It's not death, but dying will solve it's power.

473
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:12,000
And as my hands drop the last desperate pen. it's an cheap room.

474
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,500
They will find me there. I never know my name, my meaning.

475
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:22,500
I know the treasure of my escape.

476
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Henry?

477
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,300
Yes, what is it?

478
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:37,300
- Are you there?
- Yes, I'm right here.

479
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Henry, I'm going to die.

480
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,200
What?

481
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,600
I'm gonna die.

482
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:00,800
I just saw this angel.

483
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
He came to take me.

484
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:11,300
And huge white wings.

485
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,900
He spread all across the room.

486
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:21,900
He's beautiful. Glowing.

487
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:29,000
He came to take me.

488
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,400
Hey. Hey, it gonna be all right.

489
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,400
Henry.

490
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:43,200
You better call an ambulance.

491
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,500
- You better call an ambulance.
- An ambulance?

492
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,800
I can't breath.

493
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:55,800
Henry? I'm going..

494
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,900
Hello, operator. I need an ambulance.

495
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:08,900
(sirens)

496
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,700
Oh, jesus!! What you guys work the day shift and the night shift too?

497
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:28,700
- I'm gonna ask you the same thing.
- This time he's got the body.

498
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:38,500
Hey, sign here.

499
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:44,600
Don't you change your underwear?

500
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,800
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry, just change your underwear.

501
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,800
No more calls here tonight, buddy, 'cause I won't answer anymore calls here tonight.

502
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,900
- What about Wanda?
- Wanda's just drunk and besides that she's too fat.

503
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:03,900
Come on Harry, let's get out of here.

504
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,700
Did you hear what that son of a bitch said?

505
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:13,400
- He said you're allright.
- That son of a bitch said I was too fat.

506
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,300
He had no right to say that. Do you think I'm too fat, Henry?

507
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:24,300
- Oh, no, no. You're just right, you're perfect.
- I thought so. Thank you.

508
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:30,500
Look, if you're going after a job in the morning, you better get some sleep.

509
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,900
All right.

510
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:36,900
I really saw that angel.

511
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:40,200
His wings were moving.

512
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,400
Well, I'm glad he had the wrong address.

513
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,900
I would have missed you badly.

514
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:51,900
You're lying as a baby.

515
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,600
Hey <? ?> hang over, why don't you go another day? Huh?

516
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:59,200
<? Say when you'll feeling better ?>

517
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,500
<? ?> look for a job.

518
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,400
What do you want me to do? Go back to my drunken bable?

519
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,600
Yes.

520
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,500
The angel came.

521
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,400
That was a warning to get straight.

522
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,900
Hey. You don't believe in that crap, do you?

523
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:22,900
Sure. More crap you believe in, the more better off you are.

524
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:29,700
<? I could use ?> cigarette.

525
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:35,700
- Where the hell you're going, anyhow?
- Got a couple of places in mind.

526
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,300
Don't you have a match?

527
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,000
- Hey buddy?
- Huh?

528
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,400
You've got a light?

529
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:50,400
Well, indeed, I do have light.

530
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:02,300
- Thank you very much, sir.
- The pleasure is more than mine sir.

531
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:07,300
And my lady.

532
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:14,200
See. The angels are everywhere.

533
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:18,000
It's time those fuckers came out of hiding.

534
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,700
- Do you have busfare?
- Yeah, wish me luck.

535
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:25,700
Ey, good luck.

536
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,000
- Mr. Chi..?
- Blake, Will Blake.

537
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:45,300
You're Henry Chinaski.

538
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:50,500
- I tried your dorm....
- Hey, what da fuck is goin' on out there?!!

539
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
You weren't <? ?>

540
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,800
I decided to wait a bit.

541
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:08,000
All right, I am Chinaski, but I don't own any money, so if you're from the collection agency, you can forget about it.

542
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,200
No, I'm Tally Sarenson.

543
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,500
We've met each other in that bar.

544
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:21,400
Come on, please!

545
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,200
Can I come in for a moment?

546
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:29,200
Well, uuuh.

547
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:34,800
Look, I'm not gonna consume you.

548
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:41,300
All right.

549
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,100
Go ahead.

550
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I feel entirely foolish.

551
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,500
But how come?

552
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,000
Just, just walking in here.

553
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,800
Hmmm, would you care for a beer?

554
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:03,800
- Thank you.
- Ok.

555
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:22,500
I'm one of the main producers of the <? Contapurery ?> view of art and the <? ?>

556
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,700
Oh, producer?

557
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,700
I own a magazine.

558
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,800
- So?

559
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:34,800
So, we have discovered you.

560
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:41,800
Oh, I had an  idea, that I'd be discovered after my death.

561
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,500
You look well on way. You might be our deadline. <? ?>

562
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,300
Hey, what's with this deadline, huh?

563
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:52,500
Don't you remember? You've sent us dozens of stories.

564
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,500
You can't doubt it <? ?>

565
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:59,600
I don't think so.

566
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:07,000
- Why did you send your stuff to us?
- Well, I like the title of the mag. <? ?>

567
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Why don't you stop drinking? Anybody can be a drunk.

568
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:18,200
Anybody can be a nondrunk.

569
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:22,500
It takes a special talent to be a drunk.

570
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:29,000
It takes endurance. Endurance is more important than truth.

571
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Anyhow, you've had some luck. We've decided to accept your last story.

572
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:39,700
And we pay upon acceptance.

573
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,500
You've changed you're address quite a bit, don't you?

574
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:52,300
I had to hire a private detective to find you.

575
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:59,300
Oooh, the guy in the hat, right? Hey, hahaha.

576
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:06,300
Oh, hey, wait. I can't cash this fucking thing.

577
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:14,000
Ok, whore, this is it. I can't stand it another minute. You're like a leech sucking off my mind.

578
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Be aware of me. This is it, for help me Christ, I'm gonna finish you off now.

579
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,100
Please no.

580
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:24,000
You wait here, I'll be back.

581
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Loui, Noo, Noo, Nooo! Ahhhhh.

582
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,100
Hey, man, you've got a search warrant?

583
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:46,100
You owe me for a lock and a door.

584
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,400
Hey, I don't like the way you're handling your woman.

585
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,800
<? Are you a poli? ?> Where you're from anyhow?

586
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,300
Don't ya know, she likes it?

587
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:00,500
Fucking, right!

588
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:04,000
You've get your ass out of here, buster.

589
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:10,500
We don't need no fucking <? ?> claimers clearance to play around here! And move out!

590
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:15,500
Ehhe, it's love you see? Anything else bothering you?

591
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Yeah.

592
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I don't like you.

593
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,000
That's just nature the <? ?> I don't like you.

594
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:34,000
You don't like me.

595
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Wait. Hey, man, watch this one!

596
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Ok, let's go killer.

597
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:10,200
<? ?> damn luck, motherfucker.

598
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:15,200
Yeah, but that counts too.

599
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:27,000
Hello, hello I need an ambulance. Royal <??> apartments, 334 Westlake place, South.

600
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,700
It's apartment 308. And hurry up.

601
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:33,700
A man is dying.

602
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:38,700
No I tell ya it's for real this time. There a guy on the floor gutted.

603
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:43,400
Ok, hurry.

604
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:48,400
Hey, baby, we've got to get out of here.

605
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,000
I tell you it was an accident, that sucker tried to kill me.

606
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,400
<? ?>

607
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,700
- What happened?
- Wasn't my fault, he fell on his knife.

608
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,000
Shouldn't we tell the police?

609
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:08,000
<? ?> jail. Hey they've got the wrong kind of bars in those places.

610

611
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:19,300
Hey, what's up?

612
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,100
Hey, baby.

613
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:59,000
Hmm, you know, for 75$, I'll suck you till your asshole rumbles like a volcano.

614
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:04,000
- Oh, I can alway tell a class lady when I see one.
- Faggot!

615
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,000
Five hundred dollars.

616
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Oh, thanks much, really. There've been many angels around here lately.

617
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,500
Which way, my dear angel?

618
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:31,300
- <? ?>
- Oh, bitch!

619

Bitch you're <? driving ?> with a faggot! What you've gonna do with him, when you get home?

620
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,100
What was all that about?

621
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:45,100
This <? ?>. She doesn't know a damn thing about me.

622
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:50,800
- But I know something about you.
- Really?

623
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,700
You've been jailed twelve times.

624
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:58,700
You like Mahler and Mozart, <? ?>.

625
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:07,500
You hate movies. You like avocados and Schopenheimer.

626
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:10,300
Sound's like your man did his homework, baby.

627
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,000
When I read your stories, I had to find out.

628
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,500
They made me feel.

629
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:21,000
And they made me curious, very curious.

630
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,500
You've been really right. Why do you live like a bum?

631
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:33,800
I am a bum. What do you want me to do? You want me to write about the sufferings of the upper classes?

632
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,000
This is maybe news to you, but they suffer too.

633
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,500
Heey. Hey, baby.

634
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:45,700
Nobody suffers like the poor.

635
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:49,200
Little worried about that guy, who've got knifed.

636
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:54,200
Think he got it in the side. If he'd get in the stomach, that's bad.

637
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:03,500
Fuck you!

638
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,700
Maybe, they're in love.

639
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:10,600
Aah, you call that love? I call it unoriginal exhibition.

640
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,000
Maybe, it's only that you want to be that one who's kissing her.

641
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,500
Maybe. I don't put it down on parade.

642
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,600
Why can't you be more romantic?

643
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,000
Think of making love <? ?> rollercoaster.

644
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Look at these vain idiots <? ?>. What they really need is a little <? ?>

645
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:33,500
That's <? ?>

646
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,000
- Are you crazy?
- Yes.

647
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Stop it!

648
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:57,600
That <? ?> was dumb, childish, the <? ?> act of a spoiled asshole.

649
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:04,900
So you hired a dick to find an asshole.

650
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Take the left to this black gate with no one out.

651
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Hey, <? ?>.

652
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:21,300
What do you want to be, when you grove up.

653
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:26,300
Hey Talia, I'm not pretending to be anything. That's the point.

654
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I'm glad this' the point.

655
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:37,700
That's the guesthouse.

656
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:48,100
- Do you need a drink?
- Yeah, like a spider needs a fly.

657
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,300
I'll get the drinks.

658
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:27,700
- You're the bartender.
- Ok.

659
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:30,000
How does it feel to be on the other end?

660
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Oh, either way is greatest, when the bottle pours.

661
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,500
It seems to be a limited world.

662
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,800
Is there anything else to it?

663
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:45,800
No, it's a selfsufficient illusion.

664
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
One of my editors left those here.

665
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:27,700
You know. In the guesthouse you could write in peace.

666
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:33,600
Hey, tell me baby, nobody who could write worth a damn could ever write in peace.

667
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,600
I take it, you don't care for my world.

668
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:47,700
Baby, look around it's a cage with golden bars.

669
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,500
You better go now.

670
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:07,500
I'm sorry for all of this, I'm not used to drink.

671
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:16,100
Hey, Tally.

672
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:23,500
- I'd better sleep now.
- Where's the bedroom?

673
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,200
There you go.

674
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:35,200
I can't sleep with my clothes on.

675
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:40,400
Hey, wait a moment.

676
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:14,300
Tally. Tally, baby.

677
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:18,500
- Hey, Tally baby.
- What is it?

678
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:23,500
I've gotta go.

679
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:30,800
What is it?

680
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,300
What went wrong?

681
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:37,500
Look, baby. I belong on the streets.

682
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:40,300
I don't feel right here.

683
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:47,900
- I feel like I can't breath.
- It's a <? starting ?> uneasiness. You can grow into it.

684
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:52,400
Hey, baby. Grow's for plants. I hate roots.

685
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:58,000
You had all this feeling in your stories. I thought maybe it came from you.

686
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:04,400
- I'm sorry, I've gotta go.
- No I'm not gonna cry.

687
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:09,800
You fooled me, that's all, it's been done before.

688
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:17,600
- Hey, Tally. I didn't mean to do anything ugly.
- Get out.

689
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:04,800
Hey, Wanda.

690
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,800
Wanda. Hey, Wanda.

691
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:16,800
- Where the hell have you been?
- Fetch you a little drink.

692
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:21,000
Where've you been?

693
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I smell it. Parfume.

694
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,500
Get away from me, you pig!

695
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:31,200
Hey, you're crazy.

696
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:36,200
Look, what I've found.

697
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,700
That's frightening.

698
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:46,500
- What have you done? Did you kill somebody?
- Yeah.

699
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:06,900
That's for you, before the angel comes and takes you away.

700
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:11,000
You crazy ass.

701
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:16,000
How about a refill?

702
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:23,500
Ooh.

703
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,900
Hey, what're you doin'?

704
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:30,500
Dressing.

705
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,500
I know, but why?

706
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:40,500
I just can't stand lying under that cover of money. I feel so dumb.

707
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,400
Hey, money isn't dumb.

708
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,200
They say it talks, you know.

709
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:51,600
By the way, cops came by.

710
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,700
- Came by where? Here?
- No, not here.

711
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:58,700
It was next door 308, two ambulance guys carried him out.

712
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:02,200
He've been knifed.

713
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,800
Was he alive?

714
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:07,400
He must have been,he smoked on his cigarette.

715
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,000
Oh, great.

716
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,800
Henry, I didn't get the job.

717
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,000
That's ok.

718
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,800
We're gonna take that money and we're gonna go to the bar.

719
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:26,800
- And we're gonna celebrate. Ok?
- All right.

720
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Hey, Henry!

721
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:53,500
Yeah?

722
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:58,500
- Scotch on the rocks.
- Oh, the same and I'm buying for the house.

723
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:07,400
Look, your credit's no good here. You've got to have the green.

724
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,400
This can't be true.

725
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:23,400
Start <? ?>, my friends are thirsty.

726
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,200
- <? ?> Henry.
- Friday night.

727
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:35,200
Eddie's gonna jab you tonight. <? ?>

728
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:43,300
It's too late for that.

729
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,300
Eddie would think I was <? running ?>.

730
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:49,500
You care what he thinks? Huh?

731
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:58,900
Hey, if Eddie whips me, you're goin' home with him tonight?

732
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:02,500
One mistake is enough for me.

733
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:06,400
It's you and me.

734
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,100
But, I'll tell you something.

735
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:13,100
If I find that one you went to bed with, I'll rip all her parts of.

736
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:18,500
Oh, honey it wasn't me.

737
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:37,100
Hello my friends!

738
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Eddie, you're in too. Pour youself a drink.

739
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:52,400
Listen, you owe me forty bucks.

740
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:59,200
Here, keep the change. Pour yourself a drink.

741
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,400
Go buy yourself some bubblegum.

742
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,500
Give everybody a new round. Yeah.

743
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:09,500
Listen punk, I'm gonna tell you something. Last time I <? ?>

744
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:14,000
What's it gonna be this time, the <? ?>

745
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Now come on, start trotting, boy.

746
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I'll fucking pour you. I'm making a phone call <? ?>

747
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,700
Hey, let me get you a hamburger. Huh?

748
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:29,300
Aaah. I want to stay. <? ?> whiskey.

749
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:34,100
Look Henry. Henry, get some sleep. <?Buying ?> tomorrow couple of meals.

750
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:39,000
Heeey. Hey! I can't back down now.

751
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,800
It's not fair he's pouring those drinks. He's ready for ya Henry.

752
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:47,800
Hey. His kind is no problem. One good punch and he's bursting up looking for the exit.

753
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:52,200
You owe me 42.50.

754
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:57,200
Here baby, keep the change. Maybe you get a taxi back to your room tonight.

755
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:04,900
To all my friends. To all my friends.

756
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,400
Henry. Thank you, Henry. Thank you.

757
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:15,400
Oh, all my friends.

758
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
- What is this, take out service now?
- Yeah.

759
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,600
- Oh, shit.
- What?

760
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:49,600
I mean, drink up.

761
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Come on in boys.

762
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Henry, I want to talk to you.

763
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:25,300
hey. I told you, I didnt want that cage with the golden bars.

764
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:27,100
Who is this?

765
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:34,100
Wanda, this is Tally. Tally, this is Wanda.

766
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:38,000
Henry, I'm gonna <? ?> over there for a few minutes.

767
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,800
Hey, Eddie. Drink for the lady.

768
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:46,800
Vodka, Eddie.

769
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:52,500
- Tally is a publisher, she took one of my short stories.
- Yeah?

770
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:55,400
What else did she take?

771
01:31:55,400 --> 01:32:00,000
Excuse me, I don't want to be rude, but haven't I seen you before?

772
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:08,600
- Are you a friend of Henry's?
- Yeah, I'm a real good friend of Henry's.

773
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,100
How about you?

774
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:15,900
Well. Henry and I are quite...

775
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:19,600
I'll say you are.

776
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,300
That's the parfume.

777
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:25,900
Hey. Look girls, there's realy nothing to get upset about.

778
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:30,900
Let's have a few drinks and listen to some jukebox music.

779
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:34,000
Who's gonna pay for that drink?

780
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,000
- I'm gonna separate you from your parts you westside bitch!
- You get away from me!

781
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,100
I just want to talk to Henry for a minute.

782
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:48,100
I asked, who's gonna pay for that goddamned drink?

783
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,900
- Here.
- Thank you.

784
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:59,900
Now look girls. Be realistic.

785
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,100
None of us hardly know one another.

786
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:08,100
Basically, strangers to each other.

787
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:12,600
Heh, we've passed one night and

788
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:16,000
<?wanda ane me ?> met in a bar.

789
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,300
Be realistic, there's no way, there's no reality <? ?> of this.

790
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:23,700
Another round the <? ?>

791
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:27,500
If you don't get out of here, I'm gonna peel you away from your parfume.

792
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:32,500
- I have a drink and I attempt to sit here and drink it.
- Really?

793
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:41,600
Just get out of here now, before I finish you off.

794
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:46,600
All right. I know you need this. Good luck. Goodbye.

795
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:16,300
To all my friends!

796
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:24,400
Come on my friends.

797
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Let's drink up!

798
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:54,600
You're gonna fight him again? Hahaha, that's a laugh!

799
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:05,600
