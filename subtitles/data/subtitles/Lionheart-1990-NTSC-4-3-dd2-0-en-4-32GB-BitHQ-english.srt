2
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,063
Don't worry.

3
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:41,565
You don't trust me?

4
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:44,067
I got the money.

5
00:01:44,136 --> 00:01:46,570
Let's see the stuff.

6
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:48,071
Let's see the money.

7
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:56,579
Money.

8
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,372
This is sugar!

9
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:23,601
No shit?

10
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:25,108
Yeah, no shit.

11
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:27,907
And this...

12
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,038
is gasoIine.

13
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:36,916
Come on,
torch him, man!

14
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:42,349
Aah!

15
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:51,094
Oh! Aah!

16
00:02:57,175 --> 00:02:59,109
Mrs. GauItier,

17
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:00,610
I'm sorry
this happened

18
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,044
to your famiIy.

19
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:04,378
We've done
everything we couId.

20
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:06,883
In cases Iike this,
it is very difficuIt

21
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:08,920
to make any kind
of prediction,

22
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:12,354
so for the next coupIe of months,
it's going to be touch and go.

23
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:14,016
Mrs. GauItier--

24
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:16,117
The insurance
has expired, I know.

25
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:22,857
Does he have any other reIatives,
anyone eIse that couId possibIy heIp?

26
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:23,901
No.

27
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:27,564
Come on, NicoIe.
Let's go home.

28
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,236
Lyon.

29
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:34,134
Lyon.

30
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:36,180
Lyon.

31
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:38,578
Lyon!

32
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:43,911
Lyon!

33
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,487
Ha ha ha.
Aye, Lyon.

34
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:28,192
Wonder what's in
the goody sack for you today?

35
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,962
Heh heh.
Let's have a Iook.

36
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:33,630
There we go.

37
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:36,572
''Legionnaire
Lyon GauItier.''

38
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:42,078
Ooh, yes.

39
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:47,880
- It's very nice.
- No interest, eh?

40
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,213
OK. Back she goes.

41
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:52,221
Aah!

42
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:54,324
Aah!

43
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:00,387
Yeah, GauItier.
That's me.

44
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:05,436
This one's been out
in the sun too Iong.

45
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:15,713
She tried to caII me
two weeks ago.

46
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:17,214
Nobody toId me.

47
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:20,175
Why?

48
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:25,450
This is the Foreign
Legion, GauItier,

49
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:26,957
not CIub Med.

50
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:28,959
We're taIking about my brother.

51
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,688
He couId be dead by now.

52
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:35,631
And we couId be at war
with the bIoody wogs tomorrow.

53
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,192
I need your ass here.

54
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:41,705
Your brother
is not my probIem.

55
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:46,577
Or yours anymore.

56
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,344
You gave up your famiIy
when you joined the Legion.

57
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:56,586
I never gave up my famiIy.

58
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:00,590
Never.

59
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,523
Legionnaire, I don't have time
for this shiesse.

60
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:10,659
I need to see my brother.

61
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,366
You need what
I teII you you need.

62
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:20,774
And right now I think
you need two weeks hard Iabor.

63
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:30,554
You onIy have six months Ieft
in the Legion, GauItier.

64
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:32,715
Don't make it six years.

65
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:38,091
You're a reaI asshoIe.

66
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:44,067
Is there a probIem, sir?

67
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:47,070
No, no, no, no.
No probIem.

68
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:50,073
Desert fever.
This is your reaI probIem.

69
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:54,077
Too many weeks
in the hot sun.

70
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:58,081
ShaII we try
sweatbox, sir?

71
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:02,017
Yes,
this might heIp.

72
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,681
Just untiI his
fever breaks.

73
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:21,173
Cover your head,
Iegionnaire.

74
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:32,748
Move!

75
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,051
Your beIt.

76
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,021
Come on.

77
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:43,025
Ugh!

78
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:45,722
Move!

79
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:47,731
Your hoteI room
is ready.

80
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,891
OK.

81
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:50,900
Hyah!

82
00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:58,774
Aah!

83
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,511
Ugh!

84
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:15,858
Aah!

85
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,902
Aah!

86
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:47,456
Hyah!

87
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:54,330
Hyah!

88
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:11,643
Get me a fucking jeep!

89
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:40,308
There's no sign
of him, sir.

90
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:43,680
He'II never make it.

91
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:48,552
If the wogs don't kiII him,
then the desert wiII.

92
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:52,951
Just in case, head down to the docks
first thing in the morning.

93
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:57,224
The ocean is his onIy way
out of the country.

94
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:48,270
Moustafa, go this way.

95
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:01,087
Hey!

96
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,786
Get your ass
back down beIow!

97
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:05,056
Get down to those
boiIer rooms now!

98
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,188
OK.

99
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:08,095
This ain't no pIeasure cruise.
Move your ass!

100
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:30,913
The Ietter was
from his sister-in-Iaw.

101
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:33,753
We are fortunate our inteIIigence
section makes a habit

102
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,259
of recording
return addresses.

103
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:43,667
We'II contact the Americans

104
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:46,898
and ask them to keep her
under surveiIIance.

105
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:50,429
Inspector,
this man is a deserter,

106
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:53,841
a traitor to France,
and a goddamn terrorist.

107
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:58,611
Adjutant, aII I can do
is transmit the warrant.

108
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:01,618
If the Los AngeIes cops
aren't too busy

109
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:04,052
busting dope deaIers,
gang rapists,

110
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:05,555
and seriaI kiIIers,

111
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:09,354
maybe they'II have time
to bring the asshoIe in.

112
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:11,861
And if they don't,
tough shit.

113
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:17,067
If they do not,
maybe I can heIp.

114
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:02,043
You stay off
the top deck.

115
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:03,478
First Mate's orders.

116
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,150
You were toId not to come up.
Am I right?

117
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:47,786
Yeah.

118
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,986
And you toId me this ship
was going to Los AngeIes.

119
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:51,995
What difference
does it make?

120
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:53,997
You ain't got
no green card.

121
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:55,498
You ain't got no visa.

122
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,592
You ain't getting off
anywhere, Frenchy,

123
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:01,230
so get your ass beIow
before somebody reports you,

124
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:04,469
a deserter,
stowed away on their ship.

125
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,032
You keep stoking my boiIers,

126
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,601
or you'II be breaking rocks
in the hot sun.

127
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,114
Now what's it going to be?

128
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:14,914
It's going to be simpIe.

129
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:15,953
Ugh!

130
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:19,555
Hey, maybe we make a deaI.

131
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:21,558
You've been
so generous to me.

132
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:22,558
Huh?

133
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:19,138
America.

134
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:28,446
Los AngeIes information.

135
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:31,653
PIease deposit $2.40.

136
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:33,662
No, it's my
sister-in-Iaw.

137
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,664
She's waiting for me.

138
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:37,165
HeIene GauItier.

139
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:39,963
I don't care if she's
the mayor's sister-in-Iaw.

140
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:42,561
If I don't hear coins,
this conversation's over.

141
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,072
You got it?

142
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:17,065
Hey, come on,
get him!

143
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:26,776
Who you puIIing for,
motherfucker?

144
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:29,550
KiII that fucker!

145
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:31,348
Come on, goddamn it!

146
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:47,067
You want another fight?

147
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:50,072
You sure you don't
want another fight?

148
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,573
You can win.

149
00:16:56,346 --> 00:16:59,782
Get your money.
I ain't got aII goddamn day.

150
00:17:03,686 --> 00:17:06,817
Shut up, shut up.
Wh's gonna fight the next fight?

151
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:12,160
Who's going to fight
the next goddamn fight?

152
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:15,595
Do we even have
a next fight?

153
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:17,599
Do we have a next fight?

154
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:18,599
- Yay!
- Yay!

155
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:20,602
AII right, aII right.

156
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,604
We got a visitor.
AII right.

157
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:24,731
- Who might you be, man?
- Lyon.

158
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:26,469
- What?
- Lyon.

159
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:28,602
Lyon.

160
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:30,543
- Lyon?
- Lyon?

161
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:31,944
What the fuck is Lyon?

162
00:17:35,518 --> 00:17:37,543
Lion! The Lion!

163
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,554
AII right, aII right.

164
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:42,056
Who wants
to take on the Lion?

You're a good fighter,

00:27:57,673 --> 00:28:00,403
I don't know if
I want to fight you

328
00:28:00,476 --> 00:28:01,909
or fuck you.

329
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:03,774
- Ooh, Sonny.
- Ohh!

330
00:28:13,722 --> 00:28:14,950
Come on, boy.

331
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:17,083
Come on!

332
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:18,091
Come on!

333
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,422
Hey!

334
00:28:19,495 --> 00:28:20,928
Come on, Sonny!

335
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:29,637
Come on!
Come on!

336
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:31,297
Come on, Lyon.

337
00:28:35,478 --> 00:28:37,969
Come on, Lyon.
That's it. That's it.

338
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:40,811
Aah!

339
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:53,828
Get up, Sonny!

340
00:28:53,896 --> 00:28:55,955
Ahh!

341
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:58,363
Come on, Sonny!
Get up! Get up!

342
00:28:58,434 --> 00:29:00,595
That's my man!

343
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:01,795
Get up, pussy!

344
00:29:01,871 --> 00:29:03,338
It's over.
He's had it.

345
00:29:03,405 --> 00:29:05,373
BuIIshit!

346
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:08,032
- I couId kick this guy's ass.
- I know, baby. I know.

347
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:10,313
Not bad.

348
00:29:10,446 --> 00:29:13,142
- Hey, come on.
- Who is this guy?

349
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,682
AII right, now,

350
00:29:20,056 --> 00:29:21,489
Lyon, Lyon. Hey, no.

351
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:22,524
Come on.

352
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:25,025
No, no. Hey, no.
Don't do that, man.

353
00:29:25,094 --> 00:29:27,028
Come on, come on, come on.

354
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:28,620
Let go of me, man.

355
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:31,895
Come on, man.
You ain't going to do shit.

356
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:33,298
Hey! The winner!

357
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:36,304
Ladies and gentIemen,
Lionheart,

358
00:29:36,372 --> 00:29:40,706
king of the jungIe!

359
00:29:43,412 --> 00:29:48,179
Don't ever insuIt
one of my patrons again.

360
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,684
If there's something
RusseII or I can't handIe,

361
00:29:50,753 --> 00:29:52,846
we have paid
security personneI who can.

362
00:29:52,922 --> 00:29:54,184
You cIear on that?

00:29:54,256 --> 00:29:55,223
Yeah.

364
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:57,486
Good.

365
00:29:58,494 --> 00:30:00,758
Now, what's this shit
about a trip to L.A.?

366
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,196
I can have
another fight Iined up

367
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:04,698
in Iess than a week.

368
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:07,201
Better money for everybody

369
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:09,169
but it's up to you, Lyon.

370
00:30:09,238 --> 00:30:10,865
I'm going to Los AngeIes.

371
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,999
What the fuck
is in Los AngeIes?

372
00:30:15,411 --> 00:30:18,744
AII right. Can you at Ieast

373
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:20,907
- No.
- Do us a favor.

374
00:30:20,983 --> 00:30:22,951
TaIk it over
with your manager.

375
00:30:23,986 --> 00:30:25,112
My manager?

376
00:30:27,022 --> 00:30:29,013
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

377
00:30:29,091 --> 00:30:33,152
My man wants to go to L.A. What
he's got goin' there is his business.

378
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:35,629
We'II be back
when we're ready.

379
00:30:35,698 --> 00:30:37,598
You understand?
Right, my man?

380
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,964
Let me teII you aII
something.

381
00:30:40,035 --> 00:30:42,595
What I did tonight
I did for my famiIy,

382
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:45,037
not for you...

383
00:30:45,107 --> 00:30:46,540
not for me.

384
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:48,099
You made a totaI...

385
00:30:48,177 --> 00:30:51,374
of $5,000.

386
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:53,108
That's a pretty
substantiaI amount

387
00:30:53,182 --> 00:30:54,615
for a one-night stand.

388
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:56,947
Where eIse wiII you
make that much money?

389
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:59,112
That's my business,
not yours.

390
00:30:59,188 --> 00:31:00,621
Stop the car.

391
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:02,657
What if we arrange
a fight in CaIifornia?

392
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:04,818
We do have a circuit
out there, too.

393
00:31:04,894 --> 00:31:07,454
Arrange it
for somebody eIse...

394
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,963
and stop the car.

395
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:22,876
That 5,000 won't go
as far as he thinks.

396
00:31:22,945 --> 00:31:24,970
My private number...

397
00:31:25,047 --> 00:31:27,481
in case
he changes his mind.

398
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,916
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

399
00:31:29,985 --> 00:31:31,418
Hey. Hey, man.

400
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:33,921
Get up off the acceIeration,
wiII you?

401
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:36,924
You know how far that damn airport
is from here?

402
00:31:36,992 --> 00:31:40,257
Hey, come on, man.
It's just me and you now.

403
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:42,763
I Ieft them other
jive turkeys way behind.

404
00:31:42,832 --> 00:31:44,424
AII right.
I can dig it.

405
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,092
My brother
made me some money,

406
00:31:46,168 --> 00:31:48,398
so I'II Ieave his ass
in the street.

407
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:50,439
Go ahead
with your bad seIf!

408
00:31:50,506 --> 00:31:54,101
We'II see how far your ass
get without my heIp!

409
00:31:54,176 --> 00:31:55,973
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

410
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:57,307
Jive motherfucker.

411
00:31:58,948 --> 00:32:00,882
Tonight
I fought for you.

412
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,942
- You didn't make enough money?
- Wait a minute, man. Shh.

413
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:06,317
Huh?
You want some more?

414
00:32:06,388 --> 00:32:08,822
Don't be taIking about money
around here, man.

415
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:10,825
These peopIe hear

416
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:13,327
we won't make it
to that damn corner.

417
00:32:13,395 --> 00:32:16,330
Just put your money
back in your pocket.

418
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:18,059
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

419
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:21,569
Why don't we get a cab
out of here now?

420
00:32:21,637 --> 00:32:22,797
Come on.

421
00:32:22,872 --> 00:32:25,136
Hey, Iookit there.
There it is.

422
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:27,573
There's a teIephone.
That's what we need.

423
00:32:27,643 --> 00:32:28,610
Yeah.

424
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:31,407
Listen to me.
I'II get you out of this.

425
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,414
I'm a survivor.
Come on, man.

Hey, man.

00:32:55,604 --> 00:32:57,037

437
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:22,097
Hey, shut up, nigger!

Motherfucker's going to pay now!

That's right.

00:34:03,472 --> 00:34:04,905

449
00:34:04,974 --> 00:34:08,034
you don't send cabs
to this neighborhood?

450
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,873
You want to

You're going to Iisten

455
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,823
I've been around,

A Iot of weird ass motherfuckers

00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:40,066
Huh?

463

Yeah, yeah,

465
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:50,084
But you're

466
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:52,086
if you think
I'II fight again.

467
00:34:52,154 --> 00:34:53,917
Hey, I can dig it.

468
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,752
It's cooI.

469
00:34:55,824 --> 00:34:56,756
OK.

470
00:34:56,825 --> 00:34:57,757
Yeah.

471
00:34:57,826 --> 00:34:58,918
OK.

472
00:34:58,994 --> 00:35:00,188
Ah, shit.

473
00:35:00,262 --> 00:35:03,754
$5,000 goes a Iong way
in the Iand of sunshine.

474
00:35:29,124 --> 00:35:32,059
It finaIIy happened
Iate Iast week.

475
00:35:32,127 --> 00:35:35,392
With the extent
of his injuries,

476
00:35:35,464 --> 00:35:39,400
honestIy, I don't know how
he heId on as Iong as he did.

477
00:35:42,137 --> 00:35:44,571
It's because I toId him

478
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,904
I'd aIways
be there for him.

479
00:35:49,144 --> 00:35:50,577
I'm truIy sorry.

480
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:01,919
The guys that did this to him--
did they catch them?

481
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:08,025
Mr. GauItier...

482
00:36:08,097 --> 00:36:09,189
he's gone,

483
00:36:09,264 --> 00:36:12,700
and nothing we can do
wiII bring him back.

484
00:36:13,936 --> 00:36:16,029
Doc, my question is,

485

644
00:47:13,827 --> 00:47:16,796
Yes. Thank you.

645
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,862
I need to go.
Excuse me.

646
00:47:24,638 --> 00:47:27,698
Ha ha ha.

647
00:47:27,774 --> 00:47:29,105
So go.

648
00:47:31,578 --> 00:47:34,706
When I came in
this morning,

649
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:38,979
you were spread across the bed
Iike an oId throw rug.

650
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:42,580
What happened to my cIothes?

651
00:47:42,656 --> 00:47:44,521
I gave them to the vaIet

652
00:47:44,591 --> 00:47:47,651
with instructions to burn them.

653
00:47:47,727 --> 00:47:49,661
You toId them
to burn my cIothes?

654
00:47:53,533 --> 00:47:55,228
Give me a break.

655
00:48:01,408 --> 00:48:04,036
There are a few shops
right down the street.

656
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:09,047
I'm sure we'II be abIe to find a way
to repIace your fabuIous wardrobe.

657
00:48:17,424 --> 00:48:19,858
I just want
my cIothes back.

658
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:26,490
Not on your Iife.

659
00:48:26,566 --> 00:48:28,500
I'm taking you shopping today

660
00:48:28,568 --> 00:48:31,366
if I have to drag you
kicking and screaming.

661
00:48:35,742 --> 00:48:37,232
Why are you so nice to me?

662
00:48:44,617 --> 00:48:46,608
# WeII, there she stood #

663
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:49,018
# AII cIothed in brown #

664
00:48:49,089 --> 00:48:51,250
# She saw my shadow #

665
00:48:51,324 --> 00:48:53,121
# She turned around #

666
00:48:53,193 --> 00:48:55,787
# Such a teaser... ##

667
00:48:59,733 --> 00:49:02,065
Just try one more.
Hmm?

668
00:49:02,135 --> 00:49:03,295
S'iI vous pIait?

669
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,673
It's nice...

670
00:49:08,742 --> 00:49:10,607
but it's not for me.

671
00:49:10,677 --> 00:49:12,167
No?

672
00:49:19,085 --> 00:49:20,814
How about this?

673
00:49:22,522 --> 00:49:25,047
Any better?

674
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:26,393
Ahem!

675
00:49:26,526 --> 00:49:28,426
Everything OK in there?

676
00:49:29,696 --> 00:49:31,630
Everything is fine.

677
00:49:36,169 --> 00:49:37,761
You know,

678
00:49:37,837 --> 00:49:41,273
peopIe in New York are stiII
taIking about your fight.

679
00:49:45,612 --> 00:49:47,477
Let them taIk.

680
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:59,984
Are you pIanning on
sIeeping in the haIIway?

681
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:03,722
No. I'II stay next door
with, uh, Joshua.

682
00:50:05,565 --> 00:50:08,534
Oh. Is that it?

683
00:50:08,601 --> 00:50:12,037
You two, um,
got something going?

684
00:50:12,105 --> 00:50:14,972
Cynthia,
I'm not your toy.

685
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:17,976
If you want a toy to pIay with,
taIk to RusseII.

686
00:50:19,145 --> 00:50:21,170
Not to me.

687
00:50:23,216 --> 00:50:25,275
Want to take this?

688
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:34,559
It's your favorite,
isn't it?

689
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:23,534
This your baII?

690
00:52:23,603 --> 00:52:24,535
Mm-hmm.

691
00:52:32,178 --> 00:52:33,805
Take some money.

692
00:52:43,823 --> 00:52:45,313
[Knock On Door]

693
00:52:45,391 --> 00:52:47,052
Oh, Christ.

694
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,365
WeII.

695
00:53:00,773 --> 00:53:02,365
I'II do it.

696
00:53:03,443 --> 00:53:04,569
WeII...

697
00:53:04,644 --> 00:53:06,407
finaIIy.

698
00:53:06,479 --> 00:53:08,071
I mean...

699
00:53:08,147 --> 00:53:09,739
I'II fight.

700
00:53:10,817 --> 00:53:11,909
Oh.

701
00:53:14,921 --> 00:53:19,517
But first you have to heIp me
to take care of some business.

702
00:53:19,592 --> 00:53:22,652
AII right. TaIk to me.

703
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:26,562
I need to open
a bank account.

704
00:53:27,634 --> 00:53:31,365
- I Iike that kind of taIk.
- Not in my name. We'II make up a name.

705
00:53:31,437 --> 00:53:33,997
Don't ask me why.
Just do it.

706
00:53:34,073 --> 00:53:35,472
That's my condition.

707
00:53:36,976 --> 00:53:39,206
I'II caII my accountant
first thing in the morning.

708
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:47,452
Anything eIse?

709
00:53:48,988 --> 00:53:51,923
Yes.
I have to move out of here.

710
00:53:56,129 --> 00:54:02,193
Do I have the right to ask
what brought these sudden changes on?

711
00:54:02,268 --> 00:54:06,466
I'm going to fight for you.
I have to Iive Iike a fighter.

712
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:10,202
This pIace is too nice,
too soft, too easy.

713
00:54:12,478 --> 00:54:13,911
I see.

714
00:54:55,121 --> 00:54:58,056
Don't faII on them
damn skates, boy.

715
00:55:45,605 --> 00:55:49,234
What is this, a dance?
He's got on a damn skirt.

716
00:55:49,308 --> 00:55:50,468
ScotIand.

717
00:55:50,543 --> 00:55:52,408
ScotIand?
ScotIand, shit.

718
00:55:52,478 --> 00:55:55,606
Kick his ScotIand ass.
PuII up his dress.

719
00:55:55,681 --> 00:55:58,650
I'd Iike to see
if he's got any drawers on.

720
00:56:08,027 --> 00:56:09,324
Take your time.

721
00:56:09,395 --> 00:56:12,193
Don't be shaking
hands with him.

722
00:57:01,013 --> 00:57:02,207
Come on, now.

723
00:57:07,887 --> 00:57:09,252
Aw!

724
00:57:16,129 --> 00:57:17,562
Get off my car!

725
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:23,362
Get off my car, man!

726
00:57:39,285 --> 00:57:41,412
Get off the damn car.

727
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,627
That's it.

728
00:58:09,282 --> 00:58:11,648
That's it!
One more time!

729
00:58:11,717 --> 00:58:14,151
That's it. Yeah!
That's aII right!

730
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,585
You got it, baby.

731
00:58:15,655 --> 00:58:17,418
Let go of him, Lyon.

732
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:18,923
Let go of him.

733
00:58:18,991 --> 00:58:20,390
Let him go.

734
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:22,393
It's over.
Let him go.

735
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:23,894
Hey, that's right.

736
00:58:23,963 --> 00:58:26,898
Be ready
with the cash, fIash.

737
00:58:26,966 --> 00:58:29,526
OK. Yeah.

738
00:58:29,602 --> 00:58:31,399
I'm back! He's back!

739
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:33,404
And we back together!

740
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:52,924
Afternoon, Iadies.

741
00:58:59,098 --> 00:59:01,623
Moustafa.
It's your turn.

742
00:59:03,703 --> 00:59:07,571
Mommy, does this mean
I can have a bike?

743
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,438
Um, honey, why don't you
go in the other room

744
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:13,444
so I can taIk

745
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:14,877
Draw me a pretty picture.

746
00:59:14,947 --> 00:59:17,381
I'II go draw myseIf a bike.

747
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:19,884
That wouId be
very nice, sweetie.

748
00:59:19,952 --> 00:59:21,044
She's cute.

749
00:59:22,455 --> 00:59:26,289
I just don't know
how I couIdn't have known about it.

750
00:59:26,359 --> 00:59:29,385
ActuaIIy, husbands

751
00:59:29,462 --> 00:59:32,090
Yeah. Secret IittIe

00:59:34,834 --> 00:59:36,961
without freaking them out.

754
00:59:39,038 --> 00:59:41,438
WeII, you'II get one

755
00:59:41,507 --> 00:59:45,705
You know how the post office is

756
00:59:45,778 --> 00:59:47,905
Oh, no.
That's fine. Um...

757
00:59:48,981 --> 00:59:51,415
Yes. Thank you,
Mr. EIdridge.

758
00:59:51,484 --> 00:59:55,853
Hey, don't thank me.
Thank the man who set up the poIicy.

759
00:59:57,990 --> 00:59:59,924
May he rest in peace.

760
01:00:04,397 --> 01:00:07,366
Oh, uh... just do me
one IittIe favor.

761
01:00:07,433 --> 01:00:09,367
I know it's something
he wouId've wanted.

762
01:00:09,435 --> 01:00:10,629
WeII, what is that?

763
01:00:12,004 --> 01:00:13,733
Get the IittIe girI

764
01:00:16,943 --> 01:00:19,878
AII right.
You have a nice day.

765
01:00:30,456 --> 01:00:32,390
Aargh!

766
01:01:16,602 --> 01:01:18,365
Yeah! That's it.
That's it.

767
01:01:18,437 --> 01:01:20,371
I Iike that. Yeah.

768
01:01:24,944 --> 01:01:26,878
Hey, man. Hey.

769
01:01:26,946 --> 01:01:29,380
That's bad for you
when you jog, man.

770
01:01:29,448 --> 01:01:31,882
It destroys
your concentration.

771
01:01:33,953 --> 01:01:35,386
Look good to me.

772
01:01:35,454 --> 01:01:38,890
Look good to me.
Get on out there, boy.

773
01:02:05,684 --> 01:02:07,914
Hey, you guys.
What are you drawing?

774
01:02:11,257 --> 01:02:12,690
Like my new bike?

775
01:02:12,758 --> 01:02:13,816
Yeah.

776
01:02:13,893 --> 01:02:14,985
Bye, you guys.

777
01:02:15,061 --> 01:02:17,359
- Bye.

778
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:19,364
See you tomorrow!

779
01:02:32,945 --> 01:02:34,879
Moustafa, wake up!

780
01:02:34,947 --> 01:02:36,380
He's here.
Downstairs.

781
01:02:46,192 --> 01:02:47,682
Come on! Let's go!

782
01:02:51,297 --> 01:02:52,730
NicoIe.

783
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:54,823
Come on inside, honey.

784
01:03:06,979 --> 01:03:09,209
Did he see us?

785
01:03:11,984 --> 01:03:13,417
He'II be back.

786
01:03:14,487 --> 01:03:16,352
Ah, hey, hey, hey
hey, hey, hey, hey.

787
01:03:16,422 --> 01:03:17,855
OK, I'm taking some bets.

788
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:19,356
Lionheart, 5-to-4.

789
01:03:19,425 --> 01:03:20,858
No wading.

790
01:03:20,926 --> 01:03:23,360
I mean,
this ain't no dive.

791
01:03:23,429 --> 01:03:24,862
No I.O.U.s either.

792
01:03:55,494 --> 01:03:56,756
Yeah!

793
01:05:53,512 --> 01:05:55,412
Better Iuck next time, man.

794
01:06:10,028 --> 01:06:11,256
Ha ha ha. Yeah!

795
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:12,957
Ha ha ha ha.

796
01:06:13,031 --> 01:06:14,692
Hey...

797
01:06:14,766 --> 01:06:16,427
We did it.
My boy did it.

798
01:06:16,501 --> 01:06:18,560
Who is HeIene GauItier?

799
01:06:19,905 --> 01:06:21,896
According to the bank,

800
01:06:21,974 --> 01:06:25,102
she's the one that cashed
that phony insurance check.

801
01:06:27,713 --> 01:06:30,443
She used to be married
to his brother.

802
01:06:30,515 --> 01:06:33,780
-He's just trying to heIp the woman out.
-Is he fucking her?

803
01:06:35,988 --> 01:06:39,924
Cynthia, you one hard, coId,
sick bitch. You know that?

804
01:06:39,992 --> 01:06:41,789
I asked you a question.

1146
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:40,855
If you find that bitch,

1147
01:36:40,923 --> 01:36:43,016
She's headed toward
the front door now, sir.

1148

With the cash?

You have to go with us.
You have to.

1161
01:37:46,021 --> 01:37:47,545
It's not fair.

1162
01:37:47,623 --> 01:37:49,056
Why can't you go?

I know Iife is not too fair.

1166
01:37:55,631 --> 01:38:00,295
Sometimes it's ugIy
and stupid and mean.

1167
01:38:00,369 --> 01:38:03,304
But sometimes,
Iife's beautifuI, too.
