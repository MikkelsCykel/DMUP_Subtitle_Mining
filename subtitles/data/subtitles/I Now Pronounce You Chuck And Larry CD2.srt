00:00:01,532 --> 00:00:02,863
I'm flying!

2
00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:03,992
We gotta look good at this.

3
00:00:04,068 --> 00:00:05,194
It's showtime, boys!

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,430
Whoa!

5
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:08,830
I'm sorry!

6
00:00:08,906 --> 00:00:09,998
No, it's part of it.

7
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:13,635
All right, Larry, get up.
That's it, that's it, that's it.

8
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:18,944
We're busted, dude,
we're busted.

9
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:21,008
Let's go junior high on their ass.

10
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:22,143
Junior high?

11
00:00:22,353 --> 00:00:23,980
Yeah. Let's do this.

12
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:25,283
Okay.

13
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:41,228
Is it working?

14
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:44,537
I don't know.
I'm afraid to look up.

15
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,668
I think it is.
I think it is.

16
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,018
Oh, my God.

17
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:02,591
We really pulled this one
out of our asses.

18
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:07,090
Bad choice of words, there, Larry.
Bad choice of words.

19
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:13,765
Hey, Chuck, Larry. We got a basketball
game every Tuesday night at 6:00.

20
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:16,033
If you guys want to play,
the butterfly knows how to get hold of us.

21
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:18,837
Okay, right on. Thank you. Thank you.
Yeah, we'll give you a buzz.

22
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,104
Nice to meet you guys.

23
00:01:20,178 --> 00:01:24,137
<i>Sinners and fornicators!
We are not here in anger!</i>

24
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:27,275
<i>We are here to save you
from eternal damnation!</i>

25
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:29,544
Hey, buddy!

26
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,248
Wait, come on already!
This is a private event.

27
00:01:32,323 --> 00:01:33,585
Now, give it a rest.

28
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:37,150
<i>Aren't you worried about
where you'll spend eternity?</i>

29
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:39,161
This is what these guys do
on a Saturday night?

30
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,926
They just want everyone to be
as miserable as they are.

31
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:46,902
Gay is not the way!
Gay is not the way! Gay is not the way!

32
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:48,632
It's over, baby.

33
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:50,640
Gay is not the way!
Gay is not the way!

34
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:55,441
Hey, hey! You heard the man.
It's a private party, so take a walk.

35
00:01:55,513 --> 00:01:58,710
This is a public sidewalk.
We have every right to be here!

36
00:01:58,783 --> 00:02:00,410
And we have every right
to be queer!

37
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:01,918
Yeah!

38
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:08,251
<i>Homosexuality is
an abomination.</i>

39
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:12,255
Hey, news flash, man.
That jacket's an abomination.

40
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:16,129
Gay is the way! Gay is the way!
Gay is not the way!

41
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:19,330
Hey, what makes you think
that you have the right to dictate

42
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:20,803
how other people
live their lives?

43
00:02:20,872 --> 00:02:23,841
I'm a minister.
I'm allowed to preach in any public forum.

44
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:25,239
Well, I'm a fireman.

45
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:28,107
I say you're blocking emergency access,
so let's call it a night, guys.

46
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:30,841
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You're a fireman?

47
00:02:30,915 --> 00:02:33,076
You are a disgrace!

48
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:35,642
<i>You're a flamer,
is what you are.</i>

49
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:37,778
All right, oh, my God.
There's no reasoning
with these people.

50
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:40,289
Just let it go. Just let it go.
Just let it go.

51
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:42,121
Come on, come on.
Let it go, guys.

52
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:44,093
Have a good day.
See you later.

53
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:45,527
Faggots.

54
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:48,095
I'm sorry?
What did you call me?

55
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:50,490
Oh, I called you a faggot.

56
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:52,866
<i>Faggot.</i>

57
00:02:56,674 --> 00:03:00,667
For your information,
the accepted vernacular is "gay."

58
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:07,742
Homos, one. Crazy people, zero.
Official score.

59
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,727
Gentlemen, I have
a very simple philosophy.

60
00:03:16,794 --> 00:03:18,659
What you shove up your ass
is your own business.

61
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,390
Captain...
Shut up.

62
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:24,458
Now, it's not my style to get involved
in the personal lives of my firemen.

63
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:25,627
And if sometimes I've given you

64
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:28,263
the impression that I'm your friend,
I apologize.

65
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,073
However, I seriously doubt
that you two are banging each other.

66
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:37,672
You and Paula, the most beautiful couple
I ever laid eyes on.

67
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:41,878
And you, if my pencil sharpener had a skirt,
I'd have to hide it.

68
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:47,053
Look, do you have any idea of the stress
an administrative position entails?

69
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:49,354
I've already got
a prostate the size of a cantaloupe.

70
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:50,621
And now, thanks to you two bozos,

71
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:53,357
I've got the Pension Department
pissing up my chimney,

72
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:55,365
not to mention every flaming fruit bat
south of Poughkeepsie

73
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:58,459
that wants to come down here to our house
and slide up and down our pole!

74
00:03:58,536 --> 00:04:00,333
We should tell him the truth.
We'll tell him the truth.

75
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:02,372
We'll tell him the truth.
lx-nay on the uth-tray!

76
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,930
I don't want to hear about it.

77
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:05,999
And if this marriage is
something you've cooked up

78
00:04:06,077 --> 00:04:09,535
in response to this pension problem,
you are not taking me down with you.

79
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:11,377
I will report you.
You will go to jail,

80
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:12,848
where you won't have
to pretend to be gay,

81
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:16,148
because your asses'll be busier
than a test bench in a plunger factory.

82
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:22,891
I just wanted to thank you again
for what you did at the fundraiser.

83
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,485
Oh, yeah,
that was no big deal.

84
00:04:25,563 --> 00:04:27,724
You sound a little down.
Where's Larry?

85
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:31,393
He's at school with the kids,
doing the Career Day thing.

86
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:34,097
So does that mean that you can have
a girl's day with me?

87
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:35,365
<i>A girl's day?
Yeah.</i>

88
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,737
<i>I need some new shoes,
new underwear.</i>

89
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:38,934
Girl's day!

90
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,068
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

91
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,942
Girl's day! Sure.

92
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:48,012
I'll pick you up.

93
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:12,194
So, by trading in
pre-refunded municipal bonds,

94
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:16,433
we can offer our clients
triple tax-exempt returns.

95
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:18,900
Any questions?

96
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:23,780
There never are.

97
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:27,875
Thank you, Mr. Auerbach,
for that very nice trip down Wall Street.

98
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:31,683
Our next parent is Larry Valentine,
Tori's father.

99
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:34,418
Hi, everybody!
I am a firefighter,

100
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:38,325
and I'm proud to be one because
it's my job to protect the community

101
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:41,559
and make sure
it's a safe environment for all.

102
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,191
Whoa! We got some questions already.

103
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:47,866
Yeah.

104
00:06:47,938 --> 00:06:51,897
I don't like girls, either.
Does that mean I'm gay, too?

105
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,704
No, no.

106
00:06:57,882 --> 00:06:59,873
You were married
to a woman, right?

107
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:01,542
Yes.

108
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:04,053
Does that mean
you're half-lesbian?

109
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:08,057
Kids, Mr. Valentine is here to talk
about his career today, okay?

110
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,650
Mr. Valentine?
You said you're a fireman.

111
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:11,888
Yes, that is correct.

112
00:07:11,962 --> 00:07:13,327
Do you have two jobs?

113
00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:16,662
Because my dad said
that you're also a butt pirate.

114
00:07:22,306 --> 00:07:23,534
Larry.

115
00:07:23,607 --> 00:07:24,904
Steve.

116
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:26,367
Rough crowd, huh?

117
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:27,877
Kids.
Yeah.

118
00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:31,676
So, listen. We're all set
for the Boy Scout overnight this month.

119
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:33,046
Oh, great. We're all set?

120
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:37,383
No, we're all set,
like we don't need any more fathers.

121
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:40,253
All right, well, then, I guess I'll see you
at Little League, then, all right?

122
00:07:40,324 --> 00:07:42,554
Oh, you know what?
We're good.

123
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:44,186
We are good.

124
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:45,785
No, no, no, we're not good.

125
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:49,057
We don't need you for Little League.
We're good.

126
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:53,035
Okay, Steve, what's going on?
I signed up to coach three months ago.

127
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:56,904
Larry, I don't want to get into this
with you here.

128
00:07:56,974 --> 00:08:00,410
Hey, you know what, Steve?
You're really starting to piss me off.

129
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,140
I'm trying to get Eric
interested in baseball.

130
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:05,478
That kid interested
in baseball?

131
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:07,676
You got a better chance getting
Colonel Sanders interested

132
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:09,879
in a hamburger, buddy.

133
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:16,388
Fight! Fight! Fight!

134
00:08:19,563 --> 00:08:22,054
Your dad's gay and so are you.

135
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,304
Oh, my hair!
Oh, my hair, my hair!

136
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:33,570
Oh, my clothes!

137
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:35,236
Oh, am I frizzy?
I'm getting frizzy!

138
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:40,079
You asshole! Go back to Jersey!
You can go back to Jersey!

139
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:43,587
Come on, honey!
Please open the door!

140
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:49,858
Whoa, nice pad.

141
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:51,326
Oh, thank you.

142
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:55,021
Hey, you are soaked. Do you want to borrow
a sweatshirt or something?

143
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:57,659
No, no. I'm great, I'm great.
Thank you.

144
00:08:57,735 --> 00:08:59,566
Okay, but I am freezing, so...

145
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:05,299
What are you doing there?

146
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,775
Well, it's wet.

147
00:09:14,618 --> 00:09:17,143
Actually, you know what?
I'll take that sweatshirt.

148
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:18,415
Oh, yeah.

149
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,951
Thanks.

150
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:35,269
So, that's a great body
you got there. I mean,

151
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:38,334
it could be the best body
I've ever seen in my life.

152
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:39,671
Shut up.

153
00:09:39,743 --> 00:09:41,938
Besides Larry's. But yours...

154
00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:46,010
Your tush looks like
it's made of muscle,

155
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,677
and Larry's is made of pudding
and Quarter Pounders

156
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:50,447
and God knows what.

157
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:53,012
Well, these are real, by the way.
I mean, nobody thinks they are.

158
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,718
Everyone thinks they're fake,
but they are real.

159
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:59,854
Alex. You don't gotta lie to me.
We're two girls hanging out. Come on.

160
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,626
You kidding me?
There's no silicone here, I swear.

161
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,669
Oh, no big deal if they are or not.
I don't care.

162
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:08,068
I've got nothing to hide.
Feel them.

163
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:10,569
Feel them?
Feel them.

164
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:12,699
I mean, I...

165
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:16,840
I have a...

166
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:21,112
I'd rather feel a flabby man pec,
to be honest with you,

167
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:23,483
but in the name of science,
if you need me to hold

168
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:26,455
your bodacious Bahama mamas,

169
00:10:26,523 --> 00:10:28,855
or whatever the guys call them nowadays,
I'll do it.

170
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:30,587
Yes, go ahead.
Oh!

171
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:34,954
Well?

172
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:36,897
Yeah, they're real.

173
00:10:37,768 --> 00:10:38,996
Told you.

174
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,498
And creamy.

175
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,702
And fun.

176
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:47,736
For someone who would like
something like this, this is...

177
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:49,938
But to me, it's, like, ew.

178
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:53,609
I just got a little nauseous there,
touching them. That's funny.

179
00:10:53,684 --> 00:10:55,276
You want a bite?

180
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:58,211
No, no, no.
Feeling them's enough.

181
00:10:58,656 --> 00:10:59,680
I'll do that again.

182
00:10:59,757 --> 00:11:03,124
No, no, I meant food.
Are you hungry?

183
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:05,718
Oh! I'm sorry.

184
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:07,787
Yeah, no... Just...

185
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:10,257
That was funny.

186
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:22,879
Nice, nice.

187
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:28,751
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Me and Nootzie against you three guys.

188
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:30,286
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

189
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:32,478
You don't want to play?

190
00:11:33,223 --> 00:11:35,316
Hey, Chuckie,
I gotta be honest with you.

191
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:38,623
You play real physical defense,
and none of us want you copping a feel

192
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:41,790
or rubbing up against
the old boosh-cadoosh here.

193
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:44,830
Just 'cause you're gay doesn't mean
that you're horny for every guy you meet.

194
00:11:44,902 --> 00:11:47,200
Oh, really? 'Cause every time
you covered me in the past,

195
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:49,205
I feel like you were
grab-assing on me.

196
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:52,765
Yeah. Let the WNBA play.
Come on.

197
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:55,240
Fine, go.

198
00:11:57,147 --> 00:11:58,739
Unbelievable.

199
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:10,821
Oh, God.

200
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,122
What, you want
to mess with me, too?

201
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:15,958
Huh? You want to mess
with the queer?

202
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:18,866
'Cause this queer don't take shit
from nobody. Let's go, then.

203
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:22,667
You ready? I'm a fireman, man!
I ain't afraid of nothing!

204
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:26,171
Put your fists down.

205
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,458
Me, too.

206
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,325
You, too?

207
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,390
You, too, what?

208
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,698
I'm gay.

209
00:12:57,674 --> 00:13:00,108
I can't believe
I finally said it.

210
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,172
Oh, God, it feels so good.

211
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:07,009
It's just like a wave
is crashing over me.

212
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:11,113
It's so liberating.

213
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:12,519
Oh, yeah.

214
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:18,125
Do you remember
the first time you said it?

215
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:21,631
First time I said... Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

216
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:23,598
I was with Larry.

217
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,362
Your lover.
Yeah.

218
00:13:26,003 --> 00:13:28,494
Who, by the way,
is absolutely gorgeous.

219
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:30,369
Oh, thanks.

220
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:32,409
He's mine, though, so...

221
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:34,205
Oh, no, that's your man.

222
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:35,267
Mmm-hmm.

223
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:36,471
Yeah.

224
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:39,675
My whole life
I've been living a lie.

225
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,811
But you and Larry have given me
the strength to be true to myself.

226
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:46,480
"To thine own self be true."

227
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,757
There's nothing worse than pretending
to be something that you're not.

228
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,631
Yeah. Yeah, well, I'm glad.
I'm glad we helped you out,

229
00:13:58,235 --> 00:14:01,033
and anything else we can do,
you don't hesitate to ask.

230
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:04,899
Would you help me
tell my parents?

231
00:14:05,943 --> 00:14:06,967
I guess.

232
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:08,238
Yes!

233
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:10,439
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

234
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:12,243
Oh, yes, yes, yes, girl!

235
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:16,476
Hey, did you guys catch
that Mets game last night?

236
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:19,454
They got a shot of my cousin
throwing a beer at the ump.

237
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:22,117
I missed it. Took my sister
to the electrolysis place

238
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:23,523
for a second opinion.

239
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:25,255
They said there's nothing
they could do.

240
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:29,655
What the hell is so funny?

241
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:57,918
No!

242
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:15,703
Pick that up, would you?

243
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,576
I ain't picking that up!

244
00:15:17,648 --> 00:15:20,378
You want my soap, Renaldo?
Right here.

245
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:24,786
Hey, Tony, give me your soap.

246
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:26,948
No. I don't share soap.
Too many germies.

247
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,682
Come on, give me the damn bar of soap!

248
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,123
Get out of here! Get out of here!

249
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:39,329
Who's gonna do it?

250
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:08,793
Hey, how you doing?

251
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:12,467
Hey, Duncan.

252
00:16:14,004 --> 00:16:16,302
I'll tell you about that later.

253
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:26,371
<i>'Cause I'm every woman
It's all in me</i>

254
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,580
<i>Anything you want now, baby
I'll do it naturally</i>

255
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,421
<i>Let me hear you say it</i>

256
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:38,683
Lawrence.

257
00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:40,320
<i>Oh, a little louder</i>

258
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,533
<i>Everybody sing now</i>

259
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:48,998
<i>I can't hear you sing</i>

260
00:16:58,382 --> 00:16:59,747
All right, yours is done.

261
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:01,511
Yours, too.

262
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,109
All right, take a look.
Okay.

263
00:17:03,186 --> 00:17:05,154
"Girlz Rule" with a "Z."

264
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:06,712
This is so awesome.

265
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,814
I hope you like yours.

266
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:09,256
Let's see here.

267
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:11,851
"Friends forever."

268
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:15,354
Anything with forever and you in it
sounds pretty good to me.

269
00:17:15,432 --> 00:17:17,992
This is great.
Just slide her on.

270
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:19,968
You know what's
still bugging me, though?

271
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:23,268
That those Guidos wouldn't even
let you play basketball with them.

272
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,798
We could get a court order
and have them suspended in two seconds.

273
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:29,311
Court order? No, no, no.
These guys are good guys.

274
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:31,609
They're just having
problems adjusting.

275
00:17:32,015 --> 00:17:33,949
Calm down. Relax.
Finish your wine.

276
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:35,348
Come on.

277
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:36,977
Okay.

278
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:43,421
You're right. You're right.
Yeah.

279
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:46,428
But you know what would really
help me to relax?

280
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:49,897
Is a foot rub.

281
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,434
Please. Please.
You'll be my bestest friend.

282
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:58,605
Oh, they're good.
Yeah, I can handle it. Give me these.

283
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:02,736
You know, I love that you're
a chubby chaser, by the way.

284
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:04,007
A chubby what-what?

285
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:06,106
Well, you know,
Larry's heavyset.

286
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:09,675
I mean, is that the type of guy
you've always been attracted to?

287
00:18:10,754 --> 00:18:13,655
No, he's my first fatty.

288
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:18,226
Yeah, you guys really seem
like you have a lot of sexual chemistry.

289
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:20,786
I float his boat
and he sinks mine.

290
00:18:21,264 --> 00:18:26,600
Yeah, I've never had that, really had that,
with anybody before. I just...

291
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,070
I don't even know
if I know what I'm doing.

292
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:30,128
What?

293
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:32,539
I'm serious. Come on.

294
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:36,412
Give me some moves.
How do you turn Larry on?

295
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,180
How do I turn Larry on?

296
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:45,183
I mean, to get him into bed, of course,
I just lay a pizza out...

297
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:46,779
No!
...and he comes running.

298
00:18:46,857 --> 00:18:48,381
Really. Seriously.

299
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:55,259
Well, he likes it
when I rub his big, hairy earlobe.

300
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,232
That gets him crazy.

301
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,324
Really?

302
00:18:58,402 --> 00:19:00,131
Yeah, it's a spot of his.

303
00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:02,234
Try it on me.

304
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:03,602
Try it on you? Yeah, yeah.

305
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:04,765
Yeah.

306
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:06,809
You know, I just grab it and...

307
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:12,748
Usually when I do this to Larry,
he's like, boing! You know?

308
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,108
I love it.
You do?

309
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:16,618
Yeah. Like that?

310
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:19,416
Sure, sure, yeah, yeah, yeah,
work both hands. I like that.

311
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:22,253
And then you can go to some hair-pulling,
right about like that.

312
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:23,383
Like that?
Yeah.

313
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,587
Oh, yeah, let him know you're there,
know what I mean?

314
00:19:25,662 --> 00:19:27,562
And then the slap out
of nowhere is good.

315
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:29,394
That is good.
Uh-huh.

316
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,028
Yeah. Not Ultimate Fighting
kind of smacking.

317
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:35,867
Just light and sexual and fun.
Sorry.

318
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:38,703
How did you get to be
so good at all this?

319
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:41,573
I don't know.
A lot of practice I guess.

320
00:19:41,645 --> 00:19:44,978
I used to be kind of a jerk.

321
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:49,109
But then you meet
somebody special

322
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:52,087
who makes you
not want to be a jerk anymore.

323
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:57,684
Actually, it makes you want to
give everything you got to that one person.

324
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:04,523
Yeah. You know, it's true when women say
that all of the good men are

325
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:06,762
either gay or married.

326
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:10,398
And of course,
I'm hanging out with one who's both.

327
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:15,002
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Just for the record, though,

328
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:18,536
if I wasn't so
into chubby hubbies

329
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:20,674
or chunky monkeys...
What did you say again?

330
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,739
Chubby chaser.

331
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:23,217
Oh, yeah, yeah.

332
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:26,948
I would be just so all over you.

333
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:29,685
Oh, come on. No way.

334
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,556
Are you kidding me?
Look at you.

335
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:37,464
You're gorgeous, and you're smart,
you're passionate, funny.

336
00:20:40,103 --> 00:20:42,162
I'm just so happy I met you.

337
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:44,173
Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

338
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:47,803
Friends. Friends forever.

339
00:20:57,687 --> 00:20:59,052
Oh, yeah.

340
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:08,422
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, what are we doing?

341
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:11,990
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.
Hey, hey, Alex.

342
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:15,538
I just never felt this way
about a woman before.

343
00:21:15,605 --> 00:21:16,867
Because you're gay.

344
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,170
And you're married.
And you're my client.

345
00:21:19,342 --> 00:21:20,366
This is so wrong!

346
00:21:20,443 --> 00:21:22,604
No, it's not about right or wrong,

347
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,944
or gay or straight,
or hard or soft. It's...

348
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,212
Wow.

349
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:33,789
No! I can't see you.

350
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,390
I can't see you.
Except as a client.

351
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:38,359
Alex, don't say that. Please?

352
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:41,488
I believe in marriage.
I believe in what it represents.

353
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:46,764
I betrayed you. I betrayed Larry!
Oh, my God, poor Larry!

354
00:21:46,836 --> 00:21:51,398
Larry, he's a great guy, but I gotta be
honest with you, our marriage is...

355
00:21:52,175 --> 00:21:56,441
All he does is watch his baseball games,
and, like, I don't even exist anymore!

356
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,104
You have to go. I'm sorry.

357
00:21:58,515 --> 00:22:00,073
He hits me, though.

358
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:03,415
I'm so sorry.
Please, please, please go.

359
00:22:12,295 --> 00:22:13,353
Hey!

360
00:22:14,698 --> 00:22:17,292
What the hell's going on out here?

361
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:21,470
Nothing. I'm just draining a few buckets
with Eric and Tori over here,

362
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:23,028
making small talk, you know?

363
00:22:23,206 --> 00:22:24,400
You'd think on such a nice day,

364
00:22:24,474 --> 00:22:26,635
your husband would want to
spend time with his family.

365
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,076
Where is he, anyway?
Is he out straight-bashing again?

366
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:31,306
No, he's at his mother's.
He's taking her to the movies.

367
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:34,316
No, Daddy.
He's with that smoking hot lawyer lady

368
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:36,784
he always talks about
when you're not around.

369
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:38,320
He is?

370
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:40,947
Hey!

371
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:45,724
I just felt a breeze,
Mr. Valentine,

372
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:48,491
and that breeze is blowing
straight towards justice.

373
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,579
Hey, guys, we got a perpetrator
lodged in the air duct.

374
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:07,515
Apparently tried to break in last night,
got stuck.

375
00:23:07,584 --> 00:23:08,983
You're the guys
from the newspaper, right?

376
00:23:09,052 --> 00:23:10,986
Yeah, that's us.
All right, well,
then you're gonna love this.

377
00:23:11,054 --> 00:23:15,491
The guy got stuck upside-down,
so his ass is still hanging out for you.

378
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:17,719
That's pretty funny.
Did your moustache come up with that?

379
00:23:17,794 --> 00:23:20,422
Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't speak Gayanese.

380
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:26,199
Hey, anybody!
You gotta get me out of here!

381
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:28,362
I just peed on my face!

382
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:31,635
All right, relax, buddy,
I'm here to help.

383
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:35,569
Unlike some people around here,
who only help themselves.

384
00:23:35,645 --> 00:23:37,545
Who are you talking about?
You.

385
00:23:37,614 --> 00:23:38,774
Why? What happened?

386
00:23:38,848 --> 00:23:40,475
Fitzer came by today,
and Tori told him about

387
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,313
your obsession
with our hot-ass lawyer.

388
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:44,751
Obsession? What? What?
What is she talking about?

389
00:23:44,821 --> 00:23:47,449
Don't even give me that,
Mr. I'm Taking My Mom To A Movie.

390
00:23:47,524 --> 00:23:49,014
You know what?
Maybe if you were around today,

391
00:23:49,092 --> 00:23:51,253
Fitzer would actually think that,
I don't know, you like me.

392
00:23:51,327 --> 00:23:53,420
Hey, man, I gotta lie to you!

393
00:23:53,496 --> 00:23:55,760
Thanks to you,
I gotta lie to everybody!

394
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:59,029
Especially Alex!
I can't be honest with her!

395
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:01,866
I can't even get close to her.
I can't even have freaking fun with her!

396
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:05,066
Why can't you have fun with me?
We always used to have fun. I just...

397
00:24:05,141 --> 00:24:06,608
Because you've changed!

398
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:08,906
Ever since you forced me
to marry you,

399
00:24:08,978 --> 00:24:10,343
you're so goddamn controlling.

400
00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:13,348
You don't act like my freaking husband,
you act like my boss.

401
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:16,817
"Don't do this!" "Don't do that!"
"Hey, what time you coming home tonight?"

402
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:19,320
You're smothering me, man!
I can't freaking breathe!

403
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:21,357
What you guys need
is a bubble bath.

404
00:24:21,424 --> 00:24:22,550
Shut up!

405
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:26,288
Idiot, the only reason you're feeling that way
is because you're afraid of feeling trapped.

406
00:24:26,362 --> 00:24:28,023
That's what happens
when you get married!

407
00:24:28,098 --> 00:24:30,794
Fat-ass, we're not
really married!

408
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:33,165
I'm just in some gay,
crazy nightmare!

409
00:24:33,236 --> 00:24:35,761
Yeah, that you can't commit to,
'cause you can't commit to anything!

410
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,036
I swear to God, I feel like I'm the only one
who's trying to make this thing work!

411
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:42,840
Work! That's right, it's become work!
This relationship is work!

412
00:24:42,912 --> 00:24:45,574
Face it, we are not
supposed to be together.

413
00:24:45,648 --> 00:24:48,446
I found somebody
I really want to be with.

414
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:50,748
Instead of being jealous of that,
why don't you do the same?

415
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,549
Because I still love my wife.

416
00:24:52,622 --> 00:24:54,920
Well, move on already.

417
00:24:54,991 --> 00:24:58,085
Your house is like
a freaking shrine to Paula!

418
00:24:58,161 --> 00:25:01,028
One of these days
you gotta get a real wife,

419
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:03,588
one that your kids don't gotta
lie about every two seconds.

420
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,759
No, you can't keep it in your pants
for five minutes,

421
00:25:05,835 --> 00:25:07,462
and that's why we're
so screwed up now!

422
00:25:07,537 --> 00:25:10,768
Whoa, back up, buddy.
You know why we're in this jam.

423
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,808
'Cause you can't open
your freaking mail!

424
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:15,470
Everything with Paula's name on it
gets tossed in a desk

425
00:25:15,545 --> 00:25:17,638
and filed under
"Too painful to deal with"!

426
00:25:17,747 --> 00:25:20,477
Guys, could you at least call
another fire department?

427
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,212
What is your rush, idiot?
You're going straight to jail anyway.

428
00:25:23,286 --> 00:25:26,221
You know what? I cannot deal with sleeping
next to your stupid, ugly face tonight.

429
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:27,517
So don't bother coming
in the bedroom.

430
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,080
Oh, wouldn't dream of it, honey.

431
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,720
You are a lousy best friend
and a shitty husband!

432
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:35,924
Hey! For the record,
every time I laughed at one of your jokes,

433
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:37,967
I was faking it.

434
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:39,694
You're a monster!

435
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:47,838
Oh, my God,
it's Mr. February!

436
00:25:47,911 --> 00:25:50,505
I love you, I love you, I love you!

437
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,911
I love you!

438
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,114
Wow, that's a gay bracelet.

439
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:00,321
I hope Fitzer sees that.

440
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:03,189
Shut up.

441
00:26:13,636 --> 00:26:14,762
You needed to see us?

442
00:26:14,838 --> 00:26:16,271
Shut the door.

443
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:21,001
You know,
for the first time this month,

444
00:26:21,077 --> 00:26:24,046
I pissed without spraying
in all three urinals at once,

445
00:26:24,113 --> 00:26:25,580
so I was in a relatively good mood.

446
00:26:26,115 --> 00:26:27,673
Until I received this.

447
00:26:30,353 --> 00:26:32,150
Seems the guys in the company
took a meeting.

448
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:35,658
They all signed that petition requesting
that I transfer you both out of here.

449
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:37,420
What?
And you're gonna listen to these idiots?

450
00:26:37,493 --> 00:26:39,222
I'm not gonna do it,
but I have to do something

451
00:26:39,295 --> 00:26:40,557
to keep the peace.

452
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,325
Now, personally,
I think it's just a matter of time

453
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:45,196
before your little act gets busted.
Until then, you're on separate shifts.

454
00:26:45,268 --> 00:26:46,292
What?
Separate shifts?

455
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:47,961
Hey, we've been together forever!

456
00:26:48,037 --> 00:26:50,369
So were my balls,
and now I only have one of them.

457
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,498
What?

458
00:26:51,574 --> 00:26:54,065
Valentine, go to work.
Levine, go home.

459
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:03,712
Hey, fellas!

460
00:27:03,987 --> 00:27:08,481
Hey. Heard you guys have been
circulating a petition.

461
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:12,989
You mind if I take a look at it?

462
00:27:13,563 --> 00:27:16,430
Oh, what do you know?
I got it right here.

463
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:19,094
It's impressive.
Lot of names.

464
00:27:19,302 --> 00:27:21,395
Let's go down the list,
see who we got here.

465
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:26,967
Nootzie! Hey, you remember that time
Chuck and I ran back in that textile plant

466
00:27:27,243 --> 00:27:29,268
and dragged your limp body out?

467
00:27:29,345 --> 00:27:32,803
Even though Chuck's leg was broken,
like, in three different places?

468
00:27:32,882 --> 00:27:35,874
I mean, that was pretty
freaking gay of Chuck, huh?

469
00:27:35,952 --> 00:27:38,853
Wow. Renaldo!

470
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:41,619
Man, I remember your first day
on the job.

471
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:45,024
Remember you were so scared
you actually crapped yourself?

472
00:27:45,094 --> 00:27:46,823
And Chuck and I,
we snuck you back in here,

473
00:27:46,896 --> 00:27:48,727
we cleaned you up
so nobody'd find out.

474
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:50,595
You begged us not to tell anyone,
and did we?

475
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:51,722
Let's ask.

476
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:55,335
You guys hear that story before right now?
Show of hands?

477
00:27:55,405 --> 00:27:57,202
No, but it's hilarious.

478
00:27:57,273 --> 00:27:59,332
Yeah, it is hilarious.

479
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,902
Tony! Nice signature.

480
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,710
Hey, is that the same one you used
to endorse the check that Chuck gave you

481
00:28:06,783 --> 00:28:09,809
when you gambled away
your mortgage payment on college football?

482
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:12,184
I guess his money wasn't
too gay to bail you out

483
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:14,382
or keep your wife
from leaving you again.

484
00:28:14,457 --> 00:28:15,754
Again?

485
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:18,253
I guess Chuck's
not enough of a man

486
00:28:18,328 --> 00:28:20,728
to work next to big strong heroes
like you guys.

487
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:23,855
Oh, look at that. Fire.

488
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:25,457
Well, I hope it's not a bad one,

489
00:28:25,535 --> 00:28:27,435
'cause the faggot who's been
saving your sorry asses

490
00:28:27,503 --> 00:28:30,495
is now, thanks to you,
working on another shift. Let's go!

491
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,940
"That's when Sadie said,

492
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:39,106
"'Love will always help you
find your way home."'

493
00:28:40,383 --> 00:28:43,113
Sleeping. Sleeping.

494
00:28:46,356 --> 00:28:47,880
That was easy.

495
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:25,553
Paula, you know I love you.

496
00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:29,262
I gotta.

497
00:29:48,951 --> 00:29:50,043
Hey.

498
00:29:51,854 --> 00:29:53,151
I'm sorry.

499
00:29:54,524 --> 00:29:55,889
Me, too.

500
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:57,683
That stuff I said...

501
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,022
I know.

502
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:03,895
Can I sleep in the bed tonight?

503
00:30:06,035 --> 00:30:07,559
I'd like that.

504
00:30:08,871 --> 00:30:10,304
All right.

505
00:30:12,308 --> 00:30:14,105
Come here.
Yeah.

506
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:25,046
Handle with care.

507
00:30:26,422 --> 00:30:27,787
Larry...

508
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:34,022
Don't let him sleep
on top of me again, Larry.

509
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:36,258
Don't do the voice.
I will kill you, I swear.

510
00:30:36,332 --> 00:30:37,458
Okay, then.

511
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:39,057
Hey! Hey, hey!

512
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:41,035
You ready for your big day,
little man?

513
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:42,162
Big day?

514
00:30:42,238 --> 00:30:45,674
My audition, Dad. Me and Uncle Chuck
have been practicing for weeks.

515
00:30:45,741 --> 00:30:49,040
He wanted to work with you,
but I was around, so...

516
00:30:49,112 --> 00:30:53,173
Why don't you do one last rehearsal,
let your father play the Annie role?

517
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:55,444
Fabulicious!
I'll get my music!

518
00:30:55,518 --> 00:30:57,349
Did you hear that?
It's fabulicious!

519
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,149
Hey, come on, come on.
Okay.

520
00:30:59,322 --> 00:31:02,621
<i>May, me, my, mo, mo
Me, my, mo, may</i>

521
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:08,297
<i>Anything you can do, I can do better
I can do anything better than you</i>

522
00:31:08,464 --> 00:31:09,954
<i>No, you can't
Yes, I can</i>

523
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:11,158
<i>No, you can't
Yes, I can</i>

524
00:31:11,234 --> 00:31:12,496
<i>No, you can't</i>

525
00:31:12,568 --> 00:31:14,502
<i>Yes, I can, yes, I can</i>

526
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,401
Yes, he can! Hit it!

527
00:31:17,507 --> 00:31:19,099
There's my star!

528
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:23,475
Turn it around, and a flip, flip, flip,
flippety-flip and a skip.

529
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,379
Double-time!

530
00:31:31,087 --> 00:31:32,349
And a Russian split!

531
00:31:32,522 --> 00:31:34,752
Oh, you nailed it!

532
00:31:34,824 --> 00:31:36,257
My kid is pretty awesome.

533
00:31:36,325 --> 00:31:38,384
There's only one guy I know
who can dance better than that.

534
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:40,554
Who?
The homeless guy
from our wedding.

535
00:31:41,931 --> 00:31:44,422
That dude was
pretty good. Yeah!

536
00:31:47,436 --> 00:31:49,097
Balls and wieners.

537
00:31:49,172 --> 00:31:50,196
<i>Is it true?</i>

538
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:51,600
Alex?

539
00:31:54,377 --> 00:31:55,503
Look at this.

540
00:31:55,711 --> 00:31:59,010
Sixteen depositions from women
who claim to have slept with you

541
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:00,514
over the last year and a half.

542
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,016
Just 16?

543
00:32:02,084 --> 00:32:04,143
Thank God the 500 other ones
couldn't read or write.

544
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,485
Wait a minute.
You knew about him and all these women?

545
00:32:07,557 --> 00:32:10,287
Alex, know what it is?
We've been through this before.

546
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,519
Chuck's...

547
00:32:11,694 --> 00:32:14,094
He's got a bit of a problem.

548
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:17,223
He messes around
with women because

549
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:20,835
he's ashamed of being gay.

550
00:32:20,903 --> 00:32:23,303
Now, is it all just about you,

551
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:26,170
or do you really just don't consider
anybody else's feelings?

552
00:32:26,242 --> 00:32:28,836
No, I don't.
I'm just a big gay jerk.

553
00:32:32,114 --> 00:32:33,911
What are you doing?
You know you like that.

554
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:36,679
Guys, guys, the shit is
about to hit the fan, okay?

555
00:32:36,752 --> 00:32:37,980
And if I'm gonna defend you,

556
00:32:38,054 --> 00:32:40,215
I have to know the truth.

557
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:44,055
You have to look me in the eyes
and tell me that you are gay

558
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:45,593
and that this marriage
is legitimate.

559
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:48,528
Alex, we're gay, okay?

560
00:32:48,598 --> 00:32:50,930
And we are married.

561
00:32:55,037 --> 00:32:56,595
It's real.

562
00:32:58,674 --> 00:33:00,198
Can you help us out?

563
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,109
Okay.

564
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:06,141
Okay. This investigation is
gonna get rough.

565
00:33:06,315 --> 00:33:09,011
They are gonna quiz you
about every detail of your lives,

566
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:11,451
every aspect
of your relationship.

567
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,957
But since you guys are telling the truth,
then I'm sure you'll be fine.

568
00:33:17,593 --> 00:33:20,824
Just for the record, I thought
this was a man when I was with her.

569
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,761
Does that help us out at all?

570
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,007
Let's go over it again.
Your birthday?

571
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:35,134
April 26th. Taurus.

572
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:36,337
Got it.

573
00:33:36,412 --> 00:33:37,504
Yours?

574
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,740
September 9th. Virgo.

575
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:41,311
How about
your favorite brand of underwear?

576
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:43,249
That would be
Mr. Calvin Klein.

577
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:45,685
I can tell you
my least favorite.

578
00:33:45,755 --> 00:33:46,847
Whoa!

579
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:15,249
I love you, Mr. February!

580
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:18,414
You're going down!
You're an abomination! Homo!

581
00:34:22,391 --> 00:34:24,382
I'm on fire! Help me!

582
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,189
We're all with you, Larry!

583
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:28,457
<i>Fear the queer!</i>

584
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,438
Thou shalt not lie with men!

585
00:34:40,509 --> 00:34:42,807
All right, Mr. February,

586
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:45,608
let's go show these guys
how married we are.

587
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:47,239
What the heck?

588
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,220
What are you guys doing here?

589
00:35:02,298 --> 00:35:06,564
We're here to apologize and back you up,
like you always did for us.

590
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:10,298
Yeah, we all lost a lot of friends on this job
that we will never get back.

591
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:13,308
We don't want to lose two more
because we were being thickheaded.

592
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:15,640
Yeah. We're partners for life.

593
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:18,046
Not partners like youse two,

594
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:20,105
but you know what I mean.

595
00:35:20,182 --> 00:35:21,308
Yeah.

596
00:35:22,318 --> 00:35:23,717
I love youse guys.

597
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:25,117
That's all right, man.

598
00:35:25,187 --> 00:35:28,088
Molest him! No, I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding you, Nootz. I'm kidding.

599
00:35:32,027 --> 00:35:33,756
Hey, Chuckie.
Yeah?

600
00:35:33,896 --> 00:35:36,262
I gotta ask you something.
I mean...
What's up?

601
00:35:36,332 --> 00:35:37,765
...why'd you pick Larry?

602
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,902
I mean, I work out,
I tweeze my unibrow.

603
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:44,703
Am I not good-looking enough for you
or some shit?

604
00:35:44,774 --> 00:35:46,969
No, no, no.
Renaldo, you're just not my type.

605
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:48,373
You're a 10.

606
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:51,908
I just like them chubby.
That's my thing.

607
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,612
I'm a 10!

608
00:35:55,885 --> 00:35:58,877
You hear that? I'm a 10!

609
00:35:58,954 --> 00:36:00,649
On a scale to 100.

610
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:04,389
You're just jealous
'cause gay guys like me.

611
00:36:06,095 --> 00:36:09,394
Good morning, everyone.
I'm Daniel Banks, City Council President,

612
00:36:09,465 --> 00:36:12,457
and I'll be presiding
over these proceedings.

613
00:36:12,535 --> 00:36:15,868
It's going to be a long day,
so let's dispense with the preliminaries

614
00:36:15,938 --> 00:36:19,669
and just get started. Mr. Fitzer.

615
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,707
Thank you, Your Councilship.

616
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:34,913
It's for later.

617
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:40,260
Mr. Valentine,
please tell us why you married Mr. Levine.

618
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:44,658
Love.

619
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:47,031
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm talking about!
Gay love!

620
00:36:47,102 --> 00:36:48,262
Please sit down, sir.

621
00:36:48,337 --> 00:36:49,702
Sorry.

622
00:36:51,907 --> 00:36:53,898
Mr. Levine.
Yeah.

623
00:36:54,677 --> 00:36:57,805
Sixteen local women
claim to have had

624
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,044
sexual relations with you
as recently as mid-April,

625
00:37:02,117 --> 00:37:08,022
including four Canadian strippers
the morning of your "marriage."

626
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:15,025
That's true. I did have
sexual relationships with them girls,

627
00:37:16,365 --> 00:37:20,199
but I was kind of having
a commitment issue.

628
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,961
Larry's forgiven me for that.

629
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:25,700
And that's all that counts to me
is what Larry thinks.

630
00:37:25,774 --> 00:37:27,537
That's right, Fitzer,
you suck!

631
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,771
One more and you're out, sir.

632
00:37:29,845 --> 00:37:33,042
Sorry, sir, you're cool. He sucks.
I'm gay. I'm out. All right.

633
00:37:33,115 --> 00:37:35,549
We should question them ex parte.

634
00:37:35,618 --> 00:37:37,017
Gentlemen.
Yeah?

635
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:40,180
At this time,
we'd like to interview you individually.

636
00:37:40,256 --> 00:37:42,281
Mr. Levine, please step outside.

637
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:45,820
Yeah. No problem.

638
00:37:49,532 --> 00:37:50,760
I'll miss you.

639
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,061
I'll miss you, too, buddy.

640
00:37:53,035 --> 00:37:54,263
I like it rough!

641
00:37:54,336 --> 00:37:55,826
One for the road.

642
00:37:55,905 --> 00:37:57,668
Like it rough.

643
00:37:58,607 --> 00:38:00,973
I did the cooking
until Chuck moved in.

644
00:38:01,744 --> 00:38:03,075
The toilet was thankful.

645
00:38:03,178 --> 00:38:07,512
He ain't the greatest chef in the world.
I'm Wolfgang Puck to his Wolfgang Suck.

646
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:10,882
We met back in the fire academy in 1987.

647
00:38:10,953 --> 00:38:12,648
I was top of our class.

648
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:15,383
He burned off his eyebrows first day. Gone.

649
00:38:15,457 --> 00:38:18,551
Larry tried to eat the fire,
I remember that.

650
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:22,028
<i>His favorite song,
Don't Fear the Reaper, Blue Oyster Cult.</i>

651
00:38:22,097 --> 00:38:25,794
<i>You're Beautiful by James Blunt.
And people think I'm the woman.</i>

652
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:27,665
<i>You're beautiful</i>

653
00:38:27,736 --> 00:38:30,227
Just gets me every time.
I don't know.

654
00:38:30,306 --> 00:38:32,103
<i>You're beautiful</i>

655
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:34,805
That is a nice song.

656
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:39,270
The thing he likes most about me
is probably my love handles.

657
00:38:39,848 --> 00:38:41,110
All of them.

658
00:38:41,183 --> 00:38:45,552
I'd say my sweet, sensitive eyes,
like that of a kitten.

659
00:38:47,823 --> 00:38:49,814
The worst day
we ever had on the job?

660
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:53,055
This little kid fell
in a swimming pool.

661
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:55,195
Chuck was the first one there.

662
00:38:55,264 --> 00:38:56,424
I dove in.

663
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,623
He pulled him out.

664
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,689
I worked on him.

665
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:01,895
Worked on him, worked on him, but...

666
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:04,603
And Larry stayed with me
all that night.

667
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:08,408
I just couldn't get that kid
out of my head.

668
00:39:11,747 --> 00:39:13,647
When my wife died...

669
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:15,445
That was the worst.

670
00:39:16,652 --> 00:39:17,880
...I collapsed.

671
00:39:17,953 --> 00:39:19,511
He knew it was coming, but...

672
00:39:19,588 --> 00:39:22,489
What we have,
it's beyond friendship.

673
00:39:23,225 --> 00:39:25,352
He's the best man I know.

674
00:39:25,427 --> 00:39:27,486
I'd do anything for him.

675
00:39:27,896 --> 00:39:29,056
I love him.

676
00:39:29,765 --> 00:39:31,255
I love him.

677
00:39:34,303 --> 00:39:35,770
What's going on?
How'd you do?

678
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:37,396
It was good.
It was no problem.

679
00:39:37,473 --> 00:39:39,407
You want me to grab those?
See if they're real again?

680
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:40,464
I'm sorry?

681
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:41,907
I says are we done yet?

682
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:44,941
Not quite. They want to talk to the kids.

683
00:39:45,814 --> 00:39:49,580
Now, why don't you tell us
about their sleeping arrangements?

684
00:39:49,652 --> 00:39:51,779
Dad and Uncle Chuck
sleep in the same bed.

685
00:39:51,854 --> 00:39:53,219
Do you know why?

686
00:39:53,288 --> 00:39:55,188
'Cause they do everything together.

687
00:39:55,257 --> 00:39:57,248
Just like Will and Grace.

688
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:05,027
It is kind of an unusual situation, isn't it?

689
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:07,199
Having two fathers?

690
00:40:07,736 --> 00:40:09,670
I don't have two fathers.

691
00:40:12,107 --> 00:40:13,369
I have my daddy,

692
00:40:13,442 --> 00:40:16,934
and Uncle Chuck is more like a mommy,
'cause to me he seems like a girl.

693
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,071
Why am I the woman?
I don't get it.

694
00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:22,910
Okay, that's all, thank you.

695
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:24,680
Bottlenose dolphins.

696
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:29,213
Orcas, gray whales, harbor seals
and West Indian manatees.

697
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:30,347
Huh?

698
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:33,389
Species that sometimes mate
with the same sex.

699
00:40:33,562 --> 00:40:38,590
Bottlenose dolphins, orcas, gray whales,
harbor seals and West Indian manatees.

700
00:40:39,201 --> 00:40:42,193
I didn't know that.
But now I'm glad I do.

701
00:40:42,304 --> 00:40:43,999
Thank you, my dear.

702
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:51,403
Remind me never to go skinny-dipping
with the bottlenose dolphins.

703
00:40:55,084 --> 00:41:00,147
I just have to say
that as a fellow gay fireman...

704
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:02,082
He's gay, too?

705
00:41:02,157 --> 00:41:03,784
That's right, fellas, I'm gay.

706
00:41:04,326 --> 00:41:06,351
You guys have
a problem with that?

707
00:41:06,428 --> 00:41:09,522
No, no problem.
You do whatever you like. Yeah.

708
00:41:10,966 --> 00:41:12,399
And Chuck and Larry,

709
00:41:13,168 --> 00:41:15,898
you've inspired me
to want to find my soul mate.

710
00:41:17,372 --> 00:41:18,862
Wherever he may be.

711
00:41:19,308 --> 00:41:21,640
Hey, I'm a 10. I'm a 10.

712
00:41:21,877 --> 00:41:23,902
You're not my type. Sorry.

713
00:41:24,913 --> 00:41:27,074
Fitzer, can we wrap this up?

714
00:41:27,282 --> 00:41:30,843
I just have one more question to ask,

715
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:33,387
if these gentlemen would
indulge me for a moment.

716
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:35,389
By all means, Mr. Fitzer.

717
00:41:36,191 --> 00:41:37,954
Chuck, Larry,

718
00:41:38,494 --> 00:41:43,090
would you say that there's a fair amount
of passion in your relationship?

719
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:44,858
Absolutely.

720
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:46,457
More passion than you can imagine, buddy.

721
00:41:46,535 --> 00:41:48,025
Yes.
How wonderful.

722
00:41:48,537 --> 00:41:51,995
Now, if you'd be so kind,
I'd like you to kiss each other.

723
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:53,769
You'd like to...
What was that?

724
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:56,868
Councilman Banks, my clients have been
more than accommodating.

725
00:41:56,945 --> 00:41:59,675
And to ask for a display of intimacy
in the middle of a crowded room

726
00:41:59,748 --> 00:42:01,079
is simply demeaning.

727
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:03,812
I'm afraid I have to agree.
We seem to have gone

728
00:42:03,886 --> 00:42:07,879
from a hearing about fraud
to some kind of weird gay witch hunt.

729
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:11,357
I'm just saying,
Your Exellegance,

730
00:42:11,426 --> 00:42:14,361
that if these two men are
as in love as they say they are,

731
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:16,420
I don't see why
this should be a problem.

732
00:42:16,498 --> 00:42:18,898
I'm just asking for one kiss, Councilman.

733
00:42:18,967 --> 00:42:22,266
Yeah! Come on, fellas,
show them how real men kiss! Come on!

734
00:42:22,337 --> 00:42:26,433
I will not stand for it! This is unbelievable!
No. Absolutely not.

735
00:42:26,508 --> 00:42:28,772
Hey, come on, no.
The Councilman agreed.

736
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:30,277
It's demeaning to us.

737
00:42:30,345 --> 00:42:34,304
Plus, we don't want to get you all horny.
Me and this guy, we... It could get steamy.

738
00:42:34,383 --> 00:42:39,252
Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

739
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:40,618
Order.

740
00:42:41,523 --> 00:42:42,751
Order!

741
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:45,282
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

742
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,884
I'm not doing this, Alex.

743
00:42:46,962 --> 00:42:48,896
You know what?
Just go for it.

744
00:42:49,832 --> 00:42:51,231
Well?
Order!

745
00:42:53,335 --> 00:42:55,235
I guess it's showtime.

746
00:42:56,705 --> 00:42:58,400
Going in straight...

747
00:42:58,473 --> 00:43:00,464
Coming out gay?

748
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:34,705
Enough! I'd rather change
my grandfather's diaper

749
00:43:34,776 --> 00:43:36,243
than see two straight guys kissing.

750
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:37,801
But we're not straight.

751
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,347
We're not.
We're in gay love, Captain!

752
00:43:39,414 --> 00:43:41,848
Can't you deal with that?
Oh, shut up.

753
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:44,613
If these gentlemen are gay,
then I'm a one-legged parrot.

754
00:43:44,686 --> 00:43:46,984
Anybody seen me
with a crutch and a cracker?

755
00:43:47,456 --> 00:43:48,445
I didn't think so.

756
00:43:48,857 --> 00:43:50,586
And who might you be, sir?

757
00:43:50,659 --> 00:43:52,627
Captain Phineas J. Tucker, Councilman.

758
00:43:52,694 --> 00:43:55,822
You may search my record.
I hold multiple citations

759
00:43:55,898 --> 00:43:59,425
from Mayor Dinkins, Mayor Koch and,
of course, the great Mayor Giuliani.

760
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:02,902
And let me tell you something.
These men definitely broke the rules.

761
00:44:02,971 --> 00:44:05,667
They lied on a government form
and they swore it was true,

762
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:07,504
which is despicable.

763
00:44:07,776 --> 00:44:11,610
But interestingly enough, Excellency,

764
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,875
even though they were
deceitful to us all,

765
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:16,543
I actually believe
they ended up doing some good.

766
00:44:16,618 --> 00:44:18,483
What good are you speaking of, Captain?

767
00:44:18,553 --> 00:44:20,248
Well, first off,

768
00:44:20,322 --> 00:44:22,847
they let us know
that when a friend is in need,

769
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:25,792
you go beyond extraordinary
lengths to help out.

770
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:28,295
Whenever, whatever.
That's the code.

771
00:44:28,363 --> 00:44:31,059
Then they apparently inspired
fellow firefighter Fred G. Duncan

772
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:33,658
to come out of his super-sized closet,

773
00:44:33,735 --> 00:44:35,498
thus releasing his rage

774
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:39,165
and preventing what looked like to be
an inevitable killing spree.

775
00:44:42,544 --> 00:44:44,409
And most importantly,

776
00:44:44,479 --> 00:44:47,346
they showed us
that no matter whom we choose to love,

777
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:52,046
be they heterosexual, homosexual, asexual,
bisexual, trisexual, quadrisexual,

778
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,350
pansexual, transsexual, omnisexual,

779
00:44:54,423 --> 00:44:59,326
or that thing where the chick ties the belt
around your neck and tinkles on a balloon,

780
00:45:00,963 --> 00:45:05,195
it has absolutely nothing to do
with who we are as people.

781
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:22,077
It's true, Councilman Banks.

782
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:26,252
Let them know.

783
00:45:26,321 --> 00:45:27,788
We're not gay.

784
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:30,482
No.

785
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,588
Unfortunately, we hurt people,

786
00:45:34,663 --> 00:45:39,123
people we wouldn't want to hurt
in a million years, by doing what we did.

787
00:45:40,502 --> 00:45:44,461
For the record,
the word "faggot," that's a bad word.

788
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:47,440
Don't use it.
I used to say it more than anybody,

789
00:45:47,509 --> 00:45:49,500
but I was ignorant.
It's hurtful.

790
00:45:49,745 --> 00:45:52,771
It's like "kike" for me.

791
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:55,146
Or "fat boy" for me.

792
00:45:57,219 --> 00:45:58,880
It stings a little
when you poke fun of my weight.

793
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:00,444
I didn't know that.
Yeah, sometimes it...

794
00:46:00,522 --> 00:46:02,422
I only do it 'cause you do it.
I know, but I work hard...

795
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:05,551
<i>What is this? Gays of Our Lives?</i>

796
00:46:06,094 --> 00:46:08,119
Shall we cue the violins?

797
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:11,024
This isn't a folk concert,
it's a hearing.

798
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:16,366
And I believe I hear the sound
of two felons going to jail

799
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:19,701
for stealing from the City of New York.

800
00:46:19,775 --> 00:46:22,801
What exactly have we stolen? Nothing!

801
00:46:23,812 --> 00:46:26,610
Due to a weird rule
in a flawed system,

802
00:46:26,681 --> 00:46:29,548
my friend Larry here had
to create this lie.

803
00:46:29,618 --> 00:46:32,485
The system may be flawed at times,
Mr. Feb-blueberry.

804
00:46:32,554 --> 00:46:34,021
"I'm in a calendar!"

805
00:46:35,757 --> 00:46:38,988
But it's the law.
And we all have to abide by it.

806
00:46:42,631 --> 00:46:45,122
I'm sorry,
but you did break the law.

807
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,258
Oh, God.

808
00:46:46,334 --> 00:46:47,562
Daddy!

809
00:46:48,804 --> 00:46:50,829
Councilman Banks. Councilman.

810
00:46:52,007 --> 00:46:53,941
Well, you better
have cuffs for three,

811
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:56,273
because I'm going
to jail with them.

812
00:46:56,344 --> 00:46:57,834
How is that, Captain?

813
00:46:57,913 --> 00:47:00,609
I'm a co-conspirator.
I knew all about this little scam

814
00:47:00,682 --> 00:47:02,707
from day one,
and I didn't say a thing about it.

815
00:47:02,784 --> 00:47:04,308
Captain!
You don't have to do this. Please.

816
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:05,410
Yeah, he didn't know nothing.

817
00:47:05,487 --> 00:47:07,478
Fine. I'll have all three of you arrested.

818
00:47:09,691 --> 00:47:14,094
Slap some cuffs on me,
'cause I helped them plan the wedding.

819
00:47:14,162 --> 00:47:15,686
I drove them to the airport.

820
00:47:15,764 --> 00:47:17,231
I picked out Chuck's dress.

821
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:18,323
Yeah, I knew about it.

822
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,960
Dress? Why does everybody
assume I'm the woman?

823
00:47:21,036 --> 00:47:23,095
Is it the way I walk?
What is it?

824
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:26,368
And I caught the bouquet!
In my mouth. I liked it.

825
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,574
See, that's the way it works
with us firemen, sir.

826
00:47:30,645 --> 00:47:33,205
You throw one of us in the fire,
we all go rushing in.

827
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:38,546
You throw one of us in jail,
you gotta throw the whole lot of us in jail.

828
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,180
So? What's it gonna be?

829
00:47:44,226 --> 00:47:46,421
Everything would have been fine
if you'd just let

830
00:47:46,495 --> 00:47:48,156
me and Larry make out
like we were gonna.

831
00:47:48,263 --> 00:47:50,254
Then you had to go
all Knute Rockne on us.

832
00:47:50,332 --> 00:47:53,199
I am your commanding officer.
I will not be addressed in that manner.

833
00:47:53,268 --> 00:47:55,429
Not in here you're not,
you porcupine-head.

834
00:47:55,504 --> 00:47:57,597
No, in here you're the big mouth
who got us locked up.

835
00:47:57,672 --> 00:47:59,071
We should whup your ass!

836
00:47:59,141 --> 00:48:00,369
Yeah!
Yeah!

837
00:48:01,643 --> 00:48:02,905
That's right.

838
00:48:02,978 --> 00:48:04,104
Hey, Chuck.

839
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:06,010
Jeez, Larry. What?

840
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:10,848
Free Chuck and Larry!
Free Chuck and Larry!

841
00:48:11,553 --> 00:48:12,713
What?

842
00:48:12,787 --> 00:48:15,119
Yo, dum-dums! You got a visitor.

843
00:48:18,693 --> 00:48:21,628
Well, gentlemen,
that was quite a hearing.

844
00:48:21,696 --> 00:48:22,822
Mr. Levine, Mr. Valentine.

845
00:48:22,898 --> 00:48:24,388
All right.

846
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,728
The city would like to offer you a deal.

847
00:48:27,802 --> 00:48:30,794
We're willing to drop all charges
and allow you to keep your benefits,

848
00:48:30,872 --> 00:48:32,339
with two conditions.

849
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,898
One, you plead guilty
to falsifying a government form.

850
00:48:36,111 --> 00:48:38,875
The charge is reduced to a misdemeanor,
you get a slap on the wrist,

851
00:48:38,947 --> 00:48:40,710
and the city saves face.

852
00:48:40,782 --> 00:48:42,010
Done.
Done. Absolutely.

853
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:45,280
Two, you are celebrities
in the gay community now.

854
00:48:45,754 --> 00:48:48,120
They've obviously
not only accepted your apology,

855
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,624
they think you're heroes.

856
00:48:50,692 --> 00:48:54,788
Now, raising money
for AIDS research is still very crucial,

857
00:48:55,397 --> 00:48:58,924
and the community has
figured out a way for you all to help.

858
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,194
Whatever it takes.
Yeah.

859
00:49:00,268 --> 00:49:01,428
What do you need us to do?
We're in.

860
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:45,275
These two guys right here talking
about doing something pretty serious.

861
00:49:45,347 --> 00:49:49,477
Making a commitment
to love each other forever.

862
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:53,817
Now before, they were on the down-low,
living a life that was a lie.

863
00:49:55,223 --> 00:49:58,556
Now, in a lie,
it's like a circle.

864
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:00,959
It never ends.

865
00:50:01,496 --> 00:50:04,397
You know?
It's not like a rectangle.

866
00:50:04,466 --> 00:50:07,060
'Cause that has a bunch of,
you know, places that stop.

867
00:50:07,135 --> 00:50:08,329
This one is a big circle of...

868
00:50:08,403 --> 00:50:10,166
Okay, you know, wrap up the circle thing.
Come on.

869
00:50:10,238 --> 00:50:11,569
Moving on.

870
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,902
I'm gonna move quicker now.

871
00:50:14,643 --> 00:50:17,271
Do you, Kevin "Butterfly" McDonough,

872
00:50:17,345 --> 00:50:22,214
take Fred G. Duncan to be
your lawful wedded partner?

873
00:50:23,184 --> 00:50:24,412
I dizoo.

874
00:50:25,387 --> 00:50:27,582
And do you, Fred G. Duncan,

875
00:50:27,656 --> 00:50:31,319
take this guy over here
to be your lawfully wedded partner?

876
00:50:31,393 --> 00:50:32,655
I do.

877
00:50:32,727 --> 00:50:34,319
Well, then, by the power vested in me

878
00:50:34,396 --> 00:50:37,160
by the Commonwealth of Canada
and the Province of Ontario,

879
00:50:37,232 --> 00:50:41,168
which has always been very pro-gay,
unlike that uptight country to the south,

880
00:50:41,236 --> 00:50:45,502
it's my pleasure to now pronounce
you husband and husband, partners for life.

881
00:51:19,407 --> 00:51:21,637
There's my lawyer.

882
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:23,575
You don't wanna dance, do you?

883
00:51:24,012 --> 00:51:26,071
I don't think so.

884
00:51:26,681 --> 00:51:29,172
Your brother forgave me.
Now, why can't you?

885
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:34,153
Well, my brother wasn't the one
that you felt up under false pretenses.

886
00:51:34,222 --> 00:51:36,918
You mean you only let me touch your boobs
'cause you thought I was gay?

887
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:38,181
That's sexist.

888
00:51:38,326 --> 00:51:41,989
I could bring that to the courtroom.
You could be my lawyer.

889
00:51:44,532 --> 00:51:46,090
Look at Larry, though.

890
00:51:46,735 --> 00:51:48,965
Looks like he took my advice
and moved on.

891
00:51:49,037 --> 00:51:53,098
Which is great for him, but I don't
have anybody to hang out with anymore.

892
00:51:53,174 --> 00:51:57,577
I mean, these bracelets here...
It says, "Friends forever."

893
00:51:59,848 --> 00:52:03,750
I haven't taken this thing off
since we made them that day. You?

894
00:52:06,087 --> 00:52:08,214
Yeah, that's what I thought.

895
00:52:23,004 --> 00:52:26,405
Well, you've got about 30 seconds
before I come to my senses.

896
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:30,375
Really?
Yes.

897
00:52:30,445 --> 00:52:33,710
And this is my jam, too.
Come on.

898
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:36,676
What a delicious-looking cake!

899
00:52:36,851 --> 00:52:40,150
Oh, maybe Tori
would like to try it.

900
00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:42,689
That's nice. You gay, her father.
It's nice.

901
00:52:42,757 --> 00:52:45,282
No, I'm not gay.
This is Larry's daughter, Tori.

902
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,692
Oh, it's okay, man.
You can come out of the down-low.

903
00:52:47,762 --> 00:52:49,559
I don't have to come out!
I'm married.

904
00:52:49,631 --> 00:52:51,326
Which one's your husband?
You point him out.

905
00:52:51,399 --> 00:52:52,957
No, no! The lady in there.

906
00:52:53,034 --> 00:52:54,194
Which guy?

907
00:52:54,269 --> 00:52:55,361
No, no guy. No.

908
00:52:55,437 --> 00:52:58,270
Hey, you know when you lie,
it's like a circle.

909
00:52:58,339 --> 00:52:59,363
I'm not lying!

910
00:53:00,363 --> 00:53:10,363
