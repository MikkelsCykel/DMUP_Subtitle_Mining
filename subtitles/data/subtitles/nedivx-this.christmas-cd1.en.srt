00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,751
- Ma'Dere?
- Morning, Joe.

2
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,639
You know, Christmas is almost here.

3
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,238
Here's your clothes, all packed.
Just put them in the garage.

4
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,589
How long do you think
we're gonna keep this up?

5
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,433
As long as the good Lord allows.

6
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,068
- Want me to get your bathroom stuff?
- I'll get it.

7
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,007
All right, guys. Let's go. Your
dad's gonna be here in a minute.

8
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,077
- You said you were outside.
- I just had a few more things to do.

9
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,390
- That's not what you said.
- I need to turn off...

10
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,471
But it's okay.

11
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,915
Let's hit the freeway
before traffic gets bad.

12
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,594
- Let's go. All right.
- Yes, Malcolm.

13
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,394
All right, guys. Let's rock and roll.

14
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,634
Tonight?

15
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,629
Thank you.

16
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,751
- T, let me get my drink, please, baby.
- You got it, Q.

17
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,559
Christmas in Chicago
is always slow, ain't it?

18
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,598
Oh, yeah, man, you know,
everybody out shopping.

19
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,352
Here you go.

20
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,230
Come on, let's go!

21
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,474
Damn!

22
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,232
Fool.

23
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,829
Baby, what is that?

24
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,798
This a early Christmas present
from Joe. It's called a Nikon.

25
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,439
It's the Rolls-Royce of cameras.

26
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,273
Joe! Tell me you didn't get
this boy that camera.

27
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,271
- Don't start.
- We talked about that.

28
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,396
- It's Christmas, baby.
- It's too expensive.

29
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,630
Let it go.

30
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,994
Let it go.

31
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,879
Matter of fact, snap this.

32
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,268
Here.

33
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,591
- Merry Christmas. Now...
- Guess he told you.

34
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,990
Boy, take this grocery list
and go to the store.

35
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,071
Before that lip gets you into trouble.

36
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,515
- This everything? You sure?
- Yeah.

37
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,829
I wrote it down.

38
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,070
Sometimes you forget stuff.
I gotta come back.

39
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,515
You forget stuff and have
to go back. Hurry up.

40
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,272
I have to change clothes.

41
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,998
Get ready to cook.

42
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,594
Ma'Dere want me to go to the store.
You want something?

43
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,954
No, I'm good.

44
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,156
I wanted to thank you too
for the camera.

45
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,754
- You know, I love it.
- When I was your age...

46
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,435
...I wanted a watch about as bad
as you wanted that camera.

47
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,034
Nobody could afford it.

48
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,998
You take some nice pictures
with that thing.

49
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,948
- Come here, boy.
- Oh, man.

50
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,111
You gonna do all this
lovey-dove stuff.

51
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,430
- I'm almost grown.
- Go on, get out of here.

52
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,238
She gonna start cooking any minute.

53
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,789
Don't hurt nobody on that bike.

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,718
Merry Christmas, Lisa.

55
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,714
Oh, baby, please. You're gonna
drive me crazy with that camera.

56
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,474
Come on, where your
Christmas spirit at? Come on.

57
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,395
- Ma, you told them 6:00, right?
- They know.

58
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,472
- They should be here.
- Stop. They been eating dinner at 6...

59
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,437
...ever since they could eat.
They know.

60
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,158
- Look.
- Baby, get out with that.

61
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,878
You're making me nervous. Go.

62
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,314
Come and taste some of this.

63
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,119
- I want your stamp of approval.
- Okay.

64
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,669
Should have told them 4,
then they'd be here on time.

65
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,753
It's frustrating being the only person
in this family that understands a clock.

66
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,354
You know your brothers
and sisters are always late.

67
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,794
That don't make it right.

68
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,474
Why don't you come late,
so that way you on time?

69
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,108
- You know what? See, you...
- Mama, get her.

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,592
This is like hitting the lottery.

71
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,230
<i>- Especially if we finance it ourselves.</i>
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

72
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,992
I'd be a millionaire before I'm 40.

73
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,594
I should be able to get
a couple hundred thousand...

74
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,988
...while I'm in New York.

75
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,674
But you're gonna have
to match that, at least.

76
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,956
<i>I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>I can get a chunk of it</i> here.

77
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,157
- Well, that would be a happy holiday.
- Yes, it would.

78
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,595
- Now, that's a car right there.
- Come on, Joe.

79
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,352
I'll call you when I get a chance.

80
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,232
- Nice.
- Hey.

81
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,833
Nice.

82
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,948
Got that new-car smell
and everything.

83
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,669
Damn, you got your name on the car?
Can't nobody steal it.

84
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,832
Hey, Joe, you need to get
some of these for your funeral home.

85
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,797
Hey, how much this set you back?

86
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,190
My old man's got a dealership
in San Francisco...

87
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,430
...so I got a deal,
but they run for about 60.

88
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,670
It's a smart investment.

89
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,876
Kelli's got herself a new car too.

90
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,393
Merry Christmas.

91
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,711
- Guess she's smart like you, Malcolm.
- Hey, girl.

92
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,871
- Joe, how you doing?
- Good.

93
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,429
- Good to see you.
- You too.

94
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,909
You look like your mama
more and more every day.

95
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,991
Get over here and hug me, girl.

96
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,152
- And if you wasn't my cousin...
- Oh, yeah. You're all talk.

97
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,995
Maybe, but when you gonna
put me in a commercial?

98
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,439
- Malcolm.
- Kelli.

99
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,830
Let's get inside.
Mama can't wait to see you.

100
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,911
- Get the rest of those bags.
- Okay.

101
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,469
- What you got in these bags, girl?
- Lots of goodies.

102
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,438
- Yeah? You bring anything for me?
- Of course.

103
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,160
If I get any free time,
I'm gonna call you later.

104
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,709
Lisa, you regifted me last year.
I don't like that.

105
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,871
You know you wanted
that frame, and that's...

106
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,838
- All right?
- You think I didn't notice. I noticed it.

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,558
All right, baby. Bye.

108
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,438
You could've bought me something.

109
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,079
Did you see the frame, Rosie?

110
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,915
- Merry Christmas, everybody.
- Hey, merry Christmas.

111
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,833
Damn, Baby, look at you,
getting taller by the minute.

112
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,309
You guys better stop calling him Baby,
because he's almost a grown man.

113
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,995
He's my youngest,
no matter how tall or old he gets.

114
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,718
He'll always be my baby.

115
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,598
Ain't that right. She's just a hater.

116
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,274
You just treat him special
because he's your favourite.

117
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,954
My favourite is whoever
I'm talking to at that second.

118
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,509
The one that needs
Mother's love the most.

119
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,274
You should've called us.
Malcolm would have picked you up.

120
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,635
- Maybe you'd have been on time.
- I got a car.

121
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,518
See our new Escalade outside?

122
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,478
- You know, I rented a BMW convertible.
- Sexy.

123
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,870
- Hey, can I try that?
- Like that's gonna happen.

124
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,917
Can't blame a brother for trying.

125
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,072
So I guess that means things
are going well on the job?

126
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,391
I can't complain.
I just completed a perfume spot.

127
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,632
You need to let me come to New York
so I can get my photography on.

128
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,429
What you need to do is get a college
degree, just like your big sister.

129
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,478
So, Ma'Dere, is there anything else
we need to do around here?

130
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,915
- Y'all want me to make something?
- No.

131
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,036
What? I can cook.

132
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,838
Girl, you can't make reservations.

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,468
She orders up a mean Chinese.
Ten-hut.

134
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,238
Merry Christmas, Claude!

135
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,992
- Oh, my child.
- Hi, Mama.

136
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,358
- You look so good in your uniform.
- You look like a formal peanut.

137
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,750
Claude's got all them girls
going berserk.

138
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,309
They take one look
at a fine specimen like myself...

139
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,755
...and can we say "Denzel"?

140
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,952
Yeah, when are you gonna settle down?

141
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,590
Well, I know, whoever she is, just
make sure she's taking care of you...

142
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,718
...and she can cook like your big sis.
- Some of us were busy...

143
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,589
...going to college while others chose
to stay home and learn how to cook.

144
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,035
And those who stayed home
helped with the cleaners...

145
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,794
...while the rest of us,
who shall remain nameless...

146
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,315
...jetted off to college
the first chance they got.

147
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,072
Are you two listening to yourself?

148
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,470
A stranger wouldn't know
you were sisters.

149
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,915
- She started it.
- I don't care. I'm finishing it.

150
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,116
Kelli, fix some Kool-Aid
for the kids.

151
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,589
Are you sure you don't want me
to make something?

152
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,035
- No.
- Damn.

153
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,077
Don't hurt yourself.
Kool-Aid, simple.

154
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,389
Play to your strengths.

155
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,797
Stop it. Claude, let the men know...

156
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,951
...we'll be eating
as soon as Mel gets here.

157
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,712
I'm gonna get out of this uniform.

158
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,668
- Okay, so I just need...
- Water, sugar. Help her out, please.

159
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,115
Where'd you get those pants?

160
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,828
I look good, huh?

161
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,752
Gentlemen.

162
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,798
Ma'Dere said the food is ready.
We'll eat when Mel gets here.

163
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,114
- So, what's up with you, Malcolm?
- Nothing much, man.

164
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,759
Good things. Good things.

165
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,399
Except for the storm on its way.

166
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,471
Who said it don't rain in California?

167
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,953
Rains, fires, mudslides.
I think God don't like California.

168
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,074
- Hey, everybody. Merry Christmas.
- Hey!

169
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,471
Oh, my God. Look at my... Hey!

170
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,154
- Hey, Fred. How you doing?
- Hey. Now we can eat.

171
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,389
Welcome home, Mel.

172
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,199
Ma'Dere didn't tell me
you got leave. Hi.

173
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,793
I couldn't miss Mama's cooking.

174
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,315
I missed you.
Where's everybody? Where's Lisa?

175
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,391
- In the kitchen.
- Let me go say hi to her.

176
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,915
You go do that. Get in there.

177
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,629
You got a name, homes?

178
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,233
Devean.

179
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,672
Brooks.

180
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,116
Well, you know, she did
always like them articulate.

181
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,475
I'm about to go change.
I'll show you your room.

182
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,676
- Come on, get your bags.
- It's okay.

183
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,149
Y'all are punks, man.

184
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,272
- Devean Brooks.
- Brooks.

185
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,156
Can we join hands?

186
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,996
Bless, O Lord, almighty God...

187
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,152
...the Whitfield family and home.
May health, purity...

188
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,471
...goodness, meekness,
and every virtue, Father...

189
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,029
...reign on this Christmas holiday.

190
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,236
May all who visit here...

191
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,393
...be blessed with faithfulness
to thy law and thankfulness to God...

192
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,835
...the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.

193
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,117
May this blessing remain
on this family, Father...

194
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,716
...this home
and all who dwell here, Father...

195
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,348
...through Christ, our Lord.
- Amen.

196
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,592
- Okay. Dig in, everybody.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,239
Pass that corn bread down here.

198
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,436
Macaroni and cheese.

199
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,194
- What...? Don't put that on your plate.
- I got peas.

200
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,191
No, that's turkey.

201
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,999
Everybody's good?

202
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,753
Okay, okay, everybody.

203
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,751
Let's do the family business first.

204
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,275
Here are the shares
of the profit from the cleaners.

205
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,910
Okay? Each one of you has your own.
There you are.

206
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,594
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, Mama.

207
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,671
You know you didn't have to do that.

208
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,068
We didn't expect anything.

209
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,595
- I do. Thank you, Mama.
- Oh, you're welcome, baby.

210
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,193
- Can you warm this up?
- Sure.

211
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,590
- It came out of the oven.
- He likes his food hot.

212
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,239
I'll put it in the microwave.

213
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,436
That thing's going off
like a drug dealer.

214
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,397
Well, if you must know,
it's my ladies.

215
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,358
It's Christmastime, and they wanna
spend time with a brother.

216
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,399
I know Baby better not be
bringing any babies in here.

217
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,915
It's time for me to have
that special conversation.

218
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,752
Too late.
Me and Joe already had it.

219
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,878
Yeah, I learned more
than I needed to. Trust me.

220
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,600
I'm gonna take this in the other room.
Excuse me.

221
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,113
Thank you, baby.

222
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,679
You mind?

223
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,119
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

224
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,395
When you're finished...

225
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,233
...pass the plate over here
and I'll chew it for him too.

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,753
- Shut up, Kelli.
- So, Joe...

227
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,990
...what do you got planned
for the holiday?

228
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,152
Well, after breakfast,
Baby's gonna take the family photo.

229
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,719
We're gonna go buy the tree.

230
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,950
Then Christmas morning
we're going to church.

231
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,997
I didn't know your father
was a minister.

232
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,232
No, he's not. He's a deacon.
And he's not my father.

233
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,913
My bad.

234
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,674
Yeah, our father moved on.

235
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,268
I'm sorry to hear that.

236
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,317
No, he didn't die. He just moved on.

237
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,037
So, Devean...

238
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,390
...you and Mel go
to the same school, huh?

239
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,994
She goes to Spelman.
It's an all-girls school.

240
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,752
I knew that.

241
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,071
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. I knew that.

242
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,753
- I go to Morehouse.
- So...

243
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,388
...how do you like attending
an all-black college?

244
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,074
- Don't start with that nonsense.
- I went to Princeton...

245
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,071
I went to Harvard. What's your point?

246
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,071
Can you let the man
speak for himself?

247
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,233
Go on. I just wanna know
what your experience is like...

248
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,595
...attending an all-black college.
- Ignore him.

249
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,718
I wanna answer. Morehouse has certain
foundational principles...

250
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,552
...by which its existence stands.

251
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,599
It includes an appreciation for the
ideas of justice, equality, democracy...

252
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,432
...humane treatment of all people...

253
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,670
...development of spiritual self
and community.

254
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,115
Sounds like you got it from
the mission statement.

255
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,919
I did. But that's also why I go there.

256
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,433
Not because it's all-black...

257
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,433
...but because it embodies
beliefs and traditions I value.

258
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,149
The fact that all the students
look just like me is a bonus.

259
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,834
- I like that, young man.
- Well said.

260
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,549
Well, Mel, your boyfriend has
a good head on his shoulders.

261
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,316
I hope some of his smarts rubs off
on my little professional student.

262
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,355
Stop, now. Mel's smart.
She's just, you know, slow.

263
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,512
- Getting her four-year degree in what?
- Seven years.

264
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,399
I've changed my major a few times.
Nothing wrong with that.

265
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,710
First a doctor, then a journalist.
Now what?

266
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,233
- Pre-law.
- Pre-law.

267
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,188
Mel's major is always determined
by whomever she's dating at the time.

268
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,759
Devean, what's your major?

269
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,319
- Pre-law.
- Damn.

270
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,959
Come on.

271
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,554
That is wrong on so many
different levels.

272
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,958
That was so good, Ma'Dere.

273
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,270
We have some sock-it-to-me cake.
You want some?

274
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,275
As tempting as that sounds, Ma'Dere,
I do have to make a couple more stops.

275
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,476
Let me see you out. Hold up.

276
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,672
- Bye, family.
- Bye.

277
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,193
Bye, Fred.

278
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,871
- That boy, he need to slow down.
- He does.

279
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,917
I know.
How many kids he have now?

280
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,195
- Six?
- Seven.

281
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,600
- Seven?
- Seven.

282
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,314
I'm gonna hurt him real bad
when we find him.

283
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,596
Not till we get that 25 G's
he owes Luther.

284
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,910
Or Luther will hurt you.

285
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,036
Don't let your temper
get you dead, man.

286
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,952
What happens
if he can't cover the bet?

287
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,271
It's on Luther, man. I wouldn't wanna
be Quentin Whitfield, though.

288
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,390
- We about to run a Boston on you.
- Believe that if you want to.

289
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,149
I think now is a good time for us
to discuss the dry-cleaner situation.

290
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,311
We have a dry-cleaner situation?

291
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,710
Ma'Dere's been running
the cleaners for 20 years.

292
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,758
What little money she makes
goes to maintaining this house.

293
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,230
Whatever's left over after that,
she gives us in these yearly cheques...

294
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,231
...that amount to, what, lunch money?

295
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,834
You spending way too much money
on lunch.

296
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,075
Look, we each own a percentage
of the cleaners.

297
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,629
I think it's a good idea if we sold it.

298
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,279
You trying to sell the cleaners?

299
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,273
- She wanna sell her portion, let her.
- Hey, I'll buy it.

300
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,079
You can't sell a percentage.
We have to sell all of it.

301
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,117
I guess you're shit out of luck...

302
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,874
...because we don't
have to do anything.

303
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,349
Well, we haven't been
doing anything.

304
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,476
And I'm the one that's keeping
the books.

305
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,074
How is Ma'Dere gonna maintain
this place if we sell?

306
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,276
Mel, she doesn't need
a place this big.

307
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,032
You trying to sell the house too?

308
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,112
Well, especially since Baby
is gonna be graduating soon.

309
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,510
I mean, he's gonna wanna
move out eventually.

310
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,194
Says who? I ain't going nowhere.

311
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,794
Please. All these little girls
chasing after you...

312
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,951
...you are gonna wanna get
your own place.

313
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,078
All I know is everybody here
but me came home for the holidays.

314
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,915
You sell this house and you ain't gonna
have a home to come back to.

315
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,799
It's that simple. I mean,
do what y'all want.

316
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,871
I got a date. I'm gonna holler at y'all.

317
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,271
Well, despite what Baby says, he is
gonna wanna move out eventually.

318
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,670
This place is just too big
for Joe and Ma'Dere.

319
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,274
I mean, they can get
a smaller place. Maybe a condo.

320
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,159
What makes you think Ma'Dere
wants to live with Joe?

321
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,313
Hello. He's been living with her
since you left for school.

322
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,548
- Joe's been living here?
- Where have you been?

323
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,711
Think you the only one
getting her freak on?

324
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,111
Okay, stop. My God.
That is too much information.

325
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,431
I can't hear about Ma'Dere
getting her freak on.

326
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,511
I don't wanna intrude
in family business...

327
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,715
Then don't.

328
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,395
This was probably your idea, anyway.

329
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,834
You know, Kelli...

330
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,150
...I'm not gonna dignify that
with a response.

331
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,231
You don't have to.
You put her up to this.

332
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,038
- Oh, come on.
- So you think...

333
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,270
...I'm not smart enough
to come up with this?

334
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,556
No, you're weak-willed
and easily influenced.

335
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,917
- So you're saying my wife is stupid.
- I think she said "weak-willed."

336
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,959
I said, you sometimes allow
other people to think for you.

337
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,395
- So now I can't think for myself?
- You know what?

338
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,676
Why don't you concentrate
on the paprika?

339
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,310
Kelli, I know exactly where
I wanna put the paprika. Kelli.

340
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,392
Everybody just bring it down a notch.
It's not that deep.

341
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,869
The thing to do is just
to put in a family vote.

342
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,032
Well, we can't have a family vote
without the whole family.

343
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,998
Quentin isn't here, so there.

344
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,150
Dessert, anyone?

345
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,910
Go ahead, now.

346
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,868
<i>Go, bougie. Go, bougie. Go, bougie.</i>

347
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,796
That's my baby right there!

348
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,480
Come on, Devean.
Let's see what you got.

349
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,273
Come on, Mama.

350
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,112
He's here.

351
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,358
Quentin! Oh, my goodness.

352
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,751
- Hey, Mama.
- Oh, baby. You're home.

353
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,036
- Oh, look at you.
- Whitfield!

354
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,119
So I've been doing a lot of travelling,
you know, touring. I went to Japan.

355
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,838
I recorded an album out there.

356
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,353
It's been four years.

357
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,432
You haven't changed a bit.
You still look great.

358
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,875
- Don't blow his head up.
- Thank you, baby.

359
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,917
- You look good too.
- Thank you.

360
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,638
You didn't bring no luggage, man?

361
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,189
No, no. I just, you know...

362
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,113
I got another tour,
so I sent my stuff ahead.

363
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,397
So you're not gonna be
staying past Christmas?

364
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,516
Ma, I might make it back
before New Year's.

365
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,999
I'm just not sure yet.

366
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,990
Well, I guess I'll go up
and finish your room.

367
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,991
I wasn't expecting you to be home.

368
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,720
Lisa, take care of him, now,
till I get back.

369
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,598
Oh, my gosh.
You have got to see Baby.

370
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,035
- He's almost as tall as you.
- Get out of here.

371
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,270
- He really is.
- He's not short like you?

372
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,032
Oh, be quiet.

373
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,191
You won't believe
the stuff Joe has planned.

374
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,316
- Joe?
- Yes.

375
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,232
We have a big breakfast
in the morning.

376
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,358
And then the mens are gonna go
get the Christmas tree.

377
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,795
On Christmas morning,
we'll be going to church.

378
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,793
Church? You know I don't do church.
Come on, man.

379
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,188
So, what's that mean, man?

380
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,068
You don't do church.

381
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,071
Church ain't something you do.

382
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,470
It's a place you go to commune
in God's house.

383
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,868
I don't believe in God.

384
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,157
- Not in the traditional sense.
- Not in the traditional sense?

385
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,436
I mean, I'm a spiritual person,
you know.

386
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,352
I believe in a higher source. But...

387
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,312
- But you don't believe in God.
- I don't believe in your God, Joe.

388
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,959
Okay.

389
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,796
I'm gonna go let Ma'Dere
know I'm leaving.

390
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,393
- I'll see y'all.
- Okay.

391
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,709
All right. You do that.

392
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,269
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night. Drive safe.

393
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,075
- Why you gotta be like that?
- Whatever. Whatever.

394
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,073
- "You do that, Joe."
- He ain't my daddy.

395
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,037
How he come in?
We having a meeting.

396
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,430
- Come on, now. You know it's Joe.
- I don't care.

397
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,433
Quentin is the problem.

398
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,679
If Quentin says no,
Ma'Dere's not going for it.

399
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,592
The guy doesn't even live here.

400
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,513
Ever since Senior left,
he's got this weird hold on Ma'Dere.

401
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,910
Okay, well, Lisa,
you're his sister, right?

402
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,832
Talk some sense into the man.

403
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,993
I'm telling you, Malcolm. We've been
through this over and over again. I...

404
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,879
I don't know what it is, but it's like...

405
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,834
I don't know.

406
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,719
Same damn reason Joe and Ma'Dere
put on these charades...

407
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,552
...like Joe doesn't live here.

408
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,598
Oh, come on. You telling me
that Quentin doesn't know?

409
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,320
No. Quentin doesn't know.
Trust me. He can't stand Joe.

410
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,516
He's been that way
ever since he was a kid.

411
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,990
Like he thinks one day
Senior's gonna come back.

412
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,791
Hey. Hey, Lisa.

413
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,989
Lisa?

414
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,272
What?

415
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,916
Never mind.

416
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,033
You said your dad moved on.

417
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,758
What does that mean?

418
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,118
A little after Baby was born...

419
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,748
...Senior decided to go off and,
as Ma'Dere puts it...

420
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,797
...chase his dream of playing jazz.

421
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,190
He upped and left
and moved to Europe.

422
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,749
She wouldn't let Quentin Jr.
take up the saxophone.

423
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,593
She was afraid he'd leave too,
but she couldn't stop him.

424
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,796
- And did he?
- What?

425
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,029
Up and leave her?

426
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,634
First time he's been home
in four years.

427
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,997
A lot of phone calls and postcards,
but he's a wanderer too.

428
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,752
Senior's piano is in the garage.

429
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,595
She thinks that music is the root
of the evil that's taken her men away.

430
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,797
Hell, the rest of us are afraid
to even hum.

431
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,910
Look at that smile, girl.

432
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,559
I love to see you happy.

433
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,110
Well, it's because you are such
a good man, Joe Black.

434
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,033
You're a real good woman,
Shirley Ann Whitfield.

435
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,589
And beautiful too.

436
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,398
Okay.

437
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,120
- Tomorrow morning?
- First thing.

438
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,872
I'm gonna pick up a few things.

439
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,758
I'm gonna take off, but I'll be back.

440
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,399
Okay.

441
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,676
Merry Christmas, baby.

442
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,638
Malcolm.

443
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,071
Malcolm.

444
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,356
Malcolm.

445
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,830
Hey, baby.

446
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,076
I thought you had gone.

447
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,997
I was checking something
for your mother.

448
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,789
Oh, yeah? What's that, Joe?

449
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,152
Christmas lights, brother.

450
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,195
We might pick some up
when we're out tomorrow.

451
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,793
Okay.

452
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,270
- You know what?
- What?

453
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,637
I'm gonna tell you something
as a courtesy to Ma'Dere.

454
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,199
Now, I'm only here a few days. You
might wanna steer clear until I'm gone.

455
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,113
And I'm gonna say this
as a courtesy to you.

456
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,591
I'm here because your mother
wants me here.

457
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,479
If you got a problem with that,
you take it up with her.

458
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,517
I'll do that.

459
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,955
If I was here, Senior...

460
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,998
...I'd look after your old piano, man.

461
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,431
Yes, I would.

462
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,278
Hey, Kelli, girl. What you doing?

463
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,431
Just unpacking, Mama.

464
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,353
When you gonna settle down, child,
like your sister?

465
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,433
Where is this coming from?

466
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,474
I just love you.
I want you to be happy.

467
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,359
Well, I don't have a problem
settling down, Mama.

468
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,590
I have a problem settling for...

469
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,273
...less.

470
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,193
I'm just focused on my career
right now.

471
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,672
Long as you remember your career
is not gonna keep you warm at night.

472
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,430
All right. Night-night.

473
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,874
Night.

474
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,793
Need some batteries?

475
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,520
No, no. I'm not whispering.

476
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,874
No. No, everybody's cool.

477
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,478
Did you eat?

478
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,231
Okay, yeah, just meet me at the...

479
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,710
There's a club called the El Rey.
It's off Wilshire.

480
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,235
Yeah. Just take a cab there.

481
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,391
I'll meet you there in a little bit.

482
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,390
Yeah. Okay.

483
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,231
- Bad girl?
- Come here.

484
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,356
What are you doing?
In your mother's house?

485
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,590
Yeah. You're gonna get tore down.

486
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,594
- Hey. I thought you were asleep.
- No, I was in the garage.

487
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,433
I don't have my sax,
so I thought I'd play Senior's piano.

488
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,273
- That thing's still out there?
- Yeah.

489
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,398
It needs to get tuned,
but it still works.

490
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,836
- What you doing up?
- I can never sleep in a strange place.

491
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,675
This ain't a strange place.
It's your home. Pass a napkin.

492
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,358
You hear that?

493
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,073
Hey, you know,
Lisa wants to sell the dry cleaners.

494
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,037
- Yeah.
- Really?

495
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,476
- You agree with her?
- Oh, I'm only hearing it now.

496
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,676
I don't have an opinion on it.

497
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,469
Well, that's just like you.
Nothing matters. Whatever.

498
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,200
Right. Nothing matters
because this is the first time...

499
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,476
...anybody asking me
my opinion about it.

500
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,835
Well, you're never around
long enough...

501
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,673
...for anybody to ask you anything.

502
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,358
- Do you hear that?
- What?

503
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,795
I don't hear anything.
What are you talking about?

504
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,393
Don't nobody sleep around here?

505
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,028
- Where you going?
- Out.

506
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,078
Oh, no. Don't get stealthy on us.
Out where?

507
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,550
I just thought I'd, you know,
go check up on the old traps.

508
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,711
Oh, cool. I'm coming with.

509
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,348
- I'm good by myself, thanks.
- Hold up. I wanna go too.

510
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,512
- Oh, we should ask everybody.
- Yeah, it's not a group thing.

511
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,069
Well, you know, Quentin,
if Lisa's going, I'm out.

512
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,071
- I've had enough of her.
- No discussion.

513
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,470
- There's no reason to talk.
- No Lisa, no Malcolm.

514
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,437
We gotta ask Mel
and what's-his-name.

515
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,070
- How about no Q, no Kelli.
- It's like Donny or Darryl.

516
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,959
- Something with a D.
- It's like Darryl or Donny.

517
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,758
Devean.

518
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,277
We wanna go.

519
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,838
- Babe, go get that table right there.
- Okay, okay.

520
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,319
I'll quarterback this thing.
What y'all wanna drink?

521
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,515
- A beer.
- Two.

522
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,274
- I'm good.
- See if they got any hot wings.

523
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,714
Okay.

524
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,230
Am I tripping or is brother man
checking me out?

525
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,879
- Where?
- Over there.

526
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,948
- He is peeping you out.
- Yo, I know that cat, man.

527
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,951
We used to go
to high school together.

528
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,396
Gerald. That's who he is.

529
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,233
That might be true,
but he's not checking for you.

530
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,152
- You're from Oceanside?
- Excuse me.

531
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,073
- Oh, we're talking here, cousin.
- But I'm with him.

532
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,629
- Oh, it's like that.
- No pressure. No pressure, man.

533
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,031
- You do your thing.
- Yeah. Stay black.

534
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,589
- Who are they?
- They were just keeping me company...

535
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,832
...while I was waiting for you.
- Oh, okay. Okay.

536
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,831
Can I get four beers
and some hot wings?

537
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,831
We're out of hot wings.

538
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,399
You're jealous.

539
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,039
Of them? Please. Why?

540
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,191
Something's wrong.
You ordered four beers.

541
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,679
That's what took me so long.

542
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,752
My sisters and brother
decided to come, so I didn't...

543
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,195
- Where are they?
- Hang on.

544
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,995
You didn't tell them.

545
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,720
See, there's these things
with my sisters.

546
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,075
And then my brother Quentin
just shows up.

547
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,832
That's a no, right, Claude?

548
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,150
I'm gonna tell them.
I can't do it right now.

549
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,676
- You're ashamed of me.
- That isn't true.

550
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,116
I have to tell Ma'Dere first.
In the morning. All right?

551
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,793
- In the morning?
- In the morning.

552
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,838
I'm gonna hang out with the family.
I'll meet you at the hotel.

553
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,877
- You promise?
- You have my word.

554
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,674
- Love you.
- I love you too.

555
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,877
Now, get out of here.

556
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,276
Y'all ready to get this show started?
Make some noise.

557
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,360
This is open-mike night.
We do this every Sunday.

558
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,034
- Every Sunday we got live...
- Oh, thank you.

559
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,269
- and do they thing.

560
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,512
- Gerald, this is my family. My sister Mel.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

561
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,398
- Kelli right there.
- Nice to meet you.

562
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,074
- Pleasure's all mine.
- This first singer confessed...

563
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,629
...that this is his first time
singing publicly.

564
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,190
- This is my sister's boyfriend, De Von?
- Give it up for Michael Whitfield.

565
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,432
- Make some noise for Michael Whitfield.
- Whatever.

566
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,478
- It's okay, baby.
- Did he just say Michael Whitfield?

567
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,877
Oh, my God, it's Baby.

568
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,709
- This one of your peoples?
- My little brother. What's he doing?

569
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,155
Thanks, everybody.

570
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,478
I'm real nervous, but, I mean, I...

571
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,790
I appreciate the opportunity
for y'all let...

572
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,473
Letting me be out here.

573
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,471
Just letting me
be able to do my thing.

574
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,150
Okay, we need to help him.
Quentin, get him down.

575
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,629
- He's struggling.
- Man. Yo.

576
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,552
Well, I'll be damned.

577
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,109
Damn, Mel.

578
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,748
- Your brother got pipes.
- Can you believe this shit?

579
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,354
Where in the hell did he learn
to sing like that?

580
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,719
He's singing.

581
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,035
Yo.

582
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,309
Sweet.

583
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,552
- Come on, baby, let's go dance.
- All right, let's do this.

584
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,632
- I love this song. Yeah.
- Yeah? You feeling it?

585
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,233
It's sexy.

586
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,751
- Wanna dance?
- No, I'm chilling.

587
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,273
Not you, fool.

588
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,919
Yeah, come on. I'd love to.

589
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,752
You didn't tell me Baby could sing.

590
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,434
- Like we knew.
- Go ahead!

591
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,678
- Where'd everybody go?
- Dance floor.

592
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,990
Come on. Let's go get
some of these honeys.

593
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,196
- I'm good. I'm just chilling.
- You sure?

594
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,952
All right.

595
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,516
Yes! Love you!

596
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,795
Y'all make some noise
for Michael Whitfield.

597
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,996
- Michael Whitfield!
- What's up?

598
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,912
We just wanted to apologise, cousin.

599
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,832
We ain't know that off-brand chick...

600
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,194
- Off what?
- The white girl.

601
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,032
We didn't know she was with you.

602
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,350
- Oh, it's cool.
- I ain't mad at you, though.

603
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,956
- Like I said, it's cool.
- White girls ain't got junk in the trunk.

604
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,190
But I hear they got
some strong knees.

605
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,198
Got a lot to say, huh?

606
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,277
- Come on.
- Who's on their knees now?

607
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,590
- Say it again. Say it again.
- I'm sorry...

608
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,716
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry, man.

609
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,872
Get out of here. Come on.
We gotta go, let's go, let's go.

610
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,717
- Hey. Watch out. Watch out.
- What's wrong with you? You crazy?

611
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,995
Wait, where's Kelli?

612
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,593
- With Gerald.
- Oh, she's good.

613
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,513
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on.

614
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,200
So you pull out a gun on him
because he pissed you off.

615
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,477
You lost your mind? We are Whitfields.
We don't behave that way.

616
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,631
- Listen.
- You listen. What are you thinking?

617
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,074
I think you made your point.

618
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,390
- I don't think I have.
- He pissed me off.

619
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,233
Like you are now. Now, drop it.

620
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,437
All right. All right.

621
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,669
I'll drop it.

622
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,231
You always had
that crazy temper, man.

623
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,960
You'd always just flip out. For what?

624
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,588
I mean, we're in a club.
We got our sisters with us.

625
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,793
What happened in there tonight?

626
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,111
Baby, please leave it alone.
We have moved on from there.

627
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,033
- You don't want Claude to shoot you.
- We moved on, Q.

628
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,395
Yeah, all right. All right.

629
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,593
You got some explaining to do.

630
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,273
- About what?
- "About what?"

631
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,874
How come none of us knew
you can sing?

632
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,678
- Because of him.
- Because of me?

633
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,239
Before she hear you.

634
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,389
Who?

635
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,313
What you think Ma'Dere'd say
if she found out I wanna sing?

636
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,118
Baby, come on. That doesn't mean...

637
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,953
Baby, nothing.
Y'all ain't have to hear it, live with it.

638
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,715
She's telling me how I'm the last
Whitfield man who hasn't left her yet.

639
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,029
She's gonna find out.

640
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,510
But not until I'm ready to tell her,
and certainly not now.

641
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,638
Mama's real happy for this Christmas,
with everyone home.

642
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,279
And I don't wanna ruin it.

643
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,748
You have to promise
that you're not gonna say nothing...

644
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,514
...until I figure a way to say it myself.
- Got you.

645
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,278
And, Mel, tell Kelli not to say
anything in front of Ma'Dere.

646
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,193
- I got you.
- Man, this is too much drama for me.

647
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,511
I say we all get some sleep,
pick this up in the morning.

648
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,159
All right?

649
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,717
You know, Baby...

650
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,833
...you can sing, man.

651
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,392
Good night.

652
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,358
Come on, D. Let's go.

653
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,511
I was proud of you, man.

654
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,911
I'm going to bed.

655
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,958
I've never been
more surprised in my life.

656
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,476
Four years of "maybe this year,"
so this time I didn't even ask him.

657
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,519
Oh, he just walked through that door,
and my heart almost stopped.

658
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,150
I swear, Rosie, sometimes
I thought I'd never see him again.

659
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,278
He's so much like Senior.

660
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,313
Good morning, Kelli, girl.

661
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,993
"Good morning, Mama,"
would be nice.

662
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,151
Yeah. Good morning, Mama.

663
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,959
Let everybody know
breakfast is ready.

664
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,832
He knows it's fine.

665
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,989
No.

666
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,197
No, I... We're not gonna bend
on that, all right?

667
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,511
Please. Give me a break.
Listen. It's a non-issue, all right?

668
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,398
I'll just fly out this afternoon...

669
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,028
...take care of the paperwork,
and then I'll fly back.

670
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,429
Of course the money's there. Money's
been there the whole time. In escrow.

671
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,273
Look, I'll talk to you about it
this afternoon, all right?

672
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,431
Yeah. Sure. All right.

673
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,592
Oh, f...

674
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,909
Can I help you?

675
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,355
Yeah, I just came to tell you
breakfast was ready.

676
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,590
Well, as soon as Lisa
gets out the shower...

677
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,398
...we'll be right down.

678
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,955
Going somewhere?

679
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,671
As a matter of fact, I am.

680
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,354
Gotta fly back to San Francisco,
sign some papers.

681
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,476
You know, business.

682
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,914
Good for you.

683
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,791
One, two, three.

684
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,437
So you really pulled a gun on him?

685
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,556
Yo. Don't tell Ma'Dere. You hear me?

686
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,154
Man, I know.
Where'd you get the gun?

687
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,038
It's my service pistol.

688
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,679
You really was gonna shoot him?

689
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,990
Hell, no. I was just trying
to make a point.

690
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,718
You may think you're grown now...

691
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,269
...but Ma'Dere find out,
she gonna bitch-slap you...

692
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,953
...into the middle of next week.

693
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,509
And you don't wanna
miss Christmas, do you?

694
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,511
Man, go and pick a tree.

695
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,909
You guys decided yet?

696
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,357
- Let's take this one.
- That's a good one.

697
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,478
That there's an ugly-ass tree,
Mr. Black.

698
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,313
- I'm cool with it if Joe cool with it.
- Yeah, I'm with it.

699
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,153
- Yeah, we'll get this one.
- Right.

700
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,393
- Go on, take the photo.
- All right, let's take this picture.

701
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,391
Come on. Come on.

702
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,709
Say "trees."

703
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,030
- Ready?
- Ready.

704
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,238
I don't know what Baby is doing,
but he's killing the game.

705
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,550
Isn't that, like, the third gift
for him today?

706
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,395
The fifth. Put it over there
with the rest of them.

707
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,638
Oh, that's me.

708
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,832
- Oh, my God, it's him.
- Who?

709
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,639
- Gerald, from last night.
- You spent the night with him...

710
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,358
...and you're not gonna answer?
- No.

711
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,398
No, you didn't spend the night,
or no, you're not gonna answer?

712
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,358
Don't get your bra all in a knot.
We didn't sleep together.

713
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,915
You don't wanna waste a night
of sleep with a man like that.

714
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,355
- Was he good?
- You gave him some?

715
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,035
It was a shared experience,
but if you wanna get technical...

716
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,236
...he was the one
doing most of the giving.

717
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,960
- It is the season to give.
- I hope you used protection.

718
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,595
- I'm not stupid.
- Come on, where is it written...

719
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,275
...that a woman can't meet a guy,
get some and then be done with him?

720
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,829
- They have a word for women like that.
- Smart.

721
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,672
- Ho.
- What?

722
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,912
I'm just trying to school you.
You don't wanna end up pregnant...

723
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,435
...and then next thing you know
you got two kids.

724
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,559
Did that just come out of my mouth?

725
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,273
Lisa, I'm ready.

726
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,439
What?

727
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,838
Okay. Lisa, can we go?

728
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,513
I'll see you guys at dinner.

729
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,397
- What's wrong with these two?
- Nothing.

730
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,472
- It's fine. You got everything?
- Yeah. I'm all set.

731
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,751
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Hi. Merry Christmas.

732
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,993
Merry Christmas. Do you have
any messages for room 302?

733
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,037
- No, ma'am. No messages.
- Okay. Thanks.

734
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,755
I can't believe Malcolm wants
to sell the cleaners.

735
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,876
I know. You gonna talk
to Ma'Dere about it?

736
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,190
No. We're gonna handle this
amongst ourselves.

737
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,237
And I'm counting on you
for your support.

738
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,311
- I got you.
- Kelli?

739
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,675
- Yeah?
- Santa's here.

740
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,599
- Santa?
- Santa?

741
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,432
And he asked for you.

742
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,198
Merry Christmas.

743
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,351
- And what is your name, little girl?
- Tori.

744
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,193
Tori. Really?
And what is your name, young man?

745
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,032
- Keshon.
- Keshon.

746
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,113
- Did you write Santa a letter?
- Even Santa calls you that...

747
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,510
...when you sleep with him
on the first night.

748
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,390
Have you been eating some
Christmas cake or anything like that?

749
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,357
Don't worry, I got something really
good. Been good this year?

750
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,909
Because I'm making
a list and I'm checking it twice.

751
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:11,551
- So he's a friend of yours?
- He went to school with Quentin.

752
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,551
Well, you keep your eyes
on those kids.

753
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,109
You have to be careful nowadays.
You never know.

754
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,431
You be careful, okay? I mean,
it's nice and all, what he doing, but...

755
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,149
- Yeah.
- A Santa suit. Lord.

756
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,912
Merry Christmas.

757
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,316
See you, young man.

758
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,988
Come on over here and talk
to Santa, little girl.

759
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,435
Okay.

760
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,918
So, pretty lady...

761
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,514
...what can Santa bring you
for Christmas?

762
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,035
- Well...
- How about peace on earth?

763
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,475
Hell, peace in my family
would do the trick.

764
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,950
Let me see what I can do.
Come on and sit on Santa's lap.

765
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,912
- And then what?
- Depends...

766
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,832
...whether you've
been naughty or nice.

767
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,195
Well, you're Santa.
Aren't you supposed to know?

768
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,271
I know you were pretty naughty
last night.

769
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,352
But Santa can't say it wasn't nice.

770
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,590
- What are you doing here?
- All right, all right.

771
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,752
Well, as you know, I'm a fireman.

772
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,354
We do this every year
for the kids down at the mall.

773
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,397
Since your mama's house
was on the way...

774
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,599
...I figured I'd just come on by
and spread some holiday cheer.

775
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,834
And being that it's Christmas...

776
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,470
...I thought that Santa
would bring you this.

777
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,950
Oh, I forgot that I left that there.

778
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,439
Thank you, Santa.

779
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,319
- Now give Santa some sugar.
- My mother is in the next room.

780
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,835
She can give Santa some sugar too.
Where's she at?

781
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,798
- Okay, that's it. You gotta go.
- All right. Well, listen.

782
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,269
You gotta agree to have drinks
with me tonight.

783
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,795
- Okay. I will.
- All right? Nine o'clock.

784
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,349
- I promise. Sounds good.
- I'm gonna hold you to that.

785
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,159
- All right?
- Out you go.

786
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,952
All right.

787
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,476
Now, you be good,
for goodness' sake.

788
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,794
- Oh, my God.
- You slept with Santa.

789
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,678
I did not know
he was Santa at the time...

790
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:15,517
...but technically, I guess I did.

791
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,758
I don't see why this couldn't wait
until we got back.

792
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,753
Baby, for the hundredth time...

793
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,076
...I'll be back in the morning.

794
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,676
But, Malcolm, it's Christmas Eve.

795
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,115
Bill collectors don't care.

796
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,033
The car we drive,
the house we live in?

797
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,395
They don't pay for themselves.

798
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,838
You wouldn't understand that, being
I'm the one that's doing all the work.

799
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,228
Oh, and I don't work?

800
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,789
I guess I just stay at home
and sit on my behind...

801
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,712
...and raise your kids.
- I'm sorry.

802
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,997
But I'm just under so much pressure
these days, Lisa.

803
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,630
I realise I'm not as sensitive as
you need me to be, but we're partners.

804
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,268
Okay? Now, I need you
to get your family...

805
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,237
...to sell the dry-cleaning business...

806
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,359
...and then we'll have the capital
to get our life to the next level.

807
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,918
Do you really mean that?
We're partners?

808
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,078
Baby. Baby, come here.

809
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,391
Now, you know we're soul mates.

810
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,993
All right?

811
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,749
Everything I do,
I do for you and the kids.

812
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,353
All right?

813
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,637
Drive carefully. Here are the keys.

814
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,439
Oh, and make sure you put it
in the carport, all right?

815
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,238
Just in case it rains.

816
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,553
I'll call you!

817
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,832
Yeah?

818
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,196
"I love you"?

819
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,711
Back up, back up, back up.
Okay.

820
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,555
Claude!

821
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,117
Come help us.

822
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,708
Let a Marine get in here,
show you how it's done.

823
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,711
- Turn it.
- We're going the wrong way.

824
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,711
Yeah, frontways is the best.

825
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,677
There you go, in the back.

826
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,353
Ma'Dere, we have the tree!

827
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,078
Cocktail, anyone?

828
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,118
This one's from Bernice. Remember?
I thought Bernice was dead.

829
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,077
Oh, I'm telling her
next time I see her.

830
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,198
Oh, my God, Sam done put
all 15 of his kids on the card.

831
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,555
- Yes.
- His little boy grew up.

832
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,154
- Look, look, look.
- Nice.

833
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,959
Yeah, hey. Oh, no.

834
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,872
<i>We had the family photo...</i>

835
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,508
<i>... and pick ed up a Christmas tree</i>
<i>and decorated that.</i>

836
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,035
And my cousin Fred came by.

837
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,792
Oh, okay.
Oh, honey, take these.

838
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,791
Wait a minute, I'll be right back.

839
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,157
- Oh, my goodness.
- Check that out.

840
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,038
That's you?

841
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,988
There's a lot going on. Yeah, and...

842
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,348
<i>Claude.</i>

843
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,871
<i>- Claude, you there?</i>
- Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

844
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,274
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.

845
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,192
That's not a nothing look.

846
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,754
Christmas card from Senior.

847
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,831
Oh, where is he now?

848
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,878
- London.
- That's a good place for him.

849
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,758
Rosie.

850
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,752
You need to be honest with the kids.

851
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,751
Tell them about the divorce
and move on.

852
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,353
Now is not the time, Rosie.

853
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,670
I haven't seen Quentin in four years.

854
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,274
I am not doing anything
to upset him.

855
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,271
It's never a good time for you.

856
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,238
Rosie, where are the grapes?

857
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,389
In the freezer.

858
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:23,189
Good, the kids love
those frozen grapes.

859
00:57:24,189 --> 00:57:34,189
