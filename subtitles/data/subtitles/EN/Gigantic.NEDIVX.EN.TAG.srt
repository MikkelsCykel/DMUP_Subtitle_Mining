3
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,619
They stopped.

4
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:09,458
Which one?

5
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:10,821
Seven.

6
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,517
Start the stopwatch.

7
00:01:15,063 --> 00:01:16,707
- Is he okay?
- Yes, fine.

8
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:19,790
Stop.

9
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,915
What does that mean?

10
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,211
Nothing...

11
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:26,826
There...

12
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:33,530
The logic is, when forced
into an aversive situation

13
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:35,556
i.e. being dumped into a pool...

14
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:39,179
the rat will oscillate between attempts
to escape and resigning to its fate.

15
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:42,102
- And this guy gave up?
- Today he did.

16
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:44,484
Does he usually?

17
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:45,891
Yeah.

18
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,794
I'm trying to quantify
how helpless this one feels

19
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,611
and why more today than yesterday.

20
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:56,519
But it seems Mr. 7 is always
a little bit of a quitter.

21
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:06,041
- Could you sign this for me, Larry?
- Sure.

22
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,980
- Thank you.
- This is my friend Brian Weathersby

23
00:02:10,254 --> 00:02:12,655
Hi Brian, nice to meet you.

24
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:14,506
- Do you work here?
- No.

25
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:16,427
We went to college together.

26
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:17,847
Really?

27
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,476
- He looks so much older than you.
- Thanks so much.

28
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:24,127
This is a PhD candidate
in neurobiology.

29
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:26,494
She's studying aggression
and sexual behaviour

30
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:29,858
- in Mongolian gerbils.
- I just play with gerbil dick all day.

31
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,193
Really?

32
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:33,901
No...

33
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,405
just... their brains.

34
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:40,410
- I'm sorry, that was really weird.
- Little bit.

35
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:41,647
I'm gonna go.

36
00:02:41,772 --> 00:02:43,075
It was nice to meet you.

37
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,047
I'm sorry again.

38
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:51,694
If she had any idea how many times a day
I masturbated thinking about her.

39
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:54,266
She'd probably sue the university.

40
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,597
- She'd be right, it's inappropriate.
- Yeah.

41
00:02:58,529 --> 00:02:59,327
So...

42
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:02,697
why do some swim and others not?

43
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:07,646
It's hard to say... I mean nobody knows
to what degree the rat feels helpless.

44
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,417
What we do know is that the drugs
we administer to make the rats

45
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:13,972
wanna swim more are the same drugs
that make people,

46
00:03:14,288 --> 00:03:16,379
- feel less depressed.
- Antidepressants?

47
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:17,907
Antidepressants.

48
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:22,327
Do you know women are 20 times
more likely to be depressed than men?

49
00:03:23,677 --> 00:03:24,583
Maybe more.

50
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,457
Can't remember the exact number.
It's a lot more.

51
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:29,932
That's good...

52
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:31,962
for men.

53
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:36,638
Not really... when you think
about it heterosexually.

54
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:40,430
Right.

55
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:30,747
Enough, enough...

56
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:32,729
stop, stop, stop!

57
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:09,622
Shit, what happened to you?

58
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:11,948
Pickup game, caught an elbow.

59
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:13,387
Black dude? White dude?

60
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:14,785
Definitely white.

61
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,618
Hey Kevin, lunch.

62
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:22,587
Hey look, got some mini burgers
a whole bunch if you want some.

63
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:25,773
- Wassup dude not much.
- Hey Kevin

64
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,245
- Want some?
- No, I'm good.

65
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:31,581
How did you make out
with the Wall Street guy?

66
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:33,810
I think I sold him 5 beds.

67
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:36,646
5 beds?
Why does he need 5 beds for?

68
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,319
He's got 5 bedrooms.

69
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:39,987
Smart.

70
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,661
Came in looking for some beds
for his new mansion.

71
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:45,975
I asked him
how his bonus season went.

72
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,406
Yeah, and...?

73
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:49,826
He cackled, squealed like a pig.

74
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:51,882
Fucking guy's 28.

75
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:54,160
What's bonus season?

76
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,283
Every year banks give out bonuses,
big bonuses a couple of mil.

77
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:02,682
I'm in the wrong industry.

78
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,298
I got him up on that Scona, made him
take off his shoes, got him a cup of tea.

79
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:13,386
He laid there
for a couple of minutes.

80
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:15,383
I asked him some questions
about his job,

81
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:18,605
reported bout his success
and bang... 5 beds.

82
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:22,942
You could sell salt to a slug...
if you listen to the slug.

83
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,807
This place depresses me.
Don't like the idea.

84
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:29,088
Stores?

85
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:31,743
- Let me get you somebody to talk to.
- Christ.

86
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,026
They'll help,
they know what they're talkin about.

87
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:36,217
I don't have all day for speeches
I want a bed.

88
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:37,185
Hold on.

89
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,389
- Hi, can I help you?
- Yes, my boss is looking for a bed.

90
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,634
- Okay...
- And he doesn't have a ton of time.

91
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:52,640
This bed feels like it's full
of cookie dough.

92
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,336
That's a horsehair-covered bed.

93
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:56,841
It's a shit-covered bed
that's what it is.

94
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,251
What's this?

95
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:02,180
That's the Lady Englander Americanus
Series 400.

96
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:05,283
A salesman with a shiner.
I'm gonna believe him.

97
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:11,661
- Better feels like a plank though.
- Here's some literature.

98
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:14,229
I didn't just fall
off the turnip truck, son.

99
00:08:15,974 --> 00:08:18,282
Tell you what,
if you have any specific questions,

100
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:20,387
I'm happy to help,
I'll be right over here.

101
00:08:20,512 --> 00:08:23,485
No, you're on this ride with me
and the poofter here.

102
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,225
I came here to buy a bed
and I don't have time to chase you down

103
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,023
your little videogame station.

104
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:32,481
And what you kids do all day. Playing
those tetris games pretending to work.

105
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:34,620
What's this?
A sarcophagus?

106
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:39,831
That's the Scona Sangar 770 series
3000 coil count.

107
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,723
Best bed on the market.

108
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:43,918
- Swedish.
- That was a joke.

109
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,189
Good one. Try it out, Gary.

110
00:08:50,174 --> 00:08:52,549
C'mon, not gonna touch you.

111
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,228
Don't have to be shy in front of me,
I know how you spend your weekends.

112
00:08:56,931 --> 00:09:00,959
Bunch of homos on Fire Island piling
on top of each other. It's disgusting.

113
00:09:01,286 --> 00:09:02,345
It's nice.

114
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:07,657
Bet you wish you had a some of these out
there. Get all your buddies together.

115
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:10,334
Have a disgusting orgy.

116
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:12,880
I bet you wish you could come.

117
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:14,608
Alright, get up.

118
00:09:18,422 --> 00:09:21,644
- What's the story on this thing?
- It's the last bed you'll ever buy.

119
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,522
- Only bed I ever bought, how much?
- $14,000.

120
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,693
American? It's a lot of money
for a goddamn bed.

121
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:30,786
Alright,

122
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:35,124
I'll send my girl by this afternoon
take a look, work out the financing.

123
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,372
14 grand is the price you quoted me
not a penny more

124
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:41,289
so don't try to Jew the price up on me.
You're not Jewish, are you?

125
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,862
- No, I'm not.
- Good.

126
00:09:42,987 --> 00:09:45,287
It's just a figure of speech,
I'm half Jew myself

127
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:48,171
I work with Jews, they Jew me
all day long so I can say it.

128
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,800
- There's shipping and handling
- No. 14 grand, work it out Chester.

129
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,778
Let's go Gary,
this place depresses me.

130
00:09:58,102 --> 00:10:01,073
You going where and for what now?
And when you leaving?

131
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:04,934
- Vancouver, right?
- Vermont. That was close.

132
00:10:05,664 --> 00:10:08,368
My father's 80th birthday.

133
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:10,277
80th? Damn.

134
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:12,049
Your brother's going?

135
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:10,183
Hi.

136
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:13,240
- Can i help you?
- Yeah.

137
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,838
My dad... he came in here earlier

138
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:22,683
and talked to someone about a bed.

139
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:28,980
He came in here with another guy.

140
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:33,693
- Big guy?
- No, gay.

141
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,470
I meant your dad?

142
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,615
Oh yeah,
kind of sort of uh loud mouth.

143
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,080
Yeah, the Scona bed you wanna see?

144
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,630
Yeah...

145
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:58,176
This way.

146
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,595
That's a great bed.

147
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:03,931
Made in Sweden.

148
00:12:07,237 --> 00:12:08,494
May I sit on it?

149
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:10,113
Sure.

150
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:13,691
This is a nice bed!

151
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:16,986
- How much is it?
- $14,000.

152
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:18,668
Holy shit!

153
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:21,927
Is this the one he wants?

154
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:25,564
Fuck it, money gotta spin man.

155
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:30,232
Thank you.

156
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,123
Can I lie here for awhile?

157
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:37,006
Sure.

158
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:39,274
Thanks.

159
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:48,831
Can you see up my skirt?

160
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,428
Not really.

161
00:12:57,606 --> 00:12:58,414
Great.

162
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:02,882
What happened to your eye?

163
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:07,118
I was attacked by a homeless man.

164
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:19,506
I'm gonna get you a receipt,

165
00:13:19,955 --> 00:13:20,790
there's...

166
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,844
a warranty package built
into the price,

167
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,992
it's a pretty standard
25 year non-prorated deal.

168
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:30,469
And... for delivery...

169
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:35,153
I guess I'll waive the fee
because I told your dad or...

170
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:37,406
or really he told me.

171
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:13,538
<i>Family Initiative.</i>

172
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:16,478
Kenyatta Folds, please.

173
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:18,236
<i>I'm sorry, can you repeat the name?</i>

174
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:22,664
Can you please connect me to
Kenyatta Folds this is Brian Weathersby.

175
00:14:26,004 --> 00:14:28,701
- This is Kenyatta
- Hey Kenyatta, it's Brian.

176
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,735
Oh hey, wassup man?

177
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,331
What's the name
of those beds you make?

178
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:37,209
We don't make them
but they're called Scona beds.

179
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,403
<i>I looked them up,
that shit's expensive.</i>

180
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:42,882
Yes, but truly excellent
sleeping devices.

181
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:44,947
Better be for that kinda money.

182
00:14:45,522 --> 00:14:46,833
Wassup big boy?

183
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,936
Nothing, it's Friday,
so I thought I'd call.

184
00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:53,990
<i>I got no news man,
they met on Wednesday but...</i>

185
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:56,479
nothing's changed.

186
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,941
What about the application and
references did that make it any further?

187
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:04,124
No.

188
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:07,950
OK, I'm still interested
in the main adoption list

189
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:12,469
but can you keep me on the email list
and for alternative list as well?

190
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,729
- All 3 lists?
- <i>You know it, man</i>.

191
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:15,785
Thanks.

192
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,168
<i>Be safe.</i>

193
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:19,642
- Will do, bye.
- Bye.

194
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:28,165
Who is that girl?

195
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:33,175
That guy, the big guy
who came in earlier.

196
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,652
His daughter.

197
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:36,452
He buy that bed?

198
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:41,599
You see that's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.

199
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:45,919
- So what's up with them Chinese people.
- Still no word.

200
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:51,243
I'll see you tomorrow.
Tell your papa I said Happy 80th.

201
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,232
I will.

202
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:56,264
How old was he when he had you?

203
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:57,542
52.

204
00:15:58,464 --> 00:15:59,279
Damn.

205
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,620
Still shooting bullets at 52.

206
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,302
- I'm out.
- OK.

207
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:35,920
I fell asleep on your bed.

208
00:16:37,393 --> 00:16:38,870
How long was I asleep?

209
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,011
2 and a half hours.

210
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:48,268
You must've been tired.

211
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:56,352
I've got your receipt here
and all the paperwork for the bed,

212
00:16:56,477 --> 00:16:58,811
you just need to tell me
when to deliver it.

213
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,190
Wait a minute...

214
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:02,776
I had this fucked up dream...

215
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:07,192
I was in a cave and my hair
was made out of marijuana and then...

216
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,308
my swim coach

217
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:11,058
was...

218
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,461
And then...

219
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,553
we went to...

220
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:19,330
are you adopting a dog?

221
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,495
You were in my dream.

222
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,767
Do you ever incorporate things
into your dreams?

223
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:30,713
I was out of it.

224
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:32,879
What were we talking about?

225
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:36,681
Delivery, when do you want it?

226
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,282
You were on the phone.
You talking bout somethin'.

227
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:43,706
What were you talking?

228
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:47,566
In the process of adopting
a baby from China.

229
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:51,012
- Did you give me this?
- Yes.

230
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,200
- That's amazing.
- It was right there on the bed.

231
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,474
I meant the baby.

232
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:01,414
I don't have the baby yet.

233
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:07,943
Yeah, you've to go through
a shit ton of tests and...

234
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:11,132
interviews
and there are a few categories where

235
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,634
I'm not an ideal candidate.

236
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:18,486
- Do you mind me asking why?
- Not at all, I'm not married and 28.

237
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:21,106
- What would they rather have?
- Married and 30.

238
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,009
Are you gonna raise this kid?

239
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:28,110
That's the idea,
yeah if I ever get one.

240
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:31,444
So, how long have you wanted
to do that?

241
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:34,527
Pretty much my whole life.

242
00:18:38,313 --> 00:18:40,363
So it's been a weird obsession.

243
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:42,580
Sorry I keep asking questions.

244
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:46,250
No, it's OK, it's a little weird.

245
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:50,254
So do you actually deliver it?

246
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:54,178
The bed?

247
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,630
The guys do it.

248
00:18:56,755 --> 00:18:58,155
The delivery guys.

249
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:00,689
Well,

250
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:02,285
I guess...

251
00:19:03,027 --> 00:19:06,187
I'll just come in tomorrow and...

252
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:09,572
see...

253
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:12,401
what my dad wants.

254
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,821
Yeah sure.

255
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:16,822
You just have to sign here

256
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:18,584
and you're good.

257
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,082
I am...

258
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:22,708
Brian, by the way.

259
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,834
I'm Happy.

260
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:27,187
Me, my name's Harriet,
but everybody calls me Happy.

261
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:28,945
It's a nice name.

262
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:30,276
Which one?

263
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:31,402
Harriet.

264
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:32,455
I like it.

265
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,528
Me too.

266
00:19:34,804 --> 00:19:36,250
Near grand'ma.

267
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:47,097
- Yes, so...
- Shit.

268
00:19:47,622 --> 00:19:49,272
I'll talk to you tomorrow?

269
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,401
I'm late for work.

270
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,856
You going to work now?

271
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:55,431
Yeah, I'm a hooker.

272
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,990
I thought so.

273
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,066
I work for my sister.

274
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,169
Sort of.

275
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,396
I gotta go.

276
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:08,014
Yes, good luck.

277
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,585
Thanks for letting me sleep here.

278
00:20:12,615 --> 00:20:13,565
Sure.

279
00:20:15,856 --> 00:20:16,857
Anytime...

280
00:20:26,803 --> 00:20:28,435
Yeah, that's looking good.

281
00:20:29,723 --> 00:20:30,668
Is it?

282
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:31,794
Hell yeah.

283
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:34,400
Black hair ain't easy to deal
with you know.

284
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:38,235
Had a white stepfather had to deal
with my sister's Afro coiffures.

285
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:41,866
She looked like a dog
when he finished with 'em.

286
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:46,208
White people just don't know
how difficult black hair's to deal with.

287
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:50,105
What's up dude not much?

288
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:53,755
You know Kevin.

289
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,462
That's two separate things.

290
00:20:56,782 --> 00:20:58,883
"What's up dude" is the question.

291
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:01,599
"Not much" is the answer
to that question.

292
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,391
Listen dudes, I need someone
to help me with that Scona delivery.

293
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:11,055
For that guy with the fag friend.

294
00:21:12,886 --> 00:21:14,486
I'm sorry, homosexual.

295
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:16,853
Where's Plume?

296
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:20,749
Well he called in sick dude.
He's like ate some bad chicken.

297
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:23,693
Parts and he's like
honking his guts out.

298
00:21:24,704 --> 00:21:26,363
Well get on Kumalo.

299
00:21:26,488 --> 00:21:27,828
Not today dude. Religion.

300
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,612
- I'll do it.
- Sweet.

301
00:21:29,737 --> 00:21:32,209
- I'll call in a temp.
- No, I don't mind.

302
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:34,820
Route 212, 93.

303
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:38,339
Right here.

304
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:42,436
Sweet.

305
00:22:05,197 --> 00:22:06,198
Happy!

306
00:22:06,944 --> 00:22:07,845
What?

307
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:09,118
The door!

308
00:22:11,158 --> 00:22:12,060
Got it.

309
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:21,828
Yeah?

310
00:22:21,953 --> 00:22:23,596
Sandman mattress.

311
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,521
It's the delivery.

312
00:22:27,317 --> 00:22:28,318
Thanks.

313
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:31,568
Put some clothes on for God's sake.

314
00:22:48,861 --> 00:22:49,862
Hello?

315
00:22:52,232 --> 00:22:54,232
We're delivering the mattress.

316
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,630
I'm lying on the kitchen floor.

317
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,669
Now that we both know
what we're doing, what's next?

318
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,930
Where can we set this up?

319
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,617
How about the bedroom area?

320
00:23:14,946 --> 00:23:17,152
Where is that, sir?

321
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:28,215
The delivery guy got sick.

322
00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:30,993
Come on, I'll show you.

323
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:43,504
What's up dude not much?

324
00:23:48,431 --> 00:23:50,262
- Kevin!
- Coming.

325
00:23:53,887 --> 00:23:55,059
So just,

326
00:23:55,765 --> 00:23:57,286
right there.

327
00:24:00,985 --> 00:24:01,905
Happy?

328
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,069
Happy?

329
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,585
What? I'm coming.

330
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,243
I'm going to the back doctor today.

331
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,530
I need you to drive me.

332
00:24:21,046 --> 00:24:21,999
No way.

333
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,499
I'll give you $1000.

334
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,207
Dad, I can't.

335
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:29,456
Get that kid to do it.

336
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:30,631
Who? Brian?

337
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:35,281
We can't just ask him
to do stuffs like that, that's weird.

338
00:24:44,013 --> 00:24:46,313
I've kinda a weird question for you.

339
00:24:46,438 --> 00:24:47,506
What is it?

340
00:24:48,924 --> 00:24:51,433
Will you drive my dad
to the back specialist?

341
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,640
I can't drive in New York City.

342
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:00,849
A cab?

343
00:25:01,177 --> 00:25:02,877
He doesn't ride in cabs.

344
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,581
He'll pay you

345
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:11,769
and I will come with you
so it won't get too weird.

346
00:25:14,323 --> 00:25:17,462
I really appreciate you doing this,
taking time off from work and all.

347
00:25:17,587 --> 00:25:18,470
Well.

348
00:25:19,015 --> 00:25:20,615
Where the hell is she?

349
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:26,294
I'm totally serious when I say she may
have gotten lost leaving the apartment.

350
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:34,727
Somebody got all glossied up.

351
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:37,002
Good.

352
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,831
You play tennis?

353
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:45,016
I've played, not much.

354
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:47,581
I have the 9th fastest serve
in the world.

355
00:25:47,706 --> 00:25:48,805
They clocked it.

356
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,048
Verified.

357
00:25:52,946 --> 00:25:55,478
- The doctor will meet you in Room 1.
- Fabulous.

358
00:25:55,603 --> 00:25:57,622
- Will be about an hour.
- Come on in now.

359
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:29,817
Thanks.

360
00:26:34,352 --> 00:26:37,128
Structurally,
there are no abnormalities.

361
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:39,129
Has to do with musculature
and ligaments.

362
00:26:39,254 --> 00:26:41,813
This has to be the last time
we talk about this.

363
00:26:41,938 --> 00:26:43,540
What about ruptured discs?

364
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:47,731
That is bullshit.
All that shit is fucking bullshit.

365
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:50,983
Back disorders, duodenal ulcers,
the most misdiagnosed conditions

366
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:53,935
attributed to middle-aged men today.
I'm not going down that road.

367
00:26:54,761 --> 00:26:56,197
Stress, Al.

368
00:26:57,043 --> 00:26:57,960
Tension.

369
00:26:58,085 --> 00:27:00,601
Weariness,
that's what causes most of this shit.

370
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:02,625
Let me show you something.

371
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,820
A little pressure.

372
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:13,088
- Look at that energy pattern.
- You look at it.

373
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:15,759
I'll go along with it
but I'm not fucking stressed.

374
00:27:17,424 --> 00:27:18,673
What are you reading?

375
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:24,643
It's an article about a Tibetan
who plays basketball

376
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,658
with some other Monks in Arizona.

377
00:27:27,654 --> 00:27:30,190
Says they got in a fight with five

378
00:27:30,603 --> 00:27:34,490
advertising executives in front
of a bunch of kids.

379
00:27:37,095 --> 00:27:38,340
What do you reading?

380
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:43,151
Mostly just ads.

381
00:27:45,157 --> 00:27:46,417
This one's for...

382
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:48,476
a meditation cushion.

383
00:27:50,283 --> 00:27:51,945
That's filled with buckwheat.

384
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:55,063
And it costs $249.

385
00:27:57,424 --> 00:27:58,598
It's a cushion?

386
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:04,354
It's mostly just a pillow that...

387
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:06,955
looks like a stump.

388
00:28:08,302 --> 00:28:09,438
Seems like a lot.

389
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:24,185
Do you have any interest
in having sex with me?

390
00:28:28,546 --> 00:28:29,333
Yeah.

391
00:28:29,786 --> 00:28:30,612
Really?

392
00:28:34,537 --> 00:28:35,410
Now?

393
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,125
I need to schedule
another appointment.

394
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:15,379
- How was your visit, Mr. Lolly?
- A waste of money.

395
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,552
How about Thursday the 23rd?

396
00:29:17,677 --> 00:29:18,882
The 24th?

397
00:29:19,813 --> 00:29:20,757
9:30?

398
00:29:21,838 --> 00:29:22,636
2:30?

399
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,522
Smells like a wharf nut in here.

400
00:29:33,861 --> 00:29:34,744
What?

401
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:37,651
Smells like low tide.

402
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:41,861
- That's weird.
- I don't smell anything.

403
00:29:43,603 --> 00:29:45,021
How was the doctor, dad?

404
00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:46,561
Good enough quack.

405
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:49,500
Charged a fortune
but I've got his number.

406
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:54,383
Did you know I had brain cancer once?

407
00:29:58,337 --> 00:30:00,507
Huge tumour on the recesses
in my temporal lobe.

408
00:30:02,871 --> 00:30:04,111
But you're OK now.

409
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,380
100% holistic.

410
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:08,155
No chemo, no radiation.

411
00:30:09,952 --> 00:30:10,976
What did you do?

412
00:30:11,589 --> 00:30:14,522
I mapped the pathology of the cancer
with my mind.

413
00:30:15,364 --> 00:30:16,514
Very Chinese.

414
00:30:19,214 --> 00:30:20,514
Then I moved it.

415
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,385
Again with meditation.

416
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,514
I pushed it down to the fatty tissue
of my temporal lobe...

417
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:27,492
2 months.

418
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,059
Then I moved it down
to my nasal cavity stream. 3 months.

419
00:30:34,285 --> 00:30:35,959
Then one day I just hocked it out.

420
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,933
About the size of a squash ball,
maybe bigger.

421
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:45,527
Do you play squash, Brian?

422
00:30:45,652 --> 00:30:47,135
I've played some squash.

423
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,700
I was the n°2 at Yale.

424
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:50,785
Behind some Paki named Nasser.

425
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,707
Dad.

426
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,187
Pakistani.

427
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:57,147
The guy was a wire.

428
00:31:15,862 --> 00:31:18,512
- It's Missy.
- Right, gerbil cock, right?

429
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:23,751
She wants you.

430
00:31:23,876 --> 00:31:24,769
Stop it.

431
00:31:26,571 --> 00:31:28,074
What's up in the rat world?

432
00:31:29,506 --> 00:31:33,534
Depression,
sleep deprivation, test, the usual.

433
00:31:34,975 --> 00:31:36,186
What the fuck is that?

434
00:31:38,067 --> 00:31:39,767
This, is a sports drink.

435
00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:41,878
I'm hungover.

436
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,952
- How you doin' man?
- Well...

437
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,637
I got a problem.

438
00:31:48,886 --> 00:31:49,987
What's going on?

439
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,808
I had sex with this girl

440
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:56,957
in the back of her father'station wagon
the other day.

441
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,844
Is it a sting
when you pee kinda problem?

442
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:04,755
Expound.

443
00:32:07,322 --> 00:32:08,261
Now what?

444
00:32:11,252 --> 00:32:14,050
Well now there are 2 possible reactions
to this scenario.

445
00:32:14,764 --> 00:32:16,479
You either wanna bang it home again

446
00:32:16,604 --> 00:32:18,812
or you never see her
for the rest of your life.

447
00:32:19,297 --> 00:32:20,322
Which is it?

448
00:32:24,592 --> 00:32:25,665
Bang it home?

449
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:28,853
Why are you saying it
like it's a question?

450
00:32:30,906 --> 00:32:31,908
Bang it home.

451
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:36,196
There you go.
Damn straight bang it home.

452
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:37,932
Good job.

453
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:40,218
Who is this girl?

454
00:32:40,343 --> 00:32:44,149
She came into the store the other day,
and her dad bought a bed.

455
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,637
God bless capitalism.

456
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,587
So when's the next bang-bang
gonna happen?

457
00:32:49,712 --> 00:32:50,807
I don't know.

458
00:32:51,225 --> 00:32:52,550
You like her?

459
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:55,438
- You like her <i>like her?</i>
- I don't know.

460
00:32:57,185 --> 00:33:01,116
You think it's possible that the rat
that stopped swimming was just tired

461
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:02,736
and taking a little break?

462
00:33:03,172 --> 00:33:04,283
Unlikely.

463
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:07,614
These calculations are based
on months of testing, so...

464
00:33:08,383 --> 00:33:12,388
The rat that stopped swimming again and
again is probably more than just tired.

465
00:33:13,822 --> 00:33:15,285
How's the mattress business?

466
00:33:17,337 --> 00:33:18,674
I should get there.

467
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:21,199
Hey you...

468
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:23,203
should ask Missy out.

469
00:33:23,774 --> 00:33:24,669
Can't.

470
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:25,784
Scared.

471
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:26,808
Good luck.

472
00:33:28,163 --> 00:33:29,097
You too.

473
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,972
You gotta swim
if you wanna bang it home.

474
00:33:33,724 --> 00:33:35,619
That's reality.
Remember that.

475
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:37,843
I will.

476
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:53,637
- What's our first meal?
- Nothing.

477
00:33:53,762 --> 00:33:55,402
Come on.
I'm starving.

478
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:58,228
- It's better on an empty stomach.
- It's true.

479
00:33:58,353 --> 00:33:59,554
Crock. It's not.

480
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,544
I'm hungry, I'm gonna grab something
to eat. Brian you want something?

481
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:03,887
No, I'm alright.

482
00:34:04,012 --> 00:34:05,668
Excuse me, shaman.

483
00:34:11,587 --> 00:34:12,883
Dad, you need some help?

484
00:34:13,008 --> 00:34:14,740
Nope, I've got it.

485
00:34:14,865 --> 00:34:16,322
When are the shrooms ready?

486
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:19,472
Oh no...
best to let it steep a while.

487
00:34:21,774 --> 00:34:25,095
Talked to a local, he said there were
a lot, ahead of the woods and...

488
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:29,719
black trumpets south side of Temper
lower elevations than last year.

489
00:34:30,815 --> 00:34:31,917
You bringing that?

490
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,755
Might be some pheasant.

491
00:34:34,361 --> 00:34:36,145
A pheasant with a death wish?

492
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:38,023
That's tradition.

493
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:39,863
He brings a gun.

494
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:41,788
He doesn't use the gun.

495
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,665
He throws up.

496
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,250
Thanks dad.

497
00:34:46,346 --> 00:34:47,768
Sometimes...

498
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:49,782
it takes mushrooms...

499
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,526
to find mushrooms.

500
00:34:53,948 --> 00:34:56,582
Prepare your pouches
for the poisoning.

501
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:23,445
My hand is starting to look a bit
like an eagle's claw.

502
00:35:26,546 --> 00:35:29,444
So I think it's time
to pack our stuffs.

503
00:36:40,137 --> 00:36:41,752
Any news from China?

504
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:43,932
Not really.

505
00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:46,023
Same stuff, I'm on the list...

506
00:36:47,235 --> 00:36:49,953
A couple of years...
could be earlier.

507
00:36:51,929 --> 00:36:54,494
Listen, my friend Jin Ho,

508
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,156
very powerful businessman,

509
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,259
right here in the States.

510
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,897
He owns an airline company,
tobacco interests...

511
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:04,555
some crap like that.

512
00:37:07,822 --> 00:37:09,269
He might be able to help you.

513
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:12,772
Well, I think he's Korean, dad
if that's what you mean.

514
00:37:15,355 --> 00:37:17,180
Yes, yes...

515
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,898
He's a marvelous Korean!!

516
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:23,424
Of no help to you.

517
00:37:25,623 --> 00:37:26,933
I hope it happens.

518
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:31,355
Be nice to have some
new life in this family.

519
00:37:31,953 --> 00:37:33,382
Hope you get the kid.

520
00:37:33,814 --> 00:37:35,375
I think you'd be great at it.

521
00:37:36,475 --> 00:37:38,608
- You think so?
- I do, I do....

522
00:37:39,498 --> 00:37:40,808
You got what it takes.

523
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:42,802
What does it take?

524
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:52,152
I haven't the foggiest idea,
to be truthful...

525
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:53,779
but...

526
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:54,772
listen...

527
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,981
Here we are, walking together
in the woods.

528
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:03,150
And if you can aspire...

529
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:09,025
to... be walking in the woods
with your kids.

530
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:12,091
After they've made it as far
as we've made it...

531
00:38:13,153 --> 00:38:13,976
then...

532
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:16,836
I think you've done the right thing.

533
00:38:18,246 --> 00:38:19,612
That makes sense.

534
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:21,351
It makes sense.

535
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:23,974
Not really.

536
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:26,548
But...

537
00:38:28,624 --> 00:38:31,370
I think you understand me...

538
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:32,956
I do.

539
00:38:35,852 --> 00:38:37,798
- Dad!
- What the fuck?!

540
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:38,727
Dad...

541
00:38:39,093 --> 00:38:40,874
Where the fuck did it come from?

542
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:42,486
Are you alright?

543
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,352
Yeah yeah, I'm the war generation.

544
00:38:45,477 --> 00:38:49,013
When we hear shots we get down. You guys
are running around like targets.

545
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,361
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah yeah I'm fine.

546
00:38:51,486 --> 00:38:53,103
Looks like a tiny calibre bullet.

547
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:54,774
Looks like a 22.

548
00:38:55,206 --> 00:38:58,105
Some hunter probably shot one
across our bow.

549
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,873
- Yeah, what's he hunting? Squirrel?
- He has a point.

550
00:39:01,456 --> 00:39:03,466
There shouldn't be anyone
hunting right now.

551
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:06,931
There's 2 ways we can go here
we can hunt the fucker down... sorry...

552
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:08,616
Or we can make our way back.

553
00:39:08,922 --> 00:39:09,813
Oysters.

554
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:13,810
Check them golden oysters!

555
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:16,748
Look at those beauties.

556
00:39:17,131 --> 00:39:20,483
- What we gonna do about the long gun?
- Nothing, nothing.

557
00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:24,821
We got our mushrooms,
go back to our cabins and call it a day.

558
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:30,535
Then later, I'll take our bounty
after hours, head back into town

559
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,442
and have them cook us a proper meal.

560
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:41,539
Bonjour mes amis.

561
00:39:53,252 --> 00:39:54,558
You need any help?

562
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:03,668
Brian, tu viens me donner
un coup de main.

563
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,167
I'd love to help.

564
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:07,558
What's he saying?

565
00:40:07,683 --> 00:40:09,294
I'm gonna help Jacques

566
00:40:09,419 --> 00:40:13,032
with the dinner and he
thinks dad's a murderer in the kitchen.

567
00:40:13,157 --> 00:40:15,194
What, everybody speaks French but me?

568
00:40:28,732 --> 00:40:30,516
Jacques, can we speak in English?

569
00:40:30,892 --> 00:40:34,028
<i>Evidemment</i>,
I get carried away sometimes.

570
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,818
Whatever that boy wants,
he'll figure it out at some point.

571
00:40:38,773 --> 00:40:41,351
And you've got 15 years
on both of ya.

572
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:46,590
You forget what you were like
when you were his age?

573
00:40:46,715 --> 00:40:48,988
I was finishing my residency
when I was his age.

574
00:40:49,154 --> 00:40:51,545
Yeah, I was in Russia
buying oil tankers.

575
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:54,727
You look good.
Very strong.

576
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,766
Stronger than I've ever seen you.

577
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:59,832
And I've seen you
since you were a little...

578
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:01,308
"pizza".

579
00:41:03,168 --> 00:41:05,440
You mean piss-ant?

580
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,716
<i>Oui c'est ça, c'est ça</i>.

581
00:41:09,278 --> 00:41:10,968
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

582
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:17,480
Well, that's for you Jacques, thanks for
the hospitality and for the Frenchness.

583
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:21,580
Thank you for the <i>champignon</i>
and for being an absurd American.

584
00:41:22,755 --> 00:41:24,309
So, how will you get home?

585
00:41:24,434 --> 00:41:25,817
- Brian.
- I've got it.

586
00:41:26,134 --> 00:41:28,503
- Are you okay to drive?
- He doesn't drink.

587
00:41:28,628 --> 00:41:32,059
No. I just don't drink 3 bottles
of wine on my own.

588
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:40,957
Jacques, you fabulous Frenchman!

589
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:43,077
Thank you for suffering us.

590
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:46,846
Been my pleasure.
And don't forget to come back soon.

591
00:41:48,045 --> 00:41:49,998
<i>Merci</i> monsieur,
I don't kiss like that.

592
00:41:51,549 --> 00:41:53,535
- You crazy Americans.
- No kidding.

593
00:41:58,811 --> 00:42:00,010
That means wait.

594
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:01,620
Thanks dad.

595
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:06,858
You put them in the pot,
you boil them and you make a bisque.

596
00:42:09,103 --> 00:42:10,301
Watch your step.

597
00:42:14,856 --> 00:42:17,699
Lobsters, lobsters, lobsters...

598
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,191
Motherfucker!

599
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:31,639
Jailbreak?

600
00:43:34,421 --> 00:43:37,243
<i>Is this a rueful act or a mistake?</i>

601
00:43:37,368 --> 00:43:39,578
<i>Are you trying to free these things?</i>

602
00:43:40,522 --> 00:43:41,328
No!

603
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:46,127
I got a leg cramp.

604
00:43:47,154 --> 00:43:48,172
I see.

605
00:44:06,165 --> 00:44:07,586
What are you doing here?

606
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,639
- Does it matter.
- Why?

607
00:44:09,764 --> 00:44:13,274
I'm with my Japanese guys
doing business. Does my breath stink?

608
00:44:14,153 --> 00:44:15,588
- Yes.
- Damn.

609
00:44:16,325 --> 00:44:17,139
Listen...

610
00:44:17,264 --> 00:44:19,563
I was talking
to the big guy, Kanagae...

611
00:44:19,897 --> 00:44:22,296
and he's got a brother
who plays canasta

612
00:44:22,421 --> 00:44:24,952
with some Chinese diplomats.
Would that interest you?

613
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:27,205
What are you talking about?

614
00:44:27,756 --> 00:44:28,885
Come over here.

615
00:44:34,796 --> 00:44:38,301
- My ass is in love with this bed.
- This is the nicest one of the bunch.

616
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,333
Good.

617
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,409
Anyway...

618
00:44:42,336 --> 00:44:45,653
so I talked to this guy Kanagae,
and he claims...

619
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:48,342
You know these people?

620
00:44:49,029 --> 00:44:51,022
- Yeah, they're customers.
- They're good?

621
00:44:52,237 --> 00:44:53,227
They're cool.

622
00:44:55,614 --> 00:45:00,406
He thinks he can get a Chinese baby on
the black market for like 45 000 $.

623
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,784
- What?
- Chinese. Like you want.

624
00:45:04,804 --> 00:45:07,104
He's got these kind of connections.
He's an oil man.

625
00:45:08,718 --> 00:45:10,879
- Really?
- So what do you think?

626
00:45:12,132 --> 00:45:13,874
- The black market?
- Yeah.

627
00:45:14,871 --> 00:45:16,404
It sounds kinda shady.

628
00:45:16,919 --> 00:45:19,929
Does it?
Or does it sound awesome?!

629
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,512
Right.
It sounds like a bad idea.

630
00:45:25,843 --> 00:45:27,996
OK.
You know, it's...

631
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,806
My little contribution, but...

632
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,468
Parallel paths...

633
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,820
we pursue...

634
00:45:33,945 --> 00:45:37,359
That way that's not working right now
and I'll keep on going after my thing.

635
00:45:37,636 --> 00:45:39,267
We'll see who wins.

636
00:45:41,818 --> 00:45:43,813
You mind if I crash here
for a little bit?

637
00:45:43,938 --> 00:45:45,359
Knock yourself out.

638
00:45:46,884 --> 00:45:50,541
Gotta love this fucking bed.
You got laid recently didn't you?

639
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:52,464
And don't fucking lie to me either.

640
00:45:59,961 --> 00:46:02,107
I'm here to see Harriet Lolly?

641
00:46:02,232 --> 00:46:03,414
- Happy?
- Yes.

642
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:05,995
Have a seat on the couch,
make yourself comfortable.

643
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,699
There's coffee, Red Bull
and Cheezos around the corner.

644
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:12,415
- Just over there.
- Thank you.

645
00:46:15,261 --> 00:46:16,933
Uh, Happy, you have a visitor.

646
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:19,289
What's his name...

647
00:46:19,414 --> 00:46:22,321
- Dude... sir, what's your name?
- Brian Weathersby.

648
00:46:23,295 --> 00:46:24,898
Brian, you heard it.
OK.

649
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:29,124
- She'll be right out.
- Thank you.

650
00:46:29,249 --> 00:46:30,406
You're welcome.

651
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,892
- What are you doing here?
- You said to stop by.

652
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,320
Nobody honors that system.

653
00:47:04,506 --> 00:47:06,067
So old-fashioned.

654
00:47:06,192 --> 00:47:08,869
- Well, that's how I roll.
- That's great.

655
00:47:09,656 --> 00:47:12,480
- Are you really busy?I can come back...
- No... I'm not...

656
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:17,144
I barely have a job,
so do you wanna see this?

657
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:19,836
- Sure.
- It's really fascinating.

658
00:47:25,216 --> 00:47:30,049
We have to lay low because my sister's
on a warpath and she's a sniper...

659
00:47:31,819 --> 00:47:33,380
Oh, I'm sorry...
Hello.

660
00:47:44,645 --> 00:47:46,773
Why don't we do it like always?

661
00:47:47,434 --> 00:47:49,283
- Hey Hap.
- Hi Conner.

662
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,870
- This is my friend Brian.
- Hey dude.

663
00:47:53,618 --> 00:47:56,178
You look like her old boyfriend,
doesn't he?

664
00:47:57,059 --> 00:47:58,067
Totally.

665
00:47:58,493 --> 00:48:00,217
How do you guys know each other?

666
00:48:00,617 --> 00:48:02,786
Brian sold my father a mattress.

667
00:48:03,024 --> 00:48:04,702
You work in the mattress store?

668
00:48:05,297 --> 00:48:06,649
You get me a good deal?

669
00:48:06,774 --> 00:48:07,882
Probably not.

670
00:48:08,142 --> 00:48:09,701
Your shoulder's a little tight.

671
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:10,955
Yo Kim...

672
00:48:11,381 --> 00:48:12,348
Fuck!

673
00:48:14,279 --> 00:48:15,352
I gotta jack.

674
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:19,942
- Here's my sister.
- Hi.

675
00:48:20,863 --> 00:48:23,636
- I'm Melanie Lolly.
- Hi, Brian Weathersby.

676
00:48:26,476 --> 00:48:28,584
I look like a mannequin
in this thing.

677
00:48:28,709 --> 00:48:29,940
No, absolutely not.

678
00:48:30,065 --> 00:48:32,438
- Melanie sort of hosts the show.
- Congratulations.

679
00:48:32,563 --> 00:48:34,328
Please go to the monitor and check

680
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,539
and see If I look like
a massive wall of grey.

681
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,938
- I do?
- No, you don't...

682
00:48:39,063 --> 00:48:41,124
yes, I'll look at the monitor.

683
00:48:41,249 --> 00:48:42,252
Thank you.

684
00:48:45,224 --> 00:48:46,311
What is that?

685
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:48,870
Press the button.

686
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,811
We sold like,
800,000 of those things last year.

687
00:48:59,696 --> 00:49:00,813
That's a...

688
00:49:01,197 --> 00:49:05,901
combination rape whistle, pepper spray
mini brass knuckle key chain.

689
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:08,696
You laughed
when I used one of those once.

690
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,848
She peppered a drunk guy
in the valet line "he was really old".

691
00:49:11,973 --> 00:49:13,545
He was an old perv.

692
00:49:14,287 --> 00:49:16,453
- So do I look huge?
- No, shut up.

693
00:49:16,927 --> 00:49:18,732
- You shut up.
- You shut up.

694
00:49:20,054 --> 00:49:23,781
<i>I'm not saying that doesn't make sense,
I don't know what "smackdown" is.</i>

695
00:49:24,151 --> 00:49:26,625
Well, this has been interesting.

696
00:49:39,517 --> 00:49:41,471
So, do you want to do
something later?

697
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:44,235
Sure.

698
00:49:45,932 --> 00:49:50,016
I'm having dinner with my dad
if you wanna come?

699
00:49:53,254 --> 00:49:54,208
Please?

700
00:49:58,211 --> 00:50:00,241
Do I have to get dressed up?

701
00:50:00,929 --> 00:50:01,757
Kinda.

702
00:50:05,726 --> 00:50:07,735
I should check with work, though.

703
00:50:09,547 --> 00:50:10,870
Are you open at night?

704
00:50:12,701 --> 00:50:14,122
Right... what?

705
00:50:16,438 --> 00:50:17,913
It's called the Bobcat...

706
00:50:18,654 --> 00:50:20,440
It's on 62nd Street,

707
00:50:21,162 --> 00:50:22,110
7:30,

708
00:50:22,626 --> 00:50:24,065
it's kinda Frenchy.

709
00:50:25,118 --> 00:50:26,197
You've got...

710
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:29,401
2 hours and 45 minutes to get ready.

711
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,391
Sorry, I got a little lost.

712
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:02,462
City's laid out in a perfect grid, I can
see how that can happen, 62nd street...

713
00:51:03,252 --> 00:51:04,558
Hi, I'm Brian.

714
00:51:04,835 --> 00:51:05,861
Ducky.

715
00:51:05,986 --> 00:51:08,797
Brian, this is Ducky Settinstall.
Ducky, meet Brian.

716
00:51:09,245 --> 00:51:11,242
He's started sleeping
with my daughter.

717
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:12,722
- Albert.
- Dad.

718
00:51:14,269 --> 00:51:17,338
Am I incorrect?
Please tell me if I'm being incorrect.

719
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,189
Bobby...

720
00:51:20,405 --> 00:51:22,105
another bottle of Merlot please.

721
00:51:22,902 --> 00:51:24,634
Brian, am I correct?

722
00:51:25,784 --> 00:51:26,750
Well, no.

723
00:51:27,374 --> 00:51:30,875
It's just been
the one time in your car,

724
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,266
so if we do it again...

725
00:51:33,628 --> 00:51:35,884
then I think you could call it
sleeping together.

726
00:51:36,401 --> 00:51:37,402
Fantastic.

727
00:51:37,957 --> 00:51:40,734
And how's the adoption going?
Brian's in the middle of adopting

728
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:42,005
a kid from China.

729
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,023
- So you would like...
- I don't get it.

730
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:48,314
You've got fertile soil
right next to you here.

731
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:51,316
Are you not planning on sticking around,
or is it an ammunition issue?

732
00:51:51,482 --> 00:51:52,767
- Dad?
- Harriet.

733
00:51:54,457 --> 00:51:57,298
Why do you think you and Ducky
don't make a formal commitment?

734
00:51:57,676 --> 00:52:01,326
Is it because she works for you? You
think it might be a conflict of interest

735
00:52:01,492 --> 00:52:03,287
So you have a hotel relationship?

736
00:52:05,023 --> 00:52:06,791
I think I'll have the lamb...

737
00:52:07,135 --> 00:52:09,769
and a free salt salad...

738
00:52:10,687 --> 00:52:12,721
I think I'll have the clams.

739
00:52:14,921 --> 00:52:17,769
So... seriously, I'm just interested.

740
00:52:18,108 --> 00:52:20,345
Suppose this Chinese baby plan works

741
00:52:20,836 --> 00:52:24,287
and you get the kid,
what's the long term finance structure?

742
00:52:24,686 --> 00:52:27,498
Who's the mother?
Who provides the feminine support?

743
00:52:27,623 --> 00:52:29,736
What happens when the kid
gets her period?

744
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:32,082
I'm asking the tough questions.
Go!

745
00:52:33,472 --> 00:52:35,291
The long term finance structure?

746
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:38,054
I assume you make peanuts
at the mattress factory.

747
00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:40,366
How do you support a kid
on a meager salary?

748
00:52:42,594 --> 00:52:44,747
I guess we'll just eat less food.

749
00:52:45,447 --> 00:52:49,783
They don't eat a lot in China anyway,
and they're much healthier so...

750
00:52:50,082 --> 00:52:53,128
It'll be some cost-cutting measures
like that, less food,

751
00:52:53,701 --> 00:52:55,631
no heat, et cetera...

752
00:52:56,656 --> 00:52:59,369
You won't be laughing
when the tuition bills come in,

753
00:52:59,494 --> 00:53:02,860
and she wants a horsie
or he wants a Countach.

754
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:04,814
What's a Countach?

755
00:53:04,939 --> 00:53:06,449
It's a Lamborghini.

756
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:08,519
A car.

757
00:53:09,193 --> 00:53:13,273
It sounds totally preposterous
somebody your age adopting a baby.

758
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:16,200
No wife, no nothing.

759
00:53:16,325 --> 00:53:17,717
But I admire it.

760
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,722
I admire the hell out of it.

761
00:53:21,542 --> 00:53:23,197
How old are you going to be?

762
00:53:23,322 --> 00:53:24,785
I'm going to be 29.

763
00:53:25,265 --> 00:53:27,029
Christ to a cracker!

764
00:53:27,762 --> 00:53:29,874
- You speak Chinese?
- I'm learning.

765
00:53:32,038 --> 00:53:34,248
I speak a little Mandarin,
pretty fluent Thai

766
00:53:34,373 --> 00:53:36,446
but that's the extent
of my Asian language.

767
00:53:44,736 --> 00:53:47,249
How much do you make in the job?

768
00:53:47,972 --> 00:53:52,094
It's a commission-based thing so,
the more I sell the more I make.

769
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:54,723
Believe it or not,
I understand how commission works.

770
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,276
Now pipe down.

771
00:53:56,629 --> 00:53:57,982
Talk numbers. How much?

772
00:53:58,633 --> 00:54:01,993
I generally sell 5 beds a month,
and I get 5%

773
00:54:02,118 --> 00:54:03,459
of the pre-tax sales.

774
00:54:03,766 --> 00:54:06,994
You make $700 every month?
That could work.

775
00:54:07,964 --> 00:54:09,105
You like Harriet?

776
00:54:10,983 --> 00:54:12,641
She's had a tough go-over.

777
00:54:12,766 --> 00:54:15,568
You mess her up, I'll kill your parents.
Your parents still alive?

778
00:54:15,693 --> 00:54:16,885
- Yes.
- Good.

779
00:54:19,371 --> 00:54:21,228
Let's go girls. Come on up...

780
00:54:21,632 --> 00:54:22,960
Say goodnight.

781
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,449
Goodnight Brian.

782
00:54:30,532 --> 00:54:32,060
Freaking car...

783
00:54:33,578 --> 00:54:35,497
I think I'm gonna walk with Brian.

784
00:54:35,622 --> 00:54:38,063
Not this late at night you're not.
Get in the car.

785
00:54:38,366 --> 00:54:39,572
It's only 9:30.

786
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:41,936
Suit yourself.

787
00:54:42,236 --> 00:54:45,171
Take the avenues, no sidestreets.
Here here, take this.

788
00:54:45,296 --> 00:54:47,260
- What's this?
- It's a switchblade.

789
00:54:48,033 --> 00:54:50,072
Don't lose it, I got it in Corsica.

790
00:54:50,778 --> 00:54:52,664
- Bye daddy.
- Goodnight darling.

791
00:55:01,948 --> 00:55:03,052
What's up?

792
00:55:04,118 --> 00:55:05,809
I was in the neighborhood.

793
00:55:07,757 --> 00:55:09,072
This is Harriet...

794
00:55:15,101 --> 00:55:16,104
How are you?

795
00:55:17,386 --> 00:55:18,388
Larry.

796
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:22,027
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

797
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,990
What are you up to?

798
00:55:28,594 --> 00:55:32,416
Me, I'm just having some dinner,
drinking some vodka.

799
00:55:33,405 --> 00:55:34,833
You want some?

800
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,917
Is that purple vodka?

801
00:55:38,821 --> 00:55:40,420
Put a little extra shit in there.

802
00:55:41,324 --> 00:55:42,464
I'll have some.

803
00:55:45,594 --> 00:55:46,909
Sure, I guess.

804
00:55:47,633 --> 00:55:48,659
Alright.

805
00:55:49,956 --> 00:55:51,070
Let's do this.

806
00:55:56,393 --> 00:55:58,177
You want a little bit of ethanol?

807
00:55:59,673 --> 00:56:00,899
There you go.

808
00:56:01,653 --> 00:56:02,840
One for you.

809
00:56:03,356 --> 00:56:04,319
One for you.

810
00:56:05,268 --> 00:56:06,555
One for me.

811
00:56:07,013 --> 00:56:08,073
Can...

812
00:56:09,302 --> 00:56:10,617
we go down to the pool?

813
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:17,163
Sure.

814
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:20,545
Absolutely.
You wanna use the...

815
00:56:21,152 --> 00:56:22,409
wee lil'key here.

816
00:56:22,652 --> 00:56:23,480
Thanks.

817
00:56:23,856 --> 00:56:24,840
No problem.

818
00:56:25,513 --> 00:56:26,842
Have a great time.

819
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:27,968
Bye Larry.

820
00:56:28,374 --> 00:56:29,474
Nice to meet ya.

821
00:56:33,585 --> 00:56:34,766
Just stay here then.

822
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:38,817
So... what are we doing here?

823
00:56:40,045 --> 00:56:41,046
We swim.

824
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:48,804
In the nude, I presume?

825
00:56:49,629 --> 00:56:51,155
Well, pretty much.

826
00:56:56,468 --> 00:56:57,742
Let's go up here.

827
00:57:02,694 --> 00:57:05,626
Effectively combines
three of my great fears.

828
00:57:07,411 --> 00:57:08,414
The dark,

829
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:10,044
heights,

830
00:57:10,933 --> 00:57:12,266
public nudity.

831
00:57:55,668 --> 00:57:56,882
What if I'm scared?

832
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,476
You're not.

833
00:58:00,129 --> 00:58:01,896
Yes I am...
How do you know?

834
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:04,526
Well, I did it.

835
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:06,900
Good for you.

836
00:58:07,741 --> 00:58:08,941
Am I a virgin...

837
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:11,810
being thrown into the snakepit?

838
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:13,767
To honor the Kraken?

839
00:58:13,892 --> 00:58:16,338
I think we both know
that's not the case.

840
00:58:32,865 --> 00:58:34,715
Can we have sex over there?

841
00:58:36,637 --> 00:58:39,370
Do you want me to go ask
the security guard?

842
00:58:50,164 --> 00:58:53,665
Sweden has a quarter of the available
light we have here in the US.

843
00:58:54,235 --> 00:58:55,043
And?

844
00:58:55,525 --> 00:58:57,926
And what does less light mean?

845
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,332
Shorter days.

846
00:58:59,457 --> 00:59:01,514
Yes, but more importantly
longer nights.

847
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,649
These motherfuckers
know how to get themselves some sleep.

848
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:08,982
Me, I sleep like the dead anyway
but I cannot touch the Swedes.

849
00:59:09,717 --> 00:59:11,381
They outsleep everybody, but...

850
00:59:11,903 --> 00:59:14,361
They are some depressed,
suicidal niggers...

851
00:59:14,486 --> 00:59:15,886
I'll tell you that.

852
00:59:17,207 --> 00:59:20,561
Where is that, Iceland?
Anyway, be that as it may...

853
00:59:20,956 --> 00:59:22,055
They...

854
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:25,197
Can you hold on one second?

855
00:59:26,732 --> 00:59:27,733
Brian?

856
00:59:29,445 --> 00:59:30,642
Kenyatta called.

857
00:59:33,898 --> 00:59:35,153
<i>This is Kenyatta.</i>

858
00:59:35,703 --> 00:59:38,672
Hey, Kennyata, it's Brian Weathersby.

859
00:59:38,977 --> 00:59:40,104
<i>Hey Brian.</i>

860
00:59:40,888 --> 00:59:42,162
What's up man?

861
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,481
You called me.

862
00:59:44,556 --> 00:59:48,684
No... you called me.
I'm calling you back.

863
00:59:48,809 --> 00:59:51,632
<i>You're right!
They approved you.</i>

864
00:59:51,757 --> 00:59:53,097
<i>You're on the list.</i>

865
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:56,287
<i>So, listen man...
This is how it breaks down.</i>

866
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:00,263
<i>You are going to go to Hong Kong
in a few months,</i>

867
01:00:01,037 --> 01:00:04,203
and, we have
an international sister agency,

868
01:00:04,328 --> 01:00:06,843
they gonna handle it from there,
hook you up,

869
01:00:08,975 --> 01:00:12,176
I just wanna say,
congratu-fuckin-lations man, you did it.

870
01:00:13,792 --> 01:00:16,292
- Thanks.
- <i>So... I'll be in touch...</i>

871
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:20,026
<i>I'll probably have you come in
and take care of some financial stuffs,</i>

872
01:00:20,503 --> 01:00:22,258
<i>but congratulations!</i>

873
01:00:23,785 --> 01:00:25,595
- Thank you.
-<i> You got it baby.</i>

874
01:00:26,312 --> 01:00:27,313
<i>Laters.</i>

875
01:00:28,134 --> 01:00:28,942
Bye.

876
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:41,729
As I suspected gents
he didn't go for the black market idea.

877
01:00:42,315 --> 01:00:43,877
No go. I'll call it off.

878
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:45,895
I appreciate the effort though.

879
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:48,702
I owe you all for the due diligence.
This round's on me.

880
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:50,756
Weathersby,

881
01:00:51,086 --> 01:00:54,859
how come you've never had a wife?
Never a family.

882
01:00:55,278 --> 01:00:57,670
Just why,
if you don't mind us asking.

883
01:00:58,138 --> 01:01:00,490
- You guys are happily married, right?
- Yes.

884
01:01:01,238 --> 01:01:04,102
Look where it got you,
getting hand-pumped on a Tuesday night.

885
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,440
Why have you never done it, John?

886
01:01:19,565 --> 01:01:21,213
It's OK to not be married.

887
01:01:21,746 --> 01:01:22,863
Yes, it is.

888
01:01:25,806 --> 01:01:27,098
I was close once.

889
01:01:27,223 --> 01:01:28,284
Hawaiian broad.

890
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,317
What happened?

891
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,816
We split, she married a college
professor who brewed his own beer.

892
01:01:37,234 --> 01:01:38,743
What does it feel to study?

893
01:01:39,775 --> 01:01:40,975
Asian studies.

894
01:01:43,243 --> 01:01:45,455
Looks like
it turned out well for everybody.

895
01:01:46,339 --> 01:01:48,288
Here I am with you
fish-face perverts.

896
01:01:48,902 --> 01:01:51,167
Fuck you, round-eyed drouchebag.

897
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:52,692
Douchebag, Nagata.

898
01:01:53,151 --> 01:01:54,152
Douchebag.

899
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:57,546
Goddamn, if you don't try
to squeeze an "R" in every word.

900
01:01:58,222 --> 01:01:59,223
Asshole.

901
01:02:00,494 --> 01:02:03,528
You may work the balls a little bit,
we're gonna be here all night.

902
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:06,006
You want some goat stew?

903
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:07,480
You made that?

904
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,120
Hell, no.

905
01:02:09,245 --> 01:02:11,227
West Indian girl I know
made it for me.

906
01:02:11,818 --> 01:02:13,268
It's damn good too.

907
01:02:13,987 --> 01:02:16,400
Real dark-skinned girl,
ass like a beach ball.

908
01:02:22,396 --> 01:02:23,532
That's your girl?

909
01:02:26,095 --> 01:02:27,226
Body's tighted.

910
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:29,912
No disrespect.

911
01:02:34,843 --> 01:02:35,882
You're Roger.

912
01:02:36,007 --> 01:02:38,815
Good guess.
It's nice to meet you Happy.

913
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,768
You fine-looking thing you.

914
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,571
You want some goat stew?

915
01:02:43,956 --> 01:02:44,684
Sure.

916
01:02:44,963 --> 01:02:46,059
Be right back.

917
01:02:52,378 --> 01:02:53,882
So what's the big news?

918
01:02:56,313 --> 01:02:58,751
Shall we get a cup of coffee
or somethin'?

919
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:03,506
I don't know. Depends on how serious
this little meeting we're having is.

920
01:03:04,308 --> 01:03:05,446
Not serious.

921
01:03:09,017 --> 01:03:10,280
Here you go.

922
01:03:10,552 --> 01:03:13,144
One piping hot goat stew.

923
01:03:14,382 --> 01:03:15,482
Smells good.

924
01:03:15,828 --> 01:03:17,790
I'll leave you two lovebirds alone.

925
01:03:18,739 --> 01:03:21,011
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

926
01:03:26,316 --> 01:03:27,866
Or we can do it here.

927
01:03:28,832 --> 01:03:30,278
You're making me nervous.

928
01:03:30,795 --> 01:03:32,034
No, don't be.

929
01:03:32,832 --> 01:03:34,091
It's nothing really.

930
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:41,916
How's your soup?

931
01:03:45,598 --> 01:03:46,518
A little...

932
01:03:48,087 --> 01:03:49,288
ligamenty.

933
01:03:50,462 --> 01:03:53,251
- You don't have to eat it if you...
- No, it's good.

934
01:03:55,278 --> 01:03:56,301
So what is it?

935
01:03:58,067 --> 01:03:59,317
I got the baby.

936
01:04:03,935 --> 01:04:05,146
The baby, the baby?

937
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,840
I made the list.

938
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,587
I'm going to China,

939
01:04:12,066 --> 01:04:13,306
to get it and...

940
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,518
bring it back here.

941
01:04:20,646 --> 01:04:22,032
That's so great.

942
01:04:22,157 --> 01:04:23,012
I know.

943
01:04:26,523 --> 01:04:27,844
I know, it's crazy.

944
01:04:27,969 --> 01:04:29,269
On the one hand,

945
01:04:29,941 --> 01:04:31,190
I've been waiting...

946
01:04:32,336 --> 01:04:34,258
- I'm sick.
- for a long time...

947
01:04:34,383 --> 01:04:36,331
I really wanna hear this,
can you just

948
01:04:36,616 --> 01:04:38,600
hold this for one sec cause I just...

949
01:04:38,725 --> 01:04:41,303
Is there a bathroom
I could use really quickly?

950
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:42,456
Sure.

951
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:44,541
It's right over there.

952
01:04:45,762 --> 01:04:49,198
This is really great Brian.
I'm really excited for you.

953
01:05:35,194 --> 01:05:38,922
I'm so sorry I just run over
there are all these things I have to do.

954
01:05:39,047 --> 01:05:39,877
Like what?

955
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:43,406
Like, just stuffs for the show
and some other things.

956
01:05:43,531 --> 01:05:46,031
I could come with you,
this place is dead.

957
01:05:46,604 --> 01:05:49,112
Cause I just remembered
I have a doctor's appointment.

958
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,478
It's for my...

959
01:05:50,782 --> 01:05:52,148
Gynaecologist?

960
01:05:52,524 --> 01:05:55,178
You just remembered
you had a gynaecologist to see.

961
01:05:55,303 --> 01:05:56,881
So, I have to go.

962
01:05:57,378 --> 01:05:59,491
But I'll call you later and...

963
01:06:00,261 --> 01:06:02,745
Congratulations!
I'm super-psyched for you.

964
01:06:03,364 --> 01:06:06,820
My family's having a dinner
to celebrate tomorrow night.

965
01:06:06,945 --> 01:06:08,095
Can you come?

966
01:06:08,794 --> 01:06:09,592
Sure.

967
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:11,855
You could bring your dad if you want.

968
01:06:12,221 --> 01:06:13,222
Great.

969
01:06:13,771 --> 01:06:14,566
Great.

970
01:06:14,691 --> 01:06:15,489
Great.

971
01:06:16,531 --> 01:06:17,489
Great job.

972
01:06:33,248 --> 01:06:34,046
Mom?

973
01:06:35,532 --> 01:06:36,440
<i>Who's this?</i>

974
01:06:37,257 --> 01:06:38,407
It's Harriet.

975
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:41,337
Harriet?

976
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,100
How are you dear?

977
01:06:43,985 --> 01:06:44,986
I'm okay.

978
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:47,740
Oh God, good to hear your voice.

979
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:50,233
Thanks.

980
01:06:52,637 --> 01:06:53,848
What are you up to?

981
01:06:54,158 --> 01:06:56,358
You gotta get out here and see me.

982
01:06:57,022 --> 01:06:58,772
It's been too long, dear.

983
01:06:59,435 --> 01:07:01,085
Where are you, exactly?

984
01:07:01,811 --> 01:07:03,137
<i>This is the new place.</i>

985
01:07:03,262 --> 01:07:05,062
<i>The New Mexico house.</i>

986
01:07:05,863 --> 01:07:09,150
I thought it says Naples, Florida, 809?

987
01:07:14,682 --> 01:07:16,282
The... the Florida house.

988
01:07:19,689 --> 01:07:21,229
When did you move out there?

989
01:07:22,036 --> 01:07:22,914
<i>After cab.</i>

990
01:07:23,445 --> 01:07:26,778
We come here for the polo season end.

991
01:07:27,548 --> 01:07:28,920
Paul's car show.

992
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:30,486
Is Paul the new...

993
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:31,621
boyfriend?

994
01:07:31,746 --> 01:07:32,747
<i>He is.</i>

995
01:07:35,896 --> 01:07:37,679
Great. What does he do?

996
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:44,519
Nothing.
He likes cars and he owns a few ponies.

997
01:07:47,173 --> 01:07:50,400
- What are you up to?
- I'm relaxing,

998
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:55,029
I'm just here with some
of my lady friends and we're just...

999
01:07:56,056 --> 01:07:58,156
And we're just doing what we do.

1000
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:01,133
Why don't you come here and...

1001
01:08:01,258 --> 01:08:03,158
I'll pay for everything.

1002
01:08:04,666 --> 01:08:05,555
Maybe.

1003
01:08:07,227 --> 01:08:08,025
It's...

1004
01:08:08,819 --> 01:08:09,869
It's tough.

1005
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,922
I actually just called
to ask you something.

1006
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:16,005
I don't know
what you could possibly ask me.

1007
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:18,658
Just sort of a general question, mom.

1008
01:08:19,973 --> 01:08:23,888
I still get these alumni newsletters
from Graaten.

1009
01:08:24,165 --> 01:08:26,031
Do you want me to hold on to them?

1010
01:08:26,156 --> 01:08:28,980
I could put them in an envelope
for you or somethin'?

1011
01:08:29,254 --> 01:08:30,992
- <i>No, it's okay.</i>
- All right.

1012
01:08:33,452 --> 01:08:36,696
Anyways,
can I just ask you this thing?

1013
01:08:38,832 --> 01:08:41,082
Alright, if you feel like you must.

1014
01:08:44,999 --> 01:08:47,778
I'm seeing this guy
and he's about to...

1015
01:08:50,886 --> 01:08:53,590
Anyways I was with him and I...

1016
01:08:54,304 --> 01:08:56,220
I got really nervous and I...

1017
01:08:57,999 --> 01:09:00,136
went to the bathroom
and I threw up everywhere.

1018
01:09:00,393 --> 01:09:01,443
You're ill?

1019
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:04,223
<i>I'm not... I'm not ill.</i>

1020
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:07,408
I just went to the bathroom
and I threw up everywhere.

1021
01:09:08,041 --> 01:09:10,104
I just wondered if...

1022
01:09:10,858 --> 01:09:12,999
<i>you had ever done anything like that.</i>

1023
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:18,328
Honey, you probably
got a microbial virus or some...

1024
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:21,478
type of toxic food poisoning.

1025
01:09:21,703 --> 01:09:22,992
Did you eat from a deli?

1026
01:09:23,347 --> 01:09:25,497
No mom, I didn't eat from a deli.

1027
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,278
<i>Sweetheart. Hang up.</i>

1028
01:09:27,403 --> 01:09:29,741
<i>Don't give the phone company
all of our money.</i>

1029
01:09:30,577 --> 01:09:32,048
<i>You plan a trip.</i>

1030
01:09:32,173 --> 01:09:33,750
<i>Come up and see me.</i>

1031
01:09:34,502 --> 01:09:35,945
<i>And I'll make you soup.</i>

1032
01:09:36,746 --> 01:09:37,732
<i>And I'll...</i>

1033
01:09:38,464 --> 01:09:40,714
put you in bed and read you a book.

1034
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:42,874
And you need to get healthy.

1035
01:09:42,999 --> 01:09:43,831
<i>Down.</i>

1036
01:09:46,028 --> 01:09:47,368
Come down and see you.

1037
01:09:47,493 --> 01:09:48,494
<i>Of course.</i>

1038
01:09:48,892 --> 01:09:50,997
<i>Will you say hello to your father
for me?</i>

1039
01:09:51,122 --> 01:09:53,469
<i>And tell him I need to talk to him?</i>

1040
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:57,018
<i>Alright, beautiful.</i>

1041
01:09:58,136 --> 01:09:58,943
<i>Bye.</i>

1042
01:10:03,497 --> 01:10:05,788
I haven't been in an office
in 20 years.

1043
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:09,664
- This is different?
- Where are the offices?

1044
01:10:10,586 --> 01:10:11,836
These are them.

1045
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:13,824
These pens?

1046
01:10:14,934 --> 01:10:16,484
These aren't offices.

1047
01:10:16,741 --> 01:10:18,400
Where do you hang your topcoat?

1048
01:10:18,525 --> 01:10:19,924
Because your diploma

1049
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,183
is your artwork?

1050
01:10:22,306 --> 01:10:24,971
So sorry to keep you guys waiting.
I'm Kenyatta.

1051
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,140
- Kirby Weathersby.
- Nice to meet you.

1052
01:10:28,468 --> 01:10:30,393
Your son has been very

1053
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:33,016
diligent about this
and he's a rare case.

1054
01:10:33,433 --> 01:10:35,497
He's been talkin' bout it
his whole life.

1055
01:10:35,622 --> 01:10:36,816
Is that right?

1056
01:10:37,301 --> 01:10:39,801
For his 8th birthday,
I got him a bike.

1057
01:10:40,493 --> 01:10:41,976
Chrome mongoose.

1058
01:10:42,101 --> 01:10:45,215
He ran to his room crying,
said he wanted a baby,

1059
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,243
a Chinese baby for that matter.

1060
01:10:52,571 --> 01:10:55,259
Let's get down to some specifics.

1061
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:57,420
Can I get either of you
somethin' to drink?

1062
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:58,835
I'll take a bourbon.

1063
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,132
Dad. They don't do that.

1064
01:11:04,856 --> 01:11:06,846
Great. Nothing for me, thanks.

1065
01:11:08,201 --> 01:11:09,069
So...

1066
01:11:09,592 --> 01:11:10,998
Thanks for coming in.

1067
01:11:11,123 --> 01:11:14,774
Obviously you'll be
the baby's primary sponsor, Brian.

1068
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:16,886
And M. Weathersby...

1069
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:18,566
Kirby, please.

1070
01:11:21,839 --> 01:11:23,529
Your wife and two boys,

1071
01:11:23,964 --> 01:11:27,992
John and James, will be the baby's
secondary guardians, is that right?

1072
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,578
OK, great. Just sign here

1073
01:11:30,965 --> 01:11:32,965
and here, and initial here.

1074
01:11:34,193 --> 01:11:35,843
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1075
01:11:37,937 --> 01:11:40,805
Looks like you'll be headed
over to Hong Kong, 2 months.

1076
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:42,460
You'll spend 2 weeks there.

1077
01:11:42,585 --> 01:11:46,385
And then you'll be returning here
to New York with the baby.

1078
01:11:47,767 --> 01:11:49,117
This is terrific.

1079
01:11:49,868 --> 01:11:51,474
Brian, let's go celebrate.

1080
01:11:52,015 --> 01:11:54,416
Kenny, would you care to join us?

1081
01:11:54,674 --> 01:11:55,937
I would love to.

1082
01:11:56,434 --> 01:11:58,314
But I've got work to do here.

1083
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,701
Here's what you do.

1084
01:11:59,826 --> 01:12:03,194
Tell your girl to hold all your calls
and pop out for a quick one with us.

1085
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,844
Well, I don't have a girl, Kirby.

1086
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:09,992
Who makes your appointments?
Who takes your drycleaning in?

1087
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,161
I do.

1088
01:12:14,562 --> 01:12:16,839
Mercy, Lord, that's tragic.

1089
01:12:18,661 --> 01:12:19,662
Harriet.

1090
01:12:22,778 --> 01:12:25,928
Hey dad, this is Octavio,
he was just getting going.

1091
01:12:26,713 --> 01:12:28,559
Not on my account at all?

1092
01:12:28,684 --> 01:12:30,884
No, no, I've kept him long enough.

1093
01:12:33,022 --> 01:12:34,422
Take care Octavio.

1094
01:12:42,017 --> 01:12:42,909
Don't.

1095
01:12:48,454 --> 01:12:49,811
- So...
- So.

1096
01:12:50,849 --> 01:12:52,449
I'm going to cooking school.

1097
01:12:53,459 --> 01:12:54,400
In France.

1098
01:12:54,525 --> 01:12:55,332
Alright.

1099
01:12:55,736 --> 01:12:57,351
I just signed up online.

1100
01:12:58,952 --> 01:13:00,705
Why not take on another career?

1101
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:02,420
Blazed through 5 in 5 years.

1102
01:13:02,867 --> 01:13:05,374
- Dad.
- You're on pace for some kinda record.

1103
01:13:08,044 --> 01:13:09,994
I'm sorry, but chef school...

1104
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:13,389
I've never seen you do anything
but pour cereal.

1105
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,328
I really need your support right now.

1106
01:13:15,453 --> 01:13:17,237
I'll give you whatever you need.

1107
01:13:19,105 --> 01:13:19,937
Thank you.

1108
01:13:22,725 --> 01:13:24,900
Sure this isn't
coming from somewhere else?

1109
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,274
Like what?

1110
01:13:26,885 --> 01:13:28,635
Like... like your friend.

1111
01:13:30,368 --> 01:13:31,448
What about him?

1112
01:13:34,237 --> 01:13:35,335
Did he hurt you?

1113
01:13:41,367 --> 01:13:42,735
He told me he loved me.

1114
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:43,658
He did?

1115
01:13:44,822 --> 01:13:46,230
Yes... sort of.

1116
01:13:47,414 --> 01:13:49,064
And I sort of love him.

1117
01:13:50,484 --> 01:13:52,291
But now, I'm gonna...

1118
01:13:52,822 --> 01:13:55,139
commit myself fully to this?

1119
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:57,510
It's a swift change.

1120
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:01,127
But whatever you need,
I'll support you.

1121
01:14:03,019 --> 01:14:05,401
Some of the most important decisions
we make in life

1122
01:14:05,526 --> 01:14:07,902
are done in a matter of minutes,
even seconds.

1123
01:14:09,902 --> 01:14:10,971
It's your life.

1124
01:14:12,437 --> 01:14:13,687
Do as you will.

1125
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:19,889
He's asleep?

1126
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:22,515
Knocked out cold.

1127
01:14:28,522 --> 01:14:29,986
Should we get out of here?

1128
01:14:30,111 --> 01:14:32,040
You think she might show up
for dessert?

1129
01:14:32,165 --> 01:14:33,511
We already ate it.

1130
01:14:36,005 --> 01:14:37,855
That'd be the plates of cake?

1131
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,041
I'm sure she got tied up
with something important.

1132
01:14:43,911 --> 01:14:45,533
Just make sure she's alright.

1133
01:14:45,658 --> 01:14:46,498
Call her.

1134
01:14:46,827 --> 01:14:48,025
Drop by her place.

1135
01:14:51,122 --> 01:14:52,443
Get him home.

1136
01:14:52,568 --> 01:14:54,437
I'm gonna figure this thing out.

1137
01:14:56,306 --> 01:14:57,780
Congratulations big guy.

1138
01:14:58,550 --> 01:15:00,540
I'm so happy for you, Brian.

1139
01:15:01,329 --> 01:15:02,240
Thanks mom.

1140
01:15:04,296 --> 01:15:05,799
- Go get her sport.
- Bye.

1141
01:15:10,388 --> 01:15:11,777
That's gonna end poorly?

1142
01:15:12,669 --> 01:15:13,618
Jonathan?

1143
01:15:13,871 --> 01:15:15,395
It's just the way I see it.

1144
01:15:15,843 --> 01:15:17,896
Women, present company excluded,

1145
01:15:18,021 --> 01:15:21,380
are liars, thieves, and a categorical
waste of time and resources.

1146
01:15:21,505 --> 01:15:23,655
- You're a fool.
- I've been called worse.

1147
01:15:24,294 --> 01:15:26,040
Roland, <i>la cuenta</i>.

1148
01:15:29,727 --> 01:15:31,464
- How about dessert?
- Let's go.

1149
01:15:31,849 --> 01:15:33,783
- Let's go.
- I'll get the coats.

1150
01:15:52,831 --> 01:15:54,672
Good bye. You're crazy.

1151
01:16:07,426 --> 01:16:08,656
How are you doing?

1152
01:16:09,689 --> 01:16:10,985
I'm a little cramped.

1153
01:16:12,516 --> 01:16:14,166
I'm sorry about dinner.

1154
01:16:16,563 --> 01:16:17,586
What happened?

1155
01:16:18,647 --> 01:16:20,147
I was at work and...

1156
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:23,902
we couldn't get any cell service
when we were taping

1157
01:16:24,027 --> 01:16:27,957
but then Melanie was kinda like
in my ear the whole day

1158
01:16:28,082 --> 01:16:31,276
and I left my phone
in my purse and...

1159
01:16:33,023 --> 01:16:33,877
It was...

1160
01:16:35,239 --> 01:16:36,337
just kind of...

1161
01:16:37,943 --> 01:16:39,143
Is that a lie?

1162
01:16:44,483 --> 01:16:45,309
Kind of.

1163
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,692
Do you wanna come upstairs?

1164
01:17:49,844 --> 01:17:51,093
How was your dinner?

1165
01:17:59,516 --> 01:18:00,517
I'm sorry.

1166
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:05,210
This is definitely my fault.

1167
01:18:06,859 --> 01:18:08,979
I just have so much I wanna tell you.

1168
01:18:11,489 --> 01:18:13,169
First, I wanna tell you that...

1169
01:18:14,155 --> 01:18:15,405
I care for you.

1170
01:18:16,982 --> 01:18:18,082
I really do.

1171
01:18:22,624 --> 01:18:24,306
Never met anyone like you.

1172
01:18:32,314 --> 01:18:34,465
I'm just so fucked up.

1173
01:18:37,122 --> 01:18:38,907
I don't have a real job

1174
01:18:39,996 --> 01:18:41,796
and never had a boyfriend.

1175
01:18:42,212 --> 01:18:43,594
Never really been in love.

1176
01:18:45,094 --> 01:18:46,813
It's just a lot.

1177
01:18:47,574 --> 01:18:49,221
It's too much.

1178
01:18:52,136 --> 01:18:53,979
You are about to have a fucking kid.

1179
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,798
I know.

1180
01:19:02,841 --> 01:19:03,989
I understand.

1181
01:19:07,278 --> 01:19:08,489
It's disappointing.

1182
01:19:09,071 --> 01:19:09,869
But...

1183
01:19:10,916 --> 01:19:13,616
I guess I had to know one way
or the other.

1184
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:17,189
I feel like shit.

1185
01:19:19,483 --> 01:19:20,561
I am shit.

1186
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:25,631
I'm gonna go to chef school.
Next week, in France.

1187
01:19:29,824 --> 01:19:30,643
What?

1188
01:19:31,755 --> 01:19:33,835
- I didn't know...
- Neither did I but...

1189
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,802
I speak French so... I guess...

1190
01:19:39,813 --> 01:19:43,635
- It's gonna be a fresh start...
- Can I have a little more vodka?

1191
01:20:07,718 --> 01:20:09,861
I think our work here is done.

1192
01:20:09,986 --> 01:20:12,088
- No Brian, don't go like that.
- Sorry...

1193
01:20:12,213 --> 01:20:14,610
- Please be mad at me...
- I've got much to worry about.

1194
01:20:14,735 --> 01:20:16,852
- I'm gonna go.
- Just stay a little while?

1195
01:20:16,977 --> 01:20:19,190
Sorry, that would be
a little fucking easy.

1196
01:20:24,644 --> 01:20:27,304
You're really enjoying your
self-righteousness now?

1197
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:43,676
I've an international power converter
thing in my apartment if you need it.

1198
01:20:45,796 --> 01:20:49,086
I got it in France when I was 18.

1199
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:13,205
You don't understand.

1200
01:23:16,438 --> 01:23:17,376
There's...

1201
01:23:18,146 --> 01:23:20,579
something going on for a long time.

1202
01:23:55,195 --> 01:23:56,427
Hello...

1203
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:01,256
- Hello?
- <i>We're on our way.</i>

1204
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:07,750
When I get to the house,
I press the button with your name on it?

1205
01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:13,840
What I don't understand is, how is
the button big enough to hold your name?

1206
01:24:14,006 --> 01:24:16,593
Name is next to the button, dad.

1207
01:24:19,295 --> 01:24:22,389
- And the porter will clear it?
- There's no doorman, dad.

1208
01:24:23,473 --> 01:24:25,895
<i>No porter? What do you mean?
You mean no one?</i>

1209
01:24:26,469 --> 01:24:27,267
No.

1210
01:24:27,645 --> 01:24:30,551
Who does your shoes?
Who take care of deliveries?

1211
01:24:30,676 --> 01:24:33,590
Dad, just ring the buzzer
and I'll buzz you up.

1212
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,838
You'll figure it out
when you get here?

1213
01:24:39,022 --> 01:24:40,701
Alright, see you there. Bye...

1214
01:24:41,459 --> 01:24:42,831
How do you shut this off?

1215
01:24:44,232 --> 01:24:46,570
- Right there.
- Hit the green, no, hit the red.

1216
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:49,258
Thanks for the cellphone.

1217
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:52,635
He's living in squalor.

1218
01:25:20,211 --> 01:25:21,849
I thought you'd already gone.

1219
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:25,369
My plane is supposed
to leave tomorrow, but...

1220
01:25:26,523 --> 01:25:29,082
I thought I'd come by
and get the power converter.

1221
01:25:33,127 --> 01:25:34,649
What happened to your face?

1222
01:25:35,928 --> 01:25:38,008
- A pickup game.
- A pickup game?

1223
01:25:38,448 --> 01:25:39,750
Some frat boys.

1224
01:25:43,530 --> 01:25:44,848
Are you having a party?

1225
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:48,626
My folks are coming by
and my brothers are coming too.

1226
01:25:51,122 --> 01:25:52,914
Is there someone here?

1227
01:25:56,364 --> 01:25:57,835
Maybe I should leave.

1228
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:11,185
This is the little one.

1229
01:26:15,493 --> 01:26:17,229
I thought you had to go to China.

1230
01:26:19,087 --> 01:26:21,304
The agency called and...

1231
01:26:21,429 --> 01:26:24,345
this couple in <i>Long Island</i>
flipped out and got cold feet.

1232
01:26:27,233 --> 01:26:28,308
She's yours?

1233
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:32,405
Went out there last week, and...

1234
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:35,680
we're celebrating one week
together today.

1235
01:26:38,912 --> 01:26:40,158
This is May.

1236
01:26:41,082 --> 01:26:42,398
Did you pick that?

1237
01:26:42,662 --> 01:26:44,636
No, but I like it.

1238
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:46,803
Me too.

1239
01:26:46,928 --> 01:26:48,249
She's beautiful.

1240
01:26:48,748 --> 01:26:49,947
I think so too.

1241
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:55,935
Let me get that thing.

1242
01:27:05,469 --> 01:27:07,661
- The door?
- Can you just buzz that?

1243
01:27:14,803 --> 01:27:15,979
Stay there.

1244
01:27:19,964 --> 01:27:21,252
Think this is it.

1245
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:25,365
Should work in all of Europe.

1246
01:27:26,281 --> 01:27:28,633
Brian, I wanted to talk to you
a little bit more.

1247
01:27:28,758 --> 01:27:32,844
- My entire family is about to arrive.
- I know, I just wanted to apologize

1248
01:27:32,969 --> 01:27:37,466
For acting out and I'm sorry for being
so weird and I wanted to tell you...

1249
01:27:37,591 --> 01:27:40,255
Alright, let's have a little look
at the little Samurai.

1250
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:45,329
- Samurai's Japanese, dad.
- Akibonos, little panda, where's she?

1251
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:47,304
Oh my God!

1252
01:27:49,186 --> 01:27:54,016
She is the most darling thing
I've ever seen. Can I hold her?

1253
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:58,993
Thank you. Barbara, we gotta apply
and get one of these.

1254
01:27:59,449 --> 01:28:00,387
You did it!

1255
01:28:00,633 --> 01:28:01,902
So damn proud of ya!

1256
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:08,202
- This is not just champagne.
- Hey, everyone...

1257
01:28:11,365 --> 01:28:12,498
This is Happy.

1258
01:28:13,468 --> 01:28:16,015
I thought you were going off
to become a chef.

1259
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:18,414
Yeah, well, I...

1260
01:28:18,539 --> 01:28:21,952
I signed up for a cooking school
on the internet...

1261
01:28:24,298 --> 01:28:28,410
It doesn't exist
because it dissolved in 2004

1262
01:28:28,535 --> 01:28:30,649
and they didn't update the website...

1263
01:28:30,774 --> 01:28:34,852
- I see...
- But I'm gonna study here in the city.

1264
01:28:34,977 --> 01:28:39,319
Marvelous! That's fantastic,
because we need someone in this family

1265
01:28:39,605 --> 01:28:40,595
who can cook.

1266
01:28:41,111 --> 01:28:43,968
Because frankly, Barbara don't get
your nose outta the joint,

1267
01:28:44,304 --> 01:28:47,781
collectively we can't make
buttered toast.

1268
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,218
John Weathersby.

1269
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:52,604
- Nice to meet you.
- Get outta here.

1270
01:28:53,636 --> 01:28:55,022
A toast, Brian?

1271
01:28:56,493 --> 01:28:59,153
Why don't you do it Grandpa?
You're good at it.

1272
01:28:59,685 --> 01:29:01,812
Good... I'll take that bait.

1273
01:29:01,937 --> 01:29:03,828
- I'm James.
- Hi, I'm Happy.

1274
01:29:06,923 --> 01:29:08,855
Since brevity is the soul of wit

1275
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:13,854
and tediousness its limbs
and outward flourishes.

1276
01:29:14,427 --> 01:29:16,513
Therefore, I shall be brief.

1277
01:29:16,933 --> 01:29:19,762
- Twait.
- That's William Shakespeare, boy.

1278
01:29:21,432 --> 01:29:22,244
May...

1279
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:27,445
a new child, a new life,
a new family...

1280
01:29:28,272 --> 01:29:30,093
Welcome, little May...

1281
01:29:30,906 --> 01:29:34,111
and love... love love love.

1282
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:38,317
You're in good kind hands.

1283
01:29:38,667 --> 01:29:42,556
And here's to many many
happy birthdays to come

1284
01:29:42,681 --> 01:29:45,213
and I'll be at every one of them!
Salud!

1285
01:29:46,033 --> 01:29:47,111
Salud!

1286
01:29:53,073 --> 01:29:55,845
- Have you got any beer in the fridge?
- No.

1287
01:29:58,093 --> 01:30:02,433
Would you like to come and... to a deli
and see if we can pick up some beer?

1288
01:30:03,022 --> 01:30:04,871
There's a deli...

1289
01:30:05,213 --> 01:30:06,291
two blocks

1290
01:30:07,166 --> 01:30:09,645
that way, it's in here...
the elevator.

1291
01:30:10,752 --> 01:30:12,095
I don't drink beer.

1292
01:30:25,591 --> 01:30:26,838
It's okay dear.

1293
01:30:27,257 --> 01:30:28,307
I'm sorry.

1294
01:30:29,029 --> 01:30:30,219
Don't be sorry.

1295
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:37,052
I really wanted
to come to the dinner.

1296
01:30:39,145 --> 01:30:40,251
It's okay.

1297
01:30:42,341 --> 01:30:44,637
I called my mother the other day.

1298
01:30:45,519 --> 01:30:46,331
She...

1299
01:30:46,985 --> 01:30:49,071
She didn't know who I was at first.

1300
01:30:51,928 --> 01:30:54,169
She doesn't call me on my birthday
I'm sorry.

1301
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,006
When is your birthday?

1302
01:31:01,264 --> 01:31:02,174
June 9th.

1303
01:31:06,539 --> 01:31:10,501
I was half a geezer,
when I had that boy.

1304
01:31:12,230 --> 01:31:14,078
He's been sweet his whole life.

1305
01:31:15,269 --> 01:31:17,607
But he never had the family
the other kids did.

1306
01:31:19,166 --> 01:31:21,756
Everyone thought that we were
his grandparents.

1307
01:31:23,515 --> 01:31:25,700
He told his teacher once that...

1308
01:31:26,288 --> 01:31:30,527
His real parents had died in a car crash
and his grandparents took him on.

1309
01:31:31,587 --> 01:31:32,399
He did?

1310
01:31:35,175 --> 01:31:36,758
He was confused I guess.

1311
01:31:38,172 --> 01:31:39,474
I don't blame him.

1312
01:31:41,114 --> 01:31:43,314
It wasn't disloyal, he was...

1313
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:45,736
he was just trying to

1314
01:31:46,071 --> 01:31:48,570
make everything seem normal,
I suppose.

1315
01:31:51,087 --> 01:31:52,515
But nothing's normal.

1316
01:31:54,445 --> 01:31:56,195
You guys seem pretty normal.

1317
01:31:57,163 --> 01:31:58,108
We're not.

1318
01:31:59,417 --> 01:32:01,818
You have a right
to be worried and afraid.

1319
01:32:02,551 --> 01:32:05,757
I'm just afraid that I fucked
everything up beyond repair.

1320
01:32:06,943 --> 01:32:08,329
Nothing's fucked up.

1321
01:32:09,463 --> 01:32:11,065
Nothing's beyond repair.

1322
01:32:14,947 --> 01:32:15,997
Thank you.

1323
01:32:18,957 --> 01:32:20,021
You're welcome.

1324
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:22,963
Shall we go back?

1325
01:32:24,022 --> 01:32:26,962
This could use a wall light
or some kinda industrial screw.

1326
01:32:27,087 --> 01:32:30,883
The pipe looks strong enough, the rope
looks strong enough, leave that.

1327
01:32:31,978 --> 01:32:33,784
Welcome back girls.
Have a seat.

1328
01:32:35,776 --> 01:32:37,078
Now, Happy...

1329
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:40,264
For your benefit,
I want you to know that...

1330
01:32:41,077 --> 01:32:44,579
For the kids when they were born
I would make...

1331
01:32:45,537 --> 01:32:48,261
a <i>pinata</i> of a famous dictator,

1332
01:32:48,386 --> 01:32:49,875
fill it with bitter honey.

1333
01:32:51,112 --> 01:32:53,208
John, had Stalin.

1334
01:32:53,514 --> 01:32:55,194
James had Mussolini.

1335
01:32:55,604 --> 01:32:56,626
And Brian...

1336
01:32:57,494 --> 01:32:58,698
had Pol Pot.

1337
01:32:59,267 --> 01:33:00,818
You see the progression?

1338
01:33:00,943 --> 01:33:02,285
And this is...

1339
01:33:02,627 --> 01:33:05,330
Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi.

1340
01:33:05,665 --> 01:33:06,862
Let's whack him.

1341
01:33:09,256 --> 01:33:10,671
Since May

1342
01:33:10,796 --> 01:33:15,340
can't exercise her own honor,
I'm sure she would want you to be

1343
01:33:15,925 --> 01:33:17,372
the proxy whacker.

1344
01:33:19,737 --> 01:33:22,149
- Blindfold her please.
- Yes sir.

1345
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:35,305
You won't be able to break it with the
first burst. You're only going to...

1346
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:38,808
put a start on it because of its
superior workmanship.

1347
01:33:47,593 --> 01:33:48,699
Over here.

1348
01:33:50,073 --> 01:33:51,595
Attagirl. Straight.

1349
01:34:06,014 --> 01:34:09,091
Here here, gimme that baby.
Come on...

1350
01:34:12,388 --> 01:34:16,254
Brian, there's a deuce loose
in the caboose

1351
01:34:16,379 --> 01:34:19,047
and I'm not well-versed
in that detail.

1352
01:34:25,231 --> 01:34:26,310
Champagne,

1353
01:34:27,415 --> 01:34:28,451
cocktails,

1354
01:34:29,179 --> 01:34:30,141
drinks...

1355
01:34:31,887 --> 01:34:34,168
Come on everyone we must drink up,

1356
01:34:35,603 --> 01:34:38,558
today is one big fucking day...

1357
01:34:50,476 --> 01:34:55,023
