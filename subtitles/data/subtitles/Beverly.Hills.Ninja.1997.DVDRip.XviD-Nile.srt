1
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,746
For hundreds of years in Japan,
there has lived a clan...

2
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:57,912
...who have dedicated themselves to
a secret art of self-defense...

3
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,955
...and survival.

4
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:06,361
The art is so lethal that
it has made the clan invincible.

5
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,592
To this day, we are known as...

6
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,464
...ninjas.

7
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,398
Twenty-five years ago...

8
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:18,008
...an ancient legend
of this sacred art came alive.

9
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:22,737
lt spoke of a foreign child
who would come among us...

10
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:27,113
...and become a ninja master
like none other.

11
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,229
How he arrived on our shores...

12
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,161
...will forever remain a mystery.

13
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,380
We ninjas thought that this child...

14
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,789
...would be the Great White Ninja
of the legend.

15
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,890
We were wrong.

16
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,642
We were very wrong.

17
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,049
Haru!

18
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,762
Haru.

19
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,763
Gobei.

20
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,867
I need your honest opinion
about something.

21
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,036
Yes, sensei.

22
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,137
What do you think of Haru?

23
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,665
I Iove my brother.
His heart's Iike a fIower.

24
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,707
His determination's Iike a tiger.

25
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,282
He's a fat fooI and an
embarrassment to ninjas everywhere.

26
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:51,282
Today, I am proud to be your sensei.

27
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,525
This is that speciaI time
when I can say to you:

28
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,928
''You are a ninja.''

29
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,655
You can communicate with
other ninjas...

30
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:04,303
...by projecting yourseIf
onto the PIane of EnIightenment.

31
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,708
Remember...

32
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,046
...on this pIane...

33
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,515
...which can be shared by
no other mortaI...

34
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,918
...we can aIways contact each other
wherever we may be.

35
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,523
As a ninja...

36
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,060
...you are one with the universe.

37
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,211
AII of you
who are graduating today...

38
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,746
...wiII receive the medaIIion
of the Tengu Warrior.

39
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,553
However, I give the goIden medaIIion
to my finest student.

40
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,184
Gobei.

41
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:05,061
Forged in the fires
of confidence and discipIine.

42
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,429
Carry it with you aIways.

43
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,588
Sorry, Haru.

44
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,399
CongratuIations, big brother.

45
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,742
Wait! Sensei, wait for me!

46
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,238
Sensei, I am so excited about tonight.

47
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,279
I have been waiting
for such a Iong time!

48
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,008
Tonight's exercise
is for the ninjas onIy.

49
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,881
But your job is an important one.

50
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,614
You are to remain here
to protect the viIIage...

51
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,690
...and guard the dojo.

52
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,559
I shaII do as you say.

53
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,287
I shaII protect the viIIage
and guard the dojo.

54
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,296
And I shaII water the pIants.

55
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,201
Good Iuck. Good Iuck.

56
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,805
Stay Iow so as not to be detected.

57
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,635
Good Iuck, my brother.

58
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,298
Do not try it.

59
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,769
Don't try it.

60
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,346
Are you communicating with me?

61
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,148
Are you communicating with me?

62
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:20,864
HeIIo?

63
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:27,035
Excuse me.
Is this the Takagure dojo?

64
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,139
I'm sorry.
This must be the wrong pIace.

65
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,780
No! PIease do not go.
I mean....

66
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,751
Yes, this is the Takagure dojo.

67
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,451
Oh, thank goodness.

68
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,882
Let me take your...

69
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,147
...shoes.

70
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,259
Thank you.

71
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,894
I was toId that
I couId find a ninja here.

72
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,293
ReaIIy?

73
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,233
PIease, sit.

74
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,632
Wait!

75
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,605
Thank you.

76
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,276
That's very impressive.

77
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,709
So are you a ninja?

78
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,385
Yes, I am.

79
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,656
But you're white.

80
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,658
You are observant
as weII as beautifuI.

81
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,058
I'm sorry. I didn't expect
to find a white ninja.

82
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,623
Do not be fooIed
by the coIor of my skin.

83
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:30,233
Haven't you heard of the white chiId
who'II grow up to become...

84
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,267
...the greatest ninja master of aII?

85
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,338
-Is that you?
-Some say it is so.

86
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,032
You see, it is written
in this hoIy writ.

87
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,504
This hoIds the teachings
of aII ninjutsu...

88
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,276
...that have been passed down
for generations over five centuries.

89
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,886
And in this writ there's a Iegend
about a Great White Ninja?

90
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:51,920
You see here....

91
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,751
''In the 1 6th century
there came to pass--''

92
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,225
This is the wrong writ.

93
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,991
This is about the sensei
and the twin geishas.

94
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,963
AIso a good Iegend...

95
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,570
...but not the one
we were Iooking for.

96
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,997
Here is my Iegend.

97
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,768
''It is foretoId that
a foreign chiId wiII come...

98
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,970
...and become a ninja master
Iike no other.''

99
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,307
It's burning.

100
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,779
Yes, the words are seared
into my souI.

101
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,475
I mean it's reaIIy on fire!

102
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:21,880
Yes, I can teII.

103
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,070
They may have a second copy.

104
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,603
PIease teII me...

105
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,742
...why you have come to my dojo.

106
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:49,347
I warn you that what I'm gonna
ask you to do might be dangerous.

107
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:52,039
Danger is my companion.

108
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,448
Miss...?

109
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,644
SaIIy. SaIIy Jones.

110
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,015
I am Haru.

111
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,781
Do not worry about Haru.

112
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,652
This ninja knows no fear.

113
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,796
You see, I am a trained master
in each of the weapons of battIe.

114
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,737
That rack was not buiIt by ninjas.

115
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,570
This, however, was.

116
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,884
Luck is with me...

117
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,791
...for this sacred shrine
hoIds the ashes...

118
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,296
...of our faIIen ninja warriors.

119
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,574
Sensei is going to kiII me!

120
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,234
Takure.

121
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,774
Master Go.

122
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,114
Tampo?

123
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,350
Kai?

124
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,784
I think they worked as a team.

125
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,186
TeII me why you are
in need of a ninja.

126
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,560
I've heard ninjas can get into pIaces
without being seen.

127
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,225
This is important, because
what I need requires great steaIth.

128
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:22,902
You are in Iuck.
My highest grades were in steaIth.

129
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,770
Let me give you an exampIe.

130
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,537
CIose your eyes, turn around
and count to nine.

131
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,113
When you open them,
I wiII be gone.

132
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,179
One, two...

133
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,879
...three, four...

134
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,660
...five, six...

135
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,823
...seven, eight...

136
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:47,495
...nine.

137
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,159
HeIIo?

138
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,762
Here I am.

139
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,134
SaIIy Jones, I wiII accept
your dangerous mission.

140
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,675
Oh, that's great.
Thank you.

141
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,347
Here's my probIem.
I'm seeing this man.

142
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:03,947
Oh, you have a man friend.

143
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,845
I've become suspicious of him.

144
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,643
He may be seeing another woman.

145
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,185
I think it's bigger than that.

146
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,381
I've discovered he has a meeting
tomorrow by the harbor.

147
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,924
ExceIIent.
You too shouId be a ninja.

148
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,928
I need you to find out what he's up to.
His name's Martin TanIey...

149
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,226
...and he has a Iimousine
with this Iicense pIate number.

150
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,100
3-5-1 -0-2.

151
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,667
Where shaII I contact you?

152
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,539
It's important that
you don't try to contact me.

153
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,977
I'II contact you before
I return to the States.

154
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,044
Whatever you wish. I wiII foIIow
your boyfriend, SaIIy Jones.

155
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,313
My eyes wiII be Iike
the tentacIes of a squid.

156
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:45,751
Good.

157
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,655
I guess.

158
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,088
Thank you.

159
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,831
Yes! I got you.

160
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,353
Good morning, Mr. TanIey.

161
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,545
Nobu.

162
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,024
It's aII set.
They'II meet us here.

163
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,818
Let's have a Iook at it, then.

164
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,189
-Oh, yes.
-It's a perfect counterfeit.

165
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,299
Yes, one we can dupIicate
1 0 miIIion times.

166
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,311
Martin TanIey,
attack me with your front gate...

167
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,004
...I come in the back door.

168
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,844
Oh, yes. They are beautifuI.

169
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,681
I have some bad news.

170
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,015
What?

171
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:28,022
I have the pIates for
onIy one side of the biII.

172
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,424
Excuse me?

173
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,755
We tried to get the ones
for the other side...

174
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,364
-...but they're heId up in Los AngeIes.
-Why?

175
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,625
-I don't know.
-You're paid weII to know.

176
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,129
I arranged to get this set of pIates.

177
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:44,633
I've just paid a miIIion doIIars for
one side of a 1 0,000 yen biII.

178
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,635
What good does that do me?

179
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,408
No good.

180
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,777
WeII, here's some advice
for your next Iife:

181
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,214
Never take a job you can't compIete.

182
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:59,207
Sensei, I am sorry I posed as a ninja,
but this woman needed my heIp.

183
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,181
It's you who needs heIp.

184
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,652
I have Iearned the poIice beIieve
a ninja committed a murder.

185
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,325
BeIieve me, sensei.
I kiIIed no one.

186
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,553
I do beIieve you, Haru,
but I'm worried.

187
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,892
Do not worry about me.
It is the woman who is in troubIe.

188
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,933
Does it not seem IikeIy
that this woman hired you...

189
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,538
...because she wanted someone
she couId bIame for this murder?

190
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,972
She is incapabIe of such things.
She is as IoveIy as a dove.

191
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:30,410
It sounds to me you are being
Ied around by your short sword.

192
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:35,051
Gobei caIIed her hoteI.
There is no one named SaIIy Jones.

193
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,881
A woman such as you described
had the name AIison Page.

194
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,793
Perhaps she gave the hoteI
a faIse name.

195
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,225
Perhaps she gave you the faIse name.

196
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,195
Sensei, beIieve me.
This woman's teIIing the truth.

197
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,392
You are unabIe to teII
truth from untruth.

198
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,766
That is impossibIe.
My ninja intuition teIIs me this.

199
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,463
You don't have ninja intuition.

200
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,235
You do not even have
normaI intuition.

201
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,141
AII my feeIings teII me
SaIIy Jones is in troubIe.

202
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,611
I must go to America
to protect her.

203
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,446
What makes you think you can
find her in America?

204
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,753
I have this.

205
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,486
My mission is cIear.

206
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,391
I must go to the hiIIs of BeverIy,
find SaIIy Jones and save her.

207
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:24,194
And prove, once and for aII,
that I am the Great White Ninja.

208
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,400
I wiII miss you.
Goodbye.

209
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,010
Goodbye.

210
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,620
Gobei, I've aIways Iooked up to you
and you've aIways Iooked out for me.

211
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,818
But now it's time
I Iook out for myseIf.

212
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,521
Be carefuI in your traveIs.
The worId is a dangerous pIace.

213
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,169
Thank you, big brother.

214
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,413
Though I think it is wrong for you
to make this journey...

215
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,343
...I want you to take this.

216
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,620
Use them onIy for necessities.

217
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,551
BeIieve in yourseIf, my son.

218
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,629
I know you wiII succeed.

219
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,195
Thank you, sensei.

220
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:29,457
There is no better father
that a boy couId have had.

221
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:30,865
Go, Haru.

222
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,639
Wait! Wait up!

223
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,106
Goodbye, everyone!

224
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,617
I'm surprised,
but I'm going to miss him.

225
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,376
No, you wiII not.

226
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,717
Because you are going with him.

227
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,652
No! PIease!
Anything but that!

228
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,916
Goodbye, my famiIy!

229
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,885
See you! Don't worry--

230
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,959
You wiII become his shadow.

231
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,931
No one can know
you are heIping him...

232
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,899
...especiaIIy Haru.

233
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,732
Goodbye, everyone!

234
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,972
I'II take your bag.

235
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,015
Empty your pockets, pIease.

236
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,580
I am sure you wouId Iike to know
who I am and what I do.

237
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,690
But as part of my creed,
I cannot teII you.

238
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,885
You see, my identity must remain
mysterious and my mission secret.

239
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,621
I cannot reveaI it to you.

240
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:07,924
Why not?

241
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,268
Because I wouId then
have to kiII you.

242
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,994
Daddy!

243
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,834
Daddy, he said
he was going to kiII me!

244
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,776
What did you say to my kid?

245
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,607
I was mereIy reIating to the chiId
the importance--

246
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,123
That's it. Grab it.

247
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,013
Thanks, asshoIe!

248
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,616
You are weIcome.

249
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,205
What happened?

250
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,207
The pIates were taken
by a gang caIIed the <i>K</i>obudosai.

251
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,778
I don't care who they are.
I want them back.

252
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:03,970
It's being arranged.

253
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,742
But it has to be done deIicateIy,
not Iike in Japan.

254
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:10,012
Nobu, this is BeverIy HiIIs.
Everyone behaves deIicateIy.

255
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,952
Why do you think crooks Iike me
are so weII-respected?

256
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,749
My dear...

257
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,359
-...how was your shopping?
-Good.

258
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,755
Share some Iunch?

259
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:36,143
-May I take your bag?
-Thanks, asshoIe.

260
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,372
You're weIcome, sir.

261
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,096
You see, sensei?

262
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,499
It is aII coming together.

263
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:17,821
Seventy-three minutes to deIiver
two suitcases and one garment bag.

264
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,581
Do you have an expIanation?

265
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,885
Yes, sir. I seem to be coming down
with a miId case...

266
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,358
...of tunneI carpaI syndrome
in my wrist.

267
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,931
I think it's from carrying
reaI heavy garment bags around.

268
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,364
Now I don't want to go
on disabiIity...

269
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,834
...and sue this company for miIIions.

270
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,473
So I figured
I wouId just pace myseIf.

271
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:40,634
Mr. Washington, everything
you do irritates me.

272
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,305
I'm going to go soak my wrists.

273
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:46,779
May I heIp you, sir?

274
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,477
Yes. I am Iooking for
a SaIIy Jones.

275
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,151
I'm sorry. I don't see
that name in my computer.

276
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,725
Now, if you'II excuse me.

277
00:24:56,928 --> 00:25:00,193
I'd Iike to rent one of your Iodgings.
Is the cost great?

278
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,730
Compared to what?
A hut in a rice paddy?

279
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:06,563
Sir, we are a five-star hoteI
with 800 rooms...

280
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,796
...booked six months in advance.

281
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:09,905
I have money.

282
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:13,077
I'm sure you do.
UnfortunateIy, we don't take wampum.

283
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,371
Do you, perhaps, take goId?

284
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:21,407
Front!

285
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:25,547
Perhaps I shaII send
Dom Perignon to your room?

286
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,452
I prefer to be aIone tonight.

287
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,184
Perhaps Iater I wiII meet
your friend Don.

288
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,229
1 A.

289
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,897
My wrists!

290
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,133
What you got in here? Car radios?

291
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:40,731
Here you go, sir.

292
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,806
WeIcome to the Rodeo PIaza HoteI.

293
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,956
What are you?
A spy or something?

294
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,594
A spy?

295
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,427
A spy is Iike a gnat
compared to a ninja.

296
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:09,834
Ninja?

297
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,799
You're a ninja? Get out of here!
You're a ninja!

298
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,335
Yes, I am a ninja.

299
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,336
I took a few karate Iessons myseIf.

300
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,008
I'm not as advanced as you.

301
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:21,542
I'm what you might caII
a tangerine beIt, orange beIt.

302
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,840
I'm one of them citrus coIors.
You know what I'm saying.

303
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,344
Very admirabIe.
Then perhaps you wiII know...

304
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,352
...what these are.

305
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,867
Man, that was dope!

306
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,731
What are you?
Like a third-degree bIack beIt?

307
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,171
The bIackness of my beIt
is Iike the inside of a coffin...

308
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,277
...on a moonIess night.

309
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:57,841
That's pretty bIack.

310
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,516
It is a bIack art.

311
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,380
And I, Haru, am the bIackest
of the bIack.

312
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:05,818
Or, actuaIIy,
the Great White, bIack art...

313
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,616
...bIackest master.

314
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,054
Hey, man.

315
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,854
Do you know what I do
once I Ieave here?

316
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,826
-No. What?
-I'm running.

317
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,523
I'm aIways running, man.
My neighborhood's bad.

318
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:20,193
I run to get cigarettes and miIk
and to take out the trash.

319
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,999
You know why?
Because whenever I Ieave my house...

320
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,369
...somebody's just waiting
to kick my ass.

321
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,875
You gotta show me
a IittIe of what you know.

322
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,240
Just a kick or a jab.
Something.

323
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:33,281
If I do this, you must give me
your soIemn promise...

324
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,680
...that you wiII not
question my authority.

325
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,549
No probIem, man.
I went to CathoIic schooI.

326
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,189
AII right then, Joey.

327
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,122
I'II do what I can.

328
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,295
Lesson number one:

329
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,364
AIways be on your guard.

330
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,597
AIways be on my guard. AII right.
You the ninja.

331
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:53,862
On my guard.

332
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,839
Lesson number two:

333
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,979
Your foe's back can
quickIy become his front.

334
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,340
And Iesson 34:

335
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,982
The finaI technique for
ripping a man's head off...

336
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,049
...is by simpIy using your bare hands.

337
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,187
This requires hard work
and discipIine...

338
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,253
...years, sometimes decades,
to achieve.

339
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,085
I suggest that
you practice on chickens.

340
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,359
Chickens?

341
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,029
Ninja secret. Chickens.

342
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:23,157
Here is what I was Iooking for,
Joey, my young friend.

343
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,131
A BeverIy HiIIs disguise.

344
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,237
Something simpIe and naturaI...

345
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,704
...yet subtIe and cunning.

346
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,137
You wait here.

347
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,011
I got your back.

348
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,049
You Iook Iike a pimp.

349
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,390
Thank you.

350
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:50,784
And as a pimp, I'II bIend into
BeverIy HiIIs Iike MSG into miso soup.

351
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,996
It's time for me to find my dove.

352
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,460
And how do we do that?

353
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,896
She's rich, she's beautifuI,
she's bIonde.

354
00:28:57,268 --> 00:29:00,135
How many rich, beautifuI bIondes
couId there be here?

355
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,499
NaturaI bIondes?
I'm in. Let's do it.

356
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:06,268
No, Joey. We are entering
a dangerous phase of our mission.

357
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,810
Any misstep couId put
SaIIy's Iife in jeopardy.

358
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,743
So what are you saying?
I can't go with you?

359
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:13,982
SaIIy?

360
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,517
Oh, my gosh!
Get away from me, you creep!

361
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,684
I thought we was homies.
I thought you was my boy, my ninja.

362
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:25,192
-I thought we was Iike this.
-A ninja master knows best.

363
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:28,627
You're breaking ruIe number one,
questioning my authority.

364
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:32,792
You're right. You got it.
If you need me, I'II be at the hoteI.

365
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,029
Okay, Joey. Good work today.

366
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:37,805
SaIIy?

367
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,383
SaIIy Jones!

368
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,347
I mistook you for a friend of mine.

369
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,819
You Iook so much Iike her.
I mean, him.

370
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,584
Up cIose, you don't Iook Iike
either of them.

371
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,325
They are twins.

372
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,892
And they....

373
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,529
This is nice.

374
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,924
Excuse me, I have to be going.

375
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,260
Thank you.

376
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,953
SaIIy! SaIIy Jones!

377
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,487
It is I, Haru!

378
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,191
What are you doing here?

379
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:02,916
You said you needed a ninja.

380
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:06,688
I've come many miIes and now traveI
disguised as a pimp to heIp you.

381
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,527
Just go away.

382
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,573
I've come to rescue you.

383
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:22,302
I don't need to be rescued.
Just Ieave.

384
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,774
I see. Very smart.

385
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,784
For now, it is better that you
not Iet them know I am here.

386
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,115
Here, take this.

387
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,315
I'm sorry to teII you this...

388
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,518
...but your boyfriend is
a counterfeiter and a kiIIer.

389
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:42,262
A man Iike that, you can be
sure he's cheating on you too.

390
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:45,834
Do not despair, SaIIy Jones.
I wiII be ever-vigiIant.

391
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,164
I wiII be watching your every move...

392
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,068
...making sure that as the--

393
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,436
Do not be afraid, my dove.

394
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,710
I wiII be watching you.

395
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,880
There you are.

396
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,084
Now we wiII see who is the hunter...

397
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:13,287
...and who is the prey, Martin TanIey.

398
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:28,338
Martin TanIey, you have Ieft a traiI
a sIoth couId foIIow.

399
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,522
Thanks for meeting us, Mr. Ozaru.

400
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,424
It's in our interest
to resoIve our differences.

401
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,459
We're in perfect agreement.

402
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,363
Cut the buIIshit.
What do you want for your pIates?

403
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,162
I think you have it backwards.

404
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:58,274
It is the <i>K</i>obudosai
who are going to buy your pIates.

405
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,637
Do you honestIy think
you can waItz in...

406
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,143
...grab the pIates and try
and run the show?

407
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:06,545
You don't have a choice,
Mr. TanIey.

408
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,789
I wiII know. I wiII do.

409
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,960
I am one with the universe.

410
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,900
HoIy Shinto!

411
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,532
I am one with the universe.

412
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,410
No, I am not...

413
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:45,689
...one with the universe!

414
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,287
Let's discuss...

415
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:53,089
...how much we're going to give you...

416
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:54,954
...for your pIates.

417
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,119
Get out!

418
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,670
HoIy Shinto!

419
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:17,813
HeIp! PoIice!

420
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,477
No! No!

421
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:21,845
I did not do it!

422
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:35,523
This is the site of a gangIand murder
Iast night in LittIe Tokyo.

423
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,964
Witnesses say the assaiIant
had matching tattoos on his arms...

424
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,661
...and may be
what is called a ninja.

425
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,874
He matches an lnterpol description...

426
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,238
...of a man wanted
in Japan for murder.

427
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,807
Come to papa, baby!

428
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,849
Keep practicing, Joey...

429
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,325
...and someday you wiII
choke that chicken.

430
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:02,925
For Pete's sake.

431
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:06,426
Who is sIoppy and messing up?

432
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,558
Getting in the way aII the time.

433
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,435
Sensei.

434
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,504
<i>M</i>editate on me, Haru...

435
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,801
...and we<i>'</i>ll meet on
the <i>P</i>lane of <i>E</i>nlightenment.

436
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,745
HeIp!
I must concentrate!

437
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,480
-I am one with the universe!
-Here, Haru!

438
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,488
I am here.

439
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:36,985
I hate this!

440
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,792
Thank you, sensei.

441
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,696
HeIIo, my son.

442
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:47,893
HeIIo, sensei.

443
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,198
There's a probIem you are facing.

444
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,872
Not reaIIy.

445
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:56,342
It's just that I have been accused
of another murder...

446
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,775
...or two.

447
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,244
Come home, Haru.

448
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,042
I cannot, sensei.

449
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,013
I need your heIp
in finding SaIIy Jones.

450
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,713
I have considered severaI techniques.

451
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:10,291
I couId find the names of aII
BMW saIes in the Iast five years...

452
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:14,521
...checking on aII the Joneses,
then visiting them aII. Or--

453
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,964
You couId try a phone book.

454
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,666
A phone book.

455
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,238
Then resume your quest.

456
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,137
I wiII, sensei.

457
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:14,183
You thought, perhaps,
an experienced ninja...

458
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,019
...wouId not be ready for you.

459
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:25,130
I am Haru of the Takagure dojo.
Do not forget that.

460
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,305
I am one with the universe!

461
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:02,097
I am Haru of the Takagure....

462
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,374
AIison.

463
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:18,522
HeIIo, AIison.

464
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,321
-Did Martin say when he'd be back?
-He didn't.

465
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,389
That's strange.

466
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,719
We have some business
to go over.

467
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:31,334
It appears SaIIy's using her
faIse name with these peopIe as weII.

468
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,003
Very cIever, SaIIy.

469
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,833
You reaIIy shouId be a ninja.

470
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,410
Something's wrong.

471
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:50,951
It seems as though I am the onIy one
who is caIIing her SaIIy Jones.

472
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,158
How couId she do this to me?

473
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:48,061
Do not move, AIison...AIison Page!

474
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:51,435
You have to get out of here.
The guards couId kiII us both.

475
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,509
You are a Iiar, SaIIy...
SaIIy Jones!

476
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:57,681
I'm sorry that I gave you
a faIse name.

477
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:01,181
I onIy did it so TanIey
wouIdn't discover that I hired you.

478
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,452
Your Iies bounce off me
Iike Ping-Pong baIIs.

479
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,089
I am not Iying to you, Haru.

480
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,690
In fact, I have you to thank
for heIping me.

481
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,953
You found out what I needed to know.

482
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,521
-I did?
-Yes.

483
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:15,932
Look.

484
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,563
My sister CarIa
worked for TanIey.

485
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,930
Three months ago,
she died mysteriousIy.

486
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:25,268
I suspected TanIey, but I couIdn't
prove anything untiI you came aIong.

487
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,206
But you're his girIfriend.
You're in Iove with him.

488
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,311
I onIy got invoIved with him
to find out what happened to CarIa.

489
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,382
He doesn't know I'm her sister!

490
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,086
I cannot teII the truth
from the untruth.

491
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,319
There's no time!

492
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,896
If I find the pIates, I can
put him away. You must beIieve me!

493
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,597
I do beIieve you.

494
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,962
I have never stopped beIieving in you.

495
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,501
You are not aIone.

496
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,605
Great White Ninja is on your case.

497
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,341
Thank you, Haru.

498
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,649
Quick! Bedroom, bedroom!

499
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,849
Go! Go!

500
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:16,756
What are you doing?

501
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:20,192
I was Iooking for you.
I thought I'd make Iunch for you.

502
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:23,127
I'm Iate.
I have a meeting I have to get to.

503
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:24,164
Wait!

504
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:48,522
Let me take you to
your favorite restaurant.

505
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,695
I can't. Not today.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

506
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,833
HopefuIIy, I'II see you Iater.

507
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,897
Why don't you caII a friend?

508
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,663
Have a IoveIy afternoon.

509
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:07,037
Since I can't be with you,
take them out to Iunch instead.

510
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,012
Have a great meeting. Bye!

511
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,716
Good job!

512
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:22,892
Thank you.

513
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:26,585
I don't know what to do.
I can't find those pIates anywhere.

514
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,492
Do not be disheartened.

515
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,064
I know TanIey's next move.

516
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:34,902
I have discovered his scheduIe...

517
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,572
...in this date book.

518
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,673
That's great.

519
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:01,984
Shrimp? Shrimp?

520
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,235
I gotcha!

521
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,645
Look at this!

522
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:34,349
Word is out that what happened
at the Neon CIub couId start a war.

523
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,287
If they want a war, they'II have one.

524
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:39,860
Do not underestimate the <i>K</i>obudosai.
They are ruthIess.

525
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,894
We're not exactIy kittens.

526
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:10,193
This ink speciaIist, have you met him?

527
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,488
Chet WaIters. I'm toId
he's the best in the business.

528
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:18,259
Good. I want him to print
the front haIf of the biII tomorrow.

529
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:20,060
I want no compIications.

530
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,364
What do you know about this ninja
the poIice think kiIIed Ozura...

531
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,064
...and the other <i>K</i>obudosai?

532
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:27,573
We're Iucky the poIice
have another suspect.

533
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:30,770
And a white ninja.
Who ever heard of a white ninja?

534
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,285
TanIey's at the first tabIe
on the right.

535
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,039
PIease don't!

536
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:16,483
Do you know how Iong it took me
to do my hair?

537
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,184
Hurry, my dove!

538
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,655
What the heII is she doing here?

539
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:07,036
-I've Iearned how to get to the pIates.
-You have?

540
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:08,575
That's great.

541
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:12,174
Hurry. They're coming.

542
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,976
Don't be afraid.
A ninja knows when he's in danger.

543
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,709
There they are! Shoot them!

544
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:22,648
Now we are in danger.
We are reaIIy in danger!

545
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,664
I'm one with the chicken.

546
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,806
Keep practicing, Joey.

547
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:45,940
Where...?

548
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:54,089
Thank you for Ietting me
stay here, Haru.

549
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,088
It is my pIeasure, AIison.

550
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:59,194
Besides, there is no pIace
for you to go.

551
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:02,456
You must stay here. TanIey wiII be
watching your every move.

552
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:05,063
EspeciaIIy your apartment.

553
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:10,796
You need not worry. I wiII
protect you with aII of my being.

554
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,971
I'm so Iucky I found you.

555
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,243
You reaIIy are courageous.

556
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:23,079
If onIy I had caught TanIey in Japan.

557
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:27,551
Today, you wouId be basking in the
safety of our dojo, after a bath...

558
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:31,592
...where I wouId bring you
soap and sweet-smeIIing oiIs...

559
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:34,787
...that you couId rub
aII over your body.

560
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:36,022
And then--

561
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:40,630
I am sorry. I got carried away.

562
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:42,661
It's okay.

563
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:45,669
Your IoyaIty is most appreciated.

564
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:50,379
WeII, I guess it's time to turn in.

565
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:52,643
Do you want the bed or the couch?

566
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,246
Which wouId you prefer?

567
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,251
Couch is fine for me.

568
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,479
Oh, that wouId be fine for me too.

569
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:08,923
Good night.

570
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:10,129
Good night.

571
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,616
Do not worry. He is simpIy
an ink speciaIist.

572
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,085
He wiII suspect nothing.

573
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:36,291
As we taIked about,
you'II distract him...

574
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:38,825
...and I'II use the ninja sIeephoId...

575
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,627
...to incapacitate him.
Are you ready?

576
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,265
Yeah, Iet's go.

577
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,101
How you doing?
WeIcome to BeverIy HiIIs Bank Note.

578
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:55,039
I'm Chet WaIters. Nice coat.
Who shot the couch?

579
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,580
I'm just kidding.

580
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,873
What can I do you for?

581
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:02,347
Our car broke down.
WouId you mind if I used your phone?

582
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:04,918
Oh, don't get me started
on car probIems.

583
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,885
I got a 1 975 Fairmont.

584
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:11,026
That thing's about as hard
to turn over as me on Laguna Beach.

585
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:16,154
I'm just bugging with you.

586
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:18,561
Auto CIub number is 555-9300.

587
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:19,894
Thank you.

588
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:22,899
Yep, the AAA.

589
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:27,934
You know, I knew a guy who started off
in AAA, then ended up in AA.

590
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,840
He got busted for DUI.

591
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,748
HeIIo, is this the Auto CIub?

592
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,478
What are you doing?

593
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:38,085
Are you not famiIiar with
the art of shiatsu massage?

594
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:41,451
Shiatsu? Watch your Ianguage.
There's a Iady present.

595
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,651
When I was pIaying baII
in Wisconsin...

596
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:47,853
...these two cheerIeaders
Iathered me up Iike a whaIe--

597
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:50,660
Get off me!

598
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:53,199
I'm caIIing the cops.
Give me the phone!

599
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:02,408
Not a ninja technique,
but effective.

600
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:03,874
Let's get him in the back.

601
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:09,609
What are you doing?

602
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:13,812
I am preparing one of our greatest
ninja tooIs, the Iaughing mushroom.

603
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,185
One pinch and he can't heIp
but teII the truth...

604
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,156
...about his business with TanIey.

605
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,555
CarefuI, AIison.

606
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:23,255
The effects of a tiny spore
are profound. Open his mouth.

607
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:37,871
I'm invoIved in
counterfeiting some money!

608
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:39,947
Big deaI!

609
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,081
If I get caught...

610
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,412
...I couId do 30 years.

611
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,589
TanIey is a kiIIer!

612
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,697
He kiIIed her sister.

613
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,796
When he's done,
he'II probabIy kiII you!

614
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,932
When are you to meet him?

615
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:06,802
Ten minutes.

616
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,274
And if you're here when he gets here,
he'II probabIy kiII aII of us!

617
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:36,837
I don't think we shouId.

618
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,133
I'm sorry. I was....

619
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:41,533
I wasn't trying to....

620
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,235
I was mereIy trying to get...

621
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,639
...cIose to the tempIe, not inside.

622
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:51,487
I just wanted to cIimb the steps...

623
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,850
...and maybe peek at the sacred object.

624
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:10,038
Hey, how you doing?
Chet WaIters. Mr. TanIey?

625
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,834
Say, nice jacket.
Who shot the couch?

626
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,807
Very funny, Mr. WaIters.
Are you ready to go?

627
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:18,344
You bet! Say, your buggy or mine?

628
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,209
Mine, I think.

629
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,718
Gotta get the gear here.

630
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,753
Can't start an operation
without the gear.

631
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:29,720
And here we are,
off to the wiId bIue yonder.

632
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:32,394
You don't mind, do you?
A smaII precaution.

633
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:35,029
No, if it makes
you feeI more comfortabIe.

634
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:38,166
I just want to know,
how wiII you drive with that on?

635
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,427
-It's for you.
-Of course it is.

636
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:44,596
Let's pIay Pin the TaiI on the Donkey!
Who's got the pinata?

637
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:49,002
Hear about a Iady who backed into a van?
Made a disaster. Dis-assed-her!

638
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:51,009
-I don't care.
-Okay, you bet.

639
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:55,014
Gotcha. You betcha.
AIrighty. Here we go!

640
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:00,179
TanIey, you pick up guys
and do this aII the time?

641
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,125
Who's driving this buggy, anyhow?

642
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:08,820
Let me guess. Don't teII me.
Don't teII me.

643
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,465
CaroI Channing.

644
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:19,798
Mind if I borrow this next week?
I got a bIind date. A bIind date!

645
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:26,006
Which way is he taking us?
Through the Grand Canyon?

646
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:30,585
Where did he Iearn to drive?
Cooking schooI?

647
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,826
Thank God we made it!

648
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,094
Okay, Iet's take the bIindfoId off.

649
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,292
That's what she said. She said!

650
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:50,130
Don't you think I ought to
do the work before you pay me?

651
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,832
This is the reaI biII. Print a
proof copy by the end of the day.

652
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,704
I want it exactIy Iike this.

653
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,972
Right. No probIem.
HoId the phone a second.

654
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,745
OId FaithfuI!

655
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,417
End of the day?
You don't want it sooner?

656
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:14,324
They don't caII me the best
for nothing, you know.

657
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:29,542
I'm standing there in a thong Speedo,
hiking boots and a backpack.

658
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:33,312
You try catching a ride
on 83rd Avenue, dressed Iike that...

659
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:35,507
...in the middIe of winter.

660
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:38,083
What happened?

661
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,353
A bug must've bit me.

662
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:45,589
I got a brother in pest controI.
BIindfoId him...

663
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:49,731
...bring him over. He'II nuke every
cockroach and mosquito in this dump.

664
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:52,629
CouId we pIease get to work?

665
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,004
Hey, I see you got...

666
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:59,437
...the T-200 spIit-IeveI Barber ink
printing press.

667
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:03,404
These came out when I was printing
for the ''Shave the WhaIe'' campaign.

668
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,741
-You mean ''Save the WhaIe.''
-Is that what you did with them?

669
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:08,650
Nobu, keep an eye on him.

670
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:12,185
Maybe it was ''Starve the WhaIes''!
''Starve the WhaIes.''

671
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:21,593
Let's see what we got
baking in the oven.

672
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:31,972
Not yet a match.

673
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:39,244
It Iooks Iike we are
one degree CeIsius off...

674
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,713
...on that magenta coIor.

675
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,681
I guess I'm going to have to...

676
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,980
...quantify the 7-F reading on this...

677
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:50,717
...and that wouId run it through
with the surface-gravity viscosity.

678
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:55,523
I couId pIug it into
the MarshaII formuIa, and that wouId...

679
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:57,825
...that wouId give me
an accurate mix design.

680
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,127
To me, they're just a IittIe bit off.

681
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:03,499
What I couId do on that is run
a pap smear test...

682
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:06,334
...and then tone it down a IittIe bit.

683
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,979
-HeIIo, Mr. TanIey.
-What the heII is that?

684
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,045
You can see what I'm up against.

685
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:15,012
I've got to rethink my inks.

686
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,810
So...

687
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:21,252
...what I couId do is
I couId swing back to my shop...

688
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:23,789
...and be gone not more than
five minutes.

689
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,359
You couId bIindfoId me if you'd Iike.
I Iiked that anyway.

690
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:32,626
How'd that get in there?

691
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:33,665
Who are you?

692
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,701
Chet WaIters, ink speciaIist.

693
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,401
I am Haru of the Takagure dojo...

694
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:45,445
...and if you vaIue your Iife,
you wiII....

695
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,247
Come on, Iet's get him!

696
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,178
Open this door!

697
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:53,855
Let us out of here!

698
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:58,525
Haru, you are truIy
the Great White Ninja.

699
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,657
Did I say ninja?

700
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,061
I meant ninny.

701
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:09,062
''Haru, you are such a ninny.''

702
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,705
So what did you do with WaIters?

703
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:51,311
You may subject me to any torture
you can think of...

704
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,914
...but a ninja does not taIk.

705
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,881
Ninja? You're a ninja?

706
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,617
You're the big, fat ninja
everyone's taIking about.

707
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,552
Great White Ninja.

708
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:06,387
The meeting with the <i>K</i>obudosai
is arranged.

709
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:09,326
Good. Tie him up
and throw him in the van.

710
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,193
We'II get rid of him Iater.

711
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,249
You'II have to check your guns.
<i>K</i>obudosai checked theirs.

712
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:51,731
My dove!

713
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:54,607
Are you aII right?

714
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,469
I am fine.

715
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,040
Let me get this bIindfoId off.

716
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:06,481
It is in the spirit of harmony
we meet here today.

717
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:10,819
It is important to our community
an agreement be reached.

718
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,325
Stop squirming!
I've got to get these ropes undone.

719
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:16,793
The ninja way is to visuaIize
the straightness of the rope.

720
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:19,593
It wiII begin to untie itseIf.

721
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,995
Or a knife is good.

722
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:27,603
My suggestion is that you aIIow us
to make your pIates our pIates.

723
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:29,973
Honored eIder?

724
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:33,979
You know I have great respect
for you, Kumagi...

725
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:37,016
...but I ruIe in favor of Mr. TanIey.

726
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,051
You won't get away with this!

727
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,286
Yes, I wiII.

728
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:48,224
I'II make these criminaIs face
the American justice system.

729
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,523
Be carefuI.

730
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:09,177
Where's the ninja gone?

731
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,511
I don't know.

732
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:12,081
Never mind. Let's go.

733
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,920
That's right.
The LittIe Tokyo TempIe.

734
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:16,685
Wait. Stop the van.

735
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:18,292
Stop the van!

736
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:25,530
What a coincidence meeting you here.
AIIow me to give you a Iift.

737
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:33,808
HeIp me!

738
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:50,919
You! Hands in the air!

739
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:52,257
It's him!

740
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:53,393
The white ninja!

741
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:56,087
Do not shoot!
I am on your side.

742
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:00,933
Come on, Iet's get him!

743
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,767
Come on over here.

744
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:10,211
Get out of here!

745
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:11,243
I got him!

746
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:16,178
Open the door.

747
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:18,046
Keep his head down.

748
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,883
AIison, what have I done?

749
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:04,524
He's an idiot!
I cannot do this anymore.

750
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,601
I had to escape from jaiI!
I am coming home.

751
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:10,203
-Do not be rash, Gobei.
-Rash?

752
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:13,136
He has made every mistake
in the ninja book.

753
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:14,434
He is coming.

754
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,805
Hide behind those cIouds.

755
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,604
I hate this!

756
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:27,345
-HeIIo, Haru.
-HeIIo, sensei.

757
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:30,848
How are you, my son?

758
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,994
I have tried, but I have faiIed.

759
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:35,686
That is never true.

760
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:40,130
I want so desperateIy to be
a great ninja Iike Gobei, but--

761
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:43,237
You must stop comparing
yourseIf to Gobei.

762
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:47,068
Why, sensei?
He is the best ninja ever.

763
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:51,469
I hope that he knows that I Iove him.
AII I've ever wanted...

764
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:52,773
...was his respect.

765
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:54,040
My son...

766
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,811
...we wouId aII be Iucky
to have a heart as big as yours.

767
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,181
In fact, Gobei wiII not become...

768
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:04,155
...a great ninja,
untiI he Iearns that Iesson.

769
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:08,262
I tried to stop this mission
because I feared for you.

770
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:10,260
But I was wrong.

771
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:11,990
You must continue.

772
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:14,031
-I must?
-Yes.

773
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:18,866
Go. Save AIison.
It is your duty as a ninja.

774
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,769
You just caIIed me a ninja.

775
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,106
Yes, I guess I did.

776
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,177
Go now.

777
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,583
Sorry. I can do it.

778
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:20,129
Patrice, my car, pIease.
Joey, you're coming with me.

779
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,172
Who is steaIing my shoes?

780
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:30,673
-There's no time to waste.
-I'm with you.

781
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,448
-Thanks, asshoIe.
-My pIeasure, sir.

782
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:43,321
-What are we doing?
-Using my perfect ninja sense memory...

783
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:46,962
...I wiII recreate the trip
to TanIey's warehouse.

784
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:48,928
Drive, Joey.

785
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:51,895
Phat! I get to drive?
AII right. Come on.

786
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:54,160
We going Iike Morgan Freeman.

787
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:56,361
Now turn right.

788
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:02,736
There was a bump. This is good.
There was a right after a bump.

789
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:04,139
A right after the bump.

790
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:08,946
Take off the bIindfoId!

791
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:10,584
What's wrong with you?

792
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:14,779
I know just where we are.
We are on the right track, Joey.

793
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,015
We're on the track, aII right!

794
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:28,565
I do not remember hearing thunder.

795
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:32,564
There's got to be a turn somewhere!

796
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,369
-Turn right, now!
-I'm turning!

797
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:42,143
This is good. I hear water.
Now turn right.

798
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,414
Now Ieft, towards the water. Yes!

799
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,216
I think we're too cIose to the water.

800
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:52,257
I think we shouId go back.

801
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,554
-You Ied us astray.
-I didn't!

802
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,955
I cannot swim! Joey!

803
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,998
We're drifting!
Something's touching my face!

804
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:04,135
Joey, these sea creatures!

805
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,432
HeIp me!

806
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,399
Head towards the mainIand!

807
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,868
MainIand?

808
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:11,842
Yes, the mainIand!
The sea is foamy.

809
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,674
You have wandered way off-course!

810
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:20,447
The weather in America
fIuctuates vioIentIy.

811
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,990
Maybe we shouId go for cover.

812
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:26,791
Joey, what is that smeII?

813
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:28,721
Pina coIada.

814
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:30,421
I Iike it.

815
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:34,826
-You must Iisten to my directions.
-I'm going where you said!

816
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:37,335
If you cannot, I wiII have to drive.

817
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,300
-You must Iisten at aII times.
-I'm sorry.

818
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:44,946
We must try it again.

819
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:48,742
And this time, Joey, you must
foIIow my directions exactIy.

820
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:50,713
Okay, no probIem.

821
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,480
-I'm ready.
-Everybody in my famiIy Iikes to drive--

822
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,281
You may drive now.

823
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,352
You may drive now.

824
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,462
Consider yourseIf very Iucky.

825
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:08,865
You've Iived 24 hours Ionger than
anyone who's betrayed me.

826
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:11,539
So I brought you this present.
A IittIe bang.

827
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:14,607
Don't worry. You'II vaporize
before you feeI a thing.

828
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:17,108
I wish I'd kiIIed you months ago.

829
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:20,646
The feeIing's mutuaI.
The difference is...

830
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,646
...I'm abIe to rectify my mistake.

831
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,623
Somebody heIp me!

832
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:33,989
Joey, do not Iet up. We are
nowhere near our destination.

833
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:37,563
Take a Ieft. Joey!

834
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,927
Why are we stopping here?

835
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:47,774
So we have entered
the serpent's Iair.

836
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,549
You are a fragiIe boy.

837
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,606
Thank God I have a short sword.

838
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:08,248
Yeah!

839
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,474
Yeah, you go, ninja boy!

840
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:42,113
Yeah! Mr. <i>D</i>ojo Rising!
Go for it!

841
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:16,657
I made it.

842
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:19,384
WeII, if it isn't
the Great White Ninja.

843
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:22,496
WeIcome back. CongratuIations on
making it this far...

844
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:25,826
...but I'm afraid this is where
your Iegend ends.

845
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:32,339
OnIy when I have ceased to breathe
wiII I be dead.

846
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:34,773
Get rid of him.

847
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:07,504
-What are you doing here?
-I come to heIp you, brother.

848
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:12,244
This has aIways been my dream.
Let us kick some yaku<i>z</i>a ass!

849
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:43,669
That's right. I can cIimb.
I can cIimb!

850
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:51,050
So sorry, Gobei.

851
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:56,281
Don't you think
you shouId go save AIison?

852
01:14:58,093 --> 01:14:59,754
But can you manage without me?

853
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:01,156
I wiII try.

854
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:15,834
Somebody heIp me!

855
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:19,437
AIison, is that you?

856
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:21,513
Yes! HeIp me!

857
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:22,775
AII right!

858
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:24,277
Hurry!

859
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:26,044
PIease hurry!

860
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:31,518
Stop!

861
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,298
Can you come any cIoser?
I wiII untie you.

862
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:43,596
There's no time.
There's a bomb in here.

863
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:45,437
AIison, have no fear.

864
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,074
I wiII defuse the bomb.

865
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:55,381
I can see now.

866
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:57,545
It is simpIe.

867
01:15:57,753 --> 01:15:59,277
Do you know what you're doing?

868
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:02,314
There, I have done it!

869
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:05,252
<i>Y</i>our call cannot be completed
as dialed.

870
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:08,088
<i>P</i>lease check the number
and dial again.

871
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:17,968
Oh, great.

872
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:19,697
We've just Iost five minutes.

873
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,540
Brother!

874
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:31,713
My dove, hang on!

875
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:37,989
How much time is Ieft?

876
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:40,319
Four minutes.

877
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:44,861
Do not worry.

878
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:46,557
I wiII return.

879
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:03,873
I may not be the best ninja.
I may not be one with the universe.

880
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:05,246
But I'II teII you this:

881
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:08,888
No one messes with my brother!

882
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:30,504
Go! Yeah!

883
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:35,346
Look out!

884
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:41,353
So sorry.

885
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:47,694
Here I come!

886
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:52,897
Are you aII right, my brother?

887
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:54,395
Yes, Haru.

888
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:16,648
NiceIy done, Joey.

889
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,522
Hurry!

890
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:06,335
Martin TanIey.

891
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,181
I'm over here.

892
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,811
So now you are out of buIIets.

893
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:23,948
Look out!

894
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,899
Come on!

895
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:13,775
Do not worry.

896
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,375
Forty seconds.

897
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:28,121
Get out of there, you!

898
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:32,590
Thirty seconds!

899
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:34,726
Hang in there, my dove.

900
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:37,763
In a few moments, you wiII be
as free as a bird.

901
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:27,442
Are we dead?

902
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:30,377
You did it.

903
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:33,082
-I did?
-Yes.

904
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:35,518
Thank you, Haru.
Thank you.

905
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,022
I cannot say this has been
an easy mission.

906
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:43,160
You are, without a doubt,
the greatest ninja of aII time.

907
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:46,562
BeIieve it or not, there were times
when I doubted myseIf.

908
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:52,235
What a fooI I was.

909
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:00,073
Thanks, big brother.
It'II be aII right.

910
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:03,149
-You did good.
-Thank you, big brother.

911
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:07,014
Sorry about your head.
I was going for TanIey.

912
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:09,280
Reports here are that
a group of ninjas...

913
01:22:09,491 --> 01:22:11,982
...foiIed an attempted
counterfeiting operation.

914
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:14,718
I am Iive with
one of those ninjas now.

915
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,923
This may be an odd question, but I
thought that ninjas were Japanese...

916
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:21,295
...and you seem to be bIack.

917
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:24,063
Do not be fooIed
by the coIor of my skin.

918
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:25,671
You're a TV reporter.

919
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:28,365
You've heard the Iegend
of the Great BIack Ninja.

920
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:30,567
I haven't. Is that you?

921
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:33,037
Some say it is so.

922
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:42,217
You have done weII, Haru.
I am proud.

923
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:45,620
Whether I am or am not
the Great White Ninja...

924
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:47,556
...you made me beIieve in myseIf.

925
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:51,129
Though it wiII sadden me
to see you Ieave...

926
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:53,357
...I am happy for you.

927
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,593
I reaIize that I wiII be
of better use...

928
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,999
...where they don't have many
great ninjas.

929
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:01,300
I wiII return with my dove
to the Iand of opportunity...

930
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:02,601
...BeverIy HiIIs.

931
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:10,483
Whether you're
the chosen one or not...

932
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:12,846
...I'd choose to fight
aIongside you anytime.

933
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:16,417
Here.

934
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:20,818
Good Iuck, my brother.

935
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:25,723
My arm!
It's okay.

936
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:31,768
AIison and I must Ieave.

937
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:34,337
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye!

938
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:40,508
It's amazing.

939
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:42,546
I think he's reaIIy changed.

940
01:23:52,827 --> 01:23:53,953
Stop!

941
01:23:57,132 --> 01:23:59,896
Stop! Are you Iistening--?
