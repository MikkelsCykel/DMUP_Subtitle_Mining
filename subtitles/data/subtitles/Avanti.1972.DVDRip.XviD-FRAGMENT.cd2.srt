00:00:01,714 --> 00:00:03,648
If you'll just
give me a minute...

2
00:00:03,682 --> 00:00:05,809
I'm sure I could find us
a couple of bathing suits.

3
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:07,182
But why bother?

4
00:00:08,587 --> 00:00:11,647
I don't want you to think
that I'm stuffy or uptight.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,681
I'm considered
a pretty groovy catch.

6
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:15,318
You know, tuned in.

7
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:17,795
Like when I'm on business
in Los Angeles...

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,856
I always have lunch
at a topless... place.

9
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:24,832
Just because I don't have
the long sideburns...

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,838
that doesn't mean that...

11
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:28,567
Did you ever hear
of "Old Calcutta"?

12
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:33,010
I've seen it twice,
and "Carnal Knowledge," too.

13
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:34,410
Yeah, the permissive society...

14
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:36,437
age of Aquarius,
sexual revolution...

15
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:38,643
I'm into all of that.

16
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:40,675
Take the secretaries
in our home office...

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,653
always wearing
those hot pants.

18
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:44,178
There's nothing
wrong with that...

19
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:48,023
just as long as they're worn
by consenting adults.

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,120
Please keep in mind
that it's Sunday...

21
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:52,790
and this is
a Catholic country...

22
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:55,698
and they may think
it's in very poor taste.

23
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:04,934
Can you hear me?

24
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:21,583
Oh, my God.

25
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:03,094
Are you all right?

26
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:05,790
I'm fantastic.

27
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:07,799
I'll give you one minute
to catch your breath.

28
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,425
Then we're gonna swim back.

29
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:11,265
What's the rush?

30
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:14,898
No rush. Just a little cold
in here in the water.

31
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,738
Nice and warm here,
just lying in the sun...

32
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:19,801
with your eyes closed.

33
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:21,813
Yeah? Are your eyes closed?

34
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:22,939
Why?

35
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:26,348
Nothing. Just asking.

36
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:45,796
Here we are...

37
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:48,931
basking like two baby seals.

38
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,914
Wonder what they talked
about... Willie and Kate.

39
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:01,283
I'm sure they didn't
talk at all.

40
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,185
They would just listen.

41
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:05,213
To the wind and the waves...

42
00:04:05,257 --> 00:04:08,954
and the beat, beat, beat
of their foolish hearts.

43
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:10,791
Why not?

44
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:13,297
When you're in love,
you don't need words.

45
00:04:13,332 --> 00:04:18,133
A look, a touch, a sigh...
you've said it all.

46
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:23,373
That's not bad.
I should try that on my wife.

47
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:25,308
Every time I come home
from work completely pooped...

48
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:29,007
she always wants to know
why I don't talk to her.

49
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:34,977
Do you and Bertram...

50
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,885
Do you communicate much?

51
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:38,617
We haven't talked
for six months.

52
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:42,218
Beautiful.
You must really dig each other.

53
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,626
The fact of the matter is...

54
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:46,324
we haven't seen each other
for six months.

55
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:48,356
The bastard walked out on me...

56
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,527
stole my telly,
two Picasso posters...

57
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,503
and my hairdryer.

58
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:54,528
There's an apostle for you.

59
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:58,566
Moved in with some
skinny girl in Kensington.

60
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,339
When I found out,
would you believe...

61
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:02,176
I tried to commit suicide?

62
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:04,512
- No.
- Yes.

63
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:06,107
I took my week's salary...

64
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:08,244
bought myself a suitcase
full of fish and chips...

65
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,118
and a dozen bottles
of Guinness stout...

66
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:12,282
and tried to
eat myself to death.

67
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:14,519
Took them hours
to pump my stomach out.

68
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:16,789
Was it worth it
for a guy like that?

69
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:20,286
It was stupid,
but I've learned my lesson.

70
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:21,390
Good.

71
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:23,424
No more fish and chips.

72
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,034
I guess there is something...

73
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:31,235
to what it says
in the tourist guide.

74
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:33,608
What does it say?

75
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:36,773
It says,
"ltaly is not a country.

76
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:38,339
"It's an emotion."

77
00:05:38,383 --> 00:05:41,147
It's certainly been
an experience.

78
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:52,692
I'm afraid we have
some sightseers.

79
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:16,148
Please. Where's
your British reserve?

80
00:06:26,398 --> 00:06:27,797
Here.

81
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,494
Maybe you can use these.

82
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:16,670
That was quite
the loveliest night of my life.

83
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:18,080
Thank you.

84
00:07:18,116 --> 00:07:20,812
You're entirely welcome.
See you around.

85
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:58,349
What's up?

86
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,324
It's an emergency.
The Baron Forshmetelli's suite.

87
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:02,121
I hope it's not a heart attack.

88
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,525
That old crock,
I wouldn't be surprised.

89
00:08:03,562 --> 00:08:07,464
No, it's not the baron.
It's one of the nurses.

90
00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:34,181
Good night, Willie.

91
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:37,721
Good night, Kate.

92
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:22,039
Good morning, sir.
Are you all right?

93
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:23,097
What?

94
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:24,574
Because they told me,
at seven this morning...

95
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:26,270
you asked for
two bottles of aspirin.

96
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:28,506
Oh, that.
I just needed the cotton.

97
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,515
Damn bells. You talk
about noise pollution.

98
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:34,110
There are 68 churches in Ischia.
They all want the business.

99
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:35,483
How's that nurse?
She all right?

100
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,044
Yes. Just a slipped disk.

101
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:39,818
The three of them,
they were playing frogleap.

102
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:41,291
The word is leapfrog.

103
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:43,556
I would rather not know.

104
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:44,994
I have come to give
a progress report.

105
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,225
- How we doing?
- We are making progress.

106
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:49,130
I have met with
the Trotta brothers.

107
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,634
I gave them German marks.

108
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:52,296
The bodies are back
in the morgue.

109
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:53,304
Good.

110
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:54,805
The doctor from Capri
has examined them.

111
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,204
I have the health
certificates right here.

112
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:57,299
What about the coffins?

113
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:59,936
They arrived this morning,
all three of them.

114
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:01,104
Three?

115
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:03,307
The two from Bologna
and that first one...

116
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:06,010
that I ordered
from Amalfi, remember?

117
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:07,985
There is no refund,
no exchange.

118
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:11,045
No big deal.
Make a lamp out of it.

119
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:12,420
About my nephew.

120
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:13,924
He got to Naples,
and his friend...

121
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,483
let him into
the license bureau...

122
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:16,960
even though
it's closed on Sunday...

123
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:18,326
and he got
the export license.

124
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:19,660
Then we're all set.

125
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:22,667
Yes and no,
because this nephew...

126
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:24,726
he gets tickets
for speeding all the time...

127
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:26,236
and while he was
in that empty building...

128
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:27,568
he got to the file...

129
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:30,006
and he removed ten
of his traffic citations...

130
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,474
and now he's in jail.

131
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:32,942
What about the export license?

132
00:10:32,978 --> 00:10:34,343
They're holding that
as evidence.

133
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:35,573
But not to worry.

134
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:37,741
When the court opens
in the morning...

135
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:39,044
I have a cousin
who is a lawyer.

136
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:41,052
I will get to him straightaway.

137
00:10:41,086 --> 00:10:43,281
He is the worst lawyer
in Naples...

138
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:44,845
but fortunately,
he and the judge...

139
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,322
they have the same mistress.

140
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:50,089
Is that what you call
Italian justice?

141
00:10:50,128 --> 00:10:53,586
What about Sacco and Vanzetti?

142
00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:13,008
When are you people
going to learn...

143
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:14,511
how to make
a decent cup of coffee?

144
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:16,571
You know what I had
for breakfast?

145
00:12:16,614 --> 00:12:18,514
Hot Pepsi-Cola.

146
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,575
- What's that?
- Your shorts.

147
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:22,381
They washed up on the beach.

148
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,854
My shorts? What makes you think
they're my shorts?

149
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:26,015
Maybe I am wrong.

150
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:28,252
Maybe they belong
to the young lady.

151
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:30,022
Just put them down, will you?

152
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:33,694
About those photographs
I mentioned...

153
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:35,825
your father and his friend.

154
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:38,836
I have searched and searched
and searched...

155
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,464
- And?
- I found them.

156
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:44,873
Of all places,
they were inside my mattress.

157
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,207
Is this the complete set?

158
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:53,046
Absolutely.
That's the beauty of Polaroid...

159
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:55,450
no negatives and just one print.

160
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:58,047
Fair enough. What was our deal?
I owe you a hundred bucks?

161
00:12:58,089 --> 00:12:59,113
No, please...

162
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:00,954
You want Swiss francs
or German marks?

163
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:03,483
I told you, it's not
a question of money.

164
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:06,759
I don't need money.
What I need is...

165
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:10,457
A visa.

166
00:13:10,502 --> 00:13:11,969
A visa?

167
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:14,369
Yes. I want to go
back to America...

168
00:13:14,405 --> 00:13:15,838
and you can help me.

169
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:17,171
How?

170
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,971
You know all the big shots...

171
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,841
senators,
the State Department...

172
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:23,404
Dr. Kissinger.
You can pull strings.

173
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:24,472
Not a chance.

174
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:26,108
Not once you've been
deported as a criminal.

175
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:28,142
A criminal?
I'm not a criminal.

176
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:29,847
I'm a patriot.

177
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:32,083
You know why they deported me?

178
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:34,284
There were
all these hippies...

179
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:36,793
demonstrating
in Washington Square...

180
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:39,262
calling our President
filthy names...

181
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:41,959
and burning the American flag...

182
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,767
on July 4th, with police
all around doing nothing.

183
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:49,569
So I got pissed off...

184
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:52,838
and pulled my gun
out of my holster...

185
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:55,209
and what do you think happened?

186
00:13:55,246 --> 00:14:00,513
The cops arrested me.
It was a bum rap.

187
00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:03,783
Give me all the details,
and then when I get back...

188
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:05,790
This can't wait.

189
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:09,453
You know that maid Anna...
with the mustache?

190
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:12,622
- What about her?
- She wants me to marry her.

191
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:13,631
Congratulations.

192
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:14,996
God forbid.

193
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:17,797
If there is one thing worse
than a Sicilian woman...

194
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:20,999
it's a Sicilian woman
who's pregnant.

195
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,475
I must get out of here fast.

196
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:27,535
I sympathize with you,
and I'll do all I can...

197
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:29,979
but I can't make you
any promises.

198
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:33,347
I am counting on you.

199
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:37,453
Because, you see...

200
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:40,355
I have other photographs...

201
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:43,224
taken this morning.

202
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:47,027
Same rock, same sunrise...

203
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:49,898
different bodies.

204
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:53,495
So you better try very hard.

205
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:59,667
Wait a minute.

206
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:03,110
Where are those pictures?

207
00:15:03,147 --> 00:15:04,774
They are not in my mattress.

208
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:07,808
You miserable little crook, I'll
beat the bejesus out of you!

209
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:11,845
What a day.
Do you believe it?

210
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,791
And how about all those bells?
Smashing, aren't they?

211
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:16,418
Smashing is right.

212
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:18,827
If you need me, just ring.

213
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:22,458
Is it all right
if I go into your bathroom?

214
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,831
Yeah, by all means.

215
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:28,472
Don't let me interrupt. Go ahead
and finish your breakfast.

216
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:30,997
Isn't the coffee here fabulous?

217
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:38,212
What happened?

218
00:15:39,884 --> 00:15:41,977
What's the matter?
Did you burn yourself?

219
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,146
Guess what.

220
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:44,449
I weighed myself
on my own scales...

221
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:46,719
but I didn't believe it,
so I came here to check.

222
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:48,885
- I've lost three pounds.
- Really?

223
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:50,588
After that enormous meal
last night...

224
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:52,323
and strawberries
and cream this morning...

225
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:54,991
and bacon and eggs
and croissant and butter.

226
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:56,500
Wait till I see Dr. Shaftsbury.

227
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:58,001
They should defrock him
or disbar him...

228
00:15:58,036 --> 00:15:59,333
or whatever they do.

229
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,270
- Who's Dr. Shaftsbury?
- My psychiatrist.

230
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:02,273
Him, yeah.

231
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:05,299
He kept telling me I was unhappy
because I was overweight.

232
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:07,208
Rubbish! Obviously
I was overweight...

233
00:16:07,245 --> 00:16:08,803
because I was unhappy.
See what I mean?

234
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:10,336
Yes, I do.
I think I do.

235
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:11,541
How long will it take you?

236
00:16:11,582 --> 00:16:12,879
Because I can be ready
in no time.

237
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:13,884
Why?

238
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:15,510
You know those carts
with the horses...

239
00:16:15,553 --> 00:16:16,986
with the feathers
on their heads?

240
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:18,921
I thought maybe we could
take a ride around the island...

241
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:22,120
and stop for
a late lunch somewhere.

242
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,252
I'm starved again.

243
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:25,125
I'd like to,
but there's so many things...

244
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:27,893
I have to take care of
here at the hotel.

245
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:30,799
- It's our last day.
- There's still tonight.

246
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:32,302
Same program?

247
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:34,328
Dinner downstairs
and sunrise and...

248
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,637
Last night,
that was their thing.

249
00:16:37,675 --> 00:16:39,472
I thought maybe tonight
we'd do something different...

250
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,068
an our thing.

251
00:16:41,112 --> 00:16:42,670
Surprise me.

252
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,151
You can do my room now.

253
00:25:03,014 --> 00:25:04,538
Here you are.

254
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,551
You call this
a first-class hotel?

255
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:08,553
If it is about the bed
not being made, I can explain.

256
00:25:08,587 --> 00:25:10,054
Who cares about the bed?

257
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:11,817
It's about the valet
on this floor... Bruno.

258
00:25:11,856 --> 00:25:13,153
You know about it?

259
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:14,658
I know he's
a goddamn blackmailer.

260
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:16,024
I ought to kill
that dirty little fink.

261
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:18,621
- It has all been taken care of.
- What has?

262
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:21,530
- The dirty little fink is dead.
- Dead?

263
00:25:21,566 --> 00:25:22,863
Murdered.
He's lying in room 126...

264
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:24,163
with three bullets
in his chest.

265
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:25,965
Miss Piggott's room?

266
00:25:26,004 --> 00:25:28,495
She had nothing to do with it.
It was the maid Anna.

267
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,007
She killed him,
and then she ran away.

268
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,009
That is why your bed
has not been made.

269
00:25:32,043 --> 00:25:33,010
Terrible.

270
00:25:33,044 --> 00:25:34,511
It's a tragedy.

271
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:36,411
If you lose a guest,
you can always replace him.

272
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:39,440
But to lose a valet and a maid
in the middle of the season...

273
00:25:39,484 --> 00:25:42,578
Listen, that character Bruno,
he took some photographs.

274
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:44,521
Perfectly innocent, mind you...

275
00:25:44,556 --> 00:25:46,285
but if they fell
into the wrong hands...

276
00:25:46,324 --> 00:25:49,919
Don't worry. They fell
into the right hands.

277
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:52,725
I'm sorry. I had to look
just for a second...

278
00:25:52,764 --> 00:25:56,598
but I had to make sure
who they belonged to.

279
00:25:56,635 --> 00:25:57,727
Thanks.

280
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:00,602
There is just one thing
that puzzled me.

281
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:03,039
The black socks...

282
00:26:03,074 --> 00:26:05,406
Is it because
you are in mourning?

283
00:26:20,592 --> 00:26:23,152
- What's this?
- Miss Piggott's things.

284
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:25,685
We are moving them in here
temporarily, as a precaution.

285
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,164
- What precaution?
- The police will arrive...

286
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,666
and we do not
want her involved.

287
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:32,169
They will start asking
all kinds of questions.

288
00:26:32,203 --> 00:26:34,501
And who knows
what may come out.

289
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:36,734
What would I do without you?

290
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:39,369
I have often wondered
about that.

291
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:17,738
I'm sorry,
but you have been moved.

292
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:19,334
Moved? Why?

293
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:23,279
I just follow orders.
You are now in 121-122.

294
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:25,179
But I was perfectly happy...

295
00:28:26,351 --> 00:28:27,875
121-122?

296
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,546
Mr. Armbruster's suite.

297
00:28:36,394 --> 00:28:39,852
I'm sorry
for the inconvenience.

298
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:41,024
Don't be.

299
00:29:28,012 --> 00:29:29,877
It's me... Pamela.

300
00:29:29,914 --> 00:29:31,074
Hi!

301
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:37,719
I'm in the tub.
Make yourself at home.

302
00:29:39,224 --> 00:29:43,160
I must say,
you do have some cheek.

303
00:29:43,194 --> 00:29:45,219
I do?

304
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:48,323
Aren't you taking
rather a lot for granted?

305
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:50,334
Just what made you think
that I would have...

306
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:53,929
the slightest interest
in this arrangement?

307
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:55,997
Did you say something?

308
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,304
Not that I expected
any subtlety from you.

309
00:29:58,343 --> 00:29:59,810
After all, you're American.

310
00:29:59,844 --> 00:30:02,642
You're accustomed to having
everything your own way.

311
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,480
You see something you want,
and you just grab it.

312
00:30:06,517 --> 00:30:07,711
Come again?

313
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:09,947
London Bridge, for instance.

314
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:12,582
You simply took it apart
stone by stone...

315
00:30:12,624 --> 00:30:15,184
and shipped it off
to someplace in the wild west.

316
00:30:15,226 --> 00:30:18,286
Or the Queen Mary,
with all that tradition...

317
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:20,820
sitting there off
the coast of California...

318
00:30:20,865 --> 00:30:23,425
reduced to
a floating cafeteria.

319
00:30:23,468 --> 00:30:24,901
What the hell
are you talking about?

320
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:27,962
Such conceit, such arrogance.

321
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:30,531
You act as though
you own the world.

322
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:34,011
Playing golf on the moon.
Now, really.

323
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,570
Me, I play golf
at the country club.

324
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:37,672
Twelve handicap.

325
00:30:37,715 --> 00:30:40,684
And then you wonder
why people don't like you.

326
00:30:40,718 --> 00:30:42,913
Because you're like
spoiled children...

327
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:46,412
no manners,
no consideration.

328
00:30:46,457 --> 00:30:49,153
You don't just pick up
the phone and say...

329
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:52,287
"Move that bird
in here from 126."

330
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,298
If I'm to have
an affair with someone...

331
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:55,799
I'd like to know it first...

332
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:58,961
and not hear about it
from the concierge.

333
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:03,006
Oh, my god. The bags.

334
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:04,508
Wait a minute!

335
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:05,736
A girl likes to be asked.

336
00:31:05,777 --> 00:31:07,768
She should be given
a chance to say no.

337
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:08,779
Miss Piggott...

338
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:10,610
She wants to be talked into it.

339
00:31:10,648 --> 00:31:13,640
What we have here is
a failure of communication.

340
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:22,259
It's not that I'm
women's lib or anything.

341
00:31:22,293 --> 00:31:25,592
I don't mind being treated
as a sex object...

342
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,564
but it's like any other game.

343
00:31:27,598 --> 00:31:29,463
You have to play
according to the rules...

344
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,127
or it takes
all the fun out of it.

345
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:34,900
Hang on a minute
before things get out of hand!

346
00:31:45,683 --> 00:31:48,811
Hello? Hello?

347
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:49,820
Baltimore?

348
00:31:49,854 --> 00:31:52,846
Yes, this is
Mr. Armbruster's suite.

349
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,825
Could you speak up
a bit, please?

350
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,828
I'm sorry. Wendell can't
come to the phone right now.

351
00:31:57,862 --> 00:31:59,693
He's in the bathroom.

352
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:01,562
Can I help you?

353
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:03,794
This is Miss Piggott.

354
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:05,666
Am I the what?

355
00:32:05,703 --> 00:32:07,534
The interpreter?

356
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:11,736
Whatever gave you that idea?

357
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,075
Hello? Hello?

358
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:47,000
- This...
- You're dripping.

359
00:32:49,514 --> 00:32:51,982
Whatever you may think
of Americans...

360
00:32:52,016 --> 00:32:53,984
I do not consider you
"a bird."

361
00:32:54,018 --> 00:32:55,986
- I do not take you for granted...
- Thank you.

362
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,487
About your things being here...

363
00:32:57,522 --> 00:32:58,989
there was no time
to ask you.

364
00:32:59,023 --> 00:33:00,991
You were out of the hotel,
and under the circumstances...

365
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:02,652
it seemed the most
practical thing to do.

366
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:05,161
- I understand.
- No, you don't.

367
00:33:05,196 --> 00:33:06,959
You were moved
out of your room...

368
00:33:06,998 --> 00:33:08,989
for your own protection,
for our protection.

369
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:10,830
We do have to be very careful.

370
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:14,429
I said surprise me,
and you certainly did.

371
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:16,440
You're taller than I thought.

372
00:33:21,712 --> 00:33:24,442
What... The bed.

373
00:33:24,482 --> 00:33:26,109
Have you noticed
it's not been made up?

374
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,447
I'll do it later.

375
00:33:27,485 --> 00:33:28,952
That's because
of Anna, the maid.

376
00:33:28,986 --> 00:33:31,955
It seems that she was pregnant
by Bruno, the valet.

377
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:35,083
The things that go on
on this floor.

378
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:36,957
She wanted to get married,
but he didn't.

379
00:33:36,994 --> 00:33:38,962
He wanted to go back
to America...

380
00:33:38,996 --> 00:33:40,964
but there was a problem
because he'd been deported.

381
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:43,558
So he wanted me to help him,
and she found out about it...

382
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:45,831
Is this going to be
a long story?

383
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,896
Anyway, the maid...
she's Sicilian, you know...

384
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,306
she got a gun, and she
shot him just like that.

385
00:33:51,342 --> 00:33:53,503
Three bullets right
through the photographs.

386
00:33:53,544 --> 00:33:55,512
And that's why your bags...

387
00:33:59,183 --> 00:34:01,151
All clear. The body
has been removed.

388
00:34:01,185 --> 00:34:03,278
The police have left the hotel.

389
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:05,482
So we can now take
Miss Piggott's luggage...

390
00:34:05,523 --> 00:34:07,013
back to her room.

391
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:10,517
I'll take care of that.

392
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:21,004
As I was trying to tell you...

393
00:34:21,038 --> 00:34:23,006
The murder... She shot him
in your room.

394
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,008
We had to move you
out of there fast...

395
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:27,510
before the police got there.

396
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:32,073
Then this was not
exactly an... invitation?

397
00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:33,140
Not really.

398
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:36,813
As a matter of fact,
it was Carlucci's idea.

399
00:34:36,854 --> 00:34:38,185
How stupid.

400
00:34:38,222 --> 00:34:40,349
No, it wasn't.
Because the Italian police...

401
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:42,120
once they start
asking questions...

402
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,628
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

403
00:34:44,662 --> 00:34:47,961
It's just one of those things.
It's nobody's fault.

404
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:50,297
Fortunately,
I'm only half unpacked.

405
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:53,903
These things happen.

406
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:57,534
I remember I was invited...

407
00:34:57,575 --> 00:35:00,043
to a New Year's Eve party
in New York.

408
00:35:00,077 --> 00:35:03,046
3 East 72nd Street.
I had a ball!

409
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,707
It wasn't until
the next morning...

410
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:06,649
I found out I was
at the wrong party.

411
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:09,414
It was 3 West 72nd Street.

412
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:12,616
Don't you think that's funny?

413
00:35:20,198 --> 00:35:22,428
Put it through. Baltimore.

414
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:24,696
They called you before.

415
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:28,699
Hello.

416
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:30,764
Hello, Emily. How are you?

417
00:35:32,176 --> 00:35:34,167
Is something wrong?

418
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:36,407
What was that?

419
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:38,142
Wait a minute.
Miss Piggott?

420
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:40,616
I told you before,
she's the interpreter.

421
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:43,119
Who says she isn't?

422
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:44,280
She did?

423
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:48,048
I can explain that.

424
00:35:51,395 --> 00:35:54,523
She's English,
and we're in Italy.

425
00:35:54,565 --> 00:35:56,123
She can't get a labor permit...

426
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:58,032
and naturally,
she's not going to admit...

427
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:01,527
What do you mean,
she's in my room all the time?

428
00:36:01,572 --> 00:36:04,063
I don't mind you getting
a little jealous now and then...

429
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:05,473
but isn't this ridiculous?

430
00:36:05,509 --> 00:36:07,909
Do you think that I,
at a time like this...

431
00:36:07,945 --> 00:36:09,537
What music?

432
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,979
OK, all right!

433
00:36:11,015 --> 00:36:12,676
Go ahead! Have it your way!

434
00:36:12,717 --> 00:36:14,685
I've got a gypsy band
up here...

435
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,880
incense is burning,
the booze is flowing!

436
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:20,379
Miss Piggott and I
are playing frogleap bare-assed!

437
00:36:20,424 --> 00:36:22,187
Is that any better?

438
00:36:26,864 --> 00:36:29,526
Just to put
your mind at rest...

439
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:31,364
you needn't be worried
one bit...

440
00:36:31,402 --> 00:36:33,870
because if you saw me,
I'm short, I'm fat...

441
00:36:33,904 --> 00:36:36,372
and I'm not
very attractive. OK?

442
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,406
All right, Emily,
you satisfied now?

443
00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:45,643
Let's just forget
the whole incident.

444
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:47,810
Yes, I should be out
of here by tomorrow.

445
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:49,342
Everything's all wrapped up.

446
00:36:49,387 --> 00:36:52,515
One small snag in Naples...
the export license.

447
00:36:52,556 --> 00:36:55,150
Blodgett? Jo Jo Blodgett?

448
00:36:55,192 --> 00:36:58,127
Yes, I know he's with
the State Department.

449
00:36:58,162 --> 00:36:59,789
A friggin' bore.

450
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,128
He's stationed in Paris?

451
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:04,896
There is no reason to contact...

452
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:07,403
all right, if worse
comes to worst.

453
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:09,372
Yeah, I'll tell her.

454
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:10,669
Kiss-kiss.

455
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,909
Mrs. Armbruster said
to apologize to you.

456
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:18,005
No need.

457
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:19,914
Personally, I thought
you overdid it a little.

458
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,281
I was just telling the truth.

459
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:22,980
Come on. Stop
putting yourself down.

460
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,487
I'm sure there's
any number of men...

461
00:37:24,522 --> 00:37:26,149
who'd find you very attractive.

462
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,626
Oh, yes.
No-good bastard Bertram...

463
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,026
and some sex-starved
sardine fishermen...

464
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:34,725
and the local coroner, who took
me for a ride on his scooter...

465
00:37:34,765 --> 00:37:36,630
and then pinched my behind.

466
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:40,666
If it's of
any interest to you...

467
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:44,163
you know who finds you
attractive? Me.

468
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,039
I find you attractive.

469
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:47,738
Don't bother. I'll survive.

470
00:37:47,778 --> 00:37:50,713
This isn't the first time
I've made a fool of myself.

471
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:00,885
Excuse me.

472
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:02,893
Would you consider it
impertinent...

473
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:05,862
if I asked you
to step on the scales?

474
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:08,228
- Yes, I would.
- Please?

475
00:38:08,265 --> 00:38:09,732
I really don't care anymore.

476
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:13,066
It's not the weight,
it's the height.

477
00:38:22,012 --> 00:38:23,980
Why don't you
just make a contribution...

478
00:38:24,014 --> 00:38:25,845
to your favorite charity?

479
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:10,026
Are you guys sure
this is Ischia?

480
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,925
Reasonably sure, sir.

481
00:39:11,962 --> 00:39:14,328
Because I don't want
to land in Africa.

482
00:39:14,365 --> 00:39:16,629
That would be bigger, sir.

483
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:19,261
Maybe it's one
of those Greek islands.

484
00:39:19,303 --> 00:39:22,602
No, sir. Greece is
way to the left.

485
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,939
Not as long as I'm
with the State Department.

486
00:40:03,814 --> 00:40:06,647
Go away! Go away!

487
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:08,879
What the hell is
the name of this place?

488
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:12,013
Ischia, but you cannot land.

489
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:13,990
What do you mean, we can't land?

490
00:40:14,024 --> 00:40:17,460
It is lunchtime.
Come back later.

491
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:20,726
My good man, do you know
to whom you're talking?

492
00:40:20,764 --> 00:40:22,891
I do not talk to anybody.

493
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:24,423
Lunchtime!

494
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:26,561
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

495
00:40:26,604 --> 00:40:29,164
I am Joseph J. Blodgett...

496
00:40:29,206 --> 00:40:31,572
United States Government,
State Department...

497
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:33,770
and I'm here
on an emergency mission...

498
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:36,803
concerning an American citizen.

499
00:40:36,847 --> 00:40:38,974
OK, boys, stand by.

500
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:41,382
And you better start clearing
some of these seats out...

501
00:40:41,418 --> 00:40:43,386
so we have room
for the coffin.

502
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,978
Roger.

503
00:40:45,022 --> 00:40:50,050
Tell me, how far
is this hotel?

504
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:52,824
Grand Hotel Excelsior,
five kilometers.

505
00:40:52,863 --> 00:40:56,321
OK, OK. What do we do
about transportation?

506
00:40:56,367 --> 00:41:00,303
No transportation.
Lunchtime!

507
00:41:00,337 --> 00:41:04,034
What the hell is going on
in this country?

508
00:41:04,074 --> 00:41:07,703
This wouldn't have happened
in the old days.

509
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:12,842
You remember Mussolini?

510
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:19,885
Christ.

511
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:21,050
What's the matter?

512
00:41:21,091 --> 00:41:22,524
Just thinking about
going back home.

513
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,357
I hate the whole idea.

514
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:26,454
- Thank you.
- Right after the funeral...

515
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:28,465
there's going to be
a board of directors meeting...

516
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:29,966
and probably a proxy fight...

517
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,968
and I'll have to spend
a week in Washington...

518
00:41:32,002 --> 00:41:34,971
because they're investigating
the Armbruster Foundation.

519
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:36,472
And there's that strike...

520
00:41:36,507 --> 00:41:38,805
at our electronics plant
in Wisconsin.

521
00:41:38,842 --> 00:41:40,833
And we'll probably
have to recall...

522
00:41:40,878 --> 00:41:43,472
250,000 square feet
of artificial turf...

523
00:41:43,514 --> 00:41:44,981
because they said...

524
00:41:45,015 --> 00:41:47,483
there's too much lead
in the green paint.

525
00:41:47,518 --> 00:41:49,486
Goddamn Ralph Nader.

526
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,010
Who asked him?

527
00:41:53,057 --> 00:41:55,491
Guess we all have our problems.

528
00:41:55,526 --> 00:41:58,495
I have to pick up my cat
from the vet's in Bayswater.

529
00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:02,488
Hope the garage will have
my Mini Morris fixed by now.

530
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:04,967
And I really should
repaint my kitchen.

531
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,162
Can I have your croissant?

532
00:42:08,205 --> 00:42:11,800
Of course. You can have
anything you want.

533
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:16,408
About your flat in London...

534
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,938
Won't you need a new
television and hairdryer...

535
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:22,180
all that stuff that
your apostle ran off with?

536
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:24,881
Don't bother.
I dry my hair in the oven...

537
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:26,446
and I really
don't watch the telly.

538
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,957
It's always the same...

539
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:29,459
northern Ireland
and Princess Anne...

540
00:42:29,493 --> 00:42:30,926
and the Common Market.

541
00:42:36,433 --> 00:42:39,095
Pamela... my father
and your mother...

542
00:42:39,136 --> 00:42:44,506
Now, during all those years,
didn't he ever give her any...

543
00:42:46,276 --> 00:42:50,144
He must have helped her out
from time to time.

544
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,374
Financially.

545
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:57,113
You want to know whether
my mother was a kept woman?

546
00:42:57,154 --> 00:43:00,487
After all, a man likes
to show his gratitude.

547
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:02,492
Maybe an occasional present?

548
00:43:02,526 --> 00:43:04,494
Every Christmas,
he would send her...

549
00:43:04,528 --> 00:43:07,929
a dozen long-stemmed roses
to the Savoy hotel.

550
00:43:07,965 --> 00:43:09,830
Your mother was well-to-do?

551
00:43:09,867 --> 00:43:14,031
No. She was making
£15 a week and tips.

552
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:17,336
On £15 a week,
she was living at the Savoy?

553
00:43:17,374 --> 00:43:19,774
She wasn't living there.
She was working there...

554
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:21,300
as a manicurist.

555
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:27,912
Did my father know that?

556
00:43:27,951 --> 00:43:30,818
She didn't want him to know.

557
00:43:30,854 --> 00:43:32,617
Why not?

558
00:43:32,656 --> 00:43:34,624
I told you the first day.

559
00:43:34,658 --> 00:43:37,855
She loved him.
She didn't want any tips.

560
00:43:47,337 --> 00:43:48,964
That'll be Carlucci.

561
00:43:49,006 --> 00:43:50,735
"I have good news.

562
00:43:50,774 --> 00:43:54,301
"The arrangements,
they have all been made."

563
00:43:58,182 --> 00:44:01,049
I guess it's checking-out time.

564
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:05,889
Yes.

565
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:09,256
Did Miss Piggott
enjoy her kippers?

566
00:44:09,293 --> 00:44:10,920
No, that's not why I called.

567
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:13,725
I called to tell you
that Anna the maid...

568
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:15,823
she has been arrested
by the police...

569
00:44:15,866 --> 00:44:18,357
in a rowboat trying
to escape to Sicily.

570
00:44:18,402 --> 00:44:20,734
And the bodies,
they are in the coffins...

571
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:22,671
and all ready for shipment.

572
00:44:22,706 --> 00:44:24,503
Let me see...
there was something else.

573
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:27,601
The judge in Naples,
he has had a slight stroke.

574
00:44:27,644 --> 00:44:29,612
Wait a minute. What judge?

575
00:44:29,646 --> 00:44:31,204
I don't know
any judge in Naples.

576
00:44:31,248 --> 00:44:33,978
Yes, you do.

577
00:44:34,017 --> 00:44:37,009
The one with the same mistress
as my cousin the lawyer...

578
00:44:37,054 --> 00:44:39,181
who was going to get
my nephew out of jail.

579
00:44:39,223 --> 00:44:41,987
She was going to help him,
but she helped him too hard...

580
00:44:42,025 --> 00:44:44,550
and the judge, he always had
high blood pressure.

581
00:44:44,595 --> 00:44:47,564
What are you trying to tell me?

582
00:44:48,565 --> 00:44:50,897
We have no export license,
is that it?

583
00:44:52,503 --> 00:44:54,198
More or less.

584
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:56,536
Now they will have to
appoint a new judge.

585
00:44:56,573 --> 00:44:58,268
That may take a day or two.

586
00:44:58,308 --> 00:45:01,004
We sure are running
in bad luck.

587
00:45:01,044 --> 00:45:03,410
It's not your fault.
It's the way it goes.

588
00:45:05,415 --> 00:45:08,543
Don't worry about it.
I still like you.

589
00:45:08,585 --> 00:45:10,416
Problems?

590
00:45:10,454 --> 00:45:12,979
We may be stuck here
for another couple of days.

591
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:14,490
That's terrible.

592
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:15,992
Yeah.

593
00:45:16,026 --> 00:45:17,493
What about the funeral?

594
00:45:17,528 --> 00:45:19,996
Oh, boy!
All those people...

595
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:23,158
the closed-circuit TV,
glee club...

596
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,168
I'll just have to call
Baltimore.

597
00:45:25,202 --> 00:45:28,000
If it has to be postponed,
it has to be postponed.

598
00:45:28,038 --> 00:45:30,006
- I'm so sorry.
- What can I do?

599
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,508
You've certainly done
everything you could.

600
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,602
How about you and your plans?

601
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:39,011
We're not that busy
in the shop.

602
00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:42,018
I'm sure mother won't mind.
She's in no hurry...

603
00:45:42,052 --> 00:45:44,316
to get back to the rain
and the cold.

604
00:45:47,357 --> 00:45:49,848
I guess dad
wouldn't mind, either.

605
00:45:49,893 --> 00:45:52,020
They deserve another
couple of days together...

606
00:45:52,062 --> 00:45:53,552
don't you think?

607
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,549
Thank you.

608
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:15,950
My pleasure!

609
00:46:32,135 --> 00:46:33,500
What room is he in?

610
00:46:33,537 --> 00:46:37,496
Just a moment.
Your name, please?

611
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:41,170
Here. I'll talk to him.

612
00:46:41,211 --> 00:46:42,872
Wendell, boy?

613
00:46:42,913 --> 00:46:45,006
Jo Jo Blodgett,
State Department.

614
00:46:45,048 --> 00:46:48,017
How are you, kid?
Emily called me last night...

615
00:46:48,051 --> 00:46:49,678
told me about
your little problem.

616
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,689
Damn it. I told her
not to bother you.

617
00:46:52,723 --> 00:46:54,691
I'm sorry, Jo Jo.
I realize you've got...

618
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:56,625
more important things
to do in Paris.

619
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,127
Sure do.
That's why I grabbed...

620
00:46:58,161 --> 00:46:59,560
the first plane to Rome
this morning.

621
00:46:59,596 --> 00:47:01,860
Borrowed a helicopter
from the sixth fleet.

622
00:47:01,899 --> 00:47:05,528
You're on Ischia?
Where? At the airport?

623
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:08,732
Better than that, kiddo.
I'm right here in the lobby.

624
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:12,139
You're in the lobby!

625
00:47:12,175 --> 00:47:13,642
That's great.

626
00:47:13,677 --> 00:47:15,474
That's what I
really call service.

627
00:47:15,512 --> 00:47:17,810
Why don't you
just check in, wash up...

628
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:19,748
and we'll have a drink
later in the afternoon.

629
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:21,751
What drink? What later?

630
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:23,548
I got to get
back to Paris tonight.

631
00:47:23,587 --> 00:47:26,055
I'm taking Julie
and David Eisenhower...

632
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:29,490
to dinner at Maxim's.
So we got to get cracking.

633
00:47:29,526 --> 00:47:31,323
We haven't got a minute to lose.
Be right with you.

634
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:34,023
What's that room number?

635
00:48:13,503 --> 00:48:15,494
What are we going
to do with this?

636
00:48:16,506 --> 00:48:18,667
What are we going
to do with you?

637
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,976
I am Carlo Carlucci,
director of the hotel.

638
00:48:26,016 --> 00:48:27,984
Such a pleasure
to have you here.

639
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:29,144
Thank you.

640
00:48:29,186 --> 00:48:30,983
It may interest you to know
we once had...

641
00:48:31,021 --> 00:48:32,989
another famous American diplomat
staying here once...

642
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,820
Mr. Benjamin Franklin.

643
00:48:34,858 --> 00:48:36,985
Franklin? Yes, Ben Franklin.

644
00:48:37,027 --> 00:48:38,585
A good man for his time.

645
00:48:38,628 --> 00:48:40,095
Of course,
today I'm not sure...

646
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,529
he could pass
the security check.

647
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:43,157
Would you like to see his room?

648
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,997
It is in the old part
of the building.

649
00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:46,559
Not now!

650
00:48:46,603 --> 00:48:49,071
Excuse me. I would like
your advice about something...

651
00:48:49,106 --> 00:48:51,074
straight from the horse's mouth.

652
00:48:51,108 --> 00:48:53,542
Do you think there will be
a war in the Middle East?

653
00:48:54,711 --> 00:48:57,839
We don't give out
that kind of information.

654
00:48:57,881 --> 00:48:59,348
I have been offered a job...

655
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:02,944
with a chain of American
hotels... the Sheraton.

656
00:49:02,986 --> 00:49:06,285
There are a couple of openings,
and one of them is in Damascus.

657
00:49:09,459 --> 00:49:11,791
Don't quote me on this,
but with the Russian presence...

658
00:49:11,828 --> 00:49:13,455
escalating
in the Mediterranean...

659
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:15,465
and the military posture
of the Arabs stiffening...

660
00:49:15,499 --> 00:49:18,696
and the first-strike capability
of the Israelis at its peak...

661
00:49:18,735 --> 00:49:20,464
the whole place is a powder keg.

662
00:49:20,504 --> 00:49:22,472
Could blow up
in your face any second.

663
00:49:22,506 --> 00:49:24,474
My advice is forget Damascus.

664
00:49:24,508 --> 00:49:27,966
Thank you. In that case,
I had better take the other job.

665
00:49:28,011 --> 00:49:31,970
- What's that?
- The Sheraton in New York.

666
00:49:32,015 --> 00:49:33,949
Take the one in Damascus.

667
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,182
- One more question.
- No more questions!

668
00:49:43,193 --> 00:49:44,717
Come in.

669
00:49:46,396 --> 00:49:49,194
Jo Jo Blodgett,
if I ever saw one.

670
00:49:49,232 --> 00:49:51,223
Hi there.

671
00:49:53,236 --> 00:49:55,500
How are you? Been a long time.

672
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:58,406
I haven't been back
to the States since '67.

673
00:49:58,442 --> 00:50:00,410
That's it.
Halloween of '67.

674
00:50:00,444 --> 00:50:03,504
Party at the country club.
You came dressed as Batman.

675
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:06,880
I'm sorry about
what happened to your father.

676
00:50:08,552 --> 00:50:12,454
Look, it's 2:00
in the afternoon.

677
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:14,184
At 11:00 tomorrow morning...

678
00:50:14,224 --> 00:50:16,454
you have a funeral
4,000 miles away...

679
00:50:16,493 --> 00:50:18,552
and you're sitting here
getting a manicure?

680
00:50:21,431 --> 00:50:26,767
This is Miss Tromboncino.
She works in the barber shop.

681
00:50:30,807 --> 00:50:33,332
Could you possibly
speed it up a little?

682
00:50:35,245 --> 00:50:38,180
She doesn't speak any English.

683
00:50:41,451 --> 00:50:42,975
I get that all over the world.

684
00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:44,486
Mind you, I don't object...

685
00:50:44,521 --> 00:50:46,489
to foreigners speaking
a foreign language.

686
00:50:46,523 --> 00:50:49,686
I just wish they'd all speak
the same foreign language.

687
00:50:53,997 --> 00:50:56,192
- Odd.
- What's odd?

688
00:50:56,233 --> 00:50:59,794
If I didn't know
how straight-laced you were...

689
00:50:59,836 --> 00:51:02,805
and if I didn't know
that you were in mourning...

690
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:06,002
and if that dame
were about 20 pounds lighter...

691
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:08,510
- I would sort of suspect...
- Suspect what?

692
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:12,948
Mr. Blodgett, please.
That dame, she is my niece.

693
00:51:12,983 --> 00:51:15,975
She was brought up
by the Carmelite sisters.

694
00:51:20,323 --> 00:51:22,052
I was only kidding.

695
00:51:22,092 --> 00:51:24,185
It is forgotten.

696
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,739
How many more fingers
has she got to go?

697
00:51:41,778 --> 00:51:43,473
Relax, will you?

698
00:51:43,513 --> 00:51:45,981
Relax nothing.
You're screwing up my timetable.

699
00:51:46,016 --> 00:51:47,984
I've got that helicopter
standing by.

700
00:51:48,018 --> 00:51:50,316
- Can I use your can?
- What for?

701
00:51:50,353 --> 00:51:51,820
To wash my hands.

702
00:51:51,855 --> 00:51:53,322
I mean, what's
the helicopter for?

703
00:51:53,356 --> 00:51:55,654
To pick up the old boy.
We're going to fly him to Rome.

704
00:51:55,692 --> 00:51:57,853
Then I'm going to put you
on the night plane to Baltimore.

705
00:52:00,263 --> 00:52:02,197
- Tonight?
- Sure.

706
00:52:02,232 --> 00:52:03,699
That's what you think.

707
00:52:03,733 --> 00:52:05,496
This is Italy.
Nothing's that simple.

708
00:52:05,535 --> 00:52:07,230
We're still hassling over
the export license.

709
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:08,669
Emily told me all about that.

710
00:52:08,705 --> 00:52:10,434
It looks like we can't get
out of here before Wednesday.

711
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,940
I was about to phone home, tell
them to postpone the ceremony.

712
00:52:12,976 --> 00:52:15,945
Postpone nothing.
Batman is here.

713
00:52:15,979 --> 00:52:17,947
We don't need an export license.

714
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:19,744
We're gonna bypass
all that bull.

715
00:52:19,783 --> 00:52:21,250
Bypass?
How can you do it?

716
00:52:21,284 --> 00:52:23,752
No sweat. We're
appointing your father...

717
00:52:23,787 --> 00:52:26,085
commercial attaché
to the embassy in Rome.

718
00:52:26,122 --> 00:52:28,454
And that entitles him
to all the rights...

719
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:30,152
and immunities of a diplomat.

720
00:52:30,193 --> 00:52:32,457
Wait a minute.
You're going to appoint him...

721
00:52:32,495 --> 00:52:34,463
- Why not?
- A dead man?

722
00:52:34,497 --> 00:52:37,466
Just proves that we don't
discriminate against anybody...

723
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,368
for reasons of race, creed,
color, or state of health.

724
00:52:41,404 --> 00:52:45,363
You mean we handle him
just like a diplomatic pouch?

725
00:52:45,408 --> 00:52:47,968
You bet. He goes
right through customs...

726
00:52:48,011 --> 00:52:52,141
sealed coffin, no inspection,
no formalities at either end.

727
00:52:52,182 --> 00:52:54,480
- That's kind of cute.
- That's nothing.

728
00:52:54,517 --> 00:52:58,009
Someday I'll tell you
how we got Batista out of Cuba.

729
00:52:59,389 --> 00:53:02,187
First on the agenda...

730
00:53:02,225 --> 00:53:03,954
First, you wanted to go
to the can.

731
00:53:03,994 --> 00:53:05,518
Can. That's right.

732
00:53:12,802 --> 00:53:17,739
I'm sorry.
Mother would never forgive me.

733
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:21,574
Look at the wretched job
I did on your nails.

734
00:53:35,158 --> 00:53:36,625
Tell me something.

735
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,457
Bruno's body.
What did they do with it?

736
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:40,963
It is lying in the morgue,
unclaimed. No family.

737
00:53:40,997 --> 00:53:42,464
- Interesting.
- In what way?

738
00:53:42,499 --> 00:53:44,228
We may have a use
for that third coffin.

739
00:53:44,267 --> 00:53:46,132
That is very generous of you.

740
00:53:46,169 --> 00:53:49,229
Your family plot,
does that offer still stand?

741
00:53:49,272 --> 00:53:51,035
You're not suggesting
we bury Bruno there!

742
00:53:51,074 --> 00:53:53,508
The Carluccis, they would
turn over in their graves.

743
00:53:53,543 --> 00:53:56,103
I wasn't thinking of Bruno.

744
00:53:56,146 --> 00:53:57,477
No?

745
00:53:57,514 --> 00:53:59,675
You were thinking
of somebody else?

746
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:03,683
Maybe... two somebody elses?

747
00:54:09,526 --> 00:54:12,495
My ancestors,
they will be honored.

748
00:54:12,529 --> 00:54:14,497
We're not there yet.
There's a time element.

749
00:54:14,531 --> 00:54:16,499
And we'll need
some transportation.

750
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:18,000
Transportation?
No sweat.

751
00:54:18,034 --> 00:54:19,524
I will call the Trotta brothers.

752
00:54:22,038 --> 00:54:23,505
You know you got...

753
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,508
a plate of scrambled eggs
in the bathtub?

754
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:28,204
- I do?
- And half a herring.

755
00:54:28,244 --> 00:54:31,680
Now you understand why
I want that job with Sheraton.

756
00:54:31,715 --> 00:54:35,549
OK, kid, here is the game plan.

757
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,255
You get dressed and packed.
Next, we collect your father.

758
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:43,020
Sure thing. As soon
as they open the morgue.

759
00:54:43,059 --> 00:54:45,527
And I want some officials
at that airport.

760
00:54:45,562 --> 00:54:48,030
I want the mayor
and what-have-you.

761
00:54:48,064 --> 00:54:49,531
Of course.
Right after lunch.

762
00:54:49,566 --> 00:54:51,534
- That will be 4:00.
- 4:00?

763
00:54:51,568 --> 00:54:54,036
That's when they open
the mortuary.

764
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,538
That goddamn lunchtime again.

765
00:54:56,573 --> 00:55:00,532
We pour in millions
of dollars of foreign aid...

766
00:55:00,577 --> 00:55:04,069
just so they can sit
on their butts and...

767
00:55:09,085 --> 00:55:12,486
What the hell is there to do
around here for two hours?

768
00:55:12,522 --> 00:55:14,649
Tell him about the mud baths.

769
00:55:14,691 --> 00:55:16,181
Mud baths?

770
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:17,989
World-famous.

771
00:55:18,027 --> 00:55:20,154
For rheumatism, arthritis,
neuritis, phlebitis...

772
00:55:20,196 --> 00:55:24,997
urinary complaints,
hyperacidity, male potency.

773
00:55:25,034 --> 00:55:26,524
Is that so?

774
00:55:28,037 --> 00:55:31,006
Come to think of it, I do have
a slight acid condition.

775
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,507
Maybe I'll give that
a little whirl.

776
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:34,009
By all means.

777
00:55:34,043 --> 00:55:36,511
It is downstairs.
I will show you.

778
00:55:36,546 --> 00:55:38,411
Be right back.

779
00:55:39,783 --> 00:55:41,774
Where do we meet?

780
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:45,413
Let me put it all together,
and we'll meet at the airport.

781
00:55:45,455 --> 00:55:47,082
Right-o.

782
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:53,026
That mud business...
does it really help?

783
00:55:53,062 --> 00:55:55,030
I assure you, after one bath...

784
00:55:55,064 --> 00:55:57,897
you will have the acidity
of a man of twenty.

785
00:56:08,778 --> 00:56:10,109
Thank you.

786
00:56:13,183 --> 00:56:14,844
It was your idea.

787
00:56:19,022 --> 00:56:21,456
What's the name
of that orchestra here?

788
00:56:21,491 --> 00:56:23,755
Sergio... something. Why?

789
00:56:23,793 --> 00:56:25,488
We might as well go all the way.

790
00:56:25,528 --> 00:56:26,995
I'm sure he'd enjoy it more...

791
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:29,498
than that glee club
in Baltimore...

792
00:56:29,532 --> 00:56:31,261
the son of a bitch.

793
00:57:15,178 --> 00:57:19,512
The marble, do you
want it white or pink?

794
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:20,641
Pink.

795
00:57:22,151 --> 00:57:24,585
Very good. And the inscription?

796
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:29,882
I guess..."Willie and Kate."

797
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,123
"Willie and Kate."
That is all?

798
00:57:34,163 --> 00:57:38,065
We don't want any weeping angels
or hearts intertwined.

799
00:57:38,101 --> 00:57:40,001
Or do we?

800
00:57:40,036 --> 00:57:43,631
How about
"Willie and Kate Carlucci"?

801
00:57:43,673 --> 00:57:44,935
I'll go for that.

802
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:48,800
You make me very happy.

803
00:57:50,613 --> 00:57:54,447
And there will be
tromboncini every Sunday.

804
00:57:54,484 --> 00:57:59,581
After all, we are now
one big family.

805
00:58:01,057 --> 00:58:02,524
Hold it, boys.

806
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,357
My father goes
on the other side.

807
00:58:05,395 --> 00:58:08,057
Very important.
It's his good ear.

808
00:58:25,148 --> 00:58:26,342
Damn!

809
00:58:38,795 --> 00:58:40,729
What the hell took you so long?

810
00:58:40,763 --> 00:58:43,732
Signore, in Italy,
when a coffin passes by...

811
00:58:43,766 --> 00:58:45,529
people cross themselves.

812
00:58:45,568 --> 00:58:47,468
They kneel down sometimes
in the middle of the road.

813
00:58:47,503 --> 00:58:48,731
You just cannot...

814
00:58:48,771 --> 00:58:50,238
All right, all right.

815
00:58:50,273 --> 00:58:53,037
Over here, boys!
Let's get this thing down!

816
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:06,188
Poor Bruno.

817
00:59:06,222 --> 00:59:07,849
If he knew what was
happening to him...

818
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:09,357
What do you mean, "poor Bruno"?

819
00:59:09,392 --> 00:59:13,021
This is what he always wanted...
to go back to America.

820
00:59:15,798 --> 00:59:17,993
Come on, boys.
Snap it up, will you?

821
00:59:18,034 --> 00:59:19,524
Come on. It's getting late.

822
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:24,565
Will the witnesses
please step forward?

823
00:59:31,481 --> 00:59:35,076
Raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

824
00:59:35,118 --> 00:59:39,987
I, Wendell Armbruster Sr.,
do solemnly swear...

825
00:59:40,023 --> 00:59:42,992
that I will uphold
and defend...

826
00:59:43,026 --> 00:59:45,551
the Constitution
of the United States...

827
00:59:45,595 --> 00:59:48,928
against all enemies
foreign and domestic...

828
00:59:48,965 --> 00:59:52,992
and that I will perform
the duties of my office...

829
00:59:53,036 --> 00:59:58,269
to the best of my ability,
so help me God.

830
01:00:00,243 --> 01:00:02,268
Congratulations, sir.

831
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:28,333
And salute!

832
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:35,173
Ready, hup!

833
01:00:36,913 --> 01:00:39,939
Thank you, gentlemen.
That concludes the ceremonies.

834
01:00:39,982 --> 01:00:42,143
All right, load her up.

835
01:00:42,185 --> 01:00:43,812
Here. You'll need this.

836
01:00:43,853 --> 01:00:46,219
It's your father's
diplomatic passport.

837
01:00:46,255 --> 01:00:47,483
You don't miss a trick, do you?

838
01:00:47,523 --> 01:00:49,491
The C.I.A. Ran it off
for me last night.

839
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:50,822
The C.I.A.?

840
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,851
Never heard of them.
Let's go.

841
01:01:05,942 --> 01:01:09,742
Good-bye, Pamela Piggott.

842
01:01:09,779 --> 01:01:11,940
Have a good flight.
Don't work too hard.

843
01:01:11,981 --> 01:01:13,949
Suppose I do?
The worst that can happen...

844
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:16,747
is I'll wind up
with a bad back.

845
01:01:16,786 --> 01:01:19,311
The suite, it will be ready.

846
01:01:19,355 --> 01:01:21,983
July 15th to August 15th.

847
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:34,158
If we should run into
each other again...

848
01:01:34,203 --> 01:01:35,966
in the lobby
or the souvenir shop...

849
01:01:36,005 --> 01:01:38,872
I promise you I'll be so thin.

850
01:01:38,908 --> 01:01:43,504
You lose one pound,
just one pound...

851
01:01:43,546 --> 01:01:45,514
and it's all over between us.

852
01:01:46,514 --> 01:01:56,514
