00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:51,035
David, are you in bed yet?

2
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:55,582
Um... Yeah, I am.

3
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:58,251
OK. Good night. I love you.

4
00:00:58,334 --> 00:01:00,420
I love you too.

5
00:02:58,663 --> 00:03:01,916
More news here
at your all-memories station

6
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,295
for St Petersburg and Tampa
at the top of the hour.

7
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:09,424
Now, I'dlike to send out congratulations
to Thelma Miller of Orient Park.

8
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:13,469
She was our eighth caller yesterday,
and collected $225

9
00:03:13,553 --> 00:03:17,015
on our big Money Memories Jackpot.
Today it could be you!

10
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,935
Oh, my. Look at this.

11
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:24,272
Here you go, Alma. Your little cart.

12
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:26,983
- What a mess.
- Load this for me, could you?

13
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:35,533
- Ex-Lax. You got my Ex-Lax?
- Heating pad. My heating pad.

14
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:38,912
There, Bernie. I hope you feel better.

15
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:42,498
- Don't use that stuff. Use prunes.
- I use both.

16
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,587
- That's everything.
- Rose, I think these must belong to you.

17
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,383
Oh, thank you. I'm Rose Lefkowitz.
I don't believe we've met.

18
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:54,761
- This is Ben, Rose.
- How do you do?

19
00:03:57,347 --> 00:04:02,393
She remembers who I am, she remembers
who she is, so we're doing OK. Come on.

20
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:05,104
That's it.

21
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:07,982
Poor Rose. She's really slipping.

22
00:04:10,193 --> 00:04:11,236
Here we go.

23
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,532
# And swing 'em to the left,
then you swing 'em to the right

24
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:18,701
# Then you do the twist with all ofyour might

25
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:22,038
# Truck on down, let's go to town

26
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:24,666
# And that's what we call dancin'!

27
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:28,419
- Let me hear it!
- # And that's what we call dancin'!

28
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:31,839
Hit it! Oh, that's much better.

29
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:34,259
Come on, ladies. Pick 'em up.

30
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:38,721
Oh. Very good. Girls, that's wonderful.

31
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:42,225
I saw this, but I fell asleep,
so I don't know how...

32
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:44,936
# Shake your little shoulders
and get on down

33
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:48,523
# Do the Suzy-Q that's good for you

34
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:51,359
# And that's what we call dancin'!

35
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:53,778
- Let me hear it!
- # That's what we call dancin'!

36
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:55,947
Hey, Art! Art!

37
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,578
Come on over here.
I could use some real men here.

38
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:04,247
If we see any, we'll send them over.

39
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:07,208
Hit it.

40
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,045
Here we go.
# And swing 'em to the left...

41
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:15,133
- You gonna do anything about that one?
- Already have.

42
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:18,386
You put it to her?

43
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:20,555
You're disgusting.

44
00:05:21,514 --> 00:05:23,641
So then you haven't, huh?

45
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:26,477
- What?
- I say, so then you haven't.

46
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:32,650
- There you go, Pops.
- Ben!

47
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:36,196
- I said one!
- Walk on the wild side.

48
00:05:36,696 --> 00:05:40,116
- You boys still trespassing over there?
- Yup.

49
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:46,539
Hey, they're not even melted yet! Wow!

50
00:05:48,249 --> 00:05:53,588
OK, let's get a board under him. Let's get a
pulse, let's get a blood pressure. I'll get a line.

51
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:55,757
- 80 over 50.
- Keep pumping.

52
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,468
- Ready!
- Clear!

53
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:03,514
Is there a pulse or a blood pressure?
Once more. Now! Is there a pulse?

54
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:05,099
- No pulse.
- Blood pressure?

55
00:06:05,183 --> 00:06:07,602
- No blood pressure.
- Let's call it.

56
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:21,824
Well, what's the word?

57
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:24,327
What's the word on what?

58
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,622
The doctor. You went
to the doctor. What did he say?

59
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:30,250
It's a breeze. Everything's fine.

60
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,378
Hey, wait a minute. Wait right there.

61
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:38,341
This is me you're talking to.

62
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:42,095
Now, you went to the goddamn doctor.
Now, what did he say?

63
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,267
Doctors don't know everything.

64
00:06:55,525 --> 00:07:00,822
Well, there is the one school of thought
that says they don't know nothin'.

65
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:50,580
Well, gentlemen, mission accomplished.

66
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:58,004
- Hope the water isn't too cold.
- You want it heated too?

67
00:07:58,087 --> 00:08:00,173
What about a lifeguard?

68
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:06,638
Well, the marines have landed.

69
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,684
Navy's in.

70
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,856
- Boy, that's cold.
- You're right.

71
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:24,489
Ah, fellas, this is the life.

72
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,085
That'll make your old ball-sack shrivel up.

73
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:51,933
Well, all in all, that was a pretty
damn crappy day at sea, wasn't it, boys?

74
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:55,687
- You stink.
- Me? Come on, man.

75
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,524
- It's the great unknown out there.
- Here. Here's halfyour money.

76
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:01,901
Half? What's this "half"?

77
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:04,571
Bonner, you got my goddamn money now?

78
00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:07,740
I got it right here.
I'll be with you in a second, OK?

79
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:11,369
Cos ifyou ain't got it now,
you're not tyin' up here.

80
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:15,540
Look. I don't wanna get rough with you,
you know? But I'm not takin' half.

81
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:18,251
- Fine. Give it.
- Get your hands off!

82
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:22,839
Just get your ass off my boat, man.
Get your ass off my boat. You believe this?

83
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:26,092
And take your embarrassing
beach towel with you.

84
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:28,928
Can you believe these tourists?

85
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:33,266
The guy throws up on the deck, he doesn't
catch one fish, gives me half my money.

86
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:36,519
- I need a brew. Want something cold?
- Untie the boat line.

87
00:09:36,603 --> 00:09:38,813
No, wait! Don't untie the boat line.

88
00:09:38,897 --> 00:09:43,401
Here you go, you bloodsucker.
I have nothing to live on. Nothing. Zip.

89
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:49,908
Oh, Kirk, come on. You're not actually
gonna take all my money, are you?

90
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:53,786
- You're gonna leave me $5, aren't you, Kirk?
- Not on your life.

91
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,665
Shit! Come on, Kirk.
That money'll bring you no pleasure.

92
00:09:57,749 --> 00:09:59,834
- Could I have a word?
- I promise you!

93
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:03,588
- You just try and sleep tonight.
- I'll sleep like a baby.

94
00:10:04,422 --> 00:10:06,507
Oh, shit!

95
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:18,228
We'd like to rent your boat.

96
00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:20,855
- You what?
- We'd like to rent your boat.

97
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:25,276
We'd like to rent your boat. For 27 days.

98
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:28,530
If that wouldn't be too long for you.

99
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:30,907
No. Yeah!

100
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:34,369
Yeah? 27?

101
00:10:35,036 --> 00:10:38,831
That's my lucky number.
Holy sh... smokes!

102
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:41,793
Hi. Jack Bonner. How you doin'?

103
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:45,046
- Hi, Jack. I'm Walter.
- Hi, Walter. Well, come on.

104
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:52,845
Take a look around. Boat sleeps eight,
so you should be pretty comfortable.

105
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:56,182
If you've got a latitude and a longitude,
I can get you there.

106
00:10:56,266 --> 00:11:01,479
- If you don't, I can still get you there.
- We know a great dive spot. We have a map.

107
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:04,524
Great. Great.

108
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:07,485
Uh... Guess we can talk price later.

109
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:13,116
Oh, that door basically
slides back and forth. It may need some oil.

110
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:18,621
I haven't dusted in a while. But I'm gonna do
a whole cleanup, the whole sanitation thing.

111
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:22,250
If you look at anything closely enough,
you're bound to find flaws.

112
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:26,796
I'm an experienced scuba diver
and tour guide, deep-sea fisherman...

113
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,216
Who will actually eat tonight! Yes!

114
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:40,727
In the kitchen! You're in the kitchen.

115
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:45,982
And my mother went out on the porch,
and she was screaming...

116
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:50,612
- Give it a rest, Rose.
- "You stop teasing your sister!"

117
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:53,740
- Hiya, Grandpa!
- Here's the little fella.

118
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:56,826
- Come right to the courts, do ya?
- It's Thursday.

119
00:11:56,993 --> 00:11:58,953
He knows our schedule.

120
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,498
- Hi!
- Here's David.

121
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:07,879
He's always here.
Does this kid have a home or what?

122
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:11,549
Bernie! His parents are divorced,
his mother works...

123
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:14,969
I'm an orphan.
Do I go around askin' for breaks?

124
00:12:16,012 --> 00:12:19,974
We're goin' swimming later.
We have room left for one little boy.

125
00:12:20,058 --> 00:12:22,852
And we might even have
a swimming suit for you.

126
00:12:22,936 --> 00:12:27,774
- I got mine on.
- Oh, the navy could use men like you.

127
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,700
The prope's been tied up
in an estate now for over three years.

128
00:12:37,784 --> 00:12:42,789
And, of course, they really want to sell.
They're not interested in a long-term lease.

129
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:48,962
We'd just like the place for 26 days.
And we'll take it in as-is condition.

130
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:54,425
We're cousins.
We like to vacation together, informally.

131
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:58,012
As long as there's a swimming pool,
we have everything we need.

132
00:12:58,096 --> 00:13:03,393
Uh, $7500 a month,
plus the pool man and utilities.

133
00:13:03,476 --> 00:13:05,770
We won't be needing the pool man.

134
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:11,025
I prefer to do that myself. They use
so much chlorine. My eyes are very sensitive.

135
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:13,611
- Oh, but they're lovely.
- Thank you.

136
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:19,534
Clubhouse is closed, boys.

137
00:13:19,617 --> 00:13:23,663
Well, maybe they'd give us
permission to use the pool.

138
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:28,209
- We could offer to pay something.
- Wouldn't be fun ifwe had permission.

139
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:54,694
Jack, this is the chart I was telling you about.

140
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:58,323
I estimate our position
is right about here. This point.

141
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:03,036
- I wanna get down right along this fault line.
- Is this land? What is this?

142
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:05,955
This is actually
an underwater-configuration map.

143
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,249
- A heat-sensitive map.
- I've seen these.

144
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,753
- Yeah, it's a brand-new development.
- The Japanese have this.

145
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:14,380
That's right, Jack. The Japanese developed it.

146
00:14:14,464 --> 00:14:17,967
So the point is to head
directly south, right along this line,

147
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:21,179
until we get right here
on the edge of this fault line.

148
00:14:21,262 --> 00:14:24,724
- You can figure that out?
- Yeah. Actually, I've been around here.

149
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:28,603
- Why don't you keep this?
- OK. Go get some sodas and sandwiches.

150
00:14:28,686 --> 00:14:30,772
- Thanks, Jack.
- OK.

151
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:43,826
All right, let's start with line three.

152
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:47,580
- T-O-Z.
- And the next line.

153
00:14:48,248 --> 00:14:50,333
L-P-E-O.

154
00:14:52,544 --> 00:14:54,963
Try the next line.

155
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:03,930
K-O-C...

156
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:11,646
K-O-C-F-E.

157
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:18,027
Uh, sir, do you have another pair of glasses?

158
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:23,032
I don't need any other glasses, young man.
These are my glasses. I can read that fine.

159
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:26,369
Now you just run the pointer, all right?

160
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:31,082
Next line.

161
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,465
- Is there anything on that line you can read?
- No.

162
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:44,178
But, young man, remember,
road signs aren't made that small.

163
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:46,931
I can read road signs.

164
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,810
OK.

165
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:59,068
I don't think it's fair. I've driven everything
on wheels all my life and never had a mishap.

166
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:07,869
Shit. How's your girlfriend?

167
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:12,081
She's not my girlfriend.
She just followed me home that one day.

168
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:14,584
I don't like her at all.

169
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,544
You don't, huh?

170
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:19,214
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

171
00:16:19,297 --> 00:16:21,507
Hi, Mom.

172
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:23,760
- Wanna go out to dinner?
- Yeah!

173
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:27,055
No Italian food. Makes me fart.

174
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:29,557
OK. I'll go get Mom.

175
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:34,062
You know, you're gonna have to make
a friend your own age one of these days.

176
00:16:34,145 --> 00:16:38,149
I don't like the kids my age.
I like to hang around you guys.

177
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,445
Sure you like it here.
There's no pressure, and we baby ya.

178
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:46,699
- More things bother me than other guys.
- Oh, they do, do they?

179
00:16:46,783 --> 00:16:50,995
Trouble with you is, you think too much,
and that's when a guy gets scared.

180
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:56,376
You know, Grandpa, you're right.
I do get scared a lot.

181
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,920
Nobody likes bein' scared.

182
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:30,303
Watch out. Those dolphins look pretty horny.

183
00:18:47,654 --> 00:18:50,782
- This is pretty big.
- Yeah, pretty big.

184
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:55,411
- You need a hand?
- No. No, thanks, Jack. We're doing fine.

185
00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:57,580
Excuse me.

186
00:19:05,171 --> 00:19:08,675
- What the hell is that?
- Who cares?

187
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:14,013
You know, I bet they're dope peddlers.
I bet they made a pick-up out at sea.

188
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:17,934
- It's possible.
- Should we tell somebody?

189
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:20,103
Huh! No!

190
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,529
By golly, if our new neighbours do that,

191
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:33,825
I don't feel bad about sneakin' in
their swimming pool while they're gone.

192
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:36,911
- You think it's safe?
- What are they gonna do, arrest us?

193
00:19:36,995 --> 00:19:42,292
- Look at us. We're three harmless old men.
- Who knows what kind of people they are?

194
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:50,508
You know, I can't remember
the last time I really took a risk.

195
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:56,180
Ben's right. I'm in.

196
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,685
What the hell?

197
00:20:09,027 --> 00:20:11,613
Look at that.

198
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:16,367
The water's really warm.

199
00:20:16,451 --> 00:20:18,536
What the hell are those?

200
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:26,794
Listen to that!

201
00:20:36,137 --> 00:20:38,932
They make me nervous.

202
00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:47,774
If Ben Luckett decides to jump off the Empire
State Building, do you have to do it too?

203
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:50,735
I have my pride.

204
00:21:08,002 --> 00:21:10,255
- I feel great.
- Me too.

205
00:21:11,506 --> 00:21:13,591
You wouldn't bullshit me?

206
00:21:14,717 --> 00:21:16,803
My God, I'm telling the truth!

207
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:21,766
Why shouldn't he feel good?
I feel tremendous!

208
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,477
I'm ready to take on the world!

209
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:29,751
# I'm in the mood for love

210
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:34,255
# Simply because you're near me

211
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:42,096
You get a load of this guy? He'll be
chasin' them dolls till his dick rots off.

212
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,474
I'm too old for that kind of thing.

213
00:22:44,557 --> 00:22:47,393
- Ah, hey, age isn't everything.
- No, no.

214
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,104
- Anyway, it's all up here.
- Oh, sure. Sure.

215
00:22:50,188 --> 00:22:53,858
It's not all up there, pal.
Some of it's down here.

216
00:22:53,942 --> 00:22:56,945
Which, by the way, is hard as a rock.

217
00:22:57,028 --> 00:23:02,450
- You too? You got a boner too?
- Blue steel. Cat couldn't scratch it.

218
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:04,744
I thought I was the only one.

219
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:11,209
# We're in the mood for love

220
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:14,337
# Simply because we've got one

221
00:23:32,272 --> 00:23:34,566
You tired?

222
00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:36,609
Aren't you?

223
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:39,946
I'm wide awake.

224
00:23:40,697 --> 00:23:43,867
- What's wrong?
- Not a thing.

225
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:28,161
Art! It's so late.

226
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:32,373
Are you all right?

227
00:24:32,457 --> 00:24:34,918
# Some enchanted evening

228
00:24:35,668 --> 00:24:38,421
# You may see a stranger

229
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:42,258
# You may see a stranger

230
00:24:42,342 --> 00:24:45,386
# Across a crowded room

231
00:25:05,365 --> 00:25:08,576
- Want a piece of candy, little girl?
- Ben!

232
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,537
Ben!

233
00:25:22,632 --> 00:25:24,717
Pung.

234
00:25:25,677 --> 00:25:27,762
Three. Ghost Dragon.

235
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:34,310
Why is everybody so quiet today?

236
00:25:34,394 --> 00:25:37,105
You're all off in another world, or something.

237
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:39,357
I was just thinking to myself.

238
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:43,027
Me too. I was just thinking.

239
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:49,659
I feel so nice today, I can't tell you.

240
00:26:13,766 --> 00:26:16,227
Joe?

241
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:18,396
Let's go!

242
00:26:21,608 --> 00:26:23,693
- Morning!
- Morning.

243
00:26:29,115 --> 00:26:31,201
Excuse me.

244
00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:38,291
- Do you think there's cocaine in that pool?
- Might be.

245
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,885
- What ifwe OD?
- Well, we'll keep an eye on each other.

246
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:52,513
I'll watch him, you watch him, you watch me.

247
00:26:52,597 --> 00:26:54,682
Perfect.

248
00:28:36,326 --> 00:28:38,494
Hey.

249
00:28:38,578 --> 00:28:42,832
Hi. Looks like you got
these things pretty well covered.

250
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:45,418
Looks airtight.

251
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:48,296
Jack, I can't tell you what's inside there.

252
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:55,094
You know, I'm the captain.

253
00:28:55,637 --> 00:28:59,557
Technically speaking,
I have to know what's in there.

254
00:28:59,641 --> 00:29:02,560
Yeah, but what we're doing
is supposed to be a secret.

255
00:29:02,644 --> 00:29:04,938
Kitty, I took a maritime oath.

256
00:29:05,021 --> 00:29:10,109
A maritime oath! It forbids me
to even reveal your names to anybody.

257
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:15,740
All right, I'll tell you. But you can't let
the others know that I told you anything.

258
00:29:15,823 --> 00:29:20,411
They'd have to torture me.
Not a lot of torture, you know, but some.

259
00:29:23,623 --> 00:29:26,251
Nerita peleronta.

260
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:29,003
- Ner... what?
- Nerita peleronta.

261
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,050
- What is that?
- They're giant snail shells.

262
00:29:38,304 --> 00:29:43,268
They're extremely rare. We're taking them
to the Museum of Ichthyology in Orlando.

263
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:46,646
Oh, really?
Yeah, I've been planning to go there.

264
00:29:46,729 --> 00:29:48,898
I hear it's a great place. A lot offish.

265
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:56,406
Oh, God. Oh, God,
I think it's broken. Goddamn it!

266
00:29:56,489 --> 00:29:59,409
- Let me help you.
- Some ice. Get something cold on it.

267
00:29:59,492 --> 00:30:01,578
- Let me look.
- Do not touch it.

268
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:04,163
- I can help you.
- No, no, no, no!

269
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:15,049
That feels nice.

270
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:21,598
That's amazing.

271
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:27,228
- Kitty, you married?
- No.

272
00:30:27,312 --> 00:30:29,772
- Involved?
- No.

273
00:30:29,856 --> 00:30:32,025
Come on.

274
00:30:32,108 --> 00:30:34,485
Those guys are so good-lookin'.

275
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:40,074
Not Walter, maybe, but... You don't have
anything goin' with one of the young guys?

276
00:30:40,158 --> 00:30:42,869
I'm not involved with anyone.

277
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:44,871
OK.

278
00:30:45,288 --> 00:30:48,750
You know, we could go out
and do something, sometime.

279
00:30:50,418 --> 00:30:53,379
- I don't know if that's such a good idea.
- Why?

280
00:30:54,714 --> 00:30:58,843
- I'm not like the other women you've known.
- That's good news.

281
00:31:03,765 --> 00:31:07,810
You're makin' me very curious about you.

282
00:31:07,894 --> 00:31:11,481
Well, what if I trusted you
with something very private?

283
00:31:11,564 --> 00:31:15,860
Oh, I can keep a secret. I wouldn't
tell anybody. Not even our kids.

284
00:31:20,031 --> 00:31:23,326
Look, I don't know what you're thinkin'.

285
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:31,376
But ifyou're thinkin' that
I'm just out to nail you, that's not it at all.

286
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:34,671
I'd just like to get to know you,
as a human being.

287
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:42,762
OK. I'll see you in the morning, all right?

288
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:45,014
What?

289
00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:51,062
Yeah, I got some things to do too.

290
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:00,864
They didn't give you any other
medication atallover at the home, huh?

291
00:32:00,947 --> 00:32:03,116
Not a thing, Doc.

292
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:09,956
Well, Joe, I gotta tell you, I have never seen
anything like this before in my life! It's a...

293
00:32:10,373 --> 00:32:13,793
Well, it's a miracle! It's a complete remission.

294
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:20,383
I just love to see you eat your words, Doc.

295
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:23,636
- Want to arm wrestle?
- No!

296
00:32:25,013 --> 00:32:27,098
How about that?!

297
00:32:55,627 --> 00:32:58,880
- Alma's not gonna believe this.
- You've got 'em? Ah!

298
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,216
Come on. Let's go, shall we?

299
00:33:20,652 --> 00:33:23,863
I'm gonna go ahead and assume goodwill.

300
00:33:23,947 --> 00:33:26,491
I'm gonna assume mental illness.

301
00:33:26,574 --> 00:33:29,994
Oh, Bernie. I didn't expect it.
It's such a surprise!

302
00:33:30,078 --> 00:33:34,207
- I don't know how to do it. I didn't buy it.
- It's just beautiful.

303
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,841
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
We start our second session of dancing now.

304
00:33:44,092 --> 00:33:48,930
Our first tune is a special
arrangement of "Dancing in the Dark".

305
00:33:49,013 --> 00:33:51,099
Let's waste no time.

306
00:34:27,176 --> 00:34:30,096
- Why don't we dance?
- What? Oh, sure!

307
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:52,452
Oh, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie,
what am I going to do with you?

308
00:34:52,535 --> 00:34:55,413
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.

309
00:34:55,496 --> 00:34:59,959
- Well, you're not gonna dance with me.
- That's for sure. That's for sure.

310
00:35:03,004 --> 00:35:05,256
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

311
00:35:09,511 --> 00:35:12,555
- You're a wonderful dancer.
- I think so!

312
00:35:13,723 --> 00:35:15,808
I'm very happy, Bess.

313
00:35:16,768 --> 00:35:19,604
Everything's happening so fast.

314
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:24,359
- Are you talking about last night?
- No, no. Last night was fine.

315
00:35:24,442 --> 00:35:26,528
Fine?

316
00:35:26,611 --> 00:35:28,780
More than fine! Terrific!

317
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:32,450
I was talking in general.

318
00:35:32,534 --> 00:35:37,455
Well, in general,
I think we're having a great time!

319
00:35:38,915 --> 00:35:41,000
Yes, we are.

320
00:35:42,627 --> 00:35:45,255
Will you still love me
when I can't keep up with you?

321
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:48,925
Of course. I love you now,
and you can't keep up with me.

322
00:35:49,008 --> 00:35:51,094
You are a pain in the ass!

323
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:10,530
"There's gonna be a problem
in the fuel-injection system if..."

324
00:36:10,947 --> 00:36:13,032
What does this do?

325
00:36:44,939 --> 00:36:48,401
Reduced to a goddamn
Peeping Tom now, Bonner?

326
00:36:48,484 --> 00:36:50,570
It's embarrassing.

327
00:37:55,468 --> 00:37:56,678
Holy shit!

328
00:38:16,155 --> 00:38:17,907
Look...

329
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:20,785
What's the problem, Jack?

330
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:22,745
She's not normal.

331
00:38:24,747 --> 00:38:28,209
There's something very abnormal about her.

332
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,134
Come on, come on, come on...

333
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,763
Son of a bitch.

334
00:38:51,608 --> 00:38:54,360
Come on. Start! Go! Come on!

335
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,158
I've had all kinds of people on this boat.
All kinds! From all races! Come on...

336
00:39:00,241 --> 00:39:02,619
All nationalities! All creeds!

337
00:39:03,828 --> 00:39:07,123
Oh, my God, I can't believe it! It won't start!

338
00:39:13,671 --> 00:39:15,840
Oh, my God.

339
00:39:29,938 --> 00:39:34,651
It's... It's hard to know who to trust.
Isn't it, Jack?

340
00:39:37,695 --> 00:39:39,781
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, God!

341
00:39:54,462 --> 00:39:57,382
I'm in the water, far from shore.

342
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:00,635
It's at night.

343
00:40:00,718 --> 00:40:03,346
They got my boat. Shit.

344
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:06,558
Oh, my God!

345
00:40:13,064 --> 00:40:15,984
Good to see you again, Jack.
Let me give you a hand.

346
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:19,320
I don't want your hand. Get back! Get back!

347
00:40:19,404 --> 00:40:21,823
You get back!

348
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:30,373
Oh, no. Just put the towel down.

349
00:40:31,457 --> 00:40:33,960
Just put it down and back away, please.

350
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:41,551
I'm sure you're bothered
by what you saw, but relax...

351
00:40:41,634 --> 00:40:44,137
- I don't wanna relax!
- Why not let us explain?

352
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,764
Cos I don't wanna know anything.

353
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,976
And ifyou try to eat my face off,
or take over my body,

354
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:54,189
you're gonna be very sorry, mister.
You're gonna be very sorry!

355
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,357
Face-eating, Jack?

356
00:40:56,733 --> 00:41:00,653
I've never heard of that.
Is that some sort of delicacy?

357
00:41:00,737 --> 00:41:03,198
No. Forget I ever mentioned it.

358
00:41:03,698 --> 00:41:06,451
- Are you sure I shouldn't try it, Jack?
- I'm positive.

359
00:41:06,534 --> 00:41:08,912
Walter, Jack is our friend. Right, Jack?

360
00:41:08,995 --> 00:41:12,540
Friend... Friend! That's right.
Friend. 100%. I'm your friend.

361
00:41:12,624 --> 00:41:14,959
That's all I ever wanted to be. Your friend.

362
00:41:15,043 --> 00:41:18,588
- But we do owe you an explanation.
- No, you don't owe me anything.

363
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:22,300
You don't...
Not even for the boat, honestly. It's free.

364
00:41:23,134 --> 00:41:26,513
Jack. Of course we're gonna
pay you for the boat. We're honest.

365
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:31,226
Well, of course you're honest!
Did I ever accuse you of being dishonest?

366
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:35,021
I accused you of being from another planet.
But an honest planet.

367
00:41:35,104 --> 00:41:37,482
Jack. Jack, sit down.

368
00:41:37,565 --> 00:41:39,901
- I don't wanna sit down.
- Jack, sit!

369
00:41:45,573 --> 00:41:49,536
Now, Jack,
I want you to listen to me very carefully.

370
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:53,957
We're Antareans.
We come from a planet called Antarea.

371
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,251
Yeah, that's what I pretty much figured.

372
00:41:56,334 --> 00:42:00,505
100 centuries ago, we had an outpost
here on Earth, before the first upheaval.

373
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:03,633
- Well, I think I'm better off not knowing.
- Shh.

374
00:42:05,051 --> 00:42:08,221
We were able to evacuate everyone
except for my ground crew.

375
00:42:08,304 --> 00:42:11,641
- Ground crew?
- And now we've come back for them.

376
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:20,733
Boy. I thought I'd been around. Nothing
like this has ever happened to me before.

377
00:42:20,817 --> 00:42:23,653
Now, Jack, you could turn us in.

378
00:42:24,654 --> 00:42:28,157
Or you could do something else
to make things difficult for us.

379
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:32,662
But believe me, Jack,
we will still get our friends back.

380
00:42:32,745 --> 00:42:38,209
And the only thing that would happen is that
we'd end up renting someone else's boat.

381
00:42:46,426 --> 00:42:50,722
You know, I got left behind once.
It was in Coney Island. I was nine.

382
00:42:51,848 --> 00:42:56,186
It was pretty heavy for a nine-year-old.
My parents finally came back for me.

383
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:58,521
Of course. And now we've come back.

384
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,817
- So you're comin' back for your friends?
- Exactly.

385
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:08,031
Jack, this is the most
important thing we've ever done.

386
00:43:12,994 --> 00:43:15,538
You're not gonna hurt me, are you, Walt?

387
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,125
All we need to do
is to get our friends and leave.

388
00:43:20,168 --> 00:43:22,837
And go... pfft?

389
00:43:22,921 --> 00:43:26,508
- Yes. Pfft.
- Right. Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.

390
00:43:28,218 --> 00:43:31,888
- None of this is bad for America, I guess?
- Of course not.

391
00:43:34,933 --> 00:43:37,435
Well, damn it, I'm in.

392
00:43:38,895 --> 00:43:41,189
This... This is incredible.

393
00:43:42,106 --> 00:43:45,151
Right. Now, nothing's gonna fall off, is it?

394
00:43:45,235 --> 00:43:47,111
No.

395
00:43:47,695 --> 00:43:50,156
- Come on, Mr Lefkowitz.
- You'll love it.

396
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,244
- You'll be a new man, Bernie, believe me.
- Remember, I said I'd look.

397
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:57,914
- I'm not promising I'll get wet.
- Fine. Just look.

398
00:43:57,997 --> 00:44:01,376
By the way, right here
is where a crime is being committed.

399
00:44:01,459 --> 00:44:03,711
Not by me, because I'm being carried.

400
00:44:03,795 --> 00:44:06,714
Don't you worry, Bernie.
We'll take the fall for you.

401
00:44:06,798 --> 00:44:10,718
Fall? That's another thing.
I fall, I break my hip, I can't sue anybody.

402
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:19,310
- It's nice and warm, Bernie.
- They're rocks.

403
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,647
What are rocks doing in a pool?

404
00:44:24,524 --> 00:44:28,152
In an ocean, fine.
There I expect to see plenty of rocks.

405
00:44:28,236 --> 00:44:30,613
But in a pool? No.

406
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:40,999
Hah! Cowardly cowardly custard!

407
00:44:41,082 --> 00:44:43,167
Can't cut the mustard!

408
00:44:44,502 --> 00:44:47,005
Come on, Bernie!

409
00:44:52,385 --> 00:44:55,263
And it's Joe... Joe taking the lead...

410
00:44:55,346 --> 00:44:59,934
Come on! Come on, navy! Come on!

411
00:45:00,018 --> 00:45:03,688
Come on, you worn-out old pusses!
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig!

412
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,024
I'll see you tomorrow.

413
00:45:10,987 --> 00:45:14,157
Hey, fellas? Fellas, fellas, hey!

414
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,492
Somebody's comin'. Let's get out!

415
00:45:16,993 --> 00:45:19,704
Let's get out of here.
Come on! Let's go. Come on!

416
00:45:19,787 --> 00:45:23,249
- Come on. Get a move on.
- Come on. In here.

417
00:47:25,705 --> 00:47:28,333
- Out of the way!
- Let's move!

418
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:31,044
- Jesus!
- Let's move!

419
00:47:31,127 --> 00:47:33,671
Come on, open the fuckin' door.

420
00:47:33,755 --> 00:47:36,132
Let's go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

421
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,440
I begged you not to go.

422
00:47:52,524 --> 00:47:56,528
You've got to do something.
There are things from outer space next door.

423
00:47:56,611 --> 00:48:01,074
You gents keep suckin' on that oxygen.
They'll probably go back to their own planet.

424
00:48:01,157 --> 00:48:04,285
- Get the police, you idiots.
- Hey, look.

425
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:09,332
I'm not callin' no cops because a couple of
geezers saw some people from outer space.

426
00:48:09,415 --> 00:48:13,753
If my husband said he saw people from
outer space, they were from outer space!

427
00:48:13,836 --> 00:48:16,464
- Get the goddamn police!
- OK.

428
00:48:19,425 --> 00:48:22,011
Call the police. Whoo!

429
00:48:26,307 --> 00:48:30,478
They must have concocted
this crazy story to cover themselves.

430
00:48:30,562 --> 00:48:36,109
Spacemen, you say? That's wonderful! Well,
we'll all be that old someday. If we're lucky.

431
00:48:36,192 --> 00:48:40,738
Yeah. Well, we're gonna shoot on over to the
home and straighten this whole thing out.

432
00:48:40,822 --> 00:48:43,449
I wouldn't be too hard on 'em. Just tell 'em,

433
00:48:43,533 --> 00:48:48,037
as long as they're willing to respect our
privacy in future, we won't press charges.

434
00:48:48,121 --> 00:48:51,291
- We'll keep 'em on their side of the fence.
- Thank you.

435
00:48:51,374 --> 00:48:53,459
My pleasure. Bye-bye.

436
00:49:00,466 --> 00:49:03,595
Well, I guess we shouldn't be greedy about it.

437
00:49:04,596 --> 00:49:07,765
We're better off than before we found it.

438
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:10,810
Bess said we should
take it to The NationalEnquirer.

439
00:49:10,894 --> 00:49:13,229
They pay money for this kind of story.

440
00:49:13,313 --> 00:49:15,398
I wish I had the guts to go in.

441
00:49:16,441 --> 00:49:20,862
Yeah. Boy, I wish
I never even knew about this place.

442
00:49:40,131 --> 00:49:42,217
Oh. What time is it?

443
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,385
Just after four.

444
00:50:27,178 --> 00:50:30,932
I'm gonna go talk to him.
Goddamn, it's ridiculous.

445
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:56,624
Hey, Walter.

446
00:50:58,376 --> 00:51:00,837
Well, I'm not surprised you're here.

447
00:51:02,505 --> 00:51:05,925
There's something in that pool
a friend of ours just has to have.

448
00:51:06,009 --> 00:51:09,179
Matter offact,
there's a few of us could use a little of it.

449
00:51:09,262 --> 00:51:14,225
We don't care who you are, where you've
been, what you're doin', what you're up to.

450
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:16,394
Sure need that pool.

451
00:51:18,313 --> 00:51:23,610
Look, Ben, I know you're
just trying to help your people.

452
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,405
Well, I'm trying to help mine.

453
00:51:28,364 --> 00:51:32,493
No, see, my friend Joe Finley, he's got cancer.

454
00:51:36,664 --> 00:51:38,750
I'm trying to save his life.

455
00:51:39,959 --> 00:51:42,504
I'm trying to save 20 lives.

456
00:51:42,587 --> 00:51:44,672
And I'm running out of time.

457
00:51:50,261 --> 00:51:53,097
No son of a bitch
has to know we're in that pool.

458
00:51:53,181 --> 00:51:58,520
We'll just be a few old farts paddlin'
around in that pool. Who's gonna know?

459
00:52:11,908 --> 00:52:16,287
Every ten or eleven thousand years or so,
I make a terrible mistake.

460
00:52:17,705 --> 00:52:23,211
The last one was when I picked what
you call Atlantis as our base here on Earth.

461
00:52:23,294 --> 00:52:27,173
Everyone else said use the North Pole.
I said "No, too cold."

462
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,635
Sinking never occurred to me.

463
00:52:31,135 --> 00:52:33,721
You're gonna let us use the pool, aren't you?

464
00:52:33,805 --> 00:52:36,599
You won't touch those cocoons?

465
00:52:36,683 --> 00:52:38,768
No. No, I swear.

466
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:44,566
Use the pool.

467
00:52:46,651 --> 00:52:48,820
Thank you. Thank you!

468
00:52:56,327 --> 00:53:00,748
- I, for one, don't believe this alien crap at all.
- You don't believe your husband?

469
00:53:00,832 --> 00:53:04,669
- No.
- I believe Joe. I believe him and I'm scared.

470
00:53:04,752 --> 00:53:08,840
- I don't believe it and I'm still scared.
- I guess I'm just less gullible.

471
00:53:08,923 --> 00:53:12,844
Mary, you have your nerve!
I have more horse sense than you ever had.

472
00:53:12,927 --> 00:53:16,890
Ladies, ladies. Let's just go
and see for ourselves. Come on.

473
00:53:17,182 --> 00:53:20,185
All right. Let's meet the aliens!

474
00:53:20,268 --> 00:53:24,189
I hate to go visiting without
a plate of cookies or a box of candy.

475
00:53:24,272 --> 00:53:26,941
- We're going home.
- Will you cut it out, Bernie?

476
00:53:27,025 --> 00:53:30,195
- We have permission, don't we?
- Those people aren't people.

477
00:53:30,278 --> 00:53:33,448
- I'm not gonna have anything to do with 'em.
- Oh, pipe down.

478
00:53:33,531 --> 00:53:36,075
You're playin' with fire over there.

479
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:38,870
I'm a citizen. I believe in this country.

480
00:53:38,953 --> 00:53:42,582
I'm thinkin' of blowin' a whistle
on the whole deal. Come on, Rose.

481
00:53:42,665 --> 00:53:45,418
- Stop right there.
- Oh, what. What?

482
00:53:45,501 --> 00:53:49,297
- Stop thinkin' about yourself. This is for Joe.
- Joe?

483
00:53:49,881 --> 00:53:52,842
Is Joe above the law? Are any of us?

484
00:53:53,718 --> 00:53:59,849
- In 1948, Dutch Schultz walked into my store.
- Bernie. Bernie, shut up!

485
00:53:59,933 --> 00:54:03,978
- Let me tell you about what Dutch said.
- Bernie. Bernie!

486
00:54:04,395 --> 00:54:09,442
If you don't wanna do this for Rose, ifyou
don't wanna do it for yourself, that's fine.

487
00:54:09,817 --> 00:54:13,446
- But ifyou screw it up for us...
- Don't threaten me, Joe.

488
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:17,700
Bernie, please.
Let her come with us. Just this once.

489
00:54:18,034 --> 00:54:22,914
No, no. Never. Rose and I
will never set foot over there again.

490
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:25,708
Nature dealt us a hand of cards.
We play them.

491
00:54:25,792 --> 00:54:30,713
Now, at the end of the game, suddenly
you're lookin' to reshuffle the deck? Huh?

492
00:54:30,797 --> 00:54:34,217
Oh, come on, Rose. Come on, let's go.

493
00:54:44,269 --> 00:54:46,980
Anybody have second thoughts?

494
00:54:48,314 --> 00:54:50,984
- Not me.
- I'm a citizen too.

495
00:54:51,943 --> 00:54:55,738
I was in the navy.
I don't see anything wrong with it.

496
00:54:55,989 --> 00:55:01,202
Then you drive. I got no licence.

497
00:55:29,105 --> 00:55:32,984
# How wouldyou like
to spend the weekendin Havana?

498
00:55:38,781 --> 00:55:43,119
Are your extraterrestrials
gonna make a personal appearance?

499
00:55:43,203 --> 00:55:45,622
Hey, Pills! Come on in!

500
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:50,376
Hi, Pillsbury. How you doin', pal?

501
00:55:50,877 --> 00:55:53,630
You'll like Pillsbury. He's a fine fella.

502
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,805
Adios, Pillsbury!

503
00:56:06,976 --> 00:56:09,479
All right. Let's start here.

504
00:56:09,771 --> 00:56:12,023
P-E-Z-O-L-C-F-T-D.

505
00:56:15,902 --> 00:56:18,071
Sir, what line are you reading?

506
00:56:18,363 --> 00:56:21,866
The bottom one.
We're in a little bit of a hurry, OK?

507
00:56:40,593 --> 00:56:43,388
Look, look! We've gotta go into the club.

508
00:58:12,101 --> 00:58:14,187
Hello, Grandpa.

509
00:58:18,274 --> 00:58:21,027
Hey, look at the old fogies.

510
00:58:23,196 --> 00:58:25,281
Off the floor, Grandpa.

511
00:59:24,048 --> 00:59:27,135
...requiring weekend
transportation to St Petersburg,

512
