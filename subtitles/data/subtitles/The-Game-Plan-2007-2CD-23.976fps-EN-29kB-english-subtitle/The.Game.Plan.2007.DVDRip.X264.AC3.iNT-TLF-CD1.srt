1
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,000
All right, all right. All right, all right.

2
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,700
Never

3
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,100
say

4
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,300
no.

5
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,700
Well, this is Kingman's
defining moment, Marv.

6
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,400
If they win, they guarantee themselves
a spot in the playoffs.

7
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,900
Everybody get on the King's back

8
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,700
and I'm going to lead you
to the promised land.

9
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,000
- All right? On one, on one. Ready?
- Break!

10
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,200
Go deep.
Watch your left!

11
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,300
Let's go!

12
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,100
Pick him up. Pick him up.

13
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,900
Sanders. Sanders.

14
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,600
Go wide!

15
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,000
Hut-hut!

16
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,000
Hut!

17
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,300
<i>All right, here's
Kingman. Drops back in the pocket.</i>

18
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,500
<i>He's got Sanders wide open
in the end zone.</i>

19
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,600
<i>Kingman is on the run.
He's inside the five.</i>

20
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,300
<i>He stiff-arms. It's the Kingman swing.</i>

21
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
<i>And he is in! Touchdown, Rebels.
They've won it.</i>

22
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,500
<i>What a
tremendous play by Kingman, Marv.</i>

23
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,900
<i>But I have to wonder,
yesterday he was...</i>

24
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,900
The King does it again!

25
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,300
- Go Joe!
- Go Joe!

26
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,300
- Never say no!
- Never say no!

27
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Yeah!

28
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,800
<i>WZPZ FM.</i>

29
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,100
<i>Hey, Boston. Happy New Year.
And a special shout out to our Rebels.</i>

30
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,700
<i>Don't party too hard, boys.</i>

31
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,600
<i>You're going to need all your strength
to bring home that championship.</i>

32
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,200
- Enjoy your drink.
- To us.

33
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,300
Hope it's okay.

34
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,800
I'm telling you guys,
these aren't the normal onion rings.

35
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,800
They got garlic and mint leaves.
I mean, like, beluga caviar.

36
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,100
Hey, Coop. Coop, check it out.

37
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,300
- See the hottie? 12 o'clock, tan dress?
- Oh, yeah.

38
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
I think she said
you have a killer smile, bro.

39
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,400
I do.

40
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,800
You should go talk to her.

41
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,900
- You think so?
- I know so. Come on.

42
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,100
Get in there. Get in there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, swamp mouth.

43
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,000
Use some of this. Chicks dig it.

44
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,500
- Webber, you got a pen?
- Why?

45
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,400
Because you might want
to take some notes.

46
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,300
What's up?

47
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,600
Webber!

48
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,800
I told you, they bumped up shoot.
I have to catch last flight to Paris.

49
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,800
But Tatianna will miss you.

50
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,300
The King doesn't want his queen
to miss him too much.

51
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,500
So I got you a little something special.

52
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,400
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

53
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,100
Tatianna, Tatianna. Which one?
Which one?

54
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,600
No peeking.

55
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,400
Dreams are on Joe tonight, honey.

56
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,000
Happy New Year.

57
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,600
- Channel?
- Or Chanel.

58
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,300
Whoa, Sanders.
Where you going?

59
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,000
Just past your bedtime?

60
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,400
Yeah, well, you know,
it's New Year's Eve.

61
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,600
Want to go home,
hug the wife, kiss the kids.

62
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,300
All right, thanks for coming.
Happy New Year.

63
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
- All right, Happy New Year.
- All right, see you at practice.

64
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,700
All right, see you.

65
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,100
All right, Joe. Come on, it's real funny.

66
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,600
Now, just give me back the wallet,
all right?

67
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,700
I'm looking to confiscate
Sanders' man card,

68
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,200
but his wife, Maria,
has already done it.

69
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,200
- Yes, really...
- Come on. Get a life, Sanders.

70
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, you call this "life"?
That ain't life, Joe.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,700
Oh, you call this "life"?
That ain't life, Joe.

72
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,900
- Whatever.
- He's mad. That was funny, man.

73
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,400
- Who's ready to party?
- I am.

74
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,900
Party!

75
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,400
Yeah!

76
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,700
Where can I get a man card?

77
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,300
- Why? The night is still young!
- We can walk Spike.

78
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,000
- Play the guitars, Joe. Come on.
- We were just bonding.

79
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,500
- I love that idea.
- We're starting to jell.

80
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,100
- Call me.
- Joe...

81
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,100
We were doing so good.

82
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,600
Hey, Spike. There's my boy.
Haven't seen you all night.

83
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,700
Do you know who the greatest
quarterback of all time is?

84
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,000
Just checking. Let's go! Huddle up!

85
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,400
Can you feel it? Can you smell it?
Do you believe it?

86
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Z- slant Mississippi! On three. Ready?
Break! Hut! Hut! Hut!

87
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,000
Come on, Spike.
We need a football biscuit.

88
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
Oh, that's a good one.
Oh, this is a good one.

89
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,000
Kingman drops back, he's...
Oh, defenders are coming around.

90
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,400
Post pattern, Spike. Post pattern.

91
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,900
He throws.

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,700
Touchdown! They're going crazy.

93
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
Crazy.

94
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,600
<i>Gracias, Rosa. Enjoy your vacation.</i>

95
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
What do you want to do, Spike?
What do you want to do today?

96
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,400
It's a new year.

97
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,400
You want to play football?
You want to go for a walk?

98
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,500
You want to watch the new ESPN
special profile on Joe Kingman?

99
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,000
I know you do. Me, too. Watch. Watch.
Here we go.

100
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,500
Attaboy.

101
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,000
<i>Blessed with crazy strength and
ridiculous agility...</i>

102
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Ridiculous.

103
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,200
<i>...Joe Kingman could have succeeded
on talent alone.</i>

104
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,000
<i>But what really sets
this future hall-of-famer apart</i>

105
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,700
<i>is his passion for the game.</i>

106
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,600
<i>And no one sums it up better
than Joe himself.</i>

107
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,800
<i>- Wait a minute, that's not what I said.
- Listen, listen.</i>

108
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,900
<i>- What I said was this. Life...
- Life...</i>

109
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
<i>...holds many pleasures for me.
... holds many pleasures for me.</i>

110
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,600
<i>- But...
- But...</i>

111
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,200
<i>...nothing...
... nothing...</i>

112
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,200
<i>...nothing beats the thrill...
... nothing beats the thrill...</i>

113
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,100
<i>...of playing on that field...
... of playing on that field...</i>

114
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
<i>...every Sunday.
... every Sunday.</i>

115
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,800
<i>- Football is my life.
- Football is my life.</i>

116
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,300
<i>- Beyond the field...
- Beyond the field...</i>

117
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,700
<i>...nothing else matters.
... nothing else matters. Watch this.</i>

118
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
<i>Nothing.</i>

119
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,200
<i>If nothing else really matters,</i>

120
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,700
<i>why does that championship ring
elude Kingman?</i>

121
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,200
<i>Some of the experts say
it's because he's too selfish.</i>

122
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,500
<i>I mean, think about it...</i>

123
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,500
How does that sound, Stuey?

124
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,900
<i>Joe, you're a 30-something now,
not a 20-something.</i>

125
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,700
<i>The clock is ticking, Joe.
Ticking on your career.</i>

126
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,100
Blah, blah, blah...

127
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,100
You come talk to me when you have
your own action figure, Stuey.

128
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
<i>- Yeah?
Pardon me, Mr. Kingman.</i>

129
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,600
I have a visitor here at reception.

130
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,800
<i>- A Peyton Kelly, sir.
- I don't know any Peytons.</i>

131
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,500
A young lady.

132
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,600
- Is she cute?
- Oh, exceedingly so, sir.

133
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,900
Well, what are you waiting for, Larry?
Send her up.

134
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,800
He never says "no. "

135
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,200
I am the king. Thank you very much.

136
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,900
Hmm.

137
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,600
Look out.

138
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,800
Hello.

139
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,500
- Goodbye.
Hey!

140
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,100
Look, kid, I don't do Girl Scout cookies,
okay?

141
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,500
You don't get abs like these

142
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,100
eating Peanut Butter Patties,
you know?

143
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,100
Go ahead, hit me. Come on!
Give it a shot. Come on.

144
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,900
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

145
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,300
Bye-bye.

146
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,400
It's ridiculous.

147
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,300
I don't know what it is you're selling.
Look what I have, here's a hundo.

148
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,500
I don't want any money. I want...

149
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,400
I know. I know what you want. I get it.
It's what the world wants.

150
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,800
An autograph of Joe Kingman.
They all want it, eight to 80.

151
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,500
You'll probably go sell it,
but I'm going to give it to you for free.

152
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,700
Because I'm Joe Kingman,
humanitarian.

153
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,000
Happy New Year. I'll be right back.

154
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,800
You have a bulldog. Come here, boy.

155
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,500
You're so cute.

156
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,900
Easy, easy.
He's a very vicious attack dog.

157
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,900
Yeah. He's going to lick me to death.

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,200
Listen, you just can't come walking
into strangers' homes like this.

159
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,500
There are a lot of weirdos out there
in the world.

160
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
- Didn't your mom ever teach you that?
- Yeah.

161
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,100
- Well, where is she?
- On an airplane.

162
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,400
On an airplane?
Well, who are you here with?

163
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
My father.

164
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,400
Well, you better go get him,
because I'm sure he's looking for you.

165
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,600
- He's not looking for me.
- How do you know?

166
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Because he's looking at me.

167
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,300
What?

168
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,300
Hi, we've never met before.
You were married to my mom, Sara.

169
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,800
Sara Kelly?

170
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,200
My name is Peyton. I'm your daughter.

171
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,400
No. No. Nope. No!

172
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,300
No. Time out.
Sara and I never had a kid.

173
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,500
- She wrote you a note.
- Wrote me a note.

174
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,100
"Joe, I know this is a big surprise,
but Peyton is your daughter.

175
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,800
"I need you to watch her for a month.
It's an emergency.

176
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,100
"I'll explain everything
when I get back. Sara. "

177
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,500
You sure got a lot of pictures
of yourself in here.

178
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,800
You expect me to believe
you're my kid, based on this?

179
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,900
- Anybody could have written this.
- Oh, yeah.

180
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,600
I've also got this.
It's my birth certificate.

181
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,400
Birth certificate?

182
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,400
- Your name is on it.
- My name is...

183
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,800
My name?

184
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,000
Awesome!

185
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,400
<i>Ready? Break!</i>

186
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,500
My name's not on this.

187
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,500
"Joseph Kingman. "

188
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,300
<i>Hut! Hut! Hut!</i>

189
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,800
<i>- We've got a situation.
- Touchdown!</i>

190
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,800
Fix it.

191
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,700
Oh!

192
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Don't you think
you should have told me about this?

193
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,500
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know you had an ex-wife?

194
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,600
That was a long time ago.
We were crazy in love, but too young.

195
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,600
Didn't even last longer than a year,
and we never had a baby.

196
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,300
Okay, but for argument's sake,

197
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,600
is there the teeniest, tiniest possibility
that this child could be yours?

198
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,800
Think hard.

199
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,200
I don't know.

200
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
We got the separation,
the divorce was final,

201
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,700
she came by to pick up
a few of her things and then we...

202
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,900
We...

203
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,400
Is anyone else hungry?

204
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
- Hungry?
- Joe...

205
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,800
When did this, "We... We...
Is anyone else hungry" happen?

206
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,100
About eight, nine years ago.

207
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,100
- How old are you, kid?
- Eight.

208
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,600
Congratulations, Joe.

209
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,200
This isn't happening to me.

210
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,600
Muffin, just talk to your Auntie Stella.

211
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,800
Hmm?

212
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,200
It says here that your mom
is not coming back for a month.

213
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,700
She's on her way to Africa.

214
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,600
What kind of a selfish,
self-centered person dumps their kid...

215
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,100
She's on a water sanitation project
bringing fresh drinking water

216
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,100
to the drought-ravaged children
of the Sudan.

217
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,600
If I had a dime
for every time I heard that one.

218
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,200
So on her way to save the world,

219
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,800
your mom just suddenly decided
to leave you here?

220
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,600
I begged her. I said,
"Well, why don't I stay with my father?"

221
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,000
And she said, "Well, baby, he doesn't
know about you yet. " And I said...

222
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,700
I get it. I get it.
So, who else can you stay with?

223
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,100
I got it. I got it. I'm a genius.

224
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,600
Sara has a sister.

225
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,200
Goombah, Grip, Grime... Carmen!

226
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,500
- Karen.
- Karen. What about her?

227
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,800
She's...

228
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,200
She's dead.

229
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,200
Oh, that's convenient.

230
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,100
What?

231
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,400
How do we get in touch
with your mom?

232
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
- Her cell won't work in Kassala.
- Email?

233
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,400
They don't have Internet there.

234
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,100
How did you get here again?

235
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,900
We flew to Boston together,
and then she put me in a car.

236
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,900
And the car just magically
dropped you off at some man's house?

237
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,100
- Not some man. My father.
- So you say.

238
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,100
- Want a paternity test?
- Yes. That's a great idea.

239
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,100
Let's do that. No problem.

240
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,800
I don't like needles.
So if they don't take blood, no problem.

241
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,000
Not in the middle of negotiating
our Fanny's deal, it's not.

242
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,300
These things never stay quiet,
trust me.

243
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,600
If she does turn out to be yours,

244
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,500
you'll look like a guy
who had a kid and ditched her

245
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,100
and you can
kiss your mega-bucks goodbye.

246
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,700
- Stella.
- Hmm.

247
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,700
We don't even look alike.

248
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,800
Oh, no. Not at all.

249
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,100
- Thanks a lot for the heads up, Larry.
- Hey, I told you she was cute.

250
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,400
I'm late.

251
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,500
Let's go. No huddle.

252
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,800
- No back seat.
- So what? Get in the car.

253
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,200
If you get in an accident,
the air bag will hurt me.

254
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,200
Oh, come on, I don't have time
for the safety lesson, please!

255
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,900
Come here.

256
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,000
So late.

257
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,500
I've got four weeks
to make up for eight years,

258
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
so let's get started, shall we?

259
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,300
I'm going to ask you some questions

260
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,600
and you're going to give me
some answers, okay?

261
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,200
Now, for example,

262
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,700
if you asked me what my favorite thing
to do was, I would say ballet.

263
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
So what's your favorite thing to do?

264
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,000
That's easy. Play football.

265
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Football.

266
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,500
Come on!

267
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,000
If you could only save one thing
in a fire, what would it be?

268
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,100
My Heisman.

269
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,000
No, wait... I know.

270
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,200
My limited edition
Joe Kingman sneakers.

271
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,700
Come on, horseradish.
No more questions.

272
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,600
Just one more question.

273
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,900
What's the best thing
that's ever happened to you?

274
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,400
Listen, I got a question for you.

275
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,200
Why didn't your mom
just bring you here herself?

276
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,700
Want a cookie?

277
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,100
No, I don't want a cookie.
Stop trying to change the subject.

278
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,000
But you said you were hungry.

279
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,700
- And I made them special for you.
- Fine, fine.

280
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,300
- Now, about your mom.
- I told you, it was last-minute.

281
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,700
I just can't believe that the Sara I knew

282
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,500
would just let her daughter
show up at my doorstep alone.

283
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,500
I know what happened.

284
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,900
- You do?
- Yeah.

285
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,400
- She's gained a lot of weight.
- No.

286
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,000
What's she pushing now? About 180?

287
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,200
Deuce?

288
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,900
Let's go.

289
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,500
What do you think, you're some
roaming free safety or something?

290
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,100
This is "cover-two," little lady,
so stay close.

291
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
Are you okay?

292
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,800
Do I sound okay?
What did you put in those cookies?

293
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,400
- Milk, flour, eggs and cinnamon...
- Cinnamon!

294
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,000
Cinnamon? I'm allergic to cinnamon.

295
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,700
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- All you got to say is, "I'm sorry"?

296
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,700
I sound like this, "I'm sorry"?
Cinnamon!

297
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,900
I'm allergic to nuts.

298
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,200
Joe. Joe, don't forget I got that
publicity shoot set up for you today.

299
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,400
- You have to be there this time.
- I'll be there.

300
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,000
What do you think,
I'm stupid or something?

301
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,800
Stop touching me.

302
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,800
Stop eating so much.

303
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,300
- You're late, Joe. That's a $500 fine.
- Start a tab.

304
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,900
Hey, sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

305
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,700
King's here, Danville. I got it.
King's here.

306
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Get a submarine sandwich
and a diet soda.

307
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,000
All right, let's go. Sixty-six seam,
slot left on three, on three. Ready?

308
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,100
All right, let's go. Sixty-six seam,
slot left on three, on three. Ready?

309
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,900
Suffering succotash,
Sylvester,

310
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,500
something seems to be wrong
with your mouth.

311
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,400
I said sixty-six, slot seam left on three.
On three. Ready?

312
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,800
Hey, Joe.
Looks like you got a rogue fan.

313
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,600
- I'm not a fan. I'm Joe's daughter.
- What's everybody staring at?

314
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,900
I didn't know Joe had a kid.

315
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,400
Yo, I don't think Joe knew
Joe had a kid.

316
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,600
- Stay here.
- Yes, sir.

317
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Hat.

318
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,300
Give me this!

319
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,400
Here's what you got to read right there.
You all set?

320
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,100
Here we go. And three, two, one... Go!

321
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,500
Boston Rebels! Experience the heat!

322
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,800
Boston Rebels! Catch the magic.

323
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,400
Boston Rebels! Feel the...
Wait a minute. Who writes this?

324
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,700
Hey, let's get Joe.
He won't be expecting it.

325
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,800
We'll put ice in his bath.

326
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,500
Coop, look. Look real close.

327
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,100
Joe is in an ice bath.

328
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,300
- Well, we'll put colder ice in it.
- Glove.

329
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,800
Yeah.

330
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,700
Webber, think about this.

331
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
Big surprise, eh, Kingman?

332
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,200
More like a safety blitz.

333
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,500
Yeah, well, you should be happy.

334
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,800
I remember how happy I was
when my kids were born.

335
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,100
Yeah, but you knew
they were coming.

336
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,800
Yeah, well, either way, she's here now.

337
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,700
What's your name, sweetheart?

338
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,500
- Peyton.
- Peyton, that's cute.

339
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,200
- Hi, Peyton.
- Hi.

340
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,400
Oh, that's cool.
Like... Like, Peyton Manning?

341
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,700
No, dude.
It's like Walter Payton, right?

342
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,500
No. Peyton Rous.

343
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,700
- Who's that?
- He won the Nobel Prize.

344
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,300
For what team?

345
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,000
In medicine.

346
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,700
He's not even a football player.
That's stupid.

347
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,000
"Stupid" is a mean word.

348
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,800
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

349
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,900
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

350
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
- Isn't.
- Is!

351
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,100
- Isn't.
- Is!

352
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,000
Quiet. Both of you.

353
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,600
Step away from my pants.

354
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,900
Awkward.

355
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,600
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.

356
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,000
See, those are Monroe's
very special underwear.

357
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,000
You see,
he needs to wear them every game,

358
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,800
- or he thinks we won't win.
- Oh.

359
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,200
<i>Hey, I'm on SportsCenter again.</i>

360
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,400
I'm hungry.

361
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,100
Please don't touch anything.
Stand right here.

362
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,800
Tonight's Tuesday.
We're going to carbo-load.

363
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,300
Twenty-twenty-sixty ratio.

364
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
What?

365
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,000
Hey, do you have any Jell-O?
I want some Jell-O.

366
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,900
Like I said, please don't touch.
Fingerprints. I don't like fingerprints.

367
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Stand right here, don't do anything.

368
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,500
I'm not giving you 28 grams
of empty carbohydrates.

369
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,600
We do not do simple sugars
in this house.

370
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,700
But I'm a kid and kids love sugar.
I mean, the simpler the better.

371
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,600
Well, my dad never let me have sugar.

372
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,500
Oh, is that why you never smile?

373
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,400
Mmm.

374
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Listen, you better eat your food
before it gets cold.

375
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,100
But it's as big as a mountain.

376
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,600
Listen, if you're going to make the pros,
you have to get your appetite up.

377
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,200
Let's go. Eat.

378
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,700
You got a little...

379
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,000
- A little something right here.
- What?

380
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,900
I got what?

381
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,500
I'm going to go and wash the dishes.

382
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,100
You can eat.

383
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,200
And finish eating.

384
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,200
I don't have a guest room
because I don't like guests.

385
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,000
But you can sleep here.

386
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,600
- What's this?
- That is a universal remote.

387
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,200
It controls the world.
And you don't need to touch it.

388
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,300
What's the "romance" button for?

389
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,300
The romance button
is for a little Valentine's Day magic.

390
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,100
Turn... Turn this off. Turn it off.
Turn it off.

391
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,600
Turn it off. Press the button.
Turn it off.

392
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,400
Stop touching things.

393
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,800
Aren't you going to tell me
a bedtime story?

394
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,100
Bedtime story... Bedtime story.

395
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,000
Yeah.

396
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,200
The Big Bad Wolf

397
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,900
blew down the Grammy's house

398
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and ate the Goldilocks

399
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,300
and then there was something
about the porridge.

400
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,600
The end.

401
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,900
Good night.

402
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,500
I mean a real bedtime story, Joe.

403
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,500
A bedtime story is supposed
to make you feel peaceful.

404
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,500
I'll show you.

405
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,500
Lean back, relax,
and listen to the story.

406
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,300
Fine. Fine. I'm going to listen
to this one time, then that's it.

407
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,300
Then you go to sleep.
Do you understand me?

408
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,500
Once upon a time there was a princess

409
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,500
and she had a lot of beautiful dresses.

410
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,300
She had a pink dress, a red dress,

411
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,900
a blue dress, a green dress,
a purple dress,

412
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
- an orange dress, a yellow dress...
- I get it. I get it. I get it.

413
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,400
A lot of dresses, a lot of colors.
So what?

414
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,200
So each dress had a secret power.

415
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,700
The pink dress,
which had pink sparkles all over it,

416
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
could make her fly.

417
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,700
And the blue dress,
which had blue sparkles all over it,

418
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,000
could make her tiny.

419
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,300
And the green dress,
which had green sparkles all over it,

420
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,600
could make her sleep.

421
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,700
Whoa!

422
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,600
Hey, baby.

423
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,800
Why didn't you answer me
when I called?

424
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,000
I was starting to get worried.

425
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,100
I'm sorry. I forgot I had
my phone turned off from the flight.

426
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:21,200
Well, I'm just happy that you got
there safely. So, how's it going?

427
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:27,000
Great. Well, the food's not so hot,
but my room is huge.

428
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,100
Well, that's very cool,
but how's the ballet?

429
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,600
I mean, is it as good as they promised?

430
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,100
Too soon to tell.

431
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Hey, listen, sweetie, it's almost
time for my flight to take off,

432
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,400
but I will call you
as soon as I can, okay?

433
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,800
I miss you so much already.

434
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,100
E- mail me lots of pictures.
And Peyton, I love you.

435
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,600
I love you, too. Bye.

436
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,400
Is there a ballet school close by?

437
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,100
Spike?

438
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,400
Why is my dog in a dress
with pink nail polish?

439
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,600
<i>He's learning Swan Lake.</i>

440
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,800
Do you know how to fix
a ballerina bun?

441
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,400
Do I look like I know
how to fix a ballerina bun?

442
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,200
My mom says we're not supposed to
pop our knuckles.

443
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,600
Well, your mom
didn't sleep on a hard sofa

444
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,700
instead of her specially designed
$ 10,000 orthopedic bed

445
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:42,200
made by Dr. Johan Gustavo,
of Switzerland.

446
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,200
- What's... What's with the Beethoven?
- It's Tchaikovsky.

447
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,600
- Do you listen to this every morning?
- No.

448
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,700
Sometimes I listen to Bach,
or Rachmaninoff...

449
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,700
Do you have an iPod?

450
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,500
Because I'm going to buy you one.
Immediately. Right now.

451
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
I'm going to buy you an iPod.

452
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,200
Until then...

453
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,700
Whoa...

454
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,900
What is this?

455
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,100
My Bedazzler.
Doesn't Camille look pretty?

456
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,400
A Bedazzler?

457
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,700
And that's why I use
tuna for protein and flavor.

458
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
Mmm.

459
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,800
- Gross.
- Little liquid chickens.

460
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah, that's my favorite.

461
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,100
Joe's juice.

462
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,000
Okay. That's enough.

463
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
I'm gonna need you to drink up.

464
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,000
You'll be running the 40
in under 4.5 in no time.

465
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,800
That smells worse than school food.

466
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,000
You know, speaking of school,
why aren't you in it?

467
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,200
- I'm on break.
- In January? No you're not.

468
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,700
Yes, I am. I go to a magnet school,
so I have January off.

469
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,500
Really? Well, guess what?
I'm not on break.

470
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,900
As a matter of fact,
I'm on the opposite of break.

471
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,100
So I'm gonna need you
to come over here,

472
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,000
put some hustle in it,
and drink your breakfast.

473
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,600
- Peyton, stop messing around.
- What?

474
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,600
Peyton!

475
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,700
No!

476
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Nice.

477
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,700
That's real nice.

478
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,700
- You know what a playbook is?
- I'm guessing it's a book with plays?

479
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,600
Oh, I get it. The Xs are for kisses
and the Os for hugs.

480
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,800
Wrong! The X's mean
"stay out of these areas of the house. "

481
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,500
The O's mean "open access. "

482
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,700
For example, you want to go
to the kitchen, straight buttonhook.

483
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,600
But now you go to the kitchen, big X.

484
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,800
Off limits. No access.

485
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,600
Can't go there, because you made
a mess in the kitchen.

486
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,000
Do you understand?

487
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,600
No trick plays, no flea-flickers. Got it?

488
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,300
Got it. No flea-flickers.

489
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,900
This is your game plan.
Learn it. Live it. Love it.

490
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,100
That's it, boys.
Practice is over.

491
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,100
Pick a nanny, Joe.

492
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,700
- I'll take the one at...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

493
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,400
Don't you think
you should ask some questions first?

494
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,800
I've got great instincts.

495
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,700
The one on the end, Stella.

496
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,900
Edna.

497
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,100
The other end, Stella.

498
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,800
Blondie, you're up.

499
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,600
Oh, no. No.

500
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,600
The King picked me!

501
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,900
We are going to be just like sisters!

502
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,800
Oh, my goodness.

503
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
You start tomorrow.

504
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,100
Hey. You're going
to the opening tonight, right?

505
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,100
It's my restaurant.

506
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,600
Oh.

507
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,600
Well, what are you
going to do with her?

508
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,700
I don't know.

509
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,500
Hi. Hello.

510
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,000
Welcome, Mr. Kingman.

511
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,500
- The Maloofs!
- About time, there, Joe.

512
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,900
You made it. Have fun.

513
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,900
- Yeah.
- Enjoy yourself.

514
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,600
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, man.

515
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,900
- How you doing?
- Hey.

516
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,200
- Jo Jo!
- Hey, nice to see you.

517
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,000
Hey, everything's on Joe tonight.

518
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,800
And that's exactly what I said.
I told them.

519
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,700
I said, "Listen, I'm the greatest. "

520
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,500
The purple or the yellow?

521
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Hmm.

522
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,600
Mmm?

523
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,300
Mmm.

524
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,000
That's what I was thinking, too.

525
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,900
I'll be back.

526
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,100
Water the lawn. Water the lawn.

527
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,400
Hey, great night, Mr. Kingman.

528
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,800
Indeed it was, Jay. Indeed it was.

529
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,800
Hey, Joe! This way!

530
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,200
Number one on the field
and number one in your heart.

531
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,000
<i>I've got sunshine</i>

532
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,100
<i>On a cloudy day</i>

533
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Yes, I do.

534
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,700
<i>When it's cold outside</i>

535
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,900
<i>I've got the month of May</i>

536
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,100
<i>I guess you'd say</i>

537
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,000
<i>What can make me</i>

538
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,100
<i>What can make me</i>

539
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,300
<i>feel this way</i>

540
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
<i>My girl</i>

541
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Joe?

542
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,400
<i>My girl</i>

543
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,900
<i>Talking about my girl</i>

544
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
My girl... Peyton!

545
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,000
Joe?

546
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,300
Joe. Joe, where are you?

547
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,200
There you are.
Joe, I thought you forgot about me.

548
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,200
Peyton! Peyton! Peyton!

549
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,900
Hey, Joe, is that your daughter?
- Peyton!

550
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,800
Hey, Joe, you forget something?

551
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,300
Father of the year!

552
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Yesterday, Fanny's Burgers
agreed to hand out

553
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,900
your action figure
with every order of fries.

554
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,900
But do you think
they're going to want a spokesman

555
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
who forgot his child in a bar?

556
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,100
Hmm?

557
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,900
My mom says that Fanny's
makes kids fat and gives them gas.

558
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,500
Well, your daddy's agent says
Fanny's makes him fat with cash.

559
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,600
Now, I have to put together
a press conference, do some cleanup.

560
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,900
I'm the janitor, Joe's the mop,
and Peyton's the mess.

561
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,900
What?

562
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,000
- Something funny, Larry?
- Just a little throat tickle, sir.

563
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,900
Well, get it fixed.

564
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Right here. Chop-chop.

565
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,500
You got a station wagon, Stella?

566
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,900
No, you did.

567
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,400
Say "bye-bye" to being
the Big Bad Dad of Boston.

568
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,300
Oh, no.

569
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,900
Oh, yes.

570
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
You want me to sign that?

571
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,400
Peyton, sweetie, be a good girl
and cooperate with your daddy

572
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,300
and Auntie Stella will get you a nice
new BlackBerry with a Bluetooth.

573
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,700
And an upgrade
on your next international flight.

574
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,900
I'm eight.

575
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,400
Listen, Bratty McPain-in-the-Butt,

576
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,800
you will do whatever it takes
to help your father.

577
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,100
I'll pay for the therapy.

578
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,600
Listen, Peyton,
what Stella's trying to say here is

579
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,200
this right now is crunch time.

580
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,000
So, if something's bothering you,
then all you got to do...

581
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,800
Let's keep it bottled up
until after the playoffs.

582
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,900
Fine.

583
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,100
On one condition.

584
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,100
No nanny.

585
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,600
No way.

586
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,300
Hey...

587
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,400
- Let's go. Come on.
- I'm feeling a little dizzy, Joe.

588
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,600
Everything's all...

589
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,100
- Dizzy?
- I think it might be

590
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,600
from that funny yellow soft drink
Joe gave me last night.

591
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,800
What was it called again?

592
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,100
Margarita?

593
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,900
- You wouldn't.
- You wouldn't.

594
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,700
Try me.

595
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,400
Good morning, Joe. I'm ready to start!

596
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,300
Hey, Cindy!

597
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,900
You're fired.

598
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,600
Bye.

599
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,300
Joe! Joe!

600
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,900
Hey, Joe,
how can you remember the plays

601
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,500
when you can't remember
you have a daughter?

602
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,700
Joe, what is an 8-year-old girl doing
in a nightclub at 3:00 in the morning?

603
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
<i>Thank you. Thank you guys
so much for coming out.</i>

604
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,200
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

605
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,300
<i>thank you so much for coming.</i>

606
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,600
<i>Great questions, by the way.
Thank you.</i>

607
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,300
<i>As you all know by now,
I've recently learned I'm a father.</i>

608
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,500
<i>And clearly,
I'm still getting the hang of things.</i>

609
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,100
That's not an excuse, Joe.

610
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,500
<i>But you better believe that Peyton's
nightclub evenings are behind her.</i>

611
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,500
<i>Because from now on, we're both
going to be going to sleep early, right?</i>

612
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,500
<i>Now, who's number one on the field
and number one in your heart?</i>

613
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,200
<i>Let's go.</i>

614
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,300
<i>Can I say something, please?</i>

615
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,600
No. Let's go.

616
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,000
<i>Hi, everybody, I'm Peyton,</i>

617
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,200
<i>the one who'll be going to bed early
from now on.</i>

618
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,400
<i>My dad didn't have much of
a heads-up on this whole father thing</i>

619
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,300
<i>and he is still
getting the hang of things.</i>

620
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,600
<i>But it's like everything else in his life.</i>

621
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,500
<i>He never says "no. "</i>

622
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,200
<i>I mean, he's teaching me
that you can do anything</i>

623
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:15,000
<i>if you've got motivation
and determination.</i>

624
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,900
<i>And the place where that starts</i>

625
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,100
<i>is right here, in the heart.</i>

626
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,100
<i>You're the world's greatest father.</i>

627
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,000
That was good.

628
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,600
- That was really good.
- It's going to cost you.

629
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,000
...two, three, four, grand plié...

630
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,100
There you go, there you go.

631
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,200
And...

632
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,500
Come on, this isn't a sport.

633
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,900
Football. Football's a sport.

634
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,600
Excuse me. Hi. Can I help you?

635
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,500
Hello. This is Peyton.

636
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,400
- Hi.
- And she's here for this.

637
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,200
So, I guess I'll be back
in a couple of hours. Bye.

638
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,300
Well, class started 15 minutes ago,

639
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
and we don't accept students
without an audition

640
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,600
and that happened last month,
so I'm really sorry.

641
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm sure maybe we can
work something out?

642
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,400
Money's no object,
as you probably know.

643
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,100
Okay, the thing is
that this is a professional school, and...

644
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,100
- That's very nice.
- Thank you.

645
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,800
Go change, go on, go change.

646
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,800
Let me see how she does today. Okay?

647
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,300
All right.

648
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,100
Maybe I'll... I'll try and...
We'll get somebody...

649
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,500
The moms sit over there.

650
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,600
Excuse me. Thank you.

651
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,100
And one, two, three, very long...

652
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,100
Come on, come on.

653
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,600
And one, two, three, four.

654
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,500
Open up, like a princess, chin up.

655
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,900
Thank you.

656
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,300
Beautiful class, everybody. Beautiful.

657
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,000
Peyton, come here.
Can I tell you that that was so, so good.

658
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,500
Peyton, come here.
Can I tell you that that was so, so good.

659
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,500
Thank you.

660
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,700
Our next big performance
is in three weeks.

661
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,800
But if you promise me that you're going
to work extra, extra, super, super, hard,

662
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,300
we'd love to have you.

663
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,300
- I'll come every single day.
- All day, every day.

664
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,500
Well, it is a ballet school,
not a childcare facility.

665
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,400
And when we make a commitment
to a student,

666
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,900
we ask that the parents
make a commitment to the school.

667
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Can you do that?

668
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,000
Well, I think you can make
a little exception for me.

669
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,000
- And why is that?
- You don't know who I am?

670
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,100
No.

671
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,900
I'm Joe Kingman, baby!
The quarterback of the Boston Rebels.

672
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,200
Number one on that field

673
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,900
and number one
in your pretty little heart.

674
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,400
"The King of the Gridiron. "

675
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,400
"Never-Say-No Joe?"

676
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,000
No? Nothing?

677
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,000
Odd.

678
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,500
- Well, don't you know who I am?
- No.

679
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,900
I'm Monique Vasquez,
the lady with the ballet school,

680
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,400
the one that doesn't accept
any new students full-time

681
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,500
unless she knows for a fact
that the parents are going to help out.

682
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,400
That's fine. Fine. I promise. Whatever.
Let's go.

683
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,100
Who doesn't know
who Joe Kingman is?

684
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,300
She must be living under a rock.

685
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,800
<i>Raef will take it this time.
- He shoots! Come on!</i>

686
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,000
<i>- Got it.
- Yeah!</i>

687
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,300
<i>I didn't see what happened
to Paul Pierce.</i>

688
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,400
<i>We'll be right back</i>

689
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,500
<i>- after a word from our...
- Let's go, Paul!</i>

690
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,600
I can't believe they came from 10 down.

691
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,100
Hey, keep this clean. Use the napkins.

692
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,800
Don't look at me like that.
Use a napkin.

693
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,100
Yeah, you tell him. You tell him, Spike.
Mean old Daddy.

694
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,900
Let's get Webber.

695
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,100
Webber, you want a soda?

696
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,200
Huh?

697
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,000
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

698
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,500
Oh...

699
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,400
- That's refreshing.
- Good one.

700
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,900
What's up, Joe?

701
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,100
I don't know, Coop. What do you think?
That's a $40,000 couch.

702
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
I asked you to be careful!

703
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,100
- Which bathroom should I use?
- The one off the trophy room.

704
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,900
Come on, Pierce!

705
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,200
Paul Pierce comes down
with the board.

706
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,700
The man's a beast.
You saw that, Joe. You saw that.

707
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,500
That's why the Celtics
are my team for life.

708
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,900
Celtics got this one locked up.

709
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,500
Hold on, hold on...

710
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,900
Wait a second. Wait a minute.
Little bit more.

711
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,900
Stop growling. Hold on.
One, two, three.

712
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,800
What did I do?

713
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,300
Let's go, Paul Pierce.
Time to come through.

714
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,500
- Okay, here we go, baby. Here we go.
- Three seconds left.

715
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,500
<i>Welcome to
the Magical World of Ponies.</i>

716
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,900
What happened?

717
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,300
Get it back! Get it back!
Get the game back!

718
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,500
Get the mechanicals!

719
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,900
The mechanicals.
The mechanicals, Joe!

720
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,800
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

721
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,500
It's right there. See?

722
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,600
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

723
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,500
We missed it!

724
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,000
<i>- You gotta celebrate.
- Peyton.</i>

725
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,700
What did I do?

726
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,800
Thanks, Joe. Let's go, guys.

727
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,100
Wait. Where are you going?

728
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,300
You don't have to leave.
Where are you guys going?

729
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,100
- I got to get home to...
- Where?

730
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,100
Nothing.

731
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,300
What did I tell you
about touching the remote?

732
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,600
Bath. Bed. Now.

733
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,000
Just got to add a little bit
of bubble bath.

734
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,300
Not too much. That's good.

735
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:12,900
Perfect.

736
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
This could take a while.

737
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,900
<i>But what really sets
this future Hall of Famer apart...</i>

738
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,100
Passion for the game.

739
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,200
Spike, you know the rule,
no barking when I'm on TV!

740
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,400
Spike!

741
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,700
Spike?

742
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,100
What happened?

743
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
Spike.

744
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,800
Peyton?

745
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,900
Peyton! Peyton!

746
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,700
Peyton!

747
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,700
I'm not going to yell.

748
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800
We're going to have a very calm

749
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500
And rational discussion

750
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,500
about all...

751
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:38,100
You Bedazzled my football.

752
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,900
You guys comfortable? My pillow.

753
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,900
King on the couch!

754
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,200
This is ridiculous.

755
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,300
Never

756
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,900
say...

757
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,000
No! No!

758
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,700
I have to warm up.

759
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,300
I have to practice.

760
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,500
I have a playoff game this weekend.

761
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,200
Do you...
Do you know what that means?

762
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,500
My guess is that it means
you have a playoff game this weekend.

763
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,400
My dog, my bed, my car, my TV,
my stereo...

764
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,100
Is nothing sacred?

765
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,200
My towel! My towel.

766
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,400
This is all mine! It's all me!

767
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,600
It's all mine! This is all me!
This is my towel.

768
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,600
<i>Hi, everybody, I'm Marv Albert,
along with Boomer Esiason.</i>

769
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:10,400
<i>We're here in the Mile High City
where Denver hosts Boston</i>

770
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,700
<i>in the first round of the playoffs.</i>

771
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,800
In what should be
a tremendous showdown.

772
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,100
<i>We have a rematch
of last year's Conference Final</i>

773
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,700
<i>in which Denver narrowly escaped
with a 34-30 victory.</i>

774
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,400
<i>He has the tight end screen,
he side-arms it.</i>

775
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,300
<i>The catch made by Cooper.</i>

776
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,000
<i>Cooper on the run, picks up a blocker.</i>

777
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,500
<i>And now, directing traffic...</i>

778
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,400
<i>Nice cut. Cooper down the sideline!</i>

779
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,800
<i>And he's bounced out of bounds!</i>

780
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,800
Yeah! I did it again!

781
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,700
Oh, our boy looks great today.

782
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,100
He's going to look even greater
lounging poolside

783
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,300
at the new Blake resort.

784
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,800
Let's just see how many Fanny's
kiddie meals he sells first.

785
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,500
Fanny.

786
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,400
Do you work at Fanny's Burgers?

787
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,000
I own Fanny's Burgers, honey.

788
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,100
My mom says...

789
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:07,700
I mean, my dad says
your chili cheese fries rock.

790
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,100
Yeah, they do! They rock. Come on!
Kick it!

791
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
<i>Kingman out of the gun,
takes a look.</i>

792
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,900
<i>He has Sanders wide open.
He's not going that way.</i>

793
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,600
<i>Marv, I've never
seen a quarterback</i>

794
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,300
<i>who doesn't trust his wide receivers</i>

795
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,800
<i>with a game on the line like this.</i>

796
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,800
<i>Touchdown! It's all over!</i>

797
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,000
<i>Boston has defeated Denver.</i>

798
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,100
<i>All on the legs of Joe Kingman,</i>

799
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,000
Boston advances
to next week's divisional playoffs

800
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,200
for the second year in a row.

801
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,200
Now, will this be the year the King
takes them all the way?

802
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,900
Peyton, are you okay?
Why are you still here?

803
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,100
I guess Joe's running a little bit late
from practice.

804
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,600
What, two hours late?
That's unacceptable.

805
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,300
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

806
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Hey, King.

807
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,200
No, I'm the king. You're the king.

808
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,300
Don't do it, Elvis!
Don't jump.

809
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,300
Mr. Kingman?

810
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,200
Oh, no. Peyton.

811
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,600
Hey.

812
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,700
Yeah, I guess practice ran a little
longer than expected. Thanks, Bo.

813
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,900
- Mr. Kingman, we need to talk about...
- You know what?

814
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,800
Why don't you just call me Joe?

815
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,600
Stop it. Stop it.

816
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,800
Mr. Kingman,
I informed you from the start

817
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,200
that we are a ballet school,
not a daycare center.

818
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,600
Yeah! I got that. Mental note.

819
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,600
I'm glad you told me. Now I know.
Ballet school, not a daycare facility.

820
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,700
Sure, let me hook you up
for your time, though.

821
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,500
Peyton, go grab a hundo out of my bag.
It's in my wallet, around the corner.

822
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,200
I just knew
you were one of those parents.

823
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,300
One of what parents?

824
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:54,600
The kind who thinks that his life is
more important than anybody else's.

825
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,200
Look, lady.
I don't know what kind of parent I am.

826
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,200
All I know is I have an entire team...

827
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,500
Scratch that,
an entire city depending on me.

828
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,900
Yeah, you also have a daughter
depending on you

829
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,700
not to only take care of her,
but to care about her. Okay?

830
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,200
- Listen, I care about Peyton.
- Then prove it!

831
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,700
- I got it.
- Hey, sweetie!

832
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,500
Your father here was telling me
how excited he is

833
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,100
to finally fulfill the commitment
he made to support the school.

834
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,100
And guess what?
I've got the perfect job for him.

835
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,200
Cool.

836
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,500
No, no, no. Absolutely not.
You're completely insane.

837
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,500
You're a freakishly large man

838
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,000
and you're telling me you're incapable
of playing a tree? Come on.

839
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,600
No, what I'm telling you is
I am a serious athlete.

840
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,200
Not a ballerina.

841
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,900
<i>You do me a favor, mamita?
Can you please hold this for me?</i>

842
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,900
Thank you so much.

843
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,200
Trust me, no one is ever going to
confuse you with a ballerina, okay?

844
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,000
And now,
I need you to be an enchanted tree...

845
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,900
I'm not going to be an enchanted tree.
I'm a quarterback!

846
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,800
I'm the only one that talks.

847
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,300
Up!

848
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,400
...around and... Oh, my God, no, no...
Please, come over here.

849
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,100
Wasn't so bad.

850
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,500
We're just warming up, so come on.

851
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:52,900
Hey, so what were you saying about
ballet not being a real sport?

852
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,700
Hmm?

853
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,500
It wasn't... It wasn't so bad.

854
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,100
You see, ballerinas can leap
as high as you can,

855
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,700
but when they go down,
they go down in plié.

856
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,900
And they hold and hold.

857
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,700
And then they go en pointe
for hours and hours.

858
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,400
So, if ballet were easy,
they'd call it football.

859
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,400
Yeah. Right.

860
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,900
Yeah, right.

861
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,400
Listen, Mr. Kingman,

862
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,300
your daughter has all the makings
to be a professional dancer.

863
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,300
She has passion, talent, discipline.

864
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,100
I guess she inherited more
than just your charm.

865
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,100
You see?

866
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,200
Let's try that one again.

867
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,500
Where were you last night?
You missed a great fight.

868
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,000
Hey, man,
you look like you were in a fight.

869
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,200
I was doing some stuff.

870
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,100
Well, you could've called.
You never call anymore.

871
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,400
Dude, stop being such a chick.

872
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,400
Never thought someone so little
could be so much work, huh?

873
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,000
You don't know the half of it.

874
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,700
<i>- Hello?
Hi!</i>

875
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,900
Listen, I finally got to a phone.
I want you to tell me everything.

876
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,700
I don't know where to start.

877
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,800
How about those pictures
you promised me?

878
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,700
E- mail me right now.

879
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,900
I have to see you.

880
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,300
Okay, hold on.

881
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,800
I just sent them.

882
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,500
You're breaking up. I love you.

883
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,200
Wait, wait. No, no, Peyton! Honey...

884
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,800
I love you, too.

885
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,300
We need to talk. Follow me.

886
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,300
I need my bed back.

887
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,400
Wow! That is awesome! I love it!

888
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,700
Love it. I love this room.
This is awesome.

889
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,100
It's beautiful.

890
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,500
- Thanks, Joe.
- You're welcome.

891
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,800
Look, P,
