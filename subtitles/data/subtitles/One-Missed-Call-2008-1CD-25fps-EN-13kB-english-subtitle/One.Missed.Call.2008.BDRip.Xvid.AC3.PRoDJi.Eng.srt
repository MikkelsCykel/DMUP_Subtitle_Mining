{2305}{2345}Get out of the way!
{2346}{2412}This way!
{2535}{2607}Saint Luke's Hospital.|I repeat, Saint Luke's Hospital.
{2608}{2669}Does anything hurt?
{2670}{2727}Sweetheart, is your mommy here?
{2728}{2795}Do you know where she is?
{2977}{3060}Really, I'm just... No.
{3061}{3137}Don't come over.
{3142}{3242}No. No, I swear|I wasn't just seeing things.
{3243}{3337}I mean, it could have just been a prank.
{3340}{3415}I don't know who.
{3422}{3535}No, really, I'm just gonna see you|at school tomorrow.
{3552}{3620}Thanks, Leann.
{3635}{3697}Bye.
{4417}{4490}Luna?
{4615}{4677}Luna?
{7965}{8001}Come on.|Over here.
{8002}{8072}Beth's a little too sane for me,|but she does throw a good party.
{8073}{8142}Yeah, so now I'm having sex|and phone sex at the same time.
{8143}{8215}Oh, man. Are you serious?
{8255}{8355}I know, but he was just so handsome.
{8356}{8411}And I was so nervous, you know?
{8412}{8500}And I'm trying to describe|the plot of Beloved to him...
{8501}{8539}...and I just started crying.
{8540}{8650}It was a perfect year, wasn't it?|I loved it.
{8680}{8812}Brian, could you get your eyes off Taylor|for two seconds and help me with this?
{8847}{8894}Unbelievable.
{8895}{9000}And before the sheets are even cold.|No wonder why Leann moved out.
{9001}{9122}I am a man. I have needs.|Is that a problem for you?
{9123}{9195}No. But it might be a problem for Taylor.
{9196}{9256}Hot. Yes, well...
{9257}{9347}...we can't force Taylor|to have good taste, now can we?
{9348}{9420}Just keep chopping.
{9421}{9492}I'll keep chopping.
{9607}{9730}You know, I can hear you analyzing me in|your head. You might as well do it out loud.
{9731}{9812}Okay, I think that|you're still messed up over Leann.
{9813}{9859}You think if you flirt with Taylor...
{9860}{9949}...maybe Leann'll get jealous|and come back to you.
{9950}{10055}Go back to analyzing me in your head.|I think I like that better.
{10145}{10240}Hey, did someone lock the door?
{10825}{10884}- Hey, Leann. Hi.|- Hi.
{10885}{10941}Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
{10942}{11021}- Me too.|- Is... Is Brian home?
{11022}{11122}Yeah, he's in the kitchen,|so we should go upstairs.
{11187}{11265}How you doing?
{11347}{11415}Oh. Oh.
{11417}{11455}Hey, it's Leann.
{11456}{11517}Bye.
{11597}{11717}Okay. Just leave the alarm off. Thanks.
{11847}{11914}Hey.
{11915}{11981}How was it?
{11982}{12092}It was a funeral. It sucked.
{12097}{12205}From now on, I only go to parties|where no one gets cremated.
{12206}{12254}How are Shelley's parents?
{12255}{12375}Considering their 24-year-old daughter|drowned in the backyard pond...
{12376}{12430}...they're great.
{12440}{12489}And you?
{12490}{12557}I knew Shelley.|We interned at Saint Luke's together.
{12558}{12606}I mean, she was not crazy.
{12607}{12685}I know, but the way she was|talking at the end was pretty...
{12686}{12765}Yeah, that doesn't mean|she killed herself.
{12845}{12917}That's not my ringtone.
{13120}{13179}It says it's from Shelley.
{13180}{13265}Who'd be calling from Shelley's phone?
{13332}{13412}That's creepy.
{13427}{13512}It's dated Monday, 10:17 p. m.
{13557}{13665}It's Friday. Maybe you just|set the date wrong.
{13940}{14015}Leann, what is it?
{14016}{14082}Leann?
{14255}{14315}If you'd like to hear this message again...
{14316}{14371}...press one.
{14372}{14488}Voice call received Monday,|June 12th, 10:17 p.m.
{14490}{14611}I don't know,|it's the weirdest, weirdest thing.
{14612}{14732}It's like every time I|turn around, they're...
{14740}{14860}No! Aaah!
{14890}{14967}That's your voice.
{14968}{15045}That's you.
{15250}{15279}Yeah?|Yeah.
{15280}{15306}Cut me a break, man.
{15307}{15377}No, man, you know what the price is.|You gotta hit it right.
{15378}{15414}All right. Give me that.
{15415}{15485}All right, slow down, homie.
{15486}{15531}Okay?
{15532}{15637}Yeah. They're real nice.
{15745}{15851}Detective Andrews. Yeah.
{15852}{15909}A group of hikers found her.
{15910}{16048}We held off on the autopsy|until you got here, detective.
{16049}{16185}Even so, your sister was out|there for more than a week.
{16186}{16285}There's really no need for you to do this.
{16952}{17015}Whew.
{17295}{17382}Oh, jeez.
{18297}{18384}In cases of severe and repeated|childhood abuse...
{18385}{18469}...the posttraumatic-stress model|may be valid.
{18470}{18585}Long-term effects may include|sexual dysfunction, amnesia...
{18586}{18700}...dissociation, even hallucinations|and multiple personalities.
{18701}{18751}The post-trauma child...
{18752}{18829}...faces formidable developmental tasks...
{18830}{18970}...and among these what we call|"dissociative virtuosity. "
{18992}{19105}The post-trauma child|will form primary attachments...
{19106}{19159}...to develop a sense of basic trust...
{19160}{19300}...and to preserve a sense|of hope and meaning in life.
{19307}{19411}The child will, from this experience,|attempt to...
{19412}{19514}...construct an explanation|of what's happened.
{19515}{19655}And these explanations may excuse|the parental negligence or abuse.
{19656}{19780}The child may blame themselves|for what has happened.
{19850}{19975}Look, if you come over|earlier then we can study some more.
{19997}{20034}Leann!
{20035}{20115}Hey. Do you wanna|go get some coffee?
{20116}{20189}No. No. I've...
{20190}{20295}...gotta get to the library.|Paper's due next week.
{20296}{20380}Are you okay?|You seem kind of weirded-out.
{20381}{20451}I haven't been sleeping too well.
{20452}{20504}Call me tonight.|I'll read you my paper...
{20505}{20625}...on developmental perspectives|in abuse cases. It's better than Ambien.
{20652}{20745}Okay. Bye.
{20772}{20840}Bye.
{20935}{21050}The library will be closing in five minutes.
{22102}{22156}- Hey, Lee.|- Hey.
{22157}{22209}Hey, what's up?
{22210}{22312}Oh, I'm just finishing up this paper.|What are you doing?
{22317}{22445}I just got sprung from the stacks.|My brain was mushing out.
{22446}{22517}Oh, God, I know what you mean.
{22685}{22746}Leann?
{22747}{22809}Leann? Hello?
{22810}{22965}Listen, Beth, I didn't mean to ditch you|after class today. I...
{23185}{23247}Leann, are you still there?
{23250}{23364}I don't know how to explain it.|L... I've been...
{23365}{23472}- I've been having some problems.|- What kind of problems?
{23532}{23577}Ever since I...
{23578}{23621}Well, I don't know.
{23622}{23764}I mean, Shelley drowned,|and that was my voice screaming.
{23765}{23905}And then that bizarre phone call,|and it was dated today.
{23915}{23985}10:17 p.m.
{24100}{24176}- I don't...|- Where are you?
{24177}{24252}I'm at the overpass on College.
{24260}{24314}That's two minutes away.|I'll be right there.
{24315}{24435}I keep seeing things. I mean,|weird people looking at me.
{24436}{24476}- Leann?|- I'm sorry.
{24477}{24534}I didn't mean to panic. I've just...
{24535}{24635}I've been seeing|some really strange stuff.
{24640}{24735}I don't know,|it's the weirdest, weirdest thing.
{24736}{24830}Every time I turn around, they're...
{25060}{25115}Leann!
{25170}{25232}- No! No!|- Leann!
{26332}{26420}Didn't see anything?|Like I said, she threw herself off.
{26421}{26474}Please, can we go?|This is taking so long.
{26475}{26550}You're gonna have to stay here|until I get all the information.
{26551}{26625}I need you to sign this statement.
{26717}{26780}- Hey.|- Hey.
{26847}{26907}And then she got this strange phone call.
{26908}{26944}It's hard to believe.
{26945}{27035}Yeah, Leann told me the same thing|happened to Shelley before she drowned.
{27036}{27104}- That is so eerie.|Taylor.
{27105}{27196}What? I'm just saying what Leann said.
{27197}{27279}Yeah, well, maybe this isn't the time,|all right?
{27280}{27369}I heard Shelley got a phone call|from an old advisor of hers.
{27370}{27450}I heard that too. Only it turned out|the advisor was already dead.
{27451}{27520}Would you stop it?
{27522}{27597}Her parents are right in the other room.
{27675}{27760}It's like dead people call you,|but it's your own voice.
{27761}{27830}And then you die too.
{27835}{27864}Shit, Taylor, know what?
{27865}{27975}Don't try to think, all right?|It just makes you look ridiculous.
{28035}{28109}I heard it too.
{28110}{28201}That's it. Now I'm really creeped out.
{28202}{28292}It's shit, all right? It's total bullshit.
{28572}{28629}Brian! Brian!
{28630}{28691}What's his problem?
{28692}{28772}He had a thing for Leann.
{29522}{29580}Brian.
{29637}{29686}Are you okay?
{29687}{29757}What was that back there?
{30027}{30144}To listen to your messages, press one.
{30145}{30232}Voice call received|Wednesday, June 14th...
{30233}{30304}...12:02 p.m.
{30305}{30395}Damn it, I forgot. I swear if I|didn't have my head screwed on...
{30545}{30616}The call came in two nights ago.|From Leann's phone.
{30617}{30715}- That was the night that she died.|- Only the call was dated Wednesday.
{30716}{30831}Today. 12:02 p.m.
{30832}{30909}I don't believe in magic, Beth.
{30910}{31052}I don't believe in anything. But ever since|I got that phone call, things have been...
{31055}{31132}...weird.|- Like what?
{31190}{31229}No, Brian, you have to tell me.
{31230}{31340}That's the exact same thing|that Leann told me right before she...
{31385}{31442}Brian?
{31475}{31552}What's wrong? Brian?
{31657}{31726}Look...
{31727}{31774}- What's...?|- Forget about it, okay?
{31775}{31821}- No, Brian, don't!|- These things work...
{31822}{31915}...because they get in your head, Beth.|You're the psych lady, you know that.
{31916}{31990}If you don't think about it,|it can't hurt you.
{32135}{32210}Like I said.
{32605}{32674}Brian, your phone!
{32675}{32742}You forgot your phone.
{32840}{32930}Damn it, I forgot. I swear if I|didn't have my head screwed on...
{33395}{33434}Let's go over this again.
{33435}{33545}Welder's acetylene tank exploded.|Your friend happened to be in the way.
{33546}{33611}Okay. And what about|Leann and the voice mails?
{33612}{33695}We checked on that. There were no|voice mails on your friends' phones.
{33696}{33769}- Either of them.|- But I heard them. Okay?
{33770}{33882}Leann got a phone call, and so did Brian,|right before they died.
{33883}{33934}Both of them did.
{33935}{34032}I hear it happened to Shelley too,|Shelley Baum, right before she died.
{34033}{34084}Well, thank you, Miss Raymond.
{34085}{34217}We'll check on that, and we'll contact you|if we need anything else.
{34300}{34346}What about the hard candies?
{34347}{34415}Both of these kids were eating them.|My sister too.
{34416}{34481}Three people eating hard candy|in two weeks?
{34482}{34572}The girl's right, Mickey. There's gotta be|some kind of connection here.
{34573}{34647}You know,|I'm really sorry about your sister.
{34648}{34709}But if it was my sister...
{34710}{34860}...I'd take some personal time,|just till I was thinking right again.
{34945}{35015}Excuse me, Miss Raymond?
{35025}{35084}I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
{35085}{35152}I'm Detective Jack Andrews. I heard|what you were saying...
{35153}{35211}...and, well, Detective Lee's a good cop...
{35212}{35275}...but she's a little short|on imagination, you know?
{35276}{35349}- What are you saying?|- I don't really know.
{35350}{35451}Except Shelley Baum interned|with my sister at Saint Luke's.
{35452}{35545}My sister Jean, she died in a fall|two days before Shelley drowned.
{35546}{35613}Oh, I'm sorry.|But then, you see what I'm saying.
{35614}{35680}Everybody seems to be|linked together somehow.
{35681}{35754}Something doesn't make sense here so...
{35755}{35865}...if you can think of anything else,|give me a call.
{37615}{37680}You didn't get a call, did you?
{37707}{37807}But my number was in Brian's cell.
{37837}{37922}I'm gonna be next.
{37935}{37976}I can feel it.
{37977}{38029}No, you don't know that, okay?
{38030}{38140}Because my number is in Brian's cell too.|Here.
{38177}{38297}No power, no problem.
{38327}{38400}Any dead people call...
{38445}{38517}...we're not home.
{39370}{39442}- Which one is it?|- Uh!
{39690}{39745}Who?
{40192}{40240}Oh, God.
{40241}{40286}Oh, God.
{40287}{40377}This can't be happening.
{40605}{40695}There are no batteries.
{40755}{40846}It says 8:32 p.m. On Friday.
{40847}{40937}That's two days from now.
{41250}{41307}Everything I'm seeing is there. It's real.
{41308}{41377}I'm seeing it and it's happening...
{41410}{41525}I do not. Okay?
{41622}{41707}Okay, you wanna delete it? Do it yourself.
{41720}{41819}Look, I'm... I'm sure you'll be fine.
{41820}{41932}I wanna do mine.|- You wanna do it too? Go ahead.
{41987}{42052}Go on, you can all do it.
{42053}{42096}There you go.
{42097}{42175}- That's a...|- Wait.
{42282}{42334}Sorry, ladies.|It just doesn't work that way.
{42335}{42405}Right. You're telling me|that we can't cancel the service?
{42406}{42464}You don't have to cancel.|Just use up your minutes.
{42465}{42552}That's what I'm trying to tell you.|We don't wanna use this phone at all.
{42553}{42672}Well, the phone is yours, so you|can do whatever you want with it.
{43340}{43386}Miss Anthony?
{43387}{43455}- Taylor Anthony?|- Yeah.
{43456}{43499}Ted Summers.
{43500}{43615}I'm a television producer. I work|on the program American Miracles.
{43616}{43655}Oh, I've heard of that.
{43656}{43691}Yeah.
{43692}{43744}Some students called us|about what happened...
{43746}{43796}...and they told us|all about your problem.
{43797}{43905}- Can we help you with something? We're...|- We were very moved by your story, Taylor.
{43906}{44021}- We think we might be able to help you.|- How?
{44022}{44135}About five years ago,|my son suffered a possession.
{44187}{44276}Yeah. It was pretty devastating|for the whole family.
{44277}{44357}So when I created my show,|I wanted to make it a point...
{44358}{44454}...to build an extensive resource|of people who were able...
{44455}{44550}...to deal successfully|with those evil influences like that.
{44551}{44609}What do you mean,|like, you do exorcisms?
{44610}{44720}- I think this is nonsense.|- Do you have the telephone on you, Taylor?
{44721}{44802}- What? No, we threw it away.|- Do you have the phone?
{44803}{44895}Well, it would really be helpful.|Here. Here.
{44896}{44951}Now, you show me...
{44952}{45015}...exactly what happened|when the phone call came in.
{45016}{45056}Okay, come here. Nope, nope.
{45057}{45117}Thank you very much.|This is ridiculous. Thank you.
{45118}{45177}- We don't need a reality show.|- I understand...
{45178}{45227}...you wanna protect your friend.|- I do.
{45228}{45282}- I admire that.|- Thank you.
{45552}{45625}- Come on, let's go.|- Jesus.
{45626}{45695}Come on, come on.
{45737}{45812}Wait, we could s...
{45817}{45869}Hey, maybe he could help me, Beth.
{45870}{45975}No, Taylor, you don't need an exorcism.|Okay?
{45976}{46070}That guy was so full of it.
{47360}{47415}Andrews.
{48550}{48652}Miss Raymond, it is not your|imagination. The phone calls happened.
{48653}{48721}The other detective said|nobody could find the voice mails.
{48722}{48805}Because the other detective|didn't bother to check the phone records.
{48806}{48854}I did, and it's all right there.
{48855}{48967}Brian was called by Leann, Leann|was called by Shelley, and Shelley...
{48968}{49031}...was called from my sister.
{49032}{49115}All right? And all the calls came in|after the caller was already dead.
{49116}{49161}Right. Who called your sister?
{49162}{49245}If we could trace it to the source|and find out who started this, then...
{49246}{49315}I was up all night tracking it.|I'm gonna go see her now.
{49316}{49354}- I'll give you a call. Okay?|- Okay.
{49355}{49414}- I'm gonna come with you.|- That's not a good idea.
{49415}{49560}Yeah, it is, because these are my friends|and there's no way I'm gonna sit here.
{49590}{49660}The call my sister got|came from a nurse at an old-age home.
{49661}{49725}A woman named Marie Layton.
{49860}{49942}It's right up here on the right.
{50135}{50179}I wouldn't hold my breath.
{50180}{50280}Nobody's been in there for|more than two weeks now, not a soul.
{50281}{50370}Okay. Thank you very much.
{50605}{50699}You know, I'm gonna go get the super.
{50700}{50770}That could take hours.|Why don't you just break in?
{50771}{50833}I'm a cop.
{50834}{50895}I'm not.
{50965}{51042}All right, give it a shot.
{51227}{51282}Okay.
{51312}{51372}I was getting it.
{52015}{52142}Well, whoever Marie Layton is,|she's a hell of a housekeeper, huh?
{52362}{52527}We're not... We're not...|We're not... We're not...
{55255}{55350}- Hey, you okay?|- Yeah.
{55482}{55562}I found this in the living room.
{55563}{55649}It must be one of those nanny cams.
{55650}{55735}To keep an eye on the children.
{55815}{55992}Okay, so judging from the angle, the|camera would have been right here.
{56072}{56147}So where did it go?
{56640}{56679}Beth.
{56680}{56764}Look, if you don't talk to me,|I can't help you.
{56765}{56885}That noise, the inhaler. I heard it|both times, before Leann and Brian...
{56886}{56977}Then when I looked behind me,|there was nobody there.
{57005}{57069}What the hell is happening?
{57070}{57145}This is the morgue file of the dead|from the last month or so.
{57146}{57213}If Marie Layton died,|she did it in another city.
{57214}{57285}I don't know how you stand|looking at this stuff.
{57286}{57355}The dead ones don't really|bother me so much.
{57356}{57409}Now take a look at this. All right.
{57410}{57483}It's not a Marie Layton,|but an Ellie Layton.
{57484}{57554}That's the older daughter|from the photograph.
{57555}{57647}Yeah. It says she died of an asthma attack|in her apartment.
{57648}{57725}There's a CPS report attached too.
{57740}{57814}Child Protective Services.|Was she an abuse victim?
{57815}{57920}It says her mother was questioned|by a psychiatric nurse at...
{57921}{58030}...Saint Luke's.|- Your sister.
{58067}{58135}Wanna give me a hand with those?|Yeah, sure.
{58136}{58205}Make sure Jesus is centered, all right?
{58206}{58274}Let's go, people! Let's go!
{58275}{58334}Hey, Gary, this is a great place.
{58335}{58400}I have a feeling|it's gonna be a terrific show.
{58401}{58507}- How's our girl doing, huh?|Not bad.
{58597}{58649}This is Beth. I'm calling for Taylor.
{58650}{58760}Taylor, when you get this,|will you call me, please? Thanks.
{58761}{58869}Jean's papers. I haven't had a chance|to go through them yet...
{58870}{58955}...but she kept records of everything|in case she had to go to court...
{58956}{59030}...so it's gotta be in here someplace.
{59215}{59317}She was the baby.|I was supposed to look out for her.
{59318}{59372}I'm sorry.
{59555}{59607}Is this it?
{59740}{59771}It says Marie Layton...
{59772}{59852}...checked her daughter Ellie|into the hospital for an asthma attack.
{59853}{59926}And here's the little one, Laurel,|stuck a needle in her hand.
{59927}{60065}Laurel, insect bites, a burn on her leg.|Ellie, another asthma attack.
{60066}{60131}Okay, Laurel again,|pesticide in her eye.
{60132}{60195}Here's another one.|Laurel ingested detergent.
{60196}{60229}And there, another burn.
{60230}{60315}Look at that. That's nine admissions|in April and May alone.
{60316}{60394}Munchausen syndrome by proxy.
{60395}{60470}It's when a mother wants attention,|so she hurts her children...
{60471}{60504}...so they need medical help.
{60505}{60564}But there's no way|she could've given Ellie asthma.
{60565}{60640}No, but she could have exposed her|to something to set it off.
{60641}{60700}So Ellie has an asthma attack and dies.
{60701}{60764}My sister starts asking questions.
{60765}{60832}Marie gets nervous|she's gonna be found out...
{60833}{60905}...so she takes Laurel and disappears.
{60906}{60977}I'm gonna go get Missing Persons on this.
{61095}{61164}A cell phone rings|and Death is on the line.
{61165}{61254}A beautiful coed,|a ticking clock of ghostly murder.
{61255}{61334}Next, American Miracles takes you there|as a famed exorcist...
{61335}{61455}...tries to outrace the mysterious curse|that has already claimed two lives.
{61465}{61572}Spiritual energy exists|in the same electromagnetic spectrum...
{61573}{61644}...as light or microwaves.
{61645}{61750}It's no surprise|it can travel through cellular phones.
{61751}{61834}And it grows there, like a seed...
{61835}{61972}...where it eventually manifests as|hallucinations, spiritual disturbances...
{61973}{62019}...and finally death.
{62020}{62064}For you, darling.
{62065}{62126}Taylor, it's Beth.|Hey, Beth.
{62127}{62174}Listen, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
{62175}{62235}It's okay. Hold on.|We'll be there in a few minutes.
{62236}{62294}No. It's gonna work out. I know it.
{62295}{62405}- No, Taylor, listen to me.|- There's nothing else I can do.
{62406}{62482}- Shit.|Okay, everybody, here we go.
{62483}{62557}Quiet, please. And four, three, two...
{62558}{62635}We cast out this unclean spirit.
{62670}{62724}Depart from here, Satan.
{62725}{62786}Depart, every demonic power...
{62787}{62867}...every infernal adversary, every legion.
{62868}{62901}I command you.
{62902}{62964}I command you in the name of God...
{62965}{63092}...in the names of all his heavenly|angels, to be gone from this cell phone.
{63093}{63124}I command you...
{63125}{63237}...by the judge of the living and the|dead, you will leave my sister alone.
{63238}{63300}Come out, I say, in Jesus' name!
{63301}{63350}You serpent!
{63351}{63391}Devil!
{63392}{63446}In the name of Jesus of Nazareth...
{63447}{63555}...you will haunt this child of God|no more:
{63572}{63680}Stop tormenting my sister.|You will come out now!
{63855}{63910}I am calling you by name, Satan.
{63911}{63977}Come out. Show yourself!
{64087}{64169}Depart. Depart this place. Depart.
{64170}{64247}Hey, hey, you guys, take it easy.|I'm a cop.
{64655}{64717}Keep rolling. Keep rolling.
{65060}{65160}Taylor? Taylor.
{65162}{65222}Taylor.
{65702}{65810}Beth, hey. You okay? Yeah?
{65925}{66007}Everybody back off.
{66015}{66120}Did you get that, huh?|Please tell me you got it.
{66121}{66171}Huh?
{66172}{66220}Ah...
{66720}{66784}Tomorrow.
{66785}{66840}You weren't there, Mickey.|You didn't see this.
{66841}{66904}- This girl needs protection.|- From what?
{66905}{67015}The ghost in her cell phone?|Tell her to call customer service.
{67016}{67066}Jack, Mickey's got a point.
{67067}{67135}Best use of people here|is we find the doer.
{67136}{67179}Yeah.
{67180}{67265}You're doing a great job so far.
{67947}{67986}Voice call received...
{67987}{68112}Saturday, June 17th, 7:55 p.m.
{68113}{68179}Why?
{68180}{68285}Please, just tell me why.
{68580}{68702}Look, are you sure you wanna stay here?|Maybe you could stay with family instead?
{68703}{68795}- Well, my father's dead.|- Well, what about your mother?
{68860}{68935}She and I don't talk very much.
{68950}{69020}- You don't have to stay.|- That's not gonna happen, okay?
{69021}{69092}I'm not going anywhere.
{69452}{69552}Look, this isn't over yet.
{69553}{69594}All right?
{69595}{69750}- There's still time to figure this out.|- Not before 7:55 tonight.
{69890}{69972}- Jesus. Beth, what happened here?|- Oh!
{70060}{70120}How old were you|when you got those?
{70121}{70205}Seven? Eight?
{70235}{70310}Was it your mother?
{70357}{70427}Did your father know?
{70490}{70612}When I call you, I expect you to come.|Do you hear me?
{70650}{70694}Do...
{70695}{70740}::you:::
{70741}{70785}...hear me?
{71245}{71300}My father knew.
{71340}{71411}Cry, baby, cry
{71412}{71481}You're disgusting.
{71482}{71585}Go ahead. Go cry to your father.
{71987}{72060}Daddy?
{72142}{72217}Daddy?
{73255}{73316}Hello.
{73317}{73385}Yeah. Okay.
{73386}{73447}Where?
{73450}{73509}All right. All right, thanks.
{73510}{73625}That was Missing Persons.|They found Laurel. She's in a foster home.
{73655}{73718}She was at Saint Luke's|when it caught fire.
{73719}{73779}- Wait. So she was still at the hospital?|- Yes.
{73780}{73882}She'd cut her arm, and there'd been|a report to Child Protective Services.
{73883}{73947}They were holding her|until she could be examined.
{73948}{74010}What about her mother?|Do you know where she is?
{74011}{74097}She hasn't been seen since the fire.
{74115}{74237}- Well, do you think we could talk to Laurel?|- You can try.
{74367}{74487}Laurel? There are some people here|to see you.
{74607}{74705}Hi, Laurel. My name's Jack.
{74765}{74845}It's a cute little teddy bear you got there.
{74872}{74954}Does your teddy bear have a name?
{74955}{75035}She hasn't spoken since the fire.
{75090}{75129}Laurel, listen to me.
{75130}{75192}It's very important|that we find your mother.
{75193}{75272}Do you know where she is right now?
{75305}{75397}Laurel, do you know|where your mother went?
{75402}{75482}Do you know where she is?
{75667}{75740}Do you think there's maybe|some way that you could talk to her?
{75741}{75830}L...|You wanna try talking to her?
{75930}{76060}What's wrong?|It's just the song the bear plays.
{76110}{76169}Laurel, honey?
{76170}{76235}Honey, do you know|where your mother is?
{76236}{76266}Laurel?
{76267}{76299}Can you tell...? Look at me.
{76300}{76380}Can you tell us? Do you know?|Can you say something?
{76381}{76472}Where is your mother? Goddamn it.
{76545}{76626}Oh, that was great, you know?|You really have a way with kids.
{76627}{76707}We have four hours left.|We're not gonna find her in time.
{76708}{76759}Yes, we will.|The first thing we'll do...
{76760}{76826}...is go downtown|and hit the department computers.
{76827}{76892}Everybody leaves a trail,|ATM machines, credit cards.
{76893}{76939}- We'll track Marie that way.|- You do that.
{76940}{77032}I'll find out about the fire at Saint|Luke's. Everything seems to start there.
{77033}{77099}Are you out of your mind?|Don't even think about that.
{77100}{77200}- I'm not letting you out of my sight.|- We'll get more done if we split up, okay?
{77201}{77270}And I'm safe until 7:55 p.m.
{77271}{77311}All right.
{77312}{77380}- I'll meet you at the library at 7 sharp.|- Okay.
{77381}{77456}Here, take my other phone.
{77457}{77530}Call me if you need me.
{79327}{79395}Dr. Nelson, please report to Cardiology.
{79396}{79441}Dr. Nelson, please report...
{79442}{79550}- Can you ask him to hurry, please?|- I've already called him twice.
{79560}{79672}- Miss Raymond. Mm-hm.|- Dr. Painter? I need your help.
{79673}{79728}You were the doctor|on the children's ward...
{79729}{79782}...the day of the fire|at Saint Luke's Hospital?
{79783}{79811}- That's right.|- Okay.
{79812}{79886}Do you remember a little girl,|Laurel Layton? She was 6.
{79887}{79997}She had cut herself and you made her|stay there so the CPS could investigate.
{80040}{80066}Shit.
{80067}{80124}Sure, I remember her.|Her sister had just died...
{80126}{80182}...and one of the nurses|filled out a report.
{80183}{80224}Right. Do you remember her mother?
{80225}{80325}Was her mother there when the fire|started? It was during visiting hours?
{80326}{80425}That wouldn't have made a difference.|The mother was there all the time.
{80802}{80862}Excuse me. I'm looking for a student,|her name is Beth.
{80863}{80932}She was supposed to be here|earlier today.
{80937}{80969}Where are you?
{80970}{81045}I think Marie Layton was in the hospital|when it burned down.
{81046}{81091}I think that she might've died there.
{81092}{81144}Impossible. All the bodies were identified.
{81145}{81250}I know, but what if they didn't find her?|What if her body's still inside?
{81251}{81355}She was a sick woman, a child abuser.|What if her body is still inside...
{81356}{81425}...and her spirit's there,|moving through the phones...
{81426}{81485}...attacking people?
{81505}{81587}Okay, all right. Where are you?|I'll come get you.
{81588}{81702}Well, here we are, miss, Saint Luke's.
{81703}{81754}What's left of it, anyway.
{81755}{81812}Beth, no! Wait for me, all right?|I'm on my way.
{81813}{81895}Hurry, there's not much time.
{88230}{88285}Shit!
{89160}{89235}- It's okay, it's okay.|- She's coming for me. She's coming.
{89236}{89310}- Okay, come on. Let's go.|- She's coming.
{89515}{89605}No! No!
{89750}{89825}What the hell is that?
{89840}{89900}Come on, let's go!
{89980}{90060}- Try those doors right there.|- Uhn!
{90890}{90948}Jack!
{90950}{91007}Jack!
{91550}{91610}No!
{94095}{94160}Beth!
{97037}{97122}Please don't hurt me.
{97182}{97250}Please.
{97307}{97485}Forgive me.
{97500}{97572}Why?
{97575}{97635}Why?
{98407}{98461}She had to be the first.
{98462}{98564}She had to have my sister's number|stored in her cell phone.
{98565}{98665}I know what she was,|but I have this feeling that she...
{98666}{98757}...brought me here or something|to protect me.
{98777}{98877}Otherwise, why am I still alive?
{99200}{99277}Broken pile ready to go?|Yeah.
{100127}{100166}Do you wanna come in?
{100167}{100260}No, I've gotta go tell Laurel|that her mother's gone.
{100261}{100325}Besides, you look like|you could use some rest.
{100326}{100382}Yeah.
{100410}{100492}Maybe you could call me sometime.
{100493}{100552}How about tomorrow?
{100555}{100627}Tomorrow would be nice.
{102467}{102590}It's just as well.|I'll tell her myself in the morning.
{102735}{102816}What is it?|- That's Laurel's, isn't it?
{102817}{102930}It looks like hers.|Yeah, that's the teddy bear.
{103275}{103319}It's a nanny cam.
{103320}{103417}Records what goes on in the kid's room.
{103647}{103729}We'll come in here...
{103730}{103809}...and sit you down.
{103810}{103920}Now, be a nice little girl.
{104475}{104540}Oh, my God.
{104707}{104815}Now, this will only hurt a little.
{104832}{104900}Hey, guys...
{105065}{105157}Get away from her!
{105185}{105229}It was you.
{105230}{105317}It was you the whole time.
{105385}{105467}I should've known.
{105555}{105622}Mama!
{105625}{105692}Please, help me! Mama!
{105715}{105775}Mama!
{107457}{107530}Hi, Laurel. It wasn't|your mother who hurt you.
{107531}{107597}It was your sister, Ellie, wasn't it?
{107732}{107840}But she always gave me candy.
{107887}{107967}- More stuff from the hospital?|- Yep. CSU will go through it tomorrow.
{107968}{108045}- See you later.|- Yeah. Take it easy, man.
{109370}{109475}Voice call received Saturday, June 17th...
{109476}{109557}...11 p.m.
{109622}{109661}No.
{109662}{109740}No, wait. Wait, no!
{109862}{109935}I... I just thought|you should hear this, Jack.
{109936}{110002}Jack?
{110415}{110495}Come on. Come on, pick up.
{110607}{110694}Hi. No one's home, leave us a message.
{110695}{110812}Beth, listen, okay?|Marie wasn't the first, it w...
{110885}{110934}So, look, you were right.
{110935}{111015}Marie wasn't trying to kill you|at the hospital. She was trying...
{111016}{111049}...to protect you, all right?
{111050}{111147}She was trying to|keep her daughter away from you.
{111190}{111252}Call me.
{113737}{113788}- Hey, are you all right?|- Yeah.
{113790}{113839}Look, it wasn't Marie, all right?
{113840}{113930}The whole time it was Ellie.|She made the very first phone call.
{113952}{114025}What's that?
{114455}{114537}No. No, wait. No!
{114560}{114652}No!
{115450}{115510}Aah!
