00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,084
Eagle, say again.
Repeat, please, Eagle.

2
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:36,359
Zero One Zero, can you confirm deployment?

3
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:38,444
Roger that, Eagle. Stand by.

4
00:00:42,198 --> 00:00:44,492
Copy that. We got target confirmed.

5
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:47,829
Eagle is green for go.
Repeat, Eagle is green for go.

6
00:00:49,497 --> 00:00:51,478
Copy that. Deployment in 15 seconds.

7
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:55,545
Bombardier, give me a confirm
on target Three Zero Niner.

8
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:02,427
That's Three Zero Niner, confirm.

9
00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:03,782
Copy, Bombardier. OK.

10
00:01:03,886 --> 00:01:06,389
In three... two... one.

11
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:19,319
Falling.

12
00:01:26,722 --> 00:01:28,390
My worst fear is falling.

13
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,291
Falling like a bomb.

14
00:01:36,836 --> 00:01:39,860
You see, life for me is about distractions.

15
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:44,135
I try to keep looking up
and forget about what's down.

16
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:47,889
But when I dream,

17
00:01:49,036 --> 00:01:50,391
I fall.

Old soldier

23
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:16,042
Combat soldier

24
00:02:16,146 --> 00:02:18,023
Combat soldier

25
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:19,691
Pick up your weapon and follow me

26
00:02:20,108 --> 00:02:21,673
Pick up your weapon and follow me

27
00:02:21,673 --> 00:02:23,341
Follow me to victory

28
00:02:23,758 --> 00:02:25,426
Follow me to victory

Screaming Eagles

00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,602
Pick up your weapon and follow me

34
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:36,583
Pick up your weapon and follow me

35
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,356
Follow me to victory

36
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:40,441

Airborne soldier

00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:49,304
Pick up yourjumpers and follow me

42
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:51,390
Pick up yourjumpers and follow me

43
00:02:51,494 --> 00:02:53,371
Follow me to victory

44
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:55,248
Follow me to victory...

45
00:02:57,542 --> 00:03:00,670
Man, you grabbed me. You grabbed me.

46
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,860
You can't do that, man. Well, it's a foul.

47
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:04,945
I didn't grab you.

48
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:06,301
Dude, you grabbed me then.

49
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:07,969
You can't do that.

50
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:09,429
Man, I didn't grab you.

51
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:10,680
Why are you lying?

52
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:13,078
Man, Elwood. Yo, Elwood, man.

53
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:14,851
He grabbed me, right? You saw it.

54
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:17,979
I don't know. Maybe.

55
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,898
- See, man, you can't grab like that.
- Fuck you, man.

56
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,754
- Fucking holding...
- You wanna try it again, motherfucker?

57
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:07,403
Let's go, baby.
Hey, Video, throw me the goddamn ball.

58
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:09,176
OK, but I'm quarterback. Can I be?

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,887
- Come on. Come on.
- All right. Let's see what they got.

60
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:27,110
Hey, yo, can I play?

61
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:29,717
Whoa, Parsons, got something for me there?

62
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:35,765
- You put it in the battery?
- Yeah, no problem.

63
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:38,789
Hey, can I play?
I was champion wide receiver at high school.

64
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:40,144
I can catch that ball, man.

65
00:04:40,144 --> 00:04:44,315
- You're so fucked up, you couldn't catch a bus.
- Don't be such a pussy and let him play.

66
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:46,922
Come on. Get down. Get down.

67
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:48,382
On "hutt". Down.

68
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:49,842
Come on. Come on.

69
00:04:49,946 --> 00:04:51,406
- Gimme some action.
- Hutt.

70
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:09,444
These were my guys.

71
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:12,781
Fighting the dull fight.

72
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:15,701
Soldiers with nothing to kill except time.

73
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:17,473
They know that war is hell,

74
00:05:17,473 --> 00:05:18,725
but peace...

75
00:05:18,725 --> 00:05:21,227
peace is fucking boring.

76
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:33,114
Give me back the motherfucking ball.

77
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:49,693
Er, guys.

78
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:50,840
Guys.

79
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:51,987
Guys!

80
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:53,760
What?

81
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,741
Er, just letting you know.

82
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:57,096
Parsons is dead.

83
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:03,144
Parsons McCovey
was a casualty of war.

84
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:07,106
The only difference was that this was
the Cold War and he was a fucked-up junkie.

85
00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:09,609
There'd be no hero's burial for Parsons.

86
00:06:10,964 --> 00:06:12,737
I regret the death of your son immensely.

87
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:16,804
There was nobody in the battalion
I would have trusted more with my life.

88
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:20,557
In him were resplendent
the virtues of honour and loyalty

89
00:06:20,662 --> 00:06:23,581
to his country and God,
that keep our civilisation together.

90
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:26,501
He fell off the rooftop
while making technical repairs

91
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:29,003
to the antennae that guard against the enemy.

92
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:32,027
Technical repairs? Where did that come from?

93
00:06:32,027 --> 00:06:34,634
I tried to think
what McCovey might be doing up there.

94
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:36,928
OK, go on.

95
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:39,430
He died, though not in combat,
in the line of duty,

96
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,620
and he had his country uppermost in his mind.

97
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:45,582
My deepest regrets, Colonel Wallace Berman,
US Army, Commanding.

98
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,109
You kept this one short.

99
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:54,028
I thought it might be better
not to get lost in detail, sir.

100
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:56,739
I like the touch about me
trusting him with my life.

101
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:58,199
It's a new angle, sir.

102
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,659
Here's something, though.

103
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:02,161
The word "resplendent".

104
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:05,498
That's not a good word to describe a soldier.

105
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:07,792
We'd better come up with something else there.

106
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:12,588
What about "contained"? In him
were contained the virtues of honour and loyalty.

107
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:15,091
- That's much better.
- Oh, much better, sir.

108
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:17,593
Don't let the word "resplendent" leave this base.

109
00:07:17,593 --> 00:07:19,262
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:19,262 --> 00:07:21,764
OK. What is this? What have we here?

111
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:23,328
Just some requisitions, sir.

112
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:26,769
1,000 gallons of Mop & Glo.

113
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:29,272
My God. Do we really need that much?

114
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:31,357
Cleanliness is next to godliness.

115
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:41,784
Herman the German. How goes it?

116
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:43,765
How do you do, mein Freund? How are you?

117
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,747
Doing just fine. Just fine.

118
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:47,206
Shall we do business today?

119
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:48,458
Sure thing. Guys.

120
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:02,221
I think you'll be pleased.

121
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:16,089
That's beautiful.

122
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:19,530
Look at the sparkle.

123
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,407
That's real cleaning power.

124
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:22,554
Sehr gut Sheiße, ja?

125
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:24,327
Sehr gut Sheiße, mein Freund.

126
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:27,246
US Army's finest. 500 gallons ready to go.

127
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:30,375
Three things I love about Germany:

128
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,564
My Mercedes-Benz:

129
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:36,631
No speed limit on the autobahn:

130
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:40,176
And a black market
for anything I can get my hands on.

131
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:41,427
Fight The Power

132
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:44,347
The number, another summer

133
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:46,641
Sound of the funky drummer

134
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:49,143
Music hittin' your heart
cos I know you got soul

135
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:51,020
Brothers and sisters

136
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,480
Listen if you're missing y'all

137
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:54,253
Swingin' while I'm singin'

138
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:56,964
Givin' what you're gettin',
knowin' what I know

139
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:58,736
While the Black bands sweatin'

140
00:08:58,736 --> 00:08:59,988
And the rhythm rhymes rollin'

141
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:02,073
Got to give us what we want

142
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:04,263
Gotta give us what we need

143
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:06,661
Our freedom of speech is freedom or death

144
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:08,225
We gotta fight the powers that be

145
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:09,268
Let me hear you say

146
00:09:09,268 --> 00:09:10,310
Fight the power

147
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:13,021
Fight the power

148
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:14,794
Fight the power

149
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:17,714
Fight the power...

150
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:20,112
Hey, Elwood, what's up?

151
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:22,197
Outstanding, Hicks. How you doing?

152
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:24,908
So...?

153
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:28,036
You don't look so good, Hicks.

154
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:31,477
- You got anything?
- Depends on what you want.

155
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,023
Er, it's... horse.

156
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:37,421
Can't help you.

157
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:38,672
You know, fuck, Elwood.

158
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:44,824
I outrank you, man, so don't give me any... crap.

159
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:46,909
I appreciate that, but I can't help you.

160
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:49,412
Look, man, I don't do retail. I only cook the shit.

161
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:51,602
Why don't you go see Sergeant Saad?

162
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:02,550
There's basically
two types of guys in the army -

163
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:05,157
the motherfuckers and the motherfucked.

164
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,641
Sergeant Saad is the third kind.
He fucks the motherfuckers.

165
00:10:12,456 --> 00:10:14,646
Which is doable
when you're the chief MP by day

166
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,295
and the director of retail heroin sales by night.

167
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:22,674
Something that makes my life simple.

168
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:27,888
I just cook high-grade Turkish morphine
into smack and wholesale it straight to him.

169
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:29,348
Everyone's happy.

170
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:31,850
So, how much we get?

171
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,855
Well, after we give the Turk back his share,
we got er... nine grams.

172
00:10:36,855 --> 00:10:40,505
Nine grams? Six hours of cooking
and all we get is nine grams?

173
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:43,320
You wanna tell the Turk
you're not happy, be my guest.

174
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,448
Bullshit. We're the ones doing all the work,
taking all the risks,

175
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:48,221
and Saad's making all the profit.

176
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:49,993
Garcia, I just need you to do your job.

177
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:53,851
Can you watch those thermometers
and keep your mouth eating those hotdogs?

178
00:10:53,956 --> 00:11:00,316
Heroin, cocaine, marijuana,
lysergic acid, diethyl... Whatever the hell it is.

179
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:05,530
Amphetamines, traces of barbiturates,
estrogen...

180
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:06,677
Estrogen?

181
00:11:06,677 --> 00:11:08,762
McCovey was on the pill?

182
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:11,682
How could this be possible?

183
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:14,393
- Well, he might have taken it by mistake, sir.
- What?

184
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:17,000
The pill. He might have thought
it was something else.

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,649
Fine, but he didn't take heroin,
speed and cocaine by mistake, did he?

186
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:23,152
It seems unlikely, sir.

187
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:25,758
This isn't good, Elwood,
drugs on a base like this.

188
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:28,365
Did you know anything about this?

189
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:30,346
How could someone get drugs in?

190
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,327
I really don't know, sir.

191
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:34,830
I always try to keep away
from people like McCovey.

192
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:38,271
Elwood, we've got to try to clear this matter up,
goddamn it.

193
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:39,731
I cannot... Scratch that.

194
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:42,546
I will not have this kind of thing
going on at my base.

195
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:44,214
Do you understand what I'm saying?

196
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:48,177
My officer evaluation report goes
in front of General Lancaster in three weeks.

197
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:50,888
If I don't get that goddamn star, I'm finished.

198
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:54,016
- Sir, you've got to relax...
- Don't you tell me to relax!

199
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:58,395
You're an E4. I'm a goddamn full-bird colonel.
You don't talk to me like that.

200
00:11:58,395 --> 00:12:00,689
- You understand me, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

201
00:12:04,443 --> 00:12:06,528
Oh, Jesus, Elwood, I'm...

202
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:10,699
I didn't mean to take it out on you.

203
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:13,097
Elwood, I'm... I'm sorry.

204
00:12:13,202 --> 00:12:16,955
It's OK, sir. I understand
the kind of pressure you're under.

205
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,051
This isn't mine.

206
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:32,179
I don't know anything about it.

207
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:34,577
And there's no smoking in here.

208
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:39,895
I need someone to sign here. It says Berman.
You're Berman?

209
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:44,066
I'm Colonel Berman, all right, but I don't know
anything about any goddamn chair.

210
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:47,194
- I'm telling you, son, it's not mine.
- It is yours.

211
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:50,218
- Oh, Liz. Hello, darling.
- Isn't it beautiful? It's for you.

212
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:51,782
It's for me?

213
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:54,493
I got it for under 30.
They didn't know what they had.

214
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:57,621
- 30 thousand?
- I couldn't believe it was so cheap.

215
00:12:57,621 --> 00:13:00,541
- Dollars or Deutschmarks?
- What do you think, Elwood?

216
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:02,105
Well, can you sit on it, ma'am?

217
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:04,711
Of course you can't sit on it. It's an antique.

218
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:05,963
Oh, well, it's very nice.

219
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,152
Darling,

220
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:11,280
can I borrow Elwood for a few hours?
There's some things I need him to do.

221
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:15,868
God.

222
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:20,352
Wait. Almost. Almost.

223
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:33,073
...under the deal signed exactly a year ago
in Stockholm to build East-West trust,

224
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,950
and reduce the risk of war.

225
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:39,538
East and West have always feared
that such an enormous exercise

226
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:43,813
might be used as a cover for a build-up for war.

227
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:46,941
You didn't make it yet?

228
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:50,069
Sorry. You angry?

229
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:52,050
No.

230
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:56,221
Ray, honey. I need you to do me a favour.

231
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,226
The Colonel's giving a party
and I need you to find out about decorations.

232
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:06,440
- What's he want a party for?
- He wants to impress the General.

233
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,194
His position's under review
and I thought a party would help.

234
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:11,236
Will you?

235
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,843
Hm?

236
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:25,417
Oh, you mean a party party?

237
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:27,398
Like for everyone's fun.

238
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:28,545
Oh.

239
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,427
...are procedures
to ensure no cheating in future.

240
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:41,475
And all sides agree this first onside verification
of conventional forces

241
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:45,437
is a major step forward
in building new trust and confidence.

242
00:14:56,386 --> 00:14:58,680
Can you switch that off?

243
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:01,286
Just turn that engine off, come on over here.

244
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:10,462
- Is there a problem?
- Where are you taking this Hummer?

245
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:12,339
We have orders from Colonel Berman.

246
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:14,842
OK. Who are you?

247
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:17,031
Specialist Ray Elwood.

248
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:18,178
What's this?

249
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:21,515
We have orders
to pick up party decorations in Mannheim.

250
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:22,662
Party decorations?

251
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:25,060
Yes, First Sergeant.
Colonel's having a party.

252
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,354
Sounds like a pretty dangerous mission.

253
00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:31,525
No disrespect intended,
but may I ask who you are?

254
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:34,236
Yeah, you can ask.

255
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:37,156
I'm your new Top. First Sergeant Robert E Lee.

256
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:38,615
Well, pleased to meet you, Top.

257
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,284
Welcome to the 3-17th.

258
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:41,743
Thanks, Specialist.

259
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:45,080
- I didn't know we were getting a new Top.
- Why would you?

260
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,147
I'm Battalion Clerk here.
I usually do paperwork on all the transfers.

261
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:54,360
OK, thanks, guys. I'm sorry to keep you.

262
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,446
No problem.

263
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:04,579
Hold it for a second there.

264
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:06,351
You got the time, son?

265
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:08,645
Oh, yeah, it's almost ten.

266
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:10,939
That's a nice watch. Show me that.

267
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:13,129
Where did you get that?

268
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:15,736
My father gave it to me.

269
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:17,404
Your father gave it to you?

270
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:19,281
He must be quite a guy. What's he do?

271
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:21,054
He's a barber.

272
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:22,201
Barber?

273
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:28,457
Gee, he must cut a lot of hair.

274
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:31,689
Yeah.

275
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:34,922
OK, better be going, then.

276
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:38,258
Don't wanna be late
picking up them party decorations.

277
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:43,055
Let's go.

278
00:16:44,306 --> 00:16:45,974
Bear Witness

279
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:10,061
Bravo Two Zero.
Bravo Two Zero, come in.

280
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,317
Bravo Two Zero. Bravo Two Zero, come in.

281
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:20,384
Shit! Turn that down, man.
Turn down the fucking music, man.

282
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:23,720
Bravo Two Zero, please respond.
What's going on, Hicks?

283
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:31,958
Er... Bravo Two Zero here.

284
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:36,546
Bravo Two Zero, commence tactical
manoeuvre area Two Niner Alpha Romeo.

285
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:39,882
Take position on phase line
Foxtrot Delta Four Seven.

286
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:42,072
Fuck.

287
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:48,537
What the hell's Two Nine Alpha Romeo?

288
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:52,082
I got a very weird vibe from that guy.
I personally didn't like him.

289
00:17:52,082 --> 00:17:56,670
- He's our new Top. What do you expect?
- What was that shit about the Rolex, man?

290
00:17:56,774 --> 00:18:00,007
He could know about the operation,
he could know something.

291
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:03,552
Jesus Christ, don't get fucking paranoid, Garcia.
Just be cool.

292
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:04,803
I'm cool.

293
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:08,244
- Fuck, man. I can be cool.
- Good. That's why I'm telling you.

294
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:16,482
Figured out where we're going yet, man?

295
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:19,088
Er, no. We're going the wrong way.

296
00:18:19,193 --> 00:18:21,591
Shit, er... Hey, Johnnie,

297
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:23,676
make a... a left.

298
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:50,891
I told you to make a left across that field.

299
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:53,811
I did, man. I went left.

300
00:18:53,811 --> 00:18:56,730
Ich Bin Ein Arschloch

301
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,826
What was that bump?

302
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,285
Oh, shit, man.

303
00:19:10,494 --> 00:19:13,413
We just ran over a car, man.
We just squashed a car.

304
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:14,769
What kind of car?

305
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:16,542
A Volkswagen. A fucking Beetle.

306
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:18,001
Oh, no.

307
00:19:19,148 --> 00:19:21,234
We squashed a Beetle.

308
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,334
Look out, man.

309
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:39,481
Stop.

310
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:42,922
Stop!

311
00:19:50,742 --> 00:19:52,202
What's going on?

312
00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:01,691
What the hell are you doing here?

313
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:05,028
- Whoa!
- Stop!

314
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:06,383
Stop.

315
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:09,928
- These dudes are freaking me out.
- I don't like 'em, either.

316
00:20:09,928 --> 00:20:13,786
Hey, Johnnie, why don't you just
get us away from these fuckers?

317
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:25,152
What the fuck is he doing?

318
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:48,404
Holy shit! What the fuck was that?

319
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,452
What's wrong with these monitors?
They've gone all orange.

320
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:57,163
Johnnie, I thought I told you
to get us out of here.

321
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:31,364
That's our fucking unit.

322
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:32,719
Just up ahead.

323
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:35,013
Is that you back there, Bravo Two Zero?

324
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:37,724
Did you complete
your Two Niner Alpha Romeo?

325
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:41,478
Er... We er... completed that.

326
00:21:41,582 --> 00:21:44,502
OK, good work, guys. Get in formation.

327
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:48,047
Holy shit!

328
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:56,389
Oh, Jesus Christ!

329
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:58,266
These guys are dead.

330
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:16,096
Garcia, get in that truck and follow me.

331
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,243
What?

332
00:22:17,347 --> 00:22:20,267
- Hey, what's in the trucks?
- I don't know. Let's find out.

333
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:23,812
- Hey, no way, man.
- Just get in the fucking truck.

334
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:27,149
All right.

335
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:58,639
Uh-oh.

336
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:01,663
Jackpot.

337
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:04,374
Oh, shit. Holy shit!

338
00:23:04,374 --> 00:23:06,250
Grenade launchers.

339
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,023
MAG guns, stinger missiles.

340
00:23:08,127 --> 00:23:11,151
Jesus Christ, this is worth millions.
3 million maybe.

341
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:13,654
- Maybe $5 million.
- It's all brand-new.

342
00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:17,095
We gotta take this back.
This stuff gets us nothing but heavy jail time.

343
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:20,327
- We're not taking this back.
- It's big time. We can retire on this.

344
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:21,995
I agree 100%/.

345
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,559
This is way out of our league.

346
00:23:23,664 --> 00:23:25,436
They kill you for stuff like this.

347
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:26,896
This is very serious shit.

348
00:23:26,896 --> 00:23:31,588
- There's no time like now. If we pull this off...
- There's no time like now? Are you crazy?

349
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:33,152
We're not weapons dealers.

350
00:23:33,152 --> 00:23:37,323
Would you kindly shut up?
Man, you're so negative. I'm trying to think.

351
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:38,887
Hey.

352
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:41,285
We're smart, right?

353
00:23:42,432 --> 00:23:43,475
Yeah.

354
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:44,831
Now, we could do this.

355
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:46,916
- We could do this.
- Oh, man.

356
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:55,154
What do we do with this shit?

357
00:23:56,196 --> 00:24:00,054
Well, first we need to store it.
And I know the perfect place.

358
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,396
Hey, this place gives me the creeps.

359
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:11,524
Yeah, it's supposed to.

360
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:34,568
- Hey, friend, what's up?
- Hey, Elwood.

361
00:24:34,568 --> 00:24:36,341
What's going on, man?

362
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,886
Nothing much. I got some stuff I need to store.
Can you help me out?

363
00:24:39,886 --> 00:24:41,658
Sure thing, man.

364
00:24:41,658 --> 00:24:44,995
Hey, are we gonna party afterwards?

365
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:46,872
Does the Pope shit in the woods?

366
00:24:48,957 --> 00:24:52,607
Hey, we can do a lot of things
with the cash we make off this.

367
00:24:54,171 --> 00:24:55,943
You know what I'm saying?

368
00:24:56,986 --> 00:25:01,678
Cos I was thinking about opening up a bar,
a nice, classy place.

369
00:25:01,678 --> 00:25:04,494
Me and you'd be partners.

370
00:25:04,494 --> 00:25:05,745
What do you think?

371
00:25:05,745 --> 00:25:07,830
Sure.

372
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:09,186
Why not?

373
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:15,859
Fuck!

374
00:25:22,428 --> 00:25:24,097
This one ready to go?

375
00:25:24,097 --> 00:25:25,974
Yeah, almost. Almost.

376
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,163
Easy.

377
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:47,245
You be all right?

378
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,705
Yeah.

379
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:52,250
- You ain't out in 30, I'm coming in.
- Don't worry, I'll be fine.

380
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:12,061
Turkish music

381
00:26:15,502 --> 00:26:18,526
- Elwood, how are you, my friend?
- Hey, Davood, how are you?

382
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:23,114
- Are you hungry? You want something to eat?
- Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks. I'd better get up.

383
00:26:24,157 --> 00:26:25,721
Say hi to your sister, all right?

384
00:26:32,915 --> 00:26:34,480
A lot of guns.

385
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,252
Where did you get all this stuff?

386
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:38,442
Santa Claus.

387
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:41,883
Santa Claus. That's funny.

388
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:45,219
He came down the chimney
and put it under the tree, hm?

389
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:46,262
Yup.

390
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:53,770
So...

391
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:56,481
...how about this?

392
00:26:57,523 --> 00:27:02,007
I give you 20 kilos on top of my next shipment,

393
00:27:02,111 --> 00:27:05,239
and you cook that
along with my share of the shipment,

394
00:27:06,074 --> 00:27:07,742
and you make a lot of money.

395
00:27:09,515 --> 00:27:11,287
- 20 kilos?
- Mm.

396
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,624
No. I want cash.

397
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:17,439
25.

398
00:27:18,795 --> 00:27:22,236
Look, I know somebody else
who's very interested in this merchandise.

399
00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:25,468
OK.

400
00:27:25,572 --> 00:27:27,553
Maybe they'll pay you cash.

401
00:27:29,222 --> 00:27:30,369
35.

402
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:31,829
29.

403
00:27:32,976 --> 00:27:36,312
I hate to break that 30 mark.
It's a religious thing with me.

404
00:27:36,312 --> 00:27:39,545
I'm afraid you'll have to,
cos 30 kilos is my final offer.

405
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:00,816
He's sending us 30Ks. One week.

406
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:03,423
30Ks?

407
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:05,717
Holy shit! That's, er...

408
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,115
- A lot.
- Well, how do we cook that much?

409
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,764
- It'll take us, like, a year.
- It's gonna be cool.

410
00:28:25,841 --> 00:28:30,116
French Foreign Minister Dumas
yesterday expressed discomfort...

411
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:34,600
...has welcomed East German reforms
with such open arms.

412
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,145
Politically, Mr Gorbachev
has never been more vulnerable.

413
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,107
This is really impressive.

414
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:45,235
Hey, guys, careful with my shit.

415
00:28:47,738 --> 00:28:50,032
You're pretty well equipped for a Spec Four.

416
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:51,596
I got receipts for everything.

417
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,951
I'm sure you do.

418
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:54,620
Hey, Top, look at this.

419
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,582
Check and see if there's anything inside.

420
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,445
Nothing.

421
00:29:11,512 --> 00:29:13,388
Hm? Mm-hm.

422
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:16,621
I'll bet this don't come cheap.

423
00:29:18,185 --> 00:29:21,522
This ain't exactly regulation stuff here,
is it, soldier?

424
00:29:21,522 --> 00:29:23,607
I don't really know.

425
00:29:24,858 --> 00:29:26,109
No, I guess not.

426
00:29:27,256 --> 00:29:31,949
Look, I'm gonna come round here tomorrow.
I want this place looking like a regular quarters.

427
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:33,408
You follow?

428
00:29:33,408 --> 00:29:37,579
Look, I know it ain't exactly regulation,
but the last Top didn't seem to mind.

429
00:29:38,622 --> 00:29:41,124
Well, him and me are a bit different.

430
00:29:44,774 --> 00:29:46,442
Look, Top,

431
00:29:46,547 --> 00:29:48,841
is there a way you and I could talk in private?

432
00:29:48,841 --> 00:29:50,822
These guys kinda make me nervous.

433
00:30:10,425 --> 00:30:12,302
Does it really have to play this way, Top?

434
00:30:12,406 --> 00:30:14,595
How do you suggest we play it?

435
00:30:16,577 --> 00:30:18,766
Well, what is it you want?

436
00:30:19,913 --> 00:30:23,980
I mean, you and me, I think we...
I think we got a lot in common.

437
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,378
Barriers are coming down in Hungary.

438
00:30:26,482 --> 00:30:29,298
So must they fall
throughout all of Eastern Europe.

439
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:33,364
For example, I see you're an admirer
of Japanese technology.

440
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,928
No problem.

441
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,388
The TV's yours.

442
00:30:36,492 --> 00:30:38,891
What I'm trying to say is,

443
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:42,540
what's it gonna take
for you and me to make nice?

444
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,043
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

445
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:51,195
The world has waited...

446
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:01,309
There's your answer.

447
00:31:41,453 --> 00:31:43,121
Elwood.

448
00:31:43,226 --> 00:31:45,311
Hey, this'll take a second.

449
00:31:45,415 --> 00:31:47,918
- I'll meet you down there.
- All right.

450
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:53,966
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

451
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,677
Nowhere, really.
Just had a couple of things to do.

452
00:31:56,677 --> 00:32:00,013
You're always off with your buddies.
I never see you any more.

453
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,307
It's just cos I've been really busy.

454
00:32:02,412 --> 00:32:04,497
- Busy?
- Yeah.

455
00:32:09,085 --> 00:32:11,170
- It's the guest list.
- Guest list?

456
00:32:11,275 --> 00:32:13,777
Party. Are you still helping me?

457
00:32:13,777 --> 00:32:16,175
Oh, the par... Yeah. Sure. Definitely.

458
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,678
We found out the Colonel's related
to the Iron Boar.

459
00:32:18,782 --> 00:32:21,910
- The Iron what?
- The Iron Boar, as in male pig.

460
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:25,455
I had a lawyer trace his family tree,
and he's a distant relative

461
00:32:25,455 --> 00:32:27,749
of a Civil War hero, John Bell Hood.

462
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:30,043
They called him the Iron Boar.

463
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:33,693
He'll announce it to General Lancaster
at the party, to help his promotion.

464
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,660
Sergeant Lee's daughter.

465
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,058
That's Top's daughter? You're kidding.

466
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,812
See something you like, Elwood?

467
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,865
Nice dive.

468
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:03,723
Thanks.

469
00:33:03,827 --> 00:33:06,121
The new Top, what do you think he's up to?

470
00:33:06,121 --> 00:33:09,041
He's a washed-up vet
who wants to throw his weight around.

471
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:11,648
But right now he's on your case, my man.

472
00:33:11,752 --> 00:33:13,420
Yeah, well.

473
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,297
Hey, check out this girl.

474
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,842
- Why?
- That's Top's daughter.

475
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:19,989
No shit.

476
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:22,596
You know what I'm thinking?

477
00:33:22,596 --> 00:33:25,307
You could be thinking almost anything.

478
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:29,061
- Maybe I should ask her out.
- You're fucking crazy, you know that?

479
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:32,189
Imagine how much that'll fuck with his head.

480
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:34,274
It's perfect.

481
00:34:18,798 --> 00:34:19,841
Hey.

482
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,576
- So, have you got a problem with your car?
- Yeah. It won't start.

483
00:34:25,576 --> 00:34:27,452
It might be the battery. Want me to look?

484
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:35,481
Hey, you're Robyn Lee, right?

485
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:38,297
Yeah. How d'you know that?

486
00:34:38,297 --> 00:34:42,155
I'm Battalion Clerk here for the First Battalion.
I kinda know everything.

487
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:43,719
Hm, must be handy.

488
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,179
Hey, you're a good diver.

489
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:49,349
I saw you in there at the pool,
diving off the high platform. How do you do that?

490
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:51,956
What do you mean? Are you scared of heights?

491
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,354
Let's just say you wouldn't get me up there.

492
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:55,918
You should try it.

493
00:34:56,023 --> 00:34:57,587
It's fun.

494
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,028
Fun? Why is it fun?

495
00:35:01,028 --> 00:35:04,156
Falling through air. It's kinda cool.

496
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:06,658
You're kidding me. You like falling?

497
00:35:06,658 --> 00:35:08,848
Sure. Why not?

498
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:14,270
Hey, I think I found the culprit.
You wanna give that a try?

499
00:35:23,342 --> 00:35:25,948
- What a guy!
- That's me.

500
00:35:25,948 --> 00:35:27,617
Actually, I'm Ray Elwood.

501
00:35:27,617 --> 00:35:28,972
Everyone calls me Elwood.

502
00:35:28,972 --> 00:35:31,996
- Thanks for fixing my car, Elwood.
- Yeah. No problem.

503
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,499
You wanna go out Friday night?

504
00:35:36,897 --> 00:35:41,693
It's a vineyard I visited last summer,
just a small one in the Napa Valley.

505
00:35:41,798 --> 00:35:43,362
Pinot grapes.

506
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:45,134
It's for sale.

507
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:48,575
- You thinking of buying it, sir?
- Well, I wish.

508
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:52,850
No. But I have a pretty decent collection
back home,

509
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,708
and I've always wondered what it would be like
to make my own wine.

510
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,045
I could just about afford it.

511
00:36:01,505 --> 00:36:03,590
Of course it's unrealistic.

512
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,159
Have you heard about those two missing trucks?

513
00:36:10,264 --> 00:36:14,434
- What trucks, sir?
- During Reforger two trucks went missing.

514
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:18,918
The drivers were killed in an accident with a tank
at some gas station out near Karlsruhe.

515
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:21,733
They found the bodies,
but they can't find the trucks.

516
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:23,402
How odd.

517
00:36:23,402 --> 00:36:25,904
- You wanna hear the best part?
- What's that, sir?

518
00:36:25,904 --> 00:36:29,032
It's Colonel Marshall's infantry,
so he's taking the heat.

519
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:31,222
Great news, sir.

520
00:36:32,995 --> 00:36:35,497
Elwood, could I tell you a little secret?

521
00:36:36,853 --> 00:36:38,208
Of course, sir.

522
00:36:39,355 --> 00:36:42,588
Have you heard
of the Civil War General John Bell Hood?

523
00:36:42,588 --> 00:36:43,630
The Iron Boar?

524
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,133
You know of him?

525
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:49,470
- Everybody knows the Iron Boar.
- I didn't know he was so well known.

526
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:52,910
- Mm.
- It turns out that I am an actual relative.

527
00:36:53,953 --> 00:36:57,811
A relative of the Iron Boar? Awesome.

528
00:36:57,811 --> 00:37:02,399
I want you to keep it under your hat.
I'm gonna surprise the General at the party.

529
00:37:03,963 --> 00:37:05,319
Excuse me.

530
00:37:08,343 --> 00:37:11,158
Private First Class Brian Knoll
reporting for duty, sir.

531
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,973
I'm not an officer, so you can cut the "sir" crap.

532
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:16,580
- Sorry.
- What do you want?

533
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,978
I just arrived. The orderly sent me down here.

534
00:37:18,978 --> 00:37:21,272
Oh, great. Is that your 201 file?

535
00:37:21,376 --> 00:37:23,462
Yes, sir. Er... yes.

536
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:33,680
You can sit down if you want.

537
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:40,458
So, how come they assigned you here?

538
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,709
I put in for it.

539
00:37:41,814 --> 00:37:46,193
My fiancée is here on base,
so we arranged to transfer together.

540
00:37:46,193 --> 00:37:47,861
Ah, how sweet.

541
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:49,008
Who is she?

542
00:37:49,008 --> 00:37:51,406
Margolis, Carol Ann, Private First Class.

543
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:55,369
You call her by her last name?
What do you do, salute in bed?

544
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,355
It says here they put you in 5-19.

545
00:38:02,355 --> 00:38:03,502
Yeah.

546
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,777
That's my room.

547
00:38:07,777 --> 00:38:10,905
Didn't... Didn't Sergeant Lee tell you?

548
00:38:10,905 --> 00:38:12,573
We're gonna be roommates.

549
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,474
So while Carol Ann's been here for six months,

550
00:38:17,578 --> 00:38:21,436
I'm stuck in San Antonio,
just pulling whatever strings I could,

551
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:25,712
kissing the Base Commander's ass
like you would not believe, not literally, but...

552
00:38:25,712 --> 00:38:27,901
Boy, oh, boy. I mean, so check this out.

553
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:30,091
- So then...
- Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up.

554
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:32,176
I guess I don't really give a shit.

555
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,684
You're only here cos Sergeant
fucking dickhead Lee's on my case.

556
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:44,689
Until I get that shit straightened out, I don't
wanna hear about your girlfriend, or anything.

557
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:45,419
You roger that?

558
00:38:49,485 --> 00:38:53,760
Anderson underwent his rookie season
at Milwaukee as a starting quarterback...

559
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:00,330
Hiya, Top. How's it going?

560
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:03,666
- Daddy, this is Ray Elwood.
- Oh, yeah, we already met.

561
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,752
I'm going out. I won't be home till late.

562
00:39:21,288 --> 00:39:23,895
How the hell can you afford this car?

563
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:25,667
Oh, I got a great deal.

564
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,440
Mercs are a lot cheaper in Germany.

565
00:39:30,464 --> 00:39:31,507
I don't believe it.

566
00:39:32,862 --> 00:39:33,905
What?

567
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:35,990
Your dad. He's following us.

568
00:39:41,517 --> 00:39:42,559
I don't believe it.

569
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:53,821
Hey, how's it going?

570
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:56,636
- Hey, Elwood.
- Looking good.

571
00:39:56,636 --> 00:39:57,679
Hey!

572
00:39:59,347 --> 00:40:01,432
Alle schon da.

573
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,854
Tut mir Leid.

574
00:40:06,854 --> 00:40:09,461
Mit diesen Schuhen können Sie nicht rein.

575
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:15,405
Blue Monday

576
00:40:32,922 --> 00:40:34,486
What's going on with you and my dad?

577
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,050
What do you mean?

578
00:40:37,093 --> 00:40:38,761
There's something going on.

579
00:40:39,908 --> 00:40:44,600
I'm the natural enemy of guys like your dad,
mostly cos I don't give a shit about the army.

580
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,999
If you don't give a shit, why did you join?

581
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:49,397
I didn't exactly have much of a say in the matter.

582
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:52,212
I got caught stealing a car
and the judge gave me a choice -

583
00:40:52,212 --> 00:40:54,819
six months in prison or three years in the army.

584
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,322
- I made the mistake of choosing the army.
- I get it.

585
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:59,407
My dad has a problem with guys like you.

586
00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:04,203
So you're out with me to piss him off?

587
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:06,706
No. I, er...

588
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,104
That's it, isn't it?

589
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:13,275
Yeah, that's...
I'm fucked up. I'm really sorry.

590
00:41:13,275 --> 00:41:15,465
Yeah, that's definitely fucked up.

591
00:41:15,465 --> 00:41:17,967
I'll take you home.
I didn't mean to get you into this.

592
00:41:17,967 --> 00:41:20,782
Are you seriously out with me
just to piss off my dad?

593
00:41:22,764 --> 00:41:24,119
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

594
00:41:24,223 --> 00:41:25,266
Are you crazy?

595
00:41:25,996 --> 00:41:29,646
He's the First Sergeant of your company.
He's not somebody you wanna piss off.

596
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,191
You realise, he's gonna cut your balls off.

597
00:41:34,546 --> 00:41:35,797
Yeah, probably.

598
00:41:37,466 --> 00:41:41,532
So, what if I stay?
There's a chance you're gonna lose your balls.

599
00:41:41,637 --> 00:41:43,096
Do you think I'm worth it?

600
00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:45,390
Yeah. Sure. Why not?

601
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,537
Fine.

602
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:49,248
Do you want one of these?

603
00:41:49,248 --> 00:41:51,751
- What is that?
- Ecstacy.

604
00:41:52,689 --> 00:41:55,192
How does it feel

605
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,841
To treat me like you do?

606
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,595
When you've laid your hands upon me

607
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:06,140
And told me who you are

608
00:42:07,183 --> 00:42:09,998
I thought I was mistaken

609
00:42:10,937 --> 00:42:13,544
I thought I heard your words

610
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:17,089
Tell me, how do I feel?

611
00:42:18,027 --> 00:42:20,738
Tell me now, how do I feel?

612
00:42:22,094 --> 00:42:24,701
Those who came before me

613
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:28,559
Lived through their vocations

614
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:45,555
I've got something I wanna show you.

615
00:42:50,977 --> 00:42:52,228
What is it?

616
00:42:52,228 --> 00:42:53,688
A burn.

617
00:42:54,731 --> 00:42:55,878
How did it happen?

618
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:57,963
When I was a kid, my dad was drunk

619
00:42:57,963 --> 00:43:01,612
and he dropped a cigarette on my nightgown
and it caught fire.

620
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:03,698
It was an accident.

621
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:09,746
It's really ugly, isn't it?

622
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:57,919
Get up! Get up! Get up!

623
00:43:58,023 --> 00:44:01,047
At the armoury. Full gear. Five minutes!

624
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:03,132
Five minutes?

625
00:44:03,237 --> 00:44:04,384
Count 'em.

626
00:44:11,787 --> 00:44:14,811
- Elwood, what the hell are we doing?
- Target practice.

627
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:16,896
Elwood, hand me your rifle.

628
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,005
I want you to pack the M-60.

629
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,778
I'm not qualified to operate it.

630
00:44:23,778 --> 00:44:27,115
There's a time and a place.
You're gonna learn in the heat of battle.

631
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:28,470
Hand it to him.

632
00:44:32,328 --> 00:44:33,892
The 60's a heavy mother.

633
00:44:35,561 --> 00:44:37,437
So am I.

634
00:45:01,316 --> 00:45:04,027
What's the matter, Elwood?
Your fitness lacking?

635
00:45:04,027 --> 00:45:07,780
You wanna do the confidence course
a few times to get you back into shape?

636
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,866
No, thanks, Top. I'll be fine.

637
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:43,545
I direct your attention to that spot over there
that has been marked with an X.

638
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:50,636
We have here the prototype
of a new Russian tank.

639
00:45:51,678 --> 00:45:58,352
We are here to test the vulnerability of said tank
to sustain fire from an infantry platoon.

640
00:46:05,755 --> 00:46:07,006
Squad...

641
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:11,073
Lock and load one magazine.
Take up a good firing position.

642
00:46:24,002 --> 00:46:27,026
You will fire on my command.

643
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:35,681
Sustain fire until the order
to cease fire's been given.

644
00:46:39,747 --> 00:46:41,311
Ready?

645
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:44,857
Fire!
