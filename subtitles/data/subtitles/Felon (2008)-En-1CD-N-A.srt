Felon

2
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,349
You have not touched your cereal yet. 
Are you not hungry?

3
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:57,371
What is there for today? 

4
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,351
We must give the meal service 
the last check. 

5
00:01:00,638 --> 00:01:04,983
decoration of the church and I must 
see what clothing. 

6
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:08,478
I told them what he wanted ... 
- ¿Cuánto? 

7
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:14,989
$ 650. 
- Do you $ 650? It's a lot of money. 

8
00:01:16,334 --> 00:01:18,441
Come here. 

9
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:21,986
What do you think of that? ¿Estás insurance? 
- Yes. 

10
00:01:22,344 --> 00:01:24,916
The man said that you do. 
- ¿De truth? 

11
00:01:25,138 --> 00:01:28,585
It is a wedding dress. 
And I want to see you well. 

12
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:31,740
And the groom as well. 

13
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:42,250
Thank you. 

14
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:47,895

16
00:02:06,554 --> 00:02:08,386
¿Nena? 
- Dime. 

17
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:12,790
We have the loan for the business. 
- Do not tell me. ¿Estás playing? 

18
00:02:13,502 --> 00:02:18,156
That's great. 
- I have to find 5more men. 

19
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:23,175
I have to form a second team 
of 30men. 

20
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,745
I'm so proud of you my love. 

21
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:33,383
You've built the entire business. 
- No, we did. 

22
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:07,893
There is someone in the house. 

23
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:14,137
Let's look for Mickey, 
do not say anything. 

24
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,462
Stay close to me. 

25
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:39,662
Everything is fine. 

26
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:46,254
Stay in this room. 

27
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:06,285
¿Wade? 

28
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:10,766
Stand, ¡ What are you doing?! 
- Backs. 

29
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:13,727
¡ I said to you! 

30
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,513
Devils. 

31
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:39,966
What is happening Wade? 
-- ¡ Stay at home! 

32
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:44,323
¡ Stay at home! 

33
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,098
My God. 

34
00:04:56,606 --> 00:05:00,176
I will call 911Wade. 

35
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:36,647
¿Podemos lead to child 
to bed? 

36
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:52,447
We did not find any weapons 
nowhere. 

37
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:56,957
He had his wallet in his hand, 
perhaps you thought ... 

38
00:05:57,225 --> 00:06:01,364
No, what I saw was that he was looking 
something I thought was a gun or a weapon. 

39
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:04,433
I told him to stop and not 
is vires. 

40
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:07,530
So went the bat 
the shoulder and fell. 

41
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:11,756
Look, if I was at home when it happened 
and was armed at least .... 

42
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:14,009
We can make a case 
for self-defense. 

43
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,813
The problem is that it was no longer 
a threat when he left the house. 

44
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:23,216
And he chased out with a bat 
and killed him in a coup. 

45
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:25,054
Wait a moment, please. 
I did not want ... 

46
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:29,521
Sorry, we will arrest him 
for murder. 

47
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:33,773
¿Asesinato? 
¿Están crazy? 

48
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:36,767
The rate was robbing us. 
I was in a room with my child. 

49
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,360
Mrs., I understand. 
- What was supposed to make Wade ... 

50
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:41,227
Wait for the kind he fired first. 

51
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:45,372
No, what we had to do was stay 
inside and call 911. 

52
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:25,061
Look at the wall hands on their heads. 

53
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,347
¿Alguna membership? 
- No. 

54
00:07:56,581 --> 00:07:59,783
Press this button in case 
emergency. 

55
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:43,312
I have you son of a whore. 
You were you son of a whore. 

56
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,853
Son of a bitch. 

57
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:51,902
¿Quieres Jodo? 
You are going to have to clean it. 

58
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:04,970
Fighting in the courtroom. 

59
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:11,662
¡ Leave go! 
¡ Leave go! 

60
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,854
Cloudy place. 

61
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:24,215
Suélteme. 
Did nothing. 

62
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:27,619
You're dead son of a whore. 
You're more than dead. 

63
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:33,112
Central Prison for men. 

64
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,910
¿Estás long? 

65
00:09:54,372 --> 00:09:57,122
Do not you are a skinhead? 

66
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:03,630
We draw on Wednesdays and Saturdays. 
You must look after your bones. 

67
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,329
Time in prison: 
one day. 

68
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,547
Hello. 
- Hello. 

69
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:36,822
What happened in your face? 
- I attacked. 

70
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,806
We need to talk to someone. 
That is not going to help Laura. 

71
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:43,359
¿Tú you all right? 
How is Mickey? 

72
00:10:43,703 --> 00:10:48,151
It frightened. Just a question 
and you do not know what more to say. 

73
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,128
I told him that departure. 
If it does not help me stay with my mother. 

74
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:57,972
Grandioso. 
- I do not feel safe at home. 

75
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,642
Everything will be fine. 
I promise you. 

76
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:06,208
I have to help you out of here. 

77
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:11,182
I will put to a public attorney. 
Let me see what I said. 

78
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:28,703
Mara and what I am going to represent. 
Taste-in know it. 

79
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:34,075
For mere formality put a bond 
one million dollars. 

80
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,023
If you have a million dollars 
can afford it now. 

81
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:40,160
No, I do not have. 
- ¿Alguien that can help? 

82
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:44,485
¿Sus parents? 
- Died 9years ago. 

83
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:48,039
I will do what it can 
for out of this. 

84
00:11:49,398 --> 00:11:52,073
State Prison 
San Quentin. 

85
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:13,738
Come inside. 

86
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,291
Do not breathe smoke. 

87
00:12:21,995 --> 00:12:26,622
¿Dijeron why the mutiny? 
- No, we all calm. 

88
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:29,703
With John there is always a reason. 

89
00:12:30,906 --> 00:12:33,020
You destroy ... 

90
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:42,748
Do not you stop advertising? 
- I know Gordon. 

91
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:45,040
Just looking for entertainment. 

92
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:51,334
We are talking about business John. 
They want to let you in the hole forever. 

93
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:54,744
And both do not want that. 

94
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:58,345
had been 26years yesterday. 

95
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,697
¿De that is what all this? 

96
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,992
You have to stop living in the past John. 
- I am the past. 

97
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:13,206
I wish you were a dead man 
walk instead of get in these walls. 

98
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:22,915
They're gonna transfer to start over; 

99
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:27,459
but after that there are no more favors. 
¿Me understand? 

100
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:37,224
I think it's another place Gordon, 
maybe not. 

101
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:45,007
Only portate bien, ¿lo you do? 

102
00:13:57,455 --> 00:13:59,118
What the hell is going on? 

103
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,141
The hearing should have been premilinar 
Indeed weeks. 

104
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:04,046
I need more time to 
build the case. 

105
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:06,429
But you have good news. 

106
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:12,038
The prosecutor has agreed to make a deal. 

107
00:14:12,246 --> 00:14:15,362
Wait, what does that mean? 

108
00:14:15,572 --> 00:14:18,915
What you pleaded guilty to 
reduce the sentence. 

109
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:22,664
means that you still have two 
years and start to comply immediately. 

110
00:14:22,908 --> 00:14:25,599
If not for you just dilo. 

111
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,170
Already have completed 97days, 
you would just 15months. 

112
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:33,169
What other options do I have? 
- We are going to trial with a jury. 

113
00:14:33,353 --> 00:14:37,184
You can take a year and you get processed 
for second-degree murder. 

114
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,889
You can give 15years to life imprisonment. 

115
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:45,186
Look, accepts the deal. 
It's the best offer. 

116
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:51,827
His señoría the defendant is considered 
guilty of murder, involuntary. 

117
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,775
We legacy to the agreement of 3years 
sentencing in a state prison, 

118
00:14:56,004 --> 00:15:01,666
The 97days that Mr. Porter has fulfilled 
in the county jail ... 

119
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,119
will be taken into account. 

120
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:10,818
Mr. Porter understands that this conviction can 
be used against them for violations or convictions 

121
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:13,861
that will result in additional time it add 
his judgement. 

122
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:15,281
Yes, your señoría. 

123
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:21,442
¿Entiende which will be punishable by bear 
Firearms and during his sentence 

124
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:27,345
Three years can not 
vote or leave the country without permission. 

125
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:30,463
¿Entiende terms? 
- Yes its señoría. 

126
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:37,044
Then Mr. Porter will meet 
3years in state prison 

127
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:41,073
and have already served 97days. 

128
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,243
Good luck. 

129
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:09,285
Partner, we must change the cursed house. 
This place is like. 

130
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:14,340
My name is Jake but 
I say Snowman. 

131
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:16,773
How your name? 
- Wade. 

132
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:26,268
¿Wade? Watch the one there. 
The kind of mustache. 

133
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:30,959
Is Dennis Samson. 
Do not you want to stick with him. 

134
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:36,336
It should be locked up while ago, 
but the mad dog is a genius. 

135
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:40,149
Fly under the radar with 
like a bird. 

136
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:43,372
Neither cards, or passes, nothing. 

137
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:47,296
The police did not find anything. 
- ¿Cuál is the plan? 

138
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:54,397
You and I are brothers, 
you better decide quickly. 

139
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,723
¿A what time is this game? 
- At 5. 

140
00:17:08,245 --> 00:17:11,340
What are you doing? 
- Escondido that Santos. 

141
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:16,019
He wants to fight with me 
but it's a girl. 

142
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:19,282
¿Cuál? ¿La white? 

143
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:25,121
She is great. 
- Yes, it is huge. 

144
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:29,486
Well, the flames and tell that you will not peel 
and endpoint. 

145
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:32,339
Just leave it. 

146
00:17:32,905 --> 00:17:38,414
Failing that, you know 
you give a kick. 

147
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:43,533
Come on, and salt here. 
Come on. 

148
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,478
See you later. 

149
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:53,097
Recalls that the weak are the 
they can not avoid problems. 

150
00:17:53,493 --> 00:17:57,284
I know Dad. 
- Okay, we are after. 

151
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:27,396
¿Y why these here? 

152
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:33,874
I had a fight in the county 
and made a deal with the prosecutor. 

153
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:37,154
That's shit partner. 
Everything is being very dirty. 

154
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,833
Find someone who protects you. 

155
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:45,041
Become a favor. 
When lowering the courtyard ... 

156
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:52,000
looking for your race and stay away 
the cursed monkeys. 

157
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:27,500
It is going to start. 
- What? 

158
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,234
We have a great fight 
at the bottom of the bus. 

159
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,010
There are many convicts involved 
there is a wounded. 

160
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,546
You put something on the seat did not say anything. 
- What are you doing? 

161
00:20:55,113 --> 00:20:57,198
¡ Sit down and Callens now! 

162
00:20:58,577 --> 00:21:03,939
Stay seated ¡ 
and silent! 

163
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:08,679
Or putting together a disaster in this bus in which 
committed a crime. 

164
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:34,115
Is Dennis Samson, put the other in 
the gap until we finish. 

165
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:37,137
¡ Bájenlos bus! 

166
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,483
¡ Get out of the bus! 
¡ Vamos! ¡ Get out! 

167
00:21:41,786 --> 00:21:44,111
It was not my weapon, I swear. 
- Let shit. 

168
00:21:44,314 --> 00:21:46,789
I was in my seat. 

169
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:54,002
Administrative segregation. 

170
00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:03,595
¡ Oh my God! 

171
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:15,830
¡ Listen! ¡ Guard! 

172
00:22:20,262 --> 00:22:22,771
Shit. 
Guard, please. 

173
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,727
¡ A telephone call evil! 

174
00:22:28,106 --> 00:22:31,120
A call evil. 
Shit. 

175
00:22:31,454 --> 00:22:35,166
Please God ... 
¡ should not even be here! 

176
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:46,152
Raise your head above the ground. 
Look at the eyes when you speak. 

177
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:48,950
We know that the man did not apuñaleaste 
in the dime who did it. 

178
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:53,148
I do not know. 
I found the gun under my seat. 

179
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:55,240
Someone must have left 
on the floor. 

180
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:59,412
¡ Lie! 
We know that Dennis was Samson, admit. 

181
00:22:59,915 --> 00:23:03,433
If you already know, ¿para do I need? 
- Son of a bitch, you will ... 

182
00:23:03,707 --> 00:23:07,037
Come on.

183
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:09,723
¿Me hear? 
- Wait a moment. 

184
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,487
Let me tell you that piece 
shit you're covering. 

185
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:19,476
You think you will love this 
or that will give you some protection. 

186
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:23,149
He is a murderer does not care a bledo 
someone like you. 

187
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,396
Look what they did to one of their own race ... 
Do not you have anything. ¡ Look at me! 

188
00:23:29,294 --> 00:23:34,230
When the time comes, 
you kill to protect themselves. 

189
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:40,827
The man she apuñalearon 
is in a critical condition. 

190
00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:45,003
If he dies going down 
an accomplice to murder. 

191
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:53,064
I do not know guys, 
I do not know what I feel. 

192
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:58,299
It has no case. 
- Leave. 

193
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:08,725

You hold a hand and climbs 
Foot, ¿entendido?

00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:50,887
Stay away. 

207

One hour a day of yard, 
3showers a week. 

208
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,803
That's it.

He did well, a true example. 

212
00:26:13,846 --> 00:26:15,914
The army enseñó me a lot.

00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:21,624
¿Ranger? 
- Mr Lo lost. 

214
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:24,935
It changed my career in DC. 
¿Alguna-action? 

215
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:31,088
See paint dry and when 
we look at the fingers. 

216
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:34,806
That is not going to serve in the Shu (solitary). 

217
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:37,489
¿Estamos well then?

00:26:57,243 --> 00:27:01,110
It has caused the problem in each house that has been 
why in isolation? 

224
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:05,152
I am not looking for a celebrity.

00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:05,223
I know you have a partner. 

305
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:08,474
Porter, the floor 
looked at the wall. 

306
00:36:08,828 --> 00:36:11,063
From knees, hands over his head. 

307
00:36:11,298 --> 00:36:14,536
I'm talking about you. 
Open-13. 

308
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:35,417
Letters of John Smith. 

309
00:36:36,304 --> 00:36:40,468
Any student of philosophy you 
I would say that the truth of human behavior 

310
00:36:40,643 --> 00:36:43,649
you're in the ability to deal with things 
as survivors ... 

311
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:48,907
understand human behavior 
is, blah, blah, blah. 

312
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:51,817
¿Alguien buy this shit? 

313
00:36:52,032 --> 00:36:54,141
I remember when I heard talk 
you the first time. 

314
00:36:54,355 --> 00:36:57,061
¿Mataste to those 16, 17people? 

315
00:36:57,323 --> 00:37:01,260
Personally, I think 
you're a damned hypocrite. 

316
00:37:01,451 --> 00:37:06,144
Write shits hoping that people 
take something from it. 

317
00:37:07,523 --> 00:37:09,542
Cursed imbecile. 

318
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:14,158
Looking for a religion to change the world 
to the children and now you. 

319
00:37:21,696 --> 00:37:24,043
They found it in your pocket. 

320
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,036
The family is everything, ¿cierto? 

321
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:33,463
I'm going to save this, 
for cuidártelo. 

322
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:39,097
Meter some shit in my house ... 

323
00:37:39,452 --> 00:37:43,647
and that is what you enseñaré 
the real revenge. 

324
00:37:44,398 --> 00:37:47,148
¿Estamos clear? 

325
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:52,320
Close the 13. 

326
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,941
Therein lies your compañero. 

327
00:38:10,506 --> 00:38:13,246
Porter and you can lift. 

328
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:16,285
Already have a compañero. 

329
00:38:20,743 --> 00:38:24,050
Do not you are a rapist, is not it? 

330
00:38:25,068 --> 00:38:27,819
How good will. 

331
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:32,222
I love this part. 
- Okay. 

332
00:38:46,612 --> 00:38:48,872
Already have it. 

333
00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:52,840
If Virata coughs into the wall. 

334
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:57,703
A but, towards dirígelo 
the door. 

335
00:38:58,138 --> 00:39:03,826
Urine on the tin. 
Do this and we will be fine. 

336
00:39:25,587 --> 00:39:29,216
Smith, Porter, 
Time courtyard. 

337
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:43,816
34, below, 
35down below 36, 37. 

338
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:48,119
Who's this fool? 
- Do not know. 

339
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:55,773
Hello Mr. Smith, 
what you need. 

340
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:01,031
Smith ¿Conocen this? 
- Oyeron that history was among the jackals. 

341
00:40:17,385 --> 00:40:19,247
This is who you spoke, Wade. 

342
00:40:19,498 --> 00:40:22,639
It was good what you did. 
- I was in San Quentin. 

343
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:25,558
¿Te goals in a problem? 

344
00:40:25,744 --> 00:40:28,644
It really was not a joke. 
- Yes, thank you. 

345
00:40:28,652 --> 00:40:31,437
He said the man who you are solid. 

346
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:34,651
¿Ustedes both have a brotherhood? 

347
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:38,392
No, we are in what 
really important. 

348
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:43,140
Why did that on the bus? 
- It was a damned. 

349
00:40:43,356 --> 00:40:48,629
He said the man who you need 
count with him. 

350
00:40:49,566 --> 00:40:51,499
Thank you. 

351
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:05,615
I heard you had one day bad. 
- Yes. 

352
00:41:07,158 --> 00:41:09,785
I was supposed to get married 
four months ago. 

353
00:41:22,127 --> 00:41:26,437
How is your son? 
- Michael. 

354
00:41:27,584 --> 00:41:33,022
It looks like you, 
in the eyes and mouth. 

355
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:37,461
Fortunately mine 
resembles her mother. 

356
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:41,893
¿Tienes a picture of them? 

357
00:41:42,511 --> 00:41:45,877
Jackson took me when I arrived. 

358
00:41:48,645 --> 00:41:53,190
Sorry. 
- On 24. 

359
00:41:54,186 --> 00:41:58,342
I remember everything as 
if this morning. Everything. 

360
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:03,896
The smell of your perfume leaving 
through the door 

361
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,208
and I looked as if it were 
the only man for her. 

362
00:42:09,575 --> 00:42:18,160
I married couple, she was sleeping in my 
chest, he liked to listen to breathe. 

363
00:42:20,744 --> 00:42:23,883
I can not forget. 

364
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:30,845
I can not drop. 
- What will. Saldrás here. 

365
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:36,062
But you were in the car, ¿cierto? 
- ¿En the car? 

366
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:40,212
In the courtyard you'll find yourself with someone, 
a gang. 

367
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:47,874
You think all you have to 
cruzarte do is not a black. 

368
00:42:58,381 --> 00:43:01,508
How you do? 

369
00:43:02,052 --> 00:43:07,453
The perception is the reality 
cree makes the mind and accept it. 

370
00:43:09,228 --> 00:43:11,493
¿Con who were speaking 
in the courtyard? 

371
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:14,483
What is this "24questions"? 

372
00:43:17,777 --> 00:43:22,019
His name is Bear, 
is a leader, a colleague 

373
00:43:22,237 --> 00:43:24,254
has the keys of the house. 

374
00:43:24,614 --> 00:43:29,489
It means that none of their 
Soldiers made no movement 

375
00:43:29,878 --> 00:43:32,342
until he tells you. 

376
00:43:32,574 --> 00:43:35,417
I do not know, as you know who is 
with whom. 

377
00:43:37,592 --> 00:43:40,275
Watch "Fish ".... 

378
00:43:40,638 --> 00:43:45,196
You enseñaré the politics of prison 
but you have to do something for me. 

379
00:43:45,605 --> 00:43:48,936
Yes, what? 
- Stay away from me in the yard. 

380
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,657
I understand. 
- Not so. 

381
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:54,730
This is my world until 
death separates us. 

382
00:43:54,931 --> 00:43:58,320
You're just a tourist. 
- Okay. 

383
00:43:58,523 --> 00:44:00,622
The first lesson for rates 
like you and me: 

384
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:03,609
what is white is not right. 

385
00:44:03,798 --> 00:44:08,256
The prison are not games 
the street is about race. 

386
00:44:08,503 --> 00:44:13,961
Bands: the northern and southern, 
believe me there's always war. 

387
00:44:14,289 --> 00:44:18,585
Blacks have many bands, 
do not forget their biceps. 

388
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:23,543
Asians are and the Pacific Islands, 
not bother to know who's who. 

389
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,522
All you hate. 

390
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:29,945
And you have the color of your skin, 
all whites are in a brotherhood ... 

391
00:44:30,136 --> 00:44:33,319
are the ones who make the show 
and seek to reclutarte ... 

392
00:44:33,591 --> 00:44:37,383
increase their numbers, metiéndote 
in drugs. 

393
00:44:37,604 --> 00:44:40,579
Watch out for callers 
to strike with whites. 

394
00:44:40,955 --> 00:44:45,035
If you do not do not have business 
Iran on you. 

395
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:46,974
How andas partner? 

396
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:51,490
¿Ves to the moño, this son of a bitch? 
- Yes. 

397
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:54,946
Patéalo for me. 
- You Blanquita. 

398
00:44:59,886 --> 00:45:02,138
No, do not do anything. 

399
00:45:04,192 --> 00:45:06,068
Dale in the face. 
Get up. 

400
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:11,760
Come on, hard. 

401
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,676
¿Los going to stop now Lieutenant? 

402
00:45:28,919 --> 00:45:30,887
Yes, the dispárale of 14. 

403
00:45:31,168 --> 00:45:33,870
But Mr. the're missing. 
Shoot-you are in the 14. 

404
00:45:36,911 --> 00:45:39,082
Come on, paste it. 
- Come on. 

405
00:45:40,759 --> 00:45:43,718
If you do not obey the ordenes you are commanded 
a message. 

406
00:45:44,156 --> 00:45:46,590
I can not do this. 

407
00:45:48,392 --> 00:45:53,708
Do not let adjournment. 
- No adjournment none. 

408
00:45:58,093 --> 00:46:00,355
That is the official enemy down there. 

409
00:46:00,531 --> 00:46:03,931
Les enseñas some weakness 
and you send a message to you. 

410
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,139
Do this and you're dead man. 
We treated as a shit. 

411
00:46:07,384 --> 00:46:08,695
¿es that what you want? 
- No. 

412
00:46:08,896 --> 00:46:11,911
That's right, that's not what you want. 
It is very simple. 

413
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,914
¿Estás in the car or not? 
¿cuál is? 

414
00:46:15,197 --> 00:46:17,401
Because I transferirte ... 
- I'm in the car. 

415
00:46:17,669 --> 00:46:21,506
What was your experience there? 
Now clean the courtyard. 

416
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:25,618
Call the doctor. 
I'll do the report. 

417
00:46:29,197 --> 00:46:34,803
Well done, you have to limpiarte head. 

418
00:46:39,353 --> 00:46:41,488
Why he was shot with a rifle? 

419
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:45,598
The question is why do not you fired 
to you that you were kicking the rear. 

420
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:50,772
¿Alguien said something? 
Ten-something very clear in your head. 

421
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:56,569
When you leave the room trial and 
laws are there, 

422
00:46:56,971 --> 00:47:00,209
the rules of the game are here 
they do whatever they want. 

423
00:47:00,406 --> 00:47:02,762
This place is very fucked. 

424
00:47:03,075 --> 00:47:05,578
The prison will disintegrate. 

425
00:47:06,566 --> 00:47:09,373
The first time you see as you cut 
face a man vomiting. 

426
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,329
The second worry. 

427
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:15,681
Then you go and no longer matter. 

428
00:47:15,883 --> 00:47:18,783
There is no difference for 
them, pull the triggers, 

429
00:47:19,042 --> 00:47:23,975
not make mistakes, 
we are all prisoners. 

430
00:47:27,483 --> 00:47:29,640
Time in prison: 
231days.

431
00:47:33,002 --> 00:47:36,388
There is a lot of activity here. 

432
00:47:36,594 --> 00:47:40,229
Not in vain to end what drew the army. 

433
00:47:40,788 --> 00:47:43,256
We are working together. 

434
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:46,498
Believe me. I got everything 
under control. 

435
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,346
I know that is true. 

436
00:47:51,612 --> 00:47:54,224
Thank you very much. 

437
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:07,767
Hello papito. 

438
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:15,152
Well done. 
What noqueaste. 

439
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:24,846
Hello boys. 
- What was that? 

440
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:30,068
You can not survive here by yourself. 
You can not. 

441
00:48:30,296 --> 00:48:34,760
¿Ahora you're a Nazi skinhead? 
- I do not expect it understand. 

442
00:48:41,104 --> 00:48:44,277
How are we going to the accounts? 
- Good ... 

443
00:48:44,606 --> 00:48:46,655
the loan business 
was completed. 

444
00:48:46,866 --> 00:48:50,135
I am late with the payment of the house y. .. 

445
00:48:50,774 --> 00:48:54,144
we do not have to cover 
all that. 

446
00:48:55,236 --> 00:48:58,152
If I tell you the truth I do not know what to do. 
- Okay. 

447
00:48:58,382 --> 00:49:01,451
Sell the house, sold my truck, 
everything you can. 

448
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,741
We are talking about our house. 
- I know. 

449
00:49:04,932 --> 00:49:08,520
You and Michael are the most important thing now 
venda the house, buy another later. 

450
00:49:09,878 --> 00:49:17,952
Laura mírame, as you leave here 
All this is history, I promise you. 

451
00:49:19,177 --> 00:49:25,380
¿Entonces protect you? 
¿a exchange for what? 

452
00:49:25,872 --> 00:49:29,898
Let me worry about me 
why. ¿O.K? 

453
00:49:31,709 --> 00:49:33,566
Dale drive. 

454
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:39,016
Just the chest. 

455
00:49:42,339 --> 00:49:45,916
Good shot. 
- Well done boy. 

456
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:08,424
Come on, strip. 

457
00:50:14,098 --> 00:50:16,588

458
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:24,576
¿Ves that tomato there?

¿Ahora you think hard is that? Te 
I will put the ass against that. 

460
00:50:32,685 --> 00:50:34,718
What if I want. 

461
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,482
We are going to beat this son of a whore. 

462
00:50:42,485 --> 00:50:43,016
Hey. 

463
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:45,613
They are hitting one. 

464
00:50:47,576 --> 00:50:48,668
I do not want to see this again. 

465
00:50:57,509 --> 00:50:58,789
Below or I lose. 

466
00:50:59,543 --> 00:51:00,408

467
00:51:07,745 --> 00:51:09,401
¿Quieres you sink your damn head? 

468
00:51:20,538 --> 00:51:22,872
Back to his cell, put 
their hands behind their heads. 

469
00:51:23,324 --> 00:51:24,152
If you move you shoot. 

470
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:25,884
Open 13. 

471
00:51:28,295 --> 00:51:28,897
Come on. 

472
00:51:31,419 --> 00:51:32,059
Close the 13. 

473
00:51:38,572 --> 00:51:39,476
You can stop. 

474
00:51:41,284 --> 00:51:42,075

475
00:51:43,054 --> 00:51:44,371

We are both. Should 
I scrounge around the rear. 

478
00:51:57,249 --> 00:51:58,492
It is hard. 

479
00:52:06,441 --> 00:52:07,269
Thanks, John. 

480
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,573
¿Sabes how to survive? 

481
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:17,774
You have to have a good friend. 

482
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,369
¿Ya arranger everything with the house? 

483
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:30,099
Yes, yes, I'm just reviewing.

00:52:32,396 --> 00:52:33,824
¿Estás you're safe

485
00:52:35,558 --> 00:52:37,589
As soon as you can fix it

486
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:39,962

00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,371
You and Michael can be

488
00:52:55,056 --> 00:52:55,620
Lieutenant.

Yes, I was eating too much 
pizza and fast food.

00:53:01,794 --> 00:53:03,185
My wife and I 
Divorced recently. 

492
00:53:04,767 --> 00:53:05,331

Sorry, she is my wife Kelly.

00:53:08,382 --> 00:53:09,622
And he is Lieutenant Jackson. 

495
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:11,693
Bill, call me Bill. 

496
00:53:12,146 --> 00:53:12,974
Nice to meet you, Bill. 

497
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:14,666
Pleased to meet you. 

498
00:53:14,968 --> 00:53:16,022
Oh, congratulations. 

499
00:53:16,743 --> 00:53:17,683
¿Ya know whether it was male or female? 

500
00:53:17,872 --> 00:53:18,366
It is female. 

501
00:53:18,747 --> 00:53:22,283
Oh, I remember those days, but grow 
so fast, you will know what I mean. 

502
00:53:23,413 --> 00:53:25,671
Oh, it is already ready 
all for what lies ahead. 

503
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,645
No, not everything. We 
to buy a house. 

504
00:53:29,096 --> 00:53:30,191
We need fourth extra now. 

505
00:53:30,382 --> 00:53:31,964
Please tell me what you 
I can do to help. 

506
00:53:32,189 --> 00:53:35,765
And do not be afraid to tell people 
from here you're part of the family ... 

507
00:53:36,706 --> 00:53:40,355
... one of the employees of the 
imprisonment. We take care of everything. 

508
00:53:40,845 --> 00:53:41,786
Okay, I'll do, thank you. 

509
00:53:42,577 --> 00:53:43,256
See you, James. 

510
00:53:43,673 --> 00:53:44,425
See you, Lieutenant. 

511
00:53:46,945 --> 00:53:48,150
It seems a very friendly. 

512
00:53:56,015 --> 00:53:56,542
Back. 

513
00:53:59,402 --> 00:53:59,968
Virata. 

514
00:54:00,538 --> 00:54:01,178
Two steps back. 

515
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:02,459
Close the 13. 

516
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,239
¿Sabes you what will happen today? 

517
00:54:08,556 --> 00:54:09,271
What's important to you? 

518
00:54:10,138 --> 00:54:11,342
I'll give you something else to shoot. 

519
00:54:12,433 --> 00:54:13,225
Okay, you know. 

520
00:54:25,783 --> 00:54:26,761
Time rules. 

521
00:54:34,097 --> 00:54:35,043
That is my bitch, Do not? 

522
00:54:36,248 --> 00:54:36,963
Cursed lamb. 

523
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,414
Doing so after 
everything they did because of you. 

524
00:54:39,753 --> 00:54:40,356
¿Nosotros? 

525
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:44,157
Surely you do not. 

526
00:54:45,023 --> 00:54:46,454
As far as I am 
Concerning you are fucked. 

527
00:54:53,343 --> 00:54:55,713
I feel you've tried it dammit. 

528
00:55:12,336 --> 00:55:13,578
Weapon in the toilet, Sergeant, I saw him. 

529
00:55:17,156 --> 00:55:18,098
Nobody is going to touching. 

530
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:22,351
If you want to ride with 
we look to see me. 

531
00:55:22,654 --> 00:55:24,802
If you do not, you're on your own. 

532
00:55:30,976 --> 00:55:32,670
I can not believe that 
is gaining more friends. 

533
00:55:33,273 --> 00:55:34,743
Métanlo in the hole. 

534
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,867
Wait, what's Samson? 

535
00:55:40,396 --> 00:55:40,999
What there with him? 

536
00:55:42,731 --> 00:55:45,102
When you do something, I will give you with a stick. 

537
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:50,523
why such hate so much? 

538
00:55:51,804 --> 00:55:54,741
Samson the Jodo him 5years ago. 

539
00:55:55,457 --> 00:55:57,226
He gave a cartabón in the face. 

540
00:55:58,959 --> 00:56:02,386
He told you to JOD 
cursed his wife and children. 

541
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,214
We all have a Samson here. 

542
00:56:05,932 --> 00:56:08,795
If you stay in this work as 
enough, so you'll need. 

543
00:56:15,307 --> 00:56:16,212
What kind of work. 

544
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,601
There is nothing better to think here. 

545
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:23,290
Do not tamper with dangerous types, 

546
00:56:23,893 --> 00:56:29,725
And when you are convinced that 
quite right, Patience, Pender. 

547
00:56:30,703 --> 00:56:31,945
What these represent? 

548
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,239
It's my timetable. 

549
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,801
That is its cumpleaños, 
this was their first date. 

550
00:56:37,668 --> 00:56:38,685
Our anniversary, 

551
00:56:39,815 --> 00:56:41,020
The cumpleaños my daughter. 

552
00:56:41,847 --> 00:56:43,051
The first day he walked. 

553
00:56:44,407 --> 00:56:46,440
And the day I took off. 

554
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,467
And that vacuum, what is? 

555
00:56:51,485 --> 00:56:52,388
This is 

556
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,834
the day we meet. 

557
00:56:59,275 --> 00:57:00,404
You say you have a girl. 

558
00:57:02,249 --> 00:57:04,771
Yes, but I do not have much to say. 

559
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,556
No, 

560
00:57:08,496 --> 00:57:09,100
dijiste 

561
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:11,700
who were 6years together 

562
00:57:12,709 --> 00:57:14,290
and not yet married. 

563
00:57:16,775 --> 00:57:17,340
I just ... 

564
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,260
... I want to be well first. 

565
00:57:21,215 --> 00:57:22,123
Let me give you ... 

566
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:23,328
... stability. 

567
00:57:23,818 --> 00:57:25,323
Something to pass this. 

568
00:57:27,317 --> 00:57:29,087
Now you're good fucking, Do not? 

569
00:57:30,592 --> 00:57:32,173
Yes, it ... 

570
00:57:36,649 --> 00:57:37,403
Hey, John. 

571
00:57:38,985 --> 00:57:40,377
¿Crees that Samson kept his word? 

572
00:57:41,318 --> 00:57:43,464
Oh, you just do not want a 
reason not to do so. 

573
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,114
You and I are now 
in a sea of sharks. 

574
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:50,125
I only know you're on your own. 

575
00:57:52,947 --> 00:57:54,791
Come on, Mike. End your work, come on. 

576
00:57:58,142 --> 00:57:58,668
Come on. 

577
00:58:00,174 --> 00:58:00,701
Yes. 

578
00:58:02,243 --> 00:58:03,561
Watch that you're well, arbitrator. 

579
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:04,541
Come on. 

580
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:05,783
God, is impressive. 

581
00:58:07,698 --> 00:58:09,392
Come on, big. 

582
00:58:11,842 --> 00:58:14,664
I was thinking that perhaps 
we should cool it a bit. 

583
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,488
Why? 

584
00:58:18,278 --> 00:58:18,843
You know, 

585
00:58:19,408 --> 00:58:22,493
these rates are going to 
fuck with lawyers. 

586
00:58:22,869 --> 00:58:27,312
Treaty with gentle hand does not work, 
all people, you should know. 

587
00:58:27,501 --> 00:58:30,916
I know, is that those bastards are going to 
Making talk about that among all of them, 

588
00:58:31,067 --> 00:58:32,272
we took the only person who ... 

589
00:58:32,427 --> 00:58:34,458
They are not going to be more convincing 
we with the police, 

590
00:58:34,648 --> 00:58:36,007
they will not check anything. 

591
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,286
Nothing. 

592
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:38,981
¿De what is this? 

593
00:58:41,654 --> 00:58:44,100
It's just that I do not want to lose everything 
the work I've done, Bill ... 

594
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:48,808
... I'm too close to my pension 
and I do not want to lose by an imbecile .... 

595
00:58:49,976 --> 00:58:50,767
Hear a moment, 

596
00:58:51,074 --> 00:58:53,331
¿cuánto money did last year? 

597
00:58:53,747 --> 00:58:54,500
¿Cuánto hiciste? 

598
00:58:54,689 --> 00:58:56,006
68thousand. 

599
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,117
-- We have a good salary 
-- Yes, yes. 

600
00:58:58,268 --> 00:58:59,059
Come on. 

601
00:58:59,436 --> 00:59:02,296
¿Sabes? there is a reason that 
the state has prisons. 

602
00:59:02,523 --> 00:59:05,959
Because all they care a carajo 
the lives of those pieces of shit. 

603
00:59:06,372 --> 00:59:07,502
The outside of society they want. 

604
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:09,988
Nobody's going to Jodo anything. 

605
00:59:10,252 --> 00:59:11,532
Nobody, ¿está well? 

606
00:59:13,678 --> 00:59:14,656
-- Continue to do so. 
-- Agreed. 

607
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,713
Trust me, ¿de agreement? 

608
00:59:17,071 --> 00:59:17,748
Come on, Tom. 

609
00:59:19,969 --> 00:59:21,437
Dale hard, we partner. 

610
00:59:22,265 --> 00:59:23,020
Do impressive. 

611
00:59:37,737 --> 00:59:40,034
Venda 

612
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:51,360
Stay at home. 

613
00:59:52,717 --> 00:59:53,394
I said to you. 

614
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:00,053
¿Una nightmare? 

615
01:00:00,921 --> 01:00:02,802
Yes, I was thinking about 
people who kill. 

616
01:00:03,631 --> 01:00:04,271
¿Y then? 

617
01:00:05,287 --> 01:00:07,169
I can not remove the face 
This kind of my head. 

618
01:00:11,387 --> 01:00:13,042
He stays inside, I quit going. 

619
01:00:13,269 --> 01:00:13,909
Not ... 

620
01:00:15,076 --> 01:00:16,243
... you did what you had to do. 

621
01:00:16,471 --> 01:00:18,428
Protect your family, that 
The only thing that matters. 

622
01:00:25,466 --> 01:00:26,407
¿Te I ask something? 

623
01:00:31,977 --> 01:00:33,518
Why not kill those two guys? 

624
01:00:34,986 --> 01:00:35,589
why the others? 

625
01:00:42,497 --> 01:00:43,028
Sorry. 

626
01:00:45,136 --> 01:00:45,814
No. 

627
01:00:49,202 --> 01:00:50,631
... You do not have to tell me. 

628
01:00:52,138 --> 01:00:57,030
If you are going to be next to a 
rate, breathing the same air, 

629
01:00:57,934 --> 01:00:59,590
need to know things about him. 

630
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:05,726
And when your life is ... 

631
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,490
defined forever ... 
by a single action, 

632
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:11,748
changes over time. 

633
01:01:13,817 --> 01:01:17,721
It feels like 1000years in 
my body, but in my mind ... 

634
01:01:19,149 --> 01:01:20,730
... it seems that happened yesterday. 

635
01:01:23,065 --> 01:01:24,610
You know the feeling when ... 

636
01:01:25,777 --> 01:01:27,621
... get home and 
you see your wife and son. 

637
01:01:29,691 --> 01:01:30,180
Yes. 

638
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:35,862
Try to imagine the other party. 

639
01:01:37,331 --> 01:01:38,498
When I arrived home y. .. 

640
01:01:39,853 --> 01:01:41,509
... I saw the bleeding ... 

641
01:01:42,751 --> 01:01:43,767
... exposed. 

642
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,421
Covers blood. 

643
01:01:49,002 --> 01:01:53,555
My little Mary had the 
broken legs and was on the floor. 

644
01:01:54,534 --> 01:01:56,303
He dislocated his hip. 

645
01:01:57,356 --> 01:01:58,373
He was 7years. 

646
01:02:00,971 --> 01:02:04,397
I wanted these two imbeciles ... 

647
01:02:06,279 --> 01:02:08,387
... feel the experience I had. 

648
01:02:09,064 --> 01:02:12,186
I wanted them to know 
how I had felt. 

649
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:17,796
Kill every member of their families. 

650
01:02:18,664 --> 01:02:20,659
One by one, limpide. 

651
01:02:21,301 --> 01:02:22,582
I became crazy. 

652
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:24,543
And I purifies. 

653
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:26,841
Before killing them, 

654
01:02:27,518 --> 01:02:28,535
I knew the loss. 

655
01:02:33,243 --> 01:02:35,351
He wanted me to death 
return, but it did not. 

656
01:02:37,684 --> 01:02:39,719
I wanted to be with my and my Mary Anne. 

657
01:02:44,315 --> 01:02:46,461
These sons of whores did not have the right 

658
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:48,947
of Jodo 

659
01:02:51,621 --> 01:02:56,364
They say the law that 
I see full of blood. 

660
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:14,284
Hello. 

661
01:03:15,716 --> 01:03:16,658
What happens? 

662
01:03:17,185 --> 01:03:17,749
¿Estás well? 

663
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:19,143
Yes, I'm just tired. 

664
01:03:20,688 --> 01:03:21,404
¿Estás safe? 

665
01:03:22,347 --> 01:03:22,949
Yes. 

666
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,527
I can not believe that 
have already spent 11months. 

667
01:03:28,824 --> 01:03:30,556
Anything that I thought 
is a new life. 

668
01:03:32,513 --> 01:03:33,454
How is Mike? 

669
01:03:34,998 --> 01:03:39,250
Yes, that's okay but with nightmares 
since the last visit, so ... 

670
01:03:40,157 --> 01:03:41,398
I thought it was better ... 
to stay at home. 

671
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:43,809
Yes, you're right. 

672
01:03:44,261 --> 01:03:46,104
Probably should not 
see this place anymore. 

673
01:03:48,814 --> 01:03:49,379
Yes. 

674
01:03:53,368 --> 01:03:54,496
Venda home. 

675
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:56,530
Agreed. 

676
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,714
In 24or 25thousand, Do not? 

677
01:04:00,521 --> 01:04:03,230
No, we sold in 3800. 

678
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:04,135
What? 

679
01:04:04,624 --> 01:04:05,940
3800a shit, Laura. 

680
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:10,008
With everything on the house, the 
'd asked least 10thousand U.S. dollars. 

681
01:04:10,572 --> 01:04:11,475
How will you survive with that? 

682
01:04:11,629 --> 01:04:13,963
If you think I have not thought of that, if 
not what you think should have done, 

683
01:04:14,113 --> 01:04:15,244
maybe what you should have done. 

684
01:04:15,546 --> 01:04:17,766
Hey, I'm which stands 
over time, ¿te remember? 

685
01:04:17,883 --> 01:04:19,163
¿Crees I'm not so well? 

686
01:04:19,803 --> 01:04:22,099
You're on your cage with many types. 

687
01:04:22,251 --> 01:04:23,757
I have had to cope with the disaster 

688
01:04:23,909 --> 01:04:24,812
to continue with life. 

689
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:26,921
Your tools are gone. 

690
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:28,502
Your truck, he left. 

691
01:04:28,842 --> 01:04:30,573
The whole house was. 

692
01:04:30,763 --> 01:04:32,721
Meanwhile am 
Work sucks ... 

693
01:04:32,947 --> 01:04:34,265
... and rarely see Michael, 

694
01:04:34,455 --> 01:04:37,992
I have to deal with my mother and listen 
say all shits all day. 

695
01:04:38,144 --> 01:04:40,364
All we know 
We are rejecting. 

696
01:04:40,821 --> 01:04:42,481
OK, calm down. 

697
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:43,536
¿De agreement? 

698
01:04:44,591 --> 01:04:46,662
Sorry, I know you're 
dealing with many things. 

699
01:04:47,266 --> 01:04:49,449
But have no idea 
what happens here. 

700
01:04:50,238 --> 01:04:51,632
What I have to do to survive. 

701
01:04:52,234 --> 01:04:53,476
No, Dímelo. 

702
01:04:53,966 --> 01:04:54,944
Because I do not know. 

703
01:04:58,053 --> 01:04:58,844
I can not. 

704
01:04:59,183 --> 01:05:00,650
Jódete, Wade. 

705
01:05:01,893 --> 01:05:02,835
Do not you, Laura, please. 

706
01:05:03,437 --> 01:05:04,529
please sit again. 

707
01:05:05,094 --> 01:05:05,695
Please. 

708
01:05:18,652 --> 01:05:20,008
¿Ves someone Jodo here? 

709
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,695
Your team, how outdoors. 

710
01:05:24,525 --> 01:05:25,164
And in the morning, 

711
01:05:25,807 --> 01:05:28,555
you break, you destroy. 

712
01:05:29,382 --> 01:05:31,715
Rather than exercise, go to work. 

713
01:05:32,619 --> 01:05:35,216
Everything you do, 
to the last detail 

714
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:37,551
This is the only prisoner. 

715
01:05:41,616 --> 01:05:42,556
¿Viste your girl? 

716
01:05:45,343 --> 01:05:46,472
I saw his face, but. 

717
01:05:47,488 --> 01:05:49,409
I could not do anything to be better. 

718
01:05:50,952 --> 01:05:52,387
You're in a mess with many types. 

719
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,662
It seems everything has remained unchanged. 

720
01:05:57,054 --> 01:05:57,846
More moves, 

721
01:06:01,648 --> 01:06:02,514
She is everything to me. 

722
01:06:03,534 --> 01:06:04,701
If you do not have it or Michael ... 

723
01:06:09,253 --> 01:06:10,348
I'm so bored of this shit. 

724
01:06:12,194 --> 01:06:13,549
Here we go, going to see a bronze. 

725
01:06:16,521 --> 01:06:17,350
I will not fight with you, man. 

726
01:06:24,454 --> 01:06:25,244
What the hell you doing? 

727
01:06:33,124 --> 01:06:34,518
¿Me called for this? 

728
01:06:34,706 --> 01:06:35,385
Clear the courtroom. 

729
01:06:35,912 --> 01:06:36,632
Vamonos here. 

730
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:39,342
¿Quieres fuck with me? 

731
01:06:50,912 --> 01:06:51,702
Get in the infirmary. 

732
01:06:58,821 --> 01:07:01,871
I want to be in peace 
rest of my time here. 

733
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:03,150
I do not want a death. 

734
01:07:05,033 --> 01:07:05,861
Dímelo everything. 

735
01:07:07,969 --> 01:07:08,836
Everything. 

736
01:07:10,455 --> 01:07:11,583
And you will be protected at night. 

737
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:15,499
Talk. 

738
01:07:34,651 --> 01:07:35,629
Neither keep thinking. 

739
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:38,867
19years I have grappled with you. 

740
01:07:39,846 --> 01:07:40,974
Under pressure, tested. 

741
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:45,341
Never has anyone done anything to me 
I know personally. 

742
01:07:45,906 --> 01:07:49,217
My image is destroying every time 
we talk about why you got. 

743
01:07:51,628 --> 01:07:53,773
And people like to buy 
the prison guards 

744
01:07:53,962 --> 01:07:56,671
This always happens, 55years ago. 

745
01:07:58,403 --> 01:07:59,457
But that will not be me. 

746
01:08:00,699 --> 01:08:02,128
I do not let pressure. 

747
01:08:06,645 --> 01:08:07,588
I inflicts. 

748
01:08:08,492 --> 01:08:08,982
Jesus Christ. 

749
01:08:09,435 --> 01:08:10,563
Please, please. 

750
01:08:10,751 --> 01:08:12,295
-- We will implore. 
-- Dime. 

751
01:08:13,614 --> 01:08:16,624
-- Please lieutenant. 
-- If you do not let this lie ... 

752
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,711
... you will pay cagándote. 

753
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,308
I think I put more 
fear in you, son of a whore. 

754
01:08:22,572 --> 01:08:23,703
-- Sorry. 
-- You are empty. 

755
01:08:23,895 --> 01:08:24,611
Sorry. 

756
01:08:25,816 --> 01:08:26,794
please do not. 

757
01:08:29,543 --> 01:08:30,410
¿Sabes what? 

758
01:08:31,126 --> 01:08:32,257
I think I have a better way. 

759
01:08:34,668 --> 01:08:36,549
¿Sabes what happened to 
Samson friend of the Bus? 

760
01:08:37,077 --> 01:08:37,604
Yes 

761
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:38,588
Died 

762
01:08:39,456 --> 01:08:40,584
Now I import a shit. 

763
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:42,469
But whether it should be important to you. 

764
01:08:42,659 --> 01:08:44,279
She went to see the people 
indicated that works for me, 

765
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:48,647
and a witness who did know that Samson 
the conviction for murder in 1st grade. 

766
01:08:49,097 --> 01:08:50,943
Contigo I make an exception. 

767
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:52,338
Okay, look, I'm sorry. 

768
01:08:52,527 --> 01:08:53,510
I should haberte told the truth. 

769
01:08:53,848 --> 01:08:57,087
I thought it was going to kill me, never 
I have been in prison, ¿de agreement? 

770
01:08:57,276 --> 01:08:58,594
That is already sold, Porter. 

771
01:08:59,195 --> 01:09:01,568
Except you and I are going to 
spend much more time together. 

772
01:09:02,735 --> 01:09:04,430
Listen, Lieutenant only 
I have left 4months. 

773
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,614
I will do what he wants. 

774
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:07,595
Please. 

775
01:09:10,192 --> 01:09:12,262
Time served: 427days. 

776
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,280
Lord Samson, 

777
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:17,265
when the jury sentenced him by the 
charge of first degree murder, 

778
01:09:17,455 --> 01:09:20,354
what gets life 
with the possibility of change. 

779
01:09:20,693 --> 01:09:23,290
This term is not consistent 
with his initial judgement. 

780
01:09:24,909 --> 01:09:25,588
Lord Porter, 

781
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:29,127
when the jury what 
sentenced for murder 

782
01:09:30,671 --> 01:09:33,079
the maximum sentenced to 3years. 

783
01:09:33,796 --> 01:09:36,768
And because the testimony 
Lieutenant Jackson was so bad 

784
01:09:37,219 --> 01:09:40,681
I will give you another 3years to 
reconsider its allegations. 

785
01:09:41,322 --> 01:09:44,256
These are 6consecutive years 
his initial judgement. 

786
01:09:45,917 --> 01:09:47,422
I hope that his life back on track. 

787
01:10:09,494 --> 01:10:10,098
What I heard. 

788
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,094
Sorry. 

789
01:10:16,385 --> 01:10:18,305
What coño did to deserve this? 

790
01:10:22,707 --> 01:10:24,401
No, what I must 
face, we must ... 

791
01:10:24,592 --> 01:10:27,567
Look at what has become Wade. 

792
01:10:28,019 --> 01:10:31,181
It happens just happens. Some 
people become ... 

793
01:10:31,445 --> 01:10:34,306
What mom want me to do? 
Just want to flee, Do not? 

794
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,555
Just want to leave it. 

795
01:10:35,705 --> 01:10:39,696
Sorry, but he has left you 
you, I'm trying to understand. 

796
01:10:39,847 --> 01:10:43,088
You have 33years, a single mother. 

797
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:47,666
If you expect Athens 40before he 
leaves, and if you do something else, ¿entonces what? 

798
01:10:47,819 --> 01:10:49,438
've Waited in vain. 

799
01:10:53,693 --> 01:10:56,027
He was 26when your father is long. 

800
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:59,301
We left you and me with a ticket 
for a swimming pool. ¿Recuerdas? 

801
01:11:00,169 --> 01:11:02,013
I do not regret a moment or that. 

802
01:11:02,879 --> 01:11:04,876
Working all these 
years to support us. 

803
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:08,078
Look at me well, Laura. 

804
01:11:08,793 --> 01:11:11,730
I have 50years and still single. 

805
01:11:13,499 --> 01:11:15,007
Do not want to see in this way. 

806
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:29,462
You know. 

807
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:32,173
She left me. 

808
01:11:34,846 --> 01:11:35,939
She left me. 

809
01:12:52,972 --> 01:12:53,725
¿Lo to carry hollow? 

810
01:12:54,515 --> 01:12:55,154
Why? 

811
01:13:03,884 --> 01:13:04,976
You have to let go. 

812
01:13:06,068 --> 01:13:06,895
Piece of shit. 

813
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:09,605
I have nothing to Alo 
return, I have nothing. 

814
01:13:09,907 --> 01:13:12,090
Everyone must know what it feels like. 

815
01:13:28,161 --> 01:13:29,292
How you doing here, John? 

816
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:35,806
¿Comparado with your fishing boat or 
take your beautiful wife in your holidays? 

817
01:13:36,221 --> 01:13:38,032
In fact, I was in the boat this morning. 

818
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:43,286
¿Necesitas a couple of 
glasses? I can ... 

819
01:13:43,436 --> 01:13:47,581
No. Not me ... I have to go 
used to be that way. 

820
01:13:51,575 --> 01:13:53,758
I've seen letters on the website. 

821
01:13:58,014 --> 01:13:59,897
What I think you should ... 

822
01:14:01,177 --> 01:14:02,833
... you did long ago. 

823
01:14:04,829 --> 01:14:06,975
¿Crees which is the only reason 
by which I coming here? 

824
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:09,272
No, has been a good friend to me. 

825
01:14:09,685 --> 01:14:14,014
But both know that never want 
seeing the walls of prison 

826
01:14:14,203 --> 01:14:15,708
if it were not for me and it hurts. 

827
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:18,419
So ... 

828
01:14:18,726 --> 01:14:19,593
... please, just 

829
01:14:20,766 --> 01:14:22,047
enjoy your life y. .. 

830
01:14:22,538 --> 01:14:24,158
-- Watch ... 
-- Leave expenditure here. 

831
01:14:24,913 --> 01:14:25,552
John. 

832
01:14:27,472 --> 01:14:28,035
Guard. 

833
01:14:51,091 --> 01:14:51,695
Oye, oye. 

834
01:14:52,072 --> 01:14:54,744
We are now carrying surgery 
same. We can not let pass. 

835
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:57,309
, Everything is Dad. 

836
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,779
It hurts. 

837
01:14:59,268 --> 01:15:00,735
I know, champion. 

838
01:15:01,902 --> 01:15:02,768
You have to be tough, ¿de agreement? 

839
01:15:03,935 --> 01:15:06,042
We are going to operate and you will come 
to collect, ¿de agreement? 

840
01:15:07,323 --> 01:15:08,490
I'll be right here, ¿de agreement friend? 

841
01:15:09,472 --> 01:15:11,729
I'll be here when 
leave. I promise. 

842
01:15:13,649 --> 01:15:14,740
Be tough, ¿de agreement, baby? 

843
01:15:23,733 --> 01:15:24,337
What happened? 

844
01:15:24,788 --> 01:15:29,115
I was in the garden and its 
friend ran 

845
01:15:29,307 --> 01:15:31,601
wine and a type that the 
crashed into the corner and 

846
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:34,200
beat him before he 
given time to do something. 

847
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:38,114
It is this son of a bitch that did this. 

848
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:39,884
How you know? 

849
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:40,827
For the policemen. 

850
01:15:41,584 --> 01:15:44,105
We are now withholding 
same in a room. 

851
01:16:00,105 --> 01:16:01,459
It looks like you're uncomfortable. 

852
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,041
Yes. 

853
01:16:04,433 --> 01:16:06,353
It's very bad what happened. 

854
01:16:07,181 --> 01:16:07,746
I am very ... 

855
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,536
... very embarrassed, How is he? 

856
01:16:10,725 --> 01:16:12,007
Do not talk shit. 

857
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:13,324
I did not want to hit. 

858
01:16:18,217 --> 01:16:19,045
It is best read 

859
01:16:20,665 --> 01:16:23,299
that the judge thinks the same thing as you. 

860
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,479
because there will be no jail or prison 

861
01:16:28,344 --> 01:16:30,679
where you can hide from me. 

862
01:16:31,997 --> 01:16:34,141
For you promise 
I will find you 

863
01:16:35,232 --> 01:16:40,163
I will make you do 
bleed to death. 

864
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:46,526
But for now I have your license 
lead, I took the report of the incident ... 

865
01:16:47,089 --> 01:16:50,060
perhaps you can hit again, wimp. 

866
01:16:50,251 --> 01:16:53,073
Perhaps passing through your property and 
cursed shock to your children. 

867
01:16:58,795 --> 01:17:01,166
There'll fuck with 
the son of a guard. 

868
01:17:16,446 --> 01:17:20,887
coño why it had to happen? 

869
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:43,583
why? Hello, black, stay 
in the cage, son of a whore. 

870
01:17:48,024 --> 01:17:48,966
What's going on, my black? 

871
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:50,028
Jódete, red. 

872
01:17:54,016 --> 01:17:54,883
A bastard. 

873
01:17:55,597 --> 01:18:00,340
I'm going to fuck the ass, 
see you, son of a whore. 

874
01:18:09,627 --> 01:18:11,358
Already Di keys 
apartment, Do not?

875
01:18:12,676 --> 01:18:14,821
Yes, just do not know where most 
we will save more.

876
01:18:14,973 --> 01:18:16,554
It is cheap, is what matters. 

877
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:18,737
And this helps comic side of here. 

878
01:18:19,457 --> 01:18:21,150
Just stay here. 

879
01:18:22,733 --> 01:18:23,522
Thanks, cariño. 

880
01:18:25,254 --> 01:18:26,459
Thank you. 

881
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:31,277
why are you giving 
Papi clothes there? 

882
01:18:41,063 --> 01:18:41,591
Good, 

883
01:18:42,043 --> 01:18:42,534
baby, 

884
01:18:44,490 --> 01:18:45,960
Papi is not going to live 
with us anymore. 

885
01:18:46,714 --> 01:18:48,746
But tell that to return home. 

886
01:18:50,065 --> 01:18:51,384
I know, I did. 

887
01:18:52,324 --> 01:18:53,267
But things changed. 

888
01:18:53,718 --> 01:18:55,337
-- Cariño, is just ... 
-- Sometimes ... 

889
01:18:58,389 --> 01:19:02,416
... sometimes, Mike, 
people change their lives. 

890
01:19:03,287 --> 01:19:04,566
And all we can 
do is say goodbye. 

891
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,939
¿Está Bravo with us? 

892
01:19:07,093 --> 01:19:07,736
No, 

893
01:19:07,931 --> 01:19:11,131
No, daddy wants us much. 

894
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:13,428
¿Sabes what? We are going to be okay. 

895
01:19:14,633 --> 01:19:15,198
¿Está well? 

896
01:19:15,574 --> 01:19:16,818
We can talk about this 
then why ...? 

897
01:19:17,194 --> 01:19:20,835
Why not looking for your coloring book 
and you draw a picture to your grandmother? 

898
01:19:21,324 --> 01:19:22,002
¿Está well? 

899
01:19:25,804 --> 01:19:26,370
Mike. 

900
01:19:27,725 --> 01:19:28,291
¿Donde are you? 

901
01:19:46,756 --> 01:19:47,320
Porter. 

902
01:19:54,621 --> 01:19:55,299
You visit. 

903
01:20:15,504 --> 01:20:16,751
Take your time. 

904
01:20:18,293 --> 01:20:18,933
Thank you. 

905
01:20:26,448 --> 01:20:27,953
¿Anda everything OK? ¿Mike okay? 

906
01:20:28,669 --> 01:20:30,024
Yes, no, no, that's okay. 

907
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:33,562
I thought that you would not again. 

908
01:20:36,275 --> 01:20:37,520
I do not. 

909
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:42,189
I do not know what to do. 

910
01:20:43,811 --> 01:20:46,822
But the problem is that Mike will be 
in the secondary when to leave. 

911
01:20:51,151 --> 01:20:54,166
But I know he does not want 
spend the rest of his life without you. 

912
01:20:57,592 --> 01:20:59,172
And I either. 

913
01:21:02,863 --> 01:21:03,692
Not'm going to lie. 

914
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,153
Your letter to me killed. 

915
01:21:11,935 --> 01:21:13,591
If you do not know that I have to you 
and Michael when I get back ... 

916
01:21:14,494 --> 01:21:15,553
... not what I will achieve. 

917
01:21:18,977 --> 01:21:23,456
It's just that he needed time to 
understand everything that was losing. 

918
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:26,392
So Dime 

919
01:21:28,687 --> 01:21:29,591
¿Espero for you? 

920
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:31,136
That's what I want. 

921
01:21:33,245 --> 01:21:34,638
But if you can not understand. 

922
01:21:35,653 --> 01:21:36,406
Well, I will. 

923
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:40,136
No matter how much I cost. 

924
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:44,919
Only when I need to leave home 

925
01:21:46,162 --> 01:21:47,367
're you. 

926
01:21:56,475 --> 01:21:58,508
Love is the force more 
powerful on Earth. 

927
01:21:59,937 --> 01:22:00,578
It was Laura. 

928
01:22:06,862 --> 01:22:07,766
Look, John. 

929
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:11,908
I know that never wanted 
getting into trouble. 

930
01:22:12,172 --> 01:22:13,828
I do not need any disrespect. 

931
01:22:14,845 --> 01:22:17,969
But this kind I have been robbed 7
years of my life with my family. 

932
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:20,151
I can not let this happen. 

933
01:22:21,131 --> 01:22:25,420
The last time checkup, he 
does this because it gives the wins. 

934
01:22:26,663 --> 01:22:29,184
Unless you have 
something with which to negotiate. 

935
01:22:30,276 --> 01:22:31,030
What you mean? 

936
01:22:31,258 --> 01:22:32,088
What I mean? 

937
01:22:35,477 --> 01:22:36,833
Expose to operate. 

938
01:22:38,526 --> 01:22:40,822
True, but nobody is going 
to risk against Jackson. 

939
01:22:41,801 --> 01:22:42,518
Not even Collins. 

940
01:22:43,345 --> 01:22:45,038
You can not think outside these walls. 

941
01:22:45,837 --> 01:22:47,568
Look at the people who 
really is involved. 

942
01:22:47,871 --> 01:22:49,076
Fuérzalos to pay attention. 

943
01:22:49,716 --> 01:22:50,283
How? 

944
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:52,655
Please, 

945
01:22:53,186 --> 01:22:53,976
just tell me how. 

946
01:23:02,324 --> 01:23:03,264
How is your son? 

947
01:23:09,062 --> 01:23:09,816
Sorry. 

948
01:23:11,963 --> 01:23:13,468
Porter has been asking for you. 

949
01:23:27,433 --> 01:23:29,018
I do not know what they want. 

950
01:23:29,957 --> 01:23:31,728
I'm ready to give you what you want. 

951
01:23:33,105 --> 01:23:33,856
¿Dime again? 

952
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:36,078
The nuts of the cell 19

953
01:23:36,869 --> 01:23:38,827
this son of a whore is one of the 
why I am here. 

954
01:23:40,221 --> 01:23:41,238
Want to pay, Do not? 

955
01:23:41,878 --> 01:23:42,367
Yes. 

956
01:23:43,121 --> 01:23:44,928
Ponna in the yard, kill it. 

957
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:48,788
I'm so tired of you all. 

958
01:23:49,504 --> 01:23:50,294
You say one thing. 

959
01:23:51,273 --> 01:23:53,345
If you want to handle this 
as a soldier, you'll need. 

960
01:23:54,323 --> 01:23:55,980
But with my rules, you go for everything. 

961
01:23:57,148 --> 01:23:57,900
What you mean? 

962
01:23:58,089 --> 01:24:00,461
¿Quieres or not go to this yard? 

963
01:24:01,214 --> 01:24:03,284
I wish you the ride 
life of this son of a whore. 

964
01:24:03,736 --> 01:24:08,063
I will not finish my work until 
that ends with you one by one. 

965
01:24:08,778 --> 01:24:09,383
¿Me listening? 

966
01:24:14,951 --> 01:24:15,968
I did not expect that this will happen. 

967
01:24:21,651 --> 01:24:23,307
-- ¯Tienes address you di? 
-- Yes. 

968
01:24:23,682 --> 01:24:26,279
Just make sure you go 
when working. 

969
01:24:26,769 --> 01:24:28,312
Why risk? Te 
I expect that. 

970
01:24:28,502 --> 01:24:29,519
¿Otros 7years? 

971
01:24:30,613 --> 01:24:31,141
No, baby. 

972
01:24:31,368 --> 01:24:33,965
This type will not cease, 
not in this way. 

973
01:24:35,248 --> 01:24:38,296
If something happens, he will learn 
and you'll never leave here. 

974
01:24:38,788 --> 01:24:39,507
Back home. 

975
01:24:40,412 --> 01:24:42,218
Just make sure it does not do anything wrong. 

976
01:24:43,046 --> 01:24:43,987
We do not know whom to trust. 

977
01:24:45,755 --> 01:24:46,472
¿Puedo help? 

978
01:24:46,923 --> 01:24:47,676
¿Señor Cameros? 

979
01:24:48,094 --> 01:24:48,619
Yes. 

980
01:24:49,034 --> 01:24:51,295
Time served: 457days. 

981
01:25:20,475 --> 01:25:21,153
Open 13. 

982
01:25:25,146 --> 01:25:25,935
That same, right here for. 

983
01:25:37,714 --> 01:25:38,244
Come on. 

984
01:25:39,525 --> 01:25:40,352
Ponte backs. 

985
01:25:43,927 --> 01:25:44,943
What is what happens? Do not do. 

986
01:25:45,547 --> 01:25:47,429
Even if you win, 
lie to lose your life. 

987
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,349
Why you care? You are like them. 

988
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:50,667
I'm not like them. 

989
01:25:51,269 --> 01:25:52,136
Then do something. 

990
01:25:56,049 --> 01:25:57,741
Wade said that insurance ¿Estás 
that this will happen this morning? 

991
01:25:58,007 --> 01:25:59,965
He said that what iban a 
extricate the patio at 8:00. 

992
01:26:00,303 --> 01:26:02,863
If we can finally take, 
we will have circumstantial evidence. 

993
01:26:03,729 --> 01:26:06,295
We have to look at this yard with the fight. 

994
01:26:13,261 --> 01:26:15,405
Anything that happens, 
do not leave this place. 

995
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:16,648
We copy. 

996
01:26:25,302 --> 01:26:27,298
Life is defined by 
individual actions. 

997
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:30,120
Return the concept over time. 

998
01:26:39,733 --> 01:26:40,750
Come, son of a whore. 

999
01:26:57,887 --> 01:26:59,620
¿Crees that we must stop 
that happen in the yard? 

1000
01:26:59,808 --> 01:27:03,572
When you are finished with those by comemierdas 
myself, get ready to finish the fight. 

1001
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:17,413
Porter seems to be 
better than it looks. 

1002
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:37,881
Agreed. I think 
it's time to stop. 

1003
01:27:38,072 --> 01:27:38,748
No. 

1004
01:28:31,143 --> 01:28:31,708
Now. 

1005
01:28:33,251 --> 01:28:33,894
Forward. 

1006
01:28:49,013 --> 01:28:52,099
You do not fail or next. 

1007
01:28:53,379 --> 01:28:54,209
Come on, salt there. 

1008
01:29:08,404 --> 01:29:12,657
What is jodan, if they want blood between 
brothers, as dale, we will give you blood. 

1009
01:29:17,739 --> 01:29:18,605
Leave move, Bill. 

1010
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:22,069
None of them deserve this and what you know. 

1011
01:29:23,537 --> 01:29:24,140
Leave pass. 

1012
01:29:30,611 --> 01:29:31,401
Clear the yard. 

1013
01:29:44,507 --> 01:29:45,146
Move. 

1014
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:51,206
Cell 13, quit the courtyard. 

1015
01:30:09,773 --> 01:30:10,413
¿Crees that worked? 

1016
01:30:11,054 --> 01:30:12,634
Now that your absence 
girl reaches the Guard. 

1017
01:30:14,516 --> 01:30:15,951
I can not believe who do not want to stop. 

1018
01:30:16,215 --> 01:30:17,157
Quiet. 

1019
01:30:17,385 --> 01:30:21,523
You do not want you to hate them more than 
. For the police, especially Jackson. 

1020
01:30:22,618 --> 01:30:24,273
The two, returning to the yard now. 

1021
01:30:25,817 --> 01:30:27,170
Move their hind screwed. 

1022
01:30:37,944 --> 01:30:38,622
Everything will be fine, cariño. 

1023
01:30:57,626 --> 01:30:58,642
¿Me have, Diaz? 

1024
01:30:59,622 --> 01:31:02,108
If they move, jodo complete. 

1025
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:12,424
Oh, shit, Bill. 

1026
01:31:22,322 --> 01:31:23,528
I'm going to the infirmary. 

1027
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,255
I pass something in the knee. 

1028
01:31:29,026 --> 01:31:31,210
That is what I am going to bring. 

1029
01:31:36,555 --> 01:31:37,271
Open the door of the courtyard. 

1030
01:31:40,659 --> 01:31:41,675
Damn now. 

1031
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:59,875
¿Crees that someone 
matter if they do this ... 

1032
01:32:01,079 --> 01:32:03,826
Nobody cares a 
carajo what they happen. 

1033
01:32:05,032 --> 01:32:06,536
What happens is that I have the two 

1034
01:32:06,989 --> 01:32:08,533
Gaza front of the camera. 

1035
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:10,491
So if someone looks at my report 

1036
01:32:10,754 --> 01:32:13,353
will see that this old man here 
fired them to colleagues in the room 

1037
01:32:13,729 --> 01:32:16,966
and you break your head against 
floor, of course you had to draw 

1038
01:32:17,117 --> 01:32:18,284
with the team on duty. 

1039
01:32:18,661 --> 01:32:20,394
And the shit that's happening now is ... 

1040
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:24,383
That sent me to two bastards 
to me it can .... 

1041
01:32:26,076 --> 01:32:26,642
13. 

1042
01:32:30,819 --> 01:32:31,422
You, accursed. 

1043
01:32:42,408 --> 01:32:43,876
Okay. 

1044
01:32:49,031 --> 01:32:49,860
Listen, my friend ... 

1045
01:32:51,139 --> 01:32:51,967
¿Sí? 

1046
01:32:53,588 --> 01:32:55,131
You ... 

1047
01:32:59,688 --> 01:33:00,480
¿John? 

1048
01:33:01,195 --> 01:33:01,911
¿John? 

1049
01:33:09,855 --> 01:33:10,909
coño What we want to go? 

1050
01:33:11,814 --> 01:33:14,225
Guess one thing, Diaz, 
just hit the car. 

1051
01:33:25,138 --> 01:33:27,776
I heard the shots, reviews all 
sections. I'm going there for now. 

1052
01:33:30,749 --> 01:33:32,556
Cameros, ... What you doing here? 

1053
01:33:32,707 --> 01:33:34,402
I am the agent of Skiletti 
FBI, we must speak. 

1054
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:36,548
Sorry, I have an emergency 
in prison and I need ... 

1055
01:33:36,663 --> 01:33:39,637
This is a federal review, has 
to tell me what kind of emergency is. 

1056
01:33:41,066 --> 01:33:42,648
I am a lieutenant and died a prisoner. 

1057
01:33:43,213 --> 01:33:43,816
¿Cuáles are the names? 

1058
01:33:44,908 --> 01:33:45,774
Lt. Bill Jackson 

1059
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:48,145
and John Smith. 

1060
01:33:48,447 --> 01:33:52,210
I want to see the surveillance tape 
before anyone touch them. 

1061
01:33:52,405 --> 01:33:53,874
How knows that happened in the courtyard? 

1062
01:33:57,374 --> 01:33:57,863
Collins. 

1063
01:33:58,730 --> 01:33:59,408
There were with them. 

1064
01:34:00,198 --> 01:34:01,027
We all know it. 

1065
01:34:01,779 --> 01:34:02,421
¿Crees that matter? 

1066
01:34:06,753 --> 01:34:09,875
Nobody in the prison system 
will be able to play. 

1067
01:34:11,382 --> 01:34:12,211
Not with what I do. 

1068
01:34:30,101 --> 01:34:31,608
¿Y did not do anything about it? 

1069
01:34:31,873 --> 01:34:34,168
I was in the infirmary, 
just like my report said. 

1070
01:34:34,621 --> 01:34:39,365
Look, I do not know why the FBI has to 
involved before they finish my people. 

1071
01:34:39,516 --> 01:34:40,722
After what I see, 

1072
01:34:41,628 --> 01:34:42,309
we are involved. 

1073
01:34:42,912 --> 01:34:47,957
And let me make this clear, Wade Porter is now a witness 
Federal and want this in custody until the release. 

1074
01:34:48,635 --> 01:34:51,610
Cameros, How knew that this 
happen before the fact? 

1075
01:34:51,954 --> 01:34:53,949
Sorry, he does not have 
to answer that. 

1076
01:34:54,628 --> 01:34:55,606
It's part of our investigation. 

1077
01:34:56,925 --> 01:34:58,431
He knows that is what you jode, Frank. 

1078
01:35:00,819 --> 01:35:02,176
It's not what you know. 

1079
01:35:09,818 --> 01:35:11,437
Wade is being transferred to custody. 

1080
01:35:11,701 --> 01:35:16,151
Nothing will happen there, I will also put pressure 
for the benefit because of their testimony. 

1081
01:35:17,319 --> 01:35:18,523
What does that mean? 

1082
01:35:18,937 --> 01:35:21,083
It means as ends 
his original sentence. 

1083
01:35:21,686 --> 01:35:22,891
That will be within three months, Do not? 

1084
01:35:25,148 --> 01:35:26,353
Oh, God. 

1085
01:35:27,258 --> 01:35:28,011
Oh, God. 

1086
01:35:36,962 --> 01:35:37,905
That you stayed in the cell. 

1087
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:39,296
Thank you. 

1088
01:35:42,157 --> 01:35:44,791
Gordon Cameros, a friend of John. 

1089
01:35:45,549 --> 01:35:46,678
Hello Gordon. 

1090
01:35:47,582 --> 01:35:48,448
Pleased to meet you. 

1091
01:35:49,915 --> 01:35:52,249
-- Thank you for getting involved. 
-- Oh, sure. 

1092
01:35:54,094 --> 01:35:55,373
I heard that I was captain. 

1093
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:58,383
Yes, caring for John for 20years. 

1094
01:35:59,929 --> 01:36:02,563
I spent more time with him that the 
I spent with my own family. 

1095
01:36:05,988 --> 01:36:06,665
The 

1096
01:36:07,794 --> 01:36:09,262
I saved a puñalada. 

1097
01:36:10,015 --> 01:36:11,145
a few years ago that. 

1098
01:36:12,427 --> 01:36:12,916
Yes. 

1099
01:36:14,612 --> 01:36:15,744
Was dead sure. 

1100
01:36:18,642 --> 01:36:19,847
That is one reason why the ... 

1101
01:36:20,674 --> 01:36:23,347
... I came out of these things. 

1102
01:36:26,434 --> 01:36:27,451
We were true friends. 

1103
01:36:29,670 --> 01:36:30,423
Mine too. 

1104
01:36:33,817 --> 01:36:36,903
The not told me anything about this, 
When I last saw ¿sabes? 

1105
01:36:40,854 --> 01:36:41,570
Y. .. 

1106
01:36:42,624 --> 01:36:43,867
... your girlfriend wine ... 

1107
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:47,224
Oh, she wanted to tell you 

1108
01:36:50,045 --> 01:36:53,884
she wanted to give you a message, 
was postponing the wedding for when you leave. 

1109
01:36:56,708 --> 01:36:57,424
Thank you. 

1110
01:36:58,597 --> 01:36:59,538
Try to relax. 

1111
01:37:03,906 --> 01:37:05,412
John wanted this happen. 

1112
01:37:07,634 --> 01:37:08,538
That broke it. 

1113
01:37:12,303 --> 01:37:13,546
No, he did not. 

1114
01:37:30,882 --> 01:37:32,652
Usually, he recorded the words of others. 

1115
01:37:33,707 --> 01:37:36,267
If the original John 

1116
01:37:37,247 --> 01:37:40,297
would not be poetic, 
but it would be the truth. 

1117
01:37:41,957 --> 01:37:42,749
Close 13. 

1118
01:37:46,136 --> 01:37:46,853
Oh, let man, 

1119
01:37:46,966 --> 01:37:49,001
I wanted to be in peace the rest 
my judgement, Jackson ... 

1120
01:37:49,153 --> 01:37:50,131
Jackson is dead. 

1121
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:56,759
Please close it. 

1122
01:37:57,365 --> 01:37:59,327
Yes, you synthesizes prison. 

1123
01:38:00,493 --> 01:38:03,317
But they also force you to 
see what is most important. 

1124
01:38:04,899 --> 01:38:05,653
The family. 

1125
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:06,671
And loyalty. 

1126
01:38:08,252 --> 01:38:11,000
Because a convicted as 
you do not exist in this place. 

1127
01:38:18,638 --> 01:38:21,349
So who did not flee 
you becoming a criminal. 

1128
01:38:22,253 --> 01:38:23,984
Abrázala grows. 

1129
01:38:24,887 --> 01:38:27,145
To see what is 
what you really matter. 

1130
01:38:30,044 --> 01:38:32,867
This is my last council, Wade Porter. 

1131
01:38:33,806 --> 01:38:35,652
And to protect your family 
at any cost. 

1132
01:38:36,067 --> 01:38:37,647
Even if you are forced 
to kill again. 

1133
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:40,093
Because if I had to do 

1134
01:38:40,432 --> 01:38:43,030
what would have everything planned 
to bring across my rear. 

1135
01:38:52,963 --> 01:38:53,792
So, my friend, 

1136
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:58,768
Until 2008, there are over 2.3million 
people imprisoned in North America 

1137
01:38:58,994 --> 01:39:01,929
That number increases 
more than 1000per week.
