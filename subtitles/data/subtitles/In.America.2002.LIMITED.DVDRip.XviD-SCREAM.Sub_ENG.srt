1
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,440
There are some things
you should wish for...

2
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,480
and some things you shouldn't.

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,360
That's what my little brother
Frankie told me.

4
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,720
He told me I only had just three wishes.

5
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,080
And I looked in his eyes.

6
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,440
And I don't know why I believed him.

7
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,200
-Remember, we're on holiday, all right?
-Knock it off, Christy, love.

8
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,480
All those with U.S. passports,
use the two left lanes.

9
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,880
-Passports, please.
-We're on holidays!

10
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,200
-Are you, little girl?
-Yes. And my dad's not working.

11
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,480
What are your purposes
in visiting the U.S.?

12
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
We're on holidays.

13
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,240
-How long have you been in Canada?
-Just visiting.

14
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,920
Listening to my mom and dad...

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,960
We got the car in Canada.

16
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,360
...l was scared we weren't gonna
get across the border.

17
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,560
And if I didn't talk to Frankie,
how were we going to get into America?

18
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,720
'"Please, Frankie. Please.

19
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,040
'"Please help us, '"l said.

20
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,600
-How many children do you have?
-Three.

21
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,760
Two.

22
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,040
Two.

23
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,120
-it says three here.
-We lost one.

24
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,520
-What's your name, little girl?
-Ariel.

25
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,480
And who are you?

26
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,240
She's Christy.

27
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,520
-What age are you, Christy?
-She's 10.

28
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,200
-Welcome to America.
-Thanks very much.

29
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,560
And that was my first wish used up.

30
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,520
But I still had two left.

31
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,200
We heard Manhattan
before we ever saw it.

32
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,440
A thousand strange voices coming
from everywhere.

33
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,880
And you're not going to believe this...

34
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,720
but we had to go under the water
to get to the city.

35
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,960
No,I swear it. it was a real alien.

36
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,880
And we lost contact with everything.

37
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,880
it was like we were on another planet.

38
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,840
...classics from the '60s, '70s,
'80s, and '90s....

39
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,720
We looked all over Manhattan
for a place to live...

40
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,240
until finally we found the house
of the man who screams.

41
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,920
What are you doing
with the camera, little girl?

42
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,760
-You the police?
-What?

43
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,080
Fingers.

44
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,080
-Are you the police?
-No, we're Irish.

45
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,840
-All Irish are police.
-We're not.

46
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,240
Are we going to live here now?

47
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,200
-You're gonna live in here in this building?
-Yeah.

48
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,280
All right. Keep an eye on the car.
Papo's gonna keep you safe now.

49
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,840
All right? Come on in.
Welcome to your new mansion.

50
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,840
Come on.

51
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,840
Look, a lift!

52
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,920
That hasn't worked forever. Come on.

53
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,520
-Are we going to live here now?
-Yeah.

54
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,880
-Why?
-Nowhere else will take us.

55
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,920
-Why?
-They don't want kids in Manhattan.

56
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,280
-Why?
-Why do you think it's called ''Man''hattan?

57
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,080
Papo, don't come any further, man.

58
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,240
Relax, Tony. it's just me.

59
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,880
I know who it is.
Go back downstairs to your apartment.

60
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,160
I’m clean, man. I’m showing this family
the empty apartment.

61
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,600
-No way, Papo.
-All right.

62
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,560
All right, Papo. We'll take over from here.

63
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,120
-Why does he scream?
-Maybe he sees ghosts.

64
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,760
Is this a haunted house?

65
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,160
-it's like Fort Knox.
-Cool.

66
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,320
-Where did you learn that?
-What?

67
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,600
-''Cool.''
-I just heard it.

68
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,480
You're American already. it's disgusting.

69
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,200
-Race you in, Christy.
-it's huge!

70
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,280
I know. it's enormous.

71
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,200
-This is my room.
-it's big, girls.

72
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,400
-This is my room.
-I get top bunk.

73
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,800
Look, Dad. There's a bath
in the middle of the room.

74
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,120
There's pigeons! Ariel, look at this.

75
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,800
-it's a bit of a hole.
-it'll be fine when we do it up.

76
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,880
it'll cost us, Sarah.

77
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,960
How are we gonna pay for this place?

78
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,360
We'll sell the car.

79
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,320
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, good.

80
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,840
-Are you?
-I’m great.

81
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,160
Are you?

82
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,040
-Dad?
-What?

83
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,280
Can we keep the pigeons?

84
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,520
Dad, can we keep the pigeons?

85
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,640
No, we have to leave them go.

86
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,040
it seemed like all our problems
were flying away.

87
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,560
-Dad, can I help?
-Go and ask your mom.

88
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,680
-Mom, can I help?
-Why don't you go on your skates?

89
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,240
I'll fast forward through this bit.

90
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,480
Ariel got to know everybody
in the neighbourhood.

91
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,320
My mom couldn't get a job teaching.

92
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,680
So she got a job in the ice-cream parlor
so Dad could go to auditions.

93
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,040
I really like the character.

94
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,200
I’m glad you asked me back.

95
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,120
I just wanna say
I'm real pleased about that.

96
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,800
Has he looked at the part of Vinny?

97
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,800
The New York guy?
He's a bit of a stereotype.

98
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,280
But if you want him, you got him.

99
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,680
Can you do a London accent?

100
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,800
You having a laugh?
He's only got two lines.

101
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,040
Do you want me to come up there
and sort you out?

102
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,520
-Do you like him?
-Yeah.

103
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,440
But acting's about more than just accents.

104
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,680
I wanted to cast you.
But you've got to give me much more.

105
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,400
Don't you understand?

106
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,960
Get it out of your head.
it's from here and from here.

107
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,320
Just give me one more chance.

108
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,160
But he didn't get another chance.

109
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,080
And then summer came.
And with it, the heat.

110
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,760
And a new word.; humidity.

111
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,160
-Dad, it's still not working.
-Wait.

112
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,440
it's too hot.

113
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,840
-it's still not coming through the holes.
-Hang on there.

114
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,120
Wait.

115
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
it's coming.

116
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,920
it's working.

117
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,240
-Well done, Dad. it's lovely and cold.
-I love you.

118
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,760
Ariel, Dad has an audition.

119
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,400
-Dad!
-What?

120
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,840
-What are you doing?
-I’m reading my scripts.

121
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,920
-Why?
-Because I’m learning my lines.

122
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,600
Dad, can we stay here all day?

123
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,160
-Dad, America's okay.
-Great.

124
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,840
-Dad?
-What?

125
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,560
Nothing.

126
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,520
What are we doing here?

127
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,920
Dad, Ariel's upset.

128
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,040
-She's been too long in the bath.
-What's wrong with you?

129
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,760
-My feet are like prunes.
-What?

130
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,280
They're like prunes.

131
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,720
Oh, Jesus. Where's your ma?

132
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,960
Are you okay?

133
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,280
it's too hot.

134
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,200
Dad, how are you gonna get that
air conditioner up and down the path?

135
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,280
Dad, how are you gonna....

136
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,360
Come on!

137
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,120
Dad, they're gonna shoot you.

138
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,800
-Dad, look out!
-Asshole!

139
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,440
Look, it's Dad.

140
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,280
-You're using, Papo.
-No.

141
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,000
Don't you walk....

142
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,080
Can I have some of whatever he's on?

143
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,200
Crazy, fucking Irishman.

144
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,640
Christy, open the door.

145
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,400
Mom, Dad's got an air conditioner!

146
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,480
He's coming!

147
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,400
-Walk away from me! Go on.
-Jesus! You'll have a heart attack.

148
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,000
-Open the window.
-Open the window, Mom !

149
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,200
What's wrong?

150
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,600
Wrong plug.

151
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,400
25cents short.

152
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,560
That's no use to me.
I got to make a living. $1 .99.

153
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,400
I’ll give it to you tomorrow.

154
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,040
-You're from the junkies' building, right?
-So?

155
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,080
Look at that.

156
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,760
That's from holding the knife of a junkie.

157
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,360
I got 25 stitches. He got probation.

158
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,760
Do I look like a junkie to you?

159
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,360
$1 .99.

160
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,840
-What's that?
-There's 5cents on each of those.

161
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,280
-Where's the $100Igave you?
-I put it in the bank like you insisted.

162
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,760
And 25 cents.

163
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,720
And $2. Mr. American Dream.

164
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,560
And one plug.

165
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,920
And 1 cent.

166
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,800
Dad, don't worry. Mom’s breathing's okay.

167
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,240
Is it okay?

168
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,560
it's the lemon drops. They're magic.

169
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,920
You take them,
and you forget about your breathing.

170
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,400
Say your prayers.

171
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,840
it's all right.

172
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,400
Go on, get your head in there.
Is that good?

173
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,280
Is that lovely? Yeah?

174
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,440
-Get a load of that!
-Get Christy!

175
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Come on, get your face in there.
Look at that.

176
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,840
You're a genius, Dad.

177
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,280
Hey, gringo!

178
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,200
Gringo, what the hell's going on up there?

179
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,400
We got out of there as fast as we could.

180
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,480
We went to the bank,
took out our money...

181
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,400
and went to the movies
where it was lovely and cool.

182
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,960
Listen, don't be upset.
E.T.'s gone to Heaven.

183
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,120
-But they said he went home.
-Well, that's the same thing.

184
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,040
it's not.

185
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,200
I miss things.

186
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,640
What do you miss?

187
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,640
Things.I have no one to play with.

188
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,240
-You have your sister to play with.
-No. She plays with her camcorder.

189
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,040
And I have no one to tell my secrets to.

190
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,000
Christy telis them to her camcorder.

191
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,680
And she won't let me hear what she says.

192
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,760
And you don't play with us anymore.

193
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,360
-I do play with you.
-Not like you used to.

194
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,360
Here you go!

195
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Step right up,
pop the balloon to win a prize.

196
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,760
-Pick a number.
-Dad!

197
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,680
Dad, you can win E.T.!

198
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,480
it's a game of chance. it's as simple as pie.

199
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,320
Just throw the ball
through the hoop seven times...

200
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,200
-and you win E.T.
-Seven times? Is that all?

201
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,840
-Can adults play?
-Sure.

202
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,720
-Simple as pie.
-That's $2.

203
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,120
Keep throwing as long as
you double up your dollars.

204
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
lf you win, you get the money back
and any prize you like.

205
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,160
-You get all your money back if you win?
-Yes. And any doll you like.

206
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Yes!

207
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,840
-That's one.
-Come on, Johnny.

208
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,560
-Two down. Five to go. $4.
-Come on, we'll get there.

209
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,040
Come on, Dad. You're excellent.
You're brilliant.

210
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,200
All right, don't worry. I’ll get it in.

211
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,640
-Mom, is Dad going to win?
-Of course he is, darling.

212
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,160
Come on, Dad.

213
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,040
Yes!

214
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,680
Three, four, five. Very good.
Only two to go.

215
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,320
$8.

216
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,240
Game of chance. Simple as pie.

217
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,120
You can keep throwing
as long as you double up your dollars.

218
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,320
Shit!

219
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,800
-Number five, two to go. $16.
-Let's go for it.

220
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,280
-Come on, Dad. Only two more to go.
-All right. I’ll get this. Don't worry.

221
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,280
$32. We got $32 over here.

222
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,040
-I don't need a crowd.
-Well, you're the main attraction.

223
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,040
Game of chance. Simple as pie.

224
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,040
$64. Are we finished, sir?

225
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
Angela. Over here.

226
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,280
I got $55.

227
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,520
-Here,I have another $5.
-Just need $4 more.

228
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,680
-Dad, it doesn't matter.
-No.

229
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,600
Just take it, Johnny.

230
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,360
And $1 change for the big girl.
Only one to go.

231
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,760
One ball to go for the big doll
for the little girl.

232
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,120
Don't let him break your
concentration, Johnny.

233
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,560
-Give me the rent money.
-What?

234
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,680
-Give me the rent money.
-Please don't do this to me tonight.

235
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,160
I can't lose
in front of the kids again, Sarah.

236
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,600
Wait a minute. We got $128 over here.

237
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,880
Go on, Dad.

238
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,200
-We're finished now, sir.
-Leave it, please.

239
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,640
Go for it, man!

240
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,960
We can't blow all our money.

241
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,200
I believe in you, the kids believe in you,
and you can win that doll.

242
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,360
-Go on.
-You're gonna win.I just know it.

243
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,600
And then I used all my willpower
to quieten the crowd.

244
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,880
But it didn't work.

245
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,440
Every cent of every penny we owned...

246
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,840
was down for an E. T. doll worth $30.

247
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,000
So I said.;

248
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,400
'"Frankie,I have to ask you
for a second wish. '"

249
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,520
And to this day, my dad still believes
it was him who won the E. T. doll.

250
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Fee, fie, foe...

251
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,640
fum !

252
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,440
I smell the blood of an Irishwoman!

253
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,440
Give me a bite of you!

254
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,440
Come on, Christy. Come on.

255
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,920
Run, E.T.!

256
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,480
Help! Ariel!

257
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,840
Fee, fie, foe, fum !

258
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,440
I smell the blood of an Irishwoman!

259
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,880
Run, E.T., it's the monster!

260
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,240
Fee, fie, foe, fum !

261
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,240
I smell the blood of an Irishman!

262
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,040
-Johnny, what's wrong?
-I was looking for him.

263
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,520
I was looking for Frankie.

264
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,120
Just play with the kids, Johnny.

265
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,800
I couldn't find him.

266
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,040
Am I going insane?

267
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,400
Just act, Johnny. Just act.

268
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,320
Go on, love.

269
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,280
Fee, fie, foe, fum !

270
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,040
I still smell the blood...

271
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,440
of an Irishwoman!

272
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,240
Come on, give me your finger.

273
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,120
Christy, I’ll save you!

274
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,440
No, get off her now, Dad!

275
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,760
You didn't find me.

276
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,720
I wasn't looking for you.

277
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,560
Exactly. You weren't looking for me.

278
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,440
There's nowhere you could hide
I wouldn't find you.

279
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,320
Fee, fie, foe, fum !

280
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,640
-Girls.
-I still smell the blood of an Irishwoman.

281
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,920
Take the bag. Take the money.
Go to Heaven. Marina will look after you.

282
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,200
I smell the blood of an Irishwoman.

283
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,360
-Hi, you two.
-How are you doing, girls?

284
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,440
You're a little later than usual.
Where's your mom?

285
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,160
My mom is playing with Dad on her own.

286
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,840
Fee, fie...

287
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,400
foe, fum !

288
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,440
I smell the blood of an Irishwoman.

289
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,560
Fee, fie...

290
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,600
foe, fum !

291
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,800
I still smell the blood...

292
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,040
of an Irishwoman.

293
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,440
-Where are the kids?
-Leave it on.

294
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,440
it's all right. it's okay.

295
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,600
-Where are the kids?
-They're fine.

296
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,840
They're in Heaven.
Marina's looking after them.

297
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,320
-Come on to me. Come on.
-No!

298
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,440
And that was the moment
the baby was conceived.

299
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,080
What's wrong?

300
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,160
Was it that good?

301
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,520
Was it that bad?

302
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,160
Look at me, Sarah.

303
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,240
Are you all right?

304
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,440
What's wrong?

305
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,120
Come here to me.

306
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,320
I can't.

307
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,720
Come here to me.

308
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,720
Look at me and tell me the truth.

309
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,160
Frankie had your eyes, Johnny.

310
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,440
Say something.

311
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,720
You blame me.

312
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,880
I should have been there to catch him
when he fell down the stairs.

313
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,120
it's my fault.

314
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,120
I don't blame you.

315
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,960
We had to go to a Catholic school.
So my dad took a night job.

316
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,800
Ariel was worried about a blind man
called José.

317
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,760
Everybody smile and say ''cheese.''

318
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,200
Cheese!

319
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,600
Christy, why can José not see?

320
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,200
it's not José, it's:

321
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,640
O say can you see

322
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,120
I helped, too.

323
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,960
Fill the bag with these, like that.
Yellow ones.

324
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,160
Okay.

325
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,280
Statue of Liberty.

326
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,080
Nation, friends, and caring.

327
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,160
So now we're all together.

328
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,840
I’m hungry!

329
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,160
Keep your eye on the meter.

330
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,680
And get in the cab
and keep your ear on the radio.

331
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,280
I won't be long. And lock the doors.

332
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,840
401 to Base. lf you can hear me, come in.

333
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,760
Hello, Base here. Where's your dad, girls?

334
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,920
He's in his audition.

335
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,680
-Where are you?
-I’m not positive.

336
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,800
Christy, do you know where you are?

337
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,160
No.

338
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,520
Are you on Broadway?

339
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,480
-Yeah.
-I think so.

340
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,960
Near where?

341
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,040
-Near the audition.
-Yeah. Very good.

342
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,240
Is my baby all right?

343
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,880
How are you feeling?

344
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,480
Fine. A little bit tired.
But other than that, I’m okay.

345
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,360
Mom, do you think
Dad will know who I am?

346
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,440
You look great. You'll knock them out.

347
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,720
-Can you guess what they are?
-Ariel's an angel.

348
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,480
Christy's a forest.

349
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,760
-She's autumn.
-No, fall.

350
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,840
That's what they call it here in America.
Fall. Like leaves fall.

351
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,160
You guys look great. They look great.

352
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,240
-Irish. Spare a quarter, please?
-I got a quarter.

353
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,560
You're the best.
He gave me a quarter, Angela.

354
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,520
He gave me a quarter.

355
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,960
-There you go.
-Thank you, sir.

356
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,520
-Who are they?
-That's the Irish.

357
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,520
What's wrong?

358
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,560
Everyone else has bought their costumes.

359
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,520
-We look stupid.
-No, you don't.

360
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,680
And last but not least,
a special prize this year...

361
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,440
for the best homemade costume
goes to the Sullivan sisters.

362
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,080
You can't throw away your prize.

363
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,120
-Best homemade costume.
-They made it up because they pity us.

364
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,200
-You got it 'cause you're different.
-We don't want to be.

365
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,240
We want to be the same
as everybody else.

366
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,640
Why would you wanna be the same
as everybody else?

367
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,080
-Everybody else goes trick-or-treating.
-What's that?

368
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,400
it's what they do here for Halloween.

369
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,760
Like ''Help-the-Halloween'' party?

370
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,920
No, not ''Help-the-Halloween'' party.

371
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,600
You don't ask for help in America.
You demand it.

372
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,040
Trick or treat. You don't ask. You threaten.

373
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,240
-You can't do that on our street.
-Why not?

374
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,160
Because you can't threaten
drug addicts and transvestites, that's why.

375
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,600
What are transvestites?

376
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,320
A man who dresses up as a woman.

377
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,960
-For Halloween?
-No, all the time.

378
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,280
Come on.

379
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,440
-Why?
-it's just what they do here, okay?

380
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,200
We were allowed to go trick-or-treating
in our stupid building.

381
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,160
Trick or treat!

382
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,440
-Dad, get out of here!
-Trick or treat!

383
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,320
Come on, let's try another door.

384
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,520
Answer the fucking door.

385
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,720
-Why won't they answer?
-Maybe they're afraid.

386
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,440
We're nice kids, so let us in.

387
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,760
-How many doors is that?
-Four.

388
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,560
Why am I so anxious?

389
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,680
it's the stairs, Johnny.

390
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,800
-it says ''keep away.''
-I don't care. Come on, Christy.

391
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,840
Trick or treat!

392
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,400
Trick or treat.

393
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,720
Who's there?

394
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,320
-Someone's in there.
-Oh, my God!

395
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,920
No drugs here! Other door.

396
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,880
Knock again.I dare you.

397
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,200
-Trick or treat!
-Who....

398
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,360
Go away!

399
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,240
What?

400
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,440
Hello.

401
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,760
-Are you the kids from upstairs?
-Yeah.

402
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600
-Is this Halloween?
-Yeah.

403
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,280
-Where are you from?
-Ireland.

404
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,760
You came all the way to America
to trick-or-treat?

405
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,960
Yeah.

406
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,120
Come in.

407
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,440
-Are there only two of you?
-Two girls.

408
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,840
Are they all right in there?

409
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,920
They'll be fine.

410
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,640
-What's your name?
-Mateo.

411
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,000
- What's yours?
- Ariel. Hello.

412
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,480
- My name's Christy.
- Hi, Christy.

413
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,440
- Is that our building?
- Yes, it is.

414
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,520
Looks like a haunted house.

415
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,040
It is haunted. But it's not scary.

416
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,720
- It's a magic house.
- Frankie believed in magic.

417
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,360
- Who's that?
- Frankie. Our brother. He died.

418
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,640
He fell down the stairs when he was two.

419
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,040
We thought he was okay.

420
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,200
But there was something in his brain.

421
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,360
A brain tumour.

422
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,720
And for three years
it got bigger and bigger.

423
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,440
It was malignant.

424
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,720
Are you crying?

425
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,680
Are you?

426
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,640
It's okay. He's in Heaven now.

427
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,240
Is that your hand?

428
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,480
- Yes.
- Is that blood?

429
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,800
Spaghetti sauce.

430
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,480
Come here.

431
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,560
I better treat you or you'll trick me,
am I right?

432
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,440
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's find something.

433
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,920
Let's see. So, what's in the fridge?

434
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,920
Nothing.

435
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,920
How about this?

436
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,160
- How much is in it?
- A lot. Mateo's fortune.

437
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,440
- It's too much.
- No, it's not.

438
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,640
When luck comes knocking on your door,
you can't turn it away.

439
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,520
- Happy Halloween.
- Okay, happy Halloween. Bye.

440
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,040
Hi, Dad!

441
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,960
We're going to show Mam
what we got, okay?

442
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,520
Happy Halloween.

443
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,000
Happy Halloween, Mateo.

444
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,200
He was really nice,
and he gave us lots of money.

445
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,120
How much does it add up to, Christy?

446
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,360
Two hundred and forty pennies,
twelve nickels, and two dimes.

447
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,640
- How much is that all together?
- $3.20.

448
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,440
- And he had nothing in his fridge?
- Just medicine.

449
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,120
We should invite him over.

450
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,080
No way.

451
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,880
He gives me the heebie-jeebies.

452
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,160
- What is it?
- It's called colcannon.

453
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,400
It's potatoes mixed with curly kale.

454
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,680
Right. Plates, please.

455
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,600
Thank you.

456
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,600
Wow! That means you're gonna be rich.

457
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,880
Halloween is called the Day of Ancestors.

458
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,880
When the dead come back,
you hear their voices.

459
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,880
How do you hear them?

460
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,520
You hear their voices
through the men dancing.

461
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,400
What do they say?

462
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,800
They complain.

463
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,720
"You don't pay attention to me.

464
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,800
"You don't feed me.

465
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,680
"I'm hungry."

466
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,960
Are they ever happy?

467
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,520
When they're happy,
you never hear from them.

468
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,360
You're magic. You're winning everything.

469
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,000
That means you're gonna get married.

470
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,880
Christy!

471
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,440
Who's that?

472
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,000
You see that?

473
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,400
Do you not think I'm bad,
or are you just saying I'm good 'cause...

474
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,480
You are.

475
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,080
- Am I doing the wings nice?
- You're doing great.

476
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,240
- Really?
- Yes.

477
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,280
I thought I was bad.

478
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,240
You're doing great.

479
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,280
- Is that you in the pictures?
- Yeah.

480
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,840
So you were rich?

481
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,160
Is that why the angel has blue blood?

482
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,680
You know, in the Irish language,
the word for "black man" is fear gorm.

483
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,240
But that really means "blue man."

484
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,480
The word for "black man" is fear dub.

485
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,920
And that means "the Devil."

486
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,520
You have us figured out?

487
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,960
They can't wipe us out, they can't lick us.

488
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:40,160
We'll go on forever, Pa,
'cause we're the people.

489
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,840
"I said in mine heart, go to now...

490
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,680
"prove thee with mirth,
therefore enjoy pleasure." Awesome.

491
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,040
Johnny, come to bed. It's late, come on.

492
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,640
Put the script down now.

493
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:12,200
- You're happy.
- I am. It's something Mateo said.

494
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,560
What's he say?

495
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,200
He said everything's gonna be all right.

496
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,680
And the baby will bring its own luck.

497
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,920
The baby will bring its own luck.

498
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,360
That's it there. You see?

499
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,680
I could be wrong...

500
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,960
but I haven't felt the baby move
for a couple of weeks.

501
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,280
It's serious.

502
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,640
This baby will not go full term.

503
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,880
And if it did, it would be
extremely dangerous to your health.

504
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,400
If you decide to go ahead with this,
you'll have to be a very brave woman.

505
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,440
But I thought the doctor said
you couldn't have any more babies.

506
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,880
Sometimes, Ariel, doctors are wrong.

507
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,320
There. It just kicked.

508
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,640
Oh, my God!

509
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,520
Johnny, feel it.

510
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,160
I remember the first time
you kicked, Christy.

511
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,400
It was in one of your dad's plays.

512
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,640
Every time he spoke, you kicked.

513
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,400
Like you were applauding him.

514
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,680
- Did I ever kick?
- You kicked like a mule, night and day.

515
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,600
There it is again.

516
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,440
Johnny, did you feel it?

517
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,400
I can't feel anything.

518
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,920
Do you want me to lie?

519
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,120
You're the only actor in the world
who can't lie, Johnny.

520
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,400
- Not even for the sake of your kids?
- What does that mean?

521
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,640
If you can't touch somebody you created...

522
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,520
how can you create somebody
that'll touch anybody?

523
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,240
- What are you going on about?
- Acting, Johnny.

524
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,120
And bringing something to life.
It's the same thing.

525
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,040
That's why you can't get a job acting,
because you can't feel anything.

526
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,720
This baby's not Frankie, Sarah.

527
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,960
Look at me. Why don't you look at me?

528
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,840
You've gotten over him.

529
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,080
I had to get over him, Johnny,
for the sake of the kids.

530
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,960
So you're gonna put your life on the line
for the sake of the kids?

531
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,440
- And that's protecting them?
- Yes.

532
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,200
- That's a total contradiction.
- How?

533
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,760
You know what the doctor said.

534
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,680
I don't care what they said.

535
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,920
What do they know about us?
And my baby?

536
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,320
I gotta fucking get out of here.

537
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,360
Where are you going?

538
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,000
- This is real.
- No!

539
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,880
This is real. It's not a fucking play!

540
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,280
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

541
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,840
- Let me get out.
- No.

542
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,880
You'll upset the kids!

543
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,960
I'll be back in a minute.

544
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:17,320
Johnny, come back.
Johnny, where are you going?

545
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,080
Johnny, you're scaring me. Come back.

546
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,200
Just come back. Johnny, please.

547
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,720
All right? Everything all right?

548
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,640
The baby will bring its own luck, will it?

549
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,680
I'll tell you the luck the baby will bring.
The baby could infect her...

550
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,400
and two giris will be left without their ma.

551
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,000
So keep your trap shut.

552
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,240
You don't believe.

553
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,840
In what?

554
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,040
God?

555
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,480
You know, I asked him a favour.

556
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,560
I asked him to take me instead of him.

557
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,840
And he took the both of us.

558
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,840
And look what he put in my place.

559
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,160
I'm a fucking ghost. I don't exist.

560
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,040
I can't think. I can't laugh. I can't cry.

561
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,680
I can't fucking feel!

562
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,480
Do you wanna be me?

563
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,400
- Do you wanna be in my place?
- I wish.

564
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,640
Are you in love with her?

565
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,680
- Are you in love with her?
- No.

566
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,520
I'm in love with you.

567
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,880
And I'm in love
with your beautiful woman.

568
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,520
And I'm in love with your kids.

569
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,400
And I'm even in love
with your unborn child.

570
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,480
I'm even in love with your anger!

571
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,080
I'm in love with anything that lives!

572
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,760
You're dying.

573
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,600
I'm sorry.

574
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,920
That's Frankie.

575
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,960
I'm just scared.

576
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,720
It's gone. I can't make-believe anymore.

577
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,520
Sometimes, I think our entire lives
are make-believe.

578
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,120
This is make-believe.

579
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,280
The air I breathe is make-believe.

580
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,600
Just make believe you're happy, Johnny.
Please, for the kids.

581
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,320
"Now is the winter of our discontent

582
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,080
"Made glorious summer
by this sun of York

583
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,240
"And all the clouds that there are around

584
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,880
"dance to the lascivious pleasings of a lute

585
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,120
"Now is the winter of our discontent

586
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,440
"Made glorious summer
by this sun of York"

587
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,840
So I'm a little high...

588
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,240
Sometimes, it seemed like everyone
in New York was an actor.

589
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,440
Even the stockbrokers.

590
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,480
You might not think it to look at me...

591
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,120
and I know I'm white and everything,
but I can rap.

592
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,440
Help, somebody!
Somebody call an ambulance!

593
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,560
Come on, man. Somebody, help!

594
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,880
He's fallen down the stairs!

595
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,360
I think someone's fallen down the stairs.

596
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,360
I think it's Mateo. Get your coat.

597
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,880
It's Mateo. Will I get the lemon drops?

598
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,160
- Yeah, and a pillow.
- Okay.

599
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,800
Mateo! Did anyone call for help?

600
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,200
He just fainted.

601
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,960
Keep the dog away, man, keep him away.

602
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:55,000
- Go downstairs.
- Stevie doesn't let me. He'll lock me out.

603
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,920
That's because you're a junkie, Papo.
Go and get an ambulance.

604
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,520
Don't do that.

605
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,440
- I did this to my brother.
- No. It's different.

606
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,480
Come on, come on.

607
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,840
Are you okay?

608
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,880
- Are you okay?
- Can't seem to catch my breath.

609
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,520
- Just relax.
- Here.

610
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,480
- What are they?
- They're lemon drops. They're magic.

611
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,880
If you suck on some,
they'll make you better.

612
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,480
- Is that right, Christy?
- Yeah.

613
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,440
My mom takes them to help the baby.

614
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,960
I think you saved my life, Ariel.

615
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,720
All right, that's it.
Get out of the fucking cab!

616
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,800
What are you talking about?
I was right in the middle of a flow.

617
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,600
Come on, what the hell
is the matter with you, you freak?

618
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,480
Where's the Bill of Rights?

619
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,200
- Get the fuck off me, you piece of shit.
- Take your fucking handbag!

620
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,280
Night, E.T.

621
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,840
Are you awake, Ariel?

622
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,160
- Yeah. Are you, Christy?
- Yeah.

623
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,400
- What's wrong with Mateo?
- Some disease.

624
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,440
- Will you get it?
- What?

625
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,400
Mateo's disease.

626
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,240
- Why?
- Because you kissed him.

627
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,520
No.

628
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,880
- Night, Christy.
- Night.

629
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,200
There's Dad.

630
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,120
Get him, Frankie, get him.

631
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,520
You okay?

632
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,880
I was just out of breath.

633
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,560
What was Frankie like?

634
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,280
A warrior.

635
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,440
What does that mean?

636
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,800
A warrior who's not afraid
to go to the other side.

637
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,080
The other side of what?

638
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,360
This.

639
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,360
Hi, Dad.

640
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,360
Ladies and gentlemen, we are not alone.

641
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:42,360
Here on this little ball we call the Earth...

642
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:45,120
we have friends among us.

643
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,440
Don't be scared. He's not too well now.

644
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,720
Did he not take the lemon drops?

645
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,600
I don't think they agree with him anymore.

646
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,040
Why do you have sores?

647
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:38,440
If I tell you a secret,
will you tell nobody else?

648
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,160
No, I won't.

649
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,200
I'm an alien. Like E.T.

650
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,040
From a different planet.

651
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,440
My skin is too sensitive for this Earth.

652
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,360
Right?

653
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,920
The air is too hot for me.

654
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,440
Are you going home like E.T.?

655
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,240
I suppose I'm going home.

656
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,960
When are you going?

657
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,040
Soon.

658
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,600
Will you say goodbye to me?

659
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,280
- I will.
- Promise?

660
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,840
Yes, I promise.

661
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,800
Mom’s having a baby.

662
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,280
What do you think we should call it?

663
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,360
We're going to call it after you.

664
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,680
I think he's asleep.

665
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,160
My mom had to go into hospital...

666
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:21,200
so I thought about using my third wish.
But I had to be careful.

667
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,840
If the baby came too soon,
the baby might die.

668
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,240
And if the baby came too late,
my mom might die.

669
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,840
You have to be careful what you wish for.

670
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,240
Come on, kids, time to go.
See you later, all right?

671
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,560
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

672
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,640
- Take it easy, love.
- See you tomorrow.

673
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:42,480
- Bye.
- Love you.

674
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,680
Excuse me, Mr. Sullivan?

675
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,320
We'll need that check by Friday.

676
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,800
- For how much?
- $5,000.

677
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,120
All right, okay. That's great. Thanks.

678
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:03,680
You know the situation.
You know I'm in trouble.

679
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,080
- Come on.
- "Shut up.

680
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,960
"Look into my eyes.
What are they telling you?

681
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,880
"They're telling you no.

682
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,360
"You either do the job
or you get out of town. Understand?"

683
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:24,320
- I understand.
- That was good, Dad.

684
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,360
Yeah, it wasn't so bad from you.

685
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,000
You're gonna get it, Dad.

686
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,680
- Do you think so?
- Yeah.

687
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,120
Will we sell the camcorder?

688
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,040
No.

689
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,680
Don't be worrying, girl.
Everything's gonna be okay.

690
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:57,080
Hey, Irish. Irish!

691
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,440
Hey, Johnny.
Haven't seen you for seven days.

692
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,360
- That means you owe me $7.
- Jesus, not again.

693
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,120
A dollar a day keeps Frank away.
Hey, I'm joking.

694
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,360
I've no money.

695
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,040
No, no. I got something for you.

696
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,160
Here, here.

697
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,280
- What are they?
- They're food stamps.

698
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,440
- I'm all right, thanks.
- Come on, you helped me out.

699
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,880
I'm just trying to help you out for once.
Come on, take them.

700
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,200
You can't take something from me?
Take the stamps.

701
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,280
Come on, take the stamps.

702
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,640
- Thanks.
- No problem, Irish.

703
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,040
Come on then. Tuck you in.

704
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,640
Dad? Who's gonna iron
our school uniforms?

705
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,560
Daddo the baddo.

706
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,760
- Dad?
- What?

707
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,680
- I need money for school.
- I have that sorted. It's all right.

708
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,440
- Okay.
- Okay?

709
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,480
- Night, Dad.
- Good night.

710
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:11,200
Dad. You forgot to say Christy's prayer.

711
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,400
- I don't know it.
- I'll say it.

712
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,560
- All right.
- Kneel.

713
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,360
- What?
- Will you kneel?

714
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,800
No. I'm not kneeling, no.

715
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:33,040
- Mom always kneels.
- But dads are different.

716
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:41,000
- I want Mom.
- Christy, do the prayer, would you?

717
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:46,400
No monsters, no ghosts.
No nightmares, no witches.

718
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,200
No people coming into the kitchen,
smashing the dishes.

719
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,160
No deviis coming out of the mirror,
no dolis coming alive.

720
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,560
Mateo going home, Frankie in Heaven.

721
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,920
The baby not coming too early or too late.

722
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,760
Mom, Dad, Christy, and Ariel,
all together in one happy family...

723
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,480
and all well with the world. Amen.

724
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,320
You're great girls.

725
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,680
I'll see you in the morning.

726
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,720
- Night, Dad.
- Night, Dad.

727
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:28,520
- How much does it cost in the hospital?
- Thousands and thousands.

728
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,200
Good night.

729
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,320
"To be, or not to be..."

730
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,600
Blah, blah, fucking blah.

731
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,280
"Whether it be nobler in the mind"...

732
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,960
to stick my head in the fucking oven
and end it all?

733
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,440
Where's Dad?

734
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,400
I want my dad.

735
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,440
- I am your dad.
- You're not my dad.

736
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,840
I want my real dad.

737
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,560
- Come here.
- Stay away from me.

738
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,040
- Come here to me.
- Where's Mom?

739
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:07,640
- What did you do with Mom?
- I'll get Mom. Come here, baby.

740
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,040
No! Mom!

741
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,640
Come here to me.

742
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,760
Look at me, look at me.

743
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:35,680
- Am I your dad?
- No.

744
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,280
Here, look. Look at me.

745
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,840
Am I your dad?

746
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,080
Maybe.

747
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,800
So spring came. And with it, the baby.

748
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,040
It had come too soon.

749
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,520
Can you get Karen for me?

750
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:15,800
Please don't let my baby come.
I don't want my baby to come.

751
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:19,240
No, it's too early. It's too early!

752
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,000
Coming through, stat.

753
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,400
I need a morphine drip.

754
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,880
Nurse, morphine.

755
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,680
Johnny, why is my baby not crying?

756
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:37,720
- Just go with the baby, go with the baby.
- I'm going.

757
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,680
We've stabilized her for now...

758
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:03,640
but she will need a blood transfusion
in the next couple of hours.

759
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,760
All right?

760
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:21,880
Everything's gonna be okay.
The baby needs a blood transfusion.

761
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:27,560
We have to sign this consent form.
The pair of us.

762
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,720
Is that okay?

763
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:41,960
All the blood is bad.
Mateo said all the blood is bad.

764
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,280
You're not giving my baby bad blood.

765
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,760
You gave my baby bad blood.

766
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:54,760
And that's why he died.
That's why he fell down the stairs.

767
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,320
This is the new baby, Sarah.

768
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:08,280
He tried to climb the gate. And he fell.

769
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:12,040
Why did you put it up?

770
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,600
- Where is he?
- Who?

771
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:18,960
Frankie.

772
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,360
Frankie's not with us, Sarah.

773
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,120
You should have taken the gate down.

774
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:44,440
It's your fault.
You should have taken the gate down!

775
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,080
- You're hiding him.
- No, I'm not.

776
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:51,280
- I want to get Frankie. I want my baby!
- Calm down, all right?

777
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:56,040
- Where is he? I want Frankie.
- Easy. Easy, now. Doctor!

778
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,960
It's your fault he fell down the stairs.

779
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,160
Could you ring your bell there? Doctor!

780
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,000
Why didn't you take the gate down?

781
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,840
- It's all right.
- No, please.

782
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,440
Please, I'm begging you, please.
Johnny, please.

783
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:11,720
No, no, please. I want to see my baby.

784
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,640
- Please don't take my new baby.
- I'm not taking her.

785
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,800
- Save my baby, Johnny, please.
- I promise.

786
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,520
I will.

787
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,600
If the baby dies, just don't wake me up.

788
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,160
- There's only one other solution.
- What's that?

789
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,400
- Are you O-negative?
- I am.

790
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,360
Christy's O-negative.

791
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,840
- What if I have it?
- Have what?

792
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,520
Mateo's disease.

793
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,640
That's not possible, Christy.

794
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,440
How do you know, Dad?

795
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,960
God won't let that happen to you.

796
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
You don't believe in God.

797
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,960
- I'm scared.
- Don't be scared.

798
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,120
Everyone's dying.

799
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,760
- Will she survive it?
- She can't survive without it.

800
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,920
That's what the doctors said
before they opened Frankie.

801
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:40,720
- What do we do?
- I'll give her the blood.

802
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,000
Is that a decision?

803
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,600
Christy will give her the blood.

804
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,840
Are you okay, little girl?

805
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,560
Don't "little girl" me.

806
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:06,440
I've been carrying this family
on my back for over a year.

807
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,960
Ever since Frankie died.

808
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,400
He was my brother, too.

809
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:17,280
It's not my fault that he's dead.
It's not my fault that I'm still alive.

810
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,600
Christy.

811
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,520
Mom was always crying
because he was her son.

812
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:29,200
But he was my brother, too.
I cried, too, when no one was looking.

813
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,200
- And I talked to him every night.
- She did, Dad.

814
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:42,800
- I talked to him every night until...
- Until when?

815
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,920
Until I realized I was talking to myself.

816
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,040
Listen, I'll take her home, okay?

817
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,560
- All right. Thanks very much.
- No problem.

818
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,160
Your check bounced.

819
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:16,640
I sat there with my dad, and all the noises
of New York disappeared.

820
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:22,040
All I could hear
was the blood thumping in my ear.

821
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,600
But for some reason, I felt happy.

822
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:31,760
I wondered if Frankie
had felt like this. ; special.

823
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:36,960
Everybody looking at you
like they were looking in a mirror.

824
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,400
And smiling. Except in their eyes.

825
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,240
Did Frankie know he was going to die?

826
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,880
Is that why he kept nodding
and smiling at us?

827
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:18,760
When he died, I cursed God.

828
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,720
I told him,
"You're not gonna see these snotty tears...

829
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,320
"running down my cheeks ever again."

830
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,240
So now, I can't cry.

831
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,000
I thought I'd come in here...

832
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:42,880
and you'd wake up, you'd hold my hand.

833
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:48,360
I'd cry, and the kid would be all right.

834
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,640
Everything would be okay.

835
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,040
We need a miracle, Mateo.

836
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,560
Hey, Irish, whoa.

837
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,560
You can't say hello?

838
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,720
What? What's up?

839
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,440
- I'm sorry, man.
- A bad day?

840
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:24,480
- You could say that.
- Yeah, the whole world had a bad day.

841
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:30,000
Joe, come on, give me a few bucks.

842
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:34,480
- Come on.
- I don't have any money to give you.

843
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,760
I'm sorry. I'm stupid.
I shouldn't be bothering you.

844
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,640
Come on, lighten up, Joe.
It's gonna get better.

845
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:48,560
Come on, Irish. Fighting Irish.
I'm coming to get you.

846
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,200
Just give me some money.

847
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,800
I'm not doing this for me. It's for Angela.

848
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,720
Come on, put your hand in your pocket.

849
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:01,080
- Take it easy.
- Your other pocket.

850
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:06,120
Your other pocket. Faster, Irish.
Let me see it.

851
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,560
Get it out.

852
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,480
- I don't know what it is.
- Take it out.

853
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:14,840
I'm taking it out. Okay, there you go.

854
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,320
I just needed money.

855
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:26,560
I'm sorry, okay?

856
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,680
Okay, that's enough.

857
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:40,520
Stop it. I'm sorry. Joe, I'm sorry.

858
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:50,960
- Hey, Joe. We're still friends?
- Go to hell.

859
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,040
We were waiting for the baby
to show some sign of life.

860
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,560
She just lay there and lay there.

861
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:13,280
The hospital bill arrived. It came to. ;

862
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:17,600
$30,420.20.

863
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,680
Look, just get me in the door
for the audition.

864
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,840
I'll give them whatever they want.

865
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,880
Sir. Your bill is ready.

866
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,160
All right.

867
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,800
- Bill's been paid.
- What do you mean?

868
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,840
A Mateo Kuamey paid it.

869
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,960
There's no balance.

870
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:50,520
See, see my playmate
Come back

871
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,960
Finally, my dad got a part in a play.

872
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,400
And he came to tell us the good news.

873
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:57,240
Since 1982

874
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,880
Got some good news, girls.

875
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:01,960
Sarah Mateo Sullivan is coming home
from the hospital.

876
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,240
Cool, yeah!

877
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,760
- Look who it is.
- How are you doing there?

878
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,560
- You want a look?
- Yeah.

879
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:17,280
- Mom, can I?
- Yeah, grand.

880
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,640
Okay, see you later.

881
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,280
Big yawn.

882
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,840
What's wrong?

883
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,960
- He never said goodbye.
- What?

884
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,400
He never said goodbye.

885
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:51,560
The baby's asleep.

886
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:57,360
Christy.

887
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,200
Come here to me.

888
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:12,480
Look up there and tell me what you see.

889
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:14,440
A full moon.

890
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,520
And what else do you see?

891
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:19,320
Stars.

892
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,600
Can you not see Mateo?

893
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:26,440
He's going past the moon on his bike.

894
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,880
I think he's waving goodbye to Ariel.

895
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,080
- Will we tell her?
- Yeah.

896
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,240
Look up there.

897
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:47,800
That's Mateo riding past the moon
on his bike.

898
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,480
- Where?
- There, look.

899
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:52,240
- Can you not see him waving to you?
- No.

900
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:57,520
- He's right there.
- He's there, flying past the moon.

901
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,760
- Can you see him?
- No.

902
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,840
Can you not see him waving to you?
He's waving goodbye.

903
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,760
Just like he promised.

904
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,040
Oh, yeah. Bye, Mateo.

905
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,400
- Bye, Mateo.
- Bye, Mateo.

906
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,920
Bye, Mateo. Look after Frankie.

907
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:18,720
- Look after Frankie.
- Look after...

908
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,680
And then I asked for my third wish.

909
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,120
Say goodbye to Frankie, Dad.

910
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,240
What?

911
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,600
Say goodbye to Frankie.

912
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,840
- Bye, Frankie.
- He can't hear you, Dad.

913
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:58,000
Goodbye, Frankie.

914
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,280
Get out of here.

915
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,720
Dad wants you.

916
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:00,200
It was as hard for Frankie to smile,
when the tumour was malignant...

917
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,040
as it was for my dad to cry after.

918
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:06,840
But they both managed it.

919
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,160
I'm going to switch this off now.

920
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:16,000
It's not the way
I want to see Frankie anymore.

921
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,920
Do you still have a picture of me
in your head?

922
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:36,240
Well, that's like the picture
I want to have of Frankie.

923
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:40,280
One that you can keep
in your head forever.

924
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,200
So when you go back to reality...

925
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,600
I'll ask Frankie...

926
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:54,040
to please, please, let me go.
