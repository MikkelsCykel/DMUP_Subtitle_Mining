00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,781
This is the party.

2
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:21,113
Chris! You awake?

3
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:25,991
Breakfast is on the table.

4
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:28,392
Come eat this shit
before it get cold.

5
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:31,124
lt'd help if you
wouldn't call it shit, Pop.

6
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:34,361
lt'd help if you get
your ass down and eat it.

7
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:13,530
Pop, Play--Peter's having
a party, and l wanted to...

8
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:53,935
Finish your breakfast, boy!

9
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,175
Yo, man, you are wrong.

10
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:57,877
We're homeboys.

11
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:00,546
Why you pretending like
you don't want to D.J. the gig?

12
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:02,418
l don't D.J. for free anymore.

13
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:05,185
Plus, you never provide
transportation.

14
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:09,628
How do l get my turntables,
records, and speakers there?

15
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:12,962
Yo, man, l have the house keys
and the car keys.

16
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:16,400
My parents--down south,
way down south. We're in.

17
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:18,404
Let me rap,
and then we'll consider it.

18
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:21,305
You already got gonged
in the school talent show.

19
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:23,707
Why you want to embarrass
yourself again?

20
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:26,439
l've been practicing.
l got dope lyrics.

21
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,414
Def women l'm gonna be
hooking you up with.

22
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,045
This ain't no tackhead party.
Def women like those.

23
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:36,317
You like that?

24
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:37,550
l do.

25
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:39,718
Check this out. lt's Play time.

26
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,021
Hook me up, all right?

27
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:44,454
That's a weave, girl.

28
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:46,431
Yo, ladies, ladies.

29
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:48,730

in attendance...

30
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:51,794
at the super-def,
throw-down jizzam of the year.

31
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:54,398
Sharane, you hear anything
about a party tonight?

32
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:56,875
Not any good ones.

33
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,572
Yo, wait a minute.
Don't even try and play me.

34
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:01,979
l'm not beggin'
either one of y'all.

35
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:04,006
-You have before.
-You will again.

36
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,349
Listen, you know the address.

37
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:10,379
10:30, and you can
bring some friends.

38
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,555
Hey, don't play.

39
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:19,292
Since you're not into sharing,
l'll get my own.

40
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:21,732
While you're over there,
give the ladies my regards.

41
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:22,928
Right.

42
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:31,106
Stab, l'm really sorry.

43
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:33,442
l'm sorry. l'm really sorry.

44
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,004
No, don't get up.

45
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:36,276
l'll get you another milk.

46
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:38,284
l'll pay for it myself.

47
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:41,378
You need a milk?
l'll be right back.

48
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:45,323
lf l was you,
l'd kick his fuckin' ass.

49
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:47,485
Damn.

50
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:49,757
You went out like a sucker.

51
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:52,060
So if l throw with them,
you got my back?

52
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:54,692
Of course. You know that.

53
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:58,067
l'm your man.
You know l'm gonna take--

54
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:02,870
-Hi, Kid.
-Hi.

55
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:07,346
You finished?
We were about to sit with you.

56
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,975
l was gonna sit a little longer,
so you should.

57
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:13,645
Are you really not coming
to the party tonight?

58
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:16,087
Why? Should we?

59
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:17,282
lt's up to you.

60
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:19,655
lf you weren't going,
l'd probably skip it, too.

61
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:21,490
l think you should go.

62
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:24,929
-We'll probably see you there.
-Maybe.

63
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:26,864
You should be nice to him.

64
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,835
You started it.
"Why? Should we?"

65
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:31,029
Shut up.

66
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:40,512
Anyway, l was over there, right?

67
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:43,345
That's twice.

68
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:49,519
You conscious motherfucker.

69
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:53,083
You got a sleepwalking problem,
we can fix it.

70
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:56,186
We'll break your legs
and kick your fucking ass!

71
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,392
l'll break my leg off
up in your ass so far...

72
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:01,593
you'll shit sneaker for a month.

73
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:04,228
-l've done it before.
-He'll do it again.

74
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,864
Why you sweating me, man?

75
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:08,703
You're wrinkling
my school clothes.

76
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:10,334
"You're wrinkling
my school clothes."

77
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:13,972
Yo, wait, wait.

78
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:17,312
What's the problem?
Your mama can't afford no iron?

79
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,614
Tell her to come on over
to Stab.

80
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:22,280
l'll put her on the stroll.
She can save up, get one.

81
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:24,756
He can't fuck with you.

82
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,089
Watch out, man! Watch it!

83
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:32,161
This punk motherfucker
throwing shit at us.

84
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:34,393
l smell something, man.

85
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:36,561
l definitely smell something.

86
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:39,572
l smell pussy!

87
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:41,836
-He's a pussy, man!
-Kick his ass!

88
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:47,640
How you like that, boy?

89
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,147
Do it, do it!

90
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:53,082
Go, go, go!

91
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,948
Wait, wait. OK, now!

92
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:01,993
OK, fellas!

93
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:08,257
What you got to say now, punk?

94
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,134
Your Shaolin technique
is very good.

95
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:14,299
He thinks we're joking--

96
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,411
Homeboy, you all right, man?
lt's over?

97
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:21,777
Kid, we had your back.

98
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:24,648
Yeah, way back.

99
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:25,844
Damn.

100
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,986
l'm sorry l almost hit
Mr. Wilson with the Jell-O...

101
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:34,482
but Stab called my mother a ho.

102
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:36,688
You see, my mother's dead.

103
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,960
l'm very sorry about
your mother, Christopher...

104
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:43,696
but you can't fight because you
have a chip on your shoulder.

105
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:47,797
You're a good student,
so go back to class.

106
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:50,605
But your father
will have to be notified.

107
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,146
As for you, young man...

108
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,377
l'm tired of seeing you
in this office.

109
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,578
Could you tell me
why in God's name...

110
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:01,644
you called his mother
a garden tool?

111
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:08,289
How mad could he be?

112
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:11,794
Maybe the school
didn't even call him.

113
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:55,533
l'm so glad you're home.

114
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:57,941
Sit down. l need to talk to you.

115
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:01,410
What's up, Pop?

116
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:04,143
l'm making some Dick Gregory.
You want some?

117
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:06,208
No, thanks, Pop.

118
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:08,686
You know l need this stuff, boy.

119
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:11,315
l got a weight problem.
Can't wait to eat.

120
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:15,453
Pop, are these the only...

121
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:18,123
pieces of mail you got today?

122
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:20,826
Just some bills.
You want to pay them?

123
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:26,437
What?

124
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:31,467
Bila? Bilyle?

125
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:34,344
Whatever your name is,
what you want?

126
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,677
lt's for you.

127
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,444
l'll take it upstairs.

128
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:43,219
Why they name that boy
that African name?

129
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:44,746
They from Cleveland.

130
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:48,753
Yo, what's up?

131
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:50,922
Kid, have you talked to Play?

132
00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:53,831
l been calling his house.
Nobody answers.

133
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,993
He was supposed
to come pick me up.

134
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:57,593
l haven't spoke to him.

135
00:10:57,637 --> 00:10:59,901
l'm really sweating
this pink slip from school.

136
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:02,066
lf Pops finds out l got
in trouble in school today...

137
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:03,837
l'm definitely gonna be
on punishment.

138
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:05,867
You're still
worrying about that?

139
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,506
lf you ain't got a letter yet...

140
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:10,948
then they'll call
your house after 5:00.

141
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:13,384
That's when they expect
your parents to be home.

142
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:15,683
Shit. What do l do?

143
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:19,385
Just leave and don't come back
till after the party.

144
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:21,325
l still got to get dressed.

145
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:23,329
l can't come
to the set stinking.

146
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:26,059
Throw some Brut on
and meet me at the party.

147
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:29,762
Chris, get off the phone
and come down here.

148
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:31,793
l got to jet.
l'll see you tonight.

149
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:33,237
All right, man. Peace.

150
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:39,639
Don't tie up the telephone
talking to your friends.

151
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,113
l'm expecting a call
for some overtime.

152
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:43,581
OK, Pop.

153
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:46,881
There's a party
at Play--Peter's house.

154
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,319
-Can l go?
-On a school night?

155
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:52,017
l'll make sure l'm back
before curfew.

156
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:55,152
Oh, man.
l had plans for us tonight.

157
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:58,027
l rented a couple of videos.
"Dolemite."

158
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:01,864
You like "Dolemite."
You grew up on it.

159
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:06,831
All right.
lf you got to, you got to.

160
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:09,842
But after you finish
your homework.

161
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:11,741
No problem, Pop.

162
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:15,077
What's wrong with you?
Don't like "Dolemite"?

163
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:17,708
"Way down in the jungle deep...

164
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,277
"bad-ass lion stepped on
the signifyin' monkey's feet."

165
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:53,809
Toe to toe,
Kid 'n Play is on a roll again

166
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:56,583
lt's only right that we
keep the crowd dancin'

167
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:58,852
Rhymes are dope,
the tempo is steady

168
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:01,223
You ready? Let's rip up
the floor like confetti

169
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,525
Y'all, l got a great
new album in the mail today.

170
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:07,931
Onyx Communications
and Hey Love Productions...

171
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,832
proudly present "Hey Love."

172
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:12,838
All the commercials
they showin' nowadays.

173
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:17,036
God. Every TV station.

174
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:22,503
Cut the television off,
comin' through the damn walls.

175
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:26,450
The incomparable Delfonics
and much, much more.

176
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:29,011
l got to get this fan fixed.

177
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:30,989
lt was so hot in here
last night...

178
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:34,117
l saw the devil
sittin' in the living room.

179
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:38,852
Shit. Niggers ain't gonna
break my mama's good stuff.

180
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:41,657
Let 'em fuck with this plastic.

181
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,307
What up?
Play Martin in the place to be.

182
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:58,647
The place to be
is my house an hour ago.

183
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:01,244
lf you want a D.J.,
stop smokin' that crack...

184
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:04,381
and drive your mother's
raggedy-ass Chevy over here!

185
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:07,551
Chill, man.
l'll jet over in one minute.

186
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:08,958
l don't like fooling
with you, man.

187
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:11,862
Come on now, Play!

188
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:13,388
All right!

189
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:16,628
l love you.

190
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:25,139
Kid, answer the door!

191
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,249
Answer the door.
l'll get the phone.

192
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:47,588
Yeah, what's up?

193
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:51,729
l sure was depending on
that overtime.

194
00:14:56,776 --> 00:15:00,109
Give me that letter.
Are you retarded?

195
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:02,239
No, l wasn't talking to you.

196
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:04,340
Crazy mophead boy of mine.

197
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:07,045
Ready to cut his hair off.

198
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:11,455
Look like a young tree stump
walkin' around here.

199
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,459
What's old James up to?

200
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:22,193
Let me call you back later.

201
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:24,226
l got somethin' to take care of.

202
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,869
Can you explain this?

203
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,401
He called Mom out a name.

204
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:36,142
Don't you think
it's been long enough?

205
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:40,175
l am sick of you using
your mother for an excuse.

206
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:42,449
l wasn't using her as an excuse.

207
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:44,752
Then why didn't you tell me
when you got home?

208
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,258
Why you try to hide it?

209
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:48,453
l didn't think it was important.

210
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:51,486
No? Your school thought
it was important.

211
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,125
You'll spend tonight thinking
about your priorities...

212
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:58,000
after you finish
your damn homework.

213
00:15:58,037 --> 00:15:59,902
You said
l could go to the party.

214
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:02,931
Them hoods you fought with
will be there...

215
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:05,239
and you don't need
no more trouble.

216
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:07,508
lt's not that type of crowd.

217
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:09,013
All my friends will be there.

218
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:12,677
l don't care if Marvin Gaye
will be there. You won't!

219
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:15,278
You don't know
how to act no way.

220
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:19,052
Last time, you didn't come in
till l went to work.

221
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:22,652
lf you let me go this time,
l'll be back before curfew.

222
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:26,358
lt'd be different
if Peter's parents were there.

223
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,264
l wouldn't mind you going.

224
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:32,169
But they ain't.
They work nights just like l do.

225
00:16:32,204 --> 00:16:35,264
Matter of fact,
them folks is out of town.

226
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:37,173
You kids think you slick,
don't you?

227
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:40,440
Every little step you take
will be around this bedroom.

228
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,709
Believe it.
You're not goin' nowhere.

229
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:45,683
You're gonna make me
a social misfit.

230
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:48,312
l'm tryin' to make you
a responsible person.

231
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:50,618
But l am responsible.

232
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,886
Listen, get your act together.

233
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:55,758
Keep your mind on them books
and off them gals.

234
00:16:55,795 --> 00:16:59,629
'Cause you will make
the same mistake l did.

235
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:07,971
Look, l'm sorry.

236
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:09,872
l'm sorry.
l shouldn't have said that.

237
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:11,740
l'm sorry.

238
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:17,705
l'm under a lot of pressure.
l'm sorry.

239
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,014
But you ain't goin'
to that damn party.

240
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:22,145
l don't give a damn
what you say.

241
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:27,356
That's why l hate messin'
with them.

242
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:04,486
We got to get going.
No time to waste.

243
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,795
Who's that in the car, Play?

244
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,199
That's a honey.
l know what you're thinking.

245
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:13,137
That ain't for you,
but there'll be a lot more.

246
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:15,470
We can't fit
a lot of equipment...

247
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:17,738
and three people
in that little-ass car!

248
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:21,577
You don't know how
to load things scientifically.

249
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:25,050
Leave it!
You're tearing my shit!

250
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:28,214
Don't!

251
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:30,654
Shit! What the--

252
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:35,083
Just leave it alone! Don't!

253
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:36,424
Play, leave it alone!

254
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:38,794
Just leave it! l'll do it!

255
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:39,923
Leave it alone!

256
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:43,332
Hey, l'm--Hey!

257
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:46,770
There it is. We got it.

258
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,740
Where am l supposed to sit?

259
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:51,538
Get out! She's gonna walk!

260
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:52,601
She's gonna walk!

261
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:54,943
Of course you can fit.
Try the other side.

262
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,447
You can get in right over--

263
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,247
Excuse me one minute.

264
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:00,411
Yes, baby?

265
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:02,182
l don't even appreciate
how you treatin' me.

266
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:03,347
l'm real sorry, baby.

267
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:05,755
l do appreciate
the way you look.

268
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,691
No. Don't touch me!

269
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:13,163
l'll tell you what.

270
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:16,225
l'll run this over to my crib
and be right back.

271
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:18,429
Be right back? Kiss my ass!

272
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:20,268
You gonna take
my equipment and leave me?

273
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:22,433
No! l ain't goin' for it!

274
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:23,806
What else can l do?

275
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:26,812
Kick that bitch to the curb
and let me ride.

276
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:27,870
l'm the D.J., man.

277
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:31,144
Who you callin' a bitch?
Your mama's a bitch.

278
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:34,346
-My mama ain't no bitch.
-lf l am, she is.

279
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:36,911
l'll kick your ass!
l'll fight a girl!

280
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:39,481
l know.
l seen a couple beat you.

281
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:41,254
l can't. lt would be cold.

282
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:43,989
Besides,
she's packed in real good.

283
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:46,293
Look, no.

284
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:49,893
You know what, man?
l fucked up today.

285
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:53,530
l owe you one,
and l'll be right back for you.

286
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:55,904
-No, you ain't.
-He's got nerve.

287
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:57,704
l'll kick both of your asses.

288
00:19:57,743 --> 00:20:02,339
Play, don't play.
Don't do that!

289
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:04,474
Don't drive off!

290
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:08,009
l'll say it calmly.
Maybe l was hollering.

291
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:09,782
Play, don't play.

292
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:11,119
l love you!

293
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:13,147
Play! Damn!

294
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,232
Hold on, man.
Somebody's at the door.

295
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:28,697
lt's Sidney.

296
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:30,709
Yeah, she's a trip.

297
00:20:30,743 --> 00:20:34,179
You know who she is.
You like her.

298
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:39,248
Go ahead and wait
in the living room...

299
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:40,616
with your big nose.

300
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:45,482
Punk. Hi, everybody.

301
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:49,221
No, man, l said 12:00.
l didn't say 8:00.

302
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:51,957
l ain't going
to no party at 8:00.

303
00:20:51,997 --> 00:20:55,228
-Sharane!
-l'm coming!

304
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:57,064
There'll be
fine women at the party.

305
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:58,194
Why bring a girl with you?

306
00:20:58,237 --> 00:21:01,798
The incomparable Delfonics
and much, much more.

307
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,936
This is a fantastic album.
Let me borrow it.

308
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:08,913
No, my brother.
You've got to buy your own.

309
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:10,939
Come on, girl.

310
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:13,144
l said l was coming.
You always rushin'.

311
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:15,278
Whazzup?

312
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:18,916
My nails are wet.
Let's go outside while they dry.

313
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:22,553
Leave her at home, man.
She's ugly.

314
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:24,529
l can't wait to do that dance.

315
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:26,292
You know the one we been doin'?

316
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:27,890
Wait, l'm comin' back out.

317
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:29,093
You move, you lose.

318
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:32,103
-Come on, Sharane.
-Bye.

319
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:36,435
She gets on my nerves.

320
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:38,443
l don't know
if l like my outfit.

321
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:40,206
Why? You matchin'.

322
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:42,110
l think l match too much.

323
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:47,380
l told you about them
Garanimal outfits from K-Mart.

324
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:49,887
Why you tryin' to dis me?

325
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:51,412
Want some Kool-Aid?

326
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:53,721
Peanut, bring us
two glasses of Kool-Aid.

327
00:21:55,894 --> 00:21:57,953
You know l'll ask you
to borrow that tomorrow.

328
00:21:57,997 --> 00:22:00,022
-There ain't no more.
-Make some.

329
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:01,623
l won't give it to you.

330
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,294
-Sharane!
-What?

331
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:06,065
-Grape or red?
-Red.

332
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:09,074
Peanut, fix me
some of that Dick Gregory.

333
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:11,674
Who's supposed to be there?

334
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,337
Play...

335
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:16,709
Dragon-breath Bilal.

336
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:19,775
And your man, Kid.

337
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:22,286
You go, girl. Yours.

338
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:25,188
Don't even try it!
That is your man!

339
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:27,158
l don't know why
you keep sweatin' him.

340
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:29,456
He got a cute thing happenin'.

341
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:31,122
He's just so young-actin'.

342
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:33,358
He needs to chill from hangin'
with his crew and grow up...

343
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:35,367
then maybe l'll give him some.

344
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:37,096
You ain't givin' nobody nothin'.

345
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:39,627
-Don't even try it!
-Watch.

346
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:42,106
And l'm gonna give you
details blow by blow.

347
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:43,301
l'm gonna get my coat.

348
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:46,311
OK. Bye, everybody.

349
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:47,505
Bye, Grandma.

350
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:52,808
You drink that, Peanut.
We out of here.

351
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:54,113
Look at all that sugar.

352
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:56,678
Just thinkin' about that stuff
makes my teeth hurt.

353
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:58,986
That's good, girl.
What you talkin' about?

354
00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:07,230
Way down in the jungle deep...

355
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:12,798
the lion stepped on
the signifyin' monkey's feet.

356
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:18,775
The monkey said,
"Motherfucker, can't you see?"

357
00:23:21,547 --> 00:23:25,677
"You're standin'
on my goddamn feet."

358
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,950
B-love, yo, bust it!

359
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:09,085
What's up, cuz?

360
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:12,120
Bet you thought l cut you,
but l came back as promised.

361
00:24:12,164 --> 00:24:13,995
l ain't goin'.

362
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:15,465
What do you mean
you ain't goin'?

363
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:17,059
Read my lips.

364
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:20,299
l've been waiting an hour
to tell you l'm not going.

365
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:22,068
You're just a little upset--

366
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:24,302
This is why
l don't D.J. for free.

367
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:26,743
'Cause niggers
don't be appreciating shit.

368
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:30,044
-l don't appreciate nothin'?
-No, you don't.

369
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:33,483
Man, take a look in that car.

370
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,114
There's too many for me
to handle.

371
00:24:37,156 --> 00:24:38,987
They all goin' to the party...

372
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:42,516
and all they asked was,
"Who's the D.J.?"

373
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:44,461
So l brought them over...

374
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:46,657
so you could jump-start
before the other brothers.

375
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:48,666
ls that supposed to convince me?

376
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:53,429
Ladies, B-love's in the house.

377
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:55,531
Dragon-breath.

378
00:24:55,574 --> 00:24:56,973
Who you talkin' to?

379
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:08,386
Look at this hair.
Eraserhead!

380
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,445
Where you going?

381
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:11,751
Why do you want to know?

382
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,884
We'll ask the questions,
you answer them.

383
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:16,019
Yes, sir.

384
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:19,519
Want to check him for lD?

385
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:20,827
We're out of doughnuts.

386
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:24,700
What? Jesus, let's go.

387
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,672
You watch yourself, understand?
'Cause we are.

388
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:37,748
Thank you, Cagney and Lacey.

389
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:45,418
Hey, what are you doing?

390
00:25:51,263 --> 00:25:52,730

00:25:52,764 --> 00:25:55,198
Roll it back!
Smash him ! Kill him !

392
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:57,725
Get him ! Get him !

393
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:15,318
Yeah, baby, yeah.

394
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,424
Whose pussy is this, baby? Who?

395
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:21,653
Whose pussy, baby?

396
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:22,853
Shit.

397
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:25,693
You fine motherfucker!
Oh, shit.

398
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:27,323
You fine motherfucker, you.

399
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:29,231
Come here! Give me that pussy!

400
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:33,466
Shit! Yeah. Right there.

401
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:35,632
Right there!

402
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:40,435
Let me see! Let me see!

403
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:43,448
Yes, baby! Right there!

404
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:47,782
Yes, baby! Yeah!

405
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:50,445
Oh, shit!

406
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:52,457
There he is--

407
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:56,092
What was that?

408
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,254
Jive motherfuckers!

409
00:26:57,296 --> 00:26:59,025
Stay away from
this motherfuckin' window!

410
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:01,992
Fuckin' peep-freaks.

411
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:15,940
Yo, wasn't that Kid?

412
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:18,643
Was it?

413
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:20,276
Ain't no room in here anyway.

414
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:24,255
That's cold. Hi.

415
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,190
Aw, man.

416
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:30,116
Oh, shit!

417
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:43,440
Here's another dusty one
for you dusties.

418
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:47,575
Hope you all got
your Medicaid together.

419
00:27:50,615 --> 00:27:51,741
Who's that?

420
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:54,479
Hey, Pops.
What they got you doing?

421
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,180
What's to it, man?

422
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:57,950
Playin' for
the elephant graveyard, man.

423
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,958
Dead tired. lt's a gig, man.

424
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:02,187
What you got
in the crate over there?

425
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:03,990
Some Platters, lnk Spots...

426
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:06,930
Mills Brothers, Count Basie,
Big Joe Turner.

427
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:10,298
Slap some of them old sides
on the turntable...

428
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:12,633
get a little scratchin'
and mixin' goin' on...

429
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:14,696
l'll grab the microphone,
and we can get busy.

430
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,866
Do that again.

431
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:17,135
You just grab...

432
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:33,850
Let's kick his--

433
00:28:33,892 --> 00:28:36,326
Chill. The punk is mine.

Kick it, Pops!

435
00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:46,000
One, two. One, two.

436
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:48,666
Hey, everybody,
my name is Kid.

437
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:50,402
How y'all feelin'?

438
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:53,036
Just throw your hands
in the air.

439
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:56,775
Just wave your hands in the air!
Come on!

440
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:59,147
Wave your hands in the air!
That's right.

441
00:29:02,054 --> 00:29:04,488
Throw your hands
in the air, all right?

442
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:06,115
Wave your hands in the air.

443
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:07,955
Throw, throw...

444
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:13,564
Oh, dear!

445
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:14,895
Get the hell back there!

446
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:20,033
You want to see how crazy l am?

447
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:21,767
What you lookin' at?

448
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:23,775
Yo, Mandingo,
leave the brother alone.

449
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:27,210
Sucker, you want
another part in your head?

450
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:30,009
Lighten up.

451
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:31,538
Yeah, l did it.

452
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,813
l might cry two tears
in a bucket. Fuck it.

453
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:35,046
Let's take it to the stage.

454
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:47,960
Sorry, sir.

455
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:08,243
Look, Officer,
it was just an accident.

456
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:10,186
We don't want to press charges.

457
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:12,588
They've been in
a few accidents this evening.

458
00:30:12,624 --> 00:30:14,148
l don't think you should
let this slide by.

459
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:16,990
They need discipline,
not solitary confinement.

460
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:19,428
That's true.

461
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:20,795
Thank you very much.

462
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:26,835
Too scared to make a statement.

463
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:29,102
-They're not gonna talk?
-Nope.

464
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:31,041
They're not gonna press charges?

465
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:38,710
You perpetrators
were very lucky tonight.

466
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,184
Apparently these people
aren't gonna press charges.

467
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:47,351
So you're gonna get up,
go home, and go to bed.

468
00:30:47,392 --> 00:30:48,757
But before you do...

469
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:52,989
l want you to repeat after me.

470
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:54,225
What?

471
00:30:54,266 --> 00:30:55,233
l am...

472
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:56,791
What?

473
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,337
l am !

474
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:00,395
Come on, with feeling.

475
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:02,167
l am...

476
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:03,572
somebody.

477
00:31:03,608 --> 00:31:05,132
somebody.

478
00:31:05,177 --> 00:31:07,111
Oh, really.

479
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:08,339
This is ridiculous.

480
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,680
That's good.
Now get up and go home.

481
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:15,584
Beat it! Hold it!

482
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,147
Let him go. You go that way.

483
00:31:19,191 --> 00:31:20,351
Shit!

484
00:31:46,785 --> 00:31:48,047
The place to be.

485
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:50,350
-Got some gum, man?
-No.

486
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:51,514
Groove!

487
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:52,682
What's up, Play?

488
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:54,521
Chill! Herman, man.

489
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,426
Make yourself at home.

490
00:31:57,462 --> 00:31:59,453
Too many hard-legs here.
Need more women.

491
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:11,499
LaDonna! How you doin', baby?

492
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:13,568
Lookin' real good.

493
00:32:13,612 --> 00:32:15,273
How about giving me
those digits?

494
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:17,941
Step off.

495
00:32:23,455 --> 00:32:27,551
Baby, l'm taking you places,
meetin' people.

496
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:31,157
-Clinton, homes.
-What's up, money?

497
00:32:31,196 --> 00:32:32,754
Glad you could make it.

498
00:32:32,797 --> 00:32:35,994
l want you
to meet my lady, um...

499
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:37,160
Benita.

500
00:32:37,202 --> 00:32:39,670
lt's a pleasure to meet you.

501
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:42,366
l hope l have the opportunity
of dancing with you later.

502
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:43,897
We'll see about that.

503
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:52,108
LaShay, how you doin'?

504
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,879
Don't you have any refreshments?

505
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:56,045
Some soda or potato chips?

506
00:32:56,087 --> 00:32:58,555
You should've got here earlier.
l had everything.

507
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,421
Liter bottles, potato chips,
the whole shebang.

508
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,153
Brothers went through it.

509
00:33:02,193 --> 00:33:05,526
l always get here
too late for the snacks.

510
00:33:05,563 --> 00:33:07,588
There's a store
right up the street.

511
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:09,600
Anything you want.
Help yourself.

512
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:12,603
Mama should have fed you
before you got here.

513
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:14,195
This ain't no soup kitchen.

514
00:33:19,077 --> 00:33:20,567
Yo, what's up, man?

515
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:21,943
What's up?

516
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,881
Glad you showed up.
What's with your pops?

517
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:27,612
How much more trouble
can l get into?

518
00:33:27,652 --> 00:33:29,142
A beat-down's a beat-down.

519
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:31,451
Let me announce you.

520
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:33,457
Y'all, look who fell
into the gig!

521
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:34,890
l got to go.
Make yourself at home.

522
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:36,655
Put my stuff in its spot.

523
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:37,889
You got it.

524
00:33:44,235 --> 00:33:45,532
What's up?

525
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:56,744
What up?

526
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:58,112
What up, B? How you livin'?

527
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:59,411
Coolin'.

528
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:01,385
Cover the labels.
Niggers can't bite your shit.

529
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,683
That's smooth.
You brought the mike?

530
00:34:03,722 --> 00:34:08,318
Yeah, but look, man,
it's for Play.

531
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,920
lt's his party.
Only he can rap.

532
00:34:10,962 --> 00:34:13,760
That mumble-mouth motherfucker?

533
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:15,766
l'm the one
with the dope lyrics.

534
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,461
l got to go
for mine tonight.

535
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:20,335
Fuck that.
Get my lyrics together.

536
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:23,239
Man.

537
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:27,203
Work, Sharane!

538
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:29,975
Where you at?

539
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:35,479
Go, girl!

540
00:35:18,062 --> 00:35:22,829
Chill, don't bump the table.
l appreciate it.

541
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:25,563
Play something l can dance to,
and l won't.

542
00:35:37,782 --> 00:35:40,342
Don't bump the table.
l'm tryin' to mix.

543
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:43,013
You call that mixin'?
l just helped you out.

544
00:35:43,054 --> 00:35:44,385
Thank you!

545
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:49,416
Next time l'm just
gonna fuck him up.

546
00:35:51,629 --> 00:35:53,119
What the...

547
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:01,901
What the hell's going on here?

548
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:06,501
Shut up all that damn noise!
This ain't "Soul Train"!

549
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:07,943
Where's Don Cornelius
with his stiff neck?

550
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:10,277
You shut up all that damn noise.

551
00:36:10,315 --> 00:36:12,340
l paid $15,000 for this house.

552
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:14,317
Who else is over there,
Public Enema?

553
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:15,979
What's his name?

554
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,716
What the hell
is a public enema anyway?

555
00:36:18,756 --> 00:36:19,882
Walter.

556
00:36:19,924 --> 00:36:22,552
Brother, you by yourself.
What's wrong?

557
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:24,585
Maybe that
big water head you got.

558
00:36:24,629 --> 00:36:27,689
Shut up all this damn noise!

559
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:29,199
Hey, baby.

560
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:31,293
You have got some nice ones.

561
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:34,933
Baby, shut up.
l'm just playing with the kids.

562
00:36:34,973 --> 00:36:37,464
You should find out
what she eatin'.

563
00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:39,841
Y'all shut the hell up

564
00:36:39,878 --> 00:36:42,005
l got something for you.

565
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:44,514
You stay right there.
Ain't this a bitch?

566
00:36:48,553 --> 00:36:50,043
What are you doing?

567
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:54,024
-Callin' the police.
-For what?

568
00:36:54,058 --> 00:36:57,186
They're driving me crazy
with this damn noise.

569
00:36:57,228 --> 00:37:00,197
You makin' all the noise.

570
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:02,131
l got the wrong number,
too, baby.

571
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,463
Hold on one second.

572
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:07,164
Dance now with your big ass.

573
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:10,606
911?

574
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:13,167
l'll hold.

575
00:37:18,883 --> 00:37:21,613
Scandalous!

576
00:37:25,723 --> 00:37:28,453
Sharane, man.
That girl is Nubian.

577
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:31,223
She's the finest girl in here.

578
00:37:31,262 --> 00:37:33,822
That ain't hard in here,
but still...

579
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:37,596
l'm getting those digits.

580
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:40,035
Don't play yourself.
You ain't got no rap.

581
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:41,902
She don't know that.

582
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:45,868
Sweet daddy!

583
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:52,007
Why you cock-blockin' me?

584
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,075
lt ain't like that.
We go way back.

585
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:55,779
l used to go with her
in third grade.

586
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,654
-l don't remember that.
-For three days.

587
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:01,522
Why you trippin'?

588
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,959
Just make sure we don't trip
on the dance floor.

589
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:37,322
Why these cops
keep sweatin' us, man?

590
00:38:37,362 --> 00:38:40,854
They always fuckin' with us.

591
00:38:44,802 --> 00:38:47,168
They're gone, man.

592
00:38:48,406 --> 00:38:49,532
Damn.

593
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:50,734
Look at us, fellas.

594
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:53,869
This is not right.
We're nervous and tense.

595
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:56,778
Cop cars follow us,
and we just go to pieces.

596
00:38:56,814 --> 00:38:58,975
-This ain't us!
-This ain't the way.

597
00:38:59,017 --> 00:39:00,882
l know there's a reason
behind all this.

598
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:02,579
And l know what the reason is.

599
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,214
All because of some faggot,
head-like-a-rocket...

600
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:08,487
stick-your-finger-in-a-socket,
punk motherfucker named Kid.

601
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:09,925
That's who l mean!

602
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:12,794
Ever since this fool
came into my life...

603
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,957
l can't do nothin'
but see him, man.

604
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:17,263
l'll be alone with
my woman sometimes...

605
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:19,701
damn near ready
to wax that ass...

606
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:21,967
and all l can do
is vision this fool.

607
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:25,032
-Word?
-Word.

608
00:39:25,076 --> 00:39:26,407
l don't know about that.

609
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:30,778
l know when it comes
to my dick action...

610
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:33,682
all l can think about
is the pussy.

611
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:36,687
He must have a mental block
or something.

612
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:38,746
Pee-Wee, you know what l mean.

613
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,953
-l was jokin'.
-l'll drop you like a bad cold.

614
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:44,154
Why don't you chill

615
00:39:44,195 --> 00:39:47,130
l'm gonna put a serious
bum-rush into effect...

616
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:49,133

We'll be housin' the party.

618
00:39:53,104 --> 00:39:55,664
We'll make it

619
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:58,699
-We be housin' shit.
-Word.

620
00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:01,337
Officer,
l spent $15,000 on my house.

621
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:04,177
l don't want no goddamn
Public Enema around here.

622
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:06,775
Yes, sir.

623
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:08,251
Shut up, old man!

624
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:11,119
Your asses are old.
Mr. So-and-so'll be right over.

625
00:40:11,155 --> 00:40:12,816
Just hold on one second.

626
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:16,418
4789. Come on over, God damn it!

627
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:17,985
What you mean,
don't curse at you?

628
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:20,554
You're cursin' at me!
Fuck you, too!

629
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:23,692
All that goddamn noise.

630
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:27,171
You wouldn't believe the skirt
this girl has got on.

631
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:30,504
lt's two inches above the thing.

632
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:46,382
Damn.

633
00:40:46,424 --> 00:40:51,157
Hi. Let's do this, girl.

634
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:56,658
The time is...

635
00:40:56,701 --> 00:40:58,601
l'm sorry.
l just finished dancing.

636
00:40:58,636 --> 00:41:02,766
Why girls be gettin' tired

637
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:05,571
lt's hot in here.
My hair is through.

638
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,602
Put some use
to them corns on your feet.

639
00:41:08,646 --> 00:41:10,409
Maybe later, OK?

640
00:41:10,448 --> 00:41:12,643
You done turned down
thirty brothers.

641
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:15,015
Don't make me walk
all the way back there...

642
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:17,213
after climbing from
around the D.J. table...

643
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:20,349
crossing the room,
obviously to ask you to dance.

644
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:22,757
l'll be the object of ridicule.

645
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:25,194
There's a lot of girls
not dancing.

646
00:41:25,229 --> 00:41:28,960
Want to know why?
Because they are homely.

647
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,094
They need to be home
getting beauty sleep.

648
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:34,934
What you think
they say about you?

649
00:41:34,972 --> 00:41:36,462
You heard something?

650
00:41:36,507 --> 00:41:38,737
Oh, no. Sharane!

651
00:41:43,381 --> 00:41:45,246
Kid, what's up?

652
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:47,683
-You enjoying yourself?
-Definitely.

653
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:49,083
l've known you too long.

654
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,953
What's that look in your eye?
Scheming on Sidney or Sharane?

655
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:53,513
Actually, l had my eye--

656
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:57,358
Sidney's for you.
Sharane wants me.

657
00:41:57,395 --> 00:41:58,726
-She does?
-Every day.

658
00:41:58,763 --> 00:42:00,628
Besides, with your father...

659
00:42:00,665 --> 00:42:02,792
you can't deal
with no project girl.

660
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:05,701
You gonna ill out on a girl
from the projects?

661
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:07,260
You got it wrong.

662
00:42:07,305 --> 00:42:09,603
With a father like yours,
you have no privacy...

663
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,838
no car, and no money
for a motel.

664
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:15,846
You see my point?

665
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,007
With a project girl,
someone's always home...

666
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:20,449
and that's gonna mess
with your datin' time.

667
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:22,247
Mating time.
Know what l'm saying?

668
00:42:22,286 --> 00:42:25,255
How's it look watching
television with Uncle Fester?

669
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:27,223
-lt's Uncle Otis.
-Whatever.

670
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:29,522
But Sidney has a home.

671
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,892
A house with a rec room.

672
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:35,262
You know what time it is.
Go downstairs.

673
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:37,790
Sofa bed. You're in.

674
00:42:37,835 --> 00:42:40,497
-Why you playin' me?
-l'm not--

675
00:42:40,538 --> 00:42:42,597
Just 'cause you don't have
nice stuff at your crib...

676
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,665
don't mess with my mother's.

677
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:51,846
Your liver gonna
shrivel up like a prune.

678
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:53,214
lt's hot.

679
00:42:55,152 --> 00:42:58,417
Become a man, come on.
Some of this.

680
00:42:58,456 --> 00:43:00,583
No, man. You better
slow down yourself.

681
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:02,718
That monkey oil
is gonna mess you up good.

682
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,250
l tried to tell him.

683
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:05,922
Kid, you my man...

684
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:08,454
but l tell you
you'll be out on the sauce...

685
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:10,296
if you're not down with this.

686
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:12,802
This stuff makes your dick hard.

687
00:43:12,837 --> 00:43:15,965
l'm talking cock-diesel, baby.

688
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:21,572
Do that dance step
you was doin' out there.

689
00:43:21,612 --> 00:43:24,046
l've been trying to get
that all night.

690
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:26,879
-l don't feel like it.
-Come on!

691
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:28,977
l'm really not in the mood.

692
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,420
Don't do it, then.
l'll learn on my own.

693
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,219
Wait a minute.
Don't give up so easy.

694
00:43:34,258 --> 00:43:36,385
l knew you wouldn't
go out on me.

695
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:37,917
l'll teach you.

696
00:43:37,962 --> 00:43:39,452
Cool, man.

697
00:43:39,497 --> 00:43:41,897
This is very complicated.

698
00:43:49,774 --> 00:43:53,141
-What are you doing?
-This ain't aerobics class.

699
00:43:53,177 --> 00:43:54,508
You can't do it.

700
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:56,843
-ls that a challenge?
-lt is.

701
00:43:56,881 --> 00:43:59,577
-You better come on out here.
-Come on.

702
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:03,178
And look, drunk.

703
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,415
-Shall we do this?
-Let's do it.

704
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:27,439
Don't be movin' me.

705
00:45:22,867 --> 00:45:24,698
They went to
the Rerun dance school.

706
00:45:24,735 --> 00:45:27,135
Go ahead. What you got?

707
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,989
Switch!

708
00:46:06,911 --> 00:46:08,071
Switch!

709
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:14,981
Switch!

710
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:27,824
Bilal, switch again!

711
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:31,396
Come on, man, switch!

712
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:05,902
Did you see how Kid
was all up on me?

713
00:47:05,936 --> 00:47:07,062
On you?

714
00:47:07,104 --> 00:47:10,267
He was so far up on me,
l could not move.

715
00:47:10,307 --> 00:47:14,107
Wait a minute.
You said he was young-actin'.

716
00:47:14,145 --> 00:47:16,204
l did. l also said he was cute.

717
00:47:18,782 --> 00:47:19,771
Switch!

718
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:25,311
l do everything l can for him,
and he don't come home.

719
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:27,256
He must be crazy.

720
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:29,350
He don't pay no bills
around this house.

721
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:32,362
l'll give him another minute,
and that's it.

722
00:47:39,703 --> 00:47:41,796
What's wrong with this watch?

723
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:46,403
Minute don't take
that damn long.

724
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:49,378
Shit. l know where he's at.

725
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:57,084
l'll kill him when l see him.

726
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:58,850
l should have never married
that white woman.

727
00:47:58,889 --> 00:48:00,015
Hold it right there.

728
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:01,217
Shit.

729
00:48:03,627 --> 00:48:05,390
Where are you going?

730
00:48:05,429 --> 00:48:07,556
l'm minding my fuckin' business.

731
00:48:07,598 --> 00:48:09,657
Do you have a problem with that?

732
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,634
Again with the questions.

733
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:13,261
What is this, "Jeopardy"?

734
00:48:13,304 --> 00:48:16,364
lt ain't "Jeopardy,"
or Monopoly, either...

735
00:48:16,407 --> 00:48:17,840
and l ain't going to jail.

736
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:21,276
-Freeze!
-God damn.

737
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:23,280
Y'all sound like
a set of bookends.

738
00:48:23,314 --> 00:48:26,977
Put your hands
on top of your head.

739
00:48:31,322 --> 00:48:32,414
Lean back.

740
00:48:32,456 --> 00:48:35,186
l know why you stopped me.

741
00:48:35,226 --> 00:48:39,185
'Cause l'm a poor black man
in a black neighborhood...

742
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,664
and y'all just want
to bust my black ass.

743
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:44,099
-No.
-You look suspicious.

744
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:45,601
Ain't that a bitch?

745
00:48:45,636 --> 00:48:48,469
You look suspicious
and definitely black.

746
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:49,870
Turn around.

747
00:48:49,907 --> 00:48:51,169
Your wife likes it.

748
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:55,406
We're responding to a 415
in the neighborhood.

749
00:48:55,446 --> 00:48:58,040
You could be coming
from that disturbance.

750
00:48:58,082 --> 00:49:01,483
The only fuckin' disturbance
is you fuckin' with me.

751
00:49:01,518 --> 00:49:04,544
Don't think l can't read
no badge numbers, chump.

752
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:07,955
Boyd and Warnarski.
l'll turn your ass in.

753
00:49:07,992 --> 00:49:09,289
That's enough, OK?

754
00:49:10,327 --> 00:49:11,453
Watch your attitude, pal.

755
00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:13,463
-Ain't that a bitch?
-Go home.

756
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:17,797
Fuck you.
Officers of the goddamn law.

757
00:49:17,835 --> 00:49:21,896
-Go.
-l'm not ready.

758
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:23,998
Go on home, pal.

759
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,599
You don't know
who you fucking with.

760
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:28,305
l'm from a small town called
"Fresh Off A Cop's Ass."

761
00:49:28,345 --> 00:49:30,643
You make me homesick.

762
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:34,139
l'll find that damn boy.
Head like a whisk broom.

763
00:49:34,385 --> 00:49:39,220
Sharane and Sidney,
the two finest women in here.

764
00:49:39,256 --> 00:49:40,518
How could a man choose?

765
00:49:40,557 --> 00:49:41,785
He better choose right.

766
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:44,055
lt's like that?

767
00:49:46,397 --> 00:49:47,864
Sharane, you are crazy.

768
00:49:47,898 --> 00:49:49,729
l really like that outfit
you got on.

769
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:50,961
lt likes you, too.

770
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:54,630
-And you got the boots.
-You like my boots?

771
00:49:54,672 --> 00:49:57,106
Look at your hair.
lt looks so nice.

772
00:49:57,141 --> 00:49:58,438
You got the braid
and everything.

773
00:49:58,475 --> 00:49:59,601
That's my jam !

774
00:49:59,643 --> 00:50:01,110
Check out this mix, boy.

775
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:02,635
Yo, Sharane.

776
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,375
Dope.

777
00:50:06,717 --> 00:50:07,684
Yo, baby.

778
00:50:07,718 --> 00:50:09,310
Let's do it, darling.

779
00:50:09,353 --> 00:50:11,253
Want to dance, baby?

780
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:12,619
Damn.

781
00:50:17,061 --> 00:50:19,495
-Like to dance?
-No.

782
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,362
You sure
you don't want to dance?

783
00:50:25,402 --> 00:50:26,926
l'm quite sure.

784
00:50:28,205 --> 00:50:30,673
Can l sit down?

785
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:33,108
lt's a free country.

786
00:50:36,513 --> 00:50:39,311
When l saw you
turn that other guy down...

787
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,979
l knew that the odds
were against me.

788
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,612
Don't take it personal.

789
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:49,490
l didn't take it personal
when you asked me after Sharane.

790
00:50:55,399 --> 00:50:58,061
What's your middle name?

791
00:50:58,102 --> 00:50:59,592
LaToya.

792
00:51:01,739 --> 00:51:06,039
Sidney. That's a nice name.

793
00:51:06,076 --> 00:51:07,805
You sure
you don't want to dance?

794
00:51:07,845 --> 00:51:10,040
l'm still tired. My feet.

795
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,411
Your feet.

796
00:51:11,448 --> 00:51:14,349
Your mother should
buy you a bigger shoe size.

797
00:51:14,385 --> 00:51:15,409
That would help.

798
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,257
That outfit you got on
is really nice.

799
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:24,556
-Pierre Cardin?
-No.

800
00:51:24,595 --> 00:51:27,257
l knew it wasn't Pierre Cardin.

801
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:30,391
All right, fellas,
it's time to go to work.

802
00:51:34,772 --> 00:51:37,434
You sure you don't want
to dance?

803
00:51:39,443 --> 00:51:41,138
Maybe on a fast song.

804
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:44,272
l'm really not into slow songs.

805
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:48,317
-Whazzup?
-You want to dance?

806
00:51:48,352 --> 00:51:52,254
Can't you see
l'm talking to my girl?

807
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:55,622
l should have sat out
the last one like you did.

808
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:56,887
l'm about to die.

809
00:51:56,927 --> 00:51:59,521
-Ready to go yet?
-What's wrong?

810
00:51:59,563 --> 00:52:01,622
You can't go until
you give me what you owe me.

811
00:52:01,665 --> 00:52:05,123
-Owe?
-Just a dance.

812
00:52:05,169 --> 00:52:07,262
lt's late. We're ready to go.

813
00:52:07,304 --> 00:52:09,534
Let's just dance right now.

814
00:52:09,573 --> 00:52:11,404
l usually don't dance
on slow records...

815
00:52:11,442 --> 00:52:13,842
but l will
if you won't grind on me.

816
00:52:13,877 --> 00:52:16,744
Come on.

817
00:52:17,848 --> 00:52:19,577
Don't be feelin' on my butt.

818
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:34,589
You so soft and comfy,
like my Hush Puppies.

819
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:39,432
You so warm and fluffy
like a buttermilk biscuit.

820
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:41,370
Shoot.

821
00:52:41,405 --> 00:52:47,207
You make me want to squeeze
tighter and tighter.

822
00:52:47,244 --> 00:52:49,576
l ain't gonna lie.

823
00:52:49,613 --> 00:52:51,808
You make a motherfucker
want to sing.

824
00:52:53,317 --> 00:52:57,310
Always and forever

825
00:52:58,222 --> 00:53:02,124
Each moment with you

826
00:53:02,759 --> 00:53:08,129
ls just like
a dream to me and you

827
00:53:08,165 --> 00:53:12,192
That somehow came true

828
00:53:38,962 --> 00:53:40,759
Honeys. Oh, yes.

829
00:53:40,797 --> 00:53:43,163
Yo, fellas!

830
00:53:44,735 --> 00:53:46,430
lt's cool.

831
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:47,767
What's the problem?

832
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:51,103
No problem.
No hoods allowed at my party.

833
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:53,132
-Hoods?
-That's right.

834
00:53:53,176 --> 00:53:55,144
Why don't y'all
go rob a liquor store?

835
00:53:55,178 --> 00:53:56,475
Why don't you quit playin'?

836
00:53:56,513 --> 00:53:59,607
lf l'd known you were coming,
l'd have had metal detectors.

837
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,949
-That shit is real funny.
-Real funny.

838
00:54:02,986 --> 00:54:04,248
Don't touch my body, man.

839
00:54:04,288 --> 00:54:07,314
Big man. Don't touch his body.

840
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:10,952
Look at that.
Bunch of punk motherfuckers.

841
00:54:10,994 --> 00:54:12,552
You smell something?

842
00:54:12,596 --> 00:54:14,791
l definitely smell
something out here.

843
00:54:14,831 --> 00:54:17,698
l smell pussies!

844
00:54:17,734 --> 00:54:19,463
Forget this, man.

845
00:54:19,503 --> 00:54:21,095
Forget all these chumps.

846
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,203
We would smell like pussies
to a bunch of dicks!

847
00:54:26,243 --> 00:54:27,301
Shit!

848
00:54:27,344 --> 00:54:30,643
lt's cool. Forget this, man.

849
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:33,741
l don't want to hang out
with this sucker set.

850
00:54:33,784 --> 00:54:37,242
What l'd like to do
is hurt that punk Kid.

851
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:39,585
lf you was a real man,
you'd come out here...

852
00:54:39,623 --> 00:54:41,147
and we'd squash this!

853
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:42,522
That's right, punk!

854
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,754
Get him when he's alone.
l told you.

855
00:54:44,795 --> 00:54:46,126
Too many people around, man.

856
00:54:46,163 --> 00:54:49,462
l'd really love to come
out and play with you...

857
00:54:49,499 --> 00:54:53,196
but l'm busy right now
with your girl on my lap.

858
00:54:53,236 --> 00:54:54,635
Shit!

859
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:57,265
Your shoulder OK?

860
00:54:57,307 --> 00:54:59,798
Fuck this, man.

861
00:55:02,879 --> 00:55:04,938
We can't let them
get away with that.

862
00:55:04,982 --> 00:55:06,210
See what happened?

863
00:55:06,249 --> 00:55:08,979
We ought to go back
and kick some ass.

864
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:11,715
We just got dissed
by some punk motherfuckers?

865
00:55:11,755 --> 00:55:13,620
We got dissed
by some motherfuckers.

866
00:55:13,657 --> 00:55:16,251
ln front of their girls.

867
00:55:16,293 --> 00:55:20,024
l ain't goin' out like that.

868
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,964
Cool.
Finally, a program l'm with.

869
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,865
Whatever this is, l'm with it.

870
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:27,937
l hear that.

871
00:55:27,971 --> 00:55:31,304
We bust their ass as they
run out of the burning house.

872
00:55:31,341 --> 00:55:32,774
Let's get moving.

873
00:55:32,809 --> 00:55:34,970
Burning house?

874
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:37,037
Hold up for a second.

875
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,208
l was talking about
kicking some ass...

876
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,512
not burning people up.

877
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:43,041
Now you're going too far.

878
00:55:43,086 --> 00:55:45,680
Y'all frontin' on me?

879
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:49,055
Wait. Do l smell pussy?

880
00:55:49,092 --> 00:55:50,821
l ain't no pussy.

881
00:55:50,861 --> 00:55:53,523
Shut up! Squash that!
Come on!

882
00:55:53,563 --> 00:55:54,825
What's wrong with him?

883
00:55:54,865 --> 00:55:56,457
Come on!

884
00:55:58,068 --> 00:55:59,592
What's the matter with you?

885
00:55:59,636 --> 00:56:01,866
Why you want to burn people up?

886
00:56:01,905 --> 00:56:03,896
Come on, come on.

887
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:06,302
What's up with the mike?

888
00:56:06,343 --> 00:56:08,368
Easy! Thank you.

889
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:10,380
Play and Kid got an urge...

890
00:56:10,414 --> 00:56:13,008
to make a fool
of themselves in public.

891
00:56:14,451 --> 00:56:16,112
Hey, wait a minute, baby.

892
00:56:16,153 --> 00:56:18,280
Let me show you how
to hold a piece of steel.

893
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:20,846
-Scared of you.
-You should be.

894
00:56:20,891 --> 00:56:23,257
-Go on.
-l will.

895
00:56:24,494 --> 00:56:26,621
One, two. One, two.

896
00:56:26,663 --> 00:56:28,392
Give me a little volume
on this microphone.

897
00:56:28,432 --> 00:56:29,524
Let's get this party jumping.

898
00:56:29,566 --> 00:56:31,830
All the ladies, all the ladies

899
00:56:31,868 --> 00:56:34,428
All the ladies
in the house say ow

900
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:36,736
Say ow

901
00:56:37,407 --> 00:56:38,965
Come on, come on

902
00:56:39,009 --> 00:56:40,271
Homeboys, make some noise

903
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:42,437
l said, homeboys,
make some noise

904
00:56:42,479 --> 00:56:44,447
Let me hear you say ho

905
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:46,643
Say ho, ho

906
00:56:47,718 --> 00:56:49,310
The roof, the roof

907
00:56:49,352 --> 00:56:51,877
Y'all like that
old prehistoric stuff?

908
00:56:51,922 --> 00:56:53,514
We don't need no water

909
00:56:53,557 --> 00:56:55,218
Let the motherfucker burn

910
00:56:55,258 --> 00:56:57,590
-Say what?
-Burn, motherfucker!

911
00:56:57,627 --> 00:56:59,925
l don't believe this.

912
00:56:59,963 --> 00:57:01,692
Didn't the Sugarhill Gang
do that rap?

913
00:57:01,732 --> 00:57:04,257
The roof is on fire

914
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:05,700
We don't need no water

915
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:07,670
Let the motherfucker burn

916
00:57:14,978 --> 00:57:17,776
Who got a light?

917
00:57:17,814 --> 00:57:19,247
How about a Bud Light?

918
00:57:19,282 --> 00:57:22,615
-Shit.
-Get in there.

919
00:57:24,654 --> 00:57:26,121
Shit.

920
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:34,219
Fuck you toy cops, man.

921
00:57:34,264 --> 00:57:37,791
-Don't call it in.
-Why not?

922
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:40,598
Why bother with the paperwork?
We can handle this shit.

923
00:57:40,637 --> 00:57:42,502
What do you got in mind?

924
00:57:42,539 --> 00:57:44,473
Let's take them
down to the docks.

925
00:57:44,508 --> 00:57:46,169
Nobody can hear them scream.

926
00:57:46,209 --> 00:57:47,369
Shit!

927
00:57:48,345 --> 00:57:50,040
lt's the P-L-A-Y

928
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,377
Just here to say hi

929
00:57:51,414 --> 00:57:53,678
Asking you may l
tell you about the day l

930
00:57:53,717 --> 00:57:56,345
Picked up a microphone,
a pad, and a pen?

931
00:57:56,386 --> 00:57:57,876
The legend
of the champ begins

932
00:57:57,921 --> 00:57:59,286
The party host with the most

933
00:57:59,322 --> 00:58:00,653
Giving you a dose, see?

934
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,419
Leaving instructions,
so listen closely

935
00:58:02,459 --> 00:58:03,585
Two lines forming

936
00:58:03,627 --> 00:58:04,992
Make sure you step soon

937
00:58:05,028 --> 00:58:06,996
Fellas at the back door,
girls by the bedroom

938
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:09,362
The name is Play,
don't dare play me cheap

939
00:58:09,399 --> 00:58:10,696
The microphone is a broom

940
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:12,292
And l'm going
to sweep you off your feet

941
00:58:12,335 --> 00:58:14,303
With feelings
that you never felt

942
00:58:14,337 --> 00:58:15,497
Another notch in the belt

943
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:16,801
lt's no secret

944
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,603
l like to freak
with the best of them

945
00:58:18,642 --> 00:58:20,769
Then head to the stage
in a test of men

946
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:23,507
And when it's done and said
and said and done

947
00:58:23,547 --> 00:58:25,742
Play's gonna be
the victorious one

948
00:58:27,818 --> 00:58:30,116
Dope, ain't it?
l know.

949
00:58:30,153 --> 00:58:32,485
-Give me that mike.
-You want some?

950
00:58:32,522 --> 00:58:33,784
lt's my turn.

951
00:58:33,824 --> 00:58:35,086
l'm never 'fessin',
possessin' the tools

952
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:36,387
That it takes to rock

953
00:58:36,426 --> 00:58:38,894
l think it's time
for the new kid on the block

954
00:58:38,929 --> 00:58:40,920
With a style that's wild,
yet so unique

955
00:58:40,964 --> 00:58:42,955
l can't be stopped
from reachin' my peak

956
00:58:42,999 --> 00:58:45,467
Because givin' my all,
that's how l got to live

957
00:58:45,502 --> 00:58:47,527
lt's my prerogative,
so you know l gotta give

958
00:58:47,571 --> 00:58:49,732
More for the dance floor,
and l'll make your brain sore

959
00:58:49,773 --> 00:58:51,798
Kid's revvin' and buzzin'
just like a chain saw

960
00:58:51,842 --> 00:58:54,709
One look, you'll say, damn, man,
that Kid needs a grand, man

961
00:58:54,744 --> 00:58:56,302
'Cause l bust a handstand
on "American Bandstand"

962
00:58:56,346 --> 00:58:59,076
With ease, l please
and make your mind freeze

963
00:58:59,115 --> 00:59:00,912
Straight out the Eighties,
right into the Nineties

964
00:59:00,951 --> 00:59:03,419
Givin' you the highs
and lows like a drama

965
00:59:03,453 --> 00:59:06,047
And if the mike's got juice,
you know, l'm a-keep wailin'

966
00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:07,579
You know l'll have you
starin' a while

967
00:59:07,624 --> 00:59:10,593
Because the Kid's much more
than hair and a smile

968
00:59:12,562 --> 00:59:14,154
There it is, the hype shit.

969
00:59:14,197 --> 00:59:16,392
You think you all that now?

970
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:17,764
Yup. And then some.

971
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:19,063
Bust it.

972
00:59:19,102 --> 00:59:21,195
lt's my party,
and l rhyme if l want to

973
00:59:21,238 --> 00:59:23,604
Be careful and don't you
step to the front to

974
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,972
Dis, 'cause l'm gonna
dismiss with a def kiss

975
00:59:26,009 --> 00:59:28,000
And make you sorry that
you ever stepped to this

976
00:59:28,044 --> 00:59:30,535
Microphone wizard,
so come on, place your bet

977
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:32,605
ls it gonna be me or Eraserhead?

978
00:59:32,649 --> 00:59:34,913
Why put your money
on a sorry old poor thing

979
00:59:34,951 --> 00:59:36,680
When you can get behind
a sure thing?

980
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,280
And that's me, the capital "P"
on the hype tip

981
00:59:39,322 --> 00:59:41,654
One false move, and you'll
get your ass whipped

982
00:59:41,691 --> 00:59:43,591
Just tell me how the rhymes
and the cuts sound

983
00:59:43,627 --> 00:59:45,788
You won't start feelin' the pain
till you touch ground

984
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:48,423
Boy, you goin' way out,
l'm ready to serve you

985
00:59:48,465 --> 00:59:50,399
lf you can stay out
past your Pop's curfew

986
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:52,298
Look at him,
already a has-been

987
00:59:52,335 --> 00:59:55,065
Let Uncle Play say a rhyme
that'll tuck your ass in

988
00:59:57,807 --> 00:59:59,274
Am l paid or what?

989
00:59:59,309 --> 01:00:02,472
You some kind of foul,
you know what l'm saying?

990
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:05,640
Once again, the boy blows smoke
about what he want to be

991
01:00:05,682 --> 01:00:08,378
But it isn't and wasn't,
and it ain't never gonna be

992
01:00:08,418 --> 01:00:10,443
Possible,
'cause l got lots of pull

993
01:00:10,487 --> 01:00:12,785
And when you rhyme,
whoo, there's lots of bull

994
01:00:12,822 --> 01:00:14,221
When it comes time
to step to a mike

995
01:00:14,257 --> 01:00:15,519
l don't sit around

996
01:00:15,558 --> 01:00:16,957
Play, you know
l don't kid around

997
01:00:16,993 --> 01:00:19,427
So come with it, boy,
don't even hide your best

998
01:00:19,462 --> 01:00:21,794
'Cause Kid spelled backwards
describes you best

999
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:24,095
Look around, watch the people
clap hands in unity

1000
01:00:24,134 --> 01:00:26,261
As the momentum
swings from you to me

1001
01:00:26,303 --> 01:00:28,737
You issued a challenge,
yeah, you threw it up

1002
01:00:28,772 --> 01:00:30,933
Step to the stage,
too late, l blew it up

1003
01:00:30,974 --> 01:00:33,169
The knowledge to build,
just filled with excellence

1004
01:00:33,209 --> 01:00:35,336
You heard the rhymes,
you've been petro ever since

1005
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:37,676
There's no missin'
the words that l laid out

1006
01:00:37,714 --> 01:00:39,545
You didn't play,
you just got played out

1007
01:00:46,256 --> 01:00:48,952
Anything y'all could do,
l also could do...

1008
01:00:48,992 --> 01:00:50,823
but l could also do it better.

1009
01:01:08,979 --> 01:01:10,469
What the...

1010
01:01:14,484 --> 01:01:18,079
Oh, baby.
The police been here...

1011
01:01:18,121 --> 01:01:21,352
and they still
down there dancing.

1012
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:24,918
Come back to bed, Harry.

1013
01:01:24,961 --> 01:01:26,553
Harry?

1014
01:01:28,765 --> 01:01:30,858
What's up? Enjoying yourselves?

1015
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:34,598
Damn, Groove...

1016
01:01:34,637 --> 01:01:37,629
why you got to play
the alky role at my party?

1017
01:01:47,183 --> 01:01:49,447
Man, l told you
to go way over there.

1018
01:01:49,486 --> 01:01:50,612
You bump this table again...

1019
01:01:50,653 --> 01:01:54,214
l'm going to kick
your fucking heart out.

1020
01:01:54,257 --> 01:01:56,157
l've been looking
all over for you.

1021
01:01:56,192 --> 01:01:57,523
Help me haul this fool home.

1022
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,221
You're doing a great job.

1023
01:01:59,262 --> 01:02:00,854
Why you hang out
with that sucker?

1024
01:02:00,897 --> 01:02:03,195
That ain't important.
This is.

1025
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:04,495
Would you help me
haul this fool home?

1026
01:02:04,534 --> 01:02:07,628
l told you don't invite him.

1027
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:11,106
Groove! Get up, man.

1028
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:12,130
Let me go, man.

1029
01:02:12,175 --> 01:02:15,872
The turf! Excuse me!

1030
01:02:15,912 --> 01:02:18,881
Watch your back!
Groove might throw up!

1031
01:02:18,915 --> 01:02:22,282
We're ready to go home.
Want to come?

1032
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:27,051
OK. My pops wants me home
by 11:00, anyway.

1033
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:29,456
-11:00?
-Not 11:00.

1034
01:02:29,492 --> 01:02:31,858
11:30, 11:35.

1035
01:02:31,895 --> 01:02:33,863
Did you see where Play went?

1036
01:02:33,897 --> 01:02:36,161
l saw Chill and Play
carrying Groove home.

1037
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,762
He promised us a ride home.

1038
01:02:39,803 --> 01:02:41,794
l don't mind walking you home.

1039
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:43,567
lt's not as good
as a ride, but...

1040
01:02:43,606 --> 01:02:47,167
Cool. l think Sidney's
ready to leave anyway.

1041
01:02:48,978 --> 01:02:51,037
Kid said he'll walk us home.

1042
01:02:51,081 --> 01:02:54,107
We'll go get his coat
and your purse.

1043
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:58,143
Aren't you going
to wait for Play?

1044
01:02:58,188 --> 01:03:00,748
Don't be up there all night.

1045
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:03,054
Kids got it easy nowadays.

1046
01:03:03,093 --> 01:03:04,492
My father said,
"Stay your ass at home..."

1047
01:03:04,527 --> 01:03:07,291
you stayed your ass at home.

1048
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,662
Wait till l find him.
l'm going to kill him !

1049
01:03:17,107 --> 01:03:18,540
You're drunk as a fish.

1050
01:03:18,575 --> 01:03:20,509
Come tomorrow,
you the first one in church.

1051
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:22,101
Who said something about church?

1052
01:03:22,145 --> 01:03:23,806
l see the light

1053
01:03:23,847 --> 01:03:25,678
l see the light

1054
01:03:35,191 --> 01:03:38,092
l don't want to see nobody.
Let's go.

1055
01:03:43,066 --> 01:03:45,557
James, is that you?

1056
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:56,809
-My boy here?
-No, sir. Who's he?

1057
01:03:56,846 --> 01:03:58,473
You know who he is.

1058
01:03:58,515 --> 01:04:00,506
-He in here?
-No.

1059
01:04:03,753 --> 01:04:06,847
You ought to be ashamed,
messin' up these folks' house.

1060
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:08,118
Know it ain't paid for.

1061
01:04:08,158 --> 01:04:11,719
Y'all in here doing some wrong!

1062
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:14,730
Bilal--whatever your name is.

1063
01:04:14,764 --> 01:04:16,823
Sounds like something
you catch on your feet.

1064
01:04:16,866 --> 01:04:18,197
You seen my boy?

1065
01:04:18,234 --> 01:04:19,496
l haven't seen him, sir.

1066
01:04:19,536 --> 01:04:23,836
You sure?
You ain't seen him?

1067
01:04:23,873 --> 01:04:26,103
Why don't you go home
and watch the late show, Pops?

1068
01:04:28,244 --> 01:04:32,578
Why don't you go home,
little test-tube baby?

1069
01:04:33,716 --> 01:04:35,843
-What's your name?
-Clinton.

1070
01:04:35,885 --> 01:04:39,616
-Clinton what?
-Clinton X.

1071
01:04:41,758 --> 01:04:42,884
Clinton X?

1072
01:04:42,926 --> 01:04:45,588
Yeah, Clinton x.
l'm a Muslim.

1073
01:04:45,628 --> 01:04:49,689
Get me two bean pies
and a pork chop sandwich...

1074
01:04:49,732 --> 01:04:52,530
you little
trout-mouthed heathen.

1075
01:04:52,569 --> 01:04:54,628
Oh, how you doing?

1076
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:56,969
l should've known you was here.
Saw the drippings outside.

1077
01:04:57,006 --> 01:05:00,601
With your Jheri-Curl,
better never do a crime.

1078
01:05:00,643 --> 01:05:02,907
The police would have
no problem finding you.

1079
01:05:02,946 --> 01:05:04,709
Follow the drip.

1080
01:05:04,747 --> 01:05:06,612
No problem finding you.

1081
01:05:06,649 --> 01:05:08,776
Bilal, where's the boy at?
Upstairs?

1082
01:05:11,721 --> 01:05:13,279
ls the boy upstairs?

1083
01:05:13,323 --> 01:05:15,484
Wait!

1084
01:05:15,525 --> 01:05:18,323
Play told me to make sure
nobody went upstairs...

1085
01:05:18,361 --> 01:05:21,125
'cause his parents
just got new carpet.

1086
01:05:21,164 --> 01:05:24,258
And he don't want nobody
with shit on their shoes--

1087
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,269
-Did l say "shit"?
-You did.

1088
01:05:27,303 --> 01:05:29,271
You talking about my shoes?

1089
01:05:29,305 --> 01:05:32,206
No. Nobody can
walk around up there.

1090
01:05:32,242 --> 01:05:35,075
l understand.
So nobody been up there?

1091
01:05:35,111 --> 01:05:36,976
Ain't nobody up there.
l don't play.

1092
01:05:37,013 --> 01:05:39,777
l don't play, either.

1093
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:42,546
l ain't got time to play games
with you damn kids.

1094
01:05:42,585 --> 01:05:45,019
He got to come home sometime.

1095
01:05:45,054 --> 01:05:47,181
l'll be waiting
on his monkey ass.

1096
01:05:47,223 --> 01:05:48,952
Get out of the damn way.

1097
01:05:48,992 --> 01:05:52,120
l'll be like a security guard,
waiting for him.

1098
01:05:52,161 --> 01:05:54,459
Get out of my way.

1099
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,558
Look.

1100
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:01,035
Just make yourself at home.

1101
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:03,095
What's Play's mama
doing with this dress?

1102
01:06:03,139 --> 01:06:05,607
She ought to give this to me.

1103
01:06:05,642 --> 01:06:07,906
lt does look kind of nice.

1104
01:06:07,944 --> 01:06:10,003
Let me help you
with that dress, huh?

1105
01:06:10,046 --> 01:06:12,480
What do you think?

1106
01:06:12,515 --> 01:06:14,608
Hold. What you doing?

1107
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:16,209
Helping you with the dress.

1108
01:06:16,252 --> 01:06:18,117
You got to take things
slow at first.

1109
01:06:18,154 --> 01:06:20,349
-Kid, your--
-What?

1110
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:23,951
Nothing. l just came
to get my pocketbook.

1111
01:06:23,993 --> 01:06:25,927
We was about to get it.

1112
01:06:25,962 --> 01:06:27,122
And now we're not.

1113
01:06:27,163 --> 01:06:29,927
Now l know
it's time for us to go.

1114
01:06:29,966 --> 01:06:31,661
Let's go out the back way.

1115
01:06:31,701 --> 01:06:36,832
l told Play l'd help clean up.
l don't want to run into him.

1116
01:06:36,873 --> 01:06:42,038
You'd run into a lot more
than Play out front.

1117
01:06:42,612 --> 01:06:46,207
What are you doing on Friday?

1118
01:06:46,249 --> 01:06:50,117
l don't know.
Why don't you call me tomorrow?

1119
01:06:50,153 --> 01:06:53,816
A lot of guys get nervous
in the projects.

1120
01:06:53,856 --> 01:06:56,017
Why would they be punks
like that?

1121
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:59,927
After Mr. Williams' son started
sniping people from the roof...

1122
01:06:59,962 --> 01:07:03,363
guys drop me off on the corner
and tell me to call them.

1123
01:07:07,403 --> 01:07:10,167
l shouldn't make plans
for this weekend.

1124
01:07:10,206 --> 01:07:12,231
lt depends if my father
lets me off punishment...

1125
01:07:12,275 --> 01:07:14,300
for getting into
that fight at school.

1126
01:07:14,344 --> 01:07:16,539
Friday may not be
good for me, either.

1127
01:07:16,579 --> 01:07:20,071
We'll talk tomorrow in school.

1128
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:32,653
-Come on, now.
-Don't beg.

1129
01:07:33,963 --> 01:07:35,123
Later.

1130
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,428
Good night.

1131
01:07:49,245 --> 01:07:51,805
l'll be back.

1132
01:08:09,165 --> 01:08:11,156
Do l detect jealousy?

1133
01:08:12,201 --> 01:08:15,637
Why tease him?
"Let's get together Friday."

1134
01:08:15,671 --> 01:08:17,502
Didn't you say
the same shit to Play?

1135
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:20,065
One's in trouble,
the other one's available.

1136
01:08:20,109 --> 01:08:21,201
l'm just playing averages.

1137
01:08:21,244 --> 01:08:22,905
They're friends!

1138
01:08:22,945 --> 01:08:25,539
Cute ones always travel
in packs.

1139
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:28,516
But why is old ugly Bilal
with his breath...

1140
01:08:28,551 --> 01:08:30,382
hanging out with them?

1141
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,752
l can't believe
you're acting like this.

1142
01:08:32,789 --> 01:08:35,053
What?

1143
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:38,355
Let me tell you something.
Life is short.

1144
01:08:38,394 --> 01:08:40,954
lf you want something,
let the chips fall.

1145
01:08:40,997 --> 01:08:42,988
You're mad because
you didn't catch one.

1146
01:08:43,032 --> 01:08:45,125
That may not be by accident.

1147
01:08:45,168 --> 01:08:49,036
You didn't like him
till he was up on me.

1148
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:51,562
That is bullshit.
He was up on me first.

1149
01:08:51,607 --> 01:08:55,338
Why you think
l didn't talk to him...

1150
01:08:55,378 --> 01:08:57,209
even though l knew
you were playing him?

1151
01:08:57,246 --> 01:08:59,578
Then you put him
all up in my face.

1152
01:08:59,615 --> 01:09:01,947
l'm out of here.
l don't want to hear it.

1153
01:09:02,952 --> 01:09:05,819
He's still got
to walk you home, right?

1154
01:09:05,855 --> 01:09:08,085
lf you think l'm dogging him,
try and take him.

1155
01:09:08,124 --> 01:09:11,150
-l ain't like you.
-That's why you're mad.

1156
01:09:11,194 --> 01:09:13,685
-Ho.
-l heard you.

1157
01:09:19,502 --> 01:09:20,992
What's wrong?

1158
01:09:21,037 --> 01:09:24,029
You don't have to walk me home.

1159
01:09:24,073 --> 01:09:26,974
-l don't mind.
-l kind of do mind.

1160
01:09:27,009 --> 01:09:30,672
You beefed at me all night.
What did l do to you?

1161
01:09:30,713 --> 01:09:33,409
You didn't do anything.

1162
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:35,610
lt's just l want to be alone.

1163
01:09:35,651 --> 01:09:37,448
l don't think
that's a good idea...

1164
01:09:37,487 --> 01:09:40,786
so l'm going to bug you
all the way home.

1165
01:09:40,823 --> 01:09:43,257
You should be
heading home yourself.

1166
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:45,522
Why? l'm already in trouble.

1167
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:48,655
Might as well have fun now
and suffer later.

1168
01:09:48,698 --> 01:09:50,757
l can only die once.

1169
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,098
Yeah, but punishments
are forever.

1170
01:09:53,135 --> 01:09:54,796
That's true.

1171
01:09:54,837 --> 01:09:57,806
One time my father put me
on punishment for a month...

1172
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,899
because l came home late
from a party.

1173
01:09:59,942 --> 01:10:01,773
l still get depressed
thinking about that.

1174
01:10:01,811 --> 01:10:05,110
Think about it
when the time comes.

1175
01:10:05,147 --> 01:10:10,881
My pops is cool,
but he's too overprotective.

1176
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,287
l heard about your mom's
passing. l'm sorry.

1177
01:10:14,323 --> 01:10:18,521
Yeah. That was a while ago.

1178
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:21,223
What do your folks do?

1179
01:10:21,264 --> 01:10:23,528
My dad owns
a couple of grocery stores.

1180
01:10:23,566 --> 01:10:27,024
l know y'all
been snacking down.

1181
01:10:27,069 --> 01:10:30,061
Crazy chips and dips.

1182
01:10:30,106 --> 01:10:32,870
My mom works in a bank
in bookkeeping.

1183
01:10:32,909 --> 01:10:35,002
At least you got a job
when you graduate.

1184
01:10:35,044 --> 01:10:36,705
But l'm going to college.

1185
01:10:36,746 --> 01:10:37,940
So am l.

1186
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:40,278
l already started checking out
the applications.

1187
01:10:40,316 --> 01:10:43,945
Really? Aren't those
applications confusing?

1188
01:10:43,986 --> 01:10:46,511
Especially
those lvy League schools.

1189
01:10:46,556 --> 01:10:49,252
l ain't getting
all that far yet...

1190
01:10:49,292 --> 01:10:52,022
lvy League
or nothing like that.

1191
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:55,723
What's up, fellas?

1192
01:10:55,765 --> 01:10:58,256
You didn't take all the women
while we were gone?

1193
01:10:58,301 --> 01:11:01,327
-A few.
-Right.

1194
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:04,897
-Someone is living foul.
-This nigger here.

1195
01:11:04,941 --> 01:11:06,340
Take care of that, please.

1196
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:08,138
Did y'all two watch
the stuff like l asked?

1197
01:11:08,177 --> 01:11:09,405
Because if a brother
like Play get vict...

1198
01:11:09,445 --> 01:11:11,845
l'll have to do
some body and fender work.

1199
01:11:11,881 --> 01:11:14,179
There was some niggers
clocking your shit.

1200
01:11:14,216 --> 01:11:16,377
Was they clocking it as hard
as you should be clocking...

1201
01:11:16,419 --> 01:11:18,478
them bugs dropping
out of your hair?

1202
01:11:19,589 --> 01:11:20,783
Nigger got hair like Bob.

1203
01:11:20,823 --> 01:11:23,485
-Bob who?
-Bob Wire, motherfucker.

1204
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:25,460
Real funny, man.

1205
01:11:25,494 --> 01:11:28,395
You're crazy.

1206
01:11:28,431 --> 01:11:29,796
Who broke the toilet?

1207
01:11:31,601 --> 01:11:32,659
l don't know.

1208
01:11:32,702 --> 01:11:36,103
Don't play me like this.
Who broke the toilet?

1209
01:11:36,138 --> 01:11:39,232
lt was like that
when l came in here, wasn't it?

1210
01:11:39,275 --> 01:11:40,936
Bet it was that nigger
in the leather jacket.

1211
01:11:40,977 --> 01:11:43,468
-He could shit some bricks.
-Neck like Mike Tyson.

1212
01:11:43,512 --> 01:11:45,639
"Play, when's your next party?"

1213
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:47,911
l put you in my house,
and you dog me.

1214
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:50,111
Look at the log
in that motherfucker.

1215
01:11:50,152 --> 01:11:52,552
l got to do something
before my mother gets back.

1216
01:11:52,588 --> 01:11:55,216
l'd help you, man,
but l got my new kicks on.

1217
01:11:55,257 --> 01:11:57,122
See the next time
l throw a party!

1218
01:11:57,159 --> 01:11:58,285
l'm sorry, man.

1219
01:11:58,327 --> 01:12:00,488
l'm out of here.

1220
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:03,521
Y'all out of here?
l got a better idea.

1221
01:12:03,566 --> 01:12:04,965
Bust it. Party's over.

1222
01:12:05,001 --> 01:12:06,468
What?

1223
01:12:06,502 --> 01:12:08,470
Don't say nothing to me, man.

1224
01:12:08,504 --> 01:12:11,473
When you see me in the streets,
don't say nothing.

1225
01:12:11,507 --> 01:12:12,667
l ain't no plumber.

1226
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:14,198
Step!

1227
01:12:14,243 --> 01:12:15,437
l didn't even piss.

1228
01:12:15,478 --> 01:12:18,538
-That's cold.
-Just step.

1229
01:12:18,581 --> 01:12:20,139
-Peace, man.
-Damn.

1230
01:12:24,186 --> 01:12:25,312
Shit!

1231
01:12:25,588 --> 01:12:27,146
Hold up, OK?

1232
01:12:29,892 --> 01:12:32,690
Good. l beat them home.

1233
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:36,721
You girls scheme on a level
guys don't have a clue about.

1234
01:12:39,135 --> 01:12:43,003
l'm glad you let me
walk you home.

1235
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:44,631
You're all right.

1236
01:12:44,674 --> 01:12:47,666
You pretty chill your damn self.

1237
01:12:49,178 --> 01:12:50,167
Did you kiss her?

1238
01:12:51,647 --> 01:12:52,807
Did l kiss who?

1239
01:12:54,617 --> 01:12:56,915
Tonight. Did you kiss Sharane?

1240
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:59,317
No, l didn't.

1241
01:13:01,323 --> 01:13:02,551
But you wanted to.

1242
01:13:02,591 --> 01:13:05,526
Well...

1243
01:13:05,561 --> 01:13:07,222
But l didn't.

1244
01:13:07,263 --> 01:13:09,424
And l didn't know her
the way l know you now.

1245
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:18,063
OK, so l'll see you later,
all right?

1246
01:13:20,176 --> 01:13:21,336
Tomorrow.

1247
01:13:23,179 --> 01:13:27,411
l would let you in
and everything, but...

1248
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:31,250
it's late,
and you got to get home...

1249
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:34,347
and my parents
will be here any minute.

1250
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:36,483
l understand completely.

1251
01:13:36,525 --> 01:13:38,550
lt's not a problem.

1252
01:14:15,264 --> 01:14:16,993
Kid, wait.

1253
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:19,926
What?

1254
01:14:19,969 --> 01:14:21,436
What are we doing here?

1255
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:23,734
We were doing fine
until you stopped me.

1256
01:14:23,773 --> 01:14:25,502
A few minutes ago...

1257
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,839
you were trying to make
a date with my best friend.

1258
01:14:27,877 --> 01:14:29,003
This isn't right.

1259
01:14:29,044 --> 01:14:30,568
lt's not right?

1260
01:14:30,613 --> 01:14:31,910
l'll tell you what's not right--

1261
01:14:31,947 --> 01:14:34,438
the way you keep fronting on me.

1262
01:14:34,483 --> 01:14:38,112
So all you want is sex,
even from best friends?

1263
01:14:38,154 --> 01:14:40,054
l ain't forcing you
to do nothing.

1264
01:14:40,089 --> 01:14:43,058
lf you want me to leave, fine.

1265
01:14:43,092 --> 01:14:45,322
No problem.

1266
01:14:45,361 --> 01:14:48,262
Wait, wait, wait.
Sidney, wait up.

1267
01:14:48,297 --> 01:14:50,162
What is it you're asking me?

1268
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:53,930
l'm not asking for anything.
lt's about what you want.

1269
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:58,570
This is a trick question, right?

1270
01:15:01,443 --> 01:15:03,775
l ain't going to lie.

1271
01:15:03,813 --> 01:15:05,144
l'm attracted to both of you...

1272
01:15:05,181 --> 01:15:07,149
but if l have
to make a choice...

1273
01:15:07,183 --> 01:15:08,650
and that seems to be
what you're asking--

1274
01:15:08,684 --> 01:15:11,380
then you're
who l want as a friend.

1275
01:15:16,892 --> 01:15:18,951
lf you go with someone...

1276
01:15:18,994 --> 01:15:20,928
you should be friends
as well as lovers.

1277
01:15:35,211 --> 01:15:38,874
So now that we're friends...

1278
01:15:39,882 --> 01:15:41,406
let's get with the loving.

1279
01:15:46,522 --> 01:15:48,046
You think you slick, huh?

1280
01:15:49,859 --> 01:15:52,327
Now l have a question for you.

1281
01:15:52,361 --> 01:15:53,623
What?

1282
01:15:53,662 --> 01:15:55,527
Are you on the pill?

1283
01:15:55,564 --> 01:15:58,692
No. l don't do this regular.

1284
01:15:58,734 --> 01:16:01,498
What about
one of those diagrams?

1285
01:16:01,537 --> 01:16:05,166
That's diaphragm,
and l don't do sponges, either.

1286
01:16:05,207 --> 01:16:08,904
Don't you have a whatchamacallit
in your wallet?

1287
01:16:13,883 --> 01:16:16,147
l knew this would come in handy.

1288
01:16:16,185 --> 01:16:19,052
lt's been in here a while.

1289
01:16:19,088 --> 01:16:20,851
Still good.

1290
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,960
All right.

1291
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:37,032
l guess it's been in here
a little too long.

1292
01:16:37,072 --> 01:16:38,562
So, now what?

1293
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:42,768
Have you ever...

1294
01:16:42,811 --> 01:16:44,574
No, l never, no.

1295
01:16:45,614 --> 01:16:47,741
l don't know why l asked that.

1296
01:16:47,783 --> 01:16:49,580
l don't even know why
l asked about birth control.

1297
01:16:49,618 --> 01:16:52,485
Most guys wouldn't care
if you had it or not.

1298
01:16:52,521 --> 01:16:56,457
That's why l like you.
There'll be other times.

1299
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:59,017
lt'll probably be
a long time from now.

1300
01:17:04,533 --> 01:17:07,195
Sorry, Kid.

1301
01:17:07,236 --> 01:17:11,297
That's what they call me.
"Sorry Kid."

1302
01:17:13,709 --> 01:17:15,734
That's not what l call you.

1303
01:17:23,719 --> 01:17:25,016
Get out of the way!

1304
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:32,087
What are you doing?

1305
01:17:32,127 --> 01:17:34,027
l'm supposed to be
in my bedclothes.

1306
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:35,860
l don't know
whether to watch or run.

1307
01:17:35,898 --> 01:17:37,331
Hurry up.

1308
01:17:37,366 --> 01:17:41,302
l don't know how those hoodlums
got into the party.

1309
01:17:41,337 --> 01:17:42,895
You should've pressed charges.

1310
01:17:42,938 --> 01:17:45,372
Not with those
fascist cops there.

1311
01:17:45,407 --> 01:17:47,341
lf l'd met that hoodlum
in the street, man to boy...

1312
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:49,901
l'd punch him
in his snot locker.

1313
01:17:49,945 --> 01:17:53,437
You know l don't like
to be sucker-punched.

1314
01:17:53,482 --> 01:17:55,814
You've tried it
a couple of times.

1315
01:17:59,722 --> 01:18:02,156
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1316
01:18:02,191 --> 01:18:05,251
-How am l supposed to get out?
-Back door!

1317
01:18:26,515 --> 01:18:27,743
Mama?

1318
01:18:27,783 --> 01:18:30,581
Sidney, you're awake.

1319
01:18:33,889 --> 01:18:36,585
l decided to stay home
after all.

1320
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:39,116
That's my little baby.

1321
01:18:39,161 --> 01:18:43,257
Our little pumpkin
stayed home all by herself.

1322
01:18:55,344 --> 01:18:57,278
-ls that Princess?
-l'll see.

1323
01:18:59,214 --> 01:19:01,341
lt's probably nothing.
See? lt stopped.

1324
01:19:03,318 --> 01:19:05,786
l'm sleepy.
l'm going to go to bed now.

1325
01:19:13,429 --> 01:19:15,761
My back!

1326
01:19:15,798 --> 01:19:17,766
Those cops are always
fucking with--

1327
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,893
My stomach.

1328
01:19:19,935 --> 01:19:22,597
Shut up.
He hit us all the same way.

1329
01:19:22,638 --> 01:19:25,698
l'm tired of gettin'
beat by punk cops, man.

1330
01:19:25,741 --> 01:19:28,266
Pee-Wee,
how does your ribs feel?

1331
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:30,870
They fucked me up the same way
they fucked you up.

1332
01:19:30,913 --> 01:19:32,744
Yo, look!

1333
01:19:32,781 --> 01:19:35,113
Oh, yeah.

1334
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:37,243
After gettin'
beat down by them cops...

1335
01:19:37,286 --> 01:19:39,186
l'm ready to whip
somebody's ass.

1336
01:19:39,221 --> 01:19:41,155
Where you goin', longhair?
Come here!

1337
01:19:45,694 --> 01:19:47,559
Let "Hey Love..."

1338
01:19:47,596 --> 01:19:49,120
Oh, my God!

1339
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:51,632
The classic sounds of sexy soul.

1340
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:54,431
Look at my hand again,
you'll be like that man...

1341
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:57,598
Get some chicken, baby!

1342
01:19:57,639 --> 01:20:01,541
There goes
that broomhead albino!

1343
01:20:01,577 --> 01:20:06,480
Get that motherfucker now!
Get him now!

1344
01:20:09,651 --> 01:20:13,109
Get him ! Come on!

1345
01:20:13,155 --> 01:20:15,487
Fuckin' rat!

1346
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:17,253
Get off me, man!

1347
01:20:18,293 --> 01:20:21,228
Oh, shit!

1348
01:20:21,263 --> 01:20:22,423
Come on.

1349
01:20:30,839 --> 01:20:32,500
What happened to homey's shoe?

1350
01:20:45,554 --> 01:20:46,782
Freeze!

1351
01:20:51,527 --> 01:20:56,931
Aw, shit! Shit!

1352
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,867
Who's gonna explain that?

1353
01:21:19,988 --> 01:21:21,979
What the fuck you lookin' at?

1354
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:30,892
So this is how you got
that Buckwheat fade.

1355
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:33,561
You stick your head
in the icebox, right?

1356
01:21:33,602 --> 01:21:35,399
l hear you're a rapper.

1357
01:21:35,437 --> 01:21:37,564
l got a rap for your ass.

1358
01:21:37,606 --> 01:21:40,268
You run around town
like a faggot in heat

1359
01:21:40,309 --> 01:21:42,277
Me and my boys can't be beat

1360
01:21:42,311 --> 01:21:44,871
Wherever you go,
we can smell you like gas

1361
01:21:44,913 --> 01:21:47,609
And we're gonna kick
your fuckin' ass

1362
01:21:47,649 --> 01:21:50,516
You got your silly ass
locked in the icebox

1363
01:21:50,552 --> 01:21:52,850
With nowhere to go

1364
01:21:52,888 --> 01:21:55,379
What we should really do
is take this refrigerator...

1365
01:21:55,424 --> 01:21:56,948
and just dump that shit
in the river.

1366
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:59,153
You ain't thinkin'.
Where's your head at?

1367
01:21:59,194 --> 01:22:00,752
Leave me the fuck alone.

1368
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:02,423
Freeze, Negroes.

1369
01:22:02,464 --> 01:22:04,398
Hey, let me out!

1370
01:22:04,433 --> 01:22:06,924
This is your lucky day.

1371
01:22:07,135 --> 01:22:10,593
lt was a jammin' party.

1372
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:13,733
There you go, there you go.

1373
01:22:13,775 --> 01:22:16,801
-l got to talk to you.
-Tell me tomorrow.

1374
01:22:16,845 --> 01:22:19,712
l'm sorry, Ev.

1375
01:22:19,748 --> 01:22:23,081
The brothers
keep fucking with me.

1376
01:22:23,118 --> 01:22:26,246
You were real cool with me.
Always remember that.

1377
01:22:26,288 --> 01:22:27,482
But Kid's dad--

1378
01:22:27,522 --> 01:22:30,457
What the hell happened to Kid?
He was supposed to help.

1379
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:31,857
l thought he was down.

1380
01:22:31,893 --> 01:22:33,326
Peace out.

1381
01:23:09,197 --> 01:23:10,892
Yo, move over, man.

1382
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:15,033
Move! Move!

1383
01:23:25,213 --> 01:23:27,704
We've been
going at this all day...

1384
01:23:27,749 --> 01:23:29,273
since earlier in the lunchroom.

1385
01:23:29,318 --> 01:23:31,183
lt hasn't gotten us
anywhere but in here...

1386
01:23:31,219 --> 01:23:32,550
which is where
we don't want to be.

1387
01:23:32,587 --> 01:23:35,021
Why don't we let
bygones be bygones...

1388
01:23:35,057 --> 01:23:38,515
and work together
to get out of here?

1389
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:39,891
What do you say?

1390
01:23:41,196 --> 01:23:43,494
Man, fuck you.

1391
01:23:48,103 --> 01:23:51,698
Looks like l'm in here
for a couple of more days.

1392
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:53,708
So how's everything
out on the street?

1393
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:56,176
You taking care of my business?

1394
01:24:00,782 --> 01:24:01,840
What the--

1395
01:24:01,883 --> 01:24:04,579
l know the party's not over yet.

1396
01:24:04,619 --> 01:24:05,984
Think so?

1397
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:10,414
That was wrong.

1398
01:24:13,228 --> 01:24:15,196
Play in full effect.
What up?

1399
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:17,755
Play, this is Kid.
l'm in prison.

1400
01:24:17,799 --> 01:24:19,323
Right, at your house.

1401
01:24:19,368 --> 01:24:22,030
No, l'm not at home.
l'm in jail for real.

1402
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:24,971
l need you to bail me out.
Anybody there to borrow from?

1403
01:24:25,006 --> 01:24:27,304
Just Bilal,
packing up his equipment.

1404
01:24:27,342 --> 01:24:29,105
Brothers ain't got no money.

1405
01:24:29,144 --> 01:24:31,874
Hurry, man.
My back's against the wall.

1406
01:24:31,913 --> 01:24:35,713
Just give me a minute.
We'll be right there.

1407
01:24:35,751 --> 01:24:37,742
Just do me a favor.
Don't pick up the soap.

1408
01:24:37,786 --> 01:24:40,084
Like l need you to tell me that.

1409
01:24:40,122 --> 01:24:42,090
That's why you can't
be on C.P.T.

1410
01:24:42,124 --> 01:24:44,718
l need you
on Japanese people time.

1411
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,785
l'm depending on you.
Are you gonna come down?

1412
01:24:46,828 --> 01:24:48,125
-All right.
-l'm serious.

1413
01:24:48,163 --> 01:24:49,596
All right!

1414
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:50,791
All right, bye.

1415
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:02,669
-How much we got?
-What?

1416
01:25:02,711 --> 01:25:04,042
How much do we have?

1417
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:07,071
Don't holler at me, man.
l'm telling you.

1418
01:25:08,483 --> 01:25:10,348
Think they'll take a check?

1419
01:25:10,385 --> 01:25:14,082
Shit. l got to collect
from the bums at my party.

1420
01:25:14,122 --> 01:25:17,751
Think they'll give you money
after you kicked them out?

1421
01:25:17,793 --> 01:25:21,490
lt's the least they can do
after breaking my toilet.

1422
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:24,988
How about the girls
who left earlier with Kid?

1423
01:25:35,677 --> 01:25:36,974
Boy, are you crazy?

1424
01:25:37,012 --> 01:25:39,572
Kid's in jail.
We need your help.

1425
01:25:39,614 --> 01:25:41,673
-Jail?
-Yeah.

1426
01:25:41,716 --> 01:25:43,684
l should get in trouble
'cause he did?

1427
01:25:43,718 --> 01:25:45,185
He didn't do nothing wrong.

1428
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:48,280
We're his friends.
All we need is bail money.

1429
01:25:48,323 --> 01:25:51,315
Bail money? He got a daddy.

1430
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:52,986
His daddy'll kick his ass.

1431
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:56,122
Should've thought of that
before he did what he did.

1432
01:25:56,164 --> 01:25:59,497
He is my boy and all, but damn.

1433
01:26:10,545 --> 01:26:12,672
Shit!

1434
01:26:23,291 --> 01:26:25,350
Why you try and leave me?

1435
01:26:25,393 --> 01:26:26,519
l saw you running like hell.

1436
01:26:26,561 --> 01:26:28,859
No sense of both of us
getting our asses kicked.

1437
01:26:28,897 --> 01:26:30,660
Man, that's fucked up.

1438
01:26:30,699 --> 01:26:32,860
-Did you get the money?
-No. She trippin'.

1439
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:36,166
That's the problem when l send
a boy to do a man's job.

1440
01:26:36,204 --> 01:26:40,368
A boy?
Think you can do any better?

1441
01:26:42,477 --> 01:26:45,378
Look, nigger, l--Hi, Play.

1442
01:26:45,413 --> 01:26:48,541
Hi. l know you ain't in bed.

1443
01:26:48,583 --> 01:26:50,346
The party ain't over yet.

1444
01:26:50,385 --> 01:26:52,376
After we go get Kid,
we're going to Burger King.

1445
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:54,388
Burger King?

1446
01:26:54,422 --> 01:26:56,583
A little bite to eat.
Hang out a little while.

1447
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:58,217
lt's kind of late.

1448
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:00,228
Come on, for me.

1449
01:27:02,864 --> 01:27:04,092
Wait out front.

1450
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:07,063
Don't forget your purse.

1451
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:09,396
Hey, Daisy.

1452
01:27:09,437 --> 01:27:12,668
Heard you got quite
a reputation at your school.

1453
01:27:12,707 --> 01:27:13,867
Sweetest meat around.

1454
01:27:13,909 --> 01:27:17,572
When we get finished,
you gonna be even sweeter.

1455
01:27:17,612 --> 01:27:21,912
Know what this man did?
Tell him, Hatchett.

1456
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:25,477
l cut a man's heart out.

1457
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,181
Check that out.

1458
01:27:27,222 --> 01:27:29,190
Tell him what you did, Rock.

1459
01:27:29,224 --> 01:27:32,990
l beat a police sergeant,
with his own club.

1460
01:27:33,028 --> 01:27:35,019
And didn't run after he did it.

1461
01:27:35,063 --> 01:27:37,031
Hell, no.

1462
01:27:37,065 --> 01:27:38,794
What did you do?

1463
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:41,563
l used to run
a day-care center.

1464
01:27:42,604 --> 01:27:45,095
l called Sidney.
She wants to come with us.

1465
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,573
l told her we'd pick her up.

1466
01:27:46,608 --> 01:27:51,011
You got a couple of girlfriends
l can meet?

1467
01:27:51,046 --> 01:27:53,913
Has anybody ever told you
your breath stinks?

1468
01:27:53,949 --> 01:27:55,246
Damn!

1469
01:27:55,283 --> 01:27:57,308
-Fuck you!
-What?

1470
01:27:57,352 --> 01:27:58,546
You heard. Fuck you!

1471
01:27:58,587 --> 01:28:00,248
You mad 'cause
you still a virgin.

1472
01:28:00,288 --> 01:28:02,256
l ain't no virgin.
l got a girlfriend.

1473
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:04,349
She just don't live
around here, right?

1474
01:28:04,392 --> 01:28:05,654
Dragon-breath.

1475
01:28:05,694 --> 01:28:07,628
Hey, don't hit me.

1476
01:28:07,662 --> 01:28:09,129
You got dragon-breath.

1477
01:28:09,164 --> 01:28:11,189
Your shit is a little tart, too.

1478
01:28:11,232 --> 01:28:12,358
Nigger, please.

1479
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,391
-Belch.
-Shut up.

1480
01:28:14,436 --> 01:28:16,097
That's what l thought.

1481
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:35,248
l got something to tell you.

1482
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:36,587
-You got juice?
-Yes.

1483
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:37,887
Tell me.

1484
01:28:39,995 --> 01:28:41,292
This l know.

1485
01:28:43,898 --> 01:28:45,195
l don't believe you.

1486
01:28:45,233 --> 01:28:47,428
What?

1487
01:28:51,272 --> 01:28:53,297
That's right. So don't get mad.

1488
01:28:55,577 --> 01:28:57,010
l ain't trippin'.

1489
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:59,777
You go, girl.

1490
01:28:59,814 --> 01:29:01,247
Thank you, girl.

1491
01:29:03,251 --> 01:29:07,881
Did l tell you how good
you looked in that suit?

1492
01:29:16,898 --> 01:29:19,833
Don't worry.
Won't take but a minute.

1493
01:29:19,868 --> 01:29:21,859
Depending on who's in it.

1494
01:29:26,207 --> 01:29:29,176
ls there anything
l can do to stop this?

1495
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:32,407
Richard Pryor said
when he was in prison...

1496
01:29:32,447 --> 01:29:35,678
he kept folks laughing to keep
their minds off his booty.

1497
01:29:35,717 --> 01:29:38,652
Do you know any jokes?

1498
01:29:38,687 --> 01:29:41,281
No, l don't know any jokes.

1499
01:29:41,322 --> 01:29:42,949
You better think of something.

1500
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:45,687
What if l can't
think of anything?

1501
01:29:47,128 --> 01:29:49,392
The light's out,
the party's over...

1502
01:29:49,431 --> 01:29:52,662
the cake's on the griddle,
and you already greased.

1503
01:29:54,903 --> 01:29:57,030
All right,
you're first, my man.

1504
01:29:57,072 --> 01:29:58,801
Let's go.

1505
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:02,367
All right. Let's go.

1506
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:03,741
Come on.

1507
01:30:03,778 --> 01:30:05,040
Excuse me, everybody.

1508
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,514
Won't you gather around?
l got something to say.

1509
01:30:07,549 --> 01:30:09,016
Who is this clown?

1510
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:10,574
Just a guy who looks
at things differently

1511
01:30:10,618 --> 01:30:13,178
The way things are
aren't how they're meant to be

1512
01:30:13,221 --> 01:30:15,212
With the big men
here in the bullpen

1513
01:30:15,256 --> 01:30:17,690
l don't want my knees
to take a full bend

1514
01:30:17,726 --> 01:30:19,853
Step back, ask yourself,
can it wait?

1515
01:30:19,894 --> 01:30:21,885
Or do you want to become
an AlDS candidate?

1516
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:24,330
Take your eyes off me,
don't even watch the Kid

1517
01:30:24,365 --> 01:30:26,697
Or you'll go out
like Liberace did

1518
01:30:26,735 --> 01:30:28,760
ln my own cell
l could've been alone

1519
01:30:28,803 --> 01:30:31,203
Why do you all want me?
l'm only skin and bones

1520
01:30:31,239 --> 01:30:33,799
l'm feeling faint,
it's kind of hot

1521
01:30:33,842 --> 01:30:36,310
My, what big muscles you got

1522
01:30:36,344 --> 01:30:38,278
Hoo, lips don't fail me now

1523
01:30:38,313 --> 01:30:39,746
Until Play comes to bail me out

1524
01:30:39,781 --> 01:30:40,975
What's going on there?

1525
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:51,320
Man, this is too much,
look but don't touch

1526
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:53,554
l'm just trying
to avoid the bum rush

1527
01:30:53,595 --> 01:30:56,063
Thought l was in here
with murderers and stranglers

1528
01:30:56,097 --> 01:30:58,122
You guys are a bunch
of rump wranglers

1529
01:30:58,166 --> 01:31:00,157
And why me?
Look, l'm not the only male

1530
01:31:00,201 --> 01:31:02,499
We gonna tie that fade
into a ponytail

1531
01:31:02,537 --> 01:31:05,097
Yo, this is a no-go,
l'm gonna call the C.O.

1532
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:06,971
Me a homo?
Nah, man, that's a no-no

1533
01:31:07,008 --> 01:31:09,238
But if you back off now,
that might save you time

1534
01:31:09,277 --> 01:31:11,108
Off your sentence
for good behavior

1535
01:31:11,146 --> 01:31:13,637
l'm speaking from the heart,
from the center

1536
01:31:13,681 --> 01:31:15,740
The sign on my ass
says "Do Not Enter"

1537
01:31:15,784 --> 01:31:18,617
l'm a rapper, l rock rhymes,
so l'm gonna bust one

1538
01:31:18,653 --> 01:31:20,484
l see y'all wanna rock,
like Hudson

1539
01:31:20,522 --> 01:31:22,422
Just an example,
l chill 'em and thrill 'em

1540
01:31:22,457 --> 01:31:24,425
Where is Play?
l'm gonna kill him

1541
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:28,121
Songbird,
you hit the right note.

1542
01:31:28,163 --> 01:31:29,357
You just made bail.

1543
01:31:33,301 --> 01:31:34,859
Ha, hey, fellas, fellas

1544
01:31:34,903 --> 01:31:37,337
Ha ha, l gotta go,
all right?

1545
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:39,101
Don't feel bad, all right?

1546
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:41,438
Hey, no long faces, ha ha

1547
01:31:41,476 --> 01:31:42,943
Think of all the fun we had

1548
01:31:42,977 --> 01:31:45,502
l want to thank y'all
for making me feel welcome

1549
01:31:45,547 --> 01:31:48,675
lt really, really
did the trick, all right?

1550
01:31:48,716 --> 01:31:50,240
Oh, uh, by the way

1551
01:31:51,386 --> 01:31:52,546
Suck my dick

1552
01:31:55,824 --> 01:31:57,621
l'll kick your fuckin' ass!

1553
01:31:57,659 --> 01:31:58,819
Punk!

1554
01:32:37,732 --> 01:32:41,259
With that motivation,
you could have rapped all night.

1555
01:32:41,302 --> 01:32:43,702
l'm glad y'all came
through for me finally.

1556
01:32:43,738 --> 01:32:46,036
Would l let a homeboy down?

1557
01:32:51,246 --> 01:32:55,205
So, you want
to go out next week?

1558
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:57,980
-OK.
-Good.

1559
01:32:59,754 --> 01:33:02,086
-Call me.
-l will.

1560
01:33:03,191 --> 01:33:05,716
l don't get a kiss?

1561
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,752
A hug? Some form of affection?

1562
01:33:11,499 --> 01:33:13,797
Come on, stop playing.

1563
01:33:26,848 --> 01:33:29,783
Any lipstick on me? Yes!

1564
01:33:29,817 --> 01:33:31,842
l knew it. Smooth operator.

1565
01:33:42,497 --> 01:33:43,657
Bye, Sidney.

1566
01:34:00,014 --> 01:34:03,177
Don't slob too loud.
You'll wake the neighbors up.

1567
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:13,950
l'll see you later.

1568
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,871
This has been your night, boy!

1569
01:34:34,916 --> 01:34:37,214
Cannot front. You are the dude.

1570
01:34:37,251 --> 01:34:40,015
That must have been
one hell of a walk home.

1571
01:34:40,054 --> 01:34:42,386
Give me
a play-by-play description.

1572
01:34:42,423 --> 01:34:43,947
What color were the panties?

1573
01:34:45,126 --> 01:34:48,459
We got into it,
but then we didn't--

1574
01:34:48,496 --> 01:34:50,327
She was on her period?

1575
01:34:50,365 --> 01:34:52,629
No, she wasn't on her period.

1576
01:34:52,667 --> 01:34:53,895
What's up?

1577
01:34:55,303 --> 01:34:57,066
l didn't have any rubbers.

1578
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:02,837
Hold up. She was down.

1579
01:35:02,877 --> 01:35:04,868
Play knows these things.
She was down.

1580
01:35:04,912 --> 01:35:07,244
And you was down,
and you didn't...

1581
01:35:07,281 --> 01:35:09,181
'cause you didn't
have birth control?

1582
01:35:09,217 --> 01:35:11,378
Let me explain--

1583
01:35:11,419 --> 01:35:14,047
We're talking
about fine Sidney here.

1584
01:35:14,088 --> 01:35:15,919
Good hair.

1585
01:35:15,957 --> 01:35:17,754
Def body!

1586
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:19,453
That's who
we're talking about.

1587
01:35:19,494 --> 01:35:21,587
ls that all you're into?
"Good hair. Def body."

1588
01:35:21,629 --> 01:35:25,531
What are you talking about?
l look at the face, too.

1589
01:35:25,566 --> 01:35:26,828
That's fucked.

1590
01:35:26,868 --> 01:35:29,302
l'm not about
having babies right now.

1591
01:35:29,337 --> 01:35:31,328
That's her problem.

1592
01:35:31,372 --> 01:35:32,964
You the man.

1593
01:35:33,007 --> 01:35:36,534
She takes care of that
or pays the price.

1594
01:35:36,577 --> 01:35:38,568
-How can you say that?
-You're naive.

1595
01:35:38,613 --> 01:35:41,081
You're a fuckin' dog,
and you, too, Rover.

1596
01:35:41,115 --> 01:35:44,175
Yeah, l'm a dog.

1597
01:35:44,218 --> 01:35:46,345
You sound like your pops.

1598
01:35:46,387 --> 01:35:48,480
A guy your age
shouldn't sound like your pops.

1599
01:35:48,523 --> 01:35:49,854
You've got a problem.

1600
01:35:57,665 --> 01:36:00,133
Yo, Kid.
Chill for a minute.

1601
01:36:00,168 --> 01:36:03,160
lt's still early,
l got the crib...

1602
01:36:03,204 --> 01:36:05,695
and you won't believe
what's on the Late Show.

1603
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:07,401
"Krush Groove"
and "Beat Street."

1604
01:36:07,442 --> 01:36:09,808
Shit, let's go to your house now
and watch it.

1605
01:36:13,214 --> 01:36:15,273
l really would like
to see the movie...

1606
01:36:15,316 --> 01:36:17,443
but it's really late, man.

1607
01:36:17,485 --> 01:36:19,146
Tape it,
and we'll watch it tomorrow.

1608
01:36:19,187 --> 01:36:21,314
Peace out.

1609
01:36:21,355 --> 01:36:23,755
-Peace, boy.
-Peace.

1610
01:36:25,526 --> 01:36:28,359
You know what l love
was "Breakin'."

1611
01:36:28,396 --> 01:36:30,728
l wonder when
that shit's coming on.

1612
01:37:35,129 --> 01:37:37,461
l wouldn't do that just yet...

1613
01:37:38,699 --> 01:37:41,224
'cause your ass is mine.

1614
01:37:41,802 --> 01:37:43,167
Pop, l can explain.

1615
01:37:43,204 --> 01:37:45,798
l'm gonna whup that damn
high-top fade off of you!

1616
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,364
l'm sick of your shit!

1617
01:37:47,408 --> 01:37:50,309
l work too hard and too long
to let you run over me...

1618
01:37:50,344 --> 01:37:52,642
like you outta your damn mind.

1619
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,739
l walked across
this damn city...

1620
01:37:54,782 --> 01:37:56,909
got stopped by
the goddamn law...

1621
01:37:56,951 --> 01:37:58,782
lookin' for your monkey ass.

1622
01:37:58,819 --> 01:38:01,344
All you kids over there
just slow-dancing...

1623
01:38:01,389 --> 01:38:04,187
doing the grind,
and the peepin' and the hidin'.

1624
01:38:04,225 --> 01:38:07,991
l know your ass.
You was there, wasn't you?

1625
01:38:08,029 --> 01:38:10,259
l run the show here.

1626
01:38:10,298 --> 01:38:13,267
l wear the pants and the apron,
and l'll wear your ass out!

1627
01:38:17,672 --> 01:38:19,230
l'm gonna whup you
till l'm sleepy.

1628
01:38:19,273 --> 01:38:22,242
And l'm wide awoke
'cause l just woke up.

1629
01:38:22,276 --> 01:38:24,107
You think because
you're big and yellow...

1630
01:38:24,145 --> 01:38:26,636
l'm supposed to be mellow.
Hell, no!

1631
01:38:26,681 --> 01:38:29,275
l'll start a fight
in an empty room !

1632
01:38:29,317 --> 01:38:31,911
You can call Child Abuse
if you want to!

1633
01:38:31,953 --> 01:38:34,979
They better not come in here,
'cause l'll kick their ass, too.

1634
01:38:38,593 --> 01:38:40,993
l'm gonna give you
a whuppin' from now on.

1635
01:38:41,028 --> 01:38:42,825
l'll whup the cowboy shit
out from you.

1636
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:48,633
Gee, Pop.

1637
01:38:48,669 --> 01:38:50,432
Now get your ass to bed!

1638
01:38:50,471 --> 01:38:52,803
And don't wake up
till l tell you to!

1639
01:39:11,459 --> 01:39:12,687
l didn't mean it.

1640
01:39:12,727 --> 01:39:15,958
l didn't know they were
the rest of the cookies.

1641
01:39:15,997 --> 01:39:17,692
My grandma's 87 years old.

1642
01:39:17,732 --> 01:39:20,929
l don't know how many years
she's got left to make cookies.

1643
01:39:20,968 --> 01:39:23,095
You didn't have to finish
the rest of them.

1644
01:39:23,137 --> 01:39:25,970
l don't know how many years
l've got left in my grandmother.

1645
01:39:26,007 --> 01:39:27,338
They were good, though.

1646
01:39:30,444 --> 01:39:32,344
Look at that.

1647
