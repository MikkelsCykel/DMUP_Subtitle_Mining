1
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,541
Sir, what's that there?

2
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,654
What's that?

3
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:10,316
Well, that's not the cuttlefish
that I told you to look for.

4
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,451
That's for a start. That is an insulator.

5
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,821
Aye, an insulator, that is.

6
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,456
Probably off a German battleship.

7
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,763
I'm sure there's no German battleships
coming here, sir.

8
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:25,237
- You don't know, there might be.
- No, Timmy's right.

9
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,898
Now, tell me this.

10
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:29,340
Why is there so much stuff
around Killins Bay?

11
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,244
It's a tide... Tidal eddy around the head.

12
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:36,112
Tidal eddy. Very good, Tim. Good.

13
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:39,517
All right, come on, now. Go on looking.

14
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:42,579
The tide's going down. Go on, hurry up.

15
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,162
Go on, Kathleen. Off with the others.

16
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,564
You never know,
you might find a diamond tiara.

17
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,675
Sir, sir.

18
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,341
Aye, that's a cuttlefish.

19
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:43,112
- Good lad.
- I'll try and find a bigger one.

20
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:44,344
You do that, Tim.

21
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,664
Come on.

22
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,195
What is it, sir?

23
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,472
No, it's nothing. Nothing.
'Tis all right, Kathy.

24
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,606
Come on.

25
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,311
Time we had lunch.
We're eating at Barrow.

26
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,044
It's a long way to Barrow, sir.

27
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,848
Step off, then. That's where we're eating.

28
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,913
Tide's coming in, sir.

29
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,183
So it is.

30
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:45,634
Hey, would you look at Michael?

31
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:49,331
Michael.

32
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,309
It's the Major.

33
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,787
Hey, Tom, will you have a look at this?

34
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,560
He's getting worse, you know.

35
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:21,199
Michael, let's have a look at your V.C.

36
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,008
- How many Germans did you kill, Michael?
- All right.

37
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,344
All right, very entertaining.

38
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,716
Michael, you're a perfect fool.

39
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:38,622
You ask for trouble.
Come on, now, take the foolish things off.

40
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:44,787
Michael, take them off, now. Come on.

41
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,297
Michael!

42
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,750
What's eating him?

43
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,877
- What've you been doing?
- Don't know, Father.

44
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,345
We've not done anything.

45
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:13,288
Come on now, Michael. What're you up to?

46
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,028
Let go!

47
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,594
Michael, let go, or I'll hit you.

48
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:05,041
Michael, darling, let go.

49
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,973
Major, darling, let me touch your V.C.

50
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:42,071
You see, my husband hasn't got one.

51
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,584
Well?

52
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,253
Well.

53
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,626
What was the meaning
of that pantomime?

54
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,133
I don't know.

55
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:37,269
- Where have you been?
- Riding...

56
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:41,505
- with Major Doryan.
- You're bold as brass.

57
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:45,876
You think that's a suitable connection
for a decent Irish wife?

58
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:49,040
I think that is for my husband to say,
Father Hugh.

59
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,015
- You've told him, have you?
- Yes.

60
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,574
Yes, you would.

61
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,018
Your husband would say anything
you wanted, pretty well...

62
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,852
because he loves you sorely, doesn't he?

63
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:04,728
- Yes, he does.
- Have you nothing to say to me?

64
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,393
- What should I have to say to you?
- You could say:

65
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,834
"Father Hugh, there's nothing
between me and Major Doryan."

66
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,429
- There isn't.
- Say it, then.

67
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,176
There is nothing between me
and Major Doryan.

68
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:20,873
Look at me, Rosy.

69
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,813
Oh, child, what a face.

70
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,314
- Rose, tell me now.
- What?

71
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,792
You'll have to tell it in confessional,
you little fool.

72
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,590
I don't have to come...

73
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,154
- to the confessional.
- Child!

74
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,966
Child?

75
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,672
- Father.
- Hello, then.

76
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:51,802
Rosy...

77
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,281
was there something?

78
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,682
No, I just...

79
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:01,948
- Will you take the prayers, then?
- Aye.

80
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:12,289
"Our Father...

81
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,266
"who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

82
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,530
"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done...

83
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,663
"on Earth as it is in heaven.

84
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:24,005
"Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses...

85
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:27,308
"as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

86
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,282
"And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil."

87
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,912
In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost.

88
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,888
All right, children, off with you.

89
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,895
Thank you, Father. Good day.

90
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,063
Glad to help, Charles.

91
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:50,232
Is there anything else I can help you with?

92
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,100
No, I don't think so.

93
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,804
Well, I'll be off home, too, then.

94
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:15,757
- You're late.
- I took them for a nature walk.

95
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,959
Up Brandon?

96
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:19,726
Along the shore.

97
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,869
- For cuttlefish?
- Aye.

98
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:25,861
For cuttlefish.

99
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,976
If you'd come up Brandon,
we might have seen you.

100
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,380
Why?

101
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,044
- Did you go to Brandon?
- Aye.

102
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:42,184
I got some heather.

103
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,222
So you did.

104
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:49,294
You haven't been to the beach, then?

105
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,554
No.

106
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,963
Oh, well.

107
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:59,800
- It's nice up Brandon.
- Aye, it's grand.

108
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,140
Is something the matter?

109
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:21,180
I don't know, Rose. Is there?

110
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:25,377
There's nothing the matter with me.

111
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,245
Nothing's the matter, then.

112
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,865
And the jam, and the...

113
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,503
The jam...

114
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:52,043
and the soap.

115
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,339
Maggie.

116
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,179
That'll be 18 pence.

117
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:02,111
Could it wait
to the end of the week, missus?

118
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:04,850
Aye, to the end of the week.
Not to the crack of doom.

119
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,516
Thank you.

120
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,391
- What was it, then?
- I want a dishcloth, please.

121
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,998
- I've none.
- Oh.

122
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,062
Then I'll just take some potatoes.
Five pound.

123
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:21,940
I've no potatoes, either.

124
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:27,270
What's them, then?

125
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,406
Aye, them.

126
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:33,111
They're gone. I've no potatoes.

127
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,255
Oh, I... I see.

128
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:49,192
The way I see it, Mrs. Kenyon,
there's loose women and there's whores...

129
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:52,727
and then there's British soldiers' whores.

130
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:45,420
- Coming up fast, Father.
- Aye.

131
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,721
Will you look at those things?

132
00:23:55,868 --> 00:24:00,032
You'd think they was announcing
the coming of Christ.

133
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:16,581
- Off you go!
- Right.

134
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:20,816
Put her down!

135
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:23,829
Slowly does it.

136
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:04,799
All right, now! That's it.
Come on, Joe, there's a good lad.

137
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:07,566
Come on, it's late.

138
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:11,209
All right. Come on, Sean.

139
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,543
Come on, Tom. You've got to go to sleep.

140
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,043
Go on. Good night!

141
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,440
Hello, Tom.

142
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:49,244
- You? What are you doing here?
- Come on, now, Tom.

143
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:53,649
Phoenix Park, 1913.

144
00:25:58,357 --> 00:25:59,756
Tim O'Leary.

145
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:04,859
Come on.

146
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:09,926
Right, lads.

147
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,664
Now, what do you usually do
at this time, Tom?

148
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,228
- I go to bed.
- Right.

149
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:16,070
This is Bernard. Go on up, lads.

150
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,837
- Paddy.
- Paddy.

151
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,036
Sean.

152
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:22,003
Joseph, Peter...

153
00:26:23,116 --> 00:26:24,447
Mr. O'Keefe.

154
00:26:25,118 --> 00:26:27,586
- And you know Pat.
- Which room?

155
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,052
At the back.

156
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:32,756
But, Commandant, sir, what's happening?

157
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:48,096
Guns, is it?

158
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:52,270
- That's right, Tom. German guns.
- German?

159
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:55,781
Dynamite, grenades.
All the stuff the movement needs.

160
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,911
We tried to launch the boat...

161
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:05,485
- You must get to them somehow, then.
- We can't.

162
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:10,257
But Sean here says there's a good chance
some of it will break away and come to us.

163
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,092
- Float in?
- You're on to it.

164
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:14,065
But, if it does, we won't know where.

165
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,068
You can't see the nose on your face
out there now.

166
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,933
So we'll wait till daylight.

167
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:21,769
- Absolute madness.
- Will you shut up?

168
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:23,035
Tom...

169
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,774
if it's to be done in daylight,
it's to be done quick.

170
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:29,178
So we must have some fellows,
say a dozen...

171
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:33,116
good, strong fellows,
and that's where you come in.

172
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:39,489
- What if it don't break away?
- Exactly.

173
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,287
Then we'll wait one hour
and go without it.

174
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,828
One hour, Tom...

175
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:46,831
and 12 strong men. That's all I'm asking.

176
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,589
Can you do it?

177
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:51,432
I could rout out a dozen, yes.

178
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:54,468
- Do you want them now?
- Not at all.

179
00:27:55,308 --> 00:27:57,503
The later they know we're here, the better.

180
00:27:57,944 --> 00:28:00,344
You let them lie till nearer morning.

181
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:03,940
Can you find us something to eat?
It's gonna be a long night.

182
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:40,007
Paddy, Tom.

183
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,053
Take the Constable his breakfast.

184
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,494
Jesus and Mary, what a night.

185
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,702
Now, do not make one sound, Constable.

186
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:16,011
Right. You.

187
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,215
Fat guts, get the handcuffs.

188
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:21,487
- Where are they?
- In the cupboard.

189
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,553
Turn around.

190
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:37,375
- I'm acting under duress.
- Shut up.

191
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,502
Put them on him.

192
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,212
Open your mouth, Constable.

193
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:07,896
Is that a telephone line?

194
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,438
Cut it.

195
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,204
Oh, God.

196
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:44,137
Why have you done this to me?

197
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,349
Hello?

198
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:56,387
This is Ryan.

199
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,783
- Did you cut the wire?
- I did.

200
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,759
You're doing well, Tom.

201
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,421
- Where's the Constable?
- In the cellar.

202
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,593
We can put a bullet in him if you like.

203
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,829
Constable... No!

204
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:14,737
- Then get your men.
- Aye, Commandant.

205
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,035
Right.

206
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,155
They've gone!

207
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:07,624
Busted loose!

208
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,700
It's no good, Commandant!

209
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:30,230
Why don't you get up out of it
while you can?

210
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:32,833
Tim!

211
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:05,742
- Hey, are you Tim O'Leary?
- Yes, son, yes.

212
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:18,786
Father, what the hell
have you done this for?

213
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:21,018
I didn't, they did!

214
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:22,924
Well, do you know what you're doing?

215
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:24,860
- Do you know what we've come for?
- Aye.

216
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,296
- Have you got it?
- Well, look.

217
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,235
- T'will be on the slabs.
- Where?

218
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:34,670
The slabs!

219
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,518
Tim!

220
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:10,194
Come on.

221
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:20,362
Yes, Kathy?

222
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:22,964
- Aren't you coming to the beach, sir?
- The beach?

223
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,440
Everyone's at the beach.

224
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,910
- And why is everyone at the beach?
- I don't know, sir. I think it's a wreck.

225
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:30,243
A wreck?

226
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,965
Now, that's enough, Tom.
You're not as young as you used to be.

227
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:51,195
Aye, come on!

228
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:09,312
Oh, God.

229
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,058
Pull!

230
00:38:58,604 --> 00:39:03,200
Right, up you get. You, too, Father. Up.
Keep it going.

231
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:06,438
That's right, darling.

232
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:10,745
That's right.

233
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:28,092
Hey!

234
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:31,966
Dynamite.

235
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:34,794
What are you doing here?

236
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,900
- Why shouldn't I be?
- Why?

237
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:44,001
Thank you, ma'am.

238
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:48,340
You know, we made speeches
about these people...

239
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:49,903
but, by God...

240
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,127
Thanks. You're a man!

241
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,714
Come on, then!

242
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:33,824
One!

243
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:35,120
Two!

244
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:36,922
Three!

245
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,250
Sean?

246
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:16,656
- I must take a chance.
- Aye.

247
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:17,854
Good luck.

248
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,111
Thank you. Get down, please.

249
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:42,744
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

250
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,983
You, here. You.

251
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:54,932
No. No trouble now, for your own sakes.

252
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,160
O'Leary.

253
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:00,534
That thing could kill
a lot of people, Major.

254
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:01,594
Sir?

255
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:03,031
No.

256
00:44:12,384 --> 00:44:13,976
Go on. Run, Tim!

257
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,613
Run, Tim.

258
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:18,315
Make it, Tim. Come on!

259
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:20,856
- Run.
- O'Leary!

260
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:23,952
Sir.

261
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:28,824
- No!
- No!

262
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:32,592
- Murderer!
- Don't shoot.

263
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:19,445
What's wrong with the bastard?

264
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,100
Boo!

265
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,140
Shoot that slut, Shaughnessy.

266
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:46,602
Careful, man.

267
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,971
My God, they're a well-matched pair.

268
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:55,142
All right, sir?

269
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,412
- Got a cigarette?
- Yes, sir.

270
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:33,115
Is there anything you want?

271
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:34,689
Cigarette.

272
00:46:43,735 --> 00:46:46,636
- Anything else?
- Yes.

273
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,967
Get out of my country.

274
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:55,746
God bless you, Tim O'Leary!

275
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:16,194
What are they going to do
with them boys, Father?

276
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:18,024
They'll hang them, dear.

277
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,337
They'll hang them.

278
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,748
Bastard!

279
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:45,518
Bastard!

280
00:48:08,453 --> 00:48:09,920
Get out!

281
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,361
You're very kind to me today.

282
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,634
Am I?

283
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:32,903
Yes. Why?

284
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:36,674
Am I not usually kind to you?

285
00:48:37,549 --> 00:48:40,450
Yes, you are. Always.

286
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:49,488
Charles, do you know or not?

287
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:52,857
I know.

288
00:48:57,635 --> 00:49:00,263
- Since when?
- The beginning.

289
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,735
Don't lower your head, Rose.

290
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:15,181
Why didn't you speak?

291
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,588
I should have, shouldn't I?

292
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:22,218
I don't know.

293
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:28,380
It was easier not to, I suppose.
I didn't want to know, you know.

294
00:49:29,426 --> 00:49:33,658
And then I thought, if I let you
burn it out, the pair of you...

295
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,994
you'd perhaps come back to me.

296
00:53:21,024 --> 00:53:22,286
Charles?

297
00:53:22,959 --> 00:53:23,948
Charles?

298
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,078
Mr. Shaughnessy has been called away,
so I'm taking class.

299
00:54:33,263 --> 00:54:36,164
What's the first lesson today, Danny?

300
00:54:38,235 --> 00:54:41,534
- Danny?
- My father says not to speak to you, miss.

301
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,871
- It's right then, he's not here?
- No.

302
00:55:26,483 --> 00:55:28,348
I don't know where he is.

303
00:55:28,418 --> 00:55:30,886
- You mean he's gone off?
- Yes.

304
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:32,080
When?

305
00:55:32,989 --> 00:55:34,354
Last night.

306
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:38,256
You had a row?

307
00:55:38,328 --> 00:55:39,955
I wasn't here.

308
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,554
Where were you?

309
00:55:42,932 --> 00:55:44,866
Oh, I see.

310
00:55:46,202 --> 00:55:49,262
There's nothing I can do tonight,
I'll find him in the morning.

311
00:55:49,339 --> 00:55:52,467
- lf he turns up, you'll tell me.
- Father?

312
00:55:54,244 --> 00:55:56,508
You'd better take his clothes.

313
00:55:58,381 --> 00:56:00,372
His clothes?

314
00:56:09,292 --> 00:56:11,522
He was in bed?

315
00:56:11,695 --> 00:56:13,595
Yes.

316
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:16,791
You left his bed and went to...

317
00:56:22,572 --> 00:56:24,301
Rose.

318
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:29,371
Oh, Rose.

319
00:57:05,248 --> 00:57:07,182
Come on, this isn't a picnic.

320
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,684
All right, Corp, but there's nothing here.

321
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,111
He's got something there, sir.

322
00:57:39,182 --> 00:57:40,410
Padre.

323
00:57:50,693 --> 00:57:52,593
Good morning, padre.

324
00:57:52,662 --> 00:57:55,222
I'm sorry, but what is it
you have there, please?

325
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:01,365
A man's clothes.

326
00:58:02,772 --> 00:58:04,034
I see.

327
00:58:04,307 --> 00:58:07,105
- And where are you taking them, Father?
- To the man.

328
00:58:07,177 --> 00:58:09,236
Come on, padre.
I don't suppose you mean any harm...

329
00:58:09,312 --> 00:58:12,440
but after the other day,
we've got to be careful. What man?

330
00:58:12,515 --> 00:58:16,747
A man whose wife went off two nights
back with her fancy fellow.

331
00:58:17,587 --> 00:58:20,215
And a man I've been looking for
since dawn today.

332
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:22,656
- A man...
- Excuse me, sir.

333
00:58:22,725 --> 00:58:27,321
A man who must be half out of his mind
to have gone off as he did, barefoot.

334
00:58:28,898 --> 00:58:32,231
That's right. Charles Shaughnessy.

335
00:58:46,249 --> 00:58:49,047
I think we're finished here, sir.

336
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,047
Very well.

337
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:49,107
- Hello, Charles.
- Hello, Father.

338
00:59:52,282 --> 00:59:54,580
I've brought your clothes.

339
00:59:54,651 --> 00:59:58,109
Thanks, Father.
I was wondering how I should get home.

340
00:59:58,721 --> 01:00:01,485
- And something to drink.
- Thanks.

341
01:00:07,664 --> 01:00:10,326
- Yourself?
- Aye, I will.

342
01:00:15,705 --> 01:00:18,765
- You seem all right, man.
- Aye, more or less.

343
01:00:18,841 --> 01:00:20,832
Well, I'll get dressed now.

344
01:00:55,011 --> 01:00:56,876
Michael.

345
01:00:58,681 --> 01:01:01,980
He'll be after catching a few flounders.

346
01:01:04,787 --> 01:01:07,312
So, what have you been doing
down here, Charles?

347
01:01:07,624 --> 01:01:10,184
Oh, thinking.

348
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,992
About Rosy?

349
01:01:13,296 --> 01:01:15,526
About myself, mostly.

350
01:01:16,299 --> 01:01:20,201
Thanks for the clothes.
You're a man in a million, Father Hugh.

351
01:02:06,115 --> 01:02:08,276
The children haven't come today, then?

352
01:02:08,351 --> 01:02:09,511
No.

353
01:02:11,254 --> 01:02:14,746
Rose, I have something to say to you.
Come in.

354
01:02:23,399 --> 01:02:25,230
Sit down, will you?

355
01:02:29,572 --> 01:02:34,009
Rose, I thought I could stand by
and let you two burn it out, like I said.

356
01:02:34,077 --> 01:02:36,341
But I find I can't.

357
01:02:37,747 --> 01:02:42,241
I'm not sure I ought to have tried,
but anyway, I can't.

358
01:02:43,853 --> 01:02:46,185
So I'm going to leave you.

359
01:02:50,693 --> 01:02:53,127
- Very well.
- Sit still a minute, Rose.

360
01:02:54,363 --> 01:02:56,524
What about you? You and him?

361
01:02:59,001 --> 01:03:02,198
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

362
01:03:03,406 --> 01:03:04,771
It's over.

363
01:03:06,642 --> 01:03:09,873
Was that because
I went and stayed away?

364
01:03:09,946 --> 01:03:10,935
No.

365
01:03:12,782 --> 01:03:14,147
It's over.

366
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:18,751
- Have you told him?
- No.

367
01:03:18,821 --> 01:03:21,449
He doesn't know, then?

368
01:03:21,524 --> 01:03:23,515
Yes, he knows.

369
01:03:23,593 --> 01:03:25,083
How?

370
01:03:25,862 --> 01:03:27,159
He must.

371
01:03:29,665 --> 01:03:32,099
You're as close as that, are you?

372
01:03:34,604 --> 01:03:36,538
We were, yes.

373
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,051
Rose, you must tell me the truth.

374
01:04:00,129 --> 01:04:02,825
Do you think
you're ever gonna forget him?

375
01:04:02,899 --> 01:04:05,333
Of course not.

376
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:07,335
He'd be like a ghost about the place.

377
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:10,498
Rose, am I right?

378
01:04:12,575 --> 01:04:14,634
Yes, you're right.

379
01:04:15,812 --> 01:04:17,677
It's busted, Charles.

380
01:04:18,881 --> 01:04:20,314
I busted it.

381
01:04:23,753 --> 01:04:27,018
Now, have you thought what to do?

382
01:04:27,089 --> 01:04:29,523
- No.
- Well, I have.

383
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,529
I don't think either of us can stay
in this village any longer.

384
01:04:33,596 --> 01:04:34,654
No.

385
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:38,131
It's time I moved on anyway.
And you were never worse suited here.

386
01:04:39,702 --> 01:04:43,160
I've reckoned up,
I've got about 200 pounds.

387
01:04:45,041 --> 01:04:48,909
Take all this, without the gramophone,
fetch another 50.

388
01:04:48,978 --> 01:04:51,173
We'll split it down the middle.

389
01:04:51,247 --> 01:04:52,942
I can't do it.

390
01:04:55,284 --> 01:04:56,774
We're not enemies, Rose.

391
01:04:57,954 --> 01:05:01,355
Stop that! There's to be none of that.

392
01:05:12,969 --> 01:05:14,766
But why must it be Rosy?

393
01:05:14,837 --> 01:05:17,635
Because she was fornicating
with the fellow.

394
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:22,807
So, you're back, are you?

395
01:05:22,879 --> 01:05:24,574
What is this? What do you want?

396
01:05:25,214 --> 01:05:27,682
- Not you.
- Well, then get out.

397
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:31,845
- Go on, get out.
- Shut up, Shaughnessy.

398
01:05:35,024 --> 01:05:36,548
We're waiting for her.

399
01:05:38,361 --> 01:05:39,726
You.

400
01:05:39,962 --> 01:05:43,921
You've been tried and found guilty.
You're the informer.

401
01:05:45,501 --> 01:05:49,096
- What?
- Busting at the seams with innocence.

402
01:05:49,238 --> 01:05:52,139
Joe, for God's sake, don't hurt her, Joe.
Don't hurt her.

403
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:55,905
If she was a man, Mr. Ryan, she'd be shot.

404
01:05:57,313 --> 01:06:00,805
- What is this?
- Listen, numbskull.

405
01:06:01,217 --> 01:06:03,879
Someone that morning
went up to the camp...

406
01:06:03,953 --> 01:06:06,012
and betrayed Tim O'Leary.

407
01:06:06,489 --> 01:06:09,686
Now, who lives near enough?
Who had time enough?

408
01:06:10,026 --> 01:06:12,517
Who would? Who did?

409
01:06:13,162 --> 01:06:15,323
That bitch you call your wife.

410
01:06:15,398 --> 01:06:16,763
String her up!

411
01:06:20,903 --> 01:06:24,031
But anyone could have, if anyone did.
The whole village was abroad.

412
01:06:24,106 --> 01:06:26,301
No. The village was down on the beach.

413
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:27,967
- Except you.
- You came late.

414
01:06:28,044 --> 01:06:31,536
- We came together. We spoke to no one.
- You'd say that, of course.

415
01:06:31,614 --> 01:06:32,979
Young Kathy was with us.

416
01:06:33,049 --> 01:06:35,779
Young Kathy would say black was white
if you told her.

417
01:06:35,851 --> 01:06:38,615
Then anyone, anyone at all
could've gone into the police station...

418
01:06:38,688 --> 01:06:41,623
- and used the telephone.
- That's where you're wrong.

419
01:06:41,691 --> 01:06:44,660
They couldn't. Could they, Tom?

420
01:06:44,727 --> 01:06:46,695
- No.
- Why not?

421
01:06:46,762 --> 01:06:50,493
Because Tom went in there himself
and cut the wire.

422
01:06:50,566 --> 01:06:52,727
Didn't you, Tom?

423
01:06:54,971 --> 01:06:57,940
Well, you went in there yourself,
didn't you?

424
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:02,542
- Yes.
- And you cut the wire, didn't you?

425
01:07:07,149 --> 01:07:08,548
Yes.

426
01:07:17,093 --> 01:07:20,551
Well, what do you say now?

427
01:07:22,498 --> 01:07:24,125
Nothing.

428
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:25,823
Take her out.

429
01:07:26,235 --> 01:07:29,432
No, you're taking her nowhere.

430
01:07:30,206 --> 01:07:32,071
Stop it!

431
01:07:39,582 --> 01:07:41,379
- Informer.
- There she is!

432
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:56,027
Hold him.

433
01:08:11,514 --> 01:08:13,141
Take him by the hands.

434
01:08:24,827 --> 01:08:27,762
Quiet! Get back!

435
01:08:29,498 --> 01:08:31,261
Get back!

436
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:37,633
Do it.

437
01:09:22,384 --> 01:09:23,681
Princess...

438
01:09:38,033 --> 01:09:39,330
What is it?

439
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,077
There she is.

440
01:10:55,744 --> 01:10:59,305
Look here, Father Hugh,
the stripping of her was an accident.

441
01:10:59,381 --> 01:11:00,575
Steady, Joe.

442
01:11:00,649 --> 01:11:03,117
You're taking advantage of your cloth,
Father Hugh.

443
01:11:03,185 --> 01:11:06,018
- That's what it's for.
- Come on, Joe.

444
01:11:07,056 --> 01:11:09,820
It's not right. A priest is only a man.

445
01:12:06,615 --> 01:12:07,809
Go on.

446
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:12,710
Go on, Michael, get off.

447
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,891
Get off out of it!

448
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:09,164
Hello.

449
01:14:42,971 --> 01:14:44,268
Keep it.

450
01:15:37,059 --> 01:15:38,583
What?

451
01:15:42,164 --> 01:15:44,098
They really thought...

452
01:15:45,367 --> 01:15:49,360
I was the one who betrayed that man.

453
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:51,495
Rose...

454
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:55,301
I don't for one moment suppose
that anyone betrayed him.

455
01:15:56,445 --> 01:15:58,936
Why should they? They just...

456
01:15:59,014 --> 01:16:02,882
They just wanted it so, that's all.
And they wanted it to be you, too.

457
01:16:02,951 --> 01:16:04,942
For other reasons.

458
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:08,080
Truth was told, they envy you.
They always have.

459
01:16:08,991 --> 01:16:12,256
They've always had a rare,
old contempt for me, too.

460
01:16:13,395 --> 01:16:16,626
I tell you, I'm not for letting any
of that lot know we've busted up.

461
01:16:16,698 --> 01:16:19,667
We'll just keep up a front
until I'm well and out of it.

462
01:16:21,336 --> 01:16:22,826
What?

463
01:16:23,705 --> 01:16:25,730
I don't know.

464
01:16:25,807 --> 01:16:27,672
It just seemed funny, that's all.

465
01:19:16,445 --> 01:19:19,778
Michael, give that to me.

466
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:27,911
All right, keep it.

467
01:19:30,358 --> 01:19:32,417
I thought we were friends.

468
01:19:41,303 --> 01:19:44,170
That one, too. Give it to me.

469
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:47,037
No! Look.

470
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:15,031
For Christ's sake, man,
I'm not going to hurt you.

471
01:22:11,953 --> 01:22:15,081
- It'll be the soldiers.
- Soldiers?

472
01:22:15,323 --> 01:22:16,722
Aye.

473
01:22:16,791 --> 01:22:20,955
The beach was fairly littered with stuff.
They'll be destroying it.

474
01:22:22,063 --> 01:22:23,291
Oh, yes.

475
01:23:04,839 --> 01:23:06,670
Come on, lads, pick them up.

476
01:23:06,741 --> 01:23:09,733
What about my blisters, Corporal?

477
01:23:09,811 --> 01:23:13,042
- Well, they're not mourning long.
- No.

478
01:23:14,883 --> 01:23:17,852
Does she think
he killed himself deliberate?

479
01:23:17,919 --> 01:23:19,216
She says...

480
01:23:21,056 --> 01:23:23,718
I think he was a man who suffered,
Father Hugh.

481
01:23:25,193 --> 01:23:27,787
You love her sorely, don't you, Charles?

482
01:23:27,862 --> 01:23:28,851
Yes.

483
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:37,900
- Ready, then?
- Yes.

484
01:23:47,215 --> 01:23:50,878
It's not all your doing, Rosy.
I should not have married you.

485
01:23:51,052 --> 01:23:52,041
No.

486
01:23:54,289 --> 01:23:56,519
You can tell Father Hugh
that we're parting if you like.

487
01:23:56,591 --> 01:23:57,683
No.

488
01:24:28,723 --> 01:24:30,691
- Rosy.
- Father.

489
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:34,488
It'll be a fair day for the journey, yet,
I think.

490
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:37,325
I hope so, yes.

491
01:24:40,135 --> 01:24:42,467
Well, now, how shall we manage?

492
01:24:42,737 --> 01:24:43,897
Margaret.

493
01:24:43,972 --> 01:24:46,270
Come here, Margaret. Come here.

494
01:25:15,036 --> 01:25:17,095
Kathy, come in.

495
01:25:24,279 --> 01:25:27,715
Kathy, will I take the belt to you?

496
01:25:57,278 --> 01:25:59,075
Take my arm.

497
01:26:21,703 --> 01:26:23,466
A rousing sendoff.

498
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,730
We'll be out of it in five minutes.

499
01:26:47,495 --> 01:26:48,587
Dad.

500
01:26:59,974 --> 01:27:02,238
Goodbye, Dad.

501
01:27:03,178 --> 01:27:04,873
Bye, princess.

502
01:27:09,584 --> 01:27:11,711
I'm all right.

503
01:27:12,587 --> 01:27:15,784
- Are you, darling?
- Aye.

504
01:27:16,024 --> 01:27:19,926
I'm looking forward to Dublin and that.

505
01:27:20,695 --> 01:27:22,629
Really.

506
01:27:22,697 --> 01:27:25,291
That's your mother speaking.

507
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:28,892
- Do you remember your mother, Rose?
- A bit.

508
01:27:30,738 --> 01:27:32,933
Do you, like...

509
01:27:33,007 --> 01:27:35,771
- remember the rows?
- Aye.

510
01:27:35,843 --> 01:27:39,370
- I never raised a fist to her, Rose.
- I know that, Dad.

511
01:27:41,583 --> 01:27:44,609
You wouldn't hurt a fly
if you could help it.

512
01:27:51,526 --> 01:27:54,586
- I'll write to you.
- And I'll write to you.

513
01:27:55,396 --> 01:27:58,297
- Well, maybe.
- No. I swear to God, Rose.

514
01:27:58,366 --> 01:28:01,824
- I will write every... Every...
- All right, Dad.

515
01:28:03,004 --> 01:28:04,995
We'll both write regular.

516
01:28:07,709 --> 01:28:08,733
Bye-bye.

517
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:12,211
Well, wait a minute,
I must say goodbye to your husband.

518
01:28:16,117 --> 01:28:18,051
You know, Rose...

519
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:22,215
when you married him,
I thought you could have done a lot better.

520
01:28:25,226 --> 01:28:27,421
Now I'm not so sure
they come much better.

521
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:31,594
Would you tell him that?

522
01:28:31,666 --> 01:28:34,658
It's not a thing one fellow
can easily say to another.

523
01:28:38,339 --> 01:28:39,670
Shaughnessy.

524
01:28:41,075 --> 01:28:43,043
Mike.

525
01:28:46,214 --> 01:28:47,545
Goodbye, Shaughnessy.

526
01:28:49,117 --> 01:28:51,108
Goodbye, Mr. Ryan.

527
01:28:51,185 --> 01:28:53,881
Are you all right for money, you two?
I have a bit by me.

528
01:28:53,955 --> 01:28:57,755
We're fine for money, Dad.
Thanks. Goodbye.

529
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:10,101
Good luck.

530
01:29:41,703 --> 01:29:44,934
- Get out and don't come back!
- Get out!

531
01:29:46,908 --> 01:29:47,897
Informer.

532
01:30:33,187 --> 01:30:34,814
Bus will be here in a minute.

533
01:30:41,863 --> 01:30:45,128
It's brightened for you, like I said.

534
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:46,461
Aye.

535
01:30:47,268 --> 01:30:49,236
Grand day for a journey.

536
01:30:51,773 --> 01:30:53,400
Sign of good luck.

537
01:31:28,943 --> 01:31:30,137
Thanks.

538
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,770
Bus is coming.

539
01:31:40,521 --> 01:31:43,820
You won't have an address in Dublin yet,
I suppose.

540
01:31:44,525 --> 01:31:45,856
No, Father, we...

541
01:31:45,927 --> 01:31:48,987
I've wrote down here the name
and address of a decent woman...

542
01:31:49,063 --> 01:31:52,464
who'll ask six shillings a week
for a dry room and a clean bed.

543
01:31:54,936 --> 01:31:56,699
Six shillings, the pair of you.

544
01:31:58,439 --> 01:32:01,408
You'll not do better than that,
not in Dublin.

545
01:32:02,210 --> 01:32:04,405
No, I don't suppose so.

546
01:32:06,547 --> 01:32:08,139
Thanks, Father.

547
01:32:28,202 --> 01:32:29,794
Bye, Michael.

548
01:32:37,178 --> 01:32:40,477
I have a parting gift for you here, Rose.

549
01:32:40,548 --> 01:32:43,711
It's supposed to be a fragment
of St. Patrick's staff.

550
01:32:44,285 --> 01:32:46,685
I don't suppose it is, though.

551
01:32:49,957 --> 01:32:51,891
God bless you, child.

552
01:32:53,094 --> 01:32:55,927
Come on, now. Come on, get on up.

553
01:32:56,864 --> 01:32:58,729
I'll help you load up.

554
01:33:12,747 --> 01:33:16,410
Thanks, Father.
Thanks for a great many things.

555
01:33:16,484 --> 01:33:17,883
Charles?

556
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:21,353
I think you have it in your mind
that you and Rosy ought to part.

557
01:33:22,657 --> 01:33:24,852
Yes, I thought as much.

558
01:33:24,926 --> 01:33:27,918
Well, maybe you're right,
maybe you ought, but I doubt it.

559
01:33:27,995 --> 01:33:31,487
And that's my parting gift to you.
That doubt.

560
01:33:36,003 --> 01:33:37,368
God bless.

561
01:33:50,351 --> 01:33:51,841
I don't know.

562
01:33:54,155 --> 01:33:57,488
I don't know at all. Come on, Michael.

563
