1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,385
And 12 midgets.
12 spinning midgets.

2
00:00:06,498 --> 00:00:08,966
That was as great
as I imagined it would be.

3
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:10,962
You look beautiful.

4
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:12,829
And pensive.

5
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:15,095
No, not pensive.

6
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:16,863
Just confused.

7
00:00:17,576 --> 00:00:20,101
Women after lovemaking,
it's always so complicated.

8
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:25,046
Hey, I love your aftershave.
What is it?
It's Yardley.

9
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:28,574
I first used it when I was 16
and never changed.
I'm a very loyal soul.

10
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,621
Come here.
Do you have to put them on?

11
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:33,847
Well, they're quite sexy.
God, what makes
you smell so sweet?

12
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,152
Oh, you like it?

13
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:36,890
Just some fragrance.

14
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:39,418
Right.

15
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:42,558
Where are you going?
I have an idea.

16
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:46,364
I think it's time to celebrate
with some champagne.

17
00:00:49,273 --> 00:00:52,538
I want you to stay.
I make a mean scrambled egg.

18
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:55,234
Stay.

19
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:51,292
That's my mother.

20
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,361
Oh, she's very attractive.

21
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:59,069
Yes, she was very beautiful,
but quite difficult.

22
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:01,436
Difficult?
How?

23
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:03,634
Unfaithful.

24
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:08,214
Say, can you please stay?
Nothing would
please me more. Come on.

25
00:02:08,484 --> 00:02:10,918
I really can't.
Oh, why not?

26
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:14,952
My father.
He's feeling not that great.

27
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:17,218
Nothing serious?
No, no, nothing.

28
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:19,459
Just a tooth problem.

29
00:02:19,527 --> 00:02:22,018
You know,
a little sensitivity
in lower seven.

30
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,595
I really should go.

31
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:32,931
Oh. So, let me
get back to the story.

32
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:37,309
I'm on stage.
I'm doing the
dematerializer trick

33
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:39,369
with this chick
from Manchester.

34
00:02:39,547 --> 00:02:41,913
I don't know
where they get these people,

35
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:44,247
but she looked like
Sitting Bull.

36
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:46,910
And I got her in the thing,
and I vanish her

37
00:02:46,988 --> 00:02:50,446
and everything
goes according to plan
exactly and she's gone.

38
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:53,691
And suddenly,
Strombel appears.
What?

39
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,261
Yes, Strombel's in there!
I got a tremendous hand
from the audience.

40
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:59,059
I wish
I could do it every night!

41
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:00,224
What did he say?

42
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:03,494
He gave me
the combination to a safe.

43
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,595
What safe, I have no idea.

44
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,673
I didn't see any safe.

45
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:13,468
Well, did you
accomplish anything besides
maybe a possible pregnancy?

46
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:14,912
I'll tell you what I did see.

47
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:18,474
His mother, Lady Eleanor,
has short-cut, brunette hair.

48
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,010
Yeah,
but not a hooker?

49
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,053
No, Sidney,
she's not a hooker!

50
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:27,683
I hardly think so.
She's practically royalty.

51
00:03:27,928 --> 00:03:30,054
Christ,
you amaze me sometimes.
Your brain!

52
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:33,428
Back off. You know,
you're getting so upset.

53
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:37,435
I'm just trying
to figure out
the various ramifications.

54
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:38,697
I just don't like
this whole thing!

55
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:40,966
I feel disgusting,
all right, it's awful.

56
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,573
I don't like
the whole process.

57
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:44,041
Yeah, you want to think
he's innocent.

58
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,577
What's so bad about that, huh?

59
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:47,942
Jesus, this guy
must be some lover, you know.

60
00:03:48,014 --> 00:03:50,812
I mean, all of a sudden
you're ready to dump
the whole story.

61
00:03:50,883 --> 00:03:53,613
I must find out
what breakfast cereal he eats.

62
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:57,089
What am I talking about?
There's a combination
on the door

63
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:59,954
where he keeps his precious
musical instruments.

64
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,421
Okay,
so there is a combination!

65
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:03,519
I just got
to get in that room.

66
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:04,893
Do you have the combination?

67
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:07,193
We're not gonna break
into his room if that's
what you're thinking.

68
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:09,358
You gotta have the com...
I got to get in there.
No, no.

69
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:12,128
No, no, we're not
going to do this because
it's not legal... You...

70
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:14,070
Sondra, what's wrong with you?

71
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:16,198
This guy is
the son of a Lord!

72
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:20,574
They'll take us to
the Tower of London
and behead us!

73
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:24,246
Hi.
Guess what?

74
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:26,944
What?
Peter Lyman sent you flowers.

75
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:29,278
I assume your name
is Jade Spence?

76
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:31,649
Naturally I accepted for you.

77
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:32,883
Yeah, I'm Jade Spence.

78
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:35,118
What is going on?
Oh, Vivian...

79
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:38,217
Oh,

80
00:04:39,164 --> 00:04:41,598
Peter's giving a party
on Saturday and
he wants me to come.

81
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,463
I... Oh, I guess
I'll have to buy a dress.

82
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,264
Well, he certainly
seems smitten with you.

83
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,361
If he's smitten with anyone,
it's Jade Spence.

84
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:49,972
Who is Jade Spence?

85
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,971
A would-be
investigative reporter

86
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,875
who's falling in love
with the object
of her investigation.

87
00:05:04,488 --> 00:05:06,012
Of course we did.
Absolutely.

88
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,819
God bless you, sir.
I'm going to show you
a little thing.

89
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,416
I want you
to think of a card. Just think
of one of those cards.

90
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,789
Any one you want.
You got it?

91
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:14,831
All right, now, are you
happening to be thinking
of the seven of spades?

92
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,001
That's amazing!
How do you do that?
Just a little hobby of mine.

93
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,003
You know, I wish
I had more time to practice,

94
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:24,500
but, what with my oil wells,
you know, I never
get around to it.

95
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,132
Your daughter's
very beautiful.

96
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,608
You met my daughter?
Yes.

97
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:30,942
Yes, we're very proud of her.
She's a lovely girl.
Overcame a great handicap.

98
00:05:31,013 --> 00:05:33,208
Yeah. You know, she was
learning disabled.

99
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,983
Her mother and I took
her to many specialists,
you know.

100
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:37,679
Now she's practically normal,
you know.

101
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,085
She's a charmer.

102
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:42,314
God bless you, sweetheart.
What is your sign?
I'm an Aquarian.

103
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,416
You're Aquarian?
And what is your persuasion?

104
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:47,227
Do you mean my religion?
Yeah, your persuasion.

105
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:49,127
I'm a Christian. What are you?
Yes, are you?

106
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:52,326
Me, I was born into
the Hebrew persuasion,

107
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:55,132
but, when I got older,
I converted to narcissism.

108
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:56,296
Dad?
Hmm?

109
00:05:57,472 --> 00:05:59,463
Dad, I need
to talk to you right now.

110
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,874
Oh, I was just about
to pull some quarters
out of Mrs. Quincy's nose.

111
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:04,706
Right now.
I need to talk to you.

112
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:05,802
Really?
Yep.

113
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:07,542
Excuse me. I'll...

114
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:08,776
Where?

115
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,716
Would you stop doing
those nitwit tricks?

116
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:15,086
What is wrong with you?
You're supposed to be
a dignified businessman.

117
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:18,092
I told them it was a hobby.
The hobby of a rich merchant.

118
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,184
You know, so...

119
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:21,525
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me.

120
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,390
Go down the stairs,
open the music room door.
I'll keep Peter busy.

121
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:27,901
I'll meet you down there
in a minute. You brought
the combination, right?

122
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:29,561
No, I left it
in my other jacket.

123
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:30,798
What?
Yes. And...

124
00:06:30,872 --> 00:06:32,897
So, what are we gonna do?
You gotta go home
and get it then.

125
00:06:32,974 --> 00:06:35,965
I can't get it
because the other
jacket's in the cleaners.

126
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:38,375
Sidney.
This is the problem
having a limited wardrobe.

127
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:39,708
But not to worry.

128
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,681
I have a mnemonic system.
I remember everything.

129
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,878
There you are. Mr. Spence,
trust you're having
a good time?

130
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:48,786
Yes,
a great time! This
reminds me of our party.

131
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:52,257
We threw a masked ball in
Palm Beach this year,
it was wonderful.

132
00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:55,784
I came as a harlequin.
She dressed as Petunia Pig.

133
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:57,831
Honey, there's something
I wanted to ask you about.
Absolutely.

134
00:06:57,898 --> 00:07:01,891
That was a mask, wasn't it?
Just... I love her.
Just a minute, okay?

135
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:05,138
Do you need a drink,
Mr. Spence?
No, I'm fine, thank you.

136
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:30,660
It's eight

137
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:33,989
blue horses.
No, no, no.

138
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:37,531
It's 10.
Ten spinning midgets.

139
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:41,597
No, it's 12.
Twelve jet planes
and eight... No.

140
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:49,244
Good to see you.
Have a nice time.
Nice to meet you.

141
00:07:50,282 --> 00:07:53,115
Calm down, calm down.
It was... It was...

142
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:55,243
It was...

143
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:58,686
Eight maids a-milking

144
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:01,792
and three French hens.

145
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,149
No, no.

146
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:15,300
Sixteen, wait, 20 jet planes,

147
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:17,641
12 spinning midgets.

148
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,410
Eureka!

149
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:10,885
I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna
use the bathroom.

150
00:09:28,545 --> 00:09:29,534
Sidney?

151
00:09:29,646 --> 00:09:32,547
Sidney, is that you?

152
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:36,013
I'm locked in!
Oh, Christ...
What's the combination?

153
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:39,120
For some reason,
it's gone out of my mind.

154
00:09:41,557 --> 00:09:43,081
Did you see Miss Spence?

155
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:46,150
I thought I saw her
going downstairs.
Downstairs, right.

156
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:48,859
It's
16 blue horses.

157
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:52,862
It's 21 jet planes.

158
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:56,460
And 12 midgets.

159
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,004
Twelve spinning midgets.

160
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:03,669
Oh, thank God!

161
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:05,907
I thought
I was gonna turn out to be
one of those skeletons

162
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,313
people find
when they sell the house.
Check the door.

163
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:11,581
Sixteen, 21, 12.
You couldn't remember
that number?

164
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:15,215
My mnemonic system failed me.
What do you want me to say?

165
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:19,482
Now exactly
what are we looking for
in here? This is all...

166
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,118
I'm not really sure.

167
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:23,121
You're not sure?

168
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,855
Well, you know,
don't break anything.

169
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:27,958
By God, we'll get caught
and God knows.

170
00:10:28,302 --> 00:10:29,792
Hey, you know
the old dirty joke

171
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:32,499
about how
the French horn player
sleeps with his wife at night?

172
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,505
Sidney,
put that thing down!

173
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:36,838
Will you excuse me?

174
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:43,046
There's nothing
but musical instruments
in here.

175
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:45,312
I'm telling you,
we're on a wild goose chase.
Believe me.

176
00:10:45,386 --> 00:10:47,377
Jade?
What's the matter?

177
00:10:47,488 --> 00:10:49,217
Did you hear that?

178
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,583
I thought I heard something.
Oh, come on, come on.
Let's get out of here.

179
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:54,660
All we need
is to get caught in here.

180
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:57,585
Jade?

181
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:00,795
Ah, there you are.
I was searching for you.

182
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,459
The guests
will be leaving soon.

183
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:06,003
Yes, well, I was
just showing Father around.
He loves English homes.

184
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:07,800
Yes, I was very impressed
with your cellar.

185
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:10,104
I have
a wonderful cellar myself.

186
00:11:10,177 --> 00:11:13,237
No wine,
but it's rodent free.

187
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:15,214
Well,
let's get a drink.

188
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:17,648
Please, Mr. Spence,
I haven't seen you
with a drink all night.

189
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:19,676
Can you stay the night,
please?
What?

190
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:21,214
Come on.
No, I can't.

191
00:11:21,288 --> 00:11:22,983
Why not?
My father.

192
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:25,081
Oh, come on, I'll have
my driver take him home.

193
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:26,989
No.
I can't let you go.
You're too beautiful.

194
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:29,152
Look at you. I can't.

195
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,932
Jade?

196
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:33,643
Oh.
Jade.

197
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:37,710
Jade, it's 4:00 a.m.

198
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,287
What are you doing?

199
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:41,814
I couldn't sleep,

200
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:44,826
so I thought
maybe some milk.

201
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:46,317
Hmm.

202
00:13:48,865 --> 00:13:50,924
Jade, can I ask you something?
Mmm-hmm.

203
00:13:54,237 --> 00:13:57,070
Would you consider
not going home at the end
of the summer?

204
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,906
I don't understand,
what more proof do you need?

205
00:14:00,976 --> 00:14:02,375
What are you gonna tell
the police?

206
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:05,240
The guy
owns a deck of Tarot cards.
That's not a crime.

207
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,377
I mean, what, he was late
for a poker game?

208
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:09,679
I'm sure he's smart enough
to have an alibi.

209
00:14:09,818 --> 00:14:12,514
What are we left with?
His mother has
short-cut, brunette hair.

210
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:14,487
I mean, look,
if we blow the whistle
on this guy...

211
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:17,024
I know. I understand.
...and he's innocent
and we can't make the story...

212
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:18,821
Then he realizes
that you're, you know,

213
00:14:18,894 --> 00:14:21,920
you're a pushy little phony
who's been playing him
for a sucker

214
00:14:21,997 --> 00:14:24,363
and he dumps you,
you know. I get it.

215
00:14:24,432 --> 00:14:26,696
All right. All I'm saying,
is that in order to make
an accusation,

216
00:14:26,768 --> 00:14:27,792
we gotta have proof.

217
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:30,303
Especially
about Lord Lyman's son.

218
00:14:30,472 --> 00:14:32,531
You don't make an accusation.

219
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:34,938
We can phone in
an anonymous tip.

220
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:37,634
You know how many crank tips
the papers say the police get?

221
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,679
You're gonna phone one in
on Peter Lyman!

222
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:41,772
They'll hang up on you
mid-sentence.

223
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:43,544
Besides,
if the story's true,

224
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:45,050
I want to be the one
to break it.

225
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,552
You know
what Joe Strombel said?

226
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:49,054
He said,
"Get it first,
but first get it right."

227
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:51,750
Happy birthday.

228
00:14:53,294 --> 00:14:54,784
Wow, thank you.

229
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,290
What's up?
You look so sullen.

230
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:00,360
No, I'm not. I just...

231
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:04,064
I get sad around birthdays.

232
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:06,072
Oh, yes, well,
I can understand that,

233
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,574
but I think we're both
still young enough
to enjoy the gifts.

234
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:09,734
Come on, open it.

235
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,365
Okay.

236
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,048
Oh, wow, it's beautiful.

237
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,582
You like it?
I love it.

238
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,083
Good. Here, allow me.

239
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,075
Gosh.

240
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,988
You shouldn't have.

241
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,183
I wanted to.

242
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:30,024
Hey, hey,
are you crying?
No, I'm too tough to cry.

243
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,118
Oh.

244
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,598
Though my nasal passages
do become congested
when I'm sad.

245
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,497
Oh, don't be sad.
It's your birthday. Hmm?

246
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,230
Oh, I wish I could
celebrate with you tonight.

247
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,297
I just have to go out of town
for a few days.

248
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,497
Really?

249
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,511
Yes, I just have
some business to take care of.

250
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,204
But we'll celebrate
when I get back, all right?
Okay.

251
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:53,308
Thank you so much
for the present.
It's beautiful.

252
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,909
I'll think about you
whenever I wear it.

253
00:15:58,056 --> 00:15:59,614
You didn't tell me
it was your birthday!

254
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,454
I'll take you
for a magnificent dinner.

255
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:03,323
We'll go
to a great restaurant.
Really?

256
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:07,387
Do you enjoy
the McNuggets thing?

257
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,698
What about Indian food?
Do you like spicy food?

258
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,700
No, no, it's okay.

259
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,706
I don't really have
much of an appetite.

260
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,638
But you will when
they bring out the prawns
in hydrochloric acid.

261
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,405
It's fantastic, Sondra.

262
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:23,613
What's the matter?

263
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,615
What,
are you thinking of Peter?
No.

264
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,547
I don't know, it's just...

265
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:30,086
I wouldn't be surprised
if he asked me to marry him
one day, you know?

266
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:32,782
You come
from an Orthodox family.

267
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:35,257
Would they accept
a serial killer?

268
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,721
That's an expensive present.

269
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:42,230
The Lymans are so wealthy.
Yes.

270
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:44,062
It was almost
too extravagant.

271
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:47,631
I'd better get ready.
I still haven't found
my millionaire yet.

272
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:53,476
Oh, God, Sondra, what a mess!

273
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,010
It's starting to add up
against him.

274
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,844
Bits and scraps
are coming together.

275
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,315
God, it's you!

276
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:03,111
I sensed
you were falling in love.
I escaped again.

277
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:06,848
It's just circumstantial junk,
you know. A coincidence
here and there.

278
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:08,948
Too much smoke
not to be fire.

279
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,391
Look, I'm sure
you've been wrong
plenty of times.

280
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:12,621
Not wrong here.

281
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:16,153
Though I agree
you haven't got enough
to pull the trigger yet.

282
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:18,562
If you act prematurely,
not only does he walk,

283
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:21,729
your professional credibility
is wrecked,
sometimes for good.

284
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:23,739
Oh, I'm sure you want him
to be guilty.

285
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,865
You know, that way you get
your last big scoop.

286
00:17:25,975 --> 00:17:27,374
I'm beginning to fade.

287
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:29,275
Sondra, don't let me down!

288
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:31,438
I wish you'd fade for good!

289
00:17:31,614 --> 00:17:32,774
Get out of my life!

290
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:34,282
I'm not
cut out for this.

291
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,875
I should be
flossing molars for a living.

292
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:40,616
The bread is... You know,
I can make a meal
just with the bread.

293
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:42,589
I can do a whole meal,
just nothing but bread.

294
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,624
If I ate that much bread,
I'd be 20 pounds heavier.

295
00:17:45,694 --> 00:17:47,559
See,
I never gain an ounce,

296
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:51,759
because, you know,
my anxiety acts like aerobics.

297
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:53,433
So I get the exercise.

298
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:56,965
Thanks for taking me out
for my birthday, Sidney.

299
00:17:57,072 --> 00:17:59,563
Well, you know,
you're the daughter
that I never had.

300
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:01,632
Oh, that's so...
No, no, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

301
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,109
'Cause I never wanted
to have kids.

302
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:05,810
I didn't.
Because you have kids,
what is it?

303
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:08,913
You know, you're nice
to them, you bring
them up, you suffer,

304
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:10,474
you take care of them

305
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:14,989
and then they grow up
and they accuse you
of having Alzheimer's.

306
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:17,115
Could you
ever live in London?

307
00:18:18,693 --> 00:18:20,160
Could I live
in London? No.

308
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:22,423
And I love London.
Don't get me wrong,
I love London,

309
00:18:22,497 --> 00:18:24,692
but, you know,

310
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:28,730
apart from
the language problem,
I can't take the driving.

311
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:31,863
Because it, you know,
it's on the wrong side,
and I...

312
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:34,103
Every time
I drive a car here,

313
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:36,439
I'm convinced
I'm going to die in a crash.

314
00:18:37,778 --> 00:18:38,767
Sidney!

315
00:18:38,946 --> 00:18:39,935
What's the matter?

316
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:41,878
It's Peter.

317
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:43,007
You said
Peter was out of town.

318
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:44,915
Well, that's
what he told me.

319
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:46,475
Come on.

320
00:18:46,654 --> 00:18:47,916
What do you mean, come on?

321
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:50,150
I ordered prawns.

322
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:52,451
Just pay, all right?
Just pay.

323
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:54,819
What do you mean, pay?
All I do is...

324
00:18:54,895 --> 00:18:56,988
Fine, it's her birthday.

325
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:01,325
Come on.

326
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:03,862
Maybe he's got
another woman on the side,

327
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,939
and he likes you,
but he's sexually
attracted to her.

328
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,400
Thanks, Sidney.

329
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:10,102
Well, why doesn't he have
his chauffeur?

330
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:12,145
I don't know,
whatever he's doing,
he must want it to be secret.

331
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:51,446
Oh, I told you
he went the other way!

332
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:53,509
Can we go home, please?

333
00:19:53,586 --> 00:19:55,349
It's starting to rain.

334
00:19:55,421 --> 00:19:57,821
I can't believe
he lied to me.

335
00:19:58,057 --> 00:20:01,720
Maybe he's doing
something that he's ashamed
to tell you about.

336
00:20:01,794 --> 00:20:05,662
Maybe he belongs to
one of those clubs, or he's
a cross-dresser or something.

337
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:07,891
Or maybe
he does folk dancing.

338
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,433
Oh, I'm sure
it's probably something
that when he tells me,

339
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,526
I'll just feel foolish
for thinking he lied.

340
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:15,835
I'm sure. You know,
not everything in
this world is sinister.

341
00:20:15,907 --> 00:20:17,670
You know,
just practically everything.

342
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:20,575
That Indian food
made me sick.

343
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:24,137
You hardly touched
your cobra salad.
How can you be sick?

344
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:26,178
Help!

345
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:28,913
A woman's been strangled!

346
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,823
Help!
A woman's been strangled!
Help, call the police!

347
00:20:33,891 --> 00:20:35,882
Somebody call the police!
There's been a murder!

348
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,257
There's been
a murder upstairs.

349
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:38,317
Help!

350
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:40,420
Have you got a phone?
Have you got a phone?
Call the police.

351
00:20:40,498 --> 00:20:43,296
Could it be the Tarot Killer?
They found a Tarot card.
It's him.

352
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,766
I can't believe it!
She lives in this building.

353
00:20:44,835 --> 00:20:46,996
It's him again.
They found the Tarot card.

354
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:51,472
Elizabeth Gibson,
another short-haired brunette.

355
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,268
We should have
gone to the police earlier.

356
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,404
Well, you know...
You said that they
wouldn't believe us

357
00:20:57,481 --> 00:20:59,676
and they may not.

358
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,508
Sidney, it's about time
we show my story to
a real newspaperman.

359
00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:05,986
By real, you mean what?

360
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:07,248
One that's living.

361
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:10,455
<i>Vivian's father has a friend
that works at The Observer.</i>

362
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:14,427
Well, it's very vivid
and rather shocking,

363
00:21:14,498 --> 00:21:17,331
and there are some
genuine circumstantial
bits of evidence.

364
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:21,131
But let me give you a lesson
in professional journalism.

365
00:21:22,338 --> 00:21:25,933
No newspaper should
or would ever run this story.

366
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:28,166
What? Why?

367
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,939
It would be
fatally irresponsible
and libelous.

368
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:35,550
All you have here
are a number
of titillating speculations.

369
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:40,116
Flamboyant theories that
tarnish a man, and a
well-known figure at that,

370
00:21:40,189 --> 00:21:42,749
without a single shred
of substantial proof.

371
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:46,054
So his mother
was a short-haired brunette.

372
00:21:46,195 --> 00:21:48,026
So he came late
for a poker game

373
00:21:48,097 --> 00:21:51,658
and said he was going away
on a business trip
and he got caught lying.

374
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:56,734
Yes, but who keeps
a Tarot deck under
a French horn?

375
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,566
It's not against the law
to own a Tarot deck,
or keep it wherever you like.

376
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:05,309
You'd look
pretty foolish in court
with your accusations,

377
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,007
and that's
where you'll wind up.

378
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:10,374
Because he'd have no choice
but to sue you
and the newspaper,

379
00:22:10,452 --> 00:22:11,578
and he'd win.

380
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,385
And to go to the police?

381
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:15,416
I'll come to that.

382
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,653
But first let me
continue my tedious
professorial lecture.

383
00:22:20,428 --> 00:22:22,555
Vivian's dad and I
go way back.

384
00:22:22,964 --> 00:22:25,057
He said you were
a journalism student.

385
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:26,823
Hmm.

386
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:29,461
You talk about getting a tip.

387
00:22:29,671 --> 00:22:31,502
Okay, you won't
disclose your source,

388
00:22:31,573 --> 00:22:34,700
but what you have done
is let your imagination
run wild.

389
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:35,900
No, no.

390
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:39,537
What if I told you
that my source happened
to be a certain Joe Strombel?

391
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,080
The late Joe Strombel?
Yep.

392
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:44,583
You mean, before he died
he gave a student reporter

393
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:46,983
a major story
and didn't follow
it up himself?

394
00:22:47,054 --> 00:22:49,750
We didn't say
it was before he died.

395
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:52,256
What?
No, it...

396
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:53,884
He got the story
before he died,

397
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:56,395
and then he died
before he could follow it up.

398
00:22:58,132 --> 00:23:01,397
Well,
why did he give it to you?
He didn't know he was dying.

399
00:23:01,702 --> 00:23:02,862
I don't buy it.

400
00:23:02,936 --> 00:23:04,494
I knew Joe Strombel well.

401
00:23:04,838 --> 00:23:07,170
If he'd had a tip
that he considered reliable,

402
00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:09,833
he would certainly
have pursued it himself,

403
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,809
from the grave,
if necessary.

404
00:23:13,012 --> 00:23:15,810
What about how Peter
was in the neighborhood

405
00:23:15,882 --> 00:23:17,907
the night
the murder was committed?

406
00:23:19,118 --> 00:23:21,484
I realize as a student
how exciting it must have been

407
00:23:21,554 --> 00:23:24,182
to think that you were onto
something so spectacular.

408
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:25,790
Hey, she is onto something!

409
00:23:25,858 --> 00:23:27,917
This kid is a bloodhound.
Look at her!

410
00:23:27,994 --> 00:23:31,521
She could sell the story
to any tabloid in town.

411
00:23:32,165 --> 00:23:33,154
Hmm.

412
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,228
Now that I've preached
on the realities
of accurate reporting,

413
00:23:37,303 --> 00:23:41,330
I want to tell you
how catastrophic
for everybody involved

414
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:43,534
it would have been
if you had, say, taken

415
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:46,737
the results
of your investigation
to a tabloid.

416
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,640
Today, the police
have apprehended
the Tarot Card Serial Killer.

417
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,014
And it most assuredly
is not Peter Lyman.

418
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,748
What?

419
00:23:56,822 --> 00:23:59,916
Every paper in town
is going to press
with it as we speak.

420
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:04,523
It was a handyman
named Henry Banks
who has confessed.

421
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,393
Banks is a delusional paranoid
who's given Scotland Yard

422
00:24:08,467 --> 00:24:11,129
information
that only the killer
could possibly know.

423
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,767
He's led the police
to two additional bodies

424
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,673
and his DNA
and a fingerprint
they found check out.

425
00:24:18,777 --> 00:24:21,007
I know
this puts a crimp
in your scoop,

426
00:24:21,847 --> 00:24:24,611
but Henry Banks is
the Tarot Card Serial Killer.

427
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:27,006
Not Lord Lyman's son.

428
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,517
Well, I can't say
I'm not walking on air.

429
00:24:32,423 --> 00:24:35,620
Oh, Jesus, If I ever catch
that Joe Strombel,
I'll kill him.

430
00:24:35,693 --> 00:24:37,684
I only hope
Peter forgives me
for what I've done.

431
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:38,853
For what?

432
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:40,863
I lied to him.
I'm not Jade Spence.

433
00:24:40,931 --> 00:24:44,367
I'm a pushy,
duplicitous, ambitious
college student.

434
00:24:44,435 --> 00:24:45,424
I lied to him,
over and over.

435
00:24:45,536 --> 00:24:47,868
Darling, he lied to you, too,
so it's even.

436
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:51,339
His lies pale in comparison
to the enormity
of what I've done.

437
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:54,902
So marry him
as Jade Spence.
Don't tell him.

438
00:24:54,979 --> 00:24:58,312
You know,
you don't have to be
Sondra Pransky ever again.

439
00:24:58,382 --> 00:24:59,815
Marry him as Jade Spence.

440
00:24:59,884 --> 00:25:02,909
Yeah, but I don't want to
have to get you a
Father's Day gift every year.

441
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:07,883
You know, I don't know how to
break this to you, honey,
but you were adopted. Okay?

442
00:25:07,957 --> 00:25:09,891
Your mother and I,
we were at the orphanage,

443
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:12,257
we wanted
a handicapped child, and...

444
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:15,658
Ah, finally.
Just you and I all weekend.

445
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:16,787
Yeah.

446
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:20,259
I thought you'd like it here.

447
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,801
It's lovely.
Mmm-hmm.

448
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:26,068
Peter?
Yes.

449
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:28,667
I have
a confession to make.
Oh, God, so do I.

450
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:31,169
Oh, well, let me go first.

451
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:33,147
Actually, no,
let me, please,

452
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:34,513
because mine's
been bothering me all day.

453
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:35,948
I just want
to get it off my chest.

454
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:39,784
When I told you I was
going away for a few days
on business,

455
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,254
I was lying.

456
00:25:43,091 --> 00:25:45,082
I know.
You know? How?

457
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,820
Oh, I saw you.
You saw me? No.

458
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:50,563
I was at dinner, and...
With your father?

459
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:54,196
Actually...
Well, anyway,
it doesn't matter. Really.

460
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,472
The truth is,
that a company my father owns

461
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,201
is about to merge
with a company
in the Middle East.

462
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:02,243
It's a very
sensitive situation,

463
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,006
and the less
anyone knows about it,
the better.

464
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,671
And we just didn't want
the press to sniff it out.

465
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:06,941
I mean,
that's no excuse, really.

466
00:26:07,015 --> 00:26:09,347
I'm just very sorry
for the extreme secrecy.

467
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:12,478
No, no, no, it's fine.
I'm glad.

468
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:16,285
It's your own
secret information.
That's fine.

469
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:18,621
So your father took you out
for a birthday dinner

470
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:20,388
and you saw me.
I mean, how unnerving.

471
00:26:20,461 --> 00:26:23,294
God, I mean, the thing
I hate most in the world
is lying.

472
00:26:24,432 --> 00:26:25,558
Uh-huh.

473
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,258
What?

474
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,335
Peter...
Yes, Jade?

475
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:32,895
Peter...

476
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:35,067
Oh, yes.
What did you want to tell me?

477
00:26:35,209 --> 00:26:36,233
Uh...

478
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,073
Jade, there's nothing
you can tell me that...

479
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:40,443
My name is not Jade Spence.

480
00:26:41,482 --> 00:26:42,813
It's not?

481
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:45,844
No. It's Sondra Pransky.

482
00:26:46,454 --> 00:26:50,083
And my father
is not my father.
His name is Sidney Waterman.

483
00:26:50,157 --> 00:26:52,057
He's a magician
called Splendini.

484
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:53,649
I'm a journalism student.

485
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:58,425
Don't ask me
what kind of crazy
misinformation we received

486
00:26:58,498 --> 00:27:00,432
to believe you might be
the Tarot Card Killer.

487
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,664
I mean,
I didn't know you
at this time. Remember?

488
00:27:05,138 --> 00:27:07,971
And, of course,
as soon as I got to know you,

489
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:10,373
I knew that
it couldn't possibly be true.

490
00:27:10,443 --> 00:27:12,570
And the police have him now,
so everything's fine.

491
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:15,479
Of course,
along the route
I fell for you,

492
00:27:15,548 --> 00:27:18,176
and now
I totally blew it, and...

493
00:27:18,251 --> 00:27:19,650
Who told you this?

494
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,314
Oh, a newspaperman.
He's now deceased.

495
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,120
Very foolish.
He was eager
for his last scoop.

496
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:28,851
Oh, I'm so sorry. I just

497
00:27:29,062 --> 00:27:32,553
totally understand
if you never want to
speak to me again

498
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:34,496
or if you
don't want to see me...
Miss Pransky.

499
00:27:35,134 --> 00:27:37,659
Not only am I
not angry with you, but you...

500
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:41,968
You've
absolutely made my day!
What?

501
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,407
Just suspecting
that I could be such
an imaginative,

502
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:46,103
dramatic fiend.
I love it.

503
00:27:46,178 --> 00:27:47,202
You do?
Yes.

504
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,941
I think it's one of the
funniest, craziest things
I've ever heard in my life.

505
00:27:50,015 --> 00:27:51,448
I can't wait
to tell the chaps
at the club.

506
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:53,344
Peter?

507
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:54,511
Yes, darling.

508
00:27:55,387 --> 00:27:58,220
I have to ask you something.
Yes, anything. Absolutely.

509
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:03,120
Why did you hide
that Tarot deck
in your music room?

510
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:08,662
How do you
know about that?

511
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:12,267
I was so paranoid. I...
It's crazy.

512
00:28:12,336 --> 00:28:15,430
But I snuck in.
Oh, dear, it was going to be
a surprise.

513
00:28:15,506 --> 00:28:17,974
I bought them for you.
They're Victorian Tarot cards.

514
00:28:18,042 --> 00:28:20,010
You told me
you were into
that kind of thing.

515
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:21,136
What? Oh...
It was gonna be
a gift for you.

516
00:28:21,212 --> 00:28:23,544
Oh, you're so...
I feel like such an idiot!

517
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:26,014
Darling, no, no, no,
never mind, never mind.
What a shame.

518
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:27,813
Let's forget about it.
No...

519
00:28:28,152 --> 00:28:29,483
Huh? Let's just...

520
00:28:30,154 --> 00:28:33,385
Now that we've confessed
our sins, let's move on
with our lives, huh?

521
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,858
Really?
Yeah. I want to hear
all about the real you.

522
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:38,522
And I assure you in advance,
I'll love it.

523
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:40,391
Oh, God,

524
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:43,559
you snuck into
my music room, did you?

525
00:28:45,435 --> 00:28:47,266
So the reason
why he was skulking around,

526
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:49,202
was 'cause he had
this private family business

527
00:28:49,272 --> 00:28:51,604
which is too delicate
to discuss, actually.

528
00:28:51,775 --> 00:28:53,140
Sorry, I don't buy it.

529
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,311
What?
The man
is a liar and a murderer.

530
00:28:56,379 --> 00:28:58,040
And I say that
with all due respect.

531
00:28:58,115 --> 00:29:00,379
Sidney.
Child, I know
what I'm talking about.

532
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,678
Don't call me that, all right?

533
00:29:01,752 --> 00:29:03,743
Do you remember
when we were out
on the estate,

534
00:29:03,887 --> 00:29:05,912
I found a clue,
you thought I was nuts?

535
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:08,890
I thought you were nuts
so many times I can't
recall the exact one.

536
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:12,087
Do you remember this?
Do you remember this
little item? This clue?

537
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:14,627
Yes, Betty G.
Yes, Betty G.

538
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:18,394
Now, I checked
all the girls
that were murdered.

539
00:29:18,702 --> 00:29:21,932
The one that was killed
the night we saw Peter
on the street, was named

540
00:29:22,004 --> 00:29:24,472
Elizabeth Gibson.

541
00:29:25,207 --> 00:29:26,265
So?

542
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:29,606
So Betty
is short for Elizabeth
a lot of times.

543
00:29:29,678 --> 00:29:32,738
Oh, come on, Sidney.
That's a real stretch.
You're reaching now.

544
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:36,945
Look, supposing you wanted
to rub somebody out
and not get caught.

545
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:39,317
Nobody wants
to get caught, Sidney.

546
00:29:39,388 --> 00:29:40,377
Look,

547
00:29:40,456 --> 00:29:44,290
he wants to get rid of
Elizabeth Gibson.
Betty Gibson. Betty Gibson.

548
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,521
So, there's
a series of murders

549
00:29:46,595 --> 00:29:49,996
with a guy that's got
a real style. A Tarot card.

550
00:29:50,065 --> 00:29:51,692
They said
he was a total maniac.

551
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:54,861
He buys a Tarot deck
and let's say he hides it.

552
00:29:54,937 --> 00:29:57,804
Hypothetically,
he hides it, let's say,
in a music room.

553
00:29:57,873 --> 00:30:00,170
Let's say he hides it in,
let's say, a French horn.
Oh, Sidney.

554
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:03,039
In a French horn!
I'm losing patience with you.

555
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:05,272
I'm not saying the guy
did all the murders.

556
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:07,974
I'm saying that he just did
Elizabeth Gibson,

557
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:12,145
then folded it into the series
of the Tarot Killer
so he wouldn't get caught.

558
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,518
Henry Banks
confessed to all the murders.

559
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:16,921
Henry Banks is deranged!
He hallucinates!

560
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:17,980
My God.

561
00:30:18,126 --> 00:30:21,061
Henry... And you know
those guys like to brag
when they get caught.

562
00:30:21,229 --> 00:30:23,220
Henry Banks, you know...

563
00:30:23,298 --> 00:30:27,928
Where are you going? The cops
will dump every unsolved
murder on Henry Banks.

564
00:30:28,002 --> 00:30:29,902
They haven't
caught anybody in years.

565
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:32,869
Peter wouldn't hurt a fly.
Oh, really?

566
00:30:32,941 --> 00:30:34,738
What about a fly who speaks?

567
00:30:35,642 --> 00:30:36,802
What?
Yes.

568
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,970
Why would Peter
kill a prostitute?

569
00:30:39,313 --> 00:30:41,474
Because it looks terrible
on his resume.

570
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,176
Who knows what kind of
sordid life this guy has?

571
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:46,776
Have you
completely lost your mind?
What is wrong with you?

572
00:30:46,854 --> 00:30:49,982
Peter being
blackmailed by a prostitute?
It's ridiculous.

573
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,649
What are you putting
in your Metamucil?

574
00:30:52,426 --> 00:30:53,723
You know...
Where are you going?

575
00:30:53,794 --> 00:30:57,025
You don't understand!
It would kill his reputation!

576
00:30:57,097 --> 00:30:58,758
Oh, can you bring
the water out?

577
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:03,835
Can I say one thing?
Can I just tell you one thing?

578
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:05,802
Joe Strombel
would not agree with you.

579
00:31:05,873 --> 00:31:08,273
I don't want to talk about
Joe Strombel, all right?

580
00:31:08,342 --> 00:31:10,207
Even a great reporter
can be wrong.

581
00:31:10,344 --> 00:31:12,106
But he's not wrong.

582
00:31:12,178 --> 00:31:13,702
Blackmail.
I see it all over.

583
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,371
You are a cynical
crapehanger

584
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:17,143
who always sees the glass
half-empty!

585
00:31:17,216 --> 00:31:20,310
No, you're wrong.
I see the glass half-full,
but of poison.

586
00:31:20,386 --> 00:31:21,683
And you're gonna wind up
drinking it!

587
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,518
You don't know anything.
You don't have a reporter's
instincts, okay?

588
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,956
You're some guy
who vanishes silk
handkerchiefs

589
00:31:27,026 --> 00:31:28,516
and cuts
people's neckties off.

590
00:31:28,594 --> 00:31:31,256
Do everybody a favor.
Go back to your card tricks,
all right?

591
00:31:38,337 --> 00:31:39,599
Did you tell her?

592
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:41,403
I did. I told her.

593
00:31:41,474 --> 00:31:44,875
And I made it seem
as though it all suddenly
just came to me.

594
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,070
I know I'm right.

595
00:31:46,512 --> 00:31:48,412
She just won't listen to me.
She hates me.

596
00:31:48,481 --> 00:31:49,674
Yeah. I...
You know,

597
00:31:49,748 --> 00:31:52,342
sometimes, I got to say,
I worry about that girl.

598
00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:55,910
I don't think
I'll be seeing you anymore.

599
00:31:56,855 --> 00:31:59,847
Well, if there's a scoop
to be had here,

600
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:01,458
she's going
to get it for you.

601
00:32:01,893 --> 00:32:04,157
You can only cheat death
so many times,

602
00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:06,494
and I've used
every trick I know.

603
00:32:07,098 --> 00:32:09,191
You look after her.
She's a decent kid.

604
00:32:09,768 --> 00:32:13,431
And check
his Tarot deck.
See if a card's missing.

605
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,229
I'm a reporter.

606
00:32:48,305 --> 00:32:52,241
I'm doing a story
on Elizabeth Gibson,
and I know she lived here.

607
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:56,676
I didn't know her.
I hardly ever saw her
come and go. She was quiet.

608
00:32:58,148 --> 00:32:59,445
All right.

609
00:33:00,217 --> 00:33:02,151
I knew
what she did for a living.

610
00:33:02,219 --> 00:33:06,120
But whether she used to
entertain her clients here,
or not, I couldn't say.

611
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:16,254
Oh,
excuse me. I'm a reporter.

612
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:18,098
And I'm doing a story

613
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:21,068
about Elizabeth Gibson.

614
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:23,970
If there's any comments,
anything you know
about her that I...

615
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,704
<i>What paper?
What paper are you from?
The Washington Post.</i>

616
00:33:28,845 --> 00:33:32,246
I'm one of the top reporters
on the...

617
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:35,807
<i>Did you see
All the President's Men?
I was the short guy.</i>

618
00:33:38,354 --> 00:33:41,049
Why is an American paper
interested in this?

619
00:33:41,123 --> 00:33:43,250
No, no, we are, we are.
We're doing a big story.

620
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:46,351
The Travel and Leisure section
is doing a big spread

621
00:33:46,428 --> 00:33:48,396
on places
to avoid like the plague.

622
00:33:48,463 --> 00:33:50,795
And so, I'm...

623
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:55,399
I'll make it
very worth your while,
you know and...

624
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,961
All right, all right,
all right. I knew
Betty Gibson.

625
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,801
Mmm-hmm,
and she was very tough.

626
00:34:01,243 --> 00:34:03,677
But I don't think
that she deserved to die.

627
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,876
Did you say Betty Gibson?

628
00:34:07,282 --> 00:34:10,649
Everyone called her Betty.
That was her name.

629
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,613
Really?
And did you know any
of her clients at all?

630
00:34:17,892 --> 00:34:21,851
I mean, she knew
millions of men, didn't she?
She was very sexy.

631
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:25,729
You know.
Not that you'd know
that from those pictures.

632
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:29,534
She used to be a really
pretty baby-faced blonde.

633
00:34:29,603 --> 00:34:31,730
You know,
the sort men go nuts for.

634
00:34:32,273 --> 00:34:34,366
A blonde? But in the paper...
The pictures in the paper...

635
00:34:34,442 --> 00:34:35,500
Oh, no, I know, I know.

636
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:37,601
She made the mistake
of cutting it off
and dyeing it black.

637
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:39,210
God knows why.

638
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,073
Maybe it's to please
one of her regulars.

639
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:45,078
She had steady clients?

640
00:34:45,853 --> 00:34:47,377
Well, yeah, one for sure.

641
00:34:47,455 --> 00:34:49,946
Look, these guys
never use their
real names, okay?

642
00:34:50,124 --> 00:34:52,854
But there was
this one rich kid
that she saw a lot.

643
00:34:54,227 --> 00:34:56,491
And his name was Peter.

644
00:34:58,498 --> 00:34:59,795
Peter what?

645
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,894
Peter...
Peter Yardley. Peter Yardley?

646
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:04,300
Yardley. Yardley.

647
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:08,805
Hello?
Hello, this is Mr. Spence.

648
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:12,373
Sid.
Sid Waterman Spence.

649
00:35:14,013 --> 00:35:17,414
This is Sid Waterman Spence.
Where have I called?

650
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:21,212
Oh, hello, Sidney.
It's Peter Lyman.

651
00:35:21,521 --> 00:35:25,457
Sondra and I
are spending the weekend
at my father's country house.

652
00:35:25,525 --> 00:35:26,719
You could have come.

653
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,719
That's okay. She gave me
this number to call.
May I speak with her?

654
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:32,889
Yes, one second.

655
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:41,732
Hi, Sidney.

656
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:45,436
Listen,
I got a treasure trove
of information here.

657
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:48,341
I just was snooping with...

658
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:51,107
On Elizabeth Gibson.

659
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:53,874
She's called Betty. Betty!
She's called Betty.

660
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:57,544
And she had some kind of
a long relationship...

661
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:01,252
A special relationship
with some young guy, Peter.

662
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:05,763
The last name
doesn't click,
but I'm sure it's the same.

663
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,727
This is crazy.

664
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,293
Look, stop making trouble,
Sidney. The case is closed.

665
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,802
Listen, this thing adds up.

666
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:19,472
You're alone up there with
a very, very dangerous man.

667
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,202
That's two verys.

668
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,039
You got to get back to town
right away.

669
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,309
Sidney, if I thought there was
a shred of proof,

670
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:29,615
I would never let
my personal feelings
get involved, all right?

671
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,245
The truth is,
I'm crazy about the guy.

672
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:35,019
I can't keep obsessing
over tantalizing
conspiracy theories.

673
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,732
You know, I'm sure
that he killed her

674
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,792
and made it look
like a Tarot killing.

675
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:50,766
You know,
you don't see it because
you got stars in your eyes.

676
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:54,374
Look, I don't...
This is crazy! I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

677
00:36:54,444 --> 00:36:56,105
It's too upsetting for me,
all right?

678
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:57,476
Let me have my nice weekend.

679
00:36:57,547 --> 00:36:58,775
I'll talk to you
when I get back.

680
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:01,043
Stop putting
these paranoid thoughts
in my head!

681
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:04,981
Is Sidney okay?
Yes, yes.

682
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:07,717
You know, I love Sidney,
I really do,

683
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:10,282
but he's just...
He's got a part missing,
you know, he's crazy!

684
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,622
Yes, really?
Mmm-hmm.

685
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:12,719
Like what?

686
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,456
We'll talk about it later.

687
00:37:14,531 --> 00:37:16,055
Let me change, okay?
Mmm-Hmm.

688
00:37:36,852 --> 00:37:38,752
Yes? Oh, yes, sir.

689
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:43,349
Yes. My daughter
is in the country
with Mr. Lyman.

690
00:37:43,425 --> 00:37:46,553
And I'm gonna
be driving up there later
and she asked me

691
00:37:46,629 --> 00:37:49,860
if I could pick up her red
cashmere sweater. She thinks
she left it upstairs.

692
00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:51,024
Red cashmere?

693
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,728
Yes, it's a red sweater.
It's a kind of a red,
tomato red,

694
00:37:53,802 --> 00:37:55,861
<i>like a fire engine.
A red. A rouge.</i>

695
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:58,735
I understand, sir. Red.
Yes, yes.

696
00:37:58,806 --> 00:38:00,637
I'll see if I can find it.

697
00:39:05,072 --> 00:39:06,403
Sir?

698
00:39:06,506 --> 00:39:09,600
Oh, I was just
checking out the Stradivarius.

699
00:39:10,744 --> 00:39:16,010
<i>I play a few pieces myself
on the violin. Prokofiev
and Bartok, the Hot Canary...</i>

700
00:39:16,082 --> 00:39:19,381
But Mr. Lyman is the
only person to have the
combination to that room.

701
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:22,387
Yes, but he wanted
to share it with me
because, you know,

702
00:39:22,455 --> 00:39:23,922
in case something happened,

703
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:25,923
you know,
life is very capricious.

704
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:29,586
A stroke, a sudden embolism
or lightning...
You know I...

705
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:31,954
Darling, I love you.
I mean that sincerely.

706
00:39:32,031 --> 00:39:35,330
You're a wonderful woman,
you're a tremendous servant
and a credit to your race.

707
00:39:35,401 --> 00:39:37,596
And I mean that. From
the bottom of my heart
I say that to you.

708
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,194
I notice you didn't
get the red sweater.

709
00:39:39,271 --> 00:39:40,932
She probably left it
in another bedroom.

710
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:43,201
You know,
she's got a little problem
with promiscuity.

711
00:39:43,275 --> 00:39:44,435
But...

712
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:47,874
So, I'll be going.
I'll call you.
We'll have lunch.

713
00:39:56,154 --> 00:40:00,523
Mr. Lyman, sir, Mr. Spence
has been here and he's
been into the music room.

714
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:02,589
What do you mean?

715
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,852
A most unusual
sequence of events.

716
00:40:04,929 --> 00:40:07,193
Mr. Spence came by
looking for his
daughter's sweater.

717
00:40:07,265 --> 00:40:08,755
Said she'd requested it.

718
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:11,063
Next thing I knew,
he was in the music room.

719
00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:14,060
Sir, I think
he'd been drinking,
from his behavior.

720
00:40:15,006 --> 00:40:17,304
Yes, yes.

721
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:20,503
Yes. Okay, Margaret,
thank you. Goodbye.

722
00:40:21,646 --> 00:40:22,806
Is everything okay?

723
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:25,748
Yes.
Yes, it will be.

724
00:41:40,922 --> 00:41:43,914
It's so nice
to be out here with you,
just away

725
00:41:44,926 --> 00:41:47,360
from the rest of the world
and...
Hmm.

726
00:41:47,429 --> 00:41:51,923
Yes, I often
come out here to read and,
well, and fish.

727
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,490
There's trout in the lake.

728
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,934
What are you thinking about?

729
00:42:05,113 --> 00:42:06,705
You really want to know?
Yes.

730
00:42:09,217 --> 00:42:11,879
Just how ironic life is,
and tragic.

731
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,682
Why?

732
00:42:14,256 --> 00:42:16,850
Well, that I met you
by rescuing you from drowning

733
00:42:17,658 --> 00:42:19,489
and found you
totally enchanting

734
00:42:20,628 --> 00:42:24,086
and now we've come full cycle
and, alas, you're going
to have to drown.

735
00:42:27,134 --> 00:42:28,226
What?

736
00:42:28,669 --> 00:42:31,763
Oh, I imagine by now
Sidney's confirmed
that I killed Betty Gibson.

737
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,433
I mean, in my own defense,
there really was
no other way out.

738
00:42:35,476 --> 00:42:37,774
At first I managed
to hide my identity from her,

739
00:42:37,845 --> 00:42:40,006
but I saw her too many times
over the years

740
00:42:41,282 --> 00:42:43,045
and she learned who I was,
and...

741
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:45,745
Well, it became
a constant demand for money

742
00:42:45,819 --> 00:42:48,049
and I just
could not let that go on,
could I?

743
00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:51,080
I mean, my whole life
and career

744
00:42:51,158 --> 00:42:53,991
would be
just hostage to her
moods at all times.

745
00:42:56,229 --> 00:42:58,459
So, I studied
the Tarot case,

746
00:42:58,531 --> 00:43:00,863
I rehearsed my plan,
and, well, you know the rest.

747
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:02,867
If you do something to me,
Sidney's gonna find out!

748
00:43:02,936 --> 00:43:04,062
He'll tell someone.

749
00:43:04,137 --> 00:43:06,697
No, no, no.
You see, you will go
in a boating accident,

750
00:43:06,773 --> 00:43:08,468
and Sidney will go
later tonight.

751
00:43:08,908 --> 00:43:11,069
No one knows
of your relationship with him,

752
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:14,036
because, after all,
you're not actually father
and daughter, are you?

753
00:43:14,781 --> 00:43:17,841
And no one will think twice
to investigate the death
of some obscure vaud...

754
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:19,145
Are you listening?

755
00:43:19,452 --> 00:43:21,317
No one will think twice
to investigate the death

756
00:43:21,387 --> 00:43:24,948
of some obscure vaudevillian
called Splendini, who is
really a stranger to me.

757
00:43:25,692 --> 00:43:26,716
Help!

758
00:43:26,793 --> 00:43:28,556
Help! Someone help me!

759
00:43:37,502 --> 00:43:39,094
Yes, very quiet, isn't it?

760
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:44,432
This is the advantage
of a private lake.

761
00:43:48,547 --> 00:43:50,515
Get off me!
Get off me!

762
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:53,577
Get off me!
Come...

763
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:14,556
Yes, police.

764
00:45:16,232 --> 00:45:19,633
Yes, this is Peter Lyman.
I need the police immediately.

765
00:45:20,203 --> 00:45:22,193
At the Lyman estate.

766
00:45:22,705 --> 00:45:26,300
There's been
a terrible boating accident.
A woman has drowned.

767
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:28,070
It's awful.
Please come right away.

768
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:29,633
Thank you. Thank you.

769
00:45:36,552 --> 00:45:38,247
They think they know
where the body is.

770
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,922
I'm so sorry, sir.

771
00:45:44,093 --> 00:45:45,822
When last I saw her,
she...

772
00:45:49,565 --> 00:45:52,056
She just said she wanted
to go out there to
communicate with nature.

773
00:45:53,602 --> 00:45:55,536
Just to think
she wanted some
peace and quiet and...

774
00:45:55,971 --> 00:45:57,996
She wasn't depressed,
or anything like that,
was she, sir?

775
00:45:58,073 --> 00:45:59,062
God, no. No.

776
00:45:59,407 --> 00:46:01,602
I mean, unless she was
keeping it from me.

777
00:46:01,876 --> 00:46:03,537
You heard no cries for help?

778
00:46:03,611 --> 00:46:07,069
No! No,
I was listening to music
in here, damn it.

779
00:46:07,782 --> 00:46:09,374
It's just so ironic.

780
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,576
Because the way
I first met her

781
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:12,881
I rescued her
from drowning
in our club pool.

782
00:46:12,954 --> 00:46:15,445
And she was a very,
very weak swimmer.

783
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,350
Hello?

784
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:21,117
I was faking it at the pool
to get your attention.

785
00:46:21,496 --> 00:46:24,556
Actually, I used to be
captain of the Brooklyn
Community Swim Team.

786
00:46:39,446 --> 00:46:41,004
Fascinating observation.

787
00:46:41,181 --> 00:46:43,775
Lyman lost a cufflink
at the flat of a prostitute,

788
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:46,318
who was later killed
by the Tarot Card Killer.

789
00:46:47,487 --> 00:46:51,014
Well, this upright chap
certainly enjoyed patronizing
some dodgy women.

790
00:46:51,491 --> 00:46:55,052
Unfortunately
for Elizabeth Gibson,
she elected to blackmail him.

791
00:46:56,429 --> 00:46:58,454
It's a beautifully
written story

792
00:46:58,598 --> 00:47:02,466
and one of the best bits
of investigative journalism
in a long time.

793
00:47:02,836 --> 00:47:04,804
And this paper
is proud to run it.

794
00:47:04,871 --> 00:47:07,271
Oh, I have to
share the credit
with Joe Strombel.

795
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:08,598
An inspiration,

796
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:11,041
who taught me more
than I could ever
explain to anyone.

797
00:47:11,111 --> 00:47:13,874
And to the late
Sidney Waterman.

798
00:47:14,613 --> 00:47:15,739
Splendini.

799
00:47:15,881 --> 00:47:18,611
A nice guy who helped out
with the investigation

800
00:47:18,684 --> 00:47:21,312
and without whom
I never could have made it.

801
00:47:22,721 --> 00:47:25,212
Sidney, wherever you are,

802
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:27,791
I'll never forget you.

803
00:47:30,162 --> 00:47:31,026
How did you get here?

804
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:32,488
Me?

805
00:47:32,598 --> 00:47:36,295
I couldn't get used to driving
on the goddamn wrong
side of the street!

806
00:47:36,368 --> 00:47:38,359
You know,
I was driving up
to the country,

807
00:47:38,437 --> 00:47:41,372
and in the United States,
I would have been a hero.
I would have saved her.

808
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,429
I would have...

809
00:47:42,508 --> 00:47:45,033
But here, you know...
That's the one drawback
of living in London.

810
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:48,238
Granted, the theater's better,
there's many good
Indian restaurants.

811
00:47:48,314 --> 00:47:49,508
Well, what did you do?

812
00:47:49,615 --> 00:47:52,174
What do I do?
I'm Splendini. Magician.

813
00:47:53,384 --> 00:47:55,352
Would you like
to see something?
Oh, yes, please.

814
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,081
Do we have time
for a card trick?
Yes.

815
00:47:57,155 --> 00:47:58,850
I believe we have eternity.

816
00:47:58,923 --> 00:48:01,289
I'm going to show you
a little trick now.

817
00:48:01,759 --> 00:48:04,523
I just want to say
from the bottom of my heart,
I mean this sincerely...

818
00:48:05,196 --> 00:48:06,561
I say this
with all due respect.

819
00:48:06,631 --> 00:48:09,293
You are a wonderful group and
a fantastic group of people.

820
00:48:09,367 --> 00:48:12,029
I love you and I feel that
coming back from you.

821
00:48:12,103 --> 00:48:16,437
And you may be deceased,
but you should not
be discouraged.

822
00:48:16,507 --> 00:48:17,838
Because, you know...

823
00:48:17,909 --> 00:48:20,469
Don't think of being dead
as a handicap.

824
00:48:20,545 --> 00:48:22,672
You know,
when I was a child,
I stuttered.

825
00:48:22,747 --> 00:48:25,147
But with stick-to-it-iveness
and perseverance,

826
00:48:25,216 --> 00:48:27,183
you know, you can never tell
what could happen.

827
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:28,684
Now, I want you
to take a card, Alma.

828
00:48:28,752 --> 00:48:30,014
Go ahead,
take any card you want.

829
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:31,782
Just pick it. Pick it.
Go ahead, sweetheart.

830
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:33,584
<i>I love you, sweetheart.
That's fantastic.</i>

831
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:33,584
