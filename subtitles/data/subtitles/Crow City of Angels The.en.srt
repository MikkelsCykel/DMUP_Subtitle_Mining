00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:37,917
I believe there is a place
where the restless souls wander.

2
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,859
Burdened by the weight
of their own sadness,

3
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,624
they wait for a chance
to set the wrong things right.

4
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:50,294
Only then can they be reunited
with the ones they love.

5
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,000
Sometimes a crow
shows them the way.

6
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:00,311
- Because sometimes...

7
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,213
- Iove is stronger than death.

8
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:25,404
- It's not your fault.

9
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:29,237
- No, no, no.
- We didn't see.

10
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:35,036
Let him go!
He's just a kid!

11
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,378
He can't hurt you!

12
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,977
I'm scared, Dad.
Please, Dad, I'm sorry.

13
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,952
- No!

14
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,169
Gabriel...

15
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,176
it's been a long night.

16
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:11,850
Caressing the marble
and stone

17
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,789
Caressing the marble
and stone

18
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:26,697
Ah, love that was
special for one

19
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:35,774
The waste in the fever I feel

20
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:42,546
How I wish you were
here with me now

21
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,247
They call this
"The City of Angels,"

22
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:56,091
but all I see around me
are victims.

23
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,995
It's the city of drugs...

24
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,829
and of darkness.

25
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,734
The city ofJudah Earl.

26
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,707
Got a name?

27
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,342
Grace. So what?

28
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,748
My name is Sarah.

29
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:35,730
Listen, Grace, maybe you want
to get some hot coffee...

30
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:39,898
and a little bit of food.

31
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,906
What do you want?

32
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,609
Nothing.

33
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,911
Do you want to eat here?

34
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,578
We all have our pleasures.

35
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,516
For some, it's the flesh.

36
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,749
And we provide for them.

37
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,586
For others, it's the drugs.

38
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:36,321
- And we provide for them too.

39
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,661
Our products feed this entire city.

40
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,629
While other kingdoms fall around us,

41
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:48,504
we've succeeded...

42
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:52,032
by being of a single mind.

43
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,810
Succeeded with guidance
from a darker world, Judah.

44
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,812
Do you love me, Sibyl?

45
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,689
All must love you.

46
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,693
Really?

47
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:13,721
Then why did this sad-eyed
sack of shit betray me?

48
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,166
Hey, well, l...

49
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,864
Hey, l-l-l-I didn't
betray you, Judah.

50
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,407
L-l-I did it for
the business, you know?

51
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,103
I mean, this last...
Batch of yours,

52
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:29,012
it was bad...
it was a hot mix.

53
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,811
I mean, Jesus Christ, Judah,

54
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,581
it was given 'em seizures...
whoa, get away.

55
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,146
Hey, Judah, your...

56
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,886
your brand...

57
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,520
It should inspire trust, right?

58
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,191
I mean, come on, we can't kill off
all the motherfuckers, huh?

59
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,497
I mean, hey, whoa, there'd be
no one left to buy the shit.

60
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,370
So you destroyed 80 keys
of product without my consent.

61
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,374
Hey, hey, back off!

62
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,910
Get the fuck away from me!

63
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,004
Look at this, Judah. You're surrounded
by these fuckin' freaks, man!

64
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:05,448
You don't even leave
this fun house anymore, man!

65
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,385
I mean, you have no idea what
the shit is doing to people...

66
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,388
out on the streets, man.

67
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,822
It could ruin your fix with the cops.
I'm not bullshittin'.

68
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,293
I mean, it's bad
for business, huh?

69
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,433
All right, then.

70
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,436
Let's see how bad
this batch of ours really is.

71
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,596
Hey! Whoa! Hey!

72
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,800
What the fuck
is goin' on?

73
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,572
We're volunteering you
for a little quality control.

74
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:36,581
Oh, jeez, Judah.
I'll make it up to you, I swear!

75
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:41,052
But you are. Weren't you
listening before, Bassett?

76
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,715
I said we all have
our pleasures.

77
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,054
Mine is the pain of others.

78
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,503
Guess you were right, Bassett.

79
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,670
That was a bad batch.

80
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,743
- Whoo!

81
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,357
I'm almost done.

82
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,724
- Are you okay?
- It stings a little.

83
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,764
That's why they call me
the mistress of pain.

84
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,061
I'll get the other book
out for you.

85
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,796
Let's see this masterpiece.
Go ahead, turn around.

86
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,532
Whew. Spin 'round a little.

87
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:37,269
Ho, ho, ho. There's nothin'
I can do for you, luv.

88
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,741
Christ, what a downer!

89
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,750
Some kid asked me to tattoo,

90
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,787
"If you can read this,
you're standin' too close."

91
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,084
Right on her bum.

92
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,148
I tell ya, I've had it.

93
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,319
Well, it's better than
pushing ink in Detroit.

94
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,556
Well, you can say
that again, darlin'.

95
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,826
You can say that again.

96
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,834
- I got a little present for you.
- You did?

97
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,394
They do them for
the Day of the Dead.

98
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,497
Thank you.

99
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,509
"Necrophagia,"darlin'...
eat the dead.

100
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,775
"Life is just a dream
on the way to death."

101
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,388
I like that.

102
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,890
Do you want to come
have a beer, girl?

103
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,892
Um, no, I can't.

104
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,760
I gotta go home. I haven't been
getting that much sleep lately.

105
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,391
And what is
the dirty dog's name?

106
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,402
No, I've just...

107
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,429
I've just been having these
really, really strange dreams.

108
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,885
I know.

109
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,483
Sleep with angels.

110
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,179
Sleep with angels.

111
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,600
- Did l...

112
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,870
No!

113
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,830
Talk to me, Sibyl.
Tell me what you see.

114
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:35,165
I see death returning
from the vale of tears.

115
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,800
Look at them down there,

116
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:43,315
swarming through
the streets like insects.

117
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,579
It's the same each year, isn't it?

118
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,086
Lighting their little candles.

119
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,089
Whispering their wasted prayers.

120
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,216
This time is different, Judah.

121
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:58,787
This time someone is coming for you.

122
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,666
He has your name
on his tongue.

123
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,662
It's finally
beginning, isn't it?

124
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,833
What mask will death wear?

125
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,843
Can you tell me that?

126
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:18,073
I see the face
of one of your victims.

127
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,354
All my sins remembered.

128
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:32,325
Now we're gonna be
face to face

129
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,760
And I lay right down
in my favorite place

130
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,340
Now I wanna be your dog

131
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:51,213
Now I wanna be your dog

132
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,844
Now I wanna be your dog

133
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,961
Ah, come on

134
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,900
Spider Monkey!

135
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,168
- What's this tattoo look like to you?
- This is a test?

136
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,108
- Come on, man! Tell me what you see!

137
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,669
- Come on!
- A bird.

138
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,749
Think about this!
Think! Think!

139
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:30,414
- Don't you see two demons?
- No.

140
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,118
I see a bird.

141
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:38,926
- Fuck you, you fucking fool!

142
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:45,001
And what's this
in your ear?

143
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,838
Toro, toro!

144
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,932
- Ole!

145
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,911
Look.

146
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:26,137
- Who are you?
- Sarah.

147
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,482
I had a dream about you.

148
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:39,581
I saw them shoot you
and your son.

149
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,791
I saw you drowning.

150
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,092
How did I survive?

151
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,758
You didn't.

152
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,338
- You're dead.
- No!

153
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,636
No!

154
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,472
This isn't real.

155
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,173
None of this is real.

156
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,272
No!

157
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,018
Where will we go

158
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,265
Oh, where will we go

159
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,200
This ghost follows

160
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,207
Ah, yes

161
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,482
- Danny! What are you doing?
- Hmm?

162
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:49,647
- You think you're a man? Come on.
- Yes.

163
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,917
Defense, defense.
The face, the face.

164
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,655
- Yeah, yeah, good.
- Aah! Help!

165
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,664
Want to do bullfighting?
Huh? Do the bull.

166
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,701
- Come on.
- Okay. Uuh!

167
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,224
Danny.

168
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,010
Hey, Dad.

169
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,570
- Yeah?
- Look, I made this.

170
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,116
- Who are they?
- These people?

171
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,049
- Yeah.
- That's you and me.

172
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,452
That's me? And the thing
on top over there?

173
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,922
That?
That's a blue sun.

174
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,688
- A blue sun?
- Yeah, a blue sun.

175
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,523
What was that?

176
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,795
Danny, stay here!

177
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,974
Danny!

178
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,544
Come here.
Come here.

179
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,083
Danny!

180
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,484
See no evil.

181
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:40,691
- No! No!
- You can run.

182
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,256
Run! Run! Uuh!

183
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,395
No! No!

184
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,869
No! No!

185
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,413
No! Danny!

186
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,630
No!

187
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,439
Leave him alone!

188
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,169
- Dad!

189
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,803
No-o-o! No!

190
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,099
I want to help you.

191
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,481
Danny.

192
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,915
He's not here anymore.

193
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,481
I know.

194
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,502
What's your name?

195
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,242
Ashe.

196
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,272
There's a reason why you've been
brought back, Ashe.

197
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,777
To find the people
who did this to us.

198
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,788
To make them pay.

199
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,682
These were Danny's paints,
weren't they?

200
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,501
Hey, old man
Got something for you

201
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,313
- Change your mind
Gonna make you take it

202
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,754
- Your mistake
is something you own

203
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:04,356
And I'm the one
who's gonna take it

204
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,496
Hey, old man
Got something for you

205
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,900
Got something for you
Got something for you

206
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,495
Hey, old man
Got a real good tip

207
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,269
- Got a real good tip

208
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,368
- Something's wrong
and you don't know it

209
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,777
You don't know it
You don't know it

210
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,908
When will you learn

211
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:32,379
I'm not your boy

212
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,717
You don't look back

213
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:44,864
Why do I pick up
your slack, man

214
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:55,510
When will you learn

215
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,382
I'm not your boy

216
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,014
Hey, old man
Got something for you

217
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,321
Gonna...

218
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:39,150
- Ahh!

219
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,658
- Ooh!

220
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:44,524
- Olé!

221
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,799
- Whoop!

222
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,812
- Toro!

223
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,905
- Ah-ha-ha-ha!

224
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,694
Who the fuck are you?

225
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:25,202
- Does the corpse have a familiar face?

226
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,909
- Flowers for the dead, señor?

227
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:37,038
We killed you, man.
You're dead!

228
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:40,676
- Sorry to disappoint you.
- Whoo-oo-oo!

229
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:47,015
Stop wasting your breath, angelito.
There's nobody out there listening.

230
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:51,529
- Yee-aagh!
- I'm all your nightmares...
rolled into one!

231
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,696
- Wuh-aah!

232
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,505
Aa-aa-aah!

233
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,443
Oh, geez! No way, man!

234
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,694
- Fuck! Oh!

235
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,760
This shit's flammable, man.

236
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:36,102
- The others. Who are they?

237
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,409
- Huh?
- Nemo,

238
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,310
- Hmm.
- Kali, Curve and Judah.

239
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,349
- I'll start with Nemo...

240
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,816
And then work my way
up the food chain.

241
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,013
- Where is he?
- Nemo?

242
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,283
- Mm-hmm.
- He's an old pervert.

243
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:57,124
He hangs out at the Peep-O-Rama
on Deacon Street.

244
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,822
Congratulations, Monkey!

245
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,798
You just bought yourself
a fighting chance!

246
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,936
Pick a card, Monkey.

247
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,938
Come on.

248
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,845
Come on.

249
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:31,159
Lady Luck's... a bitch.

250
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,925
Oh...

251
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,626
Jesus, man. Come on, man.

252
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,635
Come on, come on, come on.

253
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,269
You're wasting your breath,
angelito.

254
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:48,337
- Nobody's up there listening.

255
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,657
I want to be your
Be your rubber ball

256
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,662
- I want to be the one

257
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,824
You love the most of all

258
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,959
Oh, yeah

259
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:15,864
- I'm your boogie man, boogie man

260
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,101
Turn me on

261
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:21,543
I'm your boogie man, boogie man
I'll do what you want

262
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,377
I'm your boogie man
Boogie man

263
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,713
Turn me on
I'm your boogie man

264
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,005
Ohh...

265
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:03,906
I got bad news. Someone torched
the lab on Manchester.

266
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,473
Spider Monkey's
a fucking crispy critter.

267
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,714
Monkey I could care less about.
What about our merchandise?

268
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:13,416
- It's a total loss.
- He left a sign, didn't he?

269
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,891
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

270
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,654
Yes, you do.

271
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:20,186
You've seen it.
You've been marked.

272
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:24,200
Jesus Christ. Judah, why the fuck
do you listen to her?

273
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:27,066
Because she speaks the truth.

274
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,407
What's this, Curve?

275
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,773
A beauty mark?

276
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:39,277
And all the world
will be in love with night.

277
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,411
And pay no worship
to the garish sun.

278
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,958
- Noah?
- Yeah.

279
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,957
Do you believe in fate?

280
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:01,505
Seems to me it's a question
of... fate believin' in you.

281
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,939
- We're closed for the night!

282
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,447
- Open the fucking door!

283
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,981
I said, we're closed. Aah!

284
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,987
- Fucker!

285
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,190
- Think what you did to me was funny?
- God...

286
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,192
- Some kind of joke? Huh?
- Stop! It hurts me!

287
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,885
Huh? Huh?

288
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,895
I don't know what
you're talking about.

289
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:29,160
I'm talkin' about this fuckin' tattoo
you gave me! Look at this shit!

290
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,633
- It's a crow.
- You're goddamn right it's a crow.

291
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,136
Did I ask you for
a fuckin' bird on my chest? Did I?

292
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,901
I was going from the fucking design
that you gave me!

293
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,534
Stop it! Stop it!

294
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,544
O-Oh!

295
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,681
Well, what's it gonna be, hero?

296
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,344
Ready to kiss your faggot ass
good-bye?

297
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,879
I think you're shittin' yourself,
you're so goddamn ready.

298
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,425
Fuck you!
Uuh!

299
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,796
- You fucking piece of shit!

300
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:04,357
- Aah!
- Get up.

301
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:08,769
- Girl to girl sincerity

302
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,707
Remains

303
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,176
Awkwardly unnamed

304
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:22,350
- You never kissed
- I'll be seein' you...

305
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,581
- These girlfriend
- sugarplum.

306
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,816
- Lips

307
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:32,954
Simple choice to fall away
Fall away

308
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:36,557
Away, away, away

309
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:40,695
Away

310
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,705
Why is the world

311
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,310
- Falling on me
- Are you okay?

312
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,974
Well, fuck me. What are they
going to be snorting next?

313
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:54,211
- I can't take this anymore.

314
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,219
Don't worry, love.

315
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,256
Everything'll work itself out.

316
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,351
Did she make
you cry, make you break down

317
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,859
- Aah!
- And shatter your illusions of love

318
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,091
- Fuckin' shit, motherfucker!

319
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,334
Smile, sister.

320
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,530
- Whoo! Hey!

321
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,542
This is a recording.

322
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,703
- Tokens for the bunny booths.

323
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,339
- Live girls.

324
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:00,646
- Tokens for the bunny booths.

325
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,710
- Live girls.
- It's his wreck. It's all right.

326
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,722
What up, Zeke?

327
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,020
Right.
How ya doin', man?

328
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,822
This is for you.
For you.

329
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,788
You got a name?

330
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,415
- Holly Daze.
- Put your hands in the air

331
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:43,824
Tonight is a special night

332
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,124
- You want me, baby?
- Put your hands in the air

333
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:49,530
Tonight is a special night
Check this one

334
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,032
Oh...

335
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,194
Throw your hands
in the air tonight

336
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,931
Uh... I wanna see some sugar.

337
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,735
Check me out, Pop
Throw your hands high in the air

338
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:57,068
Sugar?

339
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,473
- Right on, sister.

340
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:07,140
Mmm. Is that for me?

341
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,152
Oh, yeah.

342
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,451
Yeah.

343
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:15,788
We're gonna celebrate Christmas
a little early this year.

344
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:27,001
Mmm. Keep doin' that, baby,
you're gonna go blind.

345
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,268
- Fuck! Fuck!

346
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,584
Oh, yes!

347
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:47,051
Time's almost up, lover.

348
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,887
Hurry with those tokens.

349
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,120
- Oh, shit, man!

350
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,301
Come on!

351
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,305
Bitch!

352
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,800
Come on, fucker!
Come on, fucker!

353
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,553
Do you want me...

354
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,149
baby?

355
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,391
You...

356
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,396
Me.

357
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,795
- Hey! Fuckin'mime boy!

358
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,739
- Uuh!

359
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,373
One crow, sorrow.

360
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,382
Two crows...

361
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,714
joy!

362
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,687
- Three crows...
- Oh, ah!

363
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,385
A letter!

364
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,762
- Four crows...
- Uuh!

365
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,391
- Uuh! Aah!
- A boy.

366
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,402
- Let him go! He's just a child.

367
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,940
Uuh! Uh! Aah!

368
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:15,105
- Five crows, silver!
- Aah!

369
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,374
- Six crows, gold!

370
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:21,748
Seven crows,
a secret never to be told!

371
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,879
Aah! Stop the fuck...
Aah! Please!

372
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,889
No, please!

373
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:32,088
- Please, just stop! I can't...
- Look at me!

374
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:35,394
Lights! Camera! Action!

375
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,526
- Aah!
- You killed my son, Nemo.

376
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,230
You took away the only
piece of light left in my soul.

377
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:45,036
We had to! We had to!
It wasn't our fault!

378
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:49,170
Was Judah's orders.
Never leave any witnesses.

379
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:52,340
We didn't have any choice.

380
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,907
We always have a choice!

381
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,857
- Tokens for the bunny booths.
- Go, let's go!

382
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:06,158
- Live girls.
- Ow! Yeah!

383
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,960
- Tokens for the bunny booths.
- Let's go!

384
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,763
- Live girls.

385
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,566
- Tokens for the bunny booths.

386
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,072
Live girls.

387
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,575
Tokens for the bunny booths.

388
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,512
Live girls.

389
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,641
Tokens for the bunny booths.
Live...

390
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,116
In my room I want you here

391
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:35,519
Now we're gonna be
face to face

392
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:43,396
And I lay right down in my
favorite place

393
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,365
Holy fuck.

394
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:19,525
Do you know what they call
a gathering of crows... Curve?

395
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,401
- A murder.

396
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:26,102
A murder of crows.

397
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,974
Think about it.

398
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,858
Can I help you?

399
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,005
I'm sorry, Father.

400
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:35,511
I was just watching.

401
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,513
Our doors were open.

402
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,783
What's all this for?

403
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:43,820
Dia de los Muertos.
Day of the Dead.

404
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,820
We light candles
for our loved ones...

405
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,017
so they might find their way
back to Earth.

406
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,288
Tomorrow night
we will celebrate.

407
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:55,492
The people will dance and sing
and some will wear masks.

408
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,003
Why?

409
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:05,442
Some spirits
linger here too long.

410
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:08,342
They become confused,

411
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:10,642
mistaking themselves
for the living.

412
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,815
They must be
frightened away.

413
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:19,754
Santa Muerte.
Santa Muerte.

414
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,553
No soporte.
No lo soporte.

415
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:27,094
Santa Muerte.
No soporte.

416
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,904
Maybe there is another way.

417
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:20,514
- How... How'd you do that?
- Magic.

418
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,022
Blow on it.
Go on.

419
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,024
Like birthday candles.

420
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,364
You have power
just like I do.

421
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:43,205
You have power over this.

422
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,628
That's him!

423
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:08,631
That's the son of a bitch I dumped
off the pier, I know it.

424
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,929
I saw you kill him.

425
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:14,630
Look, you wanna tell yourself
some bullshit fairy tales,
that's your business.

426
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:18,368
- I'm not gonna sit here with
a fuckin'target on my chest.

427
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,535
I'm gonna take
this motherfucker out.

428
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:25,446
You won't stop him
with guns or knives.

429
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,851
He doesn't feel pain.

430
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:44,264
His soul has crossed over.

431
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:47,929
So how do you stop a man
who's already dead?

432
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:51,736
Can you look Destiny
in the eye...

433
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,970
without flinching?

434
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,980
You tell me.

435
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:09,487
The crow
is his source of power;

436
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,519
his link between this world
and the next.

437
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:18,728
Sever that link, and he's
as vulnerable as the next man.

438
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,293
You came back.

439
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,772
Were you married?

440
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:03,469
My ring...
It belonged to some friends.

441
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,981
Where are they now?

442
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,987
A better place.

443
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,825
What about you?

444
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:20,623
Danny's mother left
after he was born.

445
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,899
She was a drug addict.

446
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:30,896
You knocked me out

447
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:34,205
Bit my lip

448
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,712
- You held me down
- What happens to me...

449
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,613
- And kept me sober
- when I finish what
I'm supposed to do here?

450
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,850
Through all this time

451
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,085
- You go back.

452
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:50,718
With no regret

453
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:55,197
Guess that's just the way
I liked it

454
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,494
- Ooo
- And what if I don't want to go back?

455
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:03,198
- Oh whoa-oa

456
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:18,154
That tattoo on your chest...
Who gave it to you?

457
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:21,657
Some bitch down at the Gargoyle.
What's that got to do with anything?

458
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:25,320
Everything, you idiot!
Find her.

459
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:28,853
If she gave you his mark,
she's connected to him in some way.

460
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,594
She can lead us to him.
Fool!

461
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:47,480
Mm-aah!
What do you people want?

462
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,421
A house in the country.

463
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,093
A little dog.

464
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,363
A wife.

465
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,256
Two kids...

466
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:08,100
- and your fucking head
stapled to my pussy seat.

467
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,907
- Listen...

468
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,206
We're only looking for Sarah.

469
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,473
Where is she, Noah?

470
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:19,845
I ain't gonna tell you that.

471
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:28,447
- I wish I could lose control

472
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:34,828
- But I think you are.
- I wish I could let go

473
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,168
I'm cumming on you

474
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:41,204
I'm cumming, I'm cumming
I'm cumming on you

475
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:41,965
Last chance, love.

476
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,975
- Go fuck yourself, you dried-up bitch!

477
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,171
I'm cumming, I'm cumming
I'm cumming on you

478
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:52,010
I'm cumming, I'm cumming
I'm cumming on you

479
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:31,178
I took Danny last summer.

480
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:34,485
We went up on the bike.

481
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,583
Rode all the way up the coast.

482
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:42,322
It was cold, I remember.

483
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:43,866
We could see our breath.

484
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,842
Look at me.

485
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:04,486
Ashe?

486
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,323
L-Look at me.

487
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:12,555
No. No.

488
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,831
We can't do this.

489
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,303
I have to find the others.

490
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,741
I have to finish what I started.

491
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:34,776
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

492
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:37,244
- Look.
- Who are they?

493
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,748
- These people down here?
- Yeah.

494
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,750
That's you and me.

495
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,154
Sleep with angels.

496
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:52,053
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to look.
- It's not your fault.

497
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,392
- Lights!
- Look at me! It's not your fault.
You understand?

498
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:57,865
Action! Action!
Flowers for the dead, señor?

499
00:53:57,934 --> 00:53:59,959
- No!

500
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:02,561
Stop wasting your breath, angelito.

501
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,905
Let him get out! Let him alone!
He's just a kid!

502
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:10,140
- What about the kid?

503
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:14,309
Pain is my power.
Kill them both.

504
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:16,352
Let him alone!

505
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:19,320
Let him alone!
He's just a kid!

506
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,914
- He doesn't even know who you are.

507
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:25,951
- Don't, please, don't.
- Hush, little baby
Please don't cry

508
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,429
I beg you!
I beg you, please!

509
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:33,026
- Kali's gonna give you
eternal life
- Don't! No! Aah!

510
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:36,539
- No! Aah!

511
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,040
- Nothing personal, sport.

512
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:45,977
I guess you were just in the wrong
place... at the wrong time. Heh!

513
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,950
Dump 'em!

514
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,667
Ah! Hah!

515
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:22,327
Sarah's gone.

516
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:25,704
Ghost man.

517
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,107
Where is she?

518
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:34,844
You took my son's life.

519
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:38,684
Some people are
just born victims.

520
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,715
Hush, little baby
Please don't cry

521
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,319
Do you know how to fight?

522
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:49,957
Do you know how to die?

523
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:55,402
- Yah!

524
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,248
- Come on.

525
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,419
Hah!

526
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,756
- Hi! Hah!

527
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:41,948
- Do you want to dance?

528
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:47,178
- Kali's gonna give you eternal...

529
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:04,139
Hah! Ah!

530
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:07,773
- Ah!

531
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:28,491
Hush, little baby...

532
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,499
Shh.

533
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,570
Don't say a word.

534
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,682
N... No!

535
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,585
Daddy's gonna buy you
a big, black bird!

536
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:20,916
When I first heard the sound

537
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,816
I couldn't put it down

538
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,991
It made my life complete

539
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,994
Ah, give it to me.
Yeah.

540
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,864
Ain't it neat

541
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,435
And you know
I like it when you

542
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:45,406
- Spit

543
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:50,944
Oh, I like it when you

544
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,884
Spit

545
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:57,886
- Naughty boy!

546
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:00,684
- And when you do that

547
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:05,391
You know I'm getting wet

548
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,965
- Wear me on your head

549
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:13,264
Yeah, that's what I said

550
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:17,932
I wanna be
your rock and roll

551
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:22,410
I wanna be
your rock and roll

552
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:28,144
You know I wanna be your
push and pull and it's only 'cause

553
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:34,687
I like it, whoo

554
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:38,716
Girl, I like it

555
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:42,128
Whoo, girl I like it

556
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,894
- Oh, yeah

557
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,731
Waaahh!

558
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:56,711
Nothing personal,

559
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:59,213
sport.

560
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,876
- Hey!

561
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,877
- Look out!

562
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,162
Ow!

563
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:51,223
Fuck you, bird dick!

564
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,960
Time's up, Curve!

565
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:56,971
My naked cousin

566
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,132
I see him running

567
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:01,142
All over his land

568
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:06,204
- Scared as a chick-a-chicken

569
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:09,479
His naked skin fries

570
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:12,214
Fries in the sun

571
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,279
But my, my naked cousin

572
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:17,485
Can cook 'til
he's good, good and done

573
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,494
He's running

574
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:25,493
He's running

575
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:56,162
He's running

576
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:00,596
Baby, he's running

577
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,602
He's running

578
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,781
He's running

579
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:18,820
He's running

580
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,501
Yeah!

581
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:25,052
Wrong place.
Wrong time.

582
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,524
Eh, Curve?

583
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:38,096
Do you think
I'm afraid of you?

584
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:42,604
You fucking freak!
Do you think I'm afraid?

585
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:46,039
- You think I'm afraid!

586
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,943
Can you hear me, Curve?

587
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:31,452
You're going to die now.

588
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:41,129
People used to put coins
in the mouths of the dead.

589
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,132
Do you know why?

590
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:51,199
So they could pay the ferryman
to take them across the river Styx.

591
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,214
What's this?

592
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,794
Open your mouth, Curve.

593
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:57,697
I want to thank you
for showing me my pain, Curve.

594
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:00,833
You made me what I am.

595
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:09,083
Flores.

596
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:12,245
Flores para los muertos.

597
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:14,255
Flores.

598
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:20,351
Flores.

599
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:23,398
Flores para los muertos.

600
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:25,400
Flores.

601
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,493
Where am I?

602
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:58,197
The tower.

603
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:01,532
Everyone finds
their way here eventually.

604
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:10,706
What happened to you?

605
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,805
Fate happened to her.

606
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:16,909
Sibyl's been cursed
with the gift of prophecy.

607
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,045
Judah Earl.

608
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,180
She sees things
that are fated to happen.

609
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,885
She cut out her eyes
with a carving knife...

610
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,894
because she wanted to make
the visions stop.

611
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:29,692
But that only made the visions
stronger, didn't it, dear?

612
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:32,825
Why did you bring me here?

613
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:34,995
I'm glad you asked that, Sarah.

614
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:39,234
You've got a very important part
to play in this little drama of ours.

615
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:42,038
I intend to capture the crow,

616
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:45,480
and you, my dear,

617
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,874
are the birdseed.

618
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,874
Sarah.

619
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:39,592
First you smiled at no one

620
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:42,136
I found you first

621
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:44,434
They've grown fine
inside of you

622
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:51,569
But it hurts if I even see you
Make you smile

623
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,081
I look over and cry

624
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:58,984
But that's too bad
Get stuck for nothing at all

625
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:01,784
Look at yourself
You ain't no genius

626
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:03,791
You won't to find
You won't find me

627
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:12,325
Go!

628
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:16,462
Go!

629
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:25,539
Look who's come home to roost.

630
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:34,682
Aah!

631
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:39,456
But that's too bad

632
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:41,553
- You'll get what you pay for

633
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:44,224
Look at yourself
You ain't no genius

634
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,427
You want to find
You won't find me

635
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:48,197
I'm coming home when I go

636
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:57,607
Aah

637
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:09,347
Ashe is here.

638
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:16,624
First you fight me

639
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:19,395
I found you first

640
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:22,665
They've grown fine
inside of you

641
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:35,676
- Do you know
what these are called?

642
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:37,844
Misericords.

643
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,115
Wonderful name,
isn't it?

644
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:46,920
In the Dark Ages, these were
used to deliver the death stroke...

645
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:49,088
to the mortally wounded.

646
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:52,258
They were considered
tools of mercy.

647
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:25,458
Easy.

648
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:28,264
Easy.

649
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,850
- Ah!

650
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:12,279
- Oww!

651
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:25,556
- Aah!

652
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:35,162
Ashes, ashes,

653
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:38,798
- Oh!
- We all fall down.

654
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,508
No!

655
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,547
You have taken his power.

656
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,550
He is only a man now.

657
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:05,426
Ah.

658
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:16,201
Hey, Dad!

659
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:32,086
If you give up now,
we won't be together.

660
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:40,119
Danny!

661
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:55,469
Judah!

662
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:05,486
What...
What are you?

663
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:08,421
I'm your shadow, Ashe.

664
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,890
Every angel's got a devil.

665
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:13,689
I've tasted the blood
of the crow and taken your power!

666
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:23,735
The crows. They are the souls
who have come before Ashe.

667
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:27,002
They are crying
for the people they have lost.

668
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:29,805
Now they have come for him.

669
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:34,014
Looks like the dead have
forsaken you, my friend.

670
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:36,175
- Look at you!
- Go to hell!

671
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,116
Already been there!

672
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:40,950
And I must confess,
I liked what I saw!

673
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:52,031
Where's your strength, huh?
Where's your power?

674
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:55,899
You're nothing now, Ashe.

675
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:57,962
Not even a ghost.

676
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:24,491
- You want death?
- Yeah!

677
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:27,194
There he is, people!
Take a good look!

678
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:50,747
Uh! If you whip him,
does he not bleed?

679
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:10,576
- Ashe!

680
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:16,611
Aah!

681
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:30,791
Sarah.

682
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:36,428
Sarah! Sarah!

683
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:38,496
Judah!

684
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:10,603
Aah!

685
01:20:10,672 --> 01:20:12,833
Oh!

686
01:20:24,686 --> 01:20:27,348
You can't stop me
anymore, Ashe.

687
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,185
You haven't got the power.

688
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:34,387
There's nothing
but pain for you now.

689
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:38,497
Pain is my power.

690
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:52,507
Take him!

691
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:58,052
Aah!

692
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:43,095
You can't die.

693
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:54,141
Oh, God.

694
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:01,272
Wait!

695
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:10,316
I wanted to thank you.

696
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:16,948
Where are you going now?

697
01:23:20,695 --> 01:23:22,629
A better place.

698
01:23:55,797 --> 01:24:00,427
I believe there's a place
where the restless souls wander...

699
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:03,266
burdened by the weight
of their own sadness.

700
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:06,933
They wait for a chance
to set the wrong things right.

701
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:10,705
Only then can they be reunited
with the ones they love.

702
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:15,273
Sometimes a crow
shows them the way...

703
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:19,650
because sometimes
love is stronger than death.

704
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:50,078
Rock on, gold dust woman

705
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:52,711
Take your silver spoon

706
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:55,722
Dig your grave

707
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:07,560
One less challenge
Pick your path and I'll pray

708
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:17,769
Wake up in the morning

709
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:22,146
See your sunlight
burning to go down

710
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:35,962
Lousy lovers pick their graves
but they never cry out loud

711
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:40,494
Cry out

712
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:45,361
Well, did she make you cry
Make you break down

713
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,603
Shatter your illusions
of love

714
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:52,271
Is it over now
Do you know how

715
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:55,407
To pick up the pieces
and go home

716
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:58,919
Did she make you cry
Make you break down

717
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,956
Shatter your illusions
of love

718
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:05,720
And did you know by now
Do you know how

719
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:08,887
To pick up the pieces
and go home

720
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:19,602
To go home

721
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:23,235
Home, home, home

722
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:26,576
Oh, shadow of a woman

723
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:35,855
Oh, oh, shadow of a woman

724
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:40,054
Ooo, yeah
shadow of a woman

725
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:47,159
Ooo, ooo
shadow of a woman

726
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:54,273
Ooo, yeah
shadow of a woman

727
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:59,609
Come on, come on
Black widow

728
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:06,118
Ooo, ooo, ooo

729
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:14,325
Whoo, hey, ah

730
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:18,593
Shadow of a woman

731
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:21,032
Black widow

732
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:28,668
Ooo, yeah
shadow of a woman

733
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:33,680
Shadow of a woman
Black widow

734
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:41,412
Ooo, yeah
shadow of a woman

735
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:47,957
Black widow

736
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:21,351
Hey, old man
Got something for you

737
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:27,398
Change your mind
Gonna make you take it

738
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:32,832
Your mistake is
something you own

739
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:38,308
And I'm the one
who's gonna take it

740
01:28:40,682 --> 01:28:43,617
Hey, old man
Got something for you

741
01:28:45,953 --> 01:28:48,888
Hey, old man
Got a real good tip

742
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:54,823
Something's wrong
and you don't own it

743
01:28:57,031 --> 01:29:00,865
When will you learn

744
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:06,132
I'm not your boy

745
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:11,905
You don't look back

746
01:29:13,414 --> 01:29:18,442
Why do I pick up your slack

747
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:32,832
When else you been in my bed

748
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:38,536
Got your picture in my head

749
01:29:40,842 --> 01:29:43,743
God, you are so truly old

750
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:49,012
Thanks a lot
My future is sold

751
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:51,017
No

752
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:00,854
When will you learn

753
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:06,025
I'm not your boy

754
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,560
Hey, old man
Got something for you

755
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:17,674
Hey, old man
Got a real good tip

756
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:20,270
No
