00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:49,791
In the land of Sparta,

2
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:50,991
When babies were born,

3
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:55,501
The elders would inspect them
for defects

4
00:00:56,575 --> 00:00:59,561
Ah! Are you my mama?

5
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:01,866
Because I am ready,
to suck your tits!

6
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:14,836
If any imperfections were found...

7
00:01:14,836 --> 00:01:16,565
The baby was rejected.

8
00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:20,310
And if the baby was Vietnamese,

9
00:01:20,988 --> 00:01:23,870
Branjelina had first dips.

10
00:01:28,092 --> 00:01:28,908
Cute, huh?

11
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:32,518
Behold, Leonidas...

12
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,997
Awoo!

13
00:01:32,237 --> 00:01:33,691
The perfect Spartan.

14
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,284
At an early age,

15
00:01:43,716 --> 00:01:45,358
Leonidas was taught to fight.

16
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:47,385
Come on, you little shit.
Come on!

17
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:50,927
You can't beat me!
You're never gonna be a Spartan. Never!

18
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:52,403
Take this, granny!

19
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:59,673
He was tortured.
Torture showed no pain.

20
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:04,365
Tell me, Mr. Bond.
What is the account number?

21
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:06,627
Who the hell is Mr. Bond?

22
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:08,405
I am Leonidas.

23
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:10,447
You are testing my patience, double o'

24
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:13,597
I am not double ohh...

25
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:19,243
Little Miss Sunshine!

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,286
It's a nice one, huh?

27
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,791
That's Right

28
00:02:31,023 --> 00:02:35,057
Alright there. Mr. Bond,
I would like you to meet Captain Adorable

29
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,950
Good boy! Who's a good boy!

30
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:49,587
Leonidas was sent into the wild...

31
00:02:49,827 --> 00:02:51,988
To learn how to survive.

32
00:02:57,016 --> 00:02:59,465
He prayed to the elements...

33
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:02,050
Endured starvation...

34
00:03:10,577 --> 00:03:14,227
No mayo?
This is bullshit!

35
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:19,451
The beast stalks Leonidas...

36
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,881
Red eyes glowing like
the fires of Hell!

37
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,531
Man, you've got Happy Feet!

38
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:51,064
I am about to shove up my
Happy Foot up your ass, crackum!

39
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:52,720
Nice penguin!

40
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:53,386
Where are you going, pussy?

41
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:58,715
I'm about to make you my
bitch, Leonidas!

42
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:12,765
- The taco barely sitting right here.
- Oh, stop!

43
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:14,386
Caught you with
your mouth open!

44
00:04:27,106 --> 00:04:28,330
You're dead Leonidas.

45
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,255
Say, 'Wazzup!' to Anna Nicole.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,463
Shit, I'm stuck! Oh my God, we've got a
penguin penned down!

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,285
Help! Help!

48
00:04:48,263 --> 00:04:49,417
My ass!

49
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,814
My ass hurts! Uhh!

50
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,304
Why do you want to do
me like that?

51
00:04:51,544 --> 00:04:52,717
Come on, man!

52
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:54,489
I could hook you up!
We could work it out!

53
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,214
I was just joke...

54
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:04,702
And the boy that was
tossed into the wild...

55
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:07,227
...returned a king!

56
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:48,952
Wow!

57
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,987
Boobs!

58
00:05:58,074 --> 00:05:59,803
Sign my rock!

59
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:02,540
And they're real too!

60
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,261
Yes!

61
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:08,260
Marry me?

62
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:18,922
- What's that?
- The combination to my chasity belt

63
00:06:37,682 --> 00:06:39,779
Leonidas was stoked.

64
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:44,360
He wed Margo and she bore him
a fine son.

65
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:48,985
And life in the land of Sparta
was good.

66
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:53,643
Yes! Yes!
Good!

67
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,799
Thanks Dad!

68
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:02,859
Give me your hand.
Remember son!

69
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:06,041
A warrior must learn
to take a hit!

70
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:09,646
Fight with your head,

71
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,904
Think with your heart.

72
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,324
Give him the 'Piledriver', honey.

73
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:16,161
The 'Piledriver'?

74
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:22,589
That's my boy.

75
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:32,772
- My Queen!
- Captain!

76
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:37,528
I can see Leonidas is holding our future
king of Sparta to be a man.

77
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:44,692
I remember when my father
used to beat me.

78
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:47,657
The traditional rites of passage.

79
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,469
No, my father was an alcoholic.

80
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:59,104
Xerxes' messenger awaits,
my King.

81
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:08,953
- Greetings, Leonidas!
- Greetings, messenger!

82
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:13,409
What the hell was that?

83
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:15,627
- What?
- You just kissed me!

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,946
That is how men of Sparta
greet each other.

85
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:19,921
High-fives for the women...

86
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:24,151
...and open-mouth tongue kisses
for the men.

87
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:35,934
- I get it.
- Get what?

88
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:39,394
You have a free society.

89
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:41,594
Yes!

90
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:44,292
- The freest!
- Not that there is anything wrong with that!

91
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:52,818
I take big, black dudes.

92
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:55,022
Yeah!

93
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:57,157
Come messenger, let us walk!

94
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:05,395
The great Xerxes has taken over the
world with his vast Persian army.

95
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:09,889
He has set his sights
with his final conquest.

96
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:11,612
Sparta!

97
00:09:15,497 --> 00:09:17,830
Let us talk by the giant
Pit of Death.

98
00:09:18,388 --> 00:09:20,069
Okay!

99
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,671
Xerxes is a kind God King,

100
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:24,776
and offers these peaceful alternatives
to war!

101
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,597
No blood will be shed

102
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:29,888
As long as you Spartan men
with his spirits

103
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:33,972
You women... become his
sex slaves!

104
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:38,987
And your children... work in sweat
shops, making Nikes.

105
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:43,204
That sounds reasonable.

106
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:46,482
I'm sure you would think so,
Counselman Treathero.

107
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:17,280
Tell Xerxes,

108
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,379
To take his proporsal,

109
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:24,041
and shove it...

110
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:26,685
What the hell?

111
00:10:26,987 --> 00:10:27,947
What? He came onto me!

112
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:30,932
I did not! Dawg,
your wife's a ho!

113
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:36,074
This means war!

114
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:40,033
Hey, hey, it's cool!
It's cool!

115
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:42,557
We've got San Franciso.
And West Hollywood. We don't need Sparta.

116
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:44,586
I'll just tell Xerxes
it's a no-go!

117
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:53,344
Kick his ass in!

118
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:58,220
This is madness!

119
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:00,801
Madness?

120
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:05,179
This... is... Sparta!

121
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:14,671
Why did you do that?
He was backing down!

122
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:21,966
My Lord, he will tell Xerxes
that Sparta is not in war with them...

123
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:24,378
...so whatever you do,
don't kick him into the Pit of Death!

124
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,914
Stop kicking people into the
Pit of Death! Really!

125
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:37,286
I wonder why y'all always
have my back for everything!

126
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:41,221
I am a responsible adult!
Look at me... I'm booby-feeding my baby!

127
00:11:41,913 --> 00:11:46,072
Sometimes I like to give him pridemilk. I call them
milkpoppers. It's just like breastmilk but it's fried

128
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,794
And you just pop it into their mouth!
He loves it, don't you, baby!

129
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:57,273
I am a smart shopper

130
00:11:57,468 --> 00:12:00,349
I got this entire outfit in an alleyway
from a Mexican woman!

131
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:03,533
Bagging, shopping, yeah!

132
00:12:04,178 --> 00:12:05,573
Why do you all think I mess up?

133
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,399
Shit, do I look crazy to you?

134
00:12:18,381 --> 00:12:20,302
Oh damn cuz, there goes my palimony.

135
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:22,900
K-Fed ain't having it, yo!

136
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:49,684
I am not gay!

137
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,269
- Leonidas!
- Bryan Seaquest?

138
00:12:58,002 --> 00:13:01,222
Let's see what the judges
have to say. Randy!

139
00:13:01,342 --> 00:13:03,899
Yo, Leo dawg man, I wasn't really
filling you out on that kick, dawg!

140
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,689
Just alright, dawg!

141
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:18,070
- Paula?
- You move me!

142
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:23,834
Simon?

143
00:13:26,093 --> 00:13:31,886
- I thought that kick was utterly... dreadful!
- Oh, Simon!

144
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:37,126
In fact I have seen better kicks
from a geriatric donkey.

145
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,841
- And I am not talking about you, Paula!
- Oh that's so mean!

146
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:44,465
I'm sorry king but your journey end ..... here

147
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:48,586
Go to (...) yourself

148
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:14,935
Seaquest comes!

149
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:18,635
Excellent work, my king.

150
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:21,354
It's time to consult
the prophets.

151
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:37,034
The ancient prophets were advisors
to the King.

152
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:42,317
Grotesque swines! Their consults
came with a swine.

153
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:50,880
Ohh, Oxytan... Nutrogina...

154
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,721
This has a SPF.
This is all day protection.

155
00:14:54,782 --> 00:14:56,674
Look at this...
Expoliate Hydroxide!

156
00:14:57,785 --> 00:15:01,068
This is good for you man,
rub it all over your disgusting face!

157
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:03,900
What need you, King Leonidas?

158
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:06,115
Ancient prophets...

159
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:08,020
I need your guidance.

160
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:11,428
I am assembling an army of 300 to
go to war with Persia

161
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:14,756
I'm going to take them,
to the rear.

162
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:16,057
Here and here

163
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:20,285
And then I'm gonna reach around...

164
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,792
...and I'm gonna take them up
on the front!

165
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:27,391
What?
Why are you snickering?

166
00:15:27,713 --> 00:15:29,896
Nothing, really!
It's nothing.

167
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:31,951
What's so damn funny?

168
00:15:32,394 --> 00:15:33,752
Look, it's all there for you
to see!

169
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,603
It's a battle formation!

170
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:40,737
Well, it's because it looks backstage
in an Elton John concert.

171
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:44,924
Cut it out! This isn't funny.
This is serious business.

172
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:52,457
No Spartan goes to war without them
consulting... the Oracle

173
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,475
The prophets chose only the most
beautiful of Spartan girls...

174
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,913
...to be their Oracle.

175
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,726
- Ugly Betty?
- She has a great personality.

176
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:30,420
Ooh.

177
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:33,819
I look like Jabba the Hut.
That is hot to me.

178
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,266
Oh!

179
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:01,993
Well, she doesn't... mind it...

180
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:09,361
'Save the cheerleader,
save the world'

181
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:12,097
Actually, I'm not into
Heroes.

182
00:17:12,725 --> 00:17:14,674
- Deuschbag says, 'What?'
- What?

183
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:21,181
- Chestwax says ,'What?'
- What?

184
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:25,729
You are...

185
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:28,430
What, what are you saying to me?
I don't understand!

186
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:31,147
Go to war with Persia
and you will surely die!

187
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:36,354
You're screwed, dude!

188
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:01,491
What?

189
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:06,900
He looks like a 'Ken' doll.

190
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:12,644
It's cold.

191
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,839
Borat?

192
00:18:50,882 --> 00:18:52,393
Why is my prince so restless?

193
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:55,118
I can't sleep.

194
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:59,005
It's this whole battle of the
modernary thing.

195
00:18:59,261 --> 00:19:02,238
Are you still thinking about what
the young Oracle said?

196
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:06,969
There is only one woman who's words
you should listen to.

197
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:10,549
- Oprah?
- Your wife?

198
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:12,409
Right, right!

199
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,286
How will I be tried in the court
of public opinion?

200
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,805
Well, Harry knows at 'Ain't It
Cool News'

201
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,947
says this movie is just a cheap
rip-off of '300'.

202
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,315
Even if the Oracle doesn't support you,

203
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,205
I do... and Sparta does.

204
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,716
This could be our last night together.

205
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:40,992
Do you wanna do it?

206
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,667
Like we never done it before?

207
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:08,047
97... 98...

208
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:12,194
99... 100!

209
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:13,914
Beat my record!

210
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:23,229
- Captain!
- My King!

211
00:20:31,011 --> 00:20:33,712
Have you assembled my army
who are ready to fight for death...

212
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:35,358
...for the freedom of Sparta?

213
00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:36,492
Yes, King!

214
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:44,236
I wanted 300.

215
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,120
This seems like... less.

216
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:50,594
These were the only men
that meant with the specific expectations.

217
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:53,646
Hunky with Deep Mediterranean tens.

218
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:56,242
Hot bods and...

219
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:59,233
- Yes?
- Well, undowed.

220
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,975
We are ready to fight for you,
My King!

221
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:08,034
Never give up, never surrender!
To infinity, and beyond!

222
00:21:11,143 --> 00:21:12,208
He has lot of heart, my king...

223
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,207
...and nice man boobs.

224
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:19,618
Indeed.

225
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:22,232
These men will do.

226
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:26,582
You are a fine captain, Captain.

227
00:21:26,794 --> 00:21:28,531
A better friend...

228
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:31,688
- ...there is none.
-- Thank you!

229
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:46,442
Thank you.

230
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,351
He's got a huge package.

231
00:21:58,352 --> 00:21:59,352
This is rice for morning

232
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:00,953
Mom send it to you, dad

233
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,825
It's good morning

234
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:03,954
Goodbye father

235
00:22:04,726 --> 00:22:05,826
verywell my son

236
00:22:08,957 --> 00:22:10,027
Introductions?

237
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:12,101
Leonidas, this is my son, Soniel.

238
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:13,811
My King.

239
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:15,406
Why is he not fighting?

240
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,207
He is not a warrior.

241
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,176
He's my only son just on
to carry my name.

242
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:24,546
What do you think?

243
00:22:24,486 --> 00:22:26,145
Yummy!

244
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:28,069
Work it, sister.

245
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,956
I think he's Venus.

246
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:40,507
And if you do not like it...
You can kiss my fat ass!

247
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,749
Ooh!

248
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,861
Congratulations, Soniel.

249
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:52,289
You are now on a new way on
becoming Sparta's next new warrior.

250
00:23:03,307 --> 00:23:04,845
Spartan?

251
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,670
My child!

252
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:16,946
I shall never forget you,

253
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,395
You are so small now...

254
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:22,008
...but one day you will grow to be
big and strong...

255
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:23,912
...like your father.

256
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:25,753
That's not your son.

257
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,262
You asshole!

258
00:23:36,102 --> 00:23:37,501
Take care of your mother.

259
00:23:41,138 --> 00:23:42,456
Stay tough, son.

260
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:50,915
Come back with your shield...
or on it.

261
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,745
And if I come back on it...

262
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:54,474
...I want you to move on.

263
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,503
I would never.

264
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:58,753
And if you died,
I'd pay the bill.

265
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:00,738
To be honest...

266
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:04,121
I have always wanted to do
a fat chick.

267
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,834
The men are ready, my King.

268
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:36,336
We'll head set to the Hot Gates

269
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:38,521
Where we'll intercept the Persian army.

270
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:40,596
Where are you going?

271
00:24:40,642 --> 00:24:42,376
The Oracle says if we went to war,
we would be screwed.

272
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,882
The Oracle also said that our
painted-on abs...

273
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:47,058
...look fake.

274
00:24:47,078 --> 00:24:48,116
But I beg to differ.

275
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,204
Give the order, Captain.

276
00:25:00,485 --> 00:25:02,376
Spartans, in formation!

277
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:14,973
Move on!

278
00:25:17,511 --> 00:25:20,777
# Oh no, not I.
I will survive #

279
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:23,955
# Oh, as long as I know how I love #

280
00:25:23,935 --> 00:25:25,664
# I'll know I'll survive #

281
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:27,406
# I've got all my life to live #

282
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:29,383
# I've got all my love to give #

283
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:31,187
# And I will survive. #

284
00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:32,905
# I will survive. #

285
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:34,918
# Hey, hey! #

286
00:25:34,907 --> 00:25:36,828
- Hmm, hmm.
- Whoo!

287
00:25:55,873 --> 00:25:58,609
The fearless Spartans reached
the 'Hot Gates'...

288
00:25:58,705 --> 00:26:01,915
...when danger lurked around
every corner.

289
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:06,649
Halt, skipping!

290
00:26:10,556 --> 00:26:12,067
Exhausted from their journey...

291
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:15,783
The Spartans replenished their
electro-lives.

292
00:26:22,595 --> 00:26:25,451
Gay drink!
Is it in you?

293
00:26:32,182 --> 00:26:33,765
What do you think,
my king?

294
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:36,139
We'll use the narrow
passage by the Hot Gates...

295
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:38,310
...to funnel the Persians in...

296
00:26:38,358 --> 00:26:41,161
...where their vast numbers
won't count for shit!

297
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:44,440
Captain, have the men found
any other trails...

298
00:26:44,363 --> 00:26:46,188
...that the Persians could use to attack us?

299
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:48,369
None, sir!

300
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:50,432
I know such a road, my king.

301
00:26:58,453 --> 00:27:00,298
Back off,
you hideous creature!

302
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,762
There is a secret bow-path,
just below the Hot Gates.

303
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:04,778
If the Persians found it,
they can not find you.

304
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:06,771
Slow your role, Captain.

305
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:10,504
Reveal yourself, creature.

306
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,925
- Paris Hilton?
- Hey, fellas!

307
00:27:16,212 --> 00:27:17,524
What happened to you?

308
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:20,016
Oh, you mean the hump?

309
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:22,429
Yeah, the hump!

310
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,824
It was all that, 'You're going to jail.
Now you can get out of jail'

311
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:28,698
'Now you can go back to jail!'
And on, and on, and on. Uhh!

312
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:33,774
It's just been totally confusing.
Even Tinkerbell's affected by it.

313
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:37,435
She hasn't moved since Saturday. She
still poops which is weird.

314
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:41,510
And me! They have turned me
into this... like...

315
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,608
...totally grotesque monster!
And I don't even know what...

316
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:47,109
Oh!

317
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:56,208
Hello? Oh, hey Nicole!

318
00:27:56,684 --> 00:27:58,535
Nothing, just some guys
with their swords.

319
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,697
No, I'm talking about their actual swords.
Nicole, you're gross.

320
00:28:01,615 --> 00:28:03,392
Now, I'm hungry.
Did you eat?

321
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,708
Oh, you ate an almond?
Oh yea, you're done eating for the day.

322
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:11,708
Bye, sexy ...

323
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:16,546
Look, it's my dream
to be a Spartan.

324
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:25,061
What can you do?

325
00:28:29,045 --> 00:28:30,228
Have you seen my video?

326
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:45,825
That's hot

327
00:28:48,903 --> 00:28:51,022
I am sorry, but we can not use you.

328
00:28:53,046 --> 00:28:55,769
No, it's not fair!

329
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,802
Mom!

330
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:03,803
you'll be sorry for make a terrible tense

331
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:10,443
I am not as stupid
as I look!

332
00:29:14,616 --> 00:29:15,281
Help!

333
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:17,152
Look, Persians!

334
00:29:54,936 --> 00:29:56,158
I am the emmisary...

335
00:29:56,415 --> 00:29:58,457
...to the great God-king, Xerxes...

336
00:29:58,707 --> 00:30:01,068
...come to accept your surrender.

337
00:30:01,423 --> 00:30:03,367
Oh, we're not here to
surrender.

338
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:10,543
Xexes will enjoy making you
his slaves.

339
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:37,999
- Spartans! Let's battle!
- Yeah!

340
00:30:38,823 --> 00:30:40,908
Oh, we're about to
stomp the yard.

341
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:49,595
We are Spartans,
we stomp the yard!

342
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,647
Check out our bods!

343
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,765
Ooh, ooh!

344
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:00,417
Spartans! Yea!

345
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:06,525
Persians!

346
00:31:07,363 --> 00:31:10,302
Let's show them what we National Champs
for 3 years, running.

347
00:31:10,548 --> 00:31:12,469
You dig?!

348
00:31:17,766 --> 00:31:19,583
Oh, come on!

349
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:30,786
Ooh, ahh! Ooh, ahh!
Perrrsians!

350
00:31:42,175 --> 00:31:43,471
# You gotta shake your ass #

351
00:31:43,593 --> 00:31:45,171
Let's go!

352
00:32:21,445 --> 00:32:22,886
Oh, please!

353
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:34,713
Oooh!

354
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:50,874
Don't come up in my kitchen
with that weaker shit!

355
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,839
# You gotta shake your ass #

356
00:34:13,122 --> 00:34:14,975
You got served!

357
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,676
- Are you telling me we lost?
- Dance them to the cliffs!

358
00:34:39,175 --> 00:34:43,871
Come on, man! Can we talk about this? Oh, I just met
these goons right here. I don't even know them!

359
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,978
We may have won the battle.
But they will win the war!

360
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,744
Hah! What?

361
00:35:24,815 --> 00:35:27,654
Budmeister presents...
Real Men of Genius!

362
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:35,437
Today we salute you,
Mr. War-Mongering Latened Homosexuals

363
00:35:38,717 --> 00:35:41,899
Wearing nothing but leather underwear and
a cape you charge your enemy...

364
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:43,776
...like an oil-upped hairless
wonder!

365
00:35:46,388 --> 00:35:49,974
Sure there's danger! Charging rhinos,
stampeding elephants...

366
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:53,896
...and that cute togo wearing guy
named 'Chad'.

367
00:35:54,392 --> 00:35:58,686
You only went out on one date
but you'll remember it forever!

368
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:07,224
Your king's instincts tell you to cut,
slice and chop every man you see...

369
00:36:07,976 --> 00:36:10,520
But enough about your career as
a hair-stylist.

370
00:36:10,527 --> 00:36:12,032
Let's talk war.

371
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,265
So this Bud's for you
King Leonidas!

372
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:20,385
Because when the going gets tough,
the tough go and ticking

373
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:31,652
Queen Margo,
we must speak!

374
00:36:35,283 --> 00:36:35,878
What do you want?

375
00:36:39,368 --> 00:36:40,904
Nice tomatoes!

376
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:44,155
Your husband...
needs you.

377
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:48,990
You must convince the council to send
more troops to support your husband.

378
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:51,266
My husband is dead...

379
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:55,400
...he told me to move on.
Besides, I'm already registered on J-Day

380
00:36:55,454 --> 00:36:58,242
A little to the right...
That's it!

381
00:36:58,608 --> 00:37:01,349
Leonidas fails,
Xerxes will take over...

382
00:37:01,506 --> 00:37:03,779
...and you will be stripped
of your crown.

383
00:37:04,344 --> 00:37:06,313
I won't be Queen?

384
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:07,794
Auw, it's too hard.

385
00:37:08,578 --> 00:37:10,003
We'll lose everything.

386
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:13,204
The palace...

387
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:18,249
- Your Nintendo Wii...
- No, no, no! Oww!

388
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,772
Your 20 inch rims in your Escalade...

389
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,353
...your gardener!

390
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:28,955
Antonio?

391
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:46,396
My husband needs me!

392
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:48,495
I'll do whatever it takes!

393
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:50,472
I'll accept the meeting with
the council.

394
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:52,367
But in order to win their vote,

395
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:55,543
You need to get traitorers
as your supporter.

396
00:37:57,697 --> 00:38:01,236
He holds great influence.
The Council.

397
00:38:14,923 --> 00:38:17,902
King Leonidas,
Xerxes approaches!

398
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:23,531
Xerxes! He seems as much at that
Fat guy from the movie of Borat.

399
00:38:30,411 --> 00:38:34,291
- I am the great God King Xerxes. Oww!
- Ooh!

400
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:40,423
Oww, oww, oww!

401
00:38:41,885 --> 00:38:44,335
- Ohh!
- Ahh!

402
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,370
Damn!

403
00:39:04,334 --> 00:39:07,938
- I'm sorry, Xerxes!
- It's cool! It's cool, cool! I'm fine.

404
00:39:08,104 --> 00:39:09,520
I meant to do that.

405
00:39:10,425 --> 00:39:12,154
Oh, shit!

406
00:39:12,363 --> 00:39:13,893
I tell you, kid...
you got balls!

407
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,883
I come over here with a big army,
and we're gonna sheesh kabab your ass.

408
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:19,118
Before this battle is over,

409
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:22,766
people will know that even
a God-king could fall.

410
00:39:23,275 --> 00:39:25,684
Listen Leo, I came here to talk.

411
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:27,888
Just listen to my deal.

412
00:39:30,391 --> 00:39:31,840
Ladies!

413
00:39:31,856 --> 00:39:34,128
Hi Xerxes!

414
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,920
That's probably for me.

415
00:39:39,315 --> 00:39:42,801
Hello. Really? Okay!

416
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,352
That was the banker. He's offering to buy
back your briefcase...

417
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:51,082
...for a week and
getaway for two...

418
00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:53,358
...in Las Vegas, Nevada...

419
00:39:53,598 --> 00:39:55,173
...in the Palms Hotel and Casino.

420
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,733
I always wanted to go there!

421
00:39:57,541 --> 00:40:00,609
All you have to do...
is bow down to me

422
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:04,444
And surrender Sparta.

423
00:40:05,391 --> 00:40:08,117
Deal... or no deal?

424
00:40:11,694 --> 00:40:14,189
- Take the deal!
- No!

425
00:40:14,384 --> 00:40:16,559
Take the deal, take the deal!

426
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:17,690
What about Sparta?

427
00:40:17,979 --> 00:40:21,147
- Hit the button!
- Yes, take the deal, take the deal!

428
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:24,711
Hit the button!

429
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,493
Hit it.

430
00:40:27,602 --> 00:40:30,116
- No deal!
- Aww, damn!

431
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,563
By the time I'm
finished with you...

432
00:40:33,913 --> 00:40:35,788
...Sparta will be
annihilated.

433
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,036
It will be as though it
never existed.

434
00:40:38,694 --> 00:40:41,328
I will see to it that you're
written out of the history books.

435
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:44,719
Well, that's fine,
my mean Xerxes...

436
00:40:46,223 --> 00:40:48,165
Because I can't read.

437
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:53,449
Xerxes didn't take rejection well.

438
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:56,415
From every corner of his empire,

439
00:40:56,932 --> 00:40:59,379
He sent his most vicious warriors
to fight.

440
00:40:59,985 --> 00:41:04,373
Yo mama so ghetto, when she
brest-feeds cool-oil comes out!

441
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:12,507
Yo mama so stupid she thought...

442
00:41:12,425 --> 00:41:15,510
...2Pac Shakur was a
Jewish Holiday

443
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:25,691
Yo mama so fat, her...

444
00:41:25,905 --> 00:41:28,941
...pant size is umm...
'Bitch-Lose-Some-Weight'!

445
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:34,210
Yo mama so foot, Rosie O'
Donnel wouldn't even date her!

446
00:41:34,831 --> 00:41:36,656
Oh, you did it!
No, you didn't!

447
00:41:38,146 --> 00:41:40,480
Well, yo mama titties
are smaller than yours!

448
00:41:43,926 --> 00:41:45,764
Those tits are my
bitches!

449
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,093
Yo mama so fat...

450
00:41:47,235 --> 00:41:51,286
...so they decided that he doesn't
like big butts. And he ain't lyin'!

451
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:57,217
Aww, oh, my eyes!

452
00:42:00,212 --> 00:42:01,941
How you like that, huh?

453
00:42:04,502 --> 00:42:06,929
Yo mama so fat that when
she farts...

454
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:09,623
...Al Gore accuses her of
global warming, dawg!

455
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:16,290
Yes, well that maybe the case but
yo mama so hairy,

456
00:42:16,562 --> 00:42:18,403
the only language she speaks...

457
00:42:18,673 --> 00:42:21,954
...is wookie! Brrrr!
Brrrr!

458
00:42:36,071 --> 00:42:38,508
Xerxes watched as his warriors
were defeated.

459
00:42:39,747 --> 00:42:42,614
It sent an all human chill-up
to his spine...

460
00:42:43,901 --> 00:42:46,947
...or perhaps that was the Dentyne Ice
with Cool-Made Crystals.

461
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:57,468
Lloyl said you wanted to see me.

462
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,987
That's my urine sample.

463
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:07,041
Leonidas needs more troops.

464
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:10,341
Without reinforcements,
Sparta will fall and...

465
00:43:11,197 --> 00:43:13,118
Blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah...

466
00:43:20,002 --> 00:43:22,658
I'll do anything...
for my husband.

467
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:25,808
Anything?

468
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:33,222
Awesome! I'm so getting laid!

469
00:43:33,624 --> 00:43:35,371
Goodbye, virginity!

470
00:43:35,889 --> 00:43:38,154
I promise you,
you're not going to enjoy this...

471
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:41,217
...but I have V.D

472
00:43:45,896 --> 00:43:48,248
That's okay!
I have crabs.

473
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:21,288
Betray your beloved Spartans.

474
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:27,889
And I'll give you anything you desire!

475
00:44:28,528 --> 00:44:29,564
That's hot!

476
00:44:30,028 --> 00:44:31,325
Bow down to me!

477
00:44:33,736 --> 00:44:35,799
Bend down to the great God King,

478
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:37,328
Xerxes.

479
00:44:37,933 --> 00:44:41,392
- I am a Hilton, I don't bow!
- Ai!

480
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:44,302
- But, I do bend over!
- Ah!

481
00:44:44,428 --> 00:44:46,439
- Good!
- There's a secret go-path between...

482
00:44:47,005 --> 00:44:50,797
...the Hot Gates. You can totally
use it to defeat Leonidas!

483
00:44:54,553 --> 00:44:56,437
And what do you desire?

484
00:44:56,891 --> 00:44:59,115
I want my record esponged.

485
00:44:59,549 --> 00:45:01,721
Oh, and I want that new Chanel purse.

486
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:06,691
Thank you! I want...
throwing up to be fun!

487
00:45:07,034 --> 00:45:08,389
You've got something to say,
say it!

488
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:09,582
I've got things to do!

489
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:12,405
What was it?

490
00:45:12,858 --> 00:45:14,440
Oh God, jeez, yeah!

491
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:16,308
I want to get this hump removed.

492
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:54,323
As long as Xerxes doesn't find the
secret path to the Hot Gates...

493
00:45:55,415 --> 00:45:58,401
...their vast numbers won't
count for shit!

494
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,416
My King!

495
00:46:04,138 --> 00:46:06,392
Catch your breath!
Vanilla blend-in.

496
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:08,931
What is it, boy?

497
00:46:12,955 --> 00:46:15,737
Xerxes has found the secret
go-path between the Hot Gates.

498
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:16,295
Oh, shit!

499
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:17,844
Damn that Paris Hilton.

500
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:19,642
I hate her.

501
00:46:20,562 --> 00:46:23,436
He's deployed a thousand of Persian soldiers.
They can be here any minute!

502
00:46:29,332 --> 00:46:33,275
Idilio...
How bad are your injuries?

503
00:46:33,515 --> 00:46:36,043
Oh, it's...
It's just a scratch, my King.

504
00:46:40,914 --> 00:46:42,111
You've got no eyes.

505
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:44,030
The gods have blessed me
with a spare

506
00:46:44,696 --> 00:46:47,557
No, they haven't.
You just have the two.

507
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:49,798
Jeremy has the spare.

508
00:46:55,382 --> 00:46:56,919
But I can still fight.

509
00:46:58,433 --> 00:47:02,229
Ho, Idilio... Idilio...
Idilio!

510
00:47:02,545 --> 00:47:06,324
- What?
- Idilio, Idillio... Idilio! Walk with me.

511
00:47:08,002 --> 00:47:10,504
No, no, no!

512
00:47:13,037 --> 00:47:15,532
Your fate is the most important!

513
00:47:18,357 --> 00:47:20,746
You must go back to Sparta,

514
00:47:20,666 --> 00:47:22,086
and tell of our tale!

515
00:47:22,754 --> 00:47:23,900
Yes, my King,

516
00:47:25,037 --> 00:47:27,056
Any message for the Queen?

517
00:47:39,307 --> 00:47:41,094
None that need to be said.

518
00:47:42,066 --> 00:47:45,762
Now go Idillio. Tell how 13 Spartans...

519
00:47:45,817 --> 00:47:46,926
Fought for honour...

520
00:47:47,176 --> 00:47:48,466
For glory...

521
00:47:48,669 --> 00:47:52,842
For freedom.
Good luck, Idilio.

522
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,290
Spartans!

523
00:48:19,404 --> 00:48:20,811
This is your final chance.

524
00:48:21,306 --> 00:48:23,891
Bow down to me...
or you will die.

525
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:26,822
I bow for no man!

526
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:34,460
- Take a knee!
- No!

527
00:48:35,906 --> 00:48:37,165
- Curtsy!
- Enough!

528
00:48:40,371 --> 00:48:43,653
- Well, your sandle is untied.
- Oh, thanks very much!

529
00:48:44,348 --> 00:48:46,943
- You see, was that that difficult?
- Wait, no!

530
00:48:46,912 --> 00:48:49,522
- Atatatata! No, no!
- No, I wasn't bowing! I wasn't bowing!

531
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,773
- I was just doing my shoe!
- No, no!

532
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,562
You acknowledge me as your God-king.
High-five!

533
00:48:58,238 --> 00:48:59,439
What?

534
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:03,170
What, what, what the hell is so funny?

535
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:04,820
- You!
- Me?

536
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,717
You greet like women.

537
00:49:07,057 --> 00:49:10,064
You idiots are wearing banana panties
and you're laughing at me?

538
00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:12,851
Now you're pissing me off!
I'm getting everybody!

539
00:49:13,977 --> 00:49:15,138
Hello, where you at?

540
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,446
I know where I'm at.

541
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:18,205
Bring in my vast army.

542
00:49:18,952 --> 00:49:20,131
You, 13 butts...

543
00:49:20,344 --> 00:49:22,528
...are no match for my massive
Persian army.

544
00:49:22,768 --> 00:49:24,122
They number in their millions!

545
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,997
That's just a blue screen!

546
00:49:31,943 --> 00:49:34,275
Stupid! It's a visual effect!

547
00:49:34,573 --> 00:49:36,316
It's going to be digitally
inserted later.

548
00:49:36,423 --> 00:49:39,162
And the army is quite impressive
as you can imagine.

549
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:48,343
Gentlemen, I present,
Queen Margo.

550
00:50:14,441 --> 00:50:15,458
Shake it, baby!

551
00:50:21,973 --> 00:50:23,986
Okay boys,
Make it rain!

552
00:50:42,961 --> 00:50:43,498
Good counsilmen...

553
00:50:44,115 --> 00:50:45,910
I implore you.

554
00:50:46,858 --> 00:50:50,331
Your king... my dear husband,
needs your help.

555
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:54,721
Sparta will fall if you don't agree
to send the rest of the army.

556
00:51:07,596 --> 00:51:10,702
Gentlemen, our only hope for survival
is to surrender to Xerxes

557
00:51:11,076 --> 00:51:12,600
and beg for his forgiveness.

558
00:51:13,032 --> 00:51:14,828
Do not be swayed by the words
of this...

559
00:51:15,584 --> 00:51:16,867
...woman slut!

560
00:51:21,009 --> 00:51:24,843
- Oh, no you didn't!
- Yes, yes I did!

561
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:32,725
Queen Margo unleashed a
venomous rage.

562
00:51:35,611 --> 00:51:38,199
Much like Tobey Maguire
in Spider-Man 3.

563
00:51:48,843 --> 00:51:50,151
I'm evil!

564
00:51:55,271 --> 00:51:57,193
Made of sand. Oh!

565
00:52:05,966 --> 00:52:06,927
Oh, no!

566
00:52:21,963 --> 00:52:23,643
Cute!

567
00:52:24,848 --> 00:52:25,952
Gross!

568
00:52:35,908 --> 00:52:38,008
What?

569
00:52:38,921 --> 00:52:42,427
Oh, oh, God, oh!

570
00:52:45,982 --> 00:52:48,270
How you like me now,
Sandman?

571
00:52:47,766 --> 00:52:49,687
Oh, no!

572
00:52:51,279 --> 00:52:53,618
That dusting bitch, no!

573
00:52:58,861 --> 00:53:00,782
Aaaah!

574
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:19,383
Chickel my nipples with a feather,
Xerxes is in Traitor's Top 5.

575
00:53:21,461 --> 00:53:23,657
Treathero was a traitor?

576
00:53:24,718 --> 00:53:25,774
Duh!

577
00:53:26,247 --> 00:53:27,947
All in favor of sending
more troops...

578
00:53:29,176 --> 00:53:32,350
- Say, 'I'
- I, I, I, I!

579
00:53:56,621 --> 00:53:58,648
Spartans!
Huh!

580
00:54:01,117 --> 00:54:02,237
We have you surrounded,

581
00:54:02,556 --> 00:54:04,089
Lay down your weapons!

582
00:54:04,754 --> 00:54:07,775
- Come and get them!
- For-mation!

583
00:54:14,444 --> 00:54:18,235
- Umm...
- The Spartan always protects another man's rear!

584
00:54:23,528 --> 00:54:24,786
Adjust your sword, boy!

585
00:54:25,423 --> 00:54:26,965
It's sticking into my back.

586
00:54:29,264 --> 00:54:30,843
No, I'm not wearing my sword.

587
00:54:33,564 --> 00:54:34,719
Carry on, then.

588
00:54:35,241 --> 00:54:36,293
My son?

589
00:54:37,973 --> 00:54:40,950
Today, you are truly a Spartan.

590
00:54:41,301 --> 00:54:42,179
Thank you father.

591
00:54:44,359 --> 00:54:45,635
Attack!

592
00:54:48,555 --> 00:54:49,996
Steady, Spartans.

593
00:55:00,443 --> 00:55:02,308
Remember this day, boys...

594
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:05,570
...for today is the day
you die!

595
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,214
What?

596
00:55:09,316 --> 00:55:12,238
I, I mean they will die.
Today is the day that they die.

597
00:55:12,235 --> 00:55:13,675
That was what I meant to say.

598
00:55:16,576 --> 00:55:17,729
Go on!

599
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:33,453
Oh, what a bunch of dumb-shits.

600
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:37,337
God, that was smart!

601
00:55:37,362 --> 00:55:40,531
I'm gonna go Hercules up
your ass!

602
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:06,965
Ghost Rider!

603
00:57:10,398 --> 00:57:12,299
You go to hell.

604
00:57:14,275 --> 00:57:16,724
Die!

605
00:57:22,954 --> 00:57:25,547
Stop the war!
Stop the war!

606
00:57:38,485 --> 00:57:40,406
Ohh!

607
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:54,681
- No!
- Yo, Sonio?

608
00:57:56,103 --> 00:57:58,946
- I'll knock your blocko!
- Oh, shit!

609
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,464
Sonio!

610
00:58:15,138 --> 00:58:17,358
You'll pay for this, Balboa.

611
00:58:17,486 --> 00:58:18,545
Go for it!

612
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,426
Adult diapers?

613
00:58:52,992 --> 00:58:56,329
Botox over-dose.

614
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:06,240
Yes!

615
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,755
Yea! Ha-ha!

616
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:10,920
Yaa!

617
00:59:17,189 --> 00:59:18,341
Yes!

618
00:59:22,882 --> 00:59:24,727
Xerxes!

619
00:59:35,067 --> 00:59:37,877
It's a beautiful day.

620
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,726
It's actually not that
attractive.

621
01:00:13,135 --> 01:00:14,911
# Come on, Barbie.
Let's go Barbie! #

622
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,356
Ooh!

623
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:43,427
Shit!

624
01:00:50,907 --> 01:00:53,323
It's enough of this victoreous
video game violence!

625
01:01:21,734 --> 01:01:24,795
Ah, a Transformer cube.

626
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:36,057
Okay baby,
Let's transform!

627
01:02:08,973 --> 01:02:15,309
I am Xerxestron, equipped with
the Trans-alien technology!

628
01:02:19,259 --> 01:02:21,305
Leave Buddy alone!

629
01:02:21,911 --> 01:02:24,900
- He is a God-king ...
- Please!

630
01:02:32,652 --> 01:02:34,573
Leave him alone!

631
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,261
Leonidas was true to
his word...

632
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:51,413
A God-king did fall!

633
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,624
But unfortunately,
right on them!

634
01:03:14,394 --> 01:03:16,074
I just...

635
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:19,765
Ohh!

636
01:03:21,754 --> 01:03:23,098
Ooh!

637
01:03:23,983 --> 01:03:26,320
- Queen Margo?
- Yeah!

638
01:03:49,372 --> 01:03:51,301
Leonidas and the Spartans,

639
01:03:51,614 --> 01:03:52,996
died for honour.

640
01:03:53,935 --> 01:03:55,388
For glory.

641
01:03:56,827 --> 01:03:58,014
They died.

642
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,778
A beautiful death.

643
01:04:04,564 --> 01:04:08,542
Today, we stand against 30 thousand Persians.

644
01:04:11,346 --> 01:04:14,632
But we now have, a
hundred thousand soldiers!

645
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:16,902
Awoo! Awoo! Awoo!

646
01:04:17,848 --> 01:04:18,866
To victory!

647
01:04:28,389 --> 01:04:30,991
Ah!
Follow me boys!

648
01:04:34,515 --> 01:04:38,830
Idillio blindly led the Spartans away
from the Persians...

649
01:04:39,686 --> 01:04:42,060
...to Mallibu...

650
01:04:42,673 --> 01:04:46,783
...just as Lindsay Lowhand
was leaving rehab... again!

651
01:05:00,086 --> 01:05:01,942
# At first, I was
afraid #

652
01:05:02,053 --> 01:05:03,504
# I was petrified #

653
01:05:04,016 --> 01:05:07,112
# Kept thinking that I could never live
without you by my side #

654
01:05:07,697 --> 01:05:11,338
# But then I spend so many nights,
thinking how you did me wrong #

655
01:05:11,548 --> 01:05:13,191
# And I grew strong #

656
01:05:13,172 --> 01:05:14,930
# And I learned how to get along #

657
01:05:15,367 --> 01:05:16,813
# And so you're back #

658
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,379
# From outer-space #

659
01:05:19,046 --> 01:05:22,831
# I just want them to find you here
with that sad look upon your face #

660
01:05:23,014 --> 01:05:27,076
# I should have just change my stupid lock,
I should have made you leave your key #

661
01:05:27,055 --> 01:05:30,908
# If I didn't know for just one second,
you would be back to bother me #

662
01:05:31,046 --> 01:05:38,654
# Go on now, go! Walk out of the door!
Just turn around now! Coz you're not welcome anymore! #

663
01:05:39,147 --> 01:05:46,874
# Weren't you the one who traggered hurtly by?
Do you think I'd grumble? Do you think I'd lay down and die? #

664
01:05:46,814 --> 01:05:50,248
# Oh no, not I.
I will survive! #

665
01:05:50,704 --> 01:05:54,717
# Oh, as long as I know how to love,
I'll know I'll stay alive! #

666
01:05:55,139 --> 01:06:02,283
# I've got all my life to live! I've got all my love to give!
And I'll survive. I'll survive. #

667
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,384
Wassup, dawg?
# Took out all the strength I had #

668
01:06:20,623 --> 01:06:22,519
# And let the ball apart, dawg? #

669
01:06:22,389 --> 01:06:26,174
# Tellin' how you remember the pieces
of my broken heart #

670
01:06:26,197 --> 01:06:30,242
# And I spent oh, so many nights just feeling
sorry for myself #

671
01:06:30,683 --> 01:06:34,615
- # And I used to cry. #
- # But now I hold my hand up high! #

672
01:06:34,426 --> 01:06:37,837
# And you see me.
Somebody nude. #

673
01:06:38,243 --> 01:06:41,795
# I'm not that change-up little person
stealing love with you #

674
01:06:42,722 --> 01:06:44,409
It's Britney, bitch!

675
01:06:47,881 --> 01:06:51,992
# Oh you fell like dropping in and just
expecting me to be free #

676
01:06:51,676 --> 01:06:55,528
# Now I'm savin' all my lovin'
for someone who's lovin' me #

677
01:06:56,714 --> 01:06:59,893
Ooh, come on!
Ahh, hah, hah!

678
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:03,503
Britney's in the house. Where
my babies at? Ahh, like this.

679
01:07:03,685 --> 01:07:07,107
# Oh I won't. Walk out the door. #

680
01:07:07,425 --> 01:07:11,581
# Just turn around now.
Cause you're not welcome anymore! #

681
01:07:12,249 --> 01:07:16,795
# Weren't you the one who tried to wave me
goodbye. Do you think I'd grumble? #

682
01:07:17,134 --> 01:07:22,335
# Do you think I would lay down and die?
Oh no, not I! I will survive! #

683
01:07:23,348 --> 01:07:27,423
# Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive #

684
01:07:27,451 --> 01:07:32,401
# I've got all my life to live.
I've got all my love to give. And I'll survive! #

685
01:07:33,552 --> 01:07:36,974
# And I'll survive. Hey-hey! #
