1
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,759
Toro! Toro! Toro!

2
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,181
Toro! Toro! Toro!

3
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,366
- Whose idea was this, anyway?
- They're gaining on us.

4
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,160
Andale! Andale!

5
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,169
Yeah!
Yeah!

6
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,343
Whoa!

7
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,393
He's after me!

8
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,108
Phil!

9
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:52,320
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

10
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,707
Jesus!

11
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:17,219
Ed!

12
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:18,888
Go, Mitch!

13
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:29,064
Stay, bull. Stay, bull.
Stay, bull!

14
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:33,736
Stop following me!

15
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,868
Please!

16
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:26,365
Does he know what he's
doing? Has he any idea

17
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:28,367
what he's doing? Because
I can't talk to him.

18
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:29,368
Ow.

19
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,912
Relax.
He's doing a beautiful job.

20
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:34,790
Sir. El doctor.
Hello!

21
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:39,670
Don't sew up anything that's
supposed to remain open, OK?

22
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:40,921
Si.

23
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:46,243
What, are you taking pictures, Phil?

24
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:49,596
Are you kiddin'? This is
a Kodak moment. Now, smile.

25
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:52,433
Oh, good.
Blind him with the flash.

26
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:56,061
Phil, let the man keep
what's left of his dignity, please.

27
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:59,523
- "Dignity." This is all your fault, Ed.
- My fault?

28
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:03,527
- You're a macho lunatic. Phil and
I are sheep. - We're not sheep.

29
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:07,239
- We do every stupid thing he asks!
- I didn't make you run.

30
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:12,035
No, it was a 2,000lb rampaging animal
spraying bull snot all over Spain.

31
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:15,038
That's what made me run.
You made me stand in front of it.

32
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,249
Come on, guys.
Group shot.

33
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,544
I got a big "I told you so"
coming from Barbara.

34
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:22,629
Maybe she won't notice.

35
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:31,430
- Honey, want a pillow? It's a long flight.
- No, thanks.

36
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,226
Come on, it's not that bad.
I look like your mother.

37
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:40,564
Here comes Mr Bull.

38
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:43,859
Kim, baby, do you want
the aisle or the window seat?

39
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,820
- Whatever you want makes me happy.
- I don't care.

40
00:06:46,862 --> 00:06:49,781
Good, then take the window.
I wanna talk to Mitch.

41
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,284
- Be right back.
- Miss me.

42
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:54,744
Admit it, pal.
You had fun.

43
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:59,082
No. Scuba diving is fun.
I mean that's normal. People do that.

44
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:03,211
Baseball fantasy camp, until Phil
threw up on Willie Mays, was fabulous.

45
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:07,090
- I was nervous. He was my idol.
- I'll never forget Willie's face.

46
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:09,592
"Say, hey. That's lunch on me."

47
00:07:10,635 --> 00:07:13,221
- Phil. I'm standing.
- Yes, dear.

48
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,434
Can't wait to get out of this country.

49
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:22,981
Maybe it's just me, but I think our little
adventures lately are becoming... stupid.

50
00:07:23,773 --> 00:07:25,859
What did you call them?

51
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:28,695
- "Desperate attempt to cling
to your youth." - Yeah, that.

52
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:31,531
- That's bullshit.
- Bullshit? Ed, have you noticed...

53
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:34,325
...the older you get,
the younger your girlfriends get?

54
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,661
Soon, you'll be dating sperm.

55
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:40,289
- I'm back.
- OK. I have just one more thing to say.

56
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:44,085
- Target parachute jumping.
- Ed!

57
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,797
Now, it's a smaller parachute,
but you're travelling twice as fast.

58
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,426
Great! When they find your body,
they can bury it in a sucrets box.

59
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:54,303
- Phil said he'd go.
- Phil wants to die.

60
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:57,306
If you were married to that,
you'd wanna die too.

61
00:07:57,348 --> 00:08:00,351
He's pretending to be asleep
so he doesn't have to talk to her.

62
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:02,854
It's a couple of little jumps from a plane.

63
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:07,233
And then what? We go on safari, only
the animals have guns and they hunt us?

64
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:10,444
- Forget about it.
- It's never enough for you, Ed.

65
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:13,531
- I'm reading.
- When's it ever gonna be enough?

66
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:30,965
Hi, Mom.

67
00:08:31,757 --> 00:08:33,926
It's september 8th, 1952.

68
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:40,266
We're driving back from
your Aunt Marsha. My water breaks.

69
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:43,769
Your father jumps the divider
of the sawmill River parkway...

70
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:46,647
...and races me to Doctors' Hospital and...

71
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:51,443
...at 5.16, out you came.

72
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:54,154
Ohh...

73
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,407
Happy birthday, darling.

74
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:02,079
- Here's your father.
- Hello, boy. Happy birthday.

75
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:05,791
- Hi, Dad, how are you?
- I'm losing feeling in my left leg.

76
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,836
- Here's your mother.
- Don't worry. He's fine.

77
00:09:08,877 --> 00:09:11,797
So, what are you gonna
do now, birthday boy?

78
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:15,801
I thought I'd lie here another three
and a half hours, and then go to work.

79
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:18,804
- Is Barbara with you?
- No, she's working the streets.

80
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:22,307
She has her breakfast with her pimp.
She'll be in around 7.30.

81
00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:24,810
- Hi, Mom.
- Give my boy a kiss.

82
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:30,565
I can't believe my baby's 39 years old.

83
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,821
Bye, Mom.

84
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:39,825
Oh, bye.
Angel, birthday boy.

85
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:44,704
Happy birthday.

86
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:57,968
Well, at least she said my age in years.

87
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:00,929
Usually she uses months,
like I'm still an infant.

88
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:03,848
"How's Mitch?"
"Oh, good. He's 468 months today."

89
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:06,267
Wow.

90
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:10,271
I look a year older.
Do I look a year older to you?

91
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,566
Honey, at 5.15,
everybody looks a year older.

92
00:10:15,276 --> 00:10:17,695
- Do you know what I found yesterday?
- Hm?

93
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:19,697
- Hair in my ear.
- Mitch.

94
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:23,701
I'm losing hair where I want hair,
and getting one where it shouldn't be hair.

95
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:27,455
I found four big fat ones on my back.
I'm starting to look like the fly.

96
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:30,542
That's it. I'm cancelling
your birthday party.

97
00:10:31,793 --> 00:10:34,629
- Why?
- Cos your birthdays depress you.

98
00:10:34,712 --> 00:10:36,673
- No, they don't.
- Oh, Mitch.

99
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:39,676
On your 30th birthday,
you said you couldn't see.

100
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:43,137
On your 34th birthday,
you forgot my name for an hour.

101
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:46,391
Last year, when I asked you
what you wanted...

102
00:10:46,432 --> 00:10:48,434
...you said a CAT scan.

103
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:52,397
- I had a headache.
- This year, let's just let it pass.

104
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:55,566
- I wanna see my friends.
- All right.

105
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:59,612
But I don't want people coming over here
thinking they're in a Bergman film.

106
00:10:59,654 --> 00:11:02,240
"You've met my husband, Mr Death?"

107
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:05,284
- I'll be good.
- Yeah?

108
00:11:05,326 --> 00:11:08,496
Cos I don't need you
any worse than you've been.

109
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:13,167
- Wait a second. What does that mean?
- Nothing.

110
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:15,127
"Nothing."

111
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:16,879
Great.

112
00:12:13,435 --> 00:12:15,104
Got a minute?

113
00:12:17,397 --> 00:12:20,400
Hi. Only if a few minutes.
I have career day at Danny's school.

114
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:22,819
Yeah, it'll just take a second.

115
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:27,491
What is it?

116
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:28,992
* Pizza Guy, Pizza Guy

117
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:30,702
* Come on down to Pizza Guy

118
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:32,329
* Be a happy, happy fella

119
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:34,289
* Have some sauce and mozzarella

120
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:36,208
* At Pizza Guy

121
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:38,126
- So?
- So.

122
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:41,546
So, it's stupid.
It's annoying.

123
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:46,218
- It makes people change the station.
- I didn't write it.

124
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:50,555
You bought it. You put it on the air
three times a night in a prime time.

125
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:52,849
People are having accidents.

126
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:03,777
You used to go out and get advertising.

127
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:06,196
You hustled.
You were creative.

128
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,531
Something bad came in, you fixed it.

129
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:10,742
You rewrote it.
You worked with it.

130
00:13:10,784 --> 00:13:14,537
My God, we used to make fun of guys
who bought crap like this.

131
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:18,333
What's going on with you?

132
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:23,338
Did you ever reach a point
in your life where you think...

133
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,383
..."This is the best I'm ever gonna
look, the best I'm ever gonna feel...

134
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:30,887
...the best I'm ever gonna do,
and it ain't that great"?

135
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:34,307
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

136
00:13:37,435 --> 00:13:39,812
Look, I'm the station manager.

137
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:44,734
I'm responsible... for the quality
of work here at the station...

138
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:49,072
...so, until further notice, I shall
personally approve all the new spots.

139
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:52,659
What? I can't make a deal
without checking with you first?

140
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,119
Just till you get back on track.

141
00:13:57,914 --> 00:14:00,458
So we're doing this job
on 60th and 3rd...

142
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,960
...big friggin' ballbreaker
of a job, right?

143
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:06,130
We got the area roped off so
that some schmuck don't walk in...

144
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:09,091
...and take a wreckin' ball
between the eyes.

145
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:13,846
All of a sudden, this woman, with the big,
dark glasses, the Bloomingdale's bags...

146
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:16,849
...she starts walkin' through the ropes.

147
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:20,853
I yelled down at her "Hey, you
can't go there, you stupid bitch!"

148
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:24,690
Suddenly, this big steam fitting bursts...

149
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:29,362
...and this enormous goddamn crane
crashes right down on her legs...

150
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:33,074
...and she's screaming "My legs! My legs!"

151
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,411
And I say "No shit, your legs. You got
a 2,000lb goddamn crane on 'em."

152
00:14:39,663 --> 00:14:43,793
Now, do you know how, in an emergency,
you can get superhuman strength?

153
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:48,130
I reach down and I lift this crane...

154
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,383
...and Ernesto's able
to slide her out from under...

155
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:53,969
...and the doctors were
able to save her legs!

156
00:14:54,011 --> 00:14:57,932
So the moral is... don't walk
where you're not supposed to walk...

157
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:02,561
...because there may not be somebody
with superhuman strength to save you.

158
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:08,108
And don't do drugs.
That's it.

159
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:17,701
Thank you, Mr Morelli.
That was... very descriptive.

160
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,124
Daniel, would you introduce your father,
please, and tell us what he does?

161
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:31,298
My Dad's named Mitch and he's...

162
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,551
...he's a submarine commander.

163
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:36,094
Danny.

164
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,057
He works for WBLM radio.

165
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,364
Well, like Danny said,
I work for WBLM radio.

166
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:01,203
- Are you a disc jockey?
- No, I'm not a disc jockey.

167
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:05,916
You know the commercials
that are on the radio?

168
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:08,460
Do you make all those commercials?

169
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,212
No. Other people
make the commercials.

170
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:15,717
I sell them time on our station
for the commercials to be on.

171
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,679
So you decide which
commercials to use and when.

172
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:24,142
That's right. Well, no, it's
not right. It used to be right.

173
00:16:24,893 --> 00:16:29,397
Seems now that I have to check with the
station manager if I wanna wipe my nose.

174
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:35,403
The minute he took away
my authority, I shoulda quit.

175
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,455
Mr Robbins?

176
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,041
What?

177
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:53,588
Value this time in your life, kids.

178
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:57,091
This is the time in your life
when you still have your choices.

179
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,010
It goes by so fast.

180
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:02,597
When you're a teenager, you think
you can do anything, and you do.

181
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:06,893
Your 20s are a blur. 30s, you raise
your family, you make a little money...

182
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:11,105
...and you think to yourself
"What happened to my 20s?"

183
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:15,651
40s, you grow a little pot belly, you grow
another chin. The music gets too loud.

184
00:17:16,777 --> 00:17:20,156
An old girlfriend from high school
becomes a grandmother.

185
00:17:20,198 --> 00:17:24,744
50s, you have a minor surgery. You'll
call it a "procedure", but it's a surgery.

186
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:28,873
60s, you'll have a major surgery.
The music is still loud...

187
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,875
...but you can't hear it anyway.

188
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,045
70s, you and the wife
retire to Fort Lauderdale.

189
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:37,882
You eat dinner at two in the afternoon...

190
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,885
...lunch around ten,
breakfast the night before.

191
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:44,889
You spend most of your time in malls
looking for the ultimate soft yoghurt...

192
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,100
...and muttering
"How come the kids don't call?"

193
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,646
The 80s, you'll have a major stroke. You
end up babbling to a Jamaican nurse...

194
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:56,192
...that your wife can't stand
but who you call "Momma".

195
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:57,902
Any questions?

196
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:03,490
Danny was embarrassed
to tell the class what my job is.

197
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:08,078
They're nine! They get excited about the
guy who gives them change at the arcade.

198
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:13,542
You just happen to have one
of those jobs that's difficult to...

199
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,546
Believe that a grown man
does without losing his mind.

200
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:22,342
Well, what is my job?
I sell advertising time on the radio.

201
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:24,678
Basically, I sell air.

202
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,825
At least my father was
an upholsterer. He made a

203
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:29,016
sofa, coach you can sit
on it. Something tangible.

204
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:33,353
What can I point to?
Where's my work? It's air. I sell air.

205
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:36,523
So what are you saying?
You wanna quit?

206
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:39,526
How can I quit?
I'm trapped.

207
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:43,405
- You're trapped?
- Yeah. You want to send Holly...

208
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:46,533
...to a performing arts school.
- She's got talent.

209
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:49,536
Talent? She was in one play,
and she fell off the stage.

210
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:53,081
That's not talent, that's gravity.
And that school costs money.

211
00:18:53,123 --> 00:18:55,208
- Bye.
- Bye.

212
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,128
- Where are you going?
- I'm sleeping at Gwen's.

213
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,630
Again?
Are you paying rent there?

214
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:04,217
- Dad.
- We're having a birthday party.

215
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:08,138
- I don't wanna hang out with your friends.
- I told her it'd be all right.

216
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,724
We'll have a family party tomorrow.

217
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:17,814
- Bye, Dad. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

218
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:25,864
Let me show you
how I pop my shoulder.

219
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:30,577
Danny. Dan.
Come on.

220
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:32,620
He's in the gifted programme at school.

221
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:34,622
Come on, go to sleep.

222
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:39,419
Kim, you poor thing. What has married
life done to you? You look like hell!

223
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:43,131
Six months. Admit it. You didn't
think Ed would ever get married.

224
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:45,091
He met the right woman.

225
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:49,596
- How often are you meeting that woman?
- You're lucky it's your birthday, pal.

226
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:52,765
Excuse me, I see one
of the guests is stealing.

227
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:57,812
Your husband is so cute.
You must laugh all day.

228
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:00,606
Yeah.
My sides hurt.

229
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:04,068
We saw a picture of you
in a newspaper in your underwear.

230
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,072
Oh, that was an advertisement.
I sometimes model ladies' underwear.

231
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:10,491
- You looked great.
- Mom...

232
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:14,245
...you said "Let's see how
she looks after having two kids."

233
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,125
Daniel, time to go to bed.

234
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,627
We'll wake you for your wedding.

235
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,048
Phil. Psst.
Hello.

236
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,970
You're pretending
to sleep at my birthday party.

237
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:32,847
Is she around?

238
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,892
She's in the kitchen.

239
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:41,188
This is quite a life you've
carved out for yourself, Phil.

240
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,399
Phil! Phil!
We're leaving.

241
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,571
We haven't had cake.
He hasn't even opened his presents yet.

242
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:52,825
Phil, you have to open the store
at 4.30. Daddy's counting on you.

243
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:55,244
15 more minutes?

244
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,208
Starting now.

245
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:10,926
4.30 in the morning?

246
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,513
You manage a supermarket,
that's when the food arrives.

247
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:16,598
Don't you have an assistant
or a kid or somethin'?

248
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,143
Arlene's father likes me to do it.

249
00:21:20,102 --> 00:21:23,105
"No free rides, Philly boy.
No free rides."

250
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:26,608
I'm tellin' you, they got me by the balls.

251
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,153
She's got one, he's got the other.

252
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:33,615
Do you ever think about quitting?

253
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:35,492
Yeah, sure.
Right.

254
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:39,746
That's just what I wanna do.
Start over, with two kids to take care of.

255
00:21:40,622 --> 00:21:43,417
No. At this age,
where you are, you are.

256
00:21:45,794 --> 00:21:49,214
- Hey, look who's awake.
- Look, I have got 14 minutes...

257
00:21:49,256 --> 00:21:51,717
...so can we give him the present?
- Yeah.

258
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:53,593
What'd you get me?

259
00:21:54,136 --> 00:21:59,266
Two weeks. The three of us.
New Mexico. Driving cattle.

260
00:21:59,641 --> 00:22:02,602
- What? Like in a truck?
- No, no! Cowboys.

261
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:07,065
- It's a real old-fashioned cattle drive.
- We drive the herd to Colorado.

262
00:22:07,816 --> 00:22:11,444
- You can do this?
- We ride, we sleep out under the stars.

263
00:22:11,987 --> 00:22:15,198
- Show him the brochure.
- It's fantastic, Mitch.

264
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:18,869
It's the newest thing.
People do this!

265
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,745
Wow.
Look at this.

266
00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:23,498
- Real horses!
- Does look good.

267
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,002
"Good"? It's great. Cowboys -
it's what you always wanted to be.

268
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:30,297
- Remember Mitchy the Kid?
- Right! Mitchy the Kid!

269
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:35,385
And it's right when your vacation
comes. We've been planning it for weeks.

270
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:37,679
I can't do it.

271
00:22:39,764 --> 00:22:42,892
- Why? - We're going Florida
to visit Barbara's parents.

272
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:47,897
- What, are you sick?
- No, it's planned already. I promised.

273
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:52,527
I worked every weekend for a year
to get this. What's with you these days?

274
00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:55,113
Nothing.
You know, nothing.

275
00:22:55,864 --> 00:22:59,075
It's just, I...
I don't wanna disappoint Barbara.

276
00:23:00,952 --> 00:23:04,789
Who is that? I know nine people
and they're all here. Excuse me.

277
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:11,713
- Hi.
- Um, is Mr Phil Berquist here?

278
00:23:12,505 --> 00:23:15,174
Can I get you something to...

279
00:23:15,216 --> 00:23:18,261
Your housekeeper told me
where you were. I'm in trouble.

280
00:23:18,302 --> 00:23:21,264
What are you doing here?
Who's on register nine?

281
00:23:21,305 --> 00:23:22,723
- I don't know what to do.
- Rumaki?

282
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:26,144
- This isn't the time to talk about this.
- I'm late.

283
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:28,646
- What?
- I missed my period.

284
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:31,440
- What?
- I was at work and on my break...

285
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:34,652
...and I took a home
pregnancy test from aisle 11.

286
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:37,822
- The ones on special?
- Yes! And it came out blue.

287
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:41,367
Why is she telling you this... Phil?

288
00:23:43,327 --> 00:23:45,496
Because I'm... I'm her boss...

289
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:47,623
...and we have a health plan.

290
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:52,086
Son of a bitch! You screwed
this little girl in my father's store?

291
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:54,672
- No, no, no!
- It was in his car!

292
00:23:55,423 --> 00:23:56,674
Oh, Jesus!

293
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:59,260
And I'm not a little girl.
I'm 20.

294
00:23:59,552 --> 00:24:02,346
Get out of this house, you little whore.

295
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:06,100
Hey! I will not permit you
to talk to her that way.

296
00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:11,897
Fine.

297
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:16,735
- I'll tell my father what you did.
- No! Do not call Mr Levine.

298
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:20,656
- Hey! Put down that phone. Put it down.
- No! No!

299
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:24,159
- That's my phone!
- You're crazy!

300
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:27,579
Not having sex for 12 years
will do that to a person!

301
00:24:27,663 --> 00:24:31,375
Come on, just stop it.
Come on, not in front of your friends.

302
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,710
I'm not afraid of you!

303
00:24:35,295 --> 00:24:39,174
- I'll call from the bedroom! - The
bedroom? How would you know where that is?

304
00:24:40,008 --> 00:24:42,553
- I'm calling!
- Go ahead. I'm sure he's home.

305
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:45,556
It's his night to meet with
the other escaped Nazis.

306
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:48,058
- I hate you!
- I hate you more.

307
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:51,603
If hate were people, I'd be China.

308
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:01,655
Let's bring out the cake.

309
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,704
Good party.

310
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:13,333
Mitch.

311
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:17,963
Is that what you've been trying
to tell me? That you feel like Phil?

312
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:22,551
- Like Phil?
- Am I gonna be sittin' here some night...

313
00:25:22,592 --> 00:25:25,595
...and some checkout girl
comes here looking for you?

314
00:25:25,762 --> 00:25:27,806
No, no, of course not.

315
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:30,475
I know you're not happy here.

316
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:34,980
You're not happy at work.
I know how men think.

317
00:25:35,355 --> 00:25:39,317
"I'm not happy here. I'm not
happy there. I'll be happy... here."

318
00:25:40,443 --> 00:25:42,821
No.
You make me happy... here.

319
00:25:43,446 --> 00:25:44,698
No.

320
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:49,077
- No, I make you feel trapped.
- No, you don't. It's not you.

321
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:52,956
How do you think that makes me
feel when I hear you say that?

322
00:25:52,997 --> 00:25:56,876
I didn't mean you.
It's me.

323
00:25:58,294 --> 00:26:02,215
I... I just feel lost.

324
00:26:07,178 --> 00:26:11,099
Kim was telling me
about this cattle drive thing.

325
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:12,433
Oh.

326
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:16,646
- Maybe you should go.
- What about Florida?

327
00:26:17,105 --> 00:26:20,274
You'll be miserable in Florida.
You'll make me miserable.

328
00:26:20,316 --> 00:26:22,735
- You hate my parents.
- I don't hate them.

329
00:26:22,777 --> 00:26:26,280
Come on, you have known my father
since you were 18 years old...

330
00:26:26,322 --> 00:26:28,825
...and you've never
called him by his name.

331
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:30,660
What is his name?

332
00:26:31,035 --> 00:26:33,454
It's a joke.
I was just joking.

333
00:26:33,955 --> 00:26:36,916
Look, I said I'm gonna go
and I'm gonna go.

334
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:39,377
You don't understand what I'm saying.

335
00:26:39,418 --> 00:26:43,172
I'm not saying it's all right
if you don't wanna come with us.

336
00:26:44,465 --> 00:26:47,093
I'm saying I don't want you to come.

337
00:26:51,555 --> 00:26:56,519
Go away with Ed.
Take Phil.

338
00:26:56,727 --> 00:27:01,190
I am giving you these two weeks.
It's my present.

339
00:27:02,566 --> 00:27:04,652
Go and find your smile.

340
00:27:07,863 --> 00:27:09,657
What if I can't?

341
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:15,496
We'll jump off that bridge
when we come to it.

342
00:28:00,207 --> 00:28:02,668
My ass hurts just watching this.

343
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:05,295
Are you kidding?
This is fantastic!

344
00:28:07,631 --> 00:28:11,301
- I wonder if I could do that to Arlene?
- Forget about it already.

345
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:13,929
I could do it.
You've seen her ears.

346
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:18,809
- They must be the guests.
- I wish you hadn't worn this jacket.

347
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,895
- Why not? - It's got your
name and your picture on it.

348
00:28:21,937 --> 00:28:24,689
- It's a little grotesque.
- I'm proud of what I do.

349
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:27,400
So's the president.
He doesn't wear his picture.

350
00:28:27,442 --> 00:28:31,446
- Hi. You guys guests here?
- Yeah. We just got in. I'm Mitch Robbins.

351
00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:34,449
- Ed Furillo. I sell sporting goods.
- Show him your jacket.

352
00:28:34,491 --> 00:28:36,326
I'm Phil Berquist.

353
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:39,704
I committed adultery.
Lost my job and my family.

354
00:28:40,914 --> 00:28:44,042
- His jacket's being made.
- Oh, yeah.

355
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:47,295
I'm Ben Jessup and this
is my son, Steve Jessup.

356
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:49,506
- Where you from?
- Baltimore.

357
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:52,675
- We have a dental practice there.
- You're both dentists?

358
00:28:52,717 --> 00:28:56,846
Yes. We're black and we're dentists.
Let's not make an issue out of it.

359
00:28:57,138 --> 00:29:00,391
They're not making an issue.
You're making an issue.

360
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:02,477
- Hi.
- Hello.

361
00:29:03,394 --> 00:29:06,731
- Isn't this great?
- We're Ira and Barry Shalowitz.

362
00:29:06,898 --> 00:29:10,318
- Ira and Barry, that's like the ice cream.
- No, that's us.

363
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,072
- We make Ira and Barry's ice cream.
- Really? I love that ice cream.

364
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:18,034
But on the commercials, it's
a different Ira and Barry. It's two...

365
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:20,453
- Good-looking guys.
- Models.

366
00:29:21,412 --> 00:29:23,790
If it was us, could you eat?

367
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:27,293
Who is that?

368
00:29:30,088 --> 00:29:34,634
Hi.
I'm Bonnie Rayburn.

369
00:29:36,427 --> 00:29:38,721
Actually, I was supposed
to meet somebody here...

370
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:42,308
...but I got the message at the airport
that she's not coming and...

371
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,519
...I feel really out of place.
I'm thinking of leaving.

372
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:46,854
No, no, stay.

373
00:29:48,898 --> 00:29:52,234
When I was alive,
I would have found her attractive.

374
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:56,530
Howdy.

375
00:29:56,656 --> 00:29:59,617
I'm Clay Stone
and this is my wife, Millie.

376
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:01,452
- How do.
- Howdy.

377
00:30:01,494 --> 00:30:05,915
Welcome to the Stone ranch. Believe it
or not, that work you saw a while ago...

378
00:30:05,956 --> 00:30:08,375
...y'all are gonna be doin' that
next two weeks.

379
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:09,752
Yahoo!

380
00:30:11,295 --> 00:30:13,839
- That's a good "yahoo", son.
- Thank you.

381
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:17,301
This ranch has been in my family
for five generations.

382
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:20,930
We've always tried to live here
by the code of the Old West.

383
00:30:20,971 --> 00:30:24,475
If you thought this was a dude ranch,
I hate to disappoint you.

384
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:27,728
This is not pretend.
This is a real working ranch.

385
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,024
We've gotta move these animals
from here to our ranch in Colorado.

386
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:33,156
This is gonna be great.

387
00:30:33,157 --> 00:30:36,236
You may feel like bunch of pigs
on roller skates for a while...

388
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:40,532
...but we're gonna be watching you.
We're gonna see how you sit a horse.

389
00:30:40,574 --> 00:30:44,536
And in a few days, you'll be rounding up
a herd and goin' after strays.

390
00:30:44,995 --> 00:30:48,999
And you're gonna be in some country
that's just as pretty as heaven.

391
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:52,586
Here's some folks you'll be
working with. This is TR and Jeff.

392
00:30:52,628 --> 00:30:56,507
They're professional cowboys. Our trail
boss will be in in a couple of days.

393
00:30:56,548 --> 00:30:59,593
This is the best Western chef going.

394
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:02,638
Cookie!
Tell'em what they're gonna eat.

395
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:06,391
You ain't gonna be gettin'
no nouveau almondine thin crust...

396
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:09,061
...bottled water, sauteed city food.

397
00:31:09,478 --> 00:31:12,147
Food's brown, hot-and plenty of it.

398
00:31:12,981 --> 00:31:19,112
It's not that bad! Now, we're gonna go
to work in the morning. And I mean work.

399
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:22,949
You came out here city slickers.
You're gonna go home cowboys.

400
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:34,544
- What do you think?
- You look like one of the Village People.

401
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:04,741
I'll take that shirt too.

402
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:12,332
Excuse me. Here, boy.
Here, boy!

403
00:32:46,908 --> 00:32:49,827
Hey! You did it again!
Boy, you're gettin' great.

404
00:32:50,661 --> 00:32:52,538
See?
There's nothin' too hard.

405
00:32:53,581 --> 00:32:56,042
OK. Good.
You'll do it this time.

406
00:32:58,336 --> 00:33:00,838
That's it.
Wrist, wrist, wrist, go.

407
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,841
- Will you stop kidding around?
- I'm not kidding around.

408
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:08,012
I'm not good with ropes. I can't even
take the string off a bakery box.

409
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:10,556
- This time, run!
- OK.

410
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:15,311
Woo-hoo!

411
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:17,188
Whoa!

412
00:33:17,438 --> 00:33:20,858
- Everyone can do it but you. It's
embrrassing. - It's not a competition, Ed.

413
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,861
Everything's a competition.
Life's a competition.

414
00:33:23,903 --> 00:33:25,905
Come on, try it again.

415
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,533
- How's it goin'?
- OK. Where have you been?

416
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,745
Oh, I was watching 'em castrate a horse.

417
00:33:34,455 --> 00:33:36,915
Well, I'm hungry.
How about you, hm?

418
00:33:36,957 --> 00:33:40,836
- Can I help you with that?
- No, thanks. I think I'm getting it.

419
00:33:42,504 --> 00:33:44,798
Are you?
Are you gettin' it?

420
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:49,178
- See what's going on?
- I'll take the big one.

421
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:51,138
Wait, wait a second.
We are guests here.

422
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,183
- Are you gonna wrestle the cowboys?
- I'm not gonna do nothing.

423
00:33:54,224 --> 00:33:56,894
Wait, wait. Hey.
Let me handle this, OK?

424
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:59,563
You know how you get.
It'll be High Noon.

425
00:34:00,189 --> 00:34:02,399
Come on.
Let me help you out.

426
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:04,610
Look, just leave me alone.

427
00:34:05,903 --> 00:34:08,280
I can't, you see.
I'm in love.

428
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,325
Hi, boys.
How are you?

429
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:15,245
I was just ropin' over there.
Thought I'd mosey on over.

430
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:18,707
You know, I've never moseyed before.
Hope I did it correctly.

431
00:34:18,749 --> 00:34:21,835
I've walked, I've ambled.
I even sashayed once.

432
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,713
But that was in front of the draft board.

433
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:30,886
Hello!

434
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:36,850
Rough corral.

435
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,686
- Bonnie, wanna rope with us?
- It's all right.

436
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:43,189
- I think that Bonnie's talking with us.
- She's fine right here.

437
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:47,694
Guys, what are you doing? This isn't
exactly '90s behaviour, I gotta be honest.

438
00:34:51,948 --> 00:34:55,118
- You stepped on my foot.
- He did not, you horse's ass.

439
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,662
- Ed.
- You want a piece o' this?

440
00:34:57,704 --> 00:35:00,457
- Any time, Zeke.
- How about right now, Stubby?

441
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:01,791
Fine.

442
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:28,401
- This man owes you an apology.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything.

443
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:30,945
- Not you. Him.
- Him. Of course.

444
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,410
No.

445
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:44,125
God, I'm sorry, ma'am.
That'll never happen again.

446
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,377
Yes, see that it doesn't.

447
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:50,965
I'm sorry, I thought
we were on the same...

448
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:52,842
You're doing fine.

449
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,639
You guys were drinking.

450
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:05,187
Don't let it happen again.

451
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:18,784
Ma'am.

452
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:28,544
Did you see that guy?

453
00:36:29,545 --> 00:36:32,840
That is the toughest man
I've ever seen in my life.

454
00:36:36,051 --> 00:36:40,014
Did you see how leathery he was?
He was like a saddlebag with eyes.

455
00:36:41,473 --> 00:36:45,269
Listen, it took a lot of courage
to do what you did. Thank you.

456
00:36:48,522 --> 00:36:50,149
I'm married.

457
00:37:00,492 --> 00:37:04,496
You're wrong, Ed. I'm tellin' you.
It was not a stupid thing to say.

458
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:07,499
It was. She says "Thanks"
and you say "I'm married"?

459
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:08,834
Yeah.

460
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:12,337
I don't want any false flirtings.

461
00:37:12,504 --> 00:37:15,465
"False flirtings"?
What if you're like me?

462
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:18,677
What if you don't encourage them
and they still chase you?

463
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:23,974
It doesn't happen. Women need a reason
to have sex. Men just need a place.

464
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:28,562
- Good night. I'm going to bed.
- Good night. Sleep tight.

465
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,818
- That was flirting.
- No. That was politeness.

466
00:37:35,694 --> 00:37:38,155
That was "Have a pleasant
and restly evening."

467
00:37:38,196 --> 00:37:41,825
No. That was "I like your ass.
Could I wear it as a hat?"

468
00:37:41,992 --> 00:37:45,996
Say, uh... Phil was telling us you
had a little trouble with Jeff and TR.

469
00:37:46,037 --> 00:37:49,833
- They were giving Bonnie a hard time.
- But he took care of it.

470
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,211
What made it worse was,
the trail boss comes over...

471
00:37:53,253 --> 00:37:54,588
Curly?

472
00:37:56,798 --> 00:37:59,050
His name is Curly?
Perfect.

473
00:37:59,718 --> 00:38:03,596
You know what the cook said about him?
He killed a man in a knife fight.

474
00:38:03,638 --> 00:38:06,307
He said he slit him from neck to nuts.

475
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:08,518
I'm not happy about this.

476
00:38:09,018 --> 00:38:12,105
This guy's a cowboy.
One of the last real men.

477
00:38:12,355 --> 00:38:14,315
He's untamed.
A mustang.

478
00:38:14,357 --> 00:38:17,861
We're trained ponies. It'll do us
good to be in his world a while.

479
00:38:17,902 --> 00:38:21,865
- "Do us good"? He was hanging the help.
- He was helping us.

480
00:38:22,282 --> 00:38:26,202
This guy is not normal. Did you see
his eyes? He's got crazy eyes.

481
00:38:26,703 --> 00:38:30,832
He's a lunatic. I'm telling you, we're going
into the wilderness being led by a lunatic.

482
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:33,584
He's behind me, isn't he?

483
00:38:35,962 --> 00:38:38,715
- Time to turn in.
- Good night.

484
00:38:48,724 --> 00:38:51,602
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything by that.

485
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:53,813
I crap bigger than you.

486
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,158
He's gonna kill me.

487
00:39:06,826 --> 00:39:09,036
Watch it!
Excuse me. Whoa.

488
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:14,792
- Whoa!
- Great! You are riding so much better.

489
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:17,920
Thanks.
I just talked to, uh... Nancy.

490
00:39:18,295 --> 00:39:21,674
- Who's Nancy?
- She's the, uh... the girl.

491
00:39:22,216 --> 00:39:24,760
Oh, the, uh... the girl.

492
00:39:25,136 --> 00:39:27,596
- She's not pregnant.
- Really?

493
00:39:27,805 --> 00:39:30,683
- Well, that's good, isn't it?
- For her.

494
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,602
So what does it mean?

495
00:39:34,103 --> 00:39:37,898
You know what I think?
Out there are all the answers.

496
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:42,027
No, Ed.
Out there...

497
00:39:45,572 --> 00:39:47,574
...are cows, and plenty of 'em.

498
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:50,828
We're gonna go 200 miles
with a big, moving stink.

499
00:39:50,995 --> 00:39:52,246
OK.

500
00:39:52,997 --> 00:39:56,583
You guys are probably too young to
remember this, but when I was a kid...

501
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:59,586
...I remember seeing
a movie called Red River.

502
00:39:59,628 --> 00:40:03,132
- Oh, I've seen it on TV.
- But not in the movie theatre.

503
00:40:03,382 --> 00:40:06,760
The big screen, with John Wayne
and Montgomery Clift.

504
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:10,264
Remember the scene,
the start of the cattle drive?

505
00:40:10,305 --> 00:40:13,141
- Dad...
- No, no, son. That's why we're here.

506
00:40:13,183 --> 00:40:15,936
- The "yee-ha" scene?
- The "yee-ha" scene.

507
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:20,315
Before they took the cattle out, those
cowboys waved their hats in the air...

508
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:23,068
...and yelled "Yee-ha!"

509
00:40:23,944 --> 00:40:27,322
- What do you say to that?
- All right! Move 'em out.

510
00:40:33,036 --> 00:40:34,996
- Yee-ha!
- Yee-ha!

511
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:37,582
- Ya-hoo!
- Ya-hoo!

512
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:39,251
Ya-hoo!

513
00:40:39,292 --> 00:40:40,585
Yee-ha.

514
00:40:42,087 --> 00:40:44,089
- Yee-haa!
- Yee-ha!

515
00:40:45,924 --> 00:40:47,801
- Yee-ha!
- Yee-ha!

516
00:40:47,843 --> 00:40:49,219
Yee-ha!

517
00:40:49,928 --> 00:40:52,931
- Feel like a schmuck?
- Oh, yeah. A big schmuck.

518
00:40:52,973 --> 00:40:54,683
Yee-haa!

519
00:40:56,184 --> 00:40:58,103
We'll see you in Colorado.

520
00:41:04,067 --> 00:41:06,319
* Fairy tales can come true

521
00:41:08,238 --> 00:41:10,281
* It can happen to you

522
00:41:11,324 --> 00:41:13,493
* If you're young at heart

523
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:18,706
* For it's hard, you will find

524
00:41:18,832 --> 00:41:20,875
* To be narrow of mind

525
00:41:22,418 --> 00:41:24,587
* If you're young at heart

526
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:29,425
* And if you should survive

527
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:31,553
* To 105

528
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:34,847
* Look at all you'll derive

529
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,642
* Just by being alive

530
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:44,440
* Now here is the best part

531
00:41:46,067 --> 00:41:48,152
* You have a head start

532
00:41:48,736 --> 00:41:52,490
* If you are amongst the very young

533
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:55,868
* At heart

534
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,925
Look, a stray.
You take him, Mitch.

535
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:15,429
- No, it's the first one. You get him, Ed.
- No, let Phil have him.

536
00:42:15,513 --> 00:42:18,808
- No, you get this one.
- Are you sure? There's gonna be plenty.

537
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:22,103
You get this one. I'll get the next one.
Then Ed, then you...

538
00:42:22,186 --> 00:42:24,855
Like a round robin?
That's good, yeah.

539
00:42:25,106 --> 00:42:27,608
- So who gets this one?
- You.

540
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,111
- Come on. Go!
- Out of shoot No. 9!

541
00:42:30,152 --> 00:42:31,862
Hey, go Mitchy!

542
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:36,450
No, no.
Don't go back there. No!

543
00:42:36,992 --> 00:42:39,578
Think I can't see you behind there?

544
00:42:39,995 --> 00:42:41,372
Hello!

545
00:42:41,997 --> 00:42:44,166
Come on, now.
Here we go.

546
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,002
Come on now.
Here we go. Come on.

547
00:42:47,044 --> 00:42:49,171
It's like chasing a mime.

548
00:42:54,134 --> 00:42:55,886
Yee-ha, cowboy!

549
00:42:57,137 --> 00:42:59,473
- All right!
- All right, Mitchy!

550
00:42:59,515 --> 00:43:01,433
I did it!
All right!

551
00:43:03,143 --> 00:43:05,145
Uh-oh.
Hey, moonwalk.

552
00:43:07,022 --> 00:43:11,527
I'd like to thank
everybody for helping me get my stray in.

553
00:43:12,611 --> 00:43:15,155
All right, all right.
Come on back.

554
00:43:15,197 --> 00:43:19,117
All right, now, easy on the clutch.
Cut the wheel! Cut it, cut it.

555
00:43:19,201 --> 00:43:23,247
That's it. Straight back and park
and lock it. You got the keys, sir?

556
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:28,043
Whoo! I wish the kids coulda seen that.

557
00:43:29,294 --> 00:43:31,338
Dump it into the personal,
then make out the cheque.

558
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,175
- He should know. He's our accountant.
- You're our accountant.

559
00:43:35,384 --> 00:43:38,887
- Don't... Just get a Mets score.
- Arnold, I'm losing you.

560
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:41,139
We're going behind a butte.

561
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,892
Arnold?
Arnold, what's the Mets score?

562
00:43:43,934 --> 00:43:45,977
The Mets... I lost him.

563
00:44:12,462 --> 00:44:15,173
Boy, that saddle's having all the fun.

564
00:44:15,465 --> 00:44:17,425
You have, like, a half-track mind.

565
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:20,804
- You wouldn't screw her brains out?
- Lovely image.

566
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:25,517
It ranks up there with my other favourite
of yours: "Bang the shit out of her."

567
00:44:26,684 --> 00:44:29,646
I'm sorry if I offended
your delicate sensibilities.

568
00:44:29,687 --> 00:44:33,274
- You were staring at her pretty good.
- That's different.

569
00:44:33,316 --> 00:44:35,276
- Different?
- Yeah.

570
00:44:35,777 --> 00:44:39,322
Look. I go to an art gallery,
right? And I see a Picasso.

571
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:43,159
- Oh, she's a Picasso now?
- No, she's not a Picasso.

572
00:44:43,409 --> 00:44:45,370
If she was, she'd have three tits.

573
00:44:45,411 --> 00:44:47,833
What I'm saying is if
I see a nice painting,

574
00:44:47,834 --> 00:44:50,416
I look at it, but I don't
pull it off the wall.

575
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:52,377
Let me ask you this.

576
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:56,214
What if you could have great sex
with someone attractive...

577
00:44:56,255 --> 00:44:58,091
...and Barbara would never find out?

578
00:44:58,132 --> 00:45:01,094
It's a big trap. I mean,
look what happened to Phil.

579
00:45:01,135 --> 00:45:04,055
The girl came to his house,
then she came to my house.

580
00:45:04,096 --> 00:45:05,389
Yeah.

581
00:45:06,557 --> 00:45:10,561
- Let's say a spaceship lands.
- Good, reality. Are you listening to this?

582
00:45:10,603 --> 00:45:14,565
A spaceship lands and the most beautiful
woman you ever saw gets out.

583
00:45:14,607 --> 00:45:18,527
All she wants to do is have
the greatest sex in the universe with you.

584
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:22,573
- Could happen.
- When it's over, she flies away for ever.

585
00:45:23,032 --> 00:45:26,702
No one will ever know.
You're telling me you wouldn't do it?

586
00:45:27,036 --> 00:45:29,908
No. It just what you describing
actually happened to my cousin

587
00:45:29,909 --> 00:45:32,917
Ronald. And his wife did find out
about it at the beauty parlour.

588
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:35,920
- They know everything there.
- Forget about it.

589
00:45:35,961 --> 00:45:39,423
I'm saying it wouldn't make
it all right if Barbara didn't know.

590
00:45:39,465 --> 00:45:42,384
I'd know, and I wouldn't
like myself. That's all.

591
00:45:42,426 --> 00:45:46,514
- Pay attention, girls. We got strays.
- Hi, Curly. Kill anyone today?

592
00:45:47,556 --> 00:45:49,475
Day ain't over yet.

593
00:45:56,357 --> 00:45:58,734
I wonder what Barbara's doing.

594
00:45:58,984 --> 00:46:02,071
You're really with just
one woman for 15 years? Just one?

595
00:46:02,112 --> 00:46:06,325
Yes, Ed. I'm married. I caught my limit.
Why are you after me about this?

596
00:46:08,535 --> 00:46:13,165
Let's say... all your life, for breakfast,
you eat from the Kellogg's variety pack.

597
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:17,503
- And a spaceship lands.
- No. Then you don't get the variety pack.

598
00:46:17,628 --> 00:46:21,632
You pick one, your favourite one,
and you just get that one from then on.

599
00:46:21,673 --> 00:46:25,010
Every day for the rest of your life,
the same cereal.

600
00:46:25,052 --> 00:46:28,597
Then you wake up one morning...
and you're just not hungry any more.

601
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:30,807
You can't get an erection.

602
00:46:31,683 --> 00:46:34,645
Hey, pal. I can get an erection
any time I want. Watch.

603
00:46:34,686 --> 00:46:39,441
Ed, please don't. Leave the stallion in the
corral. You'll knock me into the fire, OK?

604
00:46:42,527 --> 00:46:44,571
See, here's the thing.

605
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,949
- Kim wants to have kids.
- And you don't?

606
00:46:48,617 --> 00:46:51,787
I say it's because
we wouldn't have as much fun.

607
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,080
But that's not the reason.

608
00:46:54,122 --> 00:46:57,501
Having a kid, that's heavy.
That's a real commitment.

609
00:46:58,001 --> 00:47:02,088
That's saying I'm never gonna be with
another woman for the rest of my life.

610
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:04,591
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.

611
00:47:04,633 --> 00:47:07,761
I have no life.
We're all agreed on that, right?

612
00:47:07,886 --> 00:47:09,930
- Right.
- OK.

613
00:47:09,971 --> 00:47:12,439
Your big problem
is that you're married...

614
00:47:12,474 --> 00:47:15,442
...to this gorgeous
24-year-old underwear model...

615
00:47:15,477 --> 00:47:20,023
...who thinks the sun rises and sets in
your pants, and that's not enough for you?

616
00:47:20,482 --> 00:47:23,693
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't understand.

617
00:47:24,486 --> 00:47:27,655
- I don't wanna screw around on Kim.
- So don't.

618
00:47:28,073 --> 00:47:29,324
Oh.

619
00:47:29,491 --> 00:47:31,743
From the king of restraint.

620
00:47:31,785 --> 00:47:35,121
- What does that mean?
- It means that's pretty smug advice...

621
00:47:35,163 --> 00:47:39,667
...from a man who mounted an 18-year-old
checkout girl on the day-old bread rack.

622
00:47:39,709 --> 00:47:43,046
- She's 20, and shut up.
- Let me get you hot, Phil.

623
00:47:43,213 --> 00:47:46,466
- "I need a price, register nine."
- Cut it out.

624
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:50,803
What'd you use for protection?
Paper or plastic?

625
00:47:50,887 --> 00:47:53,348
- Come on!
- We're on vacation!

626
00:47:57,894 --> 00:48:01,522
- You're spookin' the cattle.
- We were just fooling around.

627
00:48:01,564 --> 00:48:03,357
See you tomorrow.

628
00:48:06,027 --> 00:48:07,403
Sunup.

629
00:48:14,952 --> 00:48:16,412
- Morning.
- Hi.

630
00:48:16,454 --> 00:48:19,457
- You done with that?
- Yeah, help yourself.

631
00:48:19,498 --> 00:48:21,667
See, Mom, we're keeping clean.

632
00:48:21,709 --> 00:48:24,503
It's cold... but I'm a real pioneer man.

633
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:33,971
- Morning.
- Good morning.

634
00:48:35,556 --> 00:48:38,476
Come on, guys.
You're sorry, you're sorry.

635
00:48:38,893 --> 00:48:40,811
Let's make up, huh?

636
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:48,444
All right.

637
00:48:50,279 --> 00:48:52,656
- My fault.
- No, it's all right.

638
00:48:52,698 --> 00:48:56,702
Gotta celebrate. I got a special treat.
I'm gonna make fresh coffee.

639
00:48:56,827 --> 00:49:00,581
Battery-operated. Instantly grinds
its own beans. Only 19.95.

640
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,084
- Come on, why live like animals?
- That's great.

641
00:49:04,126 --> 00:49:06,045
First cup's for my good friend Phil.

642
00:49:06,086 --> 00:49:09,590
When we were kids, he used to
let me watch his sister undress.

643
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,593
I never forgot it, Phil...
cos I still do it. OK.

644
00:49:20,726 --> 00:49:23,395
Wow.
Something's spookin' the cattle.

645
00:49:23,645 --> 00:49:26,273
Look, look.
The cows are going away.

646
00:49:30,986 --> 00:49:33,864
- Wow, look at 'em go.
- That is amazing.

647
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:36,533
- Stampede!
- We gotta get 'em.

648
00:49:39,453 --> 00:49:40,412
Whoa!

649
00:49:40,454 --> 00:49:43,582
- Beautiful. Get that in the frame.
- I got it.

650
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:01,516
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die. Oh, God.

651
00:50:01,558 --> 00:50:03,518
They're comin' at us!

652
00:50:13,445 --> 00:50:16,239
- Come on!
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

653
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:29,377
Bonnie, there's a stampede...

654
00:50:29,419 --> 00:50:31,129
...in your tent.

655
00:51:35,318 --> 00:51:36,861
City folk.

656
00:51:44,452 --> 00:51:50,332
I'm sorry. I mean, I was just tryin'
to make a cup of coffee. That's all.

657
00:51:52,501 --> 00:51:54,879
It was... it was French roast.

658
00:51:55,963 --> 00:51:59,884
There's still a few head missin'.
Must have gone into that canyon.

659
00:51:59,967 --> 00:52:02,970
- TR and I'll get 'em.
- No, I'll get 'em...

660
00:52:03,512 --> 00:52:05,097
...with you.

661
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:08,267
- Me?
- Yeah.

662
00:52:08,976 --> 00:52:12,062
- You're comin' with me.
- Just the two of us?

663
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:17,526
You move the herd.
I'll catch up.

664
00:52:17,651 --> 00:52:20,446
- You mean, we'll catch up.
- Let's go.

665
00:52:32,499 --> 00:52:33,792
Bye.

666
00:52:36,503 --> 00:52:41,008
Curly, did I ever show you pictures of
my wife and kids? I'm their sole support.

667
00:52:42,509 --> 00:52:45,137
- Is he gonna be all right?
- Sure.

668
00:52:45,304 --> 00:52:49,224
Curly's just trying to scare him.
You know Mitch. He's a wise ass.

669
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:52,728
If anything happens to him...

670
00:52:53,812 --> 00:52:56,023
...I'm going after Barbara.

671
00:53:02,362 --> 00:53:05,866
Throw a rope on this 'un so we
can go after the others. Rope him.

672
00:53:05,907 --> 00:53:08,994
I'm not good at it.
I have a roping disability.

673
00:53:22,591 --> 00:53:24,968
Be right with you.

674
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:32,559
Jesus Christ.

675
00:53:36,563 --> 00:53:39,023
Hey.
See, I'm good at this part.

676
00:53:39,566 --> 00:53:41,067
Throw it.

677
00:53:51,786 --> 00:53:54,664
You know what just occurred to me?
Roping is stupid.

678
00:53:54,706 --> 00:53:58,376
This is a cow, not a gazelle.
Watch. Get off the horse, huh?

679
00:54:02,046 --> 00:54:05,675
Then you walk up to the cow.
Look how good this is working.

680
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:10,263
Then you say "Hi, Bob Vila for This
Old Herd. We're gonna rope you today."

681
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:14,058
Then you take Mr Loop
and put it around the head of Mr Cow.

682
00:54:19,939 --> 00:54:22,692
What's wrong with that?

683
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:28,781
- That!
- I'm on vacation!

684
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,961
- Is that it?
- That's it.

685
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:48,342
- What are we doing?
- Making camp.

686
00:54:49,218 --> 00:54:53,389
Too late to catch up with the herd
before dark. We'll catch up tomorrow.

687
00:54:54,223 --> 00:54:57,226
You mean we're gonna
sleep out here? Just...

688
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:00,896
That's right.

689
00:55:04,233 --> 00:55:06,443
Oh, God.
It's Deliverance.

690
00:55:16,036 --> 00:55:18,122
Getting ready to shave?

691
00:55:18,747 --> 00:55:22,418
You make a lot of... smart remarks
at my expense, don't you?

692
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:27,047
I'm joking.
I do with everybody.

693
00:55:29,091 --> 00:55:30,926
It's just my way.

694
00:55:31,552 --> 00:55:33,846
I don't understand that way.

695
00:55:40,727 --> 00:55:42,437
Put that away.

696
00:55:47,651 --> 00:55:49,778
I said... put that away.

697
00:55:54,074 --> 00:55:58,036
You know, the first time I tried
to talk to you, you embarrassed me.

698
00:55:58,078 --> 00:56:02,499
So I teased you a little bit, which maybe
I shouldn't have done. So I'm sorry.

699
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:05,585
Now you're playing with your knife,
trying to frighten me...

700
00:56:05,627 --> 00:56:08,130
...which you're doing a good job...

701
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:12,092
But if you're gonna kill me...
get on with it.

702
00:56:12,134 --> 00:56:14,261
If not, shut the hell up.

703
00:56:16,096 --> 00:56:17,889
I'm on vacation.

704
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:46,960
* See them tumbling down

705
00:56:49,337 --> 00:56:51,923
* Pledging their love to the ground

706
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:55,260
* Lonely but free I'll be found

707
00:56:56,344 --> 00:56:59,430
* Driftin' along
with the tumblin' tumbleweeds

708
00:57:03,351 --> 00:57:05,728
* Cares of the past are behind

709
00:57:07,355 --> 00:57:09,691
* Nowhere to go but I'll find

710
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,821
* Just where the trail will wind

711
00:57:17,365 --> 00:57:20,451
* Drifting along
with the tumblin' tumbleweeds

712
00:57:29,585 --> 00:57:32,171
Do you know any show tunes?

713
00:57:32,338 --> 00:57:35,841
The second it's over,
she'll get back into her spaceship...

714
00:57:35,883 --> 00:57:37,802
...and fly away for eternity.

715
00:57:37,843 --> 00:57:40,596
- Would you do it?
- Is she a redhead?

716
00:57:42,348 --> 00:57:43,849
Could be.

717
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:46,644
I like redheads.

718
00:57:50,856 --> 00:57:53,275
- You ever been married?
- No.

719
00:57:55,861 --> 00:57:57,905
You ever been in love?

720
00:57:59,865 --> 00:58:01,283
Once...

721
00:58:02,368 --> 00:58:04,870
I was drivin' a herd across the Panhandle.

722
00:58:04,912 --> 00:58:06,747
- Texas.
- Mm-hm.

723
00:58:08,499 --> 00:58:11,919
Passed near this little dirt farm
round about sundown.

724
00:58:13,504 --> 00:58:16,382
Out in the field was this young woman...

725
00:58:16,507 --> 00:58:18,759
...working down in the dirt.

726
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:22,763
Just about then,
she stood up to stretch her back.

727
00:58:25,516 --> 00:58:31,021
She was wearing a little cotton dress,
and the settin' sun was right behind her...

728
00:58:32,022 --> 00:58:34,942
...showing the shape
that God had given her.

729
00:58:35,526 --> 00:58:37,236
What happened?

730
00:58:38,779 --> 00:58:41,365
I just turned around and rode away.

731
00:58:42,282 --> 00:58:43,575
Why?

732
00:58:45,285 --> 00:58:48,580
I figured it wasn't gonna get
any better than that.

733
00:58:48,789 --> 00:58:52,042
Yeah, but you could've been,
you know... with her.

734
00:58:52,209 --> 00:58:54,169
I been with lots of women.

735
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:57,923
Yeah, but, you know, she could've
been the love of your life.

736
00:58:58,215 --> 00:58:59,633
She is.

737
00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:03,762
That's great.
That's... not great.

738
00:59:04,429 --> 00:59:08,600
No, that's wrong. You passed up
something that might have been terrific.

739
00:59:08,934 --> 00:59:11,937
- My choice.
- I never could have done that.

740
00:59:11,978 --> 00:59:13,855
That's your choice.

741
00:59:14,773 --> 00:59:18,652
A cowboy leads a different kind of life.
When there were cowboys.

742
00:59:20,904 --> 00:59:22,864
We're a dyin' breed.

743
00:59:25,492 --> 00:59:27,911
Still means somethin' to me, though.

744
00:59:27,953 --> 00:59:31,748
In a couple of days,
we'll move this herd across the river...

745
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:35,877
...drive 'em through the valley.

746
00:59:38,463 --> 00:59:41,257
There's nothin' like bringin' in a herd.

747
00:59:41,633 --> 00:59:44,636
See, now that's great.
Your life makes sense to you.

748
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:50,392
- What's so funny?
- You city folk worry about a lot of shit.

749
00:59:51,184 --> 00:59:54,813
Shit? My wife basically told me
she doesn't want me around.

750
00:59:55,647 --> 00:59:57,482
Is she a redhead?

751
00:59:57,649 --> 01:00:00,443
- I'm just saying...
- How old are you?

752
01:00:00,652 --> 01:00:02,278
- 38.
- 39.

753
01:00:03,071 --> 01:00:06,324
Y'all come up here about
the same age. Same problems.

754
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:09,535
Spend about 50 weeks a year
gettin' knots in your rope.

755
01:00:09,577 --> 01:00:12,997
Then you think two weeks
up here'll untie 'em for you.

756
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:15,500
None of you get it.

757
01:00:18,086 --> 01:00:21,464
- Do you know what the secret of life is?
- No. What?

758
01:00:23,007 --> 01:00:25,093
- This.
- Your finger?

759
01:00:25,635 --> 01:00:27,845
One thing.
Just one thing.

760
01:00:29,764 --> 01:00:33,184
You stick to that and
everything else don't mean shit.

761
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:36,437
That's great,
but... what's the one thing?

762
01:00:37,855 --> 01:00:40,358
That's what you gotta figure out.

763
01:00:48,407 --> 01:00:50,409
Oh, damn it.
Come on!

764
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,087
- What's goin' on?
- This cow's having a baby.

765
01:01:05,382 --> 01:01:07,343
I noticed it when we found her.

766
01:01:07,384 --> 01:01:11,263
I was hopin' she'd make it
through the drive, but... she's ready.

767
01:01:11,388 --> 01:01:13,849
Does she do it herself?
Or do you help her?

768
01:01:13,891 --> 01:01:16,268
I'll hold her down.
You deliver the calf.

769
01:01:16,435 --> 01:01:19,438
Excuse me? Hello?
Why don't I hold her down?

770
01:01:20,356 --> 01:01:24,443
You don't know how. She'll kick you
and kill you, and her and the calf.

771
01:01:24,485 --> 01:01:27,863
- That's too much for me to carry back.
- I see your point.

772
01:01:27,905 --> 01:01:29,865
Come on.
She's ready.

773
01:01:32,076 --> 01:01:33,994
- I...
- She's burstin'!

774
01:01:34,036 --> 01:01:36,580
Oh, God.
There's gonna be bursting?

775
01:01:36,622 --> 01:01:39,083
Just reach in and pull out the calf.

776
01:01:53,889 --> 01:01:55,182
Ooh.

777
01:02:00,812 --> 01:02:04,942
- You know, this was not in the brochure.
- She needs help, goddamn it!

778
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:12,741
What's taking so long?
Do you see the head?

779
01:02:15,452 --> 01:02:16,453
Ugh.

780
01:02:20,457 --> 01:02:22,959
- I only see a tail.
- Oh, shit.

781
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:25,921
It's turned the wrong way.
Get it out.

782
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:29,007
Uh-oh.

783
01:02:29,132 --> 01:02:31,176
- My watch came off.
- Now!

784
01:02:31,218 --> 01:02:33,178
- It was a gift!
- Do it!

785
01:02:35,972 --> 01:02:37,432
Come on.

786
01:02:55,825 --> 01:02:58,870
- Oh, Jesus.
- Look what I did! I made a cow.

787
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:06,586
This is unbelievable.
This is amazing.

788
01:03:08,087 --> 01:03:10,006
He looks like you.

789
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:12,800
Look at him.
Yeah. Get up.

790
01:03:14,177 --> 01:03:16,304
Oh, shit.

791
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:20,767
Look at this.
He's walking already.

792
01:03:21,184 --> 01:03:24,646
He's a genius. He gets that
from my side of the family.

793
01:03:25,104 --> 01:03:27,190
We all walk very early.

794
01:03:29,233 --> 01:03:32,612
I'm gonna name him Norman.
You know, cos years ago...

795
01:03:37,575 --> 01:03:40,369
- Why did you do that?
- She was dying.

796
01:03:42,663 --> 01:03:44,707
And she was suffering.

797
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:48,127
We saved the calf.

798
01:03:53,257 --> 01:03:55,092
Good job, cowboy.

799
01:04:08,814 --> 01:04:11,859
There you go, Norman.
You are only down a quart.

800
01:04:11,901 --> 01:04:15,654
That's really wonderful.
You got him to drink from the bottle.

801
01:04:16,489 --> 01:04:19,492
Yeah, thank God,
cos my nipples were killing me.

802
01:04:21,035 --> 01:04:25,039
What do you think? What would be
the perfect flavour with this meal?

803
01:04:25,748 --> 01:04:27,708
- Cherry vanilla?
- No.

804
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:31,921
If it was Chinese food, right on
the money, but this... toasted almonds.

805
01:04:35,424 --> 01:04:36,300
What's goin' on?

806
01:04:36,342 --> 01:04:40,387
Barry can pick out the right flavour
of ice cream to follow any meal.

807
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:44,266
Go ahead.
Challenge him.

808
01:04:45,726 --> 01:04:48,520
- "Challenge him"?
- Come on.

809
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:51,565
Franks and beans.

810
01:04:51,732 --> 01:04:55,319
Scoop of chocolate, scoop of vanilla.
Don't waste my time.

811
01:05:03,785 --> 01:05:05,621
Come on.
Push me.

812
01:05:11,418 --> 01:05:13,503
- Sea bass.
- Grilled?

813
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,090
- Sauteed.
- I'm with ya.

814
01:05:17,883 --> 01:05:19,801
Potatoes au gratin.

815
01:05:23,263 --> 01:05:24,806
Asparagus.

816
01:05:32,522 --> 01:05:34,107
Rum raisin.

817
01:05:36,818 --> 01:05:38,069
Woof!

818
01:05:38,111 --> 01:05:40,822
Woof what?
How do you know he's right?

819
01:05:41,156 --> 01:05:45,493
How do we know? 1400 retail outlets
across the country. That's how we know.

820
01:05:48,121 --> 01:05:49,372
Woof!

821
01:05:49,414 --> 01:05:51,875
Will you stop
with Roberto Clemente?

822
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:55,337
Henry Aaron was the greatest
right fielder of our generation.

823
01:05:55,378 --> 01:05:58,757
- Could he run like Clemente?
- I'm gonna say one thing to you.

824
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:00,842
755 home runs.
Goodbye.

825
01:06:01,968 --> 01:06:03,928
Clemente was killed in a plane crash.

826
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:07,474
- You're gonna blame that on Aaron?
- No. I'm just saying.

827
01:06:07,515 --> 01:06:10,852
- Oh, baseball.
- You got something against baseball?

828
01:06:11,227 --> 01:06:15,899
I used to live with a guy who was like a
baseball encyclopaedia. I just got flashes.

829
01:06:16,024 --> 01:06:18,985
- You broke up with him cos of baseball?
- Uh, no.

830
01:06:19,027 --> 01:06:22,780
We had different needs. I needed him
to treat me decently and get a job.

831
01:06:22,822 --> 01:06:25,700
He needed to empty
my bank account and leave.

832
01:06:25,742 --> 01:06:27,035
Ouch.

833
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:31,331
- So do you hate baseball?
- No, I like baseball.

834
01:06:31,581 --> 01:06:35,585
I just never understood how you guys
can spend so much time discussing it.

835
01:06:35,626 --> 01:06:38,337
I've been to games,
but I don't memorise...

836
01:06:38,379 --> 01:06:41,549
...who played third base
for Pittsburgh in 1960.

837
01:06:41,883 --> 01:06:43,134
Don Hoak.

838
01:06:43,176 --> 01:06:46,262
- Beat you.
- See, that's exactly what I mean.

839
01:06:46,762 --> 01:06:50,141
So what do you and your friends
talk about out there?

840
01:06:50,933 --> 01:06:52,810
Well... real life.

841
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:57,565
Relationships.
Are they working, are they not?

842
01:06:57,982 --> 01:06:59,984
Who's she seeing.
Is that working?

843
01:07:00,026 --> 01:07:02,695
- No contest. We win.
- Why?

844
01:07:03,654 --> 01:07:07,783
Honey, if that were
as interesting as baseball...

845
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:11,328
...they'd have cards for it
and sell it with gum.

846
01:07:13,122 --> 01:07:16,709
Ed, I see by the sun
it's time for you to hibernate again.

847
01:07:17,376 --> 01:07:19,962
You're right, I suppose.
I guess it is childish...

848
01:07:20,004 --> 01:07:22,381
...but when I was about 18...

849
01:07:23,466 --> 01:07:27,386
...and my dad and I couldn't
communicate about anything at all...

850
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:30,639
...we could still talk about baseball.

851
01:07:31,765 --> 01:07:33,642
Now that was real.

852
01:07:38,731 --> 01:07:41,358
You know what the secret of life is?

853
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,943
It's this.

854
01:07:44,486 --> 01:07:46,697
One thing.
Just one thing.

855
01:07:48,282 --> 01:07:50,951
- And what's that?
- I have no idea.

856
01:07:51,785 --> 01:07:54,246
But ask Curly cos he seems to know.

857
01:07:54,288 --> 01:07:57,166
- Curly knows the secret of life?
- Yeah.

858
01:07:57,791 --> 01:08:00,502
I'm gonna invite him over.
He's a very interesting guy.

859
01:08:00,544 --> 01:08:02,254
I'm sure he is.

860
01:08:09,011 --> 01:08:10,596
Hey, Curly.

861
01:08:11,597 --> 01:08:13,974
Curly?
Curl, you got a minute?

862
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:21,481
He is a real cowboy. He sleeps with his
eyes open so he can still watch the herd.

863
01:08:24,526 --> 01:08:26,153
Curl.
Curly?

864
01:08:42,335 --> 01:08:46,756
Is this all right? Do you need, like, a
licence or something to bury somebody?

865
01:08:47,257 --> 01:08:50,051
Nah. This is where
Curly'd wanna be buried.

866
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:53,638
He said he was a dying breed.
I didn't know he meant on this trip.

867
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:57,267
The man ate bacon at every meal.
I mean, you can't do that.

868
01:08:57,934 --> 01:09:00,061
Well, I guess that's it.

869
01:09:00,145 --> 01:09:03,940
Wait a minute. Shouldn't somebody
say something? Like a eulogy.

870
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:06,818
- Yeah.
- Cookie, you knew him best.

871
01:09:12,574 --> 01:09:17,036
Lord, we give you Curly.
Try not to piss him off.

872
01:09:17,829 --> 01:09:19,372
That's it?

873
01:09:19,664 --> 01:09:22,041
What else is there?
I got chicken burning.

874
01:09:22,083 --> 01:09:25,295
You're a warm man, Cookie.
Wait a second. I'll...

875
01:09:29,507 --> 01:09:31,759
What can I say about Curly?

876
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:35,013
I didn't know you well,
but I'll never forget you.

877
01:09:35,054 --> 01:09:38,516
You lived life on your terms -
simple, honest and brave.

878
01:09:40,518 --> 01:09:43,521
I'm glad for this short time
that we spent together.

879
01:09:43,563 --> 01:09:45,106
Amen.

880
01:09:45,565 --> 01:09:46,899
Amen.

881
01:09:54,907 --> 01:09:57,410
Do you think this is all right?
With them?

882
01:09:57,451 --> 01:10:01,622
All right, listen up. Ben, I want you
to take the left flank with TR and Bonnie.

883
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:04,125
I want you three boys to ride point.

884
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:06,961
I'm gonna push with Steve, Barry and Ira.

885
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:09,463
Yeah, they're pros.
It'll be OK.

886
01:10:34,446 --> 01:10:36,282
So long, cowboy.

887
01:10:53,924 --> 01:10:57,428
- You know, it makes you stop and think.
- Stop the clock.

888
01:10:57,469 --> 01:11:00,222
- That's 25 minutes. I win.
- Win what?

889
01:11:00,931 --> 01:11:04,852
I had under a half an hour
before you started to talk about death.

890
01:11:04,935 --> 01:11:07,396
Why would you think
I would talk about death?

891
01:11:07,437 --> 01:11:11,149
We just came from a funeral.
And it's your favourite subject.

892
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:13,819
It is not. I think
when you see a life end...

893
01:11:13,861 --> 01:11:16,863
...it's a natural time to think
about your own mortality.

894
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:19,575
No, it isn't.
Why do that to yourself?

895
01:11:19,866 --> 01:11:22,369
When somebody dies,
I don't change places with him.

896
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,830
I appreciate the fact that I'm not dead.

897
01:11:24,871 --> 01:11:28,375
Look at this. It's a beautiful day.
I'm here with my best friends.

898
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:31,086
We're driving a herd of cattle
across the plains.

899
01:11:31,128 --> 01:11:34,673
Pretty goddamn great.
It's one of the best days of my life.

900
01:11:34,715 --> 01:11:37,676
All right. What is the
best day of your life?

901
01:11:37,717 --> 01:11:41,304
- You mean ever?
- Yeah. Best day ever in your whole life.

902
01:11:41,721 --> 01:11:45,350
And you can't do when your kids
were born. That's too easy.

903
01:11:45,517 --> 01:11:47,060
I got one.

904
01:11:48,019 --> 01:11:51,022
I'm seven years old and my dad
takes me to Yankee Stadium.

905
01:11:51,064 --> 01:11:52,732
My first game.

906
01:11:53,024 --> 01:11:56,486
We're going in this long,
dark tunnel underneath the stands.

907
01:11:56,528 --> 01:12:00,573
I'm holding his hand and we come up
out of the tunnel into the light.

908
01:12:01,783 --> 01:12:06,413
It was huge. How green
the grass was. Brown the dirt.

909
01:12:07,288 --> 01:12:10,250
And that great green
copper roof. Remember?

910
01:12:10,417 --> 01:12:14,796
We had a black-and-white TV, so this
was the first game I ever saw in colour.

911
01:12:15,088 --> 01:12:17,340
I sat there the whole game
next to my Dad.

912
01:12:17,382 --> 01:12:19,759
He taught me how to keep score.

913
01:12:20,343 --> 01:12:22,262
Mickey hit one out.

914
01:12:22,846 --> 01:12:25,723
- Good day.
- I still have the programme.

915
01:12:27,517 --> 01:12:30,645
All right, what was
the worst day you ever had?

916
01:12:32,689 --> 01:12:36,150
Worst day. A couple of years ago,
Barbara finds a lump.

917
01:12:36,192 --> 01:12:38,152
- What?
- Jesus.

918
01:12:38,194 --> 01:12:41,322
- It scared the shit out of me.
- You never said anything.

919
01:12:41,364 --> 01:12:45,284
Yeah, well, it turned out to be
nothing. But that whole day was...

920
01:12:47,286 --> 01:12:49,664
- Yeah, but that was a good day.
- How?

921
01:12:49,705 --> 01:12:54,335
- Because it turned out to be nothing.
- Yeah, but the day until then was horrible.

922
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:56,671
Yeah, but it came out good.

923
01:12:56,712 --> 01:13:00,716
You're a real "the glass is half-empty"
kind of a guy, you know that?

924
01:13:00,758 --> 01:13:03,135
I don't know how Barbara can stand it.

925
01:13:03,177 --> 01:13:04,470
Yeah.

926
01:13:04,637 --> 01:13:07,098
All right. I got one.
My best day.

927
01:13:07,139 --> 01:13:09,308
The one about Arlene
and that loose step?

928
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:11,394
No.
No, my wedding day.

929
01:13:12,186 --> 01:13:14,647
- What?
- Yeah. Remember that day?

930
01:13:14,689 --> 01:13:20,444
Outdoor wedding. Arlene looked great.
Those water pills really worked.

931
01:13:20,945 --> 01:13:25,491
You guys are all smiling at me.
And my dad, in the front...

932
01:13:26,409 --> 01:13:29,078
...gives me a little wink... you know?

933
01:13:29,912 --> 01:13:33,707
I mean, he's not the warmest
of men... but he winked.

934
01:13:34,416 --> 01:13:37,002
I was the first to get married
and have a real job.

935
01:13:37,044 --> 01:13:39,672
I remember thinking "I'm grown-up."

936
01:13:40,548 --> 01:13:43,926
You know? "I'm not a goofball
any more. I made it."

937
01:13:45,553 --> 01:13:47,429
I felt like a man.

938
01:13:48,555 --> 01:13:50,891
It's the best day of my life.

939
01:13:51,725 --> 01:13:55,145
- What was your worst day?
- Every day since is a tie.

940
01:13:58,941 --> 01:14:02,444
All right, Ed. Your best day.
What is it, twins in a trapeze?

941
01:14:02,486 --> 01:14:04,947
- No, I don't wanna play.
- We did it.

942
01:14:04,988 --> 01:14:06,949
I don't feel like it.

943
01:14:07,157 --> 01:14:08,408
OK.

944
01:14:13,914 --> 01:14:17,251
I'm 14 and my mother and
father are fighting again.

945
01:14:17,417 --> 01:14:20,629
You know, because she caught
him again. Caught him!

946
01:14:20,671 --> 01:14:23,840
This time, the girl drove
by the house to pick him up.

947
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:30,597
I finally realised he wasn't just cheating
on my mother. He was cheating on us.

948
01:14:30,764 --> 01:14:36,603
So I told him. I said "You're bad
to us. We don't love you."

949
01:14:37,229 --> 01:14:41,233
"I'll take care of my mother and my sister.
We don't need you any more."

950
01:14:41,274 --> 01:14:44,611
He made like he was gonna
hit me, but I didn't budge.

951
01:14:44,736 --> 01:14:48,365
Then he turned around and he left.
Never bothered us again.

952
01:14:49,825 --> 01:14:53,328
But I took care of my mother
and my sister from that day on.

953
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:55,247
That's my best day.

954
01:14:56,456 --> 01:14:58,583
What was your worst day?

955
01:14:59,167 --> 01:15:00,669
Same day.

956
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:08,385
He gets the sign from Berra...

957
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:10,512
He gets the sign from Berra.
The pitch.

958
01:15:10,553 --> 01:15:11,846
Whoa!

959
01:15:24,526 --> 01:15:26,778
* Rollin', rollin', rollin"

960
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:28,988
* Keep them dogies rollin"

961
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,032
* Man, my ass is swollen

962
01:15:31,074 --> 01:15:32,575
* Rawhide!

963
01:15:33,034 --> 01:15:35,036
* Get 'em up, move 'em out,
wake 'em up, get 'em dressed

964
01:15:35,078 --> 01:15:36,996
* Get 'em shaved,
comb their hair, rawhide

965
01:15:37,038 --> 01:15:40,041
* Tie me down, tell me lies,
pull my hair, smack my thighs

966
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:42,543
* With a big wet strap of rawhide

967
01:15:57,391 --> 01:15:59,227
What is he doing?

968
01:16:02,355 --> 01:16:03,898
Whoa, boy!

969
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:07,318
- He's drunk, the old shithead.
- Where'd he get the liquor?

970
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,655
- How do I know that?
- Goddamn, we better get him outta there.

971
01:16:15,159 --> 01:16:18,037
Is that a happy face?

972
01:16:18,496 --> 01:16:20,039
He's nuts.

973
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:27,838
- He's throwing our food.
- Well, we'll...

974
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,174
We'll what?
We'll order out?!

975
01:16:39,058 --> 01:16:42,394
- He's headed for the ravine.
- I'm sure he sees it.

976
01:16:45,105 --> 01:16:46,899
Jump!

977
01:17:00,496 --> 01:17:02,998
What can you say about
Skyrocket and Buttercup?

978
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:07,169
- Let's just get out of here.
- Let's recap on what we've buried so far.

979
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:11,298
- Trail boss, two horses...
- I can't believe we buried horses.

980
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:15,636
The impact drove 'em into the ground.
We just covered 'em up with some dirt.

981
01:17:16,804 --> 01:17:20,098
- How do we move the food and the tents?
- Tents roll up.

982
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:23,393
We can pack enough food in
our saddlebags to get us there.

983
01:17:23,644 --> 01:17:25,437
OK.
Let's do it.

984
01:17:25,646 --> 01:17:29,274
The problem is Cookie.
Let's not forget his legs are broken.

985
01:17:29,524 --> 01:17:31,902
Oh, God, they're gonna shoot him.

986
01:17:31,944 --> 01:17:35,530
We put Cookie on this litter
so we can get him out of here.

987
01:17:35,656 --> 01:17:38,950
Me and TR are gonna stay
with you all and the herd.

988
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:42,120
We're gonna be hittin'
some pretty rough mountain country.

989
01:17:42,162 --> 01:17:46,375
There's a town, it's about half a day's
ride outta here. I can draw a map.

990
01:17:46,792 --> 01:17:49,669
Somebody's gotta take
Cookie. Volunteers?

991
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:59,513
- I guess Steve and I should go.
- Why?

992
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:02,724
He's injured and
we have medical training.

993
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:05,810
We're dentists!
Are we gonna give him a cleaning?

994
01:18:05,852 --> 01:18:08,855
We have a better chance
of helping than anyone, son.

995
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:11,733
- But you're having fun.
- Ride with me.

996
01:18:12,275 --> 01:18:14,486
It will still be fun.
Huh?

997
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,617
- That's really great of you, Ben, Steve.
- Thanks a lot.

998
01:18:20,658 --> 01:18:22,369
- Thanks, Ben.
- Good luck.

999
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:25,413
- Thank you, Dr Jessup.
- We would have gone, but...

1000
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:27,749
Good.
I'll make up that map.

1001
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:32,504
Hey, look. I found where
Cookie was hiding his whisky.

1002
01:18:32,545 --> 01:18:34,839
- You old coot.
- Hey, Jeff.

1003
01:18:37,675 --> 01:18:41,971
- Shouldn't we do something? - Let
'em have fun, then they'll sleep it off.

1004
01:18:44,182 --> 01:18:46,643
I knew we couldn't trust these guys.

1005
01:18:46,684 --> 01:18:50,146
I said "Tennis camp."
You said "Let's drive cattle."

1006
01:18:50,188 --> 01:18:52,482
Wait a minute.
I got an idea.

1007
01:18:56,486 --> 01:18:58,696
- Look at this.
- Norman.

1008
01:18:59,947 --> 01:19:02,950
- Norman.
- What are they doing with Norman?

1009
01:19:03,451 --> 01:19:06,120
Mitchy!
Mitchy, come on out and play.

1010
01:19:07,371 --> 01:19:10,708
- Don't go out there.
- What do you think, I'm nuts?

1011
01:19:13,044 --> 01:19:15,463
Mitch, do you like calf brains?

1012
01:19:18,216 --> 01:19:21,594
- This is over a cow.
- Here's your last chance.

1013
01:19:21,844 --> 01:19:25,556
- They won't hurt me. There's witnesses.
- Please be careful.

1014
01:19:26,098 --> 01:19:29,310
They're just gonna
embarrass me, so I'll let 'em.

1015
01:19:33,606 --> 01:19:36,859
Norman, have you been
bothering the cowboys again?

1016
01:19:37,443 --> 01:19:40,446
You raise them, you try
to teach them right from wrong...

1017
01:19:40,488 --> 01:19:44,742
...but they learn these things from
their friends. It's the school systems.

1018
01:19:49,622 --> 01:19:51,749
You're grounded, mister.

1019
01:19:53,334 --> 01:19:55,377
These cows today, huh?

1020
01:19:58,839 --> 01:20:00,966
You pansy-assed bastard.

1021
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:05,471
- Are you talking to me or Norman?
- You shit-nosed little faggot.

1022
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,140
Who, me?

1023
01:20:09,892 --> 01:20:13,896
Listen, guys. We have a group of people
here who came out for a good time...

1024
01:20:13,937 --> 01:20:17,357
...and to say the least,
it's been a little bit strange.

1025
01:20:19,276 --> 01:20:21,737
But we're counting on you
to get us through this.

1026
01:20:21,779 --> 01:20:26,742
So I'm asking you, please, why don't
you just go and sleep it off, huh?

1027
01:20:27,868 --> 01:20:29,620
Sleep this off.

1028
01:20:36,793 --> 01:20:38,211
Yee-ha!

1029
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:52,642
Put the gun down!
Put down the goddamn gun!

1030
01:20:58,190 --> 01:21:01,860
- Phil.
- I'm not gonna let him bully us any more.

1031
01:21:02,486 --> 01:21:05,113
- My father-in-law's a bully
- Phil.

1032
01:21:05,155 --> 01:21:06,865
I hate bullies!

1033
01:21:08,617 --> 01:21:11,286
Cos a bully doesn't just beat you up.

1034
01:21:11,995 --> 01:21:14,706
- He takes away your dignity.
- Phil!

1035
01:21:14,998 --> 01:21:16,625
I hate that.

1036
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,544
I really... hate that.

1037
01:21:22,964 --> 01:21:24,341
Sorry.

1038
01:21:27,677 --> 01:21:29,012
Bang!

1039
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:37,103
All right, you two
assholes, go sleep it off.

1040
01:21:42,775 --> 01:21:46,738
And let's have some peace and quiet
around here for Christ's sakes!

1041
01:21:48,573 --> 01:21:51,534
I'm tired.
I've been under a lot of stress.

1042
01:21:53,286 --> 01:21:55,663
I lost my wife.
I lost my job.

1043
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:01,461
And I've got some sort of rash...
from making in the bushes.

1044
01:22:08,342 --> 01:22:10,595
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1045
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:27,069
Phil, thanks.
That was amazing.

1046
01:22:29,155 --> 01:22:31,365
- What?
- You know, uh...

1047
01:22:32,658 --> 01:22:34,410
Oh, that.
Yeah.

1048
01:22:37,663 --> 01:22:40,332
Why don't you put the gun down, Phil?

1049
01:22:40,666 --> 01:22:44,170
Oh, you don't have to worry.
I know how to handle a gun.

1050
01:22:44,462 --> 01:22:46,922
I used to keep one at the store.

1051
01:22:46,964 --> 01:22:50,468
You lock up late at night,
there's a lot of cash around.

1052
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:56,223
You gotta make sure that
the register totals match the cash...

1053
01:22:56,473 --> 01:22:58,851
...and cheques and the coupons.

1054
01:22:59,977 --> 01:23:03,355
You got the order forms
to fill out for the next day.

1055
01:23:03,397 --> 01:23:06,775
You gotta check the stock.
I mean, there's a lot to do there.

1056
01:23:06,817 --> 01:23:09,069
It's a very responsible job.

1057
01:23:16,994 --> 01:23:18,579
Oh, Christ.

1058
01:23:21,373 --> 01:23:23,584
Oh, Phil.
Come on, Philly.

1059
01:23:24,877 --> 01:23:27,337
Come on, man.
It's not that bad.

1060
01:23:27,379 --> 01:23:31,216
I'm at a dead end. I'm almost
40 years old. I've wasted my life.

1061
01:23:32,342 --> 01:23:35,804
Yeah, but now you got
a chance to start over. You know?

1062
01:23:38,932 --> 01:23:41,435
Phil, remember when we were kids?

1063
01:23:42,144 --> 01:23:45,647
And we'd be playing ball and
the ball would get stuck up in a tree?

1064
01:23:45,689 --> 01:23:48,942
- And we'd yell "Do over!" Huh?
- Yeah.

1065
01:23:49,401 --> 01:23:53,488
Your life is a "do over".
You got a clean slate.

1066
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:56,825
I got no place to live.

1067
01:23:57,743 --> 01:24:01,580
I'm gonna get wiped out in the divorce
cos I committed adultery.

1068
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:05,459
So I may never even see my kids again.

1069
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,003
I'm alone.

1070
01:24:11,131 --> 01:24:13,341
How's that slate look now?

1071
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:17,596
Well, the fun continues.

1072
01:24:18,013 --> 01:24:20,098
- They're gone.
- Who?

1073
01:24:20,181 --> 01:24:22,517
Jeff and TR.
They skedaddled.

1074
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,896
They jumped on their horses and took off.

1075
01:24:26,938 --> 01:24:29,774
They probably thought
we'd get 'em in trouble.

1076
01:24:29,816 --> 01:24:32,569
Does anybody know
how to get where we're going?

1077
01:24:34,446 --> 01:24:38,324
- So we're talking death?
- Won't Ben and Steve send some help?

1078
01:24:38,366 --> 01:24:42,162
Maybe they won't. When they left,
we were still pretty much OK.

1079
01:24:42,454 --> 01:24:44,998
- Still, they might.
- "Might"?

1080
01:24:45,123 --> 01:24:47,625
We're hanging our lives on "might"?

1081
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:51,671
Let's not get hysterical, OK?
Calm down.

1082
01:24:52,046 --> 01:24:55,508
Now, for four days,
we've been going in this direction.

1083
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:59,178
- I think we keep going in that direction.
- Isn't that a little vague?

1084
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:04,142
Curly said there was a river and a valley.
We'll just have to do the best we can.

1085
01:25:04,183 --> 01:25:06,227
So you're saying we can drive this herd?

1086
01:25:06,269 --> 01:25:08,354
Herd?
Are you delirious?

1087
01:25:09,731 --> 01:25:13,359
We leave the herd.
We'll go ten times as fast without them.

1088
01:25:14,235 --> 01:25:17,238
But there's no pasture land up here.
There's no water.

1089
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,782
I don't think they can survive up here.

1090
01:25:19,824 --> 01:25:22,952
Not to sound cold-hearted,
but so-the-hell-what?

1091
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:27,707
They give us a trail boss with
a coronary and a bunch of drunks...

1092
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:30,209
...and we're supposed
to worry about the cattle?

1093
01:25:30,251 --> 01:25:33,629
- You're a nicer person than I am.
- No, you're right.

1094
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:37,383
The rest of you go ahead.
I'll drive the herd.

1095
01:25:37,425 --> 01:25:40,970
- What are you talking about?
- I think I can bring in the herd.

1096
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:43,556
No, you can't.
What are you, crazy?

1097
01:25:43,681 --> 01:25:46,809
You couldn't even manage your stores.
You had to bring in your cousin.

1098
01:25:46,851 --> 01:25:50,229
Mitch, you were right about
all the weekend warrior shit.

1099
01:25:50,271 --> 01:25:53,649
The war games, the parachuting.
That was all bullshit.

1100
01:25:53,774 --> 01:25:55,741
But this is really happening.

1101
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:59,029
No rules, no games.
Just "Can I do it?"

1102
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:03,200
It is a game. It's your regular
game, Ed. Don't you see it?

1103
01:26:03,235 --> 01:26:06,412
"Am I better than my father"?
Well, you are, OK?

1104
01:26:06,537 --> 01:26:09,582
- Look, I need to do this.
- It's impossible.

1105
01:26:10,124 --> 01:26:12,084
I'll do it with you.

1106
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:18,215
Phil. Phil, you have, like,
a day's worth of food and water left.

1107
01:26:18,465 --> 01:26:20,718
- We'll be all right.
- Maybe you won't.

1108
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:24,263
Why don't you accept that you
don't know what we're going through?

1109
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:26,724
I know exactly what you're going through.

1110
01:26:26,807 --> 01:26:29,145
You think bringing in
this herd is gonna make

1111
01:26:29,146 --> 01:26:31,687
all the broken pieces of
your life come together?

1112
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:34,648
Hey, you don't wanna do it,
don't do it. We wanna do it.

1113
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:37,818
- I'm not doing it.
- Don't do it. I'm not asking you to do it.

1114
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:40,017
You have been talking me into doing stuff

1115
01:26:40,018 --> 01:26:42,489
like this all my life,
and I am not doing it!

1116
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:45,492
What, are you deaf?
I'm not asking you to do it.

1117
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:46,868
Great!

1118
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:49,830
Come on, Phil.

1119
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,003
It's crazy.

1120
01:27:19,442 --> 01:27:24,197
We'll ride out together tomorrow
morning... without the herd.

1121
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:28,785
They can do whatever they want.

1122
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:50,223
Come on.
We've got cattle to move.

1123
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:57,272
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

1124
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,448
I'm not listening to you.
Goddamn cattle drive.

1125
01:28:00,483 --> 01:28:03,736
- Just do your job.
- I'm not listening to you any more.

1126
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:06,990
- Listen to the cows.
- Come on, you damn little dogies.

1127
01:28:07,323 --> 01:28:10,076
Hey, stop that!
Cut that out!

1128
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:11,103
What are you doing?

1129
01:28:11,104 --> 01:28:13,955
They're not cooperating. It's
just like bringin' up my kids.

1130
01:28:14,163 --> 01:28:17,500
- You take those. I'll take these.
- Hey, come back here.

1131
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:20,461
Hey! Stop!
Stop it!

1132
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:23,631
Stop!
Get back here!

1133
01:28:24,298 --> 01:28:27,343
Ah, the hell with you.
Who needs you, anyway?

1134
01:28:33,349 --> 01:28:35,101
What the he...?

1135
01:28:35,851 --> 01:28:37,728
How did I do that?

1136
01:28:41,357 --> 01:28:42,942
Hey, Mitch!

1137
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:50,157
It's Mitch!
Mitchy the Kid!

1138
01:28:51,158 --> 01:28:54,453
Curly said there's nothing
like bringing in a herd.

1139
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:08,133
Nice hat, partner.

1140
01:29:10,636 --> 01:29:11,595
Come on.

1141
01:29:11,637 --> 01:29:13,847
Hey, there's my little man.

1142
01:29:13,889 --> 01:29:17,643
Sorry I was late, but there was
so much traffic. Let's go. Ha!

1143
01:29:23,607 --> 01:29:26,110
Don't be ashamed.
I had the same problem.

1144
01:29:26,151 --> 01:29:28,612
Didn't you feel stupid?
I mean...

1145
01:29:29,113 --> 01:29:31,490
Didn't you feel... inadequate?

1146
01:29:31,615 --> 01:29:34,493
Yeah, for a while.
But then I overcame it.

1147
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:38,622
Can I explain it you again?
Promise me you won't get upset.

1148
01:29:38,664 --> 01:29:41,041
OK.
It's not gonna do any good.

1149
01:29:42,626 --> 01:29:46,964
OK. If you wanna watch one show, but
record another show at the same time...

1150
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:49,633
...the TV does not have
to be on channel three.

1151
01:29:49,675 --> 01:29:51,093
- It does.
- It doesn't.

1152
01:29:51,134 --> 01:29:54,638
If you're watching what you're
recording, it has to be on three.

1153
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:57,224
- The TV or the machine?
- The TV.

1154
01:29:57,641 --> 01:29:59,726
I can record something
I'm not watching?

1155
01:29:59,768 --> 01:30:03,271
Yes, that's the point.
You don't even need a TV to record.

1156
01:30:03,313 --> 01:30:05,774
- How would I see it?
- To see it, you need a TV.

1157
01:30:05,816 --> 01:30:08,652
Shut up. Just shut up.
He doesn't get it!

1158
01:30:09,236 --> 01:30:14,032
He'll never get it. It's been four hours.
The cows can tape something by now.

1159
01:30:14,241 --> 01:30:16,368
Forget about it, please!

1160
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:22,082
- How do you do the clock?
- You're dead. You are dead!

1161
01:30:44,896 --> 01:30:46,606
Yah! Yah!
Yah!

1162
01:30:47,399 --> 01:30:49,984
Let's go. Come on, Norman.
Keep up.

1163
01:30:50,902 --> 01:30:53,822
Norman, stay with the class.
Come on, boy.

1164
01:30:54,614 --> 01:30:56,115
Aw, shit.

1165
01:30:56,616 --> 01:30:59,494
- What do we do now?
- Like I should know?

1166
01:30:59,536 --> 01:31:03,122
- Come on, let's keep the herd together.
- Yeah, let's go.

1167
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:07,252
Let's go, Norman. Norman,
what are you? Gene Kelly? Let's go.

1168
01:31:21,557 --> 01:31:23,810
Easy, boy.
Whoa! Easy, boy.

1169
01:31:25,436 --> 01:31:27,188
Go!
Go, go, go!

1170
01:31:37,907 --> 01:31:40,368
We're doing great, guys.
We're driving 'em.

1171
01:31:40,409 --> 01:31:43,871
That's perfect. We're lost,
but we're making good time.

1172
01:31:43,913 --> 01:31:46,582
This is the way, guys.
I can feel it.

1173
01:32:04,433 --> 01:32:06,936
- Is there a way around?
- That could be a hundred miles.

1174
01:32:06,977 --> 01:32:10,029
- It could take days.
- Is this supposed to be here?

1175
01:32:10,064 --> 01:32:13,526
There's probably an easy place
to cross but we missed it.

1176
01:32:13,567 --> 01:32:16,445
- This could be the easy place!
- Oh, God.

1177
01:32:17,321 --> 01:32:22,034
We did the best we could. Let's just leave
the herd and get the hell outta here, huh?

1178
01:32:22,409 --> 01:32:25,037
No.
A cowboy doesn't leave his herd.

1179
01:32:25,955 --> 01:32:28,499
You are a sporting-goods salesman!

1180
01:32:31,335 --> 01:32:32,878
Not today.

1181
01:32:38,634 --> 01:32:40,219
Easy... OK.

1182
01:32:42,054 --> 01:32:44,932
I started this...
and I'm gonna finish it.

1183
01:32:45,974 --> 01:32:47,935
I'm gonna finish it.

1184
01:32:54,942 --> 01:32:58,362
It's fast, but it's not deep.
Come on, bring 'em down.

1185
01:32:59,821 --> 01:33:01,907
Come on!
Let's go!

1186
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:10,290
Oh, God.

1187
01:33:34,356 --> 01:33:36,441
Come on, move!
Move it!

1188
01:33:44,449 --> 01:33:46,493
Move it, now.
Come on.

1189
01:33:48,328 --> 01:33:49,662
Whoa!

1190
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:53,124
Shit.

1191
01:34:08,598 --> 01:34:12,518
Come on, boys! Come on, now.
Move it! Moo cow!

1192
01:34:12,894 --> 01:34:14,812
Go, baby!
Go, baby!

1193
01:34:15,063 --> 01:34:18,983
Hey, Phil. I'm 39 and
I'm saying "moo cow" in a river.

1194
01:34:19,859 --> 01:34:21,819
Do you believe this?

1195
01:34:22,362 --> 01:34:24,322
- We did it!
- Hey!

1196
01:34:40,129 --> 01:34:41,422
Yah!

1197
01:34:45,593 --> 01:34:47,178
Here we go!

1198
01:34:52,558 --> 01:34:53,976
Norman!

1199
01:34:55,686 --> 01:34:57,146
Oh, God.

1200
01:35:32,181 --> 01:35:33,515
Whoa!

1201
01:35:43,275 --> 01:35:44,693
Norman!

1202
01:35:47,196 --> 01:35:48,614
Norman!

1203
01:35:51,366 --> 01:35:53,118
Norman!
Norman!

1204
01:35:54,661 --> 01:35:56,079
Norman!

1205
01:36:00,042 --> 01:36:01,752
Got you.
Help!

1206
01:36:03,045 --> 01:36:04,922
Oh, my God.
Mitch!

1207
01:36:04,963 --> 01:36:07,591
- Hey, Ed!
- Help! Help me!

1208
01:36:10,886 --> 01:36:12,304
Oh, no.

1209
01:36:17,476 --> 01:36:18,852
Mitch!

1210
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:38,872
Oh, shit.

1211
01:37:12,697 --> 01:37:14,282
I'm coming!

1212
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,784
I'm coming!

1213
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:26,336
Come on!
Come on!

1214
01:37:27,086 --> 01:37:28,921
Come on!
Come on!

1215
01:37:46,189 --> 01:37:48,691
Gimme your hand.
Gimme your hand.

1216
01:37:56,032 --> 01:38:00,119
You're crazy. You talk about me,
but you're crazy.

1217
01:38:01,704 --> 01:38:05,041
- You coulda been killed!
- We almost lost you, pal.

1218
01:38:14,341 --> 01:38:15,926
Nice catch.

1219
01:38:17,845 --> 01:38:20,681
It was like Mays in the '54 World Series.

1220
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:23,851
- Vic Wertz.
- Vic Wertz.

1221
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:43,221
- Let's bring 'em in.
- Yee-ha!

1222
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,567
Great gobs of gooseshit!

1223
01:39:56,651 --> 01:39:58,611
It's them!
Ira! Ira!

1224
01:40:26,681 --> 01:40:28,308
Yahoo!

1225
01:40:50,246 --> 01:40:51,539
Whoo!

1226
01:41:02,675 --> 01:41:04,343
Whoo!
Yee-ha!

1227
01:41:12,435 --> 01:41:13,811
Yahoo!

1228
01:41:15,771 --> 01:41:17,148
Yahoo!

1229
01:41:22,361 --> 01:41:24,155
Way to go, guys.

1230
01:41:26,657 --> 01:41:28,284
- Hi.
- Hi.

1231
01:41:35,457 --> 01:41:37,293
Oh, Lordy, Lordy.

1232
01:41:41,714 --> 01:41:45,467
- Here's your herd.
- I'm as happy as a puppy with two peters.

1233
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:48,429
We had a search party out lookin' for you.

1234
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:51,557
- They didn't find us.
- Un-by-God-believable.

1235
01:41:52,474 --> 01:41:55,102
Bunch o' tenderfeet
bringin' in a herd.

1236
01:41:55,144 --> 01:41:58,689
Two weeks ago, you boys were as
worthless as henshit on a pump handle.

1237
01:41:58,730 --> 01:42:00,482
Look at you now!

1238
01:42:00,607 --> 01:42:03,527
I'm givin' your money back!

1239
01:42:04,403 --> 01:42:06,572
Now you're talking, Clay.

1240
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:10,993
Instead of the money, you think
my dad and I could come back and...

1241
01:42:11,034 --> 01:42:13,996
...take the cattle back to New Mexico?
- Really, son?

1242
01:42:14,037 --> 01:42:17,708
Ordinarily, that'd be great,
but this herd's not goin' back.

1243
01:42:18,375 --> 01:42:19,334
What do you mean?

1244
01:42:19,376 --> 01:42:22,421
I'm gettin' top dollar
from the meat company.

1245
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:27,300
- You mean these cows are...
- I thought you just moved 'em around?

1246
01:42:27,342 --> 01:42:30,971
Usually do, but prices are
sky high, and I can't pass it up.

1247
01:42:36,852 --> 01:42:40,564
Look, folks, it's not like
any of 'em have a lot to live for.

1248
01:42:41,064 --> 01:42:43,024
They don't have much of a life, anyway.

1249
01:42:43,066 --> 01:42:46,570
- Phil doesn't, but we wouldn't eat him.
- That's right.

1250
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:50,532
This is our business, son.
This is not an endangered species.

1251
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:54,411
It's what these animals are bred for.

1252
01:42:54,452 --> 01:42:58,873
All that meat under cellophane in the
store, where do you think it comes from?

1253
01:42:59,207 --> 01:43:01,501
Come on, fellas.
Just relax.

1254
01:43:01,626 --> 01:43:03,670
You done real good, cowboys.

1255
01:43:03,712 --> 01:43:05,630
Let's get some grub.

1256
01:43:22,772 --> 01:43:24,816
These cows trusted us.

1257
01:43:25,567 --> 01:43:28,444
They trusted us?
They don't even know us!

1258
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:32,031
They followed us
because we yelled "Yah".

1259
01:43:32,073 --> 01:43:33,825
They're cattle.

1260
01:44:26,127 --> 01:44:27,461
What?

1261
01:45:05,541 --> 01:45:08,293
I've gotta stop bein' a schmuck.

1262
01:45:08,585 --> 01:45:10,963
You know, you were right, Mitch.

1263
01:45:11,004 --> 01:45:14,299
My life is a "do over".
It's time to get started.

1264
01:45:17,594 --> 01:45:19,471
I hope I can help.

1265
01:45:21,598 --> 01:45:23,558
I'm gonna go home...

1266
01:45:24,101 --> 01:45:26,061
...and I'm gonna get Kim pregnant.

1267
01:45:26,103 --> 01:45:29,564
- I hope I can help.
- Oh, Mitchy the Kid's in trouble.

1268
01:45:33,235 --> 01:45:35,362
- What about you?
- Hm?

1269
01:45:35,737 --> 01:45:39,074
- You gonna be OK?
- Yeah. Cos I know what he meant.

1270
01:45:39,741 --> 01:45:42,410
- Who?
- Curly. I know what this is.

1271
01:45:43,245 --> 01:45:45,705
- What?
- That's what you have to figure out.

1272
01:45:45,747 --> 01:45:48,208
- I'm gonna deck you, pal.
- No, that's what it is.

1273
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:52,045
It's different for everybody.
It's whatever's most important to you.

1274
01:45:52,087 --> 01:45:55,799
For me, when I was in the river,
I was only thinkin' about one thing.

1275
01:45:56,258 --> 01:45:58,885
All that other stuff just went away.

1276
01:45:59,261 --> 01:46:01,930
Only one thing really mattered to me.

1277
01:46:02,764 --> 01:46:05,100
- Dad!
- Daddy, you're home!

1278
01:46:09,854 --> 01:46:11,439
I love you.

1279
01:46:12,857 --> 01:46:14,818
These faces.
I missed these faces.

1280
01:46:14,859 --> 01:46:18,279
- We missed you too, Daddy.
- It's no fun without you.

1281
01:46:18,863 --> 01:46:20,615
Hey, buckaroos.

1282
01:46:22,367 --> 01:46:24,744
- Next year, the North Pole.
- What?

1283
01:46:24,786 --> 01:46:28,206
We hire dog sleds and follow
the same route as Admiral Byrd.

1284
01:46:28,248 --> 01:46:29,374
Uh-huh.

1285
01:46:29,415 --> 01:46:31,793
Next Tuesday, coffee and cake.

1286
01:46:32,835 --> 01:46:34,087
Better.

1287
01:46:34,128 --> 01:46:35,296
Come here.

1288
01:46:39,717 --> 01:46:41,844
Hey, Phil!
You need a ride?

1289
01:46:41,886 --> 01:46:43,930
No, thanks.
I got a cab.

1290
01:46:59,403 --> 01:47:02,365
- So, how are you?
- Good. Things are good.

1291
01:47:04,367 --> 01:47:06,244
Look what I found.

1292
01:47:07,703 --> 01:47:10,081
Mm, that's nice.
Where was it?

1293
01:47:10,706 --> 01:47:14,961
Colorado. I mean, it's always
the last place you look.

1294
01:47:16,796 --> 01:47:19,006
Mitch, I've been thinking.

1295
01:47:19,799 --> 01:47:22,802
If you really hate your job,
why don't you get out of there?

1296
01:47:22,843 --> 01:47:26,222
- We'll be all right.
- No. I'm not gonna quit my job.

1297
01:47:27,348 --> 01:47:31,018
I'm just gonna do it better.
I'm gonna do everything better.

1298
01:47:31,894 --> 01:47:33,479
Everything?

1299
01:47:49,787 --> 01:47:51,080
See?

1300
01:47:52,081 --> 01:47:54,917
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

1301
01:47:56,085 --> 01:47:57,586
Let's go home.

1302
01:47:57,628 --> 01:48:00,964
Today... is my best day.

1303
01:48:06,387 --> 01:48:07,971
Mr Robbins?

1304
01:48:08,847 --> 01:48:10,682
Yeah, right here.

1305
01:48:11,934 --> 01:48:13,644
This is great.

1306
01:48:15,145 --> 01:48:17,397
- There you go.
- Thanks.

1307
01:48:17,648 --> 01:48:20,609
- What, did you get a dog?
- We got a dog?!

1308
01:48:20,651 --> 01:48:23,278
- All right!
- Come on, little man.

1309
01:48:26,573 --> 01:48:28,742
Everyone, this is Norman.

1310
01:48:31,453 --> 01:48:33,538
- It's a cow.
- Uh-uh.

1311
01:48:33,914 --> 01:48:35,874
He's a calf, actually.

1312
01:48:35,916 --> 01:48:38,669
Mitch!
You're gonna put him in the van?

1313
01:48:40,253 --> 01:48:42,130
Oh, yeah.
And then the den.

1314
01:48:42,172 --> 01:48:46,259
- You're not gonna take him home.
- See, kids, he just said "Hello".

1315
01:48:47,177 --> 01:48:50,680
Just for a little while.
Then we'll put him in a petting zoo...

1316
01:48:50,722 --> 01:48:53,642
...so he can be with your mother.
- Mitch!

1317
01:48:55,185 --> 01:48:57,562
I'm kidding!
I'm just kidding.

1318
01:49:03,693 --> 01:49:06,780
- OK, seat belts, Norman. Seat belts.
- Mitch!

1319
01:49:07,197 --> 01:49:10,533
I hope you went to the bathroom.
We got a long ride.

1320
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:12,911
- Mitch!
- Let's go home.
