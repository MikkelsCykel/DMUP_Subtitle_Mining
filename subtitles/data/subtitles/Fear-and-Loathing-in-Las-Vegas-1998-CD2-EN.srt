~ To be lies ~

2
00:00:02,907 --> 00:00:05,576
~ And all the joy ~

3
00:00:05,659 --> 00:00:10,163
~ Within you dies ~

4
00:00:10,247 --> 00:00:12,999
~ Don't you want
somebody to love ~

5
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:16,627
~ Don't you need
somebody to love ~

6
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:20,214
~ Wouldn't you love
somebody to love ~

7
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:25,343
~ You better find
somebody to love ~

8
00:00:25,427 --> 00:00:27,387
~ Love ~

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,388
~

10
00:00:29,472 --> 00:00:33,767
1965.
The great San Francisco acid wave.

11
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,977
~ When the garden flowers ~

12
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:40,982
I recall one night in a place
called the Matrix. There I was--

13
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:44,485
- ~
- Mother of God. There I am.

14
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:46,487
Holy fuck.

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,865
Uh, clearly I was a victim
of the drug explosion...

16
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:54,660
a natural street freak
just eating whatever came by.

17
00:00:54,744 --> 00:00:59,707
Does anybody want some LSD ?

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,335
I got all the makin's...

19
00:01:03,418 --> 00:01:06,087
right here !

20
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:12,009
All I need is a place to cook.

21
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:18,640
I decided to eat only
half of the acid at first...

22
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:22,518
but I spilled the rest on the sleeve
of my red woolen shirt.

23
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:30,900
What's the trouble ?

24
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:33,987
Well, all this white stuff...

25
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,156
on my sleeve...

26
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,619
is LSD.

27
00:01:57,632 --> 00:01:59,342
With a bit of luck...

28
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:02,303
his life
was ruined forever...

29
00:02:02,386 --> 00:02:07,182
always thinking that just behind some
narrow door in all his favorite bars...

30
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:09,518
men in red woolen shirts...

31
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:13,521
are getting incredible kicks
from things he'll never know.

32
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:19,151
~

33
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:22,904
Strange memories on
this nervous night in Las Vegas.

34
00:02:22,988 --> 00:02:27,617
Has it been five years ? Six ?

35
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,830
It seems like a lifetime, the kind
of peak that never comes again.

36
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:35,916
~ Love is but
a song we're singin' ~

37
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:38,501
San Francisco
in the middle '60s...

38
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:42,505
was a very special time and place
to be a part of...

39
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:45,257
- but no explanation...
- ~ We can make the mountains ring ~

40
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,259
no mix of words
or music or memories...

41
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:50,804
can touch that sense of knowing
that you were there and alive...

42
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:54,849
in that corner of time in the world,
whatever it meant.

43
00:02:54,932 --> 00:02:58,644
~ Though the bird
is on the wing ~

44
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:02,314
~ And you may not
know why ~

45
00:03:04,232 --> 00:03:06,150
There was madness
in any direction...

46
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:08,528
- ~ Come on, people, now ~
- at any hour.

47
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:10,696
- ~ Smile on your brothers ~
- You could strike sparks anywhere.

48
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,157
~ Everybody get together ~

49
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,325
- ~ Try to love one another ~
- There was a fantastic
universal sense...

50
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:17,869
that whatever we were doing was right,
that we were winning.

51
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:21,330
And that, I think,
was the handle.

52
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:23,249
~ Some may come
and some may go ~

53
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:25,251
That sense
of inevitable victory...

54
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:26,877
over the forces
of old and evil.

55
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,172
Not in any mean or military sense--
we didn't need that.

56
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:34,884
Our energy
would simply prevail.

57
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:38,179
We had all the momentum.

58
00:03:38,262 --> 00:03:41,765
We were riding the crest
of a high and beautiful wave.

59
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:48,104
- So now, less than five years later...
- ~

60
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:51,774
you can go up a steep hill
in Las Vegas and look west...

61
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,484
and with the right kind
of eyes...

62
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,612
you can almost see
the high-water mark...

63
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,615
that place where the wave
finally broke...

64
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,617
and rolled back.

65
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,620
- ~ Try to love one another right now ~

66
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,498
~

67
00:04:14,585 --> 00:04:17,046
~

68
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:19,548
- ~ Want some whiskey in your water ~

69
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,759
- Room service !
- ~ Some sugar in your tea ~

70
00:04:22,843 --> 00:04:26,095
~ What's all these crazy questions
they're askin' me ~

71
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:29,056
- Good morning, sir.
- ~ This is the craziest party
there could ever be ~

72
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,101
What do you want, man ?
What do you want ?

73
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:34,102
- Room service.
- Get out.

74
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:37,105
- ~ Mama told me not to come ~
- You're in the wrong room.
Get the fuck out !

75
00:04:37,147 --> 00:04:40,108
- I've got a gun. It's not mine, really.
- ~ Mama told me not to come ~

76
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:42,109
- Uh, the-- the-- the bill.
- What ?

77
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:45,112
- Will you... s-sign for it ?
- Yeah, I'll get it. Hurry up.

78
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:47,614
Don't move, man.
Be very still.

79
00:04:47,656 --> 00:04:49,616
There we go.

80
00:04:49,658 --> 00:04:51,618
Say nothing
to no one, man.

81
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:54,829
~ Open up the window
Let some air into this room ~

82
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:59,333
The decision
to flee came suddenly. Or maybe not.

83
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:03,461
- ~ That cigarette you're smokin'
'bout scared me half to death ~
- Maybe I'd planned it all along,

84
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:05,922
subconsciously waiting
for the right moment.

85
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,841
- ~ Mama told me not to come ~
- The bill was a factor, I think...

86
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:11,719
- because I had no money to pay for it.
- ~ Mama told me not to come ~

87
00:05:11,802 --> 00:05:15,722
Our room service tabs had been
running somewhere between
29 and 36 dollars per hour...

88
00:05:15,806 --> 00:05:18,725
- ~ That ain't the way
to have fun, son ~
- for 48 consecutive hours.

89
00:05:18,808 --> 00:05:20,727
- Incredible.
- ~ That ain't the way to have fun ~

90
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,728
How could it happen ?

91
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:27,191
But by the time I asked this question,
there was no one around to answer it.

92
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:30,360
That rotten attorney of mine,
Dr. Gonzo, was gone.

93
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:32,362
He must have sensed trouble.

94
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:34,280
Hmm ? Ohh.

95
00:05:34,364 --> 00:05:36,157
A "Z" ?

96
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,325
Panic.

97
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:43,205
It crept up my spine like
first-rising vibes of an acid frenzy.

98
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:47,208
- All these horrible realities
began to dawn on me.

99
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,044
Oh, fuck.

100
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:52,046
Here I was...

101
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:55,173
alone in Las Vegas,
completely twisted on drugs.

102
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:58,551
No cash,
no story for the magazine...

103
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:04,056
and on top of everything else
I had a gigantic goddamn
hotel bill to deal with.

104
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:08,894
I didn't even know
who'd won the race.

105
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,895
- Maybe nobody.

106
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,898
How would Horatio Alger
have handled this situation ?

107
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:18,360
Stay calm.
Stay calm.

108
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,737
I'm a relatively
respectable citizen.

109
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:23,865
- Multiple felon, perhaps,
but certainly not dangerous.

110
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:26,367
- Taxi !

111
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:30,955
Luckily I had taken the soap
and grapefruit and other luggage
out to the car earlier.

112
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:32,581
Now--

113
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:34,583
it was only a matter
of slipping the noose.

114
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:38,420
Hey ! Here, take this.
All right.

115
00:06:38,503 --> 00:06:42,590
- Mr. Duke ! Mr. Duke !
- Oh, shit.

116
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:46,969
- We've been looking for you.
- The game was up. They had me.

117
00:06:47,052 --> 00:06:50,347
Many fine books have been written
in prison, huh ?

118
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,599
- Sir ?
- What ?

119
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:54,767
Um, this telegram
came for you.

120
00:06:54,851 --> 00:06:57,853
Actually, it's not for you.
It's for somebody named, uh, Thompson.

121
00:06:57,937 --> 00:07:01,315
But it says, "Care of Raoul Duke."
Do you-- Do you--

122
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:04,359
- Does that mean anything ?
- Yes, yes, it means a lot. Thanks.

123
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:07,862
- Yeah, I checked the register
for this man Thompson.

124
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:10,489
We don't show him, but I figured
he might be part of your team.

125
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:12,616
-He is. Don't worry. I'll get it to him.
-Yeah.

126
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:15,327
Um, what confused us
was, uh...

127
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:19,831
Dr. Gonzo's signature
on the telegram from Los Angeles
when we knew he was right here.

128
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,999
Right.
You did the right thing.

129
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,419
Never try to understand a press message.
About half the time, we use codes.

130
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:27,796
Especially with Dr. Gonzo.
See ya.

131
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:31,716
- Um, tell me.

132
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,343
When will the doctor
be awake ?

133
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:38,430
- Awake ? What do you mean ?
- Well, um...

134
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:42,184
my manager, Mr. Heem,
would like to meet him.

135
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:44,728
It's nothing unusual, um--

136
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:48,856
Mr. Heem likes to meet
all of our large accounts...

137
00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:51,192
put'em on a personal basis,
you know ?

138
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,444
Just a chat and a handshake.
You understand.

139
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:55,445
Of course,
but if I were you...

140
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:57,947
I would leave the doctor alone
until after he's eaten his breakfast...

141
00:07:57,989 --> 00:07:59,908
because he's
a very crude man.

142
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:02,451
Jesus God !

143
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:05,037
- No !

144
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:09,875
But he will be available,
huh, maybe later this morning ?

145
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,961
Look, the telegram
is actually all scrambled.

146
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:17,006
It's actually from Thompson,
not to him.

147
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:20,717
All right ? Now, I've got to go.
I've gotta get to the race.

148
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,553
- B-But there's no hurry.
The race is over.
- Not for me.

149
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:26,764
Well, um--
Let's have lunch !

150
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:29,350
Righty-o, man.
Righty-o.

151
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:35,147
- ~ Now, the bricks
lay on Grand Street ~
- Jesus.

152
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:40,151
Bad waves of paranoia.
Madness. Fear and loathing.

153
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:43,154
Intolerable vibrations
in this place. Get out.

154
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:45,155
The weasels were closing in.

155
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:47,449
I could smell the ugly brutes.

156
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:49,451
Do me one last favor, Lord.

157
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:53,079
Just give me five more high-speed hours
before You bring the hammer down.

158
00:08:53,162 --> 00:08:58,292
Just let me get rid of this goddamn car
and off this horrible desert.

159
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:02,254
~ Oh, Mama ~

160
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:05,673
~ Is this really the end ~

161
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:08,426
- ~ To be stuck inside of Mobile ~
- Oh, you evil bastard.

162
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:11,095
- ~ With the Memphis blues again ~
- This is Your work.
You better take care of me, Lord.

163
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:13,972
- If You don't, You're
gonna have me on Your hands.

164
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:26,191
- Pull over ! Pull over !
- Hey !

165
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,818
Good morning. How are you ?
All right, man. Doing very well.

166
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,657
Few people understand the psychology
of dealing with a highway traffic cop.

167
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:39,286
Your normal speeder will panic
and immediately pull over to the side.

168
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,330
This is wrong.
It arouses contempt in the cop heart.

169
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:47,210
Make the bastard chase you.
He will follow.

170
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:51,005
But he won't know what to make
of your blinker signal that says
you're about to turn right.

171
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:55,842
This is to let him know you're
pulling off for a proper place to talk.

172
00:09:55,926 --> 00:09:58,178
It'll take him a moment
to realize he's about to make
a 180-degree turn, at speed.

173
00:09:58,178 --> 00:10:00,513
It'll take him a moment
to realize he's about to make
a 180-degree turn, at speed.

174
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:02,807
But you will be ready.
Brace for the "G"s.

175
00:10:02,848 --> 00:10:04,975
Fast heel-toe work.

176
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:20,405
Hi. How are you ?

177
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:25,535
Just what in the hell
did you think you were doing ?

178
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:28,996
I wanna know.
Let me see your license.

179
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,166
Oh, yeah, of course.
There you are.

180
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:37,212
Oh, my gosh.

181
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,009
It's me.

182
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:46,011
May I please have that ?

183
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,223
I knew I was fucked.

184
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:59,690
See you have two cases of beer,
a basket of grapefruit...

185
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:02,150
stack of T-shirts and towels,
light bulbs.

186
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:07,613
- You realize what you did
when you drive like that ?
- Yeah, I know. I'm guilty.

187
00:11:07,697 --> 00:11:11,200
I understand that. I knew it
was a crime. I did it anyway.

188
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:14,286
Shit, why argue ?
I'm a fucking criminal. Look at me.

189
00:11:14,328 --> 00:11:16,872
You have
a strange attitude.

190
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:18,957
Maybe.

191
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,544
You know, I have a feeling
you need to take a nap.

192
00:11:23,627 --> 00:11:25,921
There's a rest area
just up ahead.

193
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:29,216
I'd like you to go up there,
pull over and get a few hours' sleep.

194
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:31,301
That's not gonna help me.

195
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:34,595
I've been awake for too long.
Three or four nights, maybe.
Can't even remember.

196
00:11:34,637 --> 00:11:37,389
I go to sleep now,
I'm dead for 20 hours.

197
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:41,768
What are you carrying
two cases of soap for, son ?

198
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:44,312
I wanna stay clean.

199
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:46,314
No.

200
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,400
Here's how it is.

201
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:52,361
What I put in my book,
as of noon...

202
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:55,697
is that I apprehended you
for driving too fast.

203
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,033
- I advised you to proceed
to the next rest area.
- ~

204
00:11:59,117 --> 00:12:01,035
Stop !

205
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:07,124
I advised you to proceed
to the next rest area--

206
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:10,210
your stated destination, right ?

207
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:14,380
And take a long nap.

208
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,008
Do I make myself clear ?

209
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:21,094
Well...
how far is Baker ?

210
00:12:21,178 --> 00:12:24,556
I was sort of hoping to,
I don't know, stop there for lunch.

211
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:27,975
It's not my jurisdiction.

212
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:31,562
City limits end 2.2 miles
beyond the rest area.

213
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:33,605
Can you make it that far ?

214
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:35,857
I'll try.

215
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:40,194
I've been wanting to go to Baker for
a long time. Yeah. Heard a lot about it.

216
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,948
Excellent seafood.

217
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:49,036
You know, I'm thinkin',
a guy with your kind of mind...

218
00:12:49,077 --> 00:12:51,955
ought to try
the land-crab.

219
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:55,416
- Excellent seafood.
- Land-crab.

220
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,836
All right. Why not ?

221
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:01,213
Thanks for the tip.

222
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:03,381
Look at me in the eyes.

223
00:13:06,676 --> 00:13:08,594
Everything all right ?

224
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:15,642
May I have a little kiss
before you go ?

225
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:19,312
I'm very lonely here.

226
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:22,857
~ Oh, Mama ~

227
00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:25,734
~ Can this really
be the end ~

228
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:29,654
I felt raped.
The pig had done me on all fronts.

229
00:13:29,738 --> 00:13:32,907
And now he was going off to chuckle
about it on the west side of town...

230
00:13:32,991 --> 00:13:35,451
waiting for me
to make a run for L.A.

231
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:39,747
Why, yes, Officer. Of course
I'll take advantage of that rest area.

232
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:44,417
And I can't tell you how grateful
I am for this break you wanna give me.

233
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:47,420
Get a grip, man.

234
00:13:47,503 --> 00:13:51,048
If I boom straight for L.A.,
he'll bust me for sure.

235
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:54,718
No. This was not the time
for a showdown.

236
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,097
This was Death Valley.

237
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:04,059
Oh, fuck !

238
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,520
Sweet Jesus, it's him.

239
00:14:06,603 --> 00:14:09,022
Oh, my God !

240
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:12,108
~

241
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:17,780
Shit !
Come on, you fucking bastard.

242
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:21,074
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
I've got to go. I've got to--

243
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:23,618
~

244
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:25,995
Well, they've nailed me,
goddamn it.

245
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:28,498
I'm trapped in some stinking
desert crossroads called Baker.

246
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:31,333
I don't have much time, man.
The fuckers are closing in.

247
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,586
- They'll hunt me down
like a fucking beast.
- You sound paranoid.

248
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,755
I need a fucking lawyer
immediately !

249
00:14:36,838 --> 00:14:39,591
What are you doing in Baker ?
Didn't you get my telegram ?

250
00:14:39,674 --> 00:14:44,178
What telegram, you worthless bastard ?
I'll cripple your ass for this.

251
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,431
You brainless scumbag,
you're supposed to be in Vegas.

252
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:49,683
I rented a suite
at the Flamingo.

253
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:54,103
You're supposed to be covering the
National District Attorney's conference.

254
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:58,357
- I made all the reservations.
Everything is arranged.

255
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,860
Now, what the fuck are you doing out
there in the middle of the desert ?

256
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:05,196
Nothing. Never mind.
It's all a big joke.

257
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,741
I'm actually, uh-- I'm poolside
at the Flamingo right now...

258
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,744
talking through a portable phone some
dwarf brought out from the casino.

259
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:15,080
Yeah, I have total credit here.
Don't come anywhere
near this place, you bastard.

260
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:17,082
Foreigners
aren't welcome here.

261
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:23,129
Well, this is how
the world works.

262
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:27,549
All energy flows according
to the whims of the Great Magnet.

263
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:30,302
What a fool I was
to defy him.

264
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:33,596
I was going back to Vegas.
I had no choice.

265
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:38,892
I had to get rid
of the Shark.

266
00:15:38,976 --> 00:15:43,230
Too many people might recognize it,
especially the Vegas police.

267
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:48,401
Luckily, my credit card
was still technically valid.

268
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:51,695
Now this
was a superior machine.

269
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:55,699
Ten grand worth of gimmicks
and high-priced special effects.

270
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:59,202
The rear windows leapt up with a touch
like frogs in a dynamite pond.

271
00:15:59,285 --> 00:16:02,705
The dashboard was full of esoteric
lights and dials and meters...

272
00:16:02,788 --> 00:16:05,165
that I would never understand.

273
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:07,918
If the pigs
were gathering in Vegas...

274
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,588
I felt the drug culture
should be represented as well.

275
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:14,632
And there was a certain bent appeal in
the notion of running a savage burn...

276
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,634
on one Las Vegas hotel...

277
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:19,970
and then just wheeling across town
and checking into another.

278
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,306
Me and a thousand ranking cops
from all over America.

279
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:26,476
Why not move confidently
into their midst ?

280
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:30,062
- Welcome to the Flamingo Hotel, sir.

281
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:32,523
- Sir ?

282
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:34,524
Yeah, hi. Right. Okay.

283
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:37,110
~ Let me stay in your arms ~

284
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:39,696
~ I'm addicted to your charms ~

285
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:43,657
~ You're gettin' to be
a habit with me ~

286
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:48,203
~ I used to think your love
was something that I ~

287
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:50,580
~ Could take ~

288
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:53,541
- ~ Or leave alone ~
- My arrival was badly timed.

289
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:57,461
~ But now I couldn't do
without my supply ~

290
00:16:57,545 --> 00:17:00,380
~ I need you for my own ~

291
00:17:00,464 --> 00:17:03,717
~

292
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:09,847
This here model
is one that we had to use...

293
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:13,392
when we took on them little peckerheads
down there at Kent State.

294
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:16,019
This baby here--

295
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:20,857
I'm a police chief
from Michigan.

296
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:23,025
Look, fella, I have
explained to you.

297
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:28,363
I have this postcard which says that
I have a reservation in this hotel.

298
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:32,200
I'm very sorry, sir,
but you're on the late list.

299
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:36,620
- So your reservation
has been transferred to...
- It's okay.

300
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:40,457
the... Moonlight Motel...

301
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,084
which is just out
on Paradise Boulevard.

302
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:46,254
We've already paid
for our goddamn room !

303
00:17:46,337 --> 00:17:49,423
It's actually a very fine
place of lodging, and it's
only 16 blocks from here.

304
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:51,509
It has a pool,
sauna, steam.

305
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:53,969
You listen to me,
you filthy little faggot !

306
00:17:54,052 --> 00:17:56,471
I want a manager down here,
now, now !

307
00:17:56,513 --> 00:17:59,599
Because I'm sick of listening
to your dog shit !

308
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:02,768
- I am... very sorry, sir.

309
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,771
- Get off of me ! Get away from me !
- Can I call you a cab ?

310
00:18:05,854 --> 00:18:07,940
Sure, and I'll call you
a cocksucker !

311
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:10,859
Of course, I could hear what
the clerk was really saying.

312
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:13,987
Listen, you fuzzy
little shithead !

313
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,323
I've been fucked around
in my time...

314
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:20,325
by a fairly good
cross section...

315
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,702
of mean-tempered,
rule-crazy cops...

316
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:25,997
and now...
it's my turn.

317
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:32,044
So fuck you, Officer.
I'm in charge.

318
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:36,715
Hey, listen, I really hate
to interrupt, but I wonder
if I could slide on through.

319
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:39,509
The name is Raoul Duke. I think
my attorney made the reservations.

320
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,886
Duke, Raoul.

321
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:44,054
- Certainly, sir.

322
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:48,141
My bags-- My bags are out there in
that white Cadillac convertible there.

323
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:50,060
Maybe somebody could
bring it to the room for me.

324
00:18:50,143 --> 00:18:54,564
Oh, yeah, uh, let me get
a quart of Wild Turkey...

325
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:56,691
- two-fifths of Bacardi...

326
00:18:56,732 --> 00:18:59,485
- some ice for the room, and let's see--
- You just calm down !

327
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:01,737
Shit, let's try some lime chunks.
What do you think ?

328
00:19:01,778 --> 00:19:04,239
I say okay.

329
00:19:04,322 --> 00:19:07,575
- You don't worry about a thing.
- Now, calm down.

330
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:10,911
You don't hesitate
to call me-- Sven.

331
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:12,913
All right, Sven.

332
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:15,916
- Thank you very much.

333
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:18,918
- You-- You--
- I know, I know, I know.

334
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,630
It's hideous. You're gonna
be fine, though. You're doing well.

335
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:24,632
I'll see you later.
Wait. Don't touch it.

336
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:27,801
- Good night. Pardon me. Bye, Sven.

337
00:19:27,885 --> 00:19:32,597
- Look what you did !
Look what you did !

338
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:36,350
Goddamn you, we wouldn't stay
in this hotel if you begged us !

339
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:40,604
~ Magic moments ~

340
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:45,275
~ When two hearts are caring ~

341
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:49,945
- ~ Magic moments ~

342
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:55,075
- ~ Memories we've been sharing ~
- Home, sweet home.

343
00:19:55,117 --> 00:19:57,202
- Whoa. What kind of sick shit--

344
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:59,662
Oh, shit !

345
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:01,664
- Shit. What the fuck ?

346
00:20:01,706 --> 00:20:03,666
Stop, stop, stop.

347
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:07,878
Ow ! She's biting my leg off !
You degenerate pig. Please !

348
00:20:07,961 --> 00:20:09,629
- Can't be helped.

349
00:20:09,713 --> 00:20:14,092
-My fucking leg !
-That's "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."

350
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:17,219
Lucy, be cool,
goddamn it.

351
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:20,848
Remember what happened
at the airport, okay ? Come on.

352
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:27,979
No more of that, okay ?
That's my client, Lucy.

353
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,982
That's Mr. Duke,
the famous journalist.

354
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:34,693
He's paying for this suite, Lucy.

355
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,695
He's on our side.

356
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,572
He loves artists.

357
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:43,617
Lucy paints portraits
of Barbra Streisand.

358
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,037
Yeah. Right ?

359
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:50,290
Um, I drew these from TV.

360
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:52,500
Really.

361
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,962
She came
all the way down--

362
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:58,631
- What's the name of that town ?
- Montana.

363
00:20:58,714 --> 00:21:02,426
Montana. Just to give
these portraits to Barbra.

364
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,764
We're goin' over to the Americana
tonight to meet her backstage.

365
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:10,850
I desperately needed peace, rest...

366
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:13,310
sanctuary.

367
00:21:13,393 --> 00:21:15,520
I hadn't counted on this:

368
00:21:15,604 --> 00:21:19,566
finding my attorney on acid
and locked into some kind
of preternatural courtship.

369
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:21,818
Well...

370
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:26,113
they must have, uh,
brought the car around by now.

371
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:28,073
So...

372
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:30,867
why don't, uh...

373
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:35,037
ou-yay and... I-ay...

374
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:38,457
o-gay and, uh,
et-gay the...

375
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:40,417
uff-stay...

376
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:43,128
out of the unk-tray.

377
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,635
Absolutely. Yeah.

378
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:54,221
Let's get the stuff.

379
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,973
We'll be right back, Lucy.

380
00:21:57,057 --> 00:21:59,350
- Give me a kiss ? One kiss, one kiss.
- No.

381
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:02,770
- No. No.
- One kiss. Why not ?

382
00:22:02,812 --> 00:22:04,772
Okay.

383
00:22:10,318 --> 00:22:12,987
Don't answer the phone.

384
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:21,662
God bless.

385
00:22:23,747 --> 00:22:26,833
Well, what are your plans ?

386
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,126
Plans ?

387
00:22:29,168 --> 00:22:32,629
- The child in the bedroom.
- Oh, Lucy.

388
00:22:32,713 --> 00:22:34,673
I met her on the plane.

389
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:40,845
Yeah.
She's a religious freak.

390
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:43,806
I gave her a cap
before I realized--

391
00:22:43,848 --> 00:22:46,600
Jesus, she's never
even had a drink.

392
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:48,852
Well, it'll probably work out.

393
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:52,147
We can keep her loaded, and then
peddle her ass at the drug convention.

394
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,024
Yeah, she's perfect
for this gig.

395
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:59,194
These cops'll go 50 bucks a head
to beat her into submission
and then gang-fuck her.

396
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:01,655
We can set her up in one
of these backstreet motels...

397
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:06,075
hang pictures of Jesus
all over the room, and then turn
these fucking pigs loose on her.

398
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:09,161
Hell, she's strong, man.
She'll hold her own.

399
00:23:10,413 --> 00:23:12,831
Jesus Christ,
I knew you were sick...

400
00:23:12,915 --> 00:23:16,710
but I never expected to hear
you actually say that kind of stuff.

401
00:23:16,793 --> 00:23:21,047
- You filthy bastard.
- Straight economics, man.
This girl's a godsend.

402
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:24,008
Shit. She could
make us a grand a day.

403
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:27,219
That's ugly, man.
Stop talking like that.

404
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:30,680
Well, I figure she can do
about four at a time.

405
00:23:30,764 --> 00:23:34,934
If we keep her full of acid, that's
more like two grand a day, maybe three.

406
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,938
Hold on, man.

407
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:42,941
What if I just jump on you
and beat the dog shit out of you ?

408
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:45,777
Would that make you feel any better,
you filthy bastard ?

409
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,779
All right,
listen to me.

410
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:50,698
In a few hours, she'll probably
be sane enough to work herself...

411
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:54,618
into some sort of towering Jesus-based
rage at the hazy recollection...

412
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:57,954
of being seduced by
some kind of cruel Samoan...

413
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:01,958
who fed her liquor and LSD,
dragged her to a Vegas hotel room...

414
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,628
and then savagely penetrated
every orifice in her little body...

415
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:08,797
with his throbbing,
uncircumcised member.

416
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,257
- That's so ugly, man.

417
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:13,384
- Well, truth hurts.
- That's-- Argh !

418
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,803
- Yeah.
- Argh ! That's argh !

419
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,805
- Argh !
- Argh ?

420
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:19,807
- Argh !
- Argh.

421
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,018
I wanted to help her, man.

422
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:27,855
Well, you'll go straight
to the gas chamber for this one.

423
00:24:27,897 --> 00:24:30,649
Even if you manage to beat that,
they'll still send you back to Nevada...

424
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:33,318
for rape
and consensual sodomy.

425
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:36,113
No, she's gotta go.

426
00:24:36,196 --> 00:24:38,615
Shit.

427
00:24:38,698 --> 00:24:42,118
It doesn't pay to try to
help somebody these days, huh ?

428
00:24:47,414 --> 00:24:49,416
Let's go.

429
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:52,752
Yeah. Americana Hotel ?
I need a reservation.

430
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:55,463
For my... niece.

431
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:58,632
Look, I want her treated very gently.
She's an artist and--

432
00:24:58,716 --> 00:25:02,302
Fuck off. She might seem
a trifle high-strung.

433
00:25:02,386 --> 00:25:05,305
She's doing her masters thesis
on, uh...

434
00:25:05,388 --> 00:25:07,307
well, Barbra Streisand.

435
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,309
- It's time to meet Barbra.
- Last name ?

436
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:15,063
I'd rather not say. My brother's
in politics. Yeah, you understand.

437
00:25:15,105 --> 00:25:18,191
I felt like a Nazi,
but it had to be done.

438
00:25:18,274 --> 00:25:21,652
- Yeah, yeah, righto. Okay, yeah. Bye.

439
00:25:28,492 --> 00:25:31,578
~ Yummy, yummy, yummy
I've got love in my tummy ~

440
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:35,665
- ~ And I feel like loving you ~

441
00:25:35,748 --> 00:25:38,876
~ Love is such a sweet thing
Good enough to eat ~

442
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:41,586
~ And it's just
what I'm gonna do ~

443
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:44,464
Lucy was a potentially fatal
millstone on both our necks.

444
00:25:44,506 --> 00:25:47,467
- Hurry the fuck up !
- There was absolutely no choice...

445
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:49,635
- but to cut her adrift...
- Jesus Christ. Take your time !

446
00:25:49,677 --> 00:25:51,637
and hope her memory
was fucked.

447
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,973
Here's an extra ten bucks.
Make sure she gets there safely.

448
00:25:55,057 --> 00:25:57,517
~

449
00:25:59,018 --> 00:26:03,439
- That's that.

450
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:06,608
Hey, man, take off slowly.
Don't attract attention.

451
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:12,155
- ~ Yummy, yummy, yummy
I've got love in my tummy ~
- ~

452
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:15,658
Let's find a good seafood restaurant
and eat some red salmon.

453
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,495
I feel a powerful lust
for red salmon.

454
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:32,840
- Oh, no, man. We're gonna be late.

455
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:35,926
- We gotta go.

456
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:37,927
Goddamn mescaline.

457
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:43,974
Why the fuck can't they
make it a little less pure ?

458
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:45,976
I welcome you...

459
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:50,021
to the third National
D.A.'s Convention...

460
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:53,608
on Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs.

461
00:26:53,691 --> 00:26:56,193
And now,
without further ado...

462
00:26:56,277 --> 00:27:00,614
the man who will define this cancer
eating at the heart of America...

463
00:27:00,697 --> 00:27:03,116
Dr. L. Ron Bumquist.

464
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:14,084
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider,
but I didn't believe they were real.

465
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:17,212
Not like this, man,
not hundreds of them.

466
00:27:17,295 --> 00:27:20,048
They're actually pretty nice people
once you get to know them.

467
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:22,883
Know them ? I know these people
in my goddamn blood.

468
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:25,552
Don't say that word around here.
You'll get them excited.

469
00:27:25,636 --> 00:27:28,096
- You're right.
- The most efficient way
for us to do this...

470
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,682
is for each one of us...

471
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:33,643
to try and attempt...

472
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,937
to imagine
what it is like inside...

473
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:41,066
- of the possessed mind of the addict.
- Hmm ?

474
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:43,068
For example...

475
00:27:43,151 --> 00:27:45,570
a dope fiend...

476
00:27:45,653 --> 00:27:49,073
refers to the reefer butt...

477
00:27:49,156 --> 00:27:51,158
as a "roach"...

478
00:27:51,242 --> 00:27:53,327
because...

479
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,454
it resembles a cockroach.

480
00:27:56,913 --> 00:27:58,957
What the fuck are these people
talking about ?

481
00:27:58,998 --> 00:28:02,918
You've got to be crazy on acid to think
a joint looks like a goddamn cockroach.

482
00:28:03,002 --> 00:28:06,588
You will notice
that I have distinguished...

483
00:28:06,672 --> 00:28:11,593
four-- four distinct
states of being...

484
00:28:11,676 --> 00:28:14,762
in the cannabis
or marijuana society.

485
00:28:14,846 --> 00:28:18,432
They are cool, groovy...

486
00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:20,767
hip and square.

487
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:22,769
Seldom, if ever--

488
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:26,272
- Too crazy, man. Too crazy.

489
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:29,025
We should get the hell out.
What a fucking nightmare.

490
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:32,027
If he figures out
what is happening...

491
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:34,613
then he can rise
one notch...

492
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:36,781
and become hip.

493
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:41,077
And then if he can
convince himself...

494
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,830
to approve
of what is happening...

495
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:48,667
then he becomes groovy.

496
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,669
Groovy.

497
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:55,965
And then, after that,
he can actually raise himself...

498
00:28:56,048 --> 00:28:58,717
to the rank of cool.

499
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:02,012
He can become one
of those...

500
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:04,014
cool guys.

501
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:06,140
Dr. Bumquist.

502
00:29:06,224 --> 00:29:11,187
You think the anthropologist Margaret
Mead's strange behavior of late...

503
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,981
could be explained
by a private marijuana addiction ?

504
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:15,982
Good question.

505
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:20,069
- I'm not really sure I can answer that.

506
00:29:20,153 --> 00:29:23,364
But what I can tell you, sir,
is if Margaret Mead...

507
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:25,908
at her age...

508
00:29:25,991 --> 00:29:29,161
smoked grass...

509
00:29:29,244 --> 00:29:31,371
she'd have one hell
of a trip.

510
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:39,211
One more layer of deviance
to the woman.

511
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:41,755
This is fuckin' bullshit.

512
00:29:41,838 --> 00:29:44,215
I'll be out
in the casino.

513
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,178
Shut up, man.
Go to hell !

514
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:52,431
Thank you very much. Thank you.

515
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:55,309
- Thank you. Thank you for having me.
- Projector, please.

516
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:58,103
- Excuse me.
- All right.

517
00:29:58,186 --> 00:30:00,104
~

518
00:30:00,188 --> 00:30:03,566
~

519
00:30:03,607 --> 00:30:05,818
Know your dope fiend.

520
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:08,278
Your life may depend on it.

521
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:12,115
You will not be able to see his eyes,
because of Tea-Shades...

522
00:30:12,198 --> 00:30:15,576
but his knuckles will be white
from inner tension.

523
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:17,995
And his pants will be
crusted with semen...

524
00:30:18,078 --> 00:30:22,374
from constantly jacking off
when he can't find a rape victim.

525
00:30:22,457 --> 00:30:25,126
He will stagger and babble
when questioned.

526
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,087
- He will not respect your badge.

527
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:30,506
The dope fiend fears nothing.

528
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:34,343
He will attack for no reason,
with any weapon at his command...

529
00:30:34,426 --> 00:30:37,554
- including yours.
- Excuse me.

530
00:30:37,637 --> 00:30:42,600
- Beware: any officer apprehending
a suspected marijuana addict...
- Pardon me.

531
00:30:42,683 --> 00:30:46,437
- should use all
necessary force immediately.
- Sorry. Pardon me.

532
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:51,149
One stitch in time on him
will usually save nine...

533
00:30:51,524 --> 00:30:53,151
on you--

534
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:56,862
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

535
00:30:56,946 --> 00:30:59,865
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

536
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:06,871
Yeah ?

537
00:31:06,913 --> 00:31:10,374
Yes, Mr. Duke, hello.
You have one message.

538
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:12,376
- Call Lucy...

539
00:31:12,418 --> 00:31:15,587
- at the Americana Hotel, room 1600.
- Oh, fuck.

540
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,088
- Hello ?

541
00:31:17,172 --> 00:31:19,549
- Lucy called.

542
00:31:19,632 --> 00:31:22,051
- What ?

543
00:31:22,134 --> 00:31:24,762
- Lucy called.
- What ?

544
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:27,598
- Lucy called, man.

545
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:43,028
Those two men in the dock,
they gave me the LSD.

546
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:45,071
They took me
to the hotel.

547
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:48,074
I don't know what they
done to me, but I remember...

548
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,076
it was horrible.

549
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,745
- They gave you what ?

550
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,746
LSD.

551
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,916
Castration !

552
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,793
Double castration !

553
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:05,881
- Where's my .357 ?
- Who the fuck knows, man ?

554
00:32:05,964 --> 00:32:09,718
- You can't leave me alone
in this snake pit.

555
00:32:09,801 --> 00:32:13,012
You bastard, what did you do
with my .357 ?

556
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:18,559
- This room is in my name.
- Well, tough titty.

557
00:32:18,642 --> 00:32:21,228
Okay, goddamn it !

558
00:32:22,396 --> 00:32:24,314
You're right.

559
00:32:24,397 --> 00:32:27,817
She's my problem. I'll call her,
I'll get her off our backs.

560
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:31,570
- It's gone too fucking far.
- No, I'll take care of the situation.

561
00:32:31,654 --> 00:32:33,572
- Relax.
- Relax !

562
00:32:33,655 --> 00:32:35,824
Let me handle this.

563
00:32:38,827 --> 00:32:40,828
- Where are my shoes ?
- The Americana Hotel.

564
00:32:40,912 --> 00:32:43,414
-What did you do with my goddamn shoes ?
-Room 1600, please.

565
00:32:43,497 --> 00:32:47,668
As your attorney, I advise you to take a
hit out of the little brown bottle...

566
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:50,253
in my shaving kit.

567
00:32:50,337 --> 00:32:52,839
You won't need much.

568
00:32:53,923 --> 00:32:55,925
Just a... tiny taste.

569
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:59,345
Let's have it.
Ah, there it is.

570
00:33:03,723 --> 00:33:05,642
- What is this shit ?
- That stuff...

571
00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:10,354
makes pure mescaline
seem like ginger beer, man.

572
00:33:12,106 --> 00:33:15,650
- Adrenochrome.
- Adrenochrome ? Hmm.

573
00:33:23,616 --> 00:33:26,368
Hello.

574
00:33:26,452 --> 00:33:30,038
- Hi, Lucy. God bless.
- Hmm ?

575
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:32,082
Yeah, it's me.

576
00:33:32,165 --> 00:33:36,085
Hell, no, I taught the bastard
a lesson he'll never forget.

577
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:39,380
What ? No, not dead.

578
00:33:39,421 --> 00:33:42,674
But he won't be bothering
anybody for a while.

579
00:33:42,758 --> 00:33:45,051
Yeah, I left him out there.

580
00:33:45,135 --> 00:33:48,846
I stomped him.
I pulled all his teeth out.

581
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,848
I remember thinking, Jesus...

582
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:53,517
what a terrible thing to lay
on somebody with a head full of acid.

583
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,519
But we have a problem.

584
00:33:55,602 --> 00:33:59,898
That bastard cashed a bad check
downstairs and gave you as a reference.

585
00:33:59,939 --> 00:34:02,817
They'll be looking
for both of you.

586
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:06,945
Yeah, I know, Lucy, but you
can't judge a book by its cover.

587
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:09,823
Some people are
just basically rotten.

588
00:34:11,574 --> 00:34:16,329
Anyway, the last thing in the world
you wanna do is call this hotel again.

589
00:34:16,412 --> 00:34:20,624
- They'll trace the call,
put you behind bars.

590
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:23,710
No, I'm moving
to the Tropicana right away.

591
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:27,213
Hmm.

592
00:34:27,296 --> 00:34:30,674
I'll use a different name.
I'll let you know what it is.

593
00:34:34,595 --> 00:34:37,013
I gotta get off.

594
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:40,016
Probably have
this phone tapped, baby.

595
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:44,103
- Yeah, it was horrible,
but it's all over now.

596
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:47,147
Oh, my God.
There's someone at the door.

597
00:34:47,231 --> 00:34:51,192
- There's someone at the door.

598
00:34:51,276 --> 00:34:54,654
Christ ! Hey !

599
00:34:54,737 --> 00:34:57,573
No ! I'm innocent !
It was Duke !

600
00:34:57,656 --> 00:35:01,076
It was Duke !
Lucy ! Lucy !

601
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:03,161
I love you ! I love you !

602
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:13,879
Don't put that thing on me.
Aaaah ! Aaaah !

603
00:35:17,924 --> 00:35:21,385
Whoo. Oh.

604
00:35:21,427 --> 00:35:24,597
Well--

605
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,057
That's that.

606
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:31,728
- That's the last we should
be hearing from Lucy, man.

607
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,943
She's probably stuffing herself
down the incinerator about now.

608
00:35:42,029 --> 00:35:44,072
You know what we need ?

609
00:35:44,114 --> 00:35:46,574
We need some opium.

610
00:35:57,584 --> 00:35:59,669
I remember
slumping on the bed.

611
00:35:59,752 --> 00:36:02,171
His performance
had given me a bad jolt.

612
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:05,007
For a moment,
I thought his mind had snapped...

613
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,051
that he actually believed he was being
attacked by invisible enemies.

614
00:36:08,135 --> 00:36:11,638
But the room was quiet again.

615
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:14,807
Where'd you get this ?

616
00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:18,185
Never mind.
It's absolutely pure.

617
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:21,188
What kind of monster client
have you hooked up with this time ?

618
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:23,190
Satanism freak.

619
00:36:23,273 --> 00:36:26,192
I think there's only
one source for this stuff--

620
00:36:26,276 --> 00:36:29,153
the, uh, adrenaline gland...

621
00:36:29,195 --> 00:36:32,489
from a living human body.

622
00:36:32,531 --> 00:36:37,035
- I know. The guy didn't
have any cash to pay me.
- ~

623
00:36:37,118 --> 00:36:40,997
He offered me human blood,
said it would take me higher
than I'd ever been in my life.

624
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:43,541
- I thought he was kidding...
- Oh.

625
00:36:43,624 --> 00:36:48,545
so I told him I'd just as soon have
an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome...

626
00:36:48,628 --> 00:36:51,423
or maybe just a fresh
adrenaline gland...

627
00:36:51,506 --> 00:36:53,424
to chew on.

628
00:36:53,508 --> 00:36:56,385
I could already feel
the stuff working on me.

629
00:36:56,427 --> 00:37:00,639
The first wave felt like a combination
of mescaline and methedrine.

630
00:37:00,722 --> 00:37:03,225
Maybe I should take a swim,
I thought.

631
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:05,226
Yes, sir.

632
00:37:07,228 --> 00:37:10,981
They nailed this guy
for child molesting.

633
00:37:12,483 --> 00:37:14,484
He swore he didn't do it.

634
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:18,446
"Why should I fuck with children ?"
he said. "They're too small."

635
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:20,907
- Christ, what could I say ?

636
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:25,244
Even a goddamn werewolf
is entitled to legal counsel.

637
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:28,413
I didn't dare
to turn the creep down.

638
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:34,210
He might have picked up a letter opener
and gone after my...

639
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,879
pineal gland.

640
00:37:36,962 --> 00:37:38,922
- You know ?
- Yeah.

641
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,466
- Crazy.
- Why not ?

642
00:37:41,508 --> 00:37:44,803
Shit. We should
get some of that.

643
00:37:44,886 --> 00:37:48,264
Just... eat a big handful
and see what happens.

644
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:51,142
Some of what ?

645
00:37:54,686 --> 00:37:56,646
Extract of pineal.

646
00:37:56,688 --> 00:37:59,524
Sure, that's a good idea.

647
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:03,736
One whiff of that stuff will turn you
into something out of a goddamn...

648
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:07,864
medical encyclopedia, man.

649
00:38:09,908 --> 00:38:12,327
Beautiful
fucking tits.

650
00:38:12,368 --> 00:38:15,830
Man, your head would
swell up like a watermelon.

651
00:38:15,913 --> 00:38:20,042
- You'd gain about
a hundred pounds in two hours.
- Right !

652
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:22,544
Grow claws,
bleeding warts.

653
00:38:22,627 --> 00:38:24,254
Yes.

654
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:28,424
And then you'd notice
about six huge, hairy tits...

655
00:38:28,508 --> 00:38:30,551
swelling up on your back.

656
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:32,428
Fantastic !

657
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:34,596
You'd go blind.

658
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:38,850
Your body would turn to wax.

659
00:38:38,892 --> 00:38:40,977
They'd have to put you
in a wheelbarrow.

660
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,020
And when you scream for help...

661
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:45,939
you'll sound
like a raccoon.

662
00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:50,944
Man, I'll try
just about anything...

663
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:54,197
but I'd never in hell
touch a pineal gland.

664
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,116
Finish the fucking story, man !

665
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,452
What happened ?
What about the glands ?

666
00:39:00,536 --> 00:39:03,997
Jesus, that stuff got right
on top of you, didn't it ?

667
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,959
Look at your face.
You're about to explode.

668
00:39:15,257 --> 00:39:17,801
Maybe you could just...

669
00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:21,054
shove me into the pool.

670
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:25,891
Man, if I put you in the pool right now,
you'll sink like a goddamn stone.

671
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:30,645
You took too much, man.
You took too much. Too much.

672
00:39:33,022 --> 00:39:34,941
Don't try and fight it.

673
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:37,818
You'll get brain bubbles,
strokes, aneurysms.

674
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:41,905
You'll just wither up
and die.

675
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:46,492
- They continue
killing innocent people !

676
00:39:46,576 --> 00:39:50,329
Allowing the hopes for peace and
freedom of millions of people...

677
00:39:50,413 --> 00:39:52,623
to be suffocated.

678
00:39:52,706 --> 00:39:55,751
So tonight, we do.

679
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:58,253
The great silent majority.

680
00:39:58,336 --> 00:40:00,254
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.

681
00:40:00,338 --> 00:40:03,132
Sacrifice.
Sacrifice. Sacrifice. Sacrifice.

682
00:40:03,215 --> 00:40:07,302
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.

683
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:13,641
~

684
00:40:13,683 --> 00:40:19,355
~ I feel the cottonwood
whispering above ~

685
00:40:19,438 --> 00:40:23,233
~ Tammy, Tammy ~

686
00:40:23,316 --> 00:40:26,069
- ~ Tammy's in love ~

687
00:40:26,152 --> 00:40:28,071
~

688
00:40:28,154 --> 00:40:31,949
What kind of rat-bastard
psychotic would play that song
right now, at this moment ?

689
00:40:33,784 --> 00:40:36,953
~ Tammy, Tammy ~

690
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:38,997
When I came to...

691
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,874
the general back-alley ambience
of the suite was so rotten...

692
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:45,336
- so incredibly foul.
- ~

693
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:49,589
How long had I
been lying there ?

694
00:40:49,673 --> 00:40:52,383
All these signs of violence.

695
00:40:52,425 --> 00:40:54,719
- What had happened ?

696
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:57,221
There was evidence in this room
of excessive consumption...

697
00:40:57,304 --> 00:41:01,850
of almost every type of drug
known to civilized man since 1544 A.D.

698
00:41:09,148 --> 00:41:11,567
Oh, ah, Debbie.

699
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,694
Thank God.

700
00:41:13,777 --> 00:41:16,488
Oh, Debbie. Hmm ? Look.

701
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:23,244
What kind of addict would need
all these coconut husks
and crushed honeydew rinds ?

702
00:41:23,744 --> 00:41:26,789
Would the presence of junkies account
for all these uneaten french fries ?

703
00:41:26,872 --> 00:41:30,041
These puddles of glazed ketchup
on the bureau ?

704
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,210
Maybe so...

705
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:34,712
but then why all this booze...

706
00:41:34,796 --> 00:41:37,173
and these crude pornographic
photos smeared with mustard...

707
00:41:37,256 --> 00:41:39,591
that had dried
to a hard, yellow crust ?

708
00:41:39,633 --> 00:41:42,594
These were not the hoofprints
of your normal God-fearing junkie.

709
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:45,430
It was too savage,
too aggressive.

710
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,015
- Put your hands where I can see them.
- What ? What ?

711
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:50,017
Jesus God, man. Huh ?

712
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:54,104
Put your hands where I can see them.
Put your hands where I can see them !

713
00:41:56,148 --> 00:41:59,025
Grim memories
and bad flashbacks.

714
00:41:59,108 --> 00:42:01,027
Get a grip.

715
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,779
Maintain.

716
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:07,574
How many nights and weird mornings
had this shit been going on ?

717
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:28,718
- Something ugly had happened.
I was sure of it.

718
00:42:33,555 --> 00:42:36,600
Who is that ? Oh.
Shit, that's me.

719
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:44,648
- Help me !
- What the fuck ?

720
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:47,568
- Oh, shit.

721
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,448
- You're under arrest !
- She must have used a pass key.

722
00:42:53,531 --> 00:42:56,951
I was polishing my shoes
in the closet when I noticed
her sneaking in, so I took her.

723
00:42:57,034 --> 00:42:59,953
- What made you do it ?
Who paid you off ?
- Nobody ! I'm the maid !

724
00:43:00,037 --> 00:43:02,998
- You're just as much
a part of it as they are.
- Part of what ?

725
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,668
The goddamn dope ring. You must
know what's going on in this hotel.

726
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,878
Why do you think
we're here ?

727
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,589
I know you're the cops, but I thought
you were just here for the convention.

728
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:16,218
I swear. All I wanted to do
was clean up the room.

729
00:43:16,301 --> 00:43:19,762
- I don't know anything about no dope.
- Come on, baby.

730
00:43:19,846 --> 00:43:22,431
Don't try to tell us you never heard
of the Grange Gorman.

731
00:43:22,515 --> 00:43:25,017
I swear to Jesus
I never heard of that stuff.

732
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,645
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Maybe she's not part of it.

733
00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:31,523
I swear I'm not.
I swear.

734
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:36,569
In that case,
maybe she can help.

735
00:43:36,652 --> 00:43:39,029
Oh, yes, I'll help you
all you want.

736
00:43:39,113 --> 00:43:42,657
- I hate dope.
- So do we.

737
00:43:42,741 --> 00:43:46,619
I think we should put her on the
payroll, see what she comes up with.

738
00:43:46,703 --> 00:43:48,913
- You think you can handle it ?
- What ?

739
00:43:48,996 --> 00:43:51,081
One phone call every day.

740
00:43:51,165 --> 00:43:54,001
Don't worry if it doesn't add up.
That's our problem.

741
00:43:54,084 --> 00:43:56,253
Y-You'd pay me for that ?

742
00:43:56,336 --> 00:43:59,506
You're damn right
we would.

743
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:02,258
But the first time that you say anything
about this to anybody...

744
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:05,094
you will go straight to prison
for the rest of your life.

745
00:44:05,177 --> 00:44:07,095
- What's your name ?
- Alice.

746
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:09,097
Prove it !

747
00:44:09,181 --> 00:44:12,684
- Okay.
- Just ring Linen Service
and ask for Alice.

748
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:14,936
All right, Alice.

749
00:44:17,771 --> 00:44:22,442
You'll be contacted
by Inspector Rock, Arthur Rock.

750
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:26,112
He'll be posing as a politician, but
you'll have no problem recognizing him.

751
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:30,366
That's right, Inspector Rock
will pay you in cash...

752
00:44:30,449 --> 00:44:33,702
- $1,000 on the ninth of every month.
- Oh, Lord !

753
00:44:33,786 --> 00:44:35,787
I'd do just about
anything for that.

754
00:44:35,871 --> 00:44:38,456
- You and a lot of other people.
- Come here.

755
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,626
The password is:
"One hand washes the other."

756
00:44:41,709 --> 00:44:45,587
The minute you hear that,
you say, "l fear nothing."

757
00:44:45,629 --> 00:44:47,673
- Say it.
- I fear nothing.

758
00:44:47,756 --> 00:44:49,883
- Say it again !
- I fear nothing !

759
00:44:49,966 --> 00:44:52,552
Get the fuck out of here.
Oh, yeah, listen.

760
00:44:52,594 --> 00:44:54,554
Nice meeting you.

761
00:44:55,596 --> 00:44:57,556
Don't bother
to make up the room.

762
00:44:57,598 --> 00:45:00,559
Just leave a pile of towels and soap
outside the door exactly at midnight.

763
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:04,562
That way we won't have to risk another
one of these little incidents, will we ?

764
00:45:04,646 --> 00:45:08,149
- Whatever you say, gentlemen.
- Thank God for decent people.

765
00:45:08,316 --> 00:45:11,443
- Say it again !
- I fear nothing !

766
00:45:11,527 --> 00:45:15,489
Terrible gibberish. Splintered
memories looming up out of the time fog.

767
00:45:15,572 --> 00:45:18,783
- Just press play.

768
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:22,161
This is it, the American Dream.

769
00:45:22,245 --> 00:45:24,747
We're sitting
on the main nerve right now.

770
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,749
Yeah, don't get me started.

771
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,835
The owner always wanted to run away and
join the circus when he was a kid.

772
00:45:29,918 --> 00:45:33,087
Now the son of a bitch
owns the circus.

773
00:45:33,171 --> 00:45:36,507
Ah, man,
a real license to steal.

774
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:39,843
Oh, yeah. The American Dream
come true, man.

775
00:45:39,927 --> 00:45:42,179
Pure Horatio Alger.

776
00:45:42,262 --> 00:45:44,472
Yeah. Welcome
to the happy place.

777
00:45:46,641 --> 00:45:50,227
Listen, let's get down
to brass tacks here.

778
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:52,354
How much for the ape ?

779
00:45:52,438 --> 00:45:54,940
How much you got ?

780
00:45:55,023 --> 00:45:59,319
How much do you think you'd take for the
ape ? Just wait here. I'll be back.

781
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,530
- Madness. It made no sense at all.

782
00:46:02,613 --> 00:46:04,532
I desperately
needed the facts.

783
00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:14,874
- ~
- What the fuck is going on ?

784
00:46:14,957 --> 00:46:17,209
Where's the ape, man ?
Where's the ape ?

785
00:46:17,293 --> 00:46:19,670
Forget about it.
He attacked an old man.

786
00:46:19,712 --> 00:46:22,798
Bit off the head of the bartender,
then the cops came and took him away.

787
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,136
- Is that your car ?

788
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:36,059
- Somebody stop them !
- You poor fools don't understand.

789
00:46:36,101 --> 00:46:38,937
This car is property of the World Bank.
That money goes to lately.

790
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,314
You can't put on a circus
without a tent.

791
00:46:41,397 --> 00:46:44,567
- The top is completely jammed.
- You're right.

792
00:46:44,608 --> 00:46:46,568
There's something wrong
with the motor.

793
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:48,570
All right,
who has the story ?

794
00:46:48,654 --> 00:46:51,698
- Where are you, you fucking monkey ?
- You can't do that !

795
00:46:53,491 --> 00:46:55,785
You people voted
for Hubert Humphrey.

796
00:46:55,868 --> 00:46:57,828
And you killed Jesus.

797
00:46:57,912 --> 00:47:00,205
There was every reason to believe
that we'd been heading for trouble...

798
00:47:00,247 --> 00:47:02,749
that we'd pushed our luck
a bit too far.

799
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:06,377
Oh, gosh ! God.

800
00:47:07,795 --> 00:47:09,880
Right. Uh--

801
00:47:09,964 --> 00:47:11,924
The possibility...

802
00:47:12,007 --> 00:47:15,260
of physical
and mental collapse...

803
00:47:15,344 --> 00:47:18,138
is now very real.

804
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:20,640
No sympathy for the devil.

805
00:47:20,682 --> 00:47:22,892
Keep that in mind.

806
00:47:22,975 --> 00:47:25,519
Uh, buy the ticket...

807
00:47:25,603 --> 00:47:27,980
uh, take the ride.

808
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:35,820
Hey, there. You folks want
to buy some heroin ?

809
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:45,829
Hey, honkies ! Goddamn it !

810
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:47,830
Pull ahead,
will you ?

811
00:47:47,872 --> 00:47:51,375
I want to sell you
some pure fucking scag !

812
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:54,002
Cheap ! The real stuff.

813
00:47:54,086 --> 00:47:57,714
I just got back
from Vietnam.

814
00:48:03,177 --> 00:48:05,137
Scag.

815
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:10,183
I want to sell you
some pure fucking scag.

816
00:48:10,267 --> 00:48:12,727
Shit ! Fuck !

817
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:17,356
Now hear me, you bastard !
Pull over ! I'll kill you !

818
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:20,567
- Pull over ! Come on !

819
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:23,361
Oh, shit. Oh, oh.

820
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:26,406
~

821
00:48:30,868 --> 00:48:34,913
Okay.
Let's see here.

822
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:40,168
~

823
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:46,256
The mentality of Las Vegas
is so grossly atavistic...

824
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,010
that a really massive crime
often slips by unrecognized.

825
00:48:55,306 --> 00:48:59,101
North Vegas is where you go when you've
fucked up once too often on the strip...

826
00:48:59,143 --> 00:49:03,188
- and when you're not even welcome
in the cut-rate downtown places.

827
00:49:07,984 --> 00:49:12,029
The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed like
a fairly safe haven from our storms.

828
00:49:12,112 --> 00:49:14,448
No hassles, no talk.

829
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:17,117
Just a place to rest
and regroup.

830
00:49:17,158 --> 00:49:19,702
I wasn't even hungry.

831
00:49:19,786 --> 00:49:22,997
There was nothing in the atmosphere of
the North Star to put me on my guard.

832
00:49:25,124 --> 00:49:27,543
Two glasses of ice water
with ice.

833
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:32,046
Two glasses of ice water
with ice.

834
00:49:36,217 --> 00:49:38,177
Two.

835
00:49:46,392 --> 00:49:49,353
She looked line a burnt-out
caricature of Jane Russell.

836
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:52,981
She was definitely
in charge here.

837
00:49:57,485 --> 00:49:59,612
He did it very casually...

838
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:03,407
but I knew that our peace
was about to be shattered.

839
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:05,409
What was that ?

840
00:50:16,544 --> 00:50:18,462
What is this ?

841
00:50:18,545 --> 00:50:21,798
- It's a napkin.
- Don't give me that bullshit.

842
00:50:21,882 --> 00:50:24,843
I know what that means,
you fat goddamn pimp bastard !

843
00:50:26,427 --> 00:50:29,263
That's the name of a horse
I used to own, ma'am.

844
00:50:29,347 --> 00:50:31,932
- What's wrong with you ?
The question mark was emphasized.

845
00:50:32,016 --> 00:50:34,601
You listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

846
00:50:34,685 --> 00:50:39,731
I gotta take a lot of shit
in this place, but I don't have
to take it off no spic pimp !

847
00:50:43,734 --> 00:50:46,195
Anybody that knows anything
knows that.

848
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,825
- Go on ! Pay your check
and get out of here !

849
00:50:51,908 --> 00:50:55,244
You want me to call the cops ?
I'll call the fuck--

850
00:50:55,328 --> 00:50:58,539
Oh, shit.

851
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:03,543
Fuck.

852
00:51:05,879 --> 00:51:08,172
Want me to call the cops ?

853
00:51:34,529 --> 00:51:36,822
How much is that
lemon meringue pie ?

854
00:51:36,864 --> 00:51:39,825
Her eyes were turgid with fear,
but her brain was functioning...

855
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:43,161
- on some basic motor survival level.
- Thirty-five cents.

856
00:51:43,203 --> 00:51:46,331
- How much is that lemon meringue pie ?
- Thirty-five cents.

857
00:51:46,414 --> 00:51:50,126
Whoo ! What a waste of talent.

858
00:51:50,209 --> 00:51:53,837
No, honey,
I mean the whole pie.

859
00:51:55,547 --> 00:51:57,507
The whole pie.

860
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:02,011
- Hmm ?

861
00:52:09,351 --> 00:52:12,061
What, three ?

862
00:52:17,024 --> 00:52:20,110
Three ? Four ?

863
00:52:22,362 --> 00:52:24,406
Five ? Hmm ?

864
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,407
Five.

865
00:52:52,222 --> 00:52:54,474
I'll be in the car.

866
00:53:50,773 --> 00:53:54,109
The sight of the blade
had triggered bad memories.

867
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:57,404
The glazed look in her eyes
said her throat had been cut.

868
00:53:57,487 --> 00:54:00,907
- She was still in the grip
of paralysis when we left.

869
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:12,375
It was all over now.

870
00:54:12,459 --> 00:54:15,294
We'd abused every rule
that Vegas lived by.

871
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:20,674
Threatening the locals, abusing
the tourists, terrifying the help.

872
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,093
The only chance now,
I felt...

873
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:26,763
was the possibility that
we'd gone to such excess...

874
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:29,640
that nobody in the position to bring
the hammer down on us...

875
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,767
could possibly believe it.

876
00:54:31,809 --> 00:54:34,603
Fifteen minutes to get
my attorney to the airport...

877
00:54:34,686 --> 00:54:37,188
but we'll make it.

878
00:54:37,272 --> 00:54:40,191
Christ !

879
00:54:40,275 --> 00:54:43,486
No ! Oh, fuck !

880
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:45,988
- Fuck.
- Whoa, shit ! Whoa, shit !

881
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:49,116
Oh, God. Oh, God.
You son of a bitch !

882
00:54:49,157 --> 00:54:51,451
Oh, God.

883
00:54:51,534 --> 00:54:55,621
- You're going the wrong way.
- The next left.

884
00:54:55,705 --> 00:54:58,332
Go ! Fuck !

885
00:55:02,294 --> 00:55:06,047
Take a right here.
Take a right here.

886
00:55:13,971 --> 00:55:16,848
Goddamn it. We're lost.

887
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:20,727
What are we doing out here
on this godforsaken road ?

888
00:55:20,768 --> 00:55:22,728
The airport's over there.

889
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:26,315
Goddamn it !
It's over there.

890
00:55:26,398 --> 00:55:29,151
- I've never missed a plane yet.

891
00:55:51,754 --> 00:55:54,673
Hold on !

892
00:55:59,636 --> 00:56:02,221
All right. I'm gonna drop you
right next to the plane.

893
00:56:02,305 --> 00:56:05,224
Fuck you. I'm gonna have to take
the blame. They'll crucify me.

894
00:56:05,307 --> 00:56:07,559
- Right here, right here.
- Ridiculous, man.

895
00:56:07,643 --> 00:56:11,438
Just say you were hitchhiking
to the airport, and I picked you up.

896
00:56:11,813 --> 00:56:13,940
- You bastard.
- Get out.

897
00:56:24,824 --> 00:56:26,868
Hey, hey !
Hey, listen.

898
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:29,912
Don't take any guff
from these swine.

899
00:56:29,996 --> 00:56:32,748
If you have any trouble,
remember:

900
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:35,751
you can always send a telegram
to the right people.

901
00:56:35,834 --> 00:56:39,921
Yeah, explaining my position. Some
asshole wrote a poem about that once.

902
00:56:40,004 --> 00:56:43,215
Probably good advice,
if you have shit for brains.

903
00:56:48,887 --> 00:56:51,681
There he goes...

904
00:56:51,723 --> 00:56:54,308
one of God's own prototypes.

905
00:56:54,392 --> 00:56:58,938
A high-powered mutant of some kind never
even considered for mass production.

906
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:02,357
-Too weird to live, and too rare to die.
-Ugh !

907
00:57:23,584 --> 00:57:28,714
~ There you stood on
the edge of your feather ~

908
00:57:29,965 --> 00:57:34,052
~ Expecting to fly ~

909
00:57:37,263 --> 00:57:40,557
We're all wired
into a survival trip now.

910
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:44,728
No more of the speed
that fueled the '60s.

911
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:47,897
That was the fatal flaw
in Tim Leary's trip.

912
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,066
He crashed around America,
selling "consciousness expansion"...

913
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:54,319
without ever giving a thought
to the grim meat-hook realities
that were lying in wait...

914
00:57:54,403 --> 00:57:57,947
for all those people
who took him seriously.

915
00:57:57,989 --> 00:58:00,283
All those pathetically eager
acid freaks...

916
00:58:00,325 --> 00:58:04,286
who thought they could buy peace and
understanding for three bucks a hit.

917
00:58:04,328 --> 00:58:06,955
But their loss
and failure...

918
00:58:06,997 --> 00:58:09,624
is ours too.

919
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:12,627
What Leary took down with him was the
central illusion of a whole lifestyle...

920
00:58:12,669 --> 00:58:14,837
that he helped create.

921
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:17,298
A generation
of permanent cripples...

922
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:19,299
failed seekers...

923
00:58:19,341 --> 00:58:23,678
who never understood the essential
old-mystic fallacy of the acid culture:

924
00:58:23,762 --> 00:58:26,764
the desperate assumption
that somebody...

925
00:58:26,848 --> 00:58:28,808
or at least some force...

926
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:31,227
is tending the light
at the end of the tunnel.

927
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,985
There was only one road
back to L.A.

928
00:58:41,027 --> 00:58:44,029
U.S. Interstate 15.

929
00:58:44,113 --> 00:58:48,033
Just a flat out high-speed burn
through Baker and Barstow and Berdoo.

930
00:58:48,116 --> 00:58:50,702
Then onto the Hollywood Freeway,
straight into frantic oblivion...

931
00:58:50,785 --> 00:58:53,079
safety, obscurity.

932
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:56,332
Just another freak...
in the freak kingdom.

933
00:58:56,415 --> 00:59:01,086
~ I was born
in a cross-fire hurricane ~

934
00:59:03,171 --> 00:59:08,217
~ But I howled at my ma
in the driving rain ~

935
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:15,140
~ But it's all right now ~

936
00:59:15,182 --> 00:59:17,267
~ In fact, it's a gas ~

937
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:21,229
~ But it's all right ~

938
00:59:21,312 --> 00:59:24,148
~ I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas ~

939
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:39,411
~ I was raised
by a toothless, bearded hag ~

940
00:59:41,663 --> 00:59:46,918
~ I was schooled with a strap
right across my back ~

941
00:59:48,544 --> 00:59:53,465
~ But it's all right now ~

942
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:55,509
~ In fact, it's a gas ~

943
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:59,512
~ But it's all right ~

944
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:03,391
~ I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas ~

945
01:00:32,124 --> 01:00:37,587
~ I was drowned
I was washed up and left for dead ~

946
01:00:39,255 --> 01:00:41,549
~ I fell down to my feet ~

947
01:00:41,632 --> 01:00:44,677
~ And I saw they bled ~

948
01:00:44,718 --> 01:00:47,846
~ Yeah, yeah
I frowned ~

949
01:00:47,888 --> 01:00:51,683
~ At the crumbs
of a crust of bread ~

950
01:00:51,766 --> 01:00:54,769
~ Yeah, yeah, yeah
I was crowned ~

951
01:00:54,852 --> 01:00:58,606
~ With a spike
right through my head ~

952
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:00,023
~ Yeah, yeah, yeah ~

953
01:01:00,107 --> 01:01:04,986
~ But it's all right now ~

954
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:07,030
~ In fact, it's a gas ~

955
01:01:07,113 --> 01:01:10,991
~ But it's all right ~

956
01:01:11,075 --> 01:01:14,953
~ I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas ~

957
01:01:18,289 --> 01:01:21,584
~ Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas ~

958
01:01:21,626 --> 01:01:25,045
~ Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas ~

959
01:01:25,087 --> 01:01:28,590
~ Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas ~

960
01:01:28,674 --> 01:01:30,967
~ Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas ~

961
01:01:32,177 --> 01:01:35,638
~ Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas ~

962
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,058
~ Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas ~

963
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:44,281
~ Bright light city
gonna set my soul ~

964
01:02:44,365 --> 01:02:47,576
~ It's gonna set my soul
on fire ~

965
01:02:47,659 --> 01:02:50,662
~ I got a whole lotta money
that's a-ready to burn ~

966
01:02:50,745 --> 01:02:53,831
~ So get those stakes up high ~

967
01:02:53,915 --> 01:02:57,585
~ There's a thousand
pretty women waitin' out there ~

968
01:02:57,626 --> 01:03:00,712
~ They're all waitin'
The devil may care ~

969
01:03:00,796 --> 01:03:03,882
~ And I'm just a devil
with love to spare ~

970
01:03:03,965 --> 01:03:07,260
~ So Viva Las Vegas ~

971
01:03:07,343 --> 01:03:10,471
~ Viva Las Vegas ~

972
01:03:10,554 --> 01:03:13,432
~ Viva Las Vegas ~

973
01:03:15,308 --> 01:03:17,894
~ How I wish
that there were more ~

974
01:03:17,977 --> 01:03:21,564
~ Than the 24 hours
in the day ~

975
01:03:21,647 --> 01:03:24,275
~ Even if I ran out of sleep ~

976
01:03:24,316 --> 01:03:27,319
~ Boy, I wouldn't sleep
a minute away ~

977
01:03:27,402 --> 01:03:30,905
~ Oh, there's blackjack and
poker and the roulette wheel ~

978
01:03:30,947 --> 01:03:34,283
~ A fortune won and lost
on every deal ~

979
01:03:34,325 --> 01:03:37,161
~ All you need's a strong heart
and nerves of steel ~

980
01:03:37,244 --> 01:03:40,747
~ So Viva Las Vegas ~

~ Viva Las Vegas ~

983
01:03:47,086 --> 01:03:49,964
~ Viva Las Vegas
where the neon signs are flashing ~

984
01:03:50,047 --> 01:03:51,966
~ And the one-armed bandits
crashing ~

985
01:03:52,007 --> 01:03:55,010
~ All those hopes
down the drain ~

986
01:03:55,052 --> 01:03:57,887
~ Viva Las Vegas
turning day into nighttime ~

987
01:03:57,971 --> 01:03:59,889
~ Turning night into daytime ~

988
01:03:59,973 --> 01:04:03,559
~ lf you see it once
you'll never be the same again ~

989
01:04:05,894 --> 01:04:08,647
~ I gotta keep on runnin'
Gonna have me some fun ~

990
01:04:08,689 --> 01:04:12,150
~ lf it costs me
my very last dime ~

991
01:04:12,192 --> 01:04:15,236
~ lf I wind up broke
then I'll always remember ~

992
01:04:15,319 --> 01:04:18,113
~ That I had a swingin' time ~

993
01:04:18,197 --> 01:04:21,825
~ Oh, I'm gonna give it
everything I've got ~

994
01:04:21,867 --> 01:04:24,869
~ Lady Luck's with me
Dice, stay hot ~

995
01:04:24,911 --> 01:04:27,830
~ Got coke up my nose
to dry away the snot ~
