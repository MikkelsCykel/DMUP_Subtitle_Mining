00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,991
1, 2, 3...

2
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,112
Hi, Grandpa!

3
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,517
Hey!

4
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:01,092
Grandpa, over here!

5
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,427
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Grandpa!

6
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,297
Everybody now, happy Fourth of July!

7
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,597
Thanks, Grandpa!

8
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,638
That's it, go ahead, kids.

9
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,866
Dig in. I made 'em myself.

10
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,238
- Bleh!
- Blech!

11
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:19,107
Pretty good.
How's that taste there, Timmy?

12
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,238
Uh, I'm not really hungry right now.

13
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,111
Why don't you tell us a story?

14
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,584
- Yeah! One of your great stories!
- Yeah, one of your stories!

15
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,417
All right, how about the one
that you kids always love?

16
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,583
- The, uh... the story of Scrooge.
- Scrooge?!

17
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,560
- The guy who hated Christmas?
- That's dumb.

18
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:39,621
Well, uh, sort of, but this Scrooge
hated the Fourth of July.

19
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,496
Why does he hate the Fourth of July?

20
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,800
Well, uh, the story begins
high on a mountaintop,

21
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,841
far away in Afghanistan.

22
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,943
- Mohammed?
- Yes, sir?

23
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,077
Quiet! Calm down!

24
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,423
- They're all named Mohammed, sir.
- Yes, of course.

25
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,426
I must remember to use last names.

26
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,792
- Hussein!
- Yes, sir?

27
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,358
For God's sake, you!

28
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,568
- Is that your brother?
- Hussein?

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,971
Why is he voting?

30
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,737
It's not his fault.
He is the campaign manager.

31
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,371
- What? For who?
- Mohammed Hussein.

32
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,848
- Yes, sir!
- Quiet!

33
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,248
All right, everyone.

34
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,483
Well, who's going to be the first?

35
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,949
I am.

36
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:41,516
Ah, very good. Very good.
And what is your name, young man?

37
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,585
- Mu...
- Forget it. Mount up.

38
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,360
- Allahu Akbar.
- What exactly did I volunteer for?

39
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,368
Messenger duty.
Excellent pay.

40
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,996
But, sir, this bicycle...

41
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,540
- What's wrong?
- Well, it's kind of rickety.

42
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,701
I don't know if it can
get back up the hill.

43
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,007
I wouldn't worry about that.

44
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,547
- Maybe if I take some bombs off...
- No, no, no.

45
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:06,073
It is a part of the uniform.

46
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,145
And it doesn't seem
to have any brakes.

47
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,714
It's OK.
Allah will stop you.

48
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,988
Of course.

49
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,294
Oh, yeah, Allah will stop me.

50
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,269
Jesus!

51
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,908
You! Go get him.

52
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,186
I found the problem, sir!

53
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,021
This idiot forgot to pull the firing...

54
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,433
Don't you see?

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,094
We have at least destroyed
an infidel's car.

56
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,730
That was my car.

57
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,014
What's going on here?

58
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,384
What are you people doing?

59
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,787
Why are you voting
in this infidel election?

60
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,791
Because we want democracy,

61
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,692
freedom, elect a president
who will be accountable.

62
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,026
Enough! Mohammed, take care of him!

63
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,794
Mohammed, what in the name
of Allah are you doing?

64
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:32,031
I'm not voting for president. But I feel
strongly about Proposition 12.

65
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,505
A marriage should be
between a man and a woman.

66
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,543
Or between a man
and a really good-looking man.

67
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:42,707
- Shut up.
- This is what you vote for?

68
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,717
That and immigration.
We need a guest worker program

69
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,618
so that the Mexicans can do the job
the Taliban won't.

70
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,789
These Western ideas are dangerous.

71
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,730
We must resist them at every turn.

72
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,234
Leader, we're not strong anymore.

73
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,703
Since the Americans came,
people have hope.

74
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,503
- They are voting, woman own businesses.
- Yes, it is getting harder

75
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,510
to find suicide bombers,
and all the good ones are gone.

76
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:16,105
Sir, I think we might need
a new recruitment video.

77
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,979
Look, ours...

78
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,713
it looks, you know, cheap.

79
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,690
This video will teach you.

80
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,817
Here are Ahmed and Ahman.

81
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,920
They may be brothers,
but they couldn't be more different.

82
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,625
Ahmed knows punctuality is important.

83
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,635
He's sure to leave plenty of time
to get to his bombing site.

84
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,439
Ahman leaves
everything to the last minute.

85
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,500
Oh, shit!

86
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,342
Ahmed double checks
the address of the site

87
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,779
so there are no mistakes.

88
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,316
Ahman doesn't.

89
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,147
2518, 2519...

90
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,948
Shit!

91
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,216
Ahmed dresses properly,

92
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,623
wearing clothing that is loose enough
to hide his explosives.

93
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,423
Ahman dresses inappropriately.

94
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:08,791
You are right.
It is awful.

95
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,563
If I may suggest, sir,

96
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:14,572
what we need is
a real Hollywood director to help us.

97
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,337
But he must hate America.

98
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,471
This won't be hard to find in
Hollywood. They all hate America.

99
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,847
Yes, but your average, girly-man
Hollywood director won't be enough.

100
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,946
What we need is someone
who really, really hates America.

101
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,986
Is the camera on?
OK, action. Ahem.

102
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,030
I am on the island
paradise, Cuba,

103
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,156
where there's a hospital
on every block.

104
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,691
As we can see, Cubans have the very best
health care in the world.

105
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,863
Not like America,
where it can kill you.

106
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,702
I've got two Americans here,
Bob and Joan Friedman,

107
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,869
injured during Hurricane Katrina,
caused by you know who.

108
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,378
But haven't been able
to get an American doctor

109
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,678
to pay a house call to their
gated community in Shaker Heights.

110
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,878
- Another mojito!
- Why? Because we're spending money

111
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,649
on military buildup
for this phony war on terror.

112
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,557
Doctor, we just want the same care
you give your own people.

113
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,060
OK, then get in line.

114
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,152
Oh, oh! Comrades!

115
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,993
- End of the line, gringo!
- No skipping!

116
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,693
Cuba is famous for its
free prescription drug plan.

117
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,928
What do you have for me?

118
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,561
- Take these.
- OK.

119
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:19,969
These are breath mints.

120
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,770
Sí, señor. Take two.

121
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,743
OK, pal, there ya go.

122
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,837
Free. That'll make you feel better.

123
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,438
There you go.

124
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,450
Free. You know, in America,
that'd cost an arm and a leg.

125
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,612
- Aw, jeez. Dude.
- Sorry.

126
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,282
That's OK, Paco, you'll be
back on your feet in no time.

127
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,722
- Cuba. More...
- Ready...

128
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,850
- than the jewel...
- Aim...

129
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,053
- of the Caribbean.
- Fire!

130
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,495
- A country that cares for its citizens.
- Finally, we can move up!

131
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,157
God! This is paradise!

132
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,691
I gotta get back, but I can be
assured that my American friends

133
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,739
are in good hands
in the Cuban health care system.

134
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,036
It's time for me to leave

135
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,737
and say goodbye
to all my little brown friends.

136
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,074
And it's off to America.

137
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,307
America!

138
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,678
He's going to America!

139
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,011
He said America!

140
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,950
- Take me!
- Take me!

141
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,512
I do want to say...

142
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,458
Get out! Get out!

143
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:20,488
So many people wanted
to thank me, they rushed the boat.

144
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,797
These people know how bad
it's gotten in America.

145
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,000
Well, I guess they wanted me to spread
the word about what a paradise Cuba is.

146
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,475
Off my boat!

147
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,533
Yeah!

148
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,046
He thought
everybody loved his movies.

149
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,547
- Did they?
- No!

150
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,847
Nobody loves documentaries.
But people do find them restful.

151
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,646
Thank you! Thank you!

152
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,849
Thank you!

153
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:48,189
Thank you for that
great New York reception.

154
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,491
But as important as this movie is,

155
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:54,363
even more important is
the largest peace demonstration

156
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,128
the world has ever known.

157
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,603
This Sunday,
we're gonna abolish July 4th.

158
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,501
Why did he hate Fourth of July?

159
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,976
It was America's birthday
party and he wasn't invited.

160
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,513
Grandpa, get back to the story!

161
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,709
We're sending packages to soldiers
for the Fourth of July.

162
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,878
They're far from their home,
away from their families.

163
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:18,549
They shouldn't be. Shouldn't you
be in a tent somewhere, tyin' knots?

164
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,425
Oh, ho, now, this is more like it!
There ya go.

165
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:27,990
I'll take three chocolate mints,
three fudge...

166
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,365
Oh, merit badges.
What are those for?

167
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,428
Well, this is for making
a safety display.

168
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:37,169
This one's for camping,
and this is a good manners badge.

169
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,876
For being respectful
to a fat, ignorant,

170
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,278
traitorous sack of shit.

171
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,381
Grandpa!

172
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,941
- Grandpa!
- I heard you!

173
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,782
Oh, what? I didn't say that.

174
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:49,912
I said, uh...

175
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,685
Fat, ignorant, America-hating traitor.

176
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,749
- You did say that.
- No, I didn't.

177
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,818
The spirit is back.

178
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,559
We are on a roll, people.
This rally will be historic.

179
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,727
- Most important since Nixon.
- Nixon?

180
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,397
Total dork president
from around the Civil War.

181
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,838
All the most important
progressive organizations

182
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,239
will be represented. Jane?

183
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,904
So far, People
For The Anti-American Way,

184
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,643
Vegans Against Fur,
Man-boy Love Boat,

185
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,743
Potawamie Casino,
Church of Entitlement,

186
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,219
- and, um...
- And?

187
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,155
And... it's still early.

188
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,248
The rally's Sunday!

189
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,088
Don't worry, we'll get more.

190
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,754
We're not shaving till
they bring the troops home.

191
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,492
- Thank you, boys.
- They're women.

192
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,291
Right.

193
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,462
Like all of us.

194
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:43,873
We have to ban military recruiters
from college campuses. They interfere...

195
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,137
Excuse me.

196
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,078
Are you here to join
Sailors Against War?

197
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,980
No, uh, I think all sailors
are against war,

198
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,642
but sometimes we have to fight.

199
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,049
Soldiers Against Guns?

200
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,112
No. Those guns come in handy
when we do fight.

201
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,589
The Don't Ask, Don't Tell Brigade?

202
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,024
No, uh, please.

203
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,995
I'm just here looking for my uncle.
His name is...

204
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:10,092
- Uncle Michael, hey.
- Josh?

205
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,529
Hey. This is my... nephew.

206
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:19,305
Josh. He's, uh...

207
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,970
What are you doin' here?

208
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,380
I came here to invite you
to our Fourth of July barbecue,

209
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,712
like I do every year.

210
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:29,551
Well, that's very nice of you... again,
but I'm a little busy here.

211
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,182
"Abolish July 4th." Are you kidding?

212
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,455
This is no joke.
Why should I celebrate a country

213
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,020
that's caused oppression and terror
all over the world?

214
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,224
Is that how he felt?

215
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,824
He was a war hero.
P. T. 109.

216
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,598
He would've come around.
If he were alive today,

217
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,469
this Sunday, he'd be
marchin' with us in solidarity.

218
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,408
Uncle Michael, I realize
how strongly you feel,

219
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,674
but Lily and I just...

220
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,079
We won't be going too late.

221
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,243
A lot of our guests are going
to the Trace Adkins concert.

222
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,656
- Who's Trace Adkins?
- I'm good.

223
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,715
He's a big country music star.

224
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,488
Maybe not in New York,
but in the rest of the country.

225
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,496
Country music doesn't speak to me.

226
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,692
Not just because the music's awful
or the lyrics are stupid,

227
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,225
or everybody dresses like that cowboy
from the Village People.

228
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,535
- How's little Billy?
- Timmy.

229
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,599
Not very well, I'm afraid,
but he's got great spirit.

230
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,840
- He'd love to see you.
- Well, maybe I'll stop by next week.

231
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,972
It'll probably be too late.

232
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,644
- Oh, little Jimmy.
- Timmy.

233
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:37,246
No. He'll probably
still be around, but...

234
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,951
I'm shipping out to
the Persian Gulf Sunday night.

235
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,391
Well, can't you get out of it?

236
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,487
I want to go. It's my duty.

237
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,089
I don't get it.
How can you be related to me?

238
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:52,001
Mr. Malone, your 1:00 is here
with people from Abolish The Military.

239
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,734
Well, I guess I got some work to do.

240
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,801
Well, you're invited
in case you change your mind.

241
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,937
Right. Sure.

242
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,311
Uncle Michael, I came
here in good spirits,

243
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,816
and I don't want to let
anything change that.

244
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:09,150
Happy Fourth of July, everyone,
and God bless America!

245
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,988
Grandpa, get back to the story!

246
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,624
I've never left it.

247
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,840
I'm meeting my agent, Todd Grosslight.

248
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,247
Oh, yes.

249
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,548
I'm sorry, sir, but gentlemen
are required to wear a jacket.

250
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,281
Look, don't you know who I am?

251
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,822
I'm Michael Malone.

252
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,257
Well, then perhaps a shower as well.

253
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,427
What the hell? I didn't make
the top 10? That's impossible!

254
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,299
Apparently, the people who like
your movies don't actually go to movies.

255
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,827
No one wants to see Americans
screwed by foreigners, except in porn.

256
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,635
I haven't done porn in years!

257
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:11,076
- Anyway, I'm an Oscar-winning director.
- For a documentary. Come on.

258
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,913
I know that.

259
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,249
I gotta do a feature like John Ford.

260
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,085
That man was a true filmmaker.

261
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:22,025
The sweeping vision, the amazing
panoramas of Monument Valley.

262
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,686
And soldiers were good guys.

263
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:27,061
But you're leading
a demonstration against our troops.

264
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,225
Oh, right, on the Fourth of July.

265
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,600
- It's not against the troops.
- Oh, save it for your crazies.

266
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,196
Look, Mikey,

267
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,076
this is a fickle town.

268
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,237
See the maitre d' over there, huh?

269
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,474
Used to be recurring on Seinfeld.

270
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,345
Hey, call me.

271
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,512
Now, what is this feature
you have in mind?

272
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:53,649
It's a powerful drama about oppressed
people adrift in a world gone mad.

273
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,750
Hmm!

274
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:58,991
It's anti-everything-America-stands-for
without being anti-American.

275
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,497
Hmm...

276
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,859
Fascist America?
Comedy, right?

277
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,871
Wow.
Did you bathe today?

278
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,839
No.

279
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,108
And now,
live from New York City,

280
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,546
it's the MooveAlong. Org Film Awards,

281
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:20,779
hosted by Paris Hilton and Simon Rex.

282
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,650
And now, here are your hosts,

283
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,712
Paris Hilton and Simon Rex.

284
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,317
We are gathered here tonight
because we all share the same goals:

285
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:32,023
Redistribution of wealth,
freedom from the chains of materialism,

286
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,463
and, of course, ending world hunger.

287
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,297
Finally. I'm starving.

288
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,932
It's our pleasure to present
the most prestigious honor

289
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,669
in documentary film,
the Leni Riefenstahl Award.

290
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,512
As Germany's most famous
documentary filmmaker,

291
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,311
Leni Riefenstahl
celebrated the incredible rise

292
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,352
of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler,

293
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,753
becoming a tireless promoter
of his campaign for change.

294
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,519
Her pioneering use
of the wide-angle lens

295
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:03,288
to capture the scope
of massive formations

296
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,990
paved the way for
generations of filmmakers.

297
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,727
Through the creative
manipulation of truth,

298
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:13,295
she was able to influence history,
demonstrating the power of film.

299
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:17,536
Although resulting
in the death of over 60 million people,

300
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,271
her place in any cinematic
hall of fame is secure.

301
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:24,783
And this year's award
for best documentary director goes to...

302
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,581
Michael Malone for
Die, You American Pigs.

303
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,351
This is Michael Malone's
third Moove Along award.

304
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:36,019
He previously won for his documentaries
Shame On You, America,

305
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,962
- and America Sucks A Big One.
- Oh, OK.

306
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,933
Hey. I try to tell the truth
in my films, and I get attacked...

307
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,596
But I'm gonna continue...

308
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,695
Ha.

309
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,034
What is that?

310
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,410
Get my good side.

311
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,385
That concludes the non-televised
portion of the show.

312
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,813
And now the highlight of the evening:

313
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,049
Best Feature Film Director.

314
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,923
And the award goes to...

315
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,757
George Mulrooney!

316
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,094
For That McCarthy Sure Was Bad.

317
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,430
The heroic story
of newscaster

318
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,768
Edward R. Murrow, who half a century
ago took on a drunken U.S. senator

319
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,103
who accused people
of being communists.

320
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,643
This is Mulrooney's
19th Moove Along Award

321
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,078
to go with his 11 Oscars, 9 Emmys,
and two Super Bowl rings.

322
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,140
Thank you. I... I dedicate this award

323
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,617
to all the courageous filmmakers

324
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,449
who take on tough issues

325
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,150
like McCarthyism,
even though it no longer exists,

326
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,489
or like slavery or Nazism,
even though they ended, too.

327
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,088
But you know, evil exists today.
Like, well, Islamic terrorism.

328
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,225
But like I'm gonna
make that movie, right?

329
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,600
Like I want to get beheaded.

330
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,702
- Thank you!
- George! Over here!

331
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,139
Mom?

332
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,121
Huh!

333
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,934
Wow. Mulrooney's so hot.

334
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,331
Excuse us, Director Michael Malone.

335
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,877
I am Ahmed, and this is
my comrade Mohammed.

336
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,934
Nice to meet you.

337
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:38,176
Wait, no. We want you to direct a movie
to inspire the final jihad.

338
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,914
Oh, thanks, fellas, great idea,
but I'm only doin' big-budget features.

339
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,956
How big of a budget would you need?

340
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,082
A feature? 10 million minimum.

341
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,150
Call me when you sold enough falafel.

342
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,997
Ahmed, Mohammed.

343
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,159
Who are you?

344
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,497
It's me.

345
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,570
Aziz!

346
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,010
- What are you doing here?
- We have a more important mission.

347
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,239
- But the movie.
- It can wait.

348
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,942
This will be the most spectacular attack
on the infidels ever.

349
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:15,475
But we need to find someone important
with the right connections.

350
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,079
I'm directing
Mulrooney's next picture.

351
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,352
- Someone like that.
- Director Akbar?

352
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,916
Yes. What will it take
to get him to cooperate?

353
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,360
$10 million.

354
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,330
Well, the opium crop
is very good this year.

355
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,299
Money will be no problem.

356
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,892
Allahu Akbar.

357
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,598
So I said to Spielberg,
Steve, you can't...

358
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,163
Ooh, crab cakes.

359
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,266
Say, want to go to Clint's
party with me?

360
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,401
Director Akbar!

361
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:43,278
- We have glorious news for you...
- George! George!

362
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,406
We have 10 million.

363
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,748
Must have been a good opium
crop this year. George, over here.

364
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,482
- 10 million U.S. dollars, cash.
- Cash? Right!

365
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,048
- Good! So you'll do it.
- Yeah, right.

366
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,118
Have your people contact my people.

367
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,427
I bet she would look great in a burka.

368
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,131
Now, Entertainment Tonight

369
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,940
takes you behind the scenes
to discover where are they now?

370
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,641
We're going to find out
whatever happened to Michael Malone,

371
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,741
the beefy filmmaker who's trying to get

372
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,685
a new movie off the ground,
a feature.

373
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,222
After the news that
his latest movie tanked...

374
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,384
- What?!
- Who is gonna bankroll that?

375
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,258
This past Tuesday,
we finally tracked down

376
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,321
Clyde the orangutan...

377
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,027
- Are you sure you have $10 million?
- Absolutely.

378
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,902
Then why'd you come to me?

379
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,239
We heard you're a big, fat liar.

380
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,006
Sorry. My friend is not detonating
on all cylinders.

381
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,015
He meant, your movies
are filled with big, fat lies.

382
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,143
It's OK. They're documentaries.
They don't have to be true.

383
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,278
Look, I love America.

384
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,586
That's why it needs to be destroyed,
so it'll come to its senses.

385
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,218
Right. Well, anyway,
we need your help.

386
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,319
No matter how many people we kill,

387
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,193
we cannot get rid of the Americans.

388
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,358
We need a movie that shows
we are winning.

389
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,798
Even though we're not.

390
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,029
Director Akbar, we already have an idea.

391
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,664
It's a traditional Taliban love story.

392
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,232
Boy meets girl, boy falls in love
with girl, boy cuts girl's head off.

393
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,607
What?

394
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,340
Happy ending. He preserves his honor.

395
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,850
Look, guys, I'm not gonna do a movie
about homicidal psychopaths

396
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,384
who cut people's heads off.

397
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,319
I'll do it, but it's gonna be my script.

398
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,983
Dramatic story about
how one courageous man

399
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,526
took on the system
and exposed America's evil.

400
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,324
Like Hannah Montana. Wait!

401
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:42,595
Thank you.

402
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,693
You gonna finish that?

403
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,102
Wait. He's going to work
for terrorists?

404
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:50,835
- It's looking that way, isn't it?
- Doesn't that make him a terrorist?

405
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,605
No, silly.
That just makes him a total idiot.

406
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,445
...first-place tie.

407
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,275
John F. Kennedy,
35th president of the United States,

408
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,982
cut down by an assassin's bullet.

409
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:09,153
The tears were not only for a president,
but for what he stood for,

410
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,593
the causes he held dear.

411
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,292
Let us never
negotiate out of fear,

412
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:20,430
- but let us never fear to negotiate.
- My hero. A man of peace.

413
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,530
If only you were president now.

414
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,832
Wait.

415
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,677
If I were president, what?

416
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,923
You said that I was a hero,
a true peacemaker.

417
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,727
You can't be here!

418
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,353
You're dead!

419
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,389
- You must redeem yourself.
- How'd you do that?

420
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,959
This is the greatest country
in history,

421
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,505
and you have slandered it
all over the globe.

422
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:57,872
I was tryin' to be like you.
You wouldn't have gone into Vietnam.

423
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,537
- Who told you that?
- Oliver Stone. In his movie.

424
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,638
Oh, brother! Did you
ever read my inaugural address?

425
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:07,344
Of course! "Ask not what
your country can do for you.

426
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,943
Ask what..."

427
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,046
Not that part.
The part about going to war.

428
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,422
- There was a war part?
- Oh, brother.

429
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,793
Let every nation know,

430
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,334
whether they wish us well or ill,

431
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,768
that we shall pay any price,

432
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,771
bear any burden...

433
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,274
Meet any hardship, support any friend,

434
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:37,304
oppose any foe, to assure the survival

435
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:38,974
and the success of liberty.

436
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,575
Uh, thanks, folks.

437
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,986
I didn't know about the war part.

438
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:48,253
What do you think that meant?
Draft another 8 U.N. resolutions?

439
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,759
You sound like Reagan.

440
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,262
Thank you.
You're not gonna eat that, are you?

441
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:56,061
OK, look, you will be
visited by three spirits.

442
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,328
Listen to them.

443
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,391
Learn from them.

444
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,630
Oh, yeah.

445
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:04,107
The spirits are gonna come scare me,
and I'm gonna be born again, right?

446
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,244
What a douchebag.

447
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:10,672
Hey, wait!

448
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:13,616
Hey, when are these spirits
gonna...

449
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,131
What a nightmare.

450
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,630
I'm gonna be late!

451
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,038
He rushed
to Columbia University

452
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,599
to lead a demonstration
against the troops.

453
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,738
- What's a demonstration?
- Well, in this case,

454
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,750
it's when students show how much they
don't know by repeating it loudly.

455
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,083
Peace, yes! Recruiters, no!

456
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,181
Peace, yes! Recruiters, no!
Peace, yes! Recruiters, no!

457
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,123
Peace, yes! Recruiters, no!

458
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,956
Peace, yes! Recruiters, no!

459
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,586
Peace, yes, recruiters, no!

460
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,894
There is nothing more important
than stopping war!

461
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,492
No more wars! No more wars!

462
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:08,164
Because instead of fighting,
we should talk to our enemies!

463
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,140
Talk, don't fight! Talk, don't fight!

464
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:14,804
Right! Right! Don't believe
the government lies!

465
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,348
Don't believe lies! Don't believe lies!

466
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,680
Good... good.
That's good chanting. Good.

467
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:24,620
There is no terrorist threat!
The government just wants to...

468
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,317
The government just wants!
The government just wants!

469
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:31,158
That doesn't make any sense.
Please hang on a second. Please, OK?

470
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,126
The government is exaggerating
the terrorist threat

471
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,997
for its own nefarious purposes!

472
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:40,697
What does nefarious mean?
What does nefarious mean?

473
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:44,230
Well, you know, it means...
just hang on a second.

474
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,107
Can we just stop chanting, please?

475
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:50,306
- Stop, don't chant! Stop, don't...
- Will you shut up?!

476
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,509
Just shut up for a second!

477
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:57,317
OK, uh... can we just try
to listen for a minute

478
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,856
without the chanting?

479
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,188
OK, we have to stop...

480
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,727
Hey! Free history term papers!

481
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,206
Ooh, thanks a lot.

482
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,674
That got a little wild.

483
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,871
Hey, who are you?
Army recruitin' senior citizens?

484
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,417
Hey!

485
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:31,786
That's "Hey, sir", maggot.
I am General George S. Patton.

486
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,483
That explains the slapping.

487
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,220
You're General George Patton,
from the movie?

488
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:42,130
No. From the United States Army,
back when this country was winning wars.

489
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,192
Oh, my God, JFK.

490
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,071
"You will be visited by three..."
Hey! What's with all the slapping?

491
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,575
It's my trademark.

492
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:55,636
Well, maybe you ought
to try a baseball cap.

493
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,238
No more war!

494
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,907
No more war!

495
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,281
No more war!

496
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:03,048
- Hey, where am I?
- No more war!

497
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,282
We pledge ourselves!

498
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:09,623
We will not support the United States
in any war!

499
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,685
Right on, sister.

500
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:15,096
- So, what's goin' on here?
- Damn peace demonstration.

501
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:18,795
Just like yours, only this is 1940.
They don't want us to fight Hitler.

502
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,566
- So they can't see us.
- Right.

503
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,130
Hmm.

504
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,233
This is gonna be harder than I thought.

505
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,437
I'm startin' to notice a pattern here.

506
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:30,845
- Anyway, this never happened!
- This absolutely happened.

507
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:35,147
Well, they're pacifists. They understand
war doesn't solve problems.

508
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,348
The only way is to sign
agreements like civilized people,

509
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:42,325
- not like sadistic movie generals.
- That general you saw was an actor!

510
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,919
I'll show you what
the real Patton was up against!

511
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,394
OK, where are we now?
Who's the guy dressed as a butler?

512
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,460
Germany, September, 1938.

513
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:57,133
That's Neville Chamberlain,
weak-assed prime minister of England.

514
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,006
Shh. He's gettin' a signed agreement.

515
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:03,377
Right. This gives you
all the Sudetenland,

516
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,349
Austria, and a couple countries
I can't pronounce.

517
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,318
And we'll throw in Czechoslovakia.

518
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,753
So that's C A, no. T...

519
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,290
Let's make it Poland.

520
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,156
The important thing is we now have hope.

521
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,025
See? He stands for what's important.

522
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,224
Does that look like standing to you?

523
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,235
- There. How's that?
- You missed a spot.

524
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:28,830
Hey! Don't you see these guys
are playin' you for a fool?

525
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:33,671
- War is not the answer.
- You wimpy little bastard!

526
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,543
You're givin' this Nazi everything
and gettin' nothin' in return!

527
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:39,014
Not nothing. We get peace.

528
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,978
And a damn fine cup of tea.

529
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,356
Und we'll name
a concentration camp after you.

530
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,396
Think of it...
Camp Auschwitz Chamberlain.

531
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,522
Lovely.

532
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,466
Hang on. I'm good at this.

533
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,502
Mr. Herr President,

534
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,733
obviously America's done
something wrong to make you

535
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,274
want to invade these countries
and kill innocent people.

536
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:08,176
- I'm just as frustrated as you.
- Excuse me, Fuhrer...

537
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,476
May I have a word?

538
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:14,416
Hang on. America keeps doing things
to piss off the rest of the world.

539
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,783
We bring it on ourselves.

540
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:19,085
What do we do to address
your understandable grievances?

541
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,057
How about carbon emission credits?

542
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,594
That'll offset your need to invade
France...

543
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,088
I don't know,
but I been told,

544
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,099
kill some Jews and take their gold.

545
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:33,126
Third floor. Right. Sorry.

546
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:36,264
They really should add flying
to the things we can do.

547
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:40,209
My point is talking to evil dictators
gets you nothing.

548
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,212
You know one thing they understand?

549
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,771
I'm guessing some sort
of physical violence.

550
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:48,182
- Strength. That's the only thing.
- Right. I'll remember that.

551
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,881
Is there anything you think
is worth fighting for?

552
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,789
Well, I'd kill to do a feature.
Now, can we please just go home?

553
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,351
Sure thing. Right home.
Cigar?

554
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:02,058
And support the imperialist
big business tobacco lobby? Never.

555
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,157
It's Cuban.

556
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:07,227
Hmm... I guess I can make an exception.

557
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:11,071
Takes me back.

558
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,370
What the hell is this?

559
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:16,106
- Your home. Maloneville, Alabama.
- I live in Alabama?

560
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:19,844
Didn't you hear? Around 1860,
all the good jobs started to move south.

561
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,011
- After the Civil War?
- There was no war.

562
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,577
Lincoln agreed with you.
War was not the answer.

563
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,454
- Saved 600,000 American lives.
- Well, that's good.

564
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,857
Good move for the economy here, too.

565
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,362
- What? Why?
- Cheap labor.

566
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,194
Mass'a Malone! Mass'a Malone!

567
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,894
I had the boys polish your trophies
like you told us.

568
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,436
Polish my trophies?

569
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,734
I ain't know they
gave awards for a documentary.

570
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:45,264
You know, for your information...
Wait! Who are these people?

571
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,811
You're the biggest
slave owner in the state.

572
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,006
Mass'a Malone, you ain't recognized me?

573
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,207
I's Rastus.

574
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:54,080
What? Oh, this can't be happening.

575
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,780
Hey, isn't that...

576
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,147
Yeah, that's him, all right.

577
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,318
Don't you worry, mass'a Malone.

578
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:05,055
We got them bacon stains
out of the upholstery.

579
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:08,292
It's a good thing ol' Mr. Lincoln
never fought no wars.

580
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:13,326
.. look, uh, Rastus,
you know this isn't real, right?

581
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:16,805
Whatever you say, mass'a.
Whatever you say, I guess this old ni...

582
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,672
No! Don't! Stop! Don't say that.

583
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:21,177
Mass'a Malone!
Mass'a Malone! Good news!

584
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:24,875
Productivity is through the roof since
you sold Daddy and the old folks!

585
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,042
Now we can buy us
about 20 new bucks

586
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:28,949
and start pickin' some cotton!

587
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:35,257
Rastus, tell me, how does old
mass'a Malone treat his slaves?

588
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,794
Mass'a Malone is the bestest,

589
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:41,025
most kindliest mass'a
a slave could have.

590
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,795
Oh, he don't beat us
unless we awful bad.

591
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,962
And he don't sell the li'I children
until they 6 months old.

592
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,029
No, no, no! I...

593
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:53,840
Mass'a, don't beat me! I ain't healed
from the beatin' you gave me yesterday!

594
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,745
No, I wasn't gonna be...
Can you make them stop?

595
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,042
Look, here, y'all!

596
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:01,608
Mass'a don't want to hear slave shit!
Kick somethin' into 4l4!

597
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,710
1, 2, 3, 4.

598
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,197
I gotta get out of here!

599
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,362
All right, mass'a leavin'.
Everybody wave goodbye.

600
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,839
- Hope you can buy some more of us.
- We sure could use a baritone.

601
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,466
Bye, Daddy.

602
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,636
Bye, Daddy!

603
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:30,078
- Bye, Daddy!
- Bye, Daddy!

604
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,749
- Aw, that was sick.
- Not as sick as slavery.

605
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:40,619
Lincoln is revered now
for fighting that war.

606
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,154
Hey, you would know.

607
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:46,458
Those rumors about Lincoln bein' gay.

608
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,158
Why don't I just shoot you now?

609
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,166
Well, maybe he just had
a wide stance.

610
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,065
Hang on. I gotta take this. Hello!

611
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,763
Michael? Where are you?

612
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:57,535
- Oh, I'm in, uh, D.C.
- Yeah, right. Wherever you are,

613
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:00,236
you're supposed to be
at Columbia in the morning.

614
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,676
I know. Of course.

615
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,044
Jane... Hello? Hello? Jane?

616
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:09,951
- Damn cell phones.
- Here. Use mine.

617
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,189
But do your minutes roll over
to the next month?

618
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,247
Course they do.

619
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,727
- But do you get unlimited texting?
- You think I was born yesterday?

620
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,860
Your people.

621
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,492
Yep, the students love me.

622
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,469
Love you? They don't even know you.

623
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:27,799
You're unique.

624
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,102
A liberal director
who can't even get laid

625
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,836
at the University
Peace Studies Department.

626
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,004
- They flock to my movies.
- They flock to slasher movies.

627
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,742
They go to your movies
'cause professors tell them to.

628
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:42,217
This is where they get information
to support the peace movement.

629
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:45,449
- It's called education.
- It's called indoctrination.

630
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:49,357
The American flag is a symbol
of oppression all over the world.

631
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,554
July 4th is a despicable celebration.

632
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,530
I know that look.
You're gonna try to teach me somethin'.

633
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,897
Where we gonna go now, back in time?

634
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,459
We don't have to. We're at a university.

635
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,031
Two, three, four.

636
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,581
Are you kidding? A musical number?

637
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,145
A little entertainment.

638
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,388
What kind of a soldier are you?

639
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,827
Startin' to understand
the boots and the whip.

640
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,871
Hey, what are you doin' with our kids?

641
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,050
What do your parents
think you're doin' here?

642
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,521
They're just happy to
have us out of the house.

643
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,582
Wanna hear what you're
spending your life savings on?

644
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,560
- I gave up an ass lift for this?
- Take a look!

645
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:12,264
- So, what do you think now?
- I'm still against torture.

646
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,702
OK, so they're
a little behind the times.

647
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:18,230
It doesn't make it OK for you to
embarrass those great professors.

648
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,277
Doin' a good job
of that themselves.

649
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,209
They're only tryin'
to bring peace.

650
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,875
By indoctrinating an entire generation
to hate its own country.

651
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,542
Well, they teach math, too.

652
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:32,255
When was it in your life
that you went so completely wrong?

653
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,881
Was it in college?

654
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:34,982
Before that?

655
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,151
Was it a girl?

656
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,294
- Michael!
- Molly!

657
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:50,231
Molly, I'm off to save the world,
but I'll be back.

658
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:53,368
Oh, Michael, war is
such a terrible thing.

659
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:54,536
I know, Molly.

660
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,773
That's why I'm going off
to film school.

661
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:58,712
Film school?

662
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,547
Yes. No sacrifice too great.

663
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,246
You'll wait for me of course?

664
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,312
Sure. Or course.

665
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,981
Take your time.

666
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,625
But she didn't wait, did she?

667
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,930
She tried, but I was gone so long.

668
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:21,028
Long? You were kicked out
in the first semester.

669
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,432
Coming!

670
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,012
- Molly.
- Marty!

671
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,554
Oh, my God!

672
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,148
This can't be happening!

673
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,487
My best friend?

674
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,723
We fell in love while you were gone.

675
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,264
No! I mean, he's in the army!

676
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,857
How terrible! You got drafted!

677
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,527
No, Michael. I enlisted.

678
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,195
I want to serve my country.

679
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,537
How could you want to serve
the corrupt American war machine?

680
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,076
- Molly.
- Marty.

681
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:03,511
I just love men in uniform.

682
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,947
Oh, shoot.

683
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,320
You know, that uniform
always worked for me, too.

684
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,751
So, you remember what happened next.

685
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,852
Yeah, my first film.
A daring expose on something...

686
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,396
She did the astronaut, too?

687
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,261
And the entire crew of the shuttle.

688
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:38,604
Well, general, enjoyed this
cruel little side trip, thank you,

689
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,810
but I have an interview in 20 minutes.

690
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,785
Don't worry, kid.

691
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,844
Things are gonna get a lot worse.

692
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:54,257
The demonstration is outside
the Madison Square Garden.

693
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:58,393
We need to get into artists' entrance
where there are no metal detectors.

694
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,461
Well, for that, we will need
all-access media passes.

695
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:02,528
Exactly.

696
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,166
You must get these from director Malone.

697
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,870
He can get them.
He's a documentary filmmaker.

698
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:12,405
Wait. You got us
a documentary filmmaker?

699
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:15,611
Yes, but, leader,
he gets to go everywhere

700
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,711
so he can document his hate of America.

701
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:20,916
Where would they give all-access passes
to someone like that?

702
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,481
- America!
- America!

703
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,896
- Ahmed? Mohammed?
- Oh, uh, director Akbar.

704
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:32,993
- What are you doin' here?
- We are here to watch your interview.

705
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,267
- And talk about the movie.
- Oh, yeah.

706
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,069
Who's Mister Happy?

707
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:41,202
Oh, him? Aziz is an actor.

708
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,608
Well, he's also our contact
to the foreign investors.

709
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:49,278
.. Aziz, my man.
Wonderful to meet you.

710
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:53,722
You know, for financing a movie, you can
get an associate producer credit.

711
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:57,454
Oh, holdin' out for executive producer.
Too clever for me.

712
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,621
You must have been killer sellin' rugs.

713
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,096
OK, we'll negotiate.

714
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,360
How about joinin' me
for the interview?

715
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:07,632
- No, no, no, he can't be on TV.
- I am here illegally.

716
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,367
Mohammed and Ahmed have visas,
but I could not.

717
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,170
Yes, he was on some kind of list.

718
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:18,113
I came through Mexico...
with some friends.

719
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,274
Great, great.

720
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,215
Good thing that fence isn't up yet.

721
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,480
This country was built by immigrants.

722
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,751
No matter. We'll get you
a nice cameo in the movie.

723
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,918
Have to shave, though.
You look like a terrorist.

724
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,597
Help me! I'm on fire!

725
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,261
Bam!

726
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:41,565
Hey, a bomb went off!

727
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,741
So what's the next step?
Financing in place?

728
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:48,801
Yes.

729
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,904
But before the money is committed,

730
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,347
I'll need media passes
to your demonstration.

731
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,441
Media passes?

732
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,919
Well, uh, he wants to hear
the great director speak.

733
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:01,856
Oh, yes, all right.
We can arrange that.

734
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:05,418
Be good to have you there,
show that everybody's against violence.

735
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:08,624
Especially jihadists.

736
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,790
What?

737
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,201
We need to treat all cultures equally.

738
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,899
Everyone is equal.

739
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,501
Oh, damn. A thread.
Right before the interview.

740
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:21,875
Allow me.

741
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,984
Oh, thanks there, Ali Baba.

742
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,846
Hi. I'm Bill O'Reilly.
Thanks for watching.

743
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,790
Tonight's special segment is July 4th.

744
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,296
Now, most folks will be celebrating
by going to a barbecue,

745
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,388
a parade, or here in New York City,

746
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:45,697
to a Madison Square Garden
country music concert for the troops.

747
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,602
But my guests tonight
have different plans.

748
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,163
Michael Malone is
planning a demonstration

749
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:54,541
- to abolish the Fourth of July.
- Hi, Bill.

750
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:58,810
And there are always fireworks with
TV personality Rosie O'Connell.

751
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,043
Good to be here, Bill.

752
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:03,883
Rosie's gonna show us a clip from her
documentary, but first, Mr. Malone,

753
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:07,481
you're demonstrating against
the troops on Independence Day?

754
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:08,616
Come on.

755
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,092
It's not against the troops.
It's against...

756
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:14,858
Look, we support the troops.
We just don't want them to kill anyone.

757
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,628
What? Don't you realize
that these troops

758
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,398
are the only ones standing between
radical Islam and innocent people?

759
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:22,769
Bill, there you go.

760
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,400
You think all terrorists
are radical Islamists.

761
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,704
That's profiling.

762
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:30,042
Radical Christianity
is as threatening as radical Islam.

763
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,844
- I don't think she means...
- It's exactly what I mean!

764
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,043
You can't be serious.

765
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:37,554
I'm serious and Michael agrees with me.
Let's roll the clip.

766
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:39,521
All right, roll it.

767
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,457
The civilized
world braces itself

768
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:45,188
for an onslaught of
death and destruction

769
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,560
brought on by radical Christians

770
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:51,863
as they attempt to spread their ideology
through terror throughout the world.

771
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,442
Praise Jesus!

772
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,209
Hail Mary full of grace!

773
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:08,115
Look out! It's those Christians!

774
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,949
72 virgins, here I come!

775
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,648
We all pay the price

776
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:16,090
for the increased security needs
caused by the actions

777
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,525
of radical Christians.

778
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,120
I hate having to take these off
every time.

779
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,791
Yeah. Ever since
that Christian hid explosives

780
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,231
in the bottom of his shoes.

781
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:27,031
You can't take this on.
I'll have to confiscate it.

782
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,093
Toothpaste?

783
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:31,005
No liquids since the Christians
tried to bomb that plane

784
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,135
with smuggled nitroglycerine
and let me take this as well.

785
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,942
- Please remove all underclothing.
- Oh, brother.

786
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:42,577
- Ever since the underwear bomber.
- The Christian underwear bomber.

787
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:46,054
All items of underclothing
must be placed in the trays.

788
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,351
Damn those Christians.

789
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:49,756
- Yipes!
- My God!

790
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:53,126
If you add extra bleach,
you might get those stains out.

791
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,427
- Hey!
- Have you considered a change in diet?

792
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:57,797
- What?
- Honey? Wouldn't hurt.

793
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,629
Ever since the suppository bomber...

794
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,901
The Episcopal suppository bomber.

795
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:10,808
That's not a documentary.
That's The Flintstones.

796
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:14,681
Bill, using reenactments to prove points
is a sign of a great documentary.

797
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,549
That's what we do. Right, Michael?

798
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,056
Bill, you wouldn't get that,
because you're a close-minded bigot!

799
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:23,855
Actually, Rosie, I'm thinkin'
your masterpiece may win some awards.

800
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:27,328
Let's start it off with enshrining you
in the Pinhead Hall of Fame.

801
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:28,558
Keep it up, Bill.

802
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:31,294
We wouldn't be at war at all
if we didn't overreact

803
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:32,858
to that phony 9l11 attack.

804
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:35,700
You can't be serious.
I rest my case.

805
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,333
Can we talk about
the Anti-War demonstration?

806
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:41,708
You think those towers were brought down
by planes? No, explosives.

807
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,873
- Malone.
- That's simply idiotic. No sane...

808
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,348
It's the first time
fire ever melted steel!

809
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:50,876
Rosie, I've heard that claim.
It's only made by complete morons.

810
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:52,819
Now, Bill, our demonstration...

811
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,916
Don't call me names.
We weren't even invaded by a nation!

812
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,426
She's a little far out.

813
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,519
Here's a news flash for you, Malone.

814
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,156
Your movies may not be
as crazy as Rosie's,

815
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:06,328
but yours are more dangerous because
some idiots believe what you say.

816
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:07,768
Because I tell the truth!

817
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,534
Because you tell the audience
what it wants to hear.

818
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,268
At least nobody believes Rosie.

819
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:15,072
You didn't even believe
that Elvis is still alive.

820
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,238
Or that we never landed on the Moon.

821
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:20,750
I'm gonna take both and
put 'em into my next documentary.

822
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:24,447
Well, that concludes this look
at the moderate left.

823
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:28,184
Next week, we'll be looking at
the crazies who populate the fringe.

824
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,188
Mr. Malone?

825
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:35,527
Mr. Malone?

826
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,759
Mr. Malone?

827
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,495
Grandpa? Grandpa!

828
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,627
What?

829
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,136
A Mr. Mohammed called.

830
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,537
Something about not being
late for rehearsal?

831
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:45,472
Heather, I still have plenty of...

832
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:46,566
A rehearsal?!

833
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,077
How could you be part
of the evil military

834
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:52,411
and kill my brothers and sisters
who are defending their country?

835
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:56,817
Yusef, there are no straight men left.
Girls like me have to join the army.

836
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,684
Yes, that's why I joined.

837
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,190
She reads the lines
with such conviction.

838
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,716
Yes. This is so much better
than building pipe bombs.

839
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,023
What are you doing?

840
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,724
W had to start rehearsals.
We have no time to waste.

841
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,426
But we haven't even...

842
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:14,062
Say no to the army, run away
to France where they have real men.

843
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,538
No. The recruiters
kidnap us off the street,

844
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,576
talk to us for hours
until we finally agree to sign up.

845
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:20,803
Like Scientology.

846
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:23,870
I'll ask the great leader
Osama for us to stay together.

847
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,505
I didn't write that.

848
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:28,278
- To stay together.
- Please. Director Akbar!

849
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,411
For us to stay together...

850
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,751
Is this a real sword?

851
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,051
Yes. Be careful.

852
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,024
Oh, my God.

853
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,220
I will ask the great leader Osama.

854
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,820
She's an infidel. Cut off her head.

855
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,958
And cut off her balls, too!

856
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,662
- Yaah! Come back here!
- No! Not me! Kill her!

857
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:48,932
- Death to the uncircumcised!
- Asshole!

858
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,338
- This sword is heavy!
- Just one second.

859
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:52,602
Give him more lines.

860
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:55,440
- Hey, isn't that?
- Yes, actor Akbar.

861
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:57,139
Revered by all Americans.

862
00:46:57,214 --> 00:47:01,776
This isn't that kind of movie. This is
serious, for adults. Not entertainment.

863
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:04,685
- He will be hard to replace.
- There is no replacing!

864
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:08,350
This is about militants being
held at Guantanamo without a lawyer!

865
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:10,791
Meryl Streep already did that!

866
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,921
What about the Marine who rapes
and murders an Iraqi family?

867
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,794
Brian De Palma, straight to video.

868
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,300
Lawyer who fights wiretapping.

869
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:19,357
Robert Redford.

870
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,404
Soldier who's forced
to go back to Iraq!

871
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,666
- Has an Oscar buzz.
- I want to see that!

872
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,038
- We'll see it Friday.
- It's a date.

873
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:30,971
I know. All the really great
anti-American films have been done.

874
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:33,573
No way we can compete
with Hollywood studios.

875
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,084
Michael Malone?
What are you doing here?

876
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:40,453
- I'm directing this picture.
- What? I don't do documentaries.

877
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,960
- Malone! We're under attack!
- Now what?

878
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,662
Come on!

879
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,295
I don't see an attack.

880
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,273
- A gun? I don't...
- Fine. I know. Talk, don't shoot.

881
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,038
Think of that as a talkin' stick.
Let's go, men!

882
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:04,376
- Where are we going?!
- Don't step in that!

883
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,380
What's going on?!

884
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:12,183
Sons of bitches!
Get the hell out of this courtroom!

885
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:16,022
- Stop! You can't just shoot people!
- They're not people! They're the ACLU!

886
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:17,924
What?! You still can't...

887
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:28,201
Fire at will, boys!

888
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,372
What's goin' on here?

889
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:34,103
ACLU. They come around
every now and then.

890
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,372
No listenin' in on terrorists' calls.

891
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,937
Be nice to Al Qaeda.
Read 'em their rights.

892
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,476
Separation of church and state.

893
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,620
I'll tell you one thing about
the undead. They are relentless.

894
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:52,052
Gun control. That gets 'em
a little riled up, too.

895
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:56,394
I think we could use
gun control right about now!

896
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:57,933
Tell it to them.

897
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:02,795
Try it. It's fun.

898
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,269
Try not to lead 'em so much next time.

899
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:15,047
What we're tryin' to do here, son,
is protect the Ten Commandments.

900
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,415
There's still five left.

901
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:20,252
Hey, judge!
Is the "not killing" still up there?

902
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,552
Aw, screw it!

903
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:26,255
Guns are not the answer!

904
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,231
Nice shot.

905
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,994
Oh, my God, what have I done?

906
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,502
The first one's always the best.

907
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:42,575
OK, OK, give me that thing.

908
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,473
I bet they heard that.

909
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:50,714
Come on! They're on the subway!

910
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,379
Godspeed, General!

911
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,630
I'll need to see your bag, please.

912
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,167
This says we can't search their bags.

913
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,483
Thank Allah for the ACLU.

914
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,781
Now you are going to
see the glory of jihad.

915
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,550
They're going to fly
a subway into a building?

916
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:33,729
Subway into a building... hmm.

917
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:37,460
Well, now you've gone too far!
You're against privacy rights, too?

918
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,094
Only when they interfere
with survival rights.

919
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,844
Enjoy your privacy rights in hell.

920
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:55,083
The Patriot Act is spoiling everything.

921
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,450
I can't believe
I lent Fayed my backpack.

922
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,384
Sir, we are ready to do our duty.

923
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,362
Your job is to pick up
the three all-access media passes

924
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,490
from the infidel director.

925
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:13,002
As America watches that concert on TV,

926
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,595
they will see the power of jihad.

927
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:18,232
You are going to blow up
Madison Square Garden?

928
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:19,707
When that roof collapses

929
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,506
on 20,000 American soldiers
and their families,

930
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,980
we will be held as martyrs
throughout the Arab world.

931
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,415
But we will be dead.

932
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,550
Yes.

933
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:35,785
Isn't there like a remote control
or a button or something?

934
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:39,351
Leader, we get the passes for it
from the director Akbar.

935
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,487
Very good.

936
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,828
I'm gonna grab a knish.

937
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:44,628
Your families will be proud.

938
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,934
Is there nothing we can do?

939
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:53,066
Nothing. The plan is foolproof.

940
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:08,150
Enough already. It's not as if I'm
against Santa Claus or the Boy Scouts.

941
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,351
Little tip for you.

942
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,087
Fascist uniforms, not cool.

943
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,527
- Or religion.
- Or the Fourth of July?

944
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:16,862
Fourth of July? That reminds me.
I got a demonstration. See ya.

945
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,359
You're leavin'?

946
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:22,030
Yep. End of the line for me,
so conjure up some fog

947
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:25,506
- and get me the hell out of here.
- Just go. This is real.

948
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:26,667
Are you sure?

949
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:28,540
That subway station was too clean.

950
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:29,977
.. unh!

951
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:41,856
That's the real America.

952
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:45,588
Proud to celebrate the Fourth of July,
just like your own family.

953
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:49,223
This is my own family.

954
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,960
Oh, right. So it is.

955
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:52,524
Hey, do I smell burgers?

956
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:56,295
I made your favorite, sweet potatoes.

957
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:57,738
Aw, honey, you know,

958
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:00,332
what I think I'm gonna miss most
is your cooking.

959
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,970
Not my kisses?

960
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,781
Should I set a place
for Uncle Michael?

961
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,114
Oh, no, honey.
Uncle Michael's still very busy.

962
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,313
I feel bad he keeps
disappointing you.

963
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:14,050
Well, he'll come around.

964
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:18,083
- God bless us, everyone.
- There he is, my gentle little Timmy.

965
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,891
What a beautiful day
for a family picnic.

966
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,057
Hey, Timmy, ready for dessert?

967
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:26,660
Daddy, is your asshole
uncle coming tonight?

968
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:27,896
Uh, well...

969
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,804
Uh, Timmy, you know
Uncle Michael loves you.

970
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,172
That lard ass only loves himself.

971
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:35,438
Did he come up with
money for my operation?

972
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,036
Uh, well, uh...

973
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:40,173
Documentaries don't actually
pay enough to, uh...

974
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,879
- Daddy!
- Beckah. Hi, sweetheart.

975
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:48,152
I see that Michael "I'm gonna get
you a cornea transplant" Malone

976
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,556
stiffed you again.

977
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:52,424
Uh, honey, he's doin' everything he can.

978
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:56,488
I bet he spent time in the cornea market
at the Cannes Film Festival.

979
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:57,624
Oh, good!

980
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,999
The boys have brought out Tiny Tina.

981
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,062
She's doing so much better
on that new dialysis machine.

982
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:04,128
Hey, kids!

983
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:07,870
I don't suppose Uncle Jerkwad
has showed up with the kidney.

984
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,378
I'm running a little short on time here.

985
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,177
Come on!

986
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,981
Now, can't we go on
to some other awful place?

987
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:20,522
- Where the hell are we?
- Kandahar, Afghanistan.

988
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,490
But there's a war going on here!

989
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,026
- Since 9l11!
- Down!

990
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,221
- Down!
- They shouldn't be blindfolded.

991
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:29,163
- It's against the Geneva Convention.
- They're the enemy.

992
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:32,827
- They're innocent till proven guilty.
- Let me tell you something.

993
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:36,531
If they're on the battlefield
and shooting at you, they're guilty!

994
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,369
That's not the point.

995
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,739
There's no reason
to blindfold prisoners.

996
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,677
Fine. Take 'em off.

997
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:49,044
Michael Malone! Michael Malone!

998
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,314
Die You American Pigs!

999
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,912
He's much fatter in person.

1000
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,047
OK, OK.

1001
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,560
Let's see how fat I look
with one of these blindfolds back on.

1002
00:54:58,728 --> 00:54:59,990
Aah aah aah!

1003
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,896
...for my God
is with me wherever I go.

1004
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,866
Have mercy upon me, O God,

1005
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:07,300
for it is an unfailing love.

1006
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,429
Praise be to the Lord, my rock,

1007
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:12,475
who trains my hands for war,
my fingers for battle.

1008
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,134
We're taking fire!

1009
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,853
They're using real bullets!

1010
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,327
Honestly,
I've tried to show him,

1011
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:42,235
but this one is just too bullheaded.

1012
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,170
Father, please forgive me.

1013
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,798
I have done my best.

1014
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,776
This challenge was just too much.

1015
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,939
I fear this battle is lost.

1016
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,609
Oh, so now you're telling God?

1017
00:55:57,987 --> 00:55:59,477
Not that father.

1018
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:03,683
You know, JFK was right.
You are hopeless.

1019
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:12,301
What?! Oh, George Washington.

1020
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:16,066
Been dead for 200 years,
not that that matters anymore.

1021
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:19,006
It does matter, citizen Malone.

1022
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:23,034
Nice costume.
You here for the Halloween parade?

1023
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:27,214
I'm here to talk to you about freedom.

1024
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:30,684
- The greatest gift man has.
- Freedom?

1025
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:33,655
Very precarious gift, easily misused.

1026
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:37,352
And when it is misused, easily lost.

1027
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:41,092
Like freedom from pompous spirits.

1028
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:43,598
Like freedom of speech, which you abuse.

1029
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,065
Like freedom of religion.

1030
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:48,434
This is St. Paul's Chapel,
where I worshipped every Sunday...

1031
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:51,406
...when New York was the capital.

1032
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,044
I sat right here
on the morning of my inaugural

1033
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,511
to pray for guidance
in leading this nation.

1034
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,881
If this place is so important,
why don't they clean it?

1035
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:07,085
- It's full of...
- Dust.

1036
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,815
From across the street.

1037
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:16,794
Oh, my God.

1038
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:19,130
It was the World Trade Center,

1039
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:23,366
and this is the dust
of 3,000 innocent human beings

1040
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,739
and the great heroes who perished
trying to save them.

1041
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,072
Why'd you bring me here?

1042
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:29,805
I'm not responsible for this.

1043
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,574
It was our foreign policy.

1044
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,707
It's our military bases overseas.

1045
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,013
It's globalization. It's the CIA!

1046
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,485
Is that what you're
gonna say on judgment day?

1047
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:41,649
Well, I've already been judged,
and I won an Oscar.

1048
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:44,158
For a documentary.

1049
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:51,792
When you meet the Almighty, Michael,
I'm afraid that won't do.

1050
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:56,999
Only the truth will do.

1051
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:58,267
I gotta get out of here.

1052
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,090
No! No!

1053
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,092
No! No!

1054
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:23,491
Don't hurt me!
I've always stood up for gay rights.

1055
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:27,929
I'm the Angel of freakin' Death,
you turdhead.

1056
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:32,600
Boy, you do not wanna mess
with the Angel of Death.

1057
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:36,372
Listen, punk, there are consequences
for what you do.

1058
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:38,004
Let's go.

1059
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:40,711
Oh, good, another field trip.

1060
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:44,184
Can we go someplace cool this time,
like Paris or Hollywood?

1061
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:45,846
Now, that's a good idea.

1062
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:50,124
What's goin' on here?
Where are we?

1063
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:54,391
Hollywood, just like you wanted,
only now it's called Bin Laden City.

1064
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,692
Oh, my God.

1065
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:58,199
They kept the buildings.
Just changed the signs.

1066
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,828
Oh, no!
This isn't happening!

1067
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:03,464
We lost the war on terror.
Nice work.

1068
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,168
Great bunch of movies
you made for the other side.

1069
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:08,972
Oh, shit.

1070
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,707
Yeah. Terrorists really
appreciated your work.

1071
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:16,275
Take me home.

1072
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,876
My real home.

1073
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:20,889
That's where we're goin'.
Back to Michigan.

1074
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:26,687
Ah, home.

1075
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:29,155
Detroit!

1076
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:35,528
This is all that's left?

1077
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:38,768
Not much to work with,
but if we put our heads together...

1078
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:41,275
We'll never be able
to identify this victim.

1079
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:42,606
Why even bother?

1080
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,112
I mean, it's one of 100,000.

1081
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,740
What happened here?
100,000 people dead?

1082
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:47,840
Listen.

1083
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:51,353
The strange thing is
the blast only killed a few hundred.

1084
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,888
Radiation got the rest.

1085
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:56,153
Nuclear attack on Detroit?

1086
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:57,522
Oh, my God.

1087
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:01,257
We found this in the wreckage
of a television interview show.

1088
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:02,923
Some big-ass celebrity.

1089
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:04,626
You got that right.

1090
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,532
This was near it.

1091
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,933
Hey, that's Michael Malone's cap.

1092
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:12,599
That explains the fat ass.

1093
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:13,699
Check this out.

1094
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:16,301
There is no terrorist threat.

1095
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,614
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I just forgot to sign

1096
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:21,912
the please don't shoot
my ass off agreement.

1097
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,413
Do I look more
like Michael Malone now?

1098
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:28,320
Hey, spank my know-it-all ass.

1099
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,188
I know!

1100
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:35,458
Least everyone will be happy
now that I've been nuked!

1101
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,764
Don't let me die!
And all those people!

1102
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:41,997
I don't wanna die!
Please, I don't wanna die!

1103
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:48,269
I don't wanna die!
Please! I don't wanna die!

1104
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:49,971
Please! I don't wanna die.

1105
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:51,843
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.

1106
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:51,946
I don't wanna die. I don't
wanna die. I don't wanna die.

1107
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:55,144
I don't wanna die. I don't
wanna die. I don't wanna die.

1108
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,754
I didn't die. I'm alive!

1109
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,517
I'm here at Madison Square Garden

1110
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:05,254
where Moovealong. Org is holding
their Anti-Fourth-of-July rally.

1111
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,920
I didn't miss it!

1112
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,861
It wasn't a nightmare!

1113
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:11,798
Except for that creepy
George Washington guy.

1114
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:13,665
It's a beautiful day!

1115
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:16,637
They're all waiting
for their leader, Michael Malone.

1116
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,706
That's right, Michael Malone.

1117
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:22,176
I'm so f...

1118
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:28,348
Time to go.

1119
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:29,908
I can't. I'm... sick.

1120
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,783
You look terrible.

1121
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,515
But you always look terrible.

1122
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:36,456
Now come on.
Millions of people are counting on you.

1123
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,517
We love Michael Malone!

1124
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:39,788
We love Michael Malone!

1125
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,420
You gotta do the right thing.

1126
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:48,031
We don't care how!
Leave now! We don't care how!

1127
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:50,004
Leave now! We don't care how!

1128
01:01:58,581 --> 01:01:59,980
Director Akbar!

1129
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,481
Director Akbar, our
all-access media passes,

1130
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,987
you have them?

1131
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,421
Oh, yeah, uh,
enjoy the, uh, demonstration.

1132
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,721
- Thank you.
- Mr. Malone, Mr. Malone!

1133
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,556
What is your message to the troops

1134
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:14,994
who have come for
the Fourth of July concert?

1135
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,827
Uh... uh... uh...

1136
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,366
Give me that!

1137
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:21,835
We're not gonna celebrate a country
that sends soldiers to fight.

1138
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:25,305
That's what Michael is here to say.
Come on. Everyone's waiting.

1139
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:27,467
Introduce Jimmy Carter
and make a speech.

1140
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:30,876
- Bring troops home!
- Michael Malone will be here soon!

1141
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:33,313
Feel free to just wander on up here.

1142
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:35,646
And here's former
President Jimmy Carter!

1143
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,481
Israel is an apartheid state.

1144
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:40,886
Uh, high taxes are good for you.

1145
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:43,721
And after him,
Michael Malone is gonna be here!

1146
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:45,727
Uh, I gotta go to the bathroom.

1147
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,904
What am I gonna do?
They're gonna kill me!

1148
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:01,773
You spineless bastard, act like a man.

1149
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:04,369
Why'd you do that?
I was gonna do something.

1150
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,779
I just don't know what.

1151
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:10,341
You can't sit here on the sidelines.
It's time to take action.

1152
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:12,785
I'm considering
getting another hero.

1153
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:17,653
Hey! What are you doin' here?
You're not a spirit.

1154
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:20,355
I know. I just enjoy slapping you.

1155
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:21,919
Listen to yourself!

1156
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:25,695
The time has come to forget about
the consequences and show courage!

1157
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:27,292
You know what courage is?

1158
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,736
You mean, like the lion
in The Wizard Of Oz?

1159
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,574
I had a more heroic reference in mind,

1160
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,167
but if The Wizard Of Oz
works for you, well, OK.

1161
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:39,237
You know, is it possible for me
to get a little privacy in here?

1162
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,011
We are facing the greatest
evil since Nazism.

1163
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:44,245
What are you talking about?

1164
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,187
To assure there will be no more war,
I've taken the liberty

1165
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:51,955
of arranging a formal surrender ceremony
on the U.S.S. Missouri.

1166
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,865
OK, stop! I'll do it.

1167
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:10,945
Thank you, thank you.

1168
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:14,141
Oh, look, here he is now,

1169
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:16,117
a true heavyweight of the movement,

1170
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,915
our brother, Michael Malone!

1171
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:21,388
.. whoo.

1172
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:23,755
Ah, thank you. Thank you.

1173
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:26,021
Uh, I know what you all
think is important.

1174
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,757
Government-run health care.

1175
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:32,165
Global warming.

1176
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:35,999
No handguns allowed in your home.

1177
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:40,935
And these things are all vital.

1178
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:46,577
But they all come second
to the most important thing of all.

1179
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:48,583
We're in a real war, people.

1180
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:50,642
These terrorists want to kill us all,

1181
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,086
and you're acting
like it's September 10th.

1182
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:58,120
Traitor!

1183
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:08,903
Where'd you get that?!

1184
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:20,180
Hang on a second!
Thanks, guys.

1185
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:23,582
Oh, please! I don't blame you
for wantin' to water-board me

1186
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:25,712
in a secret CIA prison,
but I've changed!

1187
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:29,053
- We're trying to protect you.
- Well, thank you for bein' here.

1188
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:32,458
Don't thank us. Thank the recruiter
that came to our campus.

1189
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:34,519
What? You guys went to college?

1190
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:41,701
And now, folks,
give a big New York City welcome to...

1191
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,762
...Whiskey Falls!

1192
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:49,975
Poor Aziz.

1193
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:52,810
He was supposed to wait
to detonate his bombs.

1194
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,213
What a wanker.

1195
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,751
Hey, let's get hot dogs
and go see the show.

1196
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:01,152
After we blow ourselves up.

1197
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:04,659
After the bombs go off,
I will personally kill you.

1198
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:07,093
I can live with that.

1199
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:18,231
Hey! Hey, it's that Michael Malone!

1200
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:19,831
Oh, hey!

1201
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,309
This is for people
who support our troops.

1202
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:25,245
You hate country music.
What are you doin' here?

1203
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,713
I had no choice.

1204
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:29,478
I was about to be beaten
by peace marchers!

1205
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,721
And now,
on the birthday of our nation,

1206
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:35,450
we're proud to introduce a man

1207
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:38,550
who has entertained troops
all over the world.

1208
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:43,564
Please welcome country music
superstar Trace Adkins!

1209
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,565
The Angel of Death is headlining?

1210
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:50,366
Hello, New York City!

1211
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,532
Director Akbar!

1212
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:54,576
Director Akbar!
Back here!

1213
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:56,634
I'm gonna get killed.

1214
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:58,077
I know. We all are.

1215
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:01,674
We have to tell you something.
Aziz is not an actor.

1216
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:04,117
- He's not?
- He's something else.

1217
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,483
Think back.

1218
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:11,558
You look like a terrorist.

1219
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:15,127
You are going to blow up
Madison Square Garden?

1220
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,825
Bawk, bawk, bawk!

1221
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:18,889
Bawk, bawk, bawk!

1222
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:22,395
Bawk, bawk, bawk!

1223
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:27,171
Wait! So you're saying he's a terrorist?

1224
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:31,444
- And that would make you...
- Filmmakers.

1225
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:32,811
Right!

1226
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:36,045
The "film" is set to go off at 7:00.

1227
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:43,552
We have to stop him.

1228
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:45,651
We'll never find him in this crowd.

1229
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:50,823
There's only one place
I can see everything. The stage.

1230
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,992
They hate you.

1231
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,036
They hated Stalin, too.

1232
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,832
Look for him out in the house.

1233
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,135
- Stalin?
- The mentor of Oprah.

1234
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:00,076
I wouldn't want
to be anywhere else.

1235
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:02,875
So come on, let's not waste
any more time.

1236
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:04,003
Let me hear you.

1237
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,207
Hey, Malone,
get off the stage!

1238
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:09,513
Get off the stage!

1239
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,179
- What's he doin' here!
- Well, uh...

1240
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:15,417
- What are you doin' here?!
- Damn it, where is he?

1241
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:18,949
Uh, you probably all hate me,
and I don't blame you.

1242
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,620
I said a lot of bad things.

1243
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:23,927
Uh, over the last few days,
I learned a lot of lessons.

1244
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:26,934
And now I know that terrorism
is not our fault!

1245
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:30,736
He's got to be
out there somewhere.

1246
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:35,539
And that, uh, we may not be perfect,
but we're the good guys!

1247
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:36,669
Yeah!

1248
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:40,681
I'm sorry about what I said about
country music, NASCAR, and Americans.

1249
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:43,650
If you want to listen to dumb songs

1250
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:45,380
About cowboys and trucks

1251
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:48,048
and watch cars endlessly
go around in circles.

1252
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,888
Hey, what... Hey, this is
the United States of America!

1253
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,155
We're free to do what we want!

1254
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:56,687
So if those of you who agree with me

1255
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:59,529
that America should be
destroyed, stand up now!

1256
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,530
Yes! Die, you American pigs!

1257
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:06,006
What?!

1258
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:08,236
There he is! The terrorist! Get him!

1259
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,137
We'll get him, director Akbar!

1260
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,879
Get him! Get him!

1261
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:28,686
- Aziz, don't do it!
- Allahu Akbar.

1262
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:29,822
- Wait!
- Wait!

1263
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,137
OK, now we must disarm the bomb.

1264
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:37,434
Then it's a good thing we're alert.

1265
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:42,836
- The red one!
- Which one's red? I'm color blind.

1266
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,402
We don't have time.

1267
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,040
I've never done this
in a restroom.

1268
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:50,279
Don't worry about it.
Just relax and pull it gently.

1269
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:51,478
Like that?

1270
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:53,815
Sailors.

1271
01:09:57,092 --> 01:10:00,289
Not that one!
Don't pull that one!

1272
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,660
Push harder! Put it in here.

1273
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:05,595
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
He's waking up!

1274
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,033
Do something!

1275
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,228
Look!

1276
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:14,204
- That was amazing.
- You're incredible.

1277
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:15,300
Marines.

1278
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:30,485
Director Akbar!
Director Akbar!

1279
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,857
Look! Look!

1280
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:41,069
Got anything else to say, son?

1281
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:45,264
Yeah! How about you rednecks
Play some of that awful country music!

1282
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:51,669
Welcome to the real America.

1283
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:55,882
You know, you look
much slimmer in person.

1284
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:55,710
New York City!

1285
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,037
There is mosh pit?

1286
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:00,013
Not in country music.

1287
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,285
Josh.

1288
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:28,968
Josh! Josh!

1289
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,474
Josh, Josh!

1290
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,278
Josh, Josh!

1291
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,376
Carry on.

1292
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:39,717
Daddy, look who's here.

1293
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:42,780
- Uncle Asshole!
- Josh!

1294
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,223
Josh!

1295
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:55,793
Can you forgive your stupid uncle
for being too blind to see

1296
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:58,362
what's been right in front of him
this whole time?

1297
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,533
Oh, nice! Blind jokes!

1298
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:03,100
Uncle Michael, it's OK.

1299
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:06,875
Well, I just want you to know
that I care about you, and...

1300
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:08,610
...I'm proud of what you're doin'.

1301
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:13,587
I always knew that, Uncle Michael.
I always knew it.

1302
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,614
Well, now you take care of yourself,

1303
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:19,627
'cause there's a lot
of bad people out there.

1304
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:23,791
It's OK. As long as there's
a lot of good people here.

1305
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,168
If there's anything I can do...

1306
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,206
Maybe I can send
some DVDs of my movies.

1307
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:32,638
That's all right.

1308
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:35,677
We captured a lot of them
when we took Saddam's palace.

1309
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:39,709
Besides, I think most
of the guys prefer features.

1310
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,318
But I'd really appreciate it

1311
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:46,445
if you could check in on Lily
and the kids while I'm gone.

1312
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:48,353
Yeah, I will. No problem.

1313
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,554
You've made Josh so happy.

1314
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:54,027
- Thanks, Jilly.
- Lily.

1315
01:13:57,332 --> 01:13:59,266
Welcome to the fight, Uncle Michael.

1316
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,302
This time I know our side will win.

1317
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:46,439
Help!

1318
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:51,209
Don't worry, Josh!

1319
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:53,481
I'll take care of the family!

1320
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,764
Thought I'd find you here.

1321
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:09,193
He's a good kid.
Persian Gulf, volunteered.

1322
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:12,104
I feel so useless.
What can I do?

1323
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,903
Well, you could start by being

1324
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:17,104
as big a pain in the ass to
the terrorists as you've been to us.

1325
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,943
Like makin' a movie
of the good things about America.

1326
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,142
In Hollywood? Fat chance.

1327
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:23,809
Sorry for bein' such a jerk.

1328
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:26,013
Sorry I made you listen
to country music.

1329
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:27,112
Ah, forget it.

1330
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,816
Hey, you want to grab a sandwich?

1331
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:31,655
I'd love to. Used to get
a good pastrami in Manhattan.

1332
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:35,128
Before you got t-boned by that car.
It was a spinal injury, right?

1333
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:37,597
Tough day.
Didn't see that comin'.

1334
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:40,294
What do you think
about stem cell research?

1335
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:43,202
Let's not go there.
A broken neck is a broken neck...

1336
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:46,298
From then on,
he always remembered to celebrate

1337
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,842
the Fourth of July,

1338
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:50,344
and he did what he could
to help out the soldiers.

1339
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:52,778
But most important, he devoted himself

1340
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:55,112
to spreading a message of his hero.

1341
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:57,348
My fellow Americans,

1342
01:15:57,419 --> 01:16:00,513
ask not what your country
can do for you,

1343
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:04,286
but rather, ask, uh...
Uh... line!

1344
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:07,385
You know, I don't think JFK
would say this like that.

1345
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:11,193
- It's become such a...
- "What you can do for your country!"

1346
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:14,758
Oh, cut!
What are we gonna do?

1347
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:17,430
Fire his ass.

1348
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:19,167
That's my boy.

1349
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,572
God bless us, everyone.

1350
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:22,940
And God bless America!

1351
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:26,174
And it turned out
people actually wanted to see movies

1352
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,341
that showed good things about America.

1353
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:31,045
- Grandpa!
- Oh, Grandpa, come on.

1354
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:34,611
Hey. It's just a story.

1355
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:37,486
My fellow Americans,

1356
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:39,959
ask not what your country
can do for you,

1357
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:43,259
but rather ask what you can do
for your country.

1358
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:45,499
Cut! Print!
