<i>You know that feeling</i>
<i>where no matter what you do</i>

2
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,752
<i>or where you go</i>
<i>you just don't fit in?</i>

3
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,623
<i>I don't know the word for that.</i>

4
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,788
<i>Alienation, estrangement...</i>

5
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,732
<i>incompatibility?</i>
<i>Naw, those ain't right.</i>

6
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:12,466
<i>But there's gotta be a word for it,</i>
<i>because that's how I feel all the time.</i>

7
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,963
<i>My name's Akeelah Anderson</i>
<i>and I'm 11 years old.</i>

8
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,240
<i>And this all starts</i>
<i>at Crenshaw Middle School</i>

9
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,577
<i>in South Los Angeles.</i>

10
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,527
You're all in the seventh grade now
and I know you can do better than this.

11
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:43,400
So when I give you
a list of words, study them.

12
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,301
Akeelah!

13
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,602
How long did you study
for this spelling test?

14
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,068
I didn't.

15
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:59,081
See me after class.
Okay, you two need to turn around.

16
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,314
Enough!

17
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,183
You know, you could be
one of my very best students.

18
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,353
But you don't turn in
half your homework.

19
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,692
Sometimes you don't even
show up for class.

20
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,130
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

21
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,369
Have you heard of...

22
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,301
have you heard
of next week's spelling bee?

23
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,277
No.

24
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,302
Well, I think you should
sign up for it.

25
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,750
Does he really think I'm
gonna be walking around

26
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,722
with somebody in little shorts
like that? He crazy!

27
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:41,284
- Ooh, is Devon coming back today?
- Yeah. Got a two-week leave.

28
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:45,161
Your brother is fine!
I got it all figured out... look.

29
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,792
He gonna be the pilot
on a big commercial jet

30
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,325
and I'm gonna be
the flight attendant.

31
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,930
Got any change
for an old man, girls?

32
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,872
Ain't got no change for myself.

33
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,006
Damn, Derrick-T's new ride is tight!

34
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,680
He's been trying to get
Terrence in trouble.

35
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,209
Girl, your bro can get
his own self in trouble.

36
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,916
- So what'd Ms. Cross want?
- Nothin'.

37
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,482
Just talking about
some stupid-ass spelling bee.

38
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,494
You gonna do it?

39
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,326
- You'd probably be good.
- And get up in front of everybody?

40
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,594
I'd probably pee in my pants.

41
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,434
Tell me about the boy in your class
with the itty-bitty shorts.

42
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,528
I think he's cute.

43
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,474
<i>Yes!</i>

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,151
Yes!

45
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,123
- Keelie, Mama says go eat.
- I'm about to get a high score.

46
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,591
- One minute.
- I don't care.

47
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,093
Mama says go eat!

48
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:51,324
Oh yeah! I've been dreaming about
your cooking for the past five months.

49
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,729
Let me take that.

50
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,325
At least I got one baby
appreciate what I do around here.

51
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,531
We all appreciate you.
Hey... give me some sugar.

52
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,233
- Where is Terrence?
- I don't know. Maybe still at practice.

53
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,435
Practice was over an hour ago.
I know one thing...

54
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,569
he better not be hanging out
with no Derrick-T.

55
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,580
Derrick-T?
That fool still alive?

56
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,946
- Not after you get done with him.
- That's right.

57
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,814
- Hey, you.
- So...

58
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,876
how many planes have you
shot down so far?

59
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,548
So far zero. But you don't do
too much shooting sitting behind

60
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,682
- a computer screen in Nevada.
- Oooh, good.

61
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,023
You stay on the ground.
Let them white boys go up there.

62
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,052
- You stay down here where you belong.
- Mama, I'm gonna have my wings

63
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,294
and my college degree before you know
it... unless this one beats me to it.

64
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,563
Not skipping class
with Georgia Cavanaugh, she won't.

65
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,162
- Skipping class?
- Only PE.

66
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,641
- You better not be skipping no class.
- Akeelah, go turn off that television.

67
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,973
Hey, hey... flip it over
to ESPN real quick

68
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,343
and let me check out
that Laker score, all right?

69
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,371
<i>I need you to talk to Terrence...</i>

70
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,849
<i>... no more poisonous</i>
<i>sprays, no more glue traps,</i>

71
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:48,115
and no more throwing your money away.
The scientific design of the...

72
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:51,817
If you spell the next word correctly,
you will be the champion.

73
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:55,089
- What's this?
- Akeelah, turn off the TV now.

74
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,824
<i>- "Brunneous."</i>
- B...

75
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:01,061
R-U-N...

76
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,467
N-E-O-U-S.

77
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,563
- Brunneous.
<i>- Congratulations.</i>

78
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,905
<i>You are the Scripps</i>
<i>National Spelling Bee Champion.</i>

79
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,969
Akeelah needs to listen!

80
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,004
Turn it off now!

81
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,143
Brunneous...

82
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,677
brunneous?

83
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,888
"Brunneous: dark brown;

84
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,624
used chiefly scientifically."

85
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,224
Well, why can't they just say brown?

86
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,269
Daddy, have you ever
heard of this word?

87
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,240
Yeah, probably did.

88
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,220
Cauterize, C-A-U-T-E-R-I-Z-E.

89
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:59,520
Fortification,
F-O-R-T-I-F-I-C-A-T-I-O-N.

90
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:03,757
Correspond,
C-O-R-R-E-S-P-O-N-D...

91
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:18,441
<i>... construction on our northeast lot,</i>

92
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,311
<i>traffic will be directed</i>
<i>to the side alley.</i>

93
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:25,408
<i>This will be through the month.</i>
<i>Drop-offs will be from the south gate.</i>

94
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,049
Hey, freak.

95
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,320
We want you to take care
of our English homework.

96
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,259
- Everybody say you a brainiac.
- I ain't no brainiac.

97
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:39,697
Like hell you ain't!
Always got them A's down, right?

98
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,461
Yeah, she's scared of us.

99
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,695
Don't run away...

100
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,704
I cannot thank you enough
for coming down here today, Josh.

101
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,070
I've got the district
breathing down my back.

102
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,541
The test scores have
gone down again this year.

103
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,545
As I said earlier,
I appreciate your dilemma, Bob,

104
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,310
but I really don't understand
what it is I have to offer.

105
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,841
No no no, all I want you to do
is look at these kids

106
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,218
and tell me if you think
my idea's crazy.

107
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,450
I think some of them
have a lot of potential.

108
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,219
Girls!
Why aren't you in class?

109
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,727
- She holding us up.
- Akeelah!

110
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,157
Are you signed up
for the spelling bee today?

111
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,564
No.

112
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,569
I want you to come
to my office, please.

113
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,006
So, Ms. Cross tells me

114
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,670
you've never missed a word
on your spelling tests.

115
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,805
But your attendance record
leaves a little to be desired.

116
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:33,411
- You're 11, did you skip a grade?
- The second.

117
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,824
Akeelah, have you ever heard
of the Scripps National Spelling Bee?

118
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:43,226
- I think it was on TV last week.
- Yes!

119
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,787
Yes, they show it
on ESPN every year.

120
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,596
Middle school students
from all over the country

121
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,695
compete in school district
and regional spelling bees

122
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:56,504
trying to make it to the national
spelling bee in Washington DC.

123
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,306
Next year, I want
one of our students there.

124
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:02,143
So whoever wins
the school bee today

125
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,412
gets to represent Crenshaw
at the district bee

126
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,783
- next month.
- Why would anybody want

127
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,347
to represents a school that can't even
put doors on the toilet stalls?

128
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,289
Akeelah, if we can't show
our students can perform,

129
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,356
we're not going to have money for books,
let alone bathroom doors.

130
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,526
Now, I want you to do
the bee today, all right?

131
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,230
So everybody can call me
a freak and a brainiac?

132
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,172
No, I ain't down
for no spelling bee.

133
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:33,144
Well, maybe you'd be "down" for spending
the rest of the semester

134
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,080
in detention
for all of your absences.

135
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,106
I'd like to welcome you all

136
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,347
to Crenshaw's first schoolwide
spelling bee.

137
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:45,084
We have some very special students
competing today,

138
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,319
so let's give them all
a round of applause.

139
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,087
Whoo!

140
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,425
Okay, we drew numbers to see
who would go first,

141
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,905
and that's Chuckie Johnson
from the eighth grade.

142
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,609
Mr. Welch, I have a question
about the basketball nets.

143
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,739
Chuckie!
You need to pay attention.

144
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:12,547
Now, we're gonna start things off
with "grovel."

145
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,610
Gravel, like little rocks?

146
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,085
No, grovel like

147
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,456
get down
on your knees and grovel.

148
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,859
Get down on my knees?
What?!

149
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,795
<i>Just spell the word.</i>

150
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,628
Uh, G-R...

151
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,465
A-V-E-L.

152
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,835
No, Chuckie, you spelled gravel.

153
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,638
<i>I meant grovel: G-R-O-V-E-L.</i>

154
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,372
You weren't listening.
I'm sorry, Chuckie.

155
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,040
- Who cares?
- Okay, next up,

156
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,811
<i>Akeelah Anderson.</i>

157
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,444
Oh, you go, girl!

158
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:52,116
Akeelah, your word is "doubt."

159
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,616
- Doubt.
- D-O-U-B-T.

160
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,152
I'm sorry, Akeelah,
you have to speak up.

161
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,324
D-O-U-B-T.

162
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,129
Very good.

163
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,465
<i>Next, Calvin Baker...</i>

164
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,634
P-L-A-S-I-D.

165
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,769
Placid.

166
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:16,578
I'm sorry,
it's P-L-A-C-I-D.

167
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,046
Okay, Akeelah,
if you get this word

168
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,751
you will be the winner.
"Fanciful."

169
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,351
- Fan...
- F-A-N-C-I-F-U-L.

170
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,328
- <i>Whoa.</i>
- That is correct,

171
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,423
and you have won Crenshaw's
inaugural spelling bee.

172
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,093
Whoo!

173
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,465
Whatever.

174
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,838
Excuse me.

175
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,102
Spell "prestidigitation."

176
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,843
I'm sorry, sir,
but this girl is only 11,

177
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:54,148
<i>and she's already won.</i>
<i>Mr. Welch, what is this?</i>

178
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,885
Prestidigitation,
can you spell it?

179
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:13,666
P-R-E-S-T-I-D-I-G-I-T-A-T-I-O-N,

180
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,504
prestidigitation.

181
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,601
That's correct.

182
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,635
Whoo!

183
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:28,017
- "Ambidextrous."
- A-M-B-I-D-E-X-T-R-O-U-S.

184
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,684
- "Pterodactyl."
- P-T-E-R-O-D-A-C-T-Y-L.

185
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,286
- "Pulchritude."
- P...

186
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,493
P-U-L-C...

187
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,466
R...

188
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,600
I-T-U-D-E...

189
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,371
pulchritude?

190
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:58,349
That's incorrect.
It's from the Latin root "pulcher"

191
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,820
and there's an H after the C.

192
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,854
<i>See?</i>
<i>She ain't so smart.</i>

193
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,061
- Run for it! See ya!
- Bye, sweetie.

194
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,697
Akeelah, wait!

195
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,730
Where are you going?
You did great.

196
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,174
You were spelling words
I don't know how to spell.

197
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,112
Mr. Welch, I told you I did not want
to do this. They're laughing at me.

198
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,877
They laugh
because you intimidate them.

199
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,443
But if you'd stood your ground,
you might have earned their respect.

200
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,150
Bob, the girl has potential
but she needs to be coached.

201
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,558
Do you know who that was?

202
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,790
That was Dr. Joshua Larabee.

203
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,128
<i>He used to chair</i>
<i>the English department at UCLA.</i>

204
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,794
He and I went to college together.
But get this...

205
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,998
when he was a kid, he went all the way
to the national spelling bee.

206
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,973
And he thinks you have a chance
of going there yourself.

207
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,999
I'm sorry,

208
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,943
but I ain't doin'
no more spelling bees.

209
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,004
Akeelah...

210
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,608
Girl, you kicked some major booty
on that stage today.

211
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,280
But I couldn't spell pulchritude.

212
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,119
But you knocked all them other words
right back at that dude.

213
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:16,060
They were just trick words. Everybody
knows pterodactyl starts with a P.

214
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:20,122
Girl, if I could spell like you,
I know I could be a flight attendant.

215
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,095
<i>Keelie, hey, wake up.</i>

216
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,036
Hey.

217
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,600
- Dev, are you leaving?
- Yeah, gotta get back to the base.

218
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,444
Hey, your principal
called Mama.

219
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,246
Said you did real good
in the spelling bee last week.

220
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,152
- I messed up a word.
<i>- He said you got a lot of them right.</i>

221
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,213
He also said
you've got an opportunity

222
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,315
to go to an even bigger
contest next week.

223
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,986
- I don't want to do it.
- Why not?

224
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,087
Everybody's gonna be
looking at me

225
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,394
and there's gonna be
tons of words I don't know.

226
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,866
So you're scared, huh?

227
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:59,029
<i>How do you think I felt the first time</i>
<i>I had to jump out of an airplane?</i>

228
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,699
I mean, my whole body
said "Don't do it."

229
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,335
But sometimes your brain gotta be
smarter than your body, you know?

230
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,277
But I don't like my school.

231
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,975
I don't see why I gotta do
anything for them.

232
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,011
Then do it for Dad.

233
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,079
I mean, you know
how he was about words.

234
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,647
He'd have loved to see you
do something like this.

235
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,957
- What'd Mama say about it?
- You know how Mama is.

236
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,327
She got a million things
to worry about.

237
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,559
<i>Tell you what,</i>

238
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,534
just do this contest,

239
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,729
and if you make it all the way to DC,

240
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,931
I will parachute down to see you.

241
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,736
<i>Would you like that?</i>

242
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,724
That is a wonderful decision, Akeelah,
a wonderful decision.

243
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,697
You think maybe the school
could buy me a new outfit,

244
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,132
you know, for the district bee?

245
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,159
Uh... I don't know, maybe.

246
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:09,265
If you make it to the state regional,
maybe something could be arranged.

247
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:13,176
But you're gonna have to finish in
the top 10 at the district level first.

248
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,670
And, Akeelah, you're going to be going
up against kids from Santa Monica,

249
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,649
Woodland Hills, Beverly Hills.

250
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:22,245
Some of these kids have been doing this
for years and never even made it to DC.

251
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,018
- Well, maybe I should just give up now.
- No no no.

252
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,959
No, I'm just saying
you need to train hard.

253
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,792
- With Dr. Larabee.
- What?

254
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,594
I don't need any help from him.
I could do this on my own.

255
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,397
Akeelah, the best spellers
in the world have coaches.

256
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,631
<i>I finally got him to consider</i>
<i>taking some time</i>

257
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,731
during his sabbatical
to work with you.

258
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,334
Please, just talk with him.

259
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,844
Here.
He doesn't live far from here.

260
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,847
He lives in this neighborhood?

261
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,349
I thought you said
he was important.

262
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,147
And take this, it's a copy
of last year's spelling bee.

263
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,280
<i>- "Sacciform."</i>
<i>- May I have the definition, please?</i>

264
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,722
<i>Resembling a pouch.</i>

265
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,748
May I have the language
of origin, please?

266
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,556
<i>- Latin.</i>
- Latin?

267
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,654
I thought this was
supposed to be English.

268
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,791
<i>... I-F-O-R...</i>

269
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,862
"Scutellate"?
Can I have the definition?

270
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,667
"Longicollis."

271
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,973
- "Ginglymus."
- "Empennage."

272
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,002
- "Souchong."
- "Intussusception."

273
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,378
- Hey, what's dat?
<i>- Any alternate pronunciations?</i>

274
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:26,543
Where you been?
Mama's worried.

275
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,610
Mama should just chill, a'ight?

276
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,782
- What you looking at?
- Spelling bee.

277
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,292
Oh yeah, I heard about that.

278
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,954
You going up against
a bunch of rich white kids.

279
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,988
They gonna tear your black ass up.

280
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,800
<i>Intussusception is</i>

281
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:49,069
<i>I-N-T-U-S-S-U-S-C-E-P-T-I-O-N.</i>

282
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,509
You're late.

283
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,671
- You didn't answer the door.
- That's because you're late.

284
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,681
Come in.

285
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,876
Come come come.

286
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,487
So...

287
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,357
- you want to learn how to spell.
- I know how to spell.

288
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,385
- Spell "staphylococci."
- Um...

289
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,024
S-T-A-F...

290
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,127
There is no F. It's derived
from the Greek so there can't be an F.

291
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,037
Staphylococci:
S-T-A...

292
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,871
P-H-Y...

293
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,241
L-O-C-O...

294
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,973
C-C-I.

295
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,947
<i>Winning word,</i>
<i>national spelling bee</i>

296
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,608
<i>1987.</i>

297
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,118
The first thing
most serious spellers do

298
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,588
is learn all of the winning words
and their origins.

299
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,749
Well, maybe I ain't that serious.

300
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,090
Maybe neither am I.

301
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,358
So why are you home
during the day?

302
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,558
- Ain't you got a job?
<i>- Do me a favor,</i>

303
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,726
leave the ghetto talk
outside, all right?

304
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,633
Ghetto talk?
I don't talk ghetto.

305
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,467
Hm, "ain't you got no job?"

306
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,474
<i>You use that language</i>

Here you will speak properly
or you won't speak at all.

308
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,403
<i>- Understood?</i>
- Yeah.

309
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,541
Whatever.

310
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,983
- You can leave now.
- Excuse me?

311
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,077
- I said you can leave.
- How come?

312
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,319
Because I don't have time
to waste on insolent little girls.

313
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:49,521
Insolent?
I ain't insol...

314
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,290
I mean I'm not insolent.

315
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,163
It's just the first thing you do
is start doggin' on...

316
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,601
criticizing the way I speak.

317
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,132
I thought this was
just about spelling words.

318
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,070
Well then, fine.

319
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,217
You know what?

320
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:20,316
When I put my mind to it,
I can memorize anything.

321
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,056
And I don't need help
from a dictatorial, truculent,

322
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,826
supercilious gardener.

323
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,499
I'm sorry to be so insolent.

Baby, what are you still doing up?

330
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,323
I've gotta learn more words.

331
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,660
You gonna come see me
in the district bee this Saturday?

332
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,724
- What, is that at your school?
- Naw.

333
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,134
- Beverly Hills.
- Beverly Hills?

334
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,006
Look, you got other homework.

335
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,670
You need to focus on that. I don't want
you spending all your time on this game.

336
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,509
It ain't a game!
Are you gonna come see me in it?

337
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,509
You know I work at the hospital
on Saturday.

338
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,451
Maybe Kiana can go with you.

339
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,284
As long as she don't bring
that whiny baby.

340
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,557
Come on, girls, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

341
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,302
Dang.

342
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,810
I hope they ain't all here to spell.

343
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,869
Okay, go get your number.

344
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,746
- We'll be sitting back here.
- Good luck, Keelie.

345
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,492
Hi. Name?

346
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,061
Akeelah Anderson.

347
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,165
Right here at the top.

348
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:20,611
I think you're the first speller we've
ever had from Crenshaw Middle School.

349
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,911
Um... how many kids
are in this thing?

350
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,940
139.

351
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,977
Next.

352
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,626
Need some help?
Don't worry, I won't impale you.

353
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,223
- This your first time?
- Yeah.

354
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,324
- You?
- Second year.

355
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,928
I made it to nationals last year,
finished 13th.

356
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,495
Lucky 13.

357
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,973
You went all the way to DC?

358
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,841
Three of us made it from my school
in Woodland Hills.

359
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,039
See that kid right there?

360
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,980
That's Dylan Chiu.

361
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,212
He's come in second place
at nationals for two years in a row.

362
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,380
This is his last year and everybody
thinks he's gonna win.

363
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,357
Frankly, I'd like to shove him
off a steep precipice.

364
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,687
Hey, my name is Javier.

365
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,719
- I'm Akeelah.
- Hope you make the top 10.

366
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,754
I hope I'm not the first one out.

367
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,427
<i>Will all the spellers take</i>
<i>their positions on stage, please?</i>

368
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,528
Remember, if you don't know how to spell
a word, spell it the way it sounds.

369
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:23,166
Kids mess up all the time when they
think they're being thrown curveballs,

370
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,335
<i>- and they're not. Good luck.</i>
- Good luck to you too.

00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:47,951
I'm not sure if you're saying
imminent or eminent.

389

- Would you like a definition?

<i>"Concierge."</i>

<i>Speak into the mike, please.</i>

We're down to 11 spellers.

411

The top 10 qualify for
the Southern California regional finals.

412

In the next round...

413

do not leave the stage...

00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,782
Ma'am, this is serious business.

461
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,818
Oh, you're damn right it's serious!
You are gonna give these kids ulcers!

462
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,452
<i>Do you know how long</i>
<i>he has studied for this?</i>

463
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,928
- He knew that word.
<i>- No,</i>

464
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,658
I didn't.

465
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,429
I'm sorry, number 62,

466
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,996
you are disqualified
from competition.

467
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,736
Which means, number 54,

468
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,803
if you can spell
one more word correctly

469
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:45,213
<i>you'll be our 10th</i>
<i>and last finalist.</i>

470
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,919
"Pastiche."

471
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:05,526
P-A-S-T-I-C-H-E,

472
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,435
pastiche.

473
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,635
That's correct.
That means you've qualified

474
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,405
<i>for the Southern California</i>
<i>regional finals.</i>

475
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,775
Here's my number. We have
a spelling club in my school, maybe you

476
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,549
- should come practice with us sometime.
- That sounds fun.

477
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,557
Yeah, it's cool. Hey, there's my folks.
I'll catch you later.

478
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,389
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

479
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:33,523
Hey, check it out... look at this.
They're gonna be at USC this summer.

480
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:37,331
Just think, Akeelah, all you've got
to do is place in the top three

481
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:41,168
of the state regionals,
and you're going to Washington DC.

482
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:44,039
Not if I can't spell synecdoche.

483
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:46,339
Uh-oh, y'all, look.

484
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,107
I told you to wear a shirt and tie.
As long as you live in my house

485
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,910
<i>- you do what I say. What did I say?</i>
<i>- Ma...</i>

486
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,042
- No drugs, no gangbangin'...
- Why you stressing me?

487
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,745
- and no $300 watches.
Take it off.

488
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,481
<i>- Derrick-T gave me this. Yes.</i>
<i>- He did?</i>

489
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,318
<i>- Then I'm gonna give it right back.</i>
- Mom?

490
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,085
What?!
You two get inside.

491
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,649
- Take it off.
- But, Mama, I made it.

492
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,027
- Made what?
- Made the cut.

493
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,328
I'm going to the regional bee.

494
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:12,598
While you're doing that, I'm gonna be
identifying your brother in the morgue.

495
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,071
<i>- No you're not. Ma...</i>
<i>- Yes, I am. Get inside before</i>

496
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,869
I really embarrass your behind.

497
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:20,605
- Akeelah?
- Akeelah, get in here!

498
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,914
It's okay, Mr. Welch.

499
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,281
I'll see you later.

500
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,084
Guess what.

501
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,997
I'm going to the regional bee.

502
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,678
<i>Dylan?</i>

503
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,788
I'm Akeelah.

504
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:20,489
Javier said I can come
and join the study group today.

505
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,999
All those rejects do that.

506
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,264
My father coaches me privately.

507
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,396
Who's your coach?

508
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,870
- I don't got one.
- How many spelling bees have you won?

509
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,377
Just the one at my school.

510
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,216
Spell "xanthosis."

511
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,352
- Z-A...
<i>- It starts with an X.</i>

512
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,380
If that idiot hadn't
been caught cheating

513
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:48,756
<i>you wouldn't have made the cut.</i>

514
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,327
- "Euphoric."
- Euphoric is an adjective.

515
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,358
Origin Greek.

516
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,496
It means like
feeling great and everything.

517
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,870
Either spell the word
or take a shot.

518
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:06,707
<i>If you miss either one you get a strike.</i>
<i>Three strikes, you're out.</i>

519
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:11,209
Euphoric, E-U...

520
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:16,016
P-H-O-R-I-C...

521
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,716
euphoric.
"Psoriasis."

522
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:24,456
Are you taking Latin at your school?
Psoriasis is a noun, origin Greek.

523
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:28,329
Are you kidding? My school barely has
enough money for kickballs.

524
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:32,097
- There's no Latin classes.
- Latin helps you understand words.

525
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,604
Psoriasis is like itchy skin.

526
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,073
Maybe your mom could drive you
up here to take it with us.

527
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:40,305
I don't know. This is all
starting to sound real heavy.

528
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:43,404
It is heavy.
Spelling bees are serious shit.

529
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,609
I think I'll take a shot.

530
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,450
On second thought,
could I spell the word?

531
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,621
At Crenshaw they think I'm a freak.

532
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,723
Don't worry.
They think we're freaks here too.

533
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,597
Hey, there's my mom.
Need a ride?

534
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:07,627
Oh... naw.
My mom's gonna pick me up.

535
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,663
She should be here soon.

536
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,474
Hey, I'm having a birthday party
in a few weeks.

537
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,741
You want to come?

538
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,943
Maybe. If I can.

539
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,178
It was cool seeing you
again, Akeelah. Bye.

540
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,414
Bye.

541
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:57,515
Where the hell have you been?

542
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:01,286
- Studying.
- Studying where?

543
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,561
- Woodland Hills.
- Woodland Hills?

544
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,359
What you doing there?

545
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,195
They got a spelling club.

546
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,964
Did Mr. Welch take you?
'Cause ain't nobody call me.

547
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,909
I went by myself. I didn't think
the bus ride would take so long.

548
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:24,210
- I'm sorry.
- Akeelah Anderson!

549
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:27,012
You done lost your mind?
You 11 years old.

550
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:29,815
You don't be taking a bus
to Woodland Hills by yourself.

551
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,551
- There's nobody around to take me.
- That's 'cause I work.

552
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,616
That's what you said
on the weekend.

553
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,527
All the other kids have
their parents at the district bee.

554
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:42,055
Maybe the other kids have parents
who got more time on their hands.

555
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:45,660
Look, I'm not having another child
of mine disappearing at all hours.

556
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,934
So if this spelling thing means sneaking
off to the suburbs by yourself,

557
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,237
- I'm calling it all off.
- We can't call it off!

558
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,733
- I'm going to the regional bee.
- Not if you flunk out of school.

559
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,839
I just got a letter saying you gotta
take summer school to make up

560
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,113
- for all these classes you skipped.
- But, Mama, I hate Crenshaw!

561
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,019
It is so boring there
and nobody cares.

562
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,047
But you think they care about you
in Woodland Hills?

563
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,820
At least they got Latin classes

564
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,952
and the kids don't have to study
in their stairwells.

565
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:14,761
Good for them. But until you finish
summer school at Crenshaw

566
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:18,064
- ain't gonna be no more spelling bees.
- But, Mama, I got to get ready

567
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,229
for the state bee during the summer.

568
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,035
You just gonna have to do that
next year, now, aren't you?

569
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,872
- But that's not fair!
- Not only is it fair,

570
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,639
it's final.

571
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,752
You'd let me do it.

572
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,177
1979, maculature:

573
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,248
M-A-C-U-L-A-T-U-R-E.
Origin is Latin.

574
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:18,353
1990, fibranne:
F-I-B-R-A-N-N-E. French.

575
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:22,560
1996, vivisepulture:
V-I-V-I-S-E-P-U-L-T-U-R-E.

576
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,364
Latin.

577
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,770
I learned all the winning words
since 1925

578
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,774
just like you said I should.

579
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:34,443
Sorry for being
so insolent last time.

580
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,139
That's not gonna happen no more.

581
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,171
<i>Any... more.</i>

582
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,479
I promise.

583
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:45,080
I was wondering if you might reconsider
coaching me for the state bee.

584
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,291
'Cause I need a coach.

585
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,659
Bad.

586
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:56,723
Badly.
You need a coach badly.

587
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,133
Come in.

588
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,175
Come in, come in.

589
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,149
That's a very pretty lady.
Is she your wife?

590
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,679
Listen, you got very lucky
at the district bee.

591
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,989
The competition at state level
is much stronger.

592
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,588
So if you... and I were
to prepare for that,

593
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,825
we'd have to do it on my schedule.

594
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:32,358
<i>So we'd have to work three hours</i>
<i>each morning starting at 9:00.</i>

595
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,600
<i>- Can you handle that?</i>
- Well, I do have summer school.

596
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,904
But Mr. Welch said working with you
could take the place of it.

597
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:43,573
Isn't that for students who don't
perform satisfactorily during the year?

598
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:48,415
Well, sometimes
it's for kids want to get ahead

599
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,886
- for next year.
- Yes, please put that down.

600
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,686
Just... yeah.

601
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,957
Have you...
have you got any goals?

602
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,829
- Hmm?
<i>- Goals...</i>

603
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,801
<i>what would you like to be</i>
<i>when you grow up?</i>

604
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,929
A doctor, a lawyer,
a standup comic.

605
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:12,409
I don't know. The only thing
I'm good at is spelling.

606
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,338
Go over there

607
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:21,408
and read the quotation
that's on the wall.

608
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,717
<i>Read it aloud please.</i>

609
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:32,158
"Our deepest fear is not
that we are inadequate.

610
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:37,361
Our deepest fear is that we
are powerful beyond measure.

611
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,665
We ask ourselves

612
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:43,036
'Who am I to be brilliant,
gorgeous,

613
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,633
talented and fabulous? '

614
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:47,735
Actually,

615
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,474
who are you not to be?

616
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,710
<i>We were born to make manifest</i>

617
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,481
<i>the glory of God that is within us.</i>

618
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,613
And as we let our own light shine,

619
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:02,422
we unconsciously give other people
permission to do the same."

620
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,656
Does that mean anything to you?

621
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:12,296
- I don't know.
- It's written in plain English.

622
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,135
What does it mean?

623
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:20,100
- That I'm not supposed to be afraid.
- Afraid of what?

624
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,212
Afraid of...

625
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,878
me?

626
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,052
This national spelling bee
is a tough nut.

627
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,361
I've seen it chew kids up
and spit them out.

628
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:45,163
<i>So if you want to get there</i>
<i>you can't be a shrinking violet.</i>

629
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,898
You have to stand up
and show them what you can do.

630
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,099
All right?

631
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:55,239
And I'll brook no nonsense.
You show up on time

632
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,248
<i>with no attitude or it's over.</i>

633
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,375
Agreed?

634
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,145
Agreed.

635
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:15,924
Here it is, here it is.
Stop stop stop stop.

636
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:19,265
Girl, Mom would trip if she knew
we borrowed the car for this.

637
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,669
That's why Mama
ain't gonna know.

638
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,872
<i>Come on, Georgia.</i>

639
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,004
Um...

640
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,844
I'm gonna go
to the mall with Kiana.

641
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,215
But I thought you wanted
to go to this party.

642
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:39,714
Hey, Akeelah!

643
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,058
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

644
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,591
Come on, let's go.

645
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,101
How are you?
Oh, thank you.

646
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:03,738
<i>- Why'd you invite him?</i>
<i>- My dad's friends with his dad.</i>

647
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:07,376
I'm surprised he showed up.
Hey, you want to see my house?

648
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,613
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

649
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:12,451
This is my father's office.

650
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,925
He's a journalist and he's written
like a bunch of books.

651
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:20,153
What's your father do?

652
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,597
My daddy...

653
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,931
he used to work
for the city parks.

654
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,500
Man, you got a lot of friends.

655
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,804
I never had
a birthday party this big.

656
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,742
I'd think you'd have
lots of friends.

657
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,880
- Why'd you do that?
- I had an impulse.

658
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,782
Are you gonna sue me
for sexual harassment?

659
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,925
That was fun.

660
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,694
What are they doing down there?

661
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:59,601
<i>Oh no, Dylan brought</i>
<i>his Scrabble games.</i>

662
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,298
Scrabble?

663
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:04,171
<i>I get 30 seconds for each board.</i>

664
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:07,109
We need one more.
Who wants to play?

665
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,339
I will.

666
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:17,285
<i>And right out of the gate,</i>
<i>Roman scores 32 points</i>

667
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,687
with "birch" on
the double-word score.

668
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:23,955
Dylan counters with the immediate
use of Z for 39 big ones.

669
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,453
<i>Polly tests the water</i>
<i>with "acorn."</i>

670
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:31,898
<i>And Dylan answers with a body blow:</i>
<i>"beacon" for 20.</i>

671
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:36,004
<i>Holy cannoli.</i>

672
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:41,174
<i>Right off the bat,</i>
<i>Akeelah uses all her letters</i>

673
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,202
getting 50 extra points

674
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:46,216
for a whopping 82.

675
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,319
What will Dylan do?

676
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,719
He's fighting the clock.

677
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,246
You could cut
the tension with a butter knife.

678
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,816
Shut up.

679
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:05,895
Shazam!

680
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:09,372
Dylan gets
his own bingo for 76 points.

681
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,711
It's come down to this.
After having crushed all five opponents,

682
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,844
Dylan has only Akeelah to beat.

683
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:26,287
But she's ahead by 21
and has only a few letters left.

684
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,518
Is this an upset in the making?

685
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,754
What kind of birthday party is this?

686
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:43,773
Yowza! Using the triple word score,
Dylan charges ahead by six.

687
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:52,949
Just go.

688
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:06,927
Booyah! Akeelah's in the lead by
12 points and had only one letter left.

689
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,558
<i>But this could be Dylan's final play.</i>

690
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,270
Arrivederci, sweetheart.

691
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,777
12 points ties the game,

692
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:26,112
but Dylan gets
Akeelah's last two points.

693
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,415
<i>He wins a heartbreaker.</i>

694
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:34,818
Wow, Akeelah. No one ever
gets that close to beating Dylan.

695
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,826
But I didn't beat him.

696
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:41,461
Girl, you passed up the mall
to play Scrabble?

697
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,927
<i>She just got lucky.</i>

698
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,906
<i>If you can barely beat a little</i>
<i>black girl at a silly board game,</i>

699
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,341
how do you expect
to win the national bee?

700
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,471
Listen!

701
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:00,347
We're not coming in second
again this year.

702
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,182
<i>We're going to win.</i>

703
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,586
Let's go.

704
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,190
<i>"He began to have a dim feeling</i>

705
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:13,458
that to attain his place in the world

706
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,227
he must be himself
and not another."

707
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:19,463
Dr. Larabee,
this book is too heavy.

708
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,994
Good. It'll develop
your arm muscles.

709
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,166
I thought we were developing
my vocabulary.

710
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,108
We are.
Please continue reading.

711
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,703
But I already know most
of the words in this speech.

712
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,077
It's not a speech.
It's an essay.

713
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,378
By WEB DuBois,
the first black man

714
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,749
to receive a PhD
from Harvard University.

715
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,913
Maybe we should be
studying more big words.

716
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:43,621
- Spell "cabalistic."
- C-A-B-A-L-I-S-T-I-C,

717
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,185
- cabalistic.
- And when did you learn that one?

718
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,664
About two minutes ago
in this book.

719
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,395
But in the time it took
to learn that one word,

720
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,562
Dylan probably learned 20.

721
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,038
And those 20 words
won't mean anything to him.

722
00:47:56,073 --> 00:48:00,032
He's just a little robot
memorizing lists of words.

723
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:03,342
The people we are studying:
DuBois, Dr. King, JFK,

724
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,905
these people used words
to change the world.

725
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,645
...the world...
- And they didn't acquire

726
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:11,518
their vocabulary
by rote memorization.

727
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:16,558
Okay.
But when I'm at the bee,

728
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:19,721
and they tell me to spell some
little fish from Australia

729
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:22,163
or some weird bacteria
on the moon,

730
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,635
we're gonna wish we'd done
a little bit more rote memorizing

731
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,762
and not so much essay reading...

732
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:31,103
if you don't mind me saying.

733
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:36,244
Bacteria don't exist on the moon.

734
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,748
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

735
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:41,148
Where do you think
big words come from?

736
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:43,812
People with big brains.

737
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:49,784
All right, what do you see?

738
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,760
A bunch of big words
I don't know.

739
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:53,922
Ah, look again.

740
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:57,891
What kind of power
do we get from the sun?

741
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:01,234
- Solar.
- So what does "sol" mean?

742
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,468
- Sun.
- What does "terraneous" sound like?

743
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,567
- Terrain.
- Meaning the earth.

744
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,512
"Soliterraneous" means
the sun and the earth

745
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,914
working together.
So where do big words come from?

746
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,886
- Little words.
- And how many little words do you know?

747
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,945
- Tons.
- Yes!

748
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,116
And there are tons more
for you to learn.

749
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,989
There are Greek ones.

750
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,824
There are Latin ones.

751
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:30,595
French ones.
And if you learn them all,

752
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,296
you can spell any word,
no matter how big.

753
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:39,164
Maybe we should get back
to the essay reading.

754
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:42,201
What's the matter?
I thought you wanted to...

755
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,839
win the national spelling bee.

756
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:48,009
Maybe just getting there
this time is good enough.

757
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:50,952
Don't give me that.

758
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,548
You want to win it so badly

759
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,956
it keeps you up at night.

760
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,429
Ever since you found out there was such
a thing as the national spelling bee

761
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,795
you've seen yourself
holding up that trophy,

762
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,198
but if you can't say it,
you can't win it. So say it.

763
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:06,998
- I want to win.
- Say it louder please.

764
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,028
- I want to win.
- You want to win what?

765
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:11,870
I want to win
the national spelling bee!

766
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:15,344
Good. Good.

767
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:18,007
You'll win using my methods.

768
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,881
By first understanding
the power of language,

769
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:23,215
then by deconstructing it,

770
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:26,279
breaking it down to its origins,
to its roots,

771
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,814
you'll consume it.
You will own it.

772
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,350
And then you know
what you'll be?

773
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:33,659
Mm-hmm.
Tired.

774
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,858
You'll be a champion.

775
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,893
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

776
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,767
All right, let's go.

777
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:44,925
Um, why are you home so early?

778
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,232
Just wasn't feeling well.

779
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,740
What you got there?

780
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:53,140
Homework.

781
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,845
You know, the regional bee
is coming up soon

782
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,873
and I was wondering
if you might want...

783
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:02,908
Is that gonna happen
in Beverly Hills too?

784
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,581
- I don't know.
- I told you,

785
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,887
you pass summer school then you can
start worrying about the spelling bee.

786
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:11,291
- But if you would...
- Akeelah.

787
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,922
Baby, I'm just not
in the mood, all right?

788
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,971
So how come
you don't teach anymore?

789
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:32,004
I told you I do teach. I...

790
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:34,516
I administer classes online.

791
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:37,349
Let's keep going.

792
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:40,356
- "Effervescent."
- E-F-F...

793
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,884
E-R-V-E...

794
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:48,592
S-E-N-T,

795
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,725
- effervescent.
- Come on, you know this word.

796
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,632
That dog's distracting me.

797
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,933
You're gonna have
much bigger distractions

798
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:56,996
when you get
to the national bee in DC.

799
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,235
<i>Now what is that</i>
<i>you're doing with your hand, hmm?</i>

800
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,107
What?

801
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:03,305
With your hand, your hand?

802
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,904
You... you... you...

803
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:07,644
- you tap, like that. What is that?
- I don't know.

804
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,120
So why do you got
all these toys for?

805
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,428
They belonged to my niece.

806
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:26,128
Oh. So you got
any kids of your own?

807
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:28,569
You ask a lot
of questions, don't you?

808
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,732
I'm naturally inquisitive.

809
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:33,106
Which is also sometimes confused

810
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,442
with being naturally obnoxious.
Here.

811
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:38,413
Let me see you jump rope.

812
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:41,349
- Just jump?
- Yes, just jump.

813
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,556
Is there a point to this?

814
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,466
Yes, there is.
Keep going.

815
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,272
I said keep going.

816
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:08,209
Concentrate.
Stay focused.

817
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,237
<i>Spell effervescent. Don't think</i>
<i>about anything else. Come on.</i>

818
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:12,646
Go.

819
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:15,617
E-F-F-E...

820
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:18,712
- R-V-E-S...
- Good!

821
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,849
C-E-N-T,

822
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:24,951
- effervescent.
- You see that? That's your trick.

823
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:27,896
- That's your mnemonic device.
- Jumping rope?

824
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,956
Keeping time, keeping time.

825
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,468
You see kids at the bee...
they do all kinds of things.

826
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,096
They... they sway back and forth.
They...

827
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,299
turn around,
turn around in circles.

828
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,831
Anything they have to do
to stay focused.

829
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:42,674
You keep time.
And I bet you

830
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:45,146
if you learned the words
while you kept time

831
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:49,117
you would remember them
even better.

832
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:53,552
...L-U-N-I-Z-E.

833
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,524
"Quamdiu."

834
00:54:55,558 --> 00:55:00,621
- Q-U-A-M-D-I-U.
- Good.

835
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,154
Cognizant.

836
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:04,063
C-O-G-

837
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,536
N-I-Z-A-N-T.

838
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,128
Correct. "Tzigane."

839
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:13,905
T-Z-I-G-A-N-E.

840
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,205
Correct.

841
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:26,946
It's too bad your mother had
to work today, Akeelah.

842
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,753
Did she get to see the new dress?

843
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:32,228
Uh, yeah. She thought it was cool.
Oh, there goes Javier.

844
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:34,492
<i>This is a very exciting day for us here</i>

845
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:38,524
because our top three spellers will be
representing Southern California

846
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:42,902
at the national spelling bee
in Washington DC.

847
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:44,304
Yes!

848
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:48,800
<i>So what do you say?</i>
<i>Let's spell!</i>

849
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,678
Well, Josh, you think
she's got a shot at it?

850
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,706
We'll see.

851
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:58,812
- "Alfresco."
- A-L-F-R-E-S-C-O,

852
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:01,380
- alfresco.
<i>- That's correct.</i>

853
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,027
Loquacious.

854
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:07,893
Espadrille.

855
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:10,297
Jambalaya.

856
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:13,399
Could you repeat
the word, please?

857
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:15,336
Malloseismic.

858
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,539
M...

859
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,873
A-I...

860
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,037
<i>O...</i>

861
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,206
<i>S-E...</i>

862
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:27,409
I-S-M-I-C.

863
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:31,580
<i>Malloseismic is...</i>

864
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,521
M-A-L-I...

865
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:37,617
<i>O-S-E-I-S-M-I-C.</i>

866
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,720
It's all right.
It's all right.

867
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:47,932
<i>D-O-U-B-L-U-R-E.</i>

868
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,462
<i>That's correct.</i>

869
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,145
"Psalmody."

870
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,478
<i>Definition please.</i>

871
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:03,213
<i>- Psalmody means the practice...</i>
- Mrs. Anderson.

872
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,050
<i>... or art of of singing in psalms.</i>

873
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,249
I want my daughter
off that stage right now.

874
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:10,292
P-S-A...

875
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:13,921
I don't care what she said.
I want her off that stage.

876
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:16,158
<i>I didn't know she was here</i>
<i>and I didn't give her permission...</i>

877
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,963
- L-M-O...
<i>- I'm sorry, Mrs. Anderson.</i>

878
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:22,233
No, I told her she was
expressly not to be here.

879
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,264
<i>And you don't take my child anywhere</i>
<i>without my permission.</i>

880
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,799
- D-Y, psalmody.

881
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:32,607
That's correct.

882
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:35,083
<i>All right, next please.</i>

883
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,177
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

884
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,246
The mother of one of the spellers
needs to speak with her.

885
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,258
- It's rather urgent.
- Um...

886
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,022
Okay, but she must be
back on the stage

887
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,586
<i>before her next turn</i>
<i>or she'll be disqualified.</i>

888
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,121
She'll be back.

889
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:08,142
I swear we thought you were on board
with this, Mrs. Anderson.

890
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,482
You want to tell me
what the heck is going on here?

891
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,784
<i>Because I never signed</i>
<i>a consent form.</i>

892
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:16,958
- I signed Daddy's name.
- You did what?!

893
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:22,361
How do you think I felt

894
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:25,799
when Javier's mother calls me
to see if I need a ride to USC?

895
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,429
I don't know who she is
or what she's talking about.

896
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:31,634
I'm sorry, Mama.
I just wanted to do the bee.

897
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:35,303
By lying? By going behind
my back for the last six months?

898
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,007
<i>You might as well say goodbye</i>
<i>to your little friends, Akeelah,</i>

899
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:40,038
because this is your last
spelling bee.

900
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,551
I beg you, Mrs. Anderson,
to reconsider this.

901
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:44,644
- She deserves this opport...
- Bob.

902
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,349
Mrs. Anderson's right.

903
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:50,223
Akeelah does not deserve to go
to the bee this year.

904
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,524
What?

905
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,757
Next speller please.

906
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:58,999
<i>Come on up to the mike please.</i>

907
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:06,773
<i>A little faster. Come on.</i>

908
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,080
I apologize, Mrs. Anderson,

909
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:15,175
if we've contributed to any anguish
you may be feeling.

910
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,083
And who are you exactly?

911
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,350
My name is Joshua Larabee, ma'am.

912
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,085
And I've been...
well, I've been helping Akeelah

913
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,685
prepare herself
for the spelling bee.

914
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:28,993
Akeelah's been getting extra school
credit for working with Dr. Larabee.

915
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:32,490
We designed an entire program
specifically for her.

916
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,867
Why didn't you tell me about this?

917
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,600
Mama, I hated going
behind your back,

918
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,098
but every time I brought up the bee,
you didn't want to hear it.

919
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,742
I didn't know what to do.

920
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:48,216
Can I get the pronunciation again?

921
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:52,813
He's given it to you five times.
You need to spell the word.

922
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:55,085
Could you use it in a sentence?

923
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:57,991
He's already used it in a sentence.

924
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:00,894
I mean a different sentence
than you used before.

925
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,832
- You only get one sentence.
- What's up with this kid?

926
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:11,196
You must want this thing pretty bad
because you ain't

927
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,834
never lied to me before in your life.

928
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:15,867
So maybe you can tell me
what you think

929
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:18,574
a good punishment would be
for what you did.

930
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:26,152
- I guess I gotta miss the bee.
- But that don't just punish you.

931
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:29,488
Mr. Welch and Dr. Larabee done put
a lot of time into this too.

932
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:31,891
So you think of something else.

933
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:38,256
Maybe double chores
for the month.

934
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:41,099
For the next three months.

935
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:45,367
She still got time to get
back up on that stage?

936
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:49,704
If we move very quickly, yes.

937
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,941
Well, I guess you'd
better get a move on.

938
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,482
We haven't much time.

939
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:00,318
Come on, come on.

940
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:05,290
Thank you, Mama.

941
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,388
All right.

942
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:14,566
- Dr. Larabee, is it?
- Yes.

943
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:17,732
So you actually think
Akeelah has a chance

944
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:20,140
<i>to win the national spelling bee?</i>

945
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,973
Yes.

946
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,911
Yes, I think she does.

947
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:28,413
Well...

948
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:31,511
- could you use it in a song?
- What?

949
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:39,257
Never mind. Ratatouille:
R-A-T-A-T-O-U-I-L-L-E, ratatouille.

950
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:41,354
Uh... that's correct.

951
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:44,491
- Where's number 73, please?
- She's here, she's here.

952
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,468
<i>Number 73.</i>

953
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:53,071
- Thank you.
- I was about to start tap dancing.

954
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:58,178
<i>Okay, "pluviosity."</i>

955
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,205
Can I get a definition please?

956
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:04,879
<i>Pluviosity means a state</i>
<i>characterized by much rain.</i>

957
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,663
Pluviosity:

958
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:20,101
P-L-U-V-I-O-S-I-T-Y,

959
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,730
- pluviosity.
- That's correct.

960
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,205
Thank you.

961
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:45,351
I'd like to thank you all
for coming out today

962
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:48,989
to honor our own
Akeelah Anderson!

963
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,838
Um...

964
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:01,105
thanks...

965
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:03,203
a lot.

966
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:10,149
Oh girl, you like
a movie star now.

967
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:12,484
I know.
It's pretty crazy.

968
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:15,457
Hey, my mama said she want
to take us out to celebrate tonight.

969
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,024
Javier's parents are taking me out.

970
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:21,461
- But maybe we can...
- Akeelah, excuse me. I'm sorry.

971
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:23,795
There's a reporter here
and she wants to talk to you.

972
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,495
- I don't want to talk to no reporter.
- Are you kidding?

973
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,596
This is exactly the kind of
good publicity Crenshaw needs.

974
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,199
Excuse us! Sorry.

975
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:36,535
<i>Hi, this is Lauren Sanchez</i>
<i>reporting from South Los Angeles.</i>

976
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:39,013
I'm here with 11-year-old
Akeelah Anderson.

977
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:41,414
<i>She's a seventh grader</i>
<i>from Crenshaw Middle School</i>

978
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:44,214
who's heading to the national
spelling bee. How does it feel

979
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,517
<i>now that you're going to be going</i>
<i>to Washington DC?</i>

980
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:48,183
<i>- It's pretty cool.</i>
<i>- Are you excited?</i>

981
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:50,886
<i>All right, let's check out the word</i>
<i>that Akeelah spelled</i>

982
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:53,987
<i>here at the Southern California finals</i>
<i>that got her to the national bee.</i>

983
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:57,693
<i>Erythrocyte: E-R-Y...</i>

984
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:11,244
<i>- Spell, "affenpinscher."</i>
<i>- Affen-what?</i>

985
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,872
"Grallatorial."

986
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:16,282
- G-R-A-L-A-T...
<i>- Wrong.</i>

987
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,117
- "Jacquard."
- Dr. Larabee.

988
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:20,884
Spell the word jacquard.

989
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:26,091
- J-A-Q-U...
- What about the C?

990
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:30,258
These are all words that were missed
in last year's national spelling bee.

991
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:33,063
- And you can't spell one of them.
- Maybe because we haven't

992
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:35,366
- studied them yet.
- Why did you cancel yesterday?

993
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:37,304
Hmm?
Were you doing another interview,

994
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,570
flaunting yourself in front
of the television cameras?

995
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:42,339
No, I was at the mall.

996
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:45,905
Look, I wasn't dissing you.
I was Christmas shopping.

997
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:48,439
"Dissing"? I thought we didn't
use words like that.

998
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:51,749
I thought we only used words
from the dictionary in here.

999
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,464
"Dis, dissed, dissing:
to treat with disrespect

1000
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,433
<i>or contempt;</i>
<i>to find fault with. "</i>

1001
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:08,733
New words get added
to the dictionary every year.

1002
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:18,780
Look, I didn't get
to the national bee

1003
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:21,112
until I was 14 years old.

1004
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,448
I had no help.
I had no training.

1005
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,454
I had nothing.

1006
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:27,718
By the time I got
to the third round, I was out.

1007
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:31,318
<i>You have an opportunity</i>

1008
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,487
to win this thing.

1009
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,893
But all we've done
for eight months

1010
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:42,268
is study words.
Why can't we take a break,

1011
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:46,071
go to a movie, to a basketball game?
Why can't we have fun?

1012
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,373
I told you, Denise,
you can have fun after the bee.

1013
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,848
Who's Denise?

1014
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,215
What?

1015
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,311
Denise, you called me Denise.
Who's that?

1016
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:04,122
Dr. Larabee, are you okay?

1017
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:09,193
Yes.

1018
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:11,665
Yes, I'm fine.

1019
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,997
Listen, I spent all last week

1020
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,099
making these for you.

1021
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,508
- What are they?
<i>- They're flash cards.</i>

1022
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:26,140
5,000 new words, the types
that you will run into at the finals.

1023
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:29,447
5,000? But we've only
got a few months left.

1024
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,079
- What, you going to coach me 24-7?
- Uh, no...

1025
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:35,022
you're going to, um,
learn these on your own.

1026
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:39,352
There's nothing left
for me to teach you.

1027
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,830
What?

1028
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:48,133
You... you've got it all, Akeelah.
You've got word construction down

1029
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,934
etymology,
memorization techniques.

1030
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:53,703
<i>What you need to do now is just</i>

1031
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:56,644
focus on the words.

1032
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:00,979
I can't learn 5,000 new words
all by myself.

1033
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,485
Oh, yes, you can.
You've got a brain like a sponge.

1034
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:07,319
- You just sit down and you study them.
- Dr. Larabee, I swear, I promise...

1035
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:11,156
<i>I won't miss any more sessions</i>
<i>and I'll do whatever you say.</i>

1036
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,252
You can't stop coaching me now.

1037
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:17,061
I told Mr. Welch I'd get you through
the regionals and I've done that.

1038
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,533
Now, I don't have anything else
I can teach you.

1039
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:22,162
<i>You need to just</i>
<i>take those words</i>

1040
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,399
and study them
and you'll be all right.

1041
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,185
This is why I was at the mall.

1042
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,783
Merry Christmas.

1043
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:04,937
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Hey, girl.</i>

1044
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:08,814
- What you doin'?
<i>- Watching TV.</i>

1045
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:12,446
You want to go skating
this weekend?

1046
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:15,582
<i>Why don't you go with your friends</i>
<i>from Woodland Hills?</i>

1047
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:19,116
What?
Girl, what's wrong with you?

1048
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:21,459
<i>Nothing.</i>

1049
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:24,193
<i>I got homework to do.</i>
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

1050
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:31,768
<i>Hey, Keelie!</i>

1051
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:34,367
<i>Keelie, come on out here!</i>

1052
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,344
<i>Girl, you on TV.</i>

1053
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:38,744
- Hurry. Come on, look!
<i>- Akeelah Anderson's rise</i>

1054
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:42,740
has captivated her community.
All of Los Angeles is talking about her.

1055
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,117
If she wins this spelling bee
it's going to be like

1056
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:48,920
<i>- everybody in the neighborhood wins.</i>
- I think it'll be real positive.

1057
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,552
<i>You know...</i>
<i>good for the community.</i>

1058
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:54,085
I'm already studying
for next year's bee.

1059
01:08:58,667 --> 01:08:59,793
What is wrong with...

1060
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:02,531
Akeelah, what's wrong?

1061
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:05,540
- I don't want to do the bee no more.
- You don't want to do the bee?

1062
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:08,543
- Why not?
- Dr. Larabee don't want

1063
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:11,978
to coach me no more,
Georgia don't want to hang out with me

1064
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:15,643
and all these people are
expecting me to win.

1065
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:20,053
And it's just too hard, Mama.
I want it all to stop.

1066
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:22,023
- Baby, you worked so...
- Please.

1067
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:24,821
- Please.
- All right, all right.

1068
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:37,630
I certainly didn't mean
to upset her. I...

1069
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:42,039
well, I honestly thought I was

1070
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:44,637
doing the best thing for her.

1071
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,022
You know, Dr. Larabee,

1072
01:09:57,059 --> 01:10:00,222
my child is only 11 years old

1073
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:04,255
and she has been through
so much already.

1074
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,325
Her father was killed
when she was six.

1075
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,769
Somebody shot him
on his way home from work.

1076
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:13,366
Do you have any idea what it's like
for a girl to lose her father that way?

1077
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:20,074
I can imagine.

1078
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:23,744
Then why do you want
to cause this child any more grief?

1079
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:26,448
That's an unfair accusation,
Mrs. Anderson.

1080
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:29,013
As I've told you, I'm...

1081
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,492
I'm just not in a place
where I can

1082
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:34,394
be of any more help
to Akeelah right now.

1083
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:37,422
But she needs you.
She does.

1084
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:40,902
I beg to differ, Mrs. Anderson.
It's not me that Akeelah needs.

1085
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,703
<i>I remember when he used</i>
<i>to take us out to the ballgames,</i>

1086
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:51,474
<i>and take us to the movies</i>
<i>and we'd have popcorn fights.</i>

1087
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:54,175
<i>We'll do that again.</i>

1088
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:56,446
<i>Sure.</i>

1089
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:59,113
I want to tell you something.

1090
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:05,151
You know why I didn't want you
to do the bee at first?

1091
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,121
'Cause I saw that video of yours

1092
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:12,531
and I saw one winner
and 200 losers.

1093
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:15,230
And I didn't want you to be
one of those losers.

1094
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:19,273
Did you know your mama

1095
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:22,300
went to college
right after high school?

1096
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:24,175
No.

1097
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:26,704
I had a scholarship.

1098
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:29,149
I was gonna be a doctor.

1099
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:32,582
What happened?

1100
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:38,787
I just felt so out of place
at that school.

1101
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:42,553
I convinced myself

1102
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:45,192
that I was gonna fail.

1103
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:48,670
So before that could happen,
I dropped out.

1104
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:53,798
I don't want you to do
the same thing with this bee.

1105
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:08,246
"Gabbro,"

1106
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:12,522
a group of dark heavy rocks.

1107
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,921
Can you spell it for me?

1108
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:22,398
G-A-B-R-O,

1109
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:24,065
gabbro?

1110
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:26,870
Actually it's got two Bs.

1111
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:34,305
You know, Akeelah, you ain't short
on people who want to help you.

1112
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:39,219
I bet if you just look around,
you got 50,000 coaches.

1113
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:42,747
Starting with me.

1114
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:47,223
- Mama?
- Hmm?

1115
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:49,696
You think that maybe

1116
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:52,292
you might go back to college?

1117
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,538
I just might.

1118
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:02,777
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1119
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:04,506
I love you too.

1120
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:08,676
"Craquelure,"
C-R-A-Q-U-E-L-U...

1121
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:11,845
Hey, yo, so why y'all punking out
on the spelling bee, huh?

1122
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:14,082
What, you afraid of all
the suburbia kids now?

1123
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:16,250
No.

1124
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:18,951
Hey!

1125
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,928
So how you spell
all these words anyway?

1126
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:23,659
- I study them.
- Whatever.

1127
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:26,327
There go my ride.

1128
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:29,030
- Hey, what up, Derrick-T?
- What up, Terrence?

1129
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,868
Who dat?

1130
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,898
That ain't nobody,
just my little sister.

1131
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:35,842
What up, little thing?

1132
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:40,042
I been seeing you on TV.
Trying to win some big contest, huh?

1133
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,277
Answer the man.

1134
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:44,410
<i>You know, I won something once...</i>

1135
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:47,718
fifth grade.
I wrote a poem.

1136
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:50,884
Even got myself
a blue ribbon too.

1137
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,088
- Yeah, good. You wrote yourself a poem.
- Shut up, dawg.

1138
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:58,122
What you think rap is?

1139
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:02,194
- What's that in your hand?
- Ain't nothin', just some stupid word.

1140
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:05,798
- You helping her?
- Naw, man, I'm chilling wit you, right?

1141
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:13,615
Naw, man.

1142
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:17,785
- Stay here and help your sis.
- Why?

1143
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,788
'Cause I say so.

1144
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:21,813
Let's break out, man.

1145
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:27,789
- Derrick-T!
- What's up?

1146
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:31,365
I want to read your poem.

1147
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,891
After you win the contest.

1148
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:35,836
Let's go, man.

1149
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:42,934
You ain't gotta help me
if you don't want to.

1150
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,780
"En-fran-chis-ment"?

1151
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:52,480
- You mean enfranchisement?
- Hey, whatever.

1152
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:55,354
Can you spell it?

1153
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:01,794
50,000 coaches.

1154
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:06,401
E-N-F-R...

1155
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:23,216
"Ap-teery-goat-ti."

1156
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,220
- What?
- That right there.

1157
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:28,746
Apterygote. Maybe you
shouldn't show me the cards.

1158
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,451
Oh yeah. Sorry.

1159
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:58,250
...R-E-S-A...

1160
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:01,051
You go, Akeelah, baby!
Make us proud!

1161
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:29,779
5,000, I learned them all.

1162
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:33,379
But I had some help.

1163
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,289
You should be
very well prepared then.

1164
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:40,227
You know, Dr. Larabee,

1165
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,992
when I was a little girl...

1166
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:46,694
my daddy died.

1167
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,468
I used to cry all the time.

1168
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,341
But then...

1169
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:01,377
I found something that helped.

1170
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:03,611
What was that?

1171
01:17:03,652 --> 01:17:06,746
I spelled... over and over again.

1172
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:08,585
And I'd feel better.

1173
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:14,989
Maybe when you're
thinking of her...

1174
01:17:16,565 --> 01:17:18,965
you can try spelling.

1175
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:21,469
It might help.

1176
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:38,611
Akeelah?

1177
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:44,850
- Who told you?
- You did.

1178
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:47,995
You called me
by her name: Denise.

1179
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:57,801
That's her jump rope, isn't it?

1180
01:17:57,839 --> 01:18:00,467
Yes.

1181
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,002
Was she your little girl?

1182
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:12,077
Yes.

1183
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:16,784
What happened to her?

1184
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:28,129
She got very sick.

1185
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:31,628
She was only a couple of years

1186
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:34,164
younger than you
when she passed.

1187
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:42,575
Where is her mama?

1188
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:46,417
She moved to another city and...

1189
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:50,516
after it happened

1190
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:53,084
my wife...

1191
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:55,995
Patricia and I

1192
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:58,932
found it...

1193
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:02,737
slowly

1194
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:05,137
became very

1195
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:07,471
difficult to be...

1196
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:19,119
Anyway, this is...

1197
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:21,418
this is Patricia's garden.

1198
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:28,756
You see, I need...
I need a lot of order in my life.

1199
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:32,358
That's why I don't teach
in the classrooms anymore.

1200
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,631
It's just too unpredictable.

1201
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,740
<i>Like you.</i>

1202
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,504
This whole spelling bee business
now has become...

1203
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:45,512
a little too unpredictable as well.

1204
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:52,276
Dr. Larabee...

1205
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:57,789
I... I can't go to DC without you.

1206
01:19:57,826 --> 01:20:00,420
Yes, you can, Akeelah.
You can do anything you want.

1207
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,022
- I can't beat Dylan.
<i>- Don't say that.</i>

1208
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:06,329
It's true. It doesn't matter
how many words I learn.

1209
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:08,336
He'll always know more.

1210
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:11,066
Let me tell you about Dylan.

1211
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:15,877
There's only one person
who can push him

1212
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:19,176
to spell as well as he possibly can.

1213
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:23,048
It's not his dad.
It's not the spelling bee people.

1214
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:25,211
It's not even himself.

1215
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:27,983
That person is you.

1216
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,356
So...

1217
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:34,453
when you and I

1218
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,794
get to DC,

1219
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:40,097
let's make sure we give him
a run for his money.

1220
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:42,069
Okay?

1221
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:03,881
Hey.

1222
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,385
Hi.

1223
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:09,192
I'm off to DC tomorrow.

1224
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:13,497
- Yeah, well, have fun.
- I'm sorry I've been so busy.

1225
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,368
It's just this whole spelling
thing's been real intense.

1226
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:19,804
But you know what?

1227
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:24,242
I'd give it all up if it meant
you and me could hang again.

1228
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:26,770
- That's stupid.
- Why's it stupid?

1229
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:29,477
'Cause people want to see you
do good.

1230
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:34,378
I want to see you do good.

1231
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:39,415
You know what?
Georgia, you're my best friend.

1232
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:43,192
And you always tell me I can do things
even when I think I can't.

1233
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:46,663
But I gotta tell you something.

1234
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:50,865
If you want to be a flight attendant,
you first gotta ride on a plane.

1235
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:53,397
I will someday.

1236
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:55,306
How about tomorrow?

1237
01:21:57,712 --> 01:21:59,339
Whoo!

1238
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:03,546
Girl, I got... I got to talk
to the captain.

1239
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:06,986
Oh, forget flight attendant.
I'm gonna be a pilot.

1240
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:12,016
- What's wrong with him?
- He has an aversion to heights.

1241
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:15,791
It's an aversion to plummeting.
I may puke.

1242
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:19,493
My brother's in the air force
and he says that fear

1243
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:21,900
is all in your head. Here.

1244
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:26,431
He gave me this for good luck.
Don't worry... I won't impale you.

1245
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:30,501
You know, I never really thanked you
for helping me at the state bee.

1246
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,809
- No biggie.
- Actually,

1247
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:35,315
it was very chivalrous.

1248
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:40,750
Wow.

1249
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:43,019
I'm not thinking about the plane
at all now.

1250
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:45,583
Well, in that case...

1251
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:31,038
- I told you not to shake it.
- I'm sorry.

1252
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:33,540
Akeelah, I thought you guys
were supposed to be studying.

1253
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:35,202
- We are.
<i>- Huh-uh,</i>

1254
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:37,973
it sounds like a party in here.
Come on, you got a big day tomorrow.

1255
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:40,004
<i>- Better call it a night.</i>
- Half an hour more.

1256
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,346
15 minutes.

1257
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:44,648
What do you think
Dylan's doing now?

1258
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,551
Trying to learn ancient Greek.

1259
01:23:46,588 --> 01:23:49,989
- Maybe we should invite him over.
- That turd-juggler? Forget it.

1260
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,254
I'll be back.

1261
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:56,923
- Yeah...
- Is Dylan here?

1262
01:24:00,268 --> 01:24:03,965
- He's busy.
- Well, um...

1263
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:07,372
me and some of the other kids
are hanging out in my room,

1264
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:11,869
drinking soda pop and watching movies.
We thought maybe he'd like to come over.

1265
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:14,677
I'm sorry, but tomorrow
is the spelling bee.

1266
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,617
Well, you know, sometimes it's okay
to take a little rest

1267
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:20,052
right before the big event, you know?

1268
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:23,615
Well, perhaps that is your strategy,
but not ours.

1269
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,751
Wait wait!

1270
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:29,423
This is for Dylan.

1271
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:37,294
Okay.

1272
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:42,974
<i>"Our deepest fear is not</i>
<i>that we are inadequate.</i>

It's okay. There.

1280
01:25:57,552 --> 01:26:00,453
I'm Ted Saunders, here with
Katie Kerwin-McCrimmen,

1281
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:04,652
broadcasting live from the main ballroom
of the Grand Hyatt, Washington.

1282
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:07,786
<i>Now, Katie, as a former spelling bee</i>
<i>champ yourself, who do you think</i>

1283
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,821
<i>we should be looking for to do well</i>
<i>in this year's competition?</i>

<i>He's come in second</i>
<i>two years in a row.</i>

1287
01:26:18,106 --> 01:26:21,542
Kick his butt, Akeelah!
B-U-T-T, butt.

1288
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:25,205
<i>... but the speller I've really got</i>

<i>a bit of a media sensation</i>

1290
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:30,844

- That's my sister!

1291
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:33,319
<i>... and it's her first try</i>
<i>at the spelling bee circuit.</i>

1292
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:42,445
Could you repeat the word please?

1293
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:45,391
"Ratiocinate, ratiocinate."

1294
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:47,758
What in the hell
kind of word is that?

1295

1299
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,099
Yes.

1300
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:06,974
<i>For an 11-year-old kid,</i>
<i>that is just amazing.</i>

<i>"Oersted."</i>

<i>or C-I-O-U-S.</i>

Is it derived from the Latin word

<i>That's correct.</i>

01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:23,455
Vitrophyre?

1375
01:33:23,497 --> 01:33:26,625
...G-I-N-O-U-S,

1376
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:28,794
- serpiginous.
<i>- That's correct.</i>

1377
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:29,928
Yes!

1378
01:33:32,673 --> 01:33:34,607
That's my baby.

1379
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:45,246
<i>We're going to take a small break</i>
<i>before Akeelah and Dylan</i>

1380
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:47,846
commence with
the championship-level words.

1381
01:34:04,672 --> 01:34:06,640
Pretty good, huh?

1382
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:17,183
<i>Make sure you stay focused, right?</i>

1383
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:20,551
This is your last
national spelling bee.

1384
01:34:20,588 --> 01:34:24,524
If you lose to that girl,
you're second place your whole life.

1385
01:34:24,558 --> 01:34:27,527
<i>No way! You hear me?</i>

1386
01:34:27,561 --> 01:34:30,394
- No way!
- Peeking on someone?

1387
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:33,558
Just wishing Dylan good luck.

1388
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:36,661
You've done a superb job.
I am so proud of you.

1389
01:34:36,704 --> 01:34:40,902
Now listen, they're going to hit you
with every trick word they've got.

1390
01:34:40,941 --> 01:34:43,341
You just remember
the things that we've studied.

1391
01:34:43,377 --> 01:34:46,574
You can take these words apart
even if you've never seen them, right?

1392
01:34:47,715 --> 01:34:51,082
But if I don't beat Dylan,
I've still got next year, right?

1393
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:53,552
Well, of course you do.
Although I don't know

1394
01:34:53,587 --> 01:34:56,055
how much time
we'll have to train together.

1395
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:59,992
I've been asked to come back
and teach at UCLA, and I've said yes.

1396
01:35:01,328 --> 01:35:04,092
- Really?
- Well, far be it from me to deny

1397
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:09,034
the next WEB DuBois the benefits
of my acerbic wit and sour disposition.

1398
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:22,516
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, Dr. Larabee.

1399
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,882
I should get back.

1400
01:35:24,919 --> 01:35:27,786
No matter what happens...

1401
01:35:29,123 --> 01:35:33,253
I want you to know that I couldn't
have gotten this far without you.

1402
01:35:34,929 --> 01:35:37,056
Akeelah, baby, there you are.
Come on.

1403
01:35:37,098 --> 01:35:38,759
I gotta go.

1404
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:42,633
They're about to start up again.

1405
01:35:53,948 --> 01:35:57,509
Don't look so nervous.
I hear she had a pretty good coach.

1406
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:04,352
You know, I just found out that the bee
only gives each kid two plane tickets.

1407
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:07,485
I was wondering how we
ended up with six.

1408
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:10,088
Uh...

1409
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:12,122
perhaps it was some

1410
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:15,226
unexpected largess
on the part of the bee.

1411
01:36:17,004 --> 01:36:21,634
Or perhaps Akeelah's coach
is also pretty generous.

1412
01:36:25,546 --> 01:36:27,343
Thanks.

1413
01:36:27,381 --> 01:36:29,611
For everything.

1414
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:33,415
- You're welcome.
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1415
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:36,890
let's welcome Akeelah and Dylan
back to the stage.

1416
01:36:37,925 --> 01:36:40,587
<i>Now remember,</i>
<i>if either speller misses a word,</i>

1417
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:43,028
the other has to spell
that missed word

1418
01:36:43,063 --> 01:36:45,793
<i>- plus another to win, right?</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

1419
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:49,360
And we could exhaust
all 25 championship words.

1420
01:36:49,403 --> 01:36:51,064
<i>But it's never happened.</i>

1421
01:36:51,105 --> 01:36:53,630
<i>The championship words</i>
<i>are just too difficult.</i>

1422
01:36:53,674 --> 01:36:56,939
- "Filiopietistic."
- Can I have the definition please?

1423
01:36:56,977 --> 01:36:59,537
<i>Of, or relating to,</i>
<i>an often excessive</i>

1424
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:02,140
<i>veneration</i>
<i>of ancestors or tradition.</i>

1425
01:37:02,183 --> 01:37:03,946
Filiopietistic:

1426
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:06,976
F-I...

1427
01:37:07,021 --> 01:37:10,218
<i>L-I...</i>

1428
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:30,837
Akeelah, you're up.

1429
01:37:37,885 --> 01:37:39,546
"Xanthosis."

1430
01:37:39,587 --> 01:37:43,523
- Xanthosis?
- It starts with an X.

1431
01:38:02,743 --> 01:38:04,540
Miss Anderson?

1432
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,915
Xanthosis:

1433
01:38:14,955 --> 01:38:18,220
Z-A-N...

1434
01:38:18,259 --> 01:38:21,092
<i>T-H-O...</i>

01:38:24,498 --> 01:38:27,490
xanthosis.

1437
01:38:41,582 --> 01:38:43,675
<i>Dylan, it's your turn.</i>

1438
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:52,255
"Xanthosis."

1439
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:07,730
Xanthosis:

1440
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:10,039
<i>X-A-N...</i>

1441

1442
01:39:17,217 --> 01:39:20,414
E-S, xanthosis.

01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:30,191
<i>T-H-O-S-I-S.</i>

1446
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,425
Can I get some water, please?

1447
01:39:35,469 --> 01:39:37,801
Can we please get
both spellers some water?

1448
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:46,538
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1449
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:48,878
- You just threw that word.
- So did you.

1450
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:51,111
You're just gonna
give this all away?

1451
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:52,948
Your dad will be happy.

1452
01:39:54,288 --> 01:39:58,088
Who cares? He's never
won anything in his life.

1453
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:00,685
I won the regionals
three times in a row.

1454
01:40:00,728 --> 01:40:03,390
And I finished second
in the nationals twice.

1455
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:06,866
And now you can finish first.
I could do it next year.

1456
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:10,199
- You do your best this year.
- Dylan...

1457
01:40:10,237 --> 01:40:11,829
You do your best...

1458
01:40:11,872 --> 01:40:13,635
or I don't want it.

1459
01:40:15,476 --> 01:40:17,171
<i>Here's your water.</i>

1460
01:40:23,784 --> 01:40:27,345
That's kind of amazing, isn't it,
that both of these incredible spellers

1461
01:40:27,388 --> 01:40:29,083
<i>would stumble on that word?</i>

1462
01:40:29,123 --> 01:40:31,717
<i>I think we've got some</i>
<i>pretty nervous kids up there.</i>

1463
01:40:31,759 --> 01:40:35,695
"Effleurage" or "effleurage."

1464
01:40:39,833 --> 01:40:43,701
E-F-F-L-E-U...

R-A-G-E,

1466
01:40:45,839 --> 01:40:48,535
- effleurage.
- That's correct.

1467
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:54,577
<i>This is just like watching</i>
<i>two star tennis players</i>

1468
01:40:54,615 --> 01:40:58,210
<i>at the net returning volleys.</i>
<i>I mean, these kids are incredible.</i>

1469
01:40:58,252 --> 01:41:02,188
Lagniappe: L-A-G-N-I-A-P-P-E,
lagniappe.

1470
01:41:02,222 --> 01:41:04,190
- Sumpsimus.
- Could you use it in a sentence please?

1471
01:41:04,224 --> 01:41:05,691
- Is that a verb?
- Ophelimity.

1472
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:07,387
- Tralatitious.
- That is correct.

1473
01:41:07,428 --> 01:41:09,123
- Sophrosyne.
- Parrhesia.

1474
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:10,892
- Is that Greek?
- Was that Latin?

1475
01:41:10,931 --> 01:41:12,023
- What's the language...
...of origin please?

1476
01:41:12,066 --> 01:41:13,465
- Lyophilize.
- Zarzuela.

1477
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,024
- Vibrissae.
- Craquelure.

1478
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:16,400
That's correct.

1479
01:41:16,437 --> 01:41:19,497
<i>These kids a chewing through</i>
<i>these super-tough words</i>

1480
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:21,599
<i>like they were breakfast cereal.</i>

1481
01:41:21,642 --> 01:41:24,076
<i>You know, they could</i>
<i>actually go the distance,</i>

1482
01:41:24,111 --> 01:41:26,909
<i>and most people</i>
<i>consider that unthinkable.</i>

1483
01:41:26,947 --> 01:41:30,246
We're now 13 words
into the championship level.

1484
01:41:30,284 --> 01:41:34,220
If you make it through the remaining
12 words, you'll be co-champions.

1485
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:37,155
<i>That's never happened before.</i>

1486
01:41:37,191 --> 01:41:38,783

- Ecdysis.

1487
01:41:38,826 --> 01:41:40,316
- Concitato.
- Puerpera.

1488
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,191
That's correct.

1489
01:41:42,229 --> 01:41:44,754
<i>Dylan and Akeelah are</i>
<i>trying to stage a miracle here.</i>

1490

<i>And to make it to the finish line</i>

Dylan, you're up.

1502
01:42:41,288 --> 01:42:44,451
- "Logorrhea."
- May I have the definition please?

1503
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:47,324
<i>Logorrhea is excessive</i>

<i>Congratulations, Dylan,</i>

"Pulchritude."

Pulchritude.

1519
01:43:58,432 --> 01:44:02,027
It's derived from
the Latin word "pulcher,"

1520
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:04,902
<i>meaning beautiful,</i>

Congratulations, Akeelah.

1529
01:44:28,195 --> 01:44:30,629
That's what I'm talking about!

1530
01:44:32,966 --> 01:44:36,129
<i>You know that feeling</i>
<i>where everything feels right?</i>

1531
01:44:36,169 --> 01:44:39,570
<i>Where you don't have to worry</i>
<i>about tomorrow</i>

1532
01:44:39,606 --> 01:44:41,403
<i>or yesterday,</i>

1533
01:44:41,441 --> 01:44:44,933
<i>but you feel safe and know</i>
<i>you're doing the best you can?</i>

1534
01:44:44,978 --> 01:44:47,674
<i>There's a word for that feeling.</i>

1535
01:44:47,714 --> 01:44:50,205
<i>It's called love.</i>

1536
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:53,617
<i>L-O-V-E.</i>

1537
01:44:53,654 --> 01:44:56,248
<i>And it's what I feel for all my family,</i>

1538
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:59,487
<i>and all my coaches</i>
<i>in my neighborhood,</i>

1539
01:44:59,526 --> 01:45:01,494
<i>where I come from,</i>

1540
01:45:01,528 --> 01:45:05,464
<i>where I learned how to spell.</i>

1541
01:45:24,785 --> 01:45:26,650
We did it.

1542
01:49:42,075 --> 01:49:44,043
<i>Thank you.</i>
