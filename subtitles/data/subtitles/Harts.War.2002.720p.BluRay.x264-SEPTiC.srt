1
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,300
On the other side
of the world...

2
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,960
in Europe the Allied forces
are pounding the Germans...

3
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,800
with relentless force.

4
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,640
We do not expect to have
a winter lull in Europe.

5
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,970
We expect to
keep striking...

6
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,640
to keep the enemy
on the move...

7
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,150
and hit him again
and again.

8
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,480
1944, December.

9
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,640
I was miles
from the front...

10
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,310
and a stranger to war.

11
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,980
Troops, fuel dumps...

12
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,150
enemy units...

13
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,160
they were pins
on a map to me.

14
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,350
Champagne?

15
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,830
Are you trying
to score a few points?

16
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,990
Just trying to aid
the war effort, Hart.

17
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,160
Tom.

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,320
Sir.

19
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,660
The captain needs a lift
back to the 106th.

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,170
Can you find him a driver?

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,000
I can take him, sir.

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,660
Funny. I had a feeling
you'd say that.

23
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,670
Well, there hasn't been
much movement today, sir.

24
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,500
So I see. Captain.

25
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,670
Oh, don't forget, sir.

26
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,230
You wanted to send some of that
champagne along as well.

27
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,510
Yes.

28
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,480
Yes, thank you
for reminding me, Tom.

29
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,140
The general should get
a kick out of that.

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,620
Colonel.

31
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,790
Troops are now fighting...

32
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,460
along a battle line
of 300 miles in Poland...

33
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,470
France, and Germany.

34
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,970
Within 10 weeks
after the first landings

35
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,310
in France last June,

36
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,470
the Allies have landed
nearly 2 million men.

37
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,650
You know what
this army could use, sir?

38
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,990
Snowplow services.

39
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,150
What we could use...

40
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,490
is half a million gallons
of gasoline...

41
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,830
and a road
that wasn't paved...

42
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,020
for Bouncing Betties.

43
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,670
German S-mines.

44
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,860
Yes, sir.

45
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,000
You really ought
to spend a night...

46
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,200
on the line sometime,
Lieutenant.

47
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,170
I know that, sir.

48
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,840
Of course,
it's not too likely, is it?

49
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,040
Sir?

50
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,170
The Colonel says
your father is a senator.

51
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,680
So I guess you won't
spend too many nights...

52
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,210
in a foxhole, will you?

53
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,630
It's nothing
to be ashamed of, son.

54
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,500
That's a hell
of a father to have.

55
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,020
-Where to, sir?
-St. Vith.

56
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,160
I'm afraid you've gone
the wrong way, sir.

57
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,530
St. Vith is due west.

58
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,530
I'm pretty sure
St. Vith is due east.

59
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,540
Sergeant,
it's straight ahead.

60
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,530
Can I see that, sir?

61
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,840
I drove this route
yesterday, Sergeant.

62
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,050
Mm-hmm.

63
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,000
Get your hands up.

64
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,670
Out!

65
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,860
Halt!

66
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,150
Are you in great pain?

67
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,280
First Lieutenant...

68
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,120
Thomas Hart.

69
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,320
Serial number...

70
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,150
1841287.

71
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,670
Would you care
for a cigarette?

72
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,660
Your train is
an 8 kilometer march from here.

73
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,470
Of course,
with some shoes on...

74
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,670
you might be all right.

75
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,490
First Lieutenant...

76
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,690
Thomas Hart.

77
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,020
Serial number 1841287.

78
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,660
Thank you, Lieutenant.

79
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,330
But we both know...

80
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,200
there is much more
to you than that.

81
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,980
Show me locations
of the fuel dumps.

82
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,610
Just point...

83
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,980
and we can end all this.

84
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,840
I'll have your clothes
returned to you immediately.

85
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,510
When you are dressed,
we'll have another chat.

86
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,520
Our last one, I hope.

87
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,610
Smile, Joe.

88
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,080
For you the war is over.

89
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,360
Lieutenant.

90
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,540
This will help
against the cold.

91
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,670
No thanks, soldier.

92
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,840
I'll be all right.

93
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,000
No, you won't.

94
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,170
Come on. Take it.

95
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,680
Just till you warm up.

96
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,840
Take it, sir.

97
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,130
Hey, Captain...

98
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,970
does somebody tell our folks
about us being captured?

99
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,630
Germans give a list
to the military...

100
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,800
and the military
notifies the family.

101
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,170
Is that voluntary, sir?

102
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,820
How do you mean,
Lieutenant?

103
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,650
Uh, I mean...

104
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,020
can you ask them not to?

105
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,690
I don't think so.

106
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,890
Have to put
some straw in there.

107
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,190
Straw in your shoes...

108
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,390
for frostbite.

109
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,220
Another slave detail, sir.

110
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,060
Hey, ladies...

111
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,560
next batch of shells
you turn out...

112
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,730
nothing but duds
this time, all right?

113
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,600
Mortars no boom boom, ja?

114
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,570
Fire!

115
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,670
Captain, P-51 incoming.

116
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,010
-Incoming!
-Ours?

117
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,170
Get down, everybody!

118
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,370
Get down!

119
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,450
Everybody stay down!

120
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,650
Keep low!

121
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,870
Captain, what's happening?

122
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,040
Why are they
shooting at us?

123
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,240
They can't read the roof.

124
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,380
All right, get the doors!

125
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,720
Everybody get the doors!

126
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,910
Come on, now!

127
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,920
Get down!

128
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,130
Get down! Down!

129
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,260
Hart, help out!

130
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,970
-Come on!
-Go! Go! Go!

131
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,400
Go on, now!
Let's go!

132
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,700
Moving out!

133
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,510
Get the other cars!

134
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,050
Get the other cars!

135
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,380
Let's go! Now!

136
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,150
We're spelling out!

137
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,380
Round up your men now!

138
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,390
We're spelling out
our position!

139
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,590
We're spelling out!

140
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,060
Hart, get that man
clear of here.

141
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,720
Let's get in line!

142
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,230
Assemble on me!

143
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,330
-Assemble!
-Move it! Move it!

144
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,910
All right, men!

145
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,470
Let's get back in line!

146
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,040
Move it!

147
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,020
It's not helping.

148
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,250
Come on, men!

149
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,190
Oh, Christ.

150
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,290
Are you OK?

151
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,950
Keep looking at me.
Look at me.

152
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,160
Look at me.

153
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,090
Oh, shit. Shit.

154
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,510
All right.
Are you all right?

155
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,370
They're telling us to march.

156
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,240
Probably ought to take
his boots, Lieutenant.

157
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,840
Lieutenant!

158
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,840
Take his boots.

159
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,680
'Cause either you
or some Jerry's gonna get 'em.

160
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,840
Take 'em, sir...

161
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,540
while you still got feet
to put 'em on.

162
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,010
His socks, too.

163
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,380
Ain't gonna help him any.

164
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,380
Stay together.

165
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,050
All right.

166
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,010
Once again...

167
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,690
I'm forced to remind you
escape is not a sport.

168
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,700
Think of it this way.

169
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,840
Now these Russians
have a chance...

170
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,370
at a happy new year.

171
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,550
Those are dogs
you're saluting, Colonel.

172
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,240
Animals.

173
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,210
My country doesn't make...

174
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,720
those kinds of
distinctions, Colonel.

175
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,030
They're our allies, Colonel.

176
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,520
Oh, yes.
You and your allies.

177
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,700
Let me tell you
about you and your allies.

178
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,170
The Ministry of War
has just released the figures...

179
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,870
from our offensive
in the Ardennes.

180
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,350
Two hundred thousand Allies
killed or captured.

181
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,510
Your Third Army--

182
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,680
Patton--
in full retreat.

183
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,180
And the wehrmacht has captured
enough abundant fuel...

184
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,520
to retake Paris--

185
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,050
perhaps even drive
your troops back to the sea.

186
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,240
Might be a bit crowded
around here this winter.

187
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,490
Turn around, Joes.

188
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,620
Yes. Turn around.

189
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,360
Ross. Hart.

190
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,000
Ross and Hart.

191
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,200
I'm Captain Ross.

192
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,840
Major Clary.

193
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,010
Lieutenant Hart.

194
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,850
Lieutenant.

195
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,350
Debriefing, gentleman.
Officer's hut.

196
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,110
On the double.

197
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,090
The German counterattack on
the American Third Army front...

198
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:37,680
The German counterattack on
the American Third Army front...

199
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,850
is still going on.

200
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,020
The entire front...

201
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,190
stretching about
30 miles south of Monschau...

202
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,350
is in full view.

203
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,700
On our side,
countermeasures are being taken.

204
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,040
On the enemy's side,
more strafes are being flown in.

205
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,380
This is a major German effort.

206
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,040
Some of the best units
in the German army...

207
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,570
were involved
in this penetration.

208
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,210
At ease, soldier.

209
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,410
Sit down.

210
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,750
Thank you, sir.

211
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,930
So tell me, Lieutenant...

212
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,930
How come you're not dead?

213
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,930
Sir?

214
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,060
First you survive
crashing that jeep...

215
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,230
then Hans and Fritz
take your boots.

216
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,100
You got a rabbit's foot
in your pocket, son?

217
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,240
Two horseshoes
and a 4-leaf clover, sir.

218
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,440
Atta boy.

219
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,570
By the way...

220
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,950
you might want to take it easy
on that bread.

221
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,420
You haven't had anything
solid for a while.

222
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,580
Wouldn't want you to wind up
in the infirmary.

223
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,780
I don't know, sir.

224
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,930
After the march I just made...

225
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,300
and infirmary might look
like the Waldorf to me.

226
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,970
A stomach can shrink
quite a bit in 17 days.

227
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,940
That's the number, isn't it?

228
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,450
Seventeen days?

229
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,280
Six days on the train...

230
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,120
another 6 days of marching.

231
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,620
What was it, Joe?

232
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,820
Five days of interrogation?

233
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,820
No, sir.

234
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,420
Three days.

235
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,420
Well, anyway...
easy does it.

236
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,430
Yes, sir. Thank you.

237
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,730
So this interrogator
they threw at you...

238
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,110
his name wasn't Schumann,
was it?

239
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,110
No, sir.

240
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,610
Lutz.

241
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,950
Schumann was a real prick.

242
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,130
Almost broke me in two.

243
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,360
Not much for small talk,
I guess.

244
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,300
You come to appreciate that.

245
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,230
Smoke, Lieutenant?

246
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,410
Would you care
for a cigarette?

247
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,400
Again, Lieutenant,
I need to ask you...

248
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,410
the fuel dumps...

249
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,910
Thank you.

250
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,890
This Captain Lutz...

251
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,090
he know much about
your operations at the chateau?

252
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,100
He knew everything, sir.

253
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,070
Fuel dump locations?

254
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,270
Troop movements?

255
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,740
Sir, he knew what
I'd had for breakfast...

256
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,080
the morning of my capture.

257
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,950
Point,
and we can end all this.

258
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,900
Just name, rank,
and serial number.

259
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,570
Good enough.

260
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,240
You're excused, Lieutenant.

261
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,880
Unfortunately,
we won't be able...

262
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,040
to quarter you here.

263
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,210
We're full up.

264
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,810
We're gonna have to
put you in Barracks 27.

265
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,560
Isn't barracks 27
for enlisted men, sir?

266
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,720
Yes, it is...

267
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,880
but as you can see...

268
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,100
the Germans are doing a rather
brisk business these days.

269
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,270
You'll be comfortable there.

270
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,600
Sir.

271
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,780
-Lieutenant.
-Sir.

272
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,080
Point.

273
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,400
Point or say
hello to stumps...

274
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,600
for the rest
of your life.

275
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,610
Good.

276
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,420
Don, are you in?
I called.

277
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:44,830
Hold your water, Joe.

278
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,800
Hold your water, Joe.

279
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,960
Looks like a whole division
just surrendered.

280
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,960
Who's in charge here?

281
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,430
Hey, how many we up to?

282
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,100
Three lovely ladies,
big shot.

283
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,270
That's right.

284
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,370
That's right.

285
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,880
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

286
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,710
I'm looking for
who's in charge here.

287
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,580
From the looks of things,
I'd say Adolf Hitler.

288
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,420
I'm Lieutenant Tom Hart.

289
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,580
It's OK, folks.

290
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,230
Staff Sergeant Vic Bedford.

291
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,900
-Good to meet you.
-You, too.

292
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,560
You just come in
from Ardennes?

293
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,730
Yeah.

294
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,900
Colonel sent me over
to bunk in here.

295
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,430
Officers' barracks are full.

296
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,610
Well, in that case,
welcome to Rio.

297
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,070
Hope you don't mind, sir.

298
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,450
All we have is this
middle bunk right here.

299
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,080
It looks fine.

300
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,250
I'm betting you're
a Lucky Strike man.

301
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,090
You bet right.

302
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,250
Care for some hooch,
Lieutenant?

303
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,590
Ringing in the new year.

304
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,250
Uh, thanks. I'm fine.

305
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,760
It's fermented raisins,
mostly.

306
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,590
A little turpentine
thrown in for flavor.

307
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,760
I'm fine.

308
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,770
We got anybody
left up front, sir?

309
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,770
How are you doing,
Lieutenant?

310
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,600
Private.

311
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,270
Give him a break, fellas.
He just got here.

312
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,770
Lieutenant.

313
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,940
Guard 'em with your life.

314
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,100
They double for cash
around here--

315
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,270
especially with the guards.

316
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,800
-Thanks, Sergeant.
-Excuse me a second.

317
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,410
Fellas, listen up.

318
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,210
Lieutenant Hart here...

319
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,050
is going to be staying
with us for a while.

320
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,920
-Hello, sir.
-Men.

321
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,930
Say, what's it take
to get in that poker game?

322
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,570
I expect we can work
something out.

323
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,400
Good.

324
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,410
Sir, are you about a size 10?

325
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,570
Why?

326
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,270
They got a Woolworth's
behind one of these barracks?

327
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,610
You never know.

328
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,410
Just piss on him, sir.

329
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,580
Huh?

330
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,950
It's the only thing
that gets him moving.

331
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,280
Happy New Year.

332
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,440
New year.

333
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,310
It's 1945!

334
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,640
Happy New Year!

335
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,600
Ten and a half
is the best I could do.

336
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,440
The holiday season.

337
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,430
Look at the smile
on this guy.

338
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,930
Socks, too.

339
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,490
Could have used those
in the...

340
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,600
What's the matter,
you don't like trench foot?

341
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,270
Sure, it's just that
once my toenails turned black...

342
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,140
I didn't have a single purse
that matched.

343
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,790
Square 'em up, Major.

344
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,990
Yes, sir.

345
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,940
Look at this.

346
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,310
They've got those poor bastards
going around the clock now.

347
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:19,070
See that factory
up past the North tower?

348
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,240
The Germans are making bombs
right under our noses.

349
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,650
It's supposed to be
a shoe factory.

350
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,150
Instead, they've got the
Russians running in and out...

351
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,750
making mortar shells.

352
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,150
What the hell is that?

353
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,930
One of their flyers.

354
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,330
Wait a minute, they've got
niggers flying airplanes, now?

355
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,670
Three hundred and thirty-second
Fight Squadron.

356
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,070
I read about them
in ''Yank Magazine.''

357
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,060
I'll be damned.

358
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,700
Well, we got us
some nigger officers.

359
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,700
Fucking Jerry's right.
We must be losing this war.

360
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,260
Five, 6, 7, 8. Lift! Lift!

361
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,350
-Lieutenant.
-Sir.

362
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,060
Looks like it'll be a good show.

363
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,080
Yeah, it does.

364
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,360
It's high stakes
around here, sir.

365
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,020
What do you mean?

366
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,830
Half the smokes in camp
are riding on...

367
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,360
where you're putting
the new men.

368
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,370
Where do you think
we should put them?

369
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,020
I think I'd give them
their own billet tent, sir.

370
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,820
Well, we can't do that.

371
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,960
I was thinking about
putting them in 27 with you.

372
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,300
Sir, wouldn't they be better off
in the officers' barracks?

373
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,010
I don't carry enough weight
to move 2 officers out of 22.

374
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,510
I can't make them
the only 2 officers...

375
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,170
in the enlisted men's barracks.

376
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,450
You're in 27.

377
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,450
Figure you can keep
an eye on them for me.

378
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,350
Sir, I'm still new
to that barracks.

379
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,290
Don't carry a lot of weight
with the men yet.

380
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,020
You've got bars
on your shoulder, Lieutenant.

381
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,620
That ought to be weight enough.

382
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,960
Be done. Come on.

383
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,090
Tastes like chicken, right?

384
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,190
No, you've got maggots.

385
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,670
It's protein. Eat.

386
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,330
-You called?
-Yeah.

387
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,030
What do you got?

388
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,910
Gonna have to to make
some room in here, fellas.

389
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,010
Come on in, men.

390
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,550
We got 2 more guests.

391
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,390
Second Lieutenants
Lamar Archer and Lincoln Scott.

392
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,400
You've got to be kidding, sir.

393
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,430
They're gonna live here?

394
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,640
Two officers just
entered the barracks.

395
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,740
Where's your salute?

396
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,170
What's the big idea, sir?

397
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,930
I mean, we're all
full up in here.

398
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,600
Not anymore.

399
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,230
-Croutch, Krasner.
-Yes, sir.

400
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,110
You've been reassigned.
Barracks 28.

401
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,050
The Colonel wants you
situated before lockdown.

402
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,860
What were you flying?

403
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,230
P-51 bomber escorts.

404
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,870
Must be a shitload
of dead bomber crews...

405
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,200
scattered across Europe.

406
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,060
You see these bars,
Sergeant?

407
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,540
A pair of bars
don't make you fit to share...

408
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,040
the same roof
with white folks, boy.

409
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,040
Bedford!

410
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,940
That's Lieutenant, boy.
You got that?

411
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,470
Call yourself
whatever you want.

412
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,140
You're still just
a nigger to me.

413
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,380
I didn't quite catch that,
Sergeant.

414
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,980
-What was that?
-All right!

415
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,610
-That's enough!
-Just let it go.

416
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,670
Set, go!

417
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,030
Over--Over here!

418
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,060
Nice. Very nice!

419
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,960
Uh-oh! Deadline.

420
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,960
Lieutenant!
Mind grabbing that, boy?

421
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,340
What are you doing?

422
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,220
Nice one, sir!

423
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,950
Cookie, hey!

424
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,550
More bread.
More bread.

425
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,860
Das ist verboten!

426
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,060
Das ist verboten, Bedford!

427
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,130
Bon appetit!

428
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,530
Shit!

429
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,110
Nobody moves!

430
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,410
How bad, Sergeant?

431
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,220
Yeah, it's just a nick.
I'll be fine.

432
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,220
-You all right?
-Yeah.

433
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,980
Fuck 'em !

434
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,740
-Go get that hand looked at.
-Yes, sir.

435
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,180
Hey, Bed.

436
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,770
Cigarettes?

437
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,420
You're a regular bank, Vic.

438
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,550
How's the hand?

439
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,210
Is that really what you
came over here to ask me?

440
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,780
No. Major Clary told me
that you went to see him...

441
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,120
to lodge a complaint about
Lieutenants Archer and Scott.

442
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,060
I'm sure he'll take it up with
Eisenhower first chance he gets.

443
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,490
They don't belong here.

444
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,860
Nobody belongs here.

445
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,170
But this is where
the colonel put them.

446
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,900
Yeah. I bet you wish the colonel
would have given you...

447
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,640
that open bunk
in the officers' barracks...

448
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,230
right about now, Lieutenant.

449
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,310
I mean, this is hardly
the Waldorf.

450
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,040
Ain't that right?

451
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,710
We're not going
to have a problem...

452
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,810
about this, Sergeant,
understood?

453
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,380
What did you do before the war
for a living?

454
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,900
I was in law school.
Second year.

455
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,960
Harvard?

456
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,990
Yale.

457
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,340
-Meet many coloreds up there?
-A few.

458
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,470
Yeah, well,
I dealt with their kind.

459
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,350
Two years I was
on the police force...

460
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,910
in East St. Louis,
and I know what they are.

461
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,850
So let's not pretend like
we're fucking neighbors.

462
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,360
You finished, Sergeant?

463
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,820
No, I'm not finished.

464
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,020
Never did settle on a price,
did we...

465
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,360
for them boots and socks?

466
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,630
I mean, might be as cold as
the North Pole around here...

467
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,100
but that don't make me
Santa Claus.

468
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,370
What do you want?

469
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,370
I'll take your watch.

470
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,340
This was a gift from my father.

471
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,910
I bet your daddy
can afford you another one.

472
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,960
Is this going to buy me
a little civility, Sergeant?

473
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,270
Tons.

474
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,990
Not much of a picture, is it?

475
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,320
Well, we do feel
a little misled, sir.

476
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,460
Guard told us
they'd be showing...

477
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,960
the life and time
of Jesse Owens.

478
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,970
You know, you men can sit
up front with everyone else.

479
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,280
We're fine, sir.

480
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,750
Nobody's going to bother you.

481
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,650
I said we're fine, sir.

482
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,760
That was nice, C.W.
That was 18 inches.

483
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,930
Ah, come on, Joe.
It was 2 feet, at least.

484
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,370
Hey, either way,
my record still stands.

485
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,430
Cut it out, you guys.

486
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,500
Up, up, up.

487
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,710
Everybody.
Out of the way.

488
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,910
-Out!
-Out of the bunks.

489
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,910
Attention.

490
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,430
Attention near the bunks.

491
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,930
Now.

492
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,530
Who is the ranking man in here?

493
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,000
Lieutenant Thomas Hart.

494
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,270
One of your men was out on the
compound tonight, Lieutenant.

495
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,900
He was spotted
on the East field...

496
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,070
removing a spike from
one of the billet tents.

497
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,310
Your men are aware of
this camp's policy...

498
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,550
concerning the possession
and concealment of weapons...

499
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,750
are they not?

500
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,990
Major, no one has
left this barracks.

501
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,080
Whoa, wait a minute.
What the hell--

502
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,090
Quiet.

503
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,750
-But this is a plant.
-Quiet.

504
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,050
-Somebody put that--
-Quiet.

505
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,590
You bastard, I heard you go out.

506
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,690
I should have seen this coming.

507
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,570
Major, where are
you taking this man?

508
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:21,770
Examples must be made,
Lieutenant.

509
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:24,500
We take the safety of
our men very seriously.

510
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,570
Major, where are you all
taking him?

511
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,680
What did he do?

512
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,580
I'll kill you.

513
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,680
I'll fucking kill you, Bedford.

514
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,090
You put that spike--

515
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,680
Watch your mouth, nigger.

516
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,720
You put that spike there.
Get off of me.

517
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,230
-Lincoln, look at me.
-Get off of me.

518
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:46,930
Can I let you go, Lincoln?

519
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,880
It's a minor offense, Colonel.

520
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,320
This man deserved 15 days
in the cooler, not execution.

521
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,480
He attempted to escape.

522
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,960
Bullshit.

523
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,250
You dragged him out of his
barracks barely clothed.

524
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,060
Your men lined him up
and shot him.

525
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:03,560
This man wasn't trying
to escape...

526
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,860
any more than those Russians
you hung the other day.

527
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,920
Is he a dog?

528
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,330
A lesser race?

529
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:14,040
There's a word you
Americans use, as I remember.

530
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:18,880
But of course, your country
doesn't make such distinctions.

531
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,340
And neither do you, I'm sure.

532
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,440
He was an officer...

533
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,940
a lieutenant in
the Army Air Corps.

534
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:28,980
Yeah. That's why you were
so eager...

535
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,490
to welcome him and the other one
into your barracks.

536
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,250
Look it up, Colonel.

537
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:35,950
We have every right
to question a man...

538
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,400
for concealment of
a dangerous weapon.

539
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:39,990
This man had rights, too.

540
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:42,060
The Geneva Convention...

541
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,540
specifically forbids
summary executions.

542
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,210
Take a look around you, Colonel.

543
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,680
This is not Geneva.

544
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,320
Where are you going?

545
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,590
To check on my men.

546
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,190
You're welcome to do so,
of course.

547
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,500
In the meantime, I'll be looking
in on your barracks...

548
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,630
to listen to what's on
the B.B.C. this evening.

549
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:06,360
Now go see your men, Colonel.

550
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:10,130
Good night.

551
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,540
Not to love the Fuhrer
is a great disgrace

552
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:50,920
so we heil, heil
right in the Fuhrer's face

553
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:57,250
Is we not the super friend?

554
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,280
Aryan pure supermen?

555
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,300
Ja, we is der supermen

556
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,300
Super-duper supermen

557
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,230
Is this Nazi land

558
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:05,430
Let's go.

559
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,700
How's Scott holding up?

560
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,270
It's hard to tell.

561
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:18,470
He isn't saying much.

562
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,150
He was asking about the body.

563
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:25,620
And there's some personal
effects--dog tags.

564
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,850
Come on, boys.

565
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:14,810
Take that, you bastard.

566
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,340
Careful, Bedford.

567
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,410
That's a nigger
you're rooting for.

568
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,210
Tail's painted red...

569
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,420
means he's 99th,
right out of Tuskegee, boy.

570
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,320
Come on, let's get him out!

571
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,950
Get them out of there.

572
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,560
Get him to the doc, now.

573
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:03,900
Put this out. Come on!

574
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,640
More buckets, more buckets.
Quickly, come on.

575
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,940
Come on!

576
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,050
-Move around this corner.
-Yes, sir.

577
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:44,920
Do you know where
I wish I'd never been?

578
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,120
Where's that?

579
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,560
The goddamn Waldorf.

580
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:51,520
It's not personal.

581
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:54,260
He just can't stand
being lied to.

582
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,700
-I never lied to him.
-Go on.

583
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,210
You hung yourself the minute
he debriefed you.

584
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:02,970
That guy Lutz
they threw on you...

585
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,470
he was a level 1 interrogator.

586
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:07,880
McNamara had him, too.

587
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,380
When a guy won't talk, they just
keep kicking him up the ladder.

588
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,130
Level 2, level 3.

589
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:16,260
It takes weeks.

590
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,900
He was in there for a month.

591
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,800
The only guy you saw was Lutz...

592
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:24,310
and he spit you out of there
in 3 days.

593
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,440
All I gave them was name,
rank, and serial number.

594
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,640
See, the thing about the colonel
is he's not like you and me.

595
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,450
He's West Point,
fourth generation.

596
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:36,450
He was raised on all this.

597
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,990
The crap like this...

598
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,490
catching a junior officer
in an obvious lie...

599
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:44,990
all it does is remind him
of how far away he is...

600
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:46,360
from the real war...

601
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:49,020
the one he's supposed
to be fighting.

602
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,670
You see?

603
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:36,150
Lieutenant Lincoln.

604
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,430
Should have sold some tickets
for this one.

605
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,390
Two of your men dead
in 2 days, Colonel.

606
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:36,050
It seems you've lost control
of your company.

607
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,100
Will Lieutenant Scott be granted
the right to stand trial...

608
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,690
and face this charge?

609
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:44,860
Major Fussel saw him
standing over the body.

610
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,800
I would say he's had his trial.

611
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:49,670
Any prisoner accused of a crime
against another prisoner...

612
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:50,970
has a right to a trial.

613
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:53,170
And if the boy
were being held in Alabama...

614
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:54,610
there wouldn't be
any trial at all.

615
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:55,980
Is this not so?

616
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:58,510
Yeah, maybe you're
right, Colonel.

617
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,460
Maybe we should
just forget the trial.

618
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,120
Let's just drag him
out of the barracks...

619
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,320
and shoot 2 holes
in his chest...

620
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:05,990
like you do with
Lieutenant Archer.

621
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:11,730
A trial.

622
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:13,600
A court-martial.

623
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:17,140
Like in your American movies?

624
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,200
Yes?

625
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,840
Yeah, something like that.

626
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,340
That should be fun.

627
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:26,850
Yeah.

628
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,680
All right, Colonel.

629
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:32,820
You may conduct it...

630
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,020
in your theater here.

631
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:52,490
Colonel, my men are in
this theater every day.

632
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:53,650
With your permission...

633
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:54,820
we'd like to erect
a billet tent...

634
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,000
to house the proceedings.

635
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,170
No.

636
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,330
Your theater
will do quite nicely.

637
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,670
You have until
the end of the week...

638
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:01,840
to conduct your trial.

639
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,510
It's a capital charge,
Colonel.

640
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:05,170
The trial will take
more than a few days.

641
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,180
One thousand more American
prisoners from the Ardennes...

642
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,190
will be arriving
over the weekend.

643
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,690
I am putting them
in your theater.

644
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,850
Colonel, I just
explained to you--

645
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:14,050
Colonel...

646
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:16,720
Saturday, your theater is mine.

647
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:31,670
Wait. Colonel!

648
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,340
This is a murder site.

649
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,320
I beg your pardon,
Lieutenant.

650
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,520
I said
this is a murder site.

651
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,150
The body and
everything around it...

652
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,170
are now evidence.

653
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:52,500
This area cannot
be disturbed...

654
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,030
until everything
is photographed.

655
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,370
Of course.

656
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,880
I'm appointing you counsel
for Lieutenant Scott.

657
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,460
Sir, I'm not a lawyer.

658
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,990
You sounded like one
a minute ago.

659
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,830
I could be
a material witness.

660
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:27,300
I mean, I heard
the lieutenant going out.

661
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,640
The lieutenant
needs our help.

662
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,970
I've appointed you counsel.

663
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,170
Understood?

664
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:34,970
Yes, sir.

665
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,180
Dismissed, Lieutenant.

666
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:39,350
Sir.

667
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:24,970
And this guy
that's prosecuting me...

668
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,340
this Captain Sisk...

669
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,680
is he a real lawyer?

670
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,140
Yes.

671
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,670
That sounds about right.

672
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:37,650
I think we have to paint
this thing as a fight, Scott.

673
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,160
That's all.

674
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,850
It was a fight
that got a little out of hand.

675
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,530
You're supposed to ask me
if I did it, first.

676
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:49,200
Look, I came here
to kill Nazis.

677
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:52,840
If it was some crackers
that I wanted to kill...

678
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,180
I could have stayed in Macon.

679
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:56,340
Major Fussel ID'd you
standing over the body.

680
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,850
Fussel is a Nazi!

681
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,220
No. Fussel is a witness...

682
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:03,550
and he's enough to hang you.

683
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,520
Look, all I'm saying
is if it was a fight...

684
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,690
that got a little
out of hand...

685
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:10,030
then it's not murder.

686
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:11,190
It's manslaughter.

687
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:12,720
Do you understand that?

688
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,000
Man, oh, man.

689
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,310
Can I fire you?

690
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:27,640
Oh, look, Scott,
I'm just trying--

691
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,510
If it's a colored guy
on trial...

692
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,810
and it's a white man
who's been murdered...

693
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:36,150
there's no such thing
as manslaughter.

694
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:38,170
Don't you know that?

695
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,670
Or is that something
that they teach you...

696
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,530
in the third year
of law school?

697
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,010
What do you expect
from me, anyway?

698
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,510
A ''Hey, yes, sir, boss.''

699
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:51,170
Or ''Why, thank you, boss.
You're mighty kind.''

700
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:53,680
Is that the way
a railroaded colored man acts...

701
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,840
where you're from?

702
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,010
Nobody's railroading you, Scott.

703
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,680
Then how come
the only real lawyer...

704
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,190
is the guy
that's prosecuting me...

705
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,380
and I'm stuck with you
defending me?

706
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,220
That's how the Colonel
wanted it.

707
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,560
Yeah, but I ain't
being railroaded.

708
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,210
I'll meet you
back at the barracks.

709
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,410
Yes, sir.

710
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,230
Well, Lieutenant?

711
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:41,570
I'm gonna need
a few things, sir.

712
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:43,580
Who has Bedford's
personal effects?

713
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:44,910
We do.

714
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:46,740
I'll need to see them...

715
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,440
and the photographs
that were taken of the scene...

716
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,770
and of course, his body.

717
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:54,610
What did Scott tell you?

718
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,080
Sir?

719
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,250
You were with him all day.

720
01:00:58,290 --> 01:00:59,450
What did he tell you?

721
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,420
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't reveal that.

722
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,620
Sure you can.

723
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,630
Attorney-client privilege, sir.

724
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,760
Only an attorney
has attorney-client privilege.

725
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,100
I need to be briefed
on everything...

726
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:15,270
that Scott intends
to testify to.

727
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:17,780
Sir, you're going to be
President of the court-martial.

728
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:20,040
How can I possibly
discuss our case with you?

729
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,210
Are you suggesting...

730
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,410
that I would betray
Lieutenant Scott?

731
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,880
That I would share
details of his case...

732
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,080
with the prosecution?

733
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,900
No, sir.

734
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:33,730
Scott followed Bedford out
through the night latrine.

735
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,070
If he testifies to that fact...

736
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:37,070
every German in this camp
will know how we get in...

737
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,080
and out of the barracks
after dark...

738
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:40,740
and every man in this camp
would be compromised...

739
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,900
because of that.

740
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:43,410
Are you following this,
Lieutenant?

741
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:44,940
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

742
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,410
Now, Scott will testify
that he went out...

743
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:51,080
through a hole
beneath the stove...

744
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,250
in the barracks.

745
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:56,090
And you will make certain
that he is clear on that.

746
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,750
Do we understand each other,
Lieutenant?

747
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:58,950
We do, sir.

748
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:01,290
Dismissed.

749
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,430
Permission to speak, sir.

750
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,930
Speak freely.

751
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:07,960
Scott thinks this is all
just for show.

752
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:10,930
He thinks you passed sentence...

753
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:12,310
as soon as the body
hit the ground.

754
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:17,470
Is he right?

755
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,580
Bedford's footlocker
is in my barracks.

756
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:22,750
I'll make sure you get it.

757
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:01,960
Not much to look at, is he?

758
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:11,920
Did you know him?

759
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,060
No.

760
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,060
Not personally.

761
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,090
But my guards certainly
seemed to.

762
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:20,710
These are for you.

763
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:26,710
Thank you.

764
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:30,880
How well?

765
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,530
Your guards,
you said they knew him.

766
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,720
How well?

767
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,050
Well, you'll have to ask them
about that.

768
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:47,900
This is yours, too.

769
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,410
We found it on his wrist.

770
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:56,380
But with the inscription...

771
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:58,210
and those new boots
on your feet...

772
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,410
I made the assumption.

773
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,380
It's a little hard
to imagine, Colonel...

774
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:07,720
your guards
sitting for an interview.

775
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,090
I can arrange it.

776
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:12,260
I can arrange
anything you like.

777
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:15,560
It seems only fair...

778
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,170
what with your colonel
throwing you to the wolves.

779
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:22,310
I'm not sure I follow you.

780
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:23,510
Really?

781
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,190
Yale isn't in the habit
of accepting half-wits.

782
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,380
At least it wasn't
when I was studying there.

783
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,260
The oldest member
of the class of '28.

784
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:42,370
My fellow students voted me
hardest worker.

785
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,680
But we can swap stories
some other time, can't we?

786
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:52,470
Right now we've got a trial
to prepare for.

787
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:57,780
It's a sincere offer,
Lieutenant.

788
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:02,950
Anything I can do to help...

789
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,090
Truly.

790
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,760
And exactly where were you,
Major Fussel...

791
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,110
on the night in question?

792
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:15,770
I was walking the area
behind this theater...

793
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:17,340
and the Australian compound.

794
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,810
At about what time?

795
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,380
Maybe about 1:00
in the morning.

796
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:24,050
And can you tell the court
what you saw?

797
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,520
The schwarz Lieutenant Scott
was kneeling over the body.

798
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:31,930
It looked to me like he was
checking that the man was dead.

799
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,990
I blew my whistle,
and he started to run.

800
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,790
And what did you do next?

801
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:38,930
I would have shot,
but it was dark.

802
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,070
And so was he.

803
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:45,040
Major Fussel, how well
did you know Sergeant Bedford?

804
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,200
A little, I think.

805
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,770
You traded with him regularly.

806
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,370
Traded?

807
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:50,540
Bartered.

808
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:52,410
Cigarettes for a pair of boots.

809
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,010
Chocolate for some spare parts.

810
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,450
No. I never did this.

811
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:59,320
A kriegie trading
with a German soldier?

812
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,520
I never saw it.

813
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,820
Am I allowed to repeat what
he actually said to Captain?

814
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,020
You may, Private.

815
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,360
Lieutenant Scott said,
''I'll kill you.

816
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:09,700
''I'll fucking kill you,
Bedford.''

817
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,940
Corporal, have you ever
heard any other man...

818
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,470
threaten a fellow soldier
during your time in the army?

819
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,380
''Better shape up
or I'll kill you.''

820
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,040
''I'll kill you if you touch
my cigarettes again.''

821
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:19,950
-That sort of thing?
-Yes, sir.

822
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:22,550
I'll bet you've even made such
a threat yourself once or twice.

823
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:23,720
I suppose so.

824
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,450
Corporal, did you ever
actually kill any of the men...

825
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:26,650
you threatened in this manner?

826
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,360
No, sir.

827
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:31,490
But I'm not colored.

828
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:33,490
I can control myself.

829
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,970
So, you, too,
had heard the threats...

830
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,100
made by the accused
against Sergeant Bedford?

831
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,130
Your Honor, this being the
fourth prosecution witness...

832
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:42,200
called to testify
in this matter...

833
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,840
if the defense will stipulate
that the accused...

834
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,180
did indeed threaten the life
of Sergeant Bedford...

835
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,810
could we dispense
with any further testimony...

836
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,010
-to his having done so?
-Your Honor...

837
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:51,380
Sergeant Webb is being called
as an eyewitness...

838
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:52,550
to the crime itself.

839
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:54,110
He's what?

840
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,320
Is that right, Sergeant?

841
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,050
Yes, sir.

842
01:06:57,090 --> 01:06:58,350
-Sir, that's a lie.
-Your Honor...

843
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:00,720
the sergeant will testify that
on the night of the murder...

844
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,570
he watched through a window
in barracks 27...

845
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:06,300
as Lieutenant Scott
accosted Sergeant Bedford...

846
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:08,400
outside the theater
and broke his neck.

847
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:09,570
Your Honor,
he did no such thing.

848
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:11,010
I was standing
right beside Sergeant Webb...

849
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:12,310
at the exact time
of the murder.

850
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:14,320
-He saw nothing of the sort.
-The hell I didn't.

851
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:16,420
You don't know what I saw.

852
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:19,050
Sir, I request that this court
instruct this witness

853
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:21,290
as to the consequences of
perjuring himself in a court--

854
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:22,720
He put his hand on the Bible...

855
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,190
and swore to tell the truth,
Lieutenant.

856
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:25,350
-That's good enough for me.
-Objection, Your Honor.

857
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,520
We've had no prior notice
of his testimony.

858
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,190
-Sit down, Lieutenant.
-Your Honor, his bias alone--

859
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:29,390
Lieutenant!

860
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,360
Sit down, please.

861
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,240
I'll catch up.

862
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,590
I gotta go make some trades
in barracks 18.

863
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:52,710
See if you
can get me some smokes.

864
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,920
Webb...

865
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:56,520
You're a lying sack of shit,
you know that?

866
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,890
Yeah, and maybe you ought
to mind your own business.

867
01:07:57,930 --> 01:07:59,060
This doesn't concern you, West.

868
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:00,660
-Hey, Lieutenant.
-Or you. Any of you.

869
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:02,770
What do you know, Joe?
George S. Patton just showed up.

870
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:04,570
Return to your barracks,
Corporal.

871
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:06,050
Take your 2 friends with you.

872
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,480
So, what is it, Webb?

873
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:14,380
Up there today.

874
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:16,520
You think you owe it to Vic?

875
01:08:18,490 --> 01:08:21,090
Why are you so bent about
that flying bellhop anyway?

876
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,250
He's a soldier.

877
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,820
Vic Bedford was a soldier.

878
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:26,930
He fought.
He had courage.

879
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:30,030
You wouldn't know too much about
that, would you, Lieutenant?

880
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:32,030
You lied in there today.

881
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,830
You didn't see what happened
any more than I did.

882
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,610
I didn't have to.
I know.

883
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:39,810
Not good enough.

884
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,570
It's good enough for McNamara.

885
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,740
Sorry about what happened
in there today, Lincoln.

886
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:10,280
I didn't see it coming.

887
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,580
You're saying that's
the first time...

888
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:16,290
you seen a man lie
through his teeth...

889
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:17,660
holding his hand on a bible?

890
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,660
I was writing a letter
to my father.

891
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,960
Figured I should tell him first.

892
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,730
He was part of
the 369th Infantry...

893
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:34,740
in the last war,
the old 15th.

894
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:40,610
They was the first negro troops
to go into action in France.

895
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,420
Did your father serve?

896
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,080
My father
was in headquarters.

897
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:50,500
He had an 8
on his shoulder, too.

898
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,830
His father made sure of it.

899
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,100
That's how we do things
in our family.

900
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:59,470
That's a shame.

901
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,940
Got your testimony to prepare.

902
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,180
Yeah.

903
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:39,310
Lieutenant.

904
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:41,150
How are you?

905
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:44,090
Not too well, I imagine.

906
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,330
Come on up.

907
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,830
That was quite a beating
you took today.

908
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:55,630
It's warm inside.

909
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:07,440
You've read Mark Twain?

910
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:08,650
It's wonderful.

911
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:11,560
Colonel, I have witnesses
to prepare for.

912
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:13,080
Yes. I know.

913
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,590
It's why I wanted to see you.

914
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:34,710
We keep a library of all
American military manuals.

915
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,820
I thought this one might be
of particular use to you.

916
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:45,030
I can't accept this, Colonel.

917
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,090
We have a policy
about fraternizing...

918
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,330
Lieutenant,
without this, your client...

919
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:50,170
will face the firing squad.

920
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,470
Would that be better?

921
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,110
Your son?

922
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:04,950
Yes.

923
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:06,980
Where's he fighting?

924
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:13,620
He is not anymore.

925
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,660
The Russian front.

926
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,600
Horrible place.

927
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:27,580
I'm sorry.

928
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:33,240
I killed my share of English
and French, I suppose...

929
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,280
in the first war.

930
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,430
They had fathers, too.

931
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,510
It's verboten, you know.

932
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:56,710
Negro jazz.

933
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,210
These might be the only copies
of their kind...

934
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:02,410
in the entire Reich.

935
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,820
But I'm quite fond of them.

936
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:13,830
Nice to read by, anyway.

937
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:17,990
Takes a man right back.

938
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:23,040
Take a seat.

939
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:28,210
Thank you for your time,
Colonel.

940
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,440
Lieutenant...

941
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:36,530
Enjoy the manual.

942
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:00,280
Come to order, gentlemen.

943
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,850
Captain Sisk,
is the prosecution...

944
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:03,120
prepared to call
its next witness?

945
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,290
We are, Your Honor.

946
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:06,160
Begging the court's pardon, sir.

947
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,090
Yes, Lieutenant?

948
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:09,260
Before we continue,
Your Honor...

949
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,860
it's been brought to
my attention that the court...

950
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:13,390
may have overlooked a few
procedural matters yesterday.

951
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:17,300
I'm referring to the ''U.S. Army
Manual for Courts-Martial''...

952
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:20,500
chapter 12, sections 57, 58.

953
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:22,740
Make your point.

954
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,210
According to these sections,
Your Honor...

955
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:26,610
the court was obliged yesterday
to ask the accused...

956
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:28,990
if he wished to challenge
any members of the court...

957
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:31,900
for peremptory disqualification
before any pleas were entered.

958
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,930
A little late in the game
for that, isn't it, Lieutenant?

959
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:38,100
Nevertheless, it is a right...

960
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,630
specifically granted
to the defendant.

961
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:45,940
Very well.

962
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,780
Does the accused
wish to challenge...

963
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:51,150
any member of the court now?

964
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:52,950
We do, Your Honor.

965
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,650
You, sir.

966
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:00,360
Request denied.
Proceed, Captain Sisk.

967
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:03,290
Sir, according to chapter 12,
section 58d...

968
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:05,130
defense is allowed
1 peremptory challenge...

969
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:06,290
of the board,
and this challenge...

970
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:08,630
is not subject to any ruling
by the court itself.

971
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:09,790
Request denied, Lieutenant.

972
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,360
Then the court must address
section 58e...

973
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:14,100
which states the defense
may disqualify...

974
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:15,940
a member of the board
for cause...

975
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:17,910
if that member
has displayed a bias...

976
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:19,410
toward the accused or his case.

977
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,910
This court has shown no bias
in this case, Lieutenant.

978
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:22,070
Your Honor,
the court has demonstrated...

979
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,460
in ex parte conversations
before the commencement...

980
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:28,290
of this hearing a distinct
prejudice against the accused...

981
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:31,460
his case, and his counsel, sir.

982
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,450
Very well.

983
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:50,610
We'll take a short recess
to consider the matter.

984
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:53,460
-Lieutenant Hart.
-Sir?

985
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:55,150
Can I see you outside
for a moment, please?

986
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,840
Sir?

987
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:12,540
Listen to me,
you pampered little shit.

988
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:16,170
I will not be laughed at.
Not by him.

989
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:18,980
Sir, I'm just trying
to protect my client.

990
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:21,320
Your client's about to lose
his lawyer, Lieutenant.

991
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,920
Sir?

992
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,860
Article 32: contempt of court.

993
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,870
Article 70: intentional delay.

994
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,100
I know the book, too.

995
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:34,440
Forwards and backwards.

996
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:35,940
Then you must know, sir, that--

997
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:37,810
Shut up and listen to me,
Lieutenant.

998
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:42,810
You will not accept anything
from that commandant again.

999
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:44,010
Is that clear?

1000
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,950
You will not allow him
to participate...

1001
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:48,680
in these proceedings,
is that clear?

1002
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,620
You will never set foot
in his office again...

1003
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:52,890
without my permission.

1004
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:55,350
We understand each other?

1005
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:16,060
...and propaganda reported
by them...

1006
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,650
and by the Germans
over Strasbourg.

1007
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:22,190
One minute you can hear
Hitler himself announcing...

1008
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:25,670
that he will be in Strasbourg
by January the 30th...

1009
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:28,870
the anniversary of the Nazis
coming to power in Germany.

1010
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:32,800
The next, the Nazis are claiming
that 2 new divisions...

1011
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,430
are advancing on Strasbourg...

1012
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,610
and that the Americans are
in full flight from Alsace.

1013
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:41,550
The closer they get,
the more violent they become.

1014
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:45,380
The Nazi menace are offering
their promises.

1015
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:47,210
But today...

1016
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:49,850
Come in. Have a seat.

1017
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:54,030
We've checked German...

1018
01:17:58,330 --> 01:17:59,490
Have a drink.

1019
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:01,330
Sure.

1020
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:06,730
Maybe you can help me
decipher some of this code...

1021
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:10,370
coming through
the BBC tonight, yeah?

1022
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:11,980
I don't think you need
my help, Colonel.

1023
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:15,180
Seems pretty clear
what they're saying.

1024
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,930
It would seem so.

1025
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,600
Or perhaps
it's all propaganda.

1026
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:30,270
How about that?

1027
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:51,180
Strange thing about war wounds.

1028
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:58,690
The older you grow, the less
proud you become of them.

1029
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,760
Got another one of these
around here somewhere?

1030
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:30,200
Of course.

1031
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:33,330
Good. Why don't you and I take
a walk out on your compound...

1032
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:35,070
and have ourselves
an old-fashioned duel?

1033
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:39,650
That would be fitting,
wouldn't it?

1034
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,350
But surely you can think
of a more clever way...

1035
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:46,150
out of this camp
than that, yes?

1036
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:58,060
You think the war will wait
for you, is that it, Colonel?

1037
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:05,270
It won't, you know.
They never do.

1038
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:13,820
You're drunk.

1039
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,320
Yeah.

1040
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:20,690
But I'm seeing things
very clearly.

1041
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:29,610
You know, sometimes I think
your Lieutenant Scott...

1042
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,610
might have been better off
in Alabama.

1043
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,570
Lynchings are over in minutes.

1044
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:41,620
The kind of justice he's
suffering here is far crueler.

1045
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:44,750
Is that why you gave
Lieutenant Hart the manual?

1046
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:48,650
I was merely
trying to help the lad.

1047
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:50,650
He's got enough
to worry about...

1048
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,420
without providing you
with amusement.

1049
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,360
Yes.

1050
01:20:57,540 --> 01:21:00,070
He's got you to worry about,
hasn't he?

1051
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,220
Stay out of our business.

1052
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:09,520
Forgive me, Colonel,
but you're hardly...

1053
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,650
in a position
to hand out orders.

1054
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:14,520
Especially to me.

1055
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:21,490
For now.

1056
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:35,320
Unless, of course,
you think that's just...

1057
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:37,680
the sound of propaganda
falling out there.

1058
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:50,990
Well, the idea was
to follow Bedford...

1059
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:52,730
and catch him
on the compound.

1060
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:54,970
I wanted to drag him back
under the barracks...

1061
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:56,450
and put his face in the mud.

1062
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:58,950
Well, by the time
I got to him...

1063
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,950
he was already dead
behind the theater...

1064
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:02,450
neck had been snapped.

1065
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:03,980
That's when everything blew up.

1066
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:07,480
Dogs, you know, hands up,
and that was that.

1067
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:09,360
Lieutenant,
did you apply anything...

1068
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:11,990
to your face or hands
before going out that night?

1069
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,260
Shoe polish? Soot?

1070
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,700
No.

1071
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:17,220
Defense exhibit 1, Your Honor.

1072
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:20,670
Photos of the deceased taken
in the camp morgue.

1073
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,330
The court will note
black smudges...

1074
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:25,140
on Bedford's right cheek
and jaw.

1075
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,580
Your Honor, what is
the relevance of this?

1076
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,640
To demonstrate to the court...

1077
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,780
that whoever killed
Vic Bedford was white.

1078
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:36,680
I'd like to ask
the court's permission...

1079
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,850
to conduct a demonstration,
Your Honor.

1080
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:41,450
I'd also ask the trial judge
advocate to rise, if he would.

1081
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:43,690
Proceed.

1082
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:47,820
Based on Bedford's wounds
and the fact that...

1083
01:22:47,870 --> 01:22:50,040
nobody reported hearing him
cry for help that night...

1084
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,840
we have to assume
that he was either...

1085
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,210
friendly with his assailant...

1086
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:55,440
or that whoever killed him
did so from behind...

1087
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,140
the positioning being
something like this.

1088
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,710
Captain, if you wouldn't mind
grabbing at me...

1089
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,980
at my face
to get me to stop.

1090
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,390
Now, of course, the killer
had the benefits...

1091
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:06,690
of leverage and surprise,
so the neck was snapped...

1092
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,760
and Bedford fell,
and the smudge went with him.

1093
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:14,230
It was also on his fingers.
Captain?

1094
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:18,770
At this time,
I would like the court...

1095
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:20,300
to note the following
for the record:

1096
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:22,070
whoever killed Vic Bedford...

1097
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:24,580
had such a substance on his face
on the night of the murder...

1098
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,610
which raises 2 questions.

1099
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:30,080
First, what call
would Lincoln Scott have...

1100
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,550
for darkening his face?

1101
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,020
To look more black?

1102
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:36,750
Second, if he had done so,
when did he take it off?

1103
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:38,020
Your Honor, you stood
face to face with him...

1104
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:39,250
immediately
after his capture.

1105
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:40,490
His face was clean.

1106
01:23:41,330 --> 01:23:42,490
I think it's fair to conclude...

1107
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:45,340
that whoever killed Vic Bedford
was not only white...

1108
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:47,500
but was waiting
behind this theater...

1109
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:50,070
face blackened to avoid
detection by the guards.

1110
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,210
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1111
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:56,240
Lieutenant, you say that
Sergeant Bedford sneaked out...

1112
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:59,880
through a loose board
beneath the barracks' stove.

1113
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:02,390
Is that right?

1114
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,920
Yes, sir.

1115
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:10,990
And you took that same route
on the night in question...

1116
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,300
after he'd gone out.

1117
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,670
Yes, I did, sir.

1118
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:18,000
What did you find down there,
Lieutenant?

1119
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:19,800
Excuse me, sir?

1120
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,680
What was down there
on the ground?

1121
01:24:24,650 --> 01:24:27,080
Mud, right?

1122
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,310
You stated that it had been
your intention...

1123
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:31,380
to put the victim's face
in the mud...

1124
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:33,050
until he begged you to stop...

1125
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:35,580
so there was mud down there,
isn't that right, Lieutenant?

1126
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:37,960
I suppose so.

1127
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,560
And a fair amount of soot
from the stove itself.

1128
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:44,080
So it's possible
that Sergeant Bedford...

1129
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:46,510
having descended through
a hole lined with soot...

1130
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:48,040
and then having crawled
facedown...

1131
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,520
beneath the barracks
wet with mud...

1132
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:54,080
might have emerged with mud
and soot on his face.

1133
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:58,790
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1134
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,590
Thank you, Captain Sisk.

1135
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,300
Will you step down, Lieutenant?

1136
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,400
Lieutenant Scott?

1137
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,310
You know how hard they tried...

1138
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:21,870
to wash us out of flight
school--the colored flyers?

1139
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:24,020
Your testimony's been entered,
Lieutenant.

1140
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:25,810
You can step down.

1141
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:27,410
It was test after test.

1142
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:32,290
I mean, anything they
could come up with to turn us...

1143
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:35,960
into the cooks or the drivers
or the shit shovelers.

1144
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,560
Your Honor,
this is highly unnecessary.

1145
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:41,070
-The witness has already--
-But I refused to wash out.

1146
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:44,670
So did Archer.
I mean, come hell or high water.

1147
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,010
We hit the books.

1148
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:47,540
We were just determined...

1149
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:51,540
that we were not going to spend
the war being some niggers.

1150
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:53,490
That's enough, Lieutenant.
You will take your seat.

1151
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,680
With all due respect, sir...

1152
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:57,560
I would like to exercise
my right and address this court.

1153
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:01,590
Now, I've been sitting down
ever since I got here.

1154
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:05,060
And you know, I should have
stood up and said something...

1155
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:07,330
the moment that you threw us in
with the enlisted men...

1156
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:10,430
instead of quartering us
properly as officers.

1157
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:18,610
But it's OK.

1158
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:21,920
You see, colored men
expect to have to jump...

1159
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:24,680
through a few hoops
in this man's army.

1160
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:27,490
Archer knew that.
We all did.

1161
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:37,570
There's a camp right outside
of Macon, where I'm from, and...

1162
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:41,980
there the army sends
the German POWs...

1163
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:45,700
puts them to work
picking cotton.

1164
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:50,180
But what's strange is
every once in a while...

1165
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:52,240
we'd see them
walking through town...

1166
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:55,890
going to movies,
eating in diners...

1167
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,780
but if I wanted to go
to those same movies...

1168
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:00,760
I had to sit way off
in the balcony.

1169
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:04,500
And those diners were closed
to me even in uniform.

1170
01:27:05,230 --> 01:27:09,030
But German POWs were allowed
to sit there and eat.

1171
01:27:09,070 --> 01:27:10,200
And this must have happened...

1172
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,710
to at least half the guys
at Tuskegee.

1173
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:13,870
But the thing is...

1174
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:17,540
we just kept telling ourselves
that no matter what...

1175
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:20,710
as long as we did our jobs,
it'd all be worth it...

1176
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:24,580
because hey, the war would end,
we could go home...

1177
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:27,380
and be free to walk down
any street in America...

1178
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:30,700
with our heads held high as men.

1179
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:35,170
So that's what we did.

1180
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:36,570
We did our jobs.

1181
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:46,150
We served our country, sir,
Archer and I.

1182
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:48,920
And what you
let happen to him...

1183
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:52,760
what you allowed to happen
to him...

1184
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:56,430
was appalling.

1185
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:02,730
And so is this.

1186
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:27,060
At ease, Lieutenant.

1187
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,110
How are they treating you?

1188
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:40,640
No worse than the men
in my barracks, sir.

1189
01:28:45,150 --> 01:28:47,120
I can probably find you
another blanket.

1190
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:48,210
No. I'm fine.

1191
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:06,770
Good night.

1192
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:35,240
New order, gentlemen.

1193
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:38,440
Before you proceed, Your Honor,
the defense hasn't rested yet.

1194
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,040
Still like to call
one last witness.

1195
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:46,150
Defense calls
Oberst Werner Visser.

1196
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:51,760
This some kind of joke,
Lieutenant?

1197
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,290
He's material to our case, sir.

1198
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:56,930
Unless, of course,
the colonel refuses to testify.

1199
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:00,960
He does not.

1200
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:09,170
Colonel, could you tell us...

1201
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:10,990
the nature of your relationship
with Vic Bedford?

1202
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:14,660
I'll be happy to.
I didn't have one.

1203
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:16,760
And what about your guards,
Colonel?

1204
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:18,800
Major Fussel, for instance?

1205
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,000
Were you aware of his dealings
with Vic Bedford...

1206
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:24,200
at night after lockdown?

1207
01:31:25,370 --> 01:31:27,640
That would be impossible
in this camp, Lieutenant.

1208
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:28,700
Policy forbids.

1209
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:32,440
Do you remember
the conversation we had...

1210
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,210
in the camp morgue 4 days ago?

1211
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:36,680
Vaguely.

1212
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,020
I asked you
if you knew Vic Bedford...

1213
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:43,150
and you said, ''No, but my guards
certainly seem to.''

1214
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:44,520
Perhaps.

1215
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,930
So, in your words...

1216
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:48,260
no guard ever traded with
Vic Bedford...

1217
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,460
and yet he was able to acquire
winter boots...

1218
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:55,460
thick socks, fresh milk,
and parts for a hidden radio.

1219
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,600
Isn't that a fact?

1220
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:01,670
Lieutenant, I'm sitting here as
a gesture of military courtesy.

1221
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:05,610
If it is your intention
to paint me as a liar--

1222
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:07,320
No, Colonel.

1223
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:08,760
It is my intention
to establish...

1224
01:32:08,790 --> 01:32:11,160
that Vic Bedford built up
enough of a rapport...

1225
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,560
with your majors Wirtz
and Fussel...

1226
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,500
to engage in the framing of
Lamar Archer...

1227
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:18,440
conspiring with them
in the tent spike incident...

1228
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:20,770
which resulted in
Archer's death.

1229
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:24,140
Lieutenant Archer was shot
while attempting escape.

1230
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:25,440
No, Colonel.

1231
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:29,110
Lieutenant Archer was executed
in return for information.

1232
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,110
Archer dies.

1233
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:34,140
Five minutes later...

1234
01:32:34,190 --> 01:32:37,180
Colonel Visser and Major Wirtz
enter Barracks 22...

1235
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:39,180
and destroy a hidden radio...

1236
01:32:39,230 --> 01:32:40,950
that they had been trying
to locate for months.

1237
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:52,230
Can you tell the court anything
about these items, sir?

1238
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:55,540
Identification papers,
some currency.

1239
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:57,360
What of them?

1240
01:32:57,410 --> 01:33:00,940
Perfect German-made I.D. papers
and reichsmarks.

1241
01:33:02,430 --> 01:33:03,450
Two thousand of them.

1242
01:33:06,930 --> 01:33:08,730
More than enough cash to make it
through the country.

1243
01:33:09,870 --> 01:33:12,160
Vic Bedford kept those
in a stash beside his bunk.

1244
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,330
Again, can you tell the court...

1245
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:15,130
the nature of your relationship
with Vic Bedford?

1246
01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:17,070
I did not have one, Lieutenant.

1247
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:18,100
Do you have any idea...

1248
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:20,040
how he may have gotten
these items, sir?

1249
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:22,580
If they didn't come from you...

1250
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:25,050
and if he never had any dealings
with your guards...

1251
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:26,410
the fact is, Colonel...

1252
01:33:26,450 --> 01:33:29,110
Vic Bedford traded with you
and your men regularly.

1253
01:33:29,150 --> 01:33:30,140
Objection, Your Honor!

1254
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:32,150
As soon as he came up dry
on you, you ordered his murder.

1255
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:33,660
Isn't that right, Colonel?

1256
01:33:33,690 --> 01:33:34,710
Lieutenant Hart...

1257
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:39,160
I thought you tried
marvelously...

1258
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:43,150
to establish that the killer had
blackened his face with soot.

1259
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,590
Now, if any of my guards...

1260
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:49,830
or even I wanted to kill
one of my prisoners--

1261
01:33:49,870 --> 01:33:51,400
Vic Bedford in this case--

1262
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:55,670
we would hardly need to blacken
our faces to do it.

1263
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:58,210
Would we?

1264
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:43,950
Move. In the corner, Webb.

1265
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:30,870
Captain.

1266
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:44,860
You see?

1267
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:48,500
German uniforms, explosives.

1268
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,670
Yes, Captain, I see.

1269
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,840
The trial's got nothing to do
with Lincoln Scott, does it?

1270
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:56,910
No.

1271
01:37:57,990 --> 01:37:59,210
It's the way it had to go.

1272
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:01,850
We're out of time, Hart.

1273
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:04,520
We lose this theater tomorrow.

1274
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,220
Uh-huh, and I'm supposed to keep
Visser and his men distracted...

1275
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:08,350
while half the camp goes out.

1276
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,530
Is that it, Captain?

1277
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:16,670
I'm asking
the wrong fucking guy.

1278
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:35,350
I've just seen the tunnel,
Colonel.

1279
01:38:41,870 --> 01:38:42,900
In here, Lieutenant.

1280
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:03,890
Everything in this place
is a lie.

1281
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:04,950
Everything.

1282
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:13,560
Jesus Christ.

1283
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,440
First he told the Germans
about the radio.

1284
01:39:20,010 --> 01:39:21,000
It was only a matter of time...

1285
01:39:21,050 --> 01:39:22,410
before he told them about
the tunnel.

1286
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:28,040
You killed Bedford.

1287
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:33,220
That's right.

1288
01:39:41,540 --> 01:39:44,510
If you fuck with this operation
in any way, I'll kill you, too.

1289
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:50,850
You will sit in
that courtroom...

1290
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:53,150
as Captain Sisk drags out
these proceedings.

1291
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:57,790
Make whatever summation
you like, but that's it.

1292
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:01,530
When that board breaks
to deliberate,

1293
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,190
35 men go under the wire.

1294
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:04,790
And Lincoln Scott will be dead.

1295
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:05,820
That's war, Lieutenant.

1296
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:07,530
The war's at the front, Colonel.
We're not even in it anymore.

1297
01:40:07,570 --> 01:40:08,590
Speak for yourself!

1298
01:40:11,570 --> 01:40:12,560
You know those Russians...

1299
01:40:12,610 --> 01:40:13,700
they march in and out of here
every day?

1300
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:16,340
-You know where they go?
-Munitions plant.

1301
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:18,680
The army thinks
it's a goddamn shoe factory.

1302
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:25,210
Look...

1303
01:40:26,150 --> 01:40:28,320
I don't want to see Scott dead
any more than you do.

1304
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:31,100
But if one man
has to be sacrificed...

1305
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:32,120
to take out that target...

1306
01:40:32,170 --> 01:40:33,660
then that's the way
it has to be.

1307
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:35,800
-I agree completely, sir.
-Good.

1308
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:39,870
But I think that one man
should be you.

1309
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:43,370
And don't worry.
I'll play my part.

1310
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:44,900
But at the end of the trial...

1311
01:40:44,950 --> 01:40:47,420
you're going to tap
your little gavel.

1312
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:48,480
You're going to stand up...

1313
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:50,110
and you're going to confess to
the murder.

1314
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:51,590
Your duty demands that.

1315
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:52,750
Fuck you, Hart.

1316
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:55,220
What the fuck would you know
about duty?

1317
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:59,690
I'll see you in court, sir.

1318
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:22,920
I got a better question.

1319
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,730
What was in that goddamn soup
last night?

1320
01:41:24,770 --> 01:41:26,560
I got 20 men
with food poisoning.

1321
01:41:38,810 --> 01:41:41,300
Colonel? Whoa! Colonel!

1322
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:44,510
You're in no shape
for the trial, sir.

1323
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:47,210
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

1324
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:49,080
Here we go.

1325
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:52,490
We'll convene as scheduled
after the appell.

1326
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:54,420
Square 'em up.

1327
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:59,790
Prisoners, attention!

1328
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:05,370
New order, gentlemen.

1329
01:42:05,410 --> 01:42:06,430
Captain Sisk...

1330
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:11,280
is the prosecution ready
to present its summation?

1331
01:42:11,310 --> 01:42:12,340
We are, Your Honor.

1332
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:14,570
Very well.

1333
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:26,830
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

1334
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:30,070
The court needs a 5-minute
recess before summations.

1335
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,470
Colonel. Colonel!

1336
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:35,640
Colonel? Colonel!

1337
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:37,840
Let's get him back
to the barracks.

1338
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:38,970
Get his coat.

1339
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:40,540
Get some rest, sir.

1340
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:44,020
All right, come on.
Get back to the barracks.

1341
01:42:44,050 --> 01:42:45,890
We need an extension, Colonel.
He's very ill.

1342
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:48,480
The agreement was
the end of the week.

1343
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:50,020
It's a matter of courtesy,
Colonel.

1344
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:52,030
The agreement was today!

1345
01:42:57,230 --> 01:42:58,260
I need to talk to you.

1346
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:16,090
Are you any good at poker,
Lincoln?

1347
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:20,690
There's an escape going to take
place later on this afternoon.

1348
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,830
Escape? How's that?

1349
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:28,500
Down a tunnel through
that burned theater wing.

1350
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:32,370
while the jury's
in deliberation.

1351
01:43:36,150 --> 01:43:38,310
So what you mean?
This whole thing's been a joke?

1352
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:40,410
Yes.

1353
01:43:40,450 --> 01:43:43,620
But Archer and Bedford
are dead for real.

1354
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:45,750
Is that part
of this big joke, too?

1355
01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:48,350
Look, we haven't got time now.

1356
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,520
During deliberations you're
going out under the wire...

1357
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,830
with 35 other men.

1358
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:54,930
Is McNamara, too?

1359
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:58,740
Yeah, McNamara, too.

1360
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:05,740
It's funny.
I was just writing my son...

1361
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:08,250
and in the letter I was
trying to explain to him...

1362
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:12,020
what the word honor means.

1363
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,960
It would be a hell of a thing,
wouldn't it...

1364
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,370
to find out that your father
helped 35 men...

1365
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,300
escape from a place
like this, wouldn't it?

1366
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:24,310
You're going out, too, Lincoln.
You got that?

1367
01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:27,800
I can't do that, Tommy.

1368
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:32,040
Suppose the board comes back...

1369
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:34,780
and there's nobody sitting in
the defendant's chair anymore.

1370
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:36,120
It doesn't matter.
You'll already be out.

1371
01:44:36,150 --> 01:44:38,180
Then the search begins...

1372
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:41,560
and all those men,
they won't have a chance.

1373
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:43,580
Lincoln, if you stay,
you'll be convicted.

1374
01:44:43,630 --> 01:44:47,170
If I stay, those men
are gonna have a chance.

1375
01:44:47,170 --> 01:44:47,940
If I stay, those men
are gonna have a chance.

1376
01:44:47,970 --> 01:44:49,910
And you'll be executed.

1377
01:44:55,250 --> 01:44:56,650
Lincoln, listen to me, please.

1378
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:59,580
Everything's fine, Tommy.

1379
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:01,380
Everything's really OK...

1380
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:07,760
just as long as he knows
what happened here.

1381
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:11,670
As long as there's
somebody to tell him.

1382
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:20,610
How far could I get anyway?

1383
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:24,380
A colored man running through
the German countryside?

1384
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:26,290
It'd be target practice.

1385
01:45:52,050 --> 01:45:54,070
It started with a noble idea.

1386
01:45:56,050 --> 01:45:58,490
Letting colored men
join the fight.

1387
01:45:59,890 --> 01:46:03,030
But no one in the Air Corps ever
considered what might happen...

1388
01:46:03,070 --> 01:46:06,100
if one of those Tuskegee men
ever got shot down.

1389
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:09,270
No one ever asked
what would happen...

1390
01:46:09,310 --> 01:46:11,740
if a colored officer
was suddenly captured...

1391
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:14,300
and sent to a stalag
like this one.

1392
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:20,940
But Lincoln Scott was shot down
and he was sent to a stalag...

1393
01:46:20,990 --> 01:46:23,220
and once here,
he wasn't just thrown in...

1394
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:26,780
amongst white enlisted men,
he was quartered with them.

1395
01:46:26,830 --> 01:46:29,190
Men like Staff Sergeant
Vic Bedford.

1396
01:46:29,230 --> 01:46:33,130
Bedford, the real Bedford,
was a man unknown to us.

1397
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:38,130
Hateful, vengeful, with
a bigotry that ran bone-deep.

1398
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,400
A man who simply couldn't
stomach the thought...

1399
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:46,040
of sharing a roof
with colored officers.

1400
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,340
So he badgered Scott,
baited him.

1401
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:51,350
Even refused
to respect Scott's rank.

1402
01:46:51,380 --> 01:46:56,010
Then conspired to kill the only
friend Scott had in this camp.

1403
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:58,530
That's why Scott
followed Bedford out...

1404
01:46:58,570 --> 01:46:59,930
the night in question...

1405
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:03,870
crept up behind him
and snapped his neck.

1406
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:07,010
Members of the board,
we take no pleasure...

1407
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:09,510
in prosecuting
Lieutenant Scott...

1408
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:11,340
but a capital charge requires...

1409
01:47:11,380 --> 01:47:14,480
that we put aside
our passions and sympathies...

1410
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:18,450
wedding ourselves
solely to the truth.

1411
01:47:18,490 --> 01:47:20,120
It is this.

1412
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:21,950
Lieutenant Scott
was positively...

1413
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:24,520
and unimpeachably identified
at the scene of the crime.

1414
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:27,500
He had motive,
he had opportunity...

1415
01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:29,520
and he had an animus
for the victim...

1416
01:47:29,570 --> 01:47:32,540
which was confirmed
even by his own testimony.

1417
01:47:34,540 --> 01:47:39,410
Lincoln Scott is an officer,
he is a soldier...

1418
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,070
but he is also a murderer.

1419
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:11,180
There's a tenet that was
drummed into all of us...

1420
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:13,010
from our first day in basic.

1421
01:48:14,150 --> 01:48:16,350
Sometimes 1 man
must be sacrificed...

1422
01:48:16,390 --> 01:48:18,720
for the good
of the men around him.

1423
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:21,250
Someone has to be first
to hit the beach...

1424
01:48:21,290 --> 01:48:25,420
or to jump on a grenade
or to draw enemy fire...

1425
01:48:25,470 --> 01:48:28,230
so coordinates can be drawn
for mortar teams.

1426
01:48:28,270 --> 01:48:31,030
Vic Bedford
learned that tenet, too...

1427
01:48:31,070 --> 01:48:33,400
except Vic got it backwards.

1428
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,930
Vic thought that sometimes
a few hundred...

1429
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:38,140
must be sacrificed
for the good of 1.

1430
01:48:39,610 --> 01:48:41,880
Him. For Vic.

1431
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:44,110
The watchword was expediency.

1432
01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:46,020
One day he'd trade
with our captors...

1433
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:48,550
to get hard-to-find parts
for a radio...

1434
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:50,660
earning him the loyalty
of our commanding officer...

1435
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:52,070
and his staff.

1436
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:54,470
Then Vic would tell the Germans
where to find that radio...

1437
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:55,660
Go.

1438
01:48:55,710 --> 01:48:57,940
in exchange for the murder
of Lamar Archer.

1439
01:49:00,110 --> 01:49:02,170
The army has its share
of cowards...

1440
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:06,210
and Vic Bedford was one of them.

1441
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:10,380
It also has heroes...
soldiers like Lincoln Scott.

1442
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:13,580
Lincoln Scott who wanted nothing
more than to serve his country.

1443
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:15,250
And serve he did.

1444
01:49:15,290 --> 01:49:18,390
Nine downed German fighters,
30 missions...

1445
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:22,560
until one of those missions
landed him here, Stalag 6A...

1446
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:25,690
where Vic Bedford and the sad
sacks Bedford called friends...

1447
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:27,500
were lying in wait.

1448
01:49:27,540 --> 01:49:30,940
Scott was a target
from the second he got here.

1449
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:35,600
He suffered insults, threats,
but he did not retaliate.

1450
01:49:35,650 --> 01:49:40,080
He did not kill Vic Bedford.

1451
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:41,740
No.

1452
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:44,120
Someone beat him to it.

1453
01:49:46,770 --> 01:49:49,330
It could've been
any number of people.

1454
01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:52,930
The guard who thought
that Bedford had cheated him.

1455
01:49:52,970 --> 01:49:55,910
A fellow kriegie who discovered
Bedford's treachery.

1456
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:57,310
Even one of our
ranking officers...

1457
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:59,370
as punishment for
ratting out that radio.

1458
01:49:59,410 --> 01:50:01,680
So this, then, is our victim?

1459
01:50:01,710 --> 01:50:06,410
A bigot. A traitor. A rat.

1460
01:50:06,450 --> 01:50:08,780
Enemy of every kriegie in camp.

1461
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:14,250
The question is, who hated him
enough to kill him?

1462
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:20,460
Colonel.

1463
01:50:28,410 --> 01:50:29,600
I did.

1464
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:36,380
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

1465
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:38,510
I killed Vic Bedford, sir.

1466
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,690
Come on, Colonel. Here.

1467
01:50:45,470 --> 01:50:48,200
I want every man in the compound
present...

1468
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:50,300
for the execution
of Lieutenant Hart.

1469
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:55,910
Very brave.
Very brave, indeed.

1470
01:50:55,950 --> 01:50:57,040
Colonel, this man has rights.

1471
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:58,100
Not anymore.

1472
01:50:58,150 --> 01:50:59,740
This court still has to
deliberate the matter.

1473
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:01,040
I am the court now!

1474
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:02,850
Now. Get him up.
Get him up. Get him up.

1475
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:11,980
Get out.

1476
01:53:26,710 --> 01:53:28,180
I want every man...

1477
01:53:28,210 --> 01:53:29,970
who participated
in the court-martial...

1478
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:31,910
removed from the line.

1479
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:38,690
Line them up.

1480
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:41,290
Line them up. Now.

1481
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:43,220
These men knew nothing, Colonel.

1482
01:53:45,130 --> 01:53:46,590
Line them up!

1483
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:49,560
You will be the first.

1484
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:50,930
These men knew nothing.

1485
01:53:50,970 --> 01:53:52,730
You will be the first!

1486
01:53:52,770 --> 01:53:54,240
Colonel, they knew nothing!

1487
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,400
So, your men are saboteurs
as well?

1488
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:23,640
No, Colonel,
they're just soldiers.

1489
01:55:23,680 --> 01:55:25,700
They were following my orders.

1490
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:28,880
I assume complete
responsibility.

1491
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:33,820
That's very noble of you.

1492
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:46,560
Seems you've won our duel
after all, Colonel.

1493
01:55:49,370 --> 01:55:50,960
No.

1494
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:56,370
We both lose, don't we?

1495
01:55:59,210 --> 01:56:00,610
Yeah.

1496
01:56:03,890 --> 01:56:08,950
And now you wish to
trade your life for theirs?

1497
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:19,670
Yes, I do.

1498
01:56:53,450 --> 01:56:55,140
Very well.

1499
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:29,260
We buried the Colonel in
a marked grave behind the camp.

1500
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:31,960
Three months later,
the German army surrendered.

1501
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,560
Our stalag was liberated.

1502
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:36,660
The war was over.

1503
01:59:37,670 --> 01:59:42,200
We returned home to America,
to our families.

1504
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:43,740
Lincoln Scott got the chance...

1505
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:46,580
to explain the word honor
to his son.

1506
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:52,490
Honor and courage,
duty, sacrifice.

1507
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:55,960
Lincoln's son came
to understand those words...

1508
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,490
and so have I.

1509
