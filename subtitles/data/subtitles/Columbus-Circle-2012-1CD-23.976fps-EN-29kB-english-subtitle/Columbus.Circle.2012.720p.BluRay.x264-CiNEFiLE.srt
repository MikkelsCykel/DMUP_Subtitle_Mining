1
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,446
Well, the only thing I know is
she's got a wedding ring, no husband.

2
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,365
We gotta find out if
the husband's around.

3
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,783
She have any family?

4
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,243
According to these pictures over here
on the table, she does.

5
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,286
Check with the building to see

6
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,788
if they have any surveillance tapes,

7
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,456
find out if there were any guests

8
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,124
in the last 12 hours
that she might have had.

9
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,461
- You know, her other slipper’s up here.
- Yeah?

10
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,879
Well, I'm just saying,
it's improbable

11
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,674
that somebody would wanna walk down
the stairs with one slipper.

12
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,301
Well, it's late at night,
she wants to go to the bathroom,

13
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,513
she forgets her slipper.
She's disoriented, you know?

14
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,057
There's only one point of impact
and it's severe enough

15
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,894
that she fell from a 12-foot height,
not rolling down the stairs.

16
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,521
You're right.

17
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,606
What are you on, Twitter?

18
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,483
Put the phone away.

19
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,320
I mean, it's within
the realm of possibilities

20
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,530
that she might have been thrown.

21
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,158
Right?

22
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,995
"Now that the apartment across
the hall is vacant

23
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,082
"I would like very much to discuss
purchasing it for myself.

24
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,458

sweet darling had a good life,

27
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,801

than most people would actually desire. "

28
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,642
NYPD. Open up.

29
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,149
NYPD.

30
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,408
"Please also take into consideration

34
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:19,378
"Best, Abigail Clayton. "

35
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,506
So, can you tell me about the tenants

36
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,091
that live across the hall
from Mrs. Lonnigan?

37
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,261
That's, um... That's Abigail Clayton.

38
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,390
Abigail Clayton.
Well, can you tell me about her?

39
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,642
Well, not...

40
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,147
Not really, sir.
I've actually never met her.

41
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,732
You've never met her?

42
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,983
No. I'm very sorry.

43
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,110
Klandermann. Yes.

44
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,363
Just a few more hours, actually,
is what I've been told.

45
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,240
Can I get a coffee?
It's unavoidable, yes.

46
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,576
We're so sorry for the... Yes.

47
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,370
It is a disturbance.
You're...

48
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,122
Yup. Thank you.

49
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,499
I'm sorry.
What were you asking me?

50
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,251
You were saying that you've never met
the tenant who lives across...

51
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,754
No. No, no, I haven't.
I've been here now...

52
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,672
It's been 11 years.
Oh, my.

53
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:07,510
She was in the apartment before I arrived,
yes, so we've never met.

54
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,137
In 11 years, you've never had any
interaction with her personally?

55
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:11,639
That's not completely true, sir.

56
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,933
Every day or night
at a specific time

57
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,268
she will pass a letter to me
underneath the door.

58
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,729
I'm the only one in the building
who communicates with her.

59
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,148
Food, clothing, you name it, I deliver it.

60
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,776
I leave it in the hallway,
I knock, I leave.

61
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,861
She never goes out. Ever.

62
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,948
Yeah, so, in that sense,
we have had communication, yes.

63
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,452
That's a little strange.
Well, this is Columbus Circle, sir.

64
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,996
Nothing seems strange around here.

65
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,460
All right,I'm gonna have to ask you
to come into the station...

66
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,629
Really?... after you get off.
What time will that be?

67
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,631
Is that absolutely...

68
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,800
30. I get off at 9:30.

69
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,677
Yeah, so...

70
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,055
I'm gonna go try one more time.

71
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:57,852
Miss Clayton?
Open up, please. It's NYPD.

72
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,063
I know you're in there.
Look, I tried to call, I...

73
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,732
I just need two minutes of your time.

74
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,569
Fine. We can do this one of two ways.

75
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,904
You can let me in now and I'll make it
short and sweet

76
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,532
or I'll come back later with a warrant
and a bunch of other guys.

77
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:15,411
And from what I understand,
you won't like that too much.

78
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,581
All right, fine, I'll get a warrant.

79
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,748
Creepy hallway.

80
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,591
Hello? Oh, hey.

81
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,847
Uh, Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

82
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,766
I just needed to talk to you
about your neighbor, if I may.

83
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,686
I didn't know her.

84
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,106
I'm sorry. I'm very busy right now.

85
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,028
Look, nobody... I'm gonna come in
here for a second.

86
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,821
I'll shut the door.

87
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,158
Look, nobody's in trouble.
I'm just following protocol.

88
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,618
I just needed a few minutes of your time.

89
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,621
You live right across the hall from her.

90
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,872
Right.

91
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,046
Wow, this is a really
beautiful apartment you have.

92
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,925
Is that what they teach you
in detective school?

93
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,637
Charm me with false praise and then
we're sitting down for coffee?

94
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,599
Well, if you're offering,you know,
I'd love a cup of coffee. I...

95
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,559
in the morning.

96
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,770
I came from another case,
I've been up all night.

97
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,188
Coffee would be great.

98
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,526
You cook?

99
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,949
- Yes.
- Are you expecting somebody at this hour?

100
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,660
I imagine that you already
know the answer to that one.

101
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,663
Okay, you got me.
That was dishonest. I, uh...

102
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,374
I was just trying to break the ice.

103
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:47,670
Yeah, well, I'm not interested in breaking
ice or engaging in small talk,

104
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,046
so I'd very much like it if you would

105
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,340
just get to the point so that I can

106
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,717
get on with my morning.

107
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,178
So no coffee?

108
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,069
How long have you lived here?

109
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,659
You wanted to talk to
me about my neighbor?

110
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,327
Thank you. Uh...

111
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,954
Yeah, that's right.

112
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,872
This is really nice.

113
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,916
She was old

114
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,378
and it's my understanding she was
sick for quite a while.

115
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,631
I don't know.
Well, from what I put together, uh,

116
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:33,966
she was feeling a lot better.

117
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,845
You know, she liked to take the stairs
instead of the elevator.

118
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:41,015
She preferred to walk
instead of taking a cab.

119
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,475
Hmm. Well, if you say so.

120
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,983
So, your concierge says that you
don't like to get out that much.

121
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,651
I suppose so.

122
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,904
Are you, uh...

123
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,740
What is that? Um...

124
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,325
Agoraphobic?

125
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,160
Well, if you insist.

126
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,663
No, no offense. You know, I suffer
from arachnophobia.

127
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,415
Really?

128
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,499
Mmm-hmm.

129
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,501
Yeah. That's a fear of spiders.

130
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:13,756
Well, what I wouldn't do
for a shoebox full of tarantulas right now.

131
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,844
You're pretty witty for a lady that
doesn't get out that much.

132
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,680
Are you here to talk
about me or Hilary?

133
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,224
Hilary?

134
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:26,935
That was her name.

135
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,395
But I thought you
didn't know her at all.

136
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,064
No, Detective, I did not.

137
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,775
So why would you call her by her first name
if you didn't know her at all?

138
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,110
All right.
Are we done yet?

139
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,698
No. Just a few more minutes.

140
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,368
Um, over the last
couple of days or weeks,

141
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,037
were there any strange visitors

142
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,122
or anything out of the ordinary

143
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,876
that you were aware of
coming from the apartment?

144
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,215
No strange sounds last night when she died?

145
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,426
Since I don't know when she died,
day or night,

146
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,929
and since I've already made it clear

147
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:07,142
that I didn't hear anything out of the 
ordinary coming from her apartment,

148
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,313
then I'd venture to
guess that we are entering

149
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,234
into an area of... Hmm, redundancy?

150
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,571
Okay, now we're done.

151
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,616
Thank you for the coffee.
I'm gonna give you a couple of cards.

152
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:27,121
If you think of anything,
uh, call me.

153
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,415
Thank you. I will.

154
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:33,794
Okay.

155
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,841
Hey, this is a really nice vase.

156
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,385
It's a little confusing,
but it's nice.

157
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,637
I'm sure you could
figure it out.

158
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,929
Her name is Justine Waters,

159
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,348
and she was known as 
"America's little darling. "

160
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,309
The sole heiress of the Waters fortune,

161
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,895
estimated in the hundreds of
millions of dollars,

162
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,732
she mysteriously disappeared
17 years ago this month.

163
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,734
Take a look at these
home videos of Justine.

164
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,112
They show her at the Waters
family summer cottage in upstate New York.

165
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,906
As you can see, Justine is being filmed

166
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,741
showcasing her hula hoop skills.

167
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,286
At the time, she held
the world record of 14 straight hours.

168
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,414
Now, there's been much speculation on
Justine's whereabouts.

169
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,334
Theories range from her running off
with a Saudi prince

170
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,336
to her being a victim of foul play.

171
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,922
Now while the great
and powerful Phillip Waters

172
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,007
claimed until his
death five years ago

173
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,051
that he never stopped
looking for his daughter,

174
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,387
Justine's 17-year silence

175
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,933
remains the most talked about missing
persons mystery to date.

176
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,227
In the days leading up
to what would become

177
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,978
her historic vanishing act,

178
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,856
it was rumored that
18-year-old Justine Waters

179
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:22,194
had just become engaged to Prince Achmed
Mustafi of Jordan.

180
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,197
What did happen to Justine Waters?

181
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,366
And will we ever see her again?

182
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,409
I'm Jerry Penacoli for Extra.

183
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,956
I'm wondering if you could help me identify

184
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,085
this crest?

185
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,046
- Interesting.
- Yeah? Why is that?

186
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,132
Well, this could be a family crest.

187
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,843
This is the letter "M," correct?

188
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:50,013
Well, that was the intention.
The drawing is rough, but...

189
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,557
Well, where'd you find this?

190
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,977
I can't really tell you.
I just need to find out what it is.

191
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,521
Okay. I got a book in the back,

192
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,606
something of an almanac, so to speak.

193
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,316
Might be able to find a match.

194
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,735
How long do you think...
Oh, one second.

195
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,861
Yeah?

196
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,863
Yeah, I went through all the evidence
like you asked.

197
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,199
Hey, put it out. Step on it.

198
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,701
- Yeah, what do you got?
- Not much.

199
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:11,994
The only thing that
might interest you

200
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,287
are some prescription medications,

201
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,454
but she was an old woman.

202
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:15,664
Well, do we know who the doctor is?

203
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,584
Yeah, some doctor in Westchester County.

204
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,168
We got a name?

205
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,755
Yeah, a Dr. Raymond Fontaine.

206
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,257
Okay, one second.

207
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,385
Let me give you my card
and I'll just wait for your phone call.

208
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,678
All right, Frank.
Take it easy.

209
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,013
All right, thanks, Howie.

210
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,370
Well, the view is definitely amazing.

211
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,290
As you can see, we're directly
over Columbus Circle,

212
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,376
which by the way, is the exact point
from which all distances

213
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,171
to and from New York City
are officially measured.

214
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:07,799
The owner completely renovated
and refurbished the entire unit

215
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,510
with all the latest
and greatest amenities.

216
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,055
Top-of-the-line kitchen by Pedini.

217
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,766
There's only two units
on the penthouse level.

218
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,145
Twenty-four-hour doorman, concierge.
It's a full-service building.

219
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,982
And we are getting another offer
later today, so...

220
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,651
I think you guys are the right fit.

221
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,736
If I were you, I'd make a move.

222
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,701
What do you think?

223
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,620
I love it.
Good.

224
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,248
Mmm.

225
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,001
They rented the apartment!

226
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,753
How could this have happened?

227
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,713
I wrote half a dozen letters!

228
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,216
I agree, Abby, this is simply outrageous.

229
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,385
They haven't returned
any of my phone calls, either.

230
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,595
Is there anything we
can do to stop this?

231
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,764
I will look into it immediately.

232
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,558
I need to see you, Ray.
Abby, I'm busy.

233
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,188
I said I need to see you, Ray.

234
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,898
I'm in the middle of something.

235
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,109
Raymond! Now!

236
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,946
You know, the police
were here. In my home.

237
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,115
Of course the police were here, Abby.

238
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:14,491
And that doesn't bother you?

239
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,244
The police were here
because Hilary died.

240
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,622
She had a fall and they're
investigating her death.

241
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,709
You live across the hall,
so of course they're gonna inquire

242
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,627
if you heard anything suspicious.

243
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,295
Once they deduce that her death

244
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,464
was an accident, which it 
most certainly was,

245
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,884
they'll have no need
to bother you any further.

246
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,806
One of the detectives
left me his card.

247
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,015
Oh.

248
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,856
Ray, how many wallets have I bought you
through the years?

249
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,399
Abigail, I'm attached to this.

250
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,485
It was a gift from your mother
on my first day of medical school.

251
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,529
I'll never part with it.

252
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,074
It's just that I don't
want things to change.

253
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,368
Okay? I just need
things to stay the same.

254
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,579
I just need things to continue...
Abby, Abby.

255
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,331
...as they have been.
This is a disruption.

256
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,710
Well, if change is
what you don't want,

257
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,796
I strongly advise
that you stop inquiring

258
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,798
about the apartment across the hall.

259
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:15,177
And it's sort of academic.
The apartment is leased.

260
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:19,306
And they're gonna lead their lives
just as Hilary led hers.

261
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,892
Not a peep.

262
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,019
Ray.

263
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,103
Abigail.

264
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,358
You've gotta trust me, girl.

265
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,029
You've gotta calm down.

266
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,742
I promise you,

267
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,702
everything ‘ll be fine.

268
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,498
Haven't I always been there for you?

269
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,374
Hmm?

270
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,629
And by "always," I mean for
the better part of your life.

271
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,216
Okay, sweetie.

272
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,518
Good morning, Mr. Stanford.
Good morning.

273
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,855
Oh, hello, sir.

274
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,565
Klandermann.

275
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,453
Mr. Stanford, if you
don't mind me saying so,

276
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:26,289
I've got this sense
that I know you somehow.

277
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,583
Really?

278
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,918
Yeah. It's as if we...

279
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,755
I don't know, we met
somewhere or something.

280
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,633
I kinda get that a lot.

281
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,343
I guess I just have one of those faces.

282
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,638
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's probably it. Huh.

283
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,935
Sure smells good coming out of
that loft of yours.

284
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,603
I'm guessing Miss Lillian’s the...

285
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,355
Yeah, she's the chef in the family.

286
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,275
Yeah.
It's amazing I don't weigh 300 pounds.

287
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,235
I don't understand it.

288
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,717
Son of a bitch!

289
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,803
Well, it's a little too late for that!
You started it, Lillian!

290
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:25,807
You son of a bitch!
God damn it! Why are you doing this?

291
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,476
Jesus!
Tell me one more time

292
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,770
to keep my voice down,
I swear to God...

293
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,230
I don't want the help to hear.

294
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,356
Who gives a shit?

295
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,358
I'm not gonna talk to you
when you're like this.

296
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,194
I just wanna go
inside, okay? Charlie...

297
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,488
You're not going anywhere, bitch!

298
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,783
Little slut!
God damn it, I'm going back inside.

299
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,619
We're gonna finish this.

300
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,455
Just shut up!
Oh, you don't want the help to hear!

301
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,916
Well, I'm paying them
enough to plug their ears!

302
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,835
God damn it.
You're drunk! I want to go back inside.

303
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,504
You're not going anywhere.

304
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,343
Bitch! Did you just hit me?
Is that what you did?

305
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,511
You don't ever hit me!

306
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,764
Bitch!

307
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,724
I'm sorry!

308
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,268
Don't ever hit Charlie!

309
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,854
Do you understand that?

310
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,440
Remember where you come from.

311
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,442
Remember, you bitch!

312
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:33,995
Miss?

313
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:40,835
Help me.

314
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,839
Please.

315
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,176
Do I call 911?

316
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,719
No.

317
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,514
I don't want him to go to jail.

318
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,775
You have to stand up.
Stand up!

319
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,903
Help me.
Stand up!

320
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,255
Shh.

321
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,100
It's okay.

322
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,436
Be quiet.

323
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,568
Lillian.
Shh.

324
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,903
Just don't let him in.

325
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,279
It's Charlie.

326
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,157
I'm sorry.

327
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,492
Please just open the door.

328
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,916
Come on, I'm sorry.
Let's just talk about this.

329
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,419
Lillian!

330
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,671
Shit. Please...

331
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,298
Lillian, open the door.

332
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,969
Open the fucking door!

333
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:16,699
Oh, great.

334
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,248
Mmm. Mmm.

335
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,334
Thank you.

336
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,879
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

337
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,465
What are you sorry for?

338
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,843
I'm just sorry because you're
involved now in this.

339
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,931
And I didn't mean for this to happen.

340
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,892
Well, you needn't be sorry.

341
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:51,609
He works so hard and when he works,
he sometimes gets stressed

342
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:54,988
and when he's under a lot of pressure,
he drinks a lot.

343
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:58,741
And I think I set him off,
and I don't mean to.

344
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,035
I feel so bad.

345
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,372
Why are you making excuses for him?

346
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,667
'Cause you really don't know him.
He's a really, um...

347
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,756
Reliable guy.

348
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,633
Stop apologizing for him.

349
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:17,885
Stop it.

350
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,722
I do love him.

351
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,242
Why would someone kill a violinist?

352
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,828
This job really sucks sometimes.

353
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,332
Why would an 80-year-old
woman wanna jump off her balcony?

354
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,752
See this here?
This is how I like my crime scene.

355
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,296
That over there is a torso, a head,

356
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,174
and right down here...

357
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,383
Oh, God.

358
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,593
What the hell is that?

359
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,137
You see, this is what
a murder scene looks like.

360
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,890
What, so you don't think
this is a suicide as well?

361
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,062
You, my friend, are a sick bastard.

362
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,564
I'm just saying, nine years on the job,
it just doesn't add up.

363
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,776
What's interesting is
the girl across the hall.

364
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,236
Oh, I see what this is about.

365
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,696
What, she's hot?

366
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,281
Yeah, she was attractive.
I knew it.

367
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,449
No, here's the thing.

368
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,701
I ran her through the system, right?
Please.

369
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,371
There's nothing on her.
She doesn't have a social security number.

370
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,289
She doesn't have a driver's License,
nothing.

371
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:32,377
A woman like that, living in 
Columbus Circle, with all that money?

372
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,587
It just doesn't make sense.

373
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,216
You know, she hasn't left her
apartment in years.

374
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,260
This is New York City.
It's a town full of nuts.

375
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,388
No, she didn't look crazy.

376
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,848
How did she look?

377
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,018
She looked like a victim.

378
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,192
Mmm...

379
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:44,907
Oh, my God.

380
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,662
I can't believe I fell asleep here.

381
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,129
What time is it?

382
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,090
30.

383
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,258
Oh, wow.

384
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,387
Almost nine hours.
Oh, my God.

385
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,392
I'm sorry if I invaded your space.

386
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,395
It's all right.

387
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,647
Would you like me to pour you some tea?

388
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,608
No, no, no, that's okay.
I just...

389
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,402
I need to get going.
Thank you, though.

390
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,322
Oh, God, Charlie’s gonna kill me.

391
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,909
It looks like he already
tried to do that last night.

392
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,577
Does it look bad?

393
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,248
Do you have a mirror?

394
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,920
It's right there.

395
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:49,472
Oh...

396
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,533
I feel so stupid.

397
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:10,660
No.

398
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,622
I do. I just feel so stupid.

399
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,335
I don't even know you

400
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:22,547
and here I am dragging you into this.

401
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,383
It's all right.

402
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,551
God.

403
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,725
It's all right.
Don't. Don't.

404
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,896
Why don't you sit down?

405
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,276
I'll pour you some tea.

406
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,326
Thank you.

407
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,246
You've been so nice.

408
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,503
I'm sorry.

409
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,008
Charlie’s not such a bad guy.

410
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,884
I don't want you to hate him.

411
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,179
Well, he made a terrible
first impression.

412
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,015
I know.

413
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,308
He did.

414
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,027
Can I ask you a question?

415
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,574
Why don't you like
having any visitors?

416
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:35,911
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.

417
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,706
That's what the real estate agent said.

418
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:47,256
Well, I guess I just decided a long time ago
that I'd rather be alone.

419
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,300
That's not so strange.

420
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,844
Sometimes I just wanna run away

421
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:59,018
and be somewhere where nobody knows me
and I could just start over.

422
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,903
I know.

423
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,906
So what did you do?

424
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,158
I told you.
He was coming back.

425
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:18,496
So I went out into the hallway
and I brought her in.

426
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,998
The hall? You went into the hall?

427
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,167
You know, she reminded me of...

428
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,587
Well, you know, you were there.
And...

429
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,756
Well, I was...

430
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,093
I was just a child then and,

431
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,056
well, I wasn't gonna just stand there

432
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,100
and watch this happen.

433
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,935
So you called the police,
of course.

434
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,313
No.

435
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,273
What happened?

436
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,569
Well, when she woke up this morning...

437
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,780
"When she woke up"?
You mean she slept over?

438
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,366
Well, it was hardly
a slumber party, Ray.

439
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,326
She was injured

440
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,578
and she passed out.

441
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,414
What's her name?

442
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:04,959
Lillian.

443
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,462
Is she still there?

444
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,299
No.

445
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,176
She left.

446
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,679
She gonna be safe there?

447
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:22,685
I don't know.

448
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,019
Oh, Abby.

449
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,731
What are you gonna do now?

450
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,192
You know as well as anyone
this sort of thing only gets worse.

451
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:33,446
I don't know. It's not
my responsibility, right?

452
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,531
Maybe you should consider
that now that you've helped her

453
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,575
she'll likely come back
to you for help again.

454
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,952
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do next time?

455
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,036
No.

456
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,414
Gimme a mini. Yeah.
Schmear?

457
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,459
I just know I don't
wanna be involved.

458
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,752
It's a little late for that.

459
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:51,756
And Abigail, it's unfair for you
to give her refuge and solace

460
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,341
and then when she comes knocking again
to ignore her.

461
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,845
Maybe you could be proactive
and talk to her, help her.

462
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,472
I don't know.

463
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,266
Well, it's something to consider.
She's your neighbor.

464
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,684
You have something in common.

465
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:06,103
Maybe you should have her for dinner,
over to your place.

466
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:09,607
I don't think I'm entirely comfortable
with that idea, Ray.

467
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,816
Think about it.

468
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:11,901
All right.

469
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:14,737
Are you eating?

470
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:15,863
Yeah.

471
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,823
Bagel with a schmear.
Bye.

472
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,516
You really banged me up.

473
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,228
I'm sorry.

474
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,897
I mean it.

475
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:56,237
I love you.

476
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,670
Thank you, Bubba.

477
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,255
You're welcome, Miss Hart.

478
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,092
Miss Lillian, can I help you
with that, please?

479
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,219
I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry!
Wait.

480
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,763
I've got it.
No, don't, wait.

481
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,224
You having fun down there,
Klandermann?

482
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,600
No, sir.
No, sir, not at all.

483
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,685
I was just trying to help with...

484
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,979
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Let me help. Oh, good.

485
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,897
This...
I shouldn't see that.

486
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,191
It's fine.
Okay. All right. I'll get the elevator.

487
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,237
There we are.

488
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,822
I'm so sorry.
I was trying to help.

489
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,198
Don't worry about it.
There were just so many bags.

490
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,283
I didn't realize...
It's fine.

491
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,703
It's not all for me.
I bought you a new tie.

492
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,454
A new tie?

493
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,209
A new tie.
A new tie? Yeah...

494
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,880
Right here, sir?

495
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,715
On the counter, please.
Uh-huh.

496
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,134
Excuse me, sorry.
Thank you.

497
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,145
Everything all right, Klandermann?

498
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,688
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

499
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,023
Well, no.

500
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:15,816
That's, uh...

501
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,109
That's where I found her.

502
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:19,987
Found who?

503
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,655
Mrs. Lonnigan, the previous tenant.

504
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,074
What do you mean?
Well, that's...

505
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,410
I was the one that found her. Right here.

506
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,915
They said she fell down the stairs.

507
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,334
I didn't know that.

508
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,252
She was such a sweet old lady, too,
you know?

509
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:36,629
Everybody loved her in the building.

510
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,839
Always had something sweet to say

511
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,549
and always made everybody smile.

512
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:41,842
The whole building
loved her, really.

513
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,844
That's so sad.

514
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,013
I'd just never seen
anybody die before.

515
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,099
What do you mean?

516
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:53,187
She wasn't dead yet
when I found her. No.

517
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,357
We got a call, the tenant down below,
Henderson,

518
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,275
they heard a real loud...

519
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,278
And I raced to...
And the door was unlocked,

520
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:05,824
which is quite unusual for a building 
like this, I'll tell you that. And, uh...

521
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:09,203
But it seemed as if she were still
trying to speak.

522
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:13,165
What was she trying to say?
Oh, I have no idea.

523
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,751
See, I'd never seen
anything and there she...

524
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:19,630
It was... It was awful, so it's all kind of
a blur now, you know.

525
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:22,633
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a shame.

526
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,052
I mean, I have an idea.
I shouldn't say that.

527
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,096
I haven't told anybody this before,
but when I found her

528
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,558
it sounded like she was
trying to say, uh, "Why?"

529
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,229
"Why?"
But it was a "Why me?

530
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,065
"Why did this happen to me?"
kind of "why. " Does that make

531
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:41,777
any, uh...

532
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,574
I'm so sorry.
I should not be here.

533
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,493
I'm so sorry to take up your time.

534
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,538
Do you need any help unloading these
bags at all or...

535
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,206
I'll remember how I
know you, Mr. Stanford.

536
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,916
I swear I will.
I'm so sorry I haven't.

537
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,419
All right, let me know when you do.
Sure thing.

538
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,507
What was that about?

539
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,051
He thinks he knows me.

540
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,345
Does he?

541
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,596
I don't think so.

542
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,043
Hi. Sorry.

543
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,794
This, um... From...

544
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,005
You're good?

545
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,424
Thank you.
Okay.

546
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:55,142
Please come see me
when you are alone. Abigail.

547
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:06,445
Before you moved around, you were 
just in Bakersfield that whole time?

548
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,072
Bakersfield, California.

549
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:12,117
My mom drank, mostly to get away
from my father,

550
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,912
who also drank.

551
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,331
Hmm.

552
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,084
Was he abusive?
Yeah.

553
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,252
That's pretty much why I left,

554
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,923
because I couldn't take it anymore.
I was 15

555
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:30,052
and I had $7.20 to my name.

556
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,430
And I had fallen in love with Charlie

557
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,684
and he's pretty much
just taken care of me.

558
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,437
I couldn't...

559
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:42,648
I couldn't stay with
someone who hurt me.

560
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,984
I mean, we have a good time,
but I don't really...

561
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,239
I wouldn't really have
anything without him.

562
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,159
I just couldn't do it.

563
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,286
So what's the alternative?

564
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,211
Would you like some more wine?
Yes, please.

565
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,135
So where's your family?

566
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,594
My mom died.

567
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,388
And your father?

568
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,890
Oh, he...
He's dead, too.

569
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,892
Oh.

570
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,061
Were you close with them?

571
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,730
I was close with my mother.

572
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,107
Mmm-hmm.

573
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,151
My dad...

574
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,194
My dad drank as well

575
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:32,573
and he'd fly off the handle.
He'd go into these rages.

576
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,285
And he would beat my mother and me

577
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:38,912
when I tried to protect her.

578
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:41,874
Mmm-hmm.

579
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,294
Hmm.

580
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,754
My father could control anything.

581
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,679
So you grew up rich?

582
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:02,686
I suppose.

583
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,938
Well, I grew up in the trailer park.

584
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,484
Lucky me.

585
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,946
Do you have any brothers or sisters?

586
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,114
Nope.

587
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:15,991
Just me.

588
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,577
You?
No. Just me, too.

589
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,538
So how'd you disappear?

590
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,126
Haven't I always been there for you?

591
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,628
My father had a friend.

592
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:30,923
My father had a friend and he knew
how bad my father could be

593
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:34,343
and what he was capable of,
so he helped me to...

594
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:35,552
He helped me.

595
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,932
You know, I didn't intentionally...
I didn't set out intentionally

596
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:44,519
to not go out again. I just...

597
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,814
You know, I went
to the grocery store

598
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,859
and I'd sneak out at night,

599
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:53,820
go to Central Park.

600
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:58,867
I was always amazed
at how quiet everything was.

601
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,411
Such a big city.

602
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:04,831
I wanna take you outside.

603
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:08,502
There's this flower shop.
It's a block away.

604
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,213
I wanna take you there.

605
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,839
It smells so incredible

606
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,009
and I wanna pick out
your favorite flowers.

607
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,638
And then a block further
is this rare bookstore

608
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:23,767
that smells kind of musky
and it has the most incredible books,

609
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,770
and there's this window seating and we can
pick out some books

610
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,647
and read together.

611
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,608
I don't think I'd feel safe.

612
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,360
I would be with you,

613
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,237
protecting you.

614
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,156
You can't stay in here for the 
rest of your life. Look at you.

615
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,242
You're so beautiful.

616
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,039
You're stunning.

617
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,251
I wanna take you out into the world.

618
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,558
You smell his lavender?

619
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:08,186
Let's see if he's in the backyard.

620
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,482
This is a nice house.
I should've been a doctor.

621
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,067
Hello?

622
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,405
You smell paint?

623
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:23,285
Oh, for Christ's sake.

624
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,204
My good shoes.
My mom's gonna have a fit.

625
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,582
I just painted that porch.

626
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,335
I'm so sorry.

627
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,129
We had no idea.

628
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:38,592
I'm so sorry.
You must be Dr. Ray Fontaine?

629
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,135
Yes.

630
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,636
Yeah, I'm Detective Frank Giardello.

631
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,013
This is my partner, Jerry Eaans.

632
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:46,141
Two detectives and you couldn't figure out
the porch was freshly painted?

633
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,518
We're really sorry.

634
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:51,646
We were wondering if we could have
a few minutes of your time.

635
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,483
Sure. Would it be all right
if we spoke out here? Uh...

636
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,276
Oh, yeah.
That would be fine.

637
00:44:56,736 --> 00:45:00,238
Yeah, we wanted to talk to you about
Mrs. Hilary Lonnigan.

638
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,074
Sure. What about her?

639
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,159
Well, I'm sure that you're aware
that she...

640
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,577
She passed away a couple of weeks ago.

641
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,704
Of course. I was her doctor.

642
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:10,165
Yeah. Could you tell
us about her health?

643
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,334
She'd been ill for a while.

644
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,795
- Oh, yeah, she was ill.
- With what?

645
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:18,757
It was in remission, actually.

646
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,759
Any dizzy spells, anything like that?

647
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:24,471
She never complained of any.
She did have tendencies to push herself.

648
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,849
She was one of those people who
didn't like standing still.

649
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:31,978
- Why?
- Well, she was pretty badly injured.

650
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,315
Well, she did fall
down the staircase. Yeah.

651
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,818
What are you suggesting?

652
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,611
Oh, no, no. We're not
suggesting anything.

653
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,489
We're just trying to find out
whether or not we, uh...

654
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,241
We have a homicide on our hands.

655
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,743
We'd like to see her medical records,
if that's all right.

656
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:48,912
Of course.
I'd need a subpoena.

657
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,039
Doctor-patient confidentiality.
Of course.

658
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:53,542
Why don't we do this?
Why don't I give you one of my cards...

659
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,585
Thank you. All right.
... and we'll be in touch.

660
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,546
It was a pleasure to meet you.
Yeah, it's good to meet you.

661
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,256
- What's your dog's name?
- Oh, this is Digger.

662
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,549
- Digger?
- Yeah.

663
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,008
All right. Thanks.

664
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,218
All right.

665
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,553
Oh! By the way,

666
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,513
do you know Abigail Clayton?

667
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,766
Uh, again, Officer,
doctor-patient confidentiality.

668
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:11,560
Oh. Yeah.

669
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,812
We don't want to take up
anymore of your time. Thank you.

670
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,605
Thank you.
You gentlemen have a good evening.

671
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:16,898
You, too.
Woah!

672
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,483
Stop that.

673
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:32,497
What?

674
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:34,833
Well, I didn't ask him
if she was a patient.

675
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,043
I asked him if he knew her.

676
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:47,846
You're doing good.
You're doing great.

677
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,140
Good.

678
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,392
Amazing, Abigail.
Abigail...

679
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:56,104
Lillian, why are we even doing this?
I don't want to leave.

680
00:46:56,189 --> 00:46:58,815
We're doing this because
it's good to get out of the apartment.

681
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,735
You're doing beautifully.
Look at you.

682
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,403
That's enough, Lillian...
No, no, no.

683
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,531
Okay, okay.

684
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,576
Great.
You're doing great.

685
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,288
I don't feel well.

686
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:14,498
It's okay. I know.

687
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:15,999
This is far enough.

688
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,212
You're doing great.
I'm here for you. I'm here for you.

689
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,422
Abigail.

690
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:33,683
Hold the door.
Oh! I got it, sir.

691
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,103
I got it.
Come on in. There you go.

692
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,106
We're gonna at least
walk to that table over there.

693
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,609
No, I think... I think
we've gone far enough.

694
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,321
Everything all right tonight?
Sir?

695
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,405
Uh-huh.

696
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,535
Good.
I'm not ready yet.

697
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,537
Okay? Okay.
Okay.

698
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:55,747
Okay.

699
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:58,041
Hey, this is me.
Ah...

700
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:07,300
I just remembered where I know you from.

701
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,053
Yeah.

702
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:15,559
One, two,

703
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,270
three.

704
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,733
Come on! There you go! Good!
Great job! Great job!

705
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:27,904
BeautifuI.

706
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:31,866
Oh, God.

707
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,132
You must be Abigail.

708
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:50,427
You feeling all right,
sweetheart?

709
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,014
Here, let me help.

710
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:58,268
Huh?
Don't touch her! Don't touch her, please!

711
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,769
Just don't.

712
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,479
Okay? Okay?

713
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,690
Don't, don't. Please don't.

714
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,193
Charlie, please.

715
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,749
You ladies have a good night.

716
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:23,001
Just stay here for a second.

717
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,297
No, no!

718
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,424
Please don't go in there!

719
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,967
Please don't!
Charlie, what are you doing?

720
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:35,055
I don't want him to see anything
in my apartment.

721
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,307
Stay right here.
He's violent! He's in my apartment.

722
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,975
Abigail!

723
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,823
When you get her out of her apartment,

724
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:57,452
I install some computer software
so that when she goes online,

725
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,329
we'll be able to get
her banking password.

726
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,955
Right. Got it.
Got it?

727
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,208
It's like stealing
the identity of a ghost.

728
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,835
Exactly.
She wants to remain hidden.

729
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:09,422
And after we've got the money,
who the hell is she gonna run to?

730
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,510
We've got her account information,
her social security number,

731
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:16,721
her signature, but we still need
to get your fake ID.

732
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:19,140
It's just so perfect.

733
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:22,936
We're talking about hundreds of
millions of dollars.

734
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,729
No more nickel and dime shit.

735
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:26,773
Just sunsets and mimosas, baby.

736
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,067
And once we get the password

737
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:31,569
we're home free.

738
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:34,781
Happy birthday.

739
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,616
Thank you.
I love you, baby.

740
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:37,784
I love you.

741
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:43,289
Abigail, please!
What is he doing in my apartment?

742
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:46,042
You can't.
You can't follow him.

743
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,211
He's been drinking!
Abigail! He's been drinking.

744
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,880
You can't, no.
He gets really violent.

745
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,133
You don't want him to hit you.
You don't want him to hit you.

746
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:56,302
You know what it feels like.
Stay here.

747
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:05,353
Hey! That's not my apartment.

748
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,986
I'm right here.
I'm right here. Abigail.

749
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,155
I wanna go home.

750
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:19,075
I live in here and
this is how I want it.

751
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,203
I want to be alone.
This is how I want it.

752
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:24,873
You did a great job tonight, Abby.

753
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:29,419
I cannot have people in my life.

754
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,671
I cannot have you in my life.

755
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:34,883
If he is in your life,
I can't...

756
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:37,761
No, I wanna be alone.
I wanna be alone. I wanna be alone.

757
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,930
Okay.

758
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,768
I'm really sorry about Charlie.

759
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:46,519
Stop apologizing.

760
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,688
He's...

761
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,025
He is dangerous and he will only end up

762
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,527
hurting you more than he already has.

763
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:00,825
Please go.

764
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:03,870
Okay.

765
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:08,917
Please go.

766
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,759
Thank you so much for dinner tonight,
Abigail.

767
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:36,736
- First new message.
- 17 p. m.

768
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,864
Mr. Stanford?
It's Joe Klandermann.

769
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:43,076
I guess now I should call you Charlie
since we go back, huh?

770
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,703
Anyway, if you're having
trouble remembering me,

771
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:48,289
think back 12 years
ago to a holding cell.

772
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:50,500
Rahway Prison? Remember?

773
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,794
You were about to do a five-year
stretch on some con

774
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,463
and I was on my way
out after doing a deuce.

775
00:52:55,548 --> 00:52:57,340
Good times. Yeah.

776
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,758
Enough reminiscing.

777
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:02,053
Meet me at the coffee shop around
the corner on 59th Street

778
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,555
right after I get off work.

779
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:05,598
We need to talk.

780
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:09,102
You're gonna cut me in on whatever scam
you're running, Charlie.

781
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,687
I don't know
what it is, of course,

782
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:13,439
but you living here
means it's gotta be big.

783
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,650
Yeah. Don't make me wait,

784
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,694
partner.

785
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:19,654
Damn it.

786
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,890
You're crazy attacking me!

787
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,813
You're a dead man!
You hear me? You're a dead...

788
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:02,864
Tonight's top story is the bizarre death

789
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,450
of a wanted felon on Columbus Circle.

790
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,912
We go now live to Diane Weiss,
who's on the scene.

791
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:13,583
Apparently, Diane, the man was strangled
before being hit by a bus?

792
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,294
Yes, Ginger.
Police believe the victim

793
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,838
may have been fleeing from an attacker.

794
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,175
However, the victim,
Joseph Klandermann,

795
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:26,346
whose real name was Nathaniel Muskit,
was a wanted felon.

796
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:30,350
Charlie?
Muskit disappeared nearly 12 years ago

797
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:33,102
and had alluded authorities for that long.
Charlie?

798
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,313
He was convicted in 1998 for running

799
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:38,191
a Ponzi scheme that bilked investors...

800
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,777
You killed Klandermann?
Charlie?

801
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:43,613
Charlie, we don't kill people!

802
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,823
Lillian.
No, Charlie.

803
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:47,325
This is the one.

804
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,369
This is the one we've been
waiting for, Charlie!

805
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,580
He could have turned us in.
I made a decision to protect us.

806
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,249
You made a stupid
decision, Charlie.

807
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,877
I don't wanna run from the cops!

808
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,546
You don't have to be scared. Okay?

809
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:02,840
It's gonna be fine.

810
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:09,097
It's okay.

811
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,021
What does that say?

812
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,276
He wants to see us.
Yeah.

813
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:29,867
Klandermann's dead, Ray.
He's dead.

814
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:32,537
I know, I heard.
Are you all right?

815
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:34,747
I don't know.
I don't know.

816
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,124
What am I gonna do?

817
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,376
They will get a new concierge.

818
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,795
Ray, you know I can't
trust a new concierge.

819
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:44,757
I can't trust a new concierge.
Klandermann had been here so long.

820
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,719
How am I gonna trust
a new concierge, Ray?

821
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,012
Ray, I need to see you.

822
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:51,639
I can't right now. I...
I promise I'll come by later.

823
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,725
Please, Ray?
I really need to see you.

824
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:56,894
I'll see you later tonight.
You just relax.

825
00:55:57,438 --> 00:56:00,023
Take a long breath now.
For me, okay?

826
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,067
Bye.

827
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,660
This has gotten completely out of hand.

828
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,287
I understand.

829
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:15,538
No, I don't think you do.

830
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:16,998
It's all over the television.

831
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:19,917
I mean, Mrs. Lonnigan was one thing.
That had to be done.

832
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:22,086
And so did Klandermann.
Charlie?

833
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:24,714
But there was a mistake
made with Mrs. Lonnigan.

834
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,884
What are you talking about?
What is he talking about?

835
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:29,469
When were you gonna
tell me this, Charlie?

836
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,012
This is not the time
or the place for this.

837
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,513
Ray, what do you mean "mistake"?

838
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:35,224
There was obviously
a serious error made.

839
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,977
We wanted to talk to you about, uh,
Mrs. Hilary Lonnigan.

840
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:41,397
The police were here,
investigating a homicide,

841
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:44,233
not a slip and fall
of an 82-year-old woman.

842
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:46,444
I don't make mistakes.

843
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,904
Oh, apparently, you do.

844
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,908
Otherwise they wouldn't be
investigating a homicide, Charles.

845
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:53,409
Jesus Christ.

846
00:56:53,494 --> 00:56:58,623
Now thanks to me, Mrs. Lonnigan lived
a long and prosperous life,

847
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,502
three years longer than I anticipated,

848
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:05,254
and there's only a certain amount of time
one can wait.

849
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,756
But this is over now.

850
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,134
We need to discuss an exit strategy.

851
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:12,470
No, there is no exit strategy.

852
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,931
We're one e-mail away from a fortune.

853
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:18,518
Charles, how long do you think it's 
gonna take for them to figure out

854
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,353
I'm the one who owns the apartment?

855
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:22,230
That I paid for the whole thing?

856
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:23,773
It's my money!

857
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,484
Once they figure that out,
it's a short walk in the park

858
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,694
for them to put together
who Abigail is.

859
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,571
And what we're all up to.

860
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:36,661
We need to discuss an exit strategy.

861
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:44,752
He may be right, Lillian.

862
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:48,548
It's just a shame.

863
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:52,093
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go water my plants,

864
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:55,972
get over to Abigail’s, take out her trash,
pick up her cleaning,

865
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:59,433
and give her a foot massage
to calm her down,

866
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:00,768
thanks to you.

867
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:11,779
I guess I'm doomed to take care 
of this woman the rest of my life.

868
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,751
What do we do?

869
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:30,923
Let me try to talk to him.

870
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:10,523
Lillian.

871
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:17,071
Please go in the house
and make it look like it was robbed.

872
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,240
Okay?

873
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,768
- Did you roll the body?
- Yeah.

874
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,396
Did you get the phone?

875
01:00:57,738 --> 01:00:59,655
It wasn't in the house?

876
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:02,491
No.

877
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,301
It has all our information.

878
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:21,927
I know.

879
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,518
Do we walk?

880
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:33,606
No.

881
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:36,359
No. We don't walk.

882
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:38,944
We're...
We're too close.

883
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,615
With no money, how far would we get?

884
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:47,536
Look, we knew that
if things went wrong,

885
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:50,081
we'd have a backup plan, and we do.

886
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,792
Okay?

887
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,461
We... We have to force her hand.

888
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:58,297
Okay?

889
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:01,717
We have to do it now.

890
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,471
It's gonna be okay.

891
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,983
Please! Please, I need you! Open up!
Hurry, please!

892
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,237
Please! Open up! Let me in!
Open the door and let me in!

893
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:25,866
He's gonna kill me, Abigail!
Please!

894
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,537
Please, Abigail!
Open the door, please!

895
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:31,622
Please, Abigail! Please!

896
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,377
Open the door!
Open the door!

897
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:40,047
Oh, my God! Charlie, calm down!
Calm down!

898
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:41,966
Think you're gonna leave
me? No, I'm not, I swear!

899
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:44,301
Huh? You gonna leave me?
I'm not gonna leave you, Charlie! Please!

900
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:47,096
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Okay?

901
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,223
No, no, no.
No! Don't you...

902
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,601
Bitch! Get back here!

903
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:56,021
Gimme the gun!

904
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,527
Gimme the gun!

905
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:04,238
The gun! Gimme the gun!

906
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,451
I'm gonna shoot you, Charlie!
I'm gonna shoot you!

907
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:09,577
You're gonna shoot me?

908
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:10,744
I'll shoot you, Charlie!

909
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:12,121
Do it!

910
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:21,630
Charlie.

911
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:33,601
Stop! Oh, my God! Stop!
No! What are you doing?

912
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:35,895
Stop! Oh, my God! No!

913
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,105
No! Get off him.

914
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,733
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

915
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,194
What are you doing?
Charlie!

916
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:47,114
Charlie, no! Charlie, no!

917
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:51,118
Charlie, wake up!
Wake up, Charlie, my baby.

918
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,079
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

919
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,040
Charlie, wake up!
Wake up, Charlie!

920
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:59,502
You killed him, Abigail!
What have you done?

921
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:03,130
No! I didn't do it.
No, you did.

922
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:07,801
You shot him!
No! My baby. Oh, Charlie.

923
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:12,932
I have to call someone.
Charlie, don't leave me.

924
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,697
Abigail, no, you can't call anybody!
Are you crazy?

925
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:31,450
Nobody can know about this.
No, Abigail!

926
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,745
We just murdered Charlie.

927
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,499
We have to leave.
We have to get out of here.

928
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,751
No, no, I can't
go anywhere!

929
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:59,728
We're one e-mail away from a fortune.

930
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:10,322
I'm all alone and I don't know what to
do now and I need to go.

931
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,705
Please, Abigail, help me.

932
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:25,921
We need to scrape whatever money
we can together

933
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:30,175
and I need to get
out of here. Okay?

934
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,679
I have money.

935
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,561
I don't have any cash.

936
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,897
We can transfer

937
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:46,859
money from my account.

938
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:50,404
And once we get the password
we're home free.

939
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,283
I wish I could talk to Ray.

940
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:57,077
No, you can't talk to Ray.
You can't talk to anybody.

941
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:59,204
I trust him.

942
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,374
Look at me.

943
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,880
We can only trust each other now.

944
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,008
Okay?

945
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:13,427
Mmm-hmm.

946
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,845
Okay.

947
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,401
Really?
Are you kidding me?

948
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,820
You're positive?

949
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:34,073
Same guy?

950
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:35,991
So what'd you find out?

951
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:39,495
Well, I don't think that this is an "M"
you brought me, Detective.

952
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:42,122
What do you mean?
I think it's a "W."

953
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:45,125
And if it is, it could very well be

954
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,753
the crest for the Waters family.

955
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,296
Are you familiar
with the Waters family?

956
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:50,839
Yeah, of course,
of course. Yeah.

957
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:53,384
This is incredibly exciting.

958
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:57,680
Is there any chance that you could tell me
exactly where you saw this?

959
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,848
I'm sorry, I...
I can't do that.

960
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,810
I just found out
Mrs. Lonnigan's apartment

961
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:04,645
was paid for by a corporation.

962
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:07,106
Apparently, she was a nanny
for some rich family.

963
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:08,565
Guess who runs the corporation?

964
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,777
Who?
Dr. Raymond Fontaine.

965
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:15,864
Really? Let's go pay the good 
doctor a visit. Thanks, Howie.

966
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:16,949
Anytime, Frank.

967
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,041
The porch was repainted.

968
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:14,339
Anything?

969
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:18,510
No.

970
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:29,229
Dr. Fontaine?

971
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:38,947
Hello?

972
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:42,576
NYPD.

973
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:44,536
I'll go this way.

974
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,053
Frank.

975
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:03,263
Check this out.

976
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:10,521
Ray, Ray.

977
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,410
It's not mine.

978
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:35,963
I'm heading out.

979
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,633
Why don't you go take a shower and
by the time you're ready,

980
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:41,176
I will be back.

981
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:42,761
Okay.

982
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:46,598
And then we'll take care of...

983
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:52,187
Don't go anywhere.

984
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:55,232
Where would I go?

985
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:29,975
Miss Clayton, it's Detective Giardello.

986
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,229
Yes, Detective?

987
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,940
Look, I'm not calling
with the best of news.

988
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:39,818
My partner and I tracked down Dr. Fontaine

989
01:10:40,028 --> 01:10:42,988
and I'm sorry to inform you that, um, he...

990
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,282
he was found dead.
He's been murdered.

991
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,242
If you are who I think
you are, I think you're

992
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:49,077
at the center of something very dangerous.

993
01:10:49,329 --> 01:10:50,621
I'm sorry, Miss Clayton.

994
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,039
What do I do?

995
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,541
Look, we're on our way.
We're gonna be there in an hour.

996
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:56,585
Don't leave and don't
answer the door, all right?

997
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,712
Thank you, Detective.

998
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:04,801
Let's go.

999
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:31,388
I just know I don't
wanna be involved.

1000
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:34,516
I think you should
have her for dinner.

1001
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:37,477
I wanna take you outside.

1002
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:38,729
She reminded me of...

1003
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,024
Well, you know, you were there.

1004
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:44,943
Well, I was...

1005
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,112
I was just a child then.

1006
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:52,159
No, you can't talk to Ray.
You can't talk to anybody.

1007
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:55,328
You've gotta trust me, girl.

1008
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,337
Excuse me.

1009
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:06,923
I'd like to see someone
about closing an account.

1010
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:09,051
That would be Mr. Ross,
the bank manager.

1011
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:10,844
His desk is right over there.

1012
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,262
Thank you.

1013
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:15,891
Giardello.

1014
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:18,185
Detective, this is Abigail Clayton.

1015
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:20,937
We're on our way. Is everything
all right? On your way?

1016
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:23,106
Yeah, since we last spoke.

1017
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:25,067
Since we last spoke?
Two weeks ago?

1018
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,235
No, we spoke less than a half hour ago.

1019
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,405
No, you must be mistaken. I was in
the shower. I didn't take any calls.

1020
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:32,032
That wasn't you I was talking to?

1021
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:33,784
No. Oh, my God.

1022
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:38,413
How can I help you?
I'd like to close out an account.

1023
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:40,123
All right.

1024
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:45,587
You can hang on to this.

1025
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:53,887
All righty.

1026
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,431
Account closure.

1027
01:13:56,974 --> 01:14:00,310
Um... May I have
the account pass code, please?

1028
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,647
Hulahoop14.

1029
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:13,031
Huh.

1030
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,454
Oh, there we go.

1031
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:28,255
All right, Miss Clayton.

1032
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:33,260
Everything appears
to be in order here.

1033
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,011
Wonderful.

1034
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:39,558
Now, before we finish,
I'm required to ask you a few questions.

1035
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,102
I apologize.
It'll just take a few minutes of your time.

1036
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:46,773
Justine Waters has decided
to come out of hiding.

1037
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:52,821
Out of ink.

1038
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,532
Oh, it's gonna be one
of those days, all right.

1039
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:59,035
She will be at the Waters Bank,
59th and Broadway.

1040
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:00,579
All right.

1041
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:03,456
Were you at any time
dissatisfied with our service?

1042
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:06,501
No.

1043
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:08,712
Glad to hear it.

1044
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:11,590
She goes by the name
Abigail Clayton and...

1045
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:14,676
May I ask, what are your reasons
for withdrawing your money?

1046
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,012
She'll be wearing a black dress.

1047
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:18,680
I'm leaving the country.

1048
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,891
Wonderful!
Are you going to Europe?

1049
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:23,059
I was just in Paris
with my fiancée.

1050
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:26,188
We stayed at...
Oh, God, what is the name of that hotel?

1051
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:29,524
It was great. It had
these butlers in it and...

1052
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:34,112
Oh, man, what is
the name of that hotel?

1053
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,448
Excuse me.

1054
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:38,241
Fellas, how's it going?

1055
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:41,995
Looks like you guys got a busy day
ahead of you, huh?

1056
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,705
Make sure you stay
hydrated out there.

1057
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:47,459
Remember, only stop at the red
lights and the short skirts, huh?

1058
01:15:51,923 --> 01:15:53,048
Okay.

1059
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:56,218
Are you all right?

1060
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,720
Yes... Yes, I'm...

1061
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:03,099
I just need to hurry.
I have a plane to catch.

1062
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:07,479
Ah. Leaving things till the last minute, 
huh? A woman after my own heart.

1063
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:10,398
My father always says, "If you didn't do it
at the last minute,

1064
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:11,566
"you didn't do it right. "

1065
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:13,693
That's funny.

1066
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,070
Yeah. He's a funny guy.

1067
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,950
Finally, is there anything
we can do to improve?

1068
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:22,160
No. You've been great.

1069
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:23,620
Well, thank you.

1070
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,080
Okay. So...

1071
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:26,748
Are there any other
questions I can answer

1072
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,375
for you before we
Liquidate your account?

1073
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:31,503
Yes. Can you give me
the account balance?

1074
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:33,880
Not a problem.

1075
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:41,429
Seven-twenty.

1076
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,269
720 million?

1077
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:50,939
Yeah.

1078
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:53,900
You want it all in singles?

1079
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:56,236
Are you gonna buy France?

1080
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:57,862
Oh, my God.

1081
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:01,533
720 million.
Oh, my God.

1082
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,871
You are a card. No, $7.20.

1083
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,254
So did you want that
in a cashier's check?

1084
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:24,931
$7.20. Is that...

1085
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:27,142
Is that not accurate?

1086
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:30,228
I had $7.20 to my name.

1087
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:35,442
Miss Clayton, are you all right?

1088
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:55,920
Psst.

1089
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,843
What are you doing here?
I left.

1090
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,680
I couldn't stay there anymore.

1091
01:18:05,765 --> 01:18:07,182
You made sure of that.

1092
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:10,435
Can we go someplace and talk?

1093
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:13,980
I don't think there's
time for that, Abigail.

1094
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:15,815
I made some phone calls.

1095
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,442
Phone calls?
Yeah.

1096
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:19,778
I called a whole
bunch of people.

1097
01:18:19,862 --> 01:18:22,322
I mean, you've been in
hiding for a long time.

1098
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:24,491
This is your big
coming out party, Abigail.

1099
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:26,284
Why do you keep
calling me Abigail?

1100
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:30,080
That's what you told the man your name was.
Didn't you?

1101
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,374
That's what you wanted to do.

1102
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:35,043
Steal my life, look like me,

1103
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:36,336
steal my money.

1104
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:38,797
Or maybe it's Justine.

1105
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,091
I'm sorry.

1106
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,635
I have so much to tell you.

1107
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,345
Gee, I don't think
we have much time,

1108
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:47,138
so I hope it's
not a long story.

1109
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:48,431
Please.

1110
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:50,725
There's gotta be another way.

1111
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:53,937
You should leave.

1112
01:18:58,609 --> 01:18:59,651
Go.

1113
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:09,327
Oops.

1114
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,372
There's a body in your apartment.

1115
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:15,291
Black dress,
black dress.

1116
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:17,252
Excuse me! Excuse me,
are you Justine Waters?

1117
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:30,807
Go away! No!

1118
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:03,107
Where to?

1119
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:05,527
Kennedy Airport.

1120
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,779
What's all that about?

1121
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,280
They just found that girl,

1122
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:10,907
Justine Waters.

1123
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:12,033
Oh, no kidding.

1124
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:15,078
No bags?

1125
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:16,913
No baggage.

1126
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:19,165
So where you going?

1127
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:23,127
Someplace safe and warm.

1128
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:26,923
Ah. Safe and warm.
I always wanted to go there myself, ma'am.

1129
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:28,967
No, not... Not "ma'am. "

1130
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:31,344
You can...

1131
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:34,722
You can call me Lillian.
