- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Do what...

449
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,540
[Yelling]

450
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,900
Let him go!

451
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,780
- <i>[Man] Better get security.</i>
- Oh, God.

452
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,900
<i>Hey! Hey, Nikita! Where you goin', man?</i>

453
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,060
Hey, what'd you do, man?
Those are friends of mine. You know that?

454
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,380
- Those are friends of mine!
- Back off! Okay?

455
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,260
There's no excuse for the way they act.
None.

456
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,260
- Unbelievable. Where are you goin'? Huh?
- <i>[Elevator Bell Dings]</i>

457
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,580
- You're goin' with him now?
- <i>Yeah. What are you gonna do about it?</i>

458
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,860
- <i>I'm leaving.</i>
- That sounds great. You two have fun.

459
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,740
Fuck it, man. Let's go. Come on.

460
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,260
<i>[Nikita] No, Daddy. Mason's getting</i>
<i>arrogant and out of control.</i>

461
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,780
- And I'm just so sorry that
I wasted all this time with him.
- Nikita...

462
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,540
Daddy, he's in love with his fame, not me!

463
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,420
But he's no different
than any other guy his age.

464
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,140
Men who get too much too fast
always make idiots of themselves.

465
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,660
I wish that Roland would have
knocked him on his ass as well.

466
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,740
<i>What?</i>

467
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,300
Did you just smile?

468
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,620
What?

469
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,580
Yeah. Looks good.

470
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,940
Where's the ex-cop?

471
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,900
- Always the detective.
- Yep. Where is he, Victor?

472
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,940
He's in town.
He needed some medicine from the pharmacy.

473
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:45,020
- You wanna talk to me about the fight at the bar?
- Fight?

474
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,620
People from L.A. What can I say?

475
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,780
<i>Ballistic nylon. Advanced stuff.</i>

476
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,580
He's a smart guy. Knows a lot.

477
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,180
You better watch him.

478
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,780
If he becomes a problem,
you and your boss will pay the price.

479
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,740
I'll let him know.

480
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,780
Yeah, you do that.

481
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,700
<i>[Victor]</i>
<i>Escort him out.</i>

482
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,620
- What, you think I forgot about you?
- I have some questions.

483
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,940
- About the kidnapping attempt.
- Yes, sir.

484
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:39,460
Mr. Wells has a lot of enemies out this way,
most from past business dealings.

485
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:43,340
- Why else would he need you?
- Well, the thing of it is, we're just friends.

486
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,420
And, uh, I feel like
I can help him out a little bit.

487
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,100
You know, with security issues and stuff.
We both were cops together.

488
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,460
- Things like that.
- Well, he's not a cop anymore.

489
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,940
Well, neither am I.
[Chuckles]

490
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,380
Your friend's involved
with some rough people.

491
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,260
- Like Cross.
- Yep.

492
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,660
They've had dealings in the past
when Conner's father ran a business.

493
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,260
- He sees an opportunity.
- Let me ask you something.

494
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,180
What do you know about Cross?

495
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:12,380
He's organized,
and I believe he's a violent separatist.

496
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,860
You know, he believes
whites and Mexicans shouldn't mix.

497
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,780
[Chuckles]
Crazy.

498
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,620
We've been after him for years,
but, hell, nobody will talk to us about him.

499
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:25,100
Listen. You wanna help your friend...

500
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,420
and I want Cross.

501
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,140
I don't know.
Maybe we can help each other here.

502
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,260
Now, you see,
that's what I'm talkin' about.

503
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:37,620
Both cops tryin' to help each other.
Man, let me know what I can do.

504
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,860
- All right.
- All right.

505
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,940
Hey, Nikita. Roland's back.

506
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,180
Is everything okay? You feel safe now?

507
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,140
I do.

508
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,300
- I like him, Daddy.
- You do?

509
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,900
- I do. I like him.
- Good.

510
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,180
He makes me feel safe.

511
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,580
I don't think I've ever felt that safe
with anybody before.

512
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,540
Except for you, Daddy.

513
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,260
But there's something about him though,
you know?

514
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:29,500
He's... He's lonely,
but he won't ever show it.

515
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,300
- Well, I think he's a good man.
- I know.

516
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,420
I never would've
entrusted you to him if I didn't.

517
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,060
I know.

518
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,940
Well, I think
I'll take him shopping tomorrow.

519
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,940
[Laughs]
Good.

520
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,500
Oh, my God. I'm so glad to see
you're back to your old self. Oh!

521
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,340
- After what you've been through, I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

522
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,260
- Well, I gotta get back to some work.
- Okay.

523
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,260
- Okay.
- All right.

524
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,940
Thank you, darling.

525
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,660
Hi.

526
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,380
I'm hungry, and there's nothing to eat.

527
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,780
- Well, I'll give you half of this one.
- You would?

528
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,940
- I will give you half of this one.
- [Chuckles]

529
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,020
Okay. I'm gonna take it.

530
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,860
I miss Jorge.

531
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,380
Well, you know how it is.
It's, like, people become bodyguards...

532
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,300
<i>and they know it's a risk.</i>

533
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,100
<i>Sometimes they have to pay the ultimate price.</i>
<i>And I guess he did.</i>

534
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:47,380
But it seems like
the good news in this instance is that...

535
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,940
you give him the ultimate gratitude.

536
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:57,300
Did you know that, um...
that Manuelo and Jorge were half brothers?

537
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,100
- No.
- No?

538
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,260
He told me once. We kinda kept it quiet...

539
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,020
because there were, like,
two of them living here right now.

540
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,380
And they're from the same city in Mexico,
and they're really close-knit.

541
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,500
They don't really ever tell anybody...

542
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,100
their personal business
if they don't trust them.

543
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,020
It's kinda cool.

544
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,900
Well, I mean, you know,
folks like that, that's the way they are.

545
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:23,380
Every time I close my eyes,
I still see that man...

546
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,020
in the parking structure shooting him.

547
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,740
Well, that's a terrible thing
for a young girl like you to witness.

548
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,340
- It's a lot to bear.
- Yeah.

549
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,660
We thought they were paparazzi,
and that's why Mason made them stop the car.

550
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:41,100
Well, you see, here's the thing.

551
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,140
I'm here now.

552
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,100
So shit's gonna be different.

553
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,020
It's like a nightmare.

554
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,980
- It isn't over, is it?
- It's not over.

555
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,220
But I'm gonna make it over soon.
I promise you that.

556
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,060
Look, I, um...

557
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,100
I'm sorry if I act stupid sometimes.

558
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,140
I just... I just wanted to let you know...

559
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:09,300
that I really appreciate
what you're doing for me.

560
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,260
You're welcome.

561
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,500
Yeah. It was pretty cool
what you did to Mason's friends.

562
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,660
I didn't know people
could fight like that. It was awesome.

563
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,700
- Well, I kinda, you know... I faked it.
- [Chuckling]

564
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,620
You know what you're doing.

565
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,580
I got lucky.

566
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,860
- Do you always eat like that?
- No.

567
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,900
That's what I'm talking about.

568
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,980
Yeah, what was I telling you?

569
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,820
Are you sure we can't have something
with a little more kick?

570
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,620
Crazy, man? We're working, boy.

571
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,940
<i>Why not? You're the bodyguard.</i>

572
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,860
I'm just a driver.

573
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,260
- How about we don't drink on the job?
- <i>Okay. Okay.</i>

574
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,500
- [Spanish]
- <i>I'll just drink the water.</i>

575
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,620
Sí.

576
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,300
- [Retching, Coughing]
- Lord.

577
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,620
- She do this often?
- Every Friday night.

578
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:24,340
- Man.
- And most Saturdays.

579
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,260
Sometimes Tuesdays. And Wednesdays.

580
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,060
That's no good, bubba.

581
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,100
- Are you okay?
- Just take me home, please.

582
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,900
- She okay. She okay.
- <i>[Roland] Baby girl...</i>

583
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,660
what is wrong with you?

584
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,380
[Sighs] Mason stayed at the club
with his friends...

585
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,380
and he won't answer his phone.

586
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,860
Well, you know what?

587
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:52,420
- I'm sure he'll call you soon.
- Yeah. He will.

588
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,140
There's... There's something you...

589
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,820
There's something you gave me
as a little girl.

590
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,180
- Baby, you're still little.
- [Chuckles]

591
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:07,100
- What's that?
- It was an ornate umbrella from Siam.

592
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,500
It's really, really beautiful, and...

593
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:14,260
it was handmade
and painted really distinctly.

594
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,180
I can't believe you remember that.

595
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,140
And you said you got it
in Northern Thailand.

596
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,860
And then you told me all these cool stories
about how they were made.

597
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,780
It was really awesome.

598
