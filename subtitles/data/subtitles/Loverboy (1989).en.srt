00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,961
That's good.

3
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:30,115
Jenny?

4
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,619
Jenny's gonna come any second!

5
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:41,091
Hey, how you doing?

6
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:48,364
Yeah, I was gonna spend the night
alone with Jenny tonight.

7
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,198
Pussy whipped!

8
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,771
All right, maybe one beer.
That's it.

9
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,309
The party's on!

10
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:04,516
You know, hey, I cleaned earlier.
Yeah, thank you.

11
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,880
Jenny.

12
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,785
Some of the guys dropped by.

13
00:04:41,923 --> 00:04:43,515
Hug me?

14
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:44,952
Will you?

15
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,326
Party's over.

16
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:07,913
What's the matter, no-dick?
Jen throw you out?

17
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,150
No.

18
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,483
Yeah, well, tell her I'm available,
huh?

19
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:18,892
- Why don't you go home, Jory.
- You wanna make me?

20
00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:20,489
Hey, God...

21
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:23,120
Goddamn shit!

22
00:05:23,764 --> 00:05:25,595
Come on, Jenny, open up.

23
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:29,625
Come on, Jen, my dad's coming.
Look, at least let me get my stuff.

24
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:32,800
- You're kept.
- I'm what?

25
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,173
You cleaned?

26
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:39,541
Look, Jenny, I know it's
hard to explain, but-

27
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,182
Seems simple. It's our last night
before break.

28
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,784
You'd rather be barfing
with your beer buddies.

29
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:48,215
- I get the hint, Randy.
- No, I wasn't- Okay, you're pissed?

30
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:50,887
No, I'm not. I am not.

31
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:52,719
You know, I should thank you.

32
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,761
You finally made it very clear to me
where I stand.

33
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,792
Jenny.

34
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:01,796
I don't want to break up with you.
Look, I got you a present.

35
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:07,135
I know the wrapping's a little primitive,
but it's nice. Go ahead, open it.

36
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,638
I'll open it, I'll help.

37
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,941
Okay. There.
What do you think?

38
00:06:14,148 --> 00:06:17,982
- A football jersey?
- Yeah. Looks great, doesn't it?

39
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:23,184
Jenny, I wanted to be
with you last night.

40
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:25,825
The guys, they just pushed
their way in, and-

41
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:28,257
Then why didn't you stand up
for yourself?

42
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,961
And why don't you ever
stand up for me?

43
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:32,827
- Well, I do.
- Yeah?

44
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,567
- Yeah.
- Like you do with your parents?

45
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:38,972
- What?
- You hide me from your parents.

46
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,904
You told them
your roommate's name was Vic.

47
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:45,307
- Randy, you did.
- Jenny, look.

48
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:47,674
My dad's gonna be pissed
with my grades.

49
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:50,612
It's not good to tell him
I'm living with a girl.

50
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,887
So I'm just supposed to be
your secret little boy-toy?

51
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:56,285
You're not my boy-toy.
I'm gonna tell them.

52
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:59,587
- When?
- As soon as I see them.

53
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:03,595
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

54
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:05,893
Really?

55
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:08,501
Really.

56
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:27,679
Son, sorry I'm late, but the traffic
was hell out there.

57
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:29,550
You ready to go?
It's good to...

58
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:31,787
- Dad. Dad!
- ... see you.

59
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,951
Good to see you. You look great.
How you been?

60
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:38,962
Oh, excuse me. I'm Randy's dad.
Nice to meet you.

61
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:41,124
So? What's going on?

62
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:43,628
- So where's Vic?
- Vic...

63
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:46,130
- Your roommate-
- You missed him.

64
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:49,140
His dad was here.
No, you missed him.

65
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:53,012
- Nice meeting you.
- I'll call you, Jenny.

66
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:55,472
Well, hey. Okay.

67
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,145
- Yeah.
- Who was that?

68
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,311
What? Oh, she's my bio tutor.

69
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,283
She thought she left a book here.

70
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:09,591
- Maybe I better give you a hand.
- No, no, that's not- Okay, yeah.

71
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:17,029
Your mom would've come,
but she had a final today.

72
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:18,728
Final? Final for what?

73
00:08:19,273 --> 00:08:21,901
She's taking a
landscape-architecture class.

74
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:25,010
- She's doing real well too.
- That's good, Dad.

75
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:28,146
Hey, you got a problem?

76
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:30,746
No, bad latch, Dad.
Bad latch.

77
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:32,749
- So how'd you do?
- Do?

78
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:38,056
- Grades, son. How were the grades?
- Oh, well, Dad. That's kind of a...

79
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:39,749
...subjective thing.

80
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:43,923
Subjective, huh?

81
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:48,232
F in geometry. Now, what the hell's
so subjective about that?

82
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,803
See, everybody flunks that
the first time, Dad.

83
00:08:53,441 --> 00:08:55,409
And this D here,
what's that for?

84
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,635
That teacher hates my guts, Dad.

85
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,442
And these "Incs"?

86
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:02,480
What are these "Incs"?

87
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:06,846
"Incomplete." It's cool.
I can make it up.

88
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:13,682
Look, Dad, I tried to study.
I really did, but things came up.

89
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,196
I'm sorry about school.
I won't do it again.

90
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:19,855
Damn right, you won't.
I'm not sending you back.

91
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:21,433
And no more free ride!

92
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,628
Joe, we agreed for him to have
opportunities we never had.

93
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:26,932
The first Bodek to graduate
from college.

94
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,269
People who look like that
don't graduate.

95
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:33,345
I don't think I'm out of line. He's
been in school, what, two years?

96
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:36,142
He does not have a clue
what he's doing there!

97
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:39,809
- He can't declare a, what's it called?
- Major.

98
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:41,614
Major, right. I'll be damned...

99
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:46,317
...if I'll keep throwing good money after
bad money while he's looking like this.

100
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:48,619
Oh, that's great!

101
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:51,955
- Don't think this changes a thing!
- Don't send me back.

102
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,034
Well, I mean, look.

103
00:09:57,304 --> 00:09:59,135
I mean, you're right.

104
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,773
Okay?

105
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:06,343
I don't know what I'm doing in school.
So I don't go back.

106
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:11,010
Well, I'll start my real life.

107
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:13,219
How bad could it be?

108
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:16,120
Yeah, what kind of cheese
you want on that?

109
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:19,121
- Extra gooey.
- No, extra tangy.

110
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,690
- Tangy...
- Gooey.

111
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,926
Right.

112
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:26,496
That's...

113
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:28,498
...22.

114
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,129
I gotta get back to school.

115
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:35,366
It's a summer job.
What'd you expect?

116
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:37,170
It's a summer job for you.

117
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,411
This is life for me.

118
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:44,209
$4.80 an hour. You know, people here
from Mexico make more than that.

119
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:47,013
Yeah. Well, we pay Juan $5.10.

120
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:49,086
He's got more experience.

121
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:52,752
I gotta get some training in something.

122
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:56,260
I wanna work triple shifts. I need
to make 9 grand by September.

123
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,228
Oh, 9 grand? Okay, let's see.
$4.80 an hour.

124
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,097
Sixteen-hour days, two and a half
months, no spending money.

125
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,932
We're looking at about
half of what you need.

126
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,742
I think you just better start enjoying
the one perk we got here.

127
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,137
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

128
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,608
Can I help you?

129
00:11:15,816 --> 00:11:17,147
Oh, we're thinking.

130
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:23,817
- We'd like a large Italian.
- What?

131
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,785
- A large vegetarian.
- Okay.

132
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:29,862
- And...
- And two Diet Cokes, no ice.

133
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,123
Two Diet- No ice.

134
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,897
Here's your number, number 16.
We'll be with you in a moment.

135
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,935
Tell me, tell me.
Who is that guy?

136
00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:44,770
He's an exchange student from Italy.

137
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:46,810
- Really?
- Oh, really.

138
00:11:47,147 --> 00:11:50,207
Man, I can't believe they go for
that Pepé Le Pew shit.

139
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:52,577
So cute.

140
00:11:53,854 --> 00:11:55,378
Think he's taken?

141
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:03,720
- Hey, man, that shit works for you.
- No.

142
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:05,759
- Yeah.
- No, I'm not interested.

143
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,992
- Oh, come on. Yes!
- No. No!

144
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:12,662
Jenny is 150 miles away. She won't
even return your calls. Give it up.

145
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,671
Look alive out here, will you?

146
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:18,005
- Say you love delivery, right here.
- Caught a bad pepperoni.

147
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:19,543
Such a wise guy.

148
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:24,875
Okay, Bodek. You're up.
Take off.

149
00:13:42,496 --> 00:13:43,895
Hi.

150
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:46,929
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Randy.

151
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:50,064
- Robin.
- Hi.

152
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:51,465
What can I do for you?

153
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:54,039
I was wondering...

154
00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:59,269
- You wanna go out with me sometime?
- What?

155
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,004
Well, you know, outside.

156
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:03,139
I was in the van.

157
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,242
I smiled.

158
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,887
You smiled.

159
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:11,455
Wait a minute.
The guy in the van had a mustache.

160
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:13,153
Right.

161
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:16,256
What happened, I...

162
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,258
See, I wear this for my job.

163
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,228
Oh, my God.

164
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:24,136
You're just a boy.

165
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,807
I'm sorry. I don't date boys.

166
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:49,229
For what it's worth, I think
she made a big mistake.

167
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:55,368
Took a lot of nerve to go up to
a complete stranger and ask her out.

168
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,995
I admire that.

169
00:14:58,338 --> 00:14:59,828
Thanks.

170
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:03,007
I have to go kill myself now.
Excuse me.

171
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:05,270
Don't take it so personally.

172
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:08,515
Some women just have
limited perspective, that's all.

173
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:10,980
She didn't even give me
a chance to talk.

174
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:13,517
It was like I was younger,
so forget it.

175
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,415
- Well, I know that was unfair.
- Yeah.

176
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,617
You know, I've never met a man who
shied away from 20-year-old girls.

177
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:25,197
I don't see the difference, a few years.
It's no big deal.

178
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:28,065
She's just kind of bitchy, that's all.

179
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:29,701
Do you like clothes?

180
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,502
Yes, yeah.

181
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:36,098
Here.

182
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,570
Oh, excuse me. It's okay.

183
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:42,647
- Did that hurt?
- No, I'm hardheaded.

184
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,546
Oh, dear. Here. Now, wait, look.

185
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:48,847
These pads are very important
in this jacket.

186
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:50,455
- All right.
- You see?

187
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:52,023
- Yeah.
- Now.

188
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:53,687
Yeah.

189
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:55,192
There we are.

190
00:15:55,596 --> 00:15:57,086
Now.

191
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,034
Okay, hold on.

192
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:17,082
- Oh, that looks wonderful.
- Think so? No, that's it.

193
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,410
- Think that's okay?
- I think like this.

194
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:23,283
- Oh, like that?
- There, you see? It should be like that.

195
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:28,557
Oh, you look wonderful. Good enough
to go and have some cappuccino.

196
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:32,028
- Cappuccino?
- Would you like some cappuccino?

197
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,191
Me?

198
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:36,696
Don't worry, I'm not gonna bite you.

199
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,770
Not over coffee anyway.

200
00:16:39,006 --> 00:16:41,372
Are you-? Are you sure?

201
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:44,372
Okay. Yeah, okay.

202
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:47,770
Oh, shit! I'm in a red zone.

203
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,384
Look, I really- See, I wanna-
Look, I gotta get back to work.

204
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,217
See, I'm the only driver right now.
Well, thanks. Will I-?

205
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,788
Will you-? Okay, bye.
Nice meeting you.

206
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:02,026
Bye.

207
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:05,427
Hey, look, look. I'll move it.
I'll move it.

208
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,366
Look. I got- Look. See,
I got a delivery. Come on.

209
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:15,130
I had a letter to Penthouse staring me
right in the face, and I let it go.

210
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:17,777
I mean, this was an incredibly
gorgeous woman.

211
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:22,109
Not a girl, Sal, a woman.
A Chanel No. 5 woman-

212
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:23,510
- Bodek!
- Yes.

213
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:26,482
Got a delivery for Beverly Hills,
and the rest go...

214
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:28,553
...to a stag party in Costa Mesa.

215
00:17:28,722 --> 00:17:32,783
- Extra anchovies?
- Costa Mesa? Why from here?

216
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,258
All I know is they did,
so move your tail.

217
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,329
I'm here to serve!

218
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:57,642
Any luggage, sir?

219
00:17:58,185 --> 00:17:59,482
No, pizza.

220
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:02,281
- Pizza.
- What's this?

221
00:18:08,662 --> 00:18:10,254
Excuse me.

222
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,378
Oh, excuse me.

223
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:44,991
Señor Pizza.

224
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:51,729
Come in.

225
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:57,766
Can you put it on the table, please?

226
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:02,681
Hi.

227
00:19:03,884 --> 00:19:05,351
Hi.

228
00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:09,754
I hope you didn't leave your car
in the red zone.

229
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,923
No.

230
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,794
- Please sit down.
- Yes, definitely.

231
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:19,288
Oh, except, see, I got this
big delivery to make.

232
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:23,535
In Costa Mesa?

233
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,749
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.

234
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:45,221
I'm at a friend's house, and I'm gonna
spend the night, okay?

235
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,792
What? Whose?

236
00:19:48,662 --> 00:19:51,130
Just a guy from work, Dad.

237
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:56,531
- What was that?
- What?

238
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:58,432
- What was that?
- Nothing.

239
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:00,239
- Randy?
- Yeah.

240
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,168
Dad, look, I'll see you
in the morning, okay?

241
00:20:03,343 --> 00:20:04,674
Yeah, sure, son.

242
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:16,088
Randy's spending the night
at a friend's house.

243
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,284
Well, he's not gonna come here.
He's miserable here.

244
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:26,291
Diane, it's been over two weeks.
How long are you gonna keep this up?

245
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:30,266
Joe, I don't know why you won't give
him one more chance at school.

246
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:33,633
He's had all the chances
he's gonna get.

247
00:20:34,374 --> 00:20:38,105
I think he's really sorry.
Doesn't look like he's slept in days.

248
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,071
So, Alex...?

249
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:43,075
Yes, Randy?

250
00:20:43,383 --> 00:20:45,010
You work at Avedon?

251
00:20:45,485 --> 00:20:48,420
I own Avedon, darling.

252
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:52,923
- Actually, I own all 11 stores.
- Wow.

253
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,992
Does that bother you?

254
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:58,187
No, not at all.

255
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:04,095
I'm glad, because it bothers
some people.

256
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:05,499
Oh, like who?

257
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:10,106
Some men find it very wilting.

258
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:12,644
Not me.

259
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:16,974
Can I ask you something?

260
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:21,954
Now, you could just snap your fingers
and get any guy you wanted.

261
00:21:22,122 --> 00:21:25,387
I mean, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

262
00:21:25,592 --> 00:21:27,583
I mean, you're just so...

263
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:34,690
I came into town for a few days,
and when I saw you in the store...

264
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:39,536
...I just thought you would be open.

265
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,735
Open?

266
00:21:41,908 --> 00:21:44,638
Yes, I felt you knew
how to enjoy yourself.

267
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,728
- Seven times?
- Yeah.

268
00:22:09,636 --> 00:22:12,196
Man, that is like wild boars
or something.

269
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,500
Well... I mean,
that wasn't all we did.

270
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:17,341
We talked about stuff.

271
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,274
Yeah, right. I mean,
I don't believe this.

272
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:24,144
I mean, I come on to every girl
that walks, and they throw up.

273
00:22:24,317 --> 00:22:26,114
You do absolutely nothing...

274
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:29,221
...and you get Miss "Take Me
From Behind on a Trapeze."

275
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,721
Oh, no, no, no.
It was nothing like that.

276
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,794
Oh, yeah, right. So you think you're
gonna hear from her again?

277
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:40,092
Yeah.

278
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:53,145
- Hi, what can I do for you?
- I come to see Randy.

279
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:55,070
Randy. Really?

280
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,242
Somebody here to see you, son.

281
00:22:58,785 --> 00:23:01,845
- Thanks. Yeah, what's up?
- It's...

282
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,259
Excuse me.

283
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:12,289
These are beautiful, no?
It make you look very handsome.

284
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:14,296
This is for me?

285
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:17,459
It came to you at work,
so I bring it myself here.

286
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,566
Is that the fourth one
this week, Tony?

287
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:24,805
These American women, so
cheap and easy. All they say is:

288
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:26,809
"Yes, Tony. Yes, Tony."

289
00:23:27,314 --> 00:23:29,976
You would rather have them say no?

290
00:23:30,183 --> 00:23:31,946
This I would respect.

291
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,349
Well, thanks a lot.

292
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:41,985
So...

293
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:43,423
...who was that?

294
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,192
Guy I work with.

295
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:47,663
- The guy you were with last night?
- Yeah.

296
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:49,096
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

297
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:51,564
What's the story with the coat here?

298
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:55,333
Oh, he outgrew it
and thought I might like it.

299
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:57,339
Looks brand-new to me.

300
00:23:57,677 --> 00:24:00,874
Well, see, what happened was...

301
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,608
What happened was that
he bought it on sale...

302
00:24:04,784 --> 00:24:07,014
...and it was the wrong size.

303
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:08,953
Oh, I'll get it.

304
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:10,847
You dropped a...

305
00:24:14,194 --> 00:24:15,661
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

306
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,626
- Sal, what's up?
- Listen.

307
00:24:17,797 --> 00:24:19,321
I just took a delivery order.

308
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:23,458
Some woman asked for a large
Pizza Loco with extra anchovies...

309
00:24:23,636 --> 00:24:26,036
- ... and she wanted you personally.
- No!

310
00:24:26,206 --> 00:24:27,673
You're kidding.

311
00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:29,603
"Dear Randy...

312
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:33,902
...of course, I prefer you naked...

313
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,808
...but if you must wear something,
it should be the best.

314
00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:41,076
Love...

315
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,582
...Alex."

316
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:44,813
- Diane?
- Yeah.

317
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:50,220
- Yeah.
- Diane...

318
00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:51,830
...our son...

319
00:24:52,065 --> 00:24:53,362
...is a fruit!

320
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,761
Yeah?

321
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:57,425
All right, I'll be right there.
Thanks a lot.

322
00:24:58,471 --> 00:25:00,598
Mom! They need me at work.

323
00:25:00,774 --> 00:25:03,174
Oh, I thought you had
the afternoon off!

324
00:25:04,511 --> 00:25:07,002
- What's this?
- A guy shows up at the door...

325
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,978
...wearing enough cologne
to make me puke.

326
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,217
He gives our son a coat that
must cost 500 bucks-

327
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,321
No, no, wait, don't-
Joe, don't jump to conclusions.

328
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:18,548
See, the other driver called in sick.

329
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,193
And they're already swamped
with deliveries.

330
00:25:21,361 --> 00:25:23,829
- Don't hold dinner, I might be late.
- Okay.

331
00:25:23,997 --> 00:25:25,396
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

332
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:32,738
He never brings girls home
to meet us.

333
00:25:33,673 --> 00:25:37,370
He never even talks
about girls anymore.

334
00:25:38,144 --> 00:25:41,807
- You think it happens to the other guy.
- Joe. Joe.

335
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,318
I could get used to this.

336
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:53,282
Oh, shit. Sorry.

337
00:25:53,626 --> 00:25:55,457
- That's all right.
- Okay.

338
00:25:57,897 --> 00:26:01,025
What I could do with you in Rome
in two months, Randy.

339
00:26:03,636 --> 00:26:05,331
What's wrong, darling?

340
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:07,967
I think you should
know that-

341
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:12,043
Alex, I love being with you
and everything. It's just...

342
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,011
...I don't love you.

343
00:26:14,547 --> 00:26:17,380
- You don't?
- No. See, I've got this girl, Jenny.

344
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,347
- Yeah?
- Back at school.

345
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,249
And we sort of broke up
and everything.

346
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:24,286
But see, I'm gonna...

347
00:26:24,491 --> 00:26:27,619
- But I think I'm gonna-
- Randy?

348
00:26:27,894 --> 00:26:29,623
It's okay.

349
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:32,163
I think I can handle it.

350
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:37,169
Thanks, Alex.

351
00:26:51,684 --> 00:26:53,549
What's this?

352
00:26:54,587 --> 00:26:57,784
That's the Randy Bodek
Scholarship Fund.

353
00:26:58,091 --> 00:27:01,254
Oh, no. Alex.

354
00:27:02,095 --> 00:27:03,585
- I can't.
- Why not?

355
00:27:03,763 --> 00:27:06,288
Because it makes me feel...

356
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,989
Randy.

357
00:27:09,135 --> 00:27:11,968
If I was the one who needed money...

358
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:14,806
...and you had it to give...

359
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:17,941
- ... would you give it to me?
- Yes.

360
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:20,179
Of course you would.

361
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:23,077
So, what's the difference?

362
00:27:36,663 --> 00:27:39,029
I'm never gonna see you again,
am I?

363
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:43,267
Be on the lookout for extra anchovies.

364
00:28:01,487 --> 00:28:03,079
Randy?

365
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:15,261
Joe.

366
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:17,528
Jumping to conclusions,
am I, Diane?

367
00:28:17,704 --> 00:28:20,400
How dare you sneak home
in the middle of the day...

368
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,041
- ... to invade your son's privacy.
- His privacy?

369
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:26,508
- His sex life is his own business-
- Come on, Diane.

370
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:29,239
Our son is dressing up
in ladies' underwear.

371
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:32,145
- He needs professional help.
- No, he needs...

372
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:34,752
...sympathetic parents who say
they love him.

373
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,481
Let's see your sympathy when
he borrows makeup.

374
00:28:37,657 --> 00:28:39,420
- Oh, Joe.
- "Oh, Joe."

375
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,184
Oh, God.

376
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:45,123
Okay. Take the moon.

377
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:46,856
It's a chunk of rock.

378
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:49,092
Why does it spin around the Earth?

379
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,703
Why doesn't it just bolt off into space?

380
00:28:52,138 --> 00:28:56,199
Smartest scientists don't understand
a billionth of what's going on.

381
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:59,470
Why should I feel stupid
because I don't understand women?

382
00:28:59,646 --> 00:29:01,841
You get all that from
a cold pizza, man?

383
00:29:02,015 --> 00:29:07,112
- You're in worse shape than I thought.
- I'm serious. So I've saved 270 bucks?

384
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,288
I'm never gonna get Jenny back.

385
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:13,221
- See, I don't know what to do.
- I do. Move your butt.

386
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:16,625
Says "extra anchovies."
Who called it in?

387
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:20,095
- What do you mean, who? Some lady.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

388
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:21,494
- Hold it.
- What?

389
00:29:21,668 --> 00:29:24,193
Where's your mustache?
I want mustaches worn.

390
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,895
- Sal said I didn't have to wear it.
- Sal.

391
00:29:27,073 --> 00:29:29,200
Mustaches, mustaches.

392
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,366
You're bumming me out, man.

393
00:29:31,911 --> 00:29:33,139
Señor Pizza.

394
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,690
Alex?

395
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:14,219
- Hello.
- Hi.

396
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,914
I'm a friend of Alexandra.

397
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,625
It's okay.

398
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,292
What?

399
00:30:29,502 --> 00:30:30,901
Oh, no.

400
00:30:31,537 --> 00:30:33,562
I- No.

401
00:30:46,085 --> 00:30:49,179
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

402
00:30:50,456 --> 00:30:52,014
It's nothing personal.

403
00:30:52,325 --> 00:30:55,988
- I want to die!
- Now, come on. Don't talk like that.

404
00:30:56,162 --> 00:30:59,154
Look, it's just been one giant mistake.

405
00:30:59,332 --> 00:31:02,699
Yes, my marriage.
Fourteen years of a big mistake.

406
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:06,566
Hey, come on. It can't be that bad.
I mean, look at this house.

407
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,138
What? It's great.

408
00:31:08,374 --> 00:31:10,137
It's a prison.

409
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:12,072
Okay, why don't you
sit down here.

410
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,907
You know, I hope everything
works out.

411
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:17,916
No. No. No!

412
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:23,283
When I was younger in Japan,
I had many boyfriends.

413
00:31:23,456 --> 00:31:27,324
Many proposals of marriage. But no,
I wanted to marry American.

414
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:31,154
Be American woman with
American freedom and opportunity.

415
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,356
But my husband, he treats me
like a geisha.

416
00:31:34,534 --> 00:31:36,126
Well, I'm not a geisha!

417
00:31:38,237 --> 00:31:40,535
I'm a computer analyst!

418
00:31:40,706 --> 00:31:43,004
Look, I'm sorry,
but I gotta get going here.

419
00:31:43,176 --> 00:31:45,007
He treats me like his slave.

420
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,644
And now...

421
00:31:47,814 --> 00:31:51,944
...when I finally get the courage
to do something for myself...

422
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,981
...even you, professional,
you refuse me.

423
00:31:55,154 --> 00:31:57,782
- No, see, I'm not a professional.
- I want to die.

424
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,424
Stop it.

425
00:32:01,327 --> 00:32:03,727
- No, no, no, no. Not like that.
- What?

426
00:32:03,896 --> 00:32:07,093
- That's my husband's way.
- I'm sorry, I thought that-

427
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:11,503
I have a fantasy.

428
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,237
Take me.

429
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,016
Take me.

430
00:32:34,794 --> 00:32:36,989
- Take me!
- Yes, okay.

431
00:32:54,313 --> 00:32:56,406
Okay. It's all right.

432
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,797
Yes, ma'am. Absolutely.
And thank you very much.

433
00:33:18,905 --> 00:33:24,241
Hey, Bodek, you are really quite
the popular guy, aren't you?

434
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:28,244
Look at this. Look at this.
You got a bunch of deliveries here.

435
00:33:28,414 --> 00:33:33,647
Hey, Juan! Break me out one of those
big cans of anchovies, will you?

436
00:33:36,656 --> 00:33:37,884
Oh, my goodness.

437
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,424
- What the hell is going on?
- That last delivery wasn't Alex.

438
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:45,997
I figured so. You got five more calls,
all women, all extra anchovies.

439
00:33:46,165 --> 00:33:49,862
Four of them scheduled deliveries
for later this week!

440
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:59,375
I just couldn't say no.
Alex? She just insisted.

441
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:02,446
And then Kyoko.
Kyoko, it was like...

442
00:34:02,615 --> 00:34:05,413
...I was defending the American way.

443
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,519
It's taking me a second to get this.

444
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:11,123
Beautiful women actually pay you
$200 apiece to sleep with them?

445
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,588
Yeah! I didn't want
to take their money.

446
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:16,853
They were nice people.
They wouldn't take no for an answer.

447
00:34:17,029 --> 00:34:19,054
Okay, well, what about the others?

448
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:21,927
Call them back and say
there are no more anchovies.

449
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,628
I can't! They didn't leave names
or numbers, only addresses.

450
00:34:25,805 --> 00:34:27,966
Three of them are motels
in the Valley.

451
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,574
I cannot believe Alex
would do this to me.

452
00:34:30,743 --> 00:34:34,577
Who knows? Right now your name
and number could be on every wall...

453
00:34:34,747 --> 00:34:37,841
...of every ladies' room
from Chinoise to Le Dôme, man.

454
00:34:38,684 --> 00:34:41,414
You could be the love doctor
of Beverly Hills!

455
00:34:42,088 --> 00:34:44,784
I don't wanna be the love doctor
of Beverly Hills!

456
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,517
- You're going.
- I am not going.

457
00:34:48,361 --> 00:34:49,828
No.

458
00:34:51,497 --> 00:34:55,797
What do you think, Joe?
Portable home-security systems.

459
00:34:55,968 --> 00:35:00,234
I pick them up in Tokyo for a buck
and a quarter, sell them here for $40.

460
00:35:00,406 --> 00:35:02,237
Ain't that something?

461
00:35:02,842 --> 00:35:05,174
It's great. It's really great.

462
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:10,338
I got 20,000 of these waiting to go into
the warehouse as soon as you build it.

463
00:35:10,516 --> 00:35:12,746
- Right. Right.
- Excuse me, Mr. Bodek.

464
00:35:12,918 --> 00:35:15,148
- Yes, Linda?
- Mr. Rubelinski's calling.

465
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,380
Tell him I'll call him back.

466
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:21,219
Excuse me. Do you mind if I spend
the night in your trailer tonight?

467
00:35:21,394 --> 00:35:24,295
They're painting my apartment,
and the fumes are-

468
00:35:24,697 --> 00:35:26,130
No problem.

469
00:35:26,899 --> 00:35:30,335
Look, Linda, you sure
you'll be safe down here?

470
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,994
Yeah. I can take care of myself.

471
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:38,008
Hey, that's not bad. Porking her?

472
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:42,509
I'm a happily married man, Harry.

473
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,374
At least, I used to be.

474
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:49,112
Does this kid look like a fruit to you?

475
00:35:50,723 --> 00:35:53,283
You can't tell these days.

476
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,320
I think I'm entitled to be
a little concerned here.

477
00:35:57,496 --> 00:36:00,226
I've tried to talk to the wife.
She won't listen.

478
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:04,927
Shit. You never get treated
that way with an Oriental woman.

479
00:36:05,104 --> 00:36:07,129
Great sex.

480
00:36:07,306 --> 00:36:08,637
No lip.

481
00:36:08,808 --> 00:36:10,207
I'm married to one.

482
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,139
- Yeah?
- Damn right.

483
00:36:12,611 --> 00:36:16,274
I heard this story once
from this guy back in New York.

484
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:20,180
This guy was late for work,
and he sees his bus leaving the stop.

485
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,786
His Oriental wife runs
into the street...

486
00:36:22,955 --> 00:36:26,288
...jumps right in front of it
and stops it for him.

487
00:36:27,526 --> 00:36:31,087
That's what marriage is all about,
you ask me.

488
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,726
What happened to the wife?

489
00:36:38,003 --> 00:36:39,231
What?

490
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,533
The wife.
When she jumped in front of the bus.

491
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:48,139
You're never gonna get it, are you?

492
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:58,917
I want another chance.
My life is a mess without you.

493
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,854
Yeah, I know.

494
00:37:01,193 --> 00:37:03,525
I'm not ashamed of you.

495
00:37:04,063 --> 00:37:05,860
I'm proud.

496
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:08,300
I'm gonna tell my parents about you.

497
00:37:08,467 --> 00:37:13,530
I want them to meet you. Their 20th
anniversary is at the end of the month.

498
00:37:13,706 --> 00:37:15,640
And what about your father?

499
00:37:15,808 --> 00:37:20,268
I don't care what my father thinks.
I know my mom's gonna love you.

500
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:27,382
Look, just don't say no
until you think about it.

501
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:02,084
Oh, no.

502
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,582
Mr. Bodek.

503
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,752
Mr. Bodek?

504
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:17,124
Mr. Bodek, you can't stay here.
You've gotta go.

505
00:38:17,303 --> 00:38:18,793
Oh, God.

506
00:38:19,638 --> 00:38:21,606
Please? Please wake up.

507
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,075
Mom?

508
00:38:27,112 --> 00:38:29,876
What are you doing up?
Where's Dad?

509
00:38:30,049 --> 00:38:33,849
- I don't know. We had a fight.
- About me?

510
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:35,884
Mom, I'm sorry.

511
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,793
Don't worry.

512
00:38:42,962 --> 00:38:46,625
You know, I bet he just crashed out
on the sofa bed at the office.

513
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,928
Yeah, you're probably right.

514
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:57,406
- Good night.
- Okay, good night.

515
00:39:05,484 --> 00:39:07,349
Oh, Diane...

516
00:39:10,623 --> 00:39:12,420
- Linda!
- Mr. Bodek?

517
00:39:12,591 --> 00:39:13,922
What are you doing here?

518
00:39:14,093 --> 00:39:16,527
I told you they're painting
my place, remember?

519
00:39:16,695 --> 00:39:21,655
- No! Oh, my head. It's killing-
- I'm sorry.

520
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:25,793
- Linda, we didn't, you know-?
- No, you came in here.

521
00:39:25,971 --> 00:39:28,462
- I couldn't even move you.
- Thank God!

522
00:39:28,807 --> 00:39:32,470
Listen, nobody will believe
that we just slept here.

523
00:39:32,645 --> 00:39:34,806
- Yeah, no-
- No, it's okay.

524
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,345
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

525
00:39:36,515 --> 00:39:39,245
There's nobody here yet.
We're safe. We're safe.

526
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,819
We're safe as long as we don't
ever let anybody know about this.

527
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:44,319
- I won't.
- Ever. Okay?

528
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,550
- Okay, I won't say a word. I promise.
- Okay.

529
00:39:47,793 --> 00:39:49,761
- No! Don't!
- Mr. Bodek's office.

530
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:52,188
Linda?

531
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:55,391
It's your wife!

532
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,204
Hey, Bodek!

533
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:07,269
Look who's here.

534
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:10,240
Goofing off on the job, huh?

535
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:15,242
- What do you want, Jory?
- I wanna give you my order, Rander.

536
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:21,859
I'll have a Taco Macho.

537
00:40:22,895 --> 00:40:25,955
Extra lettuce. Extra cheese.

538
00:40:26,131 --> 00:40:27,962
A large Coke.

539
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:30,499
And Jenny's phone number.

540
00:40:31,337 --> 00:40:35,034
You'll never get back to school.
I might as well get a hop on it.

541
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:39,576
- Listen, asshole, stay away from her.
- Go ahead, no-dick. Take a shot.

542
00:40:39,745 --> 00:40:42,976
Come on, mellow out.
Take a number and sit down.

543
00:40:43,148 --> 00:40:45,616
- You just lost your tip.
- Geek.

544
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:52,980
Let's see, 9000 plus the 400
you just made, divided by 200...

545
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:57,094
- What are you doing?
- Let's see, that's only 43 women.

546
00:41:39,304 --> 00:41:42,569
- Señor Pizza.
- It's about time.

547
00:41:50,983 --> 00:41:52,450
Sorry.

548
00:41:53,252 --> 00:41:54,776
Put it down.

549
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,216
Not on the plant.

550
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,729
So?

551
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,157
So...

552
00:42:15,307 --> 00:42:17,935
You want me to fix you a drink
or something?

553
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:21,375
If I wanted a drink,
I would have hired a bartender.

554
00:42:21,547 --> 00:42:23,674
- Could you help me with this?
- Sure.

555
00:42:31,156 --> 00:42:32,680
- Shit.
- What's the matter?

556
00:42:32,858 --> 00:42:34,155
Hang on.

557
00:42:37,463 --> 00:42:40,193
Don't move.
My lip is caught in the zipper.

558
00:42:40,365 --> 00:42:43,266
- What?
- My lip is caught in the zipper.

559
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,494
I don't believe this.

560
00:42:46,905 --> 00:42:51,842
Good God! What kind
of a professional lover are you?

561
00:42:54,713 --> 00:42:57,375
Just- Just take your clothes off.

562
00:43:42,928 --> 00:43:46,364
- Are you crazy? People can see!
- Fine. I want them to.

563
00:43:46,532 --> 00:43:50,298
Look, if something's bothering you,
maybe this isn't the best time.

564
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:54,633
If something's bothering me?
Of course something's bothering me!

565
00:43:54,806 --> 00:43:56,671
- Do you know what this is?
- Looks-

566
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,833
Wrong! It's my husband's beeper.

567
00:43:59,077 --> 00:44:02,604
Have you heard of him?
Dr. Reed Palmer?

568
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:07,741
I thought the son of a bitch was a saint
with all his late-night emergency calls.

569
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,857
I found out he's been screwing some
nympho RN on the graveyard shift!

570
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:17,452
Hey, hey, come on. Calm down.

571
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,697
You know, two can play at this game.

572
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,563
- You wait till I tell my husband.
- Your husband?

573
00:44:24,736 --> 00:44:26,567
- Come on.
- You can't do it.

574
00:44:45,857 --> 00:44:47,085
Oh, God.

575
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:52,527
- Is this okay?
- Oh, good. It's really good.

576
00:44:52,698 --> 00:44:55,826
- Oh, it feels weird.
- Doesn't feel weird to me.

577
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:58,868
- You sure?
- You're great at this.

578
00:44:59,037 --> 00:45:00,436
Thanks.

579
00:45:02,674 --> 00:45:04,266
- Joyce?
- Yes?

580
00:45:04,443 --> 00:45:07,606
Now, how did you get my number?

581
00:45:07,779 --> 00:45:11,180
- Oh, at my salon, why?
- Your sal-?

582
00:45:13,552 --> 00:45:14,917
I'm sorry.

583
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,920
It's all right.
I'm a little rusty myself.

584
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:24,461
- You really like dancing to this stuff?
- Yeah, sure. A lot of women do.

585
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:29,364
You know, if you learned, I bet
your clients would really appreciate it.

586
00:45:29,534 --> 00:45:32,332
You know, Reed hasn't
taken me dancing-

587
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:35,235
Since we were in med school.

588
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:39,210
I know this is probably
against your professional code...

589
00:45:39,378 --> 00:45:41,278
...but can I ask
a personal question?

590
00:45:41,446 --> 00:45:42,674
Sure.

591
00:45:42,848 --> 00:45:45,840
It's just that this isn't
what I imagined.

592
00:45:46,018 --> 00:45:48,782
I was angry, and I wanted
to get back at my husband.

593
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,149
And I guess I kind of expected
a sort of:

594
00:45:51,323 --> 00:45:53,883
"Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am."

595
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:56,118
- But you're not like that at all.
- No.

596
00:45:58,597 --> 00:46:01,191
Hey, I'm having a great time!

597
00:46:02,668 --> 00:46:04,260
You're worth every penny.

598
00:46:25,924 --> 00:46:27,152
Honey!

599
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:29,855
I'm home!

600
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,997
We really need to talk, son.

601
00:46:36,968 --> 00:46:38,492
Hi, sweetheart.

602
00:46:38,937 --> 00:46:42,703
Honey, I got you some flowers,
and I just thought we could talk-

603
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:46,573
Two, three, four.

604
00:46:49,414 --> 00:46:51,382
Six, seven, eight.

605
00:47:02,494 --> 00:47:05,156
One, two, three, four.

606
00:47:07,432 --> 00:47:09,400
Five, six, seven.

607
00:47:13,638 --> 00:47:15,230
Hey, son!

608
00:47:15,407 --> 00:47:19,400
Thought you might want to check out
the annual football issue.

609
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:23,571
Look, smell.

610
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,573
No, smell it.

611
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:29,551
It's got a nice smell to it.
I kind of like it.

612
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,446
Hey, catch!

613
00:47:31,823 --> 00:47:34,155
Hey, you still got it.

614
00:47:39,331 --> 00:47:40,923
Sad.

615
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:43,067
Really, very sad.

616
00:47:43,602 --> 00:47:45,832
Jen? Yeah.

617
00:47:46,705 --> 00:47:52,337
Well, I've been doing a lot of thinking
about what you said back at school.

618
00:47:52,611 --> 00:47:55,808
About how I don't know how
to treat a woman.

619
00:47:56,548 --> 00:47:58,038
Well...

620
00:47:58,517 --> 00:48:00,178
...you're right.

621
00:48:01,987 --> 00:48:03,784
But I am working on it.

622
00:48:04,523 --> 00:48:06,115
Okay, I got it.

623
00:48:19,404 --> 00:48:21,497
Oh, man!

624
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:24,369
Excuse me.

625
00:48:33,518 --> 00:48:37,921
So how have you been?
It's good to see you. Okay...

626
00:48:42,194 --> 00:48:43,491
Sorry.

627
00:48:44,496 --> 00:48:45,758
Excuse me.

628
00:49:15,126 --> 00:49:19,119
This is the best part right here.
Get ready for this.

629
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:16,679
I tried EST,
and I shared all that I could.

630
00:50:16,855 --> 00:50:18,413
Then I bought the crystals.

631
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:22,583
Finally, I tried channeling,
so I find out who I am 1000 years ago.

632
00:50:22,761 --> 00:50:25,093
But I need to know who I am today.

633
00:50:47,686 --> 00:50:51,417
And don't forget to order
extra anchovy.

634
00:52:12,704 --> 00:52:15,537
Please think about coming over
to my parents'...

635
00:52:15,707 --> 00:52:17,800
...for the anniversary next week.

636
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:20,644
Come on.
At least pick up the phone.

637
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,047
Okay.

638
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,484
But I still love you.

639
00:52:26,818 --> 00:52:28,251
Bye-bye.

640
00:52:38,563 --> 00:52:40,793
So how are we doing?

641
00:52:40,965 --> 00:52:44,332
Well, less expenses, which is...

642
00:52:44,502 --> 00:52:47,596
- ... $6879.32.
- Hey, that's not bad.

643
00:52:47,772 --> 00:52:51,469
It's gonna get a lot better too.
We now take all major credit cards.

644
00:52:51,643 --> 00:52:52,940
- What?
- Oh, come on.

645
00:52:53,111 --> 00:52:55,272
These women haven't touched cash
in years.

646
00:52:55,447 --> 00:52:59,781
Now they don't have to go to the bank
or explain mysterious withdrawals.

647
00:52:59,951 --> 00:53:01,179
There'll be a record.

648
00:53:01,352 --> 00:53:04,014
Charged to Señor Pizza.
The bridge club ordered in.

649
00:53:04,189 --> 00:53:06,623
- I don't like it.
- I do the books at the store.

650
00:53:06,791 --> 00:53:07,815
Who's gonna know?

651
00:53:07,992 --> 00:53:10,586
Hold on, let me just get-

652
00:53:10,762 --> 00:53:12,662
Looks good.

653
00:53:18,903 --> 00:53:20,734
Stop it.

654
00:53:29,681 --> 00:53:31,546
Don't stop.

655
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,682
- Hi.
- Hi.

656
00:54:13,858 --> 00:54:17,555
Señor Pizza, with extra anchovies.

657
00:54:17,729 --> 00:54:20,197
Great. Right here is fine.

658
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,800
Right here?

659
00:54:26,538 --> 00:54:28,301
Well, sure.

660
00:54:31,976 --> 00:54:34,672
Leslie! Julie!

661
00:54:34,879 --> 00:54:36,676
Come on, kids! Pizza's here.

662
00:54:36,848 --> 00:54:38,406
Get the extra anchovies, Mom?

663
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:40,778
Well, I sure did. Come on.

664
00:54:46,224 --> 00:54:47,919
So you did these, huh?

665
00:54:48,259 --> 00:54:51,422
- What are they, mountains?
- Anatomical landscapes.

666
00:54:51,596 --> 00:54:54,531
That one's a shoulder.
That one is a neck.

667
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:57,497
That's a bicep,
the one with the egg there.

668
00:54:57,735 --> 00:54:59,032
Another shoulder.

669
00:54:59,204 --> 00:55:02,332
- So these are all parts of a guy?
- They're my husband.

670
00:55:02,574 --> 00:55:06,806
He's a bodybuilder.
Mr. California Olympian '84.

671
00:55:09,881 --> 00:55:13,180
So does he still look like that?

672
00:55:13,618 --> 00:55:17,019
No. He's much bigger now.

673
00:55:18,656 --> 00:55:20,419
Look, maybe I shouldn't be here.

674
00:55:20,592 --> 00:55:25,894
Don't worry. He won't be home
for hours. He's into private instruction.

675
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,696
Very private.

676
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:33,130
I'm sorry.

677
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:37,706
All day, he works on starlets
with little Barbie-doll hard bodies.

678
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,140
Why should he want to
come home to this?

679
00:55:40,311 --> 00:55:42,006
I would come home.

680
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:47,982
No, you should see these girls. All
they do is eat kelp and drink spritzers.

681
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:50,810
And here I am
with my cigarette and my drink.

682
00:55:51,022 --> 00:55:54,389
I can't help it if I like a shot
of tequila once in a while.

683
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,494
I like actual food, not fiber.

684
00:55:57,662 --> 00:56:02,861
Fuck fiber. I want grease, red meat.
I got pork chops hidden in the freezer.

685
00:56:04,002 --> 00:56:09,099
And my husband's in the perfect-body
business. It's like a joke.

686
00:56:09,641 --> 00:56:12,269
- Maybe he likes you the way you are.
- Yeah, right.

687
00:56:12,443 --> 00:56:15,935
Wanna see what he got me
for my birthday?

688
00:56:20,184 --> 00:56:21,811
Is that, like, a hint or what?

689
00:56:22,687 --> 00:56:25,747
Well, I don't think that was a hint.

690
00:56:27,525 --> 00:56:31,757
- Okay, smile.
- Oh, no. Please. Please.

691
00:56:32,297 --> 00:56:35,494
National Cellulite Contest
isn't until next week, okay?

692
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:37,130
That's good.

693
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,136
Smile. Oh, so sexy.

694
00:56:47,412 --> 00:56:49,437
- Yes. And how foolish-
- Great.

695
00:56:49,647 --> 00:56:52,343
Okay, relax and releasing
into the photo experience.

696
00:56:52,517 --> 00:56:55,543
And breathe and say yes
to the photo experience.

697
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:00,722
Don't make me look vulnerable.
Forbidden quality.

698
00:57:00,892 --> 00:57:02,723
Certain dignity. Anything?

699
00:57:08,166 --> 00:57:11,658
- A pastrami burrito, nachos alfredo-
- Hey!

700
00:57:11,836 --> 00:57:13,701
A Diet Coke.

701
00:57:17,842 --> 00:57:19,400
Randy Bodek?

702
00:57:21,713 --> 00:57:23,738
You been messing with my wife?

703
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:34,551
Multiple fractures,
internal hemorrhaging.

704
00:57:34,726 --> 00:57:37,752
- We need immediate x-rays.
- It's too late for that!

705
00:57:46,738 --> 00:57:49,366
We've got to open him right up.

706
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:53,805
Whatever you say, Dr. Palmer.

707
00:57:53,978 --> 00:57:57,277
- Dr. Palmer. Dr. Reed Palmer?
- That's right, Randy.

708
00:57:59,784 --> 00:58:01,775
I believe you know my wife.

709
00:58:02,954 --> 00:58:04,421
No anesthetic!

710
00:58:10,628 --> 00:58:14,758
- We need 12 units of BHT.
- And we need a bucket for the blood.

711
00:58:16,768 --> 00:58:20,226
- All right, flash cards, everybody.
- Flash cards in place.

712
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,579
- Hello?
- Hi, honey!

713
00:58:37,822 --> 00:58:39,187
Joe.

714
00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:44,050
- Is it raining?
- Yeah, we got a shower going here.

715
00:58:46,764 --> 00:58:48,061
Joe, who was that?

716
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:52,625
- Think you could foot the bill?
- He couldn't handle the two of us.

717
00:58:52,804 --> 00:58:54,465
Oh, just a couple of hookers.

718
00:58:55,206 --> 00:58:57,106
Look, I don't know what time-

719
00:59:14,459 --> 00:59:17,087
Well, I can't find anything
physically wrong.

720
00:59:17,261 --> 00:59:20,788
Joyce, I'm not making this up.
I have pains in my chest.

721
00:59:20,965 --> 00:59:22,762
I know you're not making this up.

722
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:24,992
I think it's caused from stress.

723
00:59:25,203 --> 00:59:28,866
Have you been upset or had
emotional problems lately?

724
00:59:31,976 --> 00:59:34,809
I can't believe it, right before
our 20th anniversary.

725
00:59:34,979 --> 00:59:38,039
How am I going to get through
that party when I know?

726
00:59:39,884 --> 00:59:42,375
And it isn't just his secretary.

727
00:59:42,553 --> 00:59:45,147
This time, he admitted
he was with hookers.

728
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:48,517
And I swear, the son of a bitch
called from a shower stall.

729
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:53,287
Well, at least my husband has
the brains to invent some excuse.

730
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,432
I mean, we had
our ups and downs...

731
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,795
...just like everybody else.

732
00:59:59,003 --> 01:00:02,131
But we were happy.
I know we were.

733
01:00:02,773 --> 01:00:04,638
How about sexually?

734
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:09,109
Great. Great, you know,
until recently.

735
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:11,838
Oh, God, it's all my fault.

736
01:00:12,016 --> 01:00:14,849
That your husband is having affairs?
Diane.

737
01:00:15,019 --> 01:00:18,011
Joyce!
What am I gonna do?

738
01:00:18,589 --> 01:00:20,318
I know what you're going through.

739
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,823
Believe me,
I know what you're going through.

740
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,955
What is that? A prescription?

741
01:00:26,731 --> 01:00:28,255
Kind of.

742
01:00:34,438 --> 01:00:36,235
Penny for them?

743
01:00:36,574 --> 01:00:37,871
Nothing.

744
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:43,046
- I've been having nightmares.
- About what?

745
01:00:43,214 --> 01:00:45,774
- Husbands.
- Me too.

746
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:49,477
No. I mean, like,
maybe I shouldn't be doing this.

747
01:00:49,787 --> 01:00:51,311
Randy.

748
01:00:51,756 --> 01:00:54,725
- Nobody's going to find out.
- Yeah, well.

749
01:00:54,992 --> 01:00:56,960
- You parked in the back, right?
- Yeah.

750
01:00:57,128 --> 01:01:01,758
Besides, Harry never comes home.
He's downtown all day. Every day.

751
01:01:03,968 --> 01:01:05,560
Kyoko?

752
01:01:06,571 --> 01:01:08,539
God, it's Harry!

753
01:01:13,678 --> 01:01:15,145
Pumpkin!

754
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,374
Where you at?

755
01:01:18,182 --> 01:01:19,774
- Harry.
- I don't believe it.

756
01:01:19,951 --> 01:01:24,752
I got 1000 crates of those
talking robots, sitting on the dock!

757
01:01:26,657 --> 01:01:29,319
I just find out I lost a week
on the warehouse.

758
01:01:29,493 --> 01:01:30,755
Oh, no.

759
01:01:31,395 --> 01:01:33,454
City forgot to inform us...

760
01:01:33,631 --> 01:01:37,328
...there's a little water main that
goes right through my goddamn lot.

761
01:01:37,501 --> 01:01:39,662
- I'm so sorry.
- That doesn't help.

762
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:50,179
I'll get you something to eat.
Are you hungry?

763
01:01:50,348 --> 01:01:53,511
Wish I could take a bath
in the middle of the afternoon.

764
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:03,393
Harry.

765
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,418
Harry.

766
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,668
I know something's wrong.

767
01:02:22,913 --> 01:02:25,404
You've been acting strange for weeks.

768
01:02:25,716 --> 01:02:27,843
You've been too freaking cheerful.

769
01:02:35,192 --> 01:02:37,956
I always use rose petals in my bath.

770
01:02:38,229 --> 01:02:39,821
Since when?

771
01:02:44,168 --> 01:02:45,465
Harry.

772
01:02:46,003 --> 01:02:47,903
Let me fix you a drink.

773
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,611
Intruder! Intruder!

774
01:02:54,779 --> 01:02:56,770
Trespasser! Trespasser!

775
01:02:56,947 --> 01:02:59,973
Bad boy! Bad boy!

776
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,346
Very bad! Very bad boy!

777
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:08,990
I'm pissed on you!

778
01:03:09,527 --> 01:03:11,586
Pissed on you, boy!

779
01:03:11,762 --> 01:03:13,923
Hey, is somebody up there?

780
01:03:14,098 --> 01:03:15,690
Of course not.

781
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,362
Don't you want your gin and tonic?

782
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:20,231
Harry.

783
01:03:20,404 --> 01:03:24,738
Baby, baby, baby. What's the matter?
Why are you crying?

784
01:03:46,797 --> 01:03:48,856
Intruder alert! Trespasser!

785
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:51,391
Intruder alert!

786
01:03:51,569 --> 01:03:53,730
Intruder alert! Trespasser!

787
01:03:56,774 --> 01:03:59,709
Trespasser! Bad boy!

788
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:02,402
Bad dude! Bad dude!

789
01:04:06,016 --> 01:04:09,474
Those things go off all the time!
Face it, Harry. They're junk.

790
01:04:09,653 --> 01:04:12,781
Junk! Harry Bruckner
does not buy junk!

791
01:04:13,324 --> 01:04:16,259
Now, where is your guy?
He's in there, huh?

792
01:04:18,496 --> 01:04:20,293
Your storeroom.
How should I know?

793
01:04:20,464 --> 01:04:22,159
Never mind.

794
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:25,302
There's other ways of finding out
who your guy is.

795
01:04:25,469 --> 01:04:30,236
Probably one of your old boyfriends.
There's the one from Yokohama...

796
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,388
Harry!

797
01:04:46,123 --> 01:04:49,581
- You have no right!
- Right!

798
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,820
Well, he's not here now.
But he was here today, wasn't he?

799
01:04:52,997 --> 01:04:56,433
Mr. Rose-on-the-Pillow.
Let me see that.

800
01:04:59,403 --> 01:05:03,840
Two-hour appointment with Dr. Palmer
this morning. House call. Right?

801
01:05:04,008 --> 01:05:07,808
I knew that son of a bitch
was porking his patients. I knew it!

802
01:05:09,346 --> 01:05:11,007
Goodbye, Harry.

803
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:17,481
Relax, Mr. Chapman.

804
01:05:17,655 --> 01:05:20,215
You're in good hands
with Dr. Palmer.

805
01:05:20,391 --> 01:05:22,916
Haven't had any complaints yet.

806
01:05:23,093 --> 01:05:24,321
Have we, Darlene?

807
01:05:24,695 --> 01:05:27,289
Son of a bitch!

808
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:30,832
You son of a bitch!

809
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:36,966
Move it! Get out of my way!

810
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:40,599
I didn't know Darlene was married.
She never told me.

811
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,906
Who the hell is Darlene?

812
01:05:52,456 --> 01:05:55,425
- Fred Astaire tipped me off.
- What?

813
01:05:55,759 --> 01:05:57,488
Joyce used to love to go dancing.

814
01:05:57,661 --> 01:06:00,289
Something was up when
I saw those old records out.

815
01:06:00,464 --> 01:06:04,195
- The roses in her dresser were the-
- Roses. You too?

816
01:06:04,368 --> 01:06:06,336
This guy's got some line of bullshit.

817
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,563
How come you didn't
give it to her then?

818
01:06:08,739 --> 01:06:11,572
I don't know. I'd been fooling
around with Darlene.

819
01:06:11,742 --> 01:06:14,836
- I figured maybe it was only fair.
- Bullshit.

820
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:18,072
Right! Bullshit!

821
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:21,850
There. There it is. Right there.

822
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:25,352
See, I noticed she gets
these roses every Tuesday.

823
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,821
That's the day this joker comes by.

824
01:06:27,992 --> 01:06:30,222
Personal fitness trainer.

825
01:06:31,128 --> 01:06:33,562
Let's get that bastard.

826
01:06:38,402 --> 01:06:41,166
Come on out here!

827
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:44,466
You have been porking my wife!

828
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,741
I see them moving around in there.
Come on out, little weasel!

829
01:06:57,521 --> 01:06:59,682
All right.

830
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:15,998
Great! This is all I need.

831
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,772
You guys are robbing my house.

832
01:07:18,943 --> 01:07:21,275
My wife's having an affair.

833
01:07:22,146 --> 01:07:23,613
What the hell?

834
01:07:24,481 --> 01:07:26,176
Go ahead.

835
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,783
Buddy?

836
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,179
Big, big buddy?

837
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:35,284
Your wife is having an affair?

838
01:07:55,379 --> 01:07:58,542
"Extra anchovies."

839
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:11,860
- Randy, what is wrong?
- Tony.

840
01:08:12,029 --> 01:08:16,193
A lot of these girls you've been seeing,
they've got boyfriends, don't they?

841
01:08:16,367 --> 01:08:19,996
- Of course. Husbands sometimes.
- Well, have any of them found out...

842
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:22,661
- ... and came after you or anything?
- Of course.

843
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:27,072
In Genova, a husband come
after me with a butcher knife.

844
01:08:27,244 --> 01:08:32,238
We fight. We fight, and I hit him
to the ground. I bite his ear off.

845
01:08:32,416 --> 01:08:34,145
He don't bother me no more.

846
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:35,649
Great.

847
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:38,583
Wilshire Motel? Extra anchovies?
No problem. Enjoy-

848
01:08:38,756 --> 01:08:42,817
No, no! There's a husband out there
who wants to kill me. I wanna retire!

849
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,460
- Hold it!
- What?

850
01:08:44,628 --> 01:08:49,088
Listen, you're exactly one romantic
interlude away from the jackpot.

851
01:08:49,266 --> 01:08:52,565
- One?
- Do you have one left in you? One!

852
01:08:53,203 --> 01:08:54,795
One. One, yes.

853
01:08:54,972 --> 01:08:57,099
Forty-three!
Seventy-six, hike. Go!

854
01:09:18,896 --> 01:09:22,593
Here you go, Mrs. Smith, Room 214.
Other side of the pool.

855
01:09:22,766 --> 01:09:24,563
Thank you.

856
01:09:42,519 --> 01:09:43,747
Hello?

857
01:09:44,788 --> 01:09:46,756
Are you Sal?

858
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:50,422
- Yeah.
- I'm Jenny.

859
01:09:50,594 --> 01:09:53,757
Oh, Randy's Jenny?
I thought you were in Santa Barbara.

860
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:56,263
Randy invited me to his parents' party.

861
01:09:56,433 --> 01:09:59,834
- I thought you guys broke up.
- Well, we did but...

862
01:10:00,504 --> 01:10:02,938
He's not seeing anybody else, is he?

863
01:10:03,474 --> 01:10:06,910
- Seeing? No.
- He's seeing somebody else.

864
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:10,171
No, he's not! Trust me.
He's gonna die when he sees you.

865
01:10:10,347 --> 01:10:12,212
Why don't you have
something to eat.

866
01:10:12,382 --> 01:10:13,644
Fine. I'll...

867
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:16,443
I'll have a Pizza Loco.

868
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,315
Like extra anchovies on that?

869
01:10:18,856 --> 01:10:20,084
No. Does anybody?

870
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:23,624
Are you kidding? Oh, yeah.
It's the hottest item all summer.

871
01:10:23,794 --> 01:10:26,490
It's kind of a female thing around here.

872
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:44,206
555-8411.

873
01:10:44,381 --> 01:10:50,013
Yeah, hello, look. I called earlier
to order the pizzas with extra anchovy.

874
01:10:51,388 --> 01:10:53,879
- Wilshire Motel?
- Yeah, that's right. I'm sorry.

875
01:10:54,057 --> 01:10:55,957
I'm gonna have to cancel that order.

876
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:57,684
Too late. It's on its way.

877
01:11:01,031 --> 01:11:03,499
I'm afraid you don't understand.

878
01:11:03,667 --> 01:11:07,262
You see, I don't think
I can eat the anchovies.

879
01:11:07,437 --> 01:11:08,961
I'm a married woman.

880
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:11,699
For all I care, you can throw
it out the window.

881
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:14,366
You order it, you pay!

882
01:11:14,545 --> 01:11:16,137
No! Hello!

883
01:11:26,356 --> 01:11:29,291
Ice. Get some ice.

884
01:11:47,211 --> 01:11:48,940
Hello?

885
01:12:03,994 --> 01:12:05,325
Hello?

886
01:12:37,294 --> 01:12:39,262
Last one.

887
01:13:13,497 --> 01:13:15,397
Hey, hey, come here.

888
01:13:21,705 --> 01:13:24,868
Bring the little fish. Okay.
Good, good. Come on! Come on!

889
01:13:26,543 --> 01:13:28,534
Okay, okay. Look out!
Move over!

890
01:13:32,182 --> 01:13:35,777
- Mommy, can I have a piece of pizza?
- Maybe later.

891
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:38,978
Somebody in there?

892
01:13:41,425 --> 01:13:42,858
Hello?

893
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:57,831
Bye!

894
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:08,682
Hey, Jen. All right.

895
01:14:08,852 --> 01:14:10,843
Jory. How are you?

896
01:14:11,021 --> 01:14:13,216
- You're looking good-
- Someone called.

897
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:16,223
- Your mom's been in an accident.
- Good.

898
01:14:16,393 --> 01:14:17,690
She's in the hospital!

899
01:14:18,228 --> 01:14:20,458
Get out of my face, will you?

900
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:23,190
Tell her why you don't
want me to talk to her.

901
01:14:23,367 --> 01:14:24,925
Go ahead. Tell her.

902
01:14:25,102 --> 01:14:28,902
Tell her Randy's making it with some
lady old enough to be my mother.

903
01:14:29,072 --> 01:14:31,905
Come on, Jen.
Let's get out of here.

904
01:14:38,515 --> 01:14:41,541
Hey, Tony! I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need a really-

905
01:14:41,718 --> 01:14:43,618
I need a really big favor.

906
01:14:43,787 --> 01:14:45,482
Randy, what is wrong now?

907
01:14:45,655 --> 01:14:48,886
You gotta deliver this
to the Wilshire Motel, Room 214.

908
01:14:49,459 --> 01:14:52,622
But it is all broken.
The tip will be very small.

909
01:14:52,796 --> 01:14:54,320
Don't worry about the tip.

910
01:14:54,498 --> 01:14:57,092
You gotta tell the woman
that you're very sorry.

911
01:14:57,267 --> 01:15:00,862
There are no more anchovies. She
should go home and forget about it.

912
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:04,405
- But we have many anchovies.
- Yeah, I know. Just do it.

913
01:15:04,574 --> 01:15:06,439
Okay.

914
01:15:12,349 --> 01:15:14,783
You son of a bitch!

915
01:15:15,118 --> 01:15:18,178
Listen, man, I tried to tell her.
She wouldn't listen!

916
01:15:18,355 --> 01:15:20,983
How could you?
What kind of amoral chump are you?

917
01:15:21,158 --> 01:15:24,992
- I wouldn't call it amoral.
- It's the sickest thing I've ever heard!

918
01:15:25,162 --> 01:15:28,029
Oh, come on. I tried
to cover for you. I honestly did.

919
01:15:28,198 --> 01:15:30,632
Then Jory got to her.

920
01:15:31,601 --> 01:15:33,159
Jory got to my mother?

921
01:15:33,336 --> 01:15:34,860
- God! That is aw-
- No!

922
01:15:35,038 --> 01:15:36,801
- Jenny!
- Jenny?

923
01:15:36,973 --> 01:15:38,201
- She's here?
- Yes.

924
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:39,967
Where is she?
What did she say?

925
01:15:40,143 --> 01:15:43,704
Does she want to get back together?
This is great.

926
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,440
Not, not really.

927
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,865
Hello, I-

928
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:12,936
If you say another word,
I swear to God, I'll lose my nerve.

929
01:16:19,182 --> 01:16:21,150
- Diane!
- No. Dad?

930
01:16:21,318 --> 01:16:23,445
- Did a girl named Jenny call?
- No.

931
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:27,613
Son, I think your mother
is gonna divorce me.

932
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:30,954
- What?
- I think your mother has left.

933
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:34,427
- You mean she's not back yet?
- Back from where?

934
01:16:35,365 --> 01:16:38,562
- From wherever she went.
- No.

935
01:16:38,735 --> 01:16:40,202
And tonight of all nights.

936
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:42,531
At a party where
every person we know...

937
01:16:42,706 --> 01:16:45,971
...is gonna watch a marriage
of 20 years go down the tube.

938
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:48,077
- No!
- Yes.

939
01:16:48,245 --> 01:16:50,475
- I bet she went to Tiki Joe's.
- Tiki Joe's?

940
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:53,707
To check on the last-minute details.
You know how she gets!

941
01:16:53,884 --> 01:16:56,375
- I'm gonna stop her.
- What?

942
01:16:56,686 --> 01:17:00,588
Help her. While you get
ready to go. Okay! Oh, good.

943
01:17:02,559 --> 01:17:04,424
Get ready!

944
01:17:14,638 --> 01:17:16,902
You are very beautiful.

945
01:17:19,042 --> 01:17:21,101
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

946
01:17:21,278 --> 01:17:22,939
I thought I could.

947
01:17:23,113 --> 01:17:25,775
- But I just can't.
- I have respect for this.

948
01:17:25,949 --> 01:17:28,850
Oh, well, thank you.
That's very nice of you.

949
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:33,080
- You are not cheap and easy.
- No. I tried, but it's just not me.

950
01:17:33,256 --> 01:17:35,918
- Forget pizza. I buy you real dinner.
- No.

951
01:17:36,092 --> 01:17:37,753
Dinner and a movie.

952
01:17:37,928 --> 01:17:40,123
- No. Thank you, no.
- I pay!

953
01:17:40,297 --> 01:17:43,095
No! Look, I don't want
to sleep with you or date you.

954
01:17:43,266 --> 01:17:45,291
I just want to leave now.

955
01:17:45,468 --> 01:17:49,234
- You mean, you say no to me?
- Yes, I say no and goodbye.

956
01:17:49,406 --> 01:17:52,807
- You cannot leave.
- Oh, $200 dollars, right?

957
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:56,137
No, it's $ 12.50.
I give you coupon discount.

958
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,810
You give coupons?

959
01:17:58,982 --> 01:18:01,177
Not for everyone. A privilege.

960
01:18:01,351 --> 01:18:03,683
You are not the regular
American woman.

961
01:18:03,853 --> 01:18:06,253
And I am not the regular delivery boy.

962
01:18:06,423 --> 01:18:08,755
Oh, my God. You're not?

963
01:18:08,925 --> 01:18:10,984
No. He asked me to come here...

964
01:18:11,161 --> 01:18:13,459
...and say we have
no more anchovies.

965
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:15,825
But I cannot lie to you, my darling.

966
01:18:15,999 --> 01:18:19,230
- I have many anchovies for you-
- Oh, no! No! Please!

967
01:18:19,402 --> 01:18:21,461
Oh, this is a horrible mistake.
I'm so-

968
01:18:21,638 --> 01:18:24,732
Oh, my God! Oh, you're just some-
Oh, my God!

969
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:27,741
You cannot not leave. Wait!

970
01:18:27,911 --> 01:18:31,142
My anniversary party.
Oh, Joe's already there.

971
01:18:31,314 --> 01:18:33,908
Oh, God! All those people!

972
01:18:42,325 --> 01:18:43,587
Wait!

973
01:18:48,665 --> 01:18:50,530
- I'm such a jerk.
- Come on, Jenny.

974
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:55,728
I was so stupid to come here without
calling first. What was I thinking?

975
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:58,635
I hate to say it,
but the guy never appreciated you.

976
01:18:58,808 --> 01:19:00,935
I was just starting
to get over him too.

977
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:03,602
Jen, don't be so hard on yourself.

978
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:06,613
I mean, so you made a mistake.
Big deal.

979
01:19:06,783 --> 01:19:08,478
You're a terrific person.

980
01:19:08,652 --> 01:19:13,146
You have everything going for you.
Hey, come on.

981
01:19:13,323 --> 01:19:15,587
Onward and upward, right?

982
01:19:15,759 --> 01:19:17,124
Yeah.

983
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:19,990
Yeah, I guess, I-

984
01:19:20,163 --> 01:19:22,290
- Jory!
- You know, we'd be good together.

985
01:19:22,465 --> 01:19:24,228
- Get off me!
- We both need it.

986
01:19:24,401 --> 01:19:25,663
Get off!

987
01:19:26,236 --> 01:19:27,533
Stop!

988
01:19:35,578 --> 01:19:38,570
Stop! Stop!

989
01:19:38,748 --> 01:19:40,238
Thank you so much.

990
01:19:40,417 --> 01:19:44,319
You have just saved my life.
This guy was...

991
01:19:46,856 --> 01:19:49,848
- No funny cash withdrawals.
- Me neither.

992
01:19:50,026 --> 01:19:52,586
Sleazeball's a pro.
He's gotta be paid somehow.

993
01:19:52,762 --> 01:19:55,595
- Well, he wouldn't accept credit cards.
- Hold it.

994
01:19:55,765 --> 01:20:00,668
I've got three charges for deliveries
from someplace called Señor Pizza.

995
01:20:01,638 --> 01:20:02,866
So?

996
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:06,873
Sold for 200 bucks a pop.
And Monica hates pizza.

997
01:20:08,912 --> 01:20:10,971
Wait a minute.

998
01:20:11,147 --> 01:20:13,741
- I got five of those.
- Oh, no.

999
01:20:15,418 --> 01:20:18,751
No, Jesus Christ!

1000
01:20:36,306 --> 01:20:38,740
- I love you!
- Go away!

1001
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:44,571
- Are you crazy? You'll be killed!
- I don't care.

1002
01:20:44,748 --> 01:20:47,148
- I will die for your love!
- Move your hand!

1003
01:20:47,317 --> 01:20:49,478
- I love you!
- Move that hand!

1004
01:20:49,652 --> 01:20:51,142
I love you!

1005
01:20:58,928 --> 01:21:02,694
He's probably some young beach-boy
stud. With a name like Jason...

1006
01:21:02,866 --> 01:21:04,857
Yeah, some poetry-reading wimp.

1007
01:21:05,034 --> 01:21:08,333
Whoever he is, he's gonna
get his face stomped.

1008
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:25,817
- Where's Tony?
- Tony?

1009
01:21:25,989 --> 01:21:29,720
He never came back from his break.
Sal's on delivery. I'm all alone.

1010
01:21:29,893 --> 01:21:33,158
- Randy?
- Jenny.

1011
01:21:35,799 --> 01:21:37,664
You look different.

1012
01:21:38,067 --> 01:21:40,160
Since when do you notice that?

1013
01:21:41,237 --> 01:21:43,535
I see you've changed your style.

1014
01:21:43,706 --> 01:21:46,971
Oh, yes, I have.

1015
01:21:53,817 --> 01:21:56,513
- I missed you.
- Did you?

1016
01:21:57,387 --> 01:21:59,252
Yes.

1017
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:02,454
You bitch! Nobody plays
with me like that-

1018
01:22:02,625 --> 01:22:04,616
- Leave her alone!
- You and me, bozo!

1019
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:06,421
All right! Outside! Outside!

1020
01:22:06,596 --> 01:22:08,689
Take it outside! Come on.
Come on.

1021
01:22:14,037 --> 01:22:16,835
- Don't do this.
- Jenny, stay out of it.

1022
01:22:21,578 --> 01:22:24,741
- No watches and no rings.
- No chains.

1023
01:22:24,914 --> 01:22:28,475
It's got extra everything.
Sausages and the jalapeño peppers-

1024
01:22:28,918 --> 01:22:31,182
Where's your delivery guy?

1025
01:22:32,255 --> 01:22:34,723
Out...
Out back.

1026
01:22:34,891 --> 01:22:37,689
Where you going?
Hey, wait a minute. Where you-?

1027
01:22:37,861 --> 01:22:39,158
Come on, come on.

1028
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:42,890
- Randy, can we just get out of here?
- This is something I gotta do.

1029
01:22:43,066 --> 01:22:45,864
What are you, chicken?
What are you waiting for?

1030
01:22:47,237 --> 01:22:48,465
Jeez!

1031
01:22:48,638 --> 01:22:50,230
Hey, wait! Wait!

1032
01:22:50,406 --> 01:22:52,636
You're Joe Bodek's son!

1033
01:22:53,409 --> 01:22:54,706
Yeah.

1034
01:22:54,878 --> 01:22:56,937
Okay. All right.

1035
01:22:57,113 --> 01:22:59,206
I'm Randy Bodek.

1036
01:22:59,382 --> 01:23:02,545
Hey, what is this?
Leave him alone! It's not him.

1037
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:05,180
He's a homo!

1038
01:23:08,558 --> 01:23:11,220
All right, Bodek. You ready
to get your ass kicked?

1039
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:19,797
Oh, no.

1040
01:23:21,571 --> 01:23:23,402
I'm talking to him.

1041
01:23:31,814 --> 01:23:35,807
Your stud days are over, pretty boy!

1042
01:23:43,693 --> 01:23:44,921
Right in the face!

1043
01:23:56,205 --> 01:23:58,196
Okay, let's go!

1044
01:24:02,512 --> 01:24:06,471
- What is going on?
- It's a long story.

1045
01:24:12,155 --> 01:24:14,988
Your luggage, pal. Luggage!

1046
01:24:18,361 --> 01:24:20,921
- Cocktail, Mr. Bodek?
- Yeah, why not?

1047
01:24:25,335 --> 01:24:27,667
Hi. How y'all doing?

1048
01:24:33,843 --> 01:24:37,506
Hey, Joe, congratulations.
Where's the better half?

1049
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,409
Wish I knew.

1050
01:24:50,693 --> 01:24:53,025
Oh, my God!

1051
01:25:37,774 --> 01:25:39,833
What do you think
of your lover-boy now?

1052
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:43,103
He's delivered
his last pizza around here.

1053
01:25:44,213 --> 01:25:45,646
Who is this?

1054
01:25:46,049 --> 01:25:49,246
Pizza? Looking for the guy
who delivers pizza?

1055
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:54,486
Well, it wasn't exactly how
I planned to spend my summer.

1056
01:25:55,391 --> 01:25:56,619
Just happened.

1057
01:25:59,328 --> 01:26:00,920
You hate me?

1058
01:26:01,898 --> 01:26:05,698
How am I supposed to feel, knowing
that you slept with all those women?

1059
01:26:05,868 --> 01:26:09,201
Well, see, the weird thing is,
I didn't sleep with all of them.

1060
01:26:09,372 --> 01:26:11,966
They wanted somebody
to make them feel special.

1061
01:26:12,141 --> 01:26:13,665
Come on.

1062
01:26:15,978 --> 01:26:19,607
There are a lot of women out there
who don't believe in love anymore.

1063
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:24,284
You know, all they wanted was
a little romance and a little respect.

1064
01:26:24,454 --> 01:26:27,048
So I tried to give
them what they missed.

1065
01:26:28,124 --> 01:26:29,716
You did all this for them?

1066
01:26:29,892 --> 01:26:33,259
No! I did it because
I had to pay my own tuition.

1067
01:26:34,263 --> 01:26:35,855
You know.

1068
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:38,799
Because I had to get back to you.

1069
01:26:40,303 --> 01:26:43,898
And how would you feel if I said:

1070
01:26:44,774 --> 01:26:47,902
"I slept with all these guys
this summer, but, hey...

1071
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:50,512
...I did it for you"?

1072
01:26:53,249 --> 01:26:55,308
I'd hate it.

1073
01:26:56,619 --> 01:26:59,315
Just take me to the bus station.

1074
01:27:00,356 --> 01:27:02,051
Okay.

1075
01:27:02,992 --> 01:27:05,654
- I just have to make one stop first.
- Where?

1076
01:27:05,828 --> 01:27:08,854
Well, I gotta save
my parents' marriage.

1077
01:27:28,084 --> 01:27:29,346
Hey!

1078
01:27:30,853 --> 01:27:32,844
That woman nuts?

1079
01:27:33,022 --> 01:27:34,785
That's my mother!

1080
01:27:34,957 --> 01:27:36,822
- Hello. Diane?
- Hi, hi, hi.

1081
01:27:47,770 --> 01:27:49,032
- Randy!
- Eyes front.

1082
01:27:49,972 --> 01:27:51,633
Hey!

1083
01:27:54,744 --> 01:27:57,645
- Who was that?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

1084
01:28:02,718 --> 01:28:04,310
Joe!

1085
01:28:04,487 --> 01:28:06,580
Oh, Joe! Oh, Joe!

1086
01:28:10,092 --> 01:28:12,652
- Joe, I'm so sorry.
- No, honey, I am so sorry.

1087
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:15,491
- I am so sorry.
- Later, Linda.

1088
01:28:15,665 --> 01:28:18,259
- See, your husband-
- No problem, Linda. Okay?

1089
01:28:18,434 --> 01:28:20,868
- Go away. Go away! Go away!
- Joe.

1090
01:28:21,037 --> 01:28:23,835
Okay. Okay.

1091
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,670
Hi, I'm Brad.
Frosty beverage?

1092
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:28,174
No. No frosty beverage.

1093
01:28:28,344 --> 01:28:29,606
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1094
01:28:30,746 --> 01:28:32,543
Look out!

1095
01:28:36,652 --> 01:28:39,052
So this is the man
who stands between us.

1096
01:28:39,222 --> 01:28:42,055
Tony! Tony!
What are you doing here?

1097
01:28:42,225 --> 01:28:44,489
- I need to speak with you.
- But-

1098
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:46,719
Now look, I've been thinking this over.

1099
01:28:46,896 --> 01:28:48,261
- I'm your father.
- I know.

1100
01:28:48,431 --> 01:28:52,527
You're my son and I love you,
and it's really okay that you're gay.

1101
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:54,226
- Gay?
- What?

1102
01:28:54,403 --> 01:28:57,702
I don't think this is the place
for your lover to make a scene.

1103
01:28:57,874 --> 01:29:00,104
- Lover?
- What are you talking about?

1104
01:29:00,276 --> 01:29:02,938
I know all about you
and this guy Alex, here.

1105
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:05,276
- But I'm Tony.
- You're who?

1106
01:29:05,448 --> 01:29:08,076
I meet this woman
when I deliver pizza for him.

1107
01:29:08,584 --> 01:29:10,279
For you?

1108
01:29:10,553 --> 01:29:13,386
- You're the regular delivery boy?
- Yeah, see-

1109
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:15,786
- So, what is this guy doing here?
- Well-

1110
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:18,222
- I love her.
- What did you say?

1111
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:20,157
- She needs a real man.
- Oh, no.

1112
01:29:20,329 --> 01:29:21,819
- Are you talking to me?
- Dad!

1113
01:29:21,998 --> 01:29:25,434
- No, no. Wait, Dad! Dad!
- No! No! No!

1114
01:29:26,168 --> 01:29:29,296
- He better be in there, kid.
- Yeah, he better.

1115
01:29:31,474 --> 01:29:33,442
Joe! Joe! Joe!

1116
01:29:33,609 --> 01:29:35,577
Come on. Come on.
Calm down.

1117
01:29:40,349 --> 01:29:42,408
There he is!
That's him!

1118
01:30:07,843 --> 01:30:09,310
- Randy!
- What?

1119
01:30:09,478 --> 01:30:11,810
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Come on.

1120
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:15,945
Come here. You come here.
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

1121
01:30:20,356 --> 01:30:22,187
No!

1122
01:30:26,128 --> 01:30:28,653
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

1123
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:32,867
Oh, Felicia.

1124
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:47,146
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1125
01:30:47,616 --> 01:30:50,517
You son of a bitch!

1126
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:53,581
My favorite toupee!

1127
01:30:53,823 --> 01:30:55,848
Mom!
Excuse me.

1128
01:31:11,707 --> 01:31:13,800
Let me in there.

1129
01:31:18,581 --> 01:31:21,106
Kid, you're gone.
Your days are numbered.

1130
01:31:21,283 --> 01:31:23,046
He's getting away!

1131
01:31:41,737 --> 01:31:42,999
Come here.

1132
01:31:43,172 --> 01:31:45,072
All right.
What the hell is all this?

1133
01:31:45,241 --> 01:31:47,869
- Your son has been porking my wife!
- Mine too.

1134
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:49,375
Same here.

1135
01:31:49,545 --> 01:31:51,206
- I thought you were gay!
- No!

1136
01:31:52,515 --> 01:31:54,380
Mom!

1137
01:31:55,251 --> 01:31:58,687
Mom, I don't believe this!

1138
01:32:02,224 --> 01:32:06,422
Hold it, you three.
Hold it right there.

1139
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:12,031
- Oh, wait. Wait. Mom? Dad?
- Yes.

1140
01:32:12,201 --> 01:32:13,998
Excuse me.

1141
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:17,967
This is Jenny. We've been living
together for two semesters.

1142
01:32:18,941 --> 01:32:21,034
And I'm in love with her.

1143
01:32:21,677 --> 01:32:24,510
You have no idea
how happy I am to meet you.

1144
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:26,477
- It's nice to meet you.
- Beautiful.

1145
01:32:26,649 --> 01:32:28,344
- How pretty you are.
- Thank you.

1146
01:32:28,517 --> 01:32:30,348
- This is great.
- This is beautiful.

1147
01:32:30,519 --> 01:32:31,884
- Come on, let's go.
- Go.

1148
01:32:32,054 --> 01:32:34,579
- Frosty beverage?
- Thank you.

1149
01:32:37,259 --> 01:32:41,696
- So you're a friend of his?
- Best friend.

1150
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:45,463
There's this song.
It goes:

1151
01:32:51,407 --> 01:32:54,865
That's it!
Can you play that?

1152
01:33:10,292 --> 01:33:11,589
- Come on.
- I don't know.

1153
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,352
Come on.

1154
01:33:14,797 --> 01:33:17,231
Jenny, I'm gonna
give the money back.

1155
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:19,629
I don't want it.
I'm gonna keep my day job.

1156
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:21,793
I'm gonna come
and see you on weekends.

1157
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:24,701
Forget about it.
You're going back to college.

1158
01:33:24,874 --> 01:33:26,739
You got some idea
what you're doing.

1159
01:33:26,909 --> 01:33:29,377
Oh, I do.
I want to major in premed...

1160
01:33:29,545 --> 01:33:34,482
...minor in Japanese,
study some photography courses...

1161
01:33:35,417 --> 01:33:38,477
- I think we'll talk about this tomorrow.
- Okay.

1162
01:33:38,654 --> 01:33:40,383
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1163
01:33:40,556 --> 01:33:42,683
Where did you learn this?
Never mind.

1164
01:33:42,858 --> 01:33:45,156
I don't want to know.

1165
01:35:08,844 --> 01:35:11,005
Oh, by the way, the husbands?

1166
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:13,978
Their wives did show up
to bail them out.

1167
01:35:14,149 --> 01:35:18,916
Claude and Monica, they decided
to forget the whole thing.

1168
01:35:20,155 --> 01:35:24,387
Joyce and Reed, well,
they weren't gonna forget anything.

1169
01:35:27,463 --> 01:35:29,431
But they decided to make up anyway.

1170
01:35:30,032 --> 01:35:32,091
Kyoko was gonna bail out Harry.

1171
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:34,930
Then it hit her,
"Why ruin a good thing?"

1172
01:35:35,738 --> 01:35:38,571
Hey, get your hands off of me!

1173
01:35:38,741 --> 01:35:40,709
I want to talk to my wife!

1174
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,130
